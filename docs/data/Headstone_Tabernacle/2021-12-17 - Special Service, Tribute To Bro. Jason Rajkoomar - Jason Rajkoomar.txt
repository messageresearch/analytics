to your people guided here those that are friends of his family witnesses god may you help each one as we as a country as a nation as a people go through this treacherous time help lord and bless tonight in jesus name i ask it amen um jason rajkumar he is the son that you would like to have the brother that you would want to have the son-in-law you'd like to have the believer you'd like to have that's the kind of person that jesus was loved jesus and was not ashamed his shout was one of the loudest in church he always knew when jason was there he had a bubbly effervescent personality such a joy original authentic there's nobody like him he's virtually one in a million very rare you get somebody with all these qualities that make them a person that you want to be around make jokes make you laugh say cute things that was jason he was real he wasn't uh imposter impersonator he was just who he was in god and without a doubt he loved the lord and we really appreciate and thank god for his life as a member of his own tabernacle he was somebody that would clean around the church and serve in whatever capacity was it was a testimony around the believers and we are grateful to god to have encountered and to see jason um god bless us to have him pass his life you know and pass through it or we we're always grateful and thankful because we don't know what time what day uh you know that we will get a call and it shows us how humble how uh dependent we have to approach life even so much more than going forward you know and um so i would at this time i want to pass over to berligidion we'll take it from there and we'll continue on but gideon principle good evening friends i know it is such strange circumstances that has brought us together tonight but at the same time i think it allows us to really reflect on all that he represented and to really capture some of that and to share with us as a memorial on his behalf i'd like us to start off with a relative a dear friend none other than sister angela bechan to just share a few few words from my heart about her nephew jason good night each and everyone returns in the precious name of our lord and savior jesus christ for us as the family this has been a most unusual time and almost something that we had not really you know we would not be prepared for this it happened you know we were all for information and we were all you know so full of hope and you know we believed that he would have made it and that was what our cause will but suffice it to say you know god saw it best to take jason home and i was reading some of their comments today on facebook and you know sometimes when somebody dies sometimes it is so sad because you have to look for things to say you have to think you have to search your memory to think about you know good things to say sad does that mean but it is true but with json every single comment that was made about json it was the truth it was not fabricated it was not exaggerated it was the truth about jason my nephew jason was a very unique person and unique in all aspects from very early in his life but i would like to i would want to more emphasize on json spiritual life because from very early jason loved the lord there is no doubt about it from very young and every each and everyone who knew jason could attest to this you know he loved the lord and as much as he loved the lord jesus also embraced life to the fullest his love for the lord was also compared to his love for food his love for traveler his love for sports his love for spending time with his family all the nephews the cousins they would gravitate towards jason just from the time uncle jason came it was oh my god like it was like christmas was every day and even though jason at times would play christmas you know play santa claus for do any questions period but jason coming to anybody's home was like christmas anger it would be hugs and kisses and and he would say something to make everyone laugh and that was jesus you know his son misha oh my god that was his greatest pride and joy he loved that child and he was a role father for misha but as i said i want to talk more about jason's spiritual walk with the lord because he loved the lord all and i want to remember i don't want to stay too long tonight because i know there are many other people to speak but one of the things that stayed in my mind very much was i remember that in 2016 jason went to one of the biggest trials in his life where the son that he had longed for he had a baby and he i think he and yes it was in 2016 that he um the baby came here he lived for a month and then he died and the day in question when it was the baby's funeral we were all by the grave and after they did the um you know the crystal was there and she was you know really really tearful and so forth and they put the baby down into the gong and they piled the earth on the grave and json felt he fell stressed flat on that dirt and all jason would say is hallelujah hallelujah and you could feel the pangs of agony in jason's voice but what stood out to me is that how he did not say lord why did you do it you know lord this is so unfair his cry was hallelujah hallelujah and how many you know times we go through things and and sometimes we we we question god and we you know and it takes a good bit of faith and courage to be able to go beyond that and still praise god and give him praises you know and this is one of the things that stood out you know with jason with me and there were many other things that that we would go anywhere you go and somebody wanted to us json would not hesitate as a young man he would not some people sometimes they are ashamed to pray or they would pray very softly and jason but you already had jason painted the top of his voice you know and without any any kind of you know feeling shame or reservations and these are the things that i know that that kept jason for all his life his faith his faith in god through the good times and the bad times she was always always faithful to god regardless of what and he had he got a few knocks in his life but again he stood on wavering as a young man and i know that god maybe at this time it was you know his time you know for him to be with the lord and we will miss him he will miss him because as i said he was a live wire of in our family jesus would go to the most serious person and he would hug them and they would be so shocked and they would just be taken aback but that was jason you expected jason to do the unexpected in his job he was an exemplary person as you would he see on facebook you know and there's so many other things that i could say about my nephew jason but i don't want to take take up too much time but we will miss him you know he has lived a life for us um and we have to learn from his his walk with god and we know that he is in god's arms and he is the only other side with his mom and his son that he lost and we know that one day we live in that hope we have that hope that we will all be together so even though it is a time for us to be you know it is a star time but in the spirit we know that you know to be to be absent in the body is to be present with the lord and um i we will celebrate jesus and life and i just want to say you know thank you everyone for all the support from brother ovid straight back to all the family the friends thank you so much for the support in love that we have been receiving and may god bless you all for all your love and support thank you and good night tremendous tremendous you really appreciate your kind words and we know it's nothing but the truth a true testimony of who he is and who he was and what he stood for at this time i am not sure they're here but we'd like to invite a representative from the office of the prime minister to share a few words as it relates to jason at this time i don't know if miss jack martin is with us okay if she comes in a little later we will revert to her but we'd like to to move on to invite brother mike blackman hi good night all those who are on the zoo tonight uh brothers and sisters from the church friends and well-wishers uh jason and the family let me first extend my condolences to the rajkumar family and i just want to give a short testimony of of my um interaction with jason jason i know jason you know through as a little boy coming to the church um with his mother sandra it's about the same age as my full son and um we he would have grown into a young man and during that time you know he would have connected more with my son than with myself however within the last year or so couple years really jason um applied to go into the customs and excise division where i had worked before i retired and he had approached me to get some sort of understanding of what the division was about and he had to sit an exam for entry so i had helped him with some papers you know some people put together a little juicier for him and that is how we started to speak with each other and communicate a little closer than we were in church you know just brother mike and brother jason um during that time i got to really know some of the you know thoughts that he because you know he would tell me about his plans you know first weekend his main thing was to get into customs as a career pathway so you know he would be asking me about different things and telling me about different things that they do but um i think we'll be really connected strange is that you know a couple months ago jason and i spoke about getting fit because you know i was telling them that you know if you're gonna go into customs there's a law enforcement um you know you need to be fit and jason and i would have arranged to go up to chan lady chance on the hills and we did a couple we did a circuit and it was during that time that you know with him talking to me about his plans for his future that i i got to really appreciate you know who this young man was um i can say some of the things that he shared with me one of them is he spoke about his wife crystal he spoke about him thinking that he would have to live as a bachelor for the rest of his life because no one had come into his life there was no one he had seen that made him feel um how crystal made him feel then he talked about crystal coming into his life how much he meant to him and also his his young son so it was indeed a tremendous feeling of grief and loss when i felt that jason was plucked away before he could realize some of his his his great ambitions and dreams one was the entire customs and excited vision the other one is that then he had started his house and he um had a lot of plans about you know how the family would grow and store um jason was exemplary because in in the midst of everything jason had one central thing that he spoke to me about and that was his love for his family and being you know a provider a shelter a protector for them and you know god put man on the earth as as as a leader of a family and jason exemplified all the things that a leader a father should be in a family jason was someone who you know he would come to me and say brother mikey i ring them and ring a ring service commission said they might let them sleep on a thing or not making sure that you know they are on top of my case that was the kind of person he was jason was a go-getter you know he always had some little thing going on i decided to make some extra money and stuff like that and one of the things that i admired about jason was is always that bubbly personality you really know how jason was in church jason will be at the front worshiping and praising god and um the last time i spoke with him we were in the in the mail washroom bathroom and jason was part of the cleaning team daddy and i was just sharing with him you know the he was asking me about some of the cleaning stuff he hadn't seen so i was just sharing with him you know what he uses what but the point is jason was always helpful he was always a a loving person with a nice aura of you know kindness and gentleness and always looking to give a way to somebody to bring a lovely atmosphere and a lovely spirit into the interaction with althouse what i want to say tonight is jason has left some footprints on the sounds of time and he has left some footprints that i think any young person would do well to follow for those of us who are grieving i want us to remember one thing today i saw a picture of jason resplendent in a white suit on a bench and as i looked at it i just got a feeling that this is jason sitting in heaven right now you know in a lovely white suit resplendent in white i mean immaculate i think it's white i'm a living with colors but i mean he looked like an angel sitting on a bench in that suit just to remember that sometimes we grieve and i remember there was one incident where that great prophet called his wife back and she said why did you call me back you preached about it you talked about it but you would never you would never know what it's like until you get there you know so we grieve but you know what jesus jesus is sitting on that bench with that smile on his face i'm saying his favorite words everything nice in jesus name and that is what i want us to remember jason's always positive faith and the fact that in spite of whatever challenges whatever conditions face him his cry was everything nice in jesus name i'm wishing the family all god's comfort from the great comforter and that crystal and all the other members of the family would gather wrong and give priscilla the support and the strength to to raise little measure and the way he should be um you know there's something we seen animal kingdom with elephants if there's a wounded elephant um when a fund that is is weak all the other elephants get together and they surround that elephant and they prop it because once that elephant goes down it's very hard for it to get back up so they prop that elephant to make sure that it doesn't go down at all and they will lean on that lean with that elephant and prop it until that elephant can support itself and i think that's what we need to do prayerfully right now for sister crystal and the rest of the family we need to be together wrong as a family and give them all the support all the props that are necessary to make sure that they can survive this period and come out at the end of it stronger better and walking in the path with the json when i wanted so to all those who are on the zoom tonight i say god bless you let us remember jason jason's crying all the time everything nice in jesus name and he didn't just make out a talk he walked the talk he didn't just talk he walked that talk so i think he has left a great um story behind in terms of his life let's all learn from it as we continue to walk on the pathway to that great place where we will meet him once again god bless you thank you thank you very very much for the blackman what timely words i think it really speaks and you can see a consistent theme no matter what perspective it comes from he was truly an exemplary person if i could add one little thing i would say jason is one of the most passionate people i know and he's for real she doesn't have no hangups at all if this is black italian black if you don't like it you tell you don't like it if you love it he tell it he loves it and as i said that i could could remember if i were to identify four things that he was overzealous and passionate and really in love with it was one god he really really really loved the lord two you see his family you couldn't get between jason and family he spoke of would work hard would do everything all his ambitions was driven to his wife and son always spoke about them the next thing he was super passionate about if you know him you'll know he's passionate about food jason love good food love to eat it didn't matter how much food what kind of food once there was food he said coming and lastly he might look so but he loves sports especially basketball jason was a sport man in his hat he really really you could talk that he could walk and and he could play it as well with that said i want us to just pause a little bit and ask that the technical guys in the background would share the screen and we take in a video clip of jason at this point and just turn it over to them as they put things in place for that [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] do [Music] i'm so glad that i can see i'm one of them one of them oh glory hallelujah whoa i can't make too much noise the neighbors and i'm sleeping i love them oh glory hallelujah that was good fire fire fire fire oh glory hallelujah [Music] we walk walk in the light walk walk walk in the light walk walk walk in the light walking in the light of god hallelujah [Music] [Music] wow [Music] a little something to sparkly morning i'm gonna plant some peas hallelujah oh glory hallelujah [Music] surprise [Music] and that is why i love him so he's soaring to me [Music] hallelujah oh glory [Music] come on come on come on hallelujah [Music] [Applause] wow [Music] [Music] [Music] all along the way you know it's clear that as that clip was played jason was a worshipper jason may not have been the best singer but you see when it comes to worship he would make a joyful noise as you see morning time noon night time he say go and plant peas probably going to work some now on the whole crystal making out but you know what i could also recall when the within the early days of the pandemic itself which would have been last year probably march april also we would have bible study and praying for me so via zoo and jason i know his aunt described him as a unique person but one of the unique things he used to do and i'm sure a lot of us might recall is that he would be on this zoom wherever he was if he was at work he on the zoom prayer meeting at work or bible study at work if he on the road zoom on the road when he arrived home zoom at home he was one of the more consistent persons that i could identify really really really a true worshiper you know a lot of these clips shared would have been shared with with a brother's group we had on whatsapp and it's interesting to know that it wasn't mandatory to share anything like this but many a sunday morning when you think getting ready to the church also jason would i assume he would be making eclipse at that time so sunday morning before church he wasn't waiting until he got to church and when he got to church he on fire already singing like this worshipping like this at home and it was a true testimony to us of the life he lived and what he stood and identified you know as brothers and and as friends and and family members and so i know a lot of us have so many things to say at this point i want to invite a friend of his brother andy henry to share with us a little bit in terms of his experience his relationship um as i invite brother andy henry to share share with us with us sorry goodnight brothers and sisters friends family members uh work colleagues um tonight is is somewhat bittersweet because we no longer have a uh a gem of our brother with us but at the same time tonight we could reflect on the life that he lived what he stood for and also the memories that we would have made together yeah so tonight i just want to touch on a few things that um that i remembered about jason first and foremost just as everybody said jason love the lord as could be seen by the way that you worship you see the video clips that we saw just now is not um [Music] is nothing different to what would have happened in church as brother also said he was one of the the loudest voices he would have heard in church many a time he would run up to the front and you know chair on on the wood and you do the brother i was preaching and all those things because he was excited about the things of god about god he was excited he was passionate about it and that is one thing that is very very uh how to say memorable about him that's something we always remember jason for if nothing else that's something always remember him for another thing is that jason was an um personal experience with him he is always willing to help anybody that he could there was a time that i had a uh a little court matter thing so i know just not one point that i used to work in the judiciary so call him up and say jason so so is the case boy where i could help middle because i forgot the court date i'm all kind of drama you say yeah man don't worry yourself i don't have a partner working there i'll just call them up and think i will find all that no problem so i said all right cool so it so happened that someday i was heading in that direction so i called him i said hey jason think thing thing give me the fella number call so we went on the road and we fell out shipping down the road and it ended up taking longer than ex expected so when you're coming back up now back into porter spain i say bye jason bye sorry to keep you so long like you say nah man nice small thing i'll just take a two hours launch then i think they're gonna understand you know yeah and it was no big deal for him you know he he was just cool and normal and i mean always willing to help however he could he he jason was someone that um is very passionate was very passionate about his family he loved his family his son his wife and he always uh work hard to provide for them and all these all these things you know which was very very um commemorable about him because is just as as if it was how can he find a right word right now but he had such a driver and such a passion for his family that as um bro blackman really said no oh oh somebody nothing could come in between him and his family you know you couldn't get in there at all at all because family was important to him and he made it a priority you know his family made his family a priority another thing to his jason just as everybody would you know is is so it's like everyone has these almost the same things to say about jesus because jason was the same way wherever he was jesus was a life at the party wherever he is i remember the first time we had um uh a brother's lime first one was at my home so him and joelle were the first persons to reach at the time so i said let me go inside and we go wait for them followers on them he said now we've done good out here sitting in the yard we cutting coconut are we drinking and you know jason was normal he made himself comfortable you know no no no no no kind of hustle or nobody and even self indy while everybody was there we was uh fellowshipping and all these things jason was always the life for the party is it was like it was like a a competition between him and and another brother it's like who could um you know make the most jokes and it was it was amazing you know and that was something that i would always remember even jason jason jason was something else and jason shared some stories with us where he um had some time he went to some some drag race and then police came and then jason just busts out and he has given me all the details and and i'm like jason you saw madman [Laughter] but you know he was he was saying you know just like just enjoying himself having fun and that kind of thing so jason i i don't know what to say with jason but all in all jason was always someone that you would love to be around he always lifted your spirits in some shape form or fashion no matter how yeah they go in how you feeling the the atmosphere that he brought it always change the atmosphere in the room uh on and and with the people that was around him at that time i could remember as well too that jason used to um used to do this this uh santa claus thing every christmas when my my full son andrew was smaller he um he tell me he told me say yeah i just do that thing just tell me and come down and i go organize them so i say all right no problem uh call them and say hey jason so so so is the case where is boy he said boy i'm price plaza today calm down so so so so time so all right no problem you went down and in in true jason jason form normally each child will get like one toy he end up giving away like three toys you know that kind of thing and then the other time he wherever the other branch that he was he said call me say hey andy i in this branch boy so so so so bring him down again now man we go we gotta link him up you know so that is that's how jason was jason was always trying to make out brighten somebody else's day however he could you know and even um he he um we had a youth service sometime a couple years ago in the tabernacle and but isaac was talking about praying and that sort of thing how you shouldn't be ashamed to pray and and and pretend you're on the phone and you're praying and that kind of so nobody wouldn't know so after isaac said that jason put up his hand he said well uh let me tell you something i just do that tonight when i walk and down from from portland spain going down the city gate i just pull out my phone and pretend like i talking on the phone by really praying you know and it was such a uproar and laughter in the in the youth service because you wouldn't really expect you synthesis nobody to say something like that and then jason just opened you know so i mean it was it was something he was always no matter the the forum he was always there he always you know bring in light or or or make any place light somehow it will in in the way that he would have you know interacted with everybody and that kind of thing so um i don't want to be too long i just i just want to extend my condolences to the family to his wife his son misha and pray that god will give you guys the strength and the the courage to go through this time it definitely will be missed uh not only in his family but also in his workplace the places he used to work in it is in church on all these things as well too but taking all things into consideration god knows best god knows what what is best so we just have to thank god that we were able to know him and to be part of of his life on this so god bless you all and have a good night this is my contribution tonight thank you very very much andy thanks for sharing again you know it it reminded me as he spoke that a few words that come to mind when you think of jason is ambitious jason was industrious hard working jesus was working all the time if you talk to jesus in in his short life he tells him that he might docks he pulled bull or with taxi he would just look magician caught with officer the pm he always was no matter what time you call him he always had something to do he heard him any worship say he won plant pancakes he always had a plan to do something but at the same time he was also a comedian this was natural innate he could have gone to hollywood and made millions in comedy because it was natural to him but he chose to direct the energy to christ and to church and to worship and the family and stuff and you know i'd also say he's one of the most willing persons i knew i remember there was i think was a wednesday night or so there was church and jason living right granny side the church we will see is grandy side and there were some believers i believe needed to go to porter spain or baratari or some place and jason after church decided for himself he going to drop them down no who would do that kind of thing who will think that kind of thing you're going to church here you're living right here and still going above and beyond to make sure deceived to make sure they get done i mean he really was a tremendous person a tremendous guy and a great friend at this point i want to introduce another good friend of his brother joel streicher good night everyone um deepest condolences that you asked for my family and his wife crystal um jason we are here tonight for real life that is their life with the life of one of our friend or precious brother jesus he always remain positive and courage and encourage everyone laughing and speaking with comfort happiness in the life of others a whenever he said spoke we spoke about two things when he came up with a family and he loved the lord i remember when he would look for some exams he told me that like that was hard but he prayed trust and god that will pass his exams no matter what we had had sometimes though know what brother jason loves to worship i know something i've been standing in front of um in front of you and somebody's might come with some gentlemen which achieved because you shall god hallelujah and thank you jesus you're going to know jesus i remember sometimes a wednesday night using all this a call and say um we're doing better when i come to church um even i think i want to stay in home by that call alone asking to get out of the church i remember sometime jason i decided to call jesus instead and he said you know what i'll go with you but i have to uncover someone he said that it's because people it's not going to become hard times i don't encourage them by bringing them to church they cannot present jesus uh we look at the church together we look at each other together i remember sometimes everything nice in jesus name i not only was a friend i lost my brother his mother real brother to me and i'm muslim daily good night thank you very very much joelle i think you speak for all of us when you say we lost a brother and a friend indeed at this time we want to invite another jason jason williams to share a few words on his behalf again i'm not seeing jason williams here at the moment i don't know if he's here with us well in that case we will move on to brother stephen candeli probably should be with us at this point jason is here yes okay well he could go ahead chase somebody else hey goodnight all uh greetings and the precious neos jesus christ are getting caught until this to the family of brothers um you know um here in the news it's it was really saddening for me you know very real sad i was on work on already news and just you know i just in that moment um that's just our song just come to my heart and um i dedicated just just two verses to brother jason from that song and um that song was um steal away still away steal away to jesus [Music] still away still are we oh [Music] i don't have long to stick [Music] and um i just i was just thinking about you know i was just reflecting my own life and realizing that you know like a short um you know one time you're here and one time here you're not here and um i actually spoke to jason just before i came to hook um just a week before i came to kamehameha junction and he was actually working taxi and i saw him in junction and say what what's happening man and you know we chatted briefly um we talked about you know the pandemic and you know we need to be careful on different things and he talked about how you're working on his fitness you know he shared um you know a good conversation you know give him some tips on different things in terms of herbs at a stake and you know we had a nice composition you know and no little did i know that would have been the last conversation with my precious brother you know and showing the sentiments of all was on the call one before but by the batman and the different ones sure and that's your personality about jason um you know he was very very happy happy jolly person and he always had that smile that you know that lit up the room lit up the whole atmosphere and change the atmosphere you can be feeling down and out and you know when you're talking to jason you know he he will he will change the whole mood you know he had that gift that where you know he will he will chat he will you know talk about any problems or issues and here we the conversation will go on and on and he was a real real genuine person um as brother says none weird none like jason you know um so he was a real inspiration to me in terms of the way he worshipped um he really would ship like no other you know and he had that really show that joyful noise really that shout that unique show that you know you know at the end of it comes deeply from his heart he wish it from the heart and that is the way to worship that is a true example of of worship and really dedication to god and i think that god will be pleased with with the kind of worship that that um brother jason gave you know um as a brother grown up in the same year in a generation growing up in church with brother jason and different ones um growing up to get into it we share building the church together we shared sports together we should brother fellowship together and you know with the the the memories as brother and he said was you know was really unique i mean you know it was good memories of of our dear brother in terms of he was always happy and he always remember jason was there you know um he had a lot of energy um he had a

evening everyone um [Music] um just again uh my deepest condolences today to the family the friends the well-wishers everyone here got it tonight um what what could i say about jason that you know wasn't already said um jason was if if i could describe when i was describing he just had a beautiful soul he was the most genuine person that i've ever met in my entire life everything everyone has said about jason so far is so true but it's like he's one of the few persons who were the same way with everybody but he wasn't changing it up for somebody else when he on work he act differently when he whom he died differently when he reached the church friends he act differently when he it was like that he was the same way right through he was so genuine and um over the past few years i just listened to some of these stories there that you know brother andy shared and gideon and jason and a few others and so on and then over the past few years i had the opportunity to to really get a lot closer to him and i'll be honest at first i felt real special i'm like wow this guy is so awesome i felt special to be his friend i felt i i i felt special that he was that close with me and then i looked around and i realize but he he good with that one he closed with this one he closed this one and angle i have a little sucker down a little jealousy i was like i told you just me and he was good so bye man i was good with everybody boy everybody and i wanna and and i wanna say something here and um and this is for joel joella i saw the love that jason had for you brother i saw that and because of that i began to look at it differently you know to see how you know you really care about you and so on i my appreciation for you jewel also write the brother you know so how he really look he will love you like a brother and um um you know um jason was he was you know such a special person i think he was he was the only person now are we being a liar she's used to coming to sleep a lot i live in right there but he was the only one who is like who is to make coming to just let seem okay it's okay as jesus you know because as soon as he come fire one time you might never have to walk up one time it's just like joel said earlier when um you know whatever he is all i had to listen to is that glory you know one time he was right behind me i didn't know i had glory i jumped so i was like hey you know that that was you know he was i i loved him to that man and um you know i remember the story he gave of how he met um crystal you know he how he met her i got i will tell you details okay i'm not to tell nobody so i will keep it like that but when he told me i cannot believe it's such a crazy and funny story it is absolutely that is as i was like there's only jason could do stuff like that you know and i remember when he first broadcast of the church and he and he put me and he pulled him aside and he said um he said stephen he said he pointed and he said that's my wife you know there wasn't marriage yet it wasn't even engaged yet he said that's my wife he said she don't know if you have to know but i have my wife you know and i mean not said right you know and um [Music] and seeing you know being there for him you know around him and so on when when his mom passed away and and seeing the strength that you know he he never got down you know he remained positive in the lord and he kept you know praising and worshiping during that time and then you know the tragedy of you know losing their son as well i looked at him during that time as well he just kept he just kept praising he kept worshiping that never detained boy i wanted to be like jason i wish i was more like him i told my wife i said i wish i was like he he just i mean what's what's what's who's got described you know how much he meant to me as a friend i remember earlier this year when i was a when i was really in a law place you know spiritually speaking and so on you know wasn't coming to church you know he just come and he just stood up in front of my house he just stood up you know no one no i just so he just did you know i was like who's that outside of jason and he just you know he he fellowship with me and i know we talk for hours i don't remember crystal keep calling and he keeps saying this and i always pass that to you calling again there's no and then but we were just you know and um [Music] he uh when he left i told the messages and i really appreciate the data because i say a little experience but i say well nobody called me nobody checked me he was there but that meant you know and he didn't come to you know talk about what you know i can't oh you know why you don't think that he just just came from fellowship just i've just been around him yeah there's no way you can be dogging out once you're wrong jason like his spirit his personality was so huge it was so large it was so powerful it was so radiant it was like a light a shining star in the midst of this dark but he stood out he stood out from the rest head and shoulders above everybody else he was truly a beautiful man and i and you know it hurts it hurt me a lot you know when i heard because you know i have this thing i just do know when i put something before the lord i just accept it i believe it and i move forward and i you know i just i just knew because i said jesus i said you told me in your word that if you asked for anything in my name you would do it you know but when i read the news i was i was heartbroken but then you know something came to me and said you know that god god is suffering god is suffering and uh we don't always understand it it doesn't mean that you know because you know we trust in him and we know that you know and he have a plan that it doesn't hurt it doesn't mean an adulthood but it does but um god is suffering and you know his will be done but if there's one thing given here that we had among the believers [Music] i turned to my wife and i said i said um i told her i said hey look i said i said god can take jesus i said that means he taking his best people off the job and i said when you're taking your best people of your job is that your wine and normally work or your finishing work i say that's what we're doing right now so you know that really shook me up to the point where i realized that i i know to jesus life was such a testimony but i am a person saying about how he worship his life was a worship his entire life was worshipped you know it wasn't like that's what i thought he wasn't changed he told me and i'm glad i'm glad to show the videos he told me he said stephen when i he said when i'm doing my thing i'd be shocked and think just like always in church he told me that long before and he started selling videos he said i didn't do nothing normal he said sometimes they don't like guitar but you know i just i i just speaks to the you know the character that he had and he and you know above it all as an amazing christian and person that he was he was still human you know we had many conversation of all a lot of mistakes and things he would have made in the past so you always make you feel like it was human just like christ even though christ was you know what and so on he was human but anyone jason jason felt that same way even though he was such an example to the young people and you know to me in particular and so on he was human but he was he wasn't a perfect man you know he made mistakes and things like that it was one thing i admired about him and i this is something that i definitely applied to my life he never let his mistakes pull him down sometimes we make mistakes and we pull onto that for years and oh lord are you feeling so guilty and we keep ashamed to go before the lord i think that was not jesus he never let his mistakes you know and and and so on held him back you know he was he was true to form he was a genuine he was a genuine christian and i i as much as i will miss him i know i i it's impossible for me to miss him as more modern his wife crystal and his son shark and so on so i and his anderson and his entire family so i just wanna just i could spend the rest of my life speaking about all the things you know that jason and i would have um discussed and you know all the plans i i was also i had my background speaking about it all the plans that he had when he you know applied to be part of the uh whether it was customs and build another one so much so many things you know and i heard one of you i wanted the president mentioned that oh he was such a supportive guy when i was selling insurance i came to jesus and jason bought insurance to me you know what he told me he says stephen shawn's already you know him i don't need but he said just because it's you i would buy i didn't buy once again he buy twice he didn't buy twice or no he bought three times just because it was me that's the kind of friend he was you know he just wanted to show support anything you're doing you just support and i mean i i i think a lot of stuff that i that i can speak about will kind of fall into line with what everyone else has said but i just want to encourage everyone not to um you know to to able to continue to show the family love and support you know not not just throughout this time but even beyond so many times we gotta we got other situations like this and after it's said and done we all disperse you know into different areas of our life but let us continue as a family as a community to show love and support you know to crystal and to me shack and to the entire family as much as we can let us not forget let's not forget them you know because i remember the prophet said he said if you love me you love a family and because i love jason i will always love his family you know so i want us to continue to show love and support and family for as long as they need it all right so thanks again everyone have a good night thank you very much for the steven at this time i'd like to invite a representative from the office of the prime minister i believe we have miss jack martin with us good night everyone i was here from inception i was trying to let you know that i was on a chinese because i was using my daughter's computer but i realized that i wasn't unmuted so i'm using my phone and i'm hoping that it doesn't fall good night everyone on behalf of the honorable minister ayanna webster roy the prominent secretary justin the baby silver two former pierces jacqueline johnson and ian ram dahin members of the staff of the gender fears division of the chart of the child affairs unit of the policy research and planning unit of the it unit of the hr unit of the procurement unit of the corporate communication unit of the accounts unit of the internal audit unit of the national aids coordinating unit the health and safety unit the registry and records management unit the legal services unit the citizens facilitation unit the corporate services division the project management unit the special advisor the shoppers the drivers the messengers the cleaners the shelters the shelter staff and the office of the prime minister we all express our deepest condolences to the wife and son of jason and all his other family members close relatives and friends words cannot express how deeply sudden we are by his passing you may be wondering why i choose to name all the different divisions why don't she just say the staff of opm i chose i chose to name the individual division simply because jason had made an impact in every division mentioned here tonight every member of staff of every unit and division mentioned here tonight will have been impacted by jason's presence if one is to give a true and honest description of jason it will be that he was a friendly warm delightful person to be around he had the type of personality that drew you to him one would not be angry with him for long he had the gift of chair and of charm he was indeed a charismatic person jason's journey with us began when he was appointed as an auditing assistant in the internal audit department in 2017. from the internal audit division his career catapulted to the administrative officer too in the general administration department in august 2018. then in february 2020 he was transferred to the general fleet division working with mr rajkumar was indeed a delight one of his major tasks in the division was to procure items such as school items for the government shelters basically to ensure that the needs of the shelters are met once he receives information a shelter needs a particular item mr rajkumar would ensure that the item is received it may not be immediately but they would get the items in cressi he always uses his charisma to get out of situations that causes your throne to turn to a smile he loved this job he would often call me if you see that i am not at my desk miss john martin i see you not here are you coming in today i have ps to sign for the shelter but if you are not coming in i could always leave it for tomorrow or i could bring it up by you to suck and let you sign it and i live in trinity and he didn't mind coming all the way from puerto ricity to bring those people for me to sign certain shelter needs could be met he said this is not a problem he always came up with a solution nothing was so difficult for jason he was helpful and often goes beyond the call of duty to assist we are all saddened by his by this lord and we share in your grief this news was a blow to me as it was for everyone in our midst jason would be remembered for who he was a caring loving cheerful individuals who touch the hearts of everyone with his charisma sleep on my colleague until we meet again thank you thank you very much it's chuck jack martin a representative from the office of the prime minister and it's very very clear the impact and profound impact he had on different divisions within the ministry itself at this point we want to invite brother isaac ovid to share with us this time god bless you and good evening to one and all i would like to take this time um to express condolences deep condolences to the family and um so the many people who are here friends family well-wishers um jason for my almost my entire life i can see i've known jason like many who have already spoken we are about this image and we also had a very unique relationship i want to thank everyone who already spoke and i want to take a note from brother stephen kangary who just spoke that it's not his way of making you one as an individual feel like you have that relationship with him you know so everyone could say he had a unique relationship with him you know um he was both a brother to me and a friend and in my portfolio at church i had the opportunity to serve him and to preach to him for many years you know and i could share something that truly that nobody would know because we see jason in his public you know display of worship and what you would see when he's you know shouts and screams in church but i could remember many times you know and particularly during the pandemic when we had to speak um virtually i would come off the pulpit and i would have a range of whatsapp messages that would have been taken place sometimes unbeknownst to me while these services going on so jason from our home would be whatsapping my phone while i'm preaching shouting amen and there was a particular time i had my phone on the pulpit and i was like i'm getting ready to close out and a whatsapp comes through don't close out and um um it's it's something else and that's that's how jason was so that part for me is truly unique and that jason truly felt you know that you know he could reach out and kind of communicate that in the in in this way you know so just for a few minutes just to share something um to kind of close uh this night out i just want to read one scripture and just speak for about five minutes or so and i want to take it from luke 4 verse 18 the bible says the spirit of the lord is upon me and this was jesus speaking because he had anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he had sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the lord may the lord have a blessing to the reading of his word and we'll pray after this for the family and i read this scripture because this was the opening declaration of jesus's ministry of his purpose of his objectives he would start off this way but at the end of jesus ministry he would begin to speak about him being the resurrection and the life but this introduction of jesus's ministry says because he had anointed me to preach the gospel and it was the gospel that connected to jason he had sent me to heal the brokenhearted and no doubt for many of us there is a level of brokenheartedness is a level of sadness and grief but as the bible said we sorrow not like they who have no hope because we have a hope to say that his passing was a shock to me would be an understatement to me it was completely unexpected i know jason he had many many plans it has been said many times tonight in this meeting he had many plans but god had another plan a master plan and this master plan not only involved jason but somehow it seems to have involved all of us because none of us knew we would be here tonight none of us planned to be here tonight none of us expected to be here tonight the life that jason lived the testimony of his life and the fact that we are all here tonight is by divine design speaking at any celebration of the life of someone is always challenging it is even more challenging when it is someone close to you and someone you actually connected with he will be greatly greatly missed but i'm comforted tonight that i will see my friend again i am comforted because i know what he believed i know what he stood for and i know what he desired i am comforted in the faith he had his love for the lord and his passion to worship god his was the kind of worship that came with a genuine understanding and revelation of worship often times i've taught the distinction between praise and worship when you read through the bible praise him for his mighty acts praise him for and you can read all the scriptures that speak about praise but worship is different worship has nothing to do with us worship has to do with who god is he is worthy of worship no matter what our current situation is he is worthy of worship no matter how we feel and that is what connected to jesus i cannot personally remember a service that jason was in that he was not shouting at the top of his lungs often time after service jason's voice is hoarse because he has given his all and giving his all was consistent with everything that he did and it has been mentioned and i want to reinforce it it is not that jason didn't have ups and downs he did we all do but he never ever let the challenges and issues of life separate him from his worship nothing could separate jason from his worship he could have the worst day and when we had when we were able to come on a wednesday night he would come to church and he would worship he would say isaac things are rough with me you know but he is worshiping when i first met crystal who would become his wife i marveled because i told myself it takes a special kind of woman to deal with a man with that kind of wishes i saw crystalline church one time and there's jason and you know there are times when there's one person standing in church shouting and this time it was just jason yeah at that particular point he was screaming at the top of his lungs and crystal was there as if this is just normal and i'm like my but it was it was not a show it was not our performance it was not him doing it to impress nobody or to come across in any kind of way he was genuinely a worshiper understanding who his god was understanding his expectation and many spoke about his desire to get into custody i remember he called me say isaac pray for me i have the exam tomorrow and i know if we all agree i could and that's the kind of person he was he wasn't even trying to go on his own ability you know so it was just genuine as a preacher whether jason was the kind of believer you wanted to preach to jason was known for many things it has been said tonight and what is amazing to me and it's so consistent because his ancestor angela said just look into the facebook messages jason was unashamedly a believer whether you were in church or outside the church everybody who know jason knew this statement everything nice in jesus name and if i had to give this thought a title i said the title should be everything nice in jesus name no matter what is going on everything nice in jesus name even when you don't feel like it everything nice in jesus name in this simple powerful statement there are many resounding truths the bible tells us that all things work together for good to them that love god and who are called according to his purpose it didn't say some things they say all things all things equals everything so when jason would make his statement everything nice in jesus name he was capturing in that one statement the grand magnitude of god to be able to take situations that we cannot understand and make sense out of it even when he does it in his own time beyond our ability in this exact moment to figure it out everything nice in jesus name the bible says to be absent from the body is to be present with the lord jason has left this house of flesh and has accepted his heavenly promotion my grief was tempered by the thought of jason joining the heavenly chorus and if the jason we see worshiping in church where to be part of that great heavenly host shouting i am assured that jesus is part of the front line they would have had to make room and welcome him gladly to join the chorus of those who are singing holy holy worthy wordy is the lord god almighty in the fatigue anxiety and stresses of life that have only been amplified by the last two years if ever there was a time to be certain of god is now there is a popular statement today you only live once young people love to say if you only live once this is a lie there's nothing wrong in trying to enjoy life because as his aunt said he enjoyed life he enjoyed good food he loved to travel but thought and consideration must be given to the life after this the thought and consideration of this reality is what led jason to not only serve the lord but to serve the lord the way that he did he was not always a hundred percent in church he struggled but as he fought his way back and what blew my mind in particular during these last two years of the pandemic when we were locked down and unable to meet in the way we we were able to jason would be on the stream and is the first time i've ever seen someone actually find the emojis to amplify use a speaker emoji because saying hallelujah was not enough saying amen was nothing love he would use four speakers as emojis and then hallelujah so to let you know that it's not just hallelujah but it's the amplified shouting hallelujah and you know when jason in church physically or virtually and one time i recognized i said i have not seen jesus name and i didn't see him these same speakers and hallelujah under a different name i say hey daisy he was another device but it was so consistent his speaker speaker speaker and the hallelujah glory that was him at that point in time it really as others have said resonated how real he really was because in the virtual environment when people didn't have to come to church and you have nobody to show that you're shouting and you're jumping he had a choice to sit back he had a choice to act he had a choice to worship and god help him he did he was a believer he believed in a rapture he believed in the resurrection he believed in getting your heart right with god as a minister of the gospel i knew certain services that he would respond to a certain way because in his heart in his deep heart he desired perfection he desired adoption he desired the holy ghost he desired a holy sinless life it was it resonated with him and that is not something that he could have put there is something that god put in his heart that he was just responding to the word he saw his name the mystery of who he was he knew he was more than just an existence on this earth he knew he was a creature from eternity trapped in time and he has just returned from his origin everything nice in jesus name all is well all will be well everything nice in jesus name that statement everything nice in jesus name it is well with my soul it's the same thing and i believe tonight all is well with his soul i always say when i'm given the opportunity to speak at services such as these i am not worried about brother jason tonight my worry is not for him tonight these moments these opportunities pause and cause us to reflect on us because i want to see my friend again and now as brother stephen kangali said when god takes some of his best men of the scene it is for the rest of us who are here to step up to finish this great work because we have a great commission and we have responsibilities to make a church that will bring a revival to come to perfection to bring on the resurrection jason has joined all the believers who have gone before who are waiting for us to come into our position in god also we shall not all sleep but we who are alive and remain will be caught up with them who have gone before so jason has joined those who are waiting on us we have a responsibility tonight and the question remains and the question will always remain are you ready in closing for me in particular jason was an especially a real shock because as well jason williams said and everyone say it's it's a different generation we consider ourselves a young people and that is what made it resonate because it brought a stark reality that god is the boss he is in control he is sovereign he can do what he wants to do and each of us on a daily basis have to be in a position to give an account it's easy to get caught up in the hustle and bustle on his life and he struggled and he listened and the news and he and it's a lot going on it's a lot of voices but we have to be reminded if it's anything about jason we hold tonight is he knew how to draw that line of separation between his work between his family and maintenance walk with god he did not let anything compromise his walk with god the reckless abandon with which he worshipped god was not somebody who was thinking about his mortgage tomorrow or what have to happen in work tomorrow or this or that situation when he was in church he was a hundred percent present as but as stephen said it's an inspiration to us it's an encouragement to us to give one thousand percent because whatever but jason did he did it all he gave his all and that is what he leaves with me to give all and to take that statement everything nice in jesus name to make us relook at situations which will be forced to confront situations we cannot control situations we have no influence over and to look at these things with a positive perspective just like jesus would say through the scripture let the weak say i am strong it is looking at situations you may not have control over or when things go wrong and still having a positive outlook god help us to be more positive even in this situation to see the positive that god wants us to see who would expect over 200 people in a zoom room tonight but jason is doing in his passing and in his promotion he is having an impact of all all of our lives to reflect so at this time before brother anthony comes to sing let's just bow our heads as we pray for the family pray for one another oh gracious heavenly father lord you are god you are king of kings you are lord of lords you are the great i am you put man in the garden of eden in genesis 1 as a spirit man and in genesis 2 you pick the dust of the earth and place that spirit man in that dust man and that man became a living soul lord you created us from your thoughts and your thinking and lord god in this world that we are in lord is just a passing light that flashes before we are snapped back into into your presence lord but just as heaven is real and just as lord being in your presence is real there's a reality lord of another place there's also darkness there's also the consequence of sin for those who have not made things right we thank you

children lord the family the church the friends and may you bless lord each one in a special way we thank you for the life of our brother jason there will be so much more to be said lord but father we
