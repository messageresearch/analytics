[13:51] they are I'll minister to them
[13:52] immediately needed and Lord may you
[13:55] through the word make an entrance for us
[13:57] in a child a prayer tonight in Jesus
[13:59] might ask that amen God bless you and
[14:03] thanks again for being here
[14:05] I wanted to look at two scriptures
[14:07] tonight Mark 11 verse 22-26 and also
[14:12] Luke chapter 22
[14:13] verse 32
[14:15] the 31-32
[14:18] and um
[14:20] Mark 11 read verse 22. and Jesus
[14:24] answered saith unto them
[14:26] have faith in God this is after Jesus
[14:29] Christ the fig tree and it dried up from
[14:32] the roots
[14:33] for verily I send to you
[14:35] that whosoever shall see unto this
[14:37] mountain
[14:38] be thou removed
[14:40] without casting to the scene
[14:43] and shall not doubt in his heart which I
[14:45] believe that those things which he said
[14:47] shall come to pass
[14:49] he shall have whatever he said
[14:51] therefore I see unto you what things
[14:55] however you desire
[14:57] When you pray
[14:58] believe that you receive them
[15:01] and he shall have them
[15:03] when you stand praying forgive
[15:06] if you have ought against any that your
[15:09] father also which is heaven May forgive
[15:11] you your trespasses
[15:12] but if you do not forgive neither will
[15:15] your father which in heaven forgive your
[15:18] trespasses
[15:19] Luke chapter 22
[15:21] reinvoice to table
[15:25] and the Lord said Simon
[15:28] Simon behold Satan had desire to have
[15:31] you that he may sift you as wheat
[15:35] what I have prayed for thee that I fit
[15:40] feel not and when thou art converted
[15:43] strengthened Divergent may God bless his
[15:46] word
[15:47] it's a blessing to be here tonight
[15:49] and I'm thrilled with what I see the
[15:53] Lord is doing
[15:54] and how the world has been unfolded to
[15:56] us
[15:57] no
[15:59] I have a thought about my heart tonight
[16:02] and it's believe you receive them
[16:05] and you shall have them I want to zoom
[16:08] in on verse 24 of Saint Mark 11.
[16:12] therefore I see unto you what things so
[16:15] ever you desire
[16:17] When you pray believe you receive them
[16:21] and he shall have them so this
[16:23] particular verse is where I want to zoom
[16:27] in tonight
[16:28] whatsoever things what things whatever
[16:31] you desire
[16:33] When you pray believe that you receive
[16:36] them
[16:37] and it shall happen
[16:39] you know we know 25 and 26 is like a sub
[16:43] close
[16:44] or like a fine print
[16:47] of the power of praying
[16:49] in other words you're wasting your time
[16:52] praying if ever ought
[16:54] you have a grudge you wasting a time
[16:57] just in words
[16:58] no we could see prayers we could say
[17:01] words but we're talking about
[17:05] praying or real effective prayer which I
[17:09] want to show you tonight prayer
[17:12] push his feet to go on by the words you
[17:15] use by what you see
[17:18] it actually pushes fit to God
[17:22] IT projects Faith to God that's what
[17:25] prayed us so when you're praying he said
[17:28] oh you listen to the words and vain
[17:30] words and whatnot no you want to know
[17:33] who you're praying to because people do
[17:34] that they have those with beads with
[17:37] citizens over and over will be sharp
[17:39] please and there's people who are prayer
[17:41] books there are people who have daily
[17:43] prayer and daily word and whatever it is
[17:45] and that is just seeing stuff that's not
[17:47] praying no listen to this now
[17:51] God can move mountains
[17:54] but fit
[17:55] moves God
[17:58] can heal any condition
[18:01] but fit
[18:03] moves God to heal
[18:05] God can deliver
[18:07] but Faith moves God to bring that
[18:11] Deliverance
[18:13] believe
[18:15] you have received them
[18:17] and you shall have them
[18:19] now I discovered this word it's called
[18:22] appropriation or to appropriate
[18:24] the correct appropriation of faith
[18:28] and the appropriate
[18:31] is to take something for one's own use
[18:35] and I like this definition appropriate
[18:37] to take
[18:39] something
[18:40] for one's own use
[18:42] because it separates you as an
[18:45] individual
[18:47] and it clarifies why Jesus Jesus told
[18:51] his disciples it wasn't one of them or
[18:53] two of them there's a bunch of them if
[18:55] you shall see
[18:57] to the mountain the moon you
[19:00] personal responsibility
[19:03] personal fit personal world so to
[19:06] appropriate is to take something for
[19:08] one's own use
[19:10] it is to take possession of
[19:14] it is to take over
[19:16] it is to assume
[19:18] it is to lay claim to
[19:22] it is to clean
[19:24] so when he says when you pray
[19:28] believe you have received
[19:31] you appropriate and receiving it before
[19:34] you even get it you are saying I claim
[19:37] it you are saying it is Minds personally
[19:40] you are not identifying a general
[19:43] something you are seeing this healing
[19:46] that I'm looking for it's mines and I
[19:48] claim it I appropriate it on my feet I
[19:51] use this part of what I unbelievable
[19:52] what I'm standing for I'm holding on to
[19:54] it do you get it tonight
[19:57] now Jesus
[20:01] in talking to Peter
[20:04] it's important to note
[20:07] that he told Peter the devil want to say
[20:09] for like wheat
[20:11] but I've prayed for thee what was Jesus
[20:14] pray
[20:15] that thy fit feel not note
[20:20] he didn't pray for Peter's Deliverance
[20:23] because Faith moves God that can deliver
[20:26] he preached for Peter's feet
[20:30] and
[20:31] feet
[20:33] is the foundation of the Christian walk
[20:36] and your prayer
[20:38] reveals what your faith has appropriated
[20:42] or what you take possession of or what
[20:44] you take as your own
[20:47] all that you are the prophet said
[20:50] all that you ever will be is based on
[20:53] fit
[20:55] in the wood
[20:57] All That You Are
[20:59] all that you ever will be is based upon
[21:01] fate in this world
[21:02] therefore guard your feet
[21:06] and if you guard your feet
[21:08] you would shun unbelief
[21:11] you would shun people that are want to
[21:14] bring negatives and stuff because you
[21:17] want to protect your feet you would
[21:19] avoid the odds and the issues and other
[21:22] people because you want to guard that
[21:24] feat okay
[21:27] now I want to run through something
[21:29] quickly I will see how the law will do
[21:31] this now
[21:33] no there was a guy but if I'm describe
[21:35] it I don't know the man never seen in my
[21:38] life a man come to me and told me you
[21:40] wanted me to pray for him that will be
[21:42] healed of prostrate trouble
[21:44] and he said I was here once he said he
[21:46] told me the story I was set in a meeting
[21:48] way back in the balcony it was Mr
[21:51] Brandon's meeting all at once listening
[21:54] to this I begin to feel a strange
[21:55] feeling come over me and said then the
[21:59] man turned around from where he was
[22:00] preaching and said the man sitting up
[22:02] there so and so a certain man from a
[22:04] certain place and said he's praying that
[22:06] he will be healed or prostrate trouble
[22:07] and he said if he will only accept it
[22:10] and believe it now he can go home and be
[22:14] well he said something struck me I never
[22:17] felt anything like it in my life
[22:19] and for a solid Year my prostrate never
[22:23] bothered me
[22:24] and it come on me again
[22:28] the man name I guess the money was Mr
[22:30] Church the money was church so Mr Church
[22:32] said then don't you see that show that
[22:35] Mr Brown is false if God heal a man
[22:38] he'll heal him for life I thought Mr
[22:40] Church how many times have you come up
[22:42] on the Silver Hills come around and get
[22:44] all those Nursery Sanctified this year
[22:46] I'm next to you sanctify another bunch
[22:48] of them maybe they didn't have it to
[22:50] begin with God wouldn't be real see
[22:53] said this and Church believe us I want
[22:56] to get this to me
[22:58] Divine Healing
[23:00] and sanctification
[23:02] and the powers of God
[23:05] is as long as your faith lasts in it
[23:10] when your faith feels
[23:13] when your experience is gone
[23:16] it is based that way simply upon the
[23:20] finished works of Christ at Calgary
[23:23] you are sanctified
[23:25] as long as your testimony is right as
[23:28] long as you live a Sanctified life and
[23:30] believe that God sanctify you you are
[23:32] sanctified continent all to his grief on
[23:34] his merits as long as you accept healing
[23:37] and believe your healing and go and
[23:39] believe in it like that you'll be healed
[23:41] as long as you believe it
[23:45] you start doubting it you take a mind
[23:47] sitting here this morning that's not a
[23:49] bit sick let him begin to get his heart
[23:51] believing he's sick then pack him out
[23:53] the building
[23:54] as your faith is
[23:56] so be it unto you that is not Christian
[24:00] Science I am not meaning mind over
[24:03] matter but you see the thing of it is is
[24:06] the atmosphere that you live in
[24:08] okay let's go
[24:10] there's another one
[24:11] I might say to this audience this
[24:13] afternoon
[24:14] how many is Christians perhaps 95 or
[24:18] maybe 100 hands their questions as long
[24:22] as you believe that
[24:24] all right
[24:25] but the minute that you begin to think
[24:27] that you're not
[24:29] that's the time you start thinking right
[24:33] here
[24:34] that's the time your testimony is
[24:37] negative
[24:38] Divine Healing
[24:40] last just as long as your faith lasts
[24:44] with it
[24:45] your salvation is the same everything of
[24:49] God Is by feet
[24:50] and nothing of God
[24:53] can be proven by natural
[24:57] so we are challenging tonight
[24:59] challenging you tonight to believe what
[25:02] you can't prove just just think about it
[25:05] you are believing
[25:07] what you can't prove that God is and
[25:11] that he is a rewarder of them that
[25:13] diligently seek it
[25:15] let's go
[25:16] now he said Abraham
[25:19] could possess that land because God give
[25:22] it to him
[25:23] you know lot was part of that land so
[25:25] Abraham had a right to it he could call
[25:27] or lay hold of it
[25:29] so he is showing how Abram could
[25:31] appropriate his faith correctly like how
[25:33] I want you to appropriate fit to move
[25:36] God tonight correctly you want to be
[25:39] healed you have to move God what's the
[25:41] currency that moves God or what's what's
[25:44] what's the the connection that
[25:47] influences God it's fit
[25:50] faith not so long in the message not how
[25:52] old you are no not how long you are as a
[25:55] believer somebody could come in
[25:57] yesterday day before and because of
[25:59] their faith they get whatever God
[26:02] promised
[26:03] okay so watch this now even better write
[26:06] it you could lay he could call or lay
[26:09] hold of it he said no God you may be the
[26:12] promise and what was this land and all
[26:15] and it was mine give me the promise I
[26:17] know my Kingsman has been taken and all
[26:19] he's got is gone in other words if I
[26:22] apply today I would say Church could see
[26:24] could say and we could pray Lord God
[26:27] here's my brother he's laying here
[26:29] strictly with cancer he's tricking with
[26:32] tuberculosis he's got so and so I lay
[26:35] all of the promise it's my possession
[26:39] do you see how he is showing and
[26:42] revealing here how to appropriate feet
[26:45] correctly you're not open now you're
[26:48] actually doing some cleaning here I
[26:50] layer all of the promise it is my
[26:53] possession you told me so amen there you
[26:56] are then you can go after that enemy the
[26:59] devil and Slaughter it just as Abraham
[27:01] slaughtered the Kings and brought back
[27:03] his possession yet Abraham had a right
[27:05] to the promise and the promise was his
[27:07] yet he had to fight to possess it here
[27:11] you are the believer today we're heir to
[27:14] all things we're here to every spiritual
[27:16] blessing every physical blessing every
[27:19] blessing the bible promises yet you have
[27:21] to fight every inch for it that is the
[27:26] way God's got it set up it's always been
[27:29] that way you have to fight to possess
[27:32] what you know is your own you have to
[27:36] fight to possess it and that's what we
[27:38] have to do now you see brother Brandon I
[27:42] need healing the promise is yours but if
[27:45] you ever get it you ain't gonna get it
[27:46] easy I'm going to tell you that you're
[27:49] going to have to take it away from Satan
[27:51] Satan captures your health you have got
[27:54] a right to go and say give it back hand
[27:57] it over I come in the name of the Lord
[27:59] the possess of everyone of it I'm his
[28:01] Heir give it back you took my child you
[28:04] gotta mix up with the wrong boy you took
[28:06] my boy mix up with the wrong girl I
[28:08] claim that you see so this is
[28:11] appropriation I claim them I claim my
[28:15] children I claim my brother I claim my
[28:19] sister I hope you could see how you're
[28:21] going to be praying tonight I hope you
[28:23] get appropriate things of the promises
[28:25] of God tonight I hope you can make real
[28:27] claims tonight yes Satan took them from
[28:30] the God's house and Cooks them out there
[28:33] but I'm coming after them I claim them
[28:36] well how you know I'm here of all things
[28:38] it's given to me I'm here I and clean
[28:42] everything that God promised me there
[28:44] you are it's mines how do you get it
[28:46] something you've done no no sir is the
[28:50] unmerited gift that God gave us so let's
[28:52] say somebody backs in vaccine for years
[28:54] they came to the Lord two months ago one
[28:56] month ago this year tonight applies to
[28:59] them they have claims now what the devil
[29:03] will do you've got to say nothing you'll
[29:05] face you have you but faith is
[29:07] unconscious things never want to say
[29:09] well you know you back sitting you you
[29:11] can't move so fast you can't meet them
[29:13] kind of claims yet you know you have to
[29:15] wait a while why is the devil trying to
[29:17] mess with your mind but guard your feet
[29:19] tonight watch it is mine how do you get
[29:23] it something you have done no sir it's
[29:26] the unmerited gift that God gave us it's
[29:28] ours it belongs to us see them cannot
[29:31] hold it if you go to him in the
[29:34] scriptural authoritative word with fit
[29:37] to see in his Minds lay it down Glory
[29:40] say I like that Satan you lay it down
[29:43] you took it from me you give it back I'm
[29:45] serving notice almost done
[29:49] in the message persevere in Chicago
[29:50] second
[29:52] of August 96 extreme
[29:55] he was talking about the word
[29:56] perseverance meet at the persistence and
[29:58] so on and before you can be persistent
[30:00] you have to have faith in what you're
[30:01] trying to achieve and listen to this
[30:04] part and you say no that little would
[30:06] fit means so much
[30:08] and yet we strike it so lightly
[30:12] I hear so many people coming it's
[30:15] amazing see I've got faith I'm not
[30:17] disregarding the effort but you know
[30:19] sometimes those that clean they have so
[30:22] much fit I find has less than those that
[30:24] say nothing about it they are built up
[30:27] to an emotion but not a real fit these
[30:30] are quite a bit different and I hope and
[30:33] what I hope an emotion with hope that
[30:37] being quiet and using Faith see faith is
[30:40] something
[30:41] it's a substance
[30:43] it is not something that you just jump
[30:46] up and haphazardly it at and hope so it
[30:49] is something that you know here we go it
[30:52] is something that you know you have it
[30:55] the thing that you're asking for
[30:59] there is no human way of ever explaining
[31:02] how you're going to get it but you know
[31:05] it is dear you have it it's a substance
[31:08] now if I could get that so that you
[31:13] could understand clearly it would mean
[31:14] so much to the meeting tonight
[31:16] in this night of this healing sins and
[31:19] we are trusting I say healing because I
[31:21] believe that God is going to do it I
[31:24] believe that God is going to do what he
[31:27] promised to do and if I didn't do that
[31:29] I'd be afraid to stand here in this
[31:31] audience that people I'll make these
[31:32] statements that I do make because I had
[31:34] a least bit of fear about it I never
[31:36] emitted that door here we go now
[31:39] you have got to absolutely believe it
[31:43] and you have the Assurance there is
[31:47] nothing can move it no matter what
[31:49] happens you still believe it even though
[31:51] it seemed like it failed you still
[31:53] believe it no matter what happens you
[31:56] still believe it there we go as we close
[32:00] state
[32:01] isn't something
[32:03] that somebody else is trying to get you
[32:05] to do this is beautiful I just look that
[32:08] sleeping alone it's a Powerhouse
[32:11] so you see how appropriation is personal
[32:15] is to take something for one's own use
[32:21] so faith isn't something
[32:24] that somebody else is trying to get you
[32:27] to do
[32:28] it is something God commissioned you to
[32:31] do see see you know I see the lady she's
[32:36] very sick but Intoxicated by drug trying
[32:39] to get well Dr Giver I seen her sit and
[32:43] laugh and rejoicing
[32:44] and what's the use of me going down
[32:46] there after it's already over see
[32:49] someone say but Mr way would have he
[32:52] would have he would have laid there he
[32:55] would have do this but when the woman
[32:57] was back outside yet the vision come
[33:00] she is sitting here tonight fine
[33:03] laughing last night you see
[33:06] you have got to know
[33:09] there we go and you cannot know until
[33:12] you are fit
[33:13] and faith
[33:15] produces the new soul
[33:19] faith is that no
[33:22] faith is a thing that sees it
[33:26] for example
[33:28] tonight
[33:29] fit speaks to you but this is a special
[33:32] night
[33:33] your prayer will be different tonight
[33:36] because fit declares it to be so I am
[33:38] believing that you're going to reach
[33:40] deeper further higher in God by your
[33:45] feet tonight as you realize Faith Swiss
[33:49] God or move God remember
[33:51] the woman with the dead baby in Mexico
[33:54] and Usher was trying to calm Adam and
[33:56] she was passing through their legs and
[33:58] everything else and were around Mark
[33:59] somebody one pray for because you don't
[34:00] know who he is and she push and press
[34:04] her faith went up to God God touched the
[34:07] prophet gave him a vision see the baby
[34:09] smiling she'll let her come
[34:12] what did they do there Faith took that
[34:14] woman from the back and bring her to the
[34:16] front her feet
[34:19] a Mexican woman
[34:21] Catholic most likely wasn't a baptized
[34:24] believer or Saint a God but her feet hit
[34:28] him
[34:29] have him touch his Prophet his Prophet
[34:31] had to pray
[34:32] all of that is in the program and plan
[34:35] of God
[34:36] and the final quote I have tonight as we
[34:38] pray is this talking about the associate
[34:40] Revival
[34:41] is starting the Pentecostal mission in
[34:43] California all Azusa Street he was
[34:45] laughed at with the Negro he was made
[34:47] fun of but he brought a message for that
[34:49] age just a boy a fellow could have this
[34:52] on his own name but the Lord had
[34:54] revealed to him that's it right there
[34:57] reveal to him that this was the age for
[35:01] the restoration of those gifts and they
[35:03] come no matter what said it come and
[35:07] everybody got in the atmosphere of it
[35:09] and seemed was that age and seen God
[35:11] Vindicated and those people could speak
[35:12] in tongue so forth and it happened
[35:15] it happened
[35:17] so tonight
[35:20] with the revelation of Dynamics
[35:22] but the revelation of virtue of officers
[35:25] where the revelation of your Pawn of the
[35:27] spirit to bring forth you as a seed
[35:31] you could pray with confidence tonight
[35:33] knowing that the water of the Holy Ghost
[35:37] is going to come upon you and governor
[35:40] and the last thing I want to close up
[35:42] with tonight is that the Holy Ghost
[35:44] is poured out on individuals
[35:47] so you could be your host tonight at
[35:50] individual
[35:51] and the Holy Ghost pours out upon you
[35:54] less bald heads heavenly father I thank
[35:57] you tonight I believe that this is a
[35:59] word and season and I bless you lord
[36:01] it's just this evening that I was able
[36:03] to get these things
[36:05] and I never saw the appropriation the
[36:07] way it came Lord and I've seen it right
[36:10] now all we pray is an expression of the
[36:14] faith that we have and the confidence
[36:17] and trust that you have in you and you
[36:20] said Jesus when you pray believe you
[36:23] have received and you shall receive it's
[36:27] a claiming it's an appropriation it's
[36:30] attributing is already done it is saying
[36:33] it's a finished work it is singing my
[36:36] family's already delivered it's a saying
[36:38] I'm Healed Oh Glory to God it's a saying
[36:41] I'm sealed I'm I'm filled with the Holy
[36:43] Ghost I'm baptized I'm claim it I claim
[36:46] it tonight mighty movement of the Holy
[36:48] Spirit upon my life just as
[36:50] sanctification has to be held up by feet
[36:52] just as justification I shall be held up
[36:54] by faith the Holy Ghost has to be held
[36:56] up by faith every stage of this journey
[36:59] must be a walk of faith we walk by faith
[37:02] at night and not by sight father as the
[37:04] people go wrong in prayer with the
[37:06] anointed come down in a special way give
[37:08] them the anointed give them the unction
[37:11] to cry out unto you for this revival the
[37:13] crafting to you for this promised seal
[37:16] of the Living God the craft unto you for
[37:18] the Holy Ghost on Fire I claim it for
[37:20] them Father I claim the fire of the Holy
[37:22] Ghost will touch every heart every mind
[37:25] every soul may the church be Sanctified
[37:27] by the power of God but it's just been
[37:29] cleaned up from the pulpit to the back
[37:30] bench granted father in Jesus might ask
[37:33] it amen amen God bless you thanks again
[37:36] for being here get on in prayer and
[37:38] believe you have received
[37:41] and you shall receive God bless together
