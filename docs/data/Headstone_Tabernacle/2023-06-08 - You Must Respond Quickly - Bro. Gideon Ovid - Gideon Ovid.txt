thoughts it's not by our ideas or how we think we could figure it out but by his Spirit by his power by his promise amen amen praise the Lord he is so wonderful you know sometimes we can't explain it but I discovered something and I'm sure we all know it you know it's not your job to explain it it's not our job to figure it out he is in charge his thoughts are not our thoughts sometimes if we try to figure it out it may sound foolish to us but it's his Brilliance it is wisdom amen amen don't mind me I'm just seeking to get a little more comfortable I always say it's it's it's it's something

all the praise and all the worship and Lord we will leave this place knowing it was good to have been here Lord what we would hear what we will see Lord what what will be open to us Lord I pray that you have your perfect will in and through everything that will take place in Jesus name we pray amen amen you love the Lord tonight if you have your Bibles I'd like to tune to a very very short scripture I just want to use that scripture as a context and then we'll expand in a little bit too man and the scripture comes from second Kings chapter 2 just verse 9. second Kings chapter 2. verse 9. and this this scripture speaks of Elijah and Elisha and in verse 9 you could say man if you found it in verse 9 of chapter 2 of Second Kings it says and it came to pass when they were gone over that Elijah said unto Elisha ask what I shall do for thee before I be taken away from thee and Elisha said I pray thee let a double portion of thy Spirit be upon me may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated like I always say I'm not here to to speak my thoughts and my ideas but I'm here to share the word and this is what the Lord has placed upon my heart and this is what I'm going to share so for a title title tonight is you must respond quickly amen you must respond quickly that's what we've challenged to do that's what we've called upon to do to be able to respond quickly and find inspiration I said under expectation for God to speak amen so just uh to paint a picture or as a backdrop I want you to do a simple exercise with me we're just going to try to figure something out together amen and within the scripture I just want to say Time After Time we have seen God speak in various ways you've given instructions he's reproached folks he's you know he's dealt with people in a particular way but as I studied some of the scriptures I realized it was so important that you respond quickly and the reason we read that scripture in case we missed it is that Elijah and Elijah were walking together for a while there was no a modern occurrence they were moving together and they moved from place to place and as the scripture highlights it here there came a point which is in verse 9 that we read it says and it came to pass when they were gone over that Elijah said unto Elisha who was with him all the time he said you know this this was his movement this was his time this is the point in which a season had changed and he says ask what I shall do for thee before I be taken away from thee because both you and everybody else know that I'll be taken away so this is your moment this is your time where I'm going to ask this is where you're gonna get the opportunity can you just imagine for a second if Elisha wasn't ready for that question the question is presented to you what would you like what would you like to see before I go and he looks at him stunned because he had never thought about it before he was awaiting to hear a word from the Lord but he never thought about it before can you imagine how different the scripture would have been but here he was prepared and he said I pray thee let a double portion of thy Spirit be upon me he was ready to respond almost immediately he knew exactly what he wanted and he was able to articulate it amen so that's the direction I'm going but I want us to go back a little bit I want you to work with me so we can establish a premise almost like in a classroom the premise I want to establish is that often times as Christians we try to figure things out you know we believe we get bright we read the scriptures twice and we say you know what I could figure it out so I want you to help me to explain a few things how do we explain Moses move in with over 2 million persons reaching up to the Red Sea and the Red Sea opening up on the Walking on dry land explain that to me how do we explain that I believe there is no way if I were to present this scenario to you there's no way you will come up with that being the solution in our finite Minds we can't see that being the answer but you know what God had that as the answer so Noah without an engineering degree without studying the oceans and and how to Traverse I mean imagine they built Titanic and they had the best of the best the best Craftsman the best material and it still failed but Noah would have taken go forward and Pitch it in and out and was able to survive a 40-day June day and night in a flood how do we explain that I want us to figure out together how Elisha could be elevated in a chariot of Fire how is that possible how Enoch was walking with God and and his testimony is that he pleased God and he was not he was found not amen how Joshua would have been instructed and given instructions to walk around the walls of Jericho once buddy and then seven times and he said when I bid you to shout and the walls thick enough for chariots to right or wrong came crumbling down how do we figure that out and I'm going somewhere with this how Samson a little guy brother Branham said he was almost sissified he was so small he was so simple yet he had Supernatural strength to lift up a gate and and to fight lions and stuff a show a bone of a donkey right how is that possible how Gideon fight with 300 men and and I use the word fighting Loosely there because he had lights and pictures and the enemy killed themselves fought each other how is that possible how do we explain the miracles of Jesus there's too much to mention so I'll just leave it as the miracles of Jesus how could we explain Peter walking on water how do we explain that but you know what that was an answer that God had predestinated to happen so we can't figure it out we can say you know what and what will happen because he kind of close to God he will walk on water no we can't figure that part out but it doesn't change the fact that that was the solution that God had how come Daniel was able to stand in a den of lions that were hungry and not be eaten how did Paul and Silas Brothers with such a remarkable duet singing at midnight and the prison bars she can open up and even the the prison officers outside realize listen we can't explain what's going on how do we figure out that out and the last one I have here is brother branham's Ministry it's too much to mention but how do we figure out that Elijah the reason I mention all that is because I came to a conclusion when I analyzed all of this and more is that I figured it out shocking it and what I figured is that it's not our purpose to figure it out it's not our objective and our goal it's not our mission God didn't predestinate that big sit down and try to figure out his next move that's not our responsibility that's not our rule I'll tell you your rule your rule is to respond quickly you see when he calls you have to answer you can't hesitate you can't deliberate I have news for you God is Not Looking for debaters he not looking for for people who could say well you know what here what if we approach it this way perhaps I know God said it will rain but what I think you really mean is that he usually as an acronym for something no he's not looking for that he's looking for people who could stand on his word no that's the promise that he laid out there and they could come and put things in place just the way he expected they do have to figure it out so we don't have to figure it out tonight we don't have to figure out the word of God the word is perfect we don't have to add a word you don't have to take away we don't have to do anything we just have to be obedient to the word of God and when he called me respond and respond quickly you see I've seen through the scripture time after time that God will give instructions he will say particular things and if you stay too long if you delay if you try to debate and try to figure it out yourself and your you know what I feel we better have a meeting and and let's let's have a vote let's see where where this goes you know you know he goes to God not laid back and like this and he just anything is everything no listen God is a very deliberate God very precise if he say come he won't you come if he say go he wants you go he don't want you I want to consult with my family a little bit if we could think about it give me two nights and I'll come back with a response no and I have examples like the young people say I have receipts I have proof I know exactly what I'm referring to you see I referenced Joshua earlier and there's something significant about Joshua and I'll read it for you there's a message as I was with Moses so I will be with thee and when brother Branham spoke that you know what he says about Joshua you say I want you to notice what's taking place Joshua when he come to his first campaign his first time to prove he was the real Joshua so before this he was untested uncharted waters everybody know yeah that's Joshua know but who really is Joshua so when it came time for him to prove that he was really the real Joshua you say Israel ought to have known that they were supposed to know but not everybody knew no doubt the clergy had a different idea they said now we'll just come here until spring time until summer time the Jordan will go down you know what I'm speaking about now they had an opportunity where they say they have to cross over but they drawed must High it was full it was muddy it was murky and we'll read it here and look like God throws some of the most foolish things in front of a spiritual Joshua brought him there in the month of April when the Jordan was three or four times its size so three or four times it's regular size that's when he brought him said he was trying him to see if he was really if he really was Joshua and paragraph 78 says let everything go wrong you see the point when you can't forget out it seemed impossible it seemed like this is not a logical thing to do this is not what your minds see and what your friend and your neighbor and your family and the great grandfather that you spoke to in a dream tell you something no no no no no that's not that at all this is let everything go wrong let everybody else Prosper let errors Prosper let the men who have a form of godliness deny the power thereof prosper and shove you back but if you know where you stand you'll stand regardless if the whole world turns you down you'll stand just the same you won't vary from the word the Jordan was three or four times its size spooky horrible looking muddy but Joshua said yeah what he said God said within three days we're going over and we're going over now the clergy would say now just a minute Joshua we are educated men we're smart many of us here Engineers from Egypt we know how to do these things so we'll just wait a little while until the stream clears up and we can walk across it isn't that much easier they even presented options but remember this was God testing the real Joshua he said I don't care what you think God said three days we're going over and we're going over we're going over in three days watch what Joshua did what did he put first the clergy no no sir he put the word first he said take that act and all your priests stay away from it get behind don't try to lead it let it lead you that's a trouble today we try to get ahead of the word and bypass and make the world to fit this to where to fit that bless your heart what we need today is to follow the word when it got to Jordan she opened up and they went over his first campaign put first things first he had a reason for that he had a reason because God had commissioned him stay with it with the word let the word do it every campaign the one fought in the battle because God had charged him to put the ark first after the arkman fought what went forth then singing players of instruments before the fight took place Hallelujah that's what we need today it's what we have this morning singers instrument playing music rejoicing then put the word first read the word then the battle sets in we're bound to win just got to win stay right with it keep its direction I'll keep you in the hour of trouble amen that's not my words that's his word put the word first whether you could figure it out or not whether you believe it's songs like it practical or it might work or we're not sure and the latest advisory says and and you know what the scientists say and an AI directing you a different direction at this point no what does the word see what did God say what are the instructions you have it has not changed no matter what systems change and government change and what whatever they may have changing all around us his word is still the same same yesterday today and forever not one adjustment to alteration you don't have to come and do Amendment say it it's still the same amen no I've read about about Elijah and we spoke a little bit about Elijah and Elisha earlier and you know in that that chapter and you don't have to find it in second Kings chapter two is interesting and I just want to read a little bit of it for you and it came to pass when the Lord would take up Elijah into Heaven by a whirlwind that Elijah went with Elisha from gilgal I want you to see something now and Elijah said unto Elisha tarry here I pray thee for the Lord had sent me to Bethel now this is the prophet tell you your partner tell you the person you're associated with tell you stay here relax because God called me to go a little further and Elijah said unto him as the Lord delivered and as I so liveth I will not leave thee so they went down to Bethel together I added with together they went down together so they were in Fellowship they were in harmony they were in conversation right now interest in development and the sons of the prophets that were at Bethel so they were going to battle and and the sons of the prophets were there the Kim Forte Elisha and said unto him nois thou that the Lord will take away thy master from thy head today and he said yeah I know it Whole New Year peace so what that tells us it wasn't a secret that Elijah was going you know it wasn't some surprise and a great mystery that Elijah was going that day the sons of the prophets Elijah said it himself it was open discussion that today he go in but they just wanted to make sure this man you're working with you know he going right they kind of check him a little bit you know he go in and he said yes holy peace just relax take it easy and it's a in verse 4 and Elijah said unto him Elisha this is for the second time Terry here I pray thee I know it sounds like the same words but in verse 4 he said tarry here I pray thee for the Lord had sent me to Jericho the front location and he said as the Lord liveth this is in response and as I solve it I will not leave thee so they came to Jericho so they went a different location and are adding this word together they walk in together talking together fellowshipping together as they move from place to place and time after time Elijah would have told Elijah sorry take it easy relax God has called me to go a little further but it's okay if you take it easy and once again when he said that in verse 5 and the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho so there were sons of the prophets at Battle now the sons of the Prophet said Jericho his sons of the Prophet said Jericho came to Elisha and said unto him knowest thou that the Lord will take away thy master from thy head today and he answered yea I know it hold your peace stop harassing me I know it it hasn't changed it's the same message we know he is going today hold your peace take it easy then in verse 6 Elisha said unto him Elijah sorry said unto him tari I pray thee here for the Lord had sent me to Jordan the front location Jordan now and he said as the Lord liveth and as I so love it same response I will not leave thee and there too went on now it said two went on all the time I said it went together right so two of them went on and 50 and 5th 7 and 50 50 misunder the prophets went 50 of them and stood to view afar off now I want you to see something that change here in every example before in the two previous examples is sanity prophets would come to Elisha and say you realize it's the manual we're moving with the master will be taken away today you recognize that he went to another location you realize he'll be taken away today nothing changed however in this instance in verse 6 the Bible says the two of them went on and 50 of the sons of the Prophet stood to view a far off and there too stood by Jordan meaning Elijah and Elisha that too is TW the two of them stood by Jordan Elijah took his mantle and wrapped it together and smoothed the water and they were divided hidden to the so that they too went over on dry ground similar to the red City it's open up and they move and dry ground and it came to pass this is the scripted readilia and it came to pass when they were gone over Elijah said unto Elisha keep in mind at this stage you have no Sons or the prophets in your ears telling where he going right so it's just the two of you and Elijah said unto Elisha ask what I shall do for thee before I be taken away from thee and Elijah said and I will add in almost immediately because at this stage remember this is today he go in he didn't have a month to pray and fast about it he didn't say hear what this is a big thing let me call it pastor let me just do something here and I will come back to you but he was called upon to respond with a level of urgency he was called to respond quick because this season he now had an opportunity that he didn't have before although he was walking and talking and conversing and they had this relationship that they were moving this was the time in which God through the prophet was given him an opportunity to access something that he didn't have access to before so at this moment this very moment he was called upon to respond so he responded and he said I pray thee let a double portion of thy Spirit be upon me so as I looked at this I said you know how do you respond to the word of God how do you respond to the call of God how do you respond to God speaking if you're not prepared can you imagine imagine you have no bird not all and God was a drop down tonight by his spirit and said anything you ask you shall have but you have no burden what you're asking for what you're asking for all right so imagine the opportunity and I know there are numerous examples that example is the sahati right when the prophet said listen anything you ask can you imagine if she wasn't prepared so it means we should be thinking about the ways we could respond if God were to to present the opportunity to us tonight and you say listen you can have what you will anything you want you could be healed you could be your children could be restored you can have a financial breakthrough whatever it is whatever you have need of you can get out tonight what would be your response because he call upon you to respond in his he called upon you to respond quickly you don't have time to say well Lord um perhaps if you ask me this after the holiday because I have some plans so perhaps on Friday or Saturday we want to have a power at that point so if you check my after that I will be in the atmosphere to respond no the Holy Spirit could come tonight and present to you the opportunity for Lying Eyes a purple pun for the sick to be healed for for the death to hear listen the afflictions that you think are Troublesome and big in the eyes of God be already established that we don't have to worry about it we don't have to worry about the job and the trouble some neighbor and the environment and the community and who say something about you we don't have to figure that part out perhaps God is just testing the real you to see how you're going to respond right now what I observe is that he call upon you to respond quickly in a particular way but you have to be prepared in order to give a an account in order to give a response in our way so I went on and I looked at at any Book of Luke a simple scripture that we all familiar with and it speaks about Mary and just as a background I would say the angel Gabriel visited Mary and similar to Elijah and Elijah had a lot of conversation with her said how are you going hear this I want to tell you something I know you might have read before that Isaiah said a virgin shall conceive but that was a long time ago it's over 400 years and you are really the kind of person that we were looking for and we believe true you this could happen you know and he had a lot of conversation and this discourse with her but there came a point as they were conversing that she had a question almost like a burning question and I will read it for you in the Book of Luke chapter 1 verse 34 to 41. forgive me if I read too much tonight but the word of God is so sweet I can't explain it like this the way it says it here is perfect so from verse 34 it says then said Mary unto the angel how shall this be seeing I know not a man that was a question I want you to observe some something that prior to this they were back and forth he was talking telling her Plenty things this is how the child will be this is what was promised yeah but there came a point in which he asked how shall this be seeing I know not a man and the angel answered and said unto how the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee this was the directive right the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that Holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of God and behold this was an addition and behold this is not the question she asked so he added this because she asked how shall this be he said in verse 36 and behold that cousin Elizabeth she hath also conceived a son in her old age and this is the sixth month with her who was called Baron so you and I know she was Barren in the past but I'm telling you although everybody may not know she is six months pregnant now for with God nothing shall be impossible keep in mind this is the Angel sharing this in verse 38 and I see this as the critical part he says and Mary said behold the handmaid of the Lord be it unto me according to Thy word now I want you to observe she didn't say you know what you say there's some kind of good if you could just allow me I just want to Whatsapp my cousin and see if she really pregnant because it shares some information here that I want to verify I want to make a call as a matter of fact if you could wait right here I just go in by my cousin and come back because these things are saying some kind of impossible although it says is possible I just she didn't respond like that she was called upon to respond quickly they heard her response in verse 30th and Mary said behold the handmaid of the Lord be it unto me according to Thy Word and check check this out and the angel departed from her so the angel didn't stick around why his job was over he delivered him the message and he got the response he expected she responded quickly and said hey be it unto me I am not going to try to figure this out if this is what a word said this is what I hold into this is the promise I stuck in with and it goes further in verse 39 it says and Mary arose in those days and went into the Hill Country with haste she didn't slowly go you know she didn't say well boy you know I met an angel yesterday I have a testimony I met an angel last week I just want us to have a barbecue and we can discuss the fact that I met her angel last week no that was my attitude her mindset was listen be it unto me and marry a rose and she went into the Hill Country with his into the city of Judah and entered the house of Zacharias and saluted Elizabeth so she went up at once it reminded Caleb when the spies came back and they said you know it had creeps and it had Giants and we see the ups and downs and you know you know the kind of thing and the urban flew and we'd say if we could plan better we should probably build up the military a little bit and do six months of training and if we could you know perhaps get some snipers involved go behind the enemy lights what about if we devise a tactical plan what about if we sit down that sounds like a good idea and we get a general you know what it's best we get a general because we have 12 different tribes so they may have 12 different mindsets so you know what how about if we get two representatives from each group no that was not the approach he said listen as a short man he stood up on a box and he said let us go up at once because he knew that the word said this land was promised unto them and Joshua said every place you put your foot is yours so there was no time to waste there was no time to to sit down and relax and think about it they were responding quickly to the word of God to see that promise made manifest amen in the last verse of that chapter in verse 31 well it says and it came to pass that when Elizabeth heard the salutation of Mary because you heard that Mary Rand Elizabeth she went on with his and and she she went into the house of Zacharias and and saluted Elizabeth and it came to pass that when Elizabeth heard the salutation of Mary The Babe left in her womb and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost that was the that was the by-product of the response so she got the word she accept the word she didn't question it she didn't say well you know what I really want to consult with my family about this you know because this Angel thing I don't know anybody in my generation at the angel really visiting us so what I want to do I want to put it up and insert is it okay if we take a selfie and I put it on Instagram just to see if anybody else knows this Angel no no no no no no no no no she was so convinced of the word of God I was shared by that angel that she went accepted responded and went with hist to Elizabeth a cousin and you could see as a result when she did that salutation The Babe left and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost I mean it is profound to me that we could look at the scripture and we see the examples we see these signs we see the historical empirical evidence that suggests that no matter how we dis it how you flip it how you try to turn it how you try to study this thing we catholicated I can't figure it out you can't figure it out what he calls for is a level of faith that is why you said listen it doesn't matter your qualifications or your level of literacy your education you know he say listen he could reveal himself to the most illiterate person he don't need your degree he don't need your passes he don't need that all he look for is that that seed of faith that he plant in your soul that could be activated such that you could hear his word and accept his word and respond accordingly oftentimes I started by saying videos get too bright we try to apply logic we try to apply all kind of practical advice and what we think might be best suited to this scenario but all God calls for is for faith in his word belief in his word and to respond accordingly and you will see the manifestation of his word and you will see the acceleration of his promises in your life you know I could recall Jacob we often hear the story Jacob wrestling with the angel he wrestled all night and you wrestle he wrestle you wrestle wrestle until it was a Breaking of the day and at that point the angel said listen here what I I fight up enough here you know this fight how long this fight going on just now it's day time this all night we're fighting what really going on as a matter of fact we could recall he he touched his side and and his from the outer joints right so he had a limp afterwards because this was the by-product of the fight but you know what there came a point in which a question was asked I know we see the trend we see when the season change and these opportunities opportunities arise somehow our question is always us and when they asked Jacob the question he say what I am Jacob I am a trickster I'm a shyster I'm a I'm a smart man I'm a man listen if you give me a chance I outsmart you but you say from this default because I could see I asked the question and your response your quick response is that listen I can't stay here I can't stay hiding from my brother I can't stay hiding from from what might await down the road I can stay looking over my shoulder looking to see if I could devise a plan to escape the enemy I need a change tonight I need a change right now listen his name was changed the work was changed the talk was changed the attitude was changed what happened based on his response they met his need right there he didn't have to take a day he didn't have to take a month he didn't have to go to a worship service and sing two songs but he was so convinced he was so ready that once the question was asked what's the opportunity arose he was in a position to respond and accept it catch a hole using faith and seeing listen that's mine that's what I want that's a change I want I also think about that thief on the cross you know I know we often highlight him and I think it's such a powerful story because this thief was a real Thief I always remember brother Brian said listen be the best at what you could be you say if I'm a bomb I'd be the best bomb man I will eat out of the digital tears garbage if I'm a mailman I'll be the best mailman whatever you are if I'm a doctor I'll be the best doctor I could find this thief was a real Thief he was not jokative as a matter of fact I'm pretty sure fatal crucify as if he had to be a real revolutionary Thief a relative this is not somebody you just take two mangoes and you go down the road this is a man with a he was a seasoned creative career criminal they had it old Fame this was no wrongfully accused they had all his stats when apology rap sheet the rap might have been so long you say listen we even want to read everything crucifixion cross for you but you know what when Jesus put between those thieves on the cross and wanted had an attitude save yourself and to use King of the Jews and he was a boss and you could do all things he had a particular attitude and there was another thief and this thief saw things a little different he saw that he sees not change and an opportunity arose and and how he responded will dictate or determine the outcome of the next step and he said you know remember me I know I bad you know I know there's nothing good about me I know I deserve to be here I know I get what I sign up for because this is the life I live this is the part I choose but I want you to remember me because I know you don't deserve this and Jesus responded at that point yes and said hey you know what this tea not tomorrow not next week not next year you will be with me in Paradise and not leaving things a chance and not going and say well we'll see how it work out not God is so direct remember early on I say he's deliberate he don't play around if he say go he know you're going you know he predestinate that you know if he said trials them trials are yours you know don't get quiet now if you say trials them trials are yours he already know the outcome you know the end before the beginning that's why he says alpha omega beginning and the end first and last when job had his opportunity when season changed think about it they were moving to and through to and through I don't know imagine this listen I'm not even bothering my job because you are hedge around him he is protected he's well protected we're not even going to interfere with him because he have surveillance he have cameras he have spikes he had dogs he have I mean the military really monitoring what's going on the car infiltrate that at all and God said listen is that right let me tell you something the kind of character job have take a crack at him do him what you want flip him upside down carry him through the fire the flood you name it just don't take his life do what you want and God was so convinced that job was going to respond the right way I keep saying when the season change a question is almost always asked not to almost always ask the turning point for job was when his wife his beautiful lovely wife of his youth would have come to him and say honey hear what we've been through thick and thin we've seen business good and bad we've we've seen the vows tested but at this stage here we're going on just because God and I why you do because there's a question presented why not just do that because we don't really have a choice but remember what I said you see we are not in a position to try to figure out what's God going to do and how he's going to do it why he's going to do it there was a man that was blind when Jesus was on the scene and they came and said hear what master sin why is he blind why is he in this condition we know something is wrong for him to be afflicted in this week and Jesus answered and said listen it's not mother father it's not what you think it's not your ability to watch it and feel you could figure out this scenario that's not your rule that's not your purpose when you think about it I have read true scriptures and I see listen we complicate this thing you know people it real simple imagine and I'll get back to those we live in a time we live in an era in which people like to find things there are those who will sit in church and we know there are three types of believers and there's a kind of like to find fault they find this too loud it's too soft they find these two two Darkness to light they find we should sing faster some slow song Whatever It Is they find a lot of stuff when all God asks you to find it's defining promises applicable to your life you know he say when is son of man come at shall he find faith that's what you should be looking for not fault and and trials and struggles and and this Wonder of me the wrong way this one embarrassed man this one make me feel bad I don't like the way he walked past me and he didn't shake my hand no he wants to find faith you want your fine promises if your must find fault find fault with what the devil has done to the young people if you want to find fault find fault with how he has allowed people to become so distracted and caught up with things of this world that they forget to pray if you want to find anything find the altar find yourself at the alt and pray cry out unto God for the Holy Ghost for the talking cry out so that ceiling Angel could come by you tonight and do something for you that you could be healed and delivered tonight not tomorrow that we're not Angel come and say listen what will thou have me to do tonight that you could respond quickly that you know exactly the promises that are laid out and outlined for you to be receiving that's the things we should find not drama and bacchanal not gossip and fasting and stewing and fighting and and church politics no we must find where our name is written we must find the things applicable to us in this hour not foolishness there are things that will just waste your time there are things that are in my mind sometimes are meant you know on the internet now it has something called trolls trolls are people things they're robots and all kind of stuff men to just distract you from reality just throw you off so you have a Target you want a rich X place and something pulling you this way something pulling you that way we want to be single-eyed we want to be focused on the mark of the High Calling we want to be able to run a race knowing that you started this work is able to take us straight through till the end you see he's never made a promise that he cannot fulfill his word will never return void in the example with Mary when Isaiah prophesied that a virgin shall conceive it didn't happen I don't know it didn't happen in a year or a month or a decade generation after generation would have passed this information on that you know what a virgin shall conceive in my time so you know what I I changed the concept perhaps when the sad virgin what they meant no his word is perfectional and it's not listen when I think about this I realize Although our responsibility might be great look how easy it is imagine we don't have the responsibility to figure out God's Next Step think about that so God knows you're gonna be here tonight you couldn't stay home if you're tried you know you know that you couldn't even stay home if you're tried you had an appointment before the foundation of the world to be here tonight and hear what you hear you were specially chosen to be here tonight and for those on the internet you could miss this if you try to know you may be doing whatever you're doing but tonight you're hard to hear this no matter what happened yesterday what happened last night what happened earlier perhaps you wasn't feeling too good you couldn't miss this one you know this this was predestinated for you you know don't even try to figure it out you know and we've heard it over and over healing and blessing and and gifts and callings and stuff sometimes it's really really always tied to your ability to respond quickly not just to rock back and say you know what he said some interesting perhaps what was said on Sunday I want to look over the table but while the word goes forward if it's a genuine honor unulcerated without God we because by your faith you'll behold by your faith you'll be made well by your ability to respond quickly and correctly you'll see what I mean you know there's a message Awakening Jesus brother Branham paragraph 258 I'm almost done the other night the Holy Spirit struck I want to listen to this carefully the Holy Spirit struck over in some church I know and it called three or four people now we didn't call the church three or four people and when it did now the Holy Spirit struck called three or four people and when it did they didn't respond just quickly these are not my words they didn't respond just quickly and then he was grieved and I'm making this up Awakening Jesus 63 paragraph 258. the other night the Holy Spirit struck within some church I know and it called three or four people and when it did they didn't respond just quickly and then he was grieved he went
