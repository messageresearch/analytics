[28:46] night moon eternal by Buster tree
[28:48] portion scripture in Genesis chapter 25
[28:50] mark chapter 4 2nd Timothy chapter 4
[28:55] when I read Genesis 25 was 21 and 34 one
[28:59] remark for verse 23 to 29 2nd Timothy 4
[29:04] wonderful reading Genesis 25 freedom
[29:11] from booze 21 an Isaac entreated the
[29:15] world the Lord for his wife because she
[29:17] was barren and the Lord was entreated of
[29:20] him and Rebecca his wife conceived and
[29:23] the children struggled together within
[29:25] her and she said if it be so why am i
[29:28] thus and she went to inquire of the Lord
[29:31] and the Lord said unto her two nations
[29:33] are in thy womb and two manner of people
[29:37] shall be separated from thy powerless
[29:39] and the one people shall be stronger
[29:42] than the other people on the elder shall
[29:45] serve the younger when a day is to be
[29:48] delivered with fulfill behold they were
[29:50] twins in a woman the first came out red
[29:53] all over like a hairy garment they call
[29:56] his name Esau and after that came his
[29:59] brother out and his hand to : Esau
[30:02] healed and his name was called Jacob and
[30:05] Isaac was threescore years old when she
[30:07] bare them the boys grew he's always a
[30:10] cunning hunter man out of the field
[30:11] Jacob was a plain man dwelling in tents
[30:14] and he saw Isaac loved Esau because he
[30:17] did eat of his venison but Rebecca loved
[30:19] Jacob Jacob sought partisan Esau came
[30:23] with the field and he was faint Esau
[30:26] said to Jacob feed me I pray thee
[30:27] without seeing him read pottage for I am
[30:29] faint deer for was his name called Edom
[30:32] and Jacob said sell me this data boy
[30:35] tried Esau said behold I am at the point
[30:39] to die and what profit shall dispute
[30:42] right do to me Jacob said swear to me
[30:45] this day and he swelled to him and he
[30:48] sold his birthright unto Jacob
[30:52] then Jacob give Esau bread and pottage
[30:54] of lentils and he did eat drink rose up
[30:56] and went his way
[30:58] thus he saw despised his birthright Mark
[31:03] chapter four we want to read from verse
[31:06] 23 Jesus speak him if any man have ears
[31:11] to hear let him hear
[31:14] and he said unto them take heed what you
[31:18] hear with what measure you met it shall
[31:22] be measured to you and unto you that
[31:24] here shall more be given for he that hat
[31:28] to him shall be given and he that had
[31:31] not from him shall be taken even that
[31:34] which he hath so is the kingdom of God
[31:38] as if a man should cast seed into the
[31:40] ground and should sleep and rise night
[31:42] and day and the seed should spring and
[31:45] grow up and he know it not how for the
[31:47] earth bring it forth fruit of itself
[31:49] first the blade then the ear and after
[31:53] that the full corn in the ear when the
[31:56] fruit is brought forth immediately he
[31:59] put it in his sickle because the harvest
[32:02] has come
[32:03] alas scriptures from 2nd Timothy 4 we
[32:06] want to read from verse 1 2 for I
[32:08] charged ddr4 before God and the Lord
[32:11] Jesus Christ who shall judge the quick
[32:12] and the dead at his appearing and his
[32:15] kingdom preached the word the instant in
[32:18] season out of season reprove rebuke
[32:21] exhort with all long-suffering and
[32:24] doctrine for the time will come when
[32:27] they will not end your song doctrine but
[32:30] after their own lusts shall they heap to
[32:32] themselves teachers having itching ears
[32:36] and they shall turn away from the ears
[32:39] from the truth and shall turn into
[32:41] fables
[32:41] now let's pray father we thank you for
[32:43] your word may you interpret your water
[32:45] hearts as we wait on you tonight we wait
[32:47] upon your spirit to come and confirm
[32:49] your word in Jesus and we ask it email
[32:51] you may be seated praise the name of the
[32:53] Lord or what a blessing it to be here
[32:56] tonight the presence of God glad I see
[32:58] all of you out here tonight
[32:59] I believe there'll be doors connected to
[33:01] us god bless you our title tonight here
[33:05] in
[33:05] receiving an actin on the word here in
[33:11] receiving an actin the word mystery
[33:15] parts people could hear but that doesn't
[33:17] mean they receive we could claim to
[33:20] receive and don't even act upon what
[33:22] they have it but you want to act upon
[33:26] what you hear I have an inspiration the
[33:29] measure of thought and study you give to
[33:32] the truth you here
[33:34] that's my the measure and thought and
[33:37] study you give to the truth you hear and
[33:40] I was a warning I didn't put that dong
[33:42] be careful what you hear I've a context
[33:46] scripture and is from second Timothy
[33:50] 3:16 but I want to really amplified of
[33:52] that it says every scripture all
[33:55] Scripture is profitable for doctrine and
[33:56] so on L all Scripture is god-breathed it
[34:01] is given by inspiration and is
[34:04] profitable for instruction for reproof
[34:07] and conviction of sin for correction of
[34:11] error and discipline and obedience and
[34:13] for training and righteousness in holy
[34:16] living in conformity to God's will in
[34:19] thought purpose and action now
[34:23] understand this when God began to reveal
[34:25] himself to his people his people had was
[34:29] to listen to his words to get his
[34:32] thoughts of how he presented himself on
[34:36] how he wants to be worship all what
[34:39] Moses gifted the people was given by God
[34:42] so you need to hear the word and give
[34:46] thought to the word an amazing word to
[34:49] catch the mind of God that you could
[34:51] please God because somebody could live a
[34:54] normal successful life on it with money
[34:58] with wealth and everything else die and
[35:00] go to hell
[35:01] normal normal normal good people and it
[35:04] has nothing to do with God's program
[35:06] here this this is scripture that you
[35:10] have to receive in your heart and in
[35:12] your spirit isn't that right
[35:14] Oh blessed be the lord of measure and
[35:17] thought and study you give
[35:18] and that inspiration comes from that
[35:21] same script we read in mark chapter 4
[35:23] and you know we read it he said unto
[35:26] them and this is the amplified be
[35:29] careful what you are hearing the measure
[35:32] of thought and study you give to the
[35:36] truth you hear will be the measure of
[35:39] virtue and knowledge that comes back to
[35:42] you and more besides will be given to
[35:45] you who here Sophia coming here in the
[35:48] world so tonight you come to hear the
[35:51] word to be empowered and the scripture
[35:56] itself has strengthened it no they'd
[35:58] ever don't want you to know that that's
[36:00] why he doesn't want you to read your
[36:02] Bible don't you want to reduce what boss
[36:04] doesn't want you to listen to a tape or
[36:06] listen to any word you just go into life
[36:08] because you know every Scripture is God
[36:10] breathed the breath of God is upon the
[36:13] word so if you give that thought and
[36:16] measure and study to the word you'll be
[36:18] empowered because it will teach you to
[36:21] wait upon the Lord instead of pushing
[36:24] yourself forward to do your own thing
[36:26] because you prefer to be in the will of
[36:28] God hallelujah believe that tonight oh
[36:32] praise God so we under tension tonight
[36:36] praise God for the a revival for
[36:40] apostolic blessing for signs and wonders
[36:43] and miracles that's our right to expect
[36:46] that we got next make it next week we
[36:48] can expect it tonight every service I
[36:51] come and I'm come and expect in it
[36:52] because I don't know when he will come
[36:54] suddenly into his temple I don't know
[36:57] when the Holy Spirit will dropped on us
[36:58] out of here with a measure of power
[37:00] praise God give you'd all glory to God
[37:06] is that right hallelujah hallelujah if
[37:09] you are not crying the ceiling you is
[37:10] crying that's see crying for perfection
[37:13] that seed crying for life or something
[37:17] inside you is what pushing you is what
[37:19] driving you you you can't even help it
[37:21] or glory to God because God put that
[37:23] seed in you and that's you have to work
[37:26] its way out okay there are some praises
[37:28] when a farmer put a seed into the ground
[37:31] that's enough to push his way out my
[37:34] fate the farmer put that seed in the
[37:35] ground by fate the family expecting rain
[37:38] and Sun and my faith the life in the sea
[37:41] begins to push Oh glory to God on
[37:44] tonight there's a life in your seed go
[37:47] ahead and give your dead seed go until
[37:49] you are predestinated seeded it's our
[37:51] game seed God give you or glory their
[37:54] God we believe that hallelujah that seed
[37:57] is what caused you to hear a word let's
[37:59] see what calls you receive the word but
[38:02] you have to act upon the word also or
[38:04] glow in a God when I say receive I'm not
[38:07] talking about outwardly and formally but
[38:10] inwardly and willingly you want the will
[38:13] of God you want to receive the word
[38:15] inwardly and willingly not formally and
[38:18] outwardly when I know I should do it no
[38:20] not that you want to do it you want to
[38:23] please God or every Sun that acted on
[38:26] the Word of God was blessed
[38:27] oh my hallelujah
[38:32] oh praise the name of the Lord be
[38:35] careful what you are hearing the measure
[38:38] of taught and study a gift of the truth
[38:40] will be the measure of virtue and
[38:42] knowledge that comes back to you Oh
[38:44] glory to God hallelujah praise God thank
[38:49] you Lord Jesus do you believe that
[38:50] tonight hallelujah so God wants you to
[38:54] come into conformity to his will in
[38:57] thought in purpose and action you know
[39:02] some people say prayers see novena say
[39:04] thing and say little thing and thing
[39:05] like that
[39:06] that's a ritual that has nothing to do
[39:11] with God's intent and purpose that
[39:13] brings an effect upon your life this
[39:16] gospel comes having an effect of upon
[39:19] your life that drives you into action
[39:21] not talk you see people right now
[39:24] sitting on in church only take and talk
[39:26] because he passed a preaching on the
[39:28] minister preacher and they love the
[39:29] pasta and it passes in a passenger
[39:30] capacity era but court not on death
[39:33] before them cheering was born he said
[39:36] Jacob I love he so I hate before there
[39:40] was even born
[39:41] because he know the life inside him will
[39:43] for a certain way so when Rebecca had a
[39:49] challenges got to let two nations in
[39:51] your womb go to see two sons and two
[39:53] nations two people and right now there
[39:56] are two people in the church there's
[39:58] bright spirit and church spirit and you
[40:01] have to know where you belong one thing
[40:05] one thing about Jacob even the fate for
[40:09] the built rank or glory of God and that
[40:15] is what you here for tonight not to be
[40:18] goody two-shoes because Isaac loved Esau
[40:21] but God loved Jacob oh he's a good cook
[40:25] Isaac could cook good Jacob good cook
[40:27] good good thing you could cook catchy
[40:33] brother anybody hungry now Jacob whether
[40:38] DC where he was a scampi was this he was
[40:40] that but gotta love him because it will
[40:43] try to represent the holy spirit and
[40:45] that is your birthright
[40:47] you're right of authority or right to
[40:49] inheritance that is to put the one to
[40:51] bad you want the power of God in your
[40:54] life you didn't want to come to church
[40:55] and go back home you want power in your
[40:57] life how many can say amen to that
[41:00] tonight so we are looking for dynamics
[41:07] to the mechanics you looking for another
[41:11] Ephesians and the faith is to produce
[41:13] that succour tense and well my no - no -
[41:16] no it's back to the faith of the fathers
[41:18] and that faith will reproduce and not
[41:20] Ephesians which is purely supernatural
[41:22] because Ephesians was the Alpha Satan
[41:26] don't know what Ephesians back here
[41:27] again you know all Satan readin is loud
[41:29] easier and he forgave India but you see
[41:32] I am Alpha and Omega so he brought the
[41:35] profit to the end allowed Isha to tow us
[41:37] back to the faith to pull Ephesians
[41:39] right out of the ground
[41:40] the politicians back in this hour here
[41:43] or glory the gods of the seven seas
[41:45] seventh on the message is to release
[41:47] another Ephesians which brings a
[41:49] faithful ministry which brings on the
[41:51] perfection of the saints the work of the
[41:54] ministry the
[41:55] fan of the body till we all come into
[41:57] the unit if it all this foolishness and
[41:59] Church separation that will be busted
[42:02] when the flood of the Holy Ghost began
[42:04] to pour out and go inside to flood them
[42:06] churches I'll flood them at the Holy
[42:08] Ghost so believers will have fellowship
[42:10] and all them pastors cutting this one
[42:13] off and once again cut off because it's
[42:17] not mine my power but by my spirit or
[42:21] glory to God and the church have been
[42:23] built for 40 plus years on the mechanics
[42:25] and all can intellectual stuff but God
[42:28] promised that the church will be rebuilt
[42:30] by the power of the Spirit so we are
[42:34] waiting for the rebuilders the
[42:36] rebuilding anointing not by might not by
[42:40] power but by my spirit share the Lord
[42:43] it wouldn't be the work of a man it's
[42:46] may be the work of the Holy Ghost
[42:47] oh I what are you hearing tonight what
[42:51] hair is dull right of Jesus Christ Oh
[42:56] God Oh glory to God hallelujah what a
[43:02] Brandon prophesied Illinois did not he
[43:05] say I'm only building they always close
[43:07] at hand when they want to see some
[43:09] things happen when something is going to
[43:11] take place and all this background has
[43:14] been laying a foundation for a short
[43:16] quick message that would the whole
[43:18] nations or glory I'm missing I'm gonna
[43:21] shake the whole nation then he's away to
[43:23] let me seventh unless after the voices

[1:01:01] everybody with a broad brush as if that
[1:01:04] is so that's not so
[1:01:05] and you still and short a self of the
[1:01:08] vision
[1:01:09] I know people who dreams got cut off of
[1:01:12] hearing what other people see and they
[1:01:15] was never supposed to listen to that be
[1:01:17] careful what you hear and sometimes I
[1:01:20] did be careful what they speak some let
[1:01:22] me speak the vision to the wrong person
[1:01:23] and they twist it and it make it show
[1:01:26] off of it that's why the vision have to
[1:01:29] come from God
[1:01:30] and envision have to come directly to
[1:01:32] you I mean after know what you're
[1:01:34] hearing don't let nobody to you're off
[1:01:36] track I have a vision God give me a
[1:01:39] vision I'm not going to loan my sight
[1:01:41] from that vision people will come people
[1:01:43] go that's their joy choice I am here who
[1:01:46] God God please me to keep the vision
[1:01:49] straight for the vision is from
[1:01:52] appointed time the Baptist that they
[1:01:55] could hold on long enough to see it
[1:01:57] fulfilled we have seen enough to believe
[1:01:59] God could unfold visions revelations
[1:02:02] because it churches spirit on Revelation
[1:02:04] not on feelings not on human beings it
[1:02:08] wasn't built upon pizza he was gonna
[1:02:09] fail it's built up under of Revelation
[1:02:12] that's the anchor inside your soul
[1:02:15] that's why you're the prey for God
[1:02:16] forgive you revelation revelation is
[1:02:19] prevalent power revelation is revealing
[1:02:21] power how you could get revelation and
[1:02:23] you're not reading the word how you can
[1:02:25] get revelation you're not meditating on
[1:02:26] the word how you can get revelation
[1:02:28] you're not in the spirit of the word or
[1:02:32] give the Lord some praise these people
[1:02:34] measure and thought and study that again
[1:02:37] and God reward you with revelation and
[1:02:40] your prevalent power on a man who just
[1:02:42] kernel and natural have nothing you're
[1:02:45] just going to church no change in their
[1:02:48] life no change in their thinking because
[1:02:51] what the word does it changes your mind
[1:02:53] God said my trust is not your thoughts
[1:02:55] so how will you get the thoughts of God
[1:02:57] if you don't get the will of God to
[1:02:59] impact upon your thoughts because you
[1:03:01] see impossibilities you see hurdles you
[1:03:03] see hindrances
[1:03:05] you see red sea you see all kind of
[1:03:07] things because you are thinking at the
[1:03:08] natural level but when you toss a god
[1:03:10] drop down you are being recognized all
[1:03:12] things are possible
[1:03:13] he wasn't talking that way before but
[1:03:15] now you begin to talk different because
[1:03:17] he's thinking different from not
[1:03:19] possible to all things are possible
[1:03:22] so your feet begin to expand you start
[1:03:24] to exercise the Fate muscles because I
[1:03:26] start to see supernatural sight
[1:03:30] [Music]

[1:03:35] what if Samson accepted the fact of
[1:03:37] affair with Delilah what is that Samson

[1:03:41] penalty of his sins
[1:03:42] Samson rejected all of that the spice
[1:03:46] was peeling ready he lost his eyes

[1:09:42] at the clock to great religious forces
[1:09:46] that is soon coming to head usher down
[1:09:48] and it's represented by two sons of
[1:09:51] Isaac Esau and Jacob
[1:09:52] they represent these two forces
[1:09:54] consecrated mother virgin became the
[1:09:57] world fussin and fightin at war with
[1:09:59] each other and they have been world
[1:10:00] other ever since and will be till the
[1:10:02] end time
[1:10:03] and the world is seriously kryptonite by

[1:10:09] fighting since anyone so now many times
[1:10:16] my brother mistake me when I see watch
[1:10:18] lottery max I have to see some
[1:10:20] scriptures I have written here I want
[1:10:21] everyone to know that when some time I
[1:10:23] refer to the condition of the church or
[1:10:24] denomination or something
[1:10:26] mayn't I my brethren mistake me when I
[1:10:27] see that I'm not referring to spirit
[1:10:30] film men who stand as shepherds and feed
[1:10:32] the flock of God that's what Dean by the
[1:10:34] Holy goes to do so I am talking about
[1:10:36] common believers like like today Tristan
[1:10:40] today I think don't president America
[1:10:42] talk to the United Nations he's talking
[1:10:44] about you know make America full and
[1:10:45] said respect for sovereignty we're not
[1:10:47] telling anybody how to worship and outer
[1:10:49] outer do on what I can what matters and
[1:10:51] things respect for sovereignty and after
[1:10:53] you say that he went on attacked when
[1:10:55] his will attack Iran China attack you
[1:10:59] see what going on there he say respect
[1:11:00] my serenity but how can you well it's
[1:11:03] supposed to go to is respect the
[1:11:05] sovereignty also are a combat
[1:11:07] restorative the local church see so the
[1:11:10] church supposed to be sovereign it means
[1:11:12] also influence no bishop pasta nobody
[1:11:16] all said the comment Ellis what to do
[1:11:17] how to do it and interfere with what
[1:11:18] goes inside of here
[1:11:19] this is a sovereign Church it can't have
[1:11:22] totally goes is one word he goes kind of
[1:11:24] to teachers how kind of two guys is one
[1:11:26] pasta that God will give instructions
[1:11:29] and guidance and vision to and other
[1:11:30] people fulfill and walk into that vision
[1:11:32] if you don't like I tell you can find
[1:11:34] another group and another Church simple
[1:11:36] no complicated thing you know no coming
[1:11:38] and get fight that doesn't make any
[1:11:40] sense
[1:11:41] move on with your life no tears won't be
[1:11:44] shed on replanting like I don't know
[1:11:45] knowing this this farm you were right
[1:11:47] now we look at the head to the rapture
[1:11:49] well we're looking for a charitable one
[1:11:52] perfection I'm not trying to see how
[1:11:54] good I could be living down here I am
[1:11:56] preparing to leave here everything in
[1:11:59] this journey is a journey that God bless
[1:12:03] you to Sylvan better when what give you

[1:12:27] pass away the horse gonna pass away and
[1:12:28] get rusty but that virtue and knowledge
[1:12:30] that is eternal so we come in to get
[1:12:33] eternal purpose ticket to get the mind
[1:12:35] of God to get instruction from God they
[1:12:37] get God guidance or glory Allah God Esau
[1:12:40] represented I cannot believe a earthly
[1:12:42] man was of the earth religiously

[1:12:46] the people they got a religion of some
[1:12:48] sort whether attend church or not isn't

[1:13:51] tribes of Israel and that's come the
[1:13:53] people of Israel or give the Lord some

[1:14:25] people and he had spiritual discernment
[1:14:28] of what was right and what was wrong and
[1:14:30] you will understand that the entire
[1:14:32] church is built upon the revelation of
[1:14:35] Jesus Christ
