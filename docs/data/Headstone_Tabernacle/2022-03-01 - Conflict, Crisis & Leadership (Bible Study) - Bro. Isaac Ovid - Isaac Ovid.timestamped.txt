[14:29] father lord we are living in strange
[14:32] times as it were lord it's strange to

[16:06] bless us tonight
[16:08] as we wait on you in the precious name
[16:10] of jesus christ amen and amen and amen
[16:13] so certainly a great privilege to be
[16:15] here tonight
[16:16] uh once again for our tuesday night
[16:19] bible study
[16:21] and i certainly want to salute um
[16:23] brother ovid and brother stephen who
[16:25] would have done the the last series of
[16:27] bible studies and certainly i have been
[16:30] blessed and i know you have been blessed
[16:32] as well how god has been revealing
[16:34] himself to us through scriptures through
[16:36] quotes through statements through
[16:39] uh inspirations and nuggets and and ways
[16:42] for us to see god in his plainness
[16:44] especially in a time
[16:46] as this and i said he want to salute
[16:47] brett over for the message on sunday
[16:50] russia the king of the north uh what a
[16:53] true masterpiece and and underscoring it
[16:55] all acknowledging that the ceiling time
[16:58] is here you know and um
[17:00] you know i i
[17:02] it's something it's something else when
[17:04] when
[17:05] you know it's not even just in the
[17:08] ecclesiastical realm or the church realm
[17:10] but you know i went for my haircut in
[17:13] the barber shop and it was the
[17:15] conversation it was a topic it was the
[17:17] theme you know
[17:18] wars rumors of wars the end of times and
[17:22] and many of people in the conversation
[17:24] aren't necessarily church folk as it
[17:26] were
[17:27] but there's a buzzing there's a
[17:29] conversation there's a there's a
[17:31] consciousness that
[17:32] things are not normal you know we spend
[17:34] two years going through a pandemic and
[17:36] then there's war and there's change and
[17:39] there's currencies and the markets and
[17:41] you know all of these things that are
[17:42] happening
[17:44] you know it you don't need to be a
[17:45] spiritual rocket scientist to know that
[17:48] the the the the forces that are supposed
[17:50] to be gathering together are gathering
[17:52] you know and i really appreciate but
[17:54] always approach last sunday you know yes
[17:57] we understand what's happening in that
[17:59] realm but more than that it is what do
[18:03] we have to do you know we could spend
[18:05] hours and hours analyzing you know
[18:08] history the history and and russia and
[18:10] the granular details of it but if at the
[18:12] end of that analysis
[18:14] you haven't changed your walk you
[18:16] haven't changed your talk you are not
[18:18] death spirit for the holy ghost then we
[18:20] miss the mark somewhere you know so
[18:22] these things are just signs of the times
[18:25] and the reality is there are those who
[18:27] will see the signs be aware of the signs
[18:29] be conscious of the signs and still not
[18:31] take any action still not change still
[18:34] not do something different in their walk
[18:37] and their talk and that is what we want
[18:38] to be so sensitive of
[18:41] that being in the position that we are
[18:43] in by the grace of god where we
[18:45] understand things that are to be that we
[18:47] don't get so caught up in studying the
[18:49] things that are to be that we miss us
[18:52] getting ready to give an answer for our
[18:55] hope and our walk and our talk and that
[18:57] is the underlying passion and the zeal
[19:00] of finding the balance between analyzing
[19:03] what is happening in the economic realm
[19:05] and and cryptocurrency and the
[19:07] conspiracy theories and the the nato and
[19:10] the u.n yes it's important and and i
[19:12] spent time looking at it but it has to
[19:15] be a balance between understanding these
[19:17] things
[19:18] and crying holding on to the horns of
[19:20] the altar because the angel has not
[19:23] putting a mark upon them who understand
[19:25] these things and putting a mark upon
[19:26] those that sigh and cry for the
[19:28] abomination that's in the city so i
[19:31] really want us to be sensitive and to be
[19:34] conscious you know of these things you
[19:36] know so i'm trusting the lord tonight i
[19:39] have a little thought um that i wanted
[19:41] getting to but i really
[19:43] in my heart to really have you know a
[19:45] burden to just have a conversation as we
[19:48] are approaching this time that we are
[19:50] living in you know and um
[19:52] it's really it is it is so paradoxical
[19:56] how
[19:57] quickly
[19:59] things can change
[20:01] you know we are we are we are on an
[20:04] island and and for us who are here in
[20:06] trinidad we have not experienced
[20:09] anything
[20:10] that europe and these countries would
[20:12] have experienced in you know world war
[20:14] one and world war ii and and what is
[20:16] happening now you know some countries
[20:18] can't understand it you almost have to
[20:20] have been there or have people who are
[20:21] connected to it to kind of see it but
[20:23] the reality was that if you were to
[20:25] rewind the tape on february 23rd
[20:31] things were normal in ukraine because
[20:34] the invasion started on february 24th
[20:37] one
[20:38] day later it was an entirely different
[20:40] situation
[20:42] for some people the building that they
[20:43] worked in no longer exists
[20:45] if you ask them just a week ago just a
[20:48] week ago was february 22nd
[20:51] and for some people their homes existed
[20:53] today their home does not exist for some
[20:56] people
[20:57] a week ago the road existed now the road
[20:59] no longer exists
[21:01] for some people the airport that they
[21:02] would get out at night and look at and
[21:04] see planes coming in would have existed
[21:06] a week ago and fast forward one week
[21:09] later the topography the landscape the
[21:12] atmosphere the noise the smoke the smell
[21:16] you you you can't walk the street the
[21:19] way you did a week ago the situation has
[21:21] changed
[21:23] and it makes us so conscious
[21:25] of how quickly things can happen in a
[21:28] natural and even how much more quickly
[21:31] could happen in the spiritual because
[21:33] god's prophet told us just overnight the
[21:36] power of god can sweep around the world
[21:38] just overnight we could be having a
[21:41] bible study tonight
[21:42] at next week tuesday we don't know if
[21:45] you're gonna have a bible study oh i
[21:46] want you to catch that tonight we don't
[21:47] know what one week from now holds we
[21:49] don't know what two weeks from now holds
[21:51] we don't know what a month from now
[21:52] holds because it could be that rapid
[21:57] so i just want to share a few things
[21:59] with us
[22:00] for a few minutes i don't intend to be
[22:02] too long
[22:03] but i want to touch on on a few things
[22:05] and then one scripture that we have
[22:07] looked at before
[22:09] but in light of recent events i was
[22:11] looking at it again and somehow it just
[22:13] resonated and i want to bring back you
[22:15] know some of it again
[22:17] so just to introduce it it is often said
[22:20] that you are the sum total
[22:23] of all of your experiences
[22:26] the good experiences
[22:28] the bad experiences
[22:31] all of this in combination
[22:33] is what makes you
[22:34] uniquely you
[22:36] when somebody meets you they may not
[22:38] know your story but you walk with your
[22:40] story
[22:42] you walk as a result of how you grow up
[22:45] the struggles you had to face the
[22:46] successes you enjoyed the failures you
[22:49] endured
[22:50] and in combination the equal sign
[22:53] it makes you uniquely you
[22:55] positioned to do certain things position
[22:58] to achieve certain things by virtue of
[23:01] what you have been through
[23:03] when we look at the achievements of
[23:05] certain people we can often trace back
[23:08] situations that led to the person that
[23:11] they are today
[23:12] we look at certain people and we could
[23:14] look back and see because of what their
[23:16] struggle was this is why they are the
[23:19] way they are
[23:21] and there's nothing wrong with that
[23:22] because that is something that is unique
[23:24] and it is a journey that people go
[23:25] through for many of these peoples these
[23:28] experiences are not deliberate we don't
[23:30] have control over the house that we are
[23:33] born in we don't have control of whether
[23:35] we are born into poverty or born into
[23:37] wealth we don't have control if we are
[23:40] born into a single parent home or uh a
[23:43] home with a mother and a father we don't
[23:45] have control if we grow up with our
[23:46] father alone or a mother alone all these
[23:49] things but all of these things add up to
[23:52] the character and the nature of who we
[23:54] are and how we respond to situations how
[23:56] we deal with situations how we resolve
[23:59] conflict and how we deal with
[24:02] challenges in this scenario the
[24:05] experiences are not deliberate it is not
[24:08] planned it is just how life unfolded and
[24:11] the unfolding of life led to
[24:14] the way a person moves so somebody
[24:16] didn't have much growing up so they they
[24:19] they they
[24:20] put certain things in a certain way
[24:21] because they never had and they don't
[24:23] want to ever go through their experience
[24:24] and not having so so they they conduct
[24:27] business a certain way
[24:28] i want to call these people the type one
[24:31] for the purpose of this little study
[24:33] tonight the type one the people who
[24:36] they are who they are because their
[24:37] lives just unfolded that way and it gave
[24:40] them a strength to do what they do
[24:44] well there's another type of person
[24:47] they are those who prepare all their
[24:49] lives for certain types of roles in life
[24:52] you don't just wake up in the morning
[24:55] and decide i am going to the olympics
[24:57] this year
[24:58] it doesn't work like that you need to
[25:00] train for it you need to study for it
[25:02] you need to practice for it you need to
[25:04] understand what it takes what it
[25:06] requires
[25:07] that is what it takes to achieve it and
[25:09] you work hard for it
[25:11] you don't wake up in the morning and
[25:13] decide i'm going to be a doctor today
[25:14] there's a process to become a doctor
[25:17] so let's call these people the type 2
[25:20] they who have prepared
[25:22] trained practice and sharpen their
[25:24] skills
[25:25] to be who they are so type one
[25:28] they are the ones who life unfold in a
[25:30] certain way and that's why they are the
[25:32] way they are
[25:33] type two those who prepare for a certain
[25:35] thing and they are who they are because
[25:38] of that
[25:39] tonight i don't want to speak about type
[25:41] 1 or type 2.
[25:43] tonight i want to speak about another
[25:44] type
[25:46] because sometimes just sometimes
[25:47] situations come that nothing in your
[25:50] past
[25:51] could have ever prepared you for it
[25:54] and you never had the opportunity
[25:56] to train for it
[25:58] i would like to call this type type
[26:00] three
[26:02] and to give context to this a little bit
[26:05] just
[26:06] building on recent events
[26:09] we don't have to look too far because
[26:11] just a few days ago
[26:13] on february 24th 2022
[26:16] russia invaded ukraine
[26:19] and almost seven days have passed
[26:21] in what
[26:22] by most reasonable expectations
[26:25] people didn't expect to take this long
[26:28] there are many levels we can discuss in
[26:30] this
[26:31] but i just wanted to share a few
[26:32] thoughts on this
[26:35] and see perhaps if there are any lessons
[26:37] we can learn for our lives
[26:40] but before i get into that i want to
[26:41] read
[26:42] a quote from the prophet in a message
[26:45] victory day
[26:47] whereby abraham was bringing out
[26:48] something and i want us to keep this as
[26:50] an anchor point before we go on
[26:53] but the brandon was saying nations want
[26:55] to see their own way
[26:57] germany wants to see their way alone
[27:00] russia wants to see their way alone
[27:02] america wants to see her way alone it's
[27:05] the spirit of the nations
[27:07] you find it wherever you go you find a
[27:09] national
[27:11] spirit
[27:12] he said it's so strange
[27:14] if i had the time i'd just like to skip
[27:17] through
[27:18] some of the nations and show you
[27:20] he said when you go into germany you
[27:22] find a military spirit everything is
[27:24] military you have to stand straight walk
[27:26] straight cut your corners everything is
[27:29] military you go into france you find any
[27:31] moral spirit woman wine liquor you're
[27:33] going to finland a loyal spirit you can
[27:35] go into america but the banana is
[27:36] running through different national
[27:38] spirits
[27:39] somebody tell a dirty joke and everybody
[27:41] laugh at it and he goes on
[27:43] listen to this
[27:45] and then those spirits get jealous of
[27:47] one another
[27:49] you see and when those spirits get
[27:51] jealous of another spirit
[27:54] what do they do they cause war that's
[27:56] right
[27:57] and you see every nation is controlled
[28:00] by satan
[28:01] the bible said so he is god of the
[28:03] nations satan took jesus up top the
[28:06] mountain and show them all the kingdoms
[28:08] of the world and say these are mine i do
[28:10] with them anything i want i'll give them
[28:13] to you if you worship me
[28:15] so
[28:16] there are multiple levels like i said of
[28:18] this thing
[28:20] all right so and listen carefully now
[28:23] but the balance says when god comes
[28:25] again and takes his kingdom see there
[28:27] will not be any different kinds of
[28:30] spirit a german spirit a friend spirit a
[28:32] norwegian spirit an american spirit
[28:35] there won't be that it'll be one spirit
[28:38] the spirit of god living in every heart
[28:41] there'll be one flag
[28:42] one nation one people a brotherhood a
[28:46] fatherhood of god and a brotherhood of
[28:48] men sonship
[28:51] then we find that because that people do
[28:53] this and called all these fusses and all
[28:55] these things and then he types it into
[28:58] matthew 24.
[29:01] verse 6 and he shall hear wars and
[29:03] rumors of wars see
[29:05] listen and this this this is your
[29:07] encouragement and you shall hear of wars
[29:09] and rumors of wars see that ye be not
[29:11] troubled
[29:14] for all these things must come to pass
[29:16] but the end is not yet
[29:19] for nations shall rise against nation it
[29:22] is not perhaps is that maybe this is
[29:24] jesus's words nations shall rise against
[29:27] nation and kingdom against kingdom and
[29:30] there shall be famine and pestilences
[29:33] and earthquakes and diverse places all
[29:35] these are the beginning of sorrows
[29:39] so what we are seeing is just the
[29:40] beginning of sorrows i hope this
[29:43] resonates tonight
[29:44] just a short encouragement to you
[29:47] then shall they deliver you up to be
[29:49] afflicted and shall kill you and you
[29:50] shall be hated of all nations for my
[29:52] name's sake and then many and then shall
[29:56] many be offended and shall betray one
[29:58] another and shall hate one another and
[30:00] many false prophets shall rise and shall
[30:02] deceive many and because iniquity shall
[30:05] abound the love of many shall walk
[30:07] schooled
[30:09] but he that shall endure unto the end
[30:11] the same shall be saved and this gospel
[30:14] of the kingdom
[30:15] shall be preached in all the world for a
[30:18] witness unto all nations and then the
[30:21] end shall come
[30:23] so i wanted you to pain this as a
[30:25] context because before going further i
[30:28] want us to really realize that behind
[30:31] everything that's happening right now
[30:32] are spiritual forces
[30:35] so while you can pick up the news and
[30:38] read about the united nations and the
[30:40] european union and nato and governments
[30:42] and all these things the reality is
[30:44] they're only two influences and they're
[30:46] only spiritual works and all of these
[30:49] organizations that exist are really the
[30:52] manifestations of of the spiritual realm
[30:55] that is bringing us closer to leaving
[30:57] this place
[30:58] i don't want us to lose sight of that
[31:01] because this allows us to
[31:02] not even from a spiritual perspective
[31:04] try to take a side with anything the
[31:06] reality is we understanding that satan
[31:09] is ruling what's happening
[31:11] and at the same time god has an agenda a
[31:13] program that i believe is happening
[31:15] right now in this room to prepare a
[31:17] bride to leave this place by placing you
[31:20] into his body to give you power because
[31:23] you will need power anybody believe that
[31:25] tonight
[31:28] but just to come back into context to
[31:30] deal with what's going on
[31:33] we have a situation as you all know
[31:35] where russia a country with 144
[31:39] million people
[31:41] and arguably
[31:43] the world's largest reserve of nuclear
[31:46] weapons
[31:49] an army of over two million
[31:52] more tanks planes etc that you can count
[31:55] invaded a country with just 44 million
[31:57] people
[31:58] with almost no kind of weaponry to match
[32:03] and if you were looking at it on paper
[32:06] it should have been an obvious situation
[32:08] of who would win
[32:11] but for some reason it just hasn't
[32:13] panned out that way and what may have
[32:15] been
[32:16] expected that it should be a quick
[32:18] victory has not been so
[32:22] we have only one hand a powerful nation
[32:24] with his armory it's artillery its
[32:27] sophisticated system and its leader who
[32:30] has military
[32:32] espionage experience and a country that
[32:35] is smaller with a president who up to
[32:39] just a few years ago his job was a
[32:41] comedian
[32:43] it's a paradox
[32:45] how these things unfold i'm not going to
[32:47] spend too much time
[32:48] on these characters
[32:51] there are some lessons that i want to
[32:52] identify
[32:54] because in life and we have to
[32:56] appreciate this life is not fear
[33:01] war is not fear
[33:04] situations are not fear
[33:07] and there are times in life it may
[33:09] appear that you have an advantage
[33:11] and there are times in life it will
[33:13] appear you have a disadvantage
[33:15] there is no question from a surface of
[33:18] looking at this situation that ukraine
[33:21] would appear to have a disadvantage
[33:25] the odds would be against them
[33:27] they have a smaller army they have a
[33:29] smaller population they have a less
[33:31] experienced
[33:33] leader
[33:34] up to how many years ago five six years
[33:36] ago he wasn't even into politics against
[33:38] a nation that had existed for very long
[33:41] with military mighty experience with a
[33:42] leader who has been a leader for a long
[33:45] time
[33:46] and it has caught the eye because even
[33:49] for me looking at my own life and seeing
[33:52] i spent some time studying the linksy
[33:55] because it just blew my mind where he
[33:57] came from
[33:59] what makes this man
[34:00] because he doesn't have the military
[34:02] experience and i was saying to my wife
[34:05] look how
[34:07] your situation in the past
[34:09] really can't stop you from becoming
[34:11] something
[34:13] he was not a general he didn't grow up
[34:15] in the army he didn't cheat and train
[34:17] for this he didn't prepare for this but
[34:20] he is in a position of leadership with
[34:22] choices and decisions to make
[34:25] and he is making it
[34:27] but ovid would have referenced our
[34:28] conversation that we had when i said
[34:31] they tried to extract him he said you
[34:33] and your family can take you or they say
[34:35] i don't need a ride i need more weapons
[34:38] this is not a fighter this is a man who
[34:40] is fighting for a reason
[34:43] and it stirred my heart because it began
[34:45] to me ask question do we have a reason
[34:47] to fight
[34:50] what
[34:51] in our lives or around our lives do we
[34:54] count worth fighting for
[34:57] because many of us in a situation like
[34:59] that if given the opportunity to jump in
[35:02] a plane and fly out we will take it
[35:04] we may take it
[35:06] because it's the easy way out
[35:08] what makes some people take the easy way
[35:10] out and some people take the risk of
[35:13] the hard way
[35:15] young president is quoted as saying if i
[35:17] have to die i'll die here with my
[35:19] soldiers
[35:22] and it shakes you to the core because
[35:24] that is real we
[35:26] we sing songs of it's dripping with
[35:28] blood and we reference the disciples and
[35:30] those who went through the ages who died
[35:32] for this gospel and i found myself
[35:35] asking the question
[35:36] are there people still around
[35:38] for whom this gospel is worth dying for
[35:45] because the people who are in ukraine it
[35:48] is mind-blowing i was having a
[35:49] conversation with a few of the version
[35:50] after church there was an accountant
[35:51] there and he said i never had a gun in
[35:53] my life
[35:55] if you asked me two days ago if i would
[35:57] be doing this you wouldn't even he said
[36:00] i can't even understand it two days
[36:02] later i don't even know if you know how
[36:03] to shoot
[36:06] but he has found a reason to fight
[36:09] so for a few minutes this evening i have
[36:12] a little thought
[36:14] conflict crisis and leadership
[36:17] conflict
[36:18] crisis and leadership
[36:22] because it is one thing that conflict
[36:24] and crisis would bring out
[36:26] is leadership
[36:29] choices
[36:30] decisions
[36:32] so far they are mapping those and
[36:34] there's nothing wrong with deciding to
[36:36] flee and to run into the border that is
[36:39] perfectly fine but if you analyze the
[36:41] numbers out of a population of 44
[36:44] million people in ukraine
[36:46] i don't even think it has reached half a
[36:48] million has fled
[36:49] which means at this point in time over
[36:52] 40 million people are standing around
[36:54] saying listen if you want this you have
[36:56] to take me with it
[37:00] that is a resolute choice a decision
[37:03] that i want us to look at
[37:06] because
[37:07] is your family spiritually worth
[37:09] fighting for
[37:12] is your soul worth fighting for
[37:15] are you prepared to give up
[37:17] your comfort zone because the accountant
[37:19] who was interviewed he gonna say i'm
[37:21] unaccounted i'm not ready for this
[37:24] and in talking about type 1 type 2 on
[37:26] type 3
[37:28] the ukrainian people without training
[37:30] without preparation have been forced to
[37:33] fight because they find a that's bigger
[37:36] than them
[37:38] i saw a picture of an 80 year old man
[37:40] who said he's fighting for his grandkids
[37:44] and we have
[37:46] young people who don't understand for
[37:48] the truth of this gospel
[37:50] they see no legacy they're just
[37:53] comfortable because these situations in
[37:55] their lives have not been rocked enough
[37:58] to create a crisis or conflict to demand
[38:01] leadership
[38:02] to demand a choice that i am not going
[38:04] to give my life to the world there's a
[38:07] reason to fight
[38:08] to live a holy life there's a reason to
[38:10] fight for righteousness
[38:12] i'm not speaking about natural war i'm
[38:13] talking about fighting for your soul for
[38:16] your house and so me and my house
[38:19] in interviewing them you have men
[38:21] standing in front of their apartment
[38:23] building because their families are
[38:24] inside and they say if they have to get
[38:26] to my family they need to go through me
[38:28] where are the spiritual men who say they
[38:30] want to get to my family i have to go to
[38:32] my wall of prayer
[38:37] conflict
[38:38] crisis
[38:39] and leadership
[38:42] what are you willing to fight for
[38:44] tonight
[38:46] what are you willing to die before
[38:48] tonight
[38:50] we speak of the disciples of all who are
[38:52] willing to die for this gospel how much
[38:55] are you willing to sacrifice
[38:59] how long will we make excuses of what we
[39:02] don't know
[39:03] and what we don't have
[39:05] and the reality is it is something that
[39:07] is such a unique paradox
[39:11] just like david against goliath goliath
[39:13] did not think when he looked at david
[39:16] david was a threat
[39:18] and so too
[39:19] the news anchors and the media is
[39:21] carrying the fact that the expectation
[39:24] was that the russian army would drive
[39:27] into ukraine
[39:30] but the ukrainians there was one story
[39:31] told of a certain bridge
[39:34] and the soldiers ukrainian soldiers at
[39:36] the bridge said we cannot allow
[39:39] the russians to advance over this bridge
[39:43] and one of the young soldiers was going
[39:44] to set up a bomb and he said there's not
[39:47] enough time to get away if this bomb
[39:49] explodes
[39:51] another young man said don't worry about
[39:52] it
[39:54] and he explored the bomb and he died
[39:55] with it and right there they shut down
[39:58] the advance of the enemy
[40:01] he was willing to die
[40:03] so that they don't advance
[40:08] the only thing that can make you do that
[40:10] is because you believe in something more
[40:11] than you
[40:16] it speaks of deep sacrifice and it's a
[40:19] stirring thing i'm not going to be too
[40:20] long with you
[40:22] but if he was a selfish person
[40:26] if he couldn't see the bigger picture
[40:30] if he couldn't see beyond himself
[40:32] and these are the things that have
[40:33] become unexpected
[40:37] can you move in an unexpected way and
[40:40] change the course of your house
[40:42] of your situation
[40:44] moses had excuses and god had to shut
[40:47] him up and say he's still going
[40:50] anybody with me what is your why is this
[40:53] a few questions we're just having a
[40:54] conversation tonight before we get into
[40:56] one scripture that we have read before
[40:58] but what is your why
[41:00] because that there represents the
[41:02] difference in the reason for fighting
[41:04] we have a situation now where soldiers
[41:07] out of russia are are fighting because
[41:09] of the only payroll
[41:12] they are commanded to go in
[41:14] but ukrainians their why is very
[41:16] different
[41:17] the reason they are fighting is because
[41:19] this is my father's house
[41:21] my child
[41:22] this is my land i grew up here
[41:27] i'm doing this for my children are doing
[41:29] this for my family
[41:30] i send my wife out but as a as a man and
[41:34] this is my house i don't like nobody
[41:35] take me the why is very different than
[41:36] you why creates a a drive
[41:40] with limitations
[41:42] to do what has never been done before
[41:45] are you willing to fight for your house
[41:50] but let me even go deeper because the
[41:51] reality is
[41:53] we are challenging in this meeting here
[41:54] tonight
[41:56] to fight
[41:57] are you willing to fight for your health
[42:00] some of us take our health for granted
[42:05] so it's not just a spiritual challenge
[42:07] here tonight it's a challenge to us as
[42:09] individuals
[42:12] to be the best that we can do are you
[42:14] willing to fight for your health are you
[42:16] willing to fight for your financial
[42:17] future are you willing to fight for your
[42:19] prayer life this is a different kind of
[42:21] bible study tonight
[42:23] are you willing to fight for your prayer
[42:25] life
[42:25] to fight for your prayer life means you
[42:28] have to make a choice of what needs to
[42:30] be sacrificed to pray
[42:32] you can't spend all your time at work
[42:35] and all the time doing other things and
[42:37] and not have time to to pray because it
[42:39] means you are not doing enough fighting
[42:43] are you willing to fight for spiritual
[42:44] breakthrough
[42:46] are you willing to fight for the
[42:47] unexpected are you willing to be
[42:49] unexpected
[42:57] i saw that the ukrainians ordered
[43:00] the country to
[43:02] take down these street signs
[43:04] point the street signs in another
[43:06] direction
[43:07] to confuse the russians and then google
[43:10] turn off google maps so if they were
[43:12] trying to use google maps they get lost
[43:15] if they're trying to follow these street
[43:16] signs they get lost
[43:18] it is a paradox when you look at the
[43:21] unfolding of this thing how the world
[43:23] could crumble and these things take
[43:24] place but the reality is i am not sure
[43:28] they expected these street signs to be
[43:29] turned around
[43:31] i'm not sure in innovation they expected
[43:33] the google map system to go down
[43:35] and the question you have to challenge
[43:36] yourself with
[43:38] because when shamga by the random typed
[43:40] out got frustrated with the philistines
[43:43] taken
[43:44] from him he took her ox gold and ran out
[43:47] to the enemy but branham said
[43:51] and he did what was unexpected in know
[43:54] they thought in themselves what this
[43:56] crazy man coming to do with this obvious
[43:58] good
[43:59] and the bible said he slew 600
[44:02] with the ox good
[44:04] so he didn't approach them in a way they
[44:06] expected david didn't approach goliath
[44:09] anyway goliath expected even goliath had
[44:12] to ask the question am i a dog
[44:14] because the only way you'll be
[44:16] approaching something looking like that
[44:17] is if you're approaching a dog so am i a
[44:19] dog that that's how you're coming to me
[44:21] but the reality is david
[44:24] approach in an unexpected way
[44:27] so i want to challenge our thinking now
[44:29] sometimes we get tired of trying to do
[44:32] things a certain way
[44:34] but when your back becomes against a
[44:36] wall you need to figure out new ways and
[44:38] new things and it just blows my mind the
[44:41] innovation and the creativity and the
[44:43] ideas and your approach
[44:47] through the attack the internet when
[44:49] known
[44:50] in ukraine
[44:52] ukraine messaged elon musk the center to
[44:55] send internet a satellite moves in space
[44:58] comes over the country internet restored
[45:03] how do you piece these things together
[45:04] but the reality is the point i'm making
[45:06] here is at no point in time are they
[45:09] saying let's give up
[45:11] let's stop fighting
[45:13] let's stop figuring out are we
[45:16] and i want to challenge us from we don't
[45:18] know how this thing will play out you
[45:19] know but it's one thing i admire it is
[45:22] we are not giving up we will find a way
[45:25] if this don't work we try something else
[45:27] if this don't work we try something else
[45:29] if this don't work we try something else
[45:30] but whatever it is we want to make it to
[45:33] the other side
[45:36] question
[45:37] what do you do when the odds are against
[45:40] you
[45:42] what do you do when you are not expected
[45:45] to win
[45:48] what do you do when you are less than
[45:50] someone else
[45:54] because that's the reality of life
[45:57] and we are all faced with situations and
[46:00] challenges that force us in the face of
[46:03] conflict and crisis to figure out the
[46:06] next step
[46:09] not just accept life and situations the
[46:12] way it has been for a long time but look
[46:15] up square your head your strollers and
[46:17] say i'm not giving up
[46:20] things might be bad but it could have
[46:22] been worse
[46:24] i trust this encourage you in some way
[46:26] to really look at your family to look at
[46:29] where you are at right now to look at
[46:31] because it has nothing to do with your
[46:33] past anymore it is the current situation
[46:36] where you are now and where you want to
[46:38] be
[46:40] conflict and crisis demands leadership
[46:45] and i love leadership as a topic of
[46:47] study because kingdoms rise and fall on
[46:50] leadership
[46:51] companies rise and fall on leadership
[46:54] churches rise and fall on leadership
[46:57] families rise and fall on leadership
[46:59] teams and departments rise and fall on
[47:02] leadership marriage rise and fall on
[47:05] leadership
[47:07] and all of us
[47:09] are leaders in different ways even if it
[47:11] is just to lead our tongues
[47:14] even if it is just to lead our emotions
[47:17] and bring it under subjection
[47:19] anybody with me tonight
[47:22] what are you prepared
[47:24] to do
[47:27] so in looking at
[47:29] this situation that has unfolded
[47:32] i found myself drawn once again to
[47:35] nehemiah
[47:38] because i find that zilling caesar is an
[47:41] unlikely general so to speak
[47:45] he is being forged from being a comedian
[47:48] and when he read his story he was
[47:50] he had a tv show or a movie or a series
[47:53] called his wonderful people
[47:54] just as an actor his his role in the tv
[47:57] show as a comedian was he was playing
[47:59] the president
[48:02] and the people there became so fed up of
[48:04] the pavilion government
[48:06] that the tv production crew the senator
[48:09] registered political party with the name
[48:10] of the tv show i want you to think of
[48:12] the paradox of this thing
[48:14] they say the memory tv show is servant
[48:16] of the people
[48:17] let us name the political party servant
[48:19] of the people
[48:20] and the star of the show let him run for
[48:22] president and he won by a 73 percent
[48:26] vote
[48:28] unlikely leader
[48:31] now in a war
[48:33] many of us trust into situations where
[48:37] unlikely to succeed
[48:40] odds are against us
[48:42] things didn't work out the way we
[48:43] thought it would but we are in a battle
[48:46] we are in a war
[48:47] and so too nehemiah when we remember
[48:50] because we studied this last year me
[48:52] when i looked at spiritual leadership
[48:55] and we started with the fact that
[48:56] nehemiah was the king's kabira
[49:00] trusted by the king he had a prayer life
[49:03] he was not in jerusalem but he had a
[49:06] burden what was happening in jerusalem
[49:08] and when he heard a word of how bad
[49:10] things were when he heard word of the
[49:12] situation there it killed something in
[49:15] his heart i don't know if you remember
[49:16] this
[49:17] and it came out so much in his heart
[49:19] that the bible said he had never before
[49:22] been sad in front of the king
[49:24] his disposition was always happy his
[49:26] disposition was always positive whenever
[49:29] you see nehemiah as a positive person
[49:32] and the king took note of nehemiah's
[49:34] disposition
[49:36] and said
[49:37] what is wrong with you because i know
[49:38] you're not sick
[49:41] because the only way you could be
[49:42] looking sad is if you're sick
[49:45] so this have to be something deeper than
[49:46] sickness because i know you're not sick
[49:48] but if it is sad it has to be sore of
[49:50] heart
[49:53] and the bible says nehemiah prayed
[49:56] and he was a praying man
[49:58] and he prayed in his response
[50:00] and when the king asked nehemiah what
[50:02] you want the bible said he prayed again
[50:05] and i would have taught last time that
[50:07] what kind of prayer was this
[50:09] that nehemiah prayed when the king asked
[50:11] him it wasn't
[50:12] a timeout king let me go and pray and
[50:14] come back it meant that nehemiah's
[50:16] relationship with god
[50:19] was in such a condition that he was
[50:22] talking to god and saying lord just give
[50:24] me the right words
[50:26] he knew what he wanted he knew his knee
[50:28] the king was in a position to
[50:30] grant his request
[50:32] and he came and said what you want
[50:34] because this sadness that's over you
[50:37] i want to relieve this sadness and i
[50:39] want to challenge you tonight if there's
[50:41] conflict and crisis in your life
[50:44] and god we know is here tonight what to
[50:46] say to you tonight tell me what your
[50:48] issue is what you want what i could do
[50:50] for you are you in a position tonight to
[50:53] say lord this is what i need
[50:56] this is the situation this is what i've
[50:58] been praying about or are you saying
[51:00] lord i have a situation and i really and
[51:02] you just shrug at the side because that
[51:04] was the name
[51:06] he was able to say lord this is what i
[51:08] need i need this i need this i need this
[51:10] i need this i need this specifically
[51:12] because i want to go and deal with this
[51:14] crisis this conflict this situation
[51:20] there's nothing wrong church friends
[51:22] with having a demon crisis and conflict
[51:24] it is a part of life
[51:28] we all have situations that are crisis
[51:31] and conflict
[51:33] family issues
[51:34] work issues financial issues crisis and
[51:38] conflict things just aren't working out
[51:40] things not the way it is
[51:42] that's not the issue because that's life
[51:44] the issue is can you
[51:47] subject yourself to god's leadership and
[51:50] also be a leader in the midst of the
[51:52] crisis in the midst of the conflict in
[51:54] this situation can you do the right
[51:56] thing can you say the right thing can
[51:58] you ask for the right thing
[52:00] for four months nehemiah was praying for
[52:03] a way to get back to jerusalem to help
[52:05] his people
[52:08] are you praying are you seeking are you
[52:10] crying are you
[52:12] why are you seeing all these things
[52:13] happening around you and you're caught
[52:14] up in the news but but there's no change
[52:16] in your walking you're talking your life
[52:17] in your way
[52:20] i'm not going to be too much longer with
[52:21] you
[52:23] much of this is not new to you
[52:25] but i want to challenge you i want to
[52:27] see the leader in all of you the leader
[52:29] that can decide what to do and what not
[52:31] to do
[52:34] some of us have lost our way
[52:37] and the comfort of the things we know is
[52:39] what we think will carry us through
[52:42] we know what brother branham said we
[52:44] know what the bible said we know this
[52:45] and our knowledge
[52:47] knowledge is not a passport into where
[52:49] we need to go
[52:52] it's a change in our lives in the face
[52:54] of situations that demand more from us
[52:57] in how we deal with our families our
[52:59] loved ones the workplace news
[53:01] information our priorities
[53:05] i don't know if this is helping anybody
[53:08] but i look at nehemiah he was a cobiera
[53:11] who became a general
[53:15] i don't want to make and type better but
[53:18] here we have a comedian who was becoming
[53:20] a general by force he didn't choose it
[53:23] david didn't apply to be king you know
[53:26] he didn't put you a job application
[53:28] there was no vacancy that he submitted a
[53:30] resume for
[53:31] he was thrust by god into kingship
[53:35] let me say it again david didn't apply
[53:37] for opposition
[53:40] come on now paul who became soul didn't
[53:43] apply for the position
[53:45] or you don't hear me tonight he was
[53:47] chosen for the position
[53:49] just as you have been chosen for the
[53:51] position and that seemed david who was
[53:54] chosen for the position saul take a a
[53:57] spear and throw after him he still had
[54:00] crisis and conflict
[54:02] still had to run for his life and solo
[54:03] to kill him didn't change the fact that
[54:05] god shows him for the position and
[54:08] allowed crisis and conflict to exist in
[54:11] and around his life
[54:14] all the way through his life was crisis
[54:16] and conflict
[54:17] bathsheba crisis and conflict come on
[54:20] now his son after him to kill him crisis
[54:23] and conflict
[54:24] down to the end of his death bed he had
[54:27] to get natan and different ones to make
[54:29] sure that solomon was going to be named
[54:30] king crisis and conflict in the face of
[54:33] adversity in the face of his enemies
[54:36] the psalm speaks of the crisis and
[54:38] conflict that david had many idea that
[54:40] rise against me may i do that see of my
[54:42] soul there's no help for him and god
[54:43] crisis and conflict but yet in the midst
[54:46] of crisis and conflict it demands a
[54:49] certain level of leadership
[54:52] where are the leaders in marriages when
[54:54] there's crisis and conflict in marriage
[54:57] where are the leaders in the home when
[54:59] there's crisis and conflict in in
[55:02] siblings and brothers and sisters
[55:04] anybody with me
[55:09] who will be the bigger person who will
[55:11] be the leader who will lead towards a
[55:13] resolution a solution a target
[55:20] there's always an easy way out you know
[55:24] it blows my mind because
[55:27] i'm thinking
[55:28] zelinski was offered listen we would
[55:30] sign a plane and take you in a family
[55:32] out
[55:33] most of us take the easy way out of life
[55:37] that's human nature you know
[55:41] we take the easy way out we like the
[55:44] shortcut we don't want to do the work we
[55:46] don't want to put any time we want to
[55:47] know seven secrets to millionaire
[55:50] and forty years
[55:53] we hold on to these stories how this man
[55:56] became a success in five days all the
[55:58] foolishness
[56:00] because we want this shortcut
[56:03] and we don't want the character
[56:05] formation that comes from it
[56:08] i would say say it to my wife recently
[56:11] people hold on to different things they
[56:13] say um mark zuckerberg dropped out of
[56:15] school bill gates dropped this you know
[56:17] what school he dropped out of
[56:20] he didn't drop what a primary school in
[56:22] them
[56:23] then boys dropped a harvard university
[56:26] you know how hard it is to get into
[56:27] harvard
[56:30] it's not dropper because they don't want
[56:31] to do work
[56:32] it's because they got caught up and
[56:34] anointed for certain kind of work
[56:37] you have young people who never put no
[56:38] work in and say well if you could jump
[56:40] with a school and become a billionaire
[56:42] but that is why so many of them drop at
[56:44] the school and they make nothing with
[56:45] themselves
[56:46] because they never understood the effort
[56:48] and the time and the sacrifice that
[56:51] these people put in to be where they are
[56:52] now
[56:54] it is a process
[56:58] you have to acknowledge the process
[57:01] nehemiah was a prayer warrior can you be
[57:03] described as a prayer warrior
[57:07] is there a memorial that's written about
[57:09] your prayers
[57:13] so that in the time of crisis and
[57:14] conflict your prayers the vile of your
[57:17] prayers can be poured on top of your
[57:18] lord are needed no
[57:20] and you can make a withdrawal from the
[57:22] vial of your prayers and sword up all
[57:24] these years for your children for your
[57:25] son for your daughter for your marriage
[57:27] for your house for your finances for
[57:29] your need i don't know if this helping
[57:30] ceremony tonight but oh god help us help
[57:32] us help us because crisis and conflict
[57:34] it's gonna get worse these are the
[57:36] beginning of sorrows
[57:39] there's more pain coming
[57:41] think of it friends
[57:43] we went through two years you were with
[57:45] your two years of pain pain that even
[57:47] affected the all realms with the
[57:50] pandemic and then there's war friends i
[57:53] want you to appreciate the levels of
[57:54] this thing
[57:56] many may not understand that ukraine
[57:58] is one of the world's largest exporters
[58:00] of wheat
[58:04] russia is a major exporter of wheat
[58:08] right now oil prices are rising because
[58:10] supply lines have been cut
[58:12] when oil price rises when there's a
[58:14] wheat shortage that affects every
[58:16] country in the world you know so this
[58:18] war is not ukraine and russia this war
[58:21] is going to hit your pocket
[58:24] because there are economic effects of
[58:26] these things all of this is by design
[58:29] but i wanted to understand that god is
[58:31] allowing things to unfold because a new
[58:34] world order has to come
[58:37] that has to run in parallel with the
[58:38] forming of a lady an elect lady who is
[58:41] to come into power who is to reign on
[58:43] this earth called mrs jesus christ
[58:48] and it's not a fair fight
[58:52] is that a fair fight
[58:55] because we already conquered these
[58:57] stories already written
[58:58] we walk into the playbook
[59:02] everybody who is in this thing are doing
[59:03] their part of it i want to make sure we
[59:06] know we have a part in this thing and we
[59:08] have to do our part and our part is to
[59:11] get ready our pakistan is to put on that
[59:14] robe of righteousness oh come on now
[59:16] that robe of perfection that robe of
[59:19] holiness
[59:23] because that she'll be a pure she'll be
[59:25] a virgin she'll be a chase sin will not
[59:27] be able to stay in that church
[59:31] we can talk about russia for the week
[59:32] until we get sent out to church we have
[59:34] more work to do
[59:35] oh come on now somebody help me somebody
[59:37] help me tonight
[59:39] we can speak about the vibes any world
[59:40] war one
[59:41] come on now whoa whoa we can spend all
[59:44] the time until we get his sin out of the
[59:46] church until he's staking your heart
[59:48] gets dealt with until i give you a new
[59:50] spirit i put my spirit i change you
[59:52] until these things take place
[59:55] it is it is verbal gymnastics as the
[59:57] pastor would say
[59:59] we're spinning around words trying to
[1:00:01] pull from here in the end here what
[1:00:02] means a change and i pray that the
[1:00:05] crisis and conflict over the last few
[1:00:07] years and and the crisis uncovered
[1:00:09] that's coming more become more welcome
[1:00:11] because he said then when we need it
[1:00:14] god raises standard
[1:00:16] so things have to get worse and worse
[1:00:21] hallelujah anybody with me tonight
[1:00:24] is this is this helping anybody to shake
[1:00:27] us into the reality and consciousness
[1:00:29] that is sealing time is on
[1:00:31] and that stealing time is not brother
[1:00:34] over evaluating you is that the pastor
[1:00:36] evaluating you it is it is is the income
[1:00:39] right
[1:00:41] doing his investigation
[1:00:44] when you least expect it
[1:00:47] and when trouble come the words that
[1:00:48] come out your bounty is not worth that
[1:00:50] supposed to be spoken because you can't
[1:00:51] deal with crisis and conflict
[1:00:56] oh yes oh yes oh yes
[1:00:59] i would have said it when we were
[1:01:00] speaking about nehemiah and the teaching
[1:01:02] and i might share back the link again
[1:01:04] because there's some lessons in there
[1:01:07] nehemiah's the fourth response to every
[1:01:09] situation was pray
[1:01:14] you know when your phone goes bad
[1:01:16] you can reset it to factory settings
[1:01:19] the default settings before you it's all
[1:01:21] abstanding and what can i send you a
[1:01:23] mess of the phone and
[1:01:25] you can restore the phone to factory
[1:01:26] settings
[1:01:28] well nehemiah's his settings his
[1:01:30] default operation was pray
[1:01:33] what is your default operation where's
[1:01:35] your standard operating procedure where
[1:01:37] is he playable when people see you
[1:01:40] what do they see i don't know if this
[1:01:41] helping anybody tonight
[1:01:46] crisis and conflicts
[1:01:48] friends
[1:01:49] increasingly
[1:01:51] we will be put into situations where we
[1:01:54] have not been there before
[1:01:57] increasingly we will find ourselves in
[1:02:00] situations where we could have not think
[1:02:02] we were prepared for it that's how life
[1:02:05] is
[1:02:08] david could have referenced the lion and
[1:02:10] the bear and that helped give him defeat
[1:02:13] the goliath but david didn't say but you
[1:02:16] are the second goliath
[1:02:21] his excuse with goliath was his first
[1:02:23] time dealing with that particular
[1:02:25] situation
[1:02:26] and you have to change your attitude and
[1:02:28] approach to dealing with different
[1:02:30] situations
[1:02:32] it's easy to say
[1:02:34] i can't list listen friends i'll be
[1:02:37] honest i find myself there at times you
[1:02:39] know
[1:02:40] i'm not teaching you from a position of
[1:02:41] strength you know i'm teaching my
[1:02:43] opposition i'm fighting my way out of a
[1:02:45] trench in in a whole trying to anybody
[1:02:48] with me
[1:02:50] facing situations that you never faced
[1:02:52] before and you have to do what figure it
[1:02:55] out
[1:02:58] work it out sort it out find a way
[1:03:05] anybody with me
[1:03:07] so you have to have a mindset and this
[1:03:09] is the mindset there has to be a way
[1:03:11] because god is a waymaker even if i
[1:03:13] don't anyway yet it's just to find it
[1:03:15] because away must exist because god
[1:03:18] don't ever leave a situation where
[1:03:20] there's no way
[1:03:21] maybe you haven't seen anywhere yet
[1:03:22] maybe you don't know the way maybe
[1:03:24] you're walking in the wrong direction
[1:03:26] but there must be a way and if you
[1:03:28] realize that there must be a way then
[1:03:30] you ask a different question lord show
[1:03:32] me the way
[1:03:34] not i don't know and i'm not sure and i
[1:03:37] give up and i fed up and i try this and
[1:03:39] i try it and i try to there must be a
[1:03:41] way because god is a waymaker if we can
[1:03:42] accept that he's away make up it means
[1:03:44] there must be a way maybe you haven't
[1:03:46] seen it yet maybe he didn't look in the
[1:03:48] right direction maybe he was facing the
[1:03:50] wrong way
[1:03:53] but if you acknowledge that he is the
[1:03:54] waymaker then the question changes the
[1:03:56] lord show me the way
[1:03:59] we could reference by the branham he
[1:04:00] said i was a guide i was a tracker i was
[1:04:02] a guide and i thought i could find my
[1:04:04] way he said i feel on the tree and he
[1:04:06] wouldn't know and then i found himself
[1:04:07] in the same place the jet walk
[1:04:10] he ran to the end of his ability to
[1:04:13] guide himself
[1:04:14] oh help me somebody
[1:04:16] his experience was not enough
[1:04:19] he needed the guide
[1:04:22] to show him
[1:04:24] how to get back home
[1:04:27] is there anybody lost the night you're
[1:04:29] lost your way
[1:04:31] not and and it may not be you you know
[1:04:33] but it could be you standing in a gap
[1:04:35] for your house
[1:04:38] lord my family lost the way
[1:04:41] but you're prepared tonight to fight for
[1:04:43] them
[1:04:44] like many of those in the war who
[1:04:45] fighting for the family they put them in
[1:04:48] the subway in the train station they put
[1:04:50] them on the ground because bombs falling
[1:04:52] but you can't go wrong there too because
[1:04:54] you can't allow the enemy to reach down
[1:04:56] there where they're at
[1:04:58] they're already down there
[1:05:00] they're in a situation in a condition
[1:05:01] what are you going to do
[1:05:03] what level of resistance will you mount
[1:05:06] against the demonic influences trying to
[1:05:08] take out your house
[1:05:09] you have a choice
[1:05:14] people find themselves learning to make
[1:05:16] molotov cocktails you never made it
[1:05:17] before
[1:05:19] people don't go to school to study for
[1:05:20] these things doctors lawyers engineers
[1:05:24] simple people teachers different ones
[1:05:26] i'm fighting with my house i'm fighting
[1:05:27] for my family friends don't give up on
[1:05:30] your house
[1:05:32] don't give up on your family don't give
[1:05:34] up on your children don't give up
[1:05:37] on those who are backslid don't give up
[1:05:39] on them
[1:05:40] fight for them
[1:05:43] fight for them as for me and my house we
[1:05:46] we we
[1:05:47] we will serve the lord the promises unto
[1:05:49] you and your children
[1:05:51] your word coverage unto them that are
[1:05:53] far off
[1:05:54] even as many as the lord shall call all
[1:05:56] these scriptures you could hold on to
[1:05:59] because before we leave this place
[1:06:01] there'll be another reckoning
[1:06:03] there'll be another shaking
[1:06:06] can the church say man
[1:06:09] i'm trying to find a place to wrap up
[1:06:10] here
[1:06:12] find this paradigm between this unlikely
[1:06:14] hero called nehemiah this unlikely
[1:06:17] leader called nehemiah
[1:06:20] it takes a great quality to be a great
[1:06:22] wife to be a great husband to be a great
[1:06:25] son not because your son mean your great
[1:06:28] son not because your husband means your
[1:06:29] great husband not because your wife
[1:06:31] makes you a great wife not because
[1:06:32] you're a worker make you a great worker
[1:06:34] what makes a great worker what makes a
[1:06:36] great son a great father a great deacon
[1:06:38] a great minister great usher a great
[1:06:40] worshiper a great musician
[1:06:42] it takes something more than normal it
[1:06:44] takes something more than just existing
[1:06:46] it takes you figuring it out doing it
[1:06:49] challenging yourself to do more
[1:06:55] not being ordinary
[1:06:58] if zelinski relied only on his
[1:07:01] experience all he would have to offer
[1:07:02] his jokes
[1:07:05] because that's where he came from he was
[1:07:06] a comedian
[1:07:11] but god loves to put us in uncomfortable
[1:07:13] situations
[1:07:14] to bring new things out of us that we
[1:07:16] didn't know were there
[1:07:19] gideon almighty man of allah he did not
[1:07:21] even know gideon did not know what was
[1:07:24] in him and what was going to come out of
[1:07:26] him
[1:07:27] you see me
[1:07:29] my tribe is his smallest striker let me
[1:07:31] give him a resume
[1:07:32] my tribe is the smallest tribe my family
[1:07:34] is the smallest family any tribe and i'm
[1:07:36] the smallest one in my house you have to
[1:07:38] be looking for either my bigger brother
[1:07:40] or you're looking for another child
[1:07:41] another family but he didn't know what
[1:07:44] was locked up in him
[1:07:46] and it took god to reveal to him who he
[1:07:48] was in the economy of god do you
[1:07:50] understand who you are after all these
[1:07:51] years you still want to be moving like a
[1:07:53] chicken when you're eager they still
[1:07:55] want to eat from the pig pen when your
[1:07:57] father is there looking out for you you
[1:07:59] prodigal sons can you come back home and
[1:08:01] fight
[1:08:04] is this helping anybody tonight
[1:08:06] i'm almost done
[1:08:11] i just want to
[1:08:14] quickly go back to nehemiah 4 if you
[1:08:16] have it
[1:08:18] we read this before
[1:08:19] what is a reminder to us
[1:08:24] and i just found myself looking at it
[1:08:25] because there is a particular verse
[1:08:27] in here
[1:08:28] that i just i want to get to
[1:08:31] that is my burden right now
[1:08:35] and i encourage you if they could find
[1:08:37] back that message spiritual leadership
[1:08:39] one the bible study i did in may last
[1:08:41] year because i had the foundation of
[1:08:43] this and i don't have time to go into it
[1:08:44] now
[1:08:45] but nehemiah 4
[1:08:47] is is when rebuilding
[1:08:50] started
[1:08:52] and back in nehemiah 2 is when stan
[1:08:55] balot and these fellas
[1:08:57] they they
[1:08:58] they are
[1:09:00] they were true in words at the time
[1:09:03] but here it was in nehemiah 4. it
[1:09:05] started to become more than words
[1:09:07] so nehemiah 4 verse 1. but it came to
[1:09:10] pass that when stan balot heard that we
[1:09:12] builded the wall in other words we're
[1:09:14] doing something about it because the
[1:09:16] issue was the wall was broken down the
[1:09:18] defenses was broken down
[1:09:21] nehemiah was bothered because jerusalem
[1:09:23] was always under attack and if there's
[1:09:25] no wall there's no defense there's no
[1:09:26] fortification you'll be wiped out
[1:09:28] friends if your home is not fortified if
[1:09:32] your life is unfortified do you
[1:09:34] understand that the invasion that's
[1:09:35] gonna right now in russia and ukraine is
[1:09:37] is really a shadow of a spiritual
[1:09:39] invasion taking place in homes right now
[1:09:42] in churches
[1:09:46] and people
[1:09:47] living life normal at realizing that
[1:09:50] demonic forces
[1:09:52] coming through the tv the internet
[1:09:54] tick-tock facebook all these things that
[1:09:55] infiltrate in your home your life
[1:09:57] saturating your mind your ideas your
[1:09:59] consciousness to distract you from your
[1:10:01] purpose
[1:10:02] where are your walls are you building
[1:10:04] walls to defend your house
[1:10:06] are you allowing everything to go in
[1:10:08] your house
[1:10:11] shame on you parents who are enablers of
[1:10:13] foolishness
[1:10:17] you are breaking on your own wall by not
[1:10:19] making your stand for what is right and
[1:10:21] what is truth
[1:10:25] but it came to pass that when somebody
[1:10:26] had heard
[1:10:27] that we builded a wall he was wrought
[1:10:29] don't you think the enemy would be angry
[1:10:31] when you take action
[1:10:33] against the possible invasion
[1:10:36] and took great ignition and mocked the
[1:10:38] jews
[1:10:40] and he spake before his brethren and the
[1:10:41] army of samaria and said what do these
[1:10:44] feeble jews will they fortify themselves
[1:10:48] will their sacrifice you hear the
[1:10:50] question i asked the beginning of the
[1:10:52] study what are you willing to sacrifice
[1:10:53] what do you want to die for will they
[1:10:54] make an end in a day will they revive
[1:10:57] the stones out of the heaps of the
[1:10:58] rubbish which are burned
[1:11:01] no tobiah the ammonite was by him so
[1:11:04] this is sambal expressing himself to buy
[1:11:07] his next him and he said even that was
[1:11:09] their bill if a fox go up he shall even
[1:11:12] break down their stone wall
[1:11:14] so the buyers say what they do when it's
[1:11:15] so flimsy it's so weak if a dog walk on
[1:11:18] it if i walking it it will break
[1:11:20] down
[1:11:21] this was psychological warfare
[1:11:24] this was words meant to deter progress
[1:11:28] this is you trying to achieve and
[1:11:30] somebody say you're wasting your time
[1:11:31] don't try to sing
[1:11:33] you're wasting your time don't try to
[1:11:34] heal your marriage you're wasting your
[1:11:36] time don't try to reach out to your son
[1:11:37] you're wasting any time don't do that do
[1:11:39] that and talk talk talk talk
[1:11:46] first four
[1:11:54] hear oh oh god this is nehemiah starts
[1:11:57] to pray
[1:11:59] so here he here here so nehemiah doesn't
[1:12:02] send back words for what he has heard
[1:12:06] but over has been saying it the last
[1:12:07] bible said i did was dealing with
[1:12:08] conflict
[1:12:10] name i had a choice you gotta say
[1:12:12] all they're saying that i and
[1:12:14] it's an argument
[1:12:16] he didn't respond to them
[1:12:18] he didn't go word for word sit for tat
[1:12:21] with him he turned to god his default
[1:12:23] response to every situation was let me
[1:12:25] talk to god about it
[1:12:28] hear oh our god for we are despised
[1:12:32] he said lord you hearing what is in
[1:12:35] i'm not going to answer them you hearing
[1:12:37] you hear that
[1:12:39] so when i wanted somebody to talk to
[1:12:41] about the situation
[1:12:42] go talk to god lord you hear what you
[1:12:44] say about me
[1:12:46] you will get in far less trouble in life
[1:12:48] if you take it to the lord
[1:12:51] don't tell anybody else take it to the
[1:12:53] lord
[1:12:55] hear o our god for we are despised and
[1:12:58] turn their reproach upon their own head
[1:13:00] in other words whatever preaches it when
[1:13:03] they curse you and you bless them their
[1:13:04] curse fall back on them and your
[1:13:06] blessing come back on you
[1:13:07] he said turn
[1:13:09] their reproach upon their own head
[1:13:11] and give them for a prey in the land of
[1:13:14] captivity in other words make them
[1:13:16] vulnerable in the land of captivity and
[1:13:18] cover not their iniquity in other words
[1:13:20] expose them and let not their sin be
[1:13:23] blotted out from before thee
[1:13:25] for they have provoked thee to anger
[1:13:27] before the builders because
[1:13:29] nehemiah is saying this is your work
[1:13:30] it's your business it is god's desire
[1:13:32] church that you'll be fortified
[1:13:36] a whole chapter in the book of ephesians
[1:13:38] is dedicated to put on the whole armor
[1:13:39] of god which is about fortification
[1:13:42] it is god's desire that you have a
[1:13:44] defense it is god's desire that you are
[1:13:45] protected it is god's business his work
[1:13:48] that you be protected from every kind of
[1:13:50] attack
[1:13:53] for they are provoked the anger before
[1:13:56] the builders in other words in front of
[1:13:58] the builders who working hard this talk
[1:14:00] is coming to the to them
[1:14:02] and they're not deterring jesse bellas
[1:14:04] they are provoking god with their words
[1:14:06] so
[1:14:08] the sex so built we the wall in the face
[1:14:11] of criticism
[1:14:12] in the face of family members who say i
[1:14:14] cannot do it in the face of your
[1:14:15] co-workers who say you can't make it as
[1:14:17] a christian so built we the wall
[1:14:21] and all the wall was joined together
[1:14:23] until they have there for the people had
[1:14:25] a mind to work
[1:14:28] is your mind set to this work
[1:14:31] hallelujah in the amplified it says for
[1:14:34] the people that are hard to work do you
[1:14:36] have a heart to build this world to
[1:14:38] build this kingdom
[1:14:40] to protect our houses and our children
[1:14:42] from the demonic influences
[1:14:45] a mining to work a hotel this is a
[1:14:48] serious thing not a casual thing so
[1:14:50] what's happening in the in the any realm
[1:14:52] of the wars and naturally is just signed
[1:14:54] to us to defend ourselves spiritually
[1:14:57] a mind to the work a mind to inquire
[1:15:00] about your brother about your sister a
[1:15:02] mind to extend your prayer have you
[1:15:04] extended your prayers your natural
[1:15:05] response to what's taking place anybody
[1:15:07] with me tonight
[1:15:12] friends over there people can't sleep
[1:15:13] normally
[1:15:16] i want you to think about it it is not
[1:15:18] normal
[1:15:21] you don't know this word you don't know
[1:15:22] that life
[1:15:25] if you close your eyes you don't need to
[1:15:26] see him tomorrow because you don't know
[1:15:28] you need to be prepared it's war
[1:15:31] some of us sleeping on our children
[1:15:33] sleeping on our home sleeping and the
[1:15:35] devil running circles around us
[1:15:41] verse seven but it came to pass
[1:15:43] that when san bala and tobiah and the
[1:15:46] arabians and the ammonites and the ash
[1:15:48] judaized heard that the walls of
[1:15:50] jerusalem were made up and that the
[1:15:53] breaches began to be stopped
[1:15:56] god help us are you stopping breaches
[1:16:00] are you stopping breaches the weak spots
[1:16:03] the open windows in your home that the
[1:16:04] enemy has been trying to slip in
[1:16:07] when they heard of the breaches began to
[1:16:09] be stopped that they were very wrought
[1:16:11] they were very angry and scot inspired
[1:16:14] all of them together to come and to
[1:16:16] fight against jerusalem and to hinder it
[1:16:20] this is same spirit is almost in
[1:16:21] parallel to these scriptures that
[1:16:23] barobra is reading on sunday that will
[1:16:25] lead to the great war when the world
[1:16:27] comes against israel
[1:16:32] they will all conspire
[1:16:34] to come against israel the people of god
[1:16:37] verse nine nevertheless
[1:16:41] we made our prayer unto our god
[1:16:44] you see again leading with prayer you
[1:16:46] see why prem you think that's so
[1:16:47] important
[1:16:51] nevertheless in other words in the face
[1:16:54] of the knowledge that the enemy was
[1:16:56] conspiring and uniting against us our
[1:16:59] default initial response nevertheless we
[1:17:01] made our prayer unto our god
[1:17:04] and set a watch against them day and
[1:17:07] night because of them
[1:17:09] in other words we're not sitting and let
[1:17:11] it happen to us we're doing something
[1:17:13] about it we're setting a watch against
[1:17:15] them day and night because of them
[1:17:18] and judah said the strength of the
[1:17:20] bearers of burdens is decade and there
[1:17:22] is so much rubbish so that we are not
[1:17:24] able to build a wall and our adversaries
[1:17:28] said they shall not know neither see
[1:17:30] till we come in the midst among them and
[1:17:32] slay them and cause the work to cease
[1:17:34] stood so judah is saying is a lot of
[1:17:36] work and the enemy is watching they
[1:17:38] shall not know neither see what's going
[1:17:40] on until we come and it came to pass
[1:17:41] that when the jews which dwelt by them
[1:17:44] came they said unto us ten times from
[1:17:46] all places when you shall return unto us
[1:17:48] they will be upon you in other words the
[1:17:50] voices around them
[1:17:53] despite the fact that they prayed the
[1:17:55] voices still saying only in trouble i
[1:17:57] want you to catch this at no point in
[1:17:59] time is it going to be easy
[1:18:03] friends
[1:18:04] a service a prayer meeting is one of the
[1:18:07] few places you will ever find where the
[1:18:09] world comes to you to tell you you can
[1:18:10] make it you know
[1:18:12] outside of this anointing this
[1:18:14] atmosphere these times these few minutes
[1:18:17] we spend together on a sunday on a
[1:18:19] tuesday on a wednesday on a friday
[1:18:22] is your hope line coming to you saying
[1:18:24] you can make it you know outside of that
[1:18:26] voices of even people who you think are
[1:18:28] your friends
[1:18:30] are designed to take your eyes off the
[1:18:32] prize
[1:18:38] verse 13 we're almost done therefore in
[1:18:41] other words
[1:18:42] what we're seeing here is nehemiah
[1:18:44] taking action every time there's a
[1:18:46] situation to respond to he's not sitting
[1:18:48] on doing nothing hoping it works out
[1:18:50] that is what i want us to get to
[1:18:52] the internet going on what can we do
[1:18:54] this didn't work out what can we do
[1:18:56] they're coming what can we do
[1:18:59] we're not sitting down and just let the
[1:19:01] enemy run over us there must be
[1:19:03] something we can do could be doing
[1:19:05] planning to do
[1:19:07] verse 13 therefore he therefore means as
[1:19:10] a result of what transpired before this
[1:19:12] is what i'm going to therefore set i in
[1:19:15] the lower places behind the wall and on
[1:19:17] the higher places
[1:19:18] i even set the people after their
[1:19:20] families with their swords their spares
[1:19:22] and their bows and i looked and rose up
[1:19:25] and said unto the nobles and to the
[1:19:27] rulers and to the rest of the people
[1:19:30] be not ye afraid of them
[1:19:32] remember the lord
[1:19:36] i want us to appreciate this because the
[1:19:38] fact that he has a serious means that he
[1:19:40] is seeing some fear inching into the
[1:19:42] camp
[1:19:44] there would be no need to say this if
[1:19:46] fear was nothing to touch the ends of
[1:19:48] the clothes and people start to get
[1:19:49] concerned they say they're going to come
[1:19:50] and get us you know you're sure we could
[1:19:52] hold your place you're sure we can hold
[1:19:53] the fought you're sure that our defenses
[1:19:55] will hold your shore these weapons what
[1:19:56] weapons are coming with
[1:20:00] be not you're afraid of them remember
[1:20:02] the lord which is great and terrible
[1:20:05] and this is it here now this is the
[1:20:06] verse
[1:20:07] and fight for your brethren
[1:20:10] your sons
[1:20:12] and your daughters
[1:20:14] your wives
[1:20:15] and your houses
[1:20:19] i want us to catch this because
[1:20:21] nowhere in this scripture even say fight
[1:20:23] for yourself
[1:20:29] when that eight year old man in ukraine
[1:20:30] fight with my grandchildren that
[1:20:32] resonated
[1:20:33] you're able to always say it inspire him
[1:20:38] because
[1:20:38] there's something about the selflessness
[1:20:41] of a bigger purpose
[1:20:44] the selflessness of a higher cause
[1:20:47] the selflessness of a legacy beyond you
[1:20:52] listen to how nehemiah rallies the
[1:20:54] children of israel he said be not ye
[1:20:56] afraid of them remember the lord which
[1:20:59] is great and terrible and fight for your
[1:21:01] brethren
[1:21:02] don't you have bridging in here that
[1:21:04] need support
[1:21:05] your sons don't you have sons that need
[1:21:06] support your daughters your wives and
[1:21:09] your houses
[1:21:11] verse 15 i'm almost done and it came to
[1:21:14] pass
[1:21:15] when our enemies heard that it was known
[1:21:18] unto us
[1:21:19] and god had brought their counsel to
[1:21:21] naught that we returned all of us to the
[1:21:23] wall everyone under his work in other
[1:21:26] words when the enemy heard that they
[1:21:28] were not discouraged in their desire to
[1:21:31] finish the wall
[1:21:33] they went back to work and it came to
[1:21:35] pass from that time thought
[1:21:38] that behalf of my servants wrought in
[1:21:40] the work and the other half of them held
[1:21:42] both their spears the shields and the
[1:21:45] bows and the habitants and the rulers
[1:21:47] were behind all the house of judah in
[1:21:49] other words half working half defending
[1:21:52] because they in war times
[1:21:55] it's not a time of peace
[1:21:57] you better say the time of peace and
[1:21:58] it's a time of war this is the only type
[1:21:59] of peace we're in time of war
[1:22:02] war is raging on the earth friends we
[1:22:04] are not in a time of peace
[1:22:07] this is a time of war and you're in a
[1:22:09] war whether you sign up for it or not
[1:22:13] in the ukraine they told them if you're
[1:22:15] between the ages of 18 and 60 you cannot
[1:22:17] leave
[1:22:20] your wives your children they can cross
[1:22:22] the border
[1:22:24] but if you're between that age your
[1:22:25] siblings be fighting
[1:22:30] they didn't sign him for it but he in a
[1:22:32] war
[1:22:34] our war may not be physical friends but
[1:22:36] we are in a war make no mistake about it
[1:22:38] for we wrestled against flesh and blood
[1:22:40] but principalities and powers and
[1:22:42] spiritual wickedness in high places
[1:22:44] trying to distract you from receiving
[1:22:46] the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:22:49] but tonight we serve notice to every
[1:22:52] principality every power every demon
[1:22:55] every sickness every condition every
[1:22:57] doubt fear unbelief whatever it is we
[1:22:59] take it under our control
[1:23:01] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:23:04] under our control tonight so you can be
[1:23:06] free
[1:23:07] free
[1:23:08] to worship free to make demands of god
[1:23:11] requests of god he said prove me try me
[1:23:14] and see if i will not bless you
[1:23:20] we're almost done we're 17.
[1:23:23] they were building on the wall and they
[1:23:25] didn't bear burdens with those that lead
[1:23:27] everyone with one of his hands wrought
[1:23:28] in the work and the other hand held a
[1:23:30] weapon
[1:23:33] wartime
[1:23:34] for the builders everyone had his sword
[1:23:36] girded by his side and so build it the
[1:23:38] billion but they armed
[1:23:41] and he that sounded a trumpet was by me
[1:23:44] and i said unto the nobles and to the
[1:23:46] rulers and to the rest of the people the
[1:23:48] work is great and large and we are
[1:23:50] separated upon the wall one far from
[1:23:52] another in what place therefore you hear
[1:23:55] the sound of the trumpet resort he did
[1:23:57] unto us our god child fight for us so we
[1:23:59] labored in the work and half of them
[1:24:01] held the spears from the rising of the
[1:24:04] morning till the stars appeared likewise
[1:24:06] at the same time said i unto the people
[1:24:08] let everyone with his servant lord
[1:24:10] within jerusalem that in the night they
[1:24:12] may be a god to us and labor on in the
[1:24:15] day
[1:24:16] so neither i nor my brethren nor my
[1:24:19] servants nor the men of the god which
[1:24:22] followed me none of us put off our
[1:24:24] clothes saving that everyone put them
[1:24:26] off for washing in other words we wasn't
[1:24:28] resting he wasn't relaxing he wasn't
[1:24:30] taking it easy because we in war times
[1:24:33] friend eyes challenge you brother
[1:24:35] challenge you sister to follow up on the
[1:24:37] broadway
