[45:57] [Music]
[46:00] Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord.
[46:03] Praise the Lord. Let's worship the Lord
[46:04] right now.
[46:06] [Music]
[46:20] [Music]
[46:23] Hallelujah.
[46:26] [Music]
[46:32] Amen. And amen and amen. Let's bow our
[46:35] heads a word of prayer.
[46:37] Heavenly Father, we thank you for your
[46:39] presence tonight today. And we pray that
[46:41] you would come down in a special way and
[46:44] minister to the needs of the people.
[46:46] Father, your word is still true. That
[46:48] you echo through all your prophets in
[46:51] the Old Testament and your servants in
[46:53] the New Testament. And Father, your word
[46:55] is just as real. Your Holy Ghost is just
[46:57] as real. It's the same Holy Spirit. You
[47:00] said there's one Lord, one faith, and
[47:02] there's one baptism. Father, may you
[47:04] come down this morning and baptize those
[47:06] with your Holy Spirit. Amen. Bring
[47:08] revelation, faith, bring virtue,
[47:10] powerful service, and bring knowledge,
[47:12] the full seed into the hearts and lives
[47:14] of your children. Grant it God in Jesus
[47:17] name I ask it. Amen. God bless you.
[47:19] Thanks for coming. If you have your
[47:20] Bibles, let's go straight to the word.
[47:22] Hebrews chapter 4. We want to read 1-1
[47:27] and also St. John chapter 12 20- 24 for
[47:31] scripture reading this morning. Praise
[47:33] God. What an atmosphere. And we just
[47:35] grateful to God for that this morning.
[47:39] Hebrews 4.
[47:41] Let us therefore fear
[47:44] least
[47:46] uh a promise being left us of entering
[47:49] into his rest. Any of you should
[47:51] therefore seem to come short of it. For
[47:54] unto us was the gospel preached as well
[47:56] as unto them. But the word preached did
[48:00] not profit them, not being mixed with
[48:02] faith in them that heard it. For we
[48:07] which have believed, do enter into rest,
[48:10] as he said, as I have sworn in my wrath,
[48:14] if they should enter into my rest,
[48:16] although the works were finished before
[48:18] the foundation of the world. Praise God.
[48:22] Uh and for he spake of a certain place
[48:25] of the seventh day on this wise and God
[48:28] did rest the seventh day from all his
[48:30] works. And in a at this place again if
[48:33] they shall enter into my race my rest.
[48:36] Seeing therefore it remained that some
[48:38] must enter therein that they to whom it
[48:41] was first preached entered not in
[48:45] because of unbelief. Again he limited a
[48:48] certain day saying in David today after
[48:50] so long a time as it is said today if
[48:52] you will hear his voice had not your
[48:55] hearts for if Jesus has given them rest
[48:58] then would he not afterward have spoken
[49:00] of another day? There remainth therefore
[49:03] a rest to the people of God. For he that
[49:06] entered into his rest he also has ceased
[49:10] from his own works as God did from his
[49:12] his verse 11. Let us labor therefore to
[49:17] enter into that rest, least any man fall
[49:21] after the same example of unbelief. And
[49:25] we want to go to St. John chapter 12
[49:29] and we want to read from verse 20.
[49:32] And there were certain Greeks among them
[49:34] that came up to worship at the feast.
[49:38] The same came therefore to Philillip
[49:40] which was of Bazaar of Galilee and
[49:42] desired him saying sir we would see
[49:44] Jesus. And Philillip cometh and tell
[49:47] Andrew and against Andrew and Philip
[49:49] tell Jesus. And Jesus answered and said
[49:51] unto them, saying the hour is come that
[49:54] the Son of man should be glorified.
[49:57] Verily I say unto you, except a corner
[49:59] wheat fall into the ground and die, it
[50:01] abideth alone. But if it die, it
[50:04] bringeth forth much fruit. May God bless
[50:06] his word. You may be seated. Praise God.
[50:08] I really appreciate you all coming out
[50:10] this morning uh for to hear the word of
[50:12] God. Amen. Praise God. All right. So,
[50:18] Hebrews 4:11, the Amplified says, "Let
[50:21] us therefore be zealous and exert
[50:24] ourselves
[50:25] and strive diligently
[50:28] to enter that rest of God, to know and
[50:32] experience it for ourselves." Amen. that
[50:34] no one may fall or perish by the same
[50:38] kind of unbelief and disobedience
[50:42] into which those in the wilderness fell.
[50:46] Just remember, happy Father's Day to all
[50:48] the fathers here. It's a blessing and a
[50:50] privilege to be a dad. Amen. I
[50:54] I I
[50:56] love fatherhood. I love um I all excited
[50:59] about that. You have lives to lead,
[51:02] lives to direct. Amen. And them guys
[51:05] that tall like you, they they didn't
[51:06] born that size. They born big. You see
[51:10] them from small. And it's how we treat
[51:12] them from small is what going to guide
[51:15] them and direct them. It's like a farmer
[51:17] plant and a plant because you mold it
[51:18] and shape it and whatn not it going to
[51:20] bring forth. And you can't change. You
[51:23] see you can't change them old and hard
[51:26] now. You can't bend them. You can't
[51:27] break them. Too old. You fail. when they
[51:31] were small to to deal with them and to
[51:33] manage them how you're supposed to
[51:34] manage them and when they come adults it
[51:36] become different and I I um believe that
[51:39] the children as they get older the
[51:41] parents the father become a mentor to
[51:43] his sons the mother become a mentor to
[51:45] our daughters amen praise God so
[51:50] we will deal with that some other time
[51:52] but today I have something upon my hand
[51:55] I want to share now John 12:24 and Jesus
[51:59] talked about except a corn fall on the
[52:00] ground and die. He said, "Is sure you
[52:03] assure you most somn I tell you unless a
[52:06] grain of wheat falls into the earth and
[52:07] dies, it remain just one grain.
[52:11] It never become more but lives by itself
[52:16] alone. But if it die, it produces many
[52:20] others and yields a rich harvest." Amen.
[52:23] So, I hope this word encourage you this
[52:25] morning, but I want to encourage you to
[52:26] labor to enter into your inheritance.
[52:29] Yes, sir. You see, if you see it
[52:31] differently, your whole approach it
[52:33] differently is your inheritance you're
[52:35] talking about. Amen. Amen. Amen. So
[52:37] Paul, so unless the green falls in the
[52:39] wrong and die, it abides alone. So Paul
[52:41] said, "Fight the good fight of faith."
[52:43] Isn't that right? So it's a labor. It's
[52:45] a fight. So you can't say you're tired
[52:47] and you're weary. Oh God, I can't take
[52:49] no more. When the Lord will come, stop
[52:51] talking that talk. Whenever the Lord
[52:53] come, he choose to come. That's his
[52:54] business. Your business is the fight.
[52:56] There's good fight of faith. Your
[52:58] business is to wrestle with your
[52:59] problems, wrestle in your situation.
[53:02] That is your business. Is it? Amen.
[53:04] Fight the good fight of faith. So on uh
[53:08] prayer meeting night, I shared some
[53:10] stuff there. I don't know how much of
[53:12] you listened to it. I don't know how
[53:14] much you have slept on it and fell
[53:16] asleep while praying, fell asleep by the
[53:18] exhaustation was going on. But I shared
[53:21] created me a clean heart and I thought
[53:24] to bring back some of the things that
[53:25] was there. This was a prayer that David
[53:27] was talking about in Psalms 51 after he
[53:30] fell in sin within Bashibba and he was
[53:31] talking about wash me thoroughly. I act
[53:33] in my transgression against thee have I
[53:35] sinned and David say thou desire truth
[53:38] from the inward part no old talk. David
[53:40] wasn't playing games and say well it's
[53:41] not me and you know the reason why and
[53:44] all kind of fancy explanation. He wasn't
[53:45] in that at all. David was straight clean
[53:48] and clear and he said purge me with
[53:50] hissup and I shall be clean. This is God
[53:53] he's speaking to. Wash me and I shall be
[53:55] whiter than snow. Make my make me to
[53:58] hear joy and gladness that the bones
[54:00] that which has broken me rejoice. Hide
[54:02] thy face from my sins. Blot out my
[54:04] iniquities. And then he said create in
[54:06] me a clean heart and renew a right
[54:08] spirit within me. And we are saying that
[54:11] God, we want God to hear our prayer. We
[54:14] want God to answer our prayer. We don't
[54:16] want to be wasting time like saying all
[54:17] kind of prayers that God have nothing to
[54:19] do with it reaching us far the roof and
[54:20] dropping back right back. No. He said,
[54:23] "If I regard iniquity in my heart, the
[54:25] Lord will not hear me." Once you have
[54:27] iniquity in your heart, so so if you
[54:29] hear that and you have iniquity in your
[54:31] heart, right away you want to repent
[54:33] right away. You want to get rid of it.
[54:34] You can't expect to hear this and keep
[54:36] iniquity in your heart. You have to get
[54:37] rid of that because you want God to hear
[54:39] you. You say, "Have mercy upon me, oh
[54:41] God." You want God to hear you. And that
[54:44] David said, this is Psalm 66. But
[54:46] verily, God had heard me and he had
[54:48] attended to the voice of my prayer.
[54:50] Blessed be God which had not turned away
[54:52] my prayer nor his mercy from me. Oh,
[54:55] give the Lord some praises. Blessed be
[54:57] Oh, you have to join David. You have to
[55:00] join in that praise and that worship.
[55:02] Isn't that right? All right. Amen. So,
[55:05] Baram says, you never turn a cold
[55:06] shoulder to anyone. No matter what it
[55:09] is, even if they mistreated you, do it
[55:11] anyhow. If you can't do it from your
[55:14] heart, then you ought to come to the
[55:16] altar and stay there till that spirit
[55:19] comes into that your from your heart
[55:21] that you can love those who doesn't love
[55:23] you and then and that's when God will
[55:26] answer your prayer. Notice how Job get
[55:28] double portion when he forgive his
[55:30] brethren and pray for them then God give
[55:32] him his blessing. Oh pray. What is
[55:34] iniquity? Iniquity is something that you
[55:35] have done wrong and you know better that
[55:38] you ought not to have done. If I
[55:40] conceive iniquity in my heart, God will
[55:42] not hear me. I don't care how much saint
[55:45] you are, how much books you have, what
[55:46] teams I listen to, is God will not hear
[55:49] you. Iniquity, prophet, is something
[55:51] that you know that you ought to do and
[55:53] you won't do it. You know better, but
[55:55] you won't do it. It's iniquity. You
[55:58] know, they should stay with the word of
[55:59] God, but for the church sake or somebody
[56:01] else sake or how we see it and what not.
[56:04] And you know better. When you know
[56:05] better, you do better. When you know
[56:07] better, you speak better. When you know
[56:09] better, you act better because you're
[56:10] responsible for the word that comes your
[56:12] way. Oh, blessed be the name of the
[56:14] Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. All right,
[56:17] let me skip down quickly.
[56:22] We spoke about Abraham as a sign of
[56:24] surrender offering his son Isaac, his
[56:27] only son. What how you how would you
[56:29] feel if you have one child, only son,
[56:32] and God say offer him up. And Abraham
[56:34] did not hesitate. He followed in what?
[56:36] obedience, willingness, isn't that
[56:39] right? And we know we offer up Isaac, so
[56:41] I'm skipping through quickly. David and
[56:43] David after that same Psalms, David
[56:46] said, "Oh Lord, open my lips and my
[56:47] mouth shall show forth thy praise." And
[56:49] then David said this, "For thou
[56:51] desireest not sacrifice, else I would
[56:54] give it." It was if you want sacrifice,
[56:56] I given it. But then he said, "Thou
[56:58] delightest not in burnt offering. The
[57:00] sacrifices of God are a broken spirit, a
[57:03] broken and contrite heart. Oh God, thou
[57:05] will not despise. So now we find out
[57:08] what God want. Not bulls and goats and
[57:09] and bullocks and and lambs and rams and
[57:12] all these slaughtering and and fire on
[57:14] them. Not that he want, you know, he
[57:16] want your spirit to be broken. He want a
[57:18] lamb like you want a certain quality of
[57:20] spirit in you. Now the opposite of that
[57:23] to this humility, submission and
[57:25] obedience is stubbornness,
[57:28] disobedience and rebellion. That's the
[57:31] opposite of that. Hallelujah.
[57:36] But a Hugh, if anybody's downstairs and
[57:38] not supposed to be downstairs, send them
[57:39] tell them get upstairs. All right.
[57:41] Hallelujah.
[57:43] Tell them get upstairs. Hallelujah.
[57:47] The opposite to this humility,
[57:49] submission and obedience is
[57:51] stubbornness, disobedience, and
[57:53] rebellion. And this is clearly reflected
[57:56] in Saul. And and we know the story what
[57:59] God told Samuel told Saul to do and
[58:01] whatnot. And he disobeyed. And then when
[58:04] Samuel came to him, he said, um uh
[58:07] blessed be the Lord. I have come
[58:08] performed the commandment of the Lord.
[58:10] This is partial obedience, which is
[58:13] something I never used before, a term I
[58:15] never expressed before that you could
[58:17] partially obey. God don't want partial
[58:19] obedience. God want full obedience. And
[58:22] you know the quote full obedience to the
[58:23] whole word of God entitles you to the
[58:25] token. So you partially
[58:28] partially that's not good enough.
[58:33] See God going to shake you off your
[58:35] religious perch. You know that perch is
[58:37] posing on that religious God will shake
[58:39] you off of it, you know. Amen.
[58:41] Because some people content to come to
[58:43] church. That's that's their religious
[58:45] duty. I come to church here. I you know
[58:47] people think I backslide come to church.
[58:48] But that's not what we talking about.
[58:50] The scripture we read to all of them
[58:53] heard the word but the word they heard
[58:54] was not mixed with faith and they
[58:57] perished. They died. This is people who
[59:00] came out from Egypt. This is people come
[59:02] out in the message. This is people who
[59:04] have books and tapes. They died
[59:09] because the word they heard wasn't mixed
[59:11] with faith and they died in the
[59:13] unbelief.
[59:15] Oh, give the Lord some praise in the
[59:16] house. Go just watch me. We come into
[59:20] your house tonight.
[59:23] Hallelujah. So when Samuel came and he
[59:27] said, "What is this bleeding I'm hearing
[59:29] in my sheep?" He said he said they have
[59:31] brought from the Amalachites for the
[59:32] people spare the best of the sheep and
[59:33] the oxen to sacrifice unto the Lord thy
[59:35] God.
[59:38] And then Samuel said I will tell you
[59:40] what God say
[59:42] when there was little
[59:46] when he was a nobody when you didn't
[59:48] have what you have.
[59:51] Hallelujah. Because when you have what
[59:53] you have now you're acting like a
[59:55] picture.
[59:58] Nobody can't talk to you. Nobody can
[1:00:00] tell you nothing. You're not hearing the
[1:00:02] word. You're not taking correction.
[1:00:04] You're not taking nothing. Amen. Are
[1:00:06] there some people that don't want to be
[1:00:07] spoken to? I want to come to church and
[1:00:08] go back home. Don't tell me anything.
[1:00:16] So Paul said, Saul said, Samuel said to
[1:00:18] him, um, okay.
[1:00:24] Um, and Saul said to Samuel, "Yeah, I
[1:00:28] have I have I have obeyed. I have obeyed
[1:00:30] the voice of the Lord, and I've gone the
[1:00:32] way which the Lord sent me, and I've
[1:00:34] brought Ag, the king of Amalcch, and
[1:00:35] have utterly destroyed the Amalachites."
[1:00:37] But the people make an excuse now. But
[1:00:40] the people took of the spoil, sheep, and
[1:00:43] oxen, and the chief of the things, which
[1:00:45] have been utterly destroyed, the
[1:00:46] sacrifice of the Lord. Give me an
[1:00:47] excuse. And then Samuel said, "Had the
[1:00:50] Lord as great delight in burnt offering
[1:00:52] and sacrifices, in obeying the voice of
[1:00:54] the Lord. Behold, they were the word
[1:00:56] come. To obey is better than sacrifice,
[1:01:01] and to hearken than the fat of rams."
[1:01:04] For rebellion is as a sin of witchcraft,
[1:01:08] and stubbornness is as iniquity and
[1:01:10] idolatry. Now, I've never zoomed in on
[1:01:13] stubbornness. And I happen to see this
[1:01:16] and I begin to, you know, like you're
[1:01:18] doing a zoom in on this word called
[1:01:20] stubbornness. And stubbornness is a
[1:01:22] dogged determination not to change one's
[1:01:26] attitude or position on something.
[1:01:29] Come on.
[1:01:30] Stubbornness is the quality of being
[1:01:32] determined to do what you want and
[1:01:36] refusing to do anything else or being
[1:01:39] difficult to move, change or deal with.
[1:01:43] Amen.
[1:01:45] Stubbornness refers to the unyielding
[1:01:47] resistance to God's will. A hardness of
[1:01:50] heart that refuses correction,
[1:01:54] instruction,
[1:01:56] or submission.
[1:01:58] It is linked with rebellion and
[1:02:00] disobedience, a will that insist on its
[1:02:04] own way rather than God's.
[1:02:08] 1 Samuel 15:23, for rebellion is as a
[1:02:11] sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is
[1:02:14] as iniquity and idolatry.
[1:02:17] So stubbornness is equated with serious
[1:02:20] sin. Iniquity and idolatry. Why? Because
[1:02:24] it places one's will above God's.
[1:02:28] So you are fixed because you see it so
[1:02:30] and you think it so and you speaking it
[1:02:32] so. You are operating by you and you
[1:02:35] will pay for that.
[1:02:37] For rebellion is as a sin of witchcraft.
[1:02:40] That's what the Bible says.
[1:02:43] I want to say it again. Rebellion is as
[1:02:45] a sin of witchcraft and stubbornness is
[1:02:48] idolatry. In the amplified it says that
[1:02:51] stubbornness is like household good
[1:02:54] images. Because you have rejected the
[1:02:57] word of the Lord, he shall also reject
[1:02:59] you from being king. Amen.
[1:03:04] Amen.
[1:03:05] Zechariah 7, we read this. God speaks
[1:03:08] and they refuse to hearken and pull away
[1:03:11] his shoulder and stop their ears that
[1:03:13] they should not hear. And they have made
[1:03:15] their hearts as a diamond stone.
[1:03:18] Lisa should hear the word Lord and so on
[1:03:20] like that. And therefore
[1:03:24] it shall come to pass that as he cried
[1:03:26] and they would not hear. They're the
[1:03:27] prophets. Amen. So they cried and I will
[1:03:30] not hear say the Lord. Amen. So God
[1:03:32] given a deal. When the word come and you
[1:03:34] don't want to listen. Good. You praying
[1:03:37] stubborn. You don't want to hear. You
[1:03:38] don't want to subject yourself. You
[1:03:39] don't want to fall in line with what God
[1:03:41] said. Not what the preacher is what what
[1:03:43] God said as the word. He said when you
[1:03:45] cry I would not hear you because when
[1:03:47] the word come to you you're not
[1:03:49] listening. You want to continue in what
[1:03:51] you're doing. You wouldn't repent. You
[1:03:52] wouldn't adjust. And that's why those
[1:03:54] type of people they break because
[1:03:56] they're not flexible. They can't bend.
[1:03:58] Because when you see you begin to yield,
[1:04:00] you could bend. You could flow with the
[1:04:02] wind. You could flow with the breeze of
[1:04:03] the Holy Ghost. When you're stiff in
[1:04:05] stubbornness, you break. You get upset.
[1:04:08] You get mad. It breaks you. And you feel
[1:04:10] hurt. And you're hurt. And you're hurt
[1:04:12] because you are stubborn.
[1:04:15] Hallelujah. Give the Lord some praises.
[1:04:18] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:04:23] Glory. God said in Jeremiah, but this
[1:04:26] thing command I on and them saying,
[1:04:27] "Obey my voice. I'll be with your I will
[1:04:29] be your God. You shall be my people."
[1:04:32] Now notice there's not church thing, you
[1:04:33] know. Come on. I want you to understand
[1:04:35] how the flow going. You know, there's
[1:04:37] not church and I'm going at this church
[1:04:39] and when that church, there's not church
[1:04:40] thing, you know. This is God speaking
[1:04:42] here. Tell them, "Obey my voice, and I
[1:04:45] will be your God, and ye shall be my
[1:04:47] people, and walk in all the ways I have
[1:04:49] commanded you, that it may be well unto
[1:04:51] you." But they hark not, nor incline
[1:04:54] their ear, but walk in the counsel, and
[1:04:56] in the imagination of their evil heart,
[1:04:58] and went backward, and not forward. And
[1:05:01] since the day that your fathers came
[1:05:02] forth out of the land of Egypt, unto
[1:05:04] this day I have even sent unto you all
[1:05:06] my servants and prophets rising early
[1:05:08] and sending them. Yet they hack not unto
[1:05:10] me, not inclined, but hardened their
[1:05:12] neck and did and did worse than their
[1:05:14] father. Amen. Amen. So rebellion and
[1:05:17] stubbornness brings judgment and ruined.
[1:05:21] Why not surrender tonight and ask God to
[1:05:24] take that stubbornness from you?
[1:05:34] Now
[1:05:37] 1 Corinthians 9 24 says and that's you
[1:05:40] know know ye not did I give the title of
[1:05:44] the message? No not yet. Know ye not
[1:05:47] that they which run in the race run all
[1:05:49] but one receiveth a prize. So run that
[1:05:51] he may obtain and every man that strive
[1:05:53] for the mastery here we go. Get this
[1:05:55] powerful word is temporate in all
[1:05:57] things. Amen. Amen.
[1:05:59] And Paul said, "I run not as uncertainly
[1:06:03] so fine eye, not as one that beat the
[1:06:05] ear, but I keep my body and bring it
[1:06:09] into subjection, least that by any means
[1:06:12] when I have preached to others, I myself
[1:06:15] become a cast away." So Paul wasn't
[1:06:18] excluding himself. He was saying if I
[1:06:21] don't get this thing right, if I don't
[1:06:23] get the discipline right, if I don't get
[1:06:25] the temperance right, I myself will
[1:06:28] become a cast away. Hallelujah. I have
[1:06:32] to check myself. I have to get it right.
[1:06:34] Isn't that right? Okay.
[1:06:39] The title of the message this morning is
[1:06:40] let us labor therefore to enter into
[1:06:42] that rest. Amen. And I have an
[1:06:45] inspiration, the debt of a corner wheat.
[1:06:48] Hallelujah. I have a question for you.
[1:06:50] Temperance
[1:06:52] on the on below is three virtues and on
[1:06:54] top is three virtues. Temperance is
[1:06:56] right in the middle. I want to ask a
[1:06:59] question to you. Is temperance a sign of
[1:07:02] the seed dying?
[1:07:08] That's the question I want to ask you.
[1:07:10] This virtue called temperance that green
[1:07:12] there because only God could give you
[1:07:14] faith. You don't have that. That's a
[1:07:18] revelation. Only God could give you
[1:07:20] virtue. You don't have that. That's
[1:07:23] that's his power. As Mary received him
[1:07:25] to give you power. Only God could give
[1:07:26] him knowledge. His knowledge. But you
[1:07:28] see temperance. That's different. Amen.
[1:07:31] Hallelujah. Amen. Glory. That is the
[1:07:33] same age that the seed went into the
[1:07:34] ground.
[1:07:36] Amen. Through the dark ages, that age
[1:07:38] day of Titara, the seed of God, went
[1:07:42] down into the ground, die out, and then
[1:07:44] up come Luther. Up come Wesley. Amen. Up
[1:07:48] come Pentecost. So God will give you the
[1:07:50] seed. Listen to what the Bible said. As
[1:07:52] many receive him, to them give you power
[1:07:55] to become or power to be transformed or
[1:07:58] power to be conformed. It was not
[1:08:00] instant, son, but power to become. You
[1:08:02] have to grow up. You have to add up. You
[1:08:05] have to measure up. Give the Lord a
[1:08:07] praise in the house. God ain't call you
[1:08:09] to be as you are. God call you to change
[1:08:12] you and transform you. And if you are
[1:08:14] how you are 20 years ago, shame on you.
[1:08:18] We ought to be higher up. We ought to be
[1:08:21] further up. We ought to be better than
[1:08:22] we was last year. Okay. The Lord has
[1:08:25] shouted the house. The cars getting
[1:08:27] better. The house getting better. All
[1:08:30] kind of things getting better. Man in a
[1:08:32] sinful condition making better things.
[1:08:35] Oh, glory to God. And God sent a prophet
[1:08:37] to turn our hearts back to the faith of
[1:08:38] the fathers that we can have a better
[1:08:40] experience. Oh, give the Lord a shout
[1:08:44] that we could be the people that has the
[1:08:46] manifestation of the sons and daughters
[1:08:48] of God. The people who the whole
[1:08:50] creation is grown in and travailing for.
[1:08:55] [Applause]
[1:08:59] Hallelujah. All right. Glory to God.
[1:09:06] Wait till Russia is setting out here
[1:09:08] taking over the nations and things like
[1:09:10] that.
[1:09:12] You know I read these things already but
[1:09:13] never getting you know like how Isaac
[1:09:15] would say drive down slowly. Listen to
[1:09:17] these words. This is the same prophet
[1:09:19] that prophesied when they take the pope
[1:09:20] out of America
[1:09:22] in the same spirit. That's that means
[1:09:25] Russia will not stop at Ukraine. Amen.
[1:09:27] Hallelujah.
[1:09:30] It's not only Ukraine they going after
[1:09:31] you know they have lost a million men
[1:09:33] and that not even Putin even blink at
[1:09:36] that. Do you hear that? That one like
[1:09:38] the Holy Spir get killed.
[1:09:41] Do you understand that they lost a
[1:09:43] million men, you know,
[1:09:46] mothers lost their sons, you know, wives
[1:09:49] lost their husband, you know, 1 million.
[1:09:54] And he's still there resolute.
[1:10:00] Wait till Russia is setting out there
[1:10:02] taking over the nations and things like
[1:10:07] that. And this country because of its
[1:10:11] backsliding. You will see what was right
[1:10:14] and wrong. That's right. You will see
[1:10:16] whether your lukewarm religion will pay
[1:10:17] off or not. What is it? It's the devil.
[1:10:20] The invasion is on. I ain't saying
[1:10:23] nothing about this individual or that
[1:10:24] individual. I am saying this is barbe. I
[1:10:28] am saying it is unclean spirits that are
[1:10:31] possessing people driving them right
[1:10:33] into it. The invasion of United States.
[1:10:36] The overthrow of the church. The church
[1:10:39] is overthrown by the devil. And a couple
[1:10:42] of months ago, I heard saying why would
[1:10:43] the devil send the press now when the
[1:10:45] devil is inside the church. Look at
[1:10:47] here. Because the devils invade and
[1:10:50] overthrow the churches. That's why so
[1:10:52] much of bitterness and anger and hatred
[1:10:53] and malice. The devil's in the church.
[1:10:55] the devil behind the pullpit, the devil
[1:10:57] bringing clothes
[1:11:01] because we have to get to the unity of
[1:11:03] the faith. But before we get to unity of
[1:11:05] the faith, we have to get to unity of
[1:11:07] the spirit. Oh, give the Lord some
[1:11:09] praises. Unity of the spirit means that
[1:11:12] you can work in harmony with somebody.
[1:11:14] That's why he said they give you a new
[1:11:16] spirit to work with the Holy Spirit
[1:11:18] because your own filthy human spirit,
[1:11:21] God can work with that. A new heart I
[1:11:24] will give you. A new spirit I will give
[1:11:26] you. Can I give you my spirit inside of
[1:11:28] you? Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[1:11:30] Give the Lord a shout in the house.
[1:11:33] We're not here to make up church
[1:11:34] membership. We're not here to make up
[1:11:36] church numbers. We had to bring the word
[1:11:39] word on top of word on top of word. You
[1:11:42] take it or you leave it. Oh, the Lord a
[1:11:44] shout in the house.
[1:11:48] [Music]
[1:11:49] Amen.
[1:11:56] We not going and do open your mouth and
[1:11:58] force food inside your mouth. Nobody
[1:12:01] doing that at all. Amen. Brother Abraham
[1:12:03] said the church is overthrown by the
[1:12:05] devil. He said, "Oh God, send us some
[1:12:07] oldfashioned sacrifice men who doesn't
[1:12:09] know A from B and knows the power of the
[1:12:12] resurrection of the Lord Jesus who will
[1:12:13] preach repentance. Send men and women to
[1:12:16] the altar to love the Lord Jesus." And
[1:12:18] then down the preachers stand on the
[1:12:19] platform today. Praise God. Hallelujah.
[1:12:22] Hallelujah. You say when you get let me
[1:12:25] go down there. When you lay the facts
[1:12:27] down, the people come to hear you in
[1:12:29] evangelical service. You're trying to
[1:12:31] get the thing that and preach the gospel
[1:12:33] and get people repenting and get them
[1:12:35] out. They blow up and walk out. Don't
[1:12:38] have to hear it.
[1:12:41] I can imagine some people say, "How
[1:12:42] about you how you could talk about
[1:12:44] creating me a clean heart?" He had
[1:12:46] dirty.
[1:12:49] God had right
[1:12:52] is they don't have to hear it. He said,
[1:12:54] "But no, they don't. But, brethren,
[1:12:56] they're going to have to repent or
[1:12:57] perish." God, listen, Brother, let me
[1:13:00] preach like I've never before. Let me
[1:13:03] preach to dying men as a dying man
[1:13:06] myself. Amen. Let me preach to people
[1:13:08] like I've never had another sermon to
[1:13:10] preach. Let me persuade them to come to
[1:13:12] the altar with streaming faces, with
[1:13:14] tears, go back home and live like
[1:13:16] Christians.
[1:13:19] You see, you're believing one thing, but
[1:13:21] you're living something different. So
[1:13:23] your belief and life is not adding up.
[1:13:30] Don't say amen now. Are you begging for
[1:13:32] a
[1:13:35] whether you say amen or not, what I have
[1:13:38] to bring, I have to bring.
[1:13:40] How you react doesn't affect me. You
[1:13:41] know, I have to deliver what I have to
[1:13:44] deliver. Amen.
[1:13:48] Hallelujah. What? Go back home and live
[1:13:50] like Christians. Live in your in their
[1:13:52] neighborhood. Stop all this frolic and
[1:13:54] running around, jumping, carrying on,
[1:13:56] acting this way and blowing up this way.
[1:13:58] Don't do that. That's the devil. Them
[1:14:00] demon spirits come Christians.
[1:14:04] Four people say, "Amen."
[1:14:07] Hallelujah.
[1:14:11] So all churches who feel they they're
[1:14:13] superior and and on top and they one up
[1:14:16] and whatn not foolishness all that all
[1:14:17] that deceiving the people the people in
[1:14:19] arrogance and the people feel
[1:14:22] and the right place at the right man
[1:14:26] demon spirit come upon Christian don't
[1:14:28] bring that here
[1:14:30] that kind of ganja message ganja they
[1:14:31] smoking and getting on we don't sell
[1:14:34] them thing here we don't smoke those
[1:14:35] things here let them keep on smoking
[1:14:37] that out there Remember those ministers
[1:14:39] down there? The them prophets were
[1:14:40] prophets. Religious men offering
[1:14:41] sacrifices. They're religious as it is
[1:14:43] today. But brother, they was a long way
[1:14:45] from the truth. Amen. Okay.
[1:14:51] I almost skip a lot of things. Talk
[1:14:53] about Noah getting out before judgment
[1:14:56] and so on. He said, "Remember before the
[1:14:58] rain fell, Noah was in the ark. Before
[1:15:00] the fire fell, Lot was out of Sodom. I
[1:15:02] can't do nothing till you come hither.
[1:15:03] I've got a leaf in my hand to pull and
[1:15:05] make the fast of heaven." Here we go.
[1:15:08] And I think that exactly the angel of
[1:15:11] destruction
[1:15:14] is holding the hand of Russia with the
[1:15:18] atomic bombs. Come on. Because right now
[1:15:20] Putin thinking about nuclear, you know,
[1:15:23] with nuclear you answer to that, you
[1:15:25] know,
[1:15:29] and I keep wondering what is happening
[1:15:31] here. Russia is so much bigger. Russia
[1:15:34] has so much army and technology and what
[1:15:36] and this Ukraine only like slinging shut
[1:15:38] and you know for how long three years.
[1:15:43] What is the clock that God is using?
[1:15:46] What is God looking at? Is it the bride
[1:15:49] coming into position to know who she is?
[1:15:50] Amen. Why things are worse right now?
[1:15:54] You sitting here and Israel bomb Iran
[1:15:57] and Iran loosing missiles against
[1:15:58] Israel. The whole east place they going
[1:16:01] to light up just now. Yes. Amen. Things
[1:16:05] is about to begin. The drama is still
[1:16:08] coming to getting to start. And you
[1:16:11] can't sit here like you're ignorant,
[1:16:13] like you don't know, like you can't sit
[1:16:16] here like that.
[1:16:18] Too much of things happening all around.
[1:16:24] The pope coming out of America is a
[1:16:26] signpost. The prophet nailed it since in
[1:16:28] the 50s. When they do that, this going
[1:16:31] to happen. When they do that, this going
[1:16:33] to be unfolding. Amen. Are you looking
[1:16:35] for that?
[1:16:40] I think the angel of destruction. Yes.
[1:16:43] Yes. Hallelujah.
[1:16:45] Oh, you have an angel in charge of
[1:16:48] destruction. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. And
[1:16:53] that angel is on the earth.
[1:16:58] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Stop this war.
[1:17:01] Stop this war. Let them reach so far and
[1:17:04] no more. Stop this because my people
[1:17:06] backstage. Stop it. Hold it. You got to
[1:17:09] come forth. You got to come true. You
[1:17:12] got to repent. You got to make things
[1:17:14] right. You got to come out stubbornness.
[1:17:16] You got to come out ungodliness. You got
[1:17:18] to come in that filthiness. You got to
[1:17:20] come out of it.
[1:17:22] Today, when you hear my voice, have not
[1:17:25] your heart.
[1:17:28] [Applause]
[1:17:37] Let me read it for you.
[1:17:42] The angel of destruction
[1:17:44] is holding the hand of Russia with the
[1:17:48] atomic bombs until
[1:17:51] the church comes together as one great
[1:17:54] body of Christ.
[1:17:57] [Applause]
[1:17:58] What church you talking about? The bride
[1:18:01] and seven thunders.
[1:18:04] Gather the bride together.
[1:18:06] Seven thunders. May he show the bride
[1:18:09] how to prepare for great translation
[1:18:12] faith. Glory to God. It's going to take
[1:18:16] those seven thunders to wake the bride
[1:18:19] up again. Time to wake up out your
[1:18:21] slumber. Time to get up your stuper, out

[1:19:06] nothing to do but to destroy the whole
[1:19:08] thing. Amen. Every thought of man is
[1:19:10] continually full of sin. Everything man
[1:19:12] thinks about today is bottle whiskey.
[1:19:14] Woman running around can't live true to
[1:19:16] their wives. Boys can't live true to
[1:19:17] their girls. Girls can't live true to
[1:19:18] the boys. They're living such a place
[1:19:20] that the devil got them so bound and
[1:19:22] possessed with evil spirits. The whole
[1:19:25] thing is a convolution of sin. And
[1:19:28] that's the reason we are in the day.
[1:19:30] Here we go. And that's the reason Russia
[1:19:34] is playing exactly in the hands of God.
[1:19:38] Amen. to rock this thing out here. Yes,
[1:19:41] sir. The Bible says so. Amen. God is
[1:19:44] using communism. Yes, he will use it.
[1:19:48] And communism will destroy the entire
[1:19:51] thing. Amen. According to the scripture
[1:19:55] and we are in that day. Yes sir. Amen.
[1:20:00] So this is a backdrop of where we going.
[1:20:03] Hallelujah. That's the reason God raised
[1:20:06] up Russia yonder with the atomic bomb.
[1:20:08] Amen. To wipe her off like the anti-
[1:20:10] ruling flood was and he raised a cloud
[1:20:13] shore. Russia, that atheistic country
[1:20:18] has absolutely played in the hands of
[1:20:20] almighty God. Amen. Just as King
[1:20:22] Nebuchadnezzar was to destroy Israel.
[1:20:24] Amen. Because they failed to walk with
[1:20:27] God. Amen. And whenever Israel backslide
[1:20:30] and fail to walk with God, he let some
[1:20:31] king come and take them. Amen. into
[1:20:33] captivity. He will put your house into
[1:20:36] captivity. He can put a curse over your
[1:20:38] own house because there's lack of
[1:20:40] repentance in your house. And when you
[1:20:42] repent and get out your ways, things
[1:20:44] will change that cloud, that darkness
[1:20:46] over your house, God will cancel it. If
[1:20:49] you prepare to repent, if you prepare
[1:20:52] not for partial submission, but for full
[1:20:54] submission, not for partial obedience,
[1:20:56] but for full obedience. Oh kay in the
[1:20:59] house,
[1:21:01] [Applause]
[1:21:08] Glory.
[1:21:13] The Bible said in the Catholic Church in
[1:21:15] her was the blood of the matches of
[1:21:16] Jesus. How much Christians they killed
[1:21:19] during the dark ages? Millions. Over six
[1:21:21] million Christians was killed under the
[1:21:23] hand of Rome. And Jesus prophesied they
[1:21:25] will kill you thinking they're doing God
[1:21:26] a service. Listen to what the prophet
[1:21:29] says. Russia raising right up to avenge
[1:21:33] the saints of the Catholic Church of the
[1:21:35] blood that shed for the saints. Amen. So
[1:21:38] God using that country to avenge what
[1:21:42] Rome has done. We are here. That
[1:21:46] couldn't happen 40 years ago because 40
[1:21:47] years ago they didn't have the missile
[1:21:49] system they have right now. Amen. Amen.
[1:21:53] Hallelujah.
[1:21:54] And 40 years ago we we didn't have what
[1:21:56] we have here right now. Amen. We are
[1:21:58] wrapped promises. We anointed with
[1:22:00] expectation. We know what about to
[1:22:03] break. Something about to break. Praise
[1:22:05] God. Praise God. I don't care what your
[1:22:06] family going through, what you going
[1:22:07] through, what you're thinking, what
[1:22:08] you're feeling. The Bible said as wasn't
[1:22:10] there as a Noah. They eat, they drink.
[1:22:12] Nothing normal. Normal living. Oh, the
[1:22:15] Lord. I shout in the house. The day Noah
[1:22:18] entered in the ark, rain was coming. The
[1:22:21] day Lot kept out, fire was coming.
[1:22:25] People thought they was going to the
[1:22:26] bank that day. People thought they were
[1:22:28] going to withdraw their salary. Fire was
[1:22:30] coming. Oh, give the Lord a shout. They
[1:22:33] wasn't going to make it to the bank
[1:22:35] because judgment was set. Oh, glory to
[1:22:37] God. And God, blood on the mercy seat is
[1:22:41] what them thunders is about. Oh, give
[1:22:44] the Lord a shout. Hallelujah.
[1:22:46] Hallelujah. That's what the message
[1:22:48] world don't understand. Blood on the
[1:22:50] mercy seat is what them thunders is
[1:22:52] about. Oh, glory. Mercy there was great
[1:22:55] and grace was free. Pardon there was
[1:22:58] multiplied for me. There my burden soul
[1:23:02] found liberty at Calvary. Oh give the
[1:23:05] Lord some praises.
[1:23:10] [Applause]

[1:24:04] here. This is your word. This is what
[1:24:06] God saying. If you don't believe that is
[1:24:09] you are in unbelief. You have to believe

[1:33:23] words, it's unconditional.
[1:33:25] He swore by himself that you're going to
[1:33:28] make it. He swore by himself and then
[1:33:31] seven thunders
[1:33:32] the voices them seven thunder were
[1:33:34] thrown out to get you to find you and it

[1:34:03] bump. She never doubts it. Nothing can
[1:34:06] harm her. Not even death.
[1:34:12] Hallelujah. Did you hear that? That's
[1:34:14] when you have confidence in God. You
[1:34:15] know why Abraham could offer Isaac so
[1:34:18] freely? Because Abraham was a dead man
[1:34:20] and he knew if God could bring a son out
[1:34:23] of a dead man and a dead woman, he could
[1:34:26] bring back Isaac from the dead. So he
[1:34:29] had no fear. He put Isaac on the altar.
[1:34:32] The angel called, "Hold your hand." If
[1:34:34] the angel didn't talk to fast, Isaac
[1:34:37] dead on the altar.
[1:34:44] And for that obedience
[1:34:46] and submission, God said, "Now I know
[1:34:49] that you fear me and you love me."
[1:34:51] Hallelujah. And in blessing, I will
[1:34:52] bless thee. Watch this. Watch this. The
[1:34:56] blessing only fall on Abraham. You know,
[1:34:58] upon thy seed, and thy seed shall
[1:35:02] possess. So when your blessing under
[1:35:04] obedience, under submission, when that
[1:35:07] blessing hit you, it's not just for you,
[1:35:09] it's for your house. Oh, give the Lord a
[1:35:12] shout. Give the Lord praise.
[1:35:17] So you can't fight just for yourself.
[1:35:19] You're fighting for your house. Ask for
[1:35:22] me and my house. You're fighting for
[1:35:24] your life. You're fighting for your
[1:35:26] family. Listen. Devil's against them.
[1:35:30] Devils want to take over them. The
[1:35:33] children, the teenagers, the devil is
[1:35:35] after them. Oh, glory to God. Do you
[1:35:37] understand that? Devil's after
[1:35:39] marriages. Devils after homes. Devils
[1:35:42] after husbands, devils after wives,
[1:35:45] devils after mothers, devils after
[1:35:47] fathers. You can't sit like if it's not
[1:35:49] so. We wrestling against flesh and
[1:35:51] blood.
[1:35:54] [Applause]
[1:35:56] [Music]
[1:35:57] [Applause]

[1:36:10] Hallelujah. Glory.
[1:36:13] Glory.
[1:36:15] Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus.
[1:36:21] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Here's the
[1:36:23] secret.
[1:36:26] The word is in the bride.
[1:36:30] I wonder how they got there.
[1:36:34] I wonder how they got there. The word is
[1:36:37] in the bride. Amen. You can look back in
[1:36:40] the Bible and see how Jesus was serving
[1:36:42] these disciples promises. The works I do
[1:36:44] shall do also. That was the word.
[1:36:48] He was giving them the word. Amen. And
[1:36:50] then he tell them one time prophecy. You
[1:36:53] shall receive power. Amen. After the
[1:36:55] Holy Ghost come upon you. Yes, sir. He
[1:36:58] was giving them things they didn't
[1:36:59] understand. He was giving them things
[1:37:01] wasn't revealed to them yet. In his
[1:37:03] resurrection private ministry to his
[1:37:05] disciples, he opened their understanding
[1:37:06] and open the word. Now they knew what
[1:37:09] they're about to receive. Amen. So
[1:37:10] there's no issue about Jesus leaving
[1:37:12] now. They trying to hold on to don't

[1:42:54] before you could have any crop, no
[1:42:56] matter how much you sow the seed, it's
[1:42:58] got to have light to ripen that seed or
[1:43:01] it won't do no good.

[1:43:32] the bride will say the same thing.
[1:43:35] Because what came out William Brandon
[1:43:37] mouth wasn't William Brandon's mouth was
[1:43:39] the spirit speaking expressly.
[1:43:43] Oh give the Lord a shout in the house.

[1:43:47] [Applause]
[1:43:49] So when you leave here and you open your
[1:43:51] spoken word with books, you're supposed

[1:43:58] this coming with fire because he make
[1:44:01] his ministers a flame of fire. Oh, give
[1:44:03] the Lord a shout in the house. He does
[1:44:06] that. Yes. Amen. Amen.
[1:44:11] The seed is being preached and the son
[1:44:14] of God is ripening that seed by
[1:44:17] vindicating it, making it push out
[1:44:21] before you and proving it is right. Yes,

[1:44:27] 1965.
[1:44:29] Hallelujah. 20th of November.
[1:44:31] Hallelujah. The prophet is about to
[1:44:33] leave the earth.
[1:44:35] And he is speaking. I believe the church
[1:44:38] is beginning to hear the message. Yes.

[1:44:48] Hallelujah.
[1:44:50] We have got to lay in the presence of
[1:44:53] the son. Yes sir. How minister could
[1:44:56] take that out of me? We got to hear this
[1:44:58] man. We had to hear this man shut up. We
[1:45:00] ought to hear none of you. We have got
[1:45:03] to lay in the presence of the sun. We
[1:45:07] have got to be ripened. So what is he
[1:45:10] saying? Presence ripens. Amen. Yes. Yes.
[1:45:15] Yes. Yes. Yes. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:45:18] For your seed to get ripe, for you to
[1:45:21] get ripe, you have to come into
[1:45:23] presence.
[1:45:25] Hallelujah.
[1:45:29] Not after service a special that not
[1:45:31] presence that is special after the
[1:45:33] service
[1:45:40] intellectually we are hearing the
[1:45:42] message
[1:45:43] that God has given us seen the signs he
[1:45:46] showed us proven it by the Bible but how
[1:45:49] the church needs to lay in his presence
[1:45:53] till it tenders up you know and gets
[1:45:56] Sweet in the spirit.
[1:45:59] So it can bear it down. So when they say
[1:46:02] sweet, it honey now. When it say sweet,
[1:46:05] it talk about brotherly kindness. Now
[1:46:07] when they say sweet, it talk about
[1:46:08] forgiveness. Now when they say sweet is
[1:46:10] an atmosphere.
[1:46:13] Hallelujah.
[1:46:15] Hallelujah. So you're harsh, cruel, say
[1:46:19] anything, come to your mouth like some
[1:46:21] say, I have no lid for my mouth. You
[1:46:22] better put a lid in your mouth. That's
[1:46:23] right. Because here we'll get a lid for
[1:46:25] your mouth. Amen. Amen. And they say
[1:46:28] that in a boal way. I know lift from my
[1:46:30] mouth and I speak from my heart. Yeah.
[1:46:33] From the abundance of the heart, the
[1:46:34] mouth will speak. So when you speak that
[1:46:36] kind of thing, you know what coming
[1:46:37] inside the heart.
[1:46:43] How the need to lay in his presence till
[1:46:45] the tenders, you know, get sweet in the
[1:46:46] spirit so he can beat them.
[1:46:50] Amen. I'm going to go on. Hallelujah.
[1:46:54] We see nations breaking. Israel
[1:46:57] awakening. Yes. The signs that the Bible
[1:46:59] fortold for this day. Yes. We see the
[1:47:01] mechanical things taking place. Now the
[1:47:03] spirit. Yes. Come on. He's seen what it
[1:47:06] is. Yes. The spirit, the dynamics of
[1:47:10] that promised word. Amen. So the word
[1:47:13] promise.
[1:47:15] That's just word. Yes. Yes. But there's
[1:47:17] a spirit behind it. Yes. Yes. Yes.
[1:47:19] Hallelujah. When when Isaiah said a
[1:47:21] virgin shall conceive, that was the
[1:47:23] promise
[1:47:25] that circle the earth because Mary come
[1:47:28] yet 400 years Mary not dead. Yes. So
[1:47:30] what the word go do? The word had to
[1:47:32] keep circling until Mary come. When Mary
[1:47:34] come, the word have a rest. The word the
[1:47:37] word coming over her now an anointing
[1:47:40] watching her. She is born a light over
[1:47:42] her. She see it. She doesn't know it.
[1:47:44] She is 6 years old. Angel can't talk to
[1:47:47] her yet because she can't produce
[1:47:49] nothing at 6 years old. They had to wait
[1:47:50] until she had the right age for the Hail
[1:47:53] Mary. Amen. Highly favored. Lord is with
[1:47:56] thee. Blessed are thou amongst women.
[1:47:58] Hallelujah. Amen. Mary had one question
[1:48:02] because she knew they preaching that
[1:48:04] long time. A virgin shall conceive. She
[1:48:06] knew how shall these things be? He said
[1:48:10] the Holy Ghost. Amen. The Holy Ghost.
[1:48:12] Amen. The Holy Ghost. Amen. It's the
[1:48:15] same Holy Ghost. It's still the Holy
[1:48:17] Ghost. You can't react. It's the Holy
[1:48:19] Ghost. You can't talk about is the Holy
[1:48:21] Ghost. Oh, glory to God shall overshadow
[1:48:24] thee.
[1:48:28] Hallelujah.
[1:48:34] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:48:36] Hallelujah. You see how the devil trap
[1:48:38] some of them say think and they are the
[1:48:39] Holy Ghost lying to them. That is true.
[1:48:42] So then when they are the Holy Ghost,
[1:48:44] they can't look for the Holy Ghost
[1:48:45] because it already it can't come upon
[1:48:47] them because they are it. Yes. They have
[1:48:49] to go just like that straight to the
[1:48:50] tribulation like that.
[1:48:52] But when that spirit came upon Mary, she
[1:48:56] was so excited she run to her cousin.
[1:48:59] She had feel nothing. You sit here and
[1:49:02] want to feel this and feel that and feel
[1:49:03] the other. Why don't you feel to repent?
[1:49:05] That want a feel to feel something. Feel
[1:49:07] to repent this morning. Get that
[1:49:09] feeling. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. She

[1:49:15] in Elizabeth woman and John a move yet.
[1:49:17] John still keeping quiet. He said, "The
[1:49:20] angel come to me. Tell me, I'm going to

[1:49:23] When John hear that, John start to
[1:49:24] rejoice. Amen. In the womb.
[1:49:27] Oh, give the Lord a shout in the house.
[1:49:30] Amen. You had to shout. You got to start
[1:49:31] some point in time, you know. You had to
[1:49:33] praise God for healing in advance.

[1:50:25] them laugh. Make s of noise and noise
[1:50:28] and noise and noise and shout and and
[1:50:30] couldn't give a shout to praise.
[1:50:34] I was in Catholic church
[1:50:37] and Catholic have no shout of praise. I
[1:50:39] was an acolyte.
[1:50:44] So for me to come from that to this is
[1:50:50] when I tell the priest I see the Bible
[1:50:51] here I say call man father
[1:50:54] he gave me such a clout
[1:50:56] behind my head. Oh yeah, I think I ski
[1:50:59] out the whole time.

[1:51:35] Calvary. Oh, I go on. I go on Calvary.

[1:51:42] you. Yes. Now if you're not willing and
[1:51:44] lamblike and you don't have and you
[1:51:46] don't have and and you have that
[1:51:48] rebellion thing or what when that spirit
[1:51:49] come you will say is it you lord
[1:51:53] yes God said this is the way to calvary
[1:51:55] are you sure yes yes s pray for me I
[1:51:59] hearing things in my head
[1:52:01] I don't know the voice of god determin
[1:52:03] to doubt to myself and behaving how I
[1:52:05] behaving it's god talking to you
[1:52:08] hallelujah because bible said Jesus was
[1:52:11] what full of the holy ghost And he was
[1:52:13] led by what? The spirit enter the
[1:52:15] wilderness to be tested. He had led and
[1:52:17] he had to go a deacon with him and elder
[1:52:19] with him. Come on, brethren. Back me up.
[1:52:21] Hold me up. Hold me up. No, he he faced
[1:52:25] his issues alone.
[1:52:29] You know, my wife not not supporting me
[1:52:31] and and that's why I weak.
[1:52:36] my husband to pray with me,
[1:52:41] all that foolishness will disappear.
[1:52:44] Amen.
[1:52:46] The spirit, the dynamics of the promised
[1:52:49] word to get into his church and drive
[1:52:52] them to Calvary yonder and in the
[1:52:54] rapture. Amen. So, the destination is
[1:52:57] the rapture. We're on a journey.
[1:52:59] We have to make a stop at Calvary. Yes,
[1:53:01] sir. Amen. Glory to continue the
[1:53:03] journey. Hallelujah.
[1:53:05] So now when I'm traveling, I have to go
[1:53:07] maybe Ghana or some country. I might fly
[1:53:09] to Miami and then stop there and then
[1:53:11] fly to um Heathro and then fight to
[1:53:13] Ghana. You have stops along the way. But
[1:53:17] the stop is not the destination. Your
[1:53:19] stops is where you pause to get the next
[1:53:21] part of the journey. This is part of it.
[1:53:24] Amen. So the Greeks came and said, "Sir,
[1:53:26] we will see Jesus." Amen. They came to
[1:53:28] the disciples. These disciples now say,
[1:53:31] "Come here. Come here. Come on. Let me
[1:53:32] explain this to you." And the disciples
[1:53:34] now these disciples brought them
[1:53:35] straight to Jesus. Amen. And Jesus
[1:53:37] didn't say I am the man you know you're
[1:53:38] looking for. It is me you're looking
[1:53:39] for. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right.
[1:53:41] You see me. How can I help you? God God
[1:53:44] bless you for coming to see me.
[1:53:46] Jesus didn't talk that you know. When
[1:53:48] they came he said except a corner we
[1:53:51] fall on the ground and die. In other
[1:53:52] words, you can't see me until you go to
[1:53:54] Calvary. You cannot see me until you die
[1:53:57] in death. You will see me.
[1:54:00] So don't come looking for some flesh
[1:54:02] thing.
[1:54:03] Come and understand this spirit of the
[1:54:05] promised word here is to drive you to
[1:54:07] the cross.
[1:54:10] Hallelujah.
[1:54:12] That's the problem. You know why you say
[1:54:14] amen? You know, you don't want to die.
[1:54:16] You want to be you.
[1:54:18] Um
[1:54:20] have things f have a song. I did it my
[1:54:24] way.
[1:54:32] Don't do it. Do it again. Don't sing
[1:54:34] that song.
[1:54:36] All right. So watch this. Now God have
[1:54:40] to give us faith.
[1:54:42] God have to give us virtue. God has to
[1:54:45] give us that knowledge. Amen. And then
[1:54:47] something has to happen right there. And
[1:54:49] that's why as a question is it that this
[1:54:52] temperance is an evidence of death
[1:54:54] having effect? Yes. Amen. My God. So he
[1:54:58] gave us a start to this road to
[1:55:00] perfection. Yes. He gave us this start
[1:55:02] to adoption. Yes. And that's why I love
[1:55:04] that scripture. As many as receive him
[1:55:06] the word to them give you power to
[1:55:08] become. It doesn't guarantee it. And
[1:55:11] that is where Israel make them mistake.
[1:55:13] And we'll go down to the scriptures now.
[1:55:15] Why we should consider what happened to
[1:55:17] them that it would happen to us? Because
[1:55:20] these things happen for our examples.
[1:55:22] Yes sir. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Hallelujah.
[1:55:25] Is that right? Amen. So then when we die
[1:55:27] out, we can produce temperance,
[1:55:29] patience, godliness, brotherly kindness.
[1:55:33] God will not come down to clean up your
[1:55:36] mess for you. Certain things you have to
[1:55:37] do. Even your phone could tell you how
[1:55:39] long you're on the phone. But I
[1:55:41] recognize my hours going downwards. How
[1:55:43] long you use your phone, it have that
[1:55:45] too. It's how you choose to spend your
[1:55:47] time. But let's go on to this. All
[1:55:49] right. Baram says this Holy Spirit
[1:55:52] coming in the last days has to be
[1:55:54] exactly be the life of Christ in the
[1:55:56] church. Amen. And the world laughs at
[1:55:58] that. So the Holy Spirit we talking
[1:56:00] about is going to be the life of Christ.
[1:56:05] Amen. Not some minister saying that the
[1:56:07] Holy Spirit. No, the life of Christ is
[1:56:09] the Holy Spirit talking about which is
[1:56:11] the person of Christ. Is that right? So
[1:56:13] watch she said now there's got to be a
[1:56:15] ministry in the church the true church
[1:56:17] of living God to where where the
[1:56:18] headstone come Christ here we go or the
[1:56:21] ministry of Christ will fit it right
[1:56:23] together. Amen. That's why I told the
[1:56:25] ministers and brothers this adopted
[1:56:27] ministry is the ministry of Jesus Christ
[1:56:29] is not my ministry. It's Jesus ministry
[1:56:33] but Abraham went into it by three pulls.
[1:56:34] First pull second pull third pull. when
[1:56:37] he begins signs his early ministry, he
[1:56:39] said, "I listen represent the faith by
[1:56:44] way of a divine gift." In other words,
[1:56:46] he didn't have the person yet, but the
[1:56:48] gift in him was identifying this is
[1:56:49] Christ works being done. Afterwards, he
[1:56:52] veiled Christ. Yes, sir. And Christ was
[1:56:54] in him till people thought he was
[1:56:56] Christ. You understand what I'm saying?
[1:56:58] So you the prayer have the word in you
[1:57:00] and the dynamics coming to you to anoint
[1:57:03] what is inside of you that you could add
[1:57:06] add add until the cap comes over you
[1:57:10] charity
[1:57:11] the bond of perfectness to cover your
[1:57:13] whole being that there'll be no leaks in
[1:57:16] the building because he say you have
[1:57:17] leaking knowledge leaking temperance
[1:57:18] leaking patience but when charity comes
[1:57:20] it seal the whole thing and you are
[1:57:23] sealed in and of course the devil is
[1:57:25] sealed out give the Lord some praises
[1:57:27] amen Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:57:30] Brother, the headstone was rejected,
[1:57:32] right? But God will send it. Amen. It
[1:57:35] would fit all the building together.
[1:57:37] Yes, sir. And now we as we see the
[1:57:40] ministry from Christ begin to narrow up
[1:57:41] to the complete ministry of Jesus
[1:57:43] Christ, the fullness of the Holy Spirit.
[1:57:45] Amen. Amen. Good time. All right.
[1:57:48] Hallelujah. Come on. Now water, blood,
[1:57:51] spirit, the elements that came from his
[1:57:53] body, it come from his body is the
[1:57:56] material to make his bride. So the bride
[1:57:59] is water, blood, spirit. Amen. Then he
[1:58:03] said this here. Now this last great step
[1:58:07] must come into the perfection. Amen.
[1:58:10] That the Holy Spirit has to live in that
[1:58:12] church so perfectly.
[1:58:15] Amen. So far no teaching, revelation,
[1:58:19] mysteries. We talking about the Holy
[1:58:21] Spirit in the church. One time he
[1:58:23] prophesy about the seven thunders, him
[1:58:25] coming into the church. Then then you
[1:58:26] will see him moving in and out. And then
[1:58:29] we are worshiping the living Christ. Him
[1:58:32] moving in and out among us. Amen. Could
[1:58:34] you imagine him come among us this
[1:58:35] morning? Amen. How we will behave. Amen.
[1:58:38] You will know him as moving. Amen. When
[1:58:40] Baron was on the platform, he said, "You
[1:58:41] know what I'm waiting on?" Then he is
[1:58:43] here.
[1:58:44] And everybody feel the anointing coming
[1:58:46] to the building. Have no teaching to
[1:58:48] explain that. It have no revelation to
[1:58:50] reveal that is him coming in the
[1:58:52] building. Then you know he is here. Then
[1:58:54] every doomed devils is on the run. Oh
[1:58:57] glory. Then sickness begin to tremble.
[1:58:59] Cancer begins to tremble. Your chains
[1:59:01] that you have bind is that to get a
[1:59:04] break over you. Oh, give the Lord some
[1:59:05] praises. Then you feel the power of
[1:59:08] freedom. Oh, glory to God. Then you know
[1:59:11] about who the son of man set free is.
[1:59:14] free and indeed give the Lord some
[1:59:21] hallelujah.
[1:59:23] [Applause]
[1:59:32] Colossians 3 verse 12 Paul speaks about
[1:59:35] put on therefore bearing one another. So
[1:59:37] this here is Christian life. Yes,
[1:59:41] there's not doctrine and there's not
[1:59:43] teaching on vials and plagues and woes
[1:59:45] and the first one, the second woe and
[1:59:47] and fifth war and the sixth woe and all.
[1:59:48] Then not this. This is after all the
[1:59:51] revelations you have. See how this
[1:59:53] working out now. Amen. After all the
[1:59:56] mysteries revealed, see how this working
[1:59:58] out in your pattern now. Put on as the
[2:00:02] elect of God. Yes, sir. As the elect put
[2:00:04] this on. Yes, sir. Holy and beloved
[2:00:06] bowels of mercy. Amen. Amen. kindness,
[2:00:09] humblless of mind, meekness, and
[2:00:10] longsuffering.
[2:00:12] I bump up somebody, some whole
[2:00:14] philosophers talk about to know
[2:00:15] somebody's highly intelligent, they are
[2:00:17] kind. That's a big one.
[2:00:21] It easy to be have knowledge and power
[2:00:23] and you're rough and gruff and whatnot.
[2:00:25] But he says when you see somebody really
[2:00:27] intelligent, they are very kind. Yes.
[2:00:31] What did prophet say?
[2:00:33] He said when you are a great man, you
[2:00:34] make others feel great. Yes. Yes. Yes.
[2:00:38] Yes. Yes. Yes.
[2:00:41] You make the other person real big
[2:00:45] because you're big enough to do that.
[2:00:46] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[2:00:50] It have some I wouldn't talk about that
[2:00:52] man.
[2:00:54] I can't get deported. I I
[2:01:00] when you see you not that big, you're
[2:01:02] looking for every attention, every news.
[2:01:05] Good news, bad news. You want to be in
[2:01:06] the news? Yes. Yes.
[2:01:10] Above all things. Okay. Okay. I'll read
[2:01:12] this. So put on therefore the elect of
[2:01:13] God, holy beloved, bolds of mercies,
[2:01:16] kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness,
[2:01:19] longsuffering. Amen. Forbearing one
[2:01:21] another. One, two, forgiving one
[2:01:24] another. If any man have a quarrel
[2:01:26] against any, even as Christ forgive you,
[2:01:29] so also do ye. You have no authority to
[2:01:32] go on Facebook and spread your quarrel.
[2:01:33] You have no authority to go and call
[2:01:34] nobody and you know we do and and no
[2:01:37] above all these things put on charity
[2:01:40] which is the bond of perfectness. Amen.
[2:01:42] And war things and reading war things
[2:01:44] and all kind of banal things. A no peace
[2:01:46] there because you're in that spirit and
[2:01:49] mode. So the first person come is po
[2:01:52] because you're in that po mode.
[2:01:55] You understand that? Yes. Let the peace
[2:01:57] of God rule in your hearts to which also
[2:02:00] you are called in one body and be
[2:02:02] thankful.
[2:02:03] Why would Paul put that there? Because
[2:02:05] there are some people not thankful. Yes.
[2:02:07] Because they have the I long. Amen.
[2:02:10] They're looking at what somebody else
[2:02:11] have. So anytime they see something they
[2:02:14] say I want that.
[2:02:18] So they're not thankful for what they
[2:02:19] have. Thank you Lord for this. Thank you
[2:02:20] Lord for that. But they want,
[2:02:24] let the word of Christ dwell in you
[2:02:26] richly in all wisdom, teaching and
[2:02:28] admonishing one another in psalms and
[2:02:30] hymns, spiritual songs, singing with
[2:02:32] grace in your hearts to the Lord. And
[2:02:34] whatsoever you do,
[2:02:37] whatsoever means just that. In word or
[2:02:39] deed, do all in the name of the Lord
[2:02:42] Jesus Christ, giving thanks to God the
[2:02:44] Father by him. Wives, submit yourselves
[2:02:46] unto your own husbands as is fit to the
[2:02:48] Lord. Dare I say to every man, they say
[2:02:50] your own husbands, husband loves your
[2:02:53] wives and a clause right there are be
[2:02:55] not bitter against them because they
[2:02:58] will do stuff. Yes.
[2:03:01] I ain't staying there long so don't
[2:03:02] worry. Children, obey your parents in
[2:03:05] all things for is well pleasing unto the
[2:03:07] Lord. Fathers, happy Father's Day.
[2:03:10] Fathers, provoke not your children to
[2:03:12] anger. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Lest they
[2:03:15] be discouraged. Yes. servants, obey in
[2:03:19] all things your masters according to the
[2:03:21] flesh, not with eye service as men
[2:03:23] pleasers, but in singleness of heart and
[2:03:26] fearing God. Whatever you do, do it
[2:03:28] heartily. Amen. As to the Lord, not unto
[2:03:32] men, knowing that of the Lord you shall
[2:03:35] receive the reward of inheritance, for
[2:03:37] you serve the Lord Jesus. Amen. So in
[2:03:40] this chapter, Paul addresses husbands,
[2:03:43] wives, fathers, servants, children. He
[2:03:47] addressed all of them calling them to
[2:03:49] mature Christian living. Amen. Amen.
[2:03:52] Amen.
[2:03:54] Let me repeat that. Calling them to
[2:03:57] mature Christian living.
[2:04:00] Whatever state you're in, how to behave
[2:04:04] yourself. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[2:04:06] Whether you're a servant, whether you're
[2:04:08] a father, whether you're a wife, Amen.
[2:04:11] Whether you're a husband or mother, how
[2:04:14] to behave yourself. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[2:04:19] And if you think this is just me talking
[2:04:21] that, let the prophet say that to you.
[2:04:25] Dear Jesus, help us tonight now in these
[2:04:28] few words as we wait upon thee. We pray
[2:04:30] that your mercy and grace will be with
[2:04:32] us.
[2:04:33] He said, "And may we have such a great
[2:04:35] meeting till there will not be an unsafe
[2:04:36] person among us. All the children will
[2:04:39] be in the kingdom of God. Those without
[2:04:42] the baptism of the spirit, may they
[2:04:44] receive it, Father." Amen. Here we go.
[2:04:47] May all the great mysteries that we are
[2:04:50] supposed to know at that age, at this
[2:04:52] age, be unveiled to us, Lord. That we
[2:04:55] will see the plainness of God, so that
[2:04:58] we will know how to behave ourselves.
[2:05:03] and act correcting ourselves and
[2:05:07] bringing the members of our body into
[2:05:10] discipline to the word. Amen. Amen. That
[2:05:13] we might know how to live in this
[2:05:15] present day at the approaching of the
[2:05:17] Lord Jesus. Amen. Amen. Amen. So here we
[2:05:18] go now. May all the great mysteries we
[2:05:20] are supposed to know at this age be
[2:05:22] unveiled to us. What is the purpose?
[2:05:25] That we might see the plainness of God.
[2:05:27] Amen. So we will know how to behave
[2:05:30] ourselves. Amen. Understand this. When
[2:05:34] Moses come to the children of Israel and
[2:05:35] said, "God sent me." Moses is not
[2:05:37] foolish. When God appeared to Moses, he
[2:05:40] asked the question, "Who shall I say
[2:05:42] send me?" Amen. Because I going to a
[2:05:45] bunch of people. They're not easy. Amen.
[2:05:48] They wouldn't receive me in my name. I
[2:05:51] can't say I'm Moses, I come to deliver
[2:05:52] you. The amount of licks, they will
[2:05:54] start to beat him up because I talk. You
[2:05:57] understand that? He going to become he's
[2:06:00] a stalker. So he asked God who shall I
[2:06:03] say send me Moses tell them I am. So
[2:06:07] when he come he had a message I am. And
[2:06:10] what Moses do now drop plagues and
[2:06:12] flies. So when the people start to see
[2:06:14] God in his plainness them say witness
[2:06:17] the source that Moses connect to. It's
[2:06:20] real. It's God. Remember Pharaoh had
[2:06:23] their gods, you know, and people
[2:06:25] thinking that Pharaoh had a head head of
[2:06:27] gold and head of whatever he had snake
[2:06:29] head and all the heads they have they
[2:06:31] working for them because they in power
[2:06:33] and when you see people in power there
[2:06:35] there attributed things all kind of
[2:06:36] thing this God this God they need money
[2:06:39] god here
[2:06:41] they building God here they have what
[2:06:42] kind of gods but when Moses come and
[2:06:45] demonstrate the power of God they say
[2:06:47] wait a minute whatever power you have
[2:06:50] what source you have is realmen Now God
[2:06:53] tell Moses, "Bring them people because
[2:06:54] they don't know me. Bring them out
[2:06:56] because they have no revelation who I
[2:06:58] am. You know who I am. You felt my
[2:07:01] power. You saw my presence." Oh, the
[2:07:03] Lord has shout. They don't know that.
[2:07:05] They're only seeing miracles. They only
[2:07:07] seeing signs. They're only seeing
[2:07:09] wonders. But they are see me yet. Bring
[2:07:11] them to this mountain. Oh, the Lord has
[2:07:13] shouted the house. And we have young
[2:07:16] people, they don't know God. They have
[2:07:18] never felt his presence. They never got
[2:07:20] an experience. They only come to church.
[2:07:22] But we want to bring you to that
[2:07:24] mountain. We want to bring you into that
[2:07:26] presence. Bring you into that fire. Oh,
[2:07:28] give the Lord a shout. Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:07:35] So that's why let's let's go. That's why
[2:07:37] God rebuked Moses when Moses went down
[2:07:40] to cry because we had seen in front of
[2:07:41] him, Pharaoh behind him, and mountain on
[2:07:43] both sides. God said, "Why cry unto me?
[2:07:45] Speak. Speak and move forward." You
[2:07:47] supposed to know that they have a
[2:07:49] destination to come to this mountain.
[2:07:51] You're supposed to know nothing must
[2:07:53] stop. You're supposed to know thy seed
[2:07:55] shall possess the case of the enemy. Oh,
[2:07:58] glory to God. When Moses catches back
[2:08:00] himself, stand still and see the
[2:08:02] salvation of the Lord your God. Red Sea,
[2:08:05] open up. Oh, glory to God. And they walk
[2:08:08] on dry ground. Give the Lord a shout.
[2:08:12] [Music]
[2:08:14] Let me see it.
[2:08:16] They come out Moses going up the
[2:08:18] mountain to get further instructions.
[2:08:21] Man feeling she stay too long. That one
[2:08:24] the message now know people say we
[2:08:26] staying too long. We say the same
[2:08:27] promises over and over. Somebody say

[2:08:46] headstone is coming. Fire is coming.

[2:08:55] And Russia coming too. Atomic power
[2:08:58] coming too. Judgment coming too. We
[2:09:01] better be ready.
[2:09:04] [Music]
[2:09:07] You're fine. Move this thing along.
[2:09:12] Look around for
[2:09:14] which elder backs.
[2:09:16] Who want no revelation?
[2:09:18] Aan you know to make them cause you to
[2:09:21] help them kind of thing.
[2:09:24] I not that you know. Come on.
[2:09:27] Suppose Moses dead up there. So long you
[2:09:30] up there now.
[2:09:32] Much years we need message. Hallelujah.

[2:12:20] Venus and Mars and everybody else.
[2:12:23] I tell people point blank 10 ministers
[2:12:25] point blank. I have no gift to read no
[2:12:27] stars. That's not my calling.
[2:12:31] So I have no gift to read no stars.
[2:12:34] That's not my calling.
[2:12:37] So the mysteries of God, he's not dead.
[2:12:42] Because time passed so long and you
[2:12:44] haven't seen what you think you're
[2:12:45] supposed to see. You know how long I
[2:12:47] look for that prophecy fulfilled when
[2:12:48] they take the pope of America since the
[2:12:50] early part of the message. We knew that.
[2:12:52] Brother George remember that long time
[2:12:54] you look 2025 he stepped out of the
[2:12:57] Bible. Step out of the prophecy rather
[2:12:58] and he's there. So he's in his position.
[2:13:03] When are you going to step out of you
[2:13:05] and get into your position?
[2:13:12] God want you in your position because in
[2:13:15] your position is where you have the
[2:13:17] power.
[2:13:18] Hallelujah. This is not power by
[2:13:20] anointing. This is by power by
[2:13:22] revelation of who you are. Amen.
[2:13:26] That why Jesus didn't come
[2:13:28] and Jesus had all kind of drama to raise
[2:13:30] somebody from the dead or heal some sick
[2:13:34] Jesus said arise take out the bed and
[2:13:36] walk
[2:13:38] no before he said that thy sins be
[2:13:40] forgiven thee they start to complain
[2:13:42] grumbling oh you forgive sins when he go
[2:13:44] for your sins he said to show you like I
[2:13:46] could do the boat you said man take a
[2:13:48] bed and walk you man take a bed and walk
[2:13:50] in close the argument
[2:13:53] amen Amen.
[2:13:54] Glory. God going in and close the
[2:13:57] argument just now. He going to stop them
[2:13:59] out of the critics. He going to get them
[2:14:01] a chance to laugh because we have to get
[2:14:03] bear the reproach of baroness. Amen. You
[2:14:06] have to walk this road of baroness where
[2:14:08] you can't produce nothing. Hallelujah.
[2:14:10] All you have is a testimony. God said
[2:14:12] so. I'm going to have a son. His name is
[2:14:13] Isaac. He's have a relish inside your
[2:14:15] heart. You're you're barren. You can't
[2:14:16] produce nothing. You can't show nothing.
[2:14:18] But yet you know you're a son. You know
[2:14:20] you're called. You know you're standing
[2:14:21] on your word. You know you're true to
[2:14:23] the cause. Amen. And your heart is
[2:14:26] right. Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[2:14:30] Let me see if I can close up here. Let
[2:14:32] me see what page I reach. Hallelujah.
[2:14:34] Nine out of 16. Hallelujah. Get a pump,
[2:14:36] boy.
[2:14:38] So, let's talk a little bit about this
[2:14:40] middle guy here. This green guy called
[2:14:42] temperance. Brother, fourthly, he said
[2:14:45] temperance. Add temperance. We got to
[2:14:46] cut temperance. Now, you had faith,
[2:14:49] then virtue, then knowledge. You're
[2:14:52] going to add temperance. Temperance,
[2:14:54] here we go, doesn't mean stop drinking
[2:14:56] alcohol.
[2:14:59] Temperance doesn't mean alcoholic cure.
[2:15:02] Not in this case. This is Bible
[2:15:05] temperance. Amen. Holy Spirit
[2:15:07] temperance. We are talking about Holy
[2:15:10] Spirit temperance. That means, are you
[2:15:13] ready? How to control your tongue. Yes.
[2:15:19] I hope the tongues inside here say amen.
[2:15:25] The first thing he identify in this word
[2:15:28] called temperance. How
[2:15:31] to control your tongue because power of
[2:15:35] life and death lies in the tongue.
[2:15:40] Amen. That's why ask the question is
[2:15:43] this virtue, this temperance a sign of
[2:15:46] death. A sign of people dying. Yes.
[2:15:50] Because let's continue.
[2:15:52] It means how to control your tongue. Not
[2:15:53] to be a tatler. How to control your
[2:15:56] temper. Not to fly off every time
[2:15:57] anybody speaks cross to you. Amen.
[2:15:59] Sometime you can't speak cross to them.
[2:16:01] You know just speaking to them is a
[2:16:02] problem. Not cross.
[2:16:05] Next level. Boy, a lot of us going to
[2:16:08] fall off before we get started. Then we
[2:16:11] wonder, here we go, why God is not in
[2:16:13] his church doing miracles and things
[2:16:16] like they used to.
[2:16:19] This message is real, you know. This is
[2:16:21] solid as a rock, you know.
[2:16:24] Temperance.
[2:16:26] How to answer in kindness
[2:16:29] when wrath is spoke to you.
[2:16:33] Are you hearing this? Or this flying
[2:16:35] over your head? If it fly over the head,
[2:16:37] you want it to fly over the head and all
[2:16:39] because they supposed to fly straight
[2:16:40] inside your heart. How to answer in
[2:16:43] kindness when wrath is spoke to you.
[2:16:46] Somebody say your bunch of holy rolls
[2:16:48] down here. Don't jump out and roll up
[2:16:49] his sleeve and say no not that. Talk
[2:16:52] with godly love. Amen. Temperance,
[2:16:54] kindness. When you are ridled upon, ride
[2:16:57] not back. Let him be your example. They
[2:17:01] say if thou be son of God, turn his own
[2:17:02] into bread. He could have done it and
[2:17:04] shown he was God, but he had temperance.
[2:17:07] They call him Belove. He said, "I
[2:17:08] forgive you for that." They tell him,
[2:17:10] "Come down of the cross." He said,
[2:17:12] "Father, forgive them. They don't know
[2:17:13] what they're doing." Amen. Isn't that
[2:17:15] right? They put a rag around his head,
[2:17:17] around his eyes and hit him on the head
[2:17:19] and say, "Prophesy, who hit you?" We
[2:17:21] believe you. Your temperance. Amen. If
[2:17:24] you cut it like that, add that to your
[2:17:26] feet. If you said blow up and sass and
[2:17:28] fuss and stew and carry on, it can't
[2:17:31] add. Amen. It's got to be flexible. Oh,
[2:17:34] glory to God. That's what I just said
[2:17:36] already. When you're stubborn and you're
[2:17:37] hard, you break.
[2:17:40] When you have the flexibility of
[2:17:42] temperance and control, you could bend.
[2:17:45] Oh, glory. You could bless when somebody
[2:17:47] cursed you. You could forgive when
[2:17:49] somebody says something wrong about you.
[2:17:51] You have the flexibility. Oh, give the
[2:17:53] Lord some praises.
[2:17:55] And when your faith and your temperance
[2:17:58] becomes the same kind of the Holy Ghost
[2:18:00] temperance, then it will vulcanize with
[2:18:02] him or you add it with it. When you got
[2:18:06] the right kind of temperance like he
[2:18:08] had, it will vulcanize. If you haven't,
[2:18:10] just a man halfway s believe temperance.
[2:18:12] I ought to slap him down, but I better
[2:18:14] not temperance. I will drop a hand on
[2:18:17] him. Okay. All right. Not today.
[2:18:20] Hallelujah. I'm a deacon.
[2:18:24] That ain't the kind of temperance. Don't
[2:18:26] try to add that. All right. Amen. No
[2:18:29] wonder the church is short.
[2:18:31] No wonder the church is short. Amen.
[2:18:36] Let's reason this. Brother Brandham, I
[2:18:38] like to hear explain then come down and
[2:18:40] listen to it. I'll skip that.
[2:18:45] Hallelujah. James 3
[2:18:48] 1-10 say my brethren be not many masters
[2:18:52] knowing that we shall receive the
[2:18:53] greater condemnation for in many things
[2:18:56] we offend all if any man offend not in
[2:18:59] word the same is a perfect man and also
[2:19:03] able to bridle the whole body this is a
[2:19:05] real lesson from James he said behold we
[2:19:08] put bits in hor's mouth that they may
[2:19:10] obey us and return their whole body you
[2:19:13] take the horse's mouth and when you pull
[2:19:14] so horses to the Therefore, right?
[2:19:16] Hallelujah. Behold, the ships
[2:19:20] which though they be great are driven by
[2:19:22] fierce winds are turned with very small
[2:19:24] helm whatsoever the governor listed.
[2:19:27] Even so the tongue is a little member
[2:19:31] boasted great things. Behold a great a
[2:19:34] matter little fire kindleth. The tongue
[2:19:37] is a fire
[2:19:39] a world of iniquity. Amen. So is the
[2:19:42] tongue among our members that it
[2:19:45] defileth the whole body. Hallelujah.
[2:19:47] Brother Oid, I didn't know that so
[2:19:48] serious. Yes. And set it on fire the
[2:19:51] course of nature and it's set on fire of
[2:19:53] hell. For every kind of beasts and birds
[2:19:57] and serpents and things of the sea is
[2:19:58] tamed and has been tamed of mankind. But
[2:20:00] the tongue can no man tame. Amen. Yes.
[2:20:03] Yes. Yes. Hallelujah.
[2:20:06] Go say amen now. Amen. Amen. There's the
[2:20:08] word coming. Amen. They got I say that
[2:20:10] you know there the Bible say that you
[2:20:12] know man tame beasts man tame sea and
[2:20:15] birds and serpents. He said but the
[2:20:17] tongue no man can tame it. It is an
[2:20:19] unruly evil full of deadly poison. Dare
[2:20:23] it bless we God even the father and dare
[2:20:25] it curse we men which were made in the
[2:20:28] image and the similitude of God. Out of
[2:20:30] the mouth proceed blessing and cursing.
[2:20:32] My brethren these things ought not to
[2:20:33] be. Amen.
[2:20:36] Amen.
[2:20:38] Amen.
[2:20:40] The tongue is a world of wickedness. Let
[2:20:43] the amplify. Set among our members
[2:20:45] contaminating and depriving the whole
[2:20:46] body. Oh, let's skip on.
[2:20:50] Colossians 3 2-10, it says, "Set your
[2:20:52] affection on things above
[2:20:55] or things of the earth." Amen. We find
[2:20:58] Christ where? At the cross, not in
[2:21:01] Christmas. Some people love Christmas.
[2:21:02] You know, the Christmas tune and Santa
[2:21:04] Claus coming on the
[2:21:11] Merry Christmas.
[2:21:16] For ye are dead and your life is hidden
[2:21:18] in Christ and God. When Christ is over,
[2:21:21] life shall appear. Music come, please.
[2:21:23] Then shall he also appear with him in
[2:21:25] glory. Here we go. Mortify therefore
[2:21:29] your members which are upon the earth.
[2:21:32] fornication, uncleanness, inordinate
[2:21:35] affection, evil cuspicence,
[2:21:37] covetousness, which is idolatry, and
[2:21:39] which things sake the wrath of God come
[2:21:41] upon you disobedience, in which he also
[2:21:44] walked sometime, and you lived in them.
[2:21:46] But put off also these now who he
[2:21:49] talking to, unbelievers or church folks?
[2:21:51] Church folks, put off these anger,
[2:21:54] wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy
[2:21:56] communications out of your mouth. Lie
[2:21:58] not one to another. Amen. Seeing that
[2:22:01] you have put off the old man with his
[2:22:03] deeds. So you're addressing the liars in
[2:22:04] the church and all. All right? And put
[2:22:07] on the new man which is renewed in
[2:22:08] knowledge after the image of him that
[2:22:10] created him. All right? So this word
[2:22:12] mortify in the amplified said to kill,
[2:22:15] deaden, deprive of power the evil
[2:22:18] desires lurking in your members or your
[2:22:20] body. Those animal impulses and all that
[2:22:23] is earthly in you that is employed in
[2:22:26] sin, sexual vice, impurity, sensual
[2:22:29] appetites, unholy desires, all greed and
[2:22:31] covetousness, all for that is adultery,
[2:22:34] the deifying of self and other created
[2:22:37] things instead of God. in account of
[2:22:40] these very sins that the holy anger of
[2:22:42] God is ever coming upon the sons of
[2:22:45] disobedience.
[2:22:47] Here we go. Who obstinately oppose to
[2:22:51] the divine will. So listen, stubbornness
[2:22:53] is not a art. Stubbornness is not a
[2:22:56] blessing. Stubbornness is a blight to
[2:22:58] you.
[2:23:00] Amen.
[2:23:01] Amen.
[2:23:04] Now put away and rid yourselves
[2:23:05] completely of anger, rage, bad feeling
[2:23:08] towards others.
[2:23:11] Curses and slander, foul mouth, abuse,
[2:23:14] and shameful utterances from your lips.
[2:23:21] Are you ready?
[2:23:23] Could we take a little more? All right,
[2:23:26] brother Brandham. is one that you know
[2:23:29] when Christ the hope of glory is formed
[2:23:30] in you
[2:23:32] write with me now
[2:23:35] when Christ has been formed in you when
[2:23:38] you are dying oh you mean you have to
[2:23:40] die I'm reading it for you this is the
[2:23:43] message now when you are dying and
[2:23:45] Christ is coming to life watch the
[2:23:48] persecution setting watch trouble stack
[2:23:51] on every hand watch the devil go on a
[2:23:54] rampage
[2:23:56] so if you can handle the issue around
[2:23:57] you. Now when the devil going to ramp
[2:23:59] it, you gone.
[2:24:02] Do you understand that now? Now the baby
[2:24:05] have been formed for a long time in the
[2:24:07] womb. Message folks don't want to hear
[2:24:10] that. But Baram says the baby formed a
[2:24:13] long time, but this is the coming in the
[2:24:16] last days when the completeness, when
[2:24:19] the fullness of the Godhead, when the
[2:24:21] fullness of Christ is to be manifested
[2:24:24] among the people. Amen. And he promised
[2:24:27] it is his word. And when that fullness
[2:24:31] there is unusual things begin to happen
[2:24:33] and he promised that's the reason that
[2:24:35] the council of church is the former
[2:24:37] world council churches just the time.
[2:24:39] There we go. And I found the answer to
[2:24:41] what I've been preaching for a long
[2:24:42] time. Just the time when the church is
[2:24:45] beginning to get to its feet where the
[2:24:47] supernatural is begin to work now. They
[2:24:50] all went into the group. They're going
[2:24:51] to try to stop this stuff. And that's
[2:24:53] why I tell you, they will not stop us
[2:24:55] having books and tapes. But we see when
[2:24:57] the supernatural begins to break, that
[2:25:00] is when they're going to say, "Stop
[2:25:01] them." And before we get there, we want
[2:25:03] to kick that devil out by loving one
[2:25:06] another and forgiving one another and
[2:25:09] let the honey stick.
[2:25:12] [Applause]
[2:25:15] Almost almost done.
[2:25:17] But I'm talking about the disciples
[2:25:18] bringing the people. When you get a real
[2:25:20] discipleise that will point you to
[2:25:23] Christ, Christ will bring you to the
[2:25:25] cross where you are crucified with him.
[2:25:28] So how come I have all these bunch of
[2:25:29] believers buying the pastor's fight?
[2:25:32] If the pastor bad spirited, the whole
[2:25:33] congregation bad spirited. Is the pastor
[2:25:35] cuckoo and funny? The whole congregation
[2:25:36] cuckoo and funny. They get the man
[2:25:38] spirit. I have nothing to do with Jesus
[2:25:40] Christ. You are Christian. God call you
[2:25:43] as an individual. God call you as a
[2:25:45] group. God calls you an individual. We
[2:25:46] come here for fellowship. This is not
[2:25:48] the body of Christ. This is where we
[2:25:49] have fellowship. By one spirit, we get
[2:25:51] into the body. And when you get in that
[2:25:53] body, nobody can take you out. God put
[2:25:56] you into the body of Christ. That body,
[2:25:58] he's the head of the body called the
[2:26:00] church. I'm not the head. He's the head.
[2:26:03] He must be our head. My head and your
[2:26:05] head. Oh, glory to God. There are some
[2:26:08] people don't respect the sovereignity of
[2:26:10] the local church. The sovereignity of
[2:26:12] local church means the Holy Spirit could
[2:26:14] guide me to what to preach this morning
[2:26:16] without any foreign interference.
[2:26:19] Oh, give the Lord a shout in the house.
[2:26:21] I want to say it again. That means the
[2:26:24] Holy Spirit could direct us this morning
[2:26:26] as to what to preach without any foreign
[2:26:29] interference. I do preach with nobody
[2:26:31] else preaching. I preach as I feel led
[2:26:34] and as men are led by the sons of the
[2:26:36] spirit of God. They are the sons of God.
[2:26:38] Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah.
[2:26:42] So, the disciples brought them to
[2:26:44] Christ. Christ point them to the cross.
[2:26:47] He said Christ point them to the people
[2:26:48] to his death except a corner with four
[2:26:51] on the ground the bri alone right that's
[2:26:53] where you find Christ you don't find him
[2:26:55] by doing better turn a new page start a
[2:26:58] new life you don't find Christ you find
[2:27:00] Christ only in debt not in a manger not
[2:27:04] in a confession to believe certain
[2:27:07] creeds and fables I believe this and all
[2:27:10] you don't believe it you know yeah not
[2:27:11] how you find Christ there's a belief you
[2:27:15] don't find Christ here. A true servant
[2:27:17] taketh to him and he is the word. Christ
[2:27:21] is here in the form of the word. Amen.
[2:27:24] And the word brings life because he is
[2:27:27] the word. Amen. Christ is the word. And
[2:27:30] he is the word. He is this Bible made
[2:27:33] living. Yes sir. And when you die to
[2:27:35] yourself with Christ like a corner
[2:27:39] wheat, then the word lives in you. Amen.
[2:27:42] brings forth the same results that it
[2:27:44] did in the living corner wheat when it
[2:27:46] dropped to the earth. Yes, sir. And I'm
[2:27:47] about done. Praise the name of the Lord.
[2:27:49] Hallelujah. Give the Lord some praises
[2:27:51] here right now. Glory. Glory. Glory.
[2:27:54] Glory.
[2:27:55] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:27:58] Hallelujah. Glory.
[2:28:01] Glory.
[2:28:02] Jesus. I close with this.
[2:28:05] Let us labor.
[2:28:07] Why would God see that?
[2:28:11] I think I want to get the scripture back
[2:28:13] again.
[2:28:27] Hallelujah. Let us labor therefore to
[2:28:30] enter into that rest.
[2:28:33] And I was wondering about the word
[2:28:34] therefore. I want to know what is that
[2:28:36] there for? What is that there for? Let
[2:28:40] us labor. In other words, he is trying
[2:28:43] to tell the people don't take things for
[2:28:46] granted. Amen.
[2:28:50] Least therefore to enter into that rest
[2:28:53] least any man fall after the same man of
[2:28:56] unbelief. And I was looking back because
[2:28:58] you see that therefore means is a
[2:29:00] reference to what happened before. So I
[2:29:03] look at chapter three and chapter three
[2:29:05] is where he said, "I swear in my wrath,
[2:29:06] they shall not enter to my rest." Take
[2:29:08] heed, brethren, least the enemy be of
[2:29:11] you an evil heart of unbelief in
[2:29:14] departing from the living God. But
[2:29:17] exhort one another daily, while it is
[2:29:20] called today, least any of you be
[2:29:23] hardened through the deceitfulness of
[2:29:25] sin.
[2:29:27] Amen. I'm going to close. you can begin
[2:29:30] to play something. So in verse 10 in the
[2:29:32] amplified, so I was provoked, displeased
[2:29:36] and sorely grieved with that generation
[2:29:39] and said they always and are led astray
[2:29:42] in their hearts and they have not
[2:29:44] perceived or recognized my ways and
[2:29:47] become progressively better and more
[2:29:49] experimentally and intimately acquainted
[2:29:51] with them. Accordingly I swore in my
[2:29:53] wrath I they shall not enter my rest. So
