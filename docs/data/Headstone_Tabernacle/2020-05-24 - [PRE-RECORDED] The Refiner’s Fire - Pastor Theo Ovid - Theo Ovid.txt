the second Timothy chapter 2 we want to read from verse 19 to 22 2nd Corinthians chapter 6 wanna read from verse 14 to 18 Malachi chapter 3 wanna read from 1 to 3 we're in 2nd Timothy 2 nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure having this seal the Lord knoweth them that are his let every one that name it the name of Christ depart from iniquity iniquity is known to do right and doin wrong but in a great house they are not only vessels of gold and silver but also of wood and of earth and some to honor some to dishonor if a man therefore purge himself from these he shall be a vessel unto honor sanctified and meat for the Masters use and be paired unto every good work free also youthful lust but follow righteousness faith charity peace with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart you read from 2nd Corinthians chapter 6 who's 14 be not unequally yoked together with unbelievers for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness what communion hath light with darkness what Concord Christ will be relieved it with an infidel and what agreement had the temple of God with idols for ye are the Temple of the Living God as God hath said I will dwell in them and walk in them and I will be their God and they shall be my people wherefore come out from among them and be separate saith the Lord and touch not the unclean thing and I will receive you and will be a father unto you and he shall be my sons and daughters saith the Lord Almighty let's read from Malachi chapter 3 we live from booths one behold I send my messenger and he shall prepare the way before me and the Lord whom he seek shall suddenly come to his temple even the messenger of the Covenant whom he delights in behold he shall come saith the Lord of Hosts but who may abide the day of his coming and who shall stand when he appeared for he is like a refiners fire unlike full of soap and he shall sit other as a refiner and a purifier of silver and he shall purify the sons of Levi and purge them as gold and silver that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness may God bless his word you may be seated [Music] good morning and god bless you greeting to those connected to us on the Internet so bless them to be here this morning this morning I have a title it's the refiners fire the refiners fire our subject the fiery trial which is to try you another inspiration purged vessels ready for the Masters use that's my subject purge vessels ready for the Masters use so we see how the Lord will what Allah would do first today the subject the fiery trial which is a trial with stigma the Scriptures first Peter 4:12 to 14 which Peter said beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you as some as though some strange thing happen to you but rejoice in as much as you're partakers of Christ's sufferings but when his glory shall be revealed he may also be glad with exceedingly great joy if he be reported for the name of Christ happier ye for the spirit of glory of God rested upon you and for their parties evil spoken of but on your part he is glorified so that is where I get that that subject from that content did not strange the fiery trials that come your way Matthew 7 so we used some scriptures today Matthew 7 this is 50:29 this is Jesus words it's in red we way of false prophets they are wrong they always talking walking becoming which come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly they are ravening wolves ye shall know them by their fruits do men gather grapes of thorns or figs of thistles even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit every tree that bringeth not good fruit is hewn down cast into the fire whereby by their fruits you shall know them not everyone that sending me Lord Lord shall enter the kingdom not the lord lord momo talking not that but watch but he that went the will of my father which is in heaven so he is qualified who gonna enter he is qualified how do you get there not everybody Mali hallelujah glory glory no no no no no he is talking about doing the will of the Father all right many ways here to me in that day Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy name in thy name have cast out devils and I name done many wonderful works then I will profess unto them I never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity so then the fine print is getting deeper and deeper as to what God requires of us and this is what you are here for to find out God's requirement for your life isn't that right and therefore Jesus said whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them I will liken him unto a wise man which built his house upon a rock so this is Jesus all sinking in the teaching mysteries because mysteries was hit as parables he is sinking in now not to talk not to say Lord Lord but they that do the will of my father dinner come into obedience to my word and to my will I will tell you what kind of man that is I'm gonna tell you that Kanaka a woman that is yes he could begin to give this parable who died here at these scenes of mine here it like everybody in the message hearing and do it it I wise man which built his house upon a rock and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house it fell not for it was founded upon a rock and everyone that he already sees of mines do it them not shall be likened unto a foolish man which built his house upon the Sun the rain descended the floods came the winds blew beat upon that house and it fell and great was the fall of it on when came the pass when Jesus ended these scenes the people was punished at his doctrine and he taught them as one having Authority and not as the scribes I want to bring attention to a particular thing here not the house built but the rain that's coming notice he didn't say the house built everybody falls like a nice but that's nothing only the rain will prove what's it built on my rump is a measure called the uncommon storm only the strong will vindicate what the house is dead on only the trials we need a judgment of fire but prove what works somebody had built on it's coming it's coming to you to your home to your family to your job it's coming the churches is coming the margin is coming yes every man gonna be tried yes where is sickness weather is whatever it is it's coming and you can't stop it because it's coming are you with me hallelujah John and he is Malachi cheese scripture william branham is Malachi for John Matthew chapter 3 I indeed baptize with water unto repentance this is John and he that cometh after me is mightier than I whose shoes I am not worthy to bear and this is where we first get his introduction he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost on fire so before Christ even make his appearance John was identified this man who come in after me he's not like me at all hallelu I'm not even worried and loosed his shoes he's coming with Holy Ghost and fire hallelujah whose fan is in his hand and he shall thoroughly purge the floor and gather his wheat into the Ganner but when you burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire can commit Jesus unto Galilee unto John to be baptized of him John forbade him saying I have need to be baptized of thee come as doubt to me and Jesus answering said unto Him suffer to be so now for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness and he suffered him and Jesus when he was baptized so begins in the continues you know John come to introduce this Messiah here come the Messiah he's following the scriptures he's uh saying because I am this I do have to do that no he is humbling himself he's going to flow of the word he is well being what God said he's fulfilling righteousness it looked like a small thing but he's only get baptized and what what happened you know and watch and straightway out of the water and lo the heavens were open up and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove lighting upon him and a voice of heaven saying this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased Oh hallelu then was Jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil oh praise the name of the Lord hallelujah and that Jesus came with his earthly ministry pick up some men which he called disciples say be followers of me and I will make you fishers of men and he began to take these natural men carnal man ordinary men men with jobs and everything else I began to share the worlds of the kingdom with them and tell them they're gonna be servants in this kingdom and they will be sanctified by thy children oh and I were his truth he sanctified them and then he began to begin to expound to them and demonstrate to them the powers of the kingdom demonstrate to them the authority of the kingdom demonstrate to them the kind of things we will do in this in them by healing a second reason the dead and cast out devils and telling these same men the same words I do you wanna do also because you want to get a revelation of what kingdom you come from and my kingdom is not of this world and your kingdom is out of this world so they let the world tie you up don't be unequally open and serve it unbelieving unbelieving people outside idea free yourself from that because we come from a higher order you cover my higher life you come from a higher Kingdom all together could we get ourself in the house [Applause] oh jesus let him shade up to his exact Commission to them he said behold I send the promise of my father upon you hallelujah you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost come upon you and you shall be witnesses unto me throne in Jerusalem and to the uttermost part of the earth so Jesus came and dropped the Commission upon them to go into all the world and preach the gospel and the Cosmo wasn't in word only it was in power and demonstration so Jesus are to empower these men let his spirit which was the promise from the father underwent in the upper room on the Korean atmosphere the upper room and they went one man and one Accord and they were all made them they were believed in they were repentant they were grown in travail in they were hide him they were fearful of the people on the outside but they had a promise from the father but the holy was gonna come I went the day

maybe season for the Branum home question answers he says now watch the promise of the baptism of the Spirit which is promised all through the Old Testament and new to behold I send the promise of my father upon you and Peter said that on their Pentecost that is the promise the promise was about the built churches the promise was inevitable groups I have a bunch of groups of people and said we

the spirit age let me give a testimony from that age 1906 the 1909 Frank battle man account as an eyewitness of what happened 1906 to 1909 the fire falls at Azusa that's on the book in Azusa Street chapter 2 fire fall in Azusa just remember the nakamoto method is each no fire the power so much they were so sanctified ah God lord have mercy they live such clean lines you hear in that you listen secondly here you hear what I'm saying they live such clean lives that the Holy Ghost will come upon them ready to fill them but they just have a bucket of water when the power hit them so they throw out and I'm on the right will rise so before they get the Holy Ghost so qualified service the indemnity is by having buckets of water when you see a dump them so day that's was real good think about

Street I went to Burbank Hall the New Testament church Sunday morning April 15th a black sister was there spoken tones this created a great stir the people garden and little companies on the sidewalk after the service inquiring what this mean that's one person speak in tongues I mean at this this is new now we all know this is we never had this before so this is altogether new they're talking about it on the sidewalks inquiring what this mean is seem like a Pentecostal science we then learn that the spirit had fallen a few nights before April 9th at the little cottage on Bonnie Brae Street they had been tearing very earnestly for some time for an important answer love black and white believers have been written there daily for some reason I was not privileged to be present at that particular meeting I went to Bonnie Brae meeting in the afternoon however and found God working mightily we have been praying for many months for victory months months months waiting for victory that have to come you're not wasting a tangle of waste and prayer painful fishy that must come God promised victory God promised a Holy Ghost God promised a clean Church of glorious change without spot without wrinkle don't stop man [Applause] let me see the similar I'm struggling kids chattering don't stop it just stop to die when that wormhole on the ground and he spin that Weber on him and inside that there's a change going around that room is about to become a butterfly isn't that right and half the press this way isn't that right the chicken after press this way what about you you have it too easy and the truth is you're too lazy to keep a sensor amen on that they don't want to confess the laziness before God you are confessing to me you confess under God if you're lazy lazy where you

[Applause] Jesus for sure myself alive again the Pioneers had broken through for the militia to follow I like that the Pioneers broken true for the monitor to follow there's got to be somebody some people who take front to cut the trail to pray out to cry out or we had a powerful permanent is it going or longer my unity was cry not like that praise got a powerful prophet on Tuesday hallelujah why don't you come to prayer meeting on a Thursday night even if he's not coming to the church you should be in prayer from Harper Center half-past nine don't get off a prayer until it happens man reach because at the time we print onto almost but Tyree give someone some time there what can be positive no we pray for revival brain tribe retro wave believers are backslidden excite us pray for people have their insider here brownie the body here this presence or somewhere else woman's I was not serious there was a general spirit of humility manifested in the meeting they were taken up with God evidently the Lord had found a little company at last outside as always through whom he could have his way God had not chosen an established mission where this could be done there they were in the hands of men the spirit could not work others far more pretensions are filled that which man esteems had been passed by once more and the spirit was born again in a humble stable outside the ecclesiastical establishment our body must be prepared in repentance and humility for every point of the Spirit there was no old point of the spirit or preparation hallelujah goes on a missus of preparation John was sent to prepare for the coming of the Lord who shall stand when he comes only coming like a refiners fire are we gonna get on into it oh but he's coming and we was made from the common is coming it's right on his way he's not right Laurie the president will buy Pentecostal manifestation did not break out in a moment like a huge prairie fire and set the world on fire in fact no work of God ever appears that way there is a necessary time for preparation the finished article is not realized at the beginning men may wonder where it come from not being conscious of the preparation but there is always such every movement of the Spirit of God must also run the gauntlet of the devil's forces the dragon stands before bearing up the barren mother ready to swallow up her child so it was with the present Pentecostal work in the beginning the enemy did much counterfeiting God kept the young child well here for a season from the Herod's own tilaka gain strength and the slimmin to resist them the flame was guarded jealously by the hand of the Lord from the winds of criticism jealousy unbelief and so on it went true about the same experiences that all revivals have it falls were both inside and out both lute and Wesley experienced the same difficulties in this time we have this treasure in earthen vessels every natural business is surrounded by circumstances not entirely Pleasant God's perfect work is brought about in all our work of the Skiba every natural billet is surrounded by circumstance is not entirely Pleasant John Williams everyone spread after revival and about died out for the time Oh Lord sent us the old revival with all the defects and if this cannot be send it with all of his defects we must have a revival with defects but look it is kind of the seventh with the defects we must have a revival hallelujah praise God Adam Clark said not nature along with Satan will always mingle themselves as far as they can in the genuine work of the spirit in order to discredit and destroy it in create revival of religion it is almost impossible to prevent wildfire from getting among the true fire Oh Harlan people would say why fire away fire away fire what would you fire so then they move from Barnaby Street the 312 Azusa Street so the spray began to move in Bonnie Brae Street they switched the tree twelve Tristan number 312 Azusa Street here that resin an old frame build and formerly a Methodist Church in the center of the city but now a long time out of use from Eaton it had become a receptacle of all lumber plaster other materials cleared space enough in the surrounding dirt and debris to lay some planks on top of empty kneel kegs which seats enough for possibly 30 people if I remember rightly they were arranged in a square facing one another so it was a square tire monk was today papers rustling I was under tremendous pressure to get to the meeting that evening it was my first visit Azusa mission Mara Wheaton was living with us was going with me she was so slow that I could hardly read fur we finally reached Azusa and found about a dozen Saints deer some white some black but a CMOS deer in charge the act of God moved slowly but surely at Azusa it was kinda sure of his own appointed priests in the beginning we had no new cart in those days the priests the colonel a mixed multitude we had the devil the fight but the act was not drawn by oxen zombies the priests were live under God too much preparation and prayer discernment was not perfect and the enemy got some advantage that brought reproach to the work but the Saints should learn to take for the precious from the vial the combined forces of Hell was set determinedly against us in the beginning it was not all bless him in fact the fight was terrific as always the devil combed the country for crooked spirits to destroy the work if possible devil look for them and send them to the judge said no to the revival say you have to go dear but the fire could not be smothered gradually the tide arose and victory from a small beginning a very little flame was kindled I give a message at my first meeting in Azusa two of the same smoke and tongue such much blessing seemed to telle utterance it was soon noise abroad at quarters working at Azusa and all kind of people begin to come to the meetings many were curious and unbelieving others were hungry for God the newspapers began to ridicule booster mittens thus giving us free advertising this brought the crowds the devil overdid himself again oh my my my my my my hallelujah hallelujah Old Glory Navarre can any good thing come on Nazareth Oh glory to God hallelujah can any good thing come aboard a seventh under pride that one time insider dear yes a real revival on seventh on the Reviver Holy Ghost revival Oh glory to God hallelujah the devil within themselves outside persecution never heard the work we had the most fear from the working of evil spirits written even spiritualists hypnotic scheme to investigate and to try to influence then all you really just saw his crooks cranks came seeking a place in the work remember in Port I see give me that power that poor lad that we could do that do come o devil in the name of Jesus a Paul preached it so this is no new thing them looking for power without looking for power they're not authorized to have so watch we had the most affair from these but this is always the danger to every new work they had no place else where this condition casts off a over many that was hot overcome it hindered the spirit much many were afraid to seek God for fear that there might get them then came the earthquake San Francisco it week because surely the voice of God to the people on the Pacific coast so God had everything line up you know they are knowing the people the earthquake it that does take at the next level all together it was used mightily in conviction for the revival the Lord graciously brought afterwards in the earliest days both heaven and hell seemed to have come to town [Music] this is serious men were at the breaking point conviction was nicely on the people they would fly to pieces in on the street with or provocation a very bloodlines ended up in drawn aromas loser mission by the spirit when men came within two blocks of the space they were seized with conviction the work was getting is now the work was getting clearer and stronger at Azusa Gordon's wicked mind to me it seems that everyone had to go to Sousa missionaries were gathered from Africa India the islands of the sea preachers and workers across the continent will come from distant land with an irresistible drawing to Los Angeles gadhimai scenes together they had come before Pentecost door did little realize that it was God's call holiness meetings tents missions began to close up for lack of attendance their people were at Azusa brother-and-sister gar closed the burning bush wall came to Zuza we see the baptism of the spirit and was soon on their way to India to spread the fire even but there was much possible there was there was much persecution especially from the press the route is up shamefully but this only drew the crows give the work six months to live soon the middle running day and night the place was packed out nightly the whole building upstairs and down had not been cleared and put into use there were far more white people and black people coming the color line was washed away in the blood of Jesus Christ he said a as far as our translators of the New Testament declared there's loser work had rediscovered the blood of Christ to the church at the time great emphasis was placed on Christ's blood for cleansing and more a high standard was held up for a clean life oh my and that has a return a high standard for a clean life a consecrated life is a holy life a dedicated life isn't that right divine love was wonderfully manifest in the meetings the people was not even Malo an unkind word said against the apostles of the judges for the judges the message was a love of God it was a sort of first love of the early church return the baptism of the holy spirit as we receive it in the beginning did not allow us to think speak or hear evil of any man this spirit is very sensitive tender as a dove the Holy Spirit symbolizes a dove we knew the moment we had grieved the spirit by an unkind thought a word we seem to live in a sea of pure divine love the Lord for our battles for us in those days we were committed to his judgement fully in all matters and never seeking in the defender work of ourselves we live in this wonderful immediate presence are you getting the picture of what we had backed it we live in this wonderful amid presence and nothing contrary it is your spirit was a low dear the force was sifted out from the real by the Spirit of God the Word of God itself decidedly absolutely look like this the Word of God itself decided absolutely all issues and we have to come right back to that well all issues accepted by the Word of God no matter how you feel and all your teeth I would his brother say and I once seen I'm no no no by the way what it would say hallelujah the hearts of the people bowed in act and motive was searched to the very bottom love that let me read it again the hats of the people watch boot in act and motive was searched to the very bottom it was no joke to become one of that company no man is joined unto them it was no joke unless they meant business it mean a dying out and cleanup process in those days to receive the baptism it was a little more than going to church no it was a little more than that that occupying up you it was a little more than that it was people come with a baptism of the Holy Ghost people coming to be sealed people coming with a Mac of God oh can we give the Lord a shout in the house [Applause] we had a tyree room upstairs for they was especially she can go for the Holy Spirit baptism though many got it in the main assembly room also in fact they often got it in their seats in those days the Spirit worked very deeply in the tiring room and unquiet spirit or thoughtless talker was immediately reproved by the spirit that mean the spirit arresting people yeah cuz I'm talking talking talking no is a different actress altogether you have to reverence and respect the operation of the Spirit of God is my right we were on holy ground the atmosphere was unbearable to those with a common spirit the car with a leave they generally give this room a white boot unless they have been thoroughly subdued and built out that means in the cathode the Karnataka handling only on a seeker sorted those who really mean business with God it was no place to throw fits or blow steam men did not fly to their lungs and all these they flew to the mercy seat they took their shoes off figuratively speaking they were on holy ground oh my so that was a lone caption that I have from Azusa Street kind of atmosphere I appreciated [Applause] God had this man as a witness to the atmosphere that he fights only battles that herself this is brother Branham you take a chicken egg and put it in an incubator which should be under him it will hatch anyhow put it under pop it will hatch it's the warmness it's the condition that makes it hatch you could take a good like that better than that dead end it won't hatch it's the condition and that's the wait in this age we are living in you have got to find what is God's way of doing it for this age that's what Martin Luther found that's what John Wesley found that's what the Pentecostal found in their age now watch the Pentecostal there was a brother one of his eyes was out a colored brother he's Seymour who was like the lead person in that revival okay so he one eye out see like I wanna Amanda if people choose any when choose no one eye man but God choose that man all right he was laughed at because he was a Negro he was made fun of but he brought a message for that age just a boy but a buddy a little buddy fellow could hardly sign his own name but the Lord had revealed to him that this was the age for the restoration of those gifts that was his revelation we in the season and time for the gifts of tongues and interpretation of tongues all these gifts and healing to be restored hallelujah we are beyond the Methodist Church hallelujah Weiner season when God promised to restore these things all right let's go further and the Lord revealed to him and no matter what said it come but everybody here we go got in the atmosphere of it and see the were the age and God vindicated and then here comes did you see what seemed ordered now he saw the revelation and everybody came in the atmosphere of it what about you this morning we have a promise of dynamics all glory to God we have a promise of a Holy Ghost revival the person of water is taught back back in the church hallelujah praise God and then Bertram says in influence what we have seen in these last days ourselves shall put each one of us into action but you know why we don't cover our faces or no feet right or wings won't work we got these being spread out cover yourself humble yourself what we have seen happens you put every soul in action it should make a church that will make every family in Phoenix that people will be flying in from Europe that's what are available cause people to fly in people to come in we want to know what is happening oh praise God flying from Europe then see what's taken place they were serious and there's a place in Arizona called Maricopa Valley a city called Phoenix there is something broke out here until the seven thunders of Revelation 10 that's not even wrote in the Bible is being made manifest he's not talking with a sermon he's not talking about a special message he's talking about a literal manifestation of God that is promise and God promised a manifestation of God to the bride he said a bride has not a revival yet there has been no manifestation of God to stir the bride he will send it not a preacher bring it he will send it we preach the promise of it but he will send it are you looking for are you popular sprite then if your passes by God well Oh hallelujah [Applause] that's what the scripture says he's ready to come but he's gonna come Oh give the Lord a shock in the house you know when he's gonna come but he's coming but a Birnam but a Seymour was rare okay I'll just read on I'll continue this Isabella brown but ASIMO was recognized as the nominal leader in charge we had no Pope this is a man continuing now we have a big part of it I'm ready Anna we had no proper hierarchy we were brethren we had no human program the Lord Himself was leading we had no priest class no priestcraft these things come in leta with the apostasy z'n of the movement we didn't even have a platform a pulpit in the beginning we were all on the same level the ministers were servants so they didn't have an elevated platform or pulpit everybody on the same level suza Oh big man same old time Shelton Oh glory hallelujah the ministers were servants according to the true meaning of the word we did not honor men for their advantage it means or it means or education but rather on their god-given gifts he set the members on the body now a wonderful and horrible thing is is to come the past in the land no ok I'm skipping something up this is a scripture a wonderful and horrible thing has come to pass in a land the prophets prophesied falsely and the priests they rule by their means and my people love to have it so and what will be the Ender of that jeremiah after my people children are their oppressors and women rule over them Isaiah 3:12 but a similarly sat behind two empty shoe boxes one on top the other he usually kept his head inside the top of one during a permit until turn in prayer there was no pride there the services ran almost continually seeking souls could be found under the power almost any hour night and day the place was never closed nor empty the people came to meet God he was always there hence a continuous meeting the meeting did not depend upon a human leader God presence became more and more wonderful in that all building with his low rafters and their floors God took strong men and women to pieces and put them together again for his glory after mud floor strong man and woman broken before the power of God Oh what was happen when that pillar fat is sent once more rocky descended on Mount Sinai it was a tremendous overhauling process pride self-assertion self-importance self exceeds Eckstein could not serve idea the religious ego which is his own funeral sermon quickly no subjects or sermons were announced ahead of time no special speakers for such an hour no one knew what might be coming what God will do all were spontaneous order of the Spirit we wanted to hear from God to whoever he might speak we had no respect of persons the rich and educated with a deem as the poor and ignorant and found much harder than today the rich families are harder today we only recognize God all were equal no flesh my glorious presence he could only use the self only he could not use the self only recognize opinionated those were Holy Ghost meetings led of the Lord it had to start in the poor surroundings God all were equal no flesh my glorious presence he he could not use his self to keep all this selfish human element all came down your milites together at his feet they all look alike that's what we're I'm talking about all look alike isn't that right had all things in common all came down and humility together at his feet they all look alike the rafters were low the tall must come down by the time they got to who's that they were humbled ready for the blessing the food was thus pleased for the Lambs not giraffes all could reach it oh praise God we were delivered right there listen we were delivered right there from ecclesiastical here each isn't that Herrick ISM nice poop and bishop and this sort of thing and abuse we wanted God when we first reached a meetin we avoided as much as possible human contact and greetin yesterday you see what many politics well yeah do me Nadia please you coming for God you coming to meet the pillar of fire it has to change from coming I'm going to church I'm gonna see Vista they know you're coming to meet god they're coming wait and go to speak to me there's got to be a world in this service here that I know is God speaking to me you know my needs you know my condition you know what's in my home you know what's in my house I need a deliverance I need a breakthrough and either answer and even hear from you speak [Applause] we got our heads under some bench in the corner in prayer and met men only in the spirit knowing them after the flesh no more the meeting started themselves spontaneously in testimony and praise and worship the testimony was never hurried by a call for popcorn we had no prearranged program to be jumped to the time our time was the Lord's we had real testimony some fresh hot experience otherwise the shorter testimonies the better a dozen might be on their feet at one time trembling under the mighty power of God we didn't have to get a cue from from our leader we were free from lawlessness we were shut up to God and prayer in the meetings of our mind on him all obeyed God in meekness and humility in honor we preferred one another the Lord was liable to bush to anyone we prayed for this continually hallelujah some would finally get up anointed for the message all seem to recognize this and give we it might be a child a woman a man it might be found a back seat from the front it made no difference we rejoice that God was working no one wished to show himself we thought only about obeying God in fact there was an accuracy of God there that forbid anyone but a fool attempting to put himself forward with Auto real anointed I think that word reading again I think that word reading again hallelujah in fact there was an atmosphere of God there that forbade anyone but a fool attempting to put himself forward with Auto real anointed and such did not last long the spirit from the throne control the meetings those were truly wonderful days I often said I would rather live six months at that time than 50 years of ordinary life [Music] everybody life everybody receiving this is our history we can't deny looter bacardi night Wesley week are denied pen because no this is our history but board is doesn't seem today only we have changed someone might be speaking suddenly a spirited fall upon the congregation God Himself would give the order call men would fall over the house like a sling and battle or rush

out came to see themselves in all your weakness then in childlike humility and confession would take nup of God transform to the mighty baptism of the Spirit the old man died with all his pride arrogance and good works in my own case I came to abhor myself I begged the Lord to drop the hood and so close behind me on my pass that they would hit my heels he told me to forget every good deed as

debt is not an all a pleasant experience strong wind I had strong wind I had what a time is coming or this right I mean for a wonderful day it will be hot and heavy but we infer tremendous time in the Lord oh praise God for a banner from Susie's design he says no a mystery scripture a previously hidden truth no divinely revealed but supernatural elements to remain despite the revelation a scripture a mystery scripture is not right a previously hidden truth now they finally reveal it means revealed by the spirit somebody who has since area twenty years and God reveal himself to them and you can't stop that that is flesh and blood hath not revealed it to you so I could preach but it's a good spirit to reveal it to you that's why you have to come in the Spirit because the spirit can then reveal it to you and that's the rock that you build this church on that's the rock the devil can't touch that's ankle in your soul that every time gaudiya because it's a word to resume the cross and intents of the heart so when God drop that in your soul delicate touch that you can't go behind there he have no resentment of or behind you he is not the word so no your flesh me after your festival field is

but I've got to preach it because that is what he gave me to preach and I don't question what I'm given I don't preach what I see like that entice your ears these are things I need to know it's not easy to preach the standard gospel but this is what you need to know because this will help you to grow to understand when we kept in a spot listen when we finish the devil not even a picture let me say return when we are finished you will see the devil not even in a picture it's just a Potter and the clay and if you're gonna remain if you're gonna submit yourself and surrenders it yourself yourself to his molded alright but a branagh he said no I know my is okay no Elijah will not be a system it will be a man he'll be a one man anointed of the Holy Ghost and he won't introduce any tree or four gods he will introduce one the Lord Jesus Christ cause his message will shake the Pentecostal children back to the feet of the fans again so this is the message of Malachi 4 to turn our hearts back to the feet of other fathers again according to Malachi 4 is to bring them back to the faith which was once delivered to the Saints bring them back to the faith of the fathers the Pentecostal

leprosy struck him right there and he died that shook up eyes as I early to the temple now and God began to show him something he said I saw stood seraphim's he saw the Lord High and lifted up the tree and filled the temple buffets to the seraphim's each one had six wings with twin he covered his face between covered his feet to tweening it fly I won crichton's another I said holy holy Lord God Almighty the law is a lot of hosts the whole earth is full of that glory and the post of the door was moved by the voice of him that cried and the house was filled with smoke then said I war is me I'm undone because I am a man of unclean lips now this is important because he's a prophet he speaks a god but then in this presence there's a behavior that came upon his life death upon him a vision broke upon him and a transforming porch again completely and then he says now watch boys me from undone a man of unclean lips and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips for my eyes have seen the king the Lord of hosts then flew one of the seraphim's unto me having a life : is on which are taken with the tongue some of the altar Wow leave it upon my mount and said lo this had touched her lips the iniquity is taken away by sin purged I heard the voice of the Lord saying whom shall I send who will go for us then I said I here am I send me unlisted border Branham he said a prophet had been leading upon the kingdom and when he followed that something taken place no matter how much a man it has been blessed yet when go when he steps across that boundary line between error and truth God calls his hand then I saw I went to the temple fell on his knees no doubt yes he said he felt on their bloody all turning in the crowd and as he cried God came in a vision and he saw the angels he said I saw God lifted up God was lifted to a place that man cannot come then he become influenced in another way he saw God lifted up highway up his trainee look and the pillars began to move in the shape of the voice he never saw that Isaiah he saw what a modern man can feel oh yes I saw he saw that a mortal man can feel for no matter how much is bliss and that is why a shame for ministers to deceive the people by putting everything upon the people about them that has got to be them that's a shame because a man because how blessings can fall ten percent say you know you do believe that but I what I just said I didn't say the Prophet said it I read it again in case you really understand what I seen he saw that mortal man can fall no matter how much he is blessed he can still fall one so then he get a look at one that can fall whose foundations are sure the vision of the temple so God lifted up go be lifted up isn't that right he said no watch Isaiah seen that the king soon as he got out of his calling God smote him with leprosy then I thought what must I do whose ayah was dead he had leaned heavy on his arm he thought he was gone what would he do life itself was gone from him nearly so what did the young prophet do he made his way down to the temple and pray he fell longer the old and he cried out sometimes God let the very props be not from under us sometimes he lets sickness strike us he let sickness Stryker's he lets disappointments Haddix strike us be sorry a minute later be a trauma devil we talk about God he so he using endeavor to accomplish his purpose

perfection is patience waitin on God and waitin for God this is the process of character development oh praise the name of the Lord notice when the fiery trial come on and every man ever witness for God will have to go to fiery trials isn't it strange how God leads his people very strange as soon as Jesus was baptized he went in a witness to be telling the devil as soon as Israel came out under

she was runs a fiery furnace and the winner here test somebody who you make on his ease this is your tough and everything else give me a testimony just a bit God give me the gift to handle it I couldn't fight them just fighting for my life fighting to overcome I want to chop my foot on the Devas neck yeah possess the case of the enemy I'm a royal seed of Abraham I am one of them I'm identified with David which Samson what just died but he was afraid I might defy what Hebrews 11 [Applause] you may be seated what about a woman a baby drop dead 12 years old the boy that drop dead she showed me a chariot on Saturday right actually Raylan I'm the first gossip and confusion sister see your item so hard see all as well she bought one as well so here is the fast ball Aslam there's a reason why she riding so fast she have a dead son of soo bahk - you don't want you to know what's going on she went Elijah lashes a man of God I just couldn't do it Oh hallelujah try was read from the dead and got gonna have some men are good men gonna be feeling good men will become the Temple of the Living God but we won't identify a little process will you become a vessel of Honor if any man would himself there's a Persian as a cleansing these are purifying as a refining that has the comfort prophet called honing honing Oh glory to God hallelujah let me go in deeper now to become temples of the Living God God was there to meet us and that's what an ass is a fire it didn't understand they taught that with the same we're a pizza that was a semo's but that was a different man why I was upon that throne God wasn't tough that wrong listen my god hallelujah and the promising will repeat again let me qualify you know okay my very finest fire unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him you have to suffer terrain the reason for this is character simply is never made without suffering character is a give it to another gift that's why blessings have become Chris I think somebody England yet acting like some girl she will need luck to eat 17 and she want to shoot him and say they shouldn't allow anybody to win it on 8:17 because I'm her life has been messed up by all this money was too much of money and she did all this to herself she by how's this no she's broke she messed up she have no life she's frustrated she said she never said I wanted to begin with she's suing them most of them might win this lottery must blow it out in two years Daniel they don't know how to make it it hit them under the blue it character is a victory not a gift and character is simply never made without suffering so all of you who don't want suffering I don't wanna pain and yeah you know I mean it sporting a chair and you spoiling your wife you spoil your husband is what everybody could spoil all I could tell you is a gonna spoil children so you really spoiled him but when go ahead to be with you he not spoiling you he will coach you the process like Noah like Moses like Abraham he never spoils none of them he's tricked them all he correct them Jacob every one of them you know their sons too but all of them came to the grinder and they came out right don't give up everybody don't write anybody off when that vessel was mad in the Potters hand he repurposed it he reset it here we channeled it he can uh try the where he's gonna dump it but he choose to holy oh boy get a place inside of here [Applause] character is a victory not a gift a man without character cannot read because power apart from karate satanic but power character is fit to rule and since he want to share his throne on the same basis he overcame and sat down that is Farah strong then we have to overcome to sit with him and a little temporary suffering we go to now is not worthy to be compared to the tremendous glory that will be revealed in us when he comes what treasure is later for those who are willing to enter in his in them and just end up with much tribulation will give him a shout hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah take it not strange concerning the fiery trials that is a trial what God wants us develop is a christ-like character that comes to suffering he said we all have trials we have all have tried and chasing our sons but not one goes true that the church that is not suffering is not being tried the church that is not suffering and is not being tried isn't of God I think I've seen it again the church that is not suffering and is not being tried isn't of God for whom the Lord loveth he whose 12-6 each easement and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth if you're an ultra easement where all are partakers then your buses are not sons there is no special condition in Smyrna this special division Smyrna must be applied to every age there is no age free from it there is no true believer free from it this is of God this is the will of God it is needful we need the Lord to teach us the truth that we are to suffer and the Christ I can do in it when you on the phone gossiping on telling people what we're going through how we're going to our waiter weren't you that is not suffering like rice that is you looking for sympathizers and you're part of worry in your pity party I said the world's drink they have a bunch of friends who use him thing to all I'm talkin easy little talk no you don't want that amen so watch this is the will of God is needful we need a lot of teachers the truth that we had to suffer and the Christ I can doing it love suffereth long and is kind the cloudy skies and storms of life and no signs of God's disapproval the coatings are wrong and things didn't work out I got visit you and you feel that if oxygen and you really repent and repent repent and repented like if you try to work God up God forgive me Lord you want to repent they didn't do he said a script backup things and he pass if he's gonna forgive you Adam - and they keep going back because you think God angry with you and crank up pieces and regard but he's teaching us something here the cloudy skies and storms of life and no signs of God's approval neither are the bright skies and still waters signs of his love and approval his approval of any of us already is in the beloved his love is elective which he has for us before the foundation of the world how does he love us yes how shall we know because he said so I'm manifest that he did love us for he brought us to himself and gave us of his spirit placeless a sons how can I prove my love to him by believing what he said and by conducting myself with joy amidst the trials that he in his wisdom allow to come to pass Amen that's 30% how do we show that we love him how do we prove his love for him by believing what he said and by conducting myself with joy amidst the trials he in his wisdom allowed to come to pass Oh glory to God hallelujah praise God I'm gonna skip down these things here Oh mine last time I preached talk about the potter's house the would have came to Jeremiah go down to the potter's house and I was sure cause you to hear my words I went on to the potter's house and behold you wrote a book on the wheels and the vessel that he made the clay was mad in the hand of the Potter so he made it again another vessel and I seemed good to the Potter to make it then the Whizzer Lord came to me saying also Israel can I do it with you as this but see the Lord behold as the clay is in the Pattersons so ye in my hand award you'll notice was in charge the Potter is all you'll notice his interior is connecting with the clay itself he's not leaving the clay on his own he is moving it he is shaping it he's feeling it then any stones in it to take it out oh yes oh yes he's channeling it for vessel of use a vessel of Honor I've answered that he can use because you have to make the vessels that he can use a vessel of Honor that God can use Oh hallelujah that was the Potter that was a claim no devil in there it's the Potter and the clay and the shipment there was no lucifer my oppressive missile yeah because you want to ship your soul then naughty devil this is the Potter and the clay I want to read another scripture this comes in John 15 I am the vine to vine my father is the husbandman every branch in me that beareth NOT fruit he taketh away cut it off no watch whatever the problem is that if we call it problem they use it as problem every branch that bears fruit he pushes it so he's not interested in a non fruit branch he's interested in branch of producing fruit and what is he fault he's a PUD now you may take fruit fruit who was a bird the object behind that more fruit again no devil there you're clean to the word I've spoken to you abide in me and I in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can ye except ye abide in me I am the vine ye are the branches he said the Badger than me and him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me you can do nothing if a man abide not in me is cast onto the branch his withered men covered him customer the fire there burn if he abandoned me my words abide in you you shall ask what you will shall be done unto you here is my father glorified that he shall bear much fruit so shall you be my disciples again this whatever there if he abide in me my words abide in you ask what you will so you in charge to ask whatever you will because you are Biden in him you're arrested in him you understand a revelation as you are a branch of God connected to the vine and the life of the flame is true and true you put yours in the fruit that God needs goodies in the food that God wants so you become a channel of God I am of God a festive I've got a pool of God use of God devvra's oh the picture you've coming into God's wisdom now you're coming to the gods maturity now you're coming into a different level altogether where your whole walk becomes God inspired God directed let's government to refinance fire now who may abide in the day of his coming who shall stand when he appeared for he's like a refiners fire and like a full of soup understand the full of soup is some kind of lies I'm kind of soaked in mid and didn't clean
