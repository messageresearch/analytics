[1:11:03] incredible
[1:11:05] meeting we when brother sigmon asked me
[1:11:08] a couple of years
[1:11:11] ago we were sitting in a dining
[1:11:15] hall in
[1:11:18] swiland and we were basically setting
[1:11:20] knee to
[1:11:22] knee
[1:11:25] when that took place and he shared with
[1:11:27] me his vision for this
[1:11:31] meeting brother sigon is filled with
[1:11:35] love and we are taught by the prophet of
[1:11:38] the
[1:11:39] Lord that love conquers
[1:11:44] all we must remember that we're going to
[1:11:48] wind up

[1:11:57] hallelujah we're a
[1:12:00] family we're not enemies we're
[1:12:03] family and being family we're brothers
[1:12:05] and
[1:12:06] sisters sure there will be skirmishes in
[1:12:09] the
[1:12:11] backyard
[1:12:13] sure but in the front yard We Fight
[1:12:20] Together I thank you for coming
[1:12:24] I realize that you like myself came
[1:12:27] under some
[1:12:33] strain and probably we'll go home under
[1:12:35] some
[1:12:39] strain but we will all have a
[1:12:42] testimony that we met
[1:12:47] Jesus if you haven't met Jesus here this
[1:12:49] week you've missed the
[1:12:52] picture
[1:12:54] last night to me was one of the greatest
[1:12:57] meetings I've ever set
[1:13:02] in I was overwhelmed by the
[1:13:07] atmosphere I I actually put my hand on
[1:13:09] my far and said this just can't
[1:13:12] [Music]
[1:13:15] stop and so we thank the Lord that it
[1:13:20] didn't amen
[1:13:22] amen amen this morning was out of this
[1:13:27] world I witnessed I witnessed this man
[1:13:31] come on
[1:13:39] the when brother sigon asked me two
[1:13:42] years
[1:13:43] ago I felt the witness of the Lord to
[1:13:49] come I just felt him come in my heart
[1:13:52] and say that's the thing to do
[1:13:57] the footsteps of the righteous are
[1:13:59] ordered of the
[1:14:01] lord we did not know two years
[1:14:05] ago of where we would be
[1:14:09] today for
[1:14:11] myself I left home
[1:14:14] and my father-in-law which is the
[1:14:16] founder of the
[1:14:19] church is it could pass away any day
[1:14:25] they have they have placed him in a
[1:14:27] comfort
[1:14:30] care he's been more than just a
[1:14:34] buddy or a senior
[1:14:37] pastor but he's been a second Daddy to
[1:14:41] me when I kissed him on the head the
[1:14:43] other night I did not
[1:14:47] know but I trusted
[1:14:49] God that God would keep him during this
[1:14:52] time
[1:14:56] my
[1:14:57] wife as many of you
[1:15:00] know which would be his
[1:15:02] daughter her lungs is filled with
[1:15:07] tumors and literally hundreds and even
[1:15:10] into the thousands of
[1:15:14] tumors they're not
[1:15:17] malignant but they drain very much of
[1:15:20] the energy away from her
[1:15:24] now all of that strain going on in the
[1:15:28] home there are a lot of people that told
[1:15:30] me I shouldn't be
[1:15:33] here but two years ago God spoke to me
[1:15:37] and told me to be
[1:15:46] here so if he spoke to me two years ago
[1:15:49] to be
[1:15:52] here he made a promise brother
[1:15:55] Kelly that he would be
[1:15:59] here hallelujah
[1:16:01] hallelujah so I would like to thank each
[1:16:04] and every one of you and I know you left
[1:16:06] home with a
[1:16:11] strain but I pray that God would richly
[1:16:14] richly reward
[1:16:19] you

[1:23:53] amen you may be
[1:24:02] seated we have each as a ministers
[1:24:08] cordially and rightfully so have thanked
[1:24:11] brother colen
[1:24:13] brener for his incredible
[1:24:18] hospitality and his overwhelming love
[1:24:20] for every one of us set in
[1:24:25] but we must
[1:24:27] understand that a greater than brother
[1:24:29] colen
[1:24:31] brener called this meeting before the
[1:24:33] foundation of the
[1:24:36] world he called a conference with his
[1:24:41] children we are the predestinated seed
[1:24:44] of
[1:24:45] God that God had on his mind before the
[1:24:49] foundation of the
[1:24:50] world and he knew what corner of the
[1:24:54] earth that we would be
[1:24:57] in he knew exactly where we would
[1:25:01] be and the god that placed something on
[1:25:04] the inside of your heart Gather in this
[1:25:10] meeting that's the
[1:25:12] god that's the god that designed this
[1:25:18] meeting it's more than a
[1:25:20] man I would like to say that's more than
[1:25:24] a
[1:25:26] Revival more than a
[1:25:29] convention this meeting has not been the
[1:25:32] competition of
[1:25:36] preachers we're not here to outdo one
[1:25:40] another we are each putting our shoulder
[1:25:43] against the
[1:25:47] will to advance the kingdom of
[1:25:51] God we are finishing this
[1:25:55] battle and I would say to you we will
[1:25:59] finish it
[1:26:04] strong because this voice is not the
[1:26:07] voice of a
[1:26:09] weekend this is the voice of the mighty
[1:26:13] angel that has come to this
[1:26:17] generation it is the voice of the
[1:26:20] Archangel echoing through the
[1:26:22] Jesus
[1:26:28] Christ this is the Lord's
[1:26:34] doing amen
[1:26:37] amen
[1:26:39] amen in our territory at
[1:26:43] home there was a man named stone wall
[1:26:47] Jackson stonewalls you may have heard of
[1:26:50] him brother ROM Compares him unto
[1:26:55] Joshua he taught in a military school
[1:26:58] just near my
[1:27:01] house he actually was born right where
[1:27:04] right near where I was
[1:27:07] live Stonewall Jackson studied every
[1:27:11] battle of Joshua
[1:27:14] stonewalls and he believed in God
[1:27:16] Watching Over the predestinated
[1:27:21] Sea he was of that dispensation of age
[1:27:25] of
[1:27:27] predestinated maybe not understanding it
[1:27:29] quite like you and
[1:27:32] I under the revelation of the
[1:27:34] word but he believed that if God was
[1:27:38] watching over that
[1:27:41] seed there was nothing that that could
[1:27:44] destroy
[1:27:45] it until God's purpose was
[1:27:49] done he was nicknamed The
[1:27:54] Stonewall stew because in a Manasses
[1:28:00] battle he stood in the middle of an open
[1:28:05] field sat on his on his
[1:28:08] horse there was bullets flying in every
[1:28:13] direction and his men his men looked at
[1:28:16] him and called him he stands like a
[1:28:17] stone
[1:28:21] wall
[1:28:23] he was later to declare unto his
[1:28:26] men I am a safe on the
[1:28:32] battlefield as I am at home on my
[1:28:38] pillow if we could realize this
[1:28:42] tonight that the devil cannot touch a
[1:28:45] hair of our
[1:28:48] head until he gets permission from our
[1:28:51] God
[1:28:53] and before that he can touch a hair of
[1:28:55] our
[1:28:57] head before you go through a
[1:29:01] trial God has has committed
[1:29:08] confidence in
[1:29:10] you that you can make it through your
[1:29:19] trial I would not know the dark of your
[1:29:22] trial even
[1:29:25] tonight
[1:29:27] does and the god that knows exactly
[1:29:30] where you're
[1:29:33] at he knew where Lazarus was
[1:29:37] at he knew where the woman at the well
[1:29:40] was
[1:29:41] at he knew where Legion was
[1:29:47] at he knew where Georgia Carter was
[1:29:50] at
[1:29:54] exactly he knew where you
[1:29:59] was and God is
[1:30:03] determined he's determined to get
[1:30:06] his and he says I will not lose a
[1:30:16] one I wanted to share with a portion of
[1:30:19] a
[1:30:20] quote he said there isn't enough power
[1:30:24] in all
[1:30:26] hell that can ever defeat the purpose of
[1:30:34] God listen there's been a lot of great
[1:30:36] preaching
[1:30:38] here and I'm sure the devil is scared of
[1:30:41] this meeting just
[1:30:43] now but while he's on the run I want to
[1:30:46] scream
[1:30:48] man there isn't enough power in all hell
[1:30:54] that can ever defeat the purpose of
[1:31:00] God and if this meeting was God's
[1:31:05] purpose nothing that can
[1:31:12] defeat hallelujah
[1:31:14] hallelujah is it good I'll share just a
[1:31:18] just a quotation with
[1:31:20] you remember one time a
[1:31:24] story of a little cotney in
[1:31:28] England he was just an ordinary
[1:31:32] man and they said that the
[1:31:34] king one of the kings in the early
[1:31:37] days was going into his
[1:31:41] Palace and he had a message to that he
[1:31:44] had to get
[1:31:46] forth an Urgent Message because of the
[1:31:50] enemy and he said to this little fell
[1:31:53] standing
[1:31:55] there he said here take this
[1:31:59] message take this message to a certain
[1:32:02] place and command this to be
[1:32:06] done and he said take my scepter in your
[1:32:11] hand that'll vindicate
[1:32:14] you notice what he said take my seer in
[1:32:18] your hands that'll vindicate you
[1:32:23] that you're sent from
[1:32:27] me and he stuck it under his
[1:32:30] Roe and way he went the guards were
[1:32:34] everywhere trying to stop
[1:32:36] him get
[1:32:38] away get away I have that message of the
[1:32:42] king I'm the king's
[1:32:45] messenger a Vindicated
[1:32:48] word I
[1:32:50] thought and get out of my
[1:32:53] way I have the king's
[1:32:55] message I must
[1:33:00] go one time when they killed the Prince
[1:33:03] of
[1:33:04] Peace and put him in a grave and sealed
[1:33:07] up the T and death held him for three
[1:33:10] days and night but on Easter
[1:33:14] morning he had a scepter in his hand and
[1:33:18] he said get away
[1:33:20] D get away

[1:33:30] message I must come forth to prove this
[1:33:36] Resurrection I am the resurrection and
[1:33:39] the
[1:33:41] life I pray this
[1:33:44] week that this declaration is in your
[1:33:48] heart that you can realize
[1:33:53] that you are the king's
[1:34:02] message you're God's crowning
[1:34:07] achievement you are that Invincible

[1:35:07] Baptist message wasn't to the
[1:35:10] Methodist this message wasn't to the
[1:35:13] denomination was the
[1:35:16] bright her to
[1:35:20] come and we have a message from the
[1:35:28] K do you believe

[1:35:45] Jesus hallelujah
[1:35:50] hallelujah
[1:36:11] we can declare tonight that we're in a
[1:36:13] very special
[1:36:15] place amen we're in a
[1:36:19] conference with more than a man
[1:36:27] [Applause]
[1:36:30] the same God that's Among
[1:36:33] Us stood
[1:36:35] here and we had the greatest Vindicated
[1:36:40] Prophet other than the Lord Jesus
[1:36:44] Christ we've had personal eyewitnesses
[1:36:46] through the
[1:36:49] week but our God didn't
[1:36:55] die behold I send
[1:36:58] you Elijah the
[1:37:01] prophet there was three in
[1:37:04] there God Elijah and
[1:37:11] you some of you have gray hair no hair
[1:37:15] some of your young
[1:37:17] children each in its own
[1:37:22] came to the recognization of who you
[1:37:25] are and became aware that this is
[1:37:31] your as morah would
[1:37:35] say this is your
[1:37:39] time this is your
[1:37:42] moment more than just to recognize
[1:37:46] it recognizing and doing nothing is not
[1:37:50] what this is about but you must
[1:37:55] recognize
[1:37:58] [Applause]
[1:38:04] it so this is as brother bisco would use
[1:38:07] the
[1:38:08] term the
[1:38:13] place I was literally amazed as I heard
[1:38:16] the message last
[1:38:20] night
[1:38:22] I showed brother Tim PR the text that I
[1:38:24] would read
[1:38:29] tonight of what my text was that he
[1:38:33] would meet us in a large
[1:38:36] [Music]
[1:38:39] place and this is the Lord's
[1:38:43] doing if we're not careful we'll miss
[1:38:46] the
[1:38:49] moment I I I apolog oliz to you but I I
[1:38:52] want to just drop this to
[1:38:54] you you must have an appreciation of
[1:38:57] this
[1:39:02] moment if God designed this
[1:39:07] meeting
[1:39:09] together this is God at
[1:39:13] work not a man at
[1:39:16] work man makes a mess out of
[1:39:20] things pollutes
[1:39:23] things man pollutes
[1:39:26] things this is God that is at
[1:39:30] work and if you was looking at a work of
[1:39:35] Shakespeare you must realize he's not a
[1:39:37] normal
[1:39:40] writer he is the master of
[1:39:43] Master if you're listening to
[1:39:45] Beethoven's
[1:39:48] Orchestra it's not some average orchest
[1:39:53] writing he's a he's a he's a gift that's
[1:39:57] beyond
[1:40:00] extraordinary he is a master
[1:40:03] writer and and people that have an
[1:40:06] appreciation or brother brand would use
[1:40:08] the term
[1:40:09] interest interest in
[1:40:12] it you must have an interest in
[1:40:16] it to have an appreciation for
[1:40:19] it are you with me now said his word is
[1:40:24] like a
[1:40:26] symphony he said to those who are not
[1:40:28] interested in
[1:40:30] it it sounds like a bunch of Racket to
[1:40:35] them maybe to the
[1:40:37] world this looks like a bunch of
[1:40:41] ret but to those of us that are
[1:40:45] aware this is God
[1:40:49] Gathering his children
[1:40:53] [Applause]
[1:41:04] so this is more than a
[1:41:07] facility this is a beautiful
[1:41:10] facility it's a has incredible
[1:41:15] equipment it is so well put
[1:41:18] together you could have a you you could
[1:41:21] have a rock music
[1:41:23] here you could have an orchestra
[1:41:26] here you could have a motivational
[1:41:28] speeches
[1:41:31] here great corporations could come here
[1:41:34] for a week
[1:41:36] off but God chose to gather his
[1:41:42] children from all Realms of the
[1:41:46] earth and divinely Inspire his musicians
[1:41:52] his voice is on the
[1:41:54] earth to speak to the Bride of Jesus
[1:41:58] Christ and to declare unto
[1:42:01] them we're in the
[1:42:05] [Applause]
[1:42:08] vision and this vision is God's
[1:42:14] Vision you say well brother Ron you're
[1:42:16] stretching you might be stretching just
[1:42:18] a
[1:42:19] bit hope I'm following the same boss
[1:42:22] that you
[1:42:26] are Luke chap 9 and verse
[1:42:29] 27 and Jesus is speaking like this is it
[1:42:33] all right if I go
[1:42:35] on but I tell you of a
[1:42:39] truth that there be some standing
[1:42:43] here which shall not taste of
[1:42:46] death till they see the kingdom of
[1:42:49] God
[1:42:51] there were men that was standing
[1:42:53] there that would miss this
[1:42:56] event they was precious people as a
[1:43:00] matter of fact we would call them Inner
[1:43:01] Circle
[1:43:05] people and some sometimes we're actually
[1:43:08] set in a
[1:43:10] service and one feels like they they've
[1:43:13] been in the greatest service in their
[1:43:18] life and another didn't get anything
[1:43:22] it is simple they was not plugged
[1:43:25] in they was not tapped into the
[1:43:29] source not aware of the moving of the
[1:43:33] holy
[1:43:34] spirit because God is in every
[1:43:38] service if we could only become aware of
[1:43:42] what he is
[1:43:45] doing are you with me
[1:43:47] now and it came to pass about 8 days
[1:43:50] after these
[1:43:53] sayings notice he links the scripture
[1:43:59] together after these
[1:44:01] sayings he took Peter and John and James
[1:44:06] and went into a mountain to
[1:44:12] pray and as he
[1:44:14] prayed the fashion of his countenance
[1:44:16] was
[1:44:18] altered and his reignment was white and
[1:44:22] listening and
[1:44:24] behold their talk with him two
[1:44:29] men which were notice how positive he is
[1:44:33] when he writes
[1:44:36] it Moses and
[1:44:39] elas Hallelujah who appeared in
[1:44:43] glory of
[1:44:46] his which he should accomplish at
[1:44:49] Jerusalem
[1:44:51] you're talking about a service to be
[1:44:54] in you have visibly
[1:44:57] watched water turned to
[1:45:01] Wine you've watched Lazarus come out of
[1:45:03] a
[1:45:05] tomb you've watched the change of the
[1:45:08] woman at
[1:45:10] well you've watched him step his foot on
[1:45:13] the brow of a
[1:45:19] boat
[1:45:21] and then declare never a man speak like
[1:45:24] this
[1:45:24] [Applause]
[1:45:25] man this was more than a
[1:45:29] prophet they recognize this is more than
[1:45:31] another
[1:45:32] teach is more than another
[1:45:36] man Jesus turns to his own disciples say
[1:45:40] who the men say that I the son of
[1:45:43] man and some of them said
[1:45:46] well some
[1:45:48] say listen you do not need a secondhand
[1:45:53] Revelation you must have this for
[1:45:58] yourself this is an individual
[1:46:01] Rapture individual around the
[1:46:05] world be taken two in the field want to
[1:46:08] be taken two at the meal want to be
[1:46:12] taken I'm not waiting on my
[1:46:15] wife I'm not waiting on my
[1:46:17] neighbor I'm not making excuses for El
[1:46:21] this is
[1:46:23] mine this is eternal
[1:46:27] matter
[1:46:30] have I must have this
[1:46:33] Revelation I must have this
[1:46:42] life I would declare this to you that
[1:46:45] this is more
[1:46:47] important than the oxygen in your lungs
[1:46:49] right now
[1:46:53] is this
[1:46:54] working this is more important than the
[1:46:57] oxygen in your
[1:47:02] lungs because there will come a day that
[1:47:05] there will be no oxygen in your lung
[1:47:07] that has been predestinated sin that has
[1:47:10] been predestinated to eternal life and
[1:47:13] when there's no life in this
[1:47:16] mortality we step from this realm
[1:47:22] so it's more
[1:47:37] important brother Bram said you you let
[1:47:39] your
[1:47:40] job you let your children your
[1:47:45] family take it out of
[1:47:49] you I just want to just stop here just
[1:47:52] for a moment don't let nothing get
[1:47:55] between you and this
[1:48:00] [Music]
[1:48:05] word I heard I've heard it over and over
[1:48:08] again you need to have a
[1:48:11] relationship with this
[1:48:14] message I was raised in it from a
[1:48:19] baby but that don't make you
[1:48:22] converted I had heard it for years and
[1:48:24] years years years but one day I met the
[1:48:28] voice that's behind the
[1:48:33] voice are you with me and I became
[1:48:37] consumed with eating the
[1:48:40] book I am consumed with staying in this
[1:48:44] word I am consumed with these
[1:48:48] seven I am consumed
[1:48:51] [Music]
[1:48:53] are you with
[1:48:54] me are you with me now you can be
[1:48:58] consumed with the events of life there's
[1:49:01] no Rapture in the events of
[1:49:04] life but this word has power to
[1:49:10] transform your
[1:49:19] body
[1:49:22] it's not just for you it's for your
[1:49:27] neighbor I just want to say this to
[1:49:30] you these books are worth more than
[1:49:34] life these tapes are worth more than
[1:49:37] life it's an open book to you a closed
[1:49:41] book to the world an open book to the Cs
[1:49:46] the Cs were not revealed to the world
[1:49:49] they were revealed to the
[1:49:51] and we heard the thunder sound out of
[1:49:54] them and that word sounded to the Bride
[1:49:57] of
[1:49:58] Jesus and then we could recognize why
[1:50:02] we're not a
[1:50:04] denomination why we needed a
[1:50:08] token why it was the Mighty God
[1:50:11] un why it was the true
[1:50:15] Master why he could stand there and
[1:50:19] preach
[1:50:20] and not stand there
[1:50:26] presuming are you here to preach
[1:50:30] with that was more than a man standing
[1:50:33] behind the
[1:50:34] pit that was more than just a group of
[1:50:37] messages that was being delivered
[1:50:41] inport in
[1:50:43] Arkansas in
[1:50:45] Indiana in New York York in
[1:50:49] California
[1:50:51] it was more than just choosing of a
[1:50:54] bride God was making a
[1:50:59] declaration I'm choosing a wife this is
[1:51:03] how I want
[1:51:14] her with
[1:51:17] me just for a moment
[1:51:20] I know you know these things but I just
[1:51:22] want
[1:51:23] to maybe somebody's tuned
[1:51:26] in but there's never been a
[1:51:29] man that could step out from behind the
[1:51:32] pull
[1:51:34] pit and say I take every spirit in this
[1:51:38] building under my
[1:51:46] control and there will come a holy harsh
[1:51:53] brother brother bis you was involved in
[1:51:55] the
[1:51:58] interview when when even as brother
[1:52:01] Sydney and them begin to
[1:52:03] describe that even the animals came to a
[1:52:09] hush this was more than a
[1:52:12] gift this was not some charismatic
[1:52:15] gift people want to play games with
[1:52:18] gifts more than a
[1:52:21] gift this was him coming to the
[1:52:26] Earth this was the mighty Angel standing
[1:52:29] on
[1:52:33] the and calling the world to
[1:52:42] order that was more than a
[1:52:46] statement listen that was more than a
[1:52:48] statement

[1:53:12] their own
[1:53:13] Spirit but here was a man standing on
[1:53:16] the earth that was
[1:53:18] trusted this
[1:53:21] Authority that could step back when he
[1:53:24] came I every spirit in

[1:56:30] victory because it's the blood of bulls
[1:56:32] and goats I this great
[1:56:36] prophet to diminish and
[1:56:40] powerder but God would not allow the
[1:56:44] enemy to have

[1:56:53] mountain
[1:57:00] angel can you
[1:57:02] imagine now I'm going to presume for a
[1:57:05] minute forgive me

[1:57:10] bre can you
[1:57:12] imagine them trying to make a claim on
[1:57:15] this
[1:57:18] body because he's given the right to be
[1:57:20] the
[1:57:22] accuser trying to make a claim on Moses

[1:57:34] it he can't find the
[1:57:36] grave he can't find the
[1:57:41] stone he can't find the place where he's
[1:57:45] lay but now he's standing with Jesus
[1:57:55] J he's watched the Liah go in a
[1:58:00] rapt brother brandham said that

[1:58:47] justice but here stands Moses and
[1:58:55] Elijah brother
[1:58:57] George that's quite a
[1:59:02] place you could go to where that's
[1:59:05] at and see where the stones are
[1:59:08] at but it's quite a place for Jesus to
[1:59:12] be
[1:59:14] standing God comes
[1:59:17] down and he veils him
[1:59:20] he overshadows
[1:59:21] him God speaks out of

[1:59:39] pleas and here stands two
[1:59:42] Prophets The only thing that they can
[1:59:45] do is take the word of the
[1:59:50] promises of Psalms
[1:59:53] 22 my bones they stare at
[1:59:57] me take the scriptures that tell him I
[2:00:01] will not suffer my Holy One to seek
[2:00:05] corruption because the prophet of God
[2:00:07] said the word had to look at the word he
[2:00:11] said you got to look at the
[2:00:13] word Jesus had to look at the word to

[2:01:01] transgressions he was bruised from my
[2:01:05] iniquities not just those in the Old
[2:01:10] Testament but it's still an effect

[2:03:34] a group like
[2:03:36] this I wouldn't preach against it if I
[2:03:39] hadn't picked it

[2:05:34] to drop a few things
[2:05:37] here when the prophet of

[2:06:55] testimony I'd like to show you a
[2:07:02] picture mind brother Jonathan
[2:07:10] Jonathan are we there about nine years
[2:07:15] ago I had spoke at brother bis's camp
[2:07:20] at his
[2:07:21] convention it was on a Saturday evening
[2:07:24] and in that in that
[2:07:26] convention I had preached on the passion
[2:07:28] of our
[2:07:30] Revival probably about 2,000 people was
[2:07:33] Sting in
[2:07:34] the and during the midst of
[2:07:37] that in the midst of that I I made a
[2:07:40] declaration that the devil cannot touch
[2:07:42] a hair of your head until God gives him
[2:07:47] permission
[2:07:49] we do not know what's going to happen
[2:07:51] tomorrow within a matter of a few
[2:07:56] weeks I it was a Monday
[2:07:59] evening and I I came home after a
[2:08:02] funeral
[2:08:05] week to light a
[2:08:07] fire and I was using a
[2:08:11] propane probably probably a lot of you
[2:08:13] have heard the story but I want
[2:08:15] to just for a short
[2:08:17] minute
[2:08:20] and this
[2:08:21] propane exploded on
[2:08:24] me my son was there to grab me out of
[2:08:27] the
[2:08:29] fire it burned my
[2:08:32] face it burned my
[2:08:34] arm my arms burned to the
[2:08:42] bones it melted my
[2:08:44] face it burned down my
[2:08:47] throat it burned my lips it took the
[2:08:50] skin off my
[2:08:52] tongue it burned my
[2:08:56] esophagus and it destroyed
[2:08:59] 75% of my
[2:09:03] lungs I laid in a
[2:09:06] coma for almost a
[2:09:10] month a medic a medicated what they call
[2:09:13] a medicated
[2:09:16] coma to make May survive because of the
[2:09:19] trauma of
[2:09:24] it Dr
[2:09:27] Kramer who later was on an airplane with
[2:09:30] me he he confessed he said I never
[2:09:34] expected you to
[2:09:38] live I would be moved to a burn
[2:09:42] unit about
[2:09:46] an doct immediately begin to
[2:09:50] work they did not expect me to
[2:09:54] live and it went day after day after
[2:09:58] day they put life support on
[2:10:01] me that life support was running at
[2:10:08] 100% the doctors was telling my
[2:10:12] wife that there's nothing more that we
[2:10:14] can
[2:10:16] do but I was in a
[2:10:22] [Applause]
[2:10:24] place brother bll lives about 3,000
[2:10:27] miles or maybe even further that away
[2:10:29] from
[2:10:31] me you're talking about the God's order
[2:10:35] of putting the Switzerland meeting
[2:10:39] together I believe the same God that put
[2:10:42] the Switzerland meeting
[2:10:44] together meeting
[2:10:47] together
[2:10:49] God spoke to
[2:10:50] him to call my
[2:10:55] wife and he dropped it in his
[2:10:58] heart I can't tell it like he can tell
[2:11:01] it maybe he's already
[2:11:03] told but my son who saved me from the
[2:11:07] fire was burned as well and he was in
[2:11:11] another
[2:11:13] hos and I was in the burn
[2:11:16] unit and they wouldn't tell my
[2:11:19] son my
[2:11:22] condition doctors knew most likely I
[2:11:25] wouldn't
[2:11:28] live but after about a week of
[2:11:31] that God deposited in brother br's
[2:11:35] heart that they had
[2:11:37] purchased Mount Baker Bible Way
[2:11:42] Camp Baker A M Baker I want you to think
[2:11:45] about

[2:12:50] consumed and here's a voice on the other
[2:12:53] end of the
[2:12:55] line who we've got much confidence
[2:13:01] in and he's telling sister
[2:13:04] con I can't tell it like he can tell it
[2:13:08] he's telling sister Connie that brother

[2:13:16] ears that he's going to be the
[2:13:20] speaker at the camp next
[2:13:33] year I want you to put some things

[2:13:54] voice are you with me
[2:13:57] just and it anchors in her
[2:13:59] heart not just for a couple of days but

[2:14:51] buddy for a long
[2:14:52] time we've all got buddies we've all got
[2:14:55] friends I got a lot of friends
[2:14:57] here brother Kelly hilderbrand who who
[2:15:01] spoke so incredible the other
[2:15:04] morning I had a scheduled
[2:15:06] meeting with brother
[2:15:09] Kelly but God had different
[2:15:12] plans it was his annual
[2:15:14] meeting I felt like I would be there
[2:15:19] but God had another
[2:15:23] plan brother Tim PR was speaking at
[2:15:25] brother Craig
[2:15:27] boers and God impressed on his heart to
[2:15:30] go
[2:15:32] home so he made a flight home to
[2:15:36] Louisiana and he was standing in a
[2:15:40] barn standing in a barn with his
[2:15:43] son expressing his
[2:15:46] burden about his buddy laying in a
[2:15:50] coma and saying he should be out by
[2:15:54] now I'm just not getting the picture
[2:15:58] right and he drove over 20
[2:16:02] hours and a hard
[2:16:05] trip to come and
[2:16:09] speak not just to speak but to
[2:16:16] visit and he said I felt like the
[2:16:18] prayers of all the saints from around
[2:16:20] the world I felt like a priest walking
[2:16:23] into that room with that
[2:16:31] pray the first day he walks
[2:16:35] in I'm being allowed to come out of the
[2:16:39] coma I'm extremely
[2:16:42] confused might expect that to
[2:16:46] be I do not know what's happened to
[2:16:49] me and brother Tim begins to he's the
[2:16:52] one that
[2:16:53] is that they wanted to talk to me
[2:16:59] first and he begins to describe to
[2:17:02] me what has
[2:17:04] happened here's his
[2:17:06] statement I've not come to preach your
[2:17:16] funeral

[2:17:24] couldn't stay with me Al long in that
[2:17:29] condition and they would leave the
[2:17:32] room and they'd ask him to speak that
[2:17:38] weekend and he spoke a
[2:17:41] sermon and I want to describe a couple
[2:17:43] of events for
[2:17:45] you as the evening would W

[2:17:59] declare no brain wave
[2:18:04] activity and I must declare to you I
[2:18:07] felt myself slipping
[2:18:11] away and this is the very thought that I
[2:18:16] had this must be what it's like to
[2:18:22] die and I heard the nurse
[2:18:26] declare He Slipped
[2:18:33] Away this is what they would find the
[2:18:35] next

[2:24:22] Ray deal with my
[2:24:25] son neither knowed anything about what
[2:24:28] happened with
[2:24:32] Joel God would deal with my son standing

[2:24:41] moment in a very
[2:24:43] moment with people going every we away

[2:25:49] but in the Stillness of a
[2:25:52] moment God transform your
[2:25:56] life and you can go from the worst
[2:25:59] sinner in the whole
[2:26:01] world and only seconds
[2:26:04] later be a complete brand new
[2:26:08] creature old things passed
[2:26:15] away
[2:26:18] but that will produce an excitement in
[2:26:21] your
[2:26:25] life a stimulation in your
[2:26:29] life you'll become drunk on the holy
[2:26:31] ghost
[2:26:38] [Applause]
[2:26:45] from
[2:26:50] I don't have a picture of my
[2:26:55] father-in-law but my father-in-law who's
[2:26:57] laying now getting ready to go into his
[2:26:59] future
[2:27:04] home these men that are here they that
[2:27:07] know
[2:27:08] him testify to
[2:27:10] this this is a kind of
[2:27:13] man that believed this message with all
[2:27:15] of his heart
[2:27:17] he would give his life for this
[2:27:20] message the founder of the
[2:27:22] church they would they would
[2:27:26] worship and I've visibly watched
[2:27:29] him dance in the spirit for two
[2:27:34] hours dance in the spirit for two
[2:27:38] hours and then
[2:27:40] stop and preach for two
[2:27:43] hours and then Worship the Lord for two
[2:27:46] more hours
[2:27:50] [Applause]
[2:27:54] hour I don't know what charismatic
[2:27:56] Pentecost
[2:27:58] is but I know what the reality of
[2:28:03] worshiping it should be a spontaneous
[2:28:10] combustion bursting to
[2:28:13] life a response
[2:28:20] you should not be offended at
[2:28:30] that people can go to go to a ball game
[2:28:33] and get
[2:28:36] excited the devil will not hinder you
[2:28:39] none
[2:28:41] there you can go to a rock
[2:28:44] concert excited the devil will not
[2:28:47] hinder you
[2:28:49] n but when you come to
[2:28:52] church the devil will climb on your
[2:28:55] shoulder and try to make you
[2:29:00] ashamed because something is moving on
[2:29:02] the
[2:29:04] inside it should be more than your
[2:29:06] favorite
[2:29:08] preacher it should be a word
[2:29:12] response
[2:29:15] soul
[2:29:23] [Applause]
[2:29:31] I watch I watched the young man stand
[2:29:34] last night with
[2:29:38] leukemia I stood in a meeting like last
[2:29:43] night I want to stop and caution you
[2:29:45] just now
[2:29:49] maybe in your carnal
[2:29:53] flesh maybe you looked at your
[2:29:58] watch that was a bit
[2:30:01] long maybe you're thinking that right
[2:30:08] now but sometimes we sit in our pews and
[2:30:11] Miss what's going
[2:30:15] on
[2:30:21] I'm not lifting up a man
[2:30:23] now caution your thoughts on
[2:30:27] that brother bisc was preaching on a new
[2:30:31] creation in North
[2:30:34] Carolina standing at a convention with
[2:30:36] about a thousand
[2:30:38] people and I was sitting in the right
[2:30:42] balcony with my scarred
[2:30:45] lungs

[2:30:49] realm of where those lights would
[2:30:54] be and I was sitting with my
[2:30:56] father-in-law my mother-in-law my
[2:31:00] wife and he was speaking about one cell
[2:31:04] being
[2:31:05] bruised and then it begins to scar many
[2:31:08] others becomes
[2:31:12] cancer but the spoken word of
[2:31:15] God
[2:31:17] can bring not just
[2:31:20] restoration but
[2:31:24] Recreation I was setting in that
[2:31:28] position and I said tonight's my
[2:31:32] night I stood to my

[2:40:55] two
[2:40:58] strokes one stroke I one stroke I laid
[2:41:01] there eight
[2:41:04] days and I couldn't stand the light to
[2:41:06] be on in the
[2:41:09] room a light drove me literally
[2:41:14] nuts
[2:41:16] on the eighth
[2:41:18] day I was in prayer in the middle of the
[2:41:22] night and what brother George just sung
[2:41:24] just a few moments
[2:41:26] ago Jesus
[2:41:32] came the nurse walked
[2:41:34] in she had a she had a little
[2:41:38] flashlight and she was going to check my
[2:41:43] vitals and she had was the first time on
[2:41:46] duty with
[2:41:48] me now I'm
[2:41:52] finishing and she says Mr Spencer are
[2:41:54] you
[2:41:57] awake yes
[2:41:59] ma'am she said Mr Spencer was you
[2:42:03] praying I said yes ma'am she said I I've
[2:42:07] heard from the other nurses of who you
[2:42:13] are and she said I've always wanted to
[2:42:16] be a Christian all my
[2:42:19] life and she said when I open the
[2:42:23] door I felt the presence I've never felt
[2:42:26] in my
[2:42:38] life I let her to Jesus
[2:42:42] Christ and from that moment on
[2:42:46] every symptom of that stroke
[2:42:51] left God is
[2:43:03] determined will you give me one more
[2:43:09] minute God laid it on brother colen

[2:43:18] cost this this came at great
[2:43:22] strength his family his
[2:43:25] church put phenomenal effort into
[2:43:29] this but it was
[2:43:34] God that directed this
[2:43:37] meeting it was God that has directed
[2:43:41] these
[2:43:44] services
[2:43:46] I would say we should become
[2:43:51] aware we're in the
[2:44:02] moment we're in the
[2:44:05] moment and it's bigger than a
[2:44:12] man I'm not here to entertain you
[2:44:16] I left a family under great
[2:44:19] duress because I felt absolutely
[2:44:22] directed
[2:44:23] God be in this
[2:44:26] meeting to stand in this
[2:44:29] moment and to tell you this is God's
[2:44:42] doing and to the one that might question
[2:44:44] you
[2:44:46] and to one that might criticize you I
