[9:34] Glory to God.
[9:37] Just
[9:38] as I
[9:41] am
[9:42] without one
[9:46] plea, but that thy
[9:50] blood was
[9:52] shed for
[9:55] me and that thou bit me.
[10:02] Come to
[10:04] thee, oh
[10:07] lamb of
[10:09] God. I
[10:12] come.
[10:14] I
[10:19] come. Just
[10:21] as I am.
[10:25] Oh, thou wilt
[10:29] receive
[10:31] will
[10:33] come and
[10:36] cleanse
[10:38] relief
[10:40] because thy
[10:44] promise I
[10:48] believe.
[10:50] Hol of
[10:53] God I
[10:55] [Music]
[10:58] come. I
[11:00] [Music]
[11:01] come. Amen. Amen. And amen. God bless
[11:04] you Anthony. Just as I am without one
[11:07] plea, but that thy blood was shed for me
[11:11] and thou bits may come today. Oh lamb of
[11:13] God, I come. Let's bow our heads
[11:15] tonight. Heavenly Father, we thank you
[11:17] for your blood and this great
[11:19] opportunity that we could access your
[11:21] throne of grace. It was debt to go in
[11:25] that holy place in the Old Testament,
[11:27] that most holy place was debt, Lord. Now
[11:30] is debt to be outside of that place.
[11:32] God, take us in tonight and cover us
[11:34] with your blood. Cover us with your
[11:36] presence. May we get a revelation, a
[11:38] true revelation of our perfect standing
[11:40] through the blood where we are justified
[11:42] in your sight. uh have access by prayer
[11:45] and through prayer to all redemptive
[11:48] blessings. Have your way tonight. Speak
[11:51] to us by your word. Store our spirits,
[11:53] store our hearts tonight in Jesus name I
[11:55] ask it. Amen and amen. God bless you and
[11:58] welcome. Thanks for being here tonight.
[12:00] And if you have your Bibles, I'd like to
[12:01] read one portion of scripture from
[12:03] Isaiah chapter
[12:04] 1
[12:06] 14-20. of
[12:08] Isaiah chapter
[12:11] 1
[12:13] and it reads thus. Your new moons, your
[12:18] appointed feast, my soul
[12:20] hat, they are trouble unto me. I am
[12:24] weary to bear them. And when you spread
[12:27] forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes
[12:30] from you. Ye, when you make many
[12:33] prayers, I will not hear. Your hands are
[12:37] full of
[12:39] blood. Wash
[12:41] you, make you
[12:43] clean, put away the evil of your doings
[12:47] from before mine eyes. Cease to do
[12:51] evil. Learn to do well. Seek judgment.
[12:57] Relieve the oppressed. Judge the
[13:00] fatherless, plead for the widow. Come
[13:04] now and let us reason together, sayeth
[13:07] the Lord. Though your sins be as
[13:10] scarlet, they shall be as white as snow.
[13:14] Though they be red like crimson, they
[13:16] shall be as wool. If ye be willing and
[13:22] obedient, he shall eat the good of the
[13:24] land. But if he refuse and rebel, he
[13:29] shall be devoured with the sword. For
[13:31] the mouth of the Lord had spoken it. May
[13:34] God bless his
[13:37] word. It's interesting that the Old
[13:40] Testament gives a view of God in his
[13:45] element, in his intent, in his
[13:49] desire, in his purpose.
[13:52] this
[13:53] scripture come now that let us reason
[13:56] together use this
[13:59] uh to identify a conference with God.
[14:02] And tonight I have a title of a thought
[14:05] to share with you the rights to have a
[14:10] conference with God.
[14:13] Now some time back I challenge you on
[14:16] the word to believe the power of the
[14:19] word to believe the word for what it is
[14:23] because the word is is God. This
[14:27] omnipotent being omniscient all powerful
[14:31] condemn condens himself into the word.
[14:36] All you think about there's no errors
[14:38] there's no mistake. There's no uh he
[14:41] can't write he can't speak he could
[14:44] speak he could write he know exactly
[14:46] what is in this book where every comma
[14:49] is where every full stop and when he
[14:51] says come let us reason together though
[14:54] your sins be as scarlet they shall be
[14:57] white as wool he means that we have to
[15:01] believe that just what he says what he
[15:03] means you know we because of emotions
[15:07] feelings And these five senses that
[15:10] contact the natural realm, we could feel
[15:13] this way about our children, whether
[15:14] they good, bad, or indifferent. But when
[15:17] God spoke in the Garden of Eden and
[15:20] said, "The day you eat, that day you
[15:21] die." Talking to Adam. Now, Eve wasn't
[15:24] around yet. This is Adam getting the
[15:27] word. And he told Adam exactly what he
[15:31] wanted. And he said, "The day you eat
[15:34] thereof, that day you shall surely die."
[15:36] God kept his word and this is God's
[15:40] ability. This is what make God God. He
[15:42] has the ability to keep his word.
[15:47] Whether of blessings or of curses,
[15:50] whether of blessings or of judgment, he
[15:52] keeps his word. And that's why there's a
[15:55] caveat right there. The ending of the
[15:57] scripture we read, if you are willing,
[16:00] if you are willing, you will eat of the
[16:02] good of the land. If you rebel, of
[16:04] course, the sword will get you. So, it's
[16:07] clean. It's clear. God wants obedience.
[16:12] God wants our surrender. And he wants to
[16:16] negotiate because he wants to give
[16:18] everyone a fair
[16:20] chance. He's not talking about what
[16:22] condition you're in. He's talking about
[16:24] having a conference that we could
[16:27] discuss and deal with the challenges
[16:30] that you are faced with. But the
[16:32] challenges that confronts you. So let me
[16:34] just share some things that the prophet
[16:36] said here. Now I want to get it tonight.
[16:39] I feel this is very important and I want
[16:41] to get across tonight. But said this
[16:44] what a conference held for? What's the
[16:46] reason for these conferences? There's
[16:48] got to be a reason and they got to come
[16:51] to a certain decision. That's what
[16:54] conferences are for. and to make a
[16:57] decision. men in one place and other
[16:59] place and different minds and usually
[17:02] they have a certain place to have a
[17:04] conference whether in Sweden whether in
[17:06] London whether in England wherever uh
[17:09] you said they have Geneva conference
[17:12] Paris United Nations building they
[17:14] select a place where it's peaceful and
[17:17] attractive to work on the human spirit
[17:20] and usually there are conferences when
[17:22] there's a crisis when there's a crisis
[17:25] when there's a crucial need conferences
[17:27] are held and he spoke about when Hitler
[17:30] was around and Churchill Churchill and
[17:31] Roosevelt and others tried to put their
[17:33] senses together to pull it because it
[17:36] was a crucial moment when the world have
[17:38] been
[17:39] destroyed and he says here now the
[17:42] reason that they put these selected
[17:44] places and the reason they have them we
[17:46] are forced to a conference. So Hitler
[17:50] action invading this country that neck
[17:52] country and next country and so on
[17:54] forced the other countries of the world
[17:58] to get into a conference to decide how
[18:00] we will deal with it.
[18:03] That is the way they
[18:05] met post to a conference. And I want to
[18:11] let you know tonight the last plague
[18:14] that struck Egypt was death. And the
[18:16] prophet said the last plague going to
[18:17] strike before the Exodus is death. But
[18:20] this death is spiritual death. People in
[18:22] church are not dead. People in the
[18:25] message I'm going to say this way. I I I
[18:27] I'll keep it zoomed in. Why take church
[18:29] as Baptist, Methodist, Pentecost? No.
[18:32] people in the message with books and
[18:36] tapes, four years stone dead, hit with
[18:40] spiritual death. And it's a terrible
[18:42] thing because death carries a spirit
[18:44] with it. It carries an atmosphere with
[18:47] it. It is cold. It has no worship. It
[18:50] has no atmosphere. It is just dead.
[18:54] That's what the letter does. It kills.
[18:57] People are killed in their pews. killed
[18:59] in churches because the letter kill it
[19:02] but the spirit giveth life. You have to
[19:04] believe this is a word to you. A word of
[19:08] the scriptures. A word from the Lord.
[19:10] Let's continue. Praise the Lord. He said
[19:13] now the first thing that I could call
[19:15] for this earth first conference was in
[19:17] the garden of Eden when the angels
[19:21] came weeping saying your child has
[19:23] fallen. He sinned. He's broken your
[19:26] commandments. Something had to be done.
[19:28] The creator of God had fallen from
[19:30] grace, was subject unto eternal
[19:32] separation from the presence of his God
[19:34] and his maker. It was a crucial moment
[19:36] for the king of heaven that said, "The
[19:38] day you eat thereof, that day you die."
[19:41] And putting his trust into his son, his
[19:44] son broke his commandment. There had to
[19:46] be something done. It has, it was his
[19:49] creation. It was the work of his own
[19:50] hand. It was the love of his heart, the
[19:53] apple of his eye. Something must be
[19:55] done. So there was a conference call.
[19:59] God selected a certain tree in the
[20:00] garden of Eden. After he had thrown out
[20:03] bloody sheep skin behind the bushes, he
[20:05] called Adam and Eve. And there he made a
[20:07] conference and took over and made a
[20:09] remedy for this horrible thing his
[20:11] children had done. And there a decision
[20:15] was made. Always at a conference there
[20:18] is a decision. So if tonight you're
[20:21] trying to have a conference with God and
[20:23] in that there is no decision, you do not
[20:26] have a
[20:27] conference. A conference produces a
[20:31] decision. Some people don't want to go
[20:33] all the way because they don't want to
[20:34] give up certain
[20:36] things. And because they don't want to
[20:38] give up, they don't come like they're
[20:41] not ready yet to surrender because
[20:43] they're not ready yet to give up.
[20:46] They're not ready yet. They still want
[20:47] to have a X in the closet. They still
[20:49] want to have some path. They still want
[20:50] to have some bridge just in case they
[20:52] could turn back too. They they don't see
[20:54] themselves blowing up the bridge behind
[20:56] them and like Paul see this way
[20:59] forgetting the things that are passed. I
[21:01] press towards the mark. That is what God
[21:04] wants for us.
[21:06] So God made a decision and God acted on
[21:10] that decision and God put in a program
[21:13] and a plan of redemption to bring back
[21:16] his Adam and his
[21:19] Eve. But Abraham spoke about the next
[21:21] conference speaking about Moses. This
[21:23] one is very interesting because he was a
[21:25] one-way prophet and this will tie into
[21:28] what was spoken on Wednesday night.
[21:30] Instead of following the instructions of
[21:31] God, he killed a man and had the
[21:33] threatened fear of Pharaoh. He run into
[21:35] the wilderness for 40 years. 40 years
[21:37] think he worshiped 40 years. He thinks
[21:39] he's finished. 40 years because he did
[21:41] something 40 years ago
[21:44] and God is not going to use him again.
[21:48] That's not true. The slaves of Egypt,
[21:50] the task was so great, their backs were
[21:52] so sore, their heart was so broken until
[21:54] their Christ come before God till he was
[21:57] forced. Here we go to a
[22:00] conference. There is a way of forcing a
[22:05] conference. You can do it in your life.
[22:08] It's a showdown. The burdens of the
[22:11] people and the cries were so great till
[22:14] God had to be forced to call a
[22:16] conference. Do you see it tonight that
[22:19] your tears, your prayer, your cry, your
[22:22] burden could push God to act? And when
[22:26] God made a decision, it's got to be that
[22:29] way. We put a skip down. So God got a
[22:34] man called Moses, his servant. So before
[22:36] the foundation of the world, here we go.
[22:37] Moses was chosen to deliver the people.
[22:41] Moses had failed God. So failure is
[22:45] not a is is it could be a setback, but
[22:51] it doesn't cancel what God has ordained
[22:54] for your life. That should give us
[22:56] confidence and courage. Here we go.
[22:59] Listen. We who have feel God. We still
[23:03] have hopes. We feel him as a church. We
[23:07] feel him as a people. But let's call a
[23:11] conference. Talk it over with him. See
[23:14] what he will tell us. See what decision
[23:17] he'll arrive at. Now, God's man had
[23:21] failed. And God had to call a
[23:23] conference. He couldn't use no one else.
[23:26] He selected
[23:28] Moses. So he goes down into the
[23:30] wilderness somewhere in the back of the
[23:32] desert near Sinai. Selected on top of
[23:34] the mountain and he thought, I'll bring
[23:37] Moses up here. This will be a good
[23:39] place. So God selected the place, the
[23:41] mountain away from his wife, his
[23:43] children. And there he spoke to the
[23:46] prophet and they finally arrived at the
[23:48] subject. I have heard the cries of my
[23:51] people. This is on my table now. That's
[23:53] why I call you Moses. I've heard the
[23:54] Christ of my people. I am send you down.
[23:58] And Moses had words back with God. He
[24:00] said, "I'm a man. I can't talk." In this
[24:03] conference, God said to Moses, "Who made
[24:05] the mouth of man? Who made men to talk?
[24:08] Who made the deaf? Who made the dumb?"
[24:10] Moses still complain. He wanted to see
[24:12] God's glory. And God told him, "You know
[24:16] who I am, Moses? I am the God that
[24:18] perform miracles. I am the God that
[24:21] heals the sick. I am I am Jehovah God.
[24:25] And Moses said one more thing I want to
[24:27] know before this conference is closed.
[24:29] Who will I tell Pharaoh sent me? He said
[24:32] tell him I am sent you. Not I was or I
[24:37] will be but forever present. I am is
[24:41] present tense. Moses went down to Egypt.
[24:44] We know the story. And he was a
[24:47] separated person. The people was a
[24:50] separated people by the offering the
[24:52] blood putting the blood of the lintil
[24:54] the door that blood identified them as a
[24:57] separated people. Isn't that right? And
[25:00] after they was marching out, Pharaoh
[25:03] came behind them and listen to this
[25:05] part. This is what I want to get to. And
[25:07] they were on their march after being
[25:08] separated and called out people. They
[25:10] come to the Red Sea. They had to call a
[25:13] halt because they couldn't cross over.
[25:15] So on the journey and we on a journey
[25:17] tonight this this God they have to say
[25:21] stop marching because an obstacle is in
[25:24] front of us. We have mountains on each
[25:27] side and this is what the prophet said
[25:29] you know when that church ever stops
[25:32] that's when Satan takes over you've got
[25:34] to move constantly rapidly marching
[25:38] towards Zion don't let the church of the
[25:41] living God ever be guilty of stopping.
[25:44] So they stopped and said, "What's the
[25:45] matter here?" Soon as they stopped and
[25:47] pitched their tents, they heard rumble
[25:49] of wheels. Pharaoh coming. Brother Baram
[25:52] said this, "You soldiers know the
[25:55] strategy how they shut them off. There
[25:58] was Red Sea before them. uh there were
[26:00] high mountains they could not climb them
[26:02] and they would be be and they'll be
[26:05] stopped by the enemy. It shows this
[26:07] friend this is important tonight even in
[26:10] church today towards the promised land.
[26:13] The enemy is just a jump or two behind
[26:17] us. We cannot stop at this revival. This
[26:21] cannot be calling a halt. Just keep
[26:24] moving on. Go on. You've got a presence
[26:27] of the Holy Spirit with you. night
[26:29] before last and last night. Now
[26:31] continually move on into that. Don't
[26:33] call no halt for the enemy is close
[26:37] behind you. As soon as the halt was
[26:39] called, Pharaoh army was seen coming and
[26:42] the people was in that frantic. But
[26:45] there was one among them who knew there
[26:47] was no reason to be disturbed. He had a
[26:49] conference before. He knowed what had
[26:51] taken to get a hold of God. So he went
[26:53] on a hill, a rock. Moses hilt himself
[26:57] from the rest of the children of Israel
[26:59] and he held a confront. He said, "Lord,
[27:02] I have marched to this place, but an
[27:05] obstacle has stopped us. We have come to
[27:07] a halt." And then brother Ram interject
[27:10] this like our brother here in the
[27:12] wheelchair like maybe you sitting here
[27:14] with cancer or with heart trouble or
[27:17] something that you know you're just
[27:19] going to die right away. The enemy has
[27:22] stopped you. He brought you to a halt.
[27:24] Maybe you come to a halt before the
[27:26] enemy overtook you. Maybe there is
[27:28] something in your life that caused you
[27:31] to halt. Whatever it is, you still have
[27:35] the privilege of a conference. Let's
[27:39] talk it over with him. Let's do
[27:42] something about it. No matter what the
[27:44] enemy is, he's never too great for our
[27:47] God. We need a conference. So Moses went
[27:51] up behind a certain place, we will say,
[27:53] and held a conference with God. He
[27:55] didn't know what to do. Maybe you don't
[27:58] know what to do. Maybe you a sinner. You
[28:00] have done so much sin. Maybe you smoke
[28:03] till you can't smoke no more, till you
[28:04] can't quit it. Maybe you drank till you
[28:07] can't drink no more, but you can't quit
[28:08] it. Maybe you come to a place where
[28:10] you're so full of sin and lust till you
[28:13] have to look at every woman you see
[28:15] wrong. Maybe you even perverted your own
[28:19] natural resources. Maybe you have come
[28:22] to a blink. I don't care where you at.
[28:25] God is still ready to come to you in a
[28:32] conference and talk it over with you. Do
[28:36] you believe this tonight? What I just
[28:37] read here, he said, "I don't care where
[28:41] you are at. God is still ready to come
[28:45] to you in a conference and talk it over
[28:49] with you. You know sometime the devil
[28:53] uh bust people mind telling them it's no
[28:58] use uh going to God because you will do
[29:01] the same thing again. It's no use
[29:04] praying because you would act the same
[29:07] way again. Don't believe the devil's
[29:10] lie. believe what God is saying tonight
[29:15] that you have an access to this
[29:19] conference with God. He wants this
[29:22] conference. He invites you to a
[29:24] conference to discuss. He said, "Listen
[29:26] to this. Maybe you broke up your home.
[29:30] Maybe you left your husband or left your
[29:32] wife. Maybe you run off from your
[29:34] children. There might be many things in
[29:36] this life that the enemy has trapped you
[29:38] into. But remember my brother, sister,
[29:42] this is where I get it from. You still
[29:44] have the rights to have a conference
[29:48] with God. Say this after me. I still
[29:52] have the rights to have a conference
[29:56] with God. Let's say it again. I still
[29:59] have the rights to have a conference
[30:03] with God. Don't ever let the devil
[30:06] cancel that statement from you.
[30:07] Regardless of what condition you find
[30:09] yourself in, regardless of what you're
[30:11] in tonight, what you might be in
[30:13] tomorrow night or or next week or
[30:15] whatever, it doesn't matter. You have a
[30:17] right to pull aside and say, "Lord, I
[30:20] heard a word." You said, "Come and
[30:22] discuss it. Come, let's reason together.
[30:25] Come and let's go over this thing. I am
[30:27] in trouble. I am in weakness. I am in
[30:31] danger. I am in darkness. I'm in my own
[30:34] hell. I'm in my own prison and I want
[30:37] out. How do I get out? Could you lead me
[30:40] out tonight? We're not trying to scream
[30:42] and pull your hair and go crazy. We want
[30:45] you to discuss. You want to talk. We
[30:48] want you to relate. We want you to
[30:51] communicate because he's your Lord and
[30:53] he's your God. You're not going to the
[30:55] mayor. You're not going to the prime
[30:56] minister. You're not going to some
[30:57] governor. You're going to God Almighty
[30:59] and you going to talk it over with him
[31:01] tonight. Let's see if we could wrap up
[31:03] here. Praise the Lord. Remember my
[31:06] brother, sister, you still have the
[31:10] rights to have a conference with God.
[31:12] Moses had a conference and this was the
[31:15] conference. Oh great leader of Israel, I
[31:18] have done all this at your command. I've
[31:19] led these people as you told me to do.
[31:22] I've covered the people by the blood.
[31:23] I've brought down the plagues out of
[31:25] heaven. I've done everything you told me
[31:26] to do and we are trapped. What must I
[31:28] do? Lord, I must have this conference.
[31:32] And perhaps sitting on top of the rock,
[31:34] standing near the cliff of the rock
[31:36] where Moses was praying at a certain
[31:37] sealed place, in that crucial moment,
[31:40] something had to be done. They'll be
[31:42] crushed under the wheels of their
[31:43] chariots. They'll be pushed over every
[31:45] little Hebrew baby would would be busted
[31:47] in their heads. And that crucial moment
[31:51] and then he said this, maybe just not
[31:54] that way, but maybe a cancer has took a
[31:57] hold of you. Maybe some other disease,
[31:59] maybe sin has took a hold of you. Is
[32:01] going to crush you right down into the
[32:04] devil's hell. A separation from God.
[32:06] Hold a conference
[32:08] quickly. And when this conference was
[32:10] held, God stood on the rock by the side
[32:14] of Moses and he said, "Go back down to
[32:16] the camp, Moses. Go right back where you
[32:19] started from. I am God. Go down and
[32:21] speak to the people. Go forward. I'll
[32:24] make the way when it comes time to make
[32:26] the way. I'm a way making God. Moses
[32:29] after the confront was over was
[32:32] dismissed from the presence of God with
[32:35] a order to go forward and walked on and
[32:38] said, "Fear not Israel. Stand still this
[32:41] day and see the power of God. Go towards
[32:45] the sea." Oh, hallelujah. My God. This
[32:48] is so mind-blowing. Could you imagine
[32:51] this sea that was once a obstacle? Moses
[32:54] tell them go towards the seed. Don't
[32:58] move from the commandment. The
[32:59] commandment is go forward. The promise
[33:02] land belongs to us. This enemy is in our
[33:06] way. Has got got us cut off. But God
[33:09] said go forward. Keep moving. That's
[33:13] here we go. Listen. Listen, church.
[33:15] That's the matter with the church today.
[33:17] God calls you and he wants to give you
[33:20] Here we go. gift after gift. power after
[33:24] power, grace after grace, but you
[33:27] organize yourself. Well, I can't go any
[33:30] further because the church won't let me.
[33:32] See, there's no halting place in God.
[33:34] There's no place for denomination.
[33:36] There's no place to keep a certain
[33:38] standard. The thing of it is go forward.
[33:41] Speak God's word. Go forward. Just keep
[33:43] moving on. Keep moving. God says it's
[33:45] right. You got a commission. So, I say,
[33:47] "Well, I went to church and they told me
[33:49] that I ought not to go up to the
[33:50] tabernacle. I'm all confused about
[33:52] whether I should have the Holy Ghost or
[33:54] not. The promise is yours. It's to you
[33:56] and your children and to them that are
[33:58] far off. God said so. Go forward. Watch
[34:02] the enemy scatter. Watch the Red Sea
[34:04] open. Have a conference. Go forward. It
[34:07] will open. God is the way of escape. He
[34:10] made a way right straight to the
[34:11] promised land. Anything got in the way,
[34:13] he moved out of the way. Oh, praise God.
[34:16] And that's what Isaiah said. If you are
[34:18] sinful, your sins are like scarlet. Why
[34:21] don't you come and let us reason
[34:24] together? I'm almost
[34:26] done. And then he spoke about another
[34:28] conference with
[34:29] Jesus. And then Jesus, the
[34:33] lamb was the dove was leading the lamb
[34:35] to its death. And angels came down to
[34:38] listen at the conference. M Gabriel,
[34:40] Michael, wormwood, all the thousand of
[34:42] them sitting around the rock. He said to
[34:44] the disciples, he said, "They have lots
[34:46] of big meetings." And he had a
[34:48] conference. Now the father said, "Are
[34:51] you willing? Is your love for your
[34:53] brethren great enough? Is your love for
[34:56] that sinful stinking world that you were
[34:59] born in? Do you love them enough to
[35:00] forfeit your life? Do you love them
[35:03] enough to take their place, to bear
[35:05] their sins, the cruish debt? You could
[35:08] be nothing, die that kind of death but
[35:10] him." But in that conference such a
[35:13] decision was made.
[35:14] Note
[35:16] conference built decisions. Conference
[35:20] is not talk and there is no action point
[35:23] and there is no delivery of services as
[35:25] to what to do or what next course of
[35:27] action should we take. So if you have a
[35:29] conference with God, we if you have a
[35:32] conference with God, listen carefully
[35:33] church, we would see, your wife will
[35:36] see, your husband will see, your
[35:38] children will see the effect of the
[35:40] decision you made based upon that
[35:44] contracts. The father said, "Are you
[35:47] willing?" And such a decision was made
[35:50] until his blood dropped from his brow.
[35:53] He was under strain. The sins of the
[35:55] world was upon him. He looked into the
[35:57] face of the dove and said, "Not my will,
[36:00] but thy will be done." Then the prophet
[36:02] said this here. Oh, can we have that
[36:06] decision in our hearts this morning? Can
[36:08] you fulfeit that filthy life of yours?
[36:12] Are you willing to look into his face
[36:14] and said, "Not my will. I'm a drunkard,
[36:16] but I'll drink no more. I'm a gambler. I
[36:20] will gamble no more. I'm immoral, but
[36:22] I'll not be that way no more. I'm a
[36:24] liar, but I'll stop it today. I'm a foul
[36:28] person. But in this conference, and I
[36:30] say tonight, I would look into your face
[36:32] and take like my master who died for me
[36:35] to make my way clear. Not my will, your
[36:38] will. If it cost me my home, if it cost
[36:40] my husband, my wife, my father, my
[36:43] mother, my fellowship, my church
[36:44] membership, whatever it cost me in this
[36:48] conference tonight, I say I want your
[36:51] Holy Spirit to live in me. I have heard
[36:53] about it. I want you in me. Not mine,
[36:56] but yours. That is my decision. God has
[36:59] called a place not upon some high
[37:01] pinnacle, but a humble little tabernacle
[37:03] about to fall in. We have to have a
[37:06] conference. We are going to have a
[37:07] conference. And this is the last one.
[37:10] Are we going to
[37:12] close? This blow my mind. He talk about
[37:15] the conference. I will never leave you.
[37:17] I'll be with you. So, they didn't know
[37:20] how they will ever do this. So they went
[37:23] to
[37:24] Pentecost. 120 went to the upper room,
[37:26] closed the door and they waited and they
[37:29] waited. The trouble with us is we if we
[37:32] don't get an audience with God in about
[37:34] 10 minutes, we are tired. Our knees are
[37:37] hurting. We want to leave. If he doesn't
[37:40] answer us according to what we want, the
[37:42] way we think, we are disgusted with him.
[37:45] Oh, come let us reason together. Go up
[37:47] to Pentecost. I want to reason with you.
[37:51] just go up there and wait. 10 days they
[37:53] were sitting, standing, praying,
[37:56] everything, waiting for the promise. And
[37:59] all of a sudden, the results of the
[38:02] conference in heaven came down. The Holy
[38:04] Ghost like a rushing mighty wind. It
[38:06] filled all the house where they were
[38:08] sitting. They were filled with the Holy
[38:10] Ghost and they went forth preaching the
[38:12] word. When we have wool conferences,
[38:14] they usually have a selected place. And
[38:16] what do they do at the conference? They
[38:17] drink drinks, cocktails, smoke cigars,
[38:19] cigarettes. They lie to one another,
[38:22] deceive one another at peace talks of
[38:24] the world. But when God calls a
[38:26] conference, it is fasting, cleaning up,
[38:30] prayer, receiving our orders, going
[38:33] forward. That is called conference. Not
[38:36] feasting, but fasting. Not indulging in
[38:39] filth, but separating and cleansing
[38:41] yourself from all unrighteousness. So
[38:43] when you go before God, cleaning
[38:45] yourself by faith through applying the
[38:47] hiss up of the blood and cleansing your
[38:49] heart and walking before God for a
[38:51] conference, that's the kind of
[38:53] conference when you meet with God. Then
[38:55] God give you the orders and then he goes
[38:58] with you. May God bless his word
[39:00] tonight. Let's pray. Heavenly Father, I
[39:02] thank you Lord. I thank you for this
[39:03] word. I thank you for this word because
[39:05] the word is God. I thank you for the
[39:07] reality of calling us Lord to reason, to
[39:10] discuss, to talk it over. And now as
[39:13] they go into prayer, I pray this stir in
[39:16] the people's spirit have a conference
[39:18] with you. Lord, we are not Lutherans.
[39:20] We're not Wesleyians. We're not
[39:21] Pentecostals. We are sons and daughters
[39:23] of God called in this last day into a
[39:27] manifested reality. When Jesus told the
[39:29] woman at the well that the hour come
[39:31] when the true worshippers would worship
[39:33] the father in spirit and truth that
[39:36] sounds so light that sound that if it's
[39:39] just a word just there but to know by
[39:42] revelation that the truth was lost
[39:44] through the ages and you send an end
[39:46] time prophet messenger William Brham to
[39:48] restore that truth to bring us to the
[39:50] fate where we could correctly worship
[39:52] and to see the deadness and the lethargy
[39:55] and the sluggumishness of the people the
[39:58] entitlement like if they're entitled to
[40:00] the rapture because of what they
[40:02] believe. It's a shame, Lord. But God set
[40:06] our hearts on fire. The wise virgin paid
[40:09] a price. The foolish virgin was an idol
[40:12] and foolishness, but the wise was ready.
[40:16] And that is why they could go when the
[40:19] call behold the bride who cometh came
[40:20] forth. Father, help us tonight. May we
[40:23] not take this lightly. Maybe not take
[40:25] this as a as just like a sinner message
[40:27] or a sinner call because your
[40:29] restoration comes through repentance.
[40:32] That is your desire. You want man to
[40:34] repent. Repent of their sins. Repent of
[40:36] their past. Repent of their behavior.
[40:38] Discuss and come under the blood.
[40:40] Father, bless them tonight as they
[40:42] repent, as they talk it over, as they
[40:44] share their troubles with you. And lay
[40:46] the burdens at Calvar's cross. Lay their
[40:48] burdens at your feet. Grant it, Lord.
[40:50] Touch Anne tonight with his chest pain.
[40:53] Touch anyone here tonight who might have
[40:56] a trouble in their bodies, in their
[40:57] bones, in their mind, in their spirit.
[40:59] Touch them tonight and heal them. Heal
[41:01] the sick in our midst tonight and visit
[41:02] us with your presence, your love, and
[41:04] your power. In Jesus name I ask it. Amen
[41:07] and amen. God bless you. I trust tonight
[41:09] that these words would stir your spirit
[41:12] and help you to recognize that God is
[41:14] not dead. He's alive and he wants to do
[41:17] something special for you. That is why,
[41:21] praise God, you're going to bring this
[41:22] thought to you that you have a right to
[41:25] having a conference with God. So, God
[41:27] bless you as we get down in prayer right
[41:29] now. Praise the Lord.

[1:32:19] Woo!
[1:33:03] Thank you Lord. Thank you Lord. Thank
[1:33:05] you Lord Jesus. Thank you for your
[1:33:06] presence Lord. Thank you for your spirit
[1:33:08] Lord. Thank you for God your fellowship
[1:33:10] father. Thank you for your blood. Thank
[1:33:12] you for this opportunity to call upon
[1:33:14] your name and to talk it over with you.
[1:33:16] Lord we praise you. We bless your name.
[1:33:18] We thank you for your love. We thank you
[1:33:20] for your grace. We thank you for send
[1:33:22] this end time this evening light that we
[1:33:23] could know to place our feet. We thank
[1:33:26] you for the encouraging words Lord from
[1:33:28] the scriptures for the word is God. We
[1:33:30] believe you. We believe your word. We
[1:33:33] believe the truth of your word. Believe
[1:33:34] that we could be anchored by your word.
[1:33:36] We could rest our faith upon that word.
[1:33:39] Your word is true. Your word is oh God
[1:33:42] is real father. Oh God make it positive
[1:33:44] father. You said when the enemy come
[1:33:45] like a flood, the spirit of God to raise
[1:33:48] a standard against the enemy by taking
[1:33:50] the same word and making it more
[1:33:51] positive. Father, may this word become
[1:33:54] so positive tonight into the hearts of
[1:33:56] every one of your children gathered
[1:33:58] here. Every one of your children that is
[1:34:00] hearing, Father, that will be inspiring
[1:34:02] to the hearts to know of your love, to
[1:34:04] know of your goodness, to know of your
[1:34:06] grace, to know of your favor, Father,
[1:34:08] that you favor us in a way that you want
[1:34:10] to have fellowship with us. You want us
[1:34:12] to discuss our weaknesses, our faults,
[1:34:13] our sins, our failures, our fears, our
[1:34:16] shortcomings, the thing that uh trash
[1:34:18] us, the things that hurt us, the things
[1:34:20] that affect us, that we could walk into
[1:34:22] a straight line of faith to believe and
[1:34:24] trust you for all things. When things
[1:34:26] seems all negative all around, we could
[1:34:28] still believe you and trust you. It was
[1:34:30] an amazing thing to see how Moses would
[1:34:32] come down and tell the people go towards
[1:34:35] the sea. The very thing that seem as an
[1:34:37] obstacle, the very same thing that seems
[1:34:40] as a hindrance, he said go towards it.
[1:34:42] Go towards it. Go towards whatever is
[1:34:45] like an obstacle or hindrance or going
[1:34:47] to affect us. Go towards it because it
[1:34:49] will be defeated. It will be conquered.
[1:34:51] You will make a way for us. Father, we
[1:34:52] thank you in advance for what you'll do
[1:34:54] this coming Sunday that your fire would
[1:34:56] fall. Your power would come out in a
[1:34:58] special way. May the people of faith,
[1:35:00] may the believer's faith grow to believe
[1:35:02] what they pray and what they ask for
[1:35:05] that you would grant. And they would
[1:35:06] come on Sunday under expectation for
[1:35:09] what they asked for. They asking for
[1:35:11] breakthrough, they come expecting it.
[1:35:13] Asking for healing, they could come
[1:35:15] expecting it. Asking for the appointment
[1:35:16] of the spirit, they could come expecting
[1:35:18] it. Asking for revival, they could come
[1:35:20] expecting it. Father God, may you there
[1:35:22] be such a great expectations this coming
[1:35:24] Sunday that there'll be an explosion of
[1:35:26] your Holy Spirit that the minister won't
[1:35:28] be able to minister. Father God, may
[1:35:29] there be a short quick message that will
[1:35:31] shake the whole nation by the Holy Ghost
[1:35:33] to token itself making appearance among
[1:35:36] us. Granted, Father, in Jesus name I ask
[1:35:38] it. I commit each one into your hands.
[1:35:40] The elders, the ministers, oh God, the
[1:35:42] elders, the deacons, the trustees, oh
[1:35:44] God, all the helps, the entire church,
[1:35:46] we commit it into your hands. We commit
[1:35:48] their lives into your hands. It's in
[1:35:50] Jesus name I ask it. Amen. And amen. God
[1:35:52] bless you saints. It's good to be here
[1:35:54] tonight. It's good to get a word from
[1:35:57] God. I hope you leave here strengthened,
[1:35:59] encouraged, and trust in him for all
[1:36:01] things. God bless you. Thanks again for
[1:36:04] being here tonight. God bless.
