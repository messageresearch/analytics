[9:49] Pastor asked me to bring a thought here
[9:51] tonight
[9:52] so my title is rebuild the church again
[9:54] under the power of the spirit amen
[9:57] that's my thought tonight rebuild the
[10:00] church again under the power of the
[10:03] spirit and we know that that's a direct
[10:05] quote that the prophet preached on the
[10:06] message of Grace and I'll jump to it one
[10:09] time amen so that we uh we on the ball
[10:11] amen birth 50 he said and we know that
[10:14] the scripture says that Jesus is the
[10:16] Chief Cornerstone and he's also the
[10:19] headstone amen is Narayan he said now if
[10:23] we think for a few minutes that the
[10:26] seventh Church age messenger was to
[10:28] restore the faith of the children back
[10:31] to the fathers amen that's what he was
[10:34] sent to do isn't that right the prophet
[10:36] said in other words he was sent to
[10:38] rebuild the church again under the power
[10:41] of the spirits amen he said not by power
[10:44] not by might but by my spirit saith the
[10:48] Lord not by organization not by deny
[10:52] Nation but by the Holy Spirit God will
[10:55] bring forth the church in the last day
[10:58] oh can we say amen hallelujah hallelujah
[11:02] he said the Ruba Bell was the prince
[11:04] with Joshua was the one that was to
[11:06] bring forth this headstone and he had
[11:08] laid a foundation he took the people
[11:10] back to the foundation in type amen
[11:14] isn't that rhyme praise God and this
[11:16] inspiration is a kind of special to me
[11:18] praise God because I thought about it
[11:21] when I uh when we were thinking about
[11:23] naming our son praise God and that
[11:25] inspiration come to me rebuild the
[11:26] church again in the power of the spirit
[11:28] praise God and how Ezra praise God and
[11:31] Nehemiah and how they were rebuilding
[11:33] the temple back in those days praise God
[11:36] in that right and Ezra had the census of
[11:38] the names that was to come back from
[11:40] Babylon praise God back to Israel back
[11:42] to repopulate back to rebuild back to
[11:45] restore praise what was destroyed what
[11:47] was ravaged what was demolished God was
[11:49] doing or repealing and I was thinking to
[11:51] myself there is going to be a generation
[11:53] of young people on this Earth who will
[11:56] witness another rebuilding or rebuilding
[11:59] of the church under the power of the

[12:20] praise God for this inspiration is
[12:22] special to me praise God and I was
[12:24] thinking about it praise God a few weeks
[12:26] ago and how God was just quickly to me
[12:28] that that's what he's been doing
[12:30] all these years what has God been doing
[12:33] it wasn't just by chance Luther or by
[12:36] chance Wesley or by chance praise God
[12:38] the Pentecostals rise up but God true
[12:40] ages and through churches and through
[12:43] generations has been building something

[15:02] children just to and fro by any wind of
[15:05] Doctrine but we're rooted and grounded
[15:08] in love predestinated unto the adoption
[15:12] of sons oh all about Jesus Christ to
[15:15] himself
[15:16] according to the good pleasure of his
[15:18] will oh that he had purpose in himself
[15:21] that in the dispensation of times oh
[15:24] hallelujah oh the word is Coming Alive
[15:27] Tonight glory to God hallelujah oh
[15:32] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[15:36] my
[15:37] to rebuild so you say on fire tonight
[15:40] amen I feel good the holy spirit is here
[15:42] amen
[15:43] rebuild what is it to build something
[15:46] again after it had been damaged or maybe
[15:49] destroyed rather isn't that right isn't
[15:52] that right it said when somebody's being
[15:54] built it's usually built according to a
[15:56] pattern according to a plan something
[15:59] isn't that right
[16:00] God in the beginning had a plan
[16:03] had a pattern of what his sons would
[16:05] look like or what his daughters would
[16:07] look like when he thought of you his
[16:10] thought of you was perfect oh Hallelujah
[16:12] isn't all right oh his foot's first
[16:15] thought was perfect when he spoke man in
[16:17] the beginning when he placed that man in
[16:19] the Garden of Eden oh that was a perfect
[16:21] place and he was in Perfection oh
[16:24] hallelujah's man that fell from that
[16:26] stage but when God placed his man he did
[16:28] a perfect job therefore if God is to
[16:31] place another man he has to do it the
[16:33] same way if God is a place another son
[16:36] another daughter of God into the kingdom
[16:39] of God he has to do it the same way oh
[16:43] that's why we are going back to another
[16:45] Garden of Eden we're going back to Adam
[16:48] we're going practice before the fall
[16:50] before before there was a moon before
[16:52] there was a star before there was a
[16:54] molecule you are going to burn back you
[16:57] have been repels being restored being
[17:00] regenerated being redeemed back back to
[17:03] our fallen Fallen condition oh
[17:07] Hallelujah oh in
[17:09] or anything Christ
[17:12] [Music]
[17:13] en that we're entering into now oh we
[17:17] know in parts and we prophesy in part
[17:19] but when tapped with this perfect is
[17:21] calm that which in part will be done
[17:23] away which we are coming to Perfection
[17:26] brother we are coming to a perfect
[17:28] Church where Jesus walking in it healing
[17:32] us sick raising the dead casting out
[17:35] troubles just like he did back there
[17:37] he'll do the same town here tonight
[17:41] oh do you believe it
[17:44] Hallelujah
[17:45] glory of God hallelujah oh Hallelujah
[17:50] amen so when he made man in the
[17:52] beginning it was a perfect establishment
[17:55] isn't that right
[17:56] perfectly established he was rightfully
[17:58] placed everything yeah
[18:00] therefore if God made another man you'd
[18:02] have to make
[18:03] he'd have to be like Adam
[18:05] it's not right
[18:06] you have to be spoken into
[18:08] that's why Christ when he come as a
[18:10] second Adam he's spoken to Mary said
[18:12] you're going to bring forth Christ isn't
[18:15] our Hail Mary not highly favored isn't
[18:16] that right praise God she asks how can
[18:18] these things be he said the Holy Ghost
[18:20] is going to overshadow you praise God
[18:22] Holly you're going to produce this
[18:24] Messiah this promised one that was to
[18:27] come to ages and generations you are the
[18:29] one Mary that was chosen and she told oh
[18:33] how she told the angel be a turn unto me
[18:35] according to Thy word and that was it
[18:39] she received a spoken word into season
[18:42] and that took life in her she believed
[18:46] the testimony so much she ran to her
[18:48] cousin and said I know something's
[18:51] taking place inside of me I know I heard
[18:54] a testimony oh Hallelujah Christ has
[18:56] reinformed in me oh you won't believe
[18:59] what happened you won't believe what I
[19:01] heard and she testified isn't that right
[19:03] glory to God hallelu will you have a
[19:06] genuine experience you testify amen you
[19:09] tell somebody about it praise God it's
[19:11] not right you don't just go all but you
[19:13] go and tell Prophet said go and tell the
[19:16] people something go tell them messiah's
[19:19] on here now go tell them to seek our
[19:21] heel go tell them to tell our race go
[19:24] tell them the blind sea one of these
[19:27] days God is going to anoint our church
[19:29] with such a power of the holy spirit
[19:32] that when they go they will go telling
[19:35] brother go tell my son amen all my
[19:38] people I am I am alive I am the same
[19:41] yesterday I am the same today I am the
[19:44] same forever go tell my disciples I am
[19:47] not dead go tell the people in this
[19:49] message that are sick of being healed
[19:52] that the terms speak not the blinds see
[19:55] that the walk that the gospel is
[19:57] preaching is power that same anointing
[20:00] that was over Malachi for profit it's
[20:03] promise will be upon you oh oh you're
[20:06] gonna walk in Jesus name you're gonna
[20:09] talk like Jesus You're Gonna Be Like
[20:12] Jesus You're Gonna manifest Jesus Christ
[20:15] in this last day give the Lord a shot of
[20:18] praise tonight Hallelujah
[20:20] glory to God
[20:22] amen amen amen
[20:24] my Hallelujah
[20:27] so here's the pattern one question
[20:30] answers the prophet said how many women
[20:31] here doesn't know that when you're going
[20:33] to cut a piece of goods he said you
[20:35] later Goods out like this and you lay a
[20:38] pattern on it like this and you cut the
[20:40] goods just according to the pattern
[20:43] is that right and the rest of the goods
[20:46] is just the same kind of good that's in
[20:48] the pattern is that right but this is
[20:51] the kind you take talk about the kind in
[20:54] the pattern that's the kind you take he
[20:57] said you might lay away that away for
[20:59] further use talking about a Remnant you
[21:01] might lay that away the goods that you
[21:04] cut off he said isn't that right he said
[21:06] now who places a pattern he said God by
[21:09] election amen isn't that right God by
[21:13] election places a pattern oh so the
[21:16] policing is his election oh him policing
[21:19] is the election oh he knows who would
[21:22] love him he knows from before the
[21:23] beginning who would choose those
[21:25] straight and narrower oh who would leave
[21:28] the highways come find Christ oh honey
[21:32] praise God in a secret place under the
[21:35] Shadow the almighty he knew oh hello who
[21:37] was predestinated in there he knew who
[21:40] was going to be sealed in there he knew
[21:42] your name from before
[21:50] amen so he said who plays the pattern
[21:52] gone by election
[21:54] God by election places a pattern he said
[21:57] no I have chosen before the foundation
[22:00] of the world I placed this he said why
[22:02] Jesus told the disciples what that when
[22:04] he was with them he said he had chose
[22:07] them isn't that right
[22:09] and he knew them before the foundational
[22:10] world was ever laid is that right so God
[22:14] places the pattern praise God that's the
[22:17] election I said now there'll be an elect
[22:19] that go into the Rapture praise God and
[22:22] there'll be a group of people that's
[22:23] good upright holy living oh you heard
[22:26] about that Sunday right amen amen God
[22:29] saved people huh and that no not being a
[22:31] Rapture they'd have to come up in a
[22:33] second Resurrection right he said amen
[22:37] so that's about the pattern isn't that
[22:38] right here's the prophet's talking about
[22:40] talking about it amen so therefore if
[22:42] God building anything he has to have a
[22:44] plan on how to build it isn't that right
[22:45] and if God is rebuilding the church
[22:47] again like what we're talking about
[22:49] tonight then it has to be according to a
[22:51] pattern that he has established the
[22:53] first time amen isn't that right
[22:56] Hallelujah Prophet said on dedication
[22:59] 1962 he said now if you notice Solomon
[23:02] never varied one bit from the pattern
[23:04] that Moses saw on Mount Sinai in heaven
[23:07] amen he said Moses when he returned from
[23:11] his vision he pitched the tent and he
[23:13] made it just exactly like he saw in
[23:16] heaven and when Solomon built the temple
[23:19] amen he's made it just exactly the way
[23:22] he's seen the pattern the type oh
[23:25] hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right
[23:27] oh Glory so God revealed to all Prophet

[27:18] yeah having information praise God

[27:27] Adam had a witness of God coming down on
[27:29] a cooler evening or when he fell out of
[27:31] his position when he fell out of his
[27:33] place he lost that anointing or he lost

[28:29] patterned that's the way everyone should
[28:32] be patented just the way that it was at

[28:42] got to come God provided away you can't

[33:08] and we tend to judge it from our own
[33:10] place and say well we think it's that or
[33:11] we think it's this praise God but if we
[33:14] look at the true God's eyes through his

[34:11] he said all Ministry now watch which is
[34:13] a beautiful type there or an anti-type

[37:04] consecrated sword at a cross and then he
[37:06] said now and he's and we say he said now
[37:08] now sit at church the other night and we
[37:10] heard such and such a thing that can be
[37:11] of God but if it's in line with the
[37:13] pattern if it's in line with the
[37:16] Scripture it may be odd but it's going
[37:18] to have its place see once it's in line
[37:20] with that scripture it'll have its place
[37:22] it'll fit right in he said and it won't
[37:24] even need honing or polishing he said
[37:26] it'll go right into its go into its
[37:28] place for the great architect Christ is
