[8:53] email
[8:54] tonight we want to turn to one portion
[8:56] of scripture from hebrews
[8:58] chapter 11. we want to read a couple of
[8:59] verses there one read verse one
[9:02] then one with the five and six and then
[9:03] 31 to 40.
[9:05] hebrews chapter 11
[9:07] reading verse 1.
[9:09] now faith is a substance of things
[9:10] before
[9:12] the evidence of things not seen
[9:14] verse 5.
[9:16] by faith enoch was translated
[9:18] that he should not see death
[9:20] and was not found
[9:22] because god had translated him
[9:26] but
[9:26] for before his translation
[9:29] he had this testimony that he pleased
[9:30] god i without faith is impossible to
[9:33] please him
[9:34] for he that committed god must believe
[9:37] that he is
[9:38] and that he is a rewarder of them that
[9:41] diligently seek him let's go down to
[9:43] verse 31.
[9:50] by faith
[9:51] the hard rehab
[9:53] we always talk about the harlot and so
[9:55] on like rehab but
[9:57] is by fate
[9:59] by faith the hala riya perished not with
[10:01] them that believed not
[10:02] when she had received the spice with
[10:04] peace
[10:05] what shall i most say
[10:08] for the time would feel me to tell of
[10:10] gideon of barack of samson of jephthah
[10:13] of david also simone of the prophets who
[10:15] true faith subdue kingdoms wrought
[10:18] righteousness obtained promises
[10:21] stopped them out of lions quenched the
[10:23] violence of the fire
[10:25] escape the edge of the sword
[10:27] out of weakness
[10:29] were made strong
[10:31] villains and fight
[10:33] turned to flight the armies of the
[10:35] aliens
[10:36] women received their dead raised to life
[10:39] again
[10:40] others were tortured not accepting
[10:42] deliverance that they might obtain a
[10:44] better resurrection others had trial of
[10:46] cruel mockings and squadrons year
[10:48] moreover of bonds and imprisonment they
[10:51] were stoned they were shown asunder were
[10:53] tempted were slain with the sword
[10:56] they wandered about in sheepskin and
[10:57] goat skin
[10:59] being destitute
[11:00] afflicted tormented of whom the world
[11:02] was not worthy they wandered in deserts
[11:05] and mountains and dens
[11:07] caves of the earth and these all haven't
[11:10] obtained a good report through fate
[11:11] received not the promise
[11:13] god having provided some better things
[11:15] for us
[11:16] the day without us
[11:17] should not be made perfect may god bless
[11:19] this would you be seated
[11:22] i want to take a title
[11:25] from verse 34
[11:26] where he said quench the violence of
[11:28] fire escape the edge of the sword out of
[11:31] weakness were made strong watch
[11:33] brilliant in fight turn to flight the
[11:36] armies of the aliens and the title i
[11:38] have tonight is out of weakness they
[11:40] were made strong
[11:42] what a time
[11:44] last sunday
[11:45] uh the continuation of the book of the
[11:48] generation of jesus christ
[11:50] i believe the holy spirit used alberta
[11:52] mightily
[11:54] to bring out uh the the history and and
[11:58] and the channels that god used
[12:00] having some real colorful uh stories
[12:03] and tonight just wanna draw some
[12:05] inspiration out of weakness they were
[12:08] made strong
[12:09] another thought is very strange but
[12:12] changes equal pressure over time that's
[12:15] like a formula like a piece of achiever
[12:18] so happened i want to do some work
[12:19] around here at home and i'm looking for
[12:21] i couldn't get my um
[12:22] the fire the final cutlass
[12:25] so i decided to do it the old-fashioned
[12:27] way
[12:28] of taking the carpets and rubbing
[12:29] against the stone
[12:30] it's an old fashioned way to sharpen the
[12:32] cabbage
[12:33] and recognize that i had to apply
[12:35] pressure
[12:37] and had to take some time
[12:39] but i every time i keep pushing the
[12:41] cutlass on the stone with some water you
[12:44] keep firing
[12:45] you see the edges getting shiny
[12:48] getting sharp i could feel
[12:50] the sharpness of it so i begin to think
[12:53] about what
[12:54] pressure over time does
[12:56] not just time
[12:58] but what pressure
[13:00] over time
[13:02] what it does it brings a change
[13:05] and this life of faith is not a one-time
[13:08] thing
[13:10] faith is a walk
[13:13] it's a life
[13:15] by faith you come here tonight
[13:17] you come here by faith tonight and if
[13:20] you come by faith you're going to
[13:21] receive
[13:22] something tonight
[13:24] because it's not just natural you come
[13:26] in let by the spirit you come to hear
[13:29] something from god
[13:30] it's not right
[13:32] praise the lord
[13:33] judges 6 14 and the lord look upon him
[13:37] and this is this is gautam the gideon in
[13:39] coleman go in this thy might and thou
[13:42] shall save israel from the hand of the
[13:44] midianites have that i sent thee
[13:47] he said unto him
[13:48] o my lord
[13:50] where it shall i save israel behold
[13:54] my family is poor
[13:56] in manhassee
[13:57] and i am the least
[13:59] in my father's house
[14:01] and the lord said unto him surely i will
[14:03] be with you
[14:05] and thou shalt smite the midianites
[14:08] as one man
[14:10] it is amazing how god will take the
[14:12] least yes
[14:15] the lowest
[14:17] the weakest
[14:19] the one that you didn't expect or you
[14:21] wouldn't even think
[14:23] to do great things with
[14:26] hallelujah
[14:27] so god will use and channel and go past
[14:31] human weaknesses and struggles and
[14:32] whatever it is that his sovereign
[14:34] purpose will be accomplished
[14:37] and that is why that book of the
[14:39] generation of jesus christ that is so
[14:41] important
[14:43] to know by and through the bride will be
[14:44] fulfilled all
[14:46] that was prophesied do you believe that
[14:49] so all these different brothers because
[14:51] hebrews 11 is the chapter of the heroes
[14:54] of faith
[14:55] but is out of weakness they were made
[14:56] strong david wasn't a big mighty man
[14:59] with muscles and qualified for the army
[15:02] but god used him
[15:03] as somebody under-qualified
[15:06] and not qualified to qualify him
[15:09] to deal with goliath
[15:11] so when you think you're not qualified
[15:13] or you're unqualified god could qualify
[15:15] you
[15:16] because it's not my mind nor by power
[15:18] it is by his spirit
[15:20] nobody like to have their weaknesses
[15:22] exposed but god did identify
[15:25] these characters in the bible to show
[15:27] not only their strengths but their
[15:28] weaknesses
[15:30] to not only their strength but their
[15:31] struggles and to show that he can't he
[15:33] would deny them because they are part of
[15:35] him
[15:36] they are part of the plan
[15:38] he planned on this great mystery isn't
[15:40] that right
[15:41] jacob i love you so i hate he knew all
[15:44] about jacob before jacob was even born
[15:46] hallelujah he know the kind of person
[15:49] jacob was going to be
[15:50] but that didn't stop him from
[15:52] predestinating jacob onto our desired
[15:55] end
[15:56] hallelujah so all what you go through
[15:58] have a desired end behind it
[16:01] oh glory to god
[16:03] the stories of abraham of moses of sarah
[16:05] all of them you don't only see their
[16:07] faith and their strength but you saw
[16:09] their weaknesses also
[16:11] hallelujah and that is why hebrews 11 is
[16:13] so important because hebrew 11 didn't
[16:16] take to account just their weaknesses it
[16:18] showed their faith in god
[16:20] it didn't say raya but a prostitute he
[16:22] said by faith the hard rehab
[16:25] by faith
[16:26] she didn't perish for the rest of them
[16:28] because she operates under the level of
[16:29] faith it shows how much god honors faith
[16:33] oh glory to god by faith the elders
[16:35] obtain the report and by faith you have
[16:38] a good report tonight
[16:40] but god reserves something better for us
[16:42] that david on us and that made perfect
[16:44] so god call us something higher
[16:47] something further therefore the battle
[16:48] for you could be hotter
[16:50] and heavier
[16:51] because it's a great thing
[16:53] to take us out to this age
[16:56] oh glory to god it will take a great
[16:58] faith to pull along that cap
[17:01] you believe that
[17:02] even the prophet said the third pearl is
[17:04] for the whole weakened fate
[17:05] some people don't have bulldog faith and
[17:07] go go get him speak in faith just speak
[17:09] the word
[17:10] oh glory to god amen
[17:13] do you believe that
[17:14] hallelujah
[17:16] so this fate built out of weakness
[17:19] built out of struggles built out of
[17:21] battles
[17:22] hallelujah
[17:24] old man abraham and god say you have a
[17:26] son
[17:27] hallelujah
[17:28] an impossibility but what drop out on
[17:31] him to see how his faith will get
[17:32] activated how could the old man his wife
[17:36] pass child parent could believe god and
[17:38] the bible said
[17:39] abraham believed god
[17:41] oh glory to god and that belief was
[17:44] imputed unto him for righteousness and
[17:46] the bible said blessed is the man unto
[17:49] whom god will not impute sin
[17:52] oh glory to god because the faith that
[17:54] he had it stood in the gap and the blood
[17:57] of jesus wasn't shed yet oh glory to god
[18:00] and god call that man righteous go do i
[18:03] hear a shout in the house
[18:05] jesus there coming calvary and paid a
[18:07] price yet but the faith and abraham god
[18:10] called the man righteous
[18:12] oh glory to god righteous seed
[18:15] oh yeah i hear you tonight
[18:17] [Music]
[18:18] [Applause]
[18:22] [Music]
[18:26] so i want you to see faith is a journey
[18:29] faith is a process
[18:31] faith as as as in time
[18:34] because it takes abraham 25 years and i
[18:37] love the phrasing that the brother
[18:38] branham brought he said when abram came
[18:40] to the fullness of believing
[18:43] you think he didn't have struggles
[18:44] you think he didn't have doubts when
[18:46] sarah didn't want to make breakfast for
[18:47] him you didn't think he'd get heart
[18:48] problems
[18:52] but he believed god
[18:54] not sarah face not sarah looks
[18:57] but he believed god sarah physical looks
[19:01] wasn't encouraging to him
[19:02] because it couldn't be possible even
[19:04] sarah encouraged him to go unto the
[19:07] higga
[19:08] until yes
[19:22] quench the violence the fire escaped out
[19:24] of the sword out of weakness now there
[19:26] are many people inside of that scripture
[19:27] there you know
[19:29] their name everybody you know he said
[19:30] time would fail to tell all these
[19:32] stories of all these people here the who
[19:34] are god heroes
[19:37] not just god people they know
[19:39] they are god heroes
[19:41] hallelujah
[19:42] quench the violence of fire
[19:44] you could talk about shattered vision
[19:45] escape the edge of the sword out of
[19:48] weakness were made strong wax valiant
[19:51] and fight and turn to flight the armies
[19:54] of the aliens
[19:56] oh glory to god woman received their
[19:58] dead raised a life again
[20:00] they wasn't taking no for an answer
[20:02] oh glory to god you can't give up you
[20:05] can't let go you can't let the condition
[20:08] so get you depressed and done out that
[20:10] you want to give up and let go you
[20:11] cannot do that
[20:12] we're not going to have these heroes
[20:14] inside of here and not been gossiping a
[20:16] prophet to turn our hearts
[20:18] back to the faith of the fathers
[20:20] oh give the lord a shout
[20:22] it has always been about the faith
[20:26] let me say that it has always been about
[20:28] the faith because sin is unbelief
[20:32] [Applause]
[20:38] the collective stories and histories and
[20:41] testimonies they were stoned they were
[20:43] sworn asuna they were tempted
[20:47] are you tempted they were tempted too
[20:50] temptation is part of it they were
[20:52] tempted they were trained with the sword
[20:54] they wonder about the sheepskin and
[20:55] ghost king being destitute afflicted and
[20:58] tormented
[20:59] it wasn't easy
[21:01] because it was a journey
[21:03] because when abraham first got the
[21:04] breakthrough to look for this city he
[21:06] was thought he was going to find that
[21:07] city you're looking for cities making
[21:09] buildings god every time you journey
[21:10] here you say you find that city anybody
[21:12] see that city you see anything
[21:13] resembling this thing we're talking
[21:14] about i'm looking for the city all the
[21:16] time he passed this one he passed he
[21:17] gets an old but he's looking for the
[21:19] city he know there has to be a city
[21:20] somewhere because he belonged to that
[21:22] city he belong he is one of them
[21:24] citizens of that city
[21:26] oh glory to god you don't belong here
[21:29] you're not a trinidadian you belong to
[21:30] the kingdom of god the king of the most
[21:32] high god oh god you have citizenship of
[21:36] that kingdom nobody can deport you
[21:38] nobody can say you can't enter in or
[21:40] give the lord a shout oh glory to call
[21:42] your passport stamp you belong there oh
[21:45] get the lord and shout the hatred amen
[21:48] you are part of this kingdom you are
[21:50] part of that city
[21:52] oh glory to god amen
[21:54] hallelujah
[21:56] glory to god amen thank you lord
[21:58] hallelujah
[22:00] praise the name of the lord
[22:04] [Music]
[22:06] a lifetime of obedience a lifetime of
[22:09] subjection a lifetime of listening to
[22:11] god and the voice of god
[22:13] brother branham
[22:16] a message of the father he was saying
[22:17] yes my word is life and the only thing
[22:20] the letter kill it but the spirit gave
[22:22] it life what i trust now with all my
[22:24] heart that god will quicken which means
[22:26] to make a life quitting the word to you
[22:29] know by his spirit
[22:31] people still look at it regardless of
[22:34] how accurate and how clear and how
[22:36] revealing or how teaching a man could
[22:38] teach or preach or whatever if the
[22:40] spirit
[22:41] is not yet to quit me
[22:43] it's just head you know
[22:45] how many of you stand there
[22:47] the mightiest teacher could come and
[22:49] teach if the spirit is not here to take
[22:52] what is being taught and quicken it it's
[22:54] just knowledge and understanding jamming
[22:56] you're intelligent
[23:00] that's why all these brothers we're
[23:02] talking about here it wasn't knowledge
[23:04] just jamming the intellect
[23:07] because if something was was under the
[23:09] knowledge intellecting when they closed
[23:11] the gate on samsung to lock him up all
[23:13] he was going to watch to get oh god who
[23:15] are the king
[23:17] can i now leave
[23:19] could you open up
[23:26] and as far as some is concerned the
[23:28] understanding is thy seed shall possess
[23:31] the gates of the enemy
[23:33] as far as samson concerned this is in my
[23:35] way
[23:36] that that that app is supposed to be so
[23:39] it's either move it and move something
[23:41] out of the giveaway but i ain't here
[23:43] sign up together i just have to knock a
[23:45] little gate i ain't asking for no key i
[23:47] am the key to that gate

[30:24] seed it's a seed and have the seed no
[30:28] the seed
[30:30] has to be
[30:32] watered
[30:34] like how
[30:35] said the damsel that come and water this
[30:37] canal
[30:38] let that be the woman for isaac
[30:41] and then rebecca came and watered the
[30:43] camel and the prophet said the camel was
[30:45] a power and he said the word is a power
[30:48] and he said the same camera she watered
[30:50] is what took her to isaac and the same
[30:53] word that your water is not going to
[30:54] take it to the jesus
[30:56] and you say how do you water the word
[30:58] with praises
[30:59] with thanksgiving
[31:01] with worship that's why all hell is
[31:04] against worship
[31:05] that's why you hear me say give god some
[31:07] praise
[31:08] i'm not just talking that and just
[31:10] saying that because i feel to say that

[32:04] you may be seated
[32:06] if this message will don't understand
[32:07] the other person people will be sitting
[32:09] within the rapture or whether
[32:10] tribulation come
[32:12] they will be holding holiness ministers
[32:14] who didn't tell them they should have
[32:15] been pressing and pushing all along
[32:17] because the minister is some kind of big
[32:18] messiah bringing manna for them
[32:21] when god when jesus died he feel ran
[32:24] from top to the bottom
[32:25] and and flattened all the ministerial
[32:27] posts and then high priest behind the
[32:29] veil thing
[32:30] and god's showing that this thing will
[32:32] open
[32:33] and no kind first and no high first and
[32:34] however
[32:35] i can't keep you from this thing
[32:38] hallelujah my customer the secret thing
[32:40] and like you see me they need to do that
[32:41] kind of thing behind the people don't
[32:42] know what's going on but when she says
[32:44] bust that veil you say oh no no going on
[32:46] that thing finished with
[32:48] no you have direct access
[32:50] i've given you a password or given a
[32:51] pass code they have direct access to
[32:54] this glory direct access to this
[32:56] presence because this person is the
[32:57] producer not so faithful ministry it's
[32:59] with the sons and daughters of god
[33:01] oh give the lord a shout in the house
[33:04] not a bunch of men we call the original
[33:06] gospel when they take it and take it
[33:08] from the people and put it on men then
[33:09] i'm with the pope
[33:11] god ain't gonna do that no more
[33:13] go ahead and do that at all
[33:15] calling let no man take no glory
[33:17] not no
[33:18] when the pentecostal mess it up when the
[33:20] nicolaitan spirit messes up god will get
[33:22] glory in this hour
[33:24] that means god gonna bring man to know
[33:26] they are nothing that is the divine
[33:28] revelation when we know we are nothing
[33:30] then he becomes everything then he can
[33:32] get glory then what could crush you in
[33:34] your weakness to show us not by your
[33:36] might not by your intellect not by you
[33:38] human spirit he don't need nothing that
[33:40] you have or give the lord a shout
[33:43] he don't need anything you have he just
[33:45] want you to get flushed out
[33:54] that's why some people have to fall
[33:55] because they're too strong
[33:57] all glory and they think it's their
[33:59] strength
[34:00] god you may be seated
[34:08] hallelujah
[34:10] yes yes goddess make sure things happen
[34:12] away
[34:13] that's why when gideon had all them said
[34:15] and said the men god said night too much
[34:16] of people
[34:17] they will say the numbers conquer this
[34:19] thing and then they had a semi test with
[34:21] drinking water this is another on the
[34:22] other and then it comes out of three
[34:24] hundred men he said like this man you're
[34:25] going to defeat the enemy

[39:55] to bring a seed
[39:56] that bring down the holy ghost if the
[39:58] holy ghost will come that celia staying

[40:04] grow
[40:05] that life was in that sea for how much
[40:07] years hundreds of years that life was
[40:09] still inside that seed but they will
[40:11] stay a seed until they go along in the
[40:12] ground

[40:16] that seed that seed in the bride secret
[40:17] the bride the seed in the bride the wild
[40:19] and the bride all that is nice but fire

[41:10] reverend branham
[41:12] there's not a chance for you
[41:16] you see i turn to the old world
[41:19] whatsoever things you desire
[41:21] when you pray
[41:22] believe that you receive them
[41:24] and you shall have them i said father
[41:27] place them in my heart
[41:29] i shall water them with feet be a knight
[41:33] and tonight i stand in perfect health
[41:37] once a blind man
[41:39] led me by my arms i couldn't see a thing
[41:42] just objects in front of me moving only
[41:45] daylight was dark
[41:46] and tonight my ice test 20 20.
[41:50] he said why i took god's word
[41:54] no one with a gift to cast the spirit
[41:56] away
[41:57] the word will do it
[41:58] faith in god's word
[42:05] [Music]
[42:07] yes
[42:08] faith in god's word
[42:10] jesus had all the fine qualities of god
[42:13] in him
[42:14] do you believe that he had powers upon
[42:16] powers but when he met satan
[42:18] he never used his power
[42:20] he gave an example for the weakest of
[42:23] christians
[42:24] when he met satan he said it is written
[42:27] man shunned by bread alone but by every
[42:29] word that proceeded the mother of god
[42:31] the weakest christian
[42:33] can take that stand
[42:36] god in his word
[42:38] and every time when he would meet the
[42:40] enemy he said it's written he had power
[42:42] to do it but he met satan on the same
[42:44] grounds with the same word you can meet
[42:47] him with
[42:48] it is written
[42:50] you believe that one is written whatever
[42:53] things you desire
[42:54] when you pray
[42:56] believe you receive them watch the order
[42:59] of the word
[43:00] believe now present tense you receive it
[43:03] and you shall have it it will be given
[43:06] to you later but believe it now
[43:09] before you can get your crop you've got
[43:12] to plant the seed and water it and
[43:15] believe it don't dig it up every morning
[43:18] to see it and you dig it up you delay it
[43:21] much more it will never grow if you keep
[43:24] digging it up
[43:27] hey remember the agent where you put
[43:28] down the seat you put that seat down
[43:29] inside of it
[43:32] [Music]

[44:25] oh glory to god and remember the
[44:27] quotation the word of god will defeat
[44:30] satan anywhere anytime anyplace under
[44:32] any condition the word of god alone
[44:37] alone i won't emphasize that alone
[44:40] not the word on our gift
[44:42] not the word in a preacher
[44:44] just the word alone
[44:47] [Music]
[44:50] the word of god alone it is written will
[44:51] defeat satan no matter who he is
[44:53] what form he comes in
[44:55] where he's at it will defeat satan
[44:58] the written word of god
[45:01] so the devil don't want two things here
[45:02] now he don't want you in praise and
[45:04] worship and he don't want you with the
[45:05] written word
[45:09] these people in ignorance
[45:14] now watch
[45:15] now here is another statement i want you
[45:17] to remember
[45:19] and that's you especially so sick
[45:21] sitting here with cancer cases and so
[45:23] forth tonight
[45:25] you want them to remember this
[45:27] that
[45:28] the right
[45:30] mental attitude this is your mind now
[45:34] how how you choose to think
[45:37] that that is your
[45:38] how do you say that
[45:40] your mind dispositioned them
[45:43] because somebody could tell you
[45:44] something and you could choose to
[45:45] receive something negative or you choose
[45:47] something positive
[45:48] he said the right
[45:50] mental attitude
[45:52] towards any divine promise of god will
[45:54] bring it to pass
[45:56] can you understand what i mean
[45:59] the right mental attitude was any divine
[46:01] promise of god will bring it apart if
[46:04] you will take the right mental attitude
[46:06] towards anything god has promised
[46:11] did you hear that
[46:12] anything
[46:15] [Music]
[46:26] anything god promised you could have it
[46:29] let me say it again anything god
[46:31] promised
[46:34] you could have it
[46:35] [Applause]
[46:36] you could have the angel of god coming
[46:37] to your house
[46:39] you could have the pillar fire in your
[46:41] home you could have a rainbow over your
[46:43] house
[46:44] you could have healing
[46:46] you could have ceiling
[46:48] you could have deliverance you could
[46:50] have multiplication in your house
[46:52] your food could multiply in your house
[46:54] whatever you have listen
[46:57] when brother bryan give the testimony of
[46:58] speaking squirrels says the hearty right
[47:00] says that's nothing but the truth
[47:03] now that statement nothing but the truth
[47:05] that wasn't just a normal statement you
[47:06] know
[47:07] that actually passed dimensions
[47:12] when she said that that that past
[47:13] dimensions
[47:14] and went into the it break and went into
[47:17] heaven
[47:18] no heaven not up there no happiness
[47:19] right here
[47:21] enough to be mentioned
[47:23] nothing but the truth god heard that
[47:26] and that was so pleasing to god that god
[47:28] dropped down the prophet and said give
[47:30] that woman whatever
[47:32] whatever
[47:34] whatever
[47:35] did you hear that whatever
[47:37] whatever she wanted
[47:39] oh glory to god whatever she wanted
[47:42] it was available
[47:44] all glory to god because this son had
[47:46] access
[47:48] to give that woman
[47:49] whatever she wanted because she said the
[47:52] right thing that means you could say the
[47:54] right thing
[47:56] have to write that is true
[47:57] that's what we're striving for to get
[47:59] people to say the right thing speak the
[48:01] right thing act the right way
[48:02] get the right results
[48:04] hallelujah
[48:07] we find out
[48:09] we find him as soon as god came upon him
[48:11] he was anointed
[48:13] so jesus he was waiting for his
[48:15] anointing
[48:16] age 12 to 30
[48:18] he was waiting for his anointing and
[48:19] that came
[48:20] when he got baptized
[48:22] fullness of the godhead bodily dwelt in
[48:25] him he was anointed
[48:26] he made the christ is not right
[48:29] so what's something now
[48:30] now when he god came upon him he was
[48:32] anointed went in the wilderness and out
[48:35] after 40 days
[48:38] and he defeated satan by the word of god
[48:40] and he did that
[48:42] so he brought this is the part one again
[48:45] any divine promise in reach of the
[48:47] weakest of christians
[48:49] if he was god why did he let satan say
[48:53] if they'll be the son of god before the
[48:54] miracle he says written
[48:56] and so then satan always tries to quote
[48:58] the word
[48:59] so what that shows that you can defeat
[49:01] satan on the word of god no matter the
[49:04] word of god will defeat season any place
[49:05] anywhere under any condition it's if
[49:08] it's in the belly of a whale if it's an
[49:10] alliance then if it's on the bed with a
[49:12] cancer it's laying yonder bleeding to
[49:15] death in an automobile accident the word
[49:17] of god will defeat satan anywhere
[49:20] and the weakest christian can use it
[49:23] it's your god-given privilege
[49:26] to do it
[49:28] oh glory to god did you hear that now
[49:30] it's your privilege to quote back that
[49:32] word the lord that keepeth thee the lord
[49:34] that keepeth thee the son shall not
[49:36] smite me by day not the moon my night
[49:39] he shall preserve thy soul
[49:42] it's your word the lord is my shepherd i
[49:45] shall not want it's your word he leave
[49:47] me beside the still waters it's your
[49:50] word he restored my soul here do i walk
[49:53] to the valley of the shadow of death i
[49:55] shall fear no evil for god with me thy
[49:58] run and stuff they comfort me
[50:00] oh glory to god hallelujah is his word
[50:03] it's your word for glory to god when you
[50:06] take it and you apply it's your word
[50:08] it's no longer in the bible it's yours
[50:10] but give the lord a shout
[50:13] out
[50:13] [Applause]
[50:15] your word
[50:20] [Applause]
[50:22] watch you're not saved because you feel
[50:25] like you're saved
[50:26] if somebody say i know i'm saved because
[50:28] i had a children to me that's not why i
[50:30] am saved satan could whip me around that
[50:32] stump anyway and he can you too upon
[50:35] your feelings that's right but when i
[50:37] walk back and say thus saith the lord my
[50:40] faith is built on the word of god he
[50:42] can't whip that away
[50:44] [Applause]
[50:45] he can beat you on your feelings but he
[50:47] can't beat you on your face
[50:49] [Applause]
[50:50] [Music]
[50:52] [Applause]
[50:55] [Music]
[50:56] because your faith is resting where
[50:59] on the word
[51:02] and he cannot defeat that
[51:08] you're feeling up you're feeling down
[51:10] you're feeling good you're feeling like
[51:11] a christian you're not feeling forget
[51:13] that you don't feel like a christian
[51:14] forget that tell our feelings go
[51:16] somewhere else
[51:17] you're a christian because god said so
[51:18] you're a christian because god called
[51:20] you your christian because god put your
[51:21] name on the book and you see your name
[51:23] like john and you're shouting and you're
[51:25] worshiping
[51:26] [Applause]
[51:31] it's not fearless though this is
[51:32] believers though this
[51:35] [Applause]
[51:43] now listen let's continue remember
[51:45] remember jesus had all the qualities of
[51:47] the father in him
[51:49] do you believe that
[51:50] he sure did all the final gifts of god
[51:53] was in christ
[51:54] he was the offspring of god but notice
[51:57] when he met satan now i guess not
[51:59] different parts of the message so i will
[52:00] put it together like this i find
[52:02] something repetitive but there's some
[52:03] key things inside there i want you to
[52:05] get all right that's why i'm seeing it
[52:07] back
[52:07] but watch
[52:09] but but when he met satan for you
[52:11] for your example he never used one gift
[52:14] on him
[52:15] when satan came he says it's written and
[52:18] he was quoting deuteronomy 7 19 7 14 to
[52:20] believe on the psalms man shall live by
[52:23] bread alone so what jesus does quote in
[52:24] the word you know
[52:25] jesus wasn't just or not you know he's
[52:27] eternally stolen the bread jesus gave
[52:29] him a scripture man shall live like
[52:31] bread alone but but by every word i
[52:33] proceeded under the mouth of god satan
[52:35] don't know who he talking to he talking
[52:37] to a bible believing quote and christian
[52:38] okay the lord i shout
[52:40] come on now come on now satan don't know
[52:43] each other
[52:44] he is talking to a bible believing quote
[52:46] christian
[52:47] [Applause]
[52:49] so jesus was floating on the coats
[52:51] he was floating on the scriptures he
[52:53] went giving back to it and the word
[52:57] manchester united alone but descriptors
[52:59] say that so i'm not arguing with you
[53:08] satan quoted up in a pinnacle again it
[53:11] is written
[53:12] so satan reckons jesus in the wood now
[53:14] so he had to go scripted to us we in
[53:15] this day we brethren no not so far
[53:23] the scripture says
[53:25] i mean give a displainer because i still
[53:27] know who you are
[53:28] because on my file i kind of record of
[53:30] this performance
[53:31] i catch noah drunk i catch david in this
[53:34] i catch all the emperors in that i can't
[53:36] catch this man at all
[53:37] there's only three tests to give the man
[53:39] is money popularity a woman his lust of
[53:42] the eyes the last of the facial pride of
[53:43] life
[53:44] you must get questioned one day
[53:46] in the morning one one them have to hit
[53:49] him
[53:51] because he's a specialist you know he
[53:52] know
[53:54] the art
[53:58] [Music]
[54:04] knowledge of the principles of life
[54:06] that's what satan had
[54:09] you understand no tree formed thing lust
[54:11] of the eyes lust of the flesh pride of
[54:13] life so that why jesus had to bust that
[54:16] and destroy that and show the devil here
[54:19] power over himself
[54:20] now he fit to rule
[54:22] because he proved me of character
[54:25] there was nothing in him that he could
[54:26] hold on to
[54:28] couldn't pull him with temptation
[54:29] couldn't pull him here and pull him here
[54:30] because he was clean on the inside
[54:32] from all unbelief
[54:35] a life of faith was inside of him faith
[54:37] was flowing through him that's why he
[54:39] said peter come
[54:41] and you come
[54:43] it's faith talking you know
[54:44] and then fellas responding because they
[54:46] are seeds of god
[54:47] they don't know yet who they are
[54:49] they just fall in a man with a beard you
[54:51] tell them come i will make you fishes of
[54:53] men
[54:54] and then drop the lessons out of the
[54:55] following
[54:56] you see parents say no god if only
[54:58] fortunately business was all about women
[55:01] i know spreading my net building
[55:02] business and they're both building
[55:03] business and i'm a fishing business and
[55:05] all of a sudden things crash because my
[55:07] sons fall in that man with that beard
[55:10] preaching about the kingdom of god
[55:13] hallelujah let's continue now
[55:16] get it but i want to get notice here it
[55:18] is i want you to see it and get it now
[55:21] the word of god the written word of god
[55:25] will defeat satan
[55:27] anywhere
[55:28] any place
[55:30] any time
[55:31] it is written there it is listen this is
[55:34] part i want to get here everybody
[55:36] wouldn't have gifts
[55:38] [Music]
[55:42] so jesus brought it down to a place
[55:45] where those who do not have gifts
[55:48] that to do
[55:50] that do not have very much faith could
[55:52] say it is written
[55:54] [Applause]
[55:56] everybody don't have gifts
[55:59] so jesus brought it to a place where
[56:01] those with all gifts
[56:03] because it is written
[56:05] it is written
[56:06] i don't need a gift to say that
[56:08] i just need to say it
[56:11] i am the lord thy god of healthy of all
[56:13] eye diseases it is written
[56:16] i will never leave you and forsake you
[56:18] but i'll be with you even in you it is
[56:20] written
[56:21] oh glory to god i shall be filled i
[56:23] shall be see speak it down must prophesy
[56:25] again
[56:28] [Applause]
[56:29] [Music]
[56:37] [Music]
[56:40] thank you
[56:50] there was a little woman in germany
[56:52] about a year or two ago
[56:54] she had translated on the back the
[56:56] translator did in english i could read
[56:58] it she had been crippling a wheelchair
[56:59] for 15 years
[57:02] and she got this she read how she must
[57:04] call the pastor there's no pastor called
[57:05] some christian didn't confess everything
[57:07] that she had everything that she had
[57:08] done wrong and make it right with god
[57:10] and then lay that over her heart
[57:13] and pin it on her underneath garment and
[57:15] then her feet
[57:17] so when she got all this done her pasta
[57:18] was there she put it in her heart she
[57:20] said now
[57:21] old man devil
[57:23] you have had me long enough
[57:25] get away
[57:26] and up she got and when walking
[57:30] that is how simple it was
[57:32] perfectly healed normal it is just your
[57:36] simple fate in believing
[57:37] people try to make fear too complicated
[57:40] it is not complicated it's a simple
[57:43] child like fate you know the blood in
[57:45] the old testament was applied by hyssop
[57:47] you heard that so many times you know
[57:49] what hyster is just common weeds you
[57:51] find it anywhere in egypt it grows out a
[57:54] cracks in the building where the wind
[57:56] packed the seed they get it a little
[57:58] diamond shaped believe hyssop is common
[58:01] so what does that mean you don't have to
[58:03] have a super faith to apply the blood of
[58:04] jesus
[58:06] just common feed believe it that's all
[58:10] [Music]
[58:11] amen
[58:12] hallelujah
[58:14] let's see if we can hit the home stretch
[58:15] here wow
[58:17] from perfect strength brother branham
[58:19] read this scripture where god told paul
[58:22] my grace is sufficient for thee for my
[58:24] strength to smite perfect and weakness
[58:27] and he said
[58:28] for my strength is made perfect and
[58:30] weakness and he says now he said no this
[58:32] is unusual text
[58:34] and this takes some weakness because we
[58:36] are always testifying we are so strong
[58:38] we try to make our weaknesses excuses we
[58:41] want to tell how big we are how great we
[58:44] are and i think that's one of the things
[58:46] that god gave me this text for
[58:48] was to get that out of our mind
[58:51] the little things that we do and what we
[58:53] come to teach for is to find out where
[58:55] our faults is
[58:57] and the things we might better ourselves
[58:59] if we would come to church for any
[59:01] objective i'm afraid we won't get too
[59:02] much out of coming to church we must
[59:04] come to find our weaknesses find our bad
[59:07] places house to see how little we are
[59:10] and put up a trust in somebody that is
[59:12] strong
[59:13] but so there are so many of us like to
[59:15] testify or like to think we are
[59:18] insufficient therefore we make it an
[59:20] excuse i have no education i have
[59:22] mobility i'm unable to do this and if
[59:24] you keep that up and do that in that way
[59:26] keep going like that then you can't
[59:28] among anything but the very thing that
[59:30] we make excuses by our weakness god uses
[59:33] that very thing to tackle the job with
[59:37] he waits for us to get in that condition
[59:41] so he can use us
[59:42] we take the excuses and say well i can't
[59:44] do this i'm insufficient i can't do this
[59:46] and god takes that very thing to do job
[59:48] it's true and the reason why he chooses
[59:51] us is because we're in that condition
[59:53] now that sounds strange just a few
[59:55] minutes we get to god's willing we find
[59:58] out that those people who are the
[1:00:00] weakest and the rejected by the outside
[1:00:02] world is god heroes
[1:00:04] that are conquerors in the front line
[1:00:06] take those who are feeling themselves
[1:00:08] unworthy and as i said that i remember
[1:00:11] when but i was preaching with the seals
[1:00:12] and unfolding the wood and so on he said
[1:00:14] when the voice said the lion or the
[1:00:16] child but judah had prevailed and you
[1:00:18] know where that was
[1:00:19] in the garden of gethsemane
[1:00:22] so it sounds dramatic the land of the
[1:00:24] time but judah has prevailed to oops the
[1:00:26] seven seals that time jesus bought in
[1:00:28] fire every possibility his compass
[1:00:30] jesus battling in the garden of
[1:00:31] gethsemane hallelujah to take the full
[1:00:33] mantle to go to calvary and when he
[1:00:36] overcome his human spirit and the choice
[1:00:38] of will and the battle with his inhuman
[1:00:40] will and you overcome that and you
[1:00:42] recognize that he's going forward he
[1:00:43] overcame right there
[1:00:45] that was the lion oh hallelujah praise
[1:00:48] god so you see what god called great god
[1:00:50] you mean what what man called great god
[1:00:52] called foolish and what god man called
[1:00:54] foolish god called great oh hallelujah
[1:00:57] praise god amen people are laughing at
[1:00:59] samson and god drop something like this
[1:01:01] behind me enemy line because god going
[1:01:03] to allow samson now in that condition to
[1:01:05] be in the right place to be led by a
[1:01:07] little boy hallelujah praise god he is
[1:01:09] weak now his eyes are out are he going
[1:01:11] and destroy muffler sign that he evident
[1:01:13] in his life
[1:01:14] oh he gonna bring a great victory to
[1:01:16] give god glory he couldn't do that when
[1:01:18] he was all alone in his power and his
[1:01:19] strength no god had to let him pass
[1:01:21] through this whole delilah routine and
[1:01:23] set him up in such a way to bring honor
[1:01:25] and glory to god oh in his weakness god
[1:01:28] brings strength inside of him to make
[1:01:30] manifestos for his glory
[1:01:32] oh glory to god there by some say once
[1:01:34] more lord they have no right to take on
[1:01:36] my eyes and venge him in my eyes once
[1:01:38] more lord oh glory to god he had it
[1:01:41] before he could have it again oh glory
[1:01:43] to god once more and we had this before
[1:01:46] what are we talking about we're not
[1:01:47] going back to something we never had we
[1:01:48] had it in the garden of eden when
[1:01:50] godzilla's man he was talking about us
[1:01:52] oh give the lord a show
[1:01:59] did you get that
[1:02:00] when god said let us make man he was
[1:02:02] talking about
[1:02:08] yeah big man that was us
[1:02:10] but the man that god put there to unfold
[1:02:12] us he fell
[1:02:14] so god had to go and reboot and start it
[1:02:16] another way
[1:02:17] understand this adam was supposed to
[1:02:19] speak for us because adam had the names
[1:02:21] adam had the book so he was the speaker
[1:02:23] for us to come forward but when adam
[1:02:25] said the book went back and he had the
[1:02:26] original owner so the names that were
[1:02:28] seated in adam hallelujah was a mystery
[1:02:35] those believers they didn't know what it
[1:02:36] was living out
[1:02:38] abraham was a mystery
[1:02:39] all of them says was mysteries
[1:02:42] and the book was calling them with all
[1:02:43] them knowing they're being called
[1:02:45] they were only staggering out of this
[1:02:47] and staggering into that staggering out
[1:02:48] of this even joseph said don't leave my
[1:02:51] bones here
[1:02:52] [Music]
[1:02:54] because i know where that power coming i
[1:02:56] know where the messiah coming he coming
[1:02:58] in the promised land don't leave my
[1:02:59] bones here make me a pledge when you
[1:03:01] leave here that if when you leave here
[1:03:03] take my bones with you
[1:03:06] they have no resurrection coming power
[1:03:08] coming they know the nurse is dying and
[1:03:10] just to be dead and done no
[1:03:12] even job all this book
[1:03:14] he said i know my redeemer
[1:03:19] christ said die on the cross yet drove
[1:03:20] by inspiration he said i know and how
[1:03:23] did he know that
[1:03:24] how did he come to revelation
[1:03:26] when he was scripting boys it's not when
[1:03:29] job was intact and everything was fine
[1:03:31] it's in his weakness
[1:03:33] god brings strength into him to see the
[1:03:35] resurrection to see hundreds of years
[1:03:38] down the road he said i know you come in
[1:03:40] the community community coming i know my
[1:03:42] redeemer limits and in this flesh
[1:03:44] oh those are skin worms come on now come
[1:03:46] on now do the skin worms destroy this
[1:03:49] body yet in my flesh i shall see god
[1:03:53] so his crippled condition
[1:03:55] his is
[1:03:57] in his body's condition that didn't stop
[1:03:59] him from seeing glory
[1:04:01] seeing me with the eyes of fate that's
[1:04:03] what sun's about is a journey god took
[1:04:05] job from being on top
[1:04:07] everything's secure
[1:04:09] family fine everything a hedge around
[1:04:11] him not even the devil touching job
[1:04:14] god had to invite the devil to look at
[1:04:15] you he said look at this man that is my
[1:04:17] man on the earth there's not one on the
[1:04:19] other like him that man living out
[1:04:21] something
[1:04:22] jesus said said give me a chance because
[1:04:24] i see a hedge him wrong he said you
[1:04:25] think it's that
[1:04:27] do you think it's his wealth and what
[1:04:28] protector wrong him of himself no it's
[1:04:30] not what are wrong him it's what in him
[1:04:32] he didn't tell the devil that but god
[1:04:34] knows what in him that man so when
[1:04:36] something inner man you could lose
[1:04:37] anything you want around that one
[1:04:42] god put a faith in that man are you
[1:04:44] touching that faith you challenging god
[1:04:46] himself you think this faith we're
[1:04:47] talking about in our own faith it's the
[1:04:49] faith of god inside of you
[1:04:51] by faith abraham by faith
[1:04:54] by faith gideon oh glory to god god knew
[1:04:58] he didn't had it in him
[1:05:00] gideon didn't know it but god knew it oh
[1:05:03] i feel i shouted tonight
[1:05:05] that's why he called again a mighty man
[1:05:08] [Applause]
[1:05:12] a man
[1:05:13] i found my boy
[1:05:15] what's my shoulder boy
[1:05:17] think about another swords man of the
[1:05:18] train soldier and got some mighty man of
[1:05:20] allah
[1:05:24] let's go talking to him
[1:05:26] look and say who was in the room
[1:05:27] when you reckon he alone me
[1:05:30] you serious
[1:05:32] yeah i'm dead serious
[1:05:35] mighty man
[1:05:36] no he's not seeing that
[1:05:38] but what's he in faith
[1:05:40] oh hallelujah see when god see faith man
[1:05:42] understand your works
[1:05:46] and your words could express the faith
[1:05:49] that god's people can't see your faith
[1:05:50] you know they have to see your works
[1:05:52] you could talk talk to a fake all your
[1:05:54] mouth you could talk faith but when the
[1:05:55] ceo works they will know that his fate
[1:05:57] in operation
[1:05:58] so before enoch was translated he had a
[1:06:00] testimony
[1:06:01] that he pleased god
[1:06:03] you can't see your faith but this life
[1:06:06] of pleasing god was evident amen that
[1:06:08] god is with this man
[1:06:10] and he
[1:06:12] here we go
[1:06:13] pressure
[1:06:15] over time
[1:06:16] as a formula bring changes
[1:06:18] he is a rewarder
[1:06:21] of them
[1:06:23] that seek him
[1:06:24] no
[1:06:26] no no not seek him because you could
[1:06:28] seek him hey one lord lord i want to
[1:06:30] seek you i want to see your face
[1:06:31] all right until next week
[1:06:33] and then you can tell people you apply
[1:06:35] to see them
[1:06:37] that's not what you're talking about
[1:06:38] them that
[1:06:40] dinogenicly
[1:06:42] energetically
[1:06:44] enthusiastically passionately
[1:06:47] pressure
[1:06:50] over time
[1:06:51] bring a rewarding result
[1:06:54] oh glory to god you have to have an
[1:06:56] attitude
[1:06:57] oh glory to god you have to get it if
[1:06:59] you don't have it you have to get it
[1:07:00] started tonight
[1:07:02] oh glory don't go you can't just listen
[1:07:05] if you rub any cutlass or a knife
[1:07:07] against his own soul
[1:07:09] you could be hold and do nothing
[1:07:11] because there's no pressure
[1:07:13] just rubbing the kill in time
[1:07:14] it's sharpening
[1:07:18] you're cold
[1:07:20] you're four months
[1:07:22] you'll look one way you're sharpening
[1:07:23] and you're in church
[1:07:25] i praise now and again
[1:07:26] i
[1:07:39] nothing happening with you
[1:07:41] there's no change
[1:07:43] but when you start to press i have to
[1:07:44] take the cutters and press
[1:07:47] you see
[1:07:48] that action you see only rust at the
[1:07:50] edge
[1:07:51] is that i guess silver
[1:07:52] because i want a blade
[1:07:54] i'll go are going uncut
[1:07:56] i want to cut clean
[1:07:58] i want a good shot
[1:07:59] if it's not sharp you have to put more
[1:08:01] pressure to cut down the grass and they
[1:08:03] cut down the trees and whatnot but we
[1:08:04] never shower blade it's swish wash
[1:08:06] wait till them seven turns until that
[1:08:09] they're going to slice and cut
[1:08:11] so right now them thunders go bring a
[1:08:12] sharp blade
[1:08:14] when you're sliced and cut in this clean
[1:08:15] cut
[1:08:16] glass head cutting clean off let me tell
[1:08:19] you guys where can i clean off
[1:08:21] finish
[1:08:24] glory hallelujah
[1:08:26] oh glory hallelujah the sons of god will
[1:08:28] get the sword of the word of the same
[1:08:30] soul they have the same way they have
[1:08:32] take it and cut up
[1:08:35] oh glory to god
[1:08:37] listen man could just step forward and
[1:08:39] bring this with alive
[1:08:41] the same when people reading dead
[1:08:42] they're dead struggling with them words
[1:08:44] it will just come alive that's what
[1:08:45] brother bradham did
[1:08:47] he just came out of nowhere and make
[1:08:49] that word begin to live and he
[1:08:51] challenged other ministers to come
[1:08:52] forward with signs and one of the
[1:08:54] miracles but he stepped out because the
[1:08:56] voice said or stunned the baptist will
[1:08:57] send the foreign the first coming of
[1:08:59] christ you have a messenger foreign my
[1:09:01] second coming of christ
[1:09:03] god give him a message oh glory to god
[1:09:05] and before that message thundered he had
[1:09:07] was three pulls three stages three
[1:09:09] phases the first ball of second point
[1:09:12] oh hallelujah
[1:09:13] a healing ministry to catch the people
[1:09:16] that have confidence god is with this
[1:09:17] man but the message will come in and
[1:09:19] have healing ministry he going to
[1:09:21] baptist methodist pentecost for
[1:09:22] everybody they love him they have them
[1:09:24] rigged revivals the churches falling up
[1:09:25] big tent meeting and showing like that
[1:09:27] and afterwards as he gets a little
[1:09:28] message they start to pull back
[1:09:30] hallelujah because they can't take the
[1:09:32] word
[1:09:32] why because they were always shocked to
[1:09:34] begin with
[1:09:35] god waiting for your generation got the
[1:09:37] ring to pick you up to be the
[1:09:38] continuation of the book of the
[1:09:39] generation of jesus christ
[1:09:41] god knew the pentecostal was going to be
[1:09:43] shocked god as part of the cruel process
[1:09:45] of the planned life
[1:09:46] hallelujah but after the shocking will
[1:09:48] be seen so god is waiting on you so you
[1:09:51] are the people that god was backing up
[1:09:53] you are the people that god was voting
[1:09:54] for you are the people that god was
[1:09:56] talking about
[1:10:02] hallelujah
[1:10:03] all the others were just stages
[1:10:06] of the black life
[1:10:07] but this is the recovery of the life and
[1:10:09] gardener together in the seed
[1:10:11] and at the end of time all the life is
[1:10:13] drawn into the seed
[1:10:15] and the shock is dead
[1:10:17] the
[1:10:18] tree is dead everything else is dead
[1:10:19] this all the life is in the seed
[1:10:22] after all the life could be in the bride
[1:10:24] and she would have the quickness power
[1:10:26] and the magnetism of the holy ghost
[1:10:29] going to be in that seed and the seed
[1:10:31] going to be in you so when that great
[1:10:33] mighty magnet come over that seed you
[1:10:35] must go
[1:10:37] because the rapture going to be in you
[1:10:40] so you bite that fight into when you're
[1:10:42] up to you know the bride will be in the
[1:10:43] rapture because the rapture going to be
[1:10:45] in the bride that fate was an enoch
[1:10:48] oh glory to god hallelujah
[1:10:51] he couldn't share that faith with his
[1:10:52] wife
[1:10:53] there's nothing sponge cake you know
[1:10:56] get your wife half and you get half
[1:10:57] that's not that thing
[1:10:59] nobody's not that
[1:11:01] this has to be in you
[1:11:02] you can't share it
[1:11:04] enoch had a testimony please god and one
[1:11:06] day he was walking he got lighter and
[1:11:08] lighter and lighter and then he took off
[1:11:10] let me finish
[1:11:13] [Music]
[1:11:18] [Music]
[1:11:20] practically every hero god ever had
[1:11:24] on the front line was that type of
[1:11:26] person
[1:11:27] a person that was rejected a person that
[1:11:29] thought he was insufficient a person
[1:11:31] that had nobility at all
[1:11:33] then that's the person in the good shape
[1:11:35] so god could start using them
[1:11:38] when they feel like they can't they
[1:11:40] haven't got nothing that's when god
[1:11:41] start the whole of them
[1:11:43] and do something with them
[1:11:44] when we are thinking that we are able to
[1:11:46] do it then god can't use it because we
[1:11:47] are wanting to do it ourselves yes see
[1:11:51] and then we get the feelings now on the
[1:11:53] other side we're insufficient we don't
[1:11:55] want to do it then if we just listen to
[1:11:56] the call of god that's the very thing
[1:11:58] that god wants us to do
[1:12:00] the kind of shape that so he can when
[1:12:02] there we go here we go
[1:12:04] what all this weakness is about what all
[1:12:06] this talking about listen to this part
[1:12:08] when we are insufficient ourselves
[1:12:12] then we are subjects to yield to god's
[1:12:14] spirit
[1:12:16] so sometimes go layer on your run until
[1:12:19] you feel and flop because you run in
[1:12:20] your run you're doing your do
[1:12:22] and when you recognize you can't do it
[1:12:25] then you give room over here to do it
[1:12:28] because you try and you fail
[1:12:30] you try and it didn't work out you put
[1:12:32] your best foot forward and it still
[1:12:34] wasn't good enough god don't want your
[1:12:36] best foot forward he wants your foot to
[1:12:38] be out of it all together
[1:12:39] he wants you to give room that he could
[1:12:41] step in to show you with the boss
[1:12:43] and it's not by your might or power but
[1:12:44] by his spirit i want his spirit come
[1:12:46] upon your life then that's what happened
[1:12:48] to
[1:12:49] samson the spirit of walking up on
[1:12:50] samson happened to david spirit walking
[1:12:52] up on david all them guys who spirited
[1:12:54] walking upon them and they did this and
[1:12:55] did this and afterwards they felt it was
[1:12:56] the flesh and all kind of but the spirit
[1:12:58] would come upon them and this was
[1:12:59] accomplished
[1:13:00] so in this age god put the word in the
[1:13:02] bride to use the word in the bride
[1:13:04] because the spirit came upon the
[1:13:05] pentecostal and was a whole disaster and
[1:13:07] a mess
[1:13:08] so god did not do that again he not
[1:13:11] anointed flesh he announced in a word
[1:13:13] so that's why it take all these years to
[1:13:15] get this word in the bride you said the
[1:13:18] word is being preached
[1:13:19] so god ordained that this word is
[1:13:21] preached to get inside of you
[1:13:23] no you have to know it is inside of you
[1:13:25] you have to believe it inside of you
[1:13:27] that's what faith is about
[1:13:29] inside of you
[1:13:32] [Music]
[1:13:34] faith is something that reveals you that
[1:13:36] is not yet but you know it will be
[1:13:39] so you have a revelation but you're not
[1:13:41] ripe in an experience yet
[1:13:43] you're right and you're getting
[1:13:44] revelation but you don't have the
[1:13:45] experience of it yet that is faith
[1:13:48] oh glory to god so when god dropped
[1:13:50] isaac on abraham he had a revelation
[1:13:53] he couldn't give it to sarah as far
[1:13:55] sarah is concerned she is barren
[1:13:57] she can't have no child she's past
[1:13:59] childbearing age so don't talk that talk
[1:14:00] to me
[1:14:01] but as far as abraham concerned here
[1:14:06] do you see that
[1:14:08] isaac is not manifest yet it's in his
[1:14:10] fate
[1:14:10] it's in the seat inside of him he have
[1:14:12] to testify to syria god said so
[1:14:15] because sarah is the womb that he going
[1:14:16] to use to make this seed in abraham
[1:14:18] heart manifest so he can divorce hero he
[1:14:21] got drunk sarah he can't give up sarah
[1:14:24] he got somebody to kidnap sarah sarah
[1:14:26] can stay right there whatever condition
[1:14:28] she's in however crunchy cranky she is
[1:14:31] that is the woman that gonna be used by
[1:14:33] god to produce this child call isa and
[1:14:36] if you believe isaac coming here the
[1:14:37] military will be changed
[1:14:39] so it will take some pressure it will
[1:14:41] take some time
[1:14:42] it will take 25 years
[1:14:43] [Laughter]
[1:14:47] but that change coming
[1:14:49] i will return unto thee
[1:14:51] according to the time of life
[1:14:52] transformation is coming change is
[1:14:55] coming it will take some pressure it
[1:14:57] will take some time
[1:14:59] [Applause]
[1:15:04] oh glory
[1:15:06] glory to god amen
[1:15:12] when
[1:15:14] we are insufficient ourselves i'm going
[1:15:15] to close
[1:15:16] then we are subjects to yield to god's
[1:15:18] spirit
[1:15:19] as long as we think we can do it we
[1:15:22] can't do it
[1:15:23] but when we get to a place where we know
[1:15:26] we can't do it that's the problem there
[1:15:28] we think we can still do it
[1:15:33] but we have to come to a place it's a
[1:15:34] revolutionary where can we
[1:15:36] where we know we can do it
[1:15:39] then we yield ourselves to god and he
[1:15:42] does it
[1:15:43] so that if it is us trying to do it we
[1:15:46] will feel
[1:15:48] i think i want to read it again
[1:15:50] if it is us trying to do it
[1:15:53] we would fail
[1:15:56] but when we just yield ourselves a god
[1:15:58] then god can fail
[1:16:01] [Music]
[1:16:08] when them guys come with all
[1:16:10] moldy bread
[1:16:12] to joshua
[1:16:14] joshua didn't concern the lord
[1:16:17] they say because of our country oh god
[1:16:20] i think that time is the next place they
[1:16:22] go and conquer
[1:16:24] then they end up saddled with them
[1:16:26] characters for the rest of the time
[1:16:27] because they make a covenant with them
[1:16:29] characters who are supposed to be
[1:16:30] defeated wiped out everything
[1:16:34] yeah
[1:16:35] daddy gave credit to the smart man
[1:16:38] who come with the old clothes revelation
[1:16:42] moly bread become half our country
[1:16:43] there's some bread has some old mole in
[1:16:45] it
[1:16:46] and some old clothes which i will
[1:16:47] fulfill
[1:16:49] god retired
[1:16:52] make me wish
[1:16:57] see
[1:16:58] smack my revolution
[1:17:02] joshua
[1:17:03] but joshua not supposed to make any
[1:17:05] comment whatsoever
[1:17:07] see all these are lessons for us to
[1:17:08] learn
[1:17:09] dollar no smart man come on don't smart
[1:17:11] here you say write them all write them
[1:17:13] out
[1:17:15] put your neck on the king's head put
[1:17:16] your neck and cut them off
[1:17:18] what is that is your land
[1:17:20] better possess this land okay all is
[1:17:22] have a lot of lessons
[1:17:23] [Laughter]
[1:17:27] but when you see the surrender come
[1:17:28] because he got that joshua every place
[1:17:30] you put is yours no man shall be able to
[1:17:32] stand before the days of my life
[1:17:34] otherwise most i would be with thee but
[1:17:36] i didn't shock the people and when men
[1:17:38] said the fall long dead joshua said no
[1:17:39] no no no no no no no no this guy worked
[1:17:41] this car worked this is not how he was
[1:17:42] supposed to be they know what god said
[1:17:44] god can lie
[1:17:46] save things going off key something
[1:17:48] going off key
[1:17:49] because god have to keep his word
[1:17:52] he is god this is land possession time
[1:17:54] moses was drifting from egypt to this
[1:17:56] land the journey was a direct one god
[1:17:59] sent them to the wilderness in order to
[1:18:01] to make sure time and pressure change
[1:18:03] their mind
[1:18:06] but egypt was in the heart
[1:18:08] yes it was a short journey you know but
[1:18:10] god passed them a tough world
[1:18:12] to hope that time
[1:18:14] and pressure will change their mind and
[1:18:16] change a heart
[1:18:17] from them the leaks and onions in egypt
[1:18:20] but it was in their heart
[1:18:22] oh glory to god hallelujah you want them
[1:18:24] cross over and run back
[1:18:26] and afterwards what kyras mania when
[1:18:28] they stumbled there and they said we
[1:18:30] can't take it that was the god had said
[1:18:31] had enough
[1:18:32] that was it that was it
[1:18:34] all that willingness journey god was
[1:18:35] behind with them he could handle that
[1:18:37] but not when you land in front of your
[1:18:39] man
[1:18:41] so could you imagine they reached this
[1:18:42] point this is 2019
[1:18:45] and and doubting god's promises and and
[1:18:47] don't believe you can take it god go
[1:18:48] finish anybody want the question or go
[1:18:50] go finish with them
[1:18:52] we are nearer now than what we first
[1:18:53] believe
[1:18:56] so i am back in long no we never know
[1:18:59] we are well able
[1:19:02] oh glory to god to be part of hebrews 11
[1:19:04] we are well able to be conquered with
[1:19:07] them all and brothers with faith
[1:19:09] we are well able
[1:19:11] don't tell me god god bless you here and
[1:19:13] do this for you here i'll make a way for
[1:19:14] you here and open that door for you here
[1:19:16] and that border was closed that i don't
[1:19:18] have to open
[1:19:19] we will move the door we have to
[1:19:23] remember
[1:19:24] oh glory to god hallelujah
[1:19:27] [Applause]
[1:19:34] you see lack of strength or weakness let
[1:19:36] me talk about that i'm not almost sinful
[1:19:39] weakness but weakness is a lack of faith
[1:19:42] because faith is a victory that
[1:19:44] overcomes the world
[1:19:45] and if you study you you wouldn't go
[1:19:47] very far
[1:19:48] but god brings the word bring bring the
[1:19:50] word now for you to have faith in him
[1:19:53] fit in the word so when you take faith
[1:19:55] in the word this is what this is what
[1:19:57] power in you then
[1:19:59] you see all your cell phones get charged
[1:20:01] up because you will get no calls
[1:20:04] you have to charge up your cell phone
[1:20:05] and some people don't make no mistake
[1:20:07] right if they was reading the bible as
[1:20:08] much as the charger person
[1:20:09] right now forget the church and revival
[1:20:11] right now
[1:20:14] but they don't want to miss the call so
[1:20:15] they had to charge it up
[1:20:22] to effectively function
[1:20:24] when somebody backs it and they lost all
[1:20:26] the charge
[1:20:27] and then the funeral home just called
[1:20:28] them outside afterwards selling a church
[1:20:30] losing charge they're discharging in
[1:20:32] church
[1:20:35] because there's no pressure over time
[1:20:38] that's what prayer does too you know you
[1:20:39] can't say good morning good evening you
[1:20:40] got to take some time
[1:20:42] and stay there with intense elijah a man
[1:20:44] of like passion prayed honestly
[1:20:47] did you hear that kind of prayer
[1:20:49] he just say prayers
[1:20:51] he prayed earnestly that he will not
[1:20:53] reign
[1:20:54] then he prayed again for reign
[1:20:56] so it's an approach
[1:20:58] of desperation
[1:21:00] his approach of illnesses that was just
[1:21:02] the axis shall be given secretly shall
[1:21:04] find knockout shall be opened if
[1:21:06] somebody take that and run and say ask
[1:21:08] yesterday and oh god i get it now and i
[1:21:09] seek and i didn't find and i knocked my
[1:21:11] dog but then he went down further he
[1:21:12] didn't ask it he that seek it he that
[1:21:15] knock it it has to have the condition to
[1:21:18] jive you not just to knock once but to
[1:21:20] keep knocking the door open when you
[1:21:22] understand this door open it where you
[1:21:23] want then you're not stopping this door
[1:21:26] open you want to want to come to go back
[1:21:27] and come to get in
[1:21:29] they come to get your requests made
[1:21:30] known make manifest
[1:21:32] let me see all mine
[1:21:34] [Music]
[1:21:38] remember one thing
[1:21:40] we must master especially young
[1:21:42] preachers and members alike
[1:21:44] there's one thing that you've got to
[1:21:45] master if we expect to fulfill god
[1:21:47] design our life that is we have to
[1:21:49] master the thought of human ability
[1:21:52] if we ever get to a spot where we think
[1:21:55] we can do it with our intelligence
[1:21:57] and our abilities we have got to master
[1:21:59] that in such a way that we can get rid
[1:22:01] of the thing and lay the sight till god
[1:22:03] can use us
[1:22:04] and make a complete surrender we cannot
[1:22:06] use one ability but it's beginning
[1:22:09] we have got to surrender complete
[1:22:10] surrender to come to god you've got to
[1:22:12] surrender him both soul
[1:22:14] body
[1:22:15] and spirit
[1:22:16] everything you are has to be surrendered
[1:22:18] to god in order that he can work his
[1:22:21] will in you and i no that's hard i know
[1:22:24] so he's not saying that is a is an easy
[1:22:26] singing
[1:22:27] that's hard i know
[1:22:29] because we are always wanting to do our
[1:22:32] part in something we know you know we
[1:22:34] want to do it we say well i just know it
[1:22:36] should be done this way but as long as
[1:22:38] you're doing it that way it's going to
[1:22:39] be wrong
[1:22:41] god will never use that effort
[1:22:43] maybe with the help of the lord we're
[1:22:44] going to get into that few minutes to
[1:22:46] show you how god cannot use your ability
[1:22:51] so he put his ability in you and used
[1:22:52] that
[1:22:54] not your own is his ability so we are
[1:22:57] here tonight by the ability of god
[1:22:59] we speak tonight by god's ability
[1:23:01] hallelujah are you with me
[1:23:04] no and what what what no no ability i
[1:23:07] don't care whose it is will never be
[1:23:10] usable in the sight of god god has to
[1:23:12] get all of our abilities out of us
[1:23:14] before we can achieve his purpose so he
[1:23:16] got something for us to do as long as we
[1:23:18] feel we're doing a pretty good job out
[1:23:19] of it then we'll never you people use of
[1:23:21] god
[1:23:22] what good did he do nothing he said it
[1:23:24] what
[1:23:24] so what then god can achieve his purpose
[1:23:26] by sending not a revival
[1:23:29] he needs to send a killing
[1:23:31] so we can revive
[1:23:33] you need to die before you can be born
[1:23:36] again
[1:23:37] he needs a killing of ourselves this
[1:23:39] tabernacle needs a killing on me with it
[1:23:42] all of us we need a killing so we can be
[1:23:45] revived to a new life to a new whole to
[1:23:48] a new hope to our new experience we
[1:23:50] first need a day of mourning
[1:23:53] that's how we call it a day of mourning
[1:23:55] we need a place of yielding to the
[1:23:57] spirit instead so much and depends upon
[1:23:59] schooling upon programs or campaigns and
[1:24:02] and rely upon so many ministers to
[1:24:04] cooperate we allow so many if we can't
[1:24:06] get some money we won't do it we won't
[1:24:07] go into the cities without that he said
[1:24:10] we've got to get away from that that is
[1:24:12] human ability
[1:24:14] you want the ability of man and fight
[1:24:15] for when man go contrary to the leader
[1:24:17] of this fight folk young he said he put
[1:24:19] a modifier
[1:24:20] so he had today a man we fight for
[1:24:22] tomorrow he's no fall
[1:24:24] he's already full
[1:24:26] because the bishop the head bishop
[1:24:28] kicked the and immediately
[1:24:30] that person was a soldier fight for
[1:24:32] minister he's now a fallen angel
[1:24:36] fall from where
[1:24:37] from a man's sister
[1:24:39] immediately becomes a fallen ninja
[1:24:42] oh hallelujah that is when man appointed
[1:24:46] and then man get disappointed he must
[1:24:47] get disappointed in mana point but when
[1:24:49] god appoint there's no disappoint
[1:24:52] when god appoint a man nobody could
[1:24:54] unappoint him
[1:24:55] but when man appoint there's a different
[1:24:57] thing about it you're looking for
[1:24:58] disappointment that's how you have to
[1:24:59] seek the lord
[1:25:01] you have to hear from god
[1:25:02] god have to speak to you
[1:25:04] oh hallelujah
[1:25:06] let me let me see now watch
[1:25:08] he says so we have got together from
[1:25:09] human ability we got to get to a place
[1:25:11] that we can surrender our souls and
[1:25:12] lives even to the housewife so we know
[1:25:15] what pastor and deacon and elder
[1:25:16] housewife farmer mechanic whoever we are
[1:25:19] we gotta surrender completely to god
[1:25:21] that we are nothing then god can start
[1:25:23] using us and he said that includes all
[1:25:25] of us everyone that's the thing we got
[1:25:27] to do history proves
[1:25:29] history does that god always choose that
[1:25:31] nobody is to becoming somebodies
[1:25:33] god takes a person that is nothing and i
[1:25:36] hope this gets done deep to us both here
[1:25:37] and in people too that you realize that
[1:25:40] you've got to become nothing none of
[1:25:41] them know it all not a great somebody
[1:25:43] but a nobody and you've got to come to
[1:25:45] dust and you've got to come to a place
[1:25:47] where you know you're nothing and don't
[1:25:48] ever rise above that as soon as you rise
[1:25:50] above it you rise above god
[1:25:52] you've got to keep yourself in the dust
[1:25:53] could imagine people saying i am the
[1:25:55] holy ghost look he's sitting here you're
[1:25:56] staying he does he rise above god
[1:25:58] man playing god
[1:26:00] hallelujah praise god you got to keep
[1:26:02] yourself in the dust on the road to
[1:26:04] damascus you got to keep yourself off
[1:26:05] your high horses that's for everywhere
[1:26:08] here and in the table i often said the
[1:26:10] greatest enemy i've got is william
[1:26:11] branham he's the one that gets in god's
[1:26:13] way he's the one that gets lazy he's the
[1:26:14] one that gets to a place sometimes where
[1:26:16] he thinks he can do something about it
[1:26:17] and when he does that shows god right
[1:26:19] out the picture when i can get rid of
[1:26:20] that guy then i can get to a place that
[1:26:23] he's out of the way and god can come
[1:26:25] over and do things that william branham
[1:26:27] knows nothing about
[1:26:30] hallelujah
[1:26:31] glory to god so god passes nobles and
[1:26:34] get weakness god passes those who think
[1:26:36] they are something to take somebody that
[1:26:38] knows nothing in order to work his
[1:26:40] purpose in their life god said to paul
[1:26:42] my strength is made perfect in your
[1:26:44] weakness
[1:26:45] oh my i'm going to skip you
[1:26:47] if we ever get to happen let me say let
[1:26:49] something to console you i'm going to
[1:26:50] close
[1:26:51] here is something that encourages us
[1:26:54] are you ready
[1:26:56] out of weakness and humility
[1:26:58] god chooses
[1:27:00] the people
[1:27:02] to build his kingdom out of
[1:27:06] if we ever get to heaven if we ever
[1:27:08] stand in the presence of god with his
[1:27:10] church we will stand in a bunch of
[1:27:12] people that's been weak
[1:27:14] and rejected and casted by the world
[1:27:17] and knows nothing
[1:27:19] i'm going to close i want to read a
[1:27:21] scripture
[1:27:22] and this is from
[1:27:24] okay
[1:27:25] and it kept the past when david and his
[1:27:27] men would come to ziglag
[1:27:29] and until the day that the americas had
[1:27:31] invaded the salt and ziglag had smitten
[1:27:33] ziglag and brunei with fire
[1:27:36] for taking the woman captive and were
[1:27:37] therein they soon not any either great
[1:27:40] or small but carried them away and went
[1:27:42] on their way
[1:27:44] so david and his men came to the city
[1:27:46] and behold he was born with fire
[1:27:48] and their wives and their sons and their
[1:27:50] daughters were taken captives
[1:27:57] and then david
[1:27:59] and the people that were with him lift
[1:28:00] up their voice and wept
[1:28:02] until they had no more power to weep
[1:28:05] so this is this is depression
[1:28:08] on steroids
[1:28:10] they weep till they have no more tears
[1:28:12] to weep
[1:28:13] they're doing the lord's business
[1:28:16] and come to see their wives taken away
[1:28:19] the city pillaged
[1:28:25] so then david and the people that were
[1:28:27] with him lift up their voice and wept
[1:28:28] until there was no more power to weep
[1:28:30] and they were two wives were taken into
[1:28:32] captives
[1:28:34] his israelites and abigail the wife of
[1:28:36] nabal the camelite
[1:28:37] and david was greatly distressed
[1:28:40] for the people
[1:28:41] speak of stoning him
[1:28:44] because the soul of all the people was
[1:28:47] grieved
[1:28:48] just imagine he taught him to stone
[1:28:50] david
[1:28:51] that's how upset people are now
[1:28:53] he's the pastor he's the leader he's he
[1:28:55] does he's he's that he's a champion i
[1:28:57] think and look all his children gone his
[1:28:59] wife gone family gone
[1:29:03] every man for his sons and for his
[1:29:04] daughters
[1:29:06] but okay but he called the soul of the
[1:29:08] people will grieve every man for his
[1:29:10] sons and his daughters but david
[1:29:11] encouraged himself
[1:29:14] in the lord and this is what faith does
[1:29:17] this is what a life of faith does
[1:29:19] every body depressed
[1:29:22] and is a legal depression
[1:29:24] it's not like if god did prayers no
[1:29:26] we all serve in the lord and look what
[1:29:28] the devil come and do and look what
[1:29:30] happened
[1:29:31] and everybody around david is in this
[1:29:33] mood and david encouraged himself in the
[1:29:35] lord
[1:29:38] he's god i like that but david
[1:29:40] encouraged himself in the lord his god
[1:29:43] and david said to abhiya the priests
[1:29:45] i'm america's son i pray that he bring
[1:29:47] me here to the ephod
[1:29:49] and he brought him here the fought the
[1:29:51] david and david inquired of the lord
[1:29:53] shall i pursue after the troop
[1:29:56] shall i overtake them
[1:29:57] and he answered them pursue for those
[1:29:59] shall surely overtake them
[1:30:02] and without fail
[1:30:04] recover all
[1:30:07] here it is
[1:30:08] the family is captured
[1:30:10] here it is everybody around us depressed
[1:30:13] crying considering to stone david what a
[1:30:16] terrible hour for him to be in yes sir
[1:30:18] there's no support
[1:30:21] depression around david he has no
[1:30:22] support
[1:30:23] the bible says he encouraged himself
[1:30:26] [Music]
[1:30:28] and he asked the priest to bring on the
[1:30:30] e-pod
[1:30:31] to seek the lord
[1:30:32] and he asks god one question
[1:30:35] shall i continue and mope and mourn no
[1:30:38] shall i push you
[1:30:40] go after them or not god say go and
[1:30:42] overtake them
[1:30:44] and you're going and recover all
[1:30:46] listen listen
[1:30:49] if david was in the mood
[1:30:52] that them weepers was in
[1:30:55] to weep with them and to be in that
[1:30:57] spirit
[1:30:58] he would not be strength to pursue
[1:31:01] but by faith
[1:31:03] david
[1:31:04] when everybody else was crying
[1:31:06] ask of the lord
[1:31:08] if he should go after what it rightfully
[1:31:10] is
[1:31:11] and god told him pursue
[1:31:14] and david jump on his horse with some
[1:31:16] few men and ride all night long
[1:31:19] and go they bust themselves and bring
[1:31:21] back everybody
[1:31:22] he got every single one
[1:31:25] was restored
[1:31:27] time and pressure
[1:31:28] just bring change
[1:31:30] it took time to pursue
[1:31:32] it took time to ride to get to where it
[1:31:34] was going but when he pursued he got
[1:31:37] there he brought back all that he was
[1:31:39] supposed to bring back
[1:31:40] come on church
[1:31:42] this fate was lost for seven ages
[1:31:46] god was patient to wait for this last
[1:31:48] hour to send malachi 4 to turn all us
[1:31:51] back to the faith of the fathers we will
[1:31:53] rise up
[1:31:55] we will push you
[1:31:56] we going to have that faith
