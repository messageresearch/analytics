love and fellowship amen so god bless you hallelujah mark chapter 16 reading from verse 15 to 18 and he said unto them go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be down and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out devils we shall speak with new towns they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover god bless and good afternoon to each and every one of you who are looking at us on vote on virtual the virtual convention my name is brother timothy redhead from the island of grenada west indies the theme of the convention my understanding is manifestation of the sons of god as they were back in eden and the inspiration is the ministry of the bride and the ministry of christ are the same ministry brothers and sisters the team is defined as a subject of a talk or a sermon and inspiration is defined as the process of being mentally stimulated to do or to feel something creative and it is also timely it also means something that makes someone want to do something or give them an idea in other words it's stimulate one to act in this case we carry over the thought to manifest the terms at the one where this ministry is to be identified i i just read mark 16 15 to 18 and these are the things that you are expecting in the ministry of sons of manifested sons and daughters of god we look far and wide today to try to identify where this ministry of christ with its signs and wonders are being demonstrated as in the book of acts and as in mark and after looking around i see much of the same eloquent words great emotions but hardly signs of that type of manifestation as it was in mark as it was in eden when adam give names to all the creatures of god brother paul i salute you for embarking upon such an excellent team this journey that is being spearheaded by anointed ordained sons of god but before we go forward i want you to just join me as we take a little trip imagine this scenario you're about to fly from cote d'ivoire to the caribbean and upon boarding the plane on its way to take off the intercom buzz alive with this announcement ladies and gentlemen welcome to flight 777 in command of the plainest captain anybody supported by first officer captain amen captain anybody has over 500 hours of talking about planes plus 300 300 hours of looking at planes and a hundred hours of dreaming of planes today will be his first maiden voyage flying a plane let's give him a round of applause my brethren if i am on that plane i will ask to be taken off that plane because the information has not done anything to build my fate and confidence to fly on that plane the natural types the spiritual there comes a time when our message preach must take on a life not only to be acceptable towards salvation but in cast not of devils healing the sick even raising the dead loosen those who are born setting them free did this did jesus christ and we are supposed to be identified with that same ministry in this hour what have we done to measure up to this ministry the power is in the world and it's up to sons to have the dynamics come down upon the mechanics to give us the results when joshua was on his campaign to rid the land of the ice he encountered trouble on the way my brothers god is looking for men that he can put his trust in men who would listen to him are not to one another men who know god in his power the question today is where are these sons at men who care for the sheep enough to go down on their knees lie on their stomachs in order to get their egos out of the way that god can trust them who wouldn't get themselves full of pride and fame oh yes we need manifested sons as they were back in eden but it would not come by word only there has to be a consecration there has to be a dying note there has to be a lien done before god night on day night and day until we hear from him every revival that was sparked every son and every daughter that was manifested came about from prayer joshua sent his army to to view the land and they came back saying oh it's a small city we don't need to send everybody let's all just send about two to three legions of men and the legion is a thousand so that's about three thousand but without prayer or consecration they went and what happened they were beaten and driven back they had to get a red cross to go and help them with the 36 dead men that were on the ground this result prompted joshua to call a halt because the people's hearts were melted and became as water look around the message churches today and gage the hearts of the people gaze the the feelings of the people the frequency that is going through the church there's a lot of preaching and there's a lot of pulling but where are the signs and wonders to prove that jesus christ ministry is back with us and that is my greeting to you joshua rent his clothes and call up premeeting he fell upon his face before the ark of the lord until evening tithe most people could hardly make 20 minutes he and israel put dust upon their heads oh in his prayer he tried to put the blame on the law and many of us try to put them well god why are you not doing this and god why is this not being done but that's we put in the blame the wrong place he's not the one responsible for the defeat but the lord said unto him get up on your feet why liars down now you should have done that before before you went to fight then you would have known that there was sin in the camp and that the people that become too entangled in the things and the affairs of the world you can hardly tell the difference between a believer today and the people of the world we dress alike we talk alike we move alike the only places we go different is the church the prophet said when we bring the sick before god and they fail to get healed that becomes an issue so my challenge to you is to call us solemn assembly as joshua did and return back from whence we strayed for adventure god would intervene and come and perform among us that which we seek to have among us words are not enough painted pictures cannot warm us in snow time i challenge you brothers and sisters around the world men of god the dead angel is in the land and when the enemy come in like a flood god raises a standard where are the standards we don't want just standard bearers we want standards power power virtual power for service so i challenge you today and i challenge you the believers return from whence we came back to god back to pray back to being on our knees back to genuineness back to sincerity removed from the division removed from all this bias and discrimination and all the spirits that have entered into the message and let's go back to god and then just maybe we will see these manifested sons of god and we would not just be talking god but god will be talking back to us may god bless you amen amen let's all stand glory to god hallelujah amen amen thank you lord jesus praise god hallelujah thank you

hallelujah may god bless you and greetings to brother paul his wife and family and the great golden age tabernacle for this uh easter virtual convention we greet you in the blessed name of jesus christ and we appreciate your faith to believe that we're going to work among us through this medium i want to also salute all the ministers that has gone before and those i will come after may god bless you and may the spirit of god take the word and drive it straight in the people's heart praise the lord amen so this morning if you have a bible just two portions of scripture acts 1 8 and romans chapter 8 verse 15 first scripture reading this morning acts 1 8 and romans 8 verse 15 and acts 1 8 but he shall receive power after the holy ghost is come upon you and you shall be witnesses unto me but in jerusalem and in all judea and samaria under the uttermost part of the earth romans 8 15 for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father let's bow his heavenly father we thank you for your word we have read it lord and only you could bring life and interpret it to all hearts come and interpret it among us and confirm it with signs wonders and miracles and may your spirit be released showed all you it is your promised lord to follow the predestinated seeds granted lord in jesus my ask it amen and amen god bless you you may be seated oh blessed be the name of the lord another easter is here oh glory to god and easter is a powerful time easter means he is raised from the dead praise god he can't keep him back no more no roman could keep him back no stone could keep him back no grave could keep him back not even dead his self could keep him back nothing keeping back this resurrected christ promised to be among the bride oh blessed be the name of the lord so this morning i have a title today the promised seed that has the promise of life another subject the holy spirit slot and i have an inspiration without the spirit the bride body won't move oh blessed be the name of the lord without the spirit the bride body won't move all glory that god shall be tan god for rapport and the inspiration the manifestation of the sons of god as they were in the garden of eden and the other inspiration the ministry of the bride and the ministry of christ are the same ministry and that's actually an actual quote praise god from the prophet the minister of the bride and the ministry of christ is the same ministry oh glory to god and we are predestinated under adoption of children and it's the good pleasure of his will so it's no longer your holiness and your trust in the lord it's god's good pleasure glory to god having predestinated us unto adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will this is god and his children this is father and son that's why we're crying at our pastor our apostle our prophet we say in our father or give the lord a praise offering oh hallelujah praise god and you this morning you are promised seeds glory to god first you have to get a revelation that you are actually a promised seed on the earth god promises on you no devil could stop you from coming forward your mother couldn't abort you all glory to god nothing could go wrong your heart wants to be manifested because you are god's seed on the earth with the promise of life give the lord a shall you are seated with the promise of life this morning life is hanging over you [Music] [Applause] glory to god hallelujah life is hanging over you there is a liar this morning glory to god romans 8 definitely tells us you have not received the spirit of bondage to fear but you receive the spirit of adoption not adopted yet the spirit of the spirit of the spirit that will take you to adoption the spirit has been leading the adoption every step you make as towards adoption you don't walk into hell you walk into adoption you walk into perfection you're walking into a manifestation that's what the call is for oh god do i hear a shout in the house oh glory to god do you get it no you're not walking to church you're walking to adoption and if children then heirs joint heirs with jesus christ he's our big brother i want what he died for i want what he pay the price for [Music] [Applause] promise seats that's what you are let's go back a little bit let's talk a little bit about the son of man anytime he has son of man you know he's a sower that's the first power but he's introduced he said a man saw seed some fell on three sides some fell among torns some fell on good ground some fell upon rocks and when the disciples asked him what you mean by that all this bible talk he said the saw he's the son of man hallelujah then another person said the seeds are the children of the kingdom so all of a sudden seeds become you come on now preach back to me oh glory to god hallelujah some fell here some fell dear but some fell on good ground so once you see santa man look for sowing wants to see sarah man look for seed so what happened in the beginning christ came the god prophet a son of man full of seeds full of the names all the names in the book because he was the book so son of man is logos word the book or give the lord a shout think about it now all the names locked up in solomon and the names come out as the word and the word is a seed and the seed is you [Applause] [Music] oh glory to god lord i hear you the seed is you now this is for a man so to bring back fallen man remember what he said born again right of word seed and spirit you say born again of the word alone you know you must be born again of the word and spirit so the word doesn't come first spirit coming after let me say it again word come first spirit come after jewish state it shall come to pass afterwards i will pour out my spirit after i have restored it shall come to pass afterwards i will pour out my spirit young men shall see visions come on young men all men shall dream dreams upon my admins upon the sisters also will i pour out my spirit my people shall eat and be satisfied and praise the lord their god that heart dealt wondrously with them and my people shall never never never never never never never never never never never be ashamed or if you're oh glory to god i feel good this morning hallelujah let's continue oh glory to god so once you see son of man we see the sower we see the full body words sowing seeds because after sun a man you will see son of god so let's look at it this way son of man called disciples see them done with the promise they went into the upper room and received the spirit to manifest the seed that they are so peter step out apostle peter spokesman peter in other words god begin to move because the seas is coming alive the seas has been planted and i'm going to prove to you it's impossible for you not to come forward i'm not hoping you're comfortable it is impossible for if not to happen look at the pattern son of man then sons of god write in another book of acts then son of god through seven churches are you hearing me because the church fell away so the son of god was he that stand it or walk it amidst the seven golden candlesticks so all through the seven golden candlesticks which is the seven ages he was walking i know thy works i know and i know and i know he was walking back and forth to the seven golden candlesticks knowing at the end time there will be a promise of sonoma again according to luke 17 30 to be revealed again so once we get back to solomon when you look again you're going to see son of god coming forth so god sent william branham according to malachi 4 behold i sent you elijah and god was veiling that prophet according to luke 17 30 to bring back son of man again but this time all the scattered word that was scattered through all the seven ages he come and gathered him up and bring back solomon full body word pregnant with god pregnant with seeds pregnant with names that was the burden upon william marion branham as an adopted son you have to come to speak the word because only your spoken word could bring you forth because only your spoken word is your original seed no church could bring your thought or give the lord a shout you have to come by original seed you have to come from the mouth of god [Applause] do you get that maybe see that all through the ages was the normation of spirit pathway pat revelation the son of man could only be son of man when he could gather up all the word to bring him back to full seed because god equivalent plant don't have seed if we have to have manifest sons like in the beginning like the early church we have to have solomon bringing full seed which is the full revelation of the mind of god what he told daniel go thy way the book is sealed till the time of the end because at the end of time i have some sons some born sons some sons that could be seed sons some children of the kingdom they have to get the full body word they have to be seated on and all these years god was trying to put the season to you and the secret is the word oh do you know where i'm going the word is in the bride so god put the word in you word without life word with potential word leading water word needing life word needing dynamics word needing inspiration oh glory to god remember this the age past gone the pentecostal age dynamics fell dynamic is the holy ghost the holy ghost fell but it couldn't produce the adoption of sons it couldn't preserve men to cry abba father because they didn't have the word the word wasn't restored yet so they couldn't come to perfection because you could only come to perfection by the word which is the seed that has to come inside of you oh glory to god listen so far we are talking about church we're not talking about group come on now preach back to me we're not talking about church we're not talking about group we're talking about what it has in the garden of eden which was a son of god standing represented god god said god of heaven you will be the quarter of the earth you represent me on earth with my intent with my purpose with my vision with my objective and motive you as a son represent me on the earth whatever your name is the name thereof oh glory to god adam was the son of god i remember the son of god under god and this message as a hidden mystery inside this message is wrapped up the return of the sons of god back into position and there has to be a way for us to get back and that way is the [Applause] blood maybe see that not just the blood they say jesus died for you but the blood to prove that you are justified [Applause] as if it never did sin i know that hard for the human mind to accept and grasp but that is a revelation you hear what i said that is a revelation god had to reveal that to you that you never did it in the first place because you see it's god's business when god sees you clean you see you clean when god you justify he see you justify when your saints drop in the sea of forgetfulness a drop devil can't fish in the but the devil cap on the fish and string and try to pull it up he crazy he know the name of that seal the name of that is the sea of forgetfulness god set it up that when god put that in his trash can he himself can't undelete it and do it he can't even fish it of himself or give the lord some praises when god put that in the sea all this will make everybody shout when god put that in the sea the name of it the sea of forgetfulness not just forgetting no forgetfulness every time you try to remember you forget every time you think about it you forget when you're looking at it you can't see it you scrape you dig you push your hand your feel is not there because you are justified as if you never did it and that justification brings us back into the illegal condition [Applause] [Music] god is not full he will only devote to matter god the devil children adam and eve negan and that's my god put man he must get back monday god have to win this race and the only way he could do it is through the blood he couldn't send an angel he came among himself to play a blood price that you could get back the only reason we have access to his presence this morning is by the blood is that you pray last night is that you in the message is that people in the message have no access to presence it's not to believe what a random is that people believe about ramen and who have not tested presence all glory to god access to presence is by blood [Music] access to presence is by blood if you didn't need the blood you didn't need just to die just need to read your bible and chill but because jesus paid a price and opened my door that sons of god who want to go free oh my all right praise god son of man isn't that right luke 17 20. promise to come back again in the beginning son of man jesus dropped promises in them the same works i do shall you do also if you shall say this wrong to be move on the dog in your heart you can have what you're saying what does son of man do and giving them seeds they're ready for it yet they no condition to activate it yet but you have to give it to them because that is what they could become you see god will wait till you're ready he give it to you before you're ready that's why he anointed david to be king before david was even ready to be king god put the anointing upon him so that's why i'm saying there is no way you could miss this because god already plays that will already place that spirit upon you it's upon you it's what you call the spirit of adoption that spirit that's what bring it to the word that's what bring it to the message god there bring in the message of warmer church bench and say in this church no no no no no no no god bring you to this message to be adopted that's the purpose you want adopted sons you don't understand adopted sons mean face in the devil's face adapted since means your foot on the devil's neck adopted sun speeds will retain back be taken back from the terror so you know what god's saying i live in that drama to my sons idiot that last day fight and drama i'm leaving that to my sons wait till they could sign just like me wait till this signature is just like the father wait till they have the authority and they're preaching the word with power with signs with wonders and miracles and just wait wait till you see that you have seen nothing yet that's why the bible sits still until the spirit moves until the spirit nothing happened until the spirit began to move the world i see the bride and actually now they think we believe in books and tapes and hearing a prophet and saying that stuff that's what they think but one day right timing walk into the temple the spirit is upon me for he has anointed me for glory to god and once your anointing come devil look out or give the lord a shout [Applause] that anointing is the notion of your name you know when i call her name john jones if john jones is here he alone could respond to that he knows his name he's not talking about nobody else he can look around as they go by somebody and says john jones and when god call your name release the anointing of your name there is nothing like a man on his name the power behind your name oh glory to god you call me yes it's me oh glory to god hallelujah praise god i heard my name [Applause] i heard it i heard it when john saw his name oh glory the book was spinning seals was breaking john was looking all of a sudden he saw his name he said glory he said hallelujah john began to get on you know the first thing john said we shall reign on the earth the reign is to conquer the rule to dominate or glory to god and you're going to conquer you're going to rule you're going to dominate right here in your heart on your earth in your environment and circumstance oh blessed be the name of the lord up to now we are talking about church we ain't talking about group we are talking about message people we talking that listen but abandoned behold i send the promise of my father upon you this is jesus but tarry in the city of wait in the city of jerusalem until you're being jew with performing high so if all this seed word and predestinated mystery was in peter and all these brethren why would they still have to wait until jesus opened their understanding to the scriptures they know the word they know the promise they know the history they know what god said and yet you tell them wait because what you have can't make it what you have not good enough i know you are promising because you receive me you receive my words but the promised seeds have a promise of life and hallelujah life is the holy ghost life is the seals from the back of the book that's where life coming from your name is written in the book but the life have to come to connect with your name oh can we give the lord a shout could we give the lord a shout your name is in the book it's written it's written but the life have to connect with your name you have to wait for the life we know you are predestinated how many happy to be predestined to this morning how many know their words he's this morning how many know they are called of god and the devil didn't call you but god himself called you oh glory to god but you were promised seed that have the promise of life oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah i'm not just talking about life for you i know in life for your host life for your children life for your family or glory to god praise god says the hearty right he said i give you your two sons in the name of jesus christ life came out the mouth of the prophet life will come on your mouth he came that you might have life and have it more abundantly when this word turned to spirit when this word turned to power when this word turned to life he said he that believeth on me as the scripture had said i ain't talking no pastor i ain't talking about no bishop i am talking about he that believe it on me as the scripture had said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water oh glory though that was a prophecy because the holy ghost was not yet given because jesus did not died had not died her glory looked good but once he died spirit was released remember if the devil could go back and forth on the eighth to one through your spirit that god can't go back and forth and yet come on now just as lucifer going back and forth on the earth he's going back and forth the spirit of god he's going back and forth in trinidad going in this home going in this house looking into this house he's speaking through your window he's looking through your door he's looking for your heart he's looking for your mind you're looking for your spirit what you want back unfold spirit that's not the pastor watching you now that's the spirit so here we go now to show not only did he draw all the benefits out of it but he shared those benefits he come to redeem watch or oh this is beautiful to bring to life doors predestinated seed that god seen before the foundation of the world and put their names in the book of life and here they are on the earth without a hope he came not only to be the blessing but to share the blessing peter seed of god woman of the well seed of god andrew james john seeds of god predestinated seeds that god has ordained the life soil seed of god persecuting the church but predestinated to receive life you can't tell god how to be destinated you can't tell god who to put it in he could put it in a drunkard put it in a prostitute put it in your grandmother your grandfather put it in a wicked man oh glory to god hallelujah when god finished with him all the wickedness come out oh give the lord a shout jacob i love he so i hate david was i've been going to it you know the kind of man who jacob jacob was he wasn't easy imagine jacob in this church and all they're hearing is complaints complaints completely rip off this one and you still come to church rip off that one you come to church when the pastor and the preacher said turn around and greet your brother tonight and see jacob and he rip you off and you hold your hand like that because jesus called you and jesus called him too and again i fight like if you know more than god should i shouldn't die first corinthians 3 5 to 8. paul speaking who then is paul it's paul talking who is apollos but ministers by whom he believed even as the lord give to every man i have planted apollos watered but god gave the increase so god revealed here a mystery of the seed it has to be planted it has to be water and gold have to give the increase if you don't plant you cut water if you don't water you can't get no breaking fault water is spirit water is life seed is weird seed is dramatized you are dramatized because you had representation by predestination and the germ is in you since your partying since you were smoking and drinking and fettered it was there the devil didn't know it if he knew it he was gonna leave you a long time ago but he thought he was one of his and god said no that is one of mines or give the lord a shout so when god take his spirit and throw it on you all them things that'll fall off because there was something deeper than that deeper than flesh deeper than human spirit deeper than a human element that's something in your soul your husband can't get there madness can't even get you little go plume of the rockers that mental thing can get there oh give the lord a shout in the house come on now nothing can't stop that you lost your husband that you're gonna stop that you're lost white that they're gonna stop that you lost boyfriend kill friend then you're gonna stop that you have a job daddy gonna stop that you don't have a job nothing will stop that you lost your job that wouldn't stop that because you are seed of god you have no education that is stopping that either because peter wasn't learned didn't stop that oh my he said i have planted apollos watered but god gave the increase so there neither is he that planted anything neither he that water it but god that give it increase now he had planted he that water it a one and every man shall receive his own reward according to his word so therefore the seeds that were sown by this prophet of willem branagh who wrote the vision had to be watered by the ministers that he put on the earth water what the same seeds we can't bring our own seeds we're supposed to be enochs you knock spiritual eunuchs we don't bring our own revelation to show how revelated we are i know that's not a word we have to bring the same seeds because man shall only rebread alone but out of the mouth of god the seed that come with the mouth of god so when god sends son a man yes his son man from eating stupid words i hear to say the same thing i'm an echo yeah yeah i'mma echo what the prophet said because i have a revelation these are the seeds that the spirit is looking for you see the spirit that was there in that prophet know the seeds that went off his mouth so when the spirit return is looking for them seeds so a man planted my toes here coming look at the lettuce you're looking for a fig here looking for guava it's pissed tomatoes he plant he watered him and he said i go overplan he said who planned that is that enemy plant everything else trying to tap the man field it's tomatoes you're looking for well god planted orange tree and the devil cut it down and as it as they cut so then others come and graft them grapefruit and lemon and tangelo and they keep grafting but the tree keep growing you can restore you cast up the tree but then after a while he said praise god when that come to the end and put forth another listen original branch and every minister that went off track the spirit can't fall dear to produce an original because original can't go to spirit first you have to go to wordpress ah because the spirit falls on everything oh glory to god so to come back to perfect seed you have to come back to original which is god said so that is what this prophet represents thou seek the lord so i don't care to penny about somebody's interpretation of what the prophet said because god is his own interpreter oh glory to god so watch the ministers were supposed to water the seeds until the time appointed so here's what the prophet said just beautifully he said when the enemy come in like a flood the spirit of god would raise a standard now watch that song's general and that song is powerful but when he put it in context he said what does he do he said take the same word and make it more positive why because the time is long but the vision is true so if the time is long and the vision is true you have to be quickened to see this world as positive in other words i am just as strong as when i first started out my faith is not waxing poor every day is going stronger i'm not going to stagger at the promise of god through unbelief because of revelation i'm a promised seed and i have a promise of life not pentecostal life no other life will work in her this bride you can't put not two volt battery has had a timeless engine it's ain't gonna work you have to get the right power because this engine is a ticket to the rapture so he said no other life will work what is he talking about the life of charity [Music] you don't hear much about that but that's the life life of charity the life of the spirit not the small measure part not the spirit of adoption part but the dynamic part that produces seven live voices that the devil recognized any time them forces are to live the devil is seated like a badge it's like identification mark it's something that like oh god look he come in he come in the community come in move movie coming you see it before he felt power before he know when that voice come walking anytime that voice come walking devil have to go high running oh glory the guardian conquered the light before and the life was manifested oh glory to god and there's going to be a bride they're going to manifest this life i look at my devils in half i look at my sex spirited half i reckon which become pornography on the internet in half i don't care what kind of demon glory they'll call the life will be manifested [Applause] their life not a life the life glory the god so the watering of the seed which you are is until the time appointed god told daniel the vision was long hallelujah the time was long but the vision was true we written years now eyewitnesses 1975. so don't complain if you come in two three years ago and four years ago and five years ten years ago are you breathing longer than you don't complain when i started my hair was black and going green now still waiting hallelujah wait until not wait until your pastor get a better suit forget the shooting word the tits even suit that's okay wait until you're enjoying power from on high when will you receive power when your pastor give you a book when you listen to that message on the tablet that's not when you're getting power when you listen to all the messages they know when they're getting power you charity power after after oh glory to god let a mystery around that let them teach around that let them explain that away when you will get power you shall receive power after the holy ghost come upon you oh glory not after the minister sermon after the holy ghost got to come upon you not after teaching teaching teaching teaching after holy ghost come upon you i say the holy ghost the holy ghost the holy ghost got to come upon you but you have a promise because you are promised seed with the promise of life that's what easter proved he was not only mechanics but he was the dynamics in the world to make it manifest what glory to god amen [Music] amen but banana says this we are the end time the seeds are sown now the latter rain is fixed into he'd have no promise at la terrain of no seeds there god will only talk about later if the season's in the ground that we can expect clattering when i found my plan to see there's no rain you have to wait for rain it could be rain rain rain sing rain whole day until the season change for rain you have to wait for rain because rain seed on the seed to begin to bring it forth it's online but here is prophecy remember there will be such a denominational gathering pretty soon it will be terrific and they will bring themselves together into this federation of churches then this kind of church will be put out of operation as far as they know at that time jesus will appear and he will show which is bride and which is not remember christian friends i'm a man i can make mistakes many muslims don't talk that okay the prophet talking that talk many men are making no mistakes at all they on their own i'm a man i can make mistakes but god being god cannot make a mistake all the words that have been written must be fulfilled jesus said so so we have got things here in the scripture that must be fulfilled and that is one of the things this boycott to come are you ready now but before this boycott can come this is before now so don't jump the boycott don't say the comment that commented coming you're no one with that i am talking about before before this project can come of the marking of the beast there has to be a seed sold for god to take a church out of it [Applause] and that's what i'm saying take a closer look because we are boxing tip that is foolishness that is not how you get close down they're closing on because christ has been manifest and denominations go can't handle it [Applause] won't we tell you what we could have a book that that could do something enemy laughing and put books on tapes you had to become the book manifested tape manifested word manifested and the only way that could be done is by power so what did the prophet said national force put israel in back in the homeland national forest will put the churches in the world council churches but the power of god will put the people in the bride so if you're backstage in 20 years you're coming on the right time oh glory to god you're both the poor god to hit you yo your body get lush you're about to get hit with the power of god oh god give the lord a shout you're coming at the right time oh glory to god the power of god put the people back no no listening here in here in here [Music] glory to god two million people their books and tapes but only two went in oh give the lord a shout i want to say it again two million of them was listening to prophet moses but only two other revelation of what it was all about just one caleb that went into the promised land my god i don't want to come to you all these years and get locked back behind the fellowship with tribulation saints they're on their own praise god i press it on to the rapture or give the lord i shout before the boycott can come i see that to be sold who is the son of man the showa what's the seed all seven seals seven thunders all glory to god in the seven thunders is the capstone revelation of jesus christ oh glory to god the entire seed he said the entire bible gonna be soul that means the entire bible is in me or glory to god that make you a seed that makes me a seed and we have a promise all glory to god the promise of life oh give the lord you shall receive power oh glory to god hallelujah [Music] [Applause] oh my god oh you promise listen he promises that you have any light to write in the word seed that have been sworn for this day oh you mean the seed must not just be sown no you'd have to get ripe oh how that makes it different now yeah there's no scary wacker coming and running out but i said they had a harvest no that my god had the hot sun for that my god have hot trials that my god have her testing for to see how the heat hits in your seed but if it dry up fast it's not that you i don't want to die see you know because you see the shot that's dry up fast but the sea does get golden brown when the sun hit it so when this devil think that what he coming at you is to dry you up and pack you up and make you give up he don't understand you are being ripened by the heat that is around you you flip the script on him you say i'm not giving up i'm not backsiding i'm too close to the finish line [Applause] is a man digging for gold he diggy digging going down 10 feet 12 feet 20 feet and he tired for the picture of me folk i don't the night on me a final goal and somebody come and they do so clicks go right under there that's where we at right now we right by the goal we write by the power we write by the anointed we write by dynamics don't give up now [Applause] don't give up you promise to send you have any light right in the world see that will be sown for this day the seed is in here are you ready the seed is the bible jesus already tell them when a man said come here don't go after them lordy kingdom here don't go follow them chinese draw these cyborgs under themselves listen to what he said the seed is the bible why jesus said so the word is i see the source so now you can have before you can have any crop no matter how you sow the seed it's got to have light to ripen that seed oil rot it won't do no good will perish but if it's got seed in the ground the right ground with the right kind of sunlight on it it's got to ripen and he promised that in the last days in the evening time the sun would come out to write in that seed the seed is being preached so all them who don't want preachers the unknown they're heading straight for the tribulation without oil because the oil is a seed and you turn in the spirit thereby the foolish version never get the oil because the oil is what common to you now in wood form so the foolish version can't take the word therefore they can't get the spirit because the word and spirit is one you can't reject the word and expect to get spirit nice pentecostals i had shut up television talking tongues and the dead of the world that's not the word the spirit as if you said the rain doesn't fall on the matter tree or alone it fall in mind one or two two the rain does fall everyone says touching the marijuana no the rain doesn't do that the rain just fall it's not the rain it's the seed don't fight up with the rain make sure you have the right seed and the scene have to have the right soil or ground or heart or condition you're angry you mean you're hateful you're bitter you have issues on what that you're on your own we're too far down the road we have not received the spirit to fear so we fear no man we tell them like it is we speak the truth and tell him like it is it's not the spirit of fear to get into bondage but it's the spirit of adoption it's the liberty that you have to approach your father and your god give the lord a shout do you hear what we said this morning it's the liberty [Music] not about five fold sorry the fivefold the unknown passenger five come back to the catholic priesthood again see people have it mixed up because men present themselves as the avenue to god and god unreleased jesus christ sent a prophet to glorify jesus christ and to present jesus christ as john the baptist was centered on the first coming of christ you have a message your message is jesus christ but around him the point just not to himself praise god hallelujah he can appoint us to jesus christ oh god tell my wife i do you have a picture of her behind here there's a reason i choose not to do that in my office not here we're here to glorify jesus christ the only thing we have is that pyramid that is jesus that's going to be in you that's what we are pointing you to is i did not come to build another denomination i came to point people to the statue [Applause] catching a perfect man hallelujah the sea is being preached the son of god is writing that seed by what by vindicating it making it push out before you and proving that it is right how will we know the message of the hour question he said how will i know the message of the hour god proves what he promised and he talks about it that's identification what he promised to do in christ he proved it on the resurrection what he promised to do to moses he proved it what he promised in the days of enoch he proved it in all the days of the apostles he proved it now when this day he proves what he said because they are part of that seed that was represented on the book of life that he came to redeem back to god again i want you to see you as part of the seed that was represented on the book of life that he come back to redeem and to redeem us to bring you back where it was before come and preach back to me not salvation redemption [Applause] because they are part of that seed that was represented in the book of life that they came to redeem back to god again easter morning not only did he raise but his beneficiaries raised with him then when christ had his crucifixion the with him and his resurrection we are beneficiaries quickened after being dead in darkness oh glory to god you say oh god we are hungry and twisting for god we joined them better this baptist pentecostal there was still something wrong we just couldn't find it and all of a sudden while we are groping in darkness the great resurrection came to us in the manifestation of the promised wood of god oh god he wanted us to look for that manifestation if everybody come in such an expectation he said the bride had no revivalist yet there have been no manifestation of god to steal the bride oh god it will take them seven thunders he promised it he would send it if the people would forget decrees and dogmas and plead the promises it will become effective to them and right now this morning we are peeling the promises you here oh glory to god i had the promise of god promises of god with a promise on top of promise god promised you and on top of you from his life the devil is in trouble this morning the bride gonna have the life oh because you are the written word oh glory word written word living word made manifest and the spirit had to come upon you give me a scripture jesus went into the temple found the pathways written isn't that right the spirit is upon me so the spirit had to hit him for him to manifest his promise and his spirit have to hit you as the bride revelation 2017 the spirit and the bride how could you how could you be part of the bride and you're not connecting with the spirit the spirit has to follow you you understand the spirit following the word the spirit follow the blood all the way from the book of redemption and you are drawn from the blood from the book of redemption your name go way back here that's why the devil could only amen and trap you up to this time of no time but when god bless you all you boss you out you can't go back in after a while the devil comes small afterwards the devil will get less and all you're dealing with is you and your issues you and your challenges the devil is not even a picture he can't get to the back side he can't get it to give up he can't get you to let go so it's you you you you the picture have to get out of the way because he can't force his life into you you have to open the door and get rid of stuff and get rid of things that he could get the preeminences he will use what he can if you surrender your monkey you'll use your mouth if you're staring at your tongue you will use your tongue you surrender his hands you use your hands your surrender is hard to use your heart whatever you want to surrender he's going to use he can use whatever he can use oh that's the quadriceps oh chloe to god they didn't have the holy ghost in the old testament time but to use them he used samson he used david he used joshua he used all the saints and heroes of all but in this last day he is using his son his son and you oh glory to god the promise is the son in you oh glory to god we can preach to you eternal loss we can't preach to know eternal loss we will lost ourselves it's christ all ministry have to come back in a pride same ministry same life same jesus oh glory to come back in the bride to preach to the eternal loss oh glory to god who are we we are nothing oh give the lord some praises hallelujah thank you lord all right let me see hit this stretch god foresaw the bride in the groom he foresaw the bride in the groom adam knew what he was doing her eve didn't know what she was doing adam walked out with his wife and jesus took his wife place and became sin for her it's not like adam was stupid adam knew what he was doing he loved his wife and he walked out of the garden with his wife and jesus went and take his wife's place because his wife was a sinful or when he died in calories i died for them that's why he fighting for you this morning that's why the angels with the sword drawn trying to guide you back to the tree of life because of his love for you [Applause] let me say it to you good he removed kings for your sake [Applause] he'll remove ministers for your sake he will turn things upside down for your sake because you are wife of the lamb come here i will show you the bride the lamb's wife oh glory to god hallelujah oh my god this one is a big one you say like the pentecostal experience today i just love this the coming of the holy ghost in the last days as promised they're not just holy ghosts this is going a little deeper the holy ghost as promised is likely abstract to the title deed this is the promised one let's continue you say gonna get a title sure you're gonna title that place but that's still those say it's yours somebody way back here under could come in and put a claim on it so somebody get id that these is not really cleared that is why when you go to the bank to buy piece of property you have to send it now for them to check out the history of this property sometimes somebody sell you that is not theirs or they want to sell you something that is not theirs there are these are paper bogus looking legit until you check it all the way oh glory to god so this holy ghost coming is the legit thing this abstract is the title d that adam lost this is no game so nobody can claim that without vindicating i have what adam had they are liars they say they are persons but they are liars to claim this experience you have to show the evidence of the abstract because when the abstract have your name on it and you squatter on that ground any sickness on that girl any disease on that ground you have authority to run him out cast him out [Applause] let's continue when a man has said he believes the word and then when the holy spirit comes it is the abstract to the title and that gives you permission when you have that abstract and every bit of it belongs to you and everything on it belongs to you gives you the abstract when the holy ghost comes upon this title deed that god saw back under before the foundation of the world and put it name on the book of life and was born to a man or woman something to sin and guilty of sin but when i believe on it here we go there's the part i want to get to when i believe on it i received the deed but when the holy ghost come it was the abstract that everything against me whether my mother done it whether my father done it is struck off so the abstract is what literally rocks you back to eden [Music] [Applause] not the deed the deal is what the message have now the talking word that's deed but the bride will come with the abstract which will be the devil's answer [Music] because after jesus brother branham was the only man to prove the abstract is on the earth because adam lost the book and nobody could access that that was shot up in heaven waiting for the last days so when daniel get up go tell daniel go your way the time is not yet leave that for the end time people leave there for the end time punch oh glory to god so when the lamb took the book revelation 10 mighty angel coming from heaven another five fold there i have no man there seven thunders after the voices and on the night version ten version ten seven a prophet waiting here to catch it in the place of the voice of the seventh angel he is written there the book drop into his hands then here come us now revelation 10 8 i heard a voice say go to the angel hold glory to god and say give me that little book oh glory to god this book they couldn't touch this book they couldn't watch this book that was sealed no you had to go to the angel and say give it to me and i went to the angel i obey him i went and took the book [Applause] glory to god maybe season when i took the book angel says eat it up start to eat it it might take 50 years eat it eat it eat the continuing eat swallow swallow sweeten the mouth bitten the belly hallelujah lies gonna come child's gonna come this ain't gonna come but that's sweet in the mouth beat it up and prophesy because the time the wis the vision is true but the time is long prophesied coming prophesied to wait prophecy dynamics prophesy power prophesy adoption prophesy oh glory to god watch your own life and prophesy watch your sickness and prophesy glory to god [Music] this is where i get the whole line of thought from but i'm talking about notice he was the first corner wheat i've been raised from the dead god his life raising from the dead he was the first fruits of them that slept the first fruit and he become a sheath and when they get the first fruit you bring it to the priest and weave it another testimony others come in i'm not the only one so when jesus raised him the dead he know the spirit released so he mustn't he could be the only one the spirit hunting for the season the spirit is just floating in the air you know the spirit have a destination the spirit have have a destination to find them find them wherever you are any part of the earth find them in africa find them in the caribbean find them in north america find them in europe fight them in south america the spirit seven spirits sent forth to all the earth oh god one must pick up with you oh glory to god are feeling good right now one must pick up at you there's seven of them oh glory to god seven of them oh glory to god someone had to get in contact with you the spirit itself on you and when the spirit found you oh god you can't get away from it oh glory to god your backslide here you fall down here you get back up here you stumble here but you can't get away from it because you are a predestinated seal you are promising that has the promise of life [Music] glory this could be a special easter because what easter proved all glory to god so he was wave right now here today because he was the first son of god yeah this to come to full maturity to be in god he was plucked up from the earth and his wave over the people what a glorious lesson by the quickening power the first one although he had immediate type many times you see it later he was in tight but this was really the first fruit of the night slip he was waved here we go over the promised seed that had the promise of life it was with sonoma and promises wave over the people oh you shall be filled you shall receive power you shall be adopted my god this total power will be in you wait till the power of this church rises it will bring the brethren what kind of promises being weave over you when the power of this church rises it will bring on the power of that church and the power of that church and all over the world nobody can lock down the power the police will leak right out nobody can hold on the power that is foolishness lies intellectual nonsense no man could lock up god no man could capture god no one could lock down and hold on god he said heaven is my throne i know it is my footstool but what house will you build me but the body has got prepared and once god finds your body he is ready to step into it step into your sixteen element to prove he's the same yesterday today and forever to prove he is jesus christ the same yesterday forever oh glory to god hallelujah let me hit the home church here right now hallelujah he was wave at the day of pentecost when he came together having like a russian mighty wind and was waved over the people the pentacles of people other pentecost and is to be waved again according to luke 17 30 the son of man again i'm so glad who is the son of man in the beginning was the word isn't that right hallelujah and that word again is wave over the people that the dead traditional man is dead and the son of god is alive again yeah we switch it sorry man waving the word that the son of god is alive want to see shadow man you know what coming next son of god oh give the lord a shout want to see son of man what's next pillar of fire what give the lord a shout watch that the son of god is alive again with with the baptism of the holy spirit right among us and has given us life who given us life the holy ghost who who is that the predestination seed so number one you are seed of god a world seed of god i don't care what conditioning this morning you are still a seed of god a word seed of god and your seed come to meet this seed which is the word being preached to you because the seed is being preached and the seed is the bible so when you have that seed inside of you listen with all that spirit come up on peter peterson emmanuel jesus gave him a temporary blessing to preach a temporary blessing of power it was upon them not in them that where they cast our devils subject to us it was upon them not in them he said the holy ghost who i shall send he going to be in you and at that day you shall know not talk at that day not talk at that day you shall know i am in the father you and me and i and you you will know who instead of you you you and i was when you come

into the bright age and that bright age we didn't strike it is the holy spirit slot that is where god want to place you up here in the holy spirit where there are seven seals or seven thunders that kept the pyramid he said if that be sold in the seven thunders capped the pyramid then the pyramid is the word in you seven churches but the cap is the spirit charity itself right in that hole he goes

his life it's his power not our power and there's only one thing that we love to do is to seem glorified how can it be when he is glorified in us by his resurrection that's in us did you get that our desire is not to be glorified our desire is not have some big name our desire is not to boost some church to make more sunday school to bring in on whatnot that's not the way that all his eyes are
