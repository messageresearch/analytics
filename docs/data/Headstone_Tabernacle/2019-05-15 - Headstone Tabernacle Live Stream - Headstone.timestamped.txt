[26:22] know the people they get all caught up
[26:24] in the numbers and you think that that's
[26:26] that's gone amen
[26:28] priests good but God loves when you when
[26:30] you when you get closer to him and he
[26:33] maybe you set aside time goal doesn't
[26:36] mind the numbers he may and praise God
[26:37] it could be hundred it could be two it
[26:39] could be ten thousand priests go but God
[26:41] moves at individuals amen praise God so
[26:44] people's perception of amen
[26:46] you know they think they see a lot of
[26:47] people and that's a wonderful thing but
[26:49] Amen God can do something right in the
[26:51] midst of us here tonight please God so I
[26:54] don't want you to lose faith tonight a
[26:55] man God is here a man regardless praise
[26:58] God praise God of the situation's around
[27:00] us we know that we have a few challenges
[27:02] tonight and we said one remember but the
[27:04] Hugh Williams and pray he was a feeling
[27:07] well tonight and he had to suffer from
[27:10] some swelling in the foot he man so as
[27:12] we have enough time of Prayer tonight we

[27:41] soon amen at God could do miracles among
[27:43] us amen praise God so that's our feet
[27:46] tonight and that's what we'd acclaim
[27:48] well I have a title tonight a man based
[27:50] on a script we read and Revelation
[27:52] chapter 3 and this 18 and I have a title
[27:55] called the evening time message amen and
[27:57] I have a small subject to him that
[27:59] overcometh a man priests gone and taking
[28:03] it right out of the scripture tonight as
[28:04] it was and it was kind of on my mind for
[28:07] a little while and I thought well maybe
[28:08] tonight that Amen we had the opportunity
[28:11] to speak that cordwood kind of spit our
[28:14] hearts tonight amen and but I really
[28:17] wanted to focus on that overcoming part
[28:18] even because I feel that's that's that's
[28:21] where we plug in praise gone that's
[28:23] where we draw strength from praise gone
[28:25] because the people of God praise God the
[28:28] people and know they're gone shall be
[28:30] strong and they will do great exploits
[28:32] praise God so if we're not strong and
[28:35] we're not doing great exploits then it
[28:37] means that we haven't come to our
[28:39] fullest potential yet but that word is a
[28:41] prophecy that had spoke over you tonight
[28:44] praise go regardless of how you feel
[28:46] regardless of how you see yourself
[28:49] you are overcomer tonight because that
[28:52] is the people that will be in the end
[28:54] time
[28:54] praise gone him and a prophet said
[28:57] there'll be such a people a man the
[28:59] prophet got so excited he said it was so
[29:02] close he could almost taste it you wish
[29:04] he could live to see it a man but God
[29:07] didn't allow him to see it praise God
[29:08] God took his prophet off the scene Amen
[29:11] sort of prophet is not here but the
[29:13] voice is still on the earth a man a man
[29:16] that voice that prophetic voice that
[29:19] hallelujah spoke that a bride will come
[29:21] into view in this evening
[29:24] in this evening tea hallelujah praise in
[29:27] it's evening time in this message and
[29:29] God would have a people on the earth
[29:31] like no other people praise corny man
[29:34] and those people with two great exploits
[29:37] amen is run and not be weary they will
[29:40] walk and not faint they will pray and it
[29:43] was fun because God will be upon them
[29:46] would it be in their hearts I'm God will
[29:49] anoint the within their hearts God will
[29:51] mount a bride hallelujah in the last day
[29:54] and ride her down into the resurrection
[29:57] oh do you believe it tonight praise God
[30:03] hallelujah praise God so I promise a
[30:06] mighty victory in the scripture the
[30:10] bride hasn't had a revival yet but it'll
[30:13] take these seven unknown thunders to
[30:15] wake her up he'll send it he promised it
[30:18] and I love a burro would brought on
[30:20] Sunday seven living voices amen
[30:23] thundering out in the bride in sweetness
[30:25] and in humility in power right and
[30:30] that's what you promised in the last day
[30:32] that's what's going to be praise God in
[30:35] this evening time when the evening
[30:37] shadows of the world is falling upon us
[30:39] a man is now a man we can look around
[30:42] and see the signs of his coming signs of
[30:46] his coming all around praise gone the
[30:48] red light is flashing as it was amen
[30:51] amen hallelujah dangers on the approach
[30:53] but we thank God that he sent a prophet
[30:57] with a warning hallelujah God always
[31:00] sends a warning before Judgment court
[31:03] always has a mercy hallelujah to go out
[31:07] before the people shall I had hide from
[31:10] Abraham what I am about to to in the
[31:12] last day hallelujah Oh
[31:14] chorus about to pull off I'm sorry manga
[31:17] more NRA hallelujah but God sent a word
[31:20] Holly

[51:29] you man you love him tonight okay
[51:37] please call him and let me read this
[51:40] here quick from recognizing a dania
[51:42] message he said now on the papers he
[51:44] said you'll only get the six ages
[51:46] because it's allowed easier Church was
[51:48] blacked out completely
[51:49] he said now if you would notice the
[51:51] spiritual application as God set in oh
[51:54] man okay as God set it into heaven and
[52:01] when I set out there I left a little
[52:03] bitty space as you see just a teeny bit
[52:05] of light
[52:06] he said that was just before the very
[52:09] elect was to be called from the earth he
[52:11] said the reason I placed it on me it's a
[52:14] prophecy no he said the reason I place
[52:17] that slit of light and low DC there all
[52:20] right
[52:21] on the 7h for the 7h he said but when
[52:25] God put it in the heavens it was totally
[52:27] blocked out it means maybe the last one
[52:30] is call from that loud Eason Ange
[52:33] we don't know he said that could be a
[52:35] sermon on it he said but if that tree
[52:37] ever puts for another original branch or
[52:39] the best original fruit there it's got
[52:41] to be a restoration of all these things
