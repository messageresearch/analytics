[24:10] verse he left at 25 and revelation five
[24:15] wanted them so let's go Ephesians two
[24:19] reading from verse one and you mighty
[24:22] quickened who were dead in trespasses
[24:24] and sins wherein in time past ye walked
[24:27] according to the course of this world
[24:29] according to the Prince of the power of
[24:31] the air the spirit that worketh in the
[24:34] channel disobedience among whom also we
[24:36] all had our conversation in times past
[24:39] in the lusts of our flesh that would
[24:42] conversation means we have life
[24:43] fulfilling the desires of the flesh and
[24:46] of the mind and who of nature the churn
[24:48] of rat even as others but God rich in
[24:51] mercy for his great love where it he
[24:54] loved us even when we were dead in sins
[24:56] hath quickened us together with Christ
[24:59] by grace are ye saved and it raises up
[25:02] together I made us sit together in
[25:04] heavenly places in Christ Jesus that in
[25:08] the ages to come he might show the
[25:10] exceeding riches of His grace in his
[25:12] kindness towards us to Christ Jesus for
[25:16] by grace are ye saved through faith and
[25:18] not of ourselves yourselves it is a gift
[25:20] of God not of works lest any man should
[25:23] boast
[25:24] for we are his workmanship created in
[25:26] Christ Jesus unto good works which God
[25:29] hath before ordained that we should walk
[25:30] in them wherefore remember that he been
[25:34] in times past Gentiles in the flesh who
[25:37] are called uncircumcision by that which
[25:41] is called circumcision in the flesh made
[25:43] by hands that at the time he will beat
[25:46] on Christ being aliens from the
[25:48] Commonwealth of Israel strangers from
[25:50] the Covenant of promise having no hope
[25:52] without God in the world but no in
[25:55] Christ Jesus ye who were sometimes far
[25:58] off a midni by
[26:00] of Christ for he is our peace who had
[26:03] made bought one and had broken down the
[26:05] middle wall of partition between us
[26:07] having abolished in his flesh the enmity
[26:09] even the law of Commandments contained
[26:11] in ordinances for to make in himself of
[26:15] tween one new man so making peace that
[26:18] he might reconcile both unto God in one
[26:21] body by the cross having slain the
[26:24] enmity thereby and came and preached
[26:26] peace unto you which were foul and to
[26:29] them that were nigh and shew him we both
[26:32] have access by one spirit unto the
[26:36] Father now therefore you are no more
[26:38] strangers and foreigners but
[26:40] fellow-citizens with the Saints on with
[26:43] the hosel of God and are built upon the
[26:46] foundation of the apostles and prophets
[26:48] Jesus Christ Himself being the chief
[26:50] Cornerstone and whom all the building
[26:52] fitly framed together groweth and holy
[26:55] temple in the Lord in whom you also
[26:57] builded together for an habitation of
[27:00] God through the spirit Hebrews 10
[27:03] whatever from verse 11 and every priest
[27:06] standard daily ministering and offering
[27:08] of times the same sacrifice which can
[27:11] never take away sins but this man did
[27:15] tell his enemies be made his footstool
[27:16] for by one offering here perfected
[27:19] forever them that are sanctified wear of
[27:22] the Holy Ghost also the witness of us
[27:24] for after he had said before this is the
[27:27] Covenant that I will make with them
[27:29] after those days saith the Lord I will
[27:31] put my laws into them in their hearts
[27:35] and in their minds will I write them and
[27:38] their sins and iniquities will I
[27:40] remember no more now this is God saying
[27:42] that no very mission of DZ's there is no
[27:45] more offering for sin are then therefore
[27:47] brethren boldness to enter into the
[27:49] holiest by the blood of Jesus by a new
[27:53] and living way which he had consecrated
[27:56] for us through the veil that is to say
[27:58] his flesh and having a high priest over
[28:01] the house of God let us draw near with a
[28:03] true heart in full assurance of faith
[28:06] having our hearts sprinkled from an evil
[28:08] conscience and our bodies washed with
[28:10] pure
[28:11] let us hold fast the professional feet
[28:14] without wavering for he is faithful that
[28:16] promise and let us consider one another
[28:19] to provoke unto love and to good works
[28:21] not forsaking the assembling ourselves
[28:23] together as the manner of some is but
[28:25] exhorting one another and so much the
[28:28] more as you see the Day approaching a
[28:31] final scriptures from Revelation chapter
[28:33] 5 and I saw on the right hand of him
[28:35] that sat upon the throne a book written
[28:36] within and the back side see with seven
[28:39] seals
[28:40] I saw strong angel proclaiming a loud
[28:42] voice who is worthy to open the book and
[28:44] to loose the seals thereof and no man in
[28:47] heaven knowing it neither under the
[28:48] earth was able to open the book neither
[28:50] to look thereon and I went much because
[28:52] no man was found worthy to open to read
[28:54] a book please look there on one of the
[28:57] other son let me weep not to behold the
[28:58] land or the tribe of Judah the root of
[29:00] David had prevailed to open the book and
[29:02] to loose the seven seals thereof and I
[29:05] beheld and lo in the midst of the throne
[29:06] of the four beasts in the midst of the
[29:09] elders stood a lamb as it had been slain
[29:11] having seven horns and seven eyes which
[29:13] are the seven spirits of God sent forth
[29:15] it and all here
[29:16] he came glory and took the book on the
[29:19] right hand of him that sat upon the
[29:20] throne and when he had taken the book
[29:22] the four beasts and the four and twenty
[29:23] elders fell down before the lamb having
[29:25] every one of them harps golden vials
[29:28] full of odours which are the prayers of
[29:30] the saints and the song a new song
[29:32] saying thou art worthy to take the book
[29:33] and to open the seals thereof for thou
[29:36] was slain and has redeemed us to God by
[29:38] thy blood out of every kindred and
[29:41] tongue and people and nation and has
[29:43] made us unto our God kings and priests
[29:45] and we shall read this boy his father we
[29:48] of reggio would tonight be a calm down

[32:50] wish from them we shine hope tonight
[32:53] until the perfect understand of God's
[32:55] plan and be healed tonight hear the
[32:57] previous event in Jesus name so he was
[33:00] saying they always come for the church
[33:02] to Maria hallelujah and I recognized
[33:05] that every redemptive rights belong to
[33:07] the right hallelujah you believe that
[33:10] so what a time we had Sunday in that
[33:13] message and Jesus praise God he had was
[33:17] now expressed and sure he had dominion
[33:19] over himself a lot of people want power
[33:22] but you have to be able to show you have
[33:24] dominion over yourself and that is
[33:26] heaven domine over the lust of the eyes
[33:28] the lust of the flesh and pride of life
[33:30] so woman can lead you astray money
[33:33] cannot lead you astray popularity cannot
[33:36] lead you astray
[33:36] nothing can lead you astray the
[33:38] devlopment that touch inside of you
[33:40] yeah he can put his finger inside of you
[33:43] or praise the name of the Lord we
[33:45] believe that so he had self-control over
[33:48] his human spirit that's powerful self
[33:52] control over his human spirit now this
[33:56] word access touches all of it the issue
[34:00] has always been access to power and
[34:04] authority
[34:05] that has always been the issue Lucifer
[34:09] he wanted to be like the Most High and
[34:12] attempted a coup in heaven and even got
[34:15] some angels to make effort to system to
[34:19] be in a position of authority that he
[34:21] can be worship and when the Battle of
[34:24] Angels fell on earth man
[34:27] man was no longer spirit as in
[34:30] Genesis
[34:31] but no the spirit man was now in flesh
[34:34] as in Genesis 2
[34:36] so Lucy first job was to get access to
[34:39] the main and place wisdom and knowledge
[34:43] ahead of the world he did that true evil
[34:47] who was a by-product of the original and
[34:49] true Eve Adam took a bite and fell the
[34:53] devil don't have to hit you direct he
[34:56] can use others to get to you the devil
[34:59] didn't approach Adam which was original
[35:01] he approached Eve was a by-product and
[35:04] caused Adam to fall when Adam fell man
[35:08] fell man fell from the sixth sense of
[35:11] fate the five senses of the flesh and
[35:14] spirit the flesh being taste touch feel
[35:18] smell in here and the spirit being
[35:21] imagination memory conscience affection
[35:24] and reasoning the sixth sense was the
[35:27] only sense given to contact God to
[35:31] relate to God and Satan knew if we could
[35:34] break the connection man will no longer
[35:37] have access and he Lucifer would remain
[35:40] in charge of the earth forever roman as
[35:45] the prince of the power of the air once
[35:47] he could bring a connection man would no
[35:50] longer be on line with god man would be
[35:54] pushed into an offline mode to be on his
[35:57] own in five senses access to heaven will
[36:01] no be denied the ease of access to
[36:04] animals was no longer dear
[36:06] he knew he once had it but no he was a
[36:09] wanderer and this hip was adam access to
[36:14] god and the five senses give adam access
[36:18] to the eight but what purpose to restore
[36:22] the feet back to the sons of god or
[36:26] could be they've got some praises did
[36:29] you see that tonight god purpose that
[36:31] you won't be offline but he'll bring it
[36:34] up online and you will have access to
[36:36] every redemptive right
[36:40] can you see no in the last days go to
[36:44] restore access granted
[36:46] back to the sun's not access denied
[36:50] because when Adam was kicked out the
[36:53] angel was sent to guard the tree don't
[36:55] let him touch that tree in other words
[36:57] he had no more access to that tree
[37:00] access was denied but God proved us that
[37:04] God will restore access access granted
[37:07] to the sons of God hallelujah in the
[37:10] last days we believe that what the bus
[37:13] he will bring back the sons back on lane
[37:15] into heaven stand on the bus can you see
[37:19] why God said that the bride will be a
[37:22] super church a super race because she'll
[37:25] be using us I restored super-sense the
[37:29] faith that was once delivered Court
[37:32] restore the foundation stone of right
[37:36] under the devil's nose he put their
[37:39] ground state even Isaac loves he put the
[37:42] take up grace I mean put to perfection
[37:44] right under the devil's nose but God was
[37:47] doing something in the spirit realm he
[37:49] was gonna restore the sons of God to
[37:52] have full access not partial access but
[37:56] full access to every redemptive blessing
[37:59] under full authority and power God Oh
[38:02] hallelujah we believe so but a man was
[38:06] saying this in the breach he said don't
[38:08] you notice that how the animal in depth
[38:10] troubles that the tree struggles
[38:12] everything in nature is groaning wean
[38:15] ourselves are groaning no there is
[38:16] something wrong we see it from creation
[38:20] both man on the earth and so forth he
[38:23] says something was lost
[38:24] it is groaning it is trying to get back
[38:27] to its original condition there must be
[38:29] some way to get back to the original
[38:31] condition and when a person struck with
[38:33] disease aches and pain one time it
[38:36] wasn't that way but they are groaning
[38:37] because something is wrong they are
[38:40] trying to get back to health and when
[38:42] nature and people as the Bible said are
[38:44] groaning they are not in the auto B
[38:46] condition we don't need anybody to
[38:48] interpret that for us it was eternalized
[38:51] they fell from they lost their claim
[38:53] it's analyzed by the fall of Adam and
[38:56] Eve who fell from eternalized to death
[38:59] in the camera even a tree never died
[39:01] before Adam animal wouldn't die before
[39:03] Adam but I was only wanting a kind of
[39:05] die and that's God because he's eternal
[39:07] and the only way we can ever keep from
[39:10] dying
[39:11] we hallelujah is happy life in us to be
[39:14] sons and daughters of God we believe
[39:16] that no Adam fell today
[39:19] he brought upon all creation and he was
[39:21] given a free moral agency it was killing
[39:24] him to make a choice now Adam and Eve in
[39:26] the beginning there was a tree of right
[39:28] and wrong before them and that same tree
[39:30] says before each one of us tonight
[39:32] God isn't doing it for Adam or Eve you
[39:35] say well it's there for no novice isn't
[39:37] it's your fault because you can't put it
[39:40] on Adam now you've got to present
[39:41] yourself because right and wrong is set
[39:44] before you we are on the same basis and
[39:46] Adam and Eve but when we are redeemed we
[39:49] no longer want our own choice when we
[39:53] are redeemed you're all choice get put
[39:56] aside it's not right they wanted to find
[39:59] out what it was that wisdom and they
[40:02] proved it and cause it costs debt but
[40:05] when a man of the redeemed he don't care
[40:07] for any scholarship he don't care
[40:09] anymore the things of the world the
[40:11] wisdom of the world he don't want no
[40:12] choice at all Christ have been his
[40:14] choice and that's all he's redeemed he's
[40:17] just no more wants to leave himself I
[40:19] love that part
[40:20] he don't want to leave himself he don't
[40:26] want nobody to talk him into where to go
[40:28] and what to do he wants to wait and find
[40:34] all the choice of his maker and he calls
[40:37] in the name of his maker when the maker
[40:40] tells him to go now when I am sin by
[40:43] heathen his wife reason instead of
[40:45] holding to God's Word that is what make
[40:48] Adam said his wife reason with Satan and
[40:52] then produced a productive Adam and Adam
[40:55] turn loose the world I'm sold out so I
[40:57] don't have the world he let go the word
[41:00] and take over evils of venom he lost
[41:03] also
[41:04] his inheritance 1/2 he lost his
[41:08] fellowship tree and right to life so
[41:14] when he lost his life he lost his
[41:17] inheritance in life because here we go
[41:21] he was a complete supreme control over
[41:23] it notice the original word from the
[41:33] Lord his last big man and let him have
[41:36] dominion on the earth notice revelation
[41:40] 5 when when the lamb took the book what
[41:46] was said we shall reign on the earth
[41:50] that was in Genesis let my not Dominion
[41:54] in Revelation the book
[41:56] hold the mystery of reigning on the
[42:00] earth so when he lost his life he lost
[42:06] his inheritance in life because he had
[42:09] complete control of the earth he was the
[42:11] god of the earth and God is the core of
[42:14] the universe but his son has this earth
[42:18] under his control
[42:21] control he could speak he could name he
[42:26] could stop nature so that was new what
[42:32] Jesus did peace be still that was new
[42:35] what brother Branham said son come on
[42:37] and shine for this that is not new
[42:39] Adam was doing it
[42:47] he had complete control he was a minor
[42:51] God under God our Father because he was
[42:55] a son of God oh that's big
[42:58] that is big yet operational he was a
[43:02] minor going under God because he was a
[43:05] son of God so our son of God has hidden
[43:08] tiny dust man this fresh man you know we
[43:12] don't much Son of God that he came
[43:14] because Jesus belong to attain you know
[43:17] when your season is fullness Jesus big
[43:19] brother and we have to be the same time
[43:22] like him that's why they say when we see
[43:24] him we shall be like him we will be of
[43:27] the same kind
[43:28] so don't look like a Jesus or foreigner
[43:30] just know know that you are far enough
[43:32] no no this blood give us access that we
[43:35] no longer strangers or foreigners but
[43:38] fellow-citizens having the same access
[43:41] right to every temple blessing that God
[43:45] has loosed or get the Lord some present
[43:47] this happen under a church membership
[43:49] what church should be wrong too much
[43:51] enjoyment this has nothing to do with
[43:53] that should be something go Oh glory to
[43:58] God hallelujah hallelujah
[44:01] so when Martin for to meet the fort and
[44:04] Wesley forth and a Pentecostal thought
[44:06] it was frightened to come back to that
[44:09] every lesson that was fighting to go
[44:11] back
[44:15] so YJ goes on a process first our books
[44:18] and tapes and have messages there's only
[44:20] one of the hearts of the children to the
[44:29] father's this is from and this the same
[44:38] Congo restore that gives you the super
[44:42] sensor delivers a son to talk like a son
[44:46] to walk at the Sun to act like a son
[44:50] to be empowered by a son by language son
[44:55] [Music]
[44:57] so you say when but if the blood has
[45:00] cleansed it back
[45:01] what about no hallelujah what that son
[45:07] the second item did the work that I do
[45:09] shall you do also know if it has no buts
[45:14] jesus said the same works I do shall you
[45:18] do also not maybe not perhaps no I can
[45:22] alter time and no it's not that you know
[45:23] these are the same most I do shall you
[45:26] do also because the same son anointing I
[45:29] have you wanna have also the same
[45:31] cheaper since I have you will have also
[45:33] he said they shall lay eyes upon the
[45:35] sick and they shall recover
[45:37] he said these signs shall follow them
[45:38] that believe God never change that
[45:42] that's still inside the Bible
[45:44] science-loving tonight or calling about
[45:48] miracles tonight deliverance tonight
[45:52] healing tonight I have no kitchen to
[45:55] postpone it or get the Lord a shout
[45:58] i disown it you're telling me I carry
[46:06] for ii see on the heel of corsica that
[46:08] healed because jesus christ my battle
[46:11] tell me it's the same yesterday today
[46:14] and forever but put them at your knees
[46:19] you know or give the Lord a shot whether
[46:21] through the tree that gotta get up
[46:27] or glory the gone right now they talk to
[46:30] not the devil his children of the devil
[46:32] of your husband of the telogen family
[46:35] not the devil Oh tell your wife although
[46:38] I'm talking about you hold on IRA I'm
[46:40] talking about the God of War hallelujah
[46:44] praise God praise God
[46:47] [Music]
[46:50] so Adam lost his inheritance the earth
[46:53] it passed from his hand to the one is so
[46:56] low to Satan the earth but it so
[47:01] happened it passes all he did which was
[47:07] the book therefore his eternal life his
[47:14] right to the Tree of Life
[47:16] he's right to the earth was forfeited
[47:21] and went into the hands of Satan it
[47:25] passed into the hands of Satan so Satan
[47:29] is in touch and the Bible call him the
[47:33] Prince of the power of the air
[47:36] but his in charge is temporary because
[47:40] Jesus rejected his offer to bow down and
[47:44] come on the earth without paying the
[47:47] price or we shall be shortened tonight
[47:50] or glory over and the only reason Jesus
[47:54] didn't keep and taste-off is because he
[47:57] had power Jesus enters over the lust of
[47:59] the eyes over the lust of the flesh and
[48:01] the pride of life if Jesus did not power
[48:05] over the lust of the eyes when sense it
[48:08] and put on his full screen
[48:09] I'm sure Jesus all the pics of the world
[48:12] he was gonna give him because porn
[48:14] authority is what man loved us all how
[48:17] all they are family they built a house
[48:20] if he got the more money the more dance
[48:22] team or that
[48:29] because power give people access over
[48:32] others when a government take full power
[48:38] the column dictators rule as the man
[48:43] they control in your life I'm
[48:46] controlling what you eat and what your
[48:47] way and everything else power that's
[48:51] what man longed for that by sitting and
[48:53] a fool when he recognized Jesus overcome
[48:56] not stone a stone into bread and won't
[48:59] come the second one he say come come
[49:00] come it is also written instead I give
[49:02] my word orphan all he tried to give
[49:06] Jesus a offer but still connected to
[49:10] self he said the angel shall give us
[49:12] charge over thee that's written if you
[49:13] jump off the building and you know the
[49:15] engine will hold you up
[49:17] so so show yourself short form show your
[49:21] best dress the best sheet your best tie
[49:25] so who you are but Jesus is not the
[49:29] authority to obey the devil so he drop
[49:32] it on him thou shalt not worship the
[49:33] Lord he'll only wish to the Lord thy God
[49:35] and him only because all the devils
[49:37] worship you know you couldn't get it in
[49:39] heaven he tried to undercut Jesus on
[49:41] earth to see if he could get some
[49:43] terrorists Porsche
[49:44] he people get a governor yet you know
[49:47] but when jesus paid the price
[49:53] Jesus was telling the devil the sons of
[49:57] God is going to come back to have access
[50:00] grant in the last days I'm going to run
[50:03] you all they're going to drive you all
[50:06] different tests - you own it no stopping
[50:10] us now or get the Lord Asano's message
[50:16] believer I'm coming to be restored back
[50:19] into full access okay the Lord I show we
[50:24] are going back online

[50:36] see what you see you say a sin Watson
[50:39] you could see what's in do people right
[50:41] showing off in an offline condition
[50:43] because you can't communicate but going
[50:46] to carry late in a Backson condition so
[50:48] you get to HOF you're currently can't
[50:50] communicate it's just you annum you're
[50:53] on your own you know a flying mode you
[50:56] cannot get access to heaven's grace and
[50:58] that's why Paul talked about having
[51:00] boldness to enter into the holiest of
[51:03] Holies by a human living we so course
[51:08] have to make a way for you to have
[51:09] access or glory to accomplish rune and
[51:13] coming into his presence now listen this
[51:16] is the sunset on your gonna get on I
[51:18] tell you this this is not dysfunctional
[51:20] we have a question to answer he said
[51:22] wish have more authority I ain't on the
[51:25] pulpit or angel in heaven this an angel
[51:31] in the pulpit because the engine
[51:32] approvals the Sun or candle or - how did
[51:37] you hear what we're talking about
[51:38] tonight why are the fall
[51:47] the reason the fall is if there was
[51:50] nothing lost to be safe he actually
[51:52] should be a father we know it and he
[51:54] attributed their healer
[51:55] there was nothing lost that was sick the
[51:57] only thing he could do was to make man
[51:59] on the Beast the free world agency
[52:00] knowing that he will do it
[52:02] God didn't do it he let man do
[52:03] themselves so God didn't push mine off
[52:06] he let man fall by itself and because
[52:09] man fall introduce a plan and you are
[52:13] the same way this morning you can accept
[52:15] life or ten life down but God made man
[52:18] just knowing he would do it
[52:19] not really not he shouldn't do it but
[52:22] knowing he would do it that he would
[52:24] display is abuse so there is nothing out
[52:27] of train
[52:28] everything is sticking exactly according
[52:32] to God's great
[52:34] and this only displays attributes to see
[52:37] lucky Oh glory
[52:38] this is displayed as attributes yeah we
[52:41] go to see let his children who really
[52:43] love him and believe him and every man
[52:46] has an equal right God be an infinite
[52:50] knew from the beginning what would be
[52:52] the end and what wouldn't be so
[52:54] therefore he wasn't willing but being
[52:55] infinitely afternoon that's why you
[52:58] could say he would have a church without
[53:00] spot or wrinkle because he knew it would
[53:02] he would have it
[53:03] God said that I don't care if your
[53:07] mother was a mad person your grandfather
[53:09] your grandmother it was crazy as ever

[1:02:19] to get the book this is the book of

[1:02:23] important book rabbana here is the book

[1:02:41] redemption here is there we go
[1:02:44] the only way you will ever be redeemed
[1:02:48] for here in this little title deed to
[1:02:53] redemption of the ultimate hood let him

[1:02:59] the key so Brown says let him comfort if
[1:03:02] you will or no forever hold his peace
[1:03:04] and John said there was no man in heaven
[1:03:07] from worthy no man on earth from worthy
[1:03:10] no man baby ever lived died was wrong
[1:03:13] worthy and all of a sudden here come
[1:03:16] that bloody line
[1:03:18] hallelujah and he took the book and
[1:03:21] began to freak off the seat but about
[1:03:25] now here's the plan of it from the
[1:03:26] fucile the first thing happened there
[1:03:29] was a non-ferrous heaven food what
[1:03:31] happened I see the soup man
[1:03:33] what is that a mystery unfolded and when
[1:03:36] a mission fall a trumpet songs it
[1:03:39] declares war a plague for our children
[1:03:43] what is the war pad for the Angel of the
[1:03:45] church catches the mystery of God not
[1:03:48] fully revealed and when he goes he catch
[1:03:52] this mystery of God he goes forth to the
[1:03:54] people after the mission given to him he
[1:03:57] calls for to the people what does he do
[1:03:59] out there he begins a flickering
[1:04:01] message what does it do is start a war a
[1:04:04] spiritual war and then God takes his
[1:04:07] messenger but the Elector that each and
[1:04:09] leads them away asleep and then it drops
[1:04:11] a plague upon them who rejected it
[1:04:13] temporary judgment I remember reading
[1:04:17] just recently I think the black please
[1:04:20] kill nothing 40% of Europe millions and
[1:04:25] millions of people was killed by the
[1:04:27] doctrine that was a plague loosed by
[1:04:30] rats and so on but in every age gotten
[1:04:32] in judgment temporary judgment okay so
[1:04:36] watch and then God takes his messenger
[1:04:39] with a elect of the aged lease them away
[1:04:41] to sleep
[1:04:41] then he chops a big upon them rejected a
[1:04:43] temporary judgment after that the
[1:04:45] denominator and then he start off at
[1:04:47] another man like Wesley and so forth and
[1:04:49] then now all this happen and then he
[1:04:52] arrives the trumpet song he declares war
[1:04:53] and whether what happened finally is
[1:04:55] caught away when he's later we take for
[1:04:58] destroy them it's a great plan until it
[1:05:00] comes to the last angel this has no
[1:05:02] certain mystery but he gathers up all
[1:05:04] and I mean lost in them ages all the
[1:05:07] truth that wasn't fully revealed and the
[1:05:09] revelation comes and he reveals it
[1:05:11] he said they want to read it version 10
[1:05:13] 1 2 4 he takes the book of sins and
[1:05:15] breaks it know the mysteries of God is
[1:05:20] the Ministry of the seventh angel he's a
[1:05:23] mystery man he's a man bringing
[1:05:26] mysteries isn't that right I want to
[1:05:28] show you something here the angel of
[1:05:30] every age not captured in mystery not
[1:05:32] fully review for them but they catch it
[1:05:34] and went over the message but in the
[1:05:38] high level what we're really doing is
[1:05:41] calling the people and calling their
[1:05:44] names from the book no detail to
[1:05:47] understand that you see a man making
[1:05:50] noise and preaching and whatnot but can
[1:05:52] you rely on the book is being unfolded I
[1:05:55] mean just do it now because you are the
[1:05:58] words of the pocket ever don't know that
[1:06:00] now in every age the words of the book
[1:06:02] what's pelting out and the lack of the
[1:06:05] it was technical merit and getting back
[1:06:07] on line Oh Chloe don't get access
[1:06:10] Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah or
[1:06:14] blow it about the demo is totally
[1:06:15] clueless because God was using the book
[1:06:18] as a means to catch his sons nothing
[1:06:22] else is not men even the messenger it
[1:06:26] was passing his hand even the mess
[1:06:28] number seven spirits and God hi seven
[1:06:33] seven nine seven horns okay the Lord has
[1:06:37] joked in the hoax

[1:20:34] hear when it when the double kick you
[1:20:41] off line you got ninety on your prayer
[1:20:43] you know so but a man am let's continue
[1:20:51] my question but about number is it true
[1:20:54] that every Jew born since Christ came up
[1:20:56] received who 144,000 and added a
[1:20:59] predestinated wants to be sealed with
[1:21:01] the Holy Ghost what is the mission there
[1:21:03] were three questions here the first one
[1:21:05] is it true but every Jew born since
[1:21:07] Christ came that will receive he said no
[1:21:09] answer nothing will be saved only those
[1:21:14] whose names were put in the Lamb's Book
[1:21:15] of Life before the foundation of the
[1:21:17] world Jew or Gentile that's all the book
[1:21:21] horns that mystery and the book is only
[1:21:26] only unfortunate now not each one's name
[1:21:30] but what the mystery of the book is
[1:21:32] while it is calling those names you
[1:21:35] understand that the book doesn't say
[1:21:37] leave Amos to be saved in the time of
[1:21:38] the church age or my never know it don't
[1:21:41] say that it just shows the mystery
[1:21:42] unfolds the mystery of what the thing is
[1:21:45] but we ourselves by faith believe it
[1:21:50] so under justification being Raveena
[1:21:53] unfolded and Luther don't even know I'm
[1:21:55] missing moon unfolded the people were
[1:21:57] justified
[1:21:58] they saw their name and they went on
[1:22:00] sealed under certification Weston was
[1:22:03] sealed on the solidification the
[1:22:04] pedicles over sealed under the patron
[1:22:06] egos and you have been seen by the word
[1:22:08] ready to be seen by the spirit or give
[1:22:11] the Lord a show because the word and
[1:22:13] spirit is one and the secret is the wood
[1:22:15] is in the pride so for all these years
[1:22:17] god I was kept in the wood inside of you
[1:22:19] back in the promises inside of you so
[1:22:23] that when they come to chew to come to
[1:22:24] your promises there could be a bacchanal
[1:22:26] and confusion you come to hear promises
[1:22:28] but these promises you become a partaker
[1:22:30] of the divine nature because something's
[1:22:33] still in you wait a minute I'm a son
[1:22:34] after cut back on lane after get back

[1:34:56] this book of redemption what's given to
[1:35:00] make sons and daughters I thought I was

[1:35:51] always destined to come down to us not
[1:35:58] the pastor to us
[1:36:04] the book doesn't stop at the minister
[1:36:08] the book is to come to us God using the
[1:36:12] minister to bring words to us that we
[1:36:15] all come to the unity of the faith to
[1:36:19] the knowledge of the Son of God unto a
[1:36:22] perfect man unto the measure of the

[1:40:19] pulpit which has it the angel at the
[1:40:21] pulpit Paul said if I angel come from
[1:40:23] heaven and preach any other gospel than
[1:40:25] which you're preached let him be
[1:40:27] accursed so the angel anointed with the
[1:40:29] Holy Spirit with the word stand next to
[1:40:32] God in the heaven with authority
[1:40:35] Authority all powers in heaven earth is
[1:40:38] given under my hand
[1:40:39] he said now whatever you bind on earth
[1:40:41] is born in heaven if the great Holy
[1:40:43] Church only realized its power to do
[1:40:44] these things but there's too much doubt
[1:40:46] and fear and trembling wondering if it
[1:40:49] will happen could it happen that's my
[1:40:51] brother George you want to be a doctor

[1:41:29] roots and this means stop and it's bingo
[1:41:31] and green Mingo and red means stop on
[1:41:33] what that you know all these sub signs
[1:41:35] but you never went in the yard you never
[1:41:38] practice University don't be hot behind
[1:41:41] a car wheel last thing a drive without
[1:41:43] icicle when you were small you talking
[1:41:51] to a man who drive in trying to explain
[1:41:55] you mind say have you ever driven no the
[1:41:59] books listen to a listener you Judy
[1:42:04] I see how this do it or a street food
[1:42:08] ski and second Candace put it back down
[1:42:10] soon
[1:42:11] - Sonia do any motion yet always do it
[1:42:14] again you do soon and it should not
[1:42:17] emotional training the gears we like
[1:42:20] that
[1:42:21] our grandson resting so he like he'll
[1:42:23] condom yeah but when you see have the
[1:42:28] experience you know the driver that is
[1:42:32] why God have to give us experience in
[1:42:33] the supernatural that it will be get the
[1:42:36] shock you
[1:42:38] so one night brother branham came to his
[1:42:42] son Billy Paul and it's not a brother
[1:42:43] was lying on their they came to about
[1:42:46] Abraham and he put a pillow right Davey
[1:42:48] polished Billy he says a lot for me to
[1:42:50] do this
[1:42:51] exact words you see nobody business he
[1:42:56] said he ain't just standing right there
[1:42:57] he said when I move the pillow
[1:42:59] take a look and see oh this is Lord tell
[1:43:04] him brother branham to give his son an
[1:43:06] experience of not just seeing angel but
[1:43:11] to be aware of his presence so now he
[1:43:13] said you see what it is just take a look
[1:43:15] no but a Branham is a custom of the inga
[1:43:19] Billy is not so this is what a Billy
[1:43:22] Paul gets in his experience he pulled
[1:43:25] the pillow away he's the angel
[1:43:26] describing everything else and he says
[1:43:28] since that time he always knew before
[1:43:32] but a Branham said he is here he knew an
[1:43:34] inter came to build
[1:43:35] so you hear what I'm sayin no one I'm
[1:43:37] waitin on and he said what a bleep all
[1:43:39] say every time every single time before
[1:43:43] Burr and say he is here a new being to
[1:43:45] step into the building so he knew
[1:43:46] everything in charge and covered when
[1:43:48] the angels did know why would God
[1:43:50] capable of the reported experience for
[1:43:52] him to work with his father but there no
[1:43:55] intern in the same channel that the
[1:43:57] Prophet working in so he will know
[1:43:59] because he is involved in the prayer
[1:44:01] line give him our prayer card and
[1:44:02] something like that so I am seen in
[1:44:04] going forward God will give you
[1:44:06] experiences that will make you aware of
[1:44:09] his presence and him working with you
[1:44:12] that has nothing to do with the pasta
[1:44:15] okay the Lord has show that afternoon
