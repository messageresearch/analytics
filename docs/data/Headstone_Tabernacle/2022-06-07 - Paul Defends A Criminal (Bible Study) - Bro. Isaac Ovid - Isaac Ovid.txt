study into your hands we thank you in the precious name of jesus christ amen amen and amen it is certainly a great privilege to be here once again in the presence of the lord and i trust that you came on the great expectation tonight for god to speak to you in a special way i truly don't take these opportunities to come together for granted and i trust that you don't take it for granted as well it is not something that is is accidental uh i believe it is always by design and it takes work and effort on both our parts as it will um effort in your commitment and your dedication and your zeal and your enthusiasm and your heartfelt you know appreciation of the word of god that has been hidden and written and hidden for all of these years and the dedication to study this word so that it becomes a life to us and a reality to us in this time that we're living in so i have a bit of a thought tonight um i i had the opportunity to spend some time in this scripture and it was such a blessing to me um and even as you know i was reading it through tonight in preparation it's just it's just so rich and so real and it is amazing how much is in the wood that we can get inspiration from you know and something has to refresh our hearts you know we have to realize that the word itself is refreshing and the word brings a time of refreshing you know and you know you look at different types of books and different materials and every type of encouragement and you realize that there are so many things you need now to survive in life you know you need to understand far more now than you had to understand years ago to be able to navigate this world that we live in you know you have to be able to communicate a certain way you have to spend time understanding certain things and and many times you try to find somebody's skills you learn it in school you take it in courses you do all these all of these things and having had the opportunity to study different things my mind is blown as i have gotten deeper and deeper into scripture to see how much and i said this years ago how much of what the world tries to teach or bring us to understand is actually in scripture you know principles and teaching that are in scripture and that if we become better students of scripture you know our entire lives would be so different so i trust that you join me on this journey we just have one chapter tonight that we're going to spend some time in i'm a bit excited because i i'm not sure um i've had the opportunity to share on this before or who had much shared about this before but i trust it'll be a blessing to you tonight so are we ready tonight you know i wish i could see some more faces but um it it it it it is as as it is now and if the lord inspires you to be a more active participator tonight you know it will be it will be an encouragement you know so i have a title tonight normally i um would kind of lay a foundation and get to the title but uh i want a lady title first and then kind of build to it you know so for a title for this bible study tonight it's going to be paul defends a criminal paul defends a criminal all right so are we ready all right so paul is a unique character in scripture as we all know you know he wasn't always paul um he was known as saul he called himself by his own declaration a pharisee of pharisees so he was not a a fly-by-night you know follower of the law so to speak he was not somebody who was a bystander of the law he was a pharisee of pharisees he considered himself a one notch above the other pharisees he considered himself to be a one percenter among the pharisees a pharisee of pharisees he considered himself well trained in the law in the word in the word to his understanding because at the time he would have been growing up no doubt jesus would have been around but jesus never piqued his interest because for him this thing was just different it just didn't fit into his conception his understanding as it were of what he had read and studied as a pharisee so without hesitation when jesus died and the disciples were doing what they did and and we know the story of of paul's or saul as it were at the time his interaction with stephen the deacon and led the stoning of it and then god would take this man called paul who was saul and give him a transformation not just a transformation among the many apostles who were called in that day he was not just an apostle he would be a star in the right hand of god in so much that our prophet messenger with a reference that paul was the gold standard he was an authority of authorities he was the foundation upon which this pyramid message that we preach that we have been able to highlight into the ministry of peter and peter's unfolding of faith virtue knowledge all the way to charity we could look at paul for so many different teachings you know when we type the church ages which ties into what peter taught you know when we look at his tatavapic man the ephesians church and the the the the all of the different churches that he brought out and and colossians and all these churches paul spent a lot of time addressing these churches you know as you go through scripture and you kind of look at the ministry of paul and paul's letter to the romans and corinthians and galatians and the ephesians and the philippians and the colossians and the thessalonians and it's really really a mighty powerful ministry and a powerful message it is interesting to note that outside of paul speaking to these great churches and this is where it begins for me to become a mind-blowing thing paul is addressing entire churches and churches that also the message to that church also spans generations and we can look at it now as a message to the church everybody with me all right but then out of this complex or vast or powerful message of ministry to the churches paul also somehow finds not just time but a level of importance or significance to also write personal letters so we have the letter to the romans and the corinthians and the galatians and the ephesians and the and speaking to churches everybody with me and then we have paul writes to three people three very specific people anybody with me he writes two letters to timothy and timothy is significant because we know that timothy would become the bishop or the pastor of the ephesians church and we know timothy was a great understudy to paul so a lot is shared and in many of the letters that paul wrote he would also attribute timothy to be almost as it were a contributor to the letter that he's writing so paul writes to three people he writes to timothy he writes to titus and he writes to some people pronouncing philemon or philemon all right so tonight i want to spend some time i would say in the book of philemon but it's just one chapter that makes this book a phenomenon and i'm sure if i i do a census with how many people spend time in the book of philemon you say well i really never really studied our book of philemon you know but that is what the lord put on my heart tonight to spend some time in this book of philemon or philemon as it were to spend some time just doing a little a little digging why is it you stabilization why is it in the middle of addressing churches and the issues of churches there's a letter that is addressing this one man and a personal private situation you know we have issues that are private and you have issues that are public when paul is addressing he addresses the fornication and the dis and and openly dealing with matters and then we have private matters you know we have some private stuff we don't like to be addressed but somehow final amount of philemon's private business end up in the bible as something that we can look at and we can study so if you write with me a little bit and you'll find the book or the page or the chapter of philemon one there's no telling one two so let's begin to to to take a little read in there and see where the lord will take us tonight remember my title tonight is paul defends a criminal of all the writings that i've read of paul this to me you know i i've struggled in recent times i've seen it's very difficult to compare books and writers and writing so when i look in the old testament personally for me david really blesses me not that every other individual in the old testament but david is special to me personally that's my testimony and in the new testament peter just stands out and spends some time dealing with peter out of the writings of paul paul is a next level kind of brother but this one this one chapter here had my mind just blown so let's go paul a prisoner of jesus christ and timothy so here again he is adding timothy to the salutation to show you how close timothy was to paul so i want us to we're going to take our time we are going any other chapter than this chapter tonight and you can see that a long chapter but it's a critical chapter to us as individuals and to a church paul a prisoner of jesus christ and timothy our brother unto philemon our dearly beloved and fellow laborer so just by the greeting alone and this name philharmonie is the only time it's mentioned here in the book all right and it's the only time i mentioned in the new testament one time mentioned in the bible and the question now begins to come up who is this man called philemon that is actually deserving of a book or a place in the chapters of the bible that somehow this one page is of such significance because no scripture is without a purpose no individual who is written about is without a purpose so then it begs the question what is the purpose of putting in this here what is the connection of this to us why is it important for us to look at this and see how it applies not just to us as a church but on an individual level because this is the only book where paul actually comes inside somebody's house to the romans to the ephesians to the colossians he deals with churches and the issues ministries even when he deals with timothy there's a lot of timothy that deals with eldership and ministry and second timothy spirits and all that kind of stuff but philemon is the only book that is all about a personal issue a personal matter that is of such significance that paul takes time to write something that makes it into the bible anybody with me today right so i just want to take it paul a prisoner of jesus christ unto timothy our brother unto philemon our daily beloved and fellow laborer now i want to make a first observation there around 13 or thereabout letters that paul wrote in total nine of them start off with something in that first sentence that is not here and that itself starts to bear some significance let's take a quick look at it so for example if i go to romans 1 it says paul a servant of jesus christ called to be an apostle so into the romans paul mentions his apostleship he said call to be an apostle everybody with me when you go to first corinthians it says paul called to be an apostle of jesus christ shoot the will of god when you go to the next one second corinthians one paul an apostle of jesus christ let's go you go to galatians church verse one paul an apostle not of men neither by man when you go to ephesians one paul an apostle of jesus christ by the way so paul as he is writing each letter is placing his scriptural and spiritual authority as a precedent and a foundation for what he's gonna write next they're only about three or four books where paul doesn't approach it like that as an apostle not that he could not do it but he chooses not to do it and in this it is particularly interesting because he deliberately approaches it a certain way and and this speaks to us now as believers you know paul says to the weak i became weaker to be strong i became strong here it is paul wants to address the issue with philharmon and his house and he chooses his approach and that's the first lesson i want us to appreciate he didn't come to philemon and you will see how he repeats this issue and why i'm making this point because he reinforces the point later on in addressing it why it is not always important to use your authority and your name and your title paul didn't come as the apostle he is coming in a very deliberate strategic he is choosing his words very carefully he is using persuasion he wants to use influence we're going to see it here so paul a prisoner of jesus christ he's not seeing a prisoner of jesus christ as a complaint he's not seeing it as you know biblical scholars attribute this prison of jesus christ as a badge of honor anybody with me tonight all right he didn't consider himself a prisoner of circumstance a prisoner of situations so every word here every sentence every punctuation in this one chapter arrive with me tonight is extremely deliberate paul a prisoner of jesus christ in the amplified it says a prisoner for the sake of christ jesus the messiah anointed and timothy our brother unto philemon our daily beloved and fellow laborer so we begin to understand he's not writing an unbeliever firstly he's not writing somebody he doesn't know i want us to appreciate this because we inside the house tonight and we're gonna pick out some things here so he's not addressing somebody who doesn't believe he's not addressing somebody that doesn't have a relationship with this is not somebody who is beloved he calls him dearly beloved we will see later down how deep his relationship was all right and not only is he dearly beloved but he is a fellow laborer fellow laborer as a term means that philemon is working in a vineyard he has a ministerial attribute to his walk to his talk anybody anybody with me all right so and to our beloved affair now any amplified it will says to your wife of fear our sister so paul this is this is i want us to look at even the structure of how he is writing and it begins to matter to our beloved of fear and achieve us our fellow soldier and to the church in thy house so this is a brother and his wife some scholars would argue that ocupus is his son who is like a ministering son you know so he's a minister so paul is clearly very familiar with who he's writing he is he is aware of the man he's aware of his wife he's aware whether it's his son or just the helper or the other minister there he's aware that this man has made available his home to have services i want us to understand the context of the time they had no church buildings at the time so the early church would move from home to home and this special brother philemon who was beloved of paul who had a relationship was paul he was willing and he was one who made his home available to these scenes what a testimony would would you make your home available to have to church in in your home i want you to see the quality of brother we're dealing with the quality of the man that we are dealing with all right now [Music] we will have to come back to these verses as we go a bit later down why he had to do some of these things and paul says grace to you and the peace there's almost no introduction where paul doesn't talk about grace and peace the grace of the lord anybody tonight tango for the grace of the lord upon your life grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ [Music] he goes on verse 4 i thank my god making mention of thee always in my prayers so this speaks even greater to the relationship so although we are hearing this name philemon for the first time here it means that this filament character was of such importance to paul that paul is making an open declaration to us to the world to anybody who could read the bible and to philamon himself because this letter would find itself into philemon's hands that paul was always making mention of this brother so this is a trusted friend a close friend of paul all right and paul goes on hearing of thy love and faith which thou has towards the lord jesus and towards all scenes so it is very clear that this brother has a testimony he has a real testimony in the amplified he says i thank my god always making mention of you in my prayers because i hear of your love and of your feet which you have towards the lord jesus christ and to all the scenes so so it was it wasn't something that philemon was speaking about himself philemon's life had such a thunder that word would get back to paul about the way philemon lived anybody with me so philemon's life had such an impact on those around all right because so word rich paul so it wasn't philemon testifying of this what i'm doing and it's how i help and this is who i help and this is what i do for the saints it was such an impactful life that philemon lived that word got back to paul about the life of philemon so he says hearing of thy love that's powerful and feat which thou has towards the lord jesus and toward all sins that the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in christ jesus let's read that in the amplified he said i pray that the sharing of your feet in other words as you continue to share your feet it may become more effective and powerful listen carefully because of your accurate knowledge of every good thing which is ours in christ so paul is painting an incredible picture not just to us about philemon but bearing in mind he is writing to philharmonia so imagine you are in your home and you get a letter from paul and paul is speaking to you about you and this is the greeting isn't this a powerful testimony is this a life because this is not a brother talking about philomoney this is the apostle paul a stanley right hand of god speaking about him right verse 7 for we have great joy now bearing in mind for context paul is in prison right in this thing and instead of writing a letter here to a church he's writing to an individual because this matter is of such critical importance that he's writing in prison to address this matter here all right let's go for we have great joy and consolation in thy love because the bowels of the scenes are refreshed by thee brother so paul is beginning to it is it is such a craft of words and literature and because paul is writing to do something he's not just writing a letter because he want to keep bringing compliments to his brother he wants to position a certain thing to him all right so i want us to go verse seven again in the amplified for i have had great joy and comfort and encouragement from your love because the hearts of the sins god's people have been refreshed through you my brother what a powerful statement can somebody say that the heart of these sins have been refreshed through you this from verse 1 to verse 7 itself is a powerful goal or an objective or a description that any of us could aspire to anybody with me now this is where it gets a bit interesting verse eight this is where paul switches this is paul where he gets the real reason he's writing the letter verse 1 to verse 7 is trying to put brother philemon in the spirit this is like the song service this is trying to set the atmosphere this is trying to he wanted to address the real issue but you have to know church you have to know friends sometimes there are things you want to address and you can't just go into it right away paul had enough wisdom to spend seven verses trying to set the tone because philemon don't know what really coming food in this letter and as we go deeper into this study he would have been in a certain state of mind when his letter hit him all right he would have been in a certain state of mind he would have been feeling a certain kind of way when this letter got into his hands all right so but this verse here for me as a as a transition verse is one of the most mind-blowing and it's where i said that paul didn't reference his apostleship in verse one as he did many times and this is where he underscores the reason why he's not even referencing his apostleship and i want us to listen carefully he said wherefore now that word wherefore is a is a bridge it could also be therefore in the amplified it says therefore all right though i might be much bold in christ so though though i wanted to get this though i might be bold though i could have confidence in christ in the amplified it says therefore on the basis of these facts in other words on the basis of everything i said before and that's why i call this paul defends a criminal because this entire thing is like it's like a lawyer presenting a case and he's building into something so he said therefore on the basis of these facts on brother your testimony i know you love these scenes i know you have a heart pleasing people annoys me refreshingly brethren i know you have a house in it you choose yours you have the believers over and and only hearing good things about you therefore on the basis of these facts though i have enough confidence in christ and i'm really amplified here to order you to do what is appropriate i want to secure jesse and i'll carefully all right so in the king james it says wherefore though i might be much bored in christ to enjoin and join means to instruct or to order or to command so paul is saying although i have the authority catch this now to command you that which is convenient this is not convenient to philemon this is convenient to paul catch this now right so do i have the authority the god-given spiritual authority though i am an apostle do i have the order and and this is this here is a great lesson on leadership right here i could spend all the time in this one listening interverse 9 to know so paul is saying wherefore though i might be much bored in christ to enjoin thee or order thee or instruct thee or command thee that which is convenient or appropriate yet for love's sake i rather be chd that is real big man talking so paul is saying i have the right by virtue of my office by virtue of my ministry by virtue of my boldness in christ to command you to do something but i much prefer to come to you different so paul is using persuasion he's using negotiation he is using influence he actually puts down his pastoral authority his apostleship authority his eldership authority his deacon authority he is not creating a situation where he could even be accused of abusing his power even though he has power this is a star in the right hand of god that has the ability to give an instruction to a brother but instead of making it an instruction he says i rather come to you with love i want you to catch this i want us to ponder this a little bit you know how much times you have the ability or the right or the authority to do certain things and there's nothing wrong with exercising your authority you know but paul is showing us here at the same time there are other ways to get to what you want to get so you might be the head of your home but you don't have to use the head or home big stick all the time to get what you want to get because you could use multiple ways because the issue paul was showing here is i really want a result i really want an outcome i really come into you for something and i could make it an instruction or i could appeal to you in a different kind of way anybody with me so for people who want to study influence and negotiation and persuasion this is parenting at work this is a parent who could say do it because i say so or let's have a conversation you know you're like you know you're organized person you know it has packed things away so why you don't want to make up why would you want to better be looking like that i mean i mean you could tell them to make up your bed but is there another way is there another approach so paul and i want us to see paul this is this is this is paul this is not a brother this is paul the apostle with every and he is making it clear i am in my right to order you now friends this is not just about paul doing another way it is also very humbling for paulinho paul is actually placing himself in a position of humility to reach this brother he is actually taking off his apostleship garment and sitting down brother to brother with this to reason with the brother anybody with me sometimes we need to change our seats to have the real effect we want to have oh god somebody help me tonight sometimes we have to get off the chair of being the boss or the leader to be able to to have the impact we want to have to bring the real change we want to bring because there are times to give orders and in throughout multiple scriptures paul gives many instructions in fact the majority of paul's teaching was instructive he would rebuke he would instruct he would guide a lot of his teaching was that way but this is different this is personal this is in the home now this is the the wife speaking to the children and the husband speaking of the wife and dealing with the in-laws and dealing with is there a better way that's the question that i want to come on to this i know you have the authority i know you're paying the bills in your house i know that you're i know all these things i know you're older i know you have i know but is there a better way for a minute can you take a different seat to look eye to eye with somebody to help them through their struggle because for paul to even approach solomon this way we heard philemon's resume you know do i need to remind us that this brother was having the church in his home do i need to remind us that his love was broadcast and his faith was broadcast and he had an accurate knowledge of the word but this brother philemon also had some issues oh my my my although the church was in his home he had some issues although his fate was spoken about he had some issues and paul didn't want to come and hit this man in his head about the issues he wanted to speak to him heart to heart like how god wants to speak to us tonight heart a heart and god didn't just stay up in heaven to speak down to us he dropped down to it anybody with me tonight anybody see any parallel here all right that he didn't stay up in glory but he took the form of man to be just like us and here it is paul exactly typing out christ coming down from his office as it were into a brother to brother kinsman relationship can i can i can i go a little bit kinsman relationship with this man so he could speak his language and relate to him one-on-one anybody with me tonight so let's go wherefore though i might be much bold in christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient and in the amplified i want to nail it down therefore on the basis of these facts all the facts are laid between chapter 1 to chapter 7 on the basis of this foundation my understanding of who you are my knowledge of your pedigree my understanding of your fate and your love and your commitment and your accurate doctrine and all these things though i have enough confidence in christ to order you to do what is appropriate yet for love's sake i prefer to appeal to you yet for love's sake i rather besiege thee and listen to how low and i'm usually what law paul is willing to get paul is appealing to this man philemon on multiple levels he's saying yet for love's sake i'd rather be chd so not only am i giving up my power i want a psychiatrist not only am i giving up the card my wrong card not only am i giving up the authority i have in other words i've taken up the uniform i've taken all the police uniform i've taken off the deacon uniform so not only am i taking up the uniform i'd rather besiege the being such and one as poorly aged so paul is saying the filament and not just committee as an apostle but committed as an old man paul you see the level of appeal trying to appeal here so whatever so i want us to appreciate the fact church that what what could it possibly be that could cause paul to write a letter where he's stripping not just as rank away but he's saying oh gosh how about the old man give her all manner opportunity help this is so he's saying being one as poorly aged and now also a prisoner of jesus christ this prison of jesus christ in the amplified is not just prisoner of jesus christ but is also a prisoner for the sake of jesus christ so paul is saying not only am i appealing to you without my apostleship rank i am appealing to you as an old man who is in prison for the cause of christ anybody with me so paul is layering a case he's layering a level of negotiation now listen friends i want us to appreciate this paul can i come straight out in verse one and say philemon i need you to do so and so on and so on so but friends life is not always that easy paul is putting in some work here because the matter is not just important to be resolved he also understand who he's dealing with for him to take this much effort it also means that philemon wasn't a man who was just easily moved like that anybody could appreciate the context this is paul almost begging for something all right let's go he said i beseech thee beseech is a powerful word in the amplified it says i appeal to you so now this is where paul is no longer from verse one to verse seven he is talking about the man philemon his relationship with god his his poor relationship with the man between verses eight to verse 9 he is talking about how paul himself is lowering himself to now make the plea for the case he say i beseech thee for my son onisimos in the amplifier it says i appeal to you appeal is a strong word this is not asked he is pleading here he said i beseech you i beseech you i appeal to you for my own in the amplified spiritual child onesimus whom i have fathered in defeat while a captive in these scenes anybody with me tonight so to bring context to this and we're going to pick it up as we kind of go through it this onisimos i need to sort of stop here to fill in the gap because this is a personal letter dealing with a personal issue that affects paul's actual life his well-being his relationship is status it affects philemon and it affects us all this onisimos was a slave a bond servant a slave of philemon he ran away not just ran away but he took some stuff when he ran away now we need to appreciate the fact that in those days a couple things are important it's from a historical perspective so i want to rewind a little bit to bring us back up to the present it's very few times sisters are dressed in scripture we all females are just a scripture but it's appropriate here because when he says to our beloved or fear that is critical because in those days the woman of the house or the wife of the lord as it were would be responsible for the house and responsible for these slaves i want us to also appreciate the fact that in those days it's different from our day you can become a slave because you owe the debt and because you owed a debt you would have to silve as a slave until the debt is repealed there were quite a number of ways you could have ended up in this bond servant type of situation we don't know what led to onesimus being in this particular situation but the reality is in those days and if you study the history of these things [Music] just doing something wrong as a bond servant or as a slave was a death sentence just doing something wrong the worst thing you could do is escape because escape was almost an immediate death sentence now i want to begin to understand the context of the situation because if somebody escaped and they are recovered if you don't treat with the matter it opens the door to everybody escaping that would have been what existed in that day i want us to also appreciate the fact that when you listen to paul's teaching he said whether bond or free jew or gentile so paul was preaching to a bunch of people with a bunch of different different backgrounds you would recall that paul went into one city one time and they in that city i preached this before every single place had a god attached to it and they are the temple of this god and temple of this god in temple of this god and that's why paul will make references because he knew who he was addressing when he went to one place because they were so scared of having a god they forgot they named the temple of of the unnamed god the one who they know in him and paul started preaching them and said well hey that temple here for the god who have no name i know you're naming them the one that if you don't know who he is i know he is so paul was really skillful at dealing with issues and matters that were relevant to the audience he was dealing with this brother philemon would have been tied to the group in the colossian church that's where he would have been from so there were certain national issues being addressed certain spiritual issues being addressed but the bottom line is there was a penalty that would have been required if a runaway bond servant or slave had run away and was captured and worse said was brought back anybody with me so whatever transpired was enough that although this brother philemon was doing everything he could there was clearly some issues that was so deep that paul had to lead to this whole letter to start to plead for this oneismus let's go a little further verse 10. he said i be cg for my son onisimos whom i have begotten in my bond so however it was that onisimos left policy he ends up in rome he ends up in the same prison with paul what uh what are interesting events not just ends up in prison with paul but this bond servant this runaway slave this what would be deemed a criminal on multiple levels because he would have stolen from philemon and the penalty of stealing had a consequence he would have run away and broke his oath broke his contract whatever reason he was in the first place and he happens to wind up if if in anybody prisoner end up your might you'll end up in prison with paul himself and paul is saying here in verse 10 i appeal to you for my own spiritual child so here he set up now this only he was coming back to philemon coming back with a known death sentence in fact if i was onisimus you have to already think twice about going back so here it is policing i appeal to you for my own spiritual child so this itself has to be a shock to filament because this is not him appealing he's not using words sparingly he says in verse 10 i beseech thee for my son how could paul even be calling this runaway tv sunbury you see why it took so much verses to bridge what philemon's thinking was because without question fill a man with a father's mindset about this runaway slave this good for nothing slave anybody with me all right i'll be seated for my son only simmers whom i have begotten in my bonds so paul is saying i have fired any feet i have taken him under my wings although i was in prison he has been begotten he has had a new experience with me in prison anybody with me listen to verse 11 which in time pass today was to be unprofitable so paul is saying this onisimos and in fact the name onisi actually means profitable the name onisimos actually the root name actually means profitable so in writing this letter paul is actually using a play on words to really appeal to philemon he's seeing which in time pass he didn't live up to his name he was unprofitable but now profitable to thee and to me you see how powerful this is now i call it poor defensive criminal so you see in this what was once unprofitable in other words he's saying the unprofitability of this man was due to the fact that he was not of our covenant so paul going beyond the fact that he was a bond servant paul is saying in the past he was unprofitable but now this is not a unprofitable unuseful no value person he is not profitable to be unto me verse 12 whom i have sent again so verse 12 in the amplified says i have sent him back to you in person now on this has multiple levels here is paul not even though onisimas has been changed he wants onisimos to go back because you did something wrong you can't just say well i fell asleep now with paul you need to go and make it right so i need you to go back and patch up things with brother philemon so onisi must have to overcome his own personal issues i want you to see the amount of stuff happening here in this letter right paul have to know the man for the money the limits paul have to know what onisimo's fear it has to be because onesimus has to have a lot of faith because oneismus is the one who is going back with this letter so he is potentially walking into i'm going home not knowing what the outcome will be but they're going in fit just to plead to better filament but i just really like to really just read it before you do it just read this just remember the poll if your love would apparently read this letter and brother philemon would have to read the verses and shake his head a little bit you know you know at the philharmonic or daddy beloved for the laborer and to you know and he said come on a little bit an octopus and a fellow soldier at the church in my house okay grace be to you i thank my god making mention of you it was my prayer and are he calming down whatever interaction philemon would have had upon seeing this onisimos anybody with me is is this is this is this interesting to anybody tonight so we in verse 12 whom i have sent again thou therefore receive him so paul is pleading to philemon receive him receive him receive him receive him that is my own bowels it says in the in the king james version in the amplified it says i have sent him back to you in person that is like sending my very heart so whatever relationship paul had with onyssimus was so significant that he's saying i'm not just sending him baccano but sending him is like sending my own hat in other words i actually don't even want to send him back to you i want us to catch this i'm sending him back because he has to make things right but i'm actually sending him back it's actually hurting my heart because he has become such a close friend to me you see how deep this thing is verse 13 and paul says it clearly no whom i would have retained with me so paul is saying i am reluctantly sending him back because i would really want to keep him with me so whatever bond was formed in prison between paul and onesimus was so significant that paul had to overlook the fact that he wanted only us to stay with him but he knew that for once he must walk to be right with god only must have to go back to make things right with philemon but this was also free in philemon because philemon had issues in his heart against this runaway thief this criminal that was also hindering suleiman from his own spiritual maturity so paul have to sacrifice only he must have to sacrifice and filament have to sacrifice for paul it's sending his own very heart somebody he has grown close to with chains around his feet anybody hear me tonight somebody has grown close to with chains around his hands somebody who has been such a comfort to him that he feels lost without his brother being around so he has to sacrifice only simon was ready ready not happy to go back i mean no matter how what you've been through when you see mother looking to go back into what you ran away from is he escaped but unesco must have to die to his feeling die to his fears die to it and go back and philemon now gets to confront just like the older brother in the story of the prodigal son how would i respond now to this person coming back to me what is the expected response against the backdrop of paul saying to treat this man different anybody with me anybody trying to see how much lessons in this one chapter and and and maybe per adventure why this thing is in the word for us right so paul is making it very clear he's not mincing words whom i would have retained with me and he further listen he just keep appealing to the philharmonia verse 13 whom i would have retained with me that in thy said he might have ministered unto me in the bond of the gospel so paul is saying i would i want to keep on this that instead of you because i know brother that if you had the opportunity to minister to me in the bonds of my gospel you were to do it you see the appeal you see what he writing at him he said whom i would have retained unto me that in thy state that instead of you coming i don't need you to come to minister to me in my bondage but if i could keep onesimus then it's just the same as if you with me because i wish you could be here but i know you have responsibilities but oh gosh don't kill the brother don't chastise your brother don't open like a brother bless your brother receive him bless him i wish i could keep him in the amplified it says i would have chosen to keep him with me so that he might minister to me on your behalf during my imprisonment for the gospel verse 14 but without thy mind would i do nothing that thy benefit should be as it were of necessity but willingly in other words verse 14 in the amplified but i did not want to do anything without first getting your consent no this is the apostle who has the ability to order a response he is saying to this brother philemon i needed to release what you're holding against this man you have a right to hold something against him as much as i have a right to order you as your apostle you see how serious this is i want you to receive him because this is my heart he is close to me and the relationship you and i have is so powerful that even though i wish you gonna be here this man being here with me is as good as you being here with me so treat him as your representative to me drop your oughts against him and he goes on but i don't want to do this without you agreeing to doing this so i want to make you a party of this decision verse 14 but i did not want to do anything without first getting your consent so that in other words so you could get blessed from it so that your goodness would not be by compulsion but of your own free will in other words i don't want you to just release only simon's to me i want you to be genuine from your heart i don't want you to release him to me because i even tell you to do it i want you from your heart to agree to send him that's verse 14 there right without thy mind would i do nothing without you being involved in decision that thy benefit in other words i want you to be blessed everybody catch me there i want you to be blessed so that is not of necessity enough because i've foreseen you but willingly listen to verse 15 and understand this is an apostle this is a star this is this is a messenger speaking and against the backdrop of people who speak like this is it and it can be nothing else this is paul speaking a say for perhaps perhaps that word perhaps is deliberate paul is still persuading he's still influencing he said for perhaps and biblical scholars said paul in a stroke of genius stroke of wisdom struck up understanding just like hebrews 11 just like how god redeemed and justified by faith by fear by fear by fear by faith here called on his siblings i escaped he said for perhaps he therefore departed for a season he polished up the situation he said maybe maybe he was the party for a season i know you felt aggrieved i know you felt you lost something i know you felt this thing wasn't right but perhaps maybe perhaps maybe perhaps he departed for a season that thousands receive him forever you see how much stuff in this right so let's go verse 15. perhaps it was for this reason i really occupied that he was separated from you for a while so that you could have him back forever and look how paul goes now not now as a servant in the amplified in any king james amplified it says perhaps was for this reason that he was separated from you for a while so that you would have him back forever no longer as a slave but as someone more than a slave as a brother in christ especially dear to me but how much more to you both in the flesh as a servant and in the lord as a fellow believer you see how powerful that is so in the king james it says for perhaps he therefore departed for a season that thou should has received him forever not now as a servant but above a servant or in some chances you see one servant or slave that's really what it was a brother beloved so so he coming back to you so i don't want you to treat him the way he left you so not only appreciate this not only you need to forgive the brother not only you need to forgive me man but forgive the man because philemon's experience with this man would have been a former man the old man the man who was a slave the man who ran away the man who stole anybody with me so not only you have to receive him but you're receiving him back and i don't want your talk no slave thing anymore i don't talk don't silver nothing anymore i want you to receive him above a servant as a brother beloved especially to me so not just a brother either a brother special to paul so i want you to receive him so he's challenging philemon to go against his tradition against his culture against the norm of the day against the expectations of the neighbors who save awakener dice did i not only see muslims run away how come philemon treated him so what philemon starting to do here what filament because if the other people see this man who was once a slave sitting on the high table with philemon what this thing mean but this is what paul is setting up he's saying above a servant a brother beloved especially to me and how much more to be brought in the flesh and in the lord now listen as if everything from verse 1 to 16 is not enough paul goes into overdrive in verse 17. he said if thou count me therefore a partner this is going now to this is appealing and appealing so he appealed to his brotherhood he appealed to he said look i'm an old man he said i'm a man in prison for the sake of god i'm a man who need help you can't help me what onisima is here helping me he said foreign so if you consider so forget my apostleship forget my age forget the fact that i'm in prison forget the fact that that that this man was once unprofitable to you he was of no use to you no benefit to you but now he's a benefit to you and to me forget all of that it's covered in verse 17 he's starting afresh if thou count me there for a partner receive him as myself so paul wanted dot every eye cross every t so it it begs a question brothers and sisters what did paul discern in philemon's heart because the biggest part of this thing he has forgiveness huh because forgiveness is what was going to release this man the issues in the heart of philadelphia this here is poor teaching forgiveness you know and trying to get to the root of philemon's heart he said after all of that if thou count me therefore a partner receive him as myself in other words treat him as if he's me in the amplified it says so if you consider me a partner welcome and accept him as you would me so whatever you will give me give this man that's a big order that's a big order it's a big that's a tall order treat him as an apostle treat him as a messenger treat him as a style right hand of god even though in your heart you might think it was deserving of you have to no no no no paul and god true paul is saying look at this man with completely new eyes what a lesson tonight you have people i'm sure have wronged you in different ways this is a letter to you to change your eyes this brother who was a ministering brother had a struggle with how he would have seen how he would have seen you know you don't know what's in you until his situation comes paul was preempting the situation paul didn't want to wait for the situation to happen paul knew what his situation would have turned into and that warranted this letter of protection anybody with me and paul stop there no he goes on verse 18. if he had wrong v so imagine brother thompson imagine with a clearance after paul say if you consider me a partner treat him like me after that statement paul goes deeper than that and says if he had wronged thee or owed the ought put that on mine account so paul saying are not taking no chances if it is let me write the amplifier but if he has wronged you in any way or owes you anything charge that to my account so if the issue that you have with the brother is what he owes you what he took from you how he wronged you in any way don't charge it to his account charge it to me so paul saying don't ask him for it don't raise the subject with him raise it with me that's this thing this thing is this is a whole lesson on christian teaching and conduct all right verse 19. i want you to imagine philemon reading this and while philharmonic unit is wondering about the money transfer paul goes on in verse 19. i paul have written it with my own hand in other words he said i will repeat albeit i do not say to thee how thou always unto me even thy own self besides that there right now is a settling point for me paul murray amplified he said i paul write this in my own hand i will repeat in full not to mention to you that you owe to me even your own self as well in other words paul's saying while you adding up what does man have for you that i will repeat i want to remind you that your salvation was through my ministry anybody study talk the extent that paul so you see paul fighting for his brother only he actually fighting for this man life but you see the level of appeal and and the battle and and he is actually taking every taught every mind battle that philemon would have and just destroying it the clearly way for brother ornishi was to have a clear pathway to redemption anybody with me could he take a a movie almost done just one chapter he's not two not three there's one i paul i've written it with my own hand i will repeat albeit i do not say to thee paul's saying it without saying it he said i don't want to raise up the fact that that you owe unto me even your whole self [Laughter] i don't want to i don't want to say get down into the fact that it was in the service i was preaching that that you hadn't experienced you wouldn't we wouldn't even be having this conversation if it wasn't for for how can you even repay me for the effort that you label the ministry for you to be in a position how could you not hold this thing against this brother don't call him no slave call him as a brother anybody with me verse 20 yeah brother so paul now switches gay again in this letter yeah brother let me have joy of thee in the lord now friends this joy here in the original translation this joy is written with the same root word as only seemers so this is just like saying let me have prophet of thee in the lord in other words he's saying let me have this brother back in the lord refresh my bowels in the lord which in the amplified it says refresh my heart in christ i don't even remember when we go back to verse it was verse verse seven for we have great joy and translation in thy love because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee brother so paul was repeating a statement tied to his early description of philemon saying the same here is refresh these scenes i want you to to do the same for me yeah brother let me have joy of dean the lord refresh my bowers in the lord anybody with me be almost done verse 21 having confidence oh my word paul is having confidence in diabetes so paul is saying paul now started right as if the matter settled he said having confidence and disobedience i wrote under thee so this whole letter this whole argument this whole court case this whole debate i didn't write it for you to have to think about it although i built a case i wrote it fully confident that the case i'm presenting is already settled or no so having confidence in thy obedience i wrote unto thee listen listen to the appeal again knowing that dog will also do more than i say so policing not only is my expectation that you will honor everything i wrote to be settled in this matter but you will go beyond my expectation in the amplified i write to you perfectly confident of your obedient compliance since i know that you will do even more than i ask and it goes on but with all with all means at the same time but with all so paul switched the composition now away from this whole matter completely he say for him that verse 21 settled the whole issue yes you're done we we nev we as brother he would say we don't talk about it already we're not going back we don't talk that already we finished with that thing he said in the meantime prepare me also a login in other words i come into your house in the amplifier it says at the same time also prepare a guest room for me in the amplified inexpectation of a visit verse 22 but with all prepare me also a lodging for i trust that listen to this one now he switched completely spiritual again now for i trust that through your prayers i shall be given unto you in other words not just prepare a room at all but if there's anything will get me out of this prison is your prayers so i want you to settle up these natural issues very quickly and get to preparing a room for me and get to praying because it's only your prayers will take me out of this prison oh lord help me jesus anybody seeing this is on so many levels it is so inspiring so mind-blowing for i trust that through your prayers i shall be given unto you and he writes he closing their salute thee epaphras my fellow prisoner in christ jesus in other words he's saying greetings to you from brother e papras my fellow prisoner in christ jesus marcus aristachus demus lucas my fellow laborers in other words these brothers who are with me they're in the loop on this letter so they're sending greetings because they know i write in you like that's what this mean here so this is like this is like a ps then mine these brothers get in carbon copy and there's little so if you're thinking a remigan on anything this letter getting cc epocharus carbon copy marcus cap on copy brother aristarchus carbon copy by the demons brother lucas my fellow laborers everybody sending their greetings because they're here along with brother timothy who was in prison all of them are aware that is this letter coming to you because all of them know about brother onisimo's any role that he plays in my life anybody with me the grace of our lord jesus christ be with your spirit amen written from rome to filament by onisimus a servant i trust this has been a inspiration to you we will find out more about it by and by but history history records an onissimus was pastor in ephesus it is interesting to note that it is said that after timothy was no longer the pastor of the ephesians church the next pastor who came after ephesus was named onisimos i can't say if it's the same unisimos but it will be interesting to note that it was a brother who was named onision who took over the ministry from timothy so if that is in fact the case then it even raises the significance of this letter because this letter would be that known to them about the slave who became bishop in ephesus by virtue of his relationship with philemon and meeting paul in prison and being mentored on nepal being known to timothy it is just such a powerful story and a testimony to us but i trust tonight there is one chapter would highlight something to you to inspire you in some way i found this to be a deep teaching on forgiveness on breaking biases on breaking norms and expectation that would have been held there of discovering issues in philemon that he may not even be aware that he had that paul must have been able to see but the deeper thing for me is and and this kind of brings together to me what makes it so powerful most of us friends don't want to do the work i was sharing with somebody this one morning you want to be a pilot you can't get up in the morning and be a pilot you need to go and train for this thing there's a process you can't bypass the process you want to be a doctor you just say i feel in doctor-ish you have to go and get trained you have to put in you work you want to be an engineer you have to put in you work you want to be a great husband you have to put in your work you want to be a great christian you have to put in your work what this one chapter highlights to me is that paul was able to not only humble himself from his office of apostleship but he was prepared to put in the work for the sake of his brother he didn't leave it by chance he took his time planned wrote express the issues think about what else will philemon say boy if this brother come and he writes if you consider me your partner you're right he was unprofitable to you and always profitable he writes i need him you write if he owe you i will pay it he he covered almost every possible base and then say well i'm gonna cap it off by saying i know you will do the right thing and he said just in case never write again all them brothers who he know are accurate letters send their greetings because he wanted to fight for the case are you willing to work for this thing are you willing to put in the work if there's any question i'll leave you within tonight are you willing to put in your work can we pray all this heavenly father we thank you tonight for your love for your grace for your mercy and for our time to just look at paul's role as it were as a lawyer defending a man who had done wrong not just done wrong but he was defending a man who had done wrong and was making it right he was dealing with his own life and the impact in his life by this brother who came into his life he would have come into that prison a certain way running for his life his own baggage his own issues and however that transpired paul and this man had a conversation and they built a bond and before you know it unistimus was changed and transformed no doubt they would have had conversations in the bonds of captivity about life about history about their past about their future but their hopes about their dreams about their aspirations and however it unfolded uh had the opportunity to walk the streets and he could have gone left and paul said to him no you need to go back and make things right take this letter with you but it's not going to be easy but going to put some stuff in there to help bridge the gap it's a deep thought about being in a position to forgive or to hold out and philemon was in a position to forgive for the whole lords paul was in a position to use his rank card or to appeal we are confronted every day with decisions father but help us to put in the work to be more flexible as paul said to the strong i became strong to the weak i became weak lord help us to put in the work to plead for our families our children to take another perspective to look at it from another angle for the end game or the goal of redemption of restoration of reconciliation paul reminded philemon of philemon's own jury that he can hold anything over anybody because he was once a slave he was once a prisoner and had it not been for the truth of the gospel through paul's ministry philippines wouldn't know this truth how can we hold anything against anybody else if it was in the grace of god in every letter paul wrote he spoke about grace and peace and grace and peace and grace and peace father as we leave the session tonight may we come to know the person of grace and the person of peace and the virtue of our age of forgiveness that was a requirement in this chapter because for true reconciliation for true brotherhood for true unity philemon had to forgive this man forget this man's issues drop his oughts drop the issues it would have not been in philharmon to go and ask paul paul pay me what this man took it was not about that it was about breaking down issues to allow for brotherhood to continue father may you step into homes tonight as this one chapter was the one letter that paul walked into somebody home into their life to their family to deal with the matter walk into our homes into our families to deal with the matters the issues that exist in our homes between family members between situations between those who are wrong one another so that true reconciliation could come help us father to be better christians to have a heart of love and forgiveness may you bless the service tomorrow night may you bless the prayer meeting this friday i may you bless the church in a special way in the precious name of jesus christ amen and amen amen may the lord richly bless you tonight thank you for being a wonderful audience and read it again study it think about it ponder it and it will inspire you may the lord richly bless you have a wonderful night
