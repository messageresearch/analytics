privilege to be in the house of the lord i like to go straight to the word reading from one portion of scripture reading from the book of revelation chapter four thank you musicians thank you brother anthony for such an anointed song service you appreciate but anthony and the musicians how many appreciate the service last week you appreciate our pastor amen amen amen so revelation chapter four a reading from verse one after this i looked and behold a door was opened in heaven and the first voice which i heard was as it were for trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and i will show thee things which must be hereafter and immediately i was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and one sat on the throne and he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine stone and there was a rainbow round about the throne in sight like under an emerald and round about the throne with four and twenty seats and upon the seats i saw four and twenty elders sitting clothed in wide raiment and they had on their heads crowns of gold and out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne which are the seven spirits of god and before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal and in the midst of the throne and round about the throne were four beasts full of eyes before and behind and the first beast was like a lion and the second beast like a calf and the third beast had a face as a man and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle and the four beasts had each of them six wings about him and they were full of eyes within and the rest not day and night saying holy holy holy lord god almighty which was and is and is to come and when those peace give glory and honor and thanks to him that sat on the throne which liveth forever and ever the four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne and worship him that liveth forever and ever and cast their crowns before the throne saying thou art worthy o lord to receive glory and honor and power for thou hast created all things and for thy pleasure they are and were created can we bow our heads for word of prayer our gracious heavenly father we are so humble this morning to be in your presence father lord many of us had lord all kinds of a week this week lord with ups and downs and trials and testings and strains and stresses and lord it has not been an easy journey but we thank you that your grace has brought us here this morning we didn't come by our own strength we are not here by our own ability we are not here because we are stronger than anybody but better than anybody but it is your grace and your blood that made a way for us father o wretched men that we are father that you would call us lord to this marvelous light father now may you walk out the pages of the bible and speak to your people lord in a way they have never heard before may they hear that voice that voice that summon lazarus me they hear that voice that voice that spoke to john may they hear that voice that spoke to your prophet lord may you speak to each one here this morning may you use me as your instrument take me out of the way i don't have a message of my own it is your message may you come to life to your people this morning may you lord break the chains of the captives in the house this morning lord they are those that are sick they are wary they are tired lord may heal and rain pour out this morning if there's a backslider here this morning father may you deliver them lord from whatever is binding them father we curse every foul spirit every unclean spirit every negative spirit we come against it by the power of the holy ghost in the name of the lord jesus christ and we declare this ground to be a delivery room this morning our delivery room to deliver your sons and daughters from the clasp of the enemy house of hell give way to the name of jesus may you anoint the reading of the word may you anoint the opening of the word to your people and may we leave this place with a shout may we leave this place in the spirit may we leave this place inspired may we leave this house motivated may we leave in courage may we leave on another level may you lift us up like the eagles fly lotto where we really belong we have been living under our privileges for a very long time but today is a new day we are in the lord's day today father may you drop down the shekinah glory mary august presents deity himself up lord may he reveal himself to sons and daughters we commit the service into your hands in the precious name of jesus christ and the church says and the church says amen you may be seated in the presence of the lord anybody excited to be in the house of the lord anybody excited to be a christian excited to be called in such a time as this hallelujah what's your identification the hot trials that's your identification the pressures that's your identification because god is going to have some diamonds he's going to have some pearls up he's going to have some jewels and all of these things have something in common it takes a certain amount of pressure to bring out the best in us so we thank god for the pressure we thank god when we are forsaken we thank god when we are desolate we thank god for when we are empty because nothing could happen that god does not allow your trials god allowed it because your back is broad enough to handle it your child has your name written on it don't try to avoid it it's for your good it's for your education it's for your strengthening it's to define who you are it's for you to get the stamp of approval that your character meets the requirement that god has for you so i'm excited this morning because the trial that you have right now is not worthy to be compared with the glory that's going to be revealed in you so lift your head up square your shoulders back up walk the way you're supposed to walk because you are sons and daughters of the living god i didn't ask what you did yesterday sons make mistakes i didn't ask what you did last week daughters make mistake your conditions your past your mystics have nothing to do with who you are you could try to change your name but in god's mind you have a name and there's a new name coming he is looking at you right now and he's calling from the east he's calling from the west he's calling from the north and he's calling from the south and if any man hear my voice he said all that the father had given me must come there's a voice that's calling this morning and when that voice begins to speak up there is no kind of rebuttal there's no kind of answer there's no i'm not coming when that voice said lazarus come forth lazarus was tied up and he had to come he was bound up and he had to come up he was wrapped up but he had to come so even after jesus called him he had to tell him lose him and let him go he is free but he doesn't know it he's on fire but he doesn't know it he's been dead but now he's alive and by the end of this service well you don't hear me this morning by the end of this service somebody's going to be alive hallelujah hallelujah let me warn you this morning i don't know what's going to happen but god knows what's going to happen and that's what excites me because he knows the beginning and he knows the ending he knows what you're going through and he said all things work together for good to tim not love god to them who has he called according to his purpose the fact that you are here this morning is evidence that you have been called according to his purpose so why are you living under your privileges why the sad faces why the depressed faces why the poor me no it's not poor me i am can the church say amen you may be seated it's good to see you in the house of the lord this is where you're supposed to be every sunday it's not supposed to be a pressure to come to church you're supposed to be excited from monday morning you're supposed to be excited to come to church the next sunday what you could get here your employer cannot give you no bonus could give you the news reporter cannot give you the psychologist cannot give you the doctor cannot give you a move he cannot give you a book cannot give you a friend cannot give you this is eternity this is eternal everything else is temporary everything else will come to an end so we are here to partake of eternity this morning we're here to eat manna hidden man up from under the seventh seal fresh food this morning so we can continue along the journey why because he who started the work in you is more than able to bring it to pass you may be seated do you understand it's not your ability it's not your strength it's not your achievement brother branham said if there's anything to happen it wouldn't even be your prayer it'll be the grace of god no wonder the headstone will come with shouting crying grace when they wrote me off there was grace when they said i couldn't make it there was grace when the doctor gave up on me there was grace when my neighbors gave up on me there was grace it is grace to serve the lord grace in your trial grace in your testing grace when you have no money grace when you're feeling sick it's till the grace of god you may be seated so i'm under great expectation this morning and every day my eyes my excitement grows to realize that we are one day closer to the rapture one day closer to the resurrection one day closer to seeing believers who we don't see anymore because they are waiting on us they are not dead they are waiting on us they are just sleeping they are waiting with a time when we could reunite again i'm on the expectation of visitation to the young people and it's good to see so many young people here this morning because god promised a visitation he promised to give you a charge an anointing an experience with god that a book cannot give you a professor cannot give you a mentor cannot give you it's an experience on the inside i'm on the expectation for dynamics under the expectation for power because we have had word upon word line upon line precept upon precept for years but what we need is this word to come alive and brother pranam said one day the right words will be spoken and something is going to happen and somebody somewhere will dash into the presence of almighty god may this day be your day [Applause] backsliders being restored to him not overcoming will i make a pillar in my house a pillar in my temple and the bible said you'll go no more out so there comes a point in your walk with god where there is no thought of backsliding there is no thought of going back to the ability the desire the the weaknesses that you feel will no longer exist because there's an anchor that holds in spite of the storm he didn't say the storms would stop coming but the anchor is going to hold despite of the storm he didn't say the winds would not get contrary but the anchor will hold despite the winds blowing you this way and blowing you that way and when it looks as if all hope is going the anchor it's going to hold can the church say amen hallelujah so are you happy this morning so as excited as i am god is more excited because he's been looking for this day for a long time until you like the prodigal son could come to your senses because that's something only you could do you know only you could come to your senses your neighbor the pastor cannot come to his senses for you or your senses for you there's no such thing but you have to come to your senses to realize that there's more in you than you realize to realize there's more for you than against you to realize that you have been predestinated for such a time as this can the church say man so i have a title this morning i was just testing the temperature to see who's here you know and people who are absent from the body but not present with the lord they're just sitting there i want to make sure everybody is here and on their post of duty with their swords drawn because we are in spiritual warfare so my title this morning is taken from the first verse of revelation 4. my title is come up hither and my subject the voice of god and my inspiration the voice of deliverance can the church say amen so god is going to have a bride i just want to lay a foundation before i get to my text and that bride will be a word bride there has never been a bride like this brian and there will never be one like this bride and what's about to happen could not have happened before because in the back part of his mind he saw it all play out and god could afford to look and sit back and now watch it unfold because brother branham said god could tie up the devil any time and that's what god has done he has really tied up the devil because the devil can only see at a certain level but god is watching your victory and he's smiling because it looks like you're not going to make it and you know who you are the last live love the best god is looking smiling saying he's already made it he's already overcome because that's what foreknowledge does he knows the end before the beginning that's why he wrote your name in blood [Applause] and there's no eraser there's no liquid paper there's no backspace button there's no delete button there's no mistake any file gone missing your name has been written in blood can the church say amen so the holy spirit today the manifestation of the holy spirit is that angel trying to get the people back to the world [Applause] because the holy spirit will only vindicate the word and that's why i challenge you in your daily walk to apply the token but the brandon said is to apply every word don't just hear the message or say i believe the message but apply every word to your life apply it to your house when it looks as if nothing is changing apply it anyway because that's your responsibility you got to say i'm going to be filled my son is going to be restored that's applying the token to your life because full obedience to every word of god will entitle you to the token can the church say amen and that word will defeat the enemy any place anytime under any condition can the church say amen so wonderful so we read the scripture about john having an experience with god and john is very interesting because the more i find myself in the scripture i find it's it's so powerful what is said and what is not said and when you really go deeper when you look at david and you look at caleb and you look at through the old and the new testament the experiences that these men of god had gone through and this book of revelation i believe was written over a period of about three years and john found himself on the isle of patmos found himself in exile because they didn't know what to do with him they tried boiling him in oil and they couldn't kill him they tried throwing him out and doing this to him brother branham said they call him a witch but that didn't stop him and after about 62 years after the crucifixion he is banished to the isle of patmos with with criminals because it's an exiled island where where the worst of the criminals find themselves he was not like the others he wasn't there for robbery he wasn't there for killing somebody he wasn't there but the bible said he was there for the word of god and the testimony of jesus christ what a reason to be in prison what a reason to be in exile the bible didn't tell us if there were other brothers to encourage him if he had a prayer group but what we know he was there by himself and and he's struggling because it's not easy he wasn't on a couch or a hammock but in that exile state he would have been working it would have been a hard experience it would have been a tough experience it would have been a rugged place i don't know if he had a day off or not but the bible said it was the lord's day and he was in the spirit of the lord's day his prison didn't stop him from being in the spirit his prison didn't stop him from worshiping his prison didn't stop him for recognizing that it was the lord's day he might have had a hard day before but that didn't change the fact that he was in the lord's day can the church say amen blessed be the name is everybody with me this morning so your situation your circumstance your problem your trial is no excuse hallelujah hallelujah and while he was there the bible said he heard a voice say come up hither and when john heard that voice the bible says immediately he was in the spirit i want to drop off something to you this morning it's one thing when you're in the spirit because you're prayed up and you're in the spirit because you're in the word but when you hear that voice speak to you directly immediately you get in the spirit you can't put it on it it's not a show it has nothing to do with anybody else but there's power in that voice and if that voice he said it was the first voice it was the same voice he heard in in revelation 1 it was the same voice and that voice said come up heather john i know you have the holy ghost john i know you are chosen john i know you're anointed but i got something more to show you i got something higher to show you so come up hither come above your situation come above your problem don't exist down there the isle of patmos something i don't want to talk to you when you're down here in your dumps you come up here come up hither raise up get shake yourself up come up heather i got something i want to show you i can't show you when you're in your pity party i can't show you when you focus on your family i can't show you when you focus on the jobs will come up hither can the church say amen oh blessed be the name of the lord oh hallelujah there's john by himself john has nobody with him he is there in isolation he is forsaken he is alone he is in exile there's nobody say come on john you can make it john is there by himself but he doesn't forget who he he is there by himself and he doesn't forget where he comes from john is there by himself and while he's there working i'm sure he can remember hearing jesus in matthew 16 saying who do men say that i am john is there but he's connected to who he is because nothing could shake him but the branham said god had to allow john to reach into that condition for us to have a book of revelation so if god would let john go through that hard trial for us to have a book of revelation so we can know what's about to happen what do you think god will do for you and your family what will god pass you through you don't hear me this morning you may be seated and john if you could dare say you know the bible said east jacob i love you so i hate it god is sovereign he could do whatever he wants but out of all the disciples we hear a lot about peter and peter's fate but john was the one they said jesus loved in fact his love for john was so much that the disciple asks what will happen to this one call john and jesus said to them what is it to thee if he tarries until i come and those brothers say but wait i look like john will never die jesus loved john so much just this journey and this same john god allowed him to be exiled persecuted beard a reproach of isolation nobody to preach to nobody to preach to him he's in solitude but many times god has to strip everything away from us to get our attention and while john is there on the lord's day of voices of his come up heather i gotta show you something that's about to take place can the church say man someone encourage you something no matter where you are right now there's a higher place for you no matter your position how long you've been in the message how long even the christian days higher for you this morning there's more power there's more grace there's more anointing there's more spilling there's waved after wave after wave so i encourage you this morning to come up hither john was being brought to a place he'd never been before and in that place he saw mirrors of redeemed people he was caught up he saw the throne room and he saw somebody on the throne and you recognize that king on the throne can the church say amen and brother branham he typed it out in the book revelation chapter 4 chapter 1 and chapter 2 and he speaks about after this i looked and behold a door was open in heaven and the first voice which i heard was as it were for trumpet he said that trumpet is the voice of god it's a it's a voice of war saying come up hither i will show thee things which must be hereafter there was no secret god was keeping back from john and the bible said immediately i was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and one sat on the throne and brother branham said that everything was tied up in that room that that throne room he said it was lightning and thunders and flashings he said it was not a throne of mercy it was a throne of judgment he said because at that point in time it was after the church ages but he said right now that throne has blood over it so because of the blood on the throne that throne is now a mercy seat that if you want mercy you could go to the throne but at that time because john represented a bride and john being called to come up hither was a type of the rapture but before the rapture could take place there's blood there's blood on the throne there's mercy on the throne come all ye who are heavy laden and i will give you rest there's mercy for you there's mercy for your family can the church say man he may be seated on the throne the bible speaks about jasper and sanding speak about the throne and speak about the stone that speak about the types under the brandon said you can run it through the scripture a few weeks ago when we were speaking about caleb we talked about how whenever those hebrew mothers would give birth and say e frame and they would say their name they were positionally placing that child in the promised land do you remember then when manasseh and judah and siemian when the name was called they were being cried out in bird pain but not only would they be in place but the pranam said that their birth also came with a stone and that stone was going to represent every tribe so the high priest when he had the urim thumb him there were 12 stones which represented the 12 tribes so whenever you have a prophecy or a dream you bring it before the high priest and when you stood before the high priest and you prophesied or you told whatever experience you had if it was of god a supernatural light would flash over the urim thumb and if all 12 stones lit up then they knew it was of god that was god's way of showing them that is of god can the church say amen and brother pranam said when john stood in the throne room and he's looking at this whole display of stuff that's about to happen god was tying the old testament and the new testament to beginning at the end and he said jasper and sardine represented the stones from the old patriarchs from the first born to the last born god was showing john that he is the alpha and he is the omega he is the beginning he is the ending and john is standing there seeing emerald seeing amber seeing god's deity cena 24 the four peace and the 24 ella's and seeing what's about to happen [Applause] you may be seated and brother branham and preaching these two messages he said these messages have to stabilize you it's not just to come to you to say i'm happy i'm joyful no it just stabilizes you for you to understand that you are part of a royal priesthood that you are royal seeds of abraham and if you are a child of the king you have to walk like one you have to talk like one you have to be in the spirit you have to walk in the spirit [Applause] so i pray this morning the same voice that john heard that said come up hither that same voice will speak to your heart this morning it's a same voice that lazarus heard it's the same voice that when the boat was rocking and jesus was asleep and they thought they were going to tie and they don't know what to do they said let's wake jesus the winds are contrary all hell is against me when they walk jesus jesus looked at them what you worried about peace be still and he turned back and went back to sleep he didn't even wonder how it was gonna work out because when he spoke something has to happen and the disciples ask themselves a question what manner of man is this we have never seen man like this before no book has it no encyclopedia has it what manner of man is this that even the winds and the seas obey him but it was that voice it was that same voice that said let there be light that same voice is the voice that called john that's the voice that called you because you couldn't be here this morning if the father didn't call you he called your name and you answered can the church say amen hallelujah hallelujah you may be seated oh blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah so you couldn't even be here this morning unless god called you you couldn't be here this morning unless you heard your name because there are many people who won this there are people who want to be free but they cannot be free because they are not predestinated to be free there are people in the nomination in churches having a form of godliness they want to be in church they are religious people but they are not predestinated their names have not been called but not you your names have been called out brother branham's message a shout message was to call names his message was a message of name calling and whenever you hear your name there's got to be something on the inside that has to respond you may be seated oh hallelujah hallelujah you may be seated have you ever been walking down the street and somebody called a name but it sounds like your name maybe you don't know who they are but but maybe anthony you're walking down the street and hear somebody say tony and you look around and and you're wondering if it's you but there's another person that they're calling but it's something inside you have to respond because since you know yourself you have responded to that name well that's what's going on this morning whenever we hear adoption whenever you hear perfectionists whenever you hear the holy ghost summit but that's that's the only name and overcomer you turn around you gotta be talking about me more than a conqueror who's calling my name who's calling my name this morning son of the king that's high priest can the church say man am i talking to anybody this morning do you recognize who you are that's why brother branham said the moment the bride recognizes who she is it'll be a national showdown the devil is finished [Applause] every word every promise every promise in the book is mine you may be cheated so i want to challenge you it's so powerful because the bible said life and debt is in the power of the tongue i don't want you answer to high blood pressure no more don't answer the diabetes no more don't answer to feed me that's not your name don't answer to being tired i am depressed you do you can't say that that's not your name i'm backslidden that's not your name who are you who are you this morning you are not jacob you are israel that's who you are maybe you didn't know it but it's time we recognize who we are [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to god i'm an overcomer i am more than a conqueror i am victorious i am healed my son is delivered speaking present tense we have gone past will be we are speaking it as it was lazarus come forth it's not a question it's not a request it's a command because we know who we are [Applause] hallelujah you may be seated what's happening this morning we are climbing higher we are responding to the world come up heather come out of your condition come out of your sin come out of condemnation come out of your past you may be seated it's messages like these the prophet would speak and people were you know what put down their wheelchair because he would speak to them and they'd realize wait a minute this sickness is not my name it's not who i am this lust this demon this spirit that's not who i am house of hell give way to the name of jesus hallelujah hallelujah my john a type of the bride is there in the throne room and we have an appointment with the throne room to him that overcome it will sit with me in my throne you are part of him as much as he is part of you how could my hand be upset to the rest of my body it's a part of me it's an extension of who i am you might not see my face but my hand is still my hand and you might think you are the least part of the body but you are part of the body and wherever the body goes you have to go you don't hear me this morning so if my foot is giving trouble he can say i'm staying here and the rest of the body is going here so even if i have to use a crutches or use a sling you're still going i don't even got the idea it doesn't matter what if you had a little finger in the body that's giving trouble this morning you're still going because you can't even separate yourself from the body if you wanted to so the rest of us we are carrying you because you are part of the [Applause] so there's some little fingers in here this morning they don't think they're much and they're helping little trials but you know what you're still going because the head christ himself has taken property has taken ownership have taken command of the body and the body has got to go wherever the head goes he is head of the church christ is head of the church you may be seated this position this place this morning that we have reserved for us we have not or cannot obtain it by good works it's not merit i'm not standing here by merit i'm not standing here by works i'm standing by the grace of god and i stand here because it's been purchased by the blood of jesus it has been paid for i am property of somebody i belong to somebody that's why when the devil touches me he has to get permission to touch me because i don't belong to him he has to get permission a permission slip can i mess with isaac can i mess with brother george can i try him and see what he's made of and you know what god does no problem [Applause] because he's just like job he's just like job try him take away what you want from him [Applause] you may be seated when you really look at job brother knights it's really a perplexing situation you know because god started holding in him god started holding him he said satan where are you he's here walking to and through just up and down you know when you have a child like just cast it still just run in here dear move this touch this pull this down see come come come come come have you considered terrorizing bothering stressing out this man called job i thought about it but when i look at the hedge when i look at the protection when i look at the anointing when i look at the way job walks and the way job talks and job's prayer life and the way job encourages himself i tell myself not that one so by the night god say all right i'll remove the hedge i'll remove the protection go touch him just don't touch his life do what you want to him and i'll give you mine and go out smiling am i ready here today i know why sanju the god is boasting because he's proud no matter what the pressure is you lose the car you lose five tires and you're driving on an iron you're still smiling the point was why why are you smiling you have no idea though he's slimy yet still like [Applause] and you know like your notifications on your phone you get one email you get a whatsapp get a text to get everything one after the next they bring any report for job animals your children the farm the truck break down the bank account frozen the credit card not working the max trip not working your car pay for this you can do that your country doctor canceled every god and god is smiling because his strength is made perfect in our weakness because when you think it's about you it's about him that's why he said for his namesake you see god doesn't play with his name you know you see years ago there were no written contracts there were no written there were no lawyers who would say sign here inside here your name was your bond so when you tell somebody i will buy that land that was the contract your word was your bond and because you want to protect your word which is your name you would make everything happen to make that transaction happen and god is very old school so when he says i'm gonna deliver you for his namesake he's gonna do it when he said you're gonna get the holy ghost for his namesake because he can't lie and he never did it and he can't start no so when he said you're gonna be adopted for his name's sake he has got to do it can the church say amen [Applause] so we are predestinated friends to climb higher from fate all the way to charity can the church say amen come up hither predestinated until such a time as this god allowed you to come into your family come into your neighborhood go to the school you went through go to the jobs you went through meet the people that you met all of that to bring you to a spot for you to climb higher to climb out of your condition can the church say man remember that branham said in the message revelation chapter four in part one he said this fourth chapter is right after the layer the laodicean church age and he said the leonardo sanchez is the most messed up church age of every age he said you know why because this church that was supposed to be christ church put jesus outside of the church could you imagine you build something and it's yours and your people put you out in the business world steve jobs started apple company and for years apple was being built he wasn't going too well then they threw him out the company and they tried for years and he recognized they need to bring him back in and it's only when they brought him back in the company did better than it ever did before and here it is jesus builds his church inaudible pentecost and through the passage of time by the laodicean church age he's not invited into the church he meets a closed door and he's forced to say behold i stand at the door and knock and if any man would open i will come and support him and after that passage brother branham said here we find john in chapter 4 dealing with the god of heaven being put out of his own church john on the isle of patmos as it were 30 miles from the coast about 15 miles round about and it was an exile for the romans to put prisoners out there but the random said and john was out there for what what did he do did he steal something no they put him out there because he was disturbed when the people are doing something even though he was there for the word of god and his testimony for preaching the gospel [Applause] make let that be your testimony that you are persecuted because you stood for the gospel you stood for the truth you stood for what is right can the church see amen and begin the fourth chapter after this i looked and behold the door was open in heaven and the first voice which i heard was as there were a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and i will show the things which must be hereafter and by the brand i said we're going to take it verse by verse he said i've got a lot of scriptures here that i want to get to you he said and all this from hereafter now will be pertaining will take place on earth after the rapture of the church you see after the rapture this is going back now to pick up israel after the church age after the ages of the church and then he goes on to talk about the marriage of the lamb in this great wedding let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife had made herself ready so but abandonment using all of this to create a sense of urgency and it's but over preach last week it's later than we think amen and we must know exactly where we stand because if we don't because i'm taught as teaching places the believer so you have to understand your position understand where we are at so you know what you need to do remember the brand said blessed are they which are called to the marriage supper of the lamb there's going to be a meeting in the air one of these days in that sweet sweet bye and bye just stay ready keep yourself ready purge your heart from all evil thinking have faith in god no matter how dark it looks how many laps and makes fun and says you're making a mistake keep right on living holy and living for god just keep more moving on the hour will [Applause] arrive brother branham said that john saw that door remember i'm going to type it he said behold i've said before the unopened door that no man can shut and no man can open no preacher could shut it and no preacher could open it because that door is christ he says i am the daughter of the sheepfold and the man said that door is the holy ghost he said there's only one door to the church of the living god and jesus is that door he said i am the door i am the daughter the sheep for i am the way amen but the man said he said this to the church age he said it to the methodists and they turned away and went into organization but i've sat before you and opened oh he said i put an opener which is the holy spirit that by one spirit we are all baptized into one body which is christ he said that message before the methodists they turn it away they come up to signification and they refuse the holy ghost that open though how do you get into christ by one spirit the holy spirit which is christ's spirit i want to name a noun we have entered it not by handshaking not by sprinkling but by one holy ghost baptism we are all baptized into one body and made partakers of that body can the church say amen so when the brahman is beginning to dramatize as he's laying out this message he's making sure that they understand where he's coming from and he's saying john is in patmos and he's caught up after the church ages has ceased and he hears her voice and he looks up towards heaven he sees an open door and the first voice is a trumpet that voice but abraham said is the same voice that walked into seven golden candlesticks it's the same voice that spoke of the church ages can the church say amen amen hallelujah but the random goes on a speaker by that door and he said listen let me skip this he said all right he said i want you to notice the voice he heard speaking to him had the clearness of a trumpet you know how a trumpet sounds it gives a shrill sound what does a trumpet mean in the bible it means war anytime you see a trumpet blow in a war in a bible time it sounded meant a war either a revelation or something takes place and after the church ages was over and everything was come ready made already the setting of the fourth chapter the church ages was done he had done left the earth see remember the voice that spoke to him behind him in the seven golden scandal six the work is finished and now that same voice is speaking up in heaven what was it he had done redeemed his people his earthly work was finished and he was in glory calling to john come up hither he said but about that makes me feel like shouting on the eve of the new year oh my there you are see come up here this is the setting of the great battle listen to how he describes it the people that rejected god's message rejected the holy spirit the messenger of the seven church ages who is the messenger of the seven church jesus the holy spirit is the messenger of the seventh church jesus the one that had rejected this message of grace had nothing left but judgment oh while he is making ready to pour out the plagues upon the earth now he says come up hither so this message this morning have come up hither is not just for you to get into the spirit it's really preparing you for that call that one day we'll see come up hither to call to the rapture to call to the resurrection is that what you're looking for this morning to get called out of this world before the terrible plague strike before the judgment strikes [Applause] so brother branham saying this scripture while he's making ready listen carefully to pour out the plagues upon the earth come up hither and i'll show you what's fixing to take place christ rejecting godless sinners i'm gonna pour my wrath upon them watch the setting oh as we go down through the night you'll get more of this we can't get everything in here we have to keep referring from place to place how it's going to be a terrible thing for those when the last trumpet sounds when the last battle is fought when the last sermon is preached when the last song is sung and we stand at the judgment seat of christ you're going to be asked why didn't you receive it what did you do with the life that i give you you'll be asked to give a reason what then you've heard me sing that song or try what then what then when that great book is open what then when the ones that reject the message will be asked to give a reason what then what is your excuse what will your reason be when you come to service after service and you hear the word you hear the warnings you hear about the throne room you hear that it's a throne that a king sits on it's a throne of judgment and it's only because there's blood on the throne there's mercy but it will not be mercy forever and when mercy runs out it runs out he was filthy filthy still he was holy holy still a snapshot taken of your life what will your excuse be i was too tired i was too busy i thought i was okay when the world this morning is saying come up hither come higher than your situation climb out of your condition climb out of your condition this morning brother branham goes on we'll be asked to give a reason what then going to stand there just as certain as this book is written you're going to stand there and be asked for a reason oh it pays us my brothers sisters it behooves us as sons and daughters of god to check up on ourselves every hour of the day how many people are checking themselves every hour of today what a challenge the amount of different things we check every hour of the day but are we checking up on ourselves every hour of the day to make sure that we are ready for when he comes i tell young people all the time it's it's all right to get ready for school it's all right to get ready to study but don't mix that up with being ready for when he comes brother branham taught us live as he is coming tomorrow planned for 20 years but how many of us are really living if god were to come tomorrow this evening in two hours how would we be caught with our work undone oh it peace as my brother sister behooves us as sons and daughters of god to check up on ourselves every hour of the day paul said i die daily yet i live not i but christ lives in me see be checked up because you don't know what hour you're going to be someone to answer on high so when the brahman is traumatizing you say so the voice is speaking to john john come up heather whenever the branham goes and i show you the church ages on earth now come up here i'm going to show you something take place see christ had left earth already so really what brother branham is showing here what john was experiencing was actually long in the future and with the brand of us i'll see if we get to later on he said when in matthew 16 jesus said to his disciple there's some among you that will not see death until you see the son of man coming and then by matthew 17 peter james and john are there on mount transfiguration and jesus is standing there and then elijah comes and elijah and there's moses and moses is represented by the baron said for our day the six ages that went past the sleeping scenes and elijah is there representing the raptured sins and when they get the great revelation to build three tabernacles they only see [Music] we're in the jesus now this morning put on your spiritual hats this morning we're going somewhere john was standing there and when jesus told them what is it to thee if john would see me if i let him tarry until he sees me here it is said in revelation 4 john is there seeing everything as a rehearsal he's seeing the whole thing played out in front of him he is seeing the church ages he is seeing the rapture he is seeing the judgment what an experience caught up into the mind of christ caught up into the spiritual realm to see everything unfold [Music] no wonder john could write to book a revelation the way he did whenever that voice speaks to you he's dramatizing when you hear the voice of god speak to you something happens oh did it happen to you like that it did to me but i said 31 years ago and i've never been the same since oh when he said come up to me all he that labor and heaven laid and i'll give you rest it changed me is that your testimony this morning [Applause] don't be satisfied friends we're just coming to church don't be satisfied with just one experience don't get satisfied with just one touch don't get satisfied with one healing there's more where that comes from there's more grace where that comes from there's more anointing there's more power there's more experiences and john immediately he was in the spirit friends you could never get anything unless you are in the spirit [Applause] and how do you get in the spirit you respond to that voice many times but the brandon would speak and it said respond he would say stand up claim your healing but you have to respond do something even if you don't understand respond it's a sign of response it's an action don't just sit there and say a nice service you can get nice services all over but when the word the voice of god comes to you with clarity and calls you from your sin and calls you from your past and calls you from your mistake let somebody say hallelujah that's me it has nothing to do with your feeling it has nothing to do with what happened to you but you are identified with the voice with that word of god concerning you the church say amen hallelujah remember the brahmana is dramatizing i want you to understand i want you to pick from this for your own walk god cannot but ibraheem said god will not come down to your level he said you have to come up to god's level and for you to climb higher you have to let go all the weights in your life that are keeping you down for some of us it's our job for some of us that were excuses someone says our past is whatever it is it doesn't matter what it is because each of us are different individuals you gotta know what it is in your life that's weighing you down and you gotta drop it today that you become so light that when the rapture comes there's no hindrance there's no obstacle there's nothing stopping you you are ready to go don't be so attached to your house to your car to your reputation to no because you want to go somewhere this world is destined to be destroyed heaven and earth will pass away [Applause] [Music] i john the same john as the one who saw that holy city that same john saw the earth saw the atmosphere being burnt up the same john we were talking about saw that new city coming into view that's him john saw tens and thousands time thousands of worshippers saying holy holy holy that same john saw the 24 ella's throw down their crowns that same son so behold the wild the life the wife of the lamb [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah so what are you saying preacher john he saw you yes yes he saw you he saw you he saw you in the rapture he saw you in the wedding supper he saw the things here after so shake yourself this morning and climb higher climb higher and give god praise because you are going to make it oh my oh glory you may be cheated i'm waiting to see that day for when the voice of god will speak to you and your testimony will be like john the moment i heard the voice immediately i was in the spirit there was nothing to stop me from being a hundred percent in the spirit i was 90 in the spirit but immediately i forgot everything else around me i don't know if john was working if he was walking if he was praying but when that voice called his name immediately he was in the spirit bring us that kind of a service where the voice of god the voice of the archangel where christ himself will speak to your heart and immediately you will be in the spirit [Applause] you may be seated and god could show you things because you'll never see it in your human spirit you'll never see it in your carnal walk you'll never see it if you're not in the spirit if you're not in a spirit it's just intellectual it's just another scripture there's another quote like most people in the message but when you're in the spirit all of a sudden you get a joy you get a peace you get an assurance up because this flesh is kind of this flesh is physical this flesh is natural but in the spirit it's your to your name it's who you really are there's no pain in the spirit there's no fear in the spirit there's no doubt in the spirit there's no sickness in the spirit there's no depression in the spirit it's your identification let us make man in our image in our likeness is back to genesis 1 [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah you may be seated that's why when you're in the house of god and you're in the spirit you could have walked in here tired but when you're in the spirit all of a sudden you can't explain it the tiredness got to go because you are connecting to who you really are listen this morning you were not seeing me you were seeing a shell but inside of this shell is the real me made in the image of god i'm from the god class i'm a son of god angels are subject to my commander hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah you may be seated i'm not trying to work you up in the spirit no no no no no no no no it's a little higher than that this morning the word of god the voice must get you in the spirit the word has to get you in the spirit the pentecostals they just make a noise and in the spirit of what they're in this is different this is the word finally revealed they finally interpreted them food spiritual food rightly divided in due season christ himself the voice of the archangel speaking to your situation when you hear that voice immediately you get in the spirit [Applause] you may be seated hallelujah hallelujah you may be seated but i gotta explain something to you that's why i love about this because john is the type of the bride but john is also an individual god doesn't call the group we we we we know this we have been well taught god is not about a group is about individuals so it's all right if the person next to you hasn't heard it yet but if you hear it if you hear something this morning if you hear if you see your name this morning this is not between you and the pastor you and the minister you and the elder this is between you and god saying almighty god you me to tell me you put my name on the lamb's book of life in my wretched condition you saw me overcome you saw me in the rapture you saw my family you saw me filled with the holy ghost you saw me delivered you saw demons flying out of my life you saw the house of hell subject [Applause] no wonder when john saw his name he said all in heaven all on the earth even the devils under the earth heard me shout because i saw my name and because my name is written i can be redeemed because my name is written i can have power because my name is written i can receive the baptism of the holy ghost on fire hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah i pray that by the end of this service listen you may be seated for those of you who are battling with condemnation and your mistakes and your failures listen jesus when he started his ministry he saw peter he said come on and peter dropped everything and tried to follow he picked up andrew he picked up james even matthew the tax collector who the brothers had a challenge but he said come they looked at matthew and well all right if jesus is calling me got to be good because jesus is in the name calling business come come john himself was told to come but this call that john gets on the isle of patmos is not just a come it's come up and many of you you have come this far you have come you have come to the message you have come to church you have come to the reveal world but i'm saying come up hither he wants you where he is oh my he don't want you come to church he wants you to come to where he is because you are heavenly creatures you are just like him attribute sons of god that rotated hope of god everybody feeling good the devil is scared of you brother mike he is trembling this morning because you are sons of god listen you may be seated [Applause] in the bible the syrians had a conundrum whenever they were discussing strategy on how to take out israel for some reason israel seemed to know what's going on in this secret war chambers of the king and brother sheen the king cannot understand because it was his inner circle he was talking to he knew these men for a long time and he couldn't believe that one of these men would sell him out of the israelites they launched a commission of inquiry and somehow they found out that there's a man in israel called elijah and this man had the ability to move through space and time because that's what prophets do [Applause] you maybe see that before the doctor's hand touches my wife the tumor will go down space is not an issue distance is not a problem sister hearty right i give you you are two boys why i'm a son of god i don't want to hear about the problem the trial the situation [Applause] you may be seated there's power here this morning you feel it right demons are trembling this morning we are back to devil in a corner this morning house of hell give way to the name of the lord jesus christ you may be seated so the assyrian and the syrian army they came to surround elijah and brother andrew he woke up that morning as is his custom maybe he's having breakfast and he has a little young boy named johazi and as this boy looks outside he sees the whole host of the army and he comes in panicking elijah elijah the enemy is around us and i can imagine elijah is doing an omelette and he takes his time and he flips the omelet in slow motion because he has nothing to fear you know many times in the bible jesus said fear not fear not even in the book in the new term he said for i am not giving you the spirit of fear but of adoption what are you afraid of you're afraid you're not going to get well forget about it you are going to be healed what what are you talking about you may be seated [Applause] it's something powerful when you watch a man who knows his position and knows his authority and knows what he's connected to and i can't imagine that that you maybe see that that little boy was wondering where is elijah getting this confidence from and elijah looked at that he said listen lord open up this boy's eyes and when this boy looked again the second time he said but wait a minute they are more for us than against us he may be seated i challenge you this morning to look at your situation for another time i challenge you this morning to look at your problem for a second time lord open up these people's eyes to see that they are more for us than against us there's more for us than what's going on in your home there's more for us than what's going on in your family there is more for us than the sickness in your body there is more for us than that thing you cannot break [Applause] [Music] we are the warriors we are the sons of god we are the fighters this morning who want to fight for their families fight for the kingdom fight for the power of god we're the sons of god we are the elders we're the deacons we are the ministers we are the sons of god you may be seated listen i want to drop something off to you those were angels that the servants saw and sons give instructions to angels because angels are servants but sons are royalty sons are princes sons give commands sons give instructions oh you don't hear me this morning no one but the pranam could say you may be seated right now we lay hands on the sick yes but when the suns are manifested one more time you will command the demons because it's in our nature to command because we are just like our father let there be sun stand still peace be still you may be seated so i want to challenge you this morning they say practice makes perfect so i want to challenge you to start to practice speaking the way you will be speaking so i want you to begin to speak to your storms speak to your situations speak to your body speak to your house say like joshua as for me and my house we will serve the lord begin to speak to those demons in your house they've got to go today serve them notice time is up time is up [Applause] hallelujah oh my oh my oh my you may be seated john had experienced many things john was a witness when jesus was preaching and the service ran kind of late for the benjamin it was longer than normal and by that time all the shops were closed high low was closed or messy stores or whatever it was was closed and jesus asked a question what we can't let the people go back hungry there no place is open it's too late to cook he said what do you have and i can imagine a deacon come and say listen jesus we have five loaves and two fishes and one of the anointed brothers say but what are these amongst openly jesus had an experience with those brothers they seen miracles and yet them brothers still they already catch really what's going on and jesus blessed it and yet tell him what would i be saying just share it i want to know the deacon who started sharing because he had the hardest job you know because he would have been looking at five loaves and two fishes seeing five thousand and telling himself how do i start to share this but could you imagine he takes one piece and break it and when he breaks it is like the peace come back he [Applause] could you imagine that experience [Applause] you may be seeing could you imagine peter and this and jesus just there just watching just watching john was there to experience that john was there on the boat when jesus was so tired the bible said that they carried him to the boat and in the original greek brother nathaniel that would carry meant to physically lift in other words the god of creation was so physically tired that he had to prop him up and literally carry him to the boat so tired was he that when the storms came he didn't even wake up [Applause] but yet when it became too hot to handle they decided the only option was to wake jesus john was there when he saw that john was there in the garden of gethsemane and he had fallen asleep with the rest of the brothers oh how he loved jesus and how jesus had loved him but within his own human frailty and his own human weakness and doing the very best that he could the very best that he could do was not even good enough and like the rest of brothers he fell asleep but john was also there when he saw the resurrected christ and for 40 days you see here jesus opened their understanding to the scriptures and he now possessed a clarity that he never had before because he had walked with jesus loved by jesus undoubtedly things would have been shared to him that only he was privy to and he was there in the upper room and the holy ghost poured out but i want to challenge you as great as all of that was there was no experience like when he heard the words come up either because for the first time he is able to go straight up into the mind of god because the bible said i want to read it carefully to you so you understand the context of what god allowed john to see to understand how deep it was come up hither and i will show you the things which must be hereafter and it's unfolding him things that ought to be things concerning the bride things concerning your walk with god and he has to hold all of that and watch it all unfold because god promised that somebody would see it and it's written in here in secret for us for such a time as this how blessed are we this morning friends so i want to challenge your friends as all of the experiences you have had in your journey to this day is nothing to be compared for that call to come up hither to hear that voice call you from this state into another state the rapture is on the inside and then what we have preached about becomes a reality to us that is mortal could put on immortality [Music] it sounds almost like a fairy tale but it's going to happen friends can the church see man can the lord give the lord a hand of praise [Applause] do you love the lord this morning do you love the word this morning you see how blessed we are [Applause] so i want to nail this down so you understand it clearly but ibraham in the same message revelation chapter 4 part 1 chapter 1 25 oh and notice john being taken up immediately after the church it was a type of the rapture church immediately after the church age is over this leadership and church age then comes the rapture the church goes up like john did into the presence of god but if i said my that just wins my soul around caught up at the rapture of the church hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord i'm getting ready to wind up in a short while but the popper said no you know and in the same message but ibrahim said there's hope we don't run out of time too quick here now that we can get right into this and we want to see how that flows into the human being it's a beautiful story so the branham was given a type he said some time ago and he's given a story i want you to catch us now a bunch of ministers oral roberts was one of them cecil b demille when he wrote his ten commandments i'm sure we've all seen ten commandments he called up brother shakarian brother roberts many preachers across the land any preacher that could come and he invited them to come into the studio before the picture was ever released and let them see the rehearsal of it before it was ever showed out when they were charging twenty five dollars a ticket they see in the rehearsal of it that they might pass their opinion on whether there was any critics about it or what could be said and so forth they've seen it before the public could see it all right you catch that now so when the ten commandments is made cecily mill is finishing he doesn't want to show it to everybody unless he gets some support from the preachers of the day they say brothers come and look at this and tell me if you think this ten commandments really brings out the story of moses and the exodus and stuff and the brothers come and they see a rehearsal of what takes place before the public sees what takes place and brother brandon begins to connect this to john now so he said when jesus says some of you standing here will not taste that until you see the son of man coming he said what jesus was talking about is calling john aside and giving john a rehearsal of ten commandments or the unfolding of time before the pride was even here before the church it is even played out so john was seeing it for his hand to give according to what iran said to see if there's any critics or opinion or what is going to happen in other words to tell people you should go and see this thing man this thing end up good this thing is a good thing to see so john wrote out his testimony through the book of revelation of how good these things are that he saw when he was caught up and in there he sees everything including the spirit and the brides they come he sees and writes everything out and he shows how the devil is going to be destroyed he talks about a new city so what's our excuse that book of revelation has already happened in rehearsal the tape is already recorded it's only now there's no more editing to the table i don't think you catch i don't know there's no more the tape is finished but it's even it's if the movie is finished the only thing going on now is it's now playing in the correct timing but we know the end we already know the end of the story and that's why satan is mad because he can never change his part in the story and that's why you should be glad because nobody could take you out as a character in the story in that story you are shouting in that story by the terence there's no more arthritis [Applause] but a nickel in that story that foot has no more pain oh you don't hear me sister christine in that story those eyes open back up that's that's on the tape that is it's playing right now it's going to get to the path where you get the holy ghost it's going to get to the path where your husband is get delivered it's going to come to the path where your wife gets delivered but the russian is going to come to the part where you are healed oh yes but the mike blackburn is going to come to the part where your family gets delivered oh yes it's coming it's coming it's coming it's coming let the tape play let the dogs back this caravan is moving
