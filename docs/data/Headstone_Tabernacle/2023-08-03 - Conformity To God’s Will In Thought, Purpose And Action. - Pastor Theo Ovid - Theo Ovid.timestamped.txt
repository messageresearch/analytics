[18:37] verse one to six verse one scripture
[18:39] this morning Psalms one
[18:42] one to six
[18:46] it's a long time I'm trying to get to
[18:48] this hand
[18:50] blessed is the man that wokeeth not in
[18:53] the Council of June Godly who stands it
[18:55] in the way of sinners
[18:57] nor Sitters in the seat of this confirm
[19:00] but his Delight
[19:02] is in the law of the Lord and in his law
[19:05] that he meditate day and night
[19:08] hear about this man what he shall be
[19:11] like and he shall be like a tree planted
[19:16] not not a sea drop planted by the rivers
[19:20] of water that bringing forth his fruit
[19:22] in his season his leave he about his
[19:25] Leaf notion also shall not wither and
[19:28] whatsoever he do it shall prosper the
[19:31] ungodly and not so but like the chaff
[19:34] wish to dwind drive it away therefore
[19:36] the ungodly shall not stand in the
[19:38] Judgment no sinners in the congregation
[19:40] of the righteous for the Lord nor the
[19:42] way of the righteous but the way of the
[19:44] in God they Shall Perish one more time
[19:45] let's pray father we thank you for the
[19:46] scriptures we love the word we love to

[20:00] God but Anthony we certainly appreciate
[20:02] all of you coming out this morning
[20:04] we are open for business
[20:06] the Lord's business
[20:08] Jesus said this way I must be about my
[20:11] father's
[20:12] business
[20:13] okay let's go
[20:17] I have a title Conformity to God's will
[20:21] in thought
[20:23] purpose and action
[20:26] that's the title this morning
[20:28] Conformity to God's will
[20:31] in thought
[20:33] in purpose and action I trusted being
[20:36] blessed by the Bible studies and being
[20:39] blessed by the weekly Services Services
[20:43] being played and the Bible study we talk
[20:45] about surrender and and so on like that
[20:48] and I hope that it really strikes you
[20:50] that that God really means this because
[20:52] we're getting somewhere with it
[20:54] all right
[20:55] now this will conform
[20:58] as a verb
[21:00] it's to comply with rules
[21:03] standards or laws
[21:07] it is to be similar
[21:09] to
[21:10] or the same as something
[21:13] it is to do what other people do
[21:17] to be obedient
[21:20] or compliant
[21:22] usually used with two to conform to
[21:26] other wishes
[21:28] in other words they would say the
[21:30] building doesn't conform to local
[21:32] regulations as an example that's what
[21:35] conform is
[21:37] another
[21:38] explanation of it to act in accordance
[21:41] or Harmony
[21:42] to comply usually followed by two to
[21:45] conform to rules
[21:48] if you conform
[21:50] you behave in the way that you are
[21:53] expected
[21:55] or supposed to behave
[22:00] he did not feel obliged to conform to
[22:02] the rules that apply to ordinary men
[22:05] that's a context of using that word
[22:08] conform
[22:09] so that is a a rebel
[22:12] he did not feel obliged
[22:15] to conform to the rules that apply to
[22:18] ordinary men synonyms of this word
[22:20] conform is to fit in
[22:23] to follow
[22:25] to yield
[22:26] to adjust now when Keenan Abel was asked
[22:31] to offer up a sacrifice to God there
[22:36] were children they come to Asia maturity
[22:37] God said let me see what you your
[22:39] concept of me how you see me we know the
[22:42] story April bought a lamb
[22:45] slate and God respected Cain bought
[22:49] fruits God rejected it and God gave King
[22:52] offer do like a brother
[22:54] and I bless you too if you do it
[22:57] I'll I'll I let's conform let's just
[23:00] follow you don't even need a revelation
[23:02] he did that and was blessed you do that
[23:04] he got blessed too you don't even need a
[23:06] revelation to do it just do it and
[23:09] people fight conforming they don't want
[23:12] to be similar to
[23:13] now we know the story with the wedding
[23:15] when you're in the Old Testament the
[23:18] wedding and I kind of saw it in Africa
[23:20] but it was kind of blowing my mind
[23:22] um it was in hotel and when I looked
[23:24] down there was a wedding in hotel we
[23:25] were staying in and everybody was
[23:27] wearing the same garment
[23:29] uh maybe different style but the same
[23:31] color material and the first time I'm
[23:33] seeing this and it kind of brings a
[23:34] light what the prophet shared of how it
[23:37] was in those days in those days when you
[23:40] come to the wedding you will give him a
[23:42] garment
[23:43] so you were just walking no when you get
[23:45] at the door at the door you get a
[23:47] garment to put on so everybody looks
[23:49] similar
[23:50] everybody look the same so when the
[23:53] Master of the House came he saw somebody
[23:55] not looking similar or the same he saw
[23:58] somebody with a different he said friend
[24:00] how are you coming here because every
[24:02] time he passed through the door
[24:03] everybody get the Garment at the door
[24:05] they said buying him hand and foot now
[24:07] he called him friends so he know who it
[24:09] was but he said but where is he garment
[24:11] because badnam says that is what the
[24:14] baptism of the Holy Ghost does it make
[24:16] us all the same it make us all similar
[24:19] it make us all like one we dress in the
[24:22] same garment
[24:24] [Applause]
[24:26] so you see when you have the same
[24:28] government nobody can storm the wedding
[24:32] um crash wedding crashes they can't
[24:34] crashing with it so tell Emily I say
[24:36] when I see the food down there I said I
[24:38] know garment
[24:39] s
[24:41] everybody who had the clothes because
[24:43] they were invited they may have been
[24:46] given the claw to what to buy or
[24:47] whatever it is make it however you want
[24:49] to make it but come dress the same way
[25:02] little you
[25:16] so Cain didn't want to comply
[25:22] or conform
[25:24] and there are a lot of people like that
[25:26] they don't like orders they don't like
[25:28] to be pushed around when you understand
[25:29] you want to be pushed around because
[25:31] they want to be right as I said in the
[25:33] Bible study some people like to ask
[25:34] questions because they don't want people
[25:36] to know that they don't know
[25:39] and what they don't know is what gonna
[25:41] get your blues and you don't know what
[25:43] you don't know
[25:45] say I better find out
[25:47] Oh Glory to God let me say it again what
[25:50] you know you
[25:54] know you and this is where you come to
[25:55] the service for to get the mind of God
[25:58] to get the mind of Christ to get things
[26:01] that you don't know
[26:03] Hallelujah that needs to be revealed to
[26:05] you by the spirit oh blessed be the name
[26:09] of the Lord our next scripture contact
[26:11] scripture Romans 8 28 we know it and we
[26:13] know that all things not some
[26:16] work together for good to them that love
[26:18] God
[26:19] the them are who are the called
[26:21] according to his purpose
[26:24] for whom he did foreign
[26:26] Destiny to be conformed to the image of
[26:29] his son
[26:30] here we get the next the word again
[26:32] whom
[26:34] he did predestined homie for no he also
[26:37] did predestinated to be

[26:45] transform conform line up with what is
[26:50] required of you that is what you are
[26:52] predestinated unto not do your own thing
[26:55] but to be conformed
[26:57] Oh Glory to God hallelujah and we say
[27:00] conform is to comply with rules
[27:03] that you will be the rule breaker of God
[27:05] laws yes they are time to break rules
[27:08] like man rules but they can't break God
[27:10] rules you will pay for that oh glory to

[28:48] and we know
[28:50] first thing

[29:24] to the image of his son
[29:27] oh glory Lord God not conform to church
[29:30] not conformed to some Doctrine conformed
[29:33] to the image of his son therefore the
[29:36] image has to be projected that you could

[29:59] greatest scriptures we could think about
[30:00] identifying what you're predestinated

[45:01] Hallelujah you're going to skip all the
[45:03] rest amen
[45:05] second Timothy 3 almost like a Bible
[45:07] study
[45:09] second Timothy 3 16-17 and this is where
[45:11] I get a title from
[45:14] all scripture
[45:16] all
[45:18] shout out all
[45:19] all scripture is given by inspiration of
[45:22] God
[45:23] and is profitable for Doctrine
[45:26] for reproof
[45:28] for correction for instruction in
[45:31] righteousness that the man of God may be
[45:34] perfect
[45:36] thoroughly finished
[45:38] unto all good works
[45:40] in the Amplified
[45:42] every scripture is God breathe
[45:46] given by inspiration and profitable for
[45:50] instruction
[45:51] for reproof
[45:53] and conviction of sin
[45:55] for correction of error
[45:58] and discipline in obedience and there we
[46:02] go for training in righteousness
[46:06] training and what
[46:08] in righteousness in holy living
[46:11] in Conformity to God's will
[46:15] in thought purpose and action
[46:19] so that the man of God may be complete
[46:21] and proficient well-fitted and
[46:23] thoroughly equipped for every good work
[46:26] so this scripture or the scriptures is
[46:29] for training in righteousness in holy
[46:32] living in Conformity that God's will in
[46:35] thought purpose and action
[46:37] remember something I keep saying over
[46:39] and over when Israel came out they
[46:42] didn't know who God is
[46:44] Moses was smart enough to say them
[46:46] people is trouble telling me who shall I
[46:48] see send me
[46:50] because they go ask
[46:52] Israel is a stiff neck they're not easy
[46:54] you know God tell them tell them I am
[46:58] anybody asked them I am that I am
[47:01] so Moses was to bring them to the
[47:03] mountain for them to get instructions
[47:05] for the get caught laws for they get all
[47:08] God things and Fields remember is what
[47:10] we're talking about
[47:12] even if you go on a job you have to find
[47:14] out you can't just go and jump okay uh
[47:16] I'm gonna move that I go and do that I'm
[47:18] feeling LED I'm feeling LED you feel
[47:20] like sit down and shut up you're happy
[47:21] let nothing you have to find out what
[47:23] the boss want you have to find out what
[47:25] the company wants and you have to
[47:26] confirm your action and operation for
[47:29] what's the company vision is you can
[47:31] come and bring your own Vision I have a
[47:32] bigger Vision than he bought my company
[47:34] get out of here
[47:36] they will put you out yeah you
[47:39] understand me you got to hold your
[47:40] vision down
[47:41] keep that for yourself
[47:42] because you sign up for our next company
[47:44] we sign up to watch company and he has a
[47:46] vision that he wants his church and his
[47:48] people he wants another book of Acts he
[47:50] wants a super Church a super race he won
[47:52] the same life same action he won the
[47:54] Holy Ghost come down and have the
[47:55] preeminances that's what is his eyes he
[47:58] went along and look short for that for
[48:00] for hundreds of years we are two changes
[48:02] so so people are accustomed being in
[48:04] church building and pews and steeple and
[48:06] all that they like church and a priest
[48:08] long gone Crossing front his chests on
[48:10] different things that is where their
[48:11] customers so God come now to to shake
[48:14] that whole thing up by sending a prophet
[48:17] to bring dust here the Lord the same God
[48:20] of the Old Testament
[48:21] Jesus of the new and by bringing the
[48:23] world you got the understanding of who
[48:25] God really is
[48:27] how he keeps his word so this someone
[48:29] read here blessed is the man that man is
[48:35] not one man you know
[48:36] where the amends
[48:40] that blessed is the man that worketh not

[53:54] brother Brown
[53:56] God doesn't deal with the church as an
[53:59] organization
[54:01] he doesn't deal with the church as a
[54:03] group of people
[54:04] he deals with the church as individuals
[54:08] individual in the church and when a man
[54:11] proves it's no secret we all see it
[54:14] see it
[54:16] when a man proves and God loves him
[54:19] he takes him out somewhere to himself
[54:21] dear in the front of angels he does
[54:24] something for him he lifts him up there
[54:26] in the presence of God gives him fills
[54:29] him and sets him out that's the age we
[54:31] live in
[54:32] what kind of man is that a sounds one
[54:34] man
[54:35] Oh Glory to God that's the Psalms one's
[54:37] man a man walking in God a man marries
[54:40] in the world day and night a man that
[54:42] God has planted by the rivers of water
[54:43] because he choose to catch God's purpose
[54:46] God's mind God's thoughts God's will he
[54:49] choose that and God will take him aside
[54:51] and bless that man to let the world know
[54:54] let your neighbor know let your family
[54:55] know let your enemy know that his hand
[54:58] is upon you forget them please God

[56:57] virtue or get the Lord I shout and those
[57:00] on odds and grudges is our brotherly
[57:02] kindness oh get the Lord I shout how
[57:05] much time must I forget my brother
[57:06] Seventy Times Seven
[57:09] a day
[57:13] all right
[57:15] no watch
[57:18] here we go
[57:20] you know a lie detector right
[57:23] but you're in a machine
[57:25] and ask system questions
[57:27] and if you like
[57:28] the machine has started to do something
[57:30] so like like
[57:34] when you're talking normal first they
[57:36] ask a question there's actually a
[57:38] question that is you know it's true your
[57:40] name is so and so that's right machine
[57:42] going straight
[57:43] going straight through
[57:47] did you steal
[57:51] they take on the job
[57:52] no I did not
[57:57] because the machine
[57:59] not recording your words you know
[58:02] your pressure
[58:04] your pulse
[58:05] your heart because man wasn't made to
[58:08] lie God set it up that way
[58:13] God God said to the way
[58:15] so you say I did not
[58:18] you could say it's soft emotions
[58:21] foreign
[58:23] [Music]
[58:32] now listen to this this is powerful
[58:35] the lie detector will not work on your
[58:38] mind
[58:40] it work on your soul
[58:42] [Music]
[58:44] so what he's saying it is working at the
[58:47] subconscious level
[58:48] [Music]
[58:50] not your conscious
[58:52] because some people
[58:53] when the line with auto light detector
[58:55] that the light to cover of the first
[58:57] line and the light of the second light
[58:58] that's even more relaxed there's plenty
[59:00] working
[59:01] it better it's one truth coming out
[59:05] but when you're lying and you'll come up
[59:06] lie lie after what you had a measure
[59:08] done that's how police that's fine
[59:09] emotion when they do stuff
[59:11] they still tell your story they take
[59:13] notes
[59:14] and three months after they come let me
[59:16] hear this story again
[59:18] and they hear different thing come out
[59:20] because you see your yeah the current
[59:23] memory is it so far out
[59:25] all right let's continue
[59:27] they can impersonate yet it being a lie
[59:30] and can impression it until they can
[59:33] receive like anything now Satan is the
[59:35] best that there is there for he deceive
[59:37] Eve okay now this person what if you
[59:41] could get this Soul on the inside
[59:44] so in harmony with God that your soul
[59:47] and God could be one together then you
[59:50] could ask what you will
[59:52] and it shall be given to you
[59:54] oh he's going deeper many people come to
[59:57] me many times in the prayer line and
[59:58] stand here and say oh brother Branham I
[1:00:00] have plenty feet I've got faith like to
[1:00:03] move mountains and yet they haven't any
[1:00:05] feet
[1:00:06] they hardly have enough Faith to get to
[1:00:07] the platform
[1:00:09] but they are conscious of wanting they
[1:00:11] do believe
[1:00:12] they are believing intellectually with
[1:00:15] their mind now take take this not as I
[1:00:17] am preaching something but take this as
[1:00:19] brother Branham here explaining what has
[1:00:21] happened with people and you could see
[1:00:23] what will happen be happening with you
[1:00:26] and with us all right he said now watch
[1:00:29] they are conscious of one thing they do
[1:00:31] believe they are believing
[1:00:32] intellectually with their mind and their
[1:00:35] mind will never bring them to God
[1:00:38] your mind is reasoning and God has no
[1:00:42] reason
[1:00:44] so that's why you hear people
[1:00:47] give a testimony they went to our
[1:00:48] service and they don't know how they
[1:00:50] wish they alter
[1:00:52] there wasn't a bakade Pew and when the
[1:00:55] preachers had to preach something moved
[1:00:57] them and they finally altered tears in
[1:00:59] the eye and they want to save the Lord
[1:01:00] or whatnot that is not mine you know
[1:01:02] that is the spirit of God do something
[1:01:04] to the heart
[1:01:05] and pull them to the that's not mine
[1:01:11] his head
[1:01:13] that is the one that do last
[1:01:15] you see because that ain't not a hard
[1:01:17] conviction okay so you're watching the
[1:01:19] operation of the spirit now let's
[1:01:20] continue
[1:01:21] now if you can reason out your mind will
[1:01:24] tell you no look here doctors say I
[1:01:25] can't get it over it's impossible the
[1:01:27] doctor with his intellects with his
[1:01:28] intelligence with his knowledge of
[1:01:30] Medical Science he has told you the best
[1:01:31] of the travel of his mind and you take
[1:01:34] in your mind and using the same thing
[1:01:35] the doctors told you God can never touch
[1:01:37] that line as long as you reason let's
[1:01:40] put down reason God never made us to
[1:01:43] live by our intellect we live by the
[1:01:45] Holy Spirit that's in our soul and that
[1:01:47] says no to any reason that is contrary
[1:01:50] to God's word then what when God would
[1:01:52] say this so there is nothing in the
[1:01:54] world standing its way and when you do
[1:01:56] that you are getting down on the right
[1:01:58] side of God you are getting down till
[1:02:00] you can ask what you want to it will be
[1:02:02] given to you because there's nothing
[1:02:03] between there there's no reason they
[1:02:06] stand in your way get your mind out of
[1:02:07] the way you don't have to say what your
[1:02:09] reason what you see what you think say
[1:02:11] what God say to be truth that can only
[1:02:14] come from inside from the heart
[1:02:17] not from your intellects then he went on
[1:02:20] to this year there is where so many
[1:02:22] people today is going to be terribly
[1:02:25] disappointed at the day of judgment to
[1:02:27] know that they lived in church to know
[1:02:29] that they have gone done good deeds to
[1:02:30] know they have treated their neighbor
[1:02:31] right to know that they have lowered the
[1:02:33] people loyal to the church and in their
[1:02:35] mind have believed that Jesus Christ the
[1:02:37] son of God and be condemned at the day
[1:02:39] of judgment
[1:02:40] Jesus said many are called and few are
[1:02:44] chosen straight is the gate now is the
[1:02:47] way that leads to life but few there be
[1:02:49] that find it no as I was saying a few
[1:02:52] days ago
[1:02:55] I want you to pay close attention
[1:02:58] put a lie detector on you and you could
[1:03:01] try to impersonate the truth try to say
[1:03:04] it's the truth but darling inside of you
[1:03:07] in the subconscious leaves a place
[1:03:09] called The Soul
[1:03:11] and this intellectual mind here we go
[1:03:14] does not govern the vibration of the
[1:03:17] system
[1:03:18] the mind is only a director it will
[1:03:21] direct you but it is very incapable of
[1:03:23] bring you to God your mind you cannot
[1:03:26] know God by your mind intellectual is
[1:03:29] one of the resources or the channels
[1:03:31] that you could lead to it here we go but
[1:03:34] your soul is what governs you
[1:03:37] you are
[1:03:39] what you are by your soul
[1:03:43] that's a defining statement not by your
[1:03:46] house and land it have crooked people of
[1:03:48] house Lanka airplane boats and
[1:03:50] everything else and they crooked as
[1:03:51] their teeth Liars
[1:03:54] one of the children and all kind of
[1:03:56] stuff like that but you are what you are
[1:03:59] by your
[1:04:00] Soul or give the Lord some praises
[1:04:07] so
[1:04:09] [Music]
[1:04:12] conscious and conscious lining up
[1:04:13] together
[1:04:14] to get your soul lined up with the word
[1:04:16] to get your heart and mind line up with
[1:04:18] your word isn't that right as a man
[1:04:20] thinks in his heart so is he now when
[1:04:23] you come and I think we said it a couple
[1:04:25] of years ago we are preaching about when
[1:04:27] somebody born to the British royal
[1:04:30] family uh a little child born Prince
[1:04:32] Harry Prince this Prince that Prince is
[1:04:34] this or whatever it is then they're born
[1:04:36] into royalty they don't know as babies
[1:04:38] they are royal if you put them on the
[1:04:41] train appearance they'll be trinidadians
[1:04:43] they will go to school they will run
[1:04:45] around they would they will do just what
[1:04:47] train Adams do but because they lack
[1:04:49] environment they are being taught they
[1:04:52] are being trained they are being told
[1:04:54] they have shown history they assure the
[1:04:57] history of the lineage of woman's Queen
[1:04:59] and who was the queen queen and who was
[1:05:01] the master and all of that and that gave
[1:05:03] him a Consciousness when they begin to
[1:05:05] walk the streets cameras picking on them
[1:05:07] they say stop taking a picture I'll get
[1:05:09] back so go boss your hair they're not
[1:05:11] talking that way they're supposed to get
[1:05:13] pictures they press supposed to follow
[1:05:15] after them because they are royalty
[1:05:17] Hallelujah they belong to a royal family
[1:05:19] well you belong to a royal family also
[1:05:21] you are royalty
[1:05:23] the Royal Sea of Abraham you are royalty
[1:05:26] oh the devil's supposed to be looking at
[1:05:28] you come on don't touch them don't look
[1:05:30] at me looking at you he could never be
[1:05:32] royalty because
[1:05:33] you have he could never get your
[1:05:35] inheritance he can never get his name on
[1:05:37] the book okay the Lord I pray for him
[1:05:42] your royalty Oh Glory Hallelujah
[1:05:46] Hallelujah Hallelujah glory to God why
[1:05:50] does he have to be handled a certain way
[1:05:52] so every time listen let's have somebody
[1:05:55] what do you call a man need to take care
[1:05:56] of them
[1:06:07] they can't have that they have the right
[1:06:10] tutor and God have a distributor also
[1:06:12] they treat us the Holy Ghost God said in
[1:06:15] truth attitude to you because you are
[1:06:17] loyalty you're coming unto something
[1:06:19] you're predestinated under something you
[1:06:22] have to be conformed to something so go
[1:06:24] to the first day with your thought oh
[1:06:26] give the Lord a praise her for him so
[1:06:28] first your Consciousness you are a
[1:06:30] sinner you know nothing about God so
[1:06:33] then God have introduced you his
[1:06:34] thoughts he said my to us are not your
[1:06:36] thoughts my ways are not your ways as
[1:06:38] hard the heavens above the Earth so are
[1:06:40] my thoughts above your thoughts so after
[1:06:42] God God's will in his thoughts in his
[1:06:45] thinking in his purpose and the action
[1:06:48] that God wants you to get into okay the
[1:06:50] Lord I pray for her so when you come to

[1:07:30] but for the past couple of services I'm
[1:07:33] seeing God just closing the Gap it's
[1:07:36] like a pyramid all time was white at the
[1:07:38] bottom but he says I got close to the
[1:07:40] Top If the clap is narrows it Narrows
[1:07:43] some people will fall off you know in

[1:13:24] Church of he will become one
[1:13:28] he and the
[1:13:31] and that the church members of the body
[1:13:33] of Christ would be one together just as
[1:13:34] he is the father one and at that day we
[1:13:37] will know that he was in the father
[1:13:38] fighting him and he and Us Together We

[1:13:58] that's the church that Jesus coming for
[1:14:01] that's when his prayer will be answered
