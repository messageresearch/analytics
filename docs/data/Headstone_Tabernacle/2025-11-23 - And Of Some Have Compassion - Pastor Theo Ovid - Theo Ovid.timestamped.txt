[48:50] light.
[48:51] Such a beauty

[50:33] Oh, we walk. Sing it this morning. We
[50:37] walk in the light.
[50:41] Such a beauty
[50:46] comes where the dew drops of mercies
[50:52] are bright. Shine all around us
[50:59] by day and by night.
[51:03] Oh Jesus

[51:10] the light. Oh,
[51:13] we walk

[51:24] the deceas
[51:26] of mercies.
[51:30] Oh, shine all around us by day and by
[51:38] night.
[51:41] Jesus,
[51:43] the light of
[51:46] the world.
[51:50] Hallelujah. Can we give the Lord a hand
[51:53] of praise?
[51:55] Can we thank him this morning? Can we
[51:58] give him honor? Can we give him worship?
[52:01] Tell him he's worthy. He's worthy of the
[52:04] praise. He's worthy of the glory. He is
[52:07] worthy of the thanksgiving. There is
[52:09] none like him. There is no God like
[52:12] Jehovah. He's the same yesterday and
[52:14] today and forever. He is still a way
[52:17] maker. He is still Jehovah Gyra. He is
[52:21] still a healer. He is still a restorer.
[52:24] He is a baptizer. He could change your
[52:27] circumstance. He is changing your
[52:30] circumstance. It's a finished work. It's
[52:33] already done. He called you for a
[52:35] purpose. And that's enough to worship
[52:38] him. That's enough to praise him. It's
[52:40] enough to shake out of our condition.
[52:43] Shake out of our feelings. Come out of
[52:46] our emotions. Enter into the realm of
[52:48] the heavenly. I was glad when they said
[52:51] unto me, "Let us go into the house of
[52:52] the Lord."
[52:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord.
[52:56] Shall we pray?
[52:58] Oh gracious heavenly father, it's such a
[53:00] humbling experience to be in your house.
[53:03] It's not something we could ever take
[53:05] for granted. There are people who did
[53:08] not make it to this morning. They died
[53:10] in their sleep.
[53:12] There are people who did not make it
[53:14] this morning. They couldn't even move.
[53:18] Sometimes we take for granted the simple
[53:20] things.
[53:22] Sometime we take for granted the fact
[53:23] that we are not in a hospital bed.
[53:25] There's somebody in a hospital bed all
[53:26] over the world today. But we are here in
[53:29] your presence this morning with the
[53:31] direct access to your throne that you
[53:34] made possible. Not that we chose you,
[53:36] but you chose us. And we are responding
[53:39] to the call, the seed in us that you
[53:42] placed there before we even understood
[53:44] who we are and whose we are. Father, the
[53:48] seed, Lord, has been quickened by the
[53:50] spirit. The seed has been encouraged by
[53:53] the word and the right atmosphere has
[53:55] resulted in us being here this morning.
[53:57] Father, may you speak to the seed in us.
[53:59] Father, may you Lord create the
[54:02] atmosphere for us. Father, Lord, as we
[54:04] send the praises up, you promise to
[54:06] inhabit the praises of your people. You
[54:09] said when the praises would go up, the
[54:11] glory of God would come down, Father.
[54:13] Lord, it's two sides of this equation.
[54:15] And so we want to create an atmosphere
[54:18] by sending up the praise and sending up
[54:20] the worship, sending up the glory, those
[54:22] that are upstairs, those that might be
[54:24] still downstairs, those might be at
[54:26] their homes, wherever they may be. We
[54:28] want to create an atmosphere that shifts
[54:31] the situation around us, to confuse the
[54:34] devil, to even confuse our infirmities,
[54:36] to confuse our bodies. If you want to
[54:39] create a list of everything to complain
[54:41] about, there'll be a list. If you want
[54:43] to create a list of things we are
[54:44] thankful for, we'll have a bigger list
[54:47] this morning. So, Father, we are
[54:48] thankful Lord for how you brought us
[54:50] through. We are thankful for Lord, you
[54:54] give us purpose. We are thankful for the
[54:56] trials and the testings, the things we
[54:58] understand and the things we don't
[55:00] understand, the things THAT WE COULD
[55:02] RECONCILE and the things we cannot
[55:03] reconcile. We thank you this morning for
[55:06] bringing us here into your house. May
[55:07] you bless the Lord. what will be said
[55:09] and done today. We commit the service
[55:11] into your hands in the precious name of
[55:12] Jesus Christ. And the church says
[55:14] &gt;&gt; amen.
[55:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. Before you take your
[55:17] seats, I just want to read one verse
[55:20] from the book of Proverbs,
[55:23] chapter 18,
[55:25] verse 21.
[55:27] Proverbs 18 and verse 21.
[55:32] Death and life
[55:36] are in the power of the tongue,
[55:41] and they that love it
[55:44] shall eat the fruit thereof. I want to
[55:46] read it one more time. Death and life
[55:50] are in the power of the tongue, and they
[55:53] that love it shall eat the f fruit
[55:56] thereof. May the Lord add a blessing to
[55:58] the reading of his word. You may be
[56:00] seated in the presence of the Lord. It's
[56:03] certainly a great privilege to be in the
[56:04] house of the Lord this morning and to be
[56:07] able to gather under the cover of the
[56:09] blood. And through his blood, we could
[56:12] come into his presence. Once we are
[56:16] under that blood, if we're not under the
[56:18] blood, then we are exposed and we are
[56:21] vulnerable. But once there's blood, then
[56:23] when we have an issue, the blood speaks
[56:26] for us. the box. The blood speaks better
[56:29] things than we could even express. When
[56:31] you try to explain yourself, that's one
[56:33] type of explanation. But when the blood
[56:35] speaks for you,
[56:36] &gt;&gt; then the things that you say now fade
[56:38] because the blood is a better voice.
[56:39] It's a better expression. It could cover
[56:42] a multitude of sins. Can the church say
[56:44] amen?
[56:45] &gt;&gt; So I greet you on behalf of the pastor.
[56:48] And uh uh today, in a few hours, in
[56:51] fact, he would be beginning the journey
[56:53] back home. How many appreciate your
[56:54] pastor this morning? Over
[57:00] the last few weeks, he would have
[57:01] preached in France at brother Jano's
[57:03] church, then twice in Germany at brother
[57:07] Stephanos Skolen Brenner's church, then
[57:09] he went across to Nigeria. Uh last
[57:12] weekend he spoke in Naiwi at brother
[57:14] Isaac JP's convention and earlier today
[57:17] he spoke at brother Olu's church LCA
[57:20] Lagos. So it's been uh quite a journey
[57:23] for him. I was saying it's a it's the
[57:25] first time he's he's out for this long
[57:27] in this kind of a way, but the Lord has
[57:29] kept him. The Lord has preserved him and
[57:31] he's strong by the grace of God. So, we
[57:33] are looking for him to be back uh by the
[57:36] grace of God during the course of this
[57:39] week. And we are so grateful for the
[57:41] strength of the church, for the
[57:43] officers, for the helps, for the
[57:44] governments, for the ministers who stand
[57:47] as a trained the church that even when
[57:48] the pastor is not here, we're not all
[57:51] wishy-washy and all over the place. But
[57:53] we stand as soldiers with an
[57:56] understanding of our responsibilities,
[57:58] that the war still continues, that we
[58:00] have been trained for such a time as
[58:02] this, that even if you are left alone on
[58:04] an island, you could defend the island
[58:05] because you know who you are. You are
[58:07] son of the king. You understand the
[58:09] authority. You understand what you're
[58:11] called to do. And everyone stays in step
[58:13] because we have a vision and what we see
[58:16] should put our souls into action to make
[58:17] a church that would make a revival. So I
[58:20] want to salute all of the ministers that
[58:21] would have spoken during this period of
[58:24] time. All the support the song leaders,
[58:26] brother Anthony, brother Gideon, brother
[58:28] Steven, all the different supports as we
[58:31] stand by the grace of God, brother Jason
[58:34] as well. We are so grateful for all of
[58:36] the helps, governments, and the gifts
[58:38] that God has placed in the church in the
[58:40] body of believers in this portion of the
[58:43] vineyard where the harvest is plentiful
[58:45] and the laborers are few and there are
[58:47] many and and the Bible said that the
[58:49] love of many will wax cold.
[58:52] &gt;&gt; So it comes as no surprise to us when
[58:55] people lose the passion and the zeal
[58:57] because that's prophesied in scripture.
[59:00] So it comes as no surprise to us. The
[59:02] question is what are we going to do
[59:03] about it and how are we going to solve
[59:05] it and what are you doing about it and
[59:07] what are you doing to make your calling
[59:08] and election sure because once you are
[59:10] past that age of accountability you have
[59:13] to now give an account for yourself
[59:15] &gt;&gt; you know and many of us you know we have
[59:17] this blame game of who is responsible
[59:19] and who's responsible but there's a lot
[59:21] that you can do to advance yourself both
[59:23] in the natural and in the spiritual and
[59:25] many times we make excuses because it's
[59:27] tied to our own desires and our own
[59:29] hearts so we want to Understand as
[59:32] Christians every day of the week, not
[59:34] just on Sundays or Wednesdays or
[59:36] Fridays, but every day of the week, we
[59:38] have a testimony that we are contending
[59:40] for the faith that we are doing
[59:41] something to grow as much as in the
[59:43] natural as in the spiritual. God is
[59:45] interested in every single aspect of it.
[59:47] Can the church say amen?
[59:49] &gt;&gt; So this morning we will play a tape from
[59:52] brother oid uh from uh the Navy
[59:54] convention and of some have compassion.
[59:56] It's not a long message. Uh but I know
[59:59] it's going to be a tremendous blessing
[1:00:00] to you. Um but before we put that tape
[1:00:03] on, I wanted to share something to
[1:00:04] encourage us a bit about uh the power of
[1:00:08] our words. You know, I've been seeing
[1:00:11] more and more people are looking for a
[1:00:13] breakthrough. They're looking for
[1:00:14] healing, for deliverance, for
[1:00:16] transformation. And many times we are
[1:00:19] doing some self- sabotage.
[1:00:21] So, we addressed in the prayer meeting
[1:00:23] on Friday about destroying the evidence
[1:00:26] that Satan has against us because if
[1:00:29] you're looking to stand before the Lord
[1:00:31] and the devil, who is supposed to be the
[1:00:33] accuser of the brethren, the Bible makes
[1:00:34] that very, very clear. Standing accusing
[1:00:37] you day and night, when you sleep in,
[1:00:38] he's bringing accusations. And if
[1:00:41] there's evidence to contest and to show,
[1:00:43] but look, look, look, look, look. Then
[1:00:45] you have to be able to understand how to
[1:00:47] destroy that. And as much as you have a
[1:00:49] lawyer, this is why there's there's
[1:00:50] lawyer client privilege. Tell me what
[1:00:52] really happened so I could build a case
[1:00:54] to defend you. But if we could destroy
[1:00:56] the evidence completely, then the case
[1:00:57] has to be dismissed. Then the judge has
[1:00:59] no issue saying case dismissed. Because
[1:01:01] in the court, a lawyer can't dismiss a
[1:01:03] case if there's a host of the evidence
[1:01:04] against you. You can't just the legal
[1:01:06] framework doesn't allow for that. People
[1:01:07] could question the validity of the case.
[1:01:09] But if we blow up the evidence against
[1:01:11] you, and the evidence could be shown to
[1:01:13] that was not you. The man who you want
[1:01:15] to look for is really Jacob, but this
[1:01:17] man here is Israel.
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; He used to be Jacob. The man you're
[1:01:21] talking to is Israel. It's not Jacob
[1:01:23] anymore. You can't call him that. He had
[1:01:24] a name change. Something happened to
[1:01:26] him. The old version no LONGER EXISTS.
[1:01:28] HE DIED OUT TO HIMSELF A LONG TIME AGO.
[1:01:30] AND YOU CAN'T ARREST a different man for
[1:01:32] the crime done by another man. You don't
[1:01:34] hear me this morning. So when there's A
[1:01:36] TRANSFORMATION OF GOD UPON YOUR LIFE AND
[1:01:38] THEY SAY, "BUT HIS NAME IS JACOB." NO,
[1:01:40] MY NAME IS NOT JACOB. MY NAME IS ISRAEL.
[1:01:42] WHEN DID IT HAPPEN? I MET THE ANGEL AND
[1:01:44] I wrestled with the ANGEL AND HE TOUCHED
[1:01:46] MY HE TOUCHED THE HOLLOW OF MY JOINT. SO
[1:01:49] THE WAY I WALKED INTO CHURCH THIS
[1:01:51] MORNING I WALKING OUT DIFFERENT BECAUSE
[1:01:52] WHEN HE MET THE ANGEL HIS WALK CHANGED
[1:01:54] HIS TALK CHANGED HIS LIFE CHANGED. HOW
[1:01:57] YOU COULD OH YOU DON'T HEAR ME this
[1:01:58] morning.
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; That's how God could confuse the devil.
[1:02:07] That's why there's a part of his whole
[1:02:08] name change. Abraham to Abraham.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; Saul to Paul.
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; GO LOOK FOR SAUL. HE NO LONGER EXISTS.
[1:02:15] HIS NAME IS PAUL. NOW, WHY? BECAUSE HE
[1:02:17] MET THE LORD HIMSELF. HE SAID, "WHY YOU
[1:02:20] PERSECUTE ME? GO YOUR WAY NOW." HE'S A
[1:02:22] DIFFERENT MAN NOW. THE NAME change
[1:02:24] represents a change of identity. IT
[1:02:27] REPRESENTS WHO YOU REALLY ARE IN GOD.
[1:02:29] AND IF THE LORD DOES A TRANSFORMATION ON
[1:02:30] YOU, THE DEVIL CAN'T EVEN ACCESS YOU
[1:02:32] ANYMORE.
[1:02:35] [Applause]
[1:02:38] Can the church say amen so we can stand
[1:02:40] boldly and with confidence?
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; And have a testimony of a real
[1:02:47] understanding of your identity in God.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; So I encourage you if you were not in
[1:02:53] that prayer meeting, go back to it.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; Listen to it. Understand it because you
[1:02:58] have rights. You have privileges. There
[1:03:00] are things you access. Sam Brandham said
[1:03:02] many times we are living under our
[1:03:04] privileges.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; God is not happy watching you walking
[1:03:07] around sick and depressed and
[1:03:08] frustrated. God gets no pleasure in
[1:03:10] that. He wants to see you overcoming. He
[1:03:12] wants to see you in victory. He want to
[1:03:14] see you worshiping. He want to see you
[1:03:16] blessed going in, bless coming out. He
[1:03:18] promised that goodness and mercy
[1:03:20] supposed to follow you. Not hardship AND
[1:03:22] FRUSTRATION AND CAN'T SLEEP AT NIGHT BUT
[1:03:25] GOODNESS and mercy where you walk.
[1:03:27] People just see look GOODNESS AND MERCY
[1:03:29] FOLLOW HIM. He said, "NOT SUNDAYS ALONE,
[1:03:31] BUT ALL THE DAYS OF YOUR LIFE. WHEN YOU
[1:03:33] WALK INTO YOUR JOB, GOODNESS AND MERCY
[1:03:35] FOLLOWING YOU. YOU HAVE AN ENTOURAGE
[1:03:38] WHEN YOU GO TO YOUR HOME. GOODNESS AND
[1:03:40] MERCY. MERCY FOR WHEN YOU MESS UP.
[1:03:42] GOODNESS FOR WHEN YOU NEED A TOUCH FROM
[1:03:44] THE LORD AND SUSTENANCE. GOODNESS AND
[1:03:46] MERCY FOLLOWING you with the angel OF
[1:03:49] THE LORD ENCAMPED AROUND THEM THAT FEAR
[1:03:51] YOU. SO YOU HAVE SECURITY AND GOODNESS
[1:03:53] AND MERCY.
[1:03:55] LET THE DEVIL TRY TO GET INTO THAT NOW
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THERE ARE ANGELS AROUND YOU TO
[1:03:59] PROTECT YOU.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. GREATER IS HE THAT'S IN YOU
[1:04:02] THAN HE THAT'S IN THE WORLD. I DON'T
[1:04:04] CARE WHAT MISTAKE YOU MADE, WHAT PROBLEM
[1:04:06] YOU MADE. THAT'S WHY HE SAID GOODNESS
[1:04:08] AND MERCY WILL FOLLOW YOU ALL THE DAYS
[1:04:10] OF YOUR LIFE. AS I WAS WITH MOSES, SO I
[1:04:13] SHALL BE WITH THEE. I WILL NOT LEAVE
[1:04:15] YOU. I WILL NOT FORSAKE THEE. BUT
[1:04:17] MEDITATE ON THIS LAW DAY AND NIGHT, AND
[1:04:19] YOU WILL HAVE GOOD SUCCESS. YOU'LL HAVE
[1:04:21] SUCCESS ON A MONDAY, SUCCESS ON A
[1:04:23] TUESDAY, SUCCESS ON A FRIDAY, SUCCESS ON
[1:04:25] A SUNDAY, SUCCESS IN YOUR JOB, SUCCESS
[1:04:28] IN YOUR MARRIAGE, SUCCESS IN YOUR PRAYER
[1:04:30] LIFE, SUCCESS IN DIGGING INTO THE WORD.
[1:04:32] HAVE GOOD SUCCESS.
[1:04:36] GOD LOVES TO add these DESCRIPTIONS TO
[1:04:38] HIS THING. NOT JUST HAVE SUCCESS, GOOD
[1:04:40] SUCCESS.
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; CUP RUNNING OVER. WHEN GOD DOES
[1:04:46] SOMETHING, THERE'S ALWAYS EXTRA
[1:04:47] INVOLVED, you know. He don't leave it
[1:04:49] and say, "Well, I bless you and your
[1:04:50] cup." No, your cup run over.
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; FEED 5,000. IT HAVE ALL EVERYBODY FEED
[1:04:55] AND IT HAVE REMAINDERS JUST TO SHOW THAT
[1:04:57] God was in the picture. WHEN HE BLESSED
[1:04:59] ABRAHAM, ABRAHAM SO BLESSED LOT GET
[1:05:02] BLESSED. ALSO, WHEN GOD IS INVOLVED IN
[1:05:04] THE EQUATION, THERE'S ALWAYS EXTRA TO
[1:05:06] PROVE that it's God. IT'S BIGGER THAN
[1:05:08] YOU. IT'S GOD'S LOVE TO YOU. IT'S GOD'S
[1:05:10] MERCY TO YOU. IT'S GOD'S GRACE TO YOU.
[1:05:13] IT'S GOD'S FAVOR TO YOU. IT'S GOD'S
[1:05:15] MERCY TO YOU. IT'S GOD'S GOODNESS TO
[1:05:17] YOU. CAN THE CHURCH say amen?
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; But I want to touch on something
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; before I close out.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; We spoke about the evidence Satan has.
[1:05:36] So when you have unconfessed sin,
[1:05:42] brother shared it could hold up the
[1:05:44] church, hold up your family, hold up
[1:05:45] your life because God wants to move, but
[1:05:48] you create these obstacles
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; and you give the devil evidence to use
[1:05:51] against you. He say confess it, put it
[1:05:53] under the blood.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; He say drop yours.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; He say husbands operate a certain way
[1:05:58] with your wife. We went through all this
[1:05:59] on Friday. I want to go beyond this to
[1:06:00] now our words
[1:06:05] because many of us are in trouble
[1:06:07] because of our words.
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; I was sharing with my wife in driving up
[1:06:13] there are people who are suffering in
[1:06:15] silence because they don't want to say
[1:06:17] certain things and because they don't
[1:06:20] want to say certain things they suffer
[1:06:21] in silence.
[1:06:27] And while that is happening on the flip
[1:06:29] side of the coin, they are comfortable
[1:06:31] to comment about things and matters and
[1:06:33] issues that doesn't edify.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; So they lock down the issues they need
[1:06:39] help for, but they're comfortable to
[1:06:41] express opinions, thoughts, ideas around
[1:06:44] other people, subjects, thoughts.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; And you ask the deeper question because
[1:06:50] questions are important.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; GOD USES QUESTIONS. WHERE WAS thou
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; when I laid the foundation of the earth?
[1:06:56] And the questions GET US TO RECALIBRATE
[1:06:58] OUR THINKING. So I want to challenge our
[1:07:01] approach as we come to the end of this
[1:07:03] year and prepare for a new year. What's
[1:07:05] the motive and objective? Because if YOU
[1:07:07] DON'T UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM WITH
[1:07:09] GOSSIP,
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; you will never change your thinking
[1:07:12] about it.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; We we address gossip as a spirit. You
[1:07:16] remember the sister when preach say you
[1:07:18] touch everything where you touch me.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. say he's a gossiper.
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; Gossip is a spirit. But gossip is deeper
[1:07:28] than just saying is a spirit.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; The whole issue of spending time talking
[1:07:33] about issues with no desire for
[1:07:35] edification.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; In other words, what does telling you
[1:07:40] this about this brother do to edify you?
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; And what does telling YOU ABOUT IT HAVE
[1:07:46] TO do to help you?
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; And does ME TELLING YOU ANYTHING ABOUT
[1:07:49] THIS BROTHER OR SISTER HELP THEM?
[1:07:52] BECAUSE IF IT DOESN'T EDIFY, WHAT'S THE
[1:07:55] PURPOSE?
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOUR LIFE NOT CHANGING, THE
[1:07:59] PERSON YOU TALKING TO NOT CHANGING, AND
[1:08:01] THE PERSON YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT CAN'T
[1:08:02] GET HELP.
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; ALL THAT TIME IS WASTED TIME.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; So I want you to understand this
[1:08:14] gossiping demon
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; because it's a spirit,
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; BUT IT'S A ISSUE OF LIFE. BECAUSE IT'S
[1:08:20] VERY EASY FOR PEOPLE TO SAY, "WELL, you
[1:08:21] see, let me tell you about what the
[1:08:23] latest." Young people know the tea.
[1:08:25] Spill the tea.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; You hear the latest. You see the latest.
[1:08:29] You You want to hear what really
[1:08:30] happened.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; After you hear OR SAY WHAT HAPPENED,
[1:08:34] YOUR LIFE KNOW BETTER
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; AND THE PERSON YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT NOT
[1:08:41] BETTER. AND MOST MORE OFTEN THAN NOT,
[1:08:44] THE PERSON WHO'S RECEIVING THIS
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; NOT GETTING HELP. AMEN.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; This is what I call ABOUT THE MYSTERIES.
[1:08:53] PEOPLE WANT TO PREACH mysteries and
[1:08:55] mysteries in the MESSAGE AND THEIR LIFE
[1:08:56] IS A MYSTERY BECAUSE BEHIND INDOLOGY THE
[1:08:59] MYSTERY IS A GOSSIPING DEMON. YOU SEE
[1:09:01] THIS? You hear this? Let me tell you the
[1:09:02] real story behind this. Let me tell you
[1:09:04] WHAT REALLY HAPPENED. AND I HEAR IT and
[1:09:06] a maxi and I was on a fig tree
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; and she tell her and he tell him and
[1:09:12] well it's really the first cousin second
[1:09:14] cousin twice remove who really living in
[1:09:15] the house and she really see and I know
[1:09:17] the coworker and by TIME YOU DONE YOUR
[1:09:19] LIFE IS NO better
[1:09:24] [Applause]
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; talk about Jesus
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; that's what the prophet said thank you
[1:09:29] brother Punch brother but the brand said
[1:09:30] when you talk about him he draws near
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; so I want to help you As we COME TO THE
[1:09:35] END OF THIS year and prepare for the new
[1:09:37] year, STOP TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE AND
[1:09:39] STUFF and these things and talk things.
[1:09:41] But man, say it's better if you have
[1:09:43] nothing good to say. Don't say nothing.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; The Bible said even a fool when he is
[1:09:48] silent is considered wise.
[1:09:51] [Applause]
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; I hope this helps somebody today. You
[1:09:56] know, because many of us are keeping
[1:09:58] back our lives by the things we comment
[1:10:00] on. And sometime we comment on things
[1:10:03] not even knowing God in the picture. We
[1:10:05] preached last week about God was judging
[1:10:08] that ship that Jonah was on and the men
[1:10:10] tried to save the ship, save Jonah. But
[1:10:12] you can't interrupt God's judgment. You
[1:10:14] can't interrupt God's plan. The more
[1:10:16] THEY TRIED TO FIGHT IT and try to save
[1:10:18] Jonah, the more the storm INCREASED
[1:10:20] BECAUSE GOD'S DESIRE WAS TO THROW a man
[1:10:22] overboard. Only when the man got
[1:10:24] overboard, the moment he was overboard,
[1:10:25] THE SHIP STOPPED MOVING ONE TIME BECAUSE
[1:10:27] GOD WAS IN THE PICTURE. So I want to
[1:10:29] read one scripture and we'll close out.
[1:10:30] This is in James
[1:10:33] 3.
[1:10:37] A word induced eating. Thank you for a
[1:10:39] punch. At least a punch is with me this
[1:10:40] morning.
[1:10:43] Once I have one person with me, I know
[1:10:46] we're good.
[1:10:48] James 3, my brethren, be not many
[1:10:52] masters, knowing that we shall receive
[1:10:54] the greater condemnation. So, but the
[1:10:57] the Bible here is saying, don't try to
[1:10:59] be a teacher. You know where the Bible
[1:11:00] say try to get ministry. This is what
[1:11:03] he's talking about here.
[1:11:05] Be not many masters. Don't try to be a
[1:11:07] teacher. In the amplified it says not
[1:11:09] many of you should become teachers
[1:11:11] serving in an official teaching
[1:11:13] capacity.
[1:11:16] Why? That we knowing that we shall
[1:11:19] receive the greater condemnation. So in
[1:11:21] other words, me standing here this
[1:11:23] morning is not about you. It is about
[1:11:25] you in part, BUT IT'S BECAUSE I HAVE TO
[1:11:27] GIVE AN account
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; for coming behind the sacred desk this
[1:11:30] morning.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; I am being measured and my papers being
[1:11:33] marked by God.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; At the end of the day, brother Punch, is
[1:11:37] God have to mark the papers? NO.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; WHETHER YOU SHOUT, WHETHER you receive
[1:11:41] it, YOU DON'T RECEIVE IT, YOU ACCEPT IT,
[1:11:42] YOU DON'T ACCEPT IT. I REPORT TO one
[1:11:44] person, which is the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:11:46] I'm under THE HEADSHIP OF A PASTOR, BUT
[1:11:48] I REPORT TO THE LORD JESUS CHRIST. And
[1:11:50] if you say DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE OF
[1:11:51] PEOPLE SAYING things they shouldn't say
[1:11:53] I have to report for duty. If it fall in
[1:11:55] your lot it's not you are talking to
[1:11:57] it's the spirit.
[1:11:58] [Applause]
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; GOD LOVES THE SINNER BUT HERE'S THE HE
[1:12:02] SIN.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; So if you feel offended about it is
[1:12:06] realize it's not even you feel offended.
[1:12:08] It's his spirit upon you
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; getting exposed. But when we expose the
[1:12:12] spirit upon you and he RECOGNIZED THIS
[1:12:14] IS NO LONGER THE HOUSE FOR HIM. THE
[1:12:16] SPIRIT WILL HAVE TO GO. IS WHEN THINGS
[1:12:18] ARE KEPT HIDDEN, THEY begin to grow and
[1:12:20] dwell. THAT IS WHY COCKROACH AND ALL
[1:12:22] THESE THINGS HIDE IN DARKNESS. BUT THE
[1:12:23] MOMENT WE SHINE LIGHT, YOU SEE THEM
[1:12:25] START TO SCURRY. SO WE WANT TO EXPOSE
[1:12:27] THIS MORNING EVERYTHING THAT WILL HINDER
[1:12:29] YOUR PROGRESS IN THE SPIRITUAL REALM. SO
[1:12:31] WHEN YOU APPROACH GOD, YOU COULD
[1:12:33] APPROACH GOD WITH BOLDNESS, KNOWING YOU
[1:12:35] ARE SPEAKING LIFE INTO YOUR HOME, LIFE
[1:12:38] INTO YOUR FAMILY, LIFE INTO YOUR
[1:12:40] SITUATION, AND NOT USING this tongue to
[1:12:42] speak death into your situation.
[1:12:45] That's why the Bible say, "Let the weak
[1:12:46] say, I'm strong."
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; Declare it to be so.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; Verse two, for we all stumble and sin,
[1:12:58] for in many things we offend all, verse
[1:13:00] two, if any man offend not in word, the
[1:13:03] same is a perfect man and also to bridle
[1:13:07] the whole body. Behold, listen to the
[1:13:10] scripture. We put bits. You know, you
[1:13:13] see a horse race. That thing you put in
[1:13:15] the mouth, it's called a bit.
[1:13:19] The Bible says here, we put bits in the
[1:13:21] horse's mouth that they may obey us and
[1:13:25] we turn about their whole body. In other
[1:13:27] words, once the bit is in the mouth and
[1:13:29] you pull that cord on the horse, the
[1:13:31] horse will go wherever you pull. Are we
[1:13:33] together? Behold also the ships which
[1:13:38] though they be so great and are driven
[1:13:41] of fierce winds yet are they turned
[1:13:44] about with a very small helm
[1:13:46] whethersoever the governor or the ship
[1:13:48] captain listed or once in other words
[1:13:51] the biggest ship in the world IF THE
[1:13:54] CAPTAIN HOLD this thing this rudder and
[1:13:56] turn the WHOLE SHIP AS LARGE AS IT IS
[1:13:59] WILL TURN ARE WE together
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; even so verse five the tongue is a
[1:14:04] little member.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T LIFT WAIST WITH YOUR TONGUE,
[1:14:08] YOU KNOW.
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; You could build arm muscles, leg
[1:14:12] muscles, all kind of things. BUT THE
[1:14:15] TONGUE AS A LITTLE MEMBER,
[1:14:18] even so the tongue is a little member
[1:14:20] and boasted great things. Behold, how
[1:14:22] great a matter a little fire kindle it.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; So James is saying this little small
[1:14:28] tongue
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; starting big fires. YES.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; FIRES IN MARRIAGES, FIRES ON THE JOB,
[1:14:37] FIRES IN YOUR HOME.
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; That's why say a soft answer turns away
[1:14:43] rat.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; But no, you were to give him
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; I'm reading the Bible now. THE LITTLE
[1:14:52] MEMBER
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; MAN HAVE BIG BODY BUT THE LITTLE ME
[1:14:55] LITTLE TONGUE HIS WHOLE LIFE IS BEING
[1:14:57] LET'S READ IT IN THE scripture
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; verse six and THE TONGUE IS A fire
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; a WORLD
[1:15:09] OF iniquity
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; so is the tongue among our members that
[1:15:15] IT DEFILETH THE WHOLE body
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; and SET IT ON FIRE THE COURSE OF NATURE
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; AND IT IS SET ON FIRE OF HELL.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; VERSE SEVEN, FOR EVERY KIND OF BEASTS
[1:15:32] and of birds and of serpents and of
[1:15:34] things in the sea is tamed and hath been
[1:15:37] tamed by mankind. Go in the zoo
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; man tame what kind of elephant tame
[1:15:42] lion.
[1:15:44] You go into you see see all kind of
[1:15:46] poisonous snakes. Man figure HOW TO TAME
[1:15:49] ALL THESE ANIMALS. But verse eight, but
[1:15:52] the tongue can no man tame.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; It is an unruly evil
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; full OF DEADLY POISON.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; There bless we God. IN OTHER WORDS,
[1:16:07] YOU'RE THERE BLESSING GOD. HALLELUJAH.
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; You're using your words and the SAME
[1:16:13] TONGUE.
[1:16:15] ON A SUNDAY. Blessed be the Lord
[1:16:19] God Almighty. I'm not a singer.
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; You appreciate the special.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; Wonderful. I was so blessed. Thank you
[1:16:27] so much to the Genevieve the Sunday
[1:16:28] school. Wonderful.
[1:16:30] THE SAME TONGUE THAT blessing
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; verse go on. even
[1:16:40] the father
[1:16:43] AND THEREWITH CURSE we men
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; and curse don't just mean obscene
[1:16:50] language you know
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; curse mean you go fail
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; you will crash
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; you go you go fail it GO FALL APART ALL
[1:17:02] THAT IS CURSING THE SAME TONGUE
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; AND MANY OF US WE COME TO CHURCH AND
[1:17:06] LISTEN, IF YOU see us in church, and
[1:17:09] this is why I say thank God we can't see
[1:17:10] everybody doing the weekend over punch.
[1:17:13] THE PROPHET OF GOD HAD THE ABILITY to
[1:17:16] see through the facade
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; is the Oscars is the one with acting.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; Trinidad in particular, for those
[1:17:23] online, I'm speaking to Trinidad. I'm
[1:17:24] speaking to the local church.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; We have the consecutive Oscars every
[1:17:28] year. They don't even have to vote in
[1:17:31] because we good at the God bless you.
[1:17:34] How you doing? I love you. Oh, God.
[1:17:36] appreciate you and behind that behind
[1:17:38] that appreciate if you translate that
[1:17:40] and you see behind the veil what going
[1:17:42] on in the mind and the HEART IS A WHOLE
[1:17:43] DIFFERENT thing
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; with the SAME WAY THE PERSON GONE SOON I
[1:17:50] SH BUT I DON'T deal I don't deal with
[1:17:53] YOU KNOW
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; SOMEBODY 5 MINUTES I just shake him
[1:17:56] because you know we supposed to shake
[1:17:57] hands
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; we have TO BE SO CAREFUL FUL BECAUSE AND
[1:18:06] and I've realized it more and more there
[1:18:08] are things I do not comment on
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; even if I disagree WITH IT BECAUSE I
[1:18:14] DON'T KNOW THE TEACHING THAT Gama give
[1:18:17] was if it is of God it will be of God
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; if it IS NOT OF GOD IT WILL FALL APART
[1:18:22] FOR ITSELF WE HAVE NOTHING TO SAY ON the
[1:18:24] matter God is the JUDGE HE'S THE ONE
[1:18:26] MARKING EVERYBODY PAPERS I AM NOT
[1:18:28] AUTHORIZED TO MARK NOBODY PAPERS GOD IS
[1:18:30] THE JUDGE HE IS JUDGE HE IS LAWYER he is
[1:18:33] king of kings he's the high PRIEST OF
[1:18:35] OUR CONFESSION. WE COULD NEVER STEP INTO
[1:18:37] GOD'S PLACE TO COMMENT ON ISSUES THAT
[1:18:40] ARE NOT OURS TO COMMENT ON. HE IS THE
[1:18:43] ONE THAT JUSTIFY. HE IS THE ONE THAT
[1:18:44] FAILS. HE IS THE ONE THAT SAVES.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; AND THE PRECEDENT IS ALL THROUGH
[1:18:50] SCRIPTURE BECAUSE WHEN SAUL became Paul
[1:18:53] the Apostle, people in the church had
[1:18:54] issues with him
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; because brother STEVEN WAS A PRECIOUS
[1:18:58] BROTHER. HE WAS A DEACON IN THE CHURCH
[1:19:00] AND PAUL WHEN HE WAS SAUL SUPERVISED THE
[1:19:02] KILLING OF HIM. And when he walk in the
[1:19:04] church and say watch him and put HIM IN
[1:19:05] THE BACK IN THE CORNER they put two
[1:19:07] deacons watch him BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT
[1:19:08] what this man do
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; don't give me the right hand of
[1:19:13] fellowship give me the left hand of
[1:19:14] fellowship
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; and people have things to say
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; and many time and this is why we always
[1:19:24] say as a parent I'm trying to get out of
[1:19:26] here
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; as a parent
[1:19:30] George do
[1:19:32] I'm under author authority.
[1:19:36] As a parent, we have to be so careful
[1:19:38] what we say about other people's
[1:19:39] children
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; because you don't know WHAT COMING TO
[1:19:42] YOUR HOUSE.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT COMING TO YOUR HOUSE
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; AND WE FEEL THE LIBERTY TO SAY IF she
[1:19:51] they do this and if he they do this is
[1:19:53] GOING TO BE HOW YOU KNOW IT GOING TO BE
[1:19:54] DIFFERENT.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; THE ONLY THING WE could rest on is what
[1:19:58] the word says. Amen.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHERE WE ARE RESTING ON THAT. THE
[1:20:04] PROPHET, I'M RESTING ON THAT.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; WE CAN ONLY REST ON THE WORD, BUT PEOPLE
[1:20:08] HAVE THE THE AUDACITY TO COMMENT.
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; And especially in Trinidad, this is one
[1:20:14] of the most disrespectful countries.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; And I can tell you from authority
[1:20:19] traveling the world, brother George, you
[1:20:21] see people in different customs,
[1:20:22] traditions. You have people who by their
[1:20:24] very nature, they're very respectful.
[1:20:26] They're very courteous. In some ways we
[1:20:28] curte. You go to SOME COUNTRIES NOBODY
[1:20:30] SAY GOOD MORNING. NOBODY SAY HELLO.
[1:20:31] EVERYBODY PASSING YOU AS IF YOU DON'T
[1:20:32] EXIST. HERE THE AVERAGE PERSON. HEY GOOD
[1:20:35] DAY. WE EVEN DOUBLE IT. MORNING.
[1:20:37] MORNING.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; HOW YOU GOING? OKAY. WE HAVE ALL KIND OF
[1:20:44] THING WE DO. SO IN THE ONE HAND WE HAVE
[1:20:46] A LEVEL OF COURTESY BUT DISRESPECT.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE SAY GIVE RESPECT TO THOSE THAT
[1:20:52] RULE OVER YOU.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; But no we shoot it on the government. It
[1:20:55] don't matter which government you
[1:20:56] belong. By the time we done with you in
[1:20:58] Trinidad,
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; BUT THAT'S NOT A BIBLICAL PRINCIPLE. WE
[1:21:05] DEALING WITH BIBLICAL PRINCIPLES. THIS
[1:21:07] IS WHY OUR CONDUCT, OUR BEHAVIOR SHOULD
[1:21:10] BE HIGHER THAN THE MAN ON THE STREET.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; THE NEIGHBOR TALKING ABOUT THE PRIME
[1:21:13] MINISTER, I NOT GETTING INVOLVED IN THE
[1:21:15] CONVERSATION. THE ONLY PRIME MINISTER I
[1:21:16] TALKING ABOUT IS THIS ONE
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THIS ONE DON'T TELL A LIE. THIS
[1:21:21] ONE
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; WHEN HE SAY I DOING SOMETHING AND HE PUT
[1:21:24] IT ON THE WHAT HE THINK THE MANIFESTO
[1:21:26] WHEN HE PUT IT ON THE MANIFESTO I DON'T
[1:21:28] HAVE TO LOOK BACK AT THE MANIFESTO TO
[1:21:30] SEE WHAT WAS THERE WHATEVER HE PUT IN
[1:21:32] THE MANIFESTO COMING TO PASS
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; HE SAID YOUR CHILDREN COMING IT COMING
[1:21:35] TO PASS HE SAID I'LL TAKE CARE OF YOU IT
[1:21:37] COMING TO PASS YOU DON'T HAVE TO WONDER
[1:21:39] EVEN THOUGH THE MANIFESTO IT'S COMING TO
[1:21:40] pass
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; are we together THIS MORNING
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; SO I WANT TO CHALLENGE US THIS IS NOT A
[1:21:48] REBUKE IT IS AN ENCOURAGEMENT MENT TO us
[1:21:51] to say the right thing
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; AND MORE IMPORTANTLY BE VERY SENSITIVE
[1:21:56] ESPECIALLY YOU WHO ARE older and
[1:21:58] certainly include myself now correct I'm
[1:22:00] not as young as I used to be
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; is it edifying
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; is it helping
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; how is it helping is it encouraging when
[1:22:10] somebody finish talk with you do they
[1:22:12] leave feeling inspired or they feel
[1:22:13] heavier
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; because you just offload you you know
[1:22:16] brother over there say you pull up the
[1:22:18] garbage truck and I just offload LORD,
[1:22:20] HE SAID NOT HERE. NOT BY THIS HOUSE.
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; But say when he call him and have to
[1:22:25] offload, he say hold up, hold up, hold
[1:22:26] up, hold up before you continue,
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; there's some things you have to take to
[1:22:33] the Lord.
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; But it should be if somebody have a
[1:22:38] conversation with you, you are closer to
[1:22:40] God, not further away from God.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; Closer to one another.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; This why brother Brandon said many
[1:22:46] times, don't just receive something
[1:22:47] against your brother. HOW YOU SUPPOSED
[1:22:48] TO LOOK at your brother if all you
[1:22:50] hearing is 29 reasons why that is not a
[1:22:52] good brother?
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; Because you will look at a person funny.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; Are we together this morning?
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; So I want you to make a commitment and a
[1:23:00] pledge as we go forward as the brothers
[1:23:02] get ready to put on the tape that we
[1:23:04] should speak better.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; You don't understand something, pray
[1:23:07] about it.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; Ask the right person the question. You
[1:23:10] don't go to the chief gossiper in the
[1:23:11] church.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; Now I don't know who that is.
[1:23:16] That is not an official position. That's
[1:23:17] an unofficial position
[1:23:21] but a punch every church have
[1:23:24] and I'm not launching no commission of
[1:23:26] inquiry to find out who it is but every
[1:23:29] church have a chief gossiper every
[1:23:30] company have a chief gossiper there's
[1:23:32] somebody you could go to in every place
[1:23:33] and find the person who they love to
[1:23:35] just live on the information who
[1:23:37] marriage in trouble who this who had no
[1:23:39] money who do THAT AND IF YOU WANT TO
[1:23:41] KNOW YOU GO TO THEM YOU HAVE EVERYTHING
[1:23:43] AND EVERY WAY THEY COULD PULL AND ASK
[1:23:44] AND PROB AND COME TO CONCLUSION IS A
[1:23:46] SPIRIT
[1:23:53] BUT IF WE destroy it, because when the
[1:23:55] Bible says Satan will be bound a
[1:23:56] thousand years, but the man said that's
[1:23:58] bound by chains OF CIRCUMSTANCE IN THAT
[1:24:01] HE HAS NOBODY TO USE.
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; So if he cares BROTHER GEORGE AND HE CAR
[1:24:05] SISTER ROSEMARY AND THEY ARE THE ONLY
[1:24:07] ONES IN THE HOUSE, HE HAS TO FIND THE
[1:24:08] NEXT HOUSE.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU WITH ME this morning? AND IF YOU
[1:24:12] COME TO THIS CHURCH AND THE CAR USE THE
[1:24:13] DEACONS AND THE CAR USE THE MINISTERS
[1:24:14] AND THE CAR USE EVERY BROTHER AND
[1:24:16] SISTER. HE WAS SAYING NOT THIS CHURCH. I
[1:24:18] NEED TO FIND ANOTHER CHURCH BECAUSE I
[1:24:20] HAVE NO ROOM. I HAVE NOBODY TO USE. CAN
[1:24:22] THE CHURCH SAY AMEN? CAN WE GIVE THE
[1:24:24] LORD A SHOUT OF PRAISE? LET'S ALL STAND
[1:24:26] TO OUR feet as we switch to hearing our
[1:24:29] pastor this morning. God richly bless
[1:24:31] you.

[1:25:44] [Music]
[1:25:50] So I can hear the sound of abundance of
[1:25:52] rain.
[1:25:53] Hallelujah.
[1:25:55] Amen. I told you this coming I think
[1:25:59] it's long overdue.
[1:26:02] Uh but it happened in the right time.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; But um I thank God for the ministry that
[1:26:09] God gave to our dear brother. Amen.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; And um I I thank brother Olu for hosting
[1:26:16] the convention in 1993.
[1:26:19] [Music]
[1:26:29] That convention in 1993
[1:26:32] to me was very outstanding
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; and um whatever you see going on is from
[1:26:38] that meeting
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; in 1993 and um you know you can go to
[1:26:43] conventions and be blessed
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; and you know God does so many things.
[1:26:48] You take whatever you know you have need
[1:26:50] of and you just take your blessings and
[1:26:52] go.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; You see but something happened.
[1:26:55] We have finished the convention 1993 and
[1:26:59] brother Olu took us to Sheraton for um
[1:27:03] you know the minister's banquet and
[1:27:05] we're all there. We ate, we enjoyed
[1:27:09] ourselves and then the overseas
[1:27:11] ministers came to um you know encourage
[1:27:15] us the Nigerian ministers and um all the
[1:27:18] all the ministers came one after the
[1:27:20] other. They spoke you know encouraging
[1:27:22] us to unity and um how we can we should
[1:27:26] you know try to accommodate one another
[1:27:29] and so forth and forget our differences
[1:27:31] you know it spoke so many things. So and
[1:27:34] then brother Oid stood up where he had a
[1:27:38] microphone he was given a microphone he
[1:27:40] stood up and then he said he said you
[1:27:42] know it's easy he said Nigerians
[1:27:46] ministers he said it's easy to love
[1:27:49] somebody who is far
[1:27:51] it's very easy to love somebody you
[1:27:53] don't see every day you see him oh my
[1:27:56] precious brother you know you so much
[1:27:58] love him he said but how do you know you
[1:28:01] have love he said when you love somebody
[1:28:04] you see every day.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; He said you got to learn how you love
[1:28:07] how to love somebody. You wake up every
[1:28:10] day and you see that person.
[1:28:13] So when he spoke that word and then he
[1:28:15] said Nigerian ministers write one
[1:28:17] another, call each other on phone, visit
[1:28:21] one another, preach for one another. To
[1:28:24] me that was a seed I took from that
[1:28:26] convention.
[1:28:28] [Applause]
[1:28:30] And
[1:28:31] when we come back to after the meeting,
[1:28:34] we return to we return to our local
[1:28:36] churches. We come back here. Then I
[1:28:38] decided to make use of what I got from
[1:28:40] that meeting.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; I made up my mind. It's not going to go
[1:28:43] like that. I'm going to make use of
[1:28:45] that.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; And friends, something started and we
[1:28:49] begin to break down the walls around us.
[1:28:51] All the partitions of this and this and
[1:28:53] that. We begin to break all the walls
[1:28:56] down. We threw our church door open AND
[1:29:00] WE INVITED MINISTER AFTER MINISTER.
[1:29:03] Every weekend we are having weekend
[1:29:05] meetings, weekend revivals in our church
[1:29:07] with different different ministers. THEN
[1:29:09] I SAW THAT IT'S SO EASY. IT'S SO EASY TO
[1:29:13] ACHIEVE UNITY. IT'S NOT IT'S NOT IT'S SO
[1:29:16] EASY TO ACHIEVE LOVE TO MAINTAIN LOVE
[1:29:19] AMONG THE BREAD. JUST GET STARTED. DO
[1:29:22] SOMETHING RIGHT. FORGET ABOUT THIS AND
[1:29:24] THAT AND how you feel and what he said
[1:29:27] AND WHAT SOMEBODY SAID ABOUT SOMEBODY.
[1:29:29] YOU SIMPLY FORGET ABOUT THAT AND GO OVER
[1:29:32] THE VERSE. BREAK DOWN THE WORDS AND YOU
[1:29:34] SAID YOU WILL SEE THAT IT'S EASIER AND
[1:29:36] BETTER AND SWEETER THAT WE CAN OPERATE
[1:29:39] AND WE CAN LOVE ONE ANOTHER AND WE CAN
[1:29:42] HOLD EACH OTHERS SO DEARLY IN OUR hearts
[1:29:44] and we can live above feelings. WE CAN
[1:29:48] LIVE ABOVE HEARSAYES. WE CAN LIVE ABOVE
[1:29:50] STORIES.
[1:29:53] [Applause]
[1:29:57] That was what happened in 1994, 1995,
[1:30:00] 1996. Then 1997 we had the first youth
[1:30:04] convention. In May 1997 and then 1998 we
[1:30:08] started having this conventions. This is
[1:30:10] the 28th year.
[1:30:14] So I thank God brother O is here.
[1:30:17] Brother O thank you for coming to
[1:30:18] Nigeria in 1993.
[1:30:21] and brother Olu, thank you for hosting
[1:30:23] that convention. It's not in vain. What
[1:30:26] you do for Jesus is not in vain. So
[1:30:29] tonight is my privilege to bring to the
[1:30:31] pulpit God's servant but at your
[1:30:35] o all the way from Trinidad
[1:30:40] and I know you're going to be blessed
[1:30:41] tonight.
[1:30:43] Don't just rejoice and go back home.
[1:30:45] Take something for THE MEETING. TAKE
[1:30:47] SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN GO HOME AND PUT
[1:30:49] IT INTO ACTION. GO HOME AND ACT ON IT.
[1:30:54] THE WORD you hear it is good in the ear,
[1:30:57] sweet in the mouth. But when you digest
[1:30:59] it, brother, it becomes bitter. But
[1:31:01] that's when it forms character.
[1:31:03] Character is formed in us. So God bless
[1:31:06] you. Turn around and shake somebody's
[1:31:08] hand as we welcome God's servant. I
[1:31:10] appreciate him so much. His ministry has
[1:31:13] been a tremendous blessing. But Isaac
[1:31:15] was some such a blessing to us last year
[1:31:18] and we have wonderful times and I know
[1:31:20] that this night and in this meeting we
[1:31:23] are in for better greater blessings in
[1:31:27] God's presence. So let's sing we shall
[1:31:30] see the king when he comes.
[1:31:40] We shall see the king.
[1:31:43] We shall see it again when he comes.
[1:31:49] Oh, his coming in power will have a
[1:31:54] blessed hour.
[1:31:56] We shall see it again when he comes.
[1:32:01] Glory. Oh, we shall see it again. You
[1:32:06] believe that?
[1:32:21] [Applause]
[1:32:24] Heat.
[1:32:26] Heat.
[1:32:40] [Music]
[1:32:46] Heat. Heat.
[1:32:50] [Music]
[1:33:14] Oh, we shall see the king. One more
[1:33:17] time. Oh, we shall see the king. Oh, we
[1:33:22] shall see the king.
[1:33:24] We shall see.
[1:33:32] My Lord,
[1:33:34] he is coming in power. We hear the
[1:33:38] blessed hour.
[1:33:41] We shall see the king when he come.
[1:33:50] God bless you. You may be seated.
[1:33:53] [Music]
[1:33:54] Uh
[1:33:56] I am not a great introduction speaker
[1:33:59] but uh just to say I'm so glad to be
[1:34:02] here
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; and I bring you greetings from the
[1:34:05] Headstone Tabernacle Trinidad and it's a
[1:34:08] blessing and a privilege to be here in
[1:34:09] this meeting but uh the pastor invited
[1:34:12] me many many times but I just felt led
[1:34:15] to come this year
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; and my son Isaac was had his tickets
[1:34:20] everything to come but things didn't
[1:34:22] work out and he's back home. And I said
[1:34:24] I didn't even realize that he wouldn't
[1:34:26] be here also. So I'm happy to put my
[1:34:30] shoulder to the wheel. I'm blessed to
[1:34:33] hear the testimony of of brother Isaac
[1:34:36] uh on his testimony of 1993
[1:34:39] and I still feel the same way now that I
[1:34:42] felt since 199.
[1:34:44] [Music]
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; Walls have to come down
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; just as giants have to fall.
[1:34:52] Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; And I believe in all my heart that Jesus
[1:34:56] God will will break down the walls in
[1:34:58] this message
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; because we have one enemy.
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; We have one devil to fight.
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; The battle is still yet ahead.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; And we have to be ready to fight.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; The people in the message have become
[1:35:11] entitled. They feel that God owed them
[1:35:13] something and they never writing the
[1:35:14] rapture or bribe. But that is not what
[1:35:16] Bram taught. The only right we have is
[1:35:19] to fight. You have to fight for what you
[1:35:21] know is your own.
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; So when the word comes to you is to give
[1:35:25] you a revelation of what is yours.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; God the lamb took the book to reveal
[1:35:30] what is yours.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; And the Holy Spirit is here to enforce
[1:35:34] what is yours.
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; And God can't lie.
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; If God promise you the Holy Ghost,
[1:35:40] you're going to get the Holy Ghost.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; If God promise you deliverance, you're
[1:35:43] going to get your deliverance.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; If God promise you healing, you're going
[1:35:46] to get your healing. One thing we are
[1:35:48] confident of, God can't lie.
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; So tonight, if you want to stand
[1:35:54] before we read the word, let's pray.
[1:35:56] Father, we thank you tonight for your
[1:35:58] presence and for your word and for your
[1:35:59] people gathered here. We pray you bless
[1:36:01] those host pastor here, his family, wife
[1:36:03] and family and church, all the ministers
[1:36:05] and pastors here represented the people
[1:36:07] and those who connected live. May your
[1:36:09] spirit be with them in a special way and
[1:36:11] bless your word as you read it. In Jesus
[1:36:14] name I ask it. Amen.
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; So let's stand. I have two portion of
[1:36:17] scripture I like to read. St. John
[1:36:19] chapter 8 1-11 Jude chapter Jude chapter
[1:36:23] verse 17 to 25.
[1:36:26] Reading from St. John chapter 8 verse
[1:36:28] one. Jesus went into the mount of olives
[1:36:31] and early in the morning he came again
[1:36:33] to the temple and all the people came
[1:36:35] unto him and he sat down and taught
[1:36:38] them. And the scribe and Pharisees
[1:36:41] brought unto him a woman taken in
[1:36:43] adultery. And when they had set her in
[1:36:45] the midst, they said unto her, "Master,
[1:36:48] this woman was taken in adultery in the
[1:36:51] very act." Now Moses in the law
[1:36:54] commanded us that such should be stoned.
[1:36:58] But what sayest thou? This they said,
[1:37:02] tempting him that they might have to
[1:37:05] accuse him. But Jesus stooped down and
[1:37:10] with his finger wrote on the ground as
[1:37:12] though he heard them not. So when they
[1:37:15] continued asking him, he lifted up
[1:37:18] himself and said unto them, he that is
[1:37:21] without sin among you, let him first
[1:37:24] cast a stone at her. And again he
[1:37:28] stooped down, wrote on the ground. And
[1:37:30] they which heard it, being convicted by
[1:37:33] their own conscience,
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; went out one by one,
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; beginning at the eldest, even unto the
[1:37:39] last. And Jesus was left alone, and the
[1:37:43] woman standing in the midst. When Jesus
[1:37:47] had lifted up himself, and saw none but
[1:37:50] the woman, he said unto her, Woman,
[1:37:53] where are those thine accusers? Hath no
[1:37:56] man condemned thee? She said, "No man,
[1:37:58] Lord." And Jesus said unto her, "Neither
[1:38:01] do I condemn thee. Go and sin no more."
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. And let's
[1:38:08] look to to the book of Jude, which is
[1:38:11] that small book just before the book of
[1:38:12] Revelation.
[1:38:18] And I want to read from verse 17 of the
[1:38:21] book of Jude.
[1:38:31] But beloved, remember ye the words which
[1:38:36] Oh,
[1:38:40] okay. I I'll leave you there. But
[1:38:42] beloved, remember ye the words which
[1:38:43] were spoken by before of the apostles of
[1:38:45] our Lord Jesus. How that they told you
[1:38:48] there should be mockers in the last
[1:38:50] time, who should walk after their own
[1:38:52] ungodly lust. These be they who separate
[1:38:55] themselves, sensual, not having the
[1:38:58] spirit. But ye, beloved, building up
[1:39:00] yourselves on your most holy fate,
[1:39:04] praying in the Holy Ghost, keep
[1:39:06] yourselves in the love of God, looking
[1:39:08] for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:39:11] unto eternal life. and of some have
[1:39:13] compassion making the difference and
[1:39:16] others save with fear pulling out
[1:39:18] pulling them out of the fire having even
[1:39:21] their garments spotted by the flesh. Now
[1:39:23] unto him that is able to keep you from
[1:39:26] falling and to present you faultless
[1:39:28] before the presence of his glory with
[1:39:30] exceeding joy to the only wise God our
[1:39:33] savior be glory and majesty dominion and
[1:39:36] power both now and forever and ever.
[1:39:38] Amen. May God bless his word. You may be
[1:39:40] seated. Oh, blessed be the name of the
[1:39:43] Lord.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; Praise be to Jesus.
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; I have a title tonight. And of some have
[1:39:52] compassion.
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; I have inspiration.
[1:39:57] The display of brotherly kindness as a
[1:40:00] sign of maturity.
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; That's what I have. The display of
[1:40:04] brotherly kindness as a sign of
[1:40:06] maturity. title and of some have
[1:40:10] compassion.
[1:40:11] Praise God. Now compassion is of God.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; Psalm says Psalm 78 says, "Nevertheless,
[1:40:21] they flatter him with their mouth. They
[1:40:23] lied onto him with their tongues, for
[1:40:25] their heart was not right with him.
[1:40:27] Neither were they steadfast in his
[1:40:29] covenant. But he talk about God now full
[1:40:32] of compassion forgive their iniquity and
[1:40:36] destroy them not. Yay many a time turn
[1:40:40] he his anger away and did not stir up
[1:40:43] his wrath. Micah Micah says in verse 7,
[1:40:48] chapter 7:8, he said, "Who is of God
[1:40:50] like unto thee that pardone iniquity and
[1:40:54] passeth by transgression of the remnant
[1:40:57] of his heritage? He retain not his anger
[1:41:00] forever, for he delightth in mercy. He
[1:41:03] will turn again. He will have compassion
[1:41:06] upon us. He will subdue our iniquities,
[1:41:09] and thou will cast all their sins into
[1:41:12] the depths of the sea."
[1:41:14] So our God is a God of mercy.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; He's a God of compassion. Isn't that
[1:41:18] right?
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Okay, let's go.
[1:41:20] Are you ready?
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; Oh, let's go tonight.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; What the Bible says, every divine
[1:41:26] promise in the Bible tonight is yours.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; Don't ever say, "I'm afraid it won't
[1:41:34] happen." You cannot think that. If God
[1:41:36] make a promise, he's big enough to keep
[1:41:38] it. He is big enough to confirm it. He
[1:41:41] is big enough to fulfill it. Oh, blessed
[1:41:44] be the name of the Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; Listen to this. We are Christians.
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; Born again in the same family. A bunch
[1:41:53] of pil pilgrims. Here we go. We will
[1:41:55] never see eye to eye until we see him
[1:41:58] face to face
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; and be changed and made in his own
[1:42:02] glorious image.
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; You want to be seated? Do you get that?
[1:42:07] The prophet said we will never see eye
[1:42:08] to eye until we see him face to face.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; So the objective is not to see eye to
[1:42:14] eye. THE OBJECTIVE TO SEE if we could
[1:42:16] work together in the unity of the spirit
[1:42:20] until the unity of the faith come forth.
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; Oh praise the name of the Lord. Give the
[1:42:24] Lord a shout in the house.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; Somebody said this here. Watch. I pray
[1:42:32] that you would help me and send the Holy
[1:42:34] Spirit and interpret the word that it
[1:42:37] might bring a settled basis of the
[1:42:39] eternal God and upon the basis of
[1:42:41] receiving him that we might get
[1:42:43] ourselves positionally ready for a great
[1:42:46] meeting and we expect him to break here
[1:42:49] and it will not end till Jesus come.
[1:42:51] Bless every organization in the valley.
[1:42:53] Bless the people, the ministers and
[1:42:56] pastors of different organizations.
[1:42:58] Maybe here we go. We might disagree upon
[1:43:01] some theological teachings of the
[1:43:03] scripture. But father in all one
[1:43:06] principle, we believe in God the eternal
[1:43:09] one. So help us Lord to have the unity
[1:43:13] of the spirit until the unity of the
[1:43:16] faith is brought forth.
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; And friends, I say it here, there is
[1:43:20] going to be a unity of the faith.
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; THERE ISN'T ENOUGH DEVILS IN AFRICA TO
[1:43:25] STOP IT.
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; There isn't ENOUGH DEVILS IN HELL TO
[1:43:28] STOP IT. THERE IS GOING TO BE A unity of
[1:43:30] the faith.
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; Before we get a unity OF THE FAITH,
[1:43:34] THERE'S got to be a unity of the spirit.
[1:43:36] And brother Uloo is who preached so much
[1:43:37] on that. You may be seated. Oh, praise
[1:43:39] God.
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; The unity of the spirit have nothing to
[1:43:42] do with doctrine.
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; This is not a doctrinal list. You
[1:43:49] believe that tick. You believe that
[1:43:51] tick. You believe that X.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; This is not a list. This is not an
[1:43:56] examination. This is the spirit of the
[1:43:59] living God.
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; And he said we can't you but one like
[1:44:02] Coke, one like Sprite, one like orange
[1:44:04] juice, one like pineapple juice, one
[1:44:06] like grapefruit juice.
[1:44:09] All of us don't have the same liking.
[1:44:11] One like blue, one like red, one like
[1:44:13] yellow. Whatever colors you choose,
[1:44:16] WHATEVER COLORS YOU LIKE, THAT'S HOW
[1:44:17] what made us. There are tall brothers,
[1:44:19] short brothers. There are big mountains,
[1:44:21] there are small mountains. There are
[1:44:23] small churches. They are big churches.
[1:44:25] There are big ministries. They are small
[1:44:26] ministries, BUT LOOK AT MY FINGER. HE'S
[1:44:28] A SMALL GUY, BUT I WANT HIM THERE. LOOK
[1:44:30] AT MY EARS. HE'S A SMALL GUY, BUT I WANT
[1:44:33] HIM THERE. LOOK AT MY HAND. OH, GIVE THE
[1:44:35] LORD A SHOUT. I want every part of my
[1:44:39] BODY TO BE THERE. THERE IS ONLY ONE
[1:44:41] BODY. THERE IS ONLY ONE SPIRIT. THERE IS
[1:44:43] ONLY ONE LORD. HALLELUJAH.
[1:44:47] Glory to God. You may be seated. So,
[1:44:50] this is not the church. This a
[1:44:51] fellowship here. that church that Jesus
[1:44:53] said, "UPON THIS ROCK, I'LL BUILD MY
[1:44:55] CHURCH." THAT'S THE BODY OF CHRIST. AND
[1:44:57] BY ONE SPIRIT, YOU'RE BAPTIZED INTO THAT
[1:44:59] BODY. OH, give the Lord some praises.
[1:45:02] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory to God.
[1:45:06] GOD'S CHURCH IS UNIVERSAL. GOD CHURCHES
[1:45:08] AROUND THE WORLD. THERE IS NO HIGHER
[1:45:10] CHURCH AND LOWER CHURCH. It is ONE BODY.
[1:45:13] PRAISE GOD. PRAISE GOD. WE WANT OUR
[1:45:16] ENTIRE BODY. YOU DON'T WANT YOUR EYES TO
[1:45:18] GO ON THE BACK OF THE HEAD. YOU WILL BE

[1:45:22] HALLELUJAH.
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; YOU WANT YOUR EYES IN FRONT. YOU WANT
[1:45:26] YOUR MOUTH IN FRONT. YOU WANT JUST HOW
[1:45:28] GOD MADE YOU. BUT GOD MADE THIS BRIDE
[1:45:30] BODY A CERTAIN WAY. AND HE'S IN A
[1:45:32] FIVE-FOLD MINISTRY TO GET THIS BODY
[1:45:35] RIGHT. OH, GIVE THE LORD SOME PRAISES.
[1:45:40] I like this. You may be seated, brother.

[1:45:47] devil got you fighting one another, he
[1:45:50] don't have to fight at all.

[1:45:58] WATCHING YOU fight one another and laugh
[1:46:01] at you, professing to have the Holy
[1:46:03] Ghost and fighting one another.

[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. We in a
[1:46:09] great battle saying we in a battle in
[1:46:11] sin, not one another. If we want to
[1:46:13] fight one another, then Satan can kick
[1:46:15] back and just let us fight it out. Oh,
[1:46:17] praise God. Praise God. You may be
[1:46:19] seated. So, don't let the devil laugh at
[1:46:21] us by fighting one another. Let's back
[1:46:23] each other up. But ulu, come here.
[1:46:25] Praise God. Step away. Come. Praise God.

[1:46:47] BROTHER. Back to back. Praise the NAME
[1:46:50] OF THE LORD. THE DEVIL CANNOT COME IN
[1:46:52] BETWEEN. OH, GLORY TO GOD. LAST NIGHT
[1:46:56] YOU READ THE PROPHECY THIS MORNING. WHEN
[1:46:58] THE CHURCH FINDS HIS BROTHERLY LOVE,
[1:47:00] THAT'S THE HONEY THAT STICKS. PRAISE

[1:47:10] I'LL GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT IN THE HOUSE.
[1:47:16] [Applause]
[1:47:18] As long as the devil can make you fight
[1:47:22] one another, he don't have to fight. You
[1:47:25] may be seated. I want you to take your
[1:47:26] seats. Take your seats. We have
[1:47:27] something to share with you. You have
[1:47:29] something upon our hearts. You have to
[1:47:30] listen.
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; God gave brother Banham a special
[1:47:36] experience. Amen.
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; And I want you to listen to it
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; because I feel we should read it. We
[1:47:42] should share it. You should learn from
[1:47:44] it.
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; This is brother Brown. Friends, there
[1:47:47] are so many things we could say tonight
[1:47:50] about perfection.
[1:47:52] We are always trying to gouge the eyes
[1:47:55] out of somebody else to make ourselves a
[1:47:59] little holier than they are.
[1:48:01] &gt;&gt; But if you look at the picture, it's
[1:48:04] only God's grace. that we are what we
[1:48:07] are.
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; You hear that?
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; I don't care how big the person is or
[1:48:14] how small they are. Both is God's grace.
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; I am here by God's grace.
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; You are here by God's grace.
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; It's God's grace. We are what we are.
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; No study, no whatever make us where we
[1:48:29] are. It's God's grace we are where we
[1:48:31] are.
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; Listen to brother Mara. here a long time
[1:48:34] in Ohio. I learned a lesson the hard
[1:48:36] way. I was having a meeting down in Ohio
[1:48:39] and I was staying in the country. Uh we
[1:48:42] we was eating in a Duncan restaurant.
[1:48:44] Such a lovely waitress and so on like
[1:48:46] that. And I went over a common American
[1:48:49] restaurant and I walk in the door. I
[1:48:52] hear the machine going and standing
[1:48:55] there was a man of my age, not a married
[1:48:56] man, with his arms around a woman
[1:48:58] playing sluck.
[1:49:00] I turn around in the back of the
[1:49:02] building. There was a bunch of teenage
[1:49:03] boys, rock and roll playing, young lady
[1:49:07] about 18 years, very neatly, a woman,
[1:49:10] and she was standing there with a dress
[1:49:12] hanging low in front, one of the boys,
[1:49:14] his hands on the girl where it ought not
[1:49:16] to belong. They were smoking and
[1:49:17] drinking. I look over to my right, I
[1:49:20] heard someone make a big groan, a set of
[1:49:22] aged woman, probably 60 years old, and
[1:49:25] she had vulgar clothes on, halfway up
[1:49:27] her limbs, poor little old wrinkled
[1:49:29] flesh, flabby as it could be. She had
[1:49:31] lipstick, makeup, great purple things,
[1:49:33] sign of a piece, and across the table
[1:49:35] said two men drunk. One of them big old
[1:49:38] army overcoat on. I stood there and I
[1:49:42] said, "God,
[1:49:44] why don't you destroy this whole thing?
[1:49:48] Why don't you just sink it beneath the
[1:49:50] earth?" I said, "How can you, God, in
[1:49:54] your great holiness ever stand to look
[1:49:56] at such a thing like that and not send
[1:49:58] an earthquake to sink it?" And as I was
[1:50:01] standing there
[1:50:03] condemning the woman as I was, I stepped
[1:50:06] behind the door. I felt the spirit of
[1:50:10] God come to me and I stepped behind the
[1:50:13] door.
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; I seen something whirling.
[1:50:18] And when it was, it was a vision. It was
[1:50:21] the world turning around and around and
[1:50:23] I noticed that the world was a scarlet
[1:50:25] streak around the world. And as I got to
[1:50:28] the world, I seen myself as a little boy
[1:50:31] doing things that I ought not to do.
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; But it was sin. And every time I did
[1:50:37] anything, I seen a big black shadow go
[1:50:40] towards heaven, which God could have
[1:50:42] killed me at that minute.
[1:50:44] &gt;&gt; And then I seen standing between me and
[1:50:47] God a perfect sacrifice. I seen him
[1:50:50] standing there with the thorns on his
[1:50:53] head, the spit hanging on his face. And
[1:50:56] every time my sins would start towards
[1:50:58] God, he would reach up and catch it like
[1:51:00] a bumper on a car. He would protect me
[1:51:03] from death. And every time I'll do
[1:51:06] anything wrong, God could have killed
[1:51:08] me. His holiness required it. His law
[1:51:11] required it. And every time I do
[1:51:13] anything or do anything, the blood of
[1:51:15] Jesus Christ acts like a bumper. And I
[1:51:18] seen that scarlet streak and the blood
[1:51:20] still holds dirt.
[1:51:23] As I stood looking, I got a little
[1:51:25] closer to him and I noticed I could hear
[1:51:28] him say, "Father,
[1:51:29] &gt;&gt; forgive him.
[1:51:31] &gt;&gt; He doesn't know what he's doing."
[1:51:33] &gt;&gt; I looked down and there laid a book.
[1:51:37] There was a recording angel standing by
[1:51:40] his side. And every time I sinned, it
[1:51:43] was put down on the book and my name was
[1:51:47] on it. And I realized that that blood
[1:51:50] streak would be lifted. And after
[1:51:52] standing in the presence of God with my
[1:51:55] sinful life, but I seen his mercy,
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; he was holding off to judgment, my
[1:52:00] judgment. I went to him humbly. I knelt
[1:52:03] on my knees. I said, "Oh Jesus, thou son
[1:52:06] of God, I am unworthy to come in your
[1:52:09] presence, but will you please forgive me
[1:52:11] for what I have done?" He touched his
[1:52:13] side with his hand, took the old book
[1:52:16] and wrote pardoned on it and throwed it
[1:52:19] behind him and my sins were gone.
[1:52:25] &gt;&gt; Then then he looked stern in the face.
[1:52:28] He said, "Now I have forgiven you,
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; but you want to give them her."
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; Then I seen what it meant.
[1:52:39] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[1:52:41] As I come out the vision, I walk over to
[1:52:44] her. I said, "How do you do?" She was
[1:52:47] drinking. She looked up at me. "Oh,
[1:52:48] hello." I said, "Could I sit down?" She
[1:52:51] said, "I have company." I said, "I don't
[1:52:53] mean it that way, lady. I just want to
[1:52:55] speak to you a minute." She said, "Be
[1:52:58] seated." I said, "Lady, just a few
[1:53:00] minutes ago, standing behind that door,
[1:53:03] I begin to tell her, I begin to look and
[1:53:06] the tears begin to run down her cheeks.
[1:53:08] She told me, she said, "Lady, you don't
[1:53:10] mean to do these things. Jesus died and
[1:53:13] the judgments of God is held off by his
[1:53:16] blood. You don't mean to do this." She
[1:53:18] said, "No, sir." She says, "My father
[1:53:20] was a deacon in the church. I was raised
[1:53:22] in a Christian home. My husband was a
[1:53:25] charter member, live a Christian life."
[1:53:27] She began to tell me after his death,
[1:53:29] she had two girls and she went astray.
[1:53:31] How the girls had left her and she
[1:53:33] throwed her life away and she thought
[1:53:35] that there was no more hope for her. I
[1:53:38] said, "God be merciful. Those who he for
[1:53:40] you, he has called." She said, "Are you
[1:53:42] Reverend Brandon from down there?" He
[1:53:44] said, "I am." She said, "I'm ashamed of
[1:53:46] myself to be sitting here like this."
[1:53:49] She said, "Do you think there would be a
[1:53:51] chance for me?" I said, "Jesus has his
[1:53:54] arms stretched out, waiting for you to
[1:53:57] come, lady." And the other people begin
[1:54:00] to take up. I said, "Would you walk here
[1:54:02] in this floor with me?" She said, "I
[1:54:04] will, sir." I took her by the hand. I
[1:54:07] said, "You about the age of my mother.
[1:54:09] Would you kneel here with me in the
[1:54:11] floor?" And there in the floor, we broke
[1:54:14] up that place that afternoon to an
[1:54:16] old-fashioned meeting. And God saved
[1:54:19] that woman by his grace. She has dressed
[1:54:22] herself. She is coming to meeting and
[1:54:24] she's living a Christian life tonight.
[1:54:27] Give the Lord a shout.
[1:54:29] Do you get that story? Hallelujah. You
[1:54:33] may be seated. What is it? God requires
[1:54:37] perfection.
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; He requires your repentance.
[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; He requires your loyalty to him.
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; He is looking tonight. No matter how
[1:54:46] much you have sinned, how little or how
[1:54:49] much you are still a sinner and cannot
[1:54:53] get in no other way but by Jesus Christ,
[1:54:56] God all sufficient sacrifice. YOU BUT IN
[1:54:59] HIM YOU are perfected forever.
[1:55:01] &gt;&gt; Think of it. It is nothing you do. It is
[1:55:04] not new pages you turn. It's not a new
[1:55:06] life you start. IT'S A CONFESSION of
[1:55:08] your wrong and God grace to you that
[1:55:12] brings you to perfection. And then you
[1:55:14] are perfected in Christ Jesus. Oh, glory
[1:55:18] to God. You may be seated. Give the Lord
[1:55:20] a praises.
[1:55:22] Hallelujah.
[1:55:24] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:55:27] &gt;&gt; So if we only look at the picture, it's
[1:55:30] only the grace of God.
[1:55:32] We are what we are.
[1:55:35] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; This is Jesus in Luke chapter 10.
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; He says, "Behold, a certain lawyer stood
[1:55:41] up and tempted him." You see, they only
[1:55:42] want to tempt him. They want to see how
[1:55:45] they could twist things to get Jesus say
[1:55:47] the wrong thing or say something out of
[1:55:49] scripture or out of timing. So he says,
[1:55:52] "Master, what shall I do to inherit
[1:55:54] eternal life?" And he said unto him,
[1:55:57] "What is written in the law?
[1:55:59] How readest thou? So Jesus is no fool.
[1:56:03] That is wisdom speaking there.
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; And he answered and said
[1:56:08] uh thou shalt love thy God with all thy
[1:56:10] heart, with all thy soul, with all thy
[1:56:12] strength, with all thy mind, and thy
[1:56:13] neighbor as thyself.
[1:56:16] He said unto him, thou was answered
[1:56:18] right. This do, and thou shalt live. So
[1:56:20] this man know the quotes.
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; He press play. He know where it's
[1:56:24] written.
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; He press play. He know what is spoken.
[1:56:27] He know what the prophet said. the
[1:56:30] prophet Moses, the prophet Brham. But
[1:56:33] Jesus said unto him uh uh thou has
[1:56:36] answered right this do and thou shalt
[1:56:38] live. And he here we go willing to
[1:56:41] justify HIMSELF SAID UNTO JESUS, WHO IS
[1:56:43] my neighbor?
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; Love thy neighbor. Who is my neighbor?
[1:56:50] And Jesus answers it, a certain man went
[1:56:53] down from Jericho, Jerusalem to Jericho,
[1:56:56] and fell among thieves which stripped
[1:56:58] him of his reignment and wounded him
[1:57:01] departed, leaving him half dead. And by
[1:57:04] chance, here we go. There came a certain
[1:57:06] priest that way when he saw him, he
[1:57:09] passed in the other side. Now he he
[1:57:11] spoke with books, you know, this priest,
[1:57:13] he made me wear his Bible. When he see
[1:57:16] the man there, he walk on the other
[1:57:17] side. Jesus is bringing a parable to
[1:57:19] them.
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; And by chance likewise a Levite priest
[1:57:23] now and he was at the place came look on
[1:57:26] him pass on the other side but a certain
[1:57:28] Samaritan.
[1:57:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:31] &gt;&gt; As he journey came where he was and when
[1:57:34] he saw him he had compassion on him.
[1:57:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:40] &gt;&gt; Compassion is a powerful thing.
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; Compassion could change the lives of
[1:57:44] others. COMPASSION COULD REACH where
[1:57:47] criticism cannot. WE'LL GIVE THE LORD A
[1:57:49] SHOUT IN THE HOUSE. HALLELUJAH. DO YOU
[1:57:53] GET THAT TONIGHT? Compassion could reach
[1:57:56] where criticism cannot reach.
[1:58:01] &gt;&gt; WHERE BEING JUDGMENTAL cannot reach.
[1:58:04] &gt;&gt; So this Samaritan journey. He saw him
[1:58:07] had compassion on him and he went to him
[1:58:09] and bunged up his wounds pouring in oil
[1:58:12] and wine. set him on his own beast,
[1:58:14] brought him to an inn, took care of him,
[1:58:16] and on the tomorrow when they departed,
[1:58:18] he took two pence, gave them to the
[1:58:19] host, and said, Take care of him.
[1:58:21] Whatsoever thou spend this more, when I
[1:58:23] come again, I will repay thee. Now, of
[1:58:26] these three, Jesus speaking, thinkkest
[1:58:29] thou was neighbor unto him that fell
[1:58:32] among thieves, and he said, he that
[1:58:34] showed mercy on him, Jesus said unto
[1:58:36] him, go and do thou likewise.
[1:58:39] &gt;&gt; Well, give the Lord some praises.
[1:58:42] ALL THIS TALK YOU'RE TALKING, GO AND
[1:58:44] LIVE THAT.
[1:58:45] &gt;&gt; GO AND DO THAT.
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; GO AND SHOW MERCY. GO AND SHOW GRACE. BE
[1:58:50] LIKE GOD.
[1:58:52] &gt;&gt; OH, GIVE THE LORD SOME PRAISES.
[1:58:56] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; May be seated.
[1:59:01] &gt;&gt; So among believers, there are two
[1:59:03] sections in the church.
[1:59:06] those who are strong in the Lord and the
[1:59:08] weaker ones and the ones that still
[1:59:11] getting strength. The Bible said, "And
[1:59:14] of some have compassion." Of some have
[1:59:16] compassion and having discernment to
[1:59:20] make a difference between those who are
[1:59:23] proud and arrogant and unwilling to obey
[1:59:26] the truth and those who are weak and
[1:59:29] ignorant and waver and doubt and keep
[1:59:32] doing the same things over and over
[1:59:35] again.
[1:59:36] So Jude is teaching us and showing us
[1:59:40] when to comfort and when to confront,
[1:59:43] when to have the gentle compassion and
[1:59:46] when to have urgent intervention to
[1:59:48] snatch them OUT THE FIRE. HALLELUJAH.
[1:59:51] BECAUSE THE SAME BLOOD OF JESUS for the
[1:59:54] strong ones in the church is the same
[1:59:56] blood of Jesus for the weak ones in the
[1:59:59] church. Even the ones who we think are
[2:00:02] our enemies, Jesus died for them. Give
[2:00:04] the Lord some praises. Give the Lord a
[2:00:06] shout in the house.
[2:00:08] &gt;&gt; Even the ones THAT WE MAY THINK IS OUR
[2:00:11] ENEMY, Jesus died for them.
[2:00:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. Do you believe the Lord
[2:00:16] this morning?
[2:00:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You can be seated. Praise
[2:00:20] God. Why are you saying that, brother
[2:00:22] Oid? Because we have to enter into this
[2:00:25] bride ministry of Revelation 22:17.
[2:00:29] The spirit and the bride say come. There
[2:00:33] is no way we could enter into that
[2:00:35] ministry without a revelation of
[2:00:37] forgiveness and the grace of God because
[2:00:39] that scripture said the spirit and the
[2:00:41] bride say come. Whosoever will come.
[2:00:44] &gt;&gt; Oh give the LORD A SHOUT.
[2:00:46] &gt;&gt; DO YOU KNOW WHAT WHOSOEVER WILL IS?
[2:00:48] WHOSOEVER WILL. Those that are weak and
[2:00:51] willing. THOSE THAT ARE STRUGGLING AND
[2:00:52] WILLING. THOSE THAT ARE BATTLING AND
[2:00:54] WILLING. WHOSOEVER WILL LET HIM COME.
[2:00:57] OH, GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT. THERE WILL BE
[2:00:59] A POWERFUL BRIDE MINISTRY WITH A
[2:01:02] REVELATION OF THE MERCY OF God
[2:01:05] &gt;&gt; and the grace of God. Isn't that right?
[2:01:08] Revelation says the spirit of bright say
[2:01:10] come. Let him that hear it say come. Let
[2:01:12] him that is at thirst come and whosoever
[2:01:14] will let him take the water of life
[2:01:17] freely. The challenge then is to handle
[2:01:20] whosoever will.
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; Those who are willing
[2:01:24] &gt;&gt; instead of condemning them.
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Hallelujah. Praise God.
[2:01:29] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:01:32] This message here where this pastor
[2:01:34] cutting of this one and this minister
[2:01:36] cutting of this church and this minister
[2:01:37] cutting of this one. Praise God. But the
[2:01:39] eyes are here is now open. Praise God.
[2:01:42] Praise God. That is such a wonderful
[2:01:43] thing. He stepped out and step in faith
[2:01:46] to believe he's not the only man.
[2:01:48] &gt;&gt; Think about it. Men believe they are the
[2:01:51] only one. They have the only one. They
[2:01:52] have mighty revelation. They feel they
[2:01:54] could teach ministers and teach us. What
[2:01:55] about the Holy Ghost? that leads and
[2:01:58] directs. There is going to be a unity of
[2:02:00] the faith. There's going to be a mighty
[2:02:02] onpour of dynamics. The church will find
[2:02:04] this brotherly love because I'm PROPHESY
[2:02:07] WHEN THE CHURCH FINDS HIS BROTHERLY LOVE
[2:02:09] that mean it will be lost. It'll be
[2:02:11] something you have to find, search for,
[2:02:13] BATTLE FOR, FIGHT FOR. I LOVE YOU,
[2:02:15] BROTHER. I HAVE NOTHING against you.
[2:02:17] PRAISE GOD. THAT LYING DEMON that
[2:02:19] telling you I hate you, THAT'S A LIE.
[2:02:21] PRAISE GOD. THERE'S NO hate inside of
[2:02:23] here. Oh, give the LORD SOME PRAISES.
[2:02:25] HALLELUJAH.
[2:02:27] Praise God. PRAISE GOD. PRAISE GOD.
[2:02:29] Glory to God. So compassion is not just
[2:02:32] something emotional, but an action
[2:02:34] inspired by love.
[2:02:36] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. COMPASSION IS AN ACTION
[2:02:39] inspired by love. You may be seated.
[2:02:41] Matthew 9:36. But when he saw the
[2:02:43] multitude, this is Jesus, he was moved
[2:02:45] with compassion on them because they
[2:02:47] fainted and were scattered abroad as
[2:02:50] sheep having no shepherd. Jesus himself
[2:02:53] was moved with compassion.
[2:02:55] Compassion is doing the will of God but
[2:02:57] with a heart like God. To have
[2:03:00] compassion is to feel deeply for others
[2:03:03] in their weakness and move to help them.
[2:03:06] Not not your weak. What your soul
[2:03:14] [Applause]
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; that good for you.
[2:03:17] &gt;&gt; HE SAID LISTEN TO ME.
[2:03:21] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH.
[2:03:23] &gt;&gt; That man with compassion.
[2:03:25] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:03:28] &gt;&gt; Even while helping others, we are warned
[2:03:31] to take heed ourselves.
[2:03:33] &gt;&gt; Galatians 6:1. Brethren, if a man be
[2:03:35] overtaken in a fault, ye which are
[2:03:38] spiritual, restore such a one in the
[2:03:41] spirit of meekness,
[2:03:43] considering thyself, least thou also be
[2:03:48] tempted.
[2:03:49] So in OTHER WORDS, THERE IS A WAY TO
[2:03:51] RESTORE. YOU CANNOT JUST DO IT BECAUSE
[2:03:53] YOU'RE IN POWER. YOU CANNOT DO IT
[2:03:54] BECAUSE YOU'RE YOU'RE a deacon or a
[2:03:56] minister or a bishop OR SOMETHING LIKE I
[2:03:58] SAY TO YOU AND THIS AND THAT. NO.
[2:04:03] Because men who sometime do that they
[2:04:05] themselves come and fall. So you have to
[2:04:08] TAKE HEED IN RESTORING OTHERS. YOU ARE
[2:04:10] PROTECTING YOURSELF. YOU ARE COVERED
[2:04:12] YOURSELF RECOGNIZING THAT YOU ARE
[2:04:14] STANDING BUT BY THE GRACE OF GOD.
[2:04:18] I remember years ago a brother came to
[2:04:19] me. He said, "Bro, I will never fall."
[2:04:22] &gt;&gt; May be seated.
[2:04:27] &gt;&gt; Fall.
[2:04:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:28] &gt;&gt; Long-standing brother message.
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; I said nothing. He said, "But you can
[2:04:36] say that." I said, "Not at all." No, no,
[2:04:38] I can't say that. I say I'm in his
[2:04:40] hands.
[2:04:41] &gt;&gt; If he only pull, I fall.
[2:04:45] I can't say I will never fall.
[2:04:47] &gt;&gt; I am in his hands.
[2:04:49] &gt;&gt; He is holding me up.
[2:04:51] &gt;&gt; He is keeping me up.
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; His grace is keeping me. His love is
[2:04:55] keeping me. His mercy is keeping me. His
[2:04:58] blood is keeping me. If he move his
[2:05:00] hands, I'm falling. Oh, give the Lord
[2:05:02] some praises. Hallelujah.
[2:05:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:05:07] &gt;&gt; I think I just have one more with Jesus.
[2:05:09] This is Jesus. Luke 7. He was passing in
[2:05:12] a city called Naine. Many of the
[2:05:13] disciples went with him and much people.
[2:05:15] And he came night to the gate of the
[2:05:17] city. Behold, there was a dead man
[2:05:18] carried out, the only son of his mother,
[2:05:22] and she was a widow.
[2:05:25] Much pe of the city was with her. And
[2:05:27] when the Lord saw her, he had compassion
[2:05:30] on her, and said unto her, weep not. And
[2:05:33] he came and touched the fire.
[2:05:35] &gt;&gt; And they that bear him stood still. He
[2:05:37] said, Young man, I say unto thee, arise.
[2:05:41] And he that was dead sat up and be to
[2:05:44] speak and he delivered him to his
[2:05:47] mother. This is the ministry of Jesus
[2:05:49] Christ. Full of grace, full of love,
[2:05:52] full of compassion. Are we going to see
[2:05:54] that again?
[2:05:58] WHEN JESUS CHRIST IS THE SAME YESTERDAY,
[2:06:01] TODAY, and forever,
[2:06:04] &gt;&gt; compassion moves one into action.
[2:06:07] Compassion doesn't criticize AND
[2:06:09] CONDEMN. COMPASSION MOVES YOU INTO
[2:06:11] ACTION TO HELP, to assist. Somebody fall
[2:06:14] in a hole, pick them up. Somebody need
[2:06:16] encouragement, encourage them. Let the
[2:06:18] strong encourage the weak. Let us help
[2:06:20] one another. Pull up one another. Back
[2:06:23] one another. Fight for ONE ANOTHER
[2:06:25] BECAUSE I NEED YOU AND you need me. Give
[2:06:28] the Lord some praises.
[2:06:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, turn around and shake somebody NEXT
[2:06:31] TO YOU. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. Glory to
[2:06:35] God. AMEN. HALLELUJAH.
[2:06:37] &gt;&gt; GLORY. GLORY.
[2:06:40] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. Praise God.
[2:06:43] Praise God. Praise God. Praise God.
[2:06:46] Praise God. Oh, glory. Hallelujah.
[2:06:50] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:06:52] Hallelujah. Glory.
[2:06:55] My God. I'm feeling something moving.
[2:06:58] Glory.
[2:07:00] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory. You may
[2:07:03] be seated. You know the story of the
[2:07:05] prodigal son. Listen, you see sit sit on
[2:07:09] a minute.
[2:07:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:11] &gt;&gt; I have to beg them to sit down. I like
[2:07:13] this church. I like those people. I like
[2:07:15] the people here. I have to beg them sit
[2:07:18] down. They're on fire.
[2:07:20] &gt;&gt; You know the story, political son. This
[2:07:22] man have his children. This young son,
[2:07:24] he been hearing some kind of heavy dub
[2:07:26] music or some pop music and so on and he
[2:07:28] want to get away from church. So he
[2:07:29] said, "Daddy, I want my money now. I
[2:07:31] don't want to WAIT TILL YOU'RE DEAD.
[2:07:32] AMEN. NOW, FATHER, FATHER, give him." He
[2:07:36] went out. First thing you do, he buy a
[2:07:37] fast fancy car, red. EVERYBODY KNOW HE
[2:07:40] GONE FAR COUNTRY. You can't text him.
[2:07:43] You can't WhatsApp him. You can't talk
[2:07:44] to him. He don't want nobody know where
[2:07:45] he's at. But man, he having a great time
[2:07:48] spending his money. He spending his
[2:07:49] money and spending his money. He have
[2:07:50] money friends. When you have money
[2:07:51] friends, they only come around when he
[2:07:53] have money. And after a while, money run
[2:07:56] out. When the money run out, the friends
[2:07:58] run out, too.
[2:07:59] &gt;&gt; Now, all the time when the money run
[2:08:01] out, he's still going out and shaking
[2:08:03] people hand and everything else. And
[2:08:05] when he land by the big house if people
[2:08:07] think he living in a big house, no, he
[2:08:09] was in the band behind the house. So he
[2:08:11] passing by the big house because money
[2:08:14] ran out. So he is renting in a band
[2:08:17] behind the house eating thick food
[2:08:21] &gt;&gt; and one day Bible said he came to
[2:08:23] himself.
[2:08:25] And some of us something have to hit you
[2:08:28] for it to come to yourself. TO CUT OUT
[2:08:30] THE CRAP THAT YOU'RE DOING, YOU HAVE TO
[2:08:32] COME TO YOURSELF. He came to himself and
[2:08:36] say, "I will arise. I'll go to my
[2:08:37] father. I say I I've sinned. I'm no
[2:08:39] longer worthy to be called a son."
[2:08:42] &gt;&gt; Then he went home. He coming home now.
[2:08:44] He's coming home. He's coming home. His
[2:08:45] head down.
[2:08:47] &gt;&gt; He wanted to be a servant.
[2:08:48] &gt;&gt; Now, once a son,
[2:08:51] &gt;&gt; always a son.
[2:08:53] &gt;&gt; Once a son,
[2:08:55] &gt;&gt; always a son. Now, he's a son, but he's
[2:08:57] coming his head down like this. The
[2:09:00] father looking out EVERY EVENING
[2:09:03] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE FATHER KNEW ONE DAY HE GOING
[2:09:06] to come back.
[2:09:07] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:09:09] &gt;&gt; THE FATHER KNEW HIS WALK.
[2:09:11] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. SO WHEN he look in THE
[2:09:12] DISTANCE SAW SOMEBODY WALKING BUT THAT
[2:09:14] LOOKING LIKE him that looking like him.
[2:09:17] Now this is the verse I want to get to.
[2:09:19] Luke 15:20.
[2:09:21] And he arose and came to his father be
[2:09:24] his part. But when he was yet great way
[2:09:27] off, his father saw him and had
[2:09:30] compassion and ran and fell on his neck
[2:09:34] AND KISSED HIM. OH, WHAT A FATHER. OH,
[2:09:37] GLORY TO GOD. THIS RASCAL SON. THIS
[2:09:39] RENEGADE SON. THIS BAD MONEY SPENDING
[2:09:42] SON. THIS SON THAT SHAMED THE FAMILY.
[2:09:45] THIS SON THAT MADE NEWSPAPER. THIS SON
[2:09:47] THAT MADE THE NEWS. WHEN THE FATHER SAW
[2:09:50] HIM, THE FATHER HAD COMPASSION ON HIM.
[2:09:52] THE FATHER RAN TO HIM. THE FATHER THAT
[2:09:54] HUGGED HIM, THE FATHER THAT KISSED HIM.
[2:09:56] OH, GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT.
[2:09:59] HEAVEN REJOICES.
[2:10:01] HEAVEN REJOICES WHEN ONE COME BACK. WHEN
[2:10:05] ONE SINNER COME BACK.
[2:10:08] [Applause]
[2:10:12] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:10:14] &gt;&gt; I know some of compassion.
[2:10:17] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[2:10:19] &gt;&gt; You may be seated. So when the son
[2:10:21] coming back, the father given
[2:10:23] instructions, kill the fatted calf, make
[2:10:26] merry, make some good stew
[2:10:31] &gt;&gt; and some fufu
[2:10:33] &gt;&gt; AND SOME RICE. MAKE SOME GOOD BEANS.
[2:10:36] MAKE IT GOOD.
[2:10:38] &gt;&gt; Watch this. His older brother
[2:10:41] &gt;&gt; never sin. Never fail. Never spend a bad
[2:10:44] naira.
[2:10:49] faithful, never miss church, never miss
[2:10:52] A SILVER, NEVER HAD A BAD RECORD. WHEN
[2:10:55] HE HEAR THE NOISE, he said, "What going
[2:10:56] on there?"
[2:10:57] &gt;&gt; S's happy, happy, happy. They say, "Your
[2:10:59] brother come back." He said, "With that
[2:11:00] rascal come back."
[2:11:04] &gt;&gt; Your father kill the fatted calf. No,
[2:11:06] fatted calf.
[2:11:08] &gt;&gt; Fatted calf. THE ONE I FEEDING every
[2:11:11] day,
[2:11:12] &gt;&gt; the man upset for some beef.
[2:11:15] The brother have problems BECAUSE HIS
[2:11:16] NEXT BROTHER WILL COME BACK GETTING some
[2:11:18] beef.
[2:11:19] &gt;&gt; He stay there and not coming inside.
[2:11:21] He's next. Now you see these spirits is
[2:11:24] only exposed when righteousness have TO
[2:11:26] UNFOLD. WHEN MERCIES ARE TO UNFOLD, WHEN
[2:11:29] THAT BUBBLY RIVER OF LIFE, WHEN THAT
[2:11:32] WATER START TO FLOW, YOU'RE GOING TO SEE
[2:11:34] ALL KIND OF ATTITUDES, ALL KIND OF
[2:11:35] BEHAVIORS BECAUSE HE HE'S A RIGHTEOUS
[2:11:37] ONE IN CHURCH. He's a good boy in
[2:11:38] church. But here his brother come back
[2:11:40] and he get a robe. He get a ring. He get
[2:11:43] some food. his father to go and tell
[2:11:45] him, "Brother, all this is yours."
[2:11:48] &gt;&gt; Like that big brother have no
[2:11:49] revelation. All what I have is yours.
[2:11:52] Your brother don't spend his own
[2:11:53] already. He get enough food. He get a
[2:11:55] plate.
[2:11:57] &gt;&gt; For a robe, a ring, a plate of food. YOU
[2:11:59] KIND WITH YOUR FOOLISHNESS. And all that
[2:12:01] I have is yours.
[2:12:03] &gt;&gt; That's an example here.
[2:12:05] &gt;&gt; And of
[2:12:07] compassion.
[2:12:08] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:12:10] &gt;&gt; Could we continue?
[2:12:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:12:14] But the random said, "Faith," You may be
[2:12:16] seated. Faith is based on forgiveness.
[2:12:20] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[2:12:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:12:22] &gt;&gt; NOW WE GETTING SOMEWHERE.
[2:12:24] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. NOW WE getting somewhere.
[2:12:26] Faith is based
[2:12:29] &gt;&gt; on forgiveness.
[2:12:30] &gt;&gt; Where did God put brotherly kindness?
[2:12:33] &gt;&gt; Seventh age. What did the prophet call
[2:12:36] brotherly love? The blood for the age.
[2:12:39] Each age have to display the blood for
[2:12:43] the age. So almighty God in his wisdom
[2:12:46] put brotherly kindness in the right
[2:12:48] place.
[2:12:49] &gt;&gt; He put the brotherly kindness just under
[2:12:51] Holy Spirit.
[2:12:53] &gt;&gt; So to access Holy Spirit,
[2:12:55] &gt;&gt; you have to come true brotherly
[2:12:57] kindness. You cannot jump and bypass
[2:13:00] brotherly kindness. YOU CANNOT JUMP FROM
[2:13:02] GODLINESS. Even if YOU LIKE GOD, THE
[2:13:05] WORD HAS TO BECOME FLESH. EVEN IF YOU'RE
[2:13:08] LIKE GOD, IT HAS TO EXPRESS TO YOUR
[2:13:10] BROTHER. BECAUSE JESUS SAID, "BY THIS
[2:13:12] SHALL ALL MEN KNOW THAT YOU AND MY
[2:13:14] DISCIPLES WHEN YOU HAVE LOVE ONE FOR
[2:13:17] ANOTHER." AND WHEN YOU HAVE LOVE, YOU
[2:13:19] COULD SEE IT. WHEN YOU HAVE LOVE, YOU
[2:13:20] COULD FEEL IT. WHEN YOU HAVE LOVE, YOU
[2:13:22] COULD TOUCH IT. OH, GIVE THE LORD A
[2:13:24] SHOUT IN THE HOUSE. LOVE IS NOT A RANDOM
[2:13:26] THING. LOVE IS A POWERFUL THING. LOVE IS
[2:13:29] THE GREATEST FORCE ON EARTH.
[2:13:37] Maybe sees it.
[2:13:39] &gt;&gt; Faith,
[2:13:41] &gt;&gt; not mysteries. Faith is based upon
[2:13:44] forgiveness. Faith is based upon
[2:13:46] forgiveness. No forgiveness, no faith.
[2:13:49] &gt;&gt; Information, yes. Revelations, yes.
[2:13:51] Mysteries, yes. But no faith. Not doubt
[2:13:53] in his heart, but shall believe that
[2:13:55] those things which he said that come to
[2:13:57] pass, he shall have what he said.
[2:14:00] &gt;&gt; That's the third pull.
[2:14:01] &gt;&gt; Then he speak about the second pull.
[2:14:03] I'll say it this way. Therefore, I say
[2:14:05] unto you, whatever things you desire
[2:14:07] when you pray, believe you have received
[2:14:09] them, and you shall have them.
[2:14:11] &gt;&gt; So, you believe in the have it before
[2:14:12] you get it.
[2:14:13] &gt;&gt; Second pull.
[2:14:14] &gt;&gt; Then he dropped the first pull.
[2:14:17] &gt;&gt; But when you stand praying, forgive if
[2:14:21] you have ought against any,
[2:14:22] &gt;&gt; that your father which in heaven may
[2:14:24] forgive you or your trespasses. But if
[2:14:26] you do not forgive, neither will your
[2:14:28] father which is in heaven forgive your
[2:14:30] trespasses. You may be seated. So people
[2:14:32] fooling themselves in this message with
[2:14:35] their hate, with their unforgiveness,
[2:14:37] thinking the win is some rapture.
[2:14:38] They're going straight to the
[2:14:39] tribulation with that foolishness.
[2:14:41] Because we cannot approach God with an
[2:14:42] unforgiving heart. He said, "If you know
[2:14:44] you have something against your brother,
[2:14:46] leave your gift at the altar. Go and
[2:14:48] make it right with your brother and then
[2:14:49] come back to the altar and God will send
[2:14:51] fire upon you." Oh, GIVE THE LORD A
[2:14:53] SHOUT IN THE HOUSE. I will say it again.
[2:14:56] IF YOU KNOW YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO MAKE
[2:14:57] RIGHT to your brother or your sister,
[2:14:59] LEAVE YOUR GIFT. GO AND MAKE IT RIGHT.
[2:15:01] COME BACK TO THE ALTAR AND FIRE FROM
[2:15:03] heaven will come down upon you. THE FIRE
[2:15:05] OF THE HOLY GHOST, HALLELUJAH, WILL COME
[2:15:07] DOWN UPON YOU BECAUSE THE ORDER OF THE
[2:15:09] SPIRIT, FAITH IS BASED UPON FORGIVENESS.
[2:15:12] OH, GLORY. I DON'T CARE WHAT MIGHTY MAN
[2:15:14] IN THE MESSAGE SAY. I DON'T CARE WHAT
[2:15:16] MESSAGE POPE SAY. FAITH IS BASED UPON
[2:15:19] FORGIVENESS. OH, glory to God. And
[2:15:21] people have wronged you. PEOPLE HAVE
[2:15:22] WRONGED ME. THEY HAVE WRONGED US. BUT
[2:15:24] GOD NOT TESTING THEM. GOD TESTED YOU.
[2:15:27] GOD IS TESTING ME. GOD IS TESTING US.
[2:15:30] WHAT WE GOING TO DO? OH, GIVE THE LORD A
[2:15:33] SHOUT.
[2:15:41] BROTHER, brother words. Now, faith is
[2:15:45] based on forgiveness. And when we said
[2:15:48] this morning trying to get the church
[2:15:50] into a place to where we could really
[2:15:52] see apostolic times among us, that's
[2:15:54] what we hunger. It's laid right there
[2:15:56] before before at the door. We see it but
[2:15:59] we want to see more of it. We wanted
[2:16:01] such a flow. It will be help to us now
[2:16:03] to flow out to others. Now this
[2:16:05] forgiveness thing is not new. It was an
[2:16:09] issue among the disciples because in
[2:16:12] Matthew 18:21-22
[2:16:14] then came Peter to HIM AND SAID LORD HOW
[2:16:16] OF SHALL I MY BROTHER SIN AGAINST ME and
[2:16:18] I forgive him
[2:16:19] &gt;&gt; till seven times. There's a big number
[2:16:21] in that time.
[2:16:23] &gt;&gt; Peter had a big question. How often MUST
[2:16:25] I FORGIVE MY BROTHER IN CHURCH?
[2:16:28] HALLELUJAH.
[2:16:30] &gt;&gt; How much? Seven times.
[2:16:33] &gt;&gt; Jesus say unto him, I say not under the
[2:16:35] until seven times, but until 70* 7
[2:16:41] &gt;&gt; a day,
[2:16:44] &gt;&gt; not 70* 7 on stone like that 20 year
[2:16:47] that 20 year vision,
[2:16:48] &gt;&gt; I'll forgive you accordingly. No.
[2:16:50] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:16:51] &gt;&gt; So forgiveness was an issue with the
[2:16:54] disciples. And now we come to the
[2:16:56] scripture which is the host pastor have
[2:16:58] as the key to the convention in Luke
[2:17:00] 15:8-9.
[2:17:02] Which woman having 10 pieces of silver
[2:17:04] if she lose one doesn't light a candle?
[2:17:07] Sweep the house and seek diligently till
[2:17:09] she find it. And when she found it, she
[2:17:12] called her neighbors and friends. You
[2:17:13] may be seated. You know, if you don't
[2:17:15] want your neighbor to know your house is
[2:17:17] dirty, you have to sweep carefully.
[2:17:19] &gt;&gt; You can't just sweep
[2:17:21] &gt;&gt; and all kind of things come out the
[2:17:22] house. said, "Oo, it's a long time she
[2:17:25] have this swept up house. The house is
[2:17:26] very dirty." So, so if you if you're
[2:17:29] careful now, you got to sweeping in the
[2:17:30] corner, sweeping in the corner because
[2:17:32] you don't want the neighbors to think
[2:17:34] your house is dirty. Your house dirty,
[2:17:35] but you're sweeping carefully. But this
[2:17:37] woman, she's smarter than that. She lost
[2:17:40] her coin. She don't want a husband come
[2:17:42] and see her without that coin. She want
[2:17:44] to find it. So, she was throwing up
[2:17:45] carpet. She was throwing out mats. She
[2:17:48] didn't care what the neighbors thought
[2:17:49] about her. THEY SAY, "OH GOD, she house
[2:17:52] dirty. She's throwing out everything.
[2:17:54] The kitchen sink. She's throwing a pot
[2:17:56] pan. SHE'S LOOKING FOR HER COIN." WHEN
[2:17:58] SHE FOUND THE COIN, SHE SAID, "HOW I
[2:18:00] FOUND IT. I FOUND IT. COME AND REJOICE
[2:18:03] WITH ME BECAUSE I FOUND WHAT I LOST."
[2:18:06] OH, GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT. AND THE
[2:18:08] PROPHET SAID, "WHEN THE CHURCH FINDS HIS
[2:18:10] BROTHER LOVE, WHEN THE CHURCH FINDS it
[2:18:12] holy decency, when the church finds it
[2:18:14] place in Christ, it will call to the
[2:18:16] other members of the body." He said, "I
[2:18:18] don't care if you're Baptist, Methodist,
[2:18:19] whatever you are. I don't care what
[2:18:21] interpretation, six seals, half seal, NO
[2:18:23] SEAL, QUARTER SEAL, SEVEN SEALS. It
[2:18:25] doesn't know what you believe. IT
[2:18:26] DOESN'T MATTER. REJOICE WITH me because
[2:18:28] I found the coin that was lost." Oh,
[2:18:30] glory to God. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH.
[2:18:34] &gt;&gt; WHAT A BREAKTHROUGH.
[2:18:35] &gt;&gt; TO BE COVERED with love.
[2:18:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:40] &gt;&gt; When the church finds
[2:18:42] &gt;&gt; it's brotherly love.
[2:18:43] &gt;&gt; Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord.
[2:18:45] &gt;&gt; You are be seated.
[2:18:47] I want to get this. I know brother Isaac
[2:18:50] spoke about it the honey sticks but I
[2:18:52] want to bring the context and brother
[2:18:54] Brandham preaches message blas names and
[2:18:56] he's talking about the sister had a
[2:18:57] dream and this dream is connected to the
[2:19:00] message. He said what if God requires us
[2:19:02] to receive the holy ghost and I don't
[2:19:03] have it. So he was talking about Peter
[2:19:05] say faith first then virtue knowledge
[2:19:07] and so on like that. He said now God is
[2:19:09] bringing seven church ages. God is
[2:19:11] building seven churches for the a bride
[2:19:12] of Christ. Here is our sister's dream.
[2:19:15] Now she was worried whether she had the
[2:19:18] Holy Ghost or not. And when she lay down
[2:19:20] her husband was reading a paper and she
[2:19:22] was got upright. She was walking in the
[2:19:24] floor and she dreamed she was up on a
[2:19:26] mountain and watch and he be to see it.
[2:19:29] She saw a large man standing there with
[2:19:31] work clothes on sleeves rolled up
[2:19:33] bailing the most pure water she ever
[2:19:35] seen pouring into this box. This rock
[2:19:38] box sitting on the top of the mountain
[2:19:40] and the rock box could not hold the
[2:19:42] water and boil it out. roll down the
[2:19:44] mountain, roll over her feet. She was
[2:19:46] standing right in that stuff. Only it
[2:19:48] didn't stick to her. And then she asked
[2:19:51] why the box didn't hold it. The man said
[2:19:53] that is not water. That is the Holy
[2:19:55] Ghost and nothing will hold it. And she
[2:19:59] said now uh she took a big bucket that
[2:20:02] was full of honey and poured the honey
[2:20:04] into there. She said no, it will hold
[2:20:07] this. She thought the box was a rock
[2:20:10] box. She thought it was going to burst
[2:20:11] and spill the honey, but it didn't. It
[2:20:14] finally stuck together and held it. She
[2:20:17] saw she went down the mountain going to
[2:20:18] the mountain. She saw five streams and
[2:20:20] so like that. And then he said, "No
[2:20:22] more. I picked up the letter. I read it.
[2:20:24] I saw her dream." And the and then he be
[2:20:27] interpreted interpret the dream. Now
[2:20:29] here is the interpretation of the dream.
[2:20:31] She was dreaming. She was bothered about
[2:20:34] the Holy Spirit in so much. She seen the
[2:20:36] box on top of the mountain was the rock
[2:20:38] confession like Jesus said in the
[2:20:40] scripture watch and so on like that
[2:20:42] right he said each church age has a rock
[2:20:45] confession on up to this rock confession
[2:20:46] of the loudia here we go you cannot make
[2:20:49] a holy church
[2:20:52] there's no such thing as a holy church
[2:20:55] &gt;&gt; how many people believe this
[2:20:57] &gt;&gt; so how come this brother church more
[2:20:58] holy than this one there's no such thing
[2:21:01] as a holy church he said there's no such
[2:21:03] thing as a holy church or holy holy
[2:21:05] organ ization. The Holy Spirit can be
[2:21:07] preached in it, but in there you would
[2:21:10] find good, bad, renegades, indifferent,
[2:21:15] and everything else.
[2:21:17] &gt;&gt; So an organization will not hold.
[2:21:19] &gt;&gt; You can't say we got it. None of the
[2:21:23] rest of them has it. No sir, the Holy
[2:21:26] Spirit is poured out on individuals.
[2:21:29] &gt;&gt; Could we give the Lord a shout?
[2:21:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. HALLELUJAH. SO THIS
[2:21:33] TABERNACLE IS NOT A HOLY Ghost
[2:21:36] tabernacle. There is no such a thing.
[2:21:38] Individuals that come into this church
[2:21:41] is Holy Ghost tabernacles.
[2:21:44] &gt;&gt; They are the tabernacles that contain
[2:21:46] the Holy Ghost,
[2:21:47] &gt;&gt; but not the church as a body.
[2:21:49] &gt;&gt; So the body cannot hold the Holy Ghost,
[2:21:51] but you can.
[2:21:53] &gt;&gt; You as an individual can hold the Holy
[2:21:56] Ghost.
[2:21:57] Now watch this man who was pouring the
[2:22:00] water was the messenger to the church.
[2:22:03] Pouring the message into the church.
[2:22:05] What was the water doing? It was boiling
[2:22:07] out the trash that was in it. That is
[2:22:10] what the Holy Spirit does.
[2:22:13] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. SO ACCORDING TO THIS DREAM,
[2:22:15] the water of the word, the water of the
[2:22:18] message WAS BEING POURED INTO THE CHURCH
[2:22:20] and it was boiling the trash, rolling it
[2:22:21] down.
[2:22:22] &gt;&gt; Why was it DOING THAT? BECAUSE HONEY IS
[2:22:25] NEXT.
[2:22:27] IN OTHER WORDS, IT HAS TO BE A CLEANING
[2:22:29] OUT
[2:22:30] &gt;&gt; FOR GOD TO POUR IN THE HONEY.
[2:22:32] &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH. IT BEHOLD THIS.
[2:22:36] &gt;&gt; He said, watch the honey represent
[2:22:39] brotherly love, brotherly kindness,
[2:22:41] which is this age. I just telling you
[2:22:44] brotherly kindness, the age we live in.
[2:22:45] Now, you might say, I shout like brother
[2:22:47] Neville. I shouted like brother Jones
[2:22:49] and something like that. But let's let
[2:22:51] something happen to him. Your heart is
[2:22:53] broke. It just kills you. We can obtain
[2:22:57] brotherly kindness and feeling for one
[2:22:59] another.
[2:23:00] &gt;&gt; You can't stay home by yourself and get
[2:23:02] brotherly kindness. You can't shake
[2:23:04] yourself and boy I love you and look in
[2:23:05] the mirror like take a selfie or some
[2:23:07] kind of things. So it can't work. You
[2:23:08] have to be in church. Somebody have to
[2:23:10] step on your toes. Somebody have to
[2:23:11] upset you and whatnot. And you have to
[2:23:13] say I forgive you. That have to come out
[2:23:15] your mouth. I forgive you. What do you
[2:23:18] forgive me? Forgive me please. These are
[2:23:20] the words have to come out your mouth.
[2:23:22] &gt;&gt; What sayest thou? Oh my. Hallelujah.
[2:23:26] &gt;&gt; Praise be to Jesus.
[2:23:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:23:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:23:32] &gt;&gt; He didn't say when the church finds uh
[2:23:34] uh mighty men of God or when the church
[2:23:36] find teachers or preachers. He said when
[2:23:38] the church finds this brotherly love.
[2:23:41] &gt;&gt; He said we need to work with love first.
[2:23:44] Let me tease a little bit.
[2:23:47] Ram talk about new heart, new spirit
[2:23:49] &gt;&gt; and the Holy Spirit.
[2:23:51] God give you a new heart because your
[2:23:53] heart is hard towards God. You have to
[2:23:54] take a heart switch and give your heart
[2:23:56] towards God. And you see, I'll give you
[2:23:58] a new spirit which is a sanctified
[2:24:01] spirit
[2:24:01] &gt;&gt; because the spirit you have cannot work
[2:24:04] with the Holy Spirit.
[2:24:05] &gt;&gt; So the new spirit is to prepare you to
[2:24:08] receive his spirit.
[2:24:11] [Music]
[2:24:12] Hallelujah.
[2:24:13] &gt;&gt; Question. Is it that brotherly love has
[2:24:17] to come that we could get to be able to
[2:24:19] work with charity?
[2:24:21] Because we have to have something to
[2:24:23] work with, you know? In other words,
[2:24:25] brotherly kindness is like that foreast
[2:24:27] of getting into the love of God itself.
[2:24:30] And that brotherly kindness has to come
[2:24:32] on display. And that has to come on
[2:24:34] display to each other
[2:24:37] &gt;&gt; with each other.
[2:24:38] God will set up the conditions just
[2:24:41] right to see one if you will forgive two
[2:24:45] if you will ask for forgiveness
[2:24:47] &gt;&gt; not I see if you make it right first it
[2:24:51] have that I waiting to see if you come
[2:24:53] to me
[2:24:56] &gt;&gt; you know somebody has something against
[2:24:57] you you go to them
[2:24:59] &gt;&gt; and say free yourself
[2:25:00] &gt;&gt; you don't need to hold that against me
[2:25:03] &gt;&gt; you don't wait I'm waiting to see they
[2:25:05] come because they wrong me and and
[2:25:07] you're waiting
[2:25:08] It come like a h wife pray for her
[2:25:09] husband and when the husband come back
[2:25:11] she still want to make demands in him.
[2:25:16] &gt;&gt; She still want to squeeze him.
[2:25:18] &gt;&gt; He did wrong things or she did wrong
[2:25:20] things and he still happened of it over
[2:25:23] and over and over and over and we have a
[2:25:26] scripture for you and of some
[2:25:29] have compassion.
[2:25:31] &gt;&gt; How do we go past the past?
[2:25:33] How do we get a clarity of forgiveness
[2:25:36] without bringing up the person's faults
[2:25:38] and failures and embarrassing them and
[2:25:41] shame them?
[2:25:47] &gt;&gt; So the honey is more than just brotherly
[2:25:49] KINDNESS TO ME. THE honey represent
[2:25:52] rightess.
[2:25:53] &gt;&gt; It represent maturity.
[2:25:55] &gt;&gt; It represents US COMING INTO ORDER
[2:25:58] BECAUSE AFTER GODLINESS IS TO BE like
[2:25:59] God. You would think it would finish
[2:26:01] there. But on top of godliness, God
[2:26:03] chown how do we express this godliness
[2:26:06] but accept through brotherly kindness.
[2:26:09] &gt;&gt; Not the word becomes word.
[2:26:12] &gt;&gt; The word becomes flesh
[2:26:14] &gt;&gt; and could take you and pick you up and
[2:26:16] buy you a dinner.
[2:26:18] &gt;&gt; The word becomes flesh. Could have
[2:26:20] compassion AND SEE THE MULTITUDE AND
[2:26:22] break the bread and multiply and feed
[2:26:23] the multitude. The word becomes flesh.
[2:26:26] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN YOUR WORD BECOME FLESH, you can
[2:26:28] handle it.
[2:26:29] &gt;&gt; You could touch it. You can taste IT
[2:26:32] BECAUSE THE WORD IS NOT IN THE BOOKS AND
[2:26:34] IN THE TAPES. THE WORD IS ALIVE.
[2:26:36] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:26:38] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT'S GOD'S OBJECTIVE. FROM
[2:26:40] SPIRIT TO WORD TO FLESH.
[2:26:42] &gt;&gt; NOW HE WANTS TO BE IN YOUR FLESH. WEAR
[2:26:45] YOUR JACKET AND PUT ON YOUR TIE. PUT ON
[2:26:47] YOUR SHOES AND YOUR DRESS. THE WORD MADE
[2:26:49] FLESH. OH, give the Lord a shout in the
[2:26:52] house.
[2:26:53] [Applause]
[2:26:59] Now this is not something like a gift.
[2:27:02] You have to walk in it. You have to
[2:27:04] cultivate it to demonstrate that Jesus
[2:27:06] did something very unique. You may be
[2:27:07] seated. He take the basin of water and
[2:27:09] he come to the feet. Now everybody know
[2:27:12] that the lowest job in the in that time
[2:27:14] to wash somebody's feet.
[2:27:15] &gt;&gt; PETER SAID NO DON'T TOUCH ME. DON'T
[2:27:17] TOUCH ME. Jesus said if if I don't do
[2:27:20] this he p say he want a bath now. He
[2:27:22] want the whole water. He want
[2:27:23] everything.
[2:27:25] &gt;&gt; Jesus washed their feet.
[2:27:28] &gt;&gt; Yes. And then he said this, "You see
[2:27:30] what I did to you? I am the boss. I am
[2:27:33] your master. And if I could do that, I
[2:27:36] WANT THAT DONE TO ONE ANOTHER."
[2:27:39] [Applause]
[2:27:41] &gt;&gt; OH, give the Lord some praises.
[2:27:44] [Applause]
[2:27:45] I know it have those who would like me
[2:27:48] to preach about Russia and Ukraine and
[2:27:51] the vials and the trumpets and the this
[2:27:53] and the that and that. I'm not here to
[2:27:54] preach on that. I'm here to preach on
[2:27:56] what God put up on my heart.
[2:28:00] I just tell people what I'm not
[2:28:01] preaching right now. I'm not preaching
[2:28:02] Ukraine, Russia, Pope and all that. I'm
[2:28:04] not the Catholic Church and what not.
[2:28:06] I'm not here to preach about President
[2:28:08] Tariff and all all of this.
[2:28:12] &gt;&gt; Putin
[2:28:14] not here for that. This concerns us.
[2:28:19] &gt;&gt; We need forgiveness.
[2:28:21] &gt;&gt; We need compassion. We need to see the
[2:28:24] MERCY OF GOD. MANY LIVES HAVE BEEN
[2:28:26] DESTROYED, WRECKED, CRUSHED
[2:28:29] BY CHURCH HOAX.
[2:28:32] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:28:33] &gt;&gt; THE BRIDE BODY NEED A HEALING.
[2:28:37] &gt;&gt; IS THERE NO BOMB IN GILLY?
[2:28:40] &gt;&gt; IS THERE NO PHYSICIAN PHYSICIAN THERE?
[2:28:45] [Applause]
[2:28:47] &gt;&gt; Is it look like a honey won't stick? It
[2:28:50] will stick. It will stick. We have to
[2:28:53] want IT TO STICK. HALLELUJAH.
[2:28:56] &gt;&gt; WE HAVE TO MAKE IT STICK.
[2:28:58] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:28:59] &gt;&gt; I remember a pastor have issues with me
[2:29:01] and we were in a prayer line
[2:29:02] &gt;&gt; and he's ducking me, shaking everybody
[2:29:04] hand and I'm following him.
[2:29:08] Yes. Talking him cuz he greeting this
[2:29:10] one. He greet this one. But I am
[2:29:12] checking myself to see if I have
[2:29:15] something against him. When he turn
[2:29:17] around, you see me. Oh, God bless you,
[2:29:20] brother. I recognize I have nothing
[2:29:22] against him. He have his issues and
[2:29:25] because he have his issues that don't
[2:29:26] mean I have to take on his issues and my
[2:29:28] issues. I am not buying nobody's fight
[2:29:30] and I'm not taking on anybody monkey.
[2:29:32] You know sometimes somebody put a monkey
[2:29:34] in your back and you to take on nobody
[2:29:36] monkey. You have your own backpack to
[2:29:38] deal with. You have your own issues to
[2:29:41] deal with. Fight to make sure your heart
[2:29:43] is right. Fight and protect your spirit.
[2:29:47] Guard your heart. OH GIVE THE LORD SOME
[2:29:49] PRAISES. HALLELUJAH.
[2:29:51] As we come down TO THIS HOME STRETCH,
[2:29:54] YOU HAVE TO GUARD YOUR HEART.
[2:29:56] &gt;&gt; WHY? WHY YOU SAY THAT? BECAUSE THE BULL
[2:29:58] IS COMING.
[2:29:58] &gt;&gt; YES.
[2:30:01] &gt;&gt; What bull you talking about? The bullet
[2:30:02] test coming. You know,
[2:30:04] &gt;&gt; you may be sees it.
[2:30:06] &gt;&gt; But Abraham one time was passing through
[2:30:07] a field and he forget there was a bull.
[2:30:10] It was a killer bull. The bull have a
[2:30:11] name. The bull have a reputation. It's
[2:30:13] not bull killable. He just killed
[2:30:15] people. And but Abraham said he forgot
[2:30:17] his gun. He said if he only had the gun
[2:30:19] he shoot human shoot the bull and pay
[2:30:22] for the bull. But God arranged it that
[2:30:25] forget the bull and the bull he's in his
[2:30:27] own thing. He's coming down to kill the
[2:30:30] prophet and the prophet stood there.
[2:30:32] &gt;&gt; He felt he's finished. Something came
[2:30:33] over him.
[2:30:35] &gt;&gt; Wasn't some mystery,
[2:30:37] &gt;&gt; not some violence or angel. No, no.
[2:30:39] Something came over him. He said he felt
[2:30:41] a love. No fear whatsoever. He said
[2:30:44] bull. So what's happened here now? He's
[2:30:45] in the back garden of Eden like Adam. He
[2:30:47] said, "Bull, I'm a servant of Jesus
[2:30:49] Christ. I'm coming to pray for somebody.
[2:30:51] Go back and lie down." And the bull
[2:30:54] here, here that get it here. I call that
[2:30:56] bull language. It is a language. You
[2:30:58] see, you have the evil language and the
[2:31:00] house language and the roba language.
[2:31:02] Praise God. We have a bull language that
[2:31:04] the bull understand. YOU CAN'T BEAT THE
[2:31:06] BULL WITH MYSTERIES. YOU CAN'T TELL HIM
[2:31:08] WHAT THE VIABLE BULL IN JESUS NAME. YOU
[2:31:10] KNOW WHAT THIS BOOK IS? THIS BOOK AND
[2:31:11] YOU GO in a prophet in Jesus know that
[2:31:14] the bull not LISTEN TO THAT. YOU HAVE TO
[2:31:15] HAVE LOVE. OH, GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT.
[2:31:18] THE BULL have a language. A language.
[2:31:20] THE BULL UNDERSTAND. THE LION UNDERSTAND
[2:31:22] IT. THE ANIMALS HAVE INSIDE IT. EVERY
[2:31:24] DEMON UNDERSTAND IT. IT'S THE POWER OF
[2:31:27] LOVE.
[2:31:31] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:31:32] &gt;&gt; That bull is coming. The bull is on his
[2:31:35] way.
[2:31:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:31:38] &gt;&gt; So this church, this Bryant church has
[2:31:41] to live its virtue.
[2:31:43] &gt;&gt; It has to come to rightness. Because
[2:31:45] brother Ram said faith could grow and
[2:31:47] faith could ripen. He talk about Abraham
[2:31:50] having what he called he said um the the
[2:31:53] fullness of believing. I like that
[2:31:54] terminology. Abraham came to the
[2:31:56] fullness of believing. So it have faith
[2:31:58] that could start. It have mental faith.
[2:32:00] It have spiritual faith. It have faith
[2:32:02] that could grow, faith that could ripen,
[2:32:04] faith that could mature and have light
[2:32:06] on faith. While brotherly kindness is
[2:32:07] the rightness of that pyramid because
[2:32:09] brotherly kindness is setting you up
[2:32:11] that charity could come down. Paul
[2:32:13] called charity the bund of perfectness
[2:32:15] to seal the whole building and to seal
[2:32:17] the whole thing. Praise God to the
[2:32:18] church in this message. How much of them
[2:32:20] have come to brotherly love? How much of
[2:32:21] them must talk about the coin? They
[2:32:22] don't even talk about the coin. Talking
[2:32:24] about six seals, seven seals, seven
[2:32:25] thunders, seven mysteries, new name. You
[2:32:27] could pack it and pack it and pack it
[2:32:29] and pack it. But we have to see some
[2:32:30] life some point in time. We have to see
[2:32:32] something that ATTRACTS GOD. OH, GIVE
[2:32:34] the Lord some praises. God told John the
[2:32:37] one on upon whom you see the dove coming
[2:32:40] and remaining that's the important part
[2:32:42] the important part is remain because the
[2:32:45] dove does land sometime and then take
[2:32:46] OFF WHEN THE DOVE HIT AND SEE WHAT THAT
[2:32:51] WHEN THE DOVE HIT AND SEE THE CHARACTER
[2:32:53] DOVE TAKE OFF SO JOHN WAS LOOKING FOR
[2:32:56] WHO REMAINING WHAT SPIRIT FALLING AND
[2:32:58] REMAINING WHEN HE SAW JESUS COME HE SAW
[2:33:00] THE DOVE coming down upon him and the
[2:33:01] dove improve him because he was the lamb
[2:33:03] he had the living faith living virtue,
[2:33:06] living knowledge, THE FULL VIRTUES ALL
[2:33:08] INSIDE OF HIM THUNDERING. HALLELUJAH.
[2:33:10] Lightning voices. He said that's the
[2:33:12] one. Behold the lamb of God. OH, GIVE
[2:33:14] THE LORD A SHOUT. AND ONE OF THESE DAYS
[2:33:17] WHEN ALL THESE VIRTUES ARE READY, GOD
[2:33:19] WILL PICK YOU OUT AND CALL YOU ASIDE AND
[2:33:22] SAY, "THIS IS MY SON IN WHOM I AM
[2:33:25] PLEASED TO DWELL IN." LOOK ONE HERE.
[2:33:27] LOOK ONE THERE. IDENTIFY WITH YOU.
[2:33:30] Praise God.
[2:33:34] Who is your neighbor?
[2:33:36] &gt;&gt; We answered that already.
[2:33:38] &gt;&gt; Your attitude towards your neighbor.
[2:33:40] &gt;&gt; Love God. Like the commandments have
[2:33:42] love God. Keep the Sabbath day and whatn
[2:33:43] not. Part of it is towards God and the
[2:33:45] pastor is to your neighbor. Don't cover
[2:33:48] your neighbor's wife. Don't take your
[2:33:49] neighbor's goods. Is your neighbor who's
[2:33:51] next to you? Who's your neighbor? Oh,
[2:33:53] praise God. God want the church to love
[2:33:55] him. So love, brotherly love is the
[2:33:59] forgiveness the honey displayed and then
[2:34:01] the cap is ready to come down upon the
[2:34:03] church. So forgiveness become a key
[2:34:06] &gt;&gt; to unlock the door of blessings.
[2:34:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I want you to get that.
[2:34:10] Forgiveness begin become the key this
[2:34:12] highlight in other words to get to the
[2:34:14] Holy Spirit slot to get to THE HOLY
[2:34:16] SPIRIT. HALLELUJAH. HAVE TO bust through
[2:34:19] this thing called prenil. Oh praise God.
[2:34:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:34:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So the bride will come to
[2:34:25] maturity. Praise God. If you don't
[2:34:27] forgive, you get cut off. People don't
[2:34:30] even know their ought, their grudges cut
[2:34:32] them off.
[2:34:33] &gt;&gt; Praise God. But Galatians 5:26, let's
[2:34:36] see how much time. Are we going good?
[2:34:38] Almost. Galatians 5:26. Let us not be
[2:34:40] desirous of vain glory, provoking one
[2:34:43] another, envying one another. In the
[2:34:45] amplified it says, "Let us not be
[2:34:47] vlorious and self-conceited, competitive
[2:34:50] and challenging and provoking and
[2:34:52] irritating one another, envying and
[2:34:55] being jealous of one another." Oh,
[2:34:58] praise God. So whenever we take brother
[2:35:00] godly love truly seek brotherly love,
[2:35:04] get in the attitude of forgiveness and
[2:35:06] letting things go and letting things
[2:35:07] drop, we become a strong church. We
[2:35:10] become a strong people because listen,
[2:35:12] mercy is not weakness.
[2:35:16] Amen.
[2:35:17] &gt;&gt; Jesus at the cross.
[2:35:20] The thief.
[2:35:21] &gt;&gt; The thief. The old thief. Never carry a
[2:35:24] Bible. Never get baptized in Jesus name.
[2:35:26] Never read a SPOKEN WORD BOOK. NEVER
[2:35:28] COME TO CHURCH. A OLD THIEF.
[2:35:31] &gt;&gt; A real thief.
[2:35:33] &gt;&gt; No bo.
[2:35:36] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "LORD, REMEMBER ME." AND JESUS
[2:35:38] TURNED TO him
[2:35:40] &gt;&gt; and said, "Today,
[2:35:43] &gt;&gt; look at THE OTHER ONE. MAKE A DIFFERENCE
[2:35:46] BETWEEN THESE two things.
[2:35:49] Make a difference BETWEEN THESE JESUS."
[2:35:51] ONE SAY, "WHY YOU SAVE YOURSELF AND SAVE
[2:35:54] ME TOO? YOUR OLD TEETH. YOU'RE NOT EVEN
[2:35:57] REPENTING. You're looking for
[2:35:58] salvation."
[2:36:01] &gt;&gt; Make a difference.
[2:36:02] &gt;&gt; Two thieves on the cross. One say,
[2:36:04] "Lord, remember me." He said, "Today
[2:36:06] &gt;&gt; you will be with me."
[2:36:08] &gt;&gt; Not tomorrow, no. Today
[2:36:10] &gt;&gt; you will be with me. He said the right
[2:36:12] thing. The right words come out of his
[2:36:14] mouth. Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[2:36:17] &gt;&gt; Oh, GLORY TO GOD. HALLELUJAH.
[2:36:19] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH.
[2:36:22] &gt;&gt; SO, brotherly kindness is a real
[2:36:24] revelation. You may be seated. Brotherly
[2:36:26] kindness is a real spirit. It's a spirit
[2:36:28] of forgiveness. I'm not talking
[2:36:30] brotherly kindness as a text as a
[2:36:32] message to preach as brotherly kindness
[2:36:33] and forgiveness and you're not forgiven
[2:36:35] and you're not what are we not talking
[2:36:36] about that ministers could do that I'm
[2:36:38] not talking about that you may be seated
[2:36:41] &gt;&gt; all right so we can wrap up now seated
[2:36:45] &gt;&gt; oh glory hallelujah
[2:36:48] &gt;&gt; so we want to go to the text that we
[2:36:50] read this woman that was caught in the
[2:36:52] very act of adultery you may be seated
[2:36:57] &gt;&gt; they come to see if they could trap
[2:36:58] Jesus
[2:37:00] They come to see if they could get Jesus
[2:37:01] to questions Moses teaching.
[2:37:04] &gt;&gt; So they caught the woman in the act.
[2:37:05] They have it on videape. They put it on
[2:37:07] Facebook, WhatsApp. Everybody know about
[2:37:10] her. And I want to show you something.
[2:37:12] How something can go from public to
[2:37:15] private. This is public public
[2:37:18] knowledge. She's caught in a very act.
[2:37:21] She's ashamed. Her face is down. Her
[2:37:24] face is low. They only have one thing
[2:37:26] for Jesus. It is written.
[2:37:29] We have it in the books and tapes. She
[2:37:31] shall be stoned. And Jesus do like in
[2:37:34] your hair. He said, "All right." And the
[2:37:37] pepper in him, master,
[2:37:40] &gt;&gt; she shall be stoned. And Jesus come out
[2:37:43] from the writing and say, "Well, okay.
[2:37:46] Um, AMEN."
[2:37:48] &gt;&gt; THAT'S MOSES WORD. HALLELUJAH. GLORY.
[2:37:51] &gt;&gt; MOSES. MO MOSES GIVE YOU THE WORD BUT
[2:37:54] BEFORE YOUR STONE BE BEFORE YOU LOOSE
[2:37:56] YOUR STONES BEFORE YOU CONDEMN the woman
[2:37:59] I just want you to check yourself and
[2:38:01] SEE WHICH ONE OF YOU HALLELUJAH WITHOUT
[2:38:04] sin
[2:38:07] &gt;&gt; feel LIKE DANCING NOW WHICH ONE OF YOU
[2:38:10] WITHOUT SIN CAST THE FIRST stone
[2:38:14] now this is the part I want to get to
[2:38:15] you
[2:38:17] Jesus could have watched them in your
[2:38:19] face see straight through them by
[2:38:21] resentment and know those hypocrites
[2:38:24] that was condemning that woman.
[2:38:26] &gt;&gt; But you know what he did? He turned his
[2:38:28] back to them.
[2:38:30] He didn't shame them.
[2:38:32] This is important now.
[2:38:34] &gt;&gt; He didn't embarrass them.
[2:38:36] &gt;&gt; He didn't belittle them.
[2:38:38] &gt;&gt; He leave them to themselves.
[2:38:40] &gt;&gt; He turned his back. AND HE BEGIN TO
[2:38:42] WRITE ON THE GROUND. AND WHEN THEY WERE
[2:38:44] ALL GONE, AND HE KNEW they were all
[2:38:47] gone, THE WOMAN HERSELF DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
[2:38:50] THEY WERE ALL GONE. She was in tears.
[2:38:52] She was there with her head down. All of
[2:38:54] a sudden, Jesus turned. He said, "Woman,
[2:38:58] I'm going to call this case now."
[2:39:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. CASE CALL. WHERE ARE THINE
[2:39:03] ACCUSERS?
[2:39:04] &gt;&gt; Because if you don't have an accuser,
[2:39:06] you don't have a case.
[2:39:08] [Applause]
[2:39:13] Court is in session.
[2:39:16] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. COURT IS IN
[2:39:19] SESSION. I COME TO DEAL WITH THIS CASE.
[2:39:22] WHERE ARE YOUR ACCUSERS? SHE LOOK
[2:39:24] AROUND. SHE SAID, "There is none."
[2:39:26] &gt;&gt; None, my Lord. He said, "Neither. Do I
[2:39:29] condemn thee? Go and sin no more.
[2:39:32] &gt;&gt; He was sinless and he did not condemn
[2:39:35] her." He addressed something higher than
[2:39:38] that. He free her from her guilt. He
[2:39:41] free her from her past. He free her from
[2:39:43] her fears. Nobody was there when HE
[2:39:46] FORGIVE HER. NOBODY WAS THERE when mercy
[2:39:50] was extended to her. She had was to GO
[2:39:52] HOME WITH REVELATION. NOBODY HEARD IT.
[2:39:56] NOBODY FELT IT. NOBODY SAW IT. NOBODY
[2:40:00] EXPERIENCED IT AND OF SOME
[2:40:03] &gt;&gt; of compassion. Jesus had it
[2:40:06] &gt;&gt; and he demonstrated it. Amen. Amen.
[2:40:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:40:12] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:40:13] &gt;&gt; SO WHY ARE YOU STILL BRINGING UP WHAT
[2:40:15] YOUR HUSBAND DID?
[2:40:16] &gt;&gt; WHY ARE YOU BRINGING UP WHAT YOUR WIFE
[2:40:18] DID, WHAT THIS BROTHER DID, OR WHAT THIS
[2:40:20] sister did? Why you still bringing it
[2:40:22] up?
[2:40:23] &gt;&gt; When you going to let it go?
[2:40:25] &gt;&gt; When you will give it up.
[2:40:27] &gt;&gt; Your sin, your sin, your sin, your sin.
[2:40:29] I could tell you one more. The woman at
[2:40:30] the well, Jesus had to deal with that
[2:40:32] issue himself. He send his disciples by
[2:40:36] McDonald's, Kentucky Fried Chicken, I
[2:40:37] don't know, whoever around here. He's
[2:40:39] sending them to get vitual. He said,
[2:40:40] "Go, go. I I don't want to leave around
[2:40:42] with this happening." He's waiting for
[2:40:44] this woman to come. Hallelujah. The
[2:40:46] woman don't know who she is. She don't
[2:40:47] know her name is on the book. She don't
[2:40:49] know Jesus is the book. So, he know what
[2:40:51] is in the book. The woman come.
[2:40:54] Hallelujah. And he begin to give me
[2:40:55] water. You know the conversation and so
[2:40:57] on. And Jesus said, "Go call your
[2:40:59] husband." She said, "I have none." He
[2:41:00] said, "You spoke well. You had five and
[2:41:01] the one you're living with is not yours.
[2:41:03] He didn't open HIS EYES BIG WOO SO MUCH.
[2:41:06] A man. No, he didn't. HE SAID, "I DID
[2:41:08] NOT COME TO ADDRESS THAT." He did not
[2:41:10] come to address that. He said, "Woman,
[2:41:13] begin to talk to her." She said, "I
[2:41:14] heard that Jerusalem is a place for
[2:41:16] people to worship." He said, "Woman, the
[2:41:17] hour come now is when the true
[2:41:19] worshippers will worship the father in
[2:41:21] spirit and in the truth." And Jesus give
[2:41:23] the big bomb. I that speak to you. I'm
[2:41:24] he. But I want you to share something.
[2:41:26] When Jesus revealed himself to that
[2:41:28] woman, she ran into the city. When you
[2:41:30] get revelation, you can't walk.
[2:41:32] REVELATION IS WINE. WORD IS WATER. YOU
[2:41:35] DON'T GET HIGH ON WATER, YOU GET HIGH ON
[2:41:37] WINE. WINE JUST MAKE YOU BEHAVE
[2:41:39] DIFFERENT. SHE RAN INTO THE CITY. COME
[2:41:40] SEE A MAN. THEY SAID ANOTHER ONE. SHE
[2:41:42] SAID, "NO, NO, NO. NOT THAT KIND OF ONE.
[2:41:44] THERE'S A DIFFERENT ONE. THERE'S A
[2:41:45] PERFECT ONE. THERE'S A MAN CALLED JESUS.
[2:41:47] COME SEE A MAN. Isn't this the Christ?"
[2:41:51] Revelation. What did Jesus do there? He
[2:41:53] never address her condition. He never
[2:41:55] addressed all how she had lived. Her
[2:41:57] life was bad. Her life was messed up.
[2:42:00] What he addressed was her name on the
[2:42:01] book. And to release her to higher
[2:42:03] order, a higher life, and she was
[2:42:06] delivered. Oh, praise God. Oh my, I'm
[2:42:09] almost finished.
[2:42:11] We just come up, please.
[2:42:14] 1 Corinthians 2:6, Paul speaks, "How we
[2:42:16] yet we speak wisdom among them and are
[2:42:18] perfect, yet not the wisdom of this
[2:42:20] world." And this wisdom is in amplified
[2:42:24] spiritually mature Christians. So this
[2:42:27] word perfect means mature.
[2:42:30] &gt;&gt; Now watch. Maturity. The ability to
[2:42:33] accept responsibility for your words,
[2:42:36] actions, and attitudes without blaming
[2:42:38] others. The ability to respond to
[2:42:41] situations with wisdom, patience,
[2:42:43] self-control rather than impulse. Praise
[2:42:46] God. That is maturity. No excuses. There
[2:42:49] are too many people say, "He made me do
[2:42:51] it. She made me do it. And that is why I
[2:42:53] did it." No. Responsibility is you did
[2:42:56] it. I am responsible. I will say to my
[2:42:59] father, I will get it right tonight.
[2:43:01] Praise God. Almost done. Ephesians 4:13.
[2:43:05] Till we all come to the unity of the
[2:43:07] faith and of the knowledge of the son of
[2:43:09] God, unto a perfect man, unto the
[2:43:12] measure of the stature of the fullness
[2:43:14] of Christ, that we henceforth be no more
[2:43:16] children. The object is for the children
[2:43:18] to come into maturity. That we carried
[2:43:21] away but every man of doctrine but
[2:43:23] speaking the truth in love that we don't
[2:43:24] be tossed to and fro. That's the purpose
[2:43:26] of the maturity that you wouldn't be
[2:43:29] instable unstable but you will be
[2:43:32] stabilized by love and faith. I cut and
[2:43:35] rooted in love. LET EVERY DOCTRINE COME.
[2:43:37] YOU move with it. You move with it.
[2:43:39] You're unstable. You're going back and
[2:43:40] forth, back and forth. So maturity means
[2:43:42] coming into that rightness. Isn't that
[2:43:44] right? So maturity, I'm closing it, is
[2:43:47] reflected in discernment,
[2:43:50] not just knowledge of the word, but the
[2:43:53] wisdom to apply that knowledge. And you
[2:43:55] get in Hebrews 5, last scripture, if
[2:43:57] you're going to play something softly.
[2:43:58] For everyone that drinks every milk is
[2:43:59] unskillful in the word of righteousness,
[2:44:01] for he's a babe. But strong meat belong
[2:44:04] to them that are of full age, even those
[2:44:06] who by reason of use have their senses
[2:44:09] exercised to discern both good and evil.
[2:44:11] The evidence of maturity is fruit and of
[2:44:14] some have compassion. God is calling us
[2:44:17] to high maturity. May the Lord bless
[2:44:18] you. Thank you again. God bless you.
[2:44:22] This is what I have for you to share.
[2:44:23] God be with you. Praise the Lord.
[2:44:26] [Music]
[2:44:32] Give God praise.

[3:17:12] glory. and on some have compassion.
[3:17:17] What a word in due season.
[3:17:20] We have a note of praise from uh brother
[3:17:23] Hugh Williams. He said, "I've not been
[3:17:25] sleeping well as I was getting up four
[3:17:28] to five times during the night. And
[3:17:30] after the prayer service on Friday
[3:17:32] night, I slept through the night until
[3:17:34] 5:00 a.m. Saturday morning.
[3:17:37] [Applause]
[3:17:43] That was a prayer service with a
[3:17:45] difference. All praises to God. Thank
[3:17:47] you, brother Isaac, for yielding to the
[3:17:49] leading of the Holy Spirit from Brother
[3:17:50] Hugh.
[3:17:52] Amen. And I know on Friday, Brother
[3:17:56] Anthony would have messaged me to
[3:17:57] remember him in prayer with his heart
[3:17:59] palputations. And by the time the prayer
[3:18:01] service was over, he messaged me and
[3:18:02] said during the service, it went as
[3:18:04] well. So we thank God that he's a prayer
[3:18:07] answering God and he's a present help in
[3:18:10] time of trouble you know and if we keep
[3:18:12] yielding to him and we keep bringing our
[3:18:15] situation to him and we keep agreeing in
[3:18:17] prayer one for another then everything
[3:18:19] will start to leave you all your pain
[3:18:21] your sickness your problems your issues
[3:18:23] that's the season we are living in we're
[3:18:25] in a season of a prayer answering God
[3:18:27] moving in and out into your home into
[3:18:29] your family into your life can we give
[3:18:31] the Lord a hand of praise
[3:18:34] Amen. But I don't see any written prayer
[3:18:37] requests uh before the desk this
[3:18:40] evening. So let's
[3:18:43] let's bow our heads for a word of
[3:18:44] prayer. And if you have a request that
[3:18:46] you have not written as we approach a
[3:18:48] throne of grace to bring our petitions
[3:18:50] before him, let's do so by the grace of
[3:18:53] God. Heavenly Father, we thank you to be
[3:18:55] in your presence in your house today one
[3:18:57] more time. And Lord, for Lord, the food
[3:18:59] that you prepared for us in the form of
[3:19:01] the word that we could eat and we could
[3:19:03] feast and we could be nourished and we
[3:19:05] could be sustained. We could be
[3:19:07] encouraged. We could be edified. We
[3:19:08] could be raised up and lifted up to we
[3:19:11] could keep pressing the battle. Father,
[3:19:13] we bring every brother, every sister
[3:19:14] before you, Lord. We thank you that you
[3:19:17] are a prayer answering God. And Lord, as
[3:19:20] we come to the end of this service and
[3:19:21] we prepare to leave, but not from your
[3:19:23] presence, Father, may you touch each
[3:19:25] one, may you grant the desires of your
[3:19:27] hearts, of your people, Lord, every hand
[3:19:29] that was raised for every situation,
[3:19:32] Lord, that they may be dealing with or
[3:19:34] they may have needs of, Lord, we want to
[3:19:36] remember them in a special way, Father.
[3:19:38] Lord, may you speak to the heirs of
[3:19:40] salvation and minister to the airs of
[3:19:42] salvation. We want to remember our
[3:19:44] pastor in a special way even now as he
[3:19:46] prepares to head to the airport.
[3:19:48] momentarily Lord to begin the journey
[3:19:51] back home. May you strengthen his body.
[3:19:53] We have already received testimonies of
[3:19:54] the service in Lagos today and how it
[3:19:56] was such a blessing. So we thank you for
[3:19:58] the gift for the love gift that you are
[3:20:00] placed Lord in this portion of the body.
[3:20:02] Father we pray you strengthen your
[3:20:04] servant. Grant him safe traveling
[3:20:06] journeys and Lord strength back into his
[3:20:09] body as he comes back to us. Lord may
[3:20:11] you bless his wife. with me. May you
[3:20:12] bless Lord the ministers, the song
[3:20:14] leaders, the elders, the deacons, the
[3:20:16] ushers, the trustees, the musicians, the
[3:20:19] technicians, the Sunday school, the
[3:20:21] choir, Lord, the helps and the
[3:20:23] governments. Father, every aspect of the
[3:20:25] church, may you be with your people. May
[3:20:27] you grant traveling mercies and bring us
[3:20:29] back at the appointed time in the
[3:20:31] precious name of Jesus Christ. And the
[3:20:32] church says,
[3:20:34] &gt;&gt; amen and amen. You may be seated for a
[3:20:36] few announcements. So I have a few
[3:20:38] announcements and then we have a brief
[3:20:40] very brief meeting after church to just

[3:21:01] meeting once again. And I want to
[3:21:02] encourage you because we're in a
[3:21:04] different season and um God has a way of
[3:21:08] doing things that breaks the routine and
[3:21:10] interrupting our schedules and changing
[3:21:12] things up. So you don't want to miss any
[3:21:13] service. Don't take it for granted and
[3:21:16] your blessing might be locked up in a
[3:21:17] service. So make every effort to be in

[3:22:22] could be able to cater uh effectively
[3:22:24] and make the necessary preparations uh
[3:22:27] for this. We want to also remind the
[3:22:29] church of our special upcoming meetings
