[10:59] praise the name of the Lord God bless
[11:01] you amen so we get
[11:14] ready we have just closed a big meeting
[11:19] of Five Nights at the
[11:22] Tabernacle where by God's grace and by
[11:25] his help I have tried hard by the
[11:30] scriptures to set in order the Church of
[11:34] the Lord Jesus
[11:36] Christ as we believe at the brandham
[11:41] Tabernacle the first thing I wish to say
[11:46] is that the pastor is always in full
[11:51] charge of the Tabernacle in my
[11:56] absence and I only look to the pastor
[11:59] when I return so he is in full charge to
[12:04] change or to do whatsoever he thinks its
[12:07] best under the leadership of the Holy
[12:09] Spirit while I am
[12:13] away we
[12:15] believe in an Apostolic Church teaching
[12:20] Apostolic
[12:21] blessings for our peoples of this day we
[12:26] believe in the Full Gospel
[12:29] and believe that all of the signs and
[12:32] the Wonders that was spoken of by our
[12:36] Lord Jesus Christ would accompany his
[12:39] church until he returns we believe in
[12:42] those
[12:43] things and believe that they are to be
[12:46] set in
[12:47] order that the church has its
[12:51] order and each church has its doctrines
[12:55] and Order and
[12:57] discipline our church has no members as
[13:02] joiners we believe that the whole
[13:05] Universal Church of the Living God is
[13:08] our brothers and
[13:09] sisters and all people are always
[13:13] welcome regardless of what denomination
[13:16] they belong to at the ram Tabernacle at
[13:19] eth and Penn Street in Jeffersonville
[13:22] Indiana we believe in justification by
[13:26] faith Romans
[13:31] 51 we believe that after a person being
[13:34] justified by faith he has peace with the
[13:38] Lord Jesus Christ but it's possible that
[13:42] this same person could have
[13:45] habits such as drinking smoking doing
[13:49] things that he should not do filthy
[13:52] habits of the flesh then we believe that
[13:55] the blood of Jesus Christ sanctifies
[13:58] this person
[13:59] for the service of the Lord and that's
[14:02] we believe in sanctification according
[14:04] to Hebrews
[14:06] 13 12 and
[14:08] 13 for
[14:10] Jesus also that he might sanctify the
[14:14] people with his own blood suffered
[14:16] without the
[14:17] gates and we believe that sanctification
[14:19] is taught in the New Testament and meant
[14:23] for the Believers through the New
[14:26] Testament age which we're now
[14:30] living and we also believe that after
[14:33] the the person has been Sanctified the
[14:37] unclean habits is gone from the person
[14:40] he's the believer on the Lord Jesus
[14:42] Christ and his habits are gone we
[14:44] believe that then he is a candidate for
[14:47] the baptism of the Holy Spirit which
[14:50] comes as a filling of the
[14:54] believer and then when the believer it's
[14:57] just as many times as I have taught it
[15:00] like picking up a glass out in the
[15:02] chicken yard justification is picking it
[15:05] up ready for to use it with a purpose in
[15:08] heart that's what God does to The Sinner
[15:10] he's still filthy then he's cleansed by
[15:14] the blood of Jesus Christ and the word
[15:17] sanctify is a compound word which means
[15:20] cleaned and set aside for
[15:24] service in the Old Testament the alar
[15:27] Sanctified The Vessel
[15:29] and it was set aside for service we
[15:32] believe that the holy spirit is putting
[15:34] the same vessel in service that the holy
[15:37] spirit is uh not another step of Grace
[15:42] but more of the same Grace that fills
[15:45] the believer to the extent where that
[15:49] signs and wonders such as the apostolic
[15:52] gifts spoken of in 1 Corinthians 12
[15:55] manifest themselves through this
[15:58] believer when the Holy Spirit comes in
[16:01] to take up the gift I believe at the
[16:05] scripture teaches that gifts and
[16:07] callings are without repentance that
[16:09] when we're born in this world we are
[16:12] sent here by one purpose that is of god
[16:16] and that before we're even become adults
[16:20] while we're yet children the gifts that
[16:22] we have of God is in a sand and only the
[16:26] filling of the Holy Spirit puts the
[16:28] gifts in operation but we have them in
[16:31] the beginning such as teachers and
[16:34] apostles and and Prophets and Gifts of
[16:37] tongues and the nine spiritual gifts
[16:40] according to 1 Corinthians
[16:42] 12 now we believe that these gifts are
[16:45] in operation today and they should be in
[16:48] ever local church although in such we
[16:51] have found throughout the world that
[16:54] there's much fanaticism hooked along
[16:58] with people who profess to be uh
[17:01] Apostolic Believers just as they are
[17:04] other orders and so forth we have
[17:07] Fanatics that's been all along we've had
[17:10] those to the ages they had it in the
[17:12] apostolic day and as Paul said there
[17:16] that how that some had come and persuade
[17:18] them away after other doctrines and so
[17:21] forth but in his own teaching he said if
[17:24] an angel from heaven would teach
[17:25] anything else and what he had taught let
[17:28] be a curse so we as the brandom
[17:32] Tabernacle at ath and Pinn Street year
[17:34] try to follow the teachings of the New
[17:36] Testament for we believe that Jesus
[17:39] Christ being the Son of God and Paul the
[17:42] Apostle was a called and chosen vessel
[17:46] by election of God to be sent to the
[17:50] Gentile Church to set it in
[17:52] order now we believe in water baptism in
[17:56] the brandom Tabernacle by
[17:58] nursing in the name of the Lord Jesus
[18:01] Christ which is the apostolic uh
[18:04] teaching of the
[18:06] Bible and may all members of the or
[18:10] comers to the brandom Tabernacle who
[18:12] desire such May at any time requesting
[18:16] to be immersed in the name of the Lord
[18:18] Jesus May consult the pastor if they
[18:21] have repented and believed on the Lord
[18:23] Jesus Christ the pastor will as soon as
[18:27] possible even then if he can baptize
[18:30] them immediately this does bring them
[18:32] into the Fellowship of the Believers we
[18:35] believe that by water baptism we are
[18:37] brought into a fellowship but by the
[18:40] baptism of the Holy Spirit we're brought
[18:42] into the members being members of the
[18:45] body of Jesus Christ which is all over
[18:48] the
[18:49] world
[18:51] now another thing that we believe that
[18:54] the manifestation of the spirit is
[18:56] giving to every man to prophit with all
[19:00] now we believe that when these gifts and
[19:03] so forth are operating in the church
[19:05] which we covet and desire that the
[19:09] people who are gifted by the Spirit come
[19:12] and worship with us now in most places
[19:15] we find that when these gifts in the
[19:18] people the people does not understand
[19:21] how and when to use these gifts and in
[19:25] doing so they only bring a reproach
[19:28] which we believe would be just what
[19:30] Satan could do to make The Outsiders the
[19:34] unbelievers and so forth afraid of this
[19:37] wonderful blessing that God has given to
[19:39] the church in these
[19:42] days Paul said when there come a
[19:45] stranger Among Us and we've all speak
[19:48] with tongues won't the man go away and
[19:51] say we were mad but if one would
[19:54] prophesy and make KNN the secret of the
[19:56] heart then they would fall fall down and
[19:58] say truly God is with you am now we
[20:01] believe that the spiritual gifts among
[20:04] the
[20:05] Believers is the order of the
[20:08] dayl we cannot believe that a man can
[20:12] preach under
[20:14] inspiration and then or be an inspired
[20:17] teacher and then Deni the gift of
[20:20] healing or the gift of Prophecy or
[20:23] speaking with tongues or interpretation
[20:25] of tongues or any of these other gifts
[20:28] so therefore here is
[20:31] my belief in God's word the way the
[20:36] brandom Tabernacle at eth and Penn
[20:38] Street year in jonville should be
[20:42] operated I think the first thing and
[20:46] believe that these things which I say is
[20:49] essential and must be carried out in
[20:52] this manner in the Bram Tabernacle for
[20:54] it to prosper in the
[20:57] Lord and if at any time these this would
[21:00] be
[21:01] question the person who is in question
[21:03] about it may consult me if they cannot
[21:07] get to the pastor or they could consult
[21:10] the pastor if I'm home off for some of
[21:13] the trips I'll be glad to to help either
[21:18] the leoty or the pastor at any time and
[21:21] these things are scripturally and I
[21:23] believe it's the order of the church I
[21:26] think first that every every member or
[21:29] every worshipper of the brandom
[21:32] Tabernacle should be so much in Divine
[21:35] love with each other until it would
[21:40] their hearts would long for each other
[21:43] when they have to go away to leave each
[21:45] other at the service at night I am a
[21:48] True Believer in Divine love the Apostle
[21:53] Paul said that was evidence of the Holy
[21:55] Spirit by this man all man will know
[21:58] you're my disciples said
[22:01] Jesus when you have love one for the
[22:04] other and we believe that it's the love
[22:07] of God that sent Jesus Christ to the
[22:10] Earth to die for us all God so loved the
[22:13] world he gave his only begotten son that
[22:15] whosoever believeth in him should not
[22:19] perish but would have everlasting
[22:23] life and the everlasting life here is
[22:27] God's own life because we become Sons
[22:30] and Daughters of God by the baptism of
[22:33] the Holy Spirit which is the Seed of
[22:36] Abraham and gives us the faith that
[22:39] Abraham had when he believed God before
[22:42] he was even
[22:43] circumcised
[22:45] now the next thing we believe that these
[22:51] worshippers should meet together these
[22:53] gifted people such as tongues and people
[22:56] who gets Revelations and
[22:58] interpretations and so forth these
[23:01] members or these Believers rather should
[23:05] come together at least 45 minutes or an
[23:10] hour before the services ever began the
[23:13] church should be open early and the
[23:16] Believers come together on these nights
[23:19] and at least 45 minutes to an hour
[23:23] before the services began I believe the
[23:25] brandom Tabernacle at all time should
[23:28] have a spirit filled
[23:31] pianist who would come early filled with
[23:35] the Holy Spirit and would play
[23:40] softly very
[23:42] softly Spiritual music such as down at
[23:46] the cross where the Savior died down
[23:49] there for cleansing from sin I cried
[23:52] there to my heart was the blood applied
[23:55] glory to his name something on that
[23:57] order near my God to thee Rock of Ages
[24:00] cleff or me or near The Cross or
[24:04] something on that order softly
[24:08] slowly as he is meditating constantly on
[24:11] the Holy Spirit he or she whichever it
[24:14] may
[24:15] be then I believe that the worshippers
[24:18] coming in should be met and their hanger
[24:23] coats and hats sh to their seats with h
[24:28] Hospitality that only ushers are deacons
[24:32] filled with the Holy Spirit can do and
[24:35] in love to see the Church of the Living
[24:37] God go
[24:38] on these worshippers should not talk one
[24:42] with another and be talking across and
[24:45] making noise in the church they should
[24:48] come together first slip up in silent
[24:51] prayer amen perhaps at the altar for a
[24:54] few moments no loud praying you
[24:57] interrupt someone else silent prayer
[25:00] you're in
[25:03] worship put that soak in worship Him in
[25:08] your
[25:09] spirit then return to your seat or you
[25:14] do not have to go to the altar just go
[25:17] in and get your seat sit down Listen To
[25:21] The Music close your eyes bow your head
[25:25] and be in silent wor worshiping God all
[25:31] along then if the spirit should reveal
[25:34] something to
[25:37] another or or someone be filled with the
[25:42] spirit to a place where they would speak
[25:44] with tongues then this person should
[25:47] rise and give the
[25:49] message and everyone must hold their
[25:52] peace until the interpretation comes
[25:56] when the interpretation comes
[25:58] it must not be just quoting of scripture
[26:02] or something that has no meaning it must
[26:04] be a message directed to the church or
[26:09] we think that it would be in the
[26:11] flesh we see so much of that and I I
[26:15] believe the the spirit was to speak only
[26:18] for the edifying of the
[26:21] church and now it would be a message
[26:24] something on this order Perhaps Perhaps
[26:26] the people are gathering by this time
[26:29] some sick people has come in perhaps
[26:31] there's a man laying paralyzed or
[26:33] something you've never seen him before
[26:36] but when the interpretation would come
[26:38] would be something in this order when
[26:40] the interpretation of the one who has
[26:41] just spoke would say uh well thus saith
[26:45] the Lord the man who is in our midst has
[26:48] come from a certain certain place and
[26:50] describe the place and would say that he
[26:53] is paralyzed because three or four years
[26:56] ago or whatever it may the case may be
[26:58] he did something evil like left his wife
[27:01] and children and run off from him and
[27:03] he's fell from a trussle or something
[27:05] like that order and got hurt and
[27:08] paralyzing thus saith the Lord if he
[27:10] will repent of that and will promise to
[27:12] go to his wife and reconcile himself to
[27:15] her then he shall be healed now and
[27:19] returned to his family and then before
[27:22] anyone says anything there must be at
[27:25] least two or more
[27:28] man are peoples in the building who are
[27:33] spiritually solid and gospel Doctrine
[27:37] who has a good discernment of spirit
[27:40] shall rise up and say that it is of the
[27:43] Lord and if this thing doesn't take
[27:46] place then tongues should not be
[27:49] mentioned in the church if the person
[27:51] speaks with tongues Paul said there be
[27:53] no interpreter and so forth let them
[27:56] speak at at home or wherever they may be
[27:59] for they're only blessing themselves and
[28:01] it's not for edification of the church
[28:04] then this person after speaking in the
[28:08] interpretation and then two or three
[28:10] judges according to St Paul's doctrine
[28:12] of the
[28:13] Bible that it must be judged by two or
[28:16] three judges then let the person whom it
[28:20] calls upon to go it maybe it might
[28:22] designate a certain person or the pastor
[28:25] or someone to go lay hands on this
[28:27] person and it it's sick or Afflicted and
[28:31] they will be healed then let the pastor
[28:34] or the other person whoever it may be it
[28:37] was designated by the Holy Spirit to go
[28:40] pray the prayer of faith let them go and
[28:44] minister to the person according to what
[28:46] the spirit has
[28:47] said then at that time the
[28:51] person and whatever the Holy Spirit has
[28:53] said it shall take place immediately
[28:56] then just as the Holy Spirit has given
[28:59] then the people could rejoice and be
[29:03] thankful and praise and worship God
[29:05] because God wants to be worshiped then
[29:07] they must then they must bow their heads
[29:09] and be in prayer again to see if there
[29:12] be another message that the holy spirit
[29:13] will want these gifts to manifest before
[29:17] and then if any time that a person would
[29:19] speak in tongues and interpret and the
[29:22] the judges would send the person to take
[29:25] to do whatever it was said to be done
[29:28] and it doesn't come to pass then the
[29:30] whole group of them shall go to the
[29:33] Altar and they pray God to take that
[29:36] spirit away from them because there's no
[29:39] one would want a spirit like that we
[29:41] would know it would be false and would
[29:43] be of the enemy and not of God because
[29:46] God can only tell
[29:49] truth let that be clearly understood by
[29:53] the church before you start this this
[29:56] new order
[29:58] then perhaps maybe it would be something
[30:01] like this the message would say to a
[30:02] certain brother maybe it say would live
[30:05] by a railroad track or something to have
[30:07] him to move out because there is going
[30:09] to be a wreck on the road or something
[30:12] or anything in that order and let the
[30:14] judges after they give the church
[30:16] permission to speak or to exercise this
[30:20] uh message that just went forth if their
[30:23] judgment is it's of God then watch and
[30:25] see if it comes to pass and if it comes
[30:28] to pass thank God and be very graceful
[30:32] graceful in your heart toring and give
[30:35] him praise and worship and be humble
[30:38] Above All
[30:41] Things be
[30:44] humble don't never get yourself puffed
[30:47] up to a place where you know more about
[30:49] it than your pastor or the church that
[30:52] you're worshiping in if you get to that
[30:54] place then I'd advise each one of you to
[30:57] get another place to worship with
[30:59] because I am asking the pastor never to
[31:03] permit anything outside of the Bible
[31:05] order a way we have seen it here in the
[31:09] church and then we want these gifts to
[31:12] be operated in place and the worshippers
[31:14] if it's carried on correctly according
[31:16] to the word you'll see a mighty
[31:19] wonderful church and operation for our
[31:21] Lord Jesus Christ now then the next
[31:25] thing shall take place
[31:27] will be that if these people who have
[31:32] that gets out of
[31:33] order uh during these times that a
[31:37] deacon or some uh Usher that's filled
[31:40] with the Holy Ghost and got lots of
[31:42] Grace in their heart shall go to the
[31:44] person reverently fatherly like and
[31:48] shall correct them in this manner are
[31:50] the pastor whoever it may be which would
[31:53] be more essential for the deacons to do
[31:55] so for the pastor at this time while
[31:58] these spiritual services are going on
[32:01] should be in the prayer room or
[32:02] somewhere a Praying these messages then
[32:07] if there's no messages going on no
[32:09] Revelations then the people would be
[32:11] privileged if they desired to raise and
[32:14] give a testimony a testimony only for
[32:18] the glory of God they're not bound to do
[32:20] this but testimony should be given
[32:23] before the message or any song service
[32:25] starts or anything testimonies in these
[32:28] worship services do you understand
[32:31] church that in doing this you have the
[32:34] whole church in the spirit of worship
[32:37] before the word comes in to be taught
[32:42] then the Holy Spirit gets in the word
[32:45] and manifests God through the word to be
[32:48] a confirmation of your worship
[32:52] now then after this uh time for the
[32:55] pastor to come on if messages are going
[32:59] on say the pastor should come out
[33:01] exactly say
[33:03] 7:30 and or quarter of eight and if
[33:06] these messages are still going on before
[33:08] the pastor comes to his out of his study
[33:11] or wherever he may to take his place at
[33:13] the platform some brothers should
[33:16] instruct him because the Saints knows
[33:18] that when the pastor comes on the
[33:21] platform it's his time then for the
[33:23] service and that gives plenty ample time
[33:27] for all the manifestations of the gifts
[33:30] to bring the spirit of God into the the
[33:34] congregation and if any unbeliever would
[33:36] happen to be there be disorderly a
[33:39] kindhearted person would go to them such
[33:42] as an usher or a deacon and would tell
[33:45] them if they would they would ask to be
[33:48] kept reverent or be reverent while the
[33:51] service is in order because the spirit
[33:54] is in the building and the gifts of of
[33:57] God are being made manifest for the
[34:00] edifying of the church and this person
[34:03] must be told in love and not harshly
[34:07] unless it would come to a place where
[34:09] they were drinking or some disobedient
[34:12] or something another that would be
[34:13] interfering with the worship of of the
[34:16] Lord uh which the gifts are then are
[34:19] being manifest then the person should
[34:23] would should be led out to one side to
[34:26] one of the back rooms or somewhere and
[34:28] be talked to and dealt with
[34:31] kindly
[34:35] now while the pastor comes to the
[34:38] platform as the pastor comes to the
[34:40] platform I would
[34:42] suggest as the brandom Tabernacle here
[34:46] that the pastor lead the
[34:49] congregation and at least one or
[34:53] two good
[34:55] songs
[34:57] for we have found it so that when too
[35:00] many are trying to operate the in the
[35:02] church it brings on only
[35:06] trouble I would suggest as I did while I
[35:09] was pastoring at the church I led the
[35:13] songs
[35:14] myself and I feel that it would be a
[35:17] good thing if the pastor did so himself
[35:20] and in all prayer meetings where they're
[35:23] gathered together groups of prayer
[35:26] meetings the pastor must be at each
[35:29] one it should never be left to any
[35:32] individual to go lead such meetings for
[35:36] we have found it so that they get off
[35:38] the track on Doctrine and then it call
[35:41] bring it right back into the church and
[35:43] many time bring heresies and so forth
[35:45] which doesn't belong in the Church of
[35:47] the Living God and the pastor should be
[35:50] at all prayer meetings and so forth
[35:53] where congreg Gatherings are and the
[35:57] pastors should never take sides in the
[36:00] meeting the saying that one group is
[36:02] this way and one that way the pastor
[36:04] should stand between both of them and go
[36:07] to them and get them reconciled
[36:10] immediately and if he can't get them
[36:12] reconcile let him take a deacon with him
[36:14] and then if the they W you neither
[36:17] Pastor nor Deacon then it should be told
[36:20] to the church and as Jesus said let them
[36:22] be unto you as a heathen and a Publican
[36:25] and whatever you buy on Earth said Jesus
[36:28] I'll bind in heaven and what you loose
[36:31] on Earth I will loose in
[36:34] heaven
[36:36] now when the pastor comes to the
[36:39] platform let the pastor then lead at
[36:43] least one or two songs and go straight
[36:46] to the word not no time for these long
[36:51] testimony meetings and everybody get up
[36:53] and a word to say that does not prosper
[36:56] in in the brandom Tabernacle if any peop
[36:59] who are listening to this tape and you
[37:02] it has prospered in your church well
[37:04] that's perfectly all right and we're
[37:07] very glad of that that it does prosper
[37:10] in your church but in our church it does
[37:13] not it only causes
[37:14] confusion I've been pastoring here for
[37:17] 20 some odd years and I have found that
[37:19] it only causes confusion if you've got a
[37:22] testimony give it before the in the
[37:24] congregation of the people while
[37:27] spiritual blessing and so forth are the
[37:29] real way to testify is not in the church
[37:32] is out in Dark Places let your light
[37:35] shine where it's dark go to Road houses
[37:38] and different places and where sin and
[37:40] thing is heaping then let your light
[37:42] shine there is the place to do it but
[37:44] however if the Lord has blessed you and
[37:46] give you some great special blessing or
[37:49] something that you have to tell the
[37:50] people do it in time of the other
[37:53] service the pre-service the preliminary
[37:56] or when the spirit is blessing and
[37:59] giving testimonies and Revelations and
[38:02] tongues and interpretations and so forth
[38:04] in the worship of the Saints before the
[38:07] word of God is being brought forth then
[38:10] the pastor after leading this him shall
[38:13] immediately lead the church in
[38:15] prayer and a congregational prayer
[38:18] himself as he stands at the platform
[38:21] asking the rest of them to Bow their
[38:23] heads in
[38:25] prayer this we have found to be a
[38:28] greater blessing and a more ruy and
[38:30] operating in the church and then the
[38:33] next thing the pastor should do then
[38:36] after if they had a real spiritual
[38:38] meeting with the gifts making manifest
[38:41] many secrets of the people's hearts and
[38:43] things which should be done by the gifts
[38:46] in the meeting then the spirit of God is
[38:48] in the meeting and it's very easy then
[38:51] for the pastor to find the spirit of God
[38:54] which is already in the meeting on the
[38:56] word of God as he reads and starts
[38:58] preaching the pastor then preach
[39:00] anything that the Holy Spirit would put
[39:03] on his heart whatever he wishes to do
[39:05] standing there but the congregation is
[39:09] the only they can rejoice as he is
[39:11] preaching of course or say Amen when the
[39:14] word comes forth but as far as getting
[39:16] up and giving uh uh messages and tongues
[39:19] and and interpretation while the Holy
[39:22] Spirit is working through the pastor the
[39:25] scripture condemns that and said the
[39:27] spirit of the prophets is subject to the
[39:29] prophet the pastor then must call this
[39:33] individual down and ask them to be
[39:36] reverent and to keep their place the
[39:38] pastor must be a man that has got a very
[39:44] humble way about him but not too humble
[39:48] for what he could be like the Lord Jesus
[39:49] Christ when he seen wrong going on in
[39:52] the church he platted ropes and ran them
[39:55] out of the church and now the Church of
[39:58] God is the house of judgment and the
[40:02] pastor is the highest order in the
[40:05] church the Elder is the highest thing in
[40:07] the apostolic church outside of the Holy
[40:10] Spirit the Holy Spirit brings his
[40:12] message straight to the Elder and the
[40:14] Elder gives it to the people the Saints
[40:17] in their gifts shall have their place
[40:19] first the worship and come together
[40:21] which brings as I have said before the
[40:24] spirit of the Lord in the building for
[40:26] the pastor and it makes it much easier
[40:29] for the Holy Spirit to work through him
[40:31] then when a good spiritual meeting has
[40:33] just proceeded his teaching and then the
[40:36] Holy Spirit gets into the word and
[40:38] teaches the word has just been
[40:40] manifested by the gifts and then the
[40:43] older call is being made then afterward
[40:46] and many then will see and know
[40:49] according to the working of the Holy
[40:51] Spirit and the word of God which a
[40:53] pastor places it on that you are the the
[40:56] Church of the Living God and if Paul
[40:59] said of all he'll fall down and say
[41:01] truly God is with you
[41:05] now in these things let it be done with
[41:09] reverence and now to the pastor to our
[41:14] brother Neville at this time remember he
[41:17] is the full head of the
[41:21] church brother
[41:23] nebble has a right
[41:27] to exercise any Authority that the Holy
[41:32] Spirit would anything the Holy Spirit
[41:35] would tell him to say in other words in
[41:38] the church he has a right to anything
[41:40] that God would lead him to do he also
[41:43] has a right over his Deacon board he can
[41:47] change the Deacon board the trustees or
[41:51] or pianist or any other office in the
[41:54] church that he desires to the change
[41:57] feeling led by the Holy
[41:59] Spirit uh to do so and whatever he does
[42:03] I'll recognize it as he I believe to be
[42:06] a godly man I'll recognize it to be of
[42:10] the Lord and will sanction the
[42:14] saint therefore it gives him the
[42:17] authority then to operate the church the
[42:19] way he feels led to do it
[42:23] now are any office in the church if he
[42:27] desires to to to uh switch uh positions
[42:32] with people well he has the authority to
[42:36] do that which I trust that this will
[42:39] always be lovely and never have to be
[42:43] you now may the Lord bless you all and I
[42:48] trust that this will
[42:50] be uh carried out to the very best of
[42:54] your knowledge and may the Holy Spirit
[42:58] watch over each one of you and may every
[43:02] officer of the church fill his post of
[43:06] Duty knowing this that God is going to
[43:09] hold you
[43:10] responsible for how you help your office
[43:14] in the
[43:15] church each one will have to give an
[43:18] account and to the leoty and the dear
[43:22] gifted Saints that's in our church those
[43:26] who who prophesy or speak with tongues
[43:29] or interpret or have
[43:32] Revelations we are just so happy to have
[43:36] you in the church and we will give you
[43:39] full
[43:40] cooperation in everything that the Holy
[43:43] Spirit shall prove that he has said to
[43:47] you and we love you and we believe that
[43:50] these gifts are in you and that if you
[43:53] have the right opportunity and the
[43:56] scripturally presentation of it that you
[43:59] will make great workers in our midst and
[44:05] may the Lord bless you all is my sincere
[44:12] prayer
[44:14] Christians since listening to this tape
[44:18] I have a one thing that I seen I left
[44:22] out and that is this that while people
[44:26] are speaking with tongues that must be
[44:29] in the courses of two or three according
[44:32] to the scriptures that is there's only
[44:35] two or three messages to be given in
[44:38] each single service after that according
[44:42] to the scriptures that these course this
[44:44] must be only two or three so may you
[44:48] carry these things out accordingly a way
[44:51] the Holy Spirit has directed it in his
[44:54] Bible and this is the the best in my
[44:56] knowledge the way to do it Paul said let
[44:59] them be by courses two or three when
[45:02] they're speaking the Lord bless
[45:06] you praise God let's hold
[45:10] stand I appreciate the message this

[50:07] 32
[50:13] amen praise the Lord let's just bow our
[50:16] heads heavenly father as we about to
[50:18] read your word this evening we pray
[50:19] would bless it and Inspire it our hearts
[50:22] in Jesus name
[50:24] amen
[50:26] verse 23 for I have received of the Lord
[50:31] that which also I delivered unto you
[50:34] that the Lord Jesus the same night in
[50:36] which he was betrayed took bread and
[50:40] when he had given thanks he broke it and
[50:42] said take eat this is my body which is
[50:46] broken for you this do in remembrance of
[50:51] me after the same manner also he took
[50:54] the cup when he had SED saying this cup
[50:58] is the New Testament in my blood this do
[51:01] ye as often as he drink it in
[51:04] remembrance of me for as often as he eat
[51:07] this bread and drink this cup ye do show
[51:11] the Lord's death till he
[51:13] comes wherefore whosoever shall eat this
[51:16] bread and drink this cup of the Lord
[51:19] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[51:22] and blood of the Lord but let a man
[51:25] examine himself and so let him eat of
[51:28] that bread and drink of that cup for he
[51:31] that eateth and drinketh unworthily
[51:33] eateth and drink a damnation to himself
[51:36] not Discerning the Lord's body for this
[51:39] cause many are weak and sickly among you
[51:42] and many sleep for if we would judge
[51:46] ourselves we should not be judged but
[51:49] when we are judged we are chastened of
[51:51] the Lord that we should not be condemned
[51:54] with the world let's just bow our heads
[51:56] and close our
[51:59] eyes praise God Heavenly Father Lord
[52:02] your people are gathered here this
[52:03] evening Lord to take part lord of the
[52:08] communion service father where we
[52:10] partake of the Bread and Wine father

[52:15] bless these articles that have been
[52:17] prepared Lord and as the Believers would
[52:20] partake Lord may you bring a rejoicing
[52:23] in the hearts of your people Lord bring
[52:25] forth a Revival father in the lives of
[52:28] the Believers Lord in this Tabernacle
[52:30] Lord Jesus Lord God and may you bless

[52:36] one another's feet with love and respect
[52:38] and humility Lord bless the pastor the
[52:41] officers Lord each and every member of
[52:43] this Tabernacle Lord fill and refill
