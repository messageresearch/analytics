[46:14] Genesis chapter 20
[46:17] maybe sure resolute Genesis chapter 22
[46:25] verses 16 and 17 I'm reading revelation
[46:29] 10 verses 1 to 6 and Hebrews 11 39 so I
[46:37] just want to start with Genesis chapter
[46:42] 22 verses 16 and 17
[46:57] and said by myself have I sworn saith
[47:01] the Lord for because thou has done this
[47:04] thing and hath not withheld thy son
[47:08] thine only son dharam blessing our
[47:12] blessed II Anna multiplying our multiply
[47:16] thy seed as the stars of the heaven and
[47:21] as the Sun which is upon the sea shore
[47:25] and I seed shall possess the gates of
[47:30] his enemies
[47:34] revelation 10 verses 1 to 6
[47:51] and I saw another mighty angel come down
[47:56] from heaven clothed that with a cloud
[47:59] and a rainbow was upon his head and his
[48:03] face was as it where the Sun and his
[48:06] feet as the pillars of fire we had in
[48:10] his hand a little book open and he said
[48:14] his right foot upon the sea and his left
[48:17] foot upon the earth cried with a loud
[48:20] voice as when a lion roars when he had
[48:24] cried seven thunders uttered their
[48:26] voices when the seven thunders had
[48:29] uttered their voices I was about to
[48:31] write and I had a voice from heaven
[48:34] saying unto me seal up those things with
[48:37] the seven thunders water right there not
[48:40] and the angel which I saw star upon the
[48:44] sea and upon the earth lifted up his
[48:46] hand to heaven and swear by him that
[48:53] liveth for ever and ever who created
[48:56] heaven and the things that therein are
[48:58] the earth and the things that therein
[49:01] are and the sea and the things which are
[49:04] therein that they should be time no
[49:07] longer finally Hebrews chapter 11 verse
[49:12] 39 and these all having obtained a good
[49:23] report through faith received not the
[49:29] promise god bless you may be seated
[49:32] praise the Lord

[49:41] swore by himself
[49:43] [Music]
[49:47] praise the Lord he swore by himself let
[49:52] me start by reading this quote from the
[49:54] key to the door brother Brahim said
[49:57] therefore I believe in the full gospel
[50:01] every word of God that turns the power
[50:05] of God loose that turns his blessing to
[50:10] the people is the key to the door that
[50:14] unlocks it oh those great heroes those
[50:21] prophets and great men of the Bible that
[50:26] had that key does the reason they could
[50:29] stop the mouths of lions quenched the
[50:34] violence of fire escaped the age of the
[50:39] soul bring the dead back to life again
[50:42] and do all kinds of miracles is because
[50:47] they held that key and they knowed it
[50:51] worked because it was a scripture born
[50:57] key and just like they knew it worked
[51:03] there are people in the land that know
[51:09] that the key works it unlocks heaven it
[51:19] brings everything that we are yearning
[51:22] for into manifestation
[51:24] so we're in a warfare and gods Heroes
[51:32] has always had warfare can you say Amen
[51:38] you couldn't be a hero this morning if
[51:42] you are not having warfare a hero is an
[51:49] achiever and for you to be an achiever
[51:53] you must have an absolute every great
[51:59] achievement
[52:00] has absolute behind it by talking about
[52:06] spiritual matter some have human
[52:13] absolutes some have Church absolute some
[52:20] have bishop absolute and they take these
[52:24] people as absolute regardless of what
[52:27] the Word of God says and you can't go
[52:32] too far because you couldn't have a
[52:35] human that is a failure and be a hero
[52:41] you couldn't have a human being that's a
[52:44] failure to start with as your absolute
[52:48] and be a hero heroes never die that
[52:58] cowards die 10,000 times before their
[53:02] death sometimes millions times before
[53:10] they really does been a hero never dies
[53:15] I know you're sitting here this morning
[53:20] you've gone through with all luck since
[53:23] I started this journey but every pointer
[53:30] points to one thing that is not all of
[53:36] us that will test of death that Omega
[53:43] bright hero shall not see this you and I
[53:51] may die before he comes and that's all
[53:56] right as long as you die a hero you did
[54:03] not give up halfway supports or no
[54:11] supports you stood alone because you
[54:16] have an unseen companion he goes with
[54:25] you all the time and somebody say Amen
[54:31] again problems Selig honor and I seed
[54:39] shall possess the gate of his enemy look
[54:42] all these precious heroes got a page
[54:48] full of them which I wrote down here
[54:52] they're all those precious hues the
[54:55] things that they did they finally died
[54:59] but then come the real faith seed the
[55:03] royal seed of Abraham Jesus promised
[55:09] Abraham had Isaac true after the flesh
[55:13] but the real seat wasn't in their
[55:16] organization system it was in that
[55:20] promise of God's Word
[55:22] that he would make him a father of
[55:25] Nations
[55:27] not through Isaac that through the royal
[55:31] seat Jesus that was the real seat which
[55:35] actually the seed of Abraham Jesus was
[55:38] not a Jew neither was he a Gentile he
[55:41] was God and a seed that God was talking
[55:48] about that shall possess the kids of the
[55:51] enemy is not the Jew is this seat here
[55:57] through Christ Himself that shall
[56:00] possess every gate of the enemy Christ
[56:08] has already possessed a gate of death so
[56:12] we are not afraid of death and go to a
[56:17] liberal ham because you've done this
[56:18] thing I am not honoring works I'm
[56:24] honoring faith this fit this type of
[56:28] faith we took without minding the
[56:32] outcome and I'll tell you what will be
[56:35] the outcome before you took it because
[56:37] of this thing you have done in blessing
[56:42] I will bless you and multiplying I will
[56:49] multiply you it wasn't enter and I see
[56:57] shop was less they kept so does not hit
[57:02] them kids of your enemies that's why
[57:07] we're not scared about what comes up or
[57:11] what goes down let me tell you one other
[57:15] thing you must take your position in the
[57:21] army of the Lord
[57:23] [Applause]
[57:25] Marissa tech met Abraham not before the
[57:31] fights after the victory we must
[57:39] complete this victory we can't come this
[57:43] far and turn around God blessing
[57:50] somebody when Abraham has taken his
[57:54] position and gone after a lot and
[58:00] captured back Lots he brought back
[58:03] everything that was taken hostage on his
[58:07] way back Melchizedek met him and saved
[58:13] him communion because the battle was
[58:17] over
[58:21] we're in a warfare we will only be met
[58:28] after we've taken our position and gone
[58:33] after our lost brothers and sisters
[58:36] bring them back save in the fall then
[58:41] Jesus will meet us after the battle
[58:48] there'll be thousands of table spread
[58:51] across for the victors and you'll be
[58:58] moving around shaking your hands wiping

[59:50] the entire history of the bible handed
[59:57] over to make a choice take the rapture
[1:00:00] and he swore by himself with that book
[1:00:10] he swore by himself
[1:00:12] he saw by him that liveth for ever and
[1:00:15] ever
[1:00:16] what can set and do this morning even if
[1:00:23] we are two or three set and cannot stop
[1:00:26] us slow all by himself we don't watch
[1:00:34] circumstances because calop had the
[1:00:41] promise of God as his absolute these are
[1:00:48] at 10 have circumstances as their
[1:00:51] absolute and if you watch Hebrews 11
[1:00:57] where those heroes are listed none of
[1:00:59] them is there Abraham Moses calop them
[1:01:06] whether Joshua them whether David them
[1:01:10] whether those who turn to flight the
[1:01:13] armies of the aliens they were all there
[1:01:16] because they had the real absolute and
[1:01:21] unfailing absolute God's Word never
[1:01:26] fails when they came back from the land
[1:01:30] with the report of the land and all they
[1:01:34] had to tell was how while the land was
[1:01:37] the challenges I tell me they not try to
[1:01:41] go and collapse to the be immediately a
[1:01:44] wash looking at the promise of God not
[1:01:54] circumstances is there we are more
[1:01:58] able to take that man you say we look
[1:02:05] like grasshoppers by the sides of them
[1:02:07] circumstances but somebody was looking
[1:02:11] at a promise seven thunders give faith
[1:02:15] shall Canada prior together it will give
[1:02:19] a rapture in faith wait till the seven
[1:02:23] thunders uttered their voices to that
[1:02:25] group
[1:02:26] that's a promise they were looking at it
[1:02:31] Amen this God we are talking about the
[1:02:38] Lord Jesus Christ he was in the Alpha
[1:02:41] and he was he will be in the Omega
[1:02:45] there's nothing said about in-between so
[1:02:50] just like the early church mounted they
[1:02:56] flew over every child in the world that
[1:03:01] same God is now in the Omega to do the
[1:03:07] same things that he did
[1:03:10] powerful church that's what is coming

[1:03:34] that don't make a fellow feel like
[1:03:36] hollering hallelujah that's not.you
[1:03:39] addicts for God to swear by himself

[1:03:55] no matter what happens there will be
[1:03:59] rapture they'll be a church that nothing
[1:04:05] can defeat our God said Abraham because
[1:04:11] you did this not what somebody else will
[1:04:15] do you're not sitting here today because
[1:04:19] of what somebody else is doing is what
[1:04:23] you have done

[1:04:27] Abraham bundled his own son it took him
[1:04:31] years before I had this son and when he
[1:04:35] had that son and as soon as grown to

[1:05:39] that final moment he didn't want to take
[1:05:42] it for granted that Abraham loved him he
[1:05:46] wanted to see to the end so when he knew

[1:06:23] for granted he will prove two of us to
[1:06:30] test us to that final moment before the
[1:06:34] promise will come so I said Abraham
