with that restoration anointing to bring us back into the place where we supposed to be help us tonight Lord in this word that we believe that you have for us tonight and may it Minister and entrance that we can enter into the spirit of prayer and supplication calling upon thee granted God in Jesus name I ask it amen and amen praise the Lord hallelujah so God bless you and we are grateful to God for all things and I pray that God would be with you in a special way amen so I trust them that uh just one second praise the Lord yes so tonight I want to read a scripture from St John 15 Luke 5:116 and St John 15 we want to read two scriptures tonight Luke 5:116 one verse there and it says speaking about Jesus and he withdrew himself into the Wilderness and prayed I repeat and he withdrew himself into the Wilderness and prayed in John 15 15 Read from verse one I am the True Vine and my father is a husband man have a branch in me that beareth not fruit he take it away and every branch that bear fruit he pth it that it may bring forth more fruit now you are clean through the word which have spoken unto you abide in me and I in you as the branch can bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can ye except you abide in me I am the vine you are the branches he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me you can do nothing if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and a withered and Men gather them and cast them into the fire and they be burned if he abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what he will and it shall be done unto you here is my father glorified that you bear much fruit so shall you be my disciples may God bless his word and I pray that this word tonight will be a blessing to you brother BR if Jesus was slain before the foundation of the world it taken four years before it actually happen but when God spoke it back here every word of God is steadfast it's immutable it cannot fail and when God slay a son before the foundation of the world he was just as much slain then as he was at Calvary it's a finished product When God says so but remember when the lamb was slain your salvation was included in the sacrifice because the Bible says that your name was written on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of of the world what about that that then what are we going to do it is God that showeth Mercy it is God that called you note he's not talking about your faults your fears your failures your family background he's talking about God it is God that showeth Mercy it is God that called you it's God that chose you in Christ before the foundation of the world Jesus said you never chose me I chose you and I knew you before the foundation of the world there you are so see that takes the scare out of you so he said this revelation will take the scare out of you let's continue Hebrews 6 reading from verse 13 Paul speaks for when God made promise to Abraham because he could swear by no greater he swear by himself saying surely blessing I Will Bless thee and multiplying I will multiply the and so after he had listen patiently endured he obtained the promise for men verely swear by the greater and oath for confirmation is to them an end of all Strife wherein God willing more abundantly to show unto the ears of Promise the immutability of his counsel confirm it by an oath this is the bom here that by two immutable things in which it was impossible for God to lie we might have a strong consolation who have fled for Refuge to lay a hold upon the Hope set before us which hope we have as an anchor of the Soul both sure and steadfast which enter it into within the veil so there two things when God speaks his word it is good as done so we have the confidence tonight that God can't lie he will keep his word to you and I now let's continue here now today we see the same holy spirit that was Upon Jesus working in the church confirming everything that God said what a marvelous hope it builds up in us to think that we are his children and blessed of his presence and now he is here with us as in infallible proofs and brother read the scripture we read about that the immutable thing which is impossible to go to line he said what a marvelous promise two immutable things God can't like and be gone if God has made a promise in his Bible here we believe the Bible to be the infallible word of God and if God has made a promise in this Bible we have the consolation to know it is impossible for God to lie therefore when we see he promis it in the Bible We Believe It soul body and spirit because it is impossible for him to lie now if there's any fault it's not is in us not in God for God is obl ated to his word so just think just think for a moment whenever God speaks he established his law which is his word and he himself can't break it if he is quiet if nothing's been said nothing being spoken he's just there as Elohim with his thoughts but once his thoughts become expressed it's infallible so but was saying here it is impossible an impossibility is practically the same word as can't change it has to stay the same it is two immutable things we have two things first is his word said he would do it then second is sworn oath what type of people should we be why should we be tossed about and run about and taken the things of the world praise God listen to this part now he said we want to be the oldfashioned type that would take God at his word and call those things which were not as though they were if God said so that settles it now here it is healing of the body doesn't become a fiction it becomes a reality the baptism of the Holy Spirit doesn't become an emotional workup substance it becomes a reality of the indwelling presence of the Lord Jesus Christ to change the life now I ask some questions here that I wrote down here does prayer affect God that's prayer influence God that's prayer move God why do we have to pray why would Jesus pray all night why would Jesus pull himself aside in the wilderness in a desert place to pray and I have here when God speaks his word it becomes his law a law that that cannot change he himself limits himself to his own word and that is why the word is God he cannot break his own word he cannot violate what he has established he is not a man that would lie you can trust you can rest you can stand on his word and he will not fail you brother Gideon spoke on Wednesday night and the power of one and what a powerful inspiration Revelation the power of one and it brought me to my mind as a young Christian when I found this quote about your majority in God I remember praying I said Lord I'm a majority that was that was quite something it felt special to me it felt that I didn't need a whole bunch of people around me to be a Christian and to stand I as an individual am a majority in God and brother B said this I say this with all my heart as a Christian minister tonight if every soul that's in the United States would turn to God with all their heart with all their soul and believe him I will say that the cancer are trouble everything in America the problems would be settled right there that's right but when you have got so much mixup just think what a little teen1 40 at 1% of 100 would be the people who really believe in Divine Healing just just think of the battle you have to you got in the opposition and people think it's fake you got people who think it's some crazy something and all these other things you got to come back with so you see we are on the small side as far as the eyes is concerned or mental conception here we go but in the eyes of God we are in the majority because one is the majority with God so just think tonight your one prayer don't see us p and SMY and have no effect no you tonight a majority in God so B was talking about Abraham right and Abraham got strength and he's talking about uh sking down his Spirit into the church and give the church a baptism holy ghost that brings strength into the church Martin Luther John Wesley the Pentecostal move that's being you see and watch God cannot defile his own laws he has to keep his own law so God cannot disobey his own laws he cannot anull his own law and then in order to be God so we see God coming down to become a man to die God could not die as a spirit because he would not die he could not die he's Eternal he could not die but God could not could make himself in such a way that he could feel pain he could feel and suffer God could not suffer as the eternal spirit but when he became man he could suffer feel the pain and The Temptations that man went through like Adam Eve in the garden everyone else since so he had to become that in order to fulfill his own law to take upon himself his own law so I want you to understand where prayer fits into this whole order of God God is God he's omnipotent he's all powerful he could intervene he could do whatever he want to do but he put a law in prayer to work something to accomplish something that it cannot be accomplished outside of prayer 1 Thessalonians 5:17 said pray without ceasing through prayer through prayer God can bring a revelation of his will for our lives and that Jesus pray thy will be done on Earth as it is heaven we don't know God's will automatically we wasn't born with a with a revelation of the will we had to seek that prayer invites God to intervene in Earthly Affairs Philippians 4:6 the scripture we have read several times be careful for nothing but but in everything not something in everything in Natural Things home things economic things Financial things emotional things grocery things work things in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving so prayer pray supplication pleading begging asking with Thanksgiving don't just do like if go to Santa Claus with Thanksgiving you got to be grateful you got to be thankful you got to be appreciative of where you are what God has blessed you with and you're making your request known let your request be known un God I'll read the whole scripture again be careful for nothing this is Philippians 4:6 but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your request be known unto God that's an order prayer brings help in a time of need Hebrews 4:16 Bible say let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find Grace to help in time of need he Amplified for that say let us then fearlessly and confidently and boldly draw near to the throne of grace the Throne of God's UNM merited favor to us sinners that we may receive Mercy for our failures and find Grace to help in good time for every need appropriate help and well time help coming just when we need it so God placed prayer as a means to access his presence and power God put prayer as a means of fellowship with him so God wants his people to pray familiar quote and when Israel got so taxed in such a condition that they got no further their time was fulfilled and their burdens lay further than they thought then they begin to pray and when they begin to pray God begin to hear it was time for God's word to be fulfilled so AMR and Joseph saw that it was time for the word to fulfilled they went to pray to God let me read it again when AMR and Jose saw that it was time for the word to be fulfilled they went to prayer to God you know when I came in this message 1975 next going be 50 years from me and I saw certain prophecy that was prophesied at that time as a 17 18 year old boy I found some of those things almost so out uh outlandish to believe that this will come to pass here it is we are in 2024 and a woman standing as going up to be president of America of a vision that P prophesied since 1933 here we are so seeing the Visions coming to pass seven Visions which you say must come to pass before Jesus comes again and we are closing in on that last Vision if you could see it that way when are we going to begin to pray because we can't change what is to happen we can't change that all that dwell on the earth we cannot change the Los Angeles going to sink and the earthquakes and the hurricanes and all the disasters that is lined up and pile up the bums to fall we cannot change those things but we can get line up with this word so when amam and yuset saw that it was time for the world to be fulfilled they went to prayer to God and it is usually here we go those who pray is the one who got the burden the one who gets something it is those who pray that's ordain of God to do so you cannot measure Yourself by another church member that could be just that a church member if you are part of this bride body you have to line up in the word one is a majority in God James 5:16 almost done James 5:16 confess your fors one to another and pray one for another that you may be healed the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man of you that much your prayer tonight is not in vain this this in the Amplified confess your faults confess to one another Therefore your faults your slips your false steps your offenses your sins and pray also for one another that you may be healed and restored to a spiritual tone of mind and heart the earnest there we go heartfelt continued prayer of a righteous man makes tremendous power available dynamic in his working and then I close let me share this here Jesus understood the placing of the branches in God's economy and that is why Jesus said I am Divine he understood his place as Divine he knew that through the branches fruit will come forth according to God's original intent for man because God placed man to have you often hear about Isaac said jurisdiction of this Earth we wouldn't we wouldn't give jurisdiction in heaven we were given jurisdiction in Earth so the laws of the earth is what God subject himself to which is that the kinsman redeemer and become man and a Kinsman the laws of the earth so the laws of the Earth requires that true here we go the branch on the earth produces the fruit and Jesus is saying my father he's a man that's trim and cut he's the husband man I am the vine you are the branch you have to connect to me to bring fruit and without me you are nothing and if you don't want to connect to me you will be dealt with you'll be burnt all right so without me you can't do anything prayer makes us Vine dependent submissive to his word and will and I have this written here prayer affects and changes the one who prays so friends I want to challenge you tonight to talk to the Lord to see yourself as being a majority in God to you're not looking for the whole church to be behind you you are a majority in God you have access to him if you fail him and you fall short you have access to repentance and submission to him submitting to his will because you we have to see the fruit of God In Our Lives why would Jus say if you aband in me and I would aband in you you shall ask what you will now if we take it from the standpoint God knows all things he he knows I don't have to ask him because he know what I have need of no he said ask it shall be given he said seek he shall find he said knock and the door shall be open asking seeking knocking it shows you dependent it come like a little child and you promise the child something you bring sweet or sweets or or biscuit or cake and the child is so excited when you come home in the evening that child is expectant that child is happy that child is looking for what you have promised and this is what God expect from us he promised the Holy Ghost he promised Revival he promised breakthrough and deliverance there are some people who would Loaf and we just hanging there doing nothing they're waiting for the for the for the for the whole uh Chariot to get moving and then jump on they are they are putting no effort no labor no no but Jesus pull himself aside have you pulled yourself aside when are you going to pull yourself aside we caught up and and this is the age of of faith Facebook and WhatsApp and everything to to to take our attention but yet Jesus found time to pull himself aside to pray let us bow our heads heavenly father I thank you tonight it was quite something to bring this tonight and share with your people that your word can change and we're going to learn of your nature we're going to learn of your being and of your person Lord the people have been religious for a long time and Lord it says that that seven seal we're going to know your nature your being your person all about you and we be worshiping the living Christ to understand who you are you're not a male you're not a king you're not a general you're not a a man that would lie you you are Spirit you are the word you have laws that cannot be broken and changed and that is why when you told Adam and the day you eat there of that day you shall surely die you couldn't break that word because is Adam that word had to stand and I think our people us we have to catch that whatever you say it will stand it has you are no respector of PRS you subject yourself to your own word your own law help us tonight you said If my people that is called by my name shall humble themselves and turn from their Wicked Ways then they're going to hear from heaven and going to he you said these things if you shall you shall find me if you seek me with your whole heart oh Jesus come tonight come in the homes Lord come in the lives of your people come as they pray in all sincerity they're not praying for others to hear they're not praying just to make noise and just just just making a lot of words to you they praying because there's something still in their hearts there's something stood in their spirits and they want to be closer drawn to you they want more of you they want to be more like you oh God want you come tonight come in Simplicity father come into the closet Lord this I believe and I thank you for this medium
