before the minister come out to minister to you this morning I'm uh brother Anthony going be speaking with to you this morning I some point my heart I like to share with you and if you have your Bibles could you do have to stand is from joshu chap 1:8 just quickly a few things I just fell to my heart to bring before he comes on God speaking to Joshua this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth note Moses was the anointed Prophet deliverer to bring the people out of Egypt he was called by God to do that but he was not the man to take them over into the land of promise note it wasn't a guaranteed thing so when God make a promise you have to see how it will unfold Moses could only take them so far and no more Moses is dead God anointed Joshua to take them across because God can't lie by this time thousands and thousands of thousands of so-called Believers had died these are the parents of the generation next to go into this land are you with me but even though Joshua is Anointed to take them into this land there are some conditions that God is assigning to him and one of this is in Joshua 1:8 this book of the Lord shall not depart out of thy mouth you have to be speaking it you have to be expressing it you have to be saying it watch this part now but thou sh meditate during day and night you can't speak what you don't know you can't speak what you have not read you can't speak what you have not learned so you have to learn it you have to hear it you have to receive it you have to embrace it then it'll be upon your mouth because from the abundance of the heart say it the mouth speak it if you don't have it in your heart nothing coming through your mouth if you have foolishness in your heart that's what God come out your mouth but if you have the word in your heart that's what going to come out of your mouth he said this book of the Lord shall not depart from thy mouth before it hit your mouth you have to hit your heart before it hit your heart you have to hit your mind so you have to meditate on it day and night oh glory to God Hal Hallelujah do you understand that there are layers and layers of the contract that God give with men oh give the Lord some Praises when you go to a job you have to apply for the job you have to go to an interview you have to pass other people who lining up with you to be interviewed when you get qualified to get the job now they have to give you instructions and if you have to get promotion they have to get what you call an assessment they just slam me up the ladder because you say so and you feel so no you have to be qualified and assessed and everything else and if the tick is against you you will not get the promotion you have to get it right well same thing in God's program if God have a program you have to come through the assessment amen if you can't come to pass standard one standard two standard three you may have to go back to standard one you have to pass every grade oh give the Lord I shout in the house the test is coming whether you're ready or not the examination is coming oh give the Lord a do you really believe what God said do you know that God can't lie do you know that God will keep his word do you know God will confirm his word do you believe that with all your heart tonight oh give the Lord some Praises let me go quickly you know watch thou shall meditate during day and night here here this here this that thou may US observe to do according to all that written therein how could you please God when you don't know what God Said how could you please God when you don't know what pleases God don't have a god of your own imagination God is the word just what he said he he will keep you know yes sir all right watch observe to do according to all written therein for then thou shall make thy way prosperous then thou shall have good success good success and prosperous by doing what meditating on the word day and night not day only not Sunday only day but day and night all right quickly Joshua 1 um Psalms 1 familiar one 1 to3 blessed is a man that walth not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of Sinners nor sth in the seat of the scornful you should no the sign by heart this you should be able to Rattle It Off by heart if you can't R this off we should must ask people St and say Psalms one I say shake I say say one blessed is the man that walth not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of Sinners nor sit in the seat of the scornful but is the light is in mind other of your business is his light in going to different house to house here what going on is the light is in the law of the Lord and in his law that he meditate when day only day only day and night he shall be the first thing in your day and the last thing in your night oh give the Lord some Praises do you get what I'm saying this morning he shall be the first man you're talking to in the day and the last person you're hearing you're talking to you're fellowshipping with the night oh give the Lord some Praises his Delight is in the law of the Lord and it his Lord of meditate day and night he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of waters that bringeth forth his fruit in his season his leav shall not wither and whatsoever you do it shall prosper Give the Lord a praise Give the Lord a shout almost done hallelujah praise God praise God praise God hallelu hallelujah hallelujah and this is another Psalm from David he said oh God Thou Art my God early will I seek thee if you don't know God to be sought early he said early will I seek thee what what my soul thirsted for thee my flesh longth for thee in a dry and thirsty land where no water is for what to see thy power and thy Glory so I have seen in the sanctuary because thy loving kindness is better than life my lip shall praise thee thus will I bless thee while I live I will lift up my hands in thy name Oh Glory to God my soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness my mouth shall praise thee with a joyful lips not with a sad face with joyful lips you can't wait ah Glory you know when you're getting down in the park or the St cake or the chicken and you you're licking your lips that's how you supposed to be in praising and worshiping your God praise God not a fight to praise not a fight to worship not a fight to give him glory my soul shall be satisfied with marrow and fatness and my mouth shall praise the with joyful lips there is when I remember thee upon my bed and meditate on the in the night watches early in the morning and in the night watches get the Lord I shout in the house you shall meditate on the word day and night the last thing in watching T night shouldn't be a movie have am out of here I will say it again in case you didn't hear it the last thing you're watching at night shouldn't be a movie the last thing you should be hearing is not from Hollywood oh give the Lord a shout you should be hearing from Heaven you should be hearing from the word David said when I remember thee upon my bed and meditate on the in the night watches oh give the Lord a shout oh he hided my soul in the Cliff of the rock almost done you will be seated all right going good question how can a Christian get deeper in the love of God because the devil would lick up your surface life you know somebody say can't be a part Christian with a full-time devil do you hear that you don't want to be a part-time devil fighting a part time part time Christian fighting a fulltime devil you know because he he did whole time watching you you know watching every move out to trap you how to trick you how to influence you how to send demons upon you to into your life he's all days working you know and you just barely morning Lord evening where is that question how can a Christian get deep in the love of God that don't need a five minutes answer or 10 minutes answer two lines that have here read the word and pray read the word and pray that's all I want to add one part of that do it every day remember I school as children listen that song um and you read the Bible and and pray every day and you're going to grow grow grow and you will grow grow grow some people are stunted so because they don't [Music] read I can flip the song the other way because you don't read the Bible and pray every day but Brandon we are Brethren there's no denomination can separate the love of God we are Brethren this will only men know that you're my disciples when you have love one for another you say what are you all learn about them then love is corrective if love doesn't correct then it's not love if you love your children you will tell them the truth you wouldn't hide their sins you will tell the truth because you want them delivered you wouldn't tell them don't tell the ministry you would want them to tell the ministry because you want them to get the help that you cannot give them oh give the Lord some Praises do you get that is a demon will say don't tell the ministry I don't want the ministry to know there's a devil behind there saying that I mean every word I said [Applause] there love is corrective real love love is corrective then it's not love you see your child down on the street and they give them a little posterior protoplasm stimulation which is a ping or put some licks on them or cut the tail as we would say Here let him know he's got to get out the street or perish that is genuine love Junior there I don't know you maybe you shouldn't be out there at this time of the day and the end day when the cars are going pretty fast he said nonsense you cified preacher not the audacity to take God's word and call white white black black right right wrong wrong all right let's go if you make a mistake some woman make a mistake some man made a mistake some boy or girl made a mistake don't sink scream out in dispar Lord save me or I'll perish get desperate about it God will hear you you hear that don't let the devil tell you God will not hear you you know the devil is a liar he said God will hear you he always hear a desperate sh Soul oh give the Lord Us Praise he always not sometimes always he a desperate soul and when you get desperate you don't care who see you you don't care if you to crawl on the ground you don't care if they beat up on the Altar and your nose running on with snack and all kind of Tears around your eye and your way going one way and whatever going with doesn't matter you are desperate oh give the Lord some praises who want to look down at you that is the business you are desperate because you want an answer from God you want to hear from God God will answer your prayer praise God you may be seated desperation you talking about when the wife was about to die with cancer he know that God could heal her and if God could heal the wife God could heal the boy and it chose it in the state of desperation you must come and when you are Des Spirit then God is going to listen to you but if you're just full you don't care whether he does or not well that's different you say you do but it takes desperation to it why I believe that the reason that we don't have desperation is because there's a lack of Love lack of love God the the love of God I think the love of God causes desperation because the love of God brings out brings upon you God's burden these prophets had a burden you know the burden of the Lord to Nehemiah the burden of God the burden you got crowd against sin if you do have the burden to hate sin and hate unrighteousness hiding your brother sin and your sister sin is not righteousness you know you you sending them to hell because if God bnks them if they get hit with a can go and what not they go to hell you know a nice believer in church you know in sin go to hell have a place called hell you know remember this is not the only debt then have a second debt you know remember we striving to meet Glory you know we striving to meet God you know we don't know if we'll wake up in the morning you know we don't know that we wake up and just go to work and what nothing we don't know he holds your life he holds your heart he holds your he he holds your future you are in his [Applause] hands so watch the plans watch the plans see if it's God's will if it's God's plan if it's God's P I think the love of God causes desperation if God is in you the to inside of you and you see the conditions of times and people waiting in sin the way they are it will throw you into desperation that's the thing when you get desperate go to praying almost done here now perfect is perfect coming here about 11 3 minutes 11 it's good you can't be desperate till God speaks to you amen so you want to get God's voice what the devil does now Drive the church kill the anointing there's no Spirit atmosphere you only here intellectual sitting down there d a biscuit no change I told you the same God had G them laws to kill lambs and Rams and bring goats and afterwards the people get so slack they tell the neighbor off around for me off no heart in it they come and come in the church and your heart in church you prefer go beat pan or go Carnival or wear some kind of clothes or go fet or something so but somebody drag inside the church and they come and drag in God don't want that God don't want he I hate your Feast I hate your new moon I hate your offering I hate all of that I can't stand it because these people draw nigh unto me with the mouth but the heart is far from me that's why I have to love God with all your heart your mind your soul and ask God to rip out of you anything that would hinder that love to flow you beated a wife could serve a husband without love she could put to drop the plate on the table and drop the bread or whatever it is and and and she angry and she hateful and miserable and corrupt no love at all but she doing her Duty washing clothes ironing whatever it is she doing she duty but no love you think God want a bride like that you think you want a wife like that God reject that he said get back to your first love you could work I know you could do this I know you could do that and you could do that but where is the love for me to praise me to love me to meditate on me to worship me to honor Me Oh Glory to God to sing unto the Lord with songs hey glory to God hallelujah if you were singing them songs and worshiping marting God the carnival music wouldn't drift your soul or give the Lord a shout in the house because you'll be caught up in what God have you to be in let be seated Hallelujah you can't be desperate till God speaks to you oh Church rise and Shake Yourself pinch your conscience wake up for this hour we must be desperate to perish there's coming forth something from the Lord I know it as th sayth the Lord there's coming forth something we beg a desperate it's between life and death it will pass through us if we won't and we won't see it he also said if love doesn't get you desperate conditions as well and them conditions is about to come Prophet said the bride will be hunted persecuted group yes sure if your money in the bank will be money in the bank because you can't buy and sell until you take the mark of the beast you a sure what you have you already have because everything coming into digital and everything come to this and that and everything else you're not sure but this gospel is sure and the word of the prophecy is sure could we stand give me that same song you were singing just out there praise God be magnified

ready to come out it was so good to feel his presence and we know you brought your Praises this morning amen amen so good to be here oh all things ready well let's just turn our Bibles now thank you so much amen and uh for a scripture reading I have two portions of scriptures uh one we want to read uh purposefully before the other which is revelation 3 we want to read from verse 14 to 19 and also we want to read from 2 Peter 1 and 8 to9 amen so God bless you amen and um as we read amen so Revelation 3 and reading from verse 14 it says and unto the angel of the Church of the leodan write these things sayth the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God I Know Thy works for thou art neither cold or nor hot I would that thou W cold or hot so then because Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee from out of my mouth because thou sayest I am rich and increased in goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white rment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thy eyes with isself that thou mayest see as many as I love I rebuke and chasen be zealous therefore and repent and we're reading now from second Peter 1 amen so you'll have to go back to that in the in your Bibles but uh just want to read from 2 Peter 1:8-9 we know very familiar with 4-7 talking about those seven uh things to be added but uh in verse 8 he says something we want to bring for a context here from what we just read so from verse 8 it says for if these things be in you and abound they make you that you shall neither be Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but he that lacketh these these things is blind and cannot see a far off and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins may God add a blessing to the reading of his word let's bow our heads now as we want to pray once more amen almighty God we stand here Lord father upon this spot of ground Lord father giving you praise for your goodness and mercy Lord that has brought us through and now as we approach your word Lord Lord we know that only you can bring understanding to these things that are written Lord in your in your precious word father we look to you tonight Lord our eyes are upon you father may you be magnified this morning in your word and Lord as we uh uh get into these scriptures father and for a few moments we want to talk about you Lord may your presence come down in a special way Lord and visit us with your own sweet presence Lord father speak to us whatever you want to say Lord father I am your servant oh God and I bow before your Mighty will oh god father whatever you have to speak Lord you speak it today Lord you know the things that you put upon my heart but Lord you stare the wheel this morning and move in whatever Direction you want to father and Lord that's what we'll do Lord we surrender now to your Mighty will oh god father have your way bless your people I pray Lord and Lord just you take contr father we surrender to you now this service in jesus' name amen and amen may God have blessing to ring of his word and his prayer may you seated uh Amen Let me just take my jacket off hallelujah praise God Amen so we here by faith amen we thank God for his presence so I have a title um this morning for a few moments my title is that thou mayest see taken right out of Revelation 3 which we just read that thou mayest see amen that's my title this morning and um this thought kind of struck me actually late last year and um it really struck me at a slightly different angle from the scriptures we read and I was uh delving in the scripture with Joseph uh and his story in the Bible and I was looking at something that kind of stood out at me and I guess that's kind of what led me to this thought and the thought that stood out to me was Joseph's life um we know that he was given a dream early on in his life as a Young Man and God showed him certain things that was to happen but God never told him how it was going to unfold he just showed him the end part of the story almost so it's almost like he got a heads up about how this thing was going to end up but what he didn't know was the road that he would have to travel to get to the vision that God had for him Hallelujah isn't that right he didn't know his brothers were going to betray him he didn't know he was going to beg for his life he didn't know they was going to sell him for some pieces of silver he didn't know he was going to have to take the long road to Egypt he didn't know he was going to be forsaken didn't know he was going to be abandoned none of that made sense in the mind of Joseph but in the mind of God it makes perfect sense because he was going to bring him to the vision that he showed him at the beginning he didn't know he's going to be sold as a slave didn't know he'd be working in poyer's house he didn't know he'd be working there and he didn't know he'd be betrayed by Piper's wife he didn't know he'd end up in prison he didn't know about the baker he didn't know about the butler none of that made sense but in God's mind it made perfect sense he couldn't see how all of this was going to amount to anything but in God's mind this is the Road God had for Joseph because where God wanted Joseph was in a position of power and in order to bring him into Power he had to be stripped he had to be uh beaten he had to be persecuted he had to be hated Without a Cause he had to be ridiculed he had to be abandoned he had to be left alone in a prison to grow up out a long pad and to rot away in a jail cell he had to come to terms with the word of God concerning his own life oh he didn't know Hallelujah can I get some more in the monitors please amen praise God hallelujah he didn't know he'd have to go through all that but the wonderful part about the story is that when he finally come out of prison because God calls a dream upon Pharaoh you know the story now the hour had come God is getting ready to change the season and he announced the season with a dream isn't that right to the highest Authority and start to shake things up in the Kingdom all of a sudden it have a a um a price on the head for all those witches and those who say they no dreams come and bring the interpretation all of a sudden they have a price on their head now things start to shake up people frighten new laws passing oh the whole Kingdom Under disturbance because of a dream oh hallel because of a dream because of a dream and it just so happened that God have a man there in the prison who has the answer who has the key to unlock this situation oh that God himself has orchestrated oh God at a man waiting for this very moment oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Oh Glory oh Hallelujah Joseph come into power seven years of plenty Joseph still in power things going nice it look like he get the biggest promotion ever cuz he's second to none other than Pharaoh himself isn't that right he has the power over the greenery and so forth and he's seeing about things making sure that things are being put aside for the famine that they expected to come 7 years after that isn't that right and they're going through this process and Joseph himself is going through this process now think of it now he come from prison to power he's in power seven years he in power and things are I mean things are great you know he has all that he could ever need anything he need he call it from Pharaoh you just write a check for he get it but only when his brother showed up it's only when the famine set in and it's only when the grain was being distributed out to different nations that's when his brother showed up and said me and my brethren are here and we we come from a land far away and there's a famine and we need help all of a sudden it made sense now it it it it begin to make sense the picture finally begin to come together all the time it looked like confusion all the time it looked like chaos all the time it look like he in jail here he in trouble here he tried to do good but evil is present praise God he coming through coming through he don't understand but right in this moment when his brothers stood before him oh here it was here was a thing God had brought him through all this miles for oh hallelujah hallelujah oh glory glory glory glory glory god never told Jose he had to forgive his brothers that never came as an instruction Joseph you have to forgive them but when Joseph looked down the long road and he saw what they did to him and he saw what God allowed them to do forgiveness became the fruit of what he saw unfolded before his eyes oh Hallelujah it made sense now he said God send me ahead to preserve life for you oh hallelujah oh glory to God Amen and I tell you brother I tell you sister what you're going through now may not make sense nothing might make sense nothing adding up but I tell you there's a great Destiny for you this morning if thou can't believe all things are possible God's going to bring you out God's going to work it out only that to may see oh hallelujah hallah oh glory to God Amen he put you to the Long Road oh Hallelujah went around a long way to prove you and to try you you saw Darkness you saw dread you saw trials you saw testings but I was only to prove that The Thirst that God put in your soul could not be removed could not perish could not come out God put that there and if God put a thir in you for the Holy Ghost then you shall be filled with the Holy Ghost and Fire there's not enough Devils that can stop it this morning the devil is a liar you shall be failed somebody say amen hallelujah sh Give the Lord a shout of praise hallelujah hallelujah praise [Applause] [Music] God oh my do you see a church so I believe God passes us through things just so that we could see something because if you remain in your four walls of your perception of reality if you remain in your four walls you know your four walls very wellu you wake up every morning and they go to sleep in the same four walls if you don't change those pictures you know and God knows that you'll never get anywhere so sometime God have to cause things to happen to you to change your picture cuz I but over say if you could change your pictures you change your world and sometimes what we see changes who we are so God had to allow us to see something present a picture for you that changes your understanding of Your World bring you on a higher level isn't that right d in this 3D World all you're seeing is these four walls but God have to to do something to elevate you now above what you're accustomed seeing at that level God have to raise you above that in order to catch a fresh Vision in order to catch a fresh image catch a fresh Hallelujah inspiration in order for God to speak to you in order for God to shake you he had to pass you through stuff some stuff might hurt you some stuff might might challenge you some stuff make you cry some stuff make you moan some stuff make you shake but it's good for you because you need the shaken to shake you out of what you're in and to shake you into God's program somebody say amen hallelujah hallelujah think it's in the American Army they say that pain is when weakness is leaving your body that's what pain is pain is when weakness is leaving your body oh because after a while you're pain in you now but after a while your body will begin to adjust to the training until it no longer pain in you to do 10 push-ups now you need to learn the pain of 30 push-ups now you need to learn the pain of 50 push-ups what is God doing he's building he's building he's building something in you something that will last something that will stand something that will stand the test that is coming in these last days Goliath is coming you better be ready oh I to stand and face your goliat glory to God Amen brother brandham said I'm only building the hour is close at hand when you'll see something Hallelujah when all of this background is just for a short quick message that will shake the whole nation oh Hallelujah and I believe this morning that short quick message will beail will be unveiled in you hey do believe it this morning amen sometimes what we seeu changes who we are Hallelujah this scripture that we read is revelation is a letter that Jesus give to the Church of L isn't that right this is the revelation of Jesus Christ to the church written by John on the a of Patmos isn't that right serving his sentence serving his time he's just there God handing there for a purpose isn't that right cuz all of a sudden Vision break to John and a voice speaking said come up hither what is it said Revelation 1 and verse 9 says I John who also am your brother and companion in Tribulation I think myself not higher than you for this cause God just chose me for a purpose but I'm your brother oh Hallelujah in trial and tribulation isn't that right amen and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ and I was in the aisle that is called patmas for the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus Christ John said I was in the spirit on the Lord's day oh how many in the spirit this morning if you want God if you really serious about God speaking to you you have to be in the spirit you have to be worshiping you have to be praising God anointing can fall upon dead you got to be alive unto God oh somebody help me praise him this morning somebody help me shout somebody help me worship him you don't hear what I'm saying oh I was in the spirit on the Lord's day this is the Lord's day it is marvelous in our eyes this is the day that the Lord has made we will rejoice and be glad in it the Lord has chasen me soore but he had not given me over unto death I come in the house of God this morning to let the devil know I'm still alive he didn't get me he can't get me cuz my name is on that book Hallelujah give all a shout of Praise hallelujah hallelujah glory to God amen hallelujah oh I'm not going to tell you to sit or stand you just praise God you just ride the anointing oh Hallelujah will we watch God move this morning amen oh my oh Hallelujah so say his word all right and he heard me a great voice as a trumpet he heard behind me a great voice of a trumpet John said said I am Alpha and Omega this is the announcement I am the first and the last what thou seest write it in a book and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia unto Ephesus and unto SP and so forth amen is that right we know it unto lisia as well and so when we find it in this letter to laia where God rebukes a church and it's condition that it has found itself in isn't that right amen amen and he says here in verse 17 because thou sayest I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked what a condition to be in isn't that right and from what I understand this city in Asia Minor of laia was actually a very wealthy City it was Wealthy by trade trade by Commerce and by industry one of the things it was very known for was for modern medicine oh and different things like that it was actually a wealthy City and so the natural type the spiritual isn't that right so the condition of the people but God is speaking of a spiritual thing here a spiritual condition oh hallel the attention is drawing his attention to he said now so tonight uh so this morning we want to focus our attention on this state of blindness this state of blindness that the people in this age have into is a state of blindness blinded by riches blinded by increasing Goods they are blinded by Creeds blinded by dogmas blinded by their own ideas blinded by their own interpretations blinded by their own conception of how things are supposed to be how things are supposed to go those things actually blind you oh from seeing the truth from seeing who God is from seeing who you are from seeing who the devil is and because people are blinded by these things because people have veils over their hearts they cannot see what God is trying to show them oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right the Pharisees and the Sadducees had failed over their hearts oh and they couldn't see Christ they couldn't see the manifested one walking down the streets Healing The Sick raising the dead casting out Devils he only take good to the people but they couldn't see that all they saw was a heretic all they saw was a blasphemy all they saw was somebody trying to upset our stuff upset our way of doing things trying to play Hero what they didn't know was this was a manifestation of the very word that they were taught to Hallelujah to know but they didn't understand and their actions did prove that they didn't understand that they could not see with eyes they could not see and hear and they could not understand what Jesus was saying oh but he was coming not for a natural Kingdom he said my kingdom is not of this world if it was my men would fight for me but my kingdom is of the spirit my kingdom is from heaven and I come to let you know that the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand and tonight the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand get everything out get all the idols out get down the trash of laia and let's build an altar unto God and restore the worship restore the sanctification restore the Oneness restore the Purity restore your prayer life restore prayer restore worship restore praise kick down Idols are you hearing me this [Music] morning oh oh as a man taketh in his heart so is he 2024 it's going to be a different year we speak it we Proclaim it we profess it out of the measure of faith that we have what we see should make a church what we see and make a Revival what we see or to boil the trash out what we see or to get you desperate what we see or to make you get up from them chairs and start to worship God what we see or to make you serious about what God is doing in this hour what we see that our may see oh you don't hear me this morning Hallelujah glory to God hallelujah I'd rather you're hot or you're cold I'd rather you on fire or tell me you don't love man you never did but don't come lukewarm don't come halfway God Don't Make halfway and he don't like it either and if you don't like halfway work how much more God he will spew it out of his mouth you NOS he at me the prophet said make him Delirious with your halfway worship your halfway praise your half-heartedness repent be zealous therefore and repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand today you hear his voice Harden not your heart as in the provocation in the wilderness when men were abstinence to God's law don't you be stiff neck don't you resist the Holy Ghost this might be your last service don't you resist the Holy Ghost he wants to come into you and fill you with his love woo iwake my soul awake saltery awake hop I will awake early oh my what a scripture amen wow wow let us wake up times are evil evil just as it was in the days of Noah when men thought evil continually to the point where it vexed God till he and all repented if God and all could repent and oh God who are we who are we we have something to repent for we not all together straight every one of us crooked in some way bent misshapen in some way we come into the world born in sin shaped in iniquity that's how you come you didn't come covered in ice cream you didn't come covered in lollies you come born in filth born in the mess of Filth that is of the world and its atmosphere every man walking the Earth is hotwired to do sin to do evil to do all imaginable things give him a chance give him power give himone money he looking sheepish and quiet but give him power and see what resident inside of there lying inside so quiet so docile you never think that that is the kind of man it [Music] was I did a I did an in-depth study on tyrants in the pass during the early 1900s right and God told the prophet he said there will arise isms three isms isn't that right and one will swallow up the other two which you know is communism that's swallow up Fascism and Nazism right yeah isms and the way the angel told the prophet you know is you know he's talking about spirits spirits that would rise up great intellectuals great Powers you know Great Men of renowned just like in days no same thing same Spirit they don't die they just take on other bodies new bodies and they perform the same uh level of piety and Hess thinking themselves Gods yeah thinking themselves gods they actually say it with their mou Hitler Stalin musolini Beto musini the all of them had a title the fural hey isn't that right isn't that right the fur the high one everybody say he say uh H Hitler yeah that was the salutation after he finished his great speech and he culminate up to the great climax where mother Germany and mother Austria this Austrian German Alliance will take over the world hi Hitler hi Hitler hi Hitler and he prais in his glory Hitler himself said he thought to himself that he was here to continue the work of Christ so I turned cross sideways he saw himself as a as almost a pontiff for that is as almost a priest for that that is Anointed with the spirit of tyranny to control and to dominate and to rule and to oppress you see they give a vision to the people that they know the people would like that would sweeten their taste wordss yes we'll come together we'll have this new policy we'll have this new social order and we could all benefit from it but what he didn't show them was who was supposed to sit on the top of the throne and control all of this Oneness and all of this Wess freeness they was telling the people it was just lies because it was just a a road map their own personal road map to power that's all it was and they deceived themselves and they deceived the people too because they rose up in uh uh positions of influence and then begin to seow their seeds of discrepancy into the minds of people till they become so brainwashed that I think during mousy Dong's reain people killed teachers people kill Elders in the name of what they call the Red Army the Red Army of Communism and the Book of mouse a tongue which told you how to live your life and what morals and Scruples to live by these men wrote their own Bibles these men wrote their own way of doing things isms schisms rose up among the people but God allow all of that because mysteriously in all these isms they all had a hate for the Jews they all had a hate for God's people and but brandom said that was God's gentle hand of Jehovah pushing his people back into their position into Israel becoming a nation into that Olive Branch bringing forth again oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh my so it's deception it's a deception that blinds them makes them see different pictures it makes them see the pictures of the one who's doing the influencing right because there's only two Powers there's a devil and there's godallah that's it it's no rocket science if it's not God then it's something else and that something else could always be attributed to the devil because we were born in s shap iniquity and the devil know by default you will do foolishness anyway so he just give you a little breadcrumb and as soon as he start up he could fly because remember he walking to and fro looking to see what destruction he cause he do have enough time to spend with you but he will start a little argument here to get you out of the spirit to frustrate you and now he gone cuz a wildfire listen the devil smart today if two rhinos fighting in the forest all the other animals is not to run so when he start his trouble he run because he not going to stick around for that he have other people to see about but when he throw a attack at you and you love anyway when he throw attack at you and you forgive anyway when you throw attack at you and you apply the word all of a sudden he's confused because here's somebody who's not responding to the wild attacks like everybody else does oh Hallelujah that's why when the devil come around after after Jesus 40 days fasting he come and he find this man sitting around in the desert saying what are you doing he's hungry he's fasting he hadn't had any meat and the devil saw opportunity to throw some wild attacks at this the Son of God oh isn't that right oh Hallelujah and this man said it is written it is written it is also written Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God oh he give him the word he give him th he give him lightning bolts oh right from the authority of the word of God what does that tell me brother you can live a life just by the word alone if you take that word the devil cannot harm you he cannot penetrate the words defense oh the name of the Lord is a strong tower the righteous run into it and they are saved oh Hallelujah when you can hand this word [Applause] there Bible said the devil left him for a season he get so much licks he had to go and take a timeout they go and steal some GS from the clinic and go and nurse his wounds because he got the word punch and there's coming up a bride in these last days she's is going to give the enemy the word punch the word punch right in the neck C he can't say nothing else the word shut him up Hallelujah the word let him know where his place is anytime he tell you about your faults your cares your feelings show him where his end is show him there's a lake of fire waiting for him but for me there's glory after glory after Glory even as by the spirit of the Lord tell him Lucifer I'm changing this morning I'm changing from glory to glory to glory I'm being transformed by the renewing of my mind that I can prove the acceptable and perfect will of God for this end time oh hallelujah hallelujah give him praise oh [Applause] glory amen so these Isam rose up and you know how it happened and so forth many people died under those regimes needlessly young men with so much promise women innocent children wars were fought people lost their lives for what seem like foolishness isn't that right what seemed like nonsense after a while because like Germany today doesn't even look like what the Nazi dream that Hitler was trying to build there's nothing like that today it's completely different thing isn't that right all these things and what they call the father of modern China maam you know and some of his thoughts still perpetuated you know even North Korea North Korea was a was a product of the Soviet Union that was the Soviet Union's dream they were the fruit of it and they're still living under that regime they're still living under that uh Iron Fist you know of tyranny breaking the people breaking into people's minds I think just the other day a family got out and they were saying a new a news exclusive about about it about how the family got out and you know it was it was interesting because one people one person said um that newspapers was something you couldn't just toss around and throw around they had it in a glass case and every morning when it come out the new fresh paper for the morning would come out in this glass case and it had to be revered and respected as the words of Kim Jong-il or the words of Kim Jong-un or whoo whoever is making this news exclusive and the point of it is is that they cover the people's eyes with their perception of reality people in North Korea have no access to Google they have no access to YouTube They don't know about people in Trinidad they don't know you exist and all they know is that USA is the enemy their children are taught to learn that USA is the enemy and that Kim Jong-un is God that that's right they sit in preschools singing Kim Jong-un is God he knows our thoughts he's our father he will take care of us just like how you singing you know pop goes a weasel they're singing worship songs to these leaders who have become great influence over the people and what God I I I keep seeing it I just keep seeing it that God wants to influence the people the right way God wanted the people to have a king it just wasn't king they wanted they wanted Saul but God always had in his heart a man after his own heart he always had David to come and take that throne and to show people what true leadership really is what true [Applause] want it I'll give it to you you want your inheritance early I'll give it to you you do what you want you run your run but I know when the time come you will truly see what you need and all these material things it's not worth it anymore all these fads all these Fashions all these things that you're chasing oh it's not worth it anymore because it doesn't satisfy the longing in the soul and The Thirst in God the heart of man to want more of God it's God that put that thirst in there oh Hallelujah God put it inside of you he put a seed of predestination inside of you so that you could hunger and thirst after righteousness and the Bible said blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled this morning if you are hungering this morning if you are thirsting after righteousness this morning don't be afraid don't be ashamed lift up your hands open up your mouth close your eyes say it's me Lord standing in need of prayer it's me Lord I'm hungering it's me Lord I'm thirsting after righteousness and I want to be filled oh may he open your eyes this morning that you might [Applause] see truly see what the mirror of the word is showing you you'll always see your inadequacies right that you don't measure up when Isaiah saw what he needed to see because King Uzziah had died and he was a man he looked up to he was a man he leaned on he was a man he you know he he respected his words he respected his presence and here he was cut from him and God causes that sometimes let great men fall so that others could see that God Not Afraid as brother say Friday to kill to let you know that he not taking sides with with unrighteousness or that he's not taking Sid with filthiness he's not taking sides with Idols he not Tak inside with worldly desires he not Tak side with what you think he not what Tak inside with what you feel God is no respect to a persons whatever you have to cut off he will cut off he will remove things from your life he will take the surgeon scalper and cut things off from your life cut off the excess flesh cut off the world cut off the influence Lust For Women lust for money Lust For popularity lust for Big Ideas these things are supposed to be dead to the believer oh Hallelujah the only life you're supposed to see is the Life of Christ Living out of you every day living for your brother oh you thought brotherly kindness was for you to stand on a hill and say I have brother kindness I for I can forgive really really come down from that Hill please and go shake hands with your brother because that's what brotherly kindness is for godliness to be like God patience going knowing what's in their heart Temperance knowledge isn't that right the prophet said these things it's for others he said the gift is for [Applause] others God wants to raise you up for such a time as this just like he raised Joseph up for such a time as that to bring his brothers out of famine and to bring them into a Land of Plenty just like God raised up Esther for such a time as that he said if I perish I perish she said but I got to go into the the king's courts to save my people there will be a bride on the earth she'll be able to go when no man has come before Oh Hallelujah and plead for our family plead for our loved ones plead for those who don't have the strength to come into the house of God this morning you're going to live such a life that will draw all men unto Christ hallelujah oh he has no hand but your hands he has no feet but your feet he has no heart but your heart to use oh Hallelujah he come into your heart give your heart a flesh I had to serve him I had to love him oh Hallelujah he put his to uh his heart into your heart his Spirit into your heart give you a new heart give you a new spirit then take his Spirit fills you with that then he makes you a servant of the most high now you're representing the kingdom of God not this church not this group not not this set of Believers but you represent the kingdom of God wherever you go you are flying the Kingdom flag wherever you go you are flying the Jesus flag oh Hallelujah come unto me all that are weak and lowly and I'll give you rest Christ in you out of your belly shall flow rivers rivers rivers of Living Water oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh myall okay so coming back to this state of blindness it's not a natural blindness but it's a spirit of deception a lack of spiritual Insight lack of discernment lack of understanding so many things that they lack and and and the Bible said there in second Peter where we read he that lack these things is blind that's right there's something you lack just like the Rich Young Ruler he knew there was something he lack he knew it in his Spirit even though people tell him you're you're nice you're good you you look good mean you have nice clothes and stuff like that you know you have assets you have you know your signature actually holds something I don't know if I could say the same but his sign could hold something you know what I mean when he signs so powerful P signature you have the assets you have the the goal to back that up you know but he still lack something he had good material things Treasures wealth he had ACR many things but he still lacked something and he knew it and even though the commendations of the people at that time might have told him the Pharisees might have told him you're good sades told him man don't worry about you we cool you're name on the list man you have backstage pass on worry about that you cool but still he knew for [Music] himself nothing don't beat you more than your own conscience he knew that something was wrong and the only person turns out to give him an answer on that was Jesus Christ the only person that could turn out was this Homeless looking man imagine this rich boy wearing Louis vitton and Hermes or whatever they had that and and he's coming down to meet this looking like a homeless man with a bear a straggly bear walking the streets of Jerusalem walking the streets of Judea and and and and galile with little old sandals on and didn't look like much but there was a life he was living there was something about his Works something that you couldn't deny that was real about him just his very presence yet there was a kindness yet there was a love a corrective love an instructive love he didn't speak lovely the truth he told that boy what he needed to [Applause] know my but it grieved him you know and and this is the lesson not all can come to itlu Jesus said it easier for a camel to pass through the I have an needle in M punch then a rich man enter the kingdom of God right there is when those words made manifest it grieved him because he he had many possessions but he just wasn't willing to part with it he didn't have what it took to give it all up for something higher because he just couldn't see he couldn't see a need for that yet am he was told now the truth now he has the truth now he has the truth but the question is what are you going to do with the truth that's right you know a a pardon is a pardon until accept it as a pardon it's a pardon the president signed it it's not a fake signature it's not an adobe uh uh PDF file he literally signed with a pen like a real pen but you don't believe that is for you you didn't receive it for yourself and so you have to suffer the qu consequence of the law is not right whatever it says at that point because you're not willing to accept the pardon here's a way out here's a way out of the of the of the dire circumstance that you're in and yet you're not able to receive what is being said about you what a sad condition and that's what happen when you don't see so that's why we're bringing to you this morning that thou mayest see now God has a remedy for this we'll get to it the definition of blindness it means in the in the scientific sense having less than uh one out of 10 normal condition or normal vision of the sufficient eye and so forth like that it refers to a sightless person it can also refer to Blind loyalty you could be loyal and yet still blind that's right yeah you could be loyal very loyal very willing very able yet you're blind because your loyalty is going to something going towards an effort that actually is leading to destruction and it's not leading to profit or gain or for the kingdom of God or whatever isn't that right you could be Loy to things that are that that blindly leading you into your death isn't that right just like the prophet said the goats when they ready to get put Lambs into the slaughter they put a goat in front and have the Lambs come behind him and as soon as they reach the slaughter house the goat jump out the way pull the go off and the lamb are going Hallelujah dead lamb blind loyalty just following whoever's in front you get misdirected so I following his K cuz he look like he know where he going next thing know he pulled by the r shop well guess what you in your R shop too it happens to us if you don't have Google and up following some car somewhere where he going he going home you need to know where you going you need to know where you driving your car you need to know where you're staring your soul at you need to be guided and led by something and God gave us his word to lead us and to guide us into all truth he said the spirit of truth will come he he give you the truth then he give you the spirit of Truth he said the spirit will come and show you the things that I've said and guide you into all truth and show you where to place it how to place it hallelujah hallelujah here a little there a little line upon line precept on precept until you come into the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ oh and from his very own heart he would Place leaders in the church some Apostles some prophets some evangelists some pastors some teachers with this in their hearts with a pyramid in their hearts to lead the people to Christ it won't be them but it'll be Christ directed service oh Hallelujah speaking to the people an entrance minister to you abundantly into the Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ God has emissaries this morning and I believe he's training such emissaries he's training such men in the backs side of the desert to meet the challenge of the hour because there is a challenge what is a challenge Goliath is on the field proclaiming to have so much power and have so much rank 40 days and 40 nights he stands unchallenged what is he he is intellect he is mighty powers of man he is conly devis Fai he is craftiness of men but there's a David out there this morning Who's On The Backs side of the desert oh Allelujah coming to the bear test coming to the lion test oh it seems so hard this morning but God is putting you through test because there's a Goliath out there that remains unchallenged who can tame those Devils who can tame this devil in this last day or this court of this evil age who can tame this Lucifer voice out there taunting the people and dominating the people oh but there was a voice that did it one time there was a voice that said Lazarus come forth and that man came out of a gravestone hallelujah praise God a man I was dead 3 days 4 days if he didn't say Lazarus the whole grave would have shook loose all of the graveyard would have shook loose because of that voice and God's getting ready in this last day to put that voice in you to put that voice in a bride and once more this Pride will speak and it will flash like lightning she will have thust say the Lord or keep still Hallelujah Give the Lord a shout of Praise hallelujah hallelujah that's why he put you through the test that's why he put you through all those hard stuff because he can't give you that power unless you know how to handle it till he bring to a point where you could see and even then it's just the start of the thing but he needs you to see something isn't that right cuz if you can see it you can have it your eyes need to be open it's not right having no regard blind loyalty no regard for rational discrimination uh dis uh guidance or restriction see blind choices lacking a Direction or controlling conscious a blind Choice making a blind Choice it's called it impulsive Choice isn't that right just take it blindly not thinking it through five years down the road will this thing still make sense just do it blindly and we suffer the consequences of those isn't that right they call it drunk sense blindness all is still blindness made or done without the sight of certain objects or knowledge or certain facts means you were delious or deluded by something caus you to be intoxicated think spiritually now Intoxicated by something drunk with something isn't that right and it uh H uh blurred your vision it clouded your judgment that's right was like cotton in your mind Lord you to make a choice that outside of your right thinking you would not have made but the people are

but he couldn't he didn't hold on to it he let go the word and he took the interpretation that Eve brought from The Serpent and that's how they lost the whole thing isn't that right so in order to get

gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich oh so you thought you was rich no no no you need God's goal in order to be rich and God's goal is character formation that is God's goal not this material thing that we make so much pride of that we so proud about to show others that's not the real goal but said that is caner that is rust that's just material things but what God wants to give you is something that don't canker something that don't rust something that don't fade away to every trial it Crees stronger in fi giving praise to God the trial of your faith working patience oh

it I love it and every story that come forth is a testimony of God's love Hallelujah testimony that God is faithful the end of the story is always wonderful God loves Happy Endings he loves wonderful endings he loves glorious endings he loves when you come praise God hallelujah into the fullness into the stature of what he had in his heart on alone oh the great artist love to see his Masterpiece come praise God into visibility oh into fruition into a reality and that's the story of your life this morning every trial every testing every persecution God is raising up something in you you cannot do that that is the word in you being perfected that is awaiting you and you are being cut down to the word only shaped and molded for a purpose to teach others in the way amen isn't that right oh my hallelujah hallelujah all right gold TR in the fire that's what God has first lesson so that don't may be rich see first thing he's going to do to bring this uh remedy to this blind and naked Church isn't that right a white reignment he said that thou mayest be clothed and right right that white is the righteousness of the Saints isn't that right he clothes you in righteousness clothe you in Purity clothes you in Holiness he says I am Holy oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right we serve a holy God you are not holy but he is Holy therefore he have to closethe you you're not going to clothe yourself there's no man-made leaf that you could use to cover yourself that'll just be a religion that's just a facade but what you need is God's clothing of his righteousness upon your life what you need is his seven color rainbow coach upon your life cloth in his righteousness oh Hallelujah he'll give you a robe he'll give you a wedding garment so that you can come to the supper of the [Applause] lamb and not have to steal your way in some other way because those that do that will be casting out of Darkness where there's weeping and wailing and nashing of teeth isn't that right so pretty much amen these are the things we need here see he said now anoint th eyes with eyes that thou mayest see praise God isn't that right loud thisa was known for its medicines to be able to heal the eyes praise God to heal vision and God is saying while you have all this natural medicine but you all don't have spiritual vision all this natural vision all you claim to have all you can make glasses into two days pray all have all this advancement in technology and scientific but you can't give yourself spiritual vision you need my eyes in order to let you see what you need to see in these last days or you'll walk blind or you'll walk not knowing oh where to put your foot oh H but the word of God has to be a lamp onto your feet has to be a light onto your path so that you could see where you're going what you're going to you to open your eyes then you have to give you a lamp which is a word to show you where to go just like the foolish virgins isn't that right five or wise five or foolish but they all had lamps isn't that right they all had vessels with oil in it but one had extra and one didn't now the thing I love about lamps we talk about five wise five version right right so we're showing the difference between two groups and that's how Jesus Illustrated it right but when you look at it a lamp you can't the lamp that long time lamp was like a finger thing there a little thing you hook your finger in it was like a little spout it had the oil inside and the wick and the end of the spout and that was the light that light so small is only enough light for one person you know there's only enough light for one individual at a time understand what I'm saying carefully I can't take my lamp and say all three of us will walk down the road it's not enough light for that it's just enough light for you to see where you going in so even though you know it's Illustrated five wise five foolish you have to see also the clear picture that each one had to have oil in their lamps there's an individual thing in there in that scripture you have to see that each individual have to have oil in their lamps and what the Bible is really clearly showing is that there will be individuals in the last days who will belong to a group it's a group but there will be individuals and each one will have their vessel with extra oil and then there'll be this other group of individuals who will have their vessels with no extra oil you see it now so it still come down to Man by man it still come back to that because you have to make your calling an election show nobody else is responsible for you getting your extra oil you are responsible this morning somebody say Amen you have to pray you have to clean up you have to sweep your house you have to have a house cleaning time you have to get desperate you have to pray you have to get your lamp you have to get serious you have to stop sleeping you have to wake up and rise and get on fire for God you have to

himall let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man is taught don't let it blind you this morning is the D see there is a bomb in Gilead there is a physician there who could anoint her eyes

of God breaks your Stony heart the presence of God breaks the feets the presence of God breaks the chains from off your heart all that cold Darkness all those no praise demons all those things you can't do all those things you feel you can't overcome all those things you feel you can't come to oh God will break you to the point where you surrender where your face is under the ground where your arms are outstretched before you oh god of Israel have mercy upon my [Applause] soul Hallelujah Paul before he was Paul he was Saul and he was on his way on the road to Damascus on his road to do great destruction in the name of the Pharisees in the name of their highest order he was the K man he was their great executioner come with letters he come with documentation he commit authority to persecute the people of God at that time the Bible said more there was a great persecution going on but all of a sudden while Saul was on his way to Damascus a light overshadowed him a great light come upon him oh he met he get a contact with something the Bible said the men around him Heard a Voice but they didn't see anything but it was it was Saul who looked up and he saw something it was a light so great it blinded him he spent three days in the dark and God dealt with him God deal with him he sat in darkness until God was ready for him and when when God was ready for him God broke unto ananas and said go and visit brother Saul and give him a prayer from me oh Hallelujah go pray for him that his eyesight might be restored and that he might receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost oh god

and you have gold and you have need of nothing but I counseled the to come bu of me gold tried in the fire the fire of God's testings and trials and persecutions the test sins of oh God's Great Character school isn't that right of training God's great training school of character development God School of Hard Knocks that's right that's right hard tests hard trials hard persecutions some of it is your own doing he all all of that he let you run your run because he knows what inside of you and he knows you'll come to the knowledge of a truth at some point point in time so he gave you just enough rope praise God for you to have a nice run but when he's ready for you he'll pull his rope of predestination there's only so far that you could go oh that God cannot find you the Bible says the Earth is the Lords and the fullness thereof and all they that dwell therein and if you dwelling in the world and God's got you right in the palm of his hands oh he died for you he paid the price for you on calvary's tree and he's not about to let you go now you are going to live for Jesus oh God is going to break you and melt you and mold you and shape you he let this happen for his glory he let this happen for his name's sake oh he makes a way where there seems to be no way oh though he seemed unlovable he C something on us worth loving and that's why he died for us this morning that's why I could come into the house of God and give God praise and give God honor and give God glory oh H he loved us I love him because he first loved me he said you have not chosen me he said but I have chosen you and ordained you to bring forth fruit oh Hallelujah I what fruit God give the devil can never take away your fruit shall remain it shall remain through every trial through every storm through every Tempest of Life your fruits will remain how is that possible well because the trees is connected to the roots down there in The Roots is where the secret is the word is in the bride so the fruit is only showing what's in The Roots the fruits comes from the roots so the devil could sway you this way that way this way the fruits still come up why because the roots are very deep deep in the love of God oh H you know him and he knows you and he lives inside of [Applause] you Hallelujah devil tried to take your fruit you just keep boing more fruit bearing more fruit much fruit amen hallelujah Galatians 5 more fruits coming out fruits of the spirit love joy peace longsuffering praise God because of what's down inside amen we're built on a foundation and Jesus said A wise man build his house upon a rock isn't that right Hallelujah unwise un the foolish man build his house on the sinking s but look when the test come is when the Rain Begin to Fall oh both houses would look nice both houses might have three bedroom and car lot for two cars and a alarm and AC and thing all two car two houses looking nice painted white with shingles and solar system built inside to save electric energy both house build real nice but only one will stand and one will fall when the test come that's when you know which house is built upon a rock oh and there's coming an hour when God's spirit will prove what is fruit oh hallelujah what is a flesh and what is built on the things of God oh hallelujah hallelujah there's coming a great test that will prove all who claim to be who they say they are oh if God didn't raise you up then you will be brought down oh because everything that can be shaken will be shaken so that the thing that can be be shaken the thing that cannot be shaken will remain oh hallelujah hallelujah make sure you can stand a test my brother oh my I'm running on oh time is going but I pray that God is blessing you this morning amen amen oh my I come to B me go try to fire a different kind of gold yeah a go that's tried in a fiery furnace that went through the fire of death and went out went through Calvary and then come out lot of this gold you get now is tarishi he says this is way he says it says it it's canker it'll rust you can mark it down this is James uh James 5 1-4 he said you get you get what it is he said go you richet men now in the coming of the Lord weep and howl for your miseries has come upon you for your goal is cankered in you see he said that's the kind of goal that caners but the goal that Jesus gives is the Holy Spirit the golden oil of the spirit pours into your heart and Oh my he says counsel you he said come by of me gold he said if you want to get rich oh yes buy of God's gold this morning amen make the right investment this morning buy gold tried in a fire God's goal isn't that right amen all right also they were blind he said no that's a bad way to be he said I don't think these Christians was so blind as they was nearsighted he said I believe they were nearsighted he said and the only thing they could look at was their big buildings oh so they could they could only see right in front of them near sighted I believe I'm a bit near side of myself amen if I took this off I can't see your face so I could enter into the scripture here this uh this quote in Prophecy because you could only see so much I could stay here and just read this but can't see a far off and that's the problem the people can't see a far off and they have forgotten that they were purged from their old sins and somewhere along the way they end up straying from the truth 2 degrees north 2 degrees north 2 degrees north then later on now you find them themselves way off to the side somewhere what happened they got off from the Beaten Track they got off from the beaten word they fell away from their first love oh hallah like we heard on Friday remember from whence thou was fallen and come back the voice of God is calling out to you this morning come back to your first love come back to when he loved you come back to when you felt his power to when you felt his presence God wants to keep pushing you on on on into the resurrection but you've got to stay burning for him burning with desire burning with love for him oh love to pray love to get into his presence love to be in his presence love to come to church praise God love to create an atmosphere all these things here isn't that right oh man but the people got blinded they got blinded by things cares of this life isn't that right seed is soon many fall here and there some fall upon this Wayside isn't that right and the Wayside from what I understand is like a pavement it's like they take I think they they used to take a flattening thing long time and they used to flatten the ground they make it hard so the point of the way side is it's hard ground it doesn't catch and receive the seed that is being sown out there it's so hard that it can't take root so it it matted down it's not soft it's not pliable there's no reception there for the seed to come in and to work in there nothing wrong with the seed but it's where the seed is falling that's the story of the parable there some fell upon Wayside some fell upon thny some fell upon uh is not right the cares of Life some fell up on Weeds cares of Life wrap around them it start off small but it keep increasing in strength increasing increasing and what happened it choked the life of the seed it couldn't produce it couldn't come on to producing fruit it start off hot and sweaty start off looking like something looking with soap full of promise and all of a sudden things legitimate things honest things normal things everyday day things was allowed to choke the things around that plant until the life begin to get sucked out of it these things are parasitical they are parasites in nature they suck the life out of the thing that they wrap around they only care about themselves they don't care about you oh Hallelujah your house might be asset it might turn into a liability because they Plumbing to fix you electrical to fix you have this to fix you have the yir to cut you have this to do you have that to do praise praise God hallelujah isn't that right oh have a comp me go DED in the fire these things are just things oh Hallelujah don't let it wrap around you be jealous therefore and repent and seek the Lord while he may be found seek first the kingdom of God and all his righteousness then all these other things will be added after because you have the kingdom of God in you to deal with those things and put them in their place and also put God in his place over your life cuz he they not supposed to take the throne he is isn't that right there's an order of things and the spirit of God the true spirit will teach you what that order is amen how to put the devil in his place oh when he comes around with his negative thoughts with his negative attitude you can put him in his place and say it is written Satan it is written put him in his place put him in his place this morning and praise your God put them in his place this morning and get on fire for God put them in his place this morning and begin to pray begin to seek the word seek the name of the Lord oh Hal concerning your life oh Hallelujah my my my oh praise God hallelujah my nearsighted see I believe they're nearsighted the only thing they could look at was their big buildings the only thing they could look at was their big congregations the only thing they could look at was their well carnish choir with all his big robes and things he said I think they were just nearsighted they couldn't see over their nose hardly and I don't think they were blind they were just nearsighted all they could see was well you know what we belong to so so so big denominations see so they could see but only so much isn't that right they could only see their Church their little circle where they live their problems their sorrows and they lack the ability to have a burden for something else to have a a burden for someone else to have a burden for the kingdom of God to have a burden for the things of God they lack that they could only see so far oh don't get nearsighted friends oh Faith ought to give you a revelation to give you a farsighted Vision to give you a long range Vision to know what you have to come to and every day we come into this house of God we come to see we come to measure up with what we are supposed to be looking unto we're supposed to be looking unto Jes Jesus the author and finisher of our faith we're supposed to be looking onto Perfection and if you're not perfect yet then you're coming on to Perfection then you're pressing your way this morning then you're fighting your way this morning then you're rallying your way this morning oh H come to get desperate you come to get next to yourself you come to press whatever you have to do you come to press into the presence of God this morning oh you got to come like the bum under the blood issue oh Hallelujah I have a need and Jesus is the only one who can help me with my need and I'm here to press this morning how many want to press this morning press out or watching in press out of laziness press out of slothfulness press out of sin press out of the things that so easily beset you oh somebody help me this morning let's lay aside every weight that so easily beset us this morning and run the race patience the race that is set before us oh hallelujah hallelujah oh myuj see said now they needed the Holy Ghost that's what they needed Jesus said they needed the Holy Ghost to the Lord said them eyes if your eyes are so bad and you're near sighted till you can't see nothing but your big billing here and all this here he said and you forgot me he said but if you are if if you are that blind and your eye is sore Prophet said then I'll send you some Isa yeah he said see it's some strange doctors of divinity they didn't have any of it isn't it they had a lot of perfume they had a lot of theology but they needed is and God's holy spirit Prophet said is the is to massage their eyes and let them look for the coming of the Lord oh Hallelujah and not looked to some interpretation or some Doctrine or some Creed or some man-made idea isn't that right but to look to Jesus oh that's what we come to do this morning to look to him oh brother I thank God he anointed my eyes with eyes Sal that I could see him I see him in my trials I see him in my test that's what is myself does to you when the test is all around and it looks so Bleak and it look so dark and it looked like nobody care about you when the prophet was talking about how he lost his daughter shanon Rose isn't that right and his wife hope and so on when he was going through all of that isn't that right the devil come up with the side of him he said said look he said you God is good he said you'll call yourself your God a good god look what he allow you to go through he's killing your daughter with menitis and he won't even heal her he won't even answer your prayer he won't even talk to you and but Bram said he started in that Outer Circle human senses see T Fe smelling here and and he said the prophet Prophet say he keep winding down into that inner circle into my human Spirit he said because everything he was saying started to connect it started to make sense he started to collapse this devil watch talk about craftiness 6,000 years to perfect his craft and here he come to what what's God's prophit for the age and was working him like that like a wheel in his human senses and then come down into his spirit and start to reason and start to imagine and start of affection and conscious and it start a whole Whirlwind of of of thoughts and and but the the crazy part was that well not crazy but the the astonishing thing Prophet said was that it was all right he wasn't saying any the Satan wasn't saying anything that was that was off or that was wrong he couldn't he almost couldn't dispute him he didn't have a leg to stand on he's grasping on straws there's nothing everything the prophet say was right look he didn't heal your wife look look your brother die look look your daddy die a sinner huh he didn't even save him he didn't do do this and he keep working him like that working him like that working him down working him down wh wearing him down wearing him down wearing him down it could happen to anybody we're human beings we're hotwired to fail but brother Bram said something on the inside reached up and said who is Hope who is Sharon Rose who am I what is my life I am nothing he said to recognize listen I am not in control of any of this but there's a God that is in control he crept up to S Rose he said honey I'll bury in your mother's arms soon or later he said don't worry I'll meet you out there y there's a God out there somewhere he said though he slay me yet I'll trust him and something on the inside inside is what held the rains W Oh Glory that's what you need in your trial that's what you need out there in the streets with them filthy women that's what you need to stand the test that's what you need oh Hallelujah out there with those spirits to contend with them you need something on the inside inside in the soul that anchors the rains that holds the rains that grips the solid rock which is Christ a spiritual faith that grips that Solid Rock riches Christ because a spiritual Faith only recognizes the word and says Amen to that word every single time doesn't matter if the devil's got the whole thing you still have the word to hold on to and the word of God can never fail it is God's Atomic weapon when brother Bram hit the word and he said do he slay me yet I trust him he pressed the button click and boom the devil ran away praise God he scattered the enemy he set off the Detonator oh when he hit that word he said do he slay me yet I'll trust him and boom the bomb went off and within a 5 mile radius they went up the the devil flying screaming oh hallelujah hallelujah the word of God will defeat the Devil every time any place under any condition he will defeat that enemy he's already defeated this morning raise up this morning and believe and receive you already have the victory this morning shout for you have the victory this morning oh shout to the victory shout he has set you free Oh Glory to God the Holy Spirit the eyes have that this message needs is here this morning to anoint our eyes that we could see that we could see God's glory that we could see what he's done for us that he could see what he's done for this church how he brought us through so much hard times things we didn't understand yet God was with us oh we could safely say God was with this little group here he never leave us he never forsake us and each and every one of us in this group here have our own individual testimony of how he brought us through the Miry clear oh I say Church there's something to give God praise for there's something to give God glory for some of you walked away but you came back because there's something within you that's a hole in the rains oh that wasn't you that was Jesus working his way out of you he loved you and he wouldn't let you lost he wouldn't see you lost so he purchased your soul and calvary's tree and made a way for you to come back into his presence the mere fact that you could come in this church this morning and lift your hands and worship God and feel the presence of God that's God's grace upon your life the devil didn't give that and the devil cannot take it away he's a liar he tried to tell you you're not a son of God but look at you you dressed yourself you came into the house of God you said God is control of my life if I am not in control I know someone who is and I come to meet with him this morning and consult with him to buy of him go to receive a white [Applause] rage to receive [Applause] is oh Hallelujah I Ser the Holy Ghost isn't that right oh my we know that the Holy Ghost is the oil of God Prophet is that right and the see means to understand Jesus said unto him verily verily he talking to Nicodemus except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God Amen back to the Holy Ghost again isn't that right Nicodemus said how can a man be born when he's old can he enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born and Jesus answered ver fairily I say unto thee except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God that which is born of the flesh is flesh excuse me and that which is born of the spirit is Spirit Marvel not that I say today you must be born again we're talking about the spirit this morning oh because your natural birth can't save you but there's a birth that can it's your spiritual birth it's a new birth it's a new life oh your whole life is gone out and a new life come in oh hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right the Life of Christ isn't that right Christ is the Miss of God revealed said he's the principal theme of the entire Bible if you read the Bible and you don't see Christ in every verse of it go back and read it again he said see if you can't see Christ in every verse then read it again because you missed something the Bible is Christ and he is his word and when his word is Anointed it is the bomb you need oh to treat with the matter to treat with the disease to treat with your insecurity to treat with your imperfection the word has a remedy the word has the answer the word has the medicine Amen brother bam was preaching he said for years I keep ping the medicine down their throat and they keep spitting it back up through my fingers he said God will judge you for that God give his medicine by his word of God H people keep spitting it back out say they don't believe this they don't believe that oh I don't think the that applies to me and whatnot trying to reason it out God don't need no interpreter he is his own interpreter he will interpret his own word and he will manifest his own word he don't need us C interpreted and if God says separate yourself from all unbelief then that is a word of God then that is a commandment of God then we have to honor that commandment if God said forgive your brother forgive your sister oh H then we have to obey God commands us to do it we have to see that it is necessary but one time brother brandham couldn't see he sit in a barro there judging a woman who's in a condition sitting on the bar stool talking with those guys in the bar stuff like that you know the story The condem her said right don't have to grow up in a world like this and then the Lord tapped him on his shoulder is not right and pul him to the side watch and allowed him to see something showed him a vision isn't that right something broke upon him he saw his own sins and so like that oh we know the story we saw Christ on the cross saw that blood pouring out like a bumper pumping his sins away and every time he would do something wrong the blood would pump his sins away and every time he made a mistake he lie he cheat he steal the blood would pump his sins away isn't that right and then Jesus thr away his sins pardoned it and thr it away and said now watch said now if you con uh if I forgive you then how could you go and condemn her praise God then he come out of it isn't that right now he's seen it now he knows what he has to do oh he went to that woman he said woman I was just condemning you but God showed me something and he began to talk to that woman yes now here's the amazing part of that story Hallelujah here was the prophet isah condemning that woman telling that she was a carrying on Heathen way and dressing this way and that way and here does now he was broken to the point where he he was he was he was on his knees now in his spirit cuz God brought him to his knees and showed him his own sins after having a conversation with the woman only to find out that she was once a Christian that she knew the Lord but she had just Fallen away from the way oh H and just needed to get back it was so easy in his own eyes to see that she was a heathen and that she was lost and he to throw her in a bra patch and say she a worth nothing only when he had that conversation and he contact with her spirit only to find out that she was once a Christian oh hallelujah oh we sit on the seat of the scornful too much judging others the way we see in our own eyes there's a way that seem it right unto a man but the end thereof is it you think you know the answer you think you know the way you think you know people inside of here but you don't know what shoes they're wearing this morning can you wear their shoes can you carry their cross then for God's sake stop talking about them pray for them go on your knees you want to help then go on your knees and help that person in prayer you see somebody suffering don't kick them when they're down pray for that person you don't know what they're going through you don't know the bread they eat the water they drink every day you don't know how they making it every day is a battle every day is a uphill fight every day is a struggle every day is a sorrow you don't [Applause] know we don't see you don't see the everyday struggle struggle it takes to get out of bed in the morning struggle it takes to go and face the day soon as you get up and open your eyes the weight of the responsibilities of the day sets in right away you already know there's a list of things you need to do to get ready this morning oh Hal if you don't pray to tackle them things you a't sure to make it true isn't that right oh we need to pray more prayer ought to be our default response to these things praise before we go to act before we quick to judge before we quick to say or before we quick to put our thoughts into action put prayer into action first seek first to understand then to be [Applause] understood and it takes God to give you a level of understanding so you could enter into the to the to the to the um to the to the Pains of others Lord to enter into the the footsteps of others but a brand and all he took off his shoes you know off of his feet to see if it would fit a man who he's going to pray for he had that ability to enter into the sufferings of others and then he was able to effectively pray for others and the effectual prayer fervent prayer of the righteous will Avail much but you've got to be effectual it's got to be from the righteous it can't be your righteousness it has to be his righteousness it can't be your thinking he says his ways are higher than your ways and his thoughts are higher than your thoughts come up into God's ways this morning come up into God's thoughts this morning oh Hallelujah and begin to enter into each other's sufferings and pray for one another cuz the truth is we don't know we think we see but what we need is I have I have the Holy Ghost to allow us to see the right pictures oh Hallelujah the woman at the well look like like a filthy woman isn't that right go call your husband I have none Jesus saw she had an honest heart the Pharisees wouldn't see something like that cu the first thing they look at is the law and she breaking the law and she living without a man and if we catch she she dead but they're not looking at what she trying to do to survive Prophet said maybe she was trying to take care of her children by by this by this way of prostitution isn't that right but God show her a more excellent way and it took him entering into to that realm to go beyond what man was seeing in front of them God saw a seed a predestination in that woman heart oh God saw something in your heart oh hallelujah oh the world call you filthy the world call you this call you that but God know the potential inside of you that's why he could call you that's why he could love you that's why he could pay the price for you oh hallelujah oh Hal go had a Paul out there the first Messenger to the age just came up with the wrong name that's all had to change his name had to change his life and turn him around and look what come out oh Hall a mighty fruit for the body of Christ amen a mighty gift and I was laying in there in this execution of man a man who had a raer for killing isn't that right Steven was on the hitless he got stried off and yet still God changed that man around and if God could do that for that man then go God could do that for anybody we have to believe it that way I don't know whose name is on the book but let us live in such a way that we could draw men unto Christ that whosoever should be saved could have the opportunity to be saved to come to the altar to make it right with God to make it through oh Hallelujah that Golden Gate oh Hal everyone deserves a chance we have to see it that way we don't know who it is so we have to present the gospel in that way that all have an opportunity we know not all may not respond but all deserve a chance you deserve a chance to come you deserve a chance to hear he that hear Let Him hear what the spirit of Lord is saying to the churches isn't that right and the angel that talking to me saying John said come and see he said come and see the Lamb's wife come and see the Visions Hereafter come and see what God is doing and this morning come and taste and see that the Lord is good blessed is the man that trusteth in him don't take it for somebody else's testimony you come for yourself come to the altar come to prayer come to the house of God yourself come and tase for yourself and see that God is good see that he loves you and see that he is faithful to his word that he is faithful to his promise amen oh I'm almost finished amen my praise God amen well I'll wind up anyway amen praise God oh he's the principal team of the Bible isn't that right oh my so we come into this world in a blind State not knowing right from wrong not knowing which way is up and it took God to show us the way to reveal himself isn't that right and show us that we no longer walk in darkness and that same Jesus that opened the eyes of one blinded the eyes of another isn't that right and we know that even the Jews were blinded so that we could be crafted in oh the only reason we have a chance because someone else was blinded so that you could have have an opportunity to access the Throne of God oh for a limited time only you have an opportunity to access the Throne of God before the Judgment before it turns over and it turns back to the Jews again oh H isn't that right amen amen St John 1 in the beginning was the word and the Word was it God and the Word was God and the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything that was made in him was life and the light of men and he was in the world and the world was made by him and knew him and the world knew him not he came unto his own and his own received him not but as many as received him this morning to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that call upon his name do you believe it this morning a many which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of God and that word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the own Glory as only of the god of the father amen all right praise God St John 1240 said he had blinded their eyes hardened their heart that they should not see with their eyes nor understand with their heart and be converted and that I should heal them and these things said isaas when he said Saw His glory and speak of him and the Bible said nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him lest they should be put out of the synagogue for they love the praise of men more more than the praise of God so some know the truth but they wouldn't come to the fullness of the truth praise God because their heart is somewhere else and where your heart is that's where your Treasures will be oh Hallelujah is that right oh they build their Treasures on natural things on the praise of men don't do that this morning build your hopes on things Eternal and hold to God's unchanging hand this morning hold on to his hand oh because when the Rapture goes his hand will go up and you'll go up with it if you're holding to him oh isn't that right amen and amen amen oh Hallelujah Queen of Sheba the prophet said we find that those who ordained to life saw it and those who were not ordained to life didn't see it the gospel blinds those who are not willing to accept it and it'll give sight to those who are willing to accept it he said and that's the way it was in his days and when the scripture plainly stated exactly the things that he did and said he would do it and how they missed it it showed that they had to be blinded and to think them poor Jews were blinded that our eyes might have a chance to be open this morning and now the same gospel that blinded the Jews is blinding the church he says today it's the same thing promise exactly he said and it goes a million miles over their heads he said I'm glad you're recording that Prophet said I'm glad they did amen I know that thus say the Lord that's the gospel the same gospel that blinded the Jews is now blinding the Gentiles oh my it's the same Jesus because it's the same gospel and for there's no other gospel but the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ he said we have many Creeds but there is one gospel he said and what is the gospel the gospel came not in word only but through Power and demonstration and through manifestations of the Holy Spirit to prove that it was the Gospel the sick were heal the blind saw the cripples walk the gospel was preached in its power oh and that same thing is coming back again God is raising up you this morning to prove the gospel to be right the cripples will walk the blind will see oh the lame will walk oh H there will be a Revival once again and this world will hear direct from God do you believe it this morning oh hallelujah hallelujah oh manifestation of the Holy Spirit god making his word come to pass it had to be that for in St m 16 he said go into all the world and preach the gospel and these sign shall follow or otherwise go into all the world and demonstrate the power of the Resurrection is what that means amen he expands on it he's not dead but he's alive resurrection power healing and sick and so forth amen doing the same Miracles he did when he was alive isn't that right and he's depending on you and I to let him work through us to will his will oh hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right oh oh my I can go on there but I I think we got the point amen oh my Hallelujah we touched on this oh wonderful praise I can skip all this through here amen let's get ready to wind this up amen oh hallelujah oh my do you love him this morning amen praise God hallelujah thank you Jesus thank you Father he said see now down to the age we started off to the foundation from the first age when the seed went in the ground the complete seed then it come through the feet Luther then it come back out through Wesley then into Pentecostal then the tongues in the lips see and now it's in the eyes prophetic of Malachi 4 and so forth and now there's nothing else left for it to come but him himself to step into that oh what's next to come he himself to step into your 16 elements to step into his bright body isn't that right cuz that's the last thing there is and he said the next is the intelligence oh hallelujah hallelujah the Supreme we have no intelligence of our own but his he said and we have no sight of our own praise God we can how can man foresee these things see he can do it it's God himself see it's becoming to a place and he's governing the body all the way through and then the complete body of Christ is revealed in the form of a bride that was taken out of his side like Adam did the beginning like Adam's was rather at the beginning isn't that right oh my my think of man's filter he said and I said this morning so this was the ABS the message after afterwards he comes back and talks about it again he says we're in the C and age on the top there's no more faculties above that that you can move outwardly to know you can move from your nose smell from your lips uh you can smell from your nose sorry move from your lips you can speak from your lips and so forth from your hands you could feel you could reach and your feet and so forth but you can't go farther than your eyes and Malachi 4 has come he said sight and it shall be light about the evening time he said oh walk in the light we'll walk in the light a beautiful light that comes where the D Drops of mercies are bright that shine All Around Me by day and by night Jesus the light of the world Amen he said yes sir pass through it oh brother he said and you will come out with a holy man's taste you will come out with the Holy Ghost amen musician can get ready to come forward I'm almost finished isn't that right oh my praise God hallelujah amen do you love him glory to to God hallelujah oh my let me just get something here real quick and then we look to close all right amen so here's my final thought this morning after the scripture we read be zealous therefore and repent praise God that's what Jesus is saying isn't that right Hallelujah he that lack at these things is blind and can't see a far off and that forgotten that he was purged from his old sins oh H we need a long range vision though it t wait for it for it shall surely come to pass it shall not t oh right the vision make it plain oh Hall he can see it could run with it oh H the gospel is being made plain today it's never been made plain in ages past but it's being made plain this morning and what we see ought to get us desperate what we see or to get us on fire what we see or to get us a Praying or to get us a calling upon God or to get us to be zealous be zealous for his word be zealous for the things of God be zealous oh but what's the problem we need to see something we need to eyes myself this morning we need an anointing to come upon our eyes and take the scales off off of us take the largy off take the slothfulness off take the weariness off take the laziness off take the no praise demons off take off the unwillingness oh to do what's right oh Hallelujah give you a spirit of love a spirit of passion to know the word a cry to get into the spirit a fur desire to please God that's what we need in the house of God when we come in here we ought to be burning for Jesus we ought to be burning and if we're not burning this morning then we need a burden we need to catch a burden for the things of God for the program of God for the love love of God for the power of God oh to seek his face to watch and to pray for the days are evil for the time is at hand let us cast off the works of darkness and put on the arm of light let us walk soberly and not with drunkenness let us walk with our eyes open and not in a state of stuper hallelujah oh Hallelujah If my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their Wicked Ways then will I hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land oh hallelujah hallelujah Psalm 51 said have mercy upon me oh Lord according to thy loving kindness according to the multitude of thy Tender Mercies plot out my transgressions Wash Me thoroughly from my iniquity cleanse me from my sin for I acknowledge my transgressions and my sin is ever before me against thee thee only have I sinned no one else in the picture this morning but we see Jesus who we have to give an account for our lives against him only have I sinned this morning oh you could begin to stand and done this evil in thy sight that th mightest be justified when thou speakest and be cleare when thou judgest behold I was shapen in iniquity and in sin my mother conceive me behold thou desires truth in the inward parts and in the hidden Parts thou shall make me to know wisdom Purge me with his up and I shall be clean wash me and I shall be whiter than snow make me to hear joy and gladness that the bones which thou has broken May Rejoice hide my face from thy sins uh and blot out all my iniquities this morning today create in me a clean heart oh God and renew right Spirit Within Me cast me not away from thy presence and take not thy Holy Spirit from me and restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and uphold me with thy free spirit oh then will I teach transgressions in thy ways and sinners shall be converted unto thee oh I'm finished this morning you just begin to worship

Brokenness oh he gave Beauty for Ashes this morning he gave strength for fear oh Hallelujah trade in your Sorrows this morning oh and he'll give you joy joy unspeakable and full of Glory weeping may
