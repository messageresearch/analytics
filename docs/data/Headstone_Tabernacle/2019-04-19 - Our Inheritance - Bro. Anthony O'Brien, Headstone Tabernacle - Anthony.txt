that blood comes back to the worshiper and sanctifies him from the desires of the things of the world for by that all-sufficient sacrifice he has sanctified us once appeared we are all baptized into one body and now there is no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus to them that walk not after the flesh but the Spirit if you're trying to walk by the spirit and still lusting for the flesh the sacrifice hasn't been sufficiently applied to you but the worshiper wants pooch has no more desire of sin he and that was Calvary it wasn't a place to sell flowers it was a little place to do this or that it was a place where God and man were reconciled it was a place where peace and perfect safety was brought to mankind can you go with me tonight my son a friend to Calvary and by faith apply this blood to your own soul and let the Holy Ghost come and sanctify you by his great sacrifice he said before we pray with you raise our hand to God and say be merciful to me that God I now confess

blood you know I was just thinking about that you know a lot of times you talk about the blood of Jesus Christ and the sacrifice that he made for us and we appreciate God we thank God for His goodness and for his mercy and sending his only son to die but when then see when you think deeply into it it had to be blood it couldn't be flowers it couldn't be nice things Cain brought nice things but it wasn't that it had to be blood Cain brought the best of the fruits of the garden Cain set it up just right but the revelation required a blood sacrifice a life had to be given in order to take your place tonight you are sitting in this beauty because somebody time to give you a spot to give you a place in God's kingdom it took a death it took a pain it took a sorrow it took a sacrifice for you

they're looking for revival some no no how clearly it's going to come but it can feel it out there the season is changing God is getting ready to switch over from the prophets to this prophecy to switch over from the natural to the supernatural to switch over from the word that we've heard for all these years but y'all are coming now is when the true worshipers are gonna worship the father in truth and in spirit spirit and truth will be together dynamics and mechanics will be together oh oh and if we could just get started tonight then God will do the rest all you have to do is get started

me man okay God's gonna restore it it's not right now for a thought for a few moments they love him man we love into 90 man no if I talk for a few moments I wanted to speak on why it needed to be blood amen why it had to be blood why it had to be a blood price is nothing but we know that in order for something to live something has to die it's now something has to take its place something had to give its life that's the law in the spirit realm isn't it well it's not even in even if you're practicing witchcraft they need some kind of blood sacrifice whether it's a human life animal life something whatever they want to get where there is money power or wealth or fame or fortune they have to do that they have to set up the altar with a candles and blood and fire on stone and call upon their God to deliver them to give them what they want that's how it works in the spirit realm but the difference with the Christian is that that blood sacrifice was already made for us it's already paid for you don't have to work yourself up it's already paid for he died that you might have life tonight that you can have it more abundantly oh no wonder we give God all the praise and glory it's nothing that you could have done but it's about what he already done before there was a moon before I was a star and lamb came thought in his mind and took the book and loose the seals so when Jesus came he knew what he had to do because the spirit was leading him where he needed to go all the time he say my always not yet come and he keep preaching and prophesy and he little sick I'm prophesying but it come on when he had to set his face so what'd you tell him we could no longer avoid it we could no more circumvent it but he had to come to his hour he had to come to his moment he had to come to his Garden of Gethsemane I'm there the Lion of Judah reveals when he said not my will but I will be done God's Will was creature God's purpose was creature than his own and the son of port was willing to lay his life down for us here tonight took a blood price is now it took a sacrifice to pay for it you know I thought about that ransom you know sometimes sometimes you might go window-shopping it me me and my wife I go window-shopping praise God and we look around see nice things you know if anybody have done that well Quran you know you see something nice so it looks good see that in the window that's wonderful a man I'd like to have that you picture it in your living room you picked it in your bedroom that'll look nice on the dresser isn't that right but it might grieve you because maybe you don't have the money to buy it right now well maybe you don't have the means by which to purchase it right now so it may grieve you because you walk away from it because you can't attain to it right now maybe the price is too high but what a difference it is when when you walk into our store you come in to get something that you have already bought that's such a picture over now you're walking into a store to get something that you've already bought it belongs to you it might have nice things in the store that's wonderful but that's not what you come for you come for was yours you come for what you pay for you come forward to abort Oh see all-knowing God who knew that man was lost who knew that man was fallen who knew that man was in a condition and he needed forgiveness he needed somebody to step in but it had to be a kinsman it had to be one of us but nobody was worried John said no man in heaven I was ready to take the book and to loose the seals thereof and God knew that but he swore by himself that he would restore man Hawkins himself because he alone to do it so love protected itself and when it protected itself Sovereign Grace took over and that sovereign grace so gonna follow flesh oh honey took on a fish it had a mouth oh he wore old he won't comment he were already slippers he walked the streets of Jerusalem hallelujah he was a baby oh honey grew up he learned obedience by the things that he suffered Oh 18 years of silence but he was coming on to something what was Papa God doing Papa God calm down in a pawn shop what he come for he come for his own he told him he said I do nothing unless the father show me first Oh hallelujah hallelujah glory to God become to purchase what was his own Oh Oh the Bible said he came

the sinless one hallelujah amen whoa huh claim what was his own he'd already time he'd already say the lamb in his mind but he come down himself to confirm his own way to confirm what he had already
