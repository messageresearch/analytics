[0:13] Hussein's I bring you greetings in the
[0:15] name of Jesus I come to bring Easter
[0:19] greetings on behalf of my wife and
[0:21] family a happy holy blessed Easter
[0:25] we are not gathering as you all aware
[0:27] because of the current situation and I
[0:30] believe that we will be back together
[0:33] worship in the Lord shortly now this has
[0:38] the Institute in my heart to agree to
[0:39] this morning and I have a scripture a
[0:42] rise and shine this on my Isaiah 64 thy
[0:45] light is come and the glory of the Lord
[0:47] is risen upon thee for behold the
[0:50] darkness shall cover the earth and gross
[0:52] darkness the people but the Lord shall
[0:55] arise upon thee and his glory shall be
[0:57] seen upon thee no to treating I want you
[1:02] to notice here the first thing would
[1:04] speaks to the elect to rise and shine
[1:07] for the light has come and it is almost
[1:10] as a finished work the glory of the Lord
[1:12] is risen upon me and then the Lord
[1:16] addressed the growth doctors are
[1:18] covering it and the crossed artists of
[1:20] people and give us a consolation and the
[1:24] Lord shall arise upon thee and his glory
[1:27] shall be seen upon thee this pandemic
[1:30] darkness at his known covering the earth
[1:33] is affecting the entire world and
[1:36] there's a purpose behind that kauravas
[1:39] purpose behind that and it will be
[1:41] fulfilled so this present world is in
[1:46] darkness right now and and but amidst
[1:49] that darkness God has released the
[1:51] evening light of seventeen and seven
[1:53] thunders that we could be prepared for
[1:56] the coming of the Lord and this Easter
[1:58] this east of the bride is to vindicate
[2:02] and prove the Christ is resurrected
[2:05] among us under that in I just want to
[2:09] read something quickly from the rise of
[2:11] his son and he says they have been
[2:14] churches churches Brides Brides Brides
[2:16] but he has got to come one hallelujah he
[2:19] has got to come a real bride
[2:20] there must come one that not only got
[2:23] the mechanics
[2:24] the dynamics of it to make the church
[2:26] live move in the power of his
[2:29] resurrection until we come to that place
[2:32] until we find that place what good does
[2:34] it do to polish the hops what good does
[2:36] it do to give a facelift when there is
[2:39] no dynamics in it no matter how much the
[2:41] mechanics prove to be right just got to
[2:44] be dynamics to make it work that's what
[2:47] he proved hallelujah that's what Easter
[2:49] proved he wasn't only the word but he
[2:52] was God himself the dynamics in the word
[2:55] that made a body of the Jesus Christ
[2:58] cooled stiffened dead and the grave
[3:00] shaken to life and rise again and roll
[3:02] away the stone I am he that was dead he
[3:06] was unknown alive he was not only the
[3:09] mechanics God's Word he was the dynamics
[3:11] to prove it and he been the groom the
[3:15] bride has to come forth cause it's part
[3:17] of him and it can only be and here we go
[3:19] the manifestation of the full filling of
[3:22] all the revelations any others that has
[3:25] spoken of the bride
[3:26] it can only manifest if it does not if
[3:29] it does something different from the
[3:30] groom it isn't the bride because she is
[3:33] flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life
[3:36] of his life
[3:36] Parviz power so god bless you Saints I
[3:40] consider it a great privilege to be
[3:43] living in what I call dreadful exciting
[3:46] time dreadful for the world exciting for
[3:50] the bride thank you for the privilege of
[3:52] giving us the opportunity to serve god
[3:54] bless you we love you and see you
[3:57] shortly

[4:02] you
