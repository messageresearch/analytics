[59:44] I'm arms I'm had a remembrance in the
[59:47] sight of God he was such he wasn't a

[1:00:33] of a truth I perceive that God is no
[1:00:36] respecter of persons but in every nation
[1:00:38] he that feareth him and worketh
[1:00:40] righteousness is accepted with him the
[1:00:44] word which God sent unto the chair
[1:00:45] Israel preached in peace by Jesus Christ

[1:01:19] which he did both in the land of Jews in
[1:01:21] Jerusalem upon the up whom they slew and
[1:01:24] hung on a tree him God raised up the
[1:01:26] third day and showed him openly not to
[1:01:29] all the people but under witnesses
[1:01:31] chosen before of God even to us who did
[1:01:34] eat and drink with him after he rose
[1:01:36] from the dead and he commanded us to
[1:01:38] preach unto the people and to testify
[1:01:40] that it is he which as was ordained of
[1:01:43] God to be the judge of the quick and the
[1:01:45] dead to him give all the prophets

[1:23:46] will of God for your life
[1:23:49] and sometime in this crash and you have
[1:23:52] to give up your will to enter into the
[1:23:54] will of God but like what a Peter said
[1:23:57] when you are unprotected then you are
[1:23:59] protected or glory that God I'd better
[1:24:01] be in a will of God hallelujah but no
[1:24:04] protection or because going to make a
[1:24:07] work out you think that Butler that
[1:24:18] Joseph interpret the dream to could we
[1:24:20] really put it too hard to remember
[1:24:21] Joseph don't imprison do they say okay
[1:24:24] on your get promotion God God bring you
[1:24:26] home town what the but remember me I
[1:24:27] shouldn't mind supporting and you get up
[1:24:29] little bow tithing and get the chasing
[1:24:31] my truly get that day forget to this one
[1:24:34] time you know this one Ram him because
[1:24:36] of the king what God wanted that because
[1:24:39] Joseph was not ready if you're not ready
[1:24:42] you're not ready or get the Lord I show
[1:24:44] when you are ready cause with the second
[1:24:47] angel when you are ready or to the Lord
[1:24:51] I shock pulling back don't know Syria
[1:24:55] say man if Cornelius had sent for PETA
[1:25:06] before he any holy ghost must be a
[1:25:08] testimony Patel the killer wrong story
[1:25:11] frightening he follow Jesus he
[1:25:14] frightened yeah zero power I'm Jesus no
[1:25:18] longer wrong to protect them and to
[1:25:20] cover them
[1:25:21] so you're sent for pizza know how to say
[1:25:23] this just look out for me just in case I
[1:25:30] want to talk to me privately
[1:25:32] Jesus do plenty miracles I was with him
[1:25:34] he come on everything gone so he
[1:25:42] couldn't call Peter that time and I'm
[1:25:44] beside that I didn't I am you know I
[1:25:46] want to see it by feeling bad I walk
[1:25:52] that man I walk on water but when when
[1:25:54] when I see crucifixion and licks
[1:25:59] I said not me this is Peters testimony
[1:26:07] he's a living witness of denying this is
[1:26:11] his own confession but when that Holy
[1:26:14] Ghost when that power come upon that
[1:26:17] same he was ready to break into
[1:26:22] something he never broken before because
[1:26:25] them Jews have nothing to do with the
[1:26:27] Gentiles so but as Hangul is very
[1:26:29] significant that Peter receive vision so
[1:26:33] go and eat or glory the core to this
[1:26:36] whole thing about hallelujah
[1:26:38] positionally please son here was 100
[1:26:44] glory that God here was a son that was
[1:26:48] positioned on at least give him
[1:26:50] testimony given witness and because he
[1:26:53] was in the body he could release from
[1:26:56] the body the spirit by the word or give
[1:26:59] the Lord a show do you get back this
[1:27:01] morning
[1:27:02] because he was in the body he could
[1:27:05] release from the body the spirit by the
[1:27:07] word because the word and spirit is the
[1:27:09] same thing the words that I speak their
[1:27:11] spirit and their life but after the
[1:27:14] upper neck spirits God was still in the
[1:27:16] wood in the spirit loitering and
[1:27:18] following falling together word and
[1:27:21] spirit falling together this is what is
[1:27:24] promised this is what this prophesied
[1:27:26] why the world is going for the spirit is
[1:27:30] quickening the word to you the spirit is

[2:06:00] rain and it got to have seed to fall on
[2:06:03] I hope I live to see it Oh glory to God
[2:06:08] then he said that gentle disposition is
[2:06:10] to be finished with the church age when
[2:06:12] this anointed messenger arrives of
[2:06:14] course he will plant the seed of the
[2:06:16] entire Bible come from serpent seed to
[2:06:19] the message I know for marine so to see
[2:06:21] the Prophet was to bring was the seed of
[2:06:23] the entire Bible and the Bible is that
[2:06:25] they're the pyramid
[2:06:26] Oh give the Lord some praises for glory
[2:06:29] of God so he was to plant the seed of
[2:06:31] the entire Bible and that pyramid is the
[2:06:34] entire Bible you see level Mexico you
[2:06:41] have to use in Mexican pesos the
[2:06:43] Caillou's it's easy dollar in Mexico
[2:06:44] they will take the time to turn up in it
[2:06:47] has no value dear you have to convert TT
[2:06:49] money into pieces if you go to Germany
[2:06:51] you have to convert your money to euro
[2:06:54] good Jacana is CDs you have to convert
[2:06:57] the money so if God want to see you sub
[2:06:59] mines if called one Church ages you
[2:07:04] seven ponies so if you have to preach
[2:07:08] you have to preach the Bible so this
[2:07:10] becomes the book but if you want life
[2:07:13] that's week of the Bible that's the
[2:07:14] pyramid you have to convert it you don't
[2:07:17] put the Bible book in you you put the
[2:07:19] pyramid in you or give the Lord a shout
[2:07:22] [Applause]
[2:07:24] no the Bible is a mysterious book so is
[2:07:27] that clear in it if you have the Bible
[2:07:29] the pyramid in you you have the
[2:07:31] mysteries in you then if that be so you
[2:07:34] have seven mysteries that they fought
[2:07:38] for to bring back
[2:07:43] [Applause]
[2:07:50] [Applause]
[2:07:56] hallelujah you carry spirit spirit is
[2:08:00] poured out but you preach the word and
[2:08:03] the will turn the spirit and the world
[2:08:06] of this brief tune the Spirit coming to
[2:08:08] you then the word is in you Oh Lori
[2:08:19] let's continue from the breach he said
[2:08:22] he that promised these things in the
[2:08:24] last day he that said these things he
[2:08:26] that is know in the time of the
[2:08:30] revelation of these things being made
[2:08:32] known so for the last fifty years we
[2:08:35] have been living in the time of the
[2:08:38] revelation of these things being made
[2:08:40] known but there comes our when it
[2:08:43] changes from the time of the revelation
[2:08:46] to the time of the manifestation or
[2:08:49] chlorine Oh God can you see it this
[2:08:52] morning
[2:08:52] do you understand all the mysteries all
[2:08:56] the revelations have to be unfolded
[2:08:59] because we have been prophesied that we
[2:09:02] be living
[2:09:03] in the time of the revelation of these
[2:09:07] things being made known but you're gonna
[2:09:10] come on we're gonna change to the
[2:09:13] manifestation or give the Lord some
[2:09:16] freezes are we going good
[2:09:27] do you get that so people still caught
[2:09:31] up in the revolution revolution
[2:09:32] revolution more revolution more
[2:09:34] revolution praise God praise God praise
[2:09:36] God because that gives the minister the
[2:09:41] power to reveal and printings may be
[2:09:46] seated
[2:09:47] when disciples when Jesus was only dead
[2:09:49] and his post resurrection ministry to
[2:09:52] the elected not the people not the feed
[2:09:55] bread and feed the hungry and what
[2:09:56] touches the elect his purpose was to
[2:09:59] bring it to the revelation of these
[2:10:01] things we made known so he went to the
[2:10:03] Old Testament and part of the prophecy
[2:10:05] of Jill probably Professor Isaiah not a
[2:10:08] little stammer in tongues but all the
[2:10:10] prophecies pertaining to what they have
[2:10:12] to fulfill so that's where will be the
[2:10:14] step out he said this is that that the
[2:10:16] Prophet Joel Zwick of he knew exactly
[2:10:18] where to identify the scripture and we
[2:10:20] have a scripture revolution 2017 the
[2:10:23] Spirit come upon the bride we have
[2:10:26] scripture Malachi 4 6 the house of the
[2:10:29] church and back to the faith we have our
[2:10:31] scripture turn back to the say to the
[2:10:33] fathers or give the Lord a shout
[2:10:38] hallelujah hallelujah so I am saying we
[2:10:43] have been through the time and coming to
[2:10:45] the end of time of the revelation of
[2:10:47] these things being made known so I'm not
[2:10:50] debating that and the revelation of
[2:10:52] these things being known with the
[2:10:53] mechanics because I brilliancy were in
[2:10:56] you as the word been unfolded by
[2:10:59] revelation an inspiration it brought the
[2:11:02] seed anew but the secret is in the wood
[2:11:04] is in the bride are just waiting for
[2:11:06] what dynamics
[2:11:07] she's rid of our charity she's waiting
[2:11:10] for what the mind of Christ to know what
[2:11:12] to do with the word
[2:11:14] okay the Lord and show hallelujah
[2:11:17] hallelujah
[2:11:18] the would have to be in you for the
[2:11:21] spirit to come upon you because you
[2:11:23] become the word itself the spirit and
[2:11:32] the bride is the spirit and the wood
[2:11:33] because the bread becomes the word you
[2:11:36] becomes a wood bride income it will it
[2:11:38] bride
[2:11:39] [Applause]
[2:11:41] therefore the spirit follows here ooh
[2:11:47] God dries up the shock and the life that
[2:11:50] was in the shop goes well into the seed
[2:11:52] he and you ever see the Lord a shock
[2:11:57] [Applause]
[2:12:02] do you see it the seed is planted it
[2:12:06] grow to processes talk and starter
[2:12:09] leaves and all that stuff but the sea
[2:12:12] traveling on somebody said we feel the
[2:12:14] Spirit of God yes it passed through you
[2:12:16] must feel it but the Spirit of God have
[2:12:19] a destination the spirit life have a
[2:12:22] destination the destiny in the seed so
[2:12:25] when the seed is not ready yet the
[2:12:26] spirit can reach that the sprayer
[2:12:28] producing leaves vision flowers if we
[2:12:31] lose anticipation that but the
[2:12:33] destination a seed so when the world
[2:12:35] come is the seed so then I get locked up
[2:12:37] inside of you then you become the seed
[2:12:40] itself then the spirit is nowhere else
[2:12:42] locked up a seat form then all awaiting
[2:12:45] for Israel to produce your manifestation
[2:12:48] or give the Lord a show it's just come
[2:12:52] to pass afterwards that I will pour my
[2:12:54] spirit
[2:12:56] [Applause]
[2:13:04] let me continue here whatever Ana
[2:13:07] based on what I what shall I do which is
[2:13:11] called the Christ he's I'm gonna say
[2:13:13] something
[2:13:15] the mechanics there are so many people
[2:13:19] trying to explain the mechanics when you
[2:13:21] don't know it the only thing you know
[2:13:29] you should know the mechanics is known
[2:13:31] what is Moses he said somebody said
[2:13:34] action or I want to explain the
[2:13:36] mechanics of Holyoke flute he couldn't
[2:13:42] do it because no I'm self niversary
[2:13:45] his revelation of ability Ark was the
[2:13:48] act
[2:13:49] rain was the promise so that was the
[2:13:52] promise but he couldn't explain to
[2:13:54] anybody how this big big big bill with
[2:13:57] three stories who all anonymous is that
[2:13:59] green and flute he couldn't make Spain
[2:14:03] he can I would he use the belly acquit
[2:14:05] was a software called battle some would
[2:14:07] because God was will give up for the
[2:14:09] revelation but if Noah's argumentative
[2:14:13] Annie Annie get him Anna Gary revelation
[2:14:15] of the wood softwood God this cabbie
[2:14:18] right this wood will sink this is good
[2:14:21] for wood while I'm holes and porous God
[2:14:23] doesn't give any whole thing
[2:14:24] he is make you sweat it out
[2:14:28] so Noah had to believe this seems
[2:14:30] softwood that will sink in normal water
[2:14:33] and he watching me sinking and God tell
[2:14:36] me the ability ordered this if God said
[2:14:39] so I doing it yet because God make him
[2:14:42] sweat it out to believe it is God
[2:14:45] concerning that word because later on a
[2:14:47] further revelation to pitch it dies why
[2:14:50] go tell him that word because the pitch
[2:14:52] gonna sit inside and outside and make it
[2:14:55] waterproof if he are use a different
[2:15:00] kind of wood
[2:15:01] it couldn't have the absorption the way
[2:15:03] the pitch was going to absorb so water
[2:15:06] no fool he's a function of intelligence
[2:15:08] he know exactly what he's doing
[2:15:10] she's gonna make the wood waterproof by
[2:15:13] taking a sort of wood that is absorbent
[2:15:16] and pitched on the inside and pitches on
[2:15:19] the outside and God taking you a sauce
[2:15:21] wood that the devil have been building
[2:15:23] up building up building up for taking
[2:15:26] you and go Vasily on the inside I'm
[2:15:29] silly OSHA nobody gonna proof
[2:15:34] team on proof get proof or glory no good
[2:15:40] you're on your way to the rapture
[2:15:42] [Applause]
[2:15:51] maybe season hallelujah Oh glory to God
[2:15:55] you don't have to know the mechanics
[2:15:58] just the dynamics of it the dynamics is
[2:16:01] what you want to know
[2:16:02] no listen to this this emphasis we put
[2:16:05] here on this quote couldn't be said in
[2:16:08] the time of the revelation of these
[2:16:10] things being made known because dynamics
[2:16:14] that come out the season you have grown
[2:16:17] you know so in the qualifier a rain rain
[2:16:19] and all them palpable and picker and all
[2:16:23] ambush within say yes and even if that
[2:16:28] rainfall is bush you got the cotton is
[2:16:30] low on grass and but in class on our
[2:16:32] machine you know yeah this isn't in yet
[2:16:35] sorry word was lost so there was no see
[2:16:38] to come back luta Wesley Pentecost
[2:16:42] Yakima prophet angels come not to gather
[2:16:45] all the scattered wood to bring the seed
[2:16:48] of the entire Bible so he came with the
[2:16:50] entire sea of the tyre Bible put it a
[2:16:53] seven seals seven thunders to it in the
[2:16:55] book hallelujah and said go and take the
[2:16:59] book eat the book let that book come
[2:17:01] inside of you then you have see-through
[2:17:03] feasts i prophesy about that rain
[2:17:05] prophesy bo dynamics we have enough for
[2:17:07] years and people laugh and mock us they
[2:17:10] think they have it already and they have
[2:17:11] no power no 190 no witness no
[2:17:13] vindication not just not only have these
[2:17:16] books and tapes and mote you know why
[2:17:23] the doors were shut to me ever anybody
[2:17:26] knows
[2:17:27] because they were afraid you see that
[2:17:30] word afraid is a free you don't have
[2:17:34] stand that afraid but when you're
[2:17:36] frightened
[2:17:37] Peter name was frightened because she's
[2:17:40] not around because Jesus could come
[2:17:43] I'm not use coming again this see him
[2:17:45] where he's he's gone now he said wheat
[2:17:48] on the promise of my father
[2:17:51] wait in the city of Jerusalem until you
[2:17:54] be endued with power from on high
[2:17:57] they were looking for it that was the
[2:18:00] Alpha what about you Omega Church
[2:18:03] what you looking for some man to come
[2:18:05] and explain your voice and a prophet
[2:18:07] some man to explain you some more
[2:18:09] mysteries no we're looking for power
[2:18:12] from on high
[2:18:13] it has to come upon the word right isn't
[2:18:19] that right so no just the dynamics of it
[2:18:23] no watch Moses Moses couldn't explain
[2:18:26] watch tell me explain to me how you made
[2:18:29] flies come upon the earth Moses couldn't
[2:18:31] explain it you don't have to know you
[2:18:33] make the east bank on blowhole to the
[2:18:34] Red Sea and we follow on dry ground
[2:18:36] explain the mechanics of that tell me in
[2:18:39] the scientific research and what but he
[2:18:40] didn't know it he didn't know the
[2:18:42] mechanic he just other than an annex and
[2:18:43] that's the way I can't explain it I
[2:18:45] don't know the mechanics it's the
[2:18:47] dynamics and then he said no you don't
[2:18:50] know you don't
[2:18:51] there we go you don't have to know the
[2:18:54] mechanics you know the dynamics the
[2:18:56] things that pulse hits it that makes it
[2:18:59] true and see it hits a target so after
[2:19:02] all these years you come to the one our
[2:19:05] Gentile worker that just come in last

[2:26:50] then Mary

[2:26:53] carrier see so that was a revolution she
[2:26:56] cannot do it no he said watch he's a
[2:26:59] tree woman was the type of church's
[2:27:01] means treating emotional agents carriers
[2:27:03] which must drive up and down chat either
[2:27:05] shop and go forth and give room for the
[2:27:07] seed the seed can I get right until the
[2:27:10] shock stalk leaves all dry so when we
[2:27:14] come to see time to meet everything as a
[2:27:16] trial and it sucks every bit of the life
[2:27:19] in them out of it so it's all that was
[2:27:23] plus you say I kind of do it now it's
[2:27:26] each time or brighten the shocks are
[2:27:29] dead the shocks are dried up it's
[2:27:31] friggin wood time not touched
[2:27:33] it's a virgin virgin wood time put your
[2:27:36] hands is no mention hands on it it won't
[2:27:38] be a virgin not touch once the carrier
[2:27:41] of a true word justification it become a
[2:27:43] Kairos sonification if he can't have the
[2:27:45] bath only goes restoration of the gifts
[2:27:47] but then when he goes on and keeps going
[2:27:49] on what a genuine eagle knows the day I
[2:27:51] know it's alright she is no i dry shock
[2:27:54] here we go it is fast the Spirit of God
[2:27:57] passed through her is true and will not
[2:27:59] she will not be heir with the vindicated
[2:28:02] seed world people that win you to the
[2:28:06] Lord surrender not leave my wrong no God
[2:28:08] use them to bring you to Christ and some
[2:28:12] of them back sitting somebody I'm not
[2:28:13] even serving Lord Lord and God use them
[2:28:15] in that time
[2:28:17] life passed through them but you were
[2:28:20] seeded that's big that's big that's a
[2:28:26] big one that's a big one
[2:28:29] people let's call you and bring you to
[2:28:31] Christ I'm I never get my wrong
[2:28:33] some of them not even saved at the back
[2:28:35] seat or anything else but you are still
[2:28:37] here God will use anybody to get to the
[2:28:47] seed but once a seed Prince's come to
[2:28:50] see that you a seat and it's bright time
[2:28:54] glory degausser the seed will not be
[2:28:57] able to shock what she will not be in
[2:29:00] the rapture she will be at each member
[2:29:03] may come up in the second resurrection
[2:29:04] and be judged according to what she's
[2:29:06] heard so the church members that is what
[2:29:09] that represents but the seed is for the
[2:29:12] rapture see this for what the rapture
[2:29:15] and Baram say we live to Luther age
[2:29:17] Wesley age Pentecostal age and each age
[2:29:20] is given a promise of the world and the
[2:29:21] people of that age that manifests that
[2:29:24] word are the seed of the age the
[2:29:27] manifestation of the Holy Spirit operate
[2:29:29] and to his children is those seed of the
[2:29:31] kingdom so watch the seed of the word
[2:29:34] right when the word coming to you and
[2:29:36] become operated by the spirit because
[2:29:39] I'm manifestation of the Holy Spirit
[2:29:40] that makes you the seeded not somebody
[2:29:43] taught in a Bible or spoken word books
[2:29:44] okay the Lord a shout when court convert
[2:29:48] the seed into you and becomes the life
[2:29:50] it becomes a color so the devil here you
[2:29:54] hear in word but when that would become
[2:29:56] into a color a rainbow flashing so when
[2:29:58] you walk the streets and children are is
[2:30:00] rainbow flashes every devil in hell see
[2:30:03] light flashing from you red orange
[2:30:10] hallelujah glory of God do you see it
[2:30:17] now if you understand that you would
[2:30:20] want to know how you walk how you talk
[2:30:23] how you live how you're acting because
[2:30:26] you have to be understand your life
[2:30:28] becomes a witness Peter was saying we
[2:30:31] are witnesses of these things he was
[2:30:33] telling on us he was not here you didn't
[2:30:35] see Jesus walk you didn't see Jesus talk
[2:30:37] here we have to give a testimony of what
[2:30:40] Jesus did we are witnesses of these
[2:30:42] things and why he was speaking the Holy
[2:30:44] Spirit or glory to God cell upon them to
[2:30:47] confirm what he was saying was the truth
[2:30:57] talk about a son how to be qualified to
[2:31:00] dignify this please but if he was
[2:31:02] qualified into the father's place then
[2:31:04] all the father had was going to the son
[2:31:06] now watch he's not talking about the son
[2:31:09] born he don't matter son qualified
[2:31:12] that's not the same we're not talking
[2:31:14] about son born because I rascal sunroofs
[2:31:17] on difficult son hadn't son when he gets
[2:31:19] on or it's awesome sons but all kind but
[2:31:23] he's talking about the qualified son he
[2:31:25] said watch and watch and there is way I
[2:31:27] think many of us Pentecostal people has
[2:31:30] made a mistake we think as soon as we
[2:31:32] come sons and daughters of God
[2:31:34] that's visit we just come into a place
[2:31:36] of trial so he was saying that the birth
[2:31:39] of the Holy Ghost gives you a door to be
[2:31:44] tested and tried to come forward into
[2:31:46] spiritual maturity that court could
[2:31:49] approve your life this has nothing to do
[2:31:54] with reading books and listen to tapes
[2:31:56] this is something different you don't
[2:31:59] get test reading a book unless in some
[2:32:03] school taking some exams you look at
[2:32:06] tests listen isn't it
[2:32:07] I say listen to the tape I'll say read
[2:32:10] the books when you go outside you can't
[2:32:12] test or where you read and what you're
[2:32:14] here could you give the Lord a shout
[2:32:18] I never good some good news for you God
[2:32:21] is not a ducting administer because of
[2:32:23] his sermon did you want to see him
[2:32:27] another one I thought you might be
[2:32:28] choking on that one yeah
[2:32:29] so don't bother about him I put together
[2:32:32] holy now he said what is nice just part
[2:32:34] of it for you hear the word it still
[2:32:36] come down to the life can begin good I
[2:32:46] want to wrap up he said no talking about
[2:32:49] just one Caleb he said Joshua study and
[2:32:51] said God give it to us what we are well
[2:32:53] able to take it he said why why what was
[2:32:55] it he just won't kill them they were
[2:32:58] positionally born in Christ so he's
[2:33:00] bringing it present tense the other
[2:33:02] knowledge of the word and the word
[2:33:05] become manifested remember every one of
[2:33:08] those Israelites had the would preach to
[2:33:09] them but it only take me effect upon
[2:33:12] Caleb and Joshua to realize what it was
[2:33:15] all about so that is when you find your
[2:33:18] channel that's when you find your place
[2:33:19] when your opinion don't realize what
[2:33:21] it's all about you find your position in
[2:33:22] Christ it's effective to you then in
[2:33:26] other words it's inspired to you even
[2:33:28] inspired to you nobody at the back at
[2:33:30] the workshop and nobody abeggar keep
[2:33:32] your eyes open go down wash your face

[2:33:43] it inspire to you you will ship and go
[2:33:45] to one to worship the worship and
[2:33:46] because you know you have a part to play
[2:33:48] and create any atmosphere that supposed
[2:33:50] to hear you talking about Josh suave not
[2:33:58] knowing bye-bye inspirational letter the
[2:34:00] Holy Spirit being into the promised land
[2:34:02] give each man according to what was
[2:34:04] punished by the please just replaced and
[2:34:07] positionally in the land what a minor
[2:34:09] grown in butenes
[2:34:10] I said when I was grown in she was
[2:34:12] naming them Ephraim manna said and they
[2:34:16] have a place in the land when they cross
[2:34:18] over into the land or chlorine accord
[2:34:20] the beans grown in placing them
[2:34:23] positionally so when the cross over they
[2:34:26] have land they even come to yet or
[2:34:28] chlorine are caught by the land

[2:34:51] church true yeah

[2:35:32] God then he said they get tremendous
[2:35:34] sometimes what tremendous labor pains
[2:35:37] then he said when a church like our
[2:35:40] church it is groaning under the
[2:35:43] persecution of the outside world which
[2:35:45] is the message world believe in our Lord
[2:35:47] Jesus that the promise of the Holy Ghost
[2:35:51] is just as real to us as it was the
[2:35:55] Pentecost how they grow and cry under
[2:36:00] labor pains but when they are born and
[2:36:03] positionally born into the kingdom of

[2:44:04] continue
[2:44:08] [Applause]
[2:44:16] my god I'm enjoying the word this
[2:44:18] morning I hope you enjoy it like me but
[2:44:22] this one is important this is from this
[2:44:24] edition shhh but mom said it this way to
[2:44:28] understand this subject even more
[2:44:31] clearly it will no have to be wise
[2:44:34] approach to so it's why I put it on the
[2:44:38] standpoint of the church to the ages up
[2:44:41] until now we have been thinking in terms
[2:44:43] of the removal of the names of
[2:44:45] individuals but now we want to consider
[2:44:48] not the individuals but the groups
[2:44:50] represented in the church to do so we
[2:44:54] were liking the church through the ages
[2:44:56] to the week plant a grain of wheat is
[2:44:58] planted to the end that a single grain
[2:45:00] of wheat will reproduce and multiply
[2:45:04] itself through a certain process during
[2:45:06] a certain period of time that single
[2:45:08] seed will die but in dying the life that
[2:45:11] was in it will come up into a plant
[2:45:13] which will in turn be the bearer or the
[2:45:15] carrier of that life which will come
[2:45:17] back to the originality in
[2:45:19] multi-platform Jesus the great royal she
[2:45:23] died the mattress one who is the life of
[2:45:26] the church stands in a myth of the
[2:45:28] church for seven two teaches given his
[2:45:30] life to the church the carrier or the
[2:45:32] bearer to the end the purpose that his
[2:45:35] very life will be represented his in the
[2:45:41] resurrection it is at the resurrection
[2:45:43] that the royal seed will see many royal
[2:45:45] seeds like unto himself and there will
[2:45:48] be even as he is for John said we shall
[2:45:50] see him like him
[2:45:51] that is what John the Baptist are
[2:45:53] referring to when he said Jesus will
[2:45:55] gather the wheat into the Ghana that was
[2:45:56] the resurrection when the redeemed who
[2:45:59] had been elected and eternal life came
[2:46:01] in now then the record of this wheat
[2:46:05] plant whose end is to reproduce the
[2:46:08] original seed in multiplied form is the
[2:46:12] book of life
[2:46:15] so Balram converted now we plant and he
[2:46:18] converted into the book of life I repeat
[2:46:22] the history or the record of this wheat
[2:46:26] planet is the book of life of which a
[2:46:30] part of the book of life is the record
[2:46:33] of eternal life a section in the book of
[2:46:36] life because the book of life reads
[2:46:38] chords all life that comes on the earth
[2:46:40] but in that book of life have a section
[2:46:43] which is the eternal section which is
[2:46:45] where you have your name all life is in
[2:46:51] the book but in that section have a
[2:46:53] eternal section which God put your name
[2:46:55] in there that section cannot be removed
[2:46:58] under no circumstance III wanted a
[2:47:06] bigger even than that in that section of
[2:47:08] that book under no circumstance those
[2:47:11] names could be removed because that
[2:47:13] section have the eternal thoughts of God
[2:47:15] which is just as real even though not
[2:47:18] yet expressed did you hear that that
[2:47:28] section have the eternal thoughts of God
[2:47:31] which is just as real even not yet
[2:47:34] expressed because the words are not
[2:47:37] expressed but the thought of God is just
[2:47:39] as real as the expression of the soul
[2:47:46] let's continue this is convincingly seen
[2:47:50] by examining the we plant a bear see the
[2:47:54] Tsun Tsun ablated seen but that is not
[2:47:58] to beat yet it grows into a stalk that
[2:48:01] is not yet written life is dear but not
[2:48:04] beaten at the end of the stalk is a
[2:48:06] spike that sends out a tassel still a
[2:48:10] wheat plant but no bit yet then the
[2:48:12] plant is pollen iced we see this just
[2:48:14] grow this looks like the wheat but is
[2:48:17] not yet seed then it forms the wheat in
[2:48:20] the husk it is no back to what it was
[2:48:22] originally
[2:48:23] no the ripened wheat is harvested
[2:48:27] Jesus Christ died he give his life that
[2:48:30] life was to come back upon the church
[2:48:32] and bring many sons like unto himself
[2:48:35] into the glory resurrection but as the
[2:48:38] wheat seed had to have a carrier to
[2:48:40] bring forth multiplied with seed even
[2:48:43] sure it had to be a church which will be
[2:48:45] a carrier of the life of Christ as the
[2:48:49] blade stalk Teslin husk where the
[2:48:52] carriers for the seed was not the seed
[2:48:54] itself so the church cooperate to the
[2:48:57] ages has been a carrier of the to seal
[2:48:59] don't not to seed itself that is why we
[2:49:03] can see that the book of life is the
[2:49:05] whole wheat plant the book of life is
[2:49:10] the whole wheat plant including the
[2:49:13] carriers including the process in which
[2:49:15] as life grows truth or glory to God
[2:49:18] let's go over it again here is the
[2:49:21] original seed that was planted it
[2:49:22] producer plead that wasn't it if it is a
[2:49:25] stalk not it either
[2:49:27] here come the husk in which the reaches
[2:49:28] the form that isn't it the tassel
[2:49:30] appears the pollen fall on those pistols
[2:49:32] part of the plant is quickened something
[2:49:35] of the original seed came to the rest of
[2:49:37] the plant turns into seed why I didn't
[2:49:39] hold not going to seed because it was
[2:49:42] created to that end that just part of
[2:49:44] the plant can't go back to being seed
[2:49:48] are you writing with me are you with me
[2:49:51] okay so let's go because it was created
[2:49:55] at end just part of the plant can go
[2:49:56] back to that being see know what just
[2:50:00] part of that plant can go back to being
[2:50:02] seed because just part of that wheat
[2:50:04] plant is eternal life wheat you have a
[2:50:10] perfect type here we go of all Israel
[2:50:12] Eve in Egypt they all came out two
[2:50:14] million strong always skip to the
[2:50:16] sacrificial blood all were baptized in
[2:50:17] the Red Sea all came out of the water
[2:50:19] into an holy spirit manifestation and
[2:50:21] blessed all it angel food would not
[2:50:23] carriers but but carriers for the
[2:50:26] children who would which should follow
[2:50:27] them and go to Canaan land but all
[2:50:29] Israel is not Israel all but a tiny
[2:50:33] minority had their names blotted out of
[2:50:34] the book of life and we are the same
[2:50:36] right today in the church
[2:50:37] names
[2:50:38] we blow the book of life no names will
[2:50:41] be blotted out of the book of eternal
[2:50:43] life for that is another record tour
[2:50:46] contained in the book of life this is
[2:50:48] the record that God had given us eternal
[2:50:50] rights and that life is in his son he
[2:50:54] that hath the son hath the life he that
[2:51:02] hath not the son hath not life and all
[2:51:04] through the Orion I feeling strong like
[2:51:11] an ox worried I do one for tomorrow
[2:51:16] I just hope you could write in this
[2:51:18] pyramid I'm not going to be tomorrow
[2:51:20] go tell you one thing but this is the
[2:51:23] record right what he that hath not the
[2:51:24] son hath not life no disappear Monica -
[2:51:27] and those who have that life were in him
[2:51:31] before the foundation of the world
[2:51:37] are you ready they were chosen in him
[2:51:43] before the foundation of the world that
[2:51:46] great royal seed Jesus Christ was
[2:51:49] planted that life that was in him came
[2:51:54] to the wheat plant and is reproducing
[2:51:59] itself in modules of wheat seeds
[2:52:01] having the same life in them and being
[2:52:05] like the original because and there's
[2:52:08] the power I wanna get to by spirit they
[2:52:11] are original
[2:52:15] not let up not word but by spirit quad
[2:52:22] converted the spirit to identify the
[2:52:24] original seed revelation 22:17 the
[2:52:29] spirit and the bride will see come or
[2:52:34] glory to God hallelujah glory to God
[2:52:39] hallelujah oh my oh my oh praise God

[2:52:50] more mother churches what because and
[2:52:54] they say I get the inspiration from
[2:52:55] after the shock there is no more nothing
[2:53:00] left but the green is that right it's
[2:53:03] got to be the green it's got to be the
[2:53:06] same kind that went to the ground
[2:53:08] Jesus Christ the same yesterday then
[2:53:10] forever then he said his spirit come
[2:53:13] upon the bride to do the same thing he
[2:53:16] did see is the repetition again of the
[2:53:19] cream doctors where get the title from
[2:53:23] taxes where get a title from the spirit
[2:53:26] coming upon the bride to be the same
[2:53:29] thing what is it our repetition of the
[2:53:32] green and you are green by spirit you
[2:53:35] are green by original original spirit or
[2:53:39] glory to God my god let me see the
[2:53:42] control of here oh my mission coming

[2:53:52] Gordy sinner he was perfect what is
[2:53:56] confusion you know he was perfect love
[2:53:58] perfect peace perfect joy perfect
[2:54:00] certification perfect satisfaction all
[2:54:02] those seven spirits as we get in
[2:54:05] revelation did make up God say said God
[2:54:10] when you flip it and converted seven
[2:54:13] spirits make up God let's continue and
[2:54:18] the camera of God okay all those seven
[2:54:22] spirits made of God was perfection and
[2:54:28] everything else outside of that has been
[2:54:30] something profited from that you said
[2:54:34] with me and the only way we could come
[2:54:37] back to the perfection is to come out
[2:54:38] that that perfection so he's saying the
[2:54:41] only way that from the perfection is to
[2:54:42] come back to seven spirits not mysteries
[2:54:48] the mystery of the convert the spirit
[2:54:52] and that is the perfection
[2:54:55] now watch tree is perfection their
[2:54:58] ministry comes his perfection when it
[2:55:01] represent a natural among human being oh
[2:55:05] my so you have got to get a connection
[2:55:09] to Christ friends and hear what he said
[2:55:12] you know he said you know he said when
[2:55:15] they come to Christ you said lord if he
[2:55:17] will receive me to your kingdom I
[2:55:18] promise there you are
[2:55:19] I would love you I'll be true to you I
[2:55:21] will serve you day and night
[2:55:23] it's too bad we forget that I was so few
[2:55:25] denied I will fast I will pray I'll be
[2:55:28] loyal to you I'll bring my Titans into
[2:55:30] the storehouse I will pray many times a
[2:55:32] day I will do anything I'll place my
[2:55:35] love to you that's what you should do
[2:55:37] that's exactly right well you promised
[2:55:38] that it should come from your heart if
[2:55:40] you promise your husband that enough of
[2:55:42] your heart you mean that it's not living
[2:55:45] correctly with him look here if you
[2:55:47] haven't got teeth and you use false
[2:55:49] teeth no that is all right it is
[2:55:51] substituting for the teeth you once had
[2:55:53] and actually those teeth are not
[2:55:56] connected with you it's not part of you
[2:55:59] if your arm is amputated and you put on
[2:56:01] a force arm the arm is actually not
[2:56:03] connected with you it's just stuck on to
[2:56:06] you it is not connected and when we give
[2:56:09] our pleasure to Christ and we don't
[2:56:11] become part of him like I won't become
[2:56:13] part of a man then we become artificial
[2:56:15] Christians
[2:56:21] that's the way the churches are too many
[2:56:24] today we are just taking the name of
[2:56:25] Christian Church pretending to be the
[2:56:27] bride when it is artificially we are not
[2:56:30] connected with Christ in any way we are
[2:56:33] like an artificial put artificial arm
[2:56:35] artificial eye
[2:56:37] we are artificially putting it on so you
[2:56:40] want to want a connection you're
[2:56:43] connected to the source go glory to God
[2:56:46] hallelujah you don't want to be
[2:56:48] connecting you want to be connected what
[2:56:56] Obama says is she become part of Christ
[2:56:58] when she does that
[2:56:59] she injects it into own life in his own
[2:57:02] life and the Bible said to Adam and Eve
[2:57:04] you are no longer two but one and when a
[2:57:06] woman a church is mighty Christ they are
[2:57:08] no longer two there one Christ in you
[2:57:09] his life has been brought into you and
[2:57:13] you become the bride Oh glory to God the
[2:57:17] whole creation is written for the
[2:57:18] manifestation what is the manifestation
[2:57:20] making known waiting for the
[2:57:22] manifestation sons of God to the speedom
[2:57:24] to the church to display them to the

[2:57:31] days with the power of the Holy Ghost to
[2:57:33] the end of the age to reveal the secret
[2:57:35] things on the functionable to bring it
[2:57:36] up this is the day of the manifestation
[2:57:39] sons of God when the mysteries that have
[2:57:41] been hid from the fallen world
[2:57:43] history made known and that made known
[2:57:46] as not as my revelation is made known by
[2:57:48] manifestation because Christ is making
[2:57:51] known God Christ is the mystery of God
[2:57:54] revealed Oh hallelujah he said tell me
[2:57:57] it had to wait all this time now all
[2:57:59] thing I mean brought up come and shaping
[2:58:00] up to a headstone to the manifestation
[2:58:02] the sons of God come when when God's
[2:58:05] when the Spirit of God commented these
[2:58:06] men so perfectly until their ministry
[2:58:10] will be so close like Christ and this is
[2:58:12] what some of the ministers don't
[2:58:13] understand that is not their ministry
[2:58:15] suppose see is Christ's ministry have to
[2:58:18] come into them

[3:31:14] who were so instrumental in ensuring the
[3:31:19] success of the convention and many were
[3:31:22] visible and we saw what they did and
[3:31:25] there were also many who were operating
[3:31:28] behind the scenes so we want to once
[3:31:30] again express our appreciation you
[3:31:32] appreciate all those who really came
[3:31:34] together especially we have an
[3:31:42] invitation and we'll have a few
[3:31:43] invitations that we'll announce but we
[3:31:46] do have one but we kind of need to get
[3:31:48] some indication of little flock
[3:31:52] Tabernacle where the artist Church
[3:31:54] they're having a play a drama play
[3:31:58] around the theme that guy and I've been
[3:32:01] to one of their plays before really
[3:32:03] really a wonderful production that they
[3:32:05] would do and it'll be held at the
[3:32:07] southern Academy of Performing Arts on
[3:32:09] September the 24th but space would be
[3:32:14] limited they will be inviting the
[3:32:16] churches in a message to attend so what
[3:32:19] we would need to provide for them would
[3:32:21] be
[3:32:23] I guess a count of those who would be
[3:32:26] interested so they can kind of see how
[3:32:27] many seats you're working with they are
[3:32:29] looking for a contribution of $100 we
[3:32:31] listen to cover the cost of rent in Sapa
[3:32:34] and putting on a production as well so
[3:32:36] if you are interested in attending this
[3:32:40] plea honor and the guide is drama on on
[3:32:43] September the 24th
[3:32:46] feel free to contact me on this because
[3:32:49] I'll be compiling the list to laser it
[3:32:51] but I thought on this so again the
[3:32:55] contribution will just be a hundred
[3:32:56] dollars and it is a wonderful time and
[3:33:00] we'd love to have believers go down
[3:33:04] there and participate in that I believe
