[44:46] This is
[44:48] my [music and singing] soul.
[44:53] Praise
[44:55] my sing. [music]
[45:01] [music]
[45:05] Can we give him a hand of praise this
[45:07] morning?
[45:10] Blessed be the name of the Lord. Father,
[45:13] [music] we love you. Father, we worship
[45:14] you. Father, we praise you. We give you
[45:17] glory. [music] We give you honor. We
[45:19] give you thanksgiving. From the rising
[45:21] of the sun to the going down of the
[45:23] same, your name is worthy to be praised.
[45:26] If we had 2,000 [music] tongs, it would
[45:28] not be enough to praise you. Hallelujah.
[45:31] If we write it, it will not be enough to
[45:33] praise you. If we tell people about it,
[45:36] it will be not enough to praise you,
[45:39] Lord. It will never be enough to praise
[45:41] you, Lord, [music] for your goodness
[45:46] and your mercy.
[45:49] [music] Shall we pray?
[45:51] Our gracious heavenly father, we thank
[45:53] you this morning, Lord, that we can be
[45:55] in your presence one more time.
[45:59] Lord, we don't deserve any blessing.
[46:04] Lord, there's no works, there's no
[46:06] effort, [music] there's nothing we could
[46:08] ever do to be qualified,
[46:11] Lord, for your grace and your mercy.
[46:14] We could look at our lives. We could
[46:16] look at our failures. We could look at
[46:18] our mistakes.
[46:20] And when we weigh them against the good
[46:22] that we could ever do, Lord, the good
[46:25] will always be outweighed [music] by the
[46:27] carnal nature.
[46:29] But Lord, you put provision to take care
[46:32] of [music] that through your blood.
[46:34] That when you look to us, you look
[46:37] through the blood and the blood speaks
[46:40] on our behalf. So Lord, our sins don't
[46:43] speak. Our mistakes don't speak. Our
[46:46] failures don't speak. What we did
[46:48] yesterday doesn't speak. But the blood
[46:50] speaks better for us. It translates. It
[46:54] covers. It takes care of the issues and
[46:57] gives a good report for us when we bring
[46:59] our issues under the blood.
[47:03] Lord, as we stand on this sacred ground
[47:05] this morning, Lord, not because this
[47:08] building is holy, but because a holy God
[47:10] is in this place, because you inhabit
[47:12] the praises of your people. And [music]
[47:14] Lord, you promise to be there where they
[47:15] are two or three gathered in your name,
[47:18] you promise to step into the midst of
[47:20] that. And we dwell in the midst of that.
[47:22] And you said when the praises would go
[47:24] up, the glory of God would come down.
[47:26] It's not our effort. It's not our works,
[47:28] but it's by your design, Father. And if
[47:31] there's one thing you are subject to
[47:33] [music] is your own law, Father. And
[47:35] your law made provision for us that if
[47:37] we come to this blood, we could come
[47:39] into your presence through the blood.
[47:41] [music] And we can make requests. We can
[47:42] make petitions. We could ask what we
[47:44] will and it shall be done this morning,
[47:46] Father. Lord, for this portion of the
[47:49] bride of Jesus Christ that's gathered,
[47:51] Lord, in this physical location and even
[47:53] online, Father, we [music] submit to
[47:55] your leadership. We submit to your
[47:57] authority. We submit to your word as
[48:00] presented through the scripture and
[48:01] opened by your prophet messenger even a
[48:04] star in the right hand of God. Father
[48:06] Lord, may you take me out of the way.
[48:08] May my thoughts be nothing. May my words
[48:10] be nothing and may only what you once
[48:12] said be said. May only what you want
[48:14] done be done this morning. [music] May
[48:16] you bless the reading of the word and
[48:18] bless the hearing of it and the opening
[48:20] of our understanding. May you bless
[48:22] those that are here, those that are
[48:23] connected online. We are so grateful for
[48:25] your presence this morning in the
[48:27] precious name of Jesus Christ. Before we
[48:29] read the scripture, let's just sing that
[48:31] song.
[48:37] Elohim
[48:41] Lord, [music] we [singing] long
[48:44] to
[48:47] ship [music] you.
[48:49] Tell
[48:51] [music and singing]
[48:57] me
[49:00] how [music and singing] we want to
[49:02] worship
[49:05] you. [music] One more time. [singing]
[49:07] Hallelujah.
[49:11] Hello. Hallelujah. [music and singing]
[49:16] Hallelujah.
[49:20] I worship you.
[49:24] [music]
[49:30] Hello. [singing]
[49:33] [music]
[49:35] Oh, [singing] we long
[49:41] [music]
[49:44] Lord. We come to you. [music]
[49:48] It [singing] works. No matter what the
[49:51] circumstance,
[49:58] [music] no matter what the situation, no
[50:01] matter [singing] what the city [music]
[50:06] you
[50:11] [music] will lift up
[50:16] all over the building, lift your voices.
[50:19] Lift them up. Hallelujah. Oh,
[50:24] [singing]
[50:24] [music]
[50:26] hello.
[50:28] Hello.
[50:30] Oh, how we love to worship you. How we
[50:34] love to praise you. [music]
[50:38] Oh. [singing]
[50:44] [music]
[50:45] Hello.
[50:49] [music]
[50:49] [singing] How we long to worship
[50:54] you. [music]
[50:58] How we long
[51:00] to worship
[51:03] you. [music]
[51:05] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[51:09] Hallelujah. You love him this morning.
[51:11] [music]
[51:14] Amen. While you're standing, if you have
[51:16] your Bibles, we'll just read one portion
[51:19] of scripture now. Later on, we'll touch
[51:21] another. But let's read from St. Luke
[51:23] 14. I'd like to welcome one and all in
[51:26] the presence of the Lord this morning.
[51:28] St. Luke 14 and reading from verse 16, a
[51:31] familiar scripture. And we'll touch this
[51:33] context and then later on we'll go into
[51:36] Matthew 22. But St. Luke 14:E 16. Then
[51:42] said he unto him.
[51:45] A certain man made a great supper, and
[51:48] bade many,
[51:50] and sent his servant at supper time to
[51:53] say to them that were bidden, "Come,
[51:56] for all things are now ready."
[52:00] And they all with one consent began to
[52:02] make excuse.
[52:04] The first said unto him, I have bought a
[52:07] piece of ground and I must need go and
[52:10] see it.
[52:12] I pray thee, have me excused.
[52:15] And another said, I have bought five
[52:17] yolk of oxen and I go to prove them. I
[52:21] pray thee,
[52:23] have me excused.
[52:25] And another said, I have married a wife
[52:29] and therefore I cannot come.
[52:32] So that servant came and showed his lord
[52:34] these things. Then the master of the
[52:37] house being angry said to his servant,
[52:39] "Go out quickly into the streets and
[52:42] lanes of the city and bring in hither
[52:46] the poor and the maimed and the halt and
[52:48] the blind." And the servant said, "Lord,
[52:50] it is done as thou hast commanded, and
[52:53] yet there is room." And the Lord said
[52:55] unto the servant, "Go out into the
[52:57] highways and hedges, and compel them to
[53:00] come in that my house may be filled. For
[53:03] I say unto you that none of these men
[53:05] which were bidden shall taste of my
[53:08] supper." May the Lord add a blessing to
[53:09] the reading of his holy word. You may be
[53:11] seated in the presence of the Lord this
[53:13] morning. And for a title for our time in
[53:18] the presence of the Lord this morning,
[53:20] do not reject his invitation. Amen.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; Do not reject his invitation.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; Before I go further, I have two notes of
[53:32] praise just to uh bring the church into
[53:36] a certain context from Sister Donna K.
[53:39] Clark. My mom would like to thank God
[53:42] for his continued grace and mercy over
[53:44] her life. For the past few weeks, she
[53:46] had been experience
[53:48] experiencing sincere gastrointestinal
[53:51] issues and was unable to eat and has
[53:53] lost significant weight. But I continue
[53:55] to praise his holy name. He has blessed
[53:57] me to see another year and she's now 84
[54:01] years old and I could say by God's grace
[54:03] I'm feeling much better. Uh today thanks
[54:06] and blessings also to all the saints
[54:08] with their prayers. Thanks from Sister
[54:09] Donna K. Clark on behalf of her mother.
[54:11] So we thank God for that.
[54:14] And from Sister Phoebe Granville, I want
[54:16] to thank God. I want to give God the
[54:18] highest note of praise for his healing
[54:19] touch. I had been dealing with a medical
[54:21] issue. It was not improving despite
[54:23] medication. In October, I was referred
[54:26] to a specialist who recommended surgery.
[54:28] The elders prayed for me after service
[54:30] and about two weeks afterwards, I
[54:32] observed that the symptoms had stopped.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; The surgery which was scheduled for last
[54:36] week was cancelled. All thanks and
[54:39] praise to my Lord and Savior G.
[54:42] Hallelujah.
[54:44] [applause]
[54:44] Glory.
[54:47] Jehovah Rafa. May his name be exalted
[54:49] forever and ever. This is a tremendous
[54:51] testimony. We are looking for more
[54:53] cancellation of surgeries. We are
[54:55] looking for doctors to be confused. Do
[54:58] you know that we are called to confuse
[54:59] the doctors
[55:00] &gt;&gt; because when the great physician does
[55:02] work on you, you don't need a doctor.
[55:05] &gt;&gt; And we know the great physician is
[55:06] always here. He is looking to answer the
[55:08] prayers of the saints. But the one thing
[55:10] he looks for is that act of faith. And
[55:12] once faith is presented, then God can
[55:14] respond. Can the church say amen?
[55:16] Everybody feeling fine?
[55:18] &gt;&gt; Well, it's wonderful to be in the house
[55:20] of the Lord on Sunday morning. There's
[55:22] no better place to be. The psalmist
[55:24] David said, "I was glad when they said
[55:26] unto me, let us go into the house of the
[55:28] Lord." Hallelujah. So, it doesn't matter
[55:31] your trials, your testings, your
[55:33] failures, your mistakes, what went
[55:35] wrong, what you think, what you feel,
[55:37] because God is not looking at your
[55:38] emotion. He's done looking at your
[55:40] yesterday. He's done looking at how you
[55:42] even think or feel. He only looks at his
[55:44] word because he is only obligated to
[55:46] honor his word. That's the only thing he
[55:50] respects is his word. The Bible said HE
[55:52] IS NO RESPECTOR OF PERSON. So he doesn't
[55:54] even respect me. HE DOESN'T RESPECT THE
[55:56] PASTOR, BUT HE RESPECTS THE WORD. AND HE
[55:59] RESPECTS THE WORD IN you and I. AND WHEN
[56:01] HE SEES THAT WORD, HE GIVES HONOR TO THE
[56:03] WORD BECAUSE the word IS HIS HIMSELF.
[56:06] ANYBODY IN THE HOUSE THIS MORNING? Oh
[56:08] hallelujah. [cheering]
[56:10] And that's why the word seed in you is
[56:12] your identification. Your word seed in
[56:15] you is more important than your
[56:16] passport. IT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE
[56:18] ID CARD. THAT'S WHY WE COULD SAY WITH
[56:21] BOLDNESS YOU ARE NOT THE BELIEVER BUT
[56:23] the seed in you which is the word in
[56:25] seed form is the believer. AND THE
[56:27] ENVIRONMENT HAS TO BE RIGHT FOR THAT
[56:29] SEED to come to life. And once you put
[56:31] that seed in the right environment, it
[56:34] must only PRODUCE OR CAN ONLY PRODUCE OR
[56:37] WILL ONLY PRODUCE WHAT'S BUILT into the
[56:40] seed.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen?
[56:43] &gt;&gt; That's why God could say to THE
[56:45] DISCIPLES AFTER HE GAVE THEM POWER,
[56:48] DON'T REJOICE BECAUSE YOU HAVE POWER. We
[56:50] could pray for you this morning and SEE
[56:52] THE POWER WORK. AND THAT'S WONDERFUL.
[56:54] BUT THERE'S A GREATER REJOICING THAT'S
[56:56] ABOVE THE POWER. THAT REJOICING IS
[56:58] BECAUSE YOUR NAME IS WRITTEN. AND
[57:00] BECAUSE YOUR NAME IS WRITTEN, THAT IS
[57:02] YOUR IDENTIFICATION. BECAUSE YOUR NAME
[57:04] IS WRITTEN, YOU COULD LOOK AROUND YOUR
[57:06] SITUATION and say, "THOUGH THE SKIN
[57:08] WORMS DESTROY MY BODY, YET IN MY FLESH,
[57:11] I WILL SEE GOD. BECAUSE MY NAME IS
[57:14] WRITTEN, THERE'S A THEOPHONY FOR ME.
[57:16] BECAUSE MY NAME IS WRITTEN, I'M
[57:18] PREDESTINATED FOR A BODY CHANGE. I CAN
[57:22] LAY THIS FLESH DOWN AND I'LL PICK UP
[57:24] ANOTHER BODY BECAUSE THIS IS NOT WHO I
[57:26] AM.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[57:28] &gt;&gt; THIS HOUSE IS A HOUSE FOR MY
[57:30] IDENTIFICATION. THIS 16 ELEMENT IS A
[57:33] HOUSE WITH A SEED IN MY SOUL. And if
[57:35] your son has a seed in her in his soul,
[57:37] HE HAS GOT TO COME FORTH. IF YOUR
[57:39] DAUGHTER HAS A SEED IN HER SOUL, SHE HAS
[57:41] GOT TO COME FORTH. DON'T LET THE
[57:43] MINISKIRT OR THE CIGARETTE OR THE
[57:45] MARIJUANA OR THE BOYFRIEND OR THE
[57:47] GIRLFRIEND DISTRACT YOU FROM THE SEED
[57:50] THAT GOD PUT THERE. THAT SEED IS GOING
[57:53] TO COME TO LIFE.
[57:54] &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen?
[57:57] &gt;&gt; [cheering and applause]
[57:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:00] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to be too long with you
[58:02] today. I know I have to apologize. You
[58:04] know the pastor tell me don't say that.
[58:10] &gt;&gt; He said don't say you're going to be we
[58:13] come to church to have church.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; You want to say we we not going to be
[58:16] too long with you. You say don't don't
[58:18] say that. So I apologize.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; But we are here to have a time in the
[58:22] Lord.
[58:23] &gt;&gt; We're here to celebrate around his word.
[58:25] And man taught us we ought to be the
[58:27] happiest people
[58:29] &gt;&gt; on the face of the earth.
[58:31] &gt;&gt; Happiest people on the face of the
[58:33] earth. IT MEANS OUR HAPPINESS IS NOT
[58:35] TIED TO THE MONEY IN YOUR BANK. THE
[58:37] HAPPINESS IS NOT TIED TO YOUR JOB. THE
[58:39] HAPPINESS IS NOT TIED TO YOUR HOUSE. THE
[58:41] HAPPINESS IS NOT TIED TO YOUR CAR. IT'S
[58:43] HAPPINESS IN GOD.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HEAVEN AND EARTH WILL PASS AWAY.
[58:47] BUT THAT WORD CANNOT PASS AWAY. YOUR JOY
[58:50] MUST BE IN THE WORD. YOUR WORSHIP MUST
[58:53] BE IN THE WORD. [cheering]
[58:55] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[58:55] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. SO WE COME TO THE HOUSE of
[58:58] God [cheering]
[59:00] &gt;&gt; to see in the mirror of the word what we
[59:03] need to do to adjust because we are
[59:05] being dressed in the word. WE ARE BEING
[59:07] DRESSED BY THE WORD. WE ARE BEING
[59:09] PREPARED BY THE WORD BECAUSE ONCE THE
[59:11] WORD HAS BEEN FULLY RESTORED THEN THE
[59:13] FULLNESS OF THE SPIRIT can move because
[59:15] the WORD IS THE CONDUCTOR OF THE SPIRIT.
[59:17] THAT'S WHY WE ARE NOT A PENTECOSTAL
[59:19] CHURCH. AND WE THANK GOD FOR THE
[59:21] MINISTRY OF THAT ELIJAH PROPHET WHO
[59:23] WOULD TIE UP EVERY LOOSE END. Reveal the
[59:26] MYSTERY OF THE SEVEN THUNDERS. SHOW US
[59:28] HOW TO go [cheering]
[59:31] &gt;&gt; so we CAN STAND WITH CONFIDENCE.
[59:33] HALLELUJAH. I'M GOING TO THE RAPTURE.
[59:35] THIS IS NOT just words. THIS IS NOT JUST
[59:37] DECLARATION. IT'S A STATEMENT OF FACT.
[59:40] [cheering]
[59:41] &gt;&gt; OH, you don't hear me this morning. This
[59:43] is not positive affirmation, friends.
[59:46] This is not us SAYING SOMETHING TO FEEL
[59:47] GOOD ABOUT OURSELVES. WE ARE GOING to
[59:49] the rapture. IT'S A STATEMENT OF FACT
[59:52] THAT'S MORE REAL THAN THIS BUILDING WE
[59:54] ARE IN. BECAUSE THE WORDS THAT GOD SPOKE
[59:56] CREATED THINGS INTO EXISTENCE AND THE
[59:59] WORDS WE SPEAK, THE SPOKEN WORD IS THE
[1:00:01] ORIGINAL SEED. CAN THE church say amen?
[1:00:05] [applause and cheering]
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; So today is a special day. We would have
[1:00:14] spoken to the church some time ago and
[1:00:17] told them we want to put the young
[1:00:18] people to some work. There's some
[1:00:20] talented young people among us and we
[1:00:23] are learning more about the young people
[1:00:28] learning who has different gifts and
[1:00:29] talents because we have had those who
[1:00:32] have carried the burden for a long time.
[1:00:34] You know there was a time that I
[1:00:36] considered myself very young. I'm still
[1:00:38] young but I consider myself very young.
[1:00:42] And I'm realizing I'm about to hit 45.
[1:00:49] And that's at on the one hand, brother
[1:00:51] Jason, that has its its scariness to it.
[1:00:53] I say, "But wait a minute. I remember
[1:00:54] when I was looking at people who was 45
[1:00:56] and saying they're old." Now, that's not
[1:00:58] older. If you notice, we have been
[1:01:00] lifting the age of the youth the youth
[1:01:02] thing.
[1:01:04] The youth age moving with some of us.
[1:01:06] Somebody say just now it'll be 12 to 65
[1:01:10] because some of us refuse to accept the
[1:01:12] fact that we're getting older. But the
[1:01:14] reality is when you look at the deacons
[1:01:16] and the deacons wives and the elders and
[1:01:18] the officers, the reality, God is a God
[1:01:21] of progress.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; God is a God of succession.
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; God is a God of seeing people step up to
[1:01:26] the plate against all odds.
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter what the world
[1:01:30] presents. God is still God. He's the
[1:01:33] same yesterday, today, and forever. And
[1:01:35] he is still the God that says, "I am the
[1:01:36] Lord and I change not." We may be
[1:01:38] dealing with technological advances and
[1:01:40] dealing with AI and all kind of
[1:01:42] different things now. But God is still
[1:01:43] God. And God will still have a witness
[1:01:46] who will stand in 2025 and beyond and
[1:01:48] proclaim the glories of the living God
[1:01:50] and testify that this message is right.
[1:01:53] And if this message IS WRONG, THEN I
[1:01:54] DON'T WANT TO BE RIGHT BECAUSE I'M THAT
[1:01:56] PERSUADED THAT GOD SENT A PROPHET TO
[1:01:59] BRING US OUT OF LEADSIA AND PUT US INTO
[1:02:02] an age. [applause and cheering]
[1:02:04] Can the church say amen? And to let us
[1:02:06] know the HIDDEN MYSTERIES OF SCRIPTURE
[1:02:09] THAT WE COULD STAND ON THESE THINGS WITH
[1:02:10] CONFIDENCE AND SAY WE are going to be
[1:02:12] changed and transformed. Can the church
[1:02:14] say amen? [cheering]
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; So after service, we're going to have
[1:02:17] some fellowship and a wonderful time and
[1:02:20] uh it will be set after service as well.
[1:02:22] This coming Wednesday there will be no
[1:02:23] physical service. We'll stream and this
[1:02:26] coming Friday there will be no service
[1:02:28] because this coming weekend, Brother
[1:02:30] Andrew Glover will be here in Trinidad
[1:02:32] for the very first time. He has a
[1:02:34] tremendous ministry and he will be
[1:02:36] speaking on Saturday at 3 p.m. to the
[1:02:38] church with a message that's dedicated
[1:02:41] to the young people. And this coming
[1:02:43] Sunday at 10:00 a.m. and at 4 p.m. we do
[1:02:47] expect believers from other churches to
[1:02:49] join us. Uh but by the grace of God, we
[1:02:52] want to be able to get the word and be
[1:02:55] further strengthened in this season. We
[1:02:57] are the end of the year. I can't believe
[1:02:59] that this year is finished.
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; I don't even know where 2025 went. But
[1:03:04] the George, I remember when I was in
[1:03:05] secondary school, we were talking about
[1:03:07] Y2K coming.
[1:03:09] And when I was in secondary school, I
[1:03:11] said, "Yap, you have to come before
[1:03:12] Y2K."
[1:03:14] And I see Y2K came and Y2K went.
[1:03:19] And 2020 when I taugh 2020 would see the
[1:03:22] rapture. I recognized I was facing
[1:03:23] exams.
[1:03:26] Because at some point you would think,
[1:03:27] well, when the rapture come, it save you
[1:03:29] from an exam. No. Maybe the rapture come
[1:03:32] to finish. You don't have to go and
[1:03:33] work. You don't have to get no mortgage.
[1:03:34] You don't have to get bills because the
[1:03:35] rapture taking you out of this
[1:03:37] existence. And you don't have to deal
[1:03:39] with all the stress you see the older
[1:03:40] ones deal with. But God through his
[1:03:42] grace and mercy had a sifting process to
[1:03:45] really see who would believe after all
[1:03:46] these years
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; and what we would do with the word that
[1:03:49] we have received for all these years
[1:03:51] because it's very easy when you hear
[1:03:52] something and it's fresh and you're
[1:03:54] inspired and you're excited to run with
[1:03:55] it. BUT OVER TIME THE CARES of life
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; STARTS TO HAVE AN EFFECT ON US AND
[1:04:02] SOMETIMES THE RELEVANCE OF THINGS BEGIN
[1:04:04] TO change and that's tied to our topic
[1:04:07] today.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; Do not reject his invitation. Amen.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; And as we are in this season of the end
[1:04:13] of the year and Christmas and
[1:04:14] hospitality,
[1:04:16] I want you to imagine for a moment you
[1:04:20] prepare, you clean your house, but
[1:04:21] you're supposed to have it clean all the
[1:04:22] time.
[1:04:24] Are we are we together?
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; And Christmas is just a special
[1:04:29] cleaning.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; I hope we don't have people who just
[1:04:32] waiting for the end of the year. I'm
[1:04:33] having a I haven't started to preach
[1:04:34] yet. I just having a conversation. wait
[1:04:37] till the end of the year to go into
[1:04:39] hyperdrive.
[1:04:41] You know, I always remember brother John
[1:04:43] Phillip, precious brother Johnny Phillip
[1:04:45] said, "I'm not painting this Christmas.
[1:04:49] I'm not painting this Christmas."
[1:04:52] Not painting. It was Christmas Eve.
[1:04:54] Brother Mike, he went and buy the
[1:04:56] painting
[1:04:58] and that whole night he painted him.
[1:05:00] never forgot it because the spirit of
[1:05:03] the season got a hold of him and what he
[1:05:05] said he wasn't going to do he end up
[1:05:07] doing because they get caught up with
[1:05:08] him. But I want you to imagine for a
[1:05:10] minute you clean your house and you put
[1:05:12] your
[1:05:14] maybe a vegan ham and you know you have
[1:05:15] all kind of things now.
[1:05:18] You put your food in the oven and you
[1:05:20] prepare your meal and you set things up
[1:05:22] and you invite brother George to your
[1:05:24] house and you invite brother over to
[1:05:26] your house and you invite brother Jason
[1:05:28] and you invite sister Batista and sister
[1:05:30] Julia to your HOUSE AND YOU INVITE ALL
[1:05:32] THESE PEOPLE, brother Micah to your
[1:05:33] house. You you cook the food in them.
[1:05:35] AMEN.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; YOU TOOK TIME AND WENT TO THE GROCERY
[1:05:38] and you bought the items. You had the
[1:05:40] checklist. You didn't you you you didn't
[1:05:42] take chances because you wanted to make
[1:05:44] sure you get all the ingredients.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; You prepared things. You invested in the
[1:05:48] things. You put the food. You have
[1:05:50] everything ready. And then you say,
[1:05:51] "Listen, come."
[1:05:53] And you realize the invitation was for 2
[1:05:55] p.m. and 2 p.m. reach and nobody reach.
[1:05:58] 2:15 p.m. reach and nobody reach. 2:30
[1:06:01] p.m. reach and nobody reach. 2:45 p.m.
[1:06:03] reach and nobody reach. 3 p.m. REACH AND
[1:06:06] NOBODY HAD THE courtesy
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; to tell you initially I can't make it or
[1:06:16] no
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; are we together
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HAD YOU BEEN ADVISED BEFORE YOU
[1:06:21] COULD HAVE CANCELED the whole thing
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; BUT NOBODY SAID BECAUSE IF YOU KNEW
[1:06:26] BEFORE you wouldn't bother to put the
[1:06:27] effort in place
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; are we together
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; but in the last minute YOU REALIZE IS
[1:06:34] NOBODY WHO I invited coming.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; You're looking at the table, you're
[1:06:40] looking at the food, you're looking at
[1:06:41] the preparation, you're looking at the
[1:06:42] place and say, "But what I really I I
[1:06:44] really waste my time."
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; And this is one of the parables that
[1:06:49] Jesus gave,
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; one of them. And this one is the
[1:06:53] simpler. We'll get to the more complex
[1:06:55] later in the service.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; But we read the scripture. A certain man
[1:06:58] made a great supper and bade many and
[1:07:01] sent his servant at supper time to say
[1:07:03] to them that were bidden. SO HE STILL
[1:07:05] HAD TO GO AND TELL THEM I I INVITED YOU.
[1:07:08] You coming? This is like we WhatsApp and
[1:07:10] you know in truth they tell somebody
[1:07:12] you're on your way. They say yeah.
[1:07:13] Meanwhile they're now leaving home.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; Where you reach close
[1:07:21] they know the trinite spirit.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; Meanwhile they coming from grand toss
[1:07:25] racing down the highway. So he sent them
[1:07:28] to bid and they all I want the word all
[1:07:32] with one consent is as if they were in
[1:07:34] an accord or an agreement began to make
[1:07:37] excuse.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; The first said I have bought a piece of
[1:07:41] ground. So in other words I've made an
[1:07:43] investment
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; and I must needs go and see it.
[1:07:48] I pray thee have me excused. Now I want
[1:07:51] to point out something here that many of
[1:07:52] us miss in life because I preached a
[1:07:55] message similar to this years ago. what
[1:07:57] nine years ago called no more excuses
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; and in it I was saying there are many of
[1:08:01] us who feel that giving an excuse is
[1:08:04] getting you out of the situation
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; because when you read this scripture
[1:08:09] you'll realize God actually doesn't care
[1:08:12] about the excuse
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; he wants to hear NO EXCUSE
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; HE CALLING YOU TO LIVE A HOLY LIFE THERE
[1:08:18] IS NO EXCUSE
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; YOU calling you to be better THAN YOU
[1:08:22] WERE YESTERDAY THERE'S NO EXCUSE SAYING
[1:08:24] HUSBAND LOVE YOUR WIFE well the reason I
[1:08:26] had do it that way.
[1:08:30] Like we always say many times we respond
[1:08:31] to situation and we say well it's
[1:08:33] because he tell me that that's why I
[1:08:35] tell him that
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; that is an excuse
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; because he say this is why I hit him
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; and hit somebody don't have to be
[1:08:45] physical hit or it could be with your
[1:08:46] words
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; it could be with your action it could be
[1:08:49] and YOU ARE SAYING BECAUSE SOMEBODY did
[1:08:51] this is because the reason why and that
[1:08:53] is an excuse
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; are we together
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; and the other said I've bought five yoke
[1:09:01] of cup of oxen and I go to prove them
[1:09:03] you decide to go and try to see these ox
[1:09:04] really good and meanwhile food cook for
[1:09:06] you
[1:09:09] I pray have me excuse and they said I'VE
[1:09:12] MARRIED A WIFE AND THEREFORE I CANNOT
[1:09:14] come
[1:09:16] now what this is showing us this goes
[1:09:18] all the way back to Genesis we're going
[1:09:20] to preach in a little while to when God
[1:09:22] said to Adam why you did this
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; what was Adam's response. Adam didn't
[1:09:28] say, you know, I made a decision based
[1:09:31] on what was presented in me, but I
[1:09:33] decided
[1:09:34] he didn't say that or no. He said the
[1:09:36] woman
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; that you give me.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; So, he blamed both the woman and God
[1:09:42] himself.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; In other words, if you DIDN'T IF I
[1:09:45] DIDN'T have this woman, I wouldn't be in
[1:09:47] this position. And if you didn't give
[1:09:49] her to me, I wouldn't be because I WAS
[1:09:51] GOOD ALL BY MYSELF. AMEN.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; And this speaks to responsibility and
[1:09:57] accountability. BUT AS WE COME TO THE
[1:09:59] END OF THIS YEAR 2025, and prepare for
[1:10:02] 2026, we need to reach a point of NO
[1:10:05] MORE EXCUSES.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; WHY YOU HAVE AN EXCUSE ABOUT YOUR PRAYER
[1:10:08] LIFE?
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; At one point in preparing this message,
[1:10:14] I thought about asking the t the title
[1:10:16] being what is your excuse? We are trying
[1:10:18] to figure out what you could possibly
[1:10:20] say to God
[1:10:23] to explain to God why you treat your
[1:10:25] wife wrong,
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; why you treat your husband wrong, why
[1:10:30] you're not managing your home a certain
[1:10:31] way, why you not active in church, why
[1:10:35] you not living a testimony on what is
[1:10:37] your issue? What would you say to God?
[1:10:38] Because this is not about a man here,
[1:10:39] you know, this is a parable because God
[1:10:41] is showing how he feels about the
[1:10:42] matter.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; Are we together? This is not AN
[1:10:45] INVITATION TO A HOUSE. WE USE IT AS AN
[1:10:47] EXAMPLE. BUT HOW DOES GOD FEEL ABOUT IT
[1:10:49] WHEN HE GAVE YOU SOMETHING AND HE
[1:10:50] INVITED YOU TO HIS GLORY? HE INVITED YOU
[1:10:53] TO HEALING. HE INVITED YOU TO VICTORY.
[1:10:55] HE INVITED YOU TO THE PROMISED LAND. HE
[1:10:57] INVITED YOU TO THE HOLY GHOST. HE
[1:10:59] INVITED YOU TO RESTORATION. THE BANQUET
[1:11:01] HE HAS LAID OUT FOR YOU IS A SEVEN
[1:11:04] COURSE MENU. FAITH, VIRTUE, KNOWLEDGE,
[1:11:06] TEMPERANCE, PATIENCE, GODLINESS,
[1:11:09] BROTHERLY KINDNESS. THE PREPARATION OF
[1:11:11] THE FOOD IS THROUGH PRIESTS AND PROPHETS
[1:11:13] WHO HAVE CAREFULLY PUT THINGS TOGETHER,
[1:11:15] RIGHTLY DIVIDING THE WORD OF TRUTH.
[1:11:17] EVERYTHING HAS BEEN LAID OUT FOR YOU TO
[1:11:19] BE ABLE TO COME AND FEAST AT THE
[1:11:21] MASTER'S TABLE. HALLELUJAH.
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; In this analogy, in this parable,
[1:11:29] FRIENDS, YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO come and
[1:11:30] cook. YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO COME AND
[1:11:32] PREPARE THE FOOD. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS
[1:11:33] SHOW up and eat.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T HEAR ME THIS MORNING. JUST
[1:11:37] COME AND EAT. HALLELUJAH. YOU KNOW HOW
[1:11:39] GOOD YOU FEEL WHEN SOMEBODY INVITE YOU
[1:11:41] AND PREPARES YOU AND SAY DON'T WORRY DO
[1:11:43] I NEED TO BRING anything no I just want
[1:11:45] you to come. IT'S ONE OF THE BEST
[1:11:46] feelings they ever get. Say come now.
[1:11:48] WHAT DID HE BRING? DON'T BRING NOTHING.
[1:11:50] YOU COMING ALONE IS WHAT'S GOOD ENOUGH
[1:11:52] FOR ME. AND THAT'S WHAT GOD IS SAYING.
[1:11:54] [screaming] COME. COME AND GO WITH ME TO
[1:11:56] MY FATHER'S HOUSE. THIS IS BETTER THAN
[1:11:59] THE WORLD. IT'S BETTER THAN THE TROUBLE
[1:12:01] YOU'RE GOING THROUGH RIGHT NOW.
[1:12:03] HALLELUJAH.
[1:12:05] [applause and cheering]
[1:12:11] But these people made excuses WHICH I
[1:12:13] WANT TO QUALIFY seem legitimate
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; because everybody WHO MAKES AN EXCUSE,
[1:12:21] they believe they're justified in the
[1:12:23] excuse.
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; Well, if you know my boss, if you know
[1:12:27] this, if you know that, if you see what
[1:12:29] what he come and tell me, whatever it
[1:12:31] IS, IT IT'S JUSTIFIED. IT MAKES SENSE TO
[1:12:32] YOU.
[1:12:34] I was saying about over recently, if you
[1:12:36] are in the picture frame, you can't see
[1:12:37] yourself.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; You are in the frame. IT TAKES SOMEBODY
[1:12:41] OUTSIDE OF THE FRAME TO POINT out to
[1:12:43] you, you are in a wrong place, brother.
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; You're in a wrong place, sister. You
[1:12:48] have the WRONG PRIORITIES. BECAUSE THIS
[1:12:50] HERE IS A CASE OF PRIORITY. THE GOOD
[1:12:52] LORD INVITE YOU TO A SUPPER, INVITE YOU
[1:12:55] TO HIS TABLE, PREPARED A MEAL FOR YOU,
[1:12:57] AND YOUR BUSINESS MORE IMPORTANT THAN
[1:12:59] GOD'S INVITATION.
[1:13:01] You don't hear me THIS MORNING. YOUR
[1:13:03] INVESTMENT MORE IMPORTANT THAN GOD'S
[1:13:05] INVITATION. HALLELUJAH. WHAT YOU DOING
[1:13:08] IN YOUR DAILY LIFE MORE IMPORTANT THAN
[1:13:10] GOD'S INVITATION WHEN THAT WILL FAIL AND
[1:13:12] FALL APART? [cheering]
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; YOU CANNOT PUT YOUR FAMILY ABOVE GOD.
[1:13:18] YOU CANNOT PUT YOUR JOB ABOVE GOD. YOU
[1:13:21] CANNOT PUT YOUR THINKING ABOVE GOD. HE
[1:13:24] SAID, "MY THOUGHTS ARE HIGHER THAN YOUR
[1:13:25] THOUGHTS. MY WAYS ARE HIGHER THAN YOUR
[1:13:27] WAYS." THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
[1:13:29] YOU ARE DOING THIS WEEK. YOU DON'T HEAR
[1:13:31] ME THIS MORNING. THERE'S NO BETTER PLACE
[1:13:33] TO BE THAN IN THE HOUSE OF GOD. THERE'S
[1:13:36] NO BETTER INVITATION TO GET THAN TO COME
[1:13:38] TO THE HOUSE OF GOD.
[1:13:41] HALLELUJAH. SOMEBODY GIVE GOD A SHOUT of
[1:13:43] praise. Hallelujah.
[1:13:46] Oh, glory.
[1:13:48] Hallelujah. We take SO MUCH FOR GRANTED.
[1:13:52] THEY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND. And I want you
[1:13:55] TO UNDERSTAND, GOD ISN'T PLAYING GAMES
[1:13:57] BECAUSE THE END OF THIS SCRIPTURE SAID,
[1:13:58] "ALL THOSE THAT WERE BIDDEN WILL NOT EAT
[1:14:00] OF THE SUPPER. IF YOU REJECT HIS
[1:14:02] INVITATION, HE cuts you off.
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YOU REJECT THE HOLY GHOST,
[1:14:09] HE CUTS YOU OFF. YOU REJECT THE WORD, HE
[1:14:12] CUTS YOU OFF. YOU REJECT HIS GOSPEL,
[1:14:14] CUTS YOU OFF. YOU REJECT THE PROPHET,
[1:14:17] CUTS YOU OFF.
[1:14:21] [applause]
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:14:25] HALLELUJAH.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; GLORY.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I'm not marking nobody's
[1:14:31] papers this morning. The word is marking
[1:14:33] your papers. The word is marking your
[1:14:35] life. The word is marking your
[1:14:37] testimony. Hallelujah. He said, "Make
[1:14:40] your calling and election sure. THAT'S
[1:14:42] NOT THE PASTOR. THAT'S NOT THE ELDER.
[1:14:44] THAT'S NOT THE DEACON. THAT'S NOT THE
[1:14:46] TRUSTEE. THAT'S YOU. MAKE YOUR CALLING
[1:14:48] AND ELECTION SURE. YOU HAVE WORK TO DO.
[1:14:50] YOU ARE INVITED TO PRESS. YOU ARE
[1:14:54] INVITED TO POSSESS. YOU ARE INVITED TO
[1:14:57] CLAIM. YOU ARE INVITED TO TESTIFY. YOU
[1:15:00] ARE INVITED TO MAKE A CHURCH AND OMEGA
[1:15:02] REVIVAL. YOU ARE INVITED TO PRAY. YOU
[1:15:05] ARE INVITED TO DRESS RIGHT. YOU ARE
[1:15:07] INVITED TO LIVE RIGHT. YOU ARE INVITED
[1:15:09] TO HAVE A TESTIMONY.
[1:15:12] [cheering]
[1:15:13] NO MORE EXCUSES. LET TODAY BE THE LAST
[1:15:16] EXCUSE. LET TODAY BE THE FINAL EXCUSE.
[1:15:19] NO MORE EXCUSES. OH, HALLELUJAH. Turn to
[1:15:23] your neighbor and say, "No more excuses.
[1:15:30] Hallelujah.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; Turn to your other neighbor and tell
[1:15:44] them no more excuses.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THIS MIGHT NOT EXIST IN ANY
[1:15:48] OTHER CHURCH. We No CHURCH COULD MARK
[1:15:50] OUR PAPERS. WE WANT NO EXCUSES in this
[1:15:52] church.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We want to GET IT RIGHT. GET
[1:15:56] IT RIGHT ALL THE TIME. GET IT RIGHT ALL
[1:15:59] THE TIME. I WANT MY PRAYER LIFE TO BE
[1:16:00] RIGHT. I WANT MY WALK TO BE RIGHT. I
[1:16:03] WANT MY TESTIMONY TO BE RIGHT. I DON'T
[1:16:05] WANT NO EXCUSES. I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO
[1:16:07] TELL GOD, "WELL, IT'S BECAUSE OF THIS
[1:16:09] AND BECAUSE OF THAT, NO MORE EXCUSES."
[1:16:11] LET IT END TODAY. LET IT BE FINISHED
[1:16:13] TODAY. WE ARE STANDING UP AS SOLDIERS IN
[1:16:16] THE ARMY OF THE LORD. LET US ENDURE
[1:16:19] HARDNESS [cheering]
[1:16:21] AS GOOD SOLDIERS IN THE HOUSE OF THE
[1:16:23] LORD. IF YOU MAY BE SEATED.
[1:16:27] [cheering]
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; Brother Gideon preached a message a few
[1:16:29] weeks ago. The mission must be
[1:16:32] accomplished.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; If we are going TO RESCUE SOMEBODY, WE
[1:16:37] CAN'T COME AND SAY, "WELL, I did bounce
[1:16:40] MY FOOT. THAT WHY I COULDN'T FINISH THE
[1:16:41] MISSION."
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; WHAT KIND OF soldier are you?
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; We send you to COMPLETE THE MISSION.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; WE DON'T WANT NO EXCUSES. GOD HAS NEVER
[1:16:53] MADE AN EXCUSE YET.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; WHEN HE WENT FOR NOAH, [screaming] HE
[1:16:56] GOT NOAH. WHEN HE WENT FOR ABRAHAM, HE
[1:16:58] GOT ABRAHAM. WHEN HE WENT FOR LOT,
[1:17:01] [cheering]
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T HEAR ME. THE BIBLE SAID THE
[1:17:03] ANGELS GRABBED LOT [screaming]
[1:17:05] AND PULL LOT. LOT DIDN'T EVEN WANT TO
[1:17:08] GO. BUT THE ANGEL WAS ON A MISSION AND
[1:17:10] HE COULDN'T BRING BACK AN EXCUSE TO GOD.
[1:17:16] [applause and cheering]
[1:17:20] NO ANGEL HAS EVER COME BACK WITH AN
[1:17:22] EXCUSE.
[1:17:25] [cheering]
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; You don't hear me this morning. EVEN THE
[1:17:28] FISH THAT HAD TO TAKE JONAH COULD COME
[1:17:31] BACK WITH NO EXCUSE. THAT FISH WAS
[1:17:33] DESIGNED TO GET JONAH. HE COULDN'T SAY,
[1:17:36] "I DIDN'T SEE HIM. I DIDN'T FIND HIM. HE
[1:17:38] FALL TO THE LEFT. HE FALL TO THE RIGHT.
[1:17:41] I COULDN'T CATCH HIM." THE FISH HAD TO
[1:17:43] DELIVER.
[1:17:45] AND WE HAVE TO DELIVER. WE HAVE TO MAKE
[1:17:48] A CHURCH THAT WILL MAKE A REVIVAL. WE
[1:17:52] HAVE TO DELIVER. SEVEN THUNDERS WILL
[1:17:54] GATHER THE BRIDE. WE HAVE TO DELIVER.

[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; The mission must be accomplished.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. Nobody's
[1:18:33] leaving here sick.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; [cheering and applause]
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; The prophet SAID, "HOW COULD WE HAVE
[1:18:39] FAITH FOR A rapture and we don't have
[1:18:41] faith for DIVINE HEALING?"
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; SISTER PHOE'S TESTIMONY IS JUST A TASTE.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; It's just a taste of what's TO COME
[1:18:50] BECAUSE YOUR BODY HAS TO BE HEALED
[1:18:51] BEFORE IT CAN BE TRANSFORMED.
[1:18:54] YOU DON'T HEAR ME THIS MORNING. THESE
[1:18:56] GRAY HAIRS, WHETHER GRAY HAIR GOING TO
[1:18:58] GO BACK BLACK, I DON'T CARE WHAT THE
[1:19:01] DOCTOR SAYS. OH, YOU DON'T HEAR ME THIS
[1:19:03] MORNING.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; Brother Michael, THE HEART SURGERY YOU
[1:19:10] WENT THROUGH, THAT IS TEMPORARY. WATCH
[1:19:13] THE GREAT CREATOR PUT HIS HAND AND MAKE
[1:19:15] SURE EVERYTHING IS IN ORDER. He is able
[1:19:16] to do it. WE COME AGAINST CANCER THIS
[1:19:19] MORNING BECAUSE THE MISSION WILL BE
[1:19:21] ACCOMPLISHED. HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE,
[1:19:23] FEMALE CONDITION, DIABETES, LOW BLOOD
[1:19:26] PRESSURE, WE BIND IT THIS MORNING IN THE
[1:19:29] NAME OF JESUS CHRIST. BACK PAIN,
[1:19:32] SCIATIC, ARTHRITIS, I DON'T CARE WHAT IT
[1:19:35] IS. HOUSE OF HELL, HOUSE OF HELL, GIVE
[1:19:39] WAY TO THE NAME OF THE LORD JESUS
[1:19:41] CHRIST. [cheering]
[1:19:48] [applause]
[1:19:49] [cheering]
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; [applause and cheering]
[1:20:03] [applause]
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:20:16] [cheering]
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; FATHERS,
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; you are priests. Yes.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; of your homes.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; There can be no excuse.
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; We have preached it before. When the
[1:20:29] high priest
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; had to walk into the holies of holies,
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; they would tie a rope around him.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; If I was a high priest, brother Popwell,
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; I'm making sure I check the people
[1:20:41] first.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; You living right.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; You living right.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; You living right. Because now you going
[1:20:47] to die, you know. Amen.
[1:20:50] [applause]
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; If the high PRIEST GOES INSIDE THE
[1:20:52] HOLIES of holies
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; and the people have a wrong standing,
[1:20:58] the high priest dies.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; This is why judgment begins in a
[1:21:03] sanctuary.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; At the ancient men are THOSE WHO HAVE
[1:21:09] SAT UNDER THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; AND KNOW BETTER BUT HAVE NOT DONE BETTER
[1:21:14] BECAUSE THEY HAVE MADE EXCUSES.
[1:21:17] Are we together this morning?
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; We have become very casual.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; All of us. I'm not speaking to you. I'm
[1:21:33] speaking to all of us.
[1:21:37] people say after co people get so used
[1:21:39] to the stream and different things and
[1:21:41] all kind of different things
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; but it's still excuses
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; conversations you have on your job why
[1:21:54] what is your excuse
[1:21:57] because whatever you do comes from your
[1:21:59] heart you know
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; well he talked to me and what he tell me
[1:22:04] no brother in church never told me.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; I'd already feel the appreciation.
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; Are we here?
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; What she said to me,
[1:22:21] I didn't even know how to respond. I was
[1:22:23] speechless. We'll find scripture.
[1:22:24] Speechless. Did I have speechless in
[1:22:25] scripture, too?
[1:22:32] For every person ever caught doing
[1:22:34] something wrong, I have yet to hear
[1:22:36] somebody who say right away easily is it
[1:22:39] was me. You know,
[1:22:44] the bandit has an excuse.
[1:22:51] Everybody has an excuse. And an excuse
[1:22:53] is only required when you finished the
[1:22:56] mission or you're doing something wrong.
[1:22:57] Think about it. Because if you deliver
[1:22:59] the product, if I say bake a cake for me
[1:23:01] and you bake it and bring it in a time,
[1:23:03] there's no room for you to even have an
[1:23:04] excuse to it did the job.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; But if the cake air come out good,
[1:23:09] you never see those cakes that sink in
[1:23:11] the middle.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; But over made one.
[1:23:20] There are few I don't want to call it
[1:23:22] childhood trauma but
[1:23:25] it was that and the melon scarred me for
[1:23:28] life for years. We didn't have meon in
[1:23:30] the house after about cook it.
[1:23:36] It took years for that to be bought
[1:23:39] again to even be cooked. It wasn't even
[1:23:41] considered to be purchased to be cooked.
[1:23:44] Such was the damage done with that pot
[1:23:46] of melon.
[1:23:50] And the excuse might be I don't have the
[1:23:52] experience or nobody show me or nobody
[1:23:54] teach me or I didn't think and BUT IT'S
[1:23:56] STILL ALL EXCUSES
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT COMES DOWN TO YOU BEING
[1:23:59] HUNGRY FOR WHATEVER YOU want in life.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; Where you spend your time, what you
[1:24:04] discuss, WHO YOU SPEND TIME WITH TELLS
[1:24:07] ME WHO YOU ARE. BUT THE MAN SAID, "SHOW
[1:24:09] ME YOUR COMPANY. I'LL SHOW YOU WHO YOU
[1:24:11] ARE.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T NEED TO DESCRIBE ME. I DON'T
[1:24:14] NEED TO SEE YOUR JOB DESCRIPTION OR your
[1:24:15] your CV or your profile. Let me see who
[1:24:18] you walking with.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; BUT THE BIBLE SAYS, "SHOW ME WHAT PAGES
[1:24:24] WRITTEN UP ON YOUR BIBLE. SHOW ME IF
[1:24:25] THERE'S ANY HIGHLIGHTER MARKS. SHOW ME
[1:24:27] THE MAGAZINES IN YOUR HOME. SHOW ME YOUR
[1:24:29] HISTORY ON YOUR TV OR YOUR NETFLIX OR
[1:24:32] WHAT YOU WATCH ON FACEBOOK OR TIK TOK. I
[1:24:34] KNOW WHO YOU ARE. NOTHING YOU COULD TELL
[1:24:37] ME COULD COUNTERACT THE EVIDENCE.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; [applause and cheering]
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; AND IF I HOLD YOU TO YOUR EVIDENCE,
[1:24:44] YOU'LL SAY, "WELL, WHAT? I was just
[1:24:45] killing time."
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; That's the excuse.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; I was just killing time and a scroll and
[1:24:52] a stroll and a stroll and I stumbled
[1:24:54] upon it. Oh, really?
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; You see how easy it is
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; to make excuses.
[1:25:10] And in these excuses, this is again, is
[1:25:13] that the pastor marking your paper? Is
[1:25:14] God looking at your attitude?
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; What is your excuse for holding on?
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; What is your excuse for not forgiving?
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; Because the fact that you haven't
[1:25:26] forgiven means something is holding you
[1:25:28] back. And whatever that is is your
[1:25:30] excuse.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; And let me and I I think the last time I
[1:25:34] preached, we talked about the spirit of
[1:25:36] gossip. Anybody
[1:25:38] remember that
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; and say you gossiping to somebody and
[1:25:42] none of this happening here helping the
[1:25:44] person who you gossiping about is a real
[1:25:46] spirit or
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; the same thing with forgiveness. You not
[1:25:50] forgiving you holding an alt and a
[1:25:52] grudge. And the reality is God not
[1:25:54] testing the person God testing you.
[1:25:57] Amen.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; If you leave this service today with the
[1:26:01] right picture that you are the one on
[1:26:03] trial,
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; you are the one being tested. Not your
[1:26:06] wife, not the pastor, not the deacon,
[1:26:08] not your brother, not your sister, NOT
[1:26:10] YOUR CO-ORKER, YOU ARE THE ONE ON TRIAL.
[1:26:12] IN OTHER WORDS, WHEN GOD looking at you,
[1:26:14] he not considering any other factor but
[1:26:16] you.
[1:26:18] [cheering]
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; Can we see that picture? SO WHEN GOD
[1:26:20] LOOKING AT YOUR CASE, HE NOT SEEING YOUR
[1:26:23] MOTHER, YOUR FATHER, your brother, your
[1:26:24] boss, your neighbor, the money, the bank
[1:26:25] account. He has SEEING YOU BECAUSE ALL
[1:26:28] OF THESE INPUTS ARE IRRELEVANT. All God
[1:26:30] is interested in is the output.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; GIVEN ALL OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES AROUND
[1:26:36] YOU, WHAT WORDS ARE COMING OUT OF YOUR
[1:26:38] MOUTH.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE EVERY ONE OF US HAVE SITUATION
[1:26:41] AROUND US WE CANNOT CONTROL. BUT WHAT
[1:26:44] YOU COULD CONTROL IS THE WORDS YOU
[1:26:45] SPEAK.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; WHAT YOU COULD CONTROL IS THE THINGS YOU
[1:26:48] COULD DO.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; Are we here this morning?
[1:26:59] We said a few services ago,
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; you could never love your children more
[1:27:03] than God could love them. Amen.
[1:27:07] Some of us we love stupid
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; brother love does make people do some
[1:27:13] nonsense you know
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; in the thought that is right you know
[1:27:17] but God's example of love is corrective
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; he say as many as I love I rebuke and
[1:27:23] chasen is two things rebuke and chasen
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; so HE'S SHOWING LOVE HAS ATTRIBUTES WITH
[1:27:27] IT THAT IS TRUE LOVE BECAUSE love will
[1:27:29] not let you walk and fall into a ditch
[1:27:31] love will pull you and throw YOU IN THE
[1:27:33] CAR SO YOUR CAR GO OUT AND FALL IN A
[1:27:35] DITCH BECAUSE YOU DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND
[1:27:36] THE FOOLISHNESS YOU OWN. LOVE WOULDN'T
[1:27:39] SAY WELL LET HIM FIGURE IT OUT AND FIND
[1:27:40] HIS WAY. NO, LOVE WILL BREAK YOUR FOOT.
[1:27:43] THAT'S WHY THE PLAN OF SAID IF LOVE
[1:27:45] DON'T GET YOU DESPERATE CONDITIONS WILL.
[1:27:47] AND GOD HAS HAD TO BREAK FIGURATIVELY
[1:27:50] many feet [applause]
[1:27:52] [cheering]
[1:27:52] TO BRING US BACK TO THE HOUSE OF GOD AND
[1:27:54] SAY LORD I LOVE YOU. LORD I THANK YOU.
[1:27:56] LORD I APPRECIATE YOU. LORD I NEED YOU.
[1:27:59] BECAUSE WE GO ON OUR OWN STRENGTH AND WE
[1:28:01] MISS WHAT GOD IS DOING. BUT I THANK GOD
[1:28:03] THAT WE HAVE a revelation that love is
[1:28:05] corrective. That God wants the best for
[1:28:07] us even when we cannot see it for
[1:28:09] ourselves.
[1:28:13] [cheering]
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:28:21] I can look back at growing up
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; and many times at the time when I was
[1:28:27] being disciplined
[1:28:29] we we honestly share my testimony a
[1:28:32] little bit we don't be grateful for
[1:28:33] correction when we getting it at the
[1:28:35] point of time you know
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; at the point of time because it goes
[1:28:40] against whatever we thought was right
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; so say that is the wrong thing to do
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; are you seen it so you know
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; and for the young people this is a
[1:28:48] special service for Young people, you
[1:28:50] cannot see what your parents seeing.
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; You cannot see what the PASTOR SEEING
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE BIBLE places him in a
[1:28:57] watchtower.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; Meaning he has a higher vantage point.
[1:29:00] He has more access to even what's around
[1:29:02] you than you because he could simply see
[1:29:04] higher than you.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; So if you say, "Hey, be careful." This
[1:29:07] is why I said in the last service, don't
[1:29:08] enter this thing called marriage
[1:29:10] unadvisedly. We read it.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; Don't enter unadvisedly.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; Who gave you advice?
[1:29:20] Amen.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; Who are you seeking for advice and
[1:29:22] counsel? The Bible say out of the wisdom
[1:29:23] of counselors decisions are made.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; Who are your adviserss and are they
[1:29:29] godly adviserss?
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; Blessed is the man that walketh not in
[1:29:33] the counsel
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; of the ungodly.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; Many of us have ungodly counsel.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; We preach it.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; Somebody in your job say give give your
[1:29:45] husband the silent treatment.
[1:29:49] That is godly counsel.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; And where do you find godly counsel?
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; Many time we don't spend time nailing
[1:30:01] these things down. But there's a reason
[1:30:04] because there are people who think
[1:30:05] they're going to the rapture and they
[1:30:06] have no rapture to go because they're
[1:30:07] out of order.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; With a brand taught and it's in the
[1:30:10] word, everybody should have a home
[1:30:11] church.
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; So anybody who have a revelation and not
[1:30:14] in a home church, they have no
[1:30:15] revelation. Yes.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; They have no revelation
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; because you have to have a home church
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; and there's a watchtower for the home
[1:30:25] church that is the pastor of the church
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; who is supposed to BE THERE TO PROTECT
[1:30:30] YOU NOT JUST FROM ONCOMING DANGER BUT
[1:30:32] FROM yourself
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; because you cannot see yourself
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; and that's why it's easy to see others.
[1:30:41] This why they say take out the mode from
[1:30:43] your eye first
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; before you talk about other people
[1:30:45] because many of us we see it. Look at
[1:30:47] that one. Look at that one. Look at that
[1:30:48] one. This why I say don't talk about
[1:30:49] anybody children
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; because you don't want to come into your
[1:30:52] home.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; THESE ARE PRINCIPLES THAT LIFT US UP TO
[1:30:57] A HIGHER LEVEL. WE TRYING TO SET THE
[1:30:59] CHURCH IN ORDER BECAUSE there are more
[1:31:01] problems to come.
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; We haven't dealt WITH GOLIATH YET.
[1:31:06] ALL THIS BEAR AND LION trial you going
[1:31:09] through is just warming up for your
[1:31:10] Goliath to know
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; and your Goliath is YOU AND GOLIATH THE
[1:31:13] PASTOR NOT IN THAT EQUATION. WE ARE HERE
[1:31:15] to mentor you until you reach your own
[1:31:16] Goliath because you HAVE TO DEAL WITH
[1:31:18] YOUR OWN PERSONAL DEMONS BECAUSE THE
[1:31:20] BRANDHAM SAID THE PHILISTINES ARE
[1:31:21] PERSONAL DEMONS.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; THE ONES YOU'RE feeding
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; are we together? Anybody in the house
[1:31:30] this morning? [cheering]
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; I'm not saying anything strange.
[1:31:33] Everything we say in brother George is
[1:31:34] in the prophet's message and in the
[1:31:36] Bible.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; I'm just here to remind you of what you
[1:31:38] already know. Maybe you haven't heard IT
[1:31:40] IN SOME TIME, BUT IT'S TO REMIND YOU
[1:31:42] THAT YOU HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; I cannot sit as a minister and watch you
[1:31:47] do foolish and not say something about
[1:31:49] it.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; It's not personal.
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; I must be about my father's business.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE TO STEP UP.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; WE HAVE TO DO BETTER.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T KEEP COMING LATER, CHURCH.
[1:32:00] THAT IS ALL OF US. I'M NOT SPEAKING TO
[1:32:01] YOU. IT'S ALL OF US. WE CANNOT BE COMING
[1:32:03] LATE TO CHURCH.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; We have to MAKE A BETTER EFFORT.
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; WE HAVE TO TREAT THE THINGS OF GOD AS
[1:32:12] SACRED.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; You're supposed to read A BIBLE AND PRAY
[1:32:15] EVERY DAY. PEOPLE HAVE ALL KIND OF
[1:32:17] MYSTERY AND THEY CAN READ THEIR BIBLE
[1:32:19] AND PRAY EVERY DAY.
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; But I say this simple. Why don't speak
[1:32:25] about the woman and the son and the
[1:32:27] mystery and the first war and the second
[1:32:28] war and the third war are dealing with
[1:32:30] some of the ABC stuff? Because some of
[1:32:31] you at ABC level, we'll get to the third
[1:32:33] war and the second war and the first war
[1:32:34] and the first vial and the seventh vial
[1:32:36] and the seventh trumpet and the feast OF
[1:32:37] THE TRUMPETS. WE CAN GET TO THOSE
[1:32:38] THINGS. BUT THE SIMPLE THINGS, YOU HAVE
[1:32:40] TO GET IT RIGHT.
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; THIS GOSPEL COME TO BRING US INTO A
[1:32:45] CONDITION THAT GOD COULD SAY THERE IS MY
[1:32:48] SPIRIT FLOWING FREELY. YOU HAVE TO
[1:32:50] FORGIVE. YOU HAVE TO DROP YOUR ALT. YOU
[1:32:53] HAVE TO BE IN THE HOUSE OF GOD. YOU HAVE
[1:32:54] TO HAVE WANT TO BE HOLY.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; GOD SAID, "WALK BEFORE ME AND BE
[1:33:01] THEREFORE PERFECT."
[1:33:07] [applause and cheering]
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; Anybody in the house this morning?
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; Do not reject this invitation.
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; An invitation to present your body is a
[1:33:22] living sacrifice.
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; God don't want no dead sacrifice. Your
[1:33:27] body is a living sacrifice.
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; As a living sacrifice, it means your
[1:33:32] daily life is a sacrifice. I want you to
[1:33:34] think about it. I want you to compare
[1:33:36] living sacrifice versus the way
[1:33:39] sacrifices were done. They had to find a
[1:33:41] lamb without blemish.
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; You couldn't come and say this is one
[1:33:44] without blemish. The lamb had to be
[1:33:47] inspected.
[1:33:49] [applause]
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; So in other words, an audit had to take
[1:33:52] place. You say this lamb is without
[1:33:54] blemish. Let me check to see if it is
[1:33:56] without blemish. And the priest would
[1:33:58] check
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; and make sure. And once he's convinced
[1:34:01] this is without blemish, he could kill
[1:34:04] this
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; and you had to put your hand because as
[1:34:07] the life of this lamb left, THIS LAMB
[1:34:09] WAS DYING IN YOUR PLACE. AND HE HAD TO
[1:34:12] feel it so he could understand THE
[1:34:13] IMPACT OF WHAT WAS TAKING PLACE. This
[1:34:15] was not just someone to witness, it was
[1:34:17] something to experience. Are we
[1:34:18] together?
[1:34:22] So when you feel the life leave the body
[1:34:24] and you recognize wait a minute that
[1:34:25] should have been me
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; my sins because many of us I was saying
[1:34:29] to my daughter at home 6 years old the
[1:34:31] fear of God
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; is the beginning of wisdom
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; if you don't fear God you could never
[1:34:37] operate a certain kind of way if you
[1:34:39] don't have the fear OF GOD THAT'S THE
[1:34:40] PROBLEM
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; PEOPLE DON'T FEAR GOD.
[1:34:44] [applause]
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; I heard something recently
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; to go to the president's house.
[1:34:58] Do you know your car go with I know is
[1:35:00] spaghetti straps all your know what your
[1:35:02] cargo with your with your hand exposed
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; your car enter a courtroom. Correct me
[1:35:09] if I'm right. We have people who are
[1:35:10] officers of the law. You can't walk into
[1:35:12] a courtroom in a miniskuit
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; or what else
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; or your shirt out your pants. You can't
[1:35:19] enter the courtroom. It's called
[1:35:21] contempt of court. They could throw you
[1:35:22] in jail for that.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; They are fine for that.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; So people who does misbehave, it is
[1:35:29] interesting how they behave when they
[1:35:31] have to go to court because they fear
[1:35:34] the consequence of the law because the
[1:35:36] law would say you had TO FIX THAT. GO
[1:35:38] AND change and come back. Yeah. Amen.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; BUT PEOPLE WANT TO BE UPSET IN THE HOUSE
[1:35:42] OF GOD WHEN WE WANT TO SAY, "LISTEN,
[1:35:44] this is God's."
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; WHICH JUDGE ON EARTH COULD COMPARE TO
[1:35:48] THE JUDGE OF THE WORLD.
[1:35:50] [applause]
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; SO DON'T GO DON'T GET VEXED WITH ME. WE
[1:35:53] ARE OFFICERS OF THE COURT.
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; WELL, you don't hear me this morning.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU REACH A NATURAL COURT, THERE'S
[1:35:58] AN OFFICER OF THE COURT WHO IS CHECKING
[1:36:01] YOUR ENTRANCE. YOU GO THROUGH A SCANNER
[1:36:03] TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE NO WEAPONS.
[1:36:04] THEY'LL LOOK at you and say, "Okay,
[1:36:05] you're fit to go in."
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; That's what the deacons are. They are
[1:36:09] officers in the court.
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; So when they speak to you, don't get
[1:36:12] offended because if you go to a natural
[1:36:13] court, where you going to do a vex with
[1:36:14] you,
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; you understand how people's thinking.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; But I'm praying by the grace of God,
[1:36:21] once a egg, once a chicken break out the
[1:36:23] egg, you can't pay it back.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; So once your mind get expanded to
[1:36:27] recognize the holiness of God
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; because when Isaiah came into the
[1:36:31] presence of God, he recognized, wait a
[1:36:32] minute, I'm a unclean man. I'm a man of
[1:36:35] unclean. WAS A PROPHET BECAUSE THE
[1:36:36] CLOSER HE CAME TO GOD he recognized in
[1:36:38] presence things he didn't see about
[1:36:40] himself he start to notice and that's
[1:36:41] why when he comes to the house of God
[1:36:42] things we didn't see about ourselves WE
[1:36:44] THINK WE ARE RIGHT BUT then we start to
[1:36:45] notice wait a minute
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; it's a what is a grudge
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; it's a issue it's a it's a dark spot in
[1:36:51] my life HE SAY TAKE THE CALLS CLEANSE MY
[1:36:53] LIPS I I'm a man of unclean LIPS THERE
[1:36:55] ARE THINGS I'M SAYING I SHOULDN'T SAY I
[1:36:57] DIDN'T NOTICE BEFORE BUT I CAME TO THE
[1:36:59] HOUSE OF GOD AND IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD
[1:37:02] I REALIZED THINGS ABOUT MYSELF THAT NEED
[1:37:04] TO CHANGE.
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; THAT'S NOT JUST YOU. THAT'S ALL OF US.
[1:37:08] [screaming] IF A PROPHET, THE SAME
[1:37:09] PROPHET THAT WOULD SAY A VIRGIN WOULD
[1:37:11] conceive
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; would say, "I'm a man of unclean lips.
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; Take the clothes,
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; cleanse my lips,
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; here I am.
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; I'm not a prophet.
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; But if a prophet in the presence of God
[1:37:26] could realize
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; I shouldn't be talking." You know,
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; we read the scripture. The same tongue
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; that could bless and pray is the same
[1:37:35] tongue that could curse.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; The same tongue is a small member but it
[1:37:41] is a powerful one. The Bible say a small
[1:37:44] rudder off a ship move a whole ship
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; and our words destroy our homes,
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; DESTROY FAMILIES, CUT OFF THE BLESSING
[1:37:52] OF God
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; because we don't understand that by the
[1:37:55] words we speak, LIFE AND DEATH IS in the
[1:37:59] power of your tongue.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; Don't you know the Bible say every word,
[1:38:03] EVERY IDLE WORD SPOKEN, the Bible said
[1:38:05] you have to give account for it.
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; What will the excuse be?
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; Well, I didn't really mean it. For the
[1:38:11] God who knows the thoughts and intents
[1:38:12] of the heart.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; For the God who say he who lookketh at a
[1:38:17] woman
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; to lust hath already committed adultery
[1:38:21] in his heart.
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; That the desire and INTENT OF THE HEART,
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; HE RATES THAT AS THE ACT ITSELF, NOT THE
[1:38:28] ACT.
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; THE GRAVITY AND SERIOUSNESS OF WHO GOD
[1:38:37] IS. THAT'S WHY THE FEAR OF THE LORD IS
[1:38:40] THE BEGINNING, not the ending, the
[1:38:42] beginning of wisdom. BECAUSE WHEN YOU
[1:38:44] FEAR GOD, YOU FEAR his instruments, his
[1:38:47] institutes, his laws, his people, even
[1:38:50] the pew, the person next to you, cuz you
[1:38:52] don't know who they are.
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; Be very careful what you say. But said,
[1:38:55] if you have nothing good to say,
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; don't say nothing.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to help you today, you know.
[1:39:08] If you have nothing, in other words, but
[1:39:10] I want to say say something nice.
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; But the need to say it many times,
[1:39:16] accentuate
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; the positive,
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; eliminate the negative, and don't mess
[1:39:23] with me in between.
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; How are you accentuating the positive?
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; This is a weing to the end of the year,
[1:39:34] not the end of the service. I know I was
[1:39:35] going to say end of the service.
[1:39:38] We're not there yet.
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; By the end of the year, you have to
[1:39:41] purpose in your heart to leave some
[1:39:44] things in 2025.
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; That's why the Bible say forgetting the
[1:39:48] things that are past.
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; Some of us dragging it reach dragging
[1:39:52] you know because it don't no heavy no
[1:39:54] light burden. You're dragging all kind
[1:39:56] of issues with you.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; And God say just cast all your cares
[1:39:59] upon me.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; Just throw it. Just throw it.
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; Just just throw it. HE SAID FOR MY YOKE
[1:40:05] IS EASY, MY BURDEN IS LIGHT. YOU CARRY
[1:40:08] ALL KIND OF ISSUE, YOUR WIFE, YOUR
[1:40:10] CHILDREN, how it used to be, YOUR THIS
[1:40:12] AND ALL KIND OF STUFF UPON YOU AND YOU
[1:40:14] THEY'RE HEAVY.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; He said, "Come all ye who are heavy
[1:40:17] laden
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; and I will GIVE YOU REST." IS THERE
[1:40:21] ANYBODY looking for rest?
[1:40:23] [applause]
[1:40:24] [cheering]
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; I don't know why I'm saying all this
[1:40:27] this morning. Many people complain of
[1:40:30] tiredness, but it's not physical
[1:40:31] tiredness.
[1:40:33] Oh, come on now.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; It's not your tiredness because of just
[1:40:36] a lack of sleep, but your heart heavy,
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; your spirit heavy,
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; your mind heavy, heavy with guilt and
[1:40:43] shame and all kind of issues that you
[1:40:45] should have dropped a long time ago.
[1:40:47] This is a service to drop it, drop it,
[1:40:49] drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it, drop
[1:40:51] it, drop it.
[1:40:54] [applause]
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; There are some issues it may not even be
[1:40:58] worth addressing. Just drop it.
[1:41:07] Forgive us our trespasses
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; as we forgive those
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; who trespass against us.
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; In this journey and in this age we live
[1:41:20] in where the virtue of the age is
[1:41:22] brotherly kindness.
[1:41:24] If there's any test we all have to deal
[1:41:27] with is situation that challenge this
[1:41:29] virtue of forgiveness.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; And it's one thing whether George to
[1:41:34] preach about it. It's a whole another
[1:41:35] thing to deal with it, you know,
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; because then you realize situation come
[1:41:39] and you're not ready.
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; You realize you thought you was ready.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; And this is why I say only under crisis
[1:41:46] and situations you already know what
[1:41:48] stuff you're made of.
[1:41:50] Because when everything is good, you you
[1:41:52] you good enough.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; But if things go bad,
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; then you really realize who you really
[1:41:57] are.
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; Put somebody in a situation where they
[1:42:00] under pressure. We preach about Peter.
[1:42:02] Peter thought he was good. He say me
[1:42:04] deny Christ
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; and I serve as a deacon, elder, usher, a
[1:42:07] minister. But when they say Jesus did,
[1:42:10] they just take him to kill him. Just so
[1:42:12] you know. Weren't you in the service?
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; Is kill you. Say no. You
[1:42:20] you say take to kill him?
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; Me in the service.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; Which service?
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; And Peter start to deny once, deny
[1:42:31] twice. And when he recognized because at
[1:42:33] that point, what gripped him? Fear.
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; Fear take him.
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; At that point, he forget all the
[1:42:41] miracles.
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; At the at that time, he forget he
[1:42:44] walking water and all.
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. All he see
[1:42:48] now is is take they take Jesus. You know
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; if they if they could take him. What
[1:42:54] about me?
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; Do you know there's a squeeze coming?
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; I wonder how many really appreciate
[1:43:03] brother
[1:43:06] Clarence.
[1:43:08] Do you understand that the prophet talk
[1:43:09] about the world council of churches
[1:43:10] coming together
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; and that the bride will be a hunted
[1:43:17] All you just had to do push-ups and
[1:43:18] running and and sprinting and
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; hunted persecuted group for your
[1:43:25] testimony. You know,
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; do you believe God sent a prophet? What
[1:43:28] will you say?
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; Well, I mean, I was there. I I used to
[1:43:34] go.
[1:43:38] I mean how much I believe is like there
[1:43:40] were other people like brother Terry.
[1:43:46] This is why in the criminal world you
[1:43:48] people start to just snitch on others.
[1:43:50] No the believers go checks don't come to
[1:43:52] my house.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; You're looking for the ones who really
[1:43:55] really believe.
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; No I want to bring a level of reality to
[1:44:00] you
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; because this is the kind of pressure
[1:44:03] because in your schools some say well
[1:44:04] let me go and lime now. And some of us
[1:44:06] not strong enough to say I do not lime.
[1:44:08] What do you mean lime? You mean like
[1:44:10] lime juice?
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; I do not go to parties. I do not GO TO
[1:44:16] THESE THINGS. WHY? Because I believe
[1:44:18] SOMETHING DIFFERENT. YOU DON'T EVEN NEED
[1:44:20] TO EXPLAIN certain things to some
[1:44:22] people.
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; But some OF US HAVE NO BACKBONE.
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Let me go to a party. You
[1:44:27] there like an improper fraction. You
[1:44:29] cannot fit in."
[1:44:33] Hallelujah.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; Everybody know you're not there. YOU YOU
[1:44:35] NOT THERE. YOU CANNOT FIT IN. WHAT YOU
[1:44:37] DOING THERE?
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; I said before you a big eagle. I see a
[1:44:40] chicken around you. You must stand out.
[1:44:42] The camera on you.
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; You don't even dance in church. You're
[1:44:46] trying to dance in the people thing.
[1:44:51] I'm not trying to be funny. I want to
[1:44:52] call out something to know there are
[1:44:54] people in this world who stand up for
[1:44:56] what they believe. What do you believe?
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; What are YOU STANDING FOR? WHY IS IT A
[1:45:02] PROBLEM FOR YOU TO COVER YOUR KNEES AND
[1:45:03] TO come to church and to live right and
[1:45:05] to say, "I don't drink. I don't smoke. I
[1:45:07] don't GO TO PARTIES." THAT IS NOT MY
[1:45:09] THAT'S NOT WHO I AM.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; I BELIEVE IN FORGIVENESS AND HOLINESS
[1:45:14] AND PURITY and the message of the hour
[1:45:16] AND LIVING A SANCTIFIED LIFE.
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; I'M WAITING TO GET MARRIED TO HAVE
[1:45:22] SEXUAL INTERCOURSE. THAT IS THE REALITY
[1:45:24] OF YOUR STATEMENT.
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT playing games.
[1:45:28] [applause and cheering]
[1:45:38] There are things we didn't know when we
[1:45:39] were in primary school. Now the six,
[1:45:41] seven, eight year olds being taught two
[1:45:43] mothers, two fathers, this all kind of
[1:45:45] stuff.
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; The devil not taking prisoners. You
[1:45:48] know,
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; he taught to rob, steal and destroy.
[1:45:52] THAT'S WHY THE DEVIL KNOWS THAT TIME IS
[1:45:54] short
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; and he IS TAKING THIS SHORT TIME TO PUT
[1:45:58] AS MUCH PRESSURE AS HE CAN. WHAT ABOUT
[1:45:59] THE BRIDE of Jesus Christ? We have an
[1:46:01] invitation
[1:46:03] [applause and cheering]
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; to make a church that will make a
[1:46:06] revival.
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; Let me shake you parents. The things you
[1:46:09] think your children don't know, trust
[1:46:11] me,
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; they know that and 10 times more.
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; Don't be fooled.
[1:46:18] Amen.
[1:46:20] the two three hours on Sunday in church
[1:46:22] and maybe God help you if you don't make
[1:46:24] it out on Wednesday night and you don't
[1:46:26] properly bring your house in order and
[1:46:27] say listen we we in church on the stream
[1:46:30] at least
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; shame on you parents if you're not even
[1:46:33] enforcing that in your home what you
[1:46:35] expect to happen if you're not doing it
[1:46:37] &gt;&gt; who's supposed to do it I'm not in your
[1:46:40] home I have no information about your
[1:46:42] home I'm just dealing with the issues
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; because the point I'm presenting to you
[1:46:46] is for hours per by hours every single
[1:46:49] Today they are being confronted by
[1:46:51] information from teachers from school
[1:46:53] friends from all kind. I remember coming
[1:46:55] home from school and I'm not young and
[1:46:58] my mom and dad say whatever sir tell you
[1:47:01] day take it back or know
[1:47:04] because as a young child my own daughter
[1:47:07] arguing with me about a word you said
[1:47:09] miss put it on the board. So I say well
[1:47:10] miss put it wrong you say but miss is
[1:47:12] right. I say miss is not right.
[1:47:14] In her world she is seeing miss as
[1:47:16] right. It was a mistake on the board.
[1:47:19] and we going through a debate and I'm
[1:47:21] watching this six-year-old is convinced
[1:47:23] that Mrs. Right.
[1:47:25] And I could imagine how children could
[1:47:27] have a context of what they're hearing
[1:47:29] if you don't present to them what you
[1:47:31] should and take the responsibility to
[1:47:33] teach them the things of God because the
[1:47:35] word said tell this to your children and
[1:47:36] your children children so that THEY WILL
[1:47:38] KNOW WHAT GOD TOOK US FROM. PUT THE 12
[1:47:40] STONES THERE AS A MEMORIAL AND TELL THIS
[1:47:43] TO YOUR CHILDREN AND TO YOUR CHILDREN'S
[1:47:45] CHILDREN. BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T TELL THEM
[1:47:46] ABOUT THE PROPHET, WHO WILL? IF YOU
[1:47:48] DON'T TELL THEM ABOUT BEING HOLY, WHO
[1:47:50] WILL? THEY WILL NOT DO IT IN THE SCHOOL.
[1:47:52] THEY WILL NOT DO IT AMONG THE FAMILY. WE
[1:47:54] HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO TELL THEM ABOUT
[1:47:57] THE GOSPEL.
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; WHOSE RESPONSIBILITY IS IT?
[1:48:02] [applause and cheering]
[1:48:10] I don't know how I end up there.
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; The pastor say keep on going.
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; Whose responsibility is it?
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; Is that the the PTA meeting and the
[1:48:20] parents say where the teacher is not
[1:48:21] doing enough? What you doing at home
[1:48:23] with your child? What environment you
[1:48:25] create for them to succeed?
[1:48:27] It's not rocket science. You know
[1:48:30] whatever effort you put the Bible say to
[1:48:32] all labor there is reward.
[1:48:35] You know your child not doing no work at
[1:48:37] home. What do you expect to happen?
[1:48:38] Blame the teacher.
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; Soon is play play and not in nobody
[1:48:44] home. But if you DON'T CREATE AN
[1:48:46] ENVIRONMENT FOR THEM TO LEARN.
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; NO. But you you on the phone for 3 hours
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; and YouTube is now the babysitter and
[1:48:55] not in nobody home
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; and then the child presents. I wonder
[1:49:01] where they get that from.
[1:49:04] Well, you wasn't teaching them.
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; We dealing with responsibility.
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; We're dealing with excuses because it's
[1:49:12] very easy to blame. Well, the Sunday
[1:49:13] school not doing enough and the teachers
[1:49:15] not doing enough and the pastor
[1:49:16] preaching hard enough. How hard they
[1:49:17] want me to preach. But the Bible say you
[1:49:18] can preach it, they blew in the face.
[1:49:19] Unless people want to respond to the
[1:49:21] word, they will do nothing about it.
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; We could preach forgiveness over and
[1:49:24] over. Unless you want to do something
[1:49:25] about you, you will hold THE OUGHT TO
[1:49:26] YOURSELF. I CANNOT TAKE THE ART OUT OF
[1:49:28] YOUR HEART. [cheering]
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; Forgive me if this is too simple THIS
[1:49:32] MORNING, BUT WE'RE DEALING WITH YOUR
[1:49:34] HOME. BECAUSE BEFORE THERE WAS CHURCH,
[1:49:35] THERE WAS FAMILY.
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; BEFORE THERE WAS CHURCH, THERE WAS HOME.
[1:49:38] [screaming]
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; AND ADAM AND EVE HAD issues
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; that led to all that we're dealing with
[1:49:48] today.
[1:49:51] &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen?
[1:49:55] So from that scripture you read
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; I have all kind of notes you know but I
[1:49:59] just sharing with you this morning back
[1:50:03] to St. Luke 14 verse 21. So that servant
[1:50:07] came and showed his lord these things.
[1:50:09] In other words these are all the
[1:50:11] excuses.
[1:50:13] Then the master of the house being angry
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; said to his servant, "Go out quickly
[1:50:20] into the streets and lanes of the city
[1:50:23] and bringing hither the poor and the
[1:50:24] mamed and the halt and the blind."
[1:50:28] And the servant said, "Lord, it is done
[1:50:31] as thou has commanded, and yet there is
[1:50:33] room." In other words, the servant had
[1:50:34] no excuse. He did what he was commanded.
[1:50:38] And the Lord said unto the servant, "Go
[1:50:39] out into the highways and hedges, and
[1:50:41] compel them to come in." In other words,
[1:50:44] force them to come in that my house may
[1:50:45] be filled.
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; For I say unto you, and this is God's
[1:50:48] statement, that none of these men
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; which were bidden shall taste of my
[1:50:53] supper.
[1:50:54] &gt;&gt; Church, if you reject this thing,
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; that's on you. You know, God is saying
[1:50:59] the invitation is up to you to respond.
[1:51:01] If you want to keep making excuses,
[1:51:02] that's on you. Let's jump to Matthew
[1:51:04] chapter 22.
[1:51:09] verse one
[1:51:13] and this is Jesus giving another par
[1:51:16] parable along a similar vein but
[1:51:18] touching some different things in this
[1:51:19] first one there were excuses in both we
[1:51:21] talking about do not reject his
[1:51:22] invitation and both their invitations
[1:51:25] Matthew 22:1 and Jesus answered and
[1:51:27] spake unto them again by parables and
[1:51:30] said the kingdom of heaven
[1:51:32] is like unto a certain king so he's
[1:51:34] being very clear here This is the
[1:51:36] kingdom of heaven. He's addressing is
[1:51:39] like unto a certain king which made a
[1:51:41] marriage for his son. I want us to see
[1:51:45] the parallels here. Right?
[1:51:46] &gt;&gt; And send forth his servants to call them
[1:51:49] that were bidden which meant like in the
[1:51:51] scripture we read in Luke, invitations
[1:51:53] were sent out.
[1:51:56] Send forth his servants to call them
[1:51:58] that were bidden to the wedding. And
[1:52:00] listen to it, they would not come.
[1:52:07] So this parable that we are seeing here
[1:52:09] is God speaking in both scenarios of him
[1:52:13] inviting and people either giving
[1:52:15] excuses or simply saying I'm not coming.
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; How much time we invite people to church
[1:52:20] and they say I'm not coming. Where's the
[1:52:22] excuse? I feeling good. I hear this. I
[1:52:24] hear this and all kind of stuff. This is
[1:52:27] God addressing that here. Right. Amen.
[1:52:30] &gt;&gt; Again in verse four, he sent forth other
[1:52:33] servants.
[1:52:34] SO THIS IS GOD in his grace and mercy
[1:52:41] sending more to the same people. I want
[1:52:45] us to catch this TO SHOW THAT GOD IS NOT
[1:52:47] EVEN TRYING TO GIVE UP ON PEOPLE.
[1:52:55] He sends servants in verse three and
[1:52:58] people say I'm NOT COMING. SO GOD say
[1:53:00] you know what let me send a DIFFERENT
[1:53:01] GROUP. MAYBE MAYBE JUST MAYBE THEY CAN'T
[1:53:04] receive brother Isaac.
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; Let me send brother Anthony. Let me send
[1:53:08] brother Steven. Let me SEND SOMEBODY
[1:53:10] ELSE BECAUSE at the end of the day
[1:53:12] whatever means needs to happen let me
[1:53:13] get them.
[1:53:16] &gt;&gt; Are we getting this? Amen.
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; That's why such a grace go brother Joy
[1:53:20] we could have ministers come and
[1:53:21] minister to in the church because maybe
[1:53:23] I'm the PROBLEM
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD SENT SERVANTS TO GET THEM
[1:53:27] AND SAY I'M NOT COMING. So verse four
[1:53:29] AGAIN HE SENT FORTH OTHER servants
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; saying tell them which are bidden
[1:53:37] behold
[1:53:39] I have prepared my dinner
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; my oxen and my fatlings are killed
[1:53:49] &gt;&gt; and all things are ready.
[1:53:52] &gt;&gt; Come unto the marriage. You know what it
[1:53:54] is to have a wedding and nobody showing
[1:53:56] up?
[1:53:59] The fact that the Lord Jesus himself
[1:54:01] would take two parables to bring similar
[1:54:04] teaching shows us how important this
[1:54:07] thing is to him.
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; Behold, the marriage of the lamb has
[1:54:10] come and his wife had made herself
[1:54:12] ready. Speaking about a wedding supper
[1:54:14] and a feast to come. God is interested
[1:54:16] in in in his people being there. Are we
[1:54:18] together?
[1:54:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:24] &gt;&gt; Verse five.
[1:54:26] But they made light of it.
[1:54:30] They made light of it. Oh, is the next
[1:54:33] service? Is a special service. Well, I
[1:54:36] already
[1:54:38] think I need to go to this is a special
[1:54:40] meeting. You know what special meetings
[1:54:41] we had?
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; Make light of it.
[1:54:47] Make light of something is when
[1:54:48] something is important but you devalue
[1:54:50] it.
[1:54:54] By the grace of God, I'm hoping,
[1:54:56] praying, trusting that these words would
[1:54:58] find good ground.
[1:55:01] &gt;&gt; Not just to those here, but those
[1:55:02] online, those who would come this
[1:55:04] weekend, because we have made too light
[1:55:06] of the things of God.
[1:55:07] &gt;&gt; Don't we have enough sick people in our
[1:55:09] midst to not make light of this thing?
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; Don't we have enough real situations to
[1:55:14] not make light of it?
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; Here's the invitation from the Lord. And
[1:55:18] people make light. They casual. Well,
[1:55:19] you will see me when you see me.
[1:55:25] But they made light of it and went their
[1:55:28] ways,
[1:55:29] one to his farm
[1:55:32] and other to his merchandise.
[1:55:34] Again, showing what is priority.
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; And the remnant. So look how bad this
[1:55:44] is.
[1:55:45] Some say I am coming. I going to my
[1:55:47] farm. I going and do my business. I
[1:55:49] going to work. I doing whatever it is.
[1:55:51] And the remnant, those that didn't have
[1:55:54] things to do,
[1:55:56] the remnant took his servants and
[1:55:59] intreated them spitefully and slew them.
[1:56:03] &gt;&gt; Brother George, they come to invite them
[1:56:06] and they kill them
[1:56:09] &gt;&gt; for bringing the invitation.
[1:56:12] &gt;&gt; Imagine I come to your house to invite
[1:56:15] you to a wedding
[1:56:17] &gt;&gt; and your response is to kill me.
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:25] Do you understand this?
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; So somebody come and invite you to the
[1:56:28] house of God. Somebody saying come get
[1:56:30] out your condition. I know you're
[1:56:32] struggling but still come. Praise God.
[1:56:33] And the response here was to kill them.
[1:56:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:44] &gt;&gt; And when the king heard thereof he was
[1:56:46] wroth. In a similar fashion in the first
[1:56:48] chapter we read he was also angry. You
[1:56:50] wrote me angry. And he sent forth his
[1:56:52] armies and destroyed those murderers and
[1:56:55] burnt up their cities.
[1:56:59] Then said he to his servants, "The
[1:57:01] wedding is ready." But they which were
[1:57:03] bidden were not worthy. How were they
[1:57:06] not worthy? Because they didn't put
[1:57:07] priority to the invitation.
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; Go ye therefore into the highways, and
[1:57:13] as many as he shall find bid to the
[1:57:15] marriage. You see the parallel with the
[1:57:17] first one we read. So those servants
[1:57:19] went out into the highways and gathered
[1:57:21] together all as many as they found both
[1:57:23] bad and good. And the wedding was
[1:57:26] furnished with guests. And when they
[1:57:29] came, king came in to see the guests.
[1:57:32] And here's the type of the Holy Ghost
[1:57:34] being spoken of here. He saw there a man
[1:57:36] which had not on a wedding garment.
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; And he saith unto him, friend,
[1:57:41] [clears throat]
[1:57:42] how camest thou in hither not having a
[1:57:45] wedding garment? and he was speechless.
[1:57:48] Then said the king to the servants,
[1:57:51] "Bind him hand and foot and take him
[1:57:54] away and cast him into outer darkness.
[1:57:57] There shall be weeping and nashing of
[1:58:01] teeth.
[1:58:02] &gt;&gt; For many are called, but few are
[1:58:05] chosen." Amen.
[1:58:07] &gt;&gt; So I hope this connects with our hearts
[1:58:09] this morning that God is very serious
[1:58:12] not just about his invitation but there
[1:58:14] are consequences to the rejection of the
[1:58:17] invitation. It's one thing to be invited
[1:58:20] and is a one thing to give excuse and
[1:58:22] give excuse to the point that you kill
[1:58:24] the man who giving you the invitation.
[1:58:26] But in both scenarios God said in the
[1:58:28] first one not one of these men will eat
[1:58:30] in my supper and in the second one he
[1:58:33] killed them.
[1:58:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. because they rejected the
[1:58:36] invitation.
[1:58:38] &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen?
[1:58:40] &gt;&gt; I'm getting ready to wind down.
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; But the Brandham said here in the
[1:58:48] message, is your life worthy of the
[1:58:50] gospel?
[1:58:51] &gt;&gt; But the B said man has always tried to
[1:58:53] make excuses not to receive God's word
[1:58:56] of his invitation.
[1:58:59] Man is constantly
[1:59:01] making excuses.
[1:59:05] Now, we see when
[1:59:08] God gives a man an invitation to do
[1:59:09] something or to receive the invitation
[1:59:11] that he's given him and he returns it
[1:59:12] down, there's nothing left after mercy
[1:59:14] is spurned but judgment. If you step
[1:59:17] over the boundaries of mercy, then
[1:59:19] there's only one thing left and that is
[1:59:20] judgment. And we have preached this many
[1:59:22] time when we preach on do not cross the
[1:59:24] line. Remember the Brandham said
[1:59:25] there'll come a time when young people
[1:59:26] will be praying at the altar asking for
[1:59:28] mercy, but they've already crossed the
[1:59:30] line. No more mercy for them. And as a
[1:59:32] young believer that that
[1:59:35] troubled me because I could not
[1:59:36] understand at the time how there could
[1:59:38] be a point where people praying at the
[1:59:40] altar and no more mercy for them.
[1:59:42] &gt;&gt; And this is why the Bible said seek the
[1:59:44] Lord while he may be found. Call upon
[1:59:46] him while he is there. And but Abraham
[1:59:48] said there's no excuse. If you're not
[1:59:49] baptized, get baptized. If you do not
[1:59:50] have the Holy Ghost, get the Holy Ghost
[1:59:52] because there's no excuse. You have to
[1:59:53] take action and you have to respond
[1:59:55] quickly because the invitation is open.
[1:59:57] And there's coming a time when aviation
[1:59:58] will be closed. And once these seats are
[2:00:00] filled, it's it's over. And if you
[2:00:02] didn't come in the right way and get a
[2:00:04] wedding and garment, WHICH IS THE HOLY
[2:00:05] GHOST, YOU CAN'T COME BACK IN. BECAUSE
[2:00:07] IF YOU FIND YOU IN THERE WITHOUT THE
[2:00:08] HOLY GHOST, HE WILL SAY, "HOW DID YOU
[2:00:09] COME IN HERE, FRIEND?"
[2:00:17] &gt;&gt; But goes on, when God sent Noah servant
[2:00:19] and made a way of escape for all the
[2:00:20] people who wanted to be saved, but the
[2:00:22] people only laughed and scorned at Noah.
[2:00:24] But God made the way. But they had an
[2:00:27] excuse. It wasn't according to their
[2:00:30] modern thinking. It wasn't the way they
[2:00:32] wanted it. So they made excuse in the
[2:00:34] days of Noah. Brother goes on. They made
[2:00:37] excuses in the days of Moses. They made
[2:00:39] excuses in the days of Elijah. They made
[2:00:41] excuses IN THE DAYS OF CHRIST. AND THEY
[2:00:43] make excuses today.
[2:00:47] &gt;&gt; It's no different.
[2:00:50] &gt;&gt; We are very good at making excuses.
[2:00:54] I've done too much mistakes. God don't
[2:00:55] want to hear that. There's mercy for
[2:00:58] you.
[2:00:59] &gt;&gt; There's mercy for you. God not even
[2:01:01] getting the excuse of your failures. God
[2:01:03] not accepting that excuse either. The
[2:01:06] mercy is open.
[2:01:08] &gt;&gt; The opportunity is open. If you are
[2:01:10] backslided today, there's mercy for you
[2:01:12] today.
[2:01:13] &gt;&gt; God could not take in any excuse.
[2:01:15] &gt;&gt; We make excuses. I've never done this
[2:01:17] before. I don't have the right tools.
[2:01:18] This person stumbled me. So, somebody
[2:01:20] stumbled you. So, that's your your
[2:01:21] excuse.
[2:01:23] This person did it. This person did
[2:01:24] that. I didn't have the time. How is
[2:01:26] that an excuse? I don't have the time. I
[2:01:28] have work commitments. I don't talk to
[2:01:30] that person. That is your excuse. I'm
[2:01:32] not qualified. I don't have the
[2:01:33] experience. I don't have the education.
[2:01:35] My family doesn't support me. I'm the
[2:01:36] ONLY ONE HERE. FOR EVERY PERSON WHO HAS
[2:01:39] THAT TO SAY, GOD IS SAYING, "I'm not
[2:01:40] here any
[2:01:42] say."
[2:01:43] &gt;&gt; When God is ready for Moses, Moses say,
[2:01:44] "I can't talk. I don't have the
[2:01:47] experience. I don't have what it takes."
[2:01:49] &gt;&gt; God say, "You have anything else? You
[2:01:51] have any more excuses?" Because you
[2:01:52] still going
[2:01:54] &gt;&gt; AFTER ALL EXCUSES. YOU ARE STILL THE
[2:01:55] ONE. GOD IS NOT LOOKING TO REPLACE
[2:01:57] ANYBODY. SO, FORGET THE EXCUSES AND GET
[2:01:59] INTO ACTION. Get desperate. IT MIGHT
[2:02:02] SOUND LEGITIMATE, BUT THE EXCUSES
[2:02:05] DOESN'T CHANGE THE FACT THAT YOU'RE
[2:02:06] GOING TO BE DELIVERED.
[2:02:08] &gt;&gt; YOUR EXCUSE IS NOT GOING TO CHANGE THE
[2:02:09] FACT THAT YOU'RE GOING TO GET THE HOLY
[2:02:10] GHOST. YOUR EXCUSE IS NOT GOING TO
[2:02:12] CHANGE THE FACT THAT YOUR NAME IS
[2:02:14] WRITTEN ON THE BOOK. YOUR EXCUSE IS NOT
[2:02:16] GOING TO CHANGE THE FACT THAT YOU'RE
[2:02:17] GOING TO BE ADOPTED. YOU'RE GOING TO BE
[2:02:18] PERFECTED. YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO BE
[2:02:20] HONED AND SHAPED INTO THE STATUE OF A
[2:02:22] PERFECT MAN. YOUR SINS, YOUR FAILURES,
[2:02:24] YOUR PAST. THAT IS NO EXCUSE.
[2:02:27] &gt;&gt; TODAY IS the beginning of the rest OF
[2:02:29] YOUR LIFE. TODAY YOU COULD TURN AROUND,
[2:02:31] SHIFT YOUR PERSPECTIVE, AND SAY, "AS FOR
[2:02:33] ME, AND MY HOUSE, WE WILL serve the
[2:02:35] Lord."
[2:02:36] &gt;&gt; Today is THE DAY OF THE TRANSFORMATION
[2:02:38] OF YOUR LIFE. CAN THE CHURCH SAY,
[2:02:39] "AMEN."
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:02:43] &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH.
[2:02:46] Don't make any more excuses. Let today
[2:02:48] be the final day. Let today be the day
[2:02:51] that you change and you transform and
[2:02:53] you put everything behind you and say,
[2:02:55] "Lord, as for me and my house, I'm ready
[2:02:57] to give it all up.
[2:02:58] &gt;&gt; But we will serve you with everything."
[2:03:00] &gt;&gt; Young people, if you have never made a
[2:03:02] decision to serve God with your all,
[2:03:05] don't you leave their service today with
[2:03:06] another excuse. But Brandham said, "IF
[2:03:09] YOU'RE NOT BAPTIZED, DON'T make another
[2:03:11] excuse. Come to the water and to be
[2:03:13] baptized. IF YOU HAVE NEVER SOLD OUT OF
[2:03:16] GOD BEFORE, don't have another excuse.
[2:03:19] If you have an ought, drop it today. No
[2:03:21] excuses. If you have to MAKE SOMETHING
[2:03:23] RIGHT, DROP it today. No excuses. You
[2:03:26] need to be prayed for at the altar,
[2:03:27] forget everything else. We'll pray for
[2:03:29] you. No excuses. But we are leaving here
[2:03:32] with a clean slate. We are leaving here
[2:03:35] that God himself have to look down and
[2:03:36] say, "I saw you took a response." The
[2:03:38] musician, get ready.
[2:03:40] &gt;&gt; I'm about to close out.
[2:03:46] Hallelujah.
[2:03:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:53] &gt;&gt; But man said the rich man
[2:03:56] had an excuse.
[2:04:04] &gt;&gt; He was too weighed down with too many
[2:04:06] friends.
[2:04:07] Some of us our friends are our excuse.
[2:04:11] Some of us family is our excuse.
[2:04:15] this person said this, this person did
[2:04:17] that, this person. But when you look at
[2:04:18] it at the end of the day, you have no
[2:04:20] reason to not be further in your
[2:04:21] spiritual walk.
[2:04:25] &gt;&gt; We say we don't have time, but when you
[2:04:26] look, you're really spending your time
[2:04:27] doing things you shouldn't be doing.
[2:04:30] &gt;&gt; So, we are here to kill the excuses this
[2:04:32] morning
[2:04:33] &gt;&gt; so you could accept the invitation
[2:04:36] &gt;&gt; to come to the altar to make things
[2:04:38] right and to leave knowing that you have
[2:04:41] cast your cares on the altar.
[2:04:45] Come ye who are heavy laden and I will
[2:04:47] give you rest.
[2:04:49] &gt;&gt; The Bible said I stand at the door and
[2:04:51] knock.
[2:04:54] &gt;&gt; God not pushing down your door.
[2:04:57] &gt;&gt; He not forcing his way into your home in
[2:04:59] their life. He said I stand at the door
[2:05:01] and knock and if any man open up I will
[2:05:04] come in.
[2:05:06] &gt;&gt; And that's how I feel this morning as we
[2:05:08] prepare to wrap up this service.
[2:05:10] Don't have any excuse friends.
[2:05:13] Forget who's next to you. Forget your
[2:05:16] past. Forget your failures. Forget your
[2:05:18] mistakes. Forget everything. And just
[2:05:20] throw it aside and say, "Lord, it's just
[2:05:21] you and me this morning." You can begin
[2:05:24] to play something softly.
[2:06:02] When God went to Gideon in the Bible,
[2:06:06] Gideon presented all the reasons
[2:06:09] He said, "My tribe is the smallest
[2:06:10] tribe. My family is the smallest family,
[2:06:13] and I'm the smallest one in my family.
[2:06:15] It can't be me you're talking to." He
[2:06:17] had his list of excuses.
[2:06:20] You might be here this morning and say,
[2:06:21] "But I haven't been in church for a long
[2:06:23] time." Or,
[2:06:25] "You don't even know the struggles that
[2:06:26] I've been going through, and you don't
[2:06:27] even know the problems that I have."
[2:06:31] I invite you this morning to throw those
[2:06:33] things out. [music]
[2:06:35] God isn't looking at you from your
[2:06:37] yesterday, your last month, your last
[2:06:39] year, your last 5 years, every head
[2:06:41] bowed, every eye closed.
[2:06:43] God isn't interested in your yesterday.
[2:06:46] God has only one interest. what he says
[2:06:50] about you. What the word says about you,
[2:07:02] husband, wife,
[2:07:05] mother, father, child, daughter,
[2:07:08] whatever this morning,
[2:07:11] I invite you to drop it.
[2:07:14] Drop the issue.
[2:07:17] Drop the issue. this morning.
[2:07:25] Forgive your husband.
[2:07:28] Forgive your wife. Forgive your
[2:07:29] children.
[2:07:30] Forgive your parents.
[2:07:33] Forgive your coworker. Forgive the
[2:07:35] neighbor.
[2:07:37] No excuse.
[2:07:40] You hinder your own prayer when you
[2:07:41] don't drop it.
[2:07:43] Forgive the person who wronged you.
[2:07:46] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:07:47] &gt;&gt; Forgive yourself.
[2:07:50] Many times we reach a point where we
[2:07:52] could forgive others and we don't even
[2:07:53] forgive our own selves.
[2:07:56] You have to forgive yourself too
[2:08:01] [music] so that God could begin to move.
[2:08:04] Every head bowed, every eye closed.
[2:08:11] I'm not going to force anything. [music]
[2:08:16] But we will give the opportunity this
[2:08:18] morning.
[2:08:20] If you want us to pray for you and you
[2:08:23] really mean business with God, this is
[2:08:25] not if [music] you're just feeling to
[2:08:28] get prayed for, but you really want your
[2:08:30] life to be transformed
[2:08:32] and you know you've been holding on to
[2:08:34] stuff, dealing with stuff, whatever
[2:08:35] [music] it is, and you want us to pray
[2:08:36] for you, then we'll do that. Maybe
[2:08:39] there's one person, maybe there's two
[2:08:41] people, I don't know, but we'll open
[2:08:43] [music] the altar briefly
[2:08:45] at this time. We'll pray for you if you
[2:08:47] want to.
[2:08:50] There's one. Is there anyone else?
[2:08:55] Whatever your need is this morning, he
[2:08:56] is here.
[2:08:58] [music]
[2:08:59] We're not making excuses anymore.
[2:09:03] We're not making excuses. We want to
[2:09:05] live a holy life. We want to live a pure
[2:09:06] life. We want to live a true life.
[2:09:08] Heavenly Father, Lord, we have sons and
[2:09:10] daughters coming up to the altar. Lord,
[2:09:13] we pray for your daughter. Lord, you
[2:09:15] know her need. You know her cry.
[2:09:16] Whatever it is, Father, you know it more
[2:09:18] than I ever could. Father, Lord, may you
[2:09:20] touch your daughter even now, Lord. From
[2:09:22] the crown of her head to the soles of
[2:09:24] her feet, Father, Lord, may you bring
[2:09:27] the peace, the release that Lord, she

[2:09:47] being. Father, bring a release that she
[2:09:49] is longing for, Father. Lord, your
[2:09:51] daughter here at the altar. Lord, you
[2:09:53] know what it is, Father. I don't know,
[2:09:55] but Lord, you said you said lay hands
[2:09:56] and Lord, they will recover. Lord, we
[2:09:58] bring whatever it is into your hands in
[2:10:01] the name of Jesus [music] Christ.
[2:10:02] Father, Lord, your daughter looking for
[2:10:04] more of you. Looking for a change,
[2:10:06] looking for a transformation, looking
[2:10:08] for a rustle in the malberry tree.
[2:10:10] Father, Lord, we are Lord dealing with
[2:10:13] different ones. Father, Lord, you know
[2:10:15] the need. You know the desire. [music]
[2:10:16] May the angel of the Lord visit each one
[2:10:19] in the mighty name of Jesus Christ.
[2:10:22] You in the audience, begin to cry out.

[2:10:27] your family. Catch a burden for those
