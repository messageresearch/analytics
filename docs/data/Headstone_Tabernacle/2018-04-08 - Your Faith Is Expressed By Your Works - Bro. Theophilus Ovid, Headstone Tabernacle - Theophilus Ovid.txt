search for all eternity just wishing them right now in the only possibilities Oh to touch my oh Jesus you are the seats you gotta seize it [Music] god bless you and welcome had some time and I'm with welcome to Sunday morning feast for the Lord even bring you greetings from Africa region some Ivory Coast and what a time that we had there amen it was a convention just at another level Chile South America was wanting Chile's on fire poor God moving such a mighty way and in Ivory Coast was was was something else it was such a presence and power like we have never experienced before your people that were delivered baptized with the Holy Ghost set free remember in Chile there was this couple that uh that was about a verge of divorce and it was gonna get divorced that very week and the pastor begged them just attend that convention let's give it one more chance but I cut a long story short spread sprague or come down by resentment and they completely delivered no more divorce is fine now all is well and God really raised the anointing it was obvious it was something that God did himself to raise your loins and upon the ministry upon the brothers and what a time and but uh all over the country and my myself share this six services we are to each and the food services firstly we started like a last service as I tell you it's a mountain that was in that place the first service was like a last service but God gave us tremendous victory it was even the most amount of people we haven't had in convention like that so we know the Holy Spirit is moving in a mighty way and it will take and you know something struck you know salvation is free but power is not free power going with character [Music] salvation is free but power is not free so people want power to see the eye right others are wrong Gordon Edwin that God is nothing this kind of show of thing and trial what Guana confirming is is his word so he sent a prophet to bring his word that we could believe it and receive it and let go on come and confirm it in your life and this is the age of maturity where the sons of God have to be ripened that's why the Eden I'm Esav a center right in the sea that's inside of you and we're gonna play back the tapes you have to hear back some of these stuff because I got some real nuggets there and where I'm saying you're not even Christian by your choice not even by your choice he choose you to be a Christian you just picked up your hand and say I want to be a Christian and become a Christian it was some powerful thing that came out because the bride have a seed in her soul the foolish version of a space for the seed and the serpent seed have no space whatsoever so because you have a seal in your soul you can receive the word and get the spirit to come upon the seed that's inside of you that God put before the foundation of the world God is not no scratching his head wondering if to save you wonder if to call you wonder if to redeem you he's got scratching his head [Applause] that's why you're supposed to be Shelton every single service that's why usually my prayers every single service he said you have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordained you to bring forth fruit this has nothing to do with your sins this has nothing to do with your past this has nothing with your failures this is holy for you he called do is shout in the house this have nothing to do what happened last night last year last 10 years this has nothing to do with that the son who is from you he called he called he justified I know he justified he has already Taurus even this season my I wish I could take the whole church with me to Ivory Coast Ivory Coast is different we have worship in Africa by staff worship and worship when every course is different my goodness they will burn you out they will take the breath all to you my use of what fire is about worship you talk about praise praise the name of the Lord and you have so much a shout about just a think that chord before the foundation of the world he taught about you I wonder what your boss think and your neighbor think and your friends forget them worship dog [Applause] they don't have a heaven the drama hell worship God we know what we worship Oh glory to God Jesus told the woman our comin now is when the true worshipers will worship the father in spirit and in truth for God is a spirit Laurene according to be seated sober a John can take completely demolished me the human spirit flatten it bring it straight off that Daniel the image of goal and Babel is a vision of a man and that image has to be crushed a stone commander crush it and he brought about the enemy is what is written the collided poop and in Makati bees are not happening what about the enemy within the enemy within your life your five senses your human spirit that gets him in Broadway and that's what God wants to destroy the enemy within and that's why we're Ron says the greatest enemy is me myself because if I could get out of the way then got to do things that you already know nothing about you want to get out in your way that's what we're gonna charge you this morning glory to God Amen praise gone is a condition of a perfect feet which is forgiveness praise God the blood and know who you are and the disciples could didn't have perfect fit to handle the power that was given to them and I've got put you in a pipe and you don't move you say there's no feet in it you have cow waiter got to push all the way push you all over to the pipe and then he said blessed he said overcome it he say you over you overcome nothing go just push it you a pipe so many times God leave us the hand to see what we will do about what we are hearing so this morning's message that I have really would have liked to play back one on the message message but I just have something upon my heart that I want to bring to you this morning the feel the Lord put up on my heart so could be started for the word we have a baptism after service god bless my brother praise the Lord Amen hallelujah am I my precious mother she'll be baptized on Wednesday I was having arranged for to be dumped ago Matic which he says fully baptized in the church so between nine and ten she wanna be baptized right here and the church on Wednesday she's 93 years old and TT 93 years old and I'm grateful to what I'm delighted I'm ecstatic about that Amen in any man I met many years ago coming to this message and we all Catholics and Lee of course the family complained but it's so different now after all these years so if you have your Bibles are like a turn with me to three portion of scriptures from James chapter 2 Romans chapter 4 and he boosts tatin from James - we wanna read from verse 21 or 26 Romans 4 wanna read from this one to eat eBoost 13:8 title of the message as your feet is expressed by your works read in James 2 we read was that Abraham our Father justified by works when he offered Isaac upon his son upon the altar see is the whole feet brought with works and by works was feet made perfect and the scripture was fulfilled which saith abraham believed God and it was imputed unto him for righteousness and he was called a friend of God you see then how that by works a man is justified and not by faith only likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works when she had received the messengers sent him out another way for as the body without the Spirit is dead so faith without works is dead also Romans 4 verse 1 what shall we say then that Abraham our Father as pertaining to the flesh hath found for if Abraham were justified by works yet aware of the glory but not before God but what see at the SHA abraham believed God and was counted unto him for righteousness now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace but of debt but him that worketh not but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly his faith is counted for righteousness even as demon also described the blessedness of the man unto whom God will impute righteousness without works saying blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven whose sins are covered blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin last Scripture he was sitting in Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever let's bow our heads with a prayer Heavenly Father we thank you for your presence and your love on this great opportunity in this end time to surrender to you surrender Allah or father may come down in your world and breed upon your word and breed upon your people take me out of the way and confirm it with signs wonders and miracles we have a scripture Lord the Lord Himself went everywhere with them confirming the word father there are so many sick believers everywhere around the world and even right here Oh God has a great need for divine healing miracle working power under restoration virtue of God to come amongst the people won't to ride a tree once more granted father and heal your people in Jesus and we ask it amen amen you may be seated oh praise God thank you lord and Friends I'm getting not kind of burden to see sick people really be delivered set free there's a burden there's a everywhere you see it all all wrong where we go there's so much sick christian sick people walk on a sickness cancer tumor all manner of sickness and jesus release power to handle all manner of sickness and all manner of the reasons so we have to get right back there because that's what goers in a profit to turn our hearts back to the feet of the father not the talk of the father's but the feet of the furnace not the argument of the father's not the debate of the father's but the defeat of the father's so this morning your feet is expressed by your works and we know the Scriptures this is from Mexico works if it's expressed and Berta Brannan explained that is not conflicting the scriptures but is one is what man sees and one is what God sees so man see your works and God see your feet another inspiration the Holy Spirit that we have worked in a small measure a siscon from Chile this is right in me this is one Berman says the dynamics of this church will be a refiller of the Holy Ghost that we have worked in a small measure while the headstone is coming down to unite with the body so Gordo and expect us to sit down and just wheat know we have to work with the measure that God give us while you're waitin on dynamics why the written on the headstone to come down to your night with the body God given you a baptism of the Holy Ghost God given you a deposit God given you a downpayment go out giving you something that you could work with not to get three with that you go to overcome with that if it's can wait a power coming through your system while you're waitin for the fullness of what is promised for this hour you give us something to work with not to be lazy with the work with not to sleep away with to work with what you believe that amen so the dynamics is the Holy Spirit I already this morning ready for the word yeah look nobody sleeping all right let's go I'm gonna read two visions for a dream a dream this is butter bran I had a dream the other morning I don't retreat very often I'm not a dreamer I dream I seen a man a young fellow in shackles and he was trying to get out and somebody told me those are horrible people don't have nothing to do with them this is somebody talking that talk and I seen this young fella getting out of his shackles so I just let him alone I thought I see what he does when he got out he was a nice fellow and I seen in others trying to get out now this is only a dream and I walk over this way and I seen her brother Roy boarders very good friend of Mines lives in California look like something wrong his eyes was half closed maybe cancer or something over his eyes and someone was trying to pull me away from him ice cream butter borders in the name of the Lord Jesus snap out of that and he could just barely could speak saying but a Branham it will have to take something more than this I can't grasp it brother Branham I just can't grasp it I said oh brother borders I love him and someone pulled me away and I looked it was a lady standing over here when I was a little boy I used to haul groceries from the grocery store to the people's and the name was mrs. Fenton she lived in Gesell's Ville I pushed on friend to the wife and I and she said brother branham deliver us from this said this is the house of hell and said you have been misunderstood and said you miss understood these people too he said these are fine people and I look over there like a great big seller big walls don't need a great big cave great iron bars eight or ten inches thick and the people out of their mind twisting arms and legs beat in the head like that and she was crying scene deliver the people brother branham she's a help us we in trouble she herself I know her she belongs I believe she's the Church of Christ Christian Church coach of brethren I looked around I said I wish I could and go on looking wrong my little bitty buddy and them great big iron bands and those poor people in there and you couldn't get to them then on buses in close together I looked and there they were beatin the head like that out of their mind and I seen some lights flickering wrong in there and I looked up and dears to the Lord Jesus a lights of rainbow around him he was looking right straight to me and said deliver those people and he went away still in the vision people are asking for deliverance here comes Jesus rain more wrong and tell the Prophet deliver those people and he walk away and I taught well well how can I live in him I haven't got strength enough in my arms to break those bonds so I said house of hell give way to the name of Jesus Christ and all the creaking and popping and rocks rollin and the bass fallen and the people running screaming delivered and screaming at the top of their voice and was all delivered he misunderstood those people those people misunderstand him but it was the house of hell there were nice people but in the house of hell but they're all of deliverance had come and caught all the profit you deliver [Music] you freedom has that all around where we wanna see the manifestation of the sons of God when God by the Holy Spirit could say deliver them also have not Jesus the Son or can the Lord I show you are going to be delivered if you're in the hosts of hell they're gonna be delivered you are going to be delivered this morning [Applause] glory to God hallelujah all of them delivered screaming at the top of the voice we were delivered and I was screaming then but a boy waters where you where you God is delivering his people all glory of God when you're overcome brother you're come there is enough petals and hell to stop you from coming out of your prison from coming after your sickness from your condition the devil right the top one people we have a right to cast them out and we are here as smaller than cast all them dollars the back of the Philistines Oh glory the God do you love that vision last time I was here preach a vision to you also about the rain coming under under siege crime sent us the rain sent us arena and so on and we said to you that's dustier the Lord the problem is not the rain the challenge will be what seed inside of you the rain is coming nobody can stop the rain no minister no elder no deacon no pastor no that nobody is gonna stop the rain the seed has been planted and the rain is gonna fall your concern is to get the seed inside of you because that rain but the Brinton life or what's inside of you all the potential is already in the seed every trees and the seed every fruit is an achene every virtue is in the seed the life is in the seed under secret is the word is in the brain well all these years we have been pumping that word and sorry you who did not see it inside of you your flesh this way your flesh that way but we are not preaching to your flesh because you are not the believer your flesh is not a believer the faith in you that's the believer look there's a lot of show come on yes open that you may be seated these are not my words and I'm not talking my own thoughts but I'm said that you are not a believer the faith in you that's the believer when did you get that faith in you God put that in you way back before you had a child before you copy your mortgage boy our bills and problem under car crash and this happen and it wasn't a hospital I'm just having an up [Applause] [Music] [Applause] if I could only get you to change your mind you would leave here with your miracle [Applause] did you hear what I said you would leave here with your miracle you wouldn't leave it on the table you were take that with you you don't have permission to access it as yours healing as yours deliverance as yours rich you as yours [Applause] not a vision and this is missing former what is the vision and Berta Brannan was told not to see nothing about what the Lord tell him what to do he did it explained to ministers and so on how to fish and he either was teaching him and as we move into the realm of the spirit there the lessons that we have to learn there the instructions that we have to follow because we have not been this way before so there's a new process because David didn't just go and feels Goliath he had been lion now was it treinen to face Goliath so whatever droppable at and you he has to give you the training to take it from phase 1 to phase 2 from phase 2 to phase 3 to deal with your issues and that is why I say go take adopted sons the back of the Philistines they thought I can check beside them as easy ones but this fella senses them is big-time demons so you need a little more power to deal with them guys call these Philistines like them personal demons terrorizing you but they have the backup yeah hasta back up because becoming to know who we are and who we are [Applause] [Music] [Applause] all glory of God don't touch don't touch God sons that's not my anointed and do my prophets don't go there don't go there not in this new season the water that's not my anointed do my prophets no Tom don't [Applause] oh hell yeah the business this is the angel because Balarama explained to them and the s-line stipend what not so then the injured they're gonna talk to him understand this one who have been talking behind me step along in front of me it was him the angel of the Lord he had his hands folded he looked at me just what I told you not to do I said yes that's right he said you see that first pearl was when you used to put your hands on the people tell them what there was there trouble he said the second pull is when you know the secrets of the heart like I told you and instead of you keeping that to yourself you try to explain all about it and tell the people and when you did said you didn't know nothing about it yourself how could you explain it they not man talking out is the angel talking to him you ain't even know about it yourself how you can explain it how could you explain it and you caused a big bunch of colonel impersonation to rise up you see what you have done I said so Lord I'm sorry I said I'm so sorry I don't know what to do and I was pulling the line like this I was trying to straighten my line out he looked at me and said no don't get your line tying it up in these kind of times and I thought well maybe he's gonna give me another try and I said I'll sure be careful I was winding my line in unseen taking all up right and when he said I just felt myself go higher so now was this was one level and then got break him at the next level now he goes higher listen to this now and I was sat down and was beneath standing above a great tent I never seen such a tent and I just made an altar call seem like dung at the altar when I was young there I looked there were hundreds of people standing around the altar weeping because they were accepted the Lord Jesus and they were just weeping out loud I said oh that's more like it and a real kind gentleman walk off to the platform and said while butter bottom is resting for a few moments he said we will call a prayer never want my prayer cards beginning with a certain number sound over on the right I noticed the prayer line seemed like it went all re wrong the tenth and looked on the street was a prayer line and I looked which was to my left then okay there was a piece of canvas stretched behind this canvas was a little square buildin about twelve foot across 20 foot long something like that and I still had look at that so he's seen in a vision he's in a building about 20 by 12 foot across I see them bringing a lady on a stretcher there was a lady taking a name and things on the people and someone come and got her and push a true and the next man come true with crutches and I see them go to that at the building and on the outside the lady come out screamin to the top of a boy's cushion is this stretcher and then there was another lady on the other side looked like some dark here woman said what happened she said I don't know she said I couldn't tell you what happened I've been paralyzed for 20 years and I feel like I was never was sick and then I'll come the man leaping and jumping with his crutches in his hand and then notice no there's a difference between the angel of the Lord and that light because I heard something moving that it comes on a platform and the fire whipping around and that audience went over and went over to the top of that in the building so the pillar of fire went over the top of the building and then settle on top of it and when it did this voice that was telling me said the same voice the angels voice he said I'll meet you in there and this is the temple and nobody will know nothing about it I said well I don't understand why India why dear he said it wouldn't be a public show this time I said I don't understand going into that closet like that and he said now watch this this is a vision and look how the angel gonna put the vision in the world he's a tall honest I'm this closet he said no what he said is not yet written by Lord window Prius be not like the hypocrites who like to be heard before men but enter into the secret closet and pray to the father who see it in secret and he who sees in secret shall reward thee openly it's perfectly to the scripture every time and then I said I understand then he took me to a place set me down in this room where I was at then he told me what to do for the to time so this vision so if we might think in not comparing or not connecting but you're getting dots together connected but this vision of this little room the angels sink it right back into the scripture when you pray go in your closet and the father who see it in secret going to reward you not in secret but openly say openly openly so if you want the open blessing you have to go in the secret closet we call another a table closet that won't be a project that gonna be you speaking Xhosa he'll give way to the name of Jesus Christ you're gonna come with that closet with the voice given oh come on that closet with the word a word for your loved ones I work for your family I work the sickness diseases they will come under that closet or chlorine abroad hallelujah hallelujah marina coordinate hallelujah [Applause] and all this fate people say the tough and they think they have your feet going to be expressed by your works if there is no works you have no feet the only warm in a church bench praise God you're not here to warm a church bench you have to express by your words it will demonstrate the faith that you have and what one has promised go give the Lord a shout hallelujah so today I want to issue a challenge to you the believers the call of prayer meeting here in your home husband and wives if you're married husband a wife two pre together not one in this room and one in that room we're not talking about that if your wife is a humble evil unbeliever that's a different thing but I'm talking about husband and wife to pray together and then pray for each other husband prefer white white prefer husband then pray together and if that is happen if one don't want to pray for the other and so on in this church come to me the pasta and we will tell the church and pray for them all glory we mean that we can become to shake up things and break up thing hallelujah glory that God don't tell me a fine time Saturday

showing him he believed it but when he went to act him I thought it was already done - what man saw when it ran the script they say that man is crazy his wife is wrong and he is to all but he was acting on the promise by his works through him he believed Isaac was coming and if you believe Isaac is coming if you believe the Holy Ghost was coming he went to act like it you gonna satisfy
