[25:53] first Thessalonians for one verse verse
[25:56] seven and first Peter chapter 1 verse 13
[26:00] to 23 so we read Romans 8:28 and we know
[26:08] that all things work together for good
[26:10] to them that love God to them what he
[26:13] called countries purpose for me did
[26:16] foreknow he also did predestinate to be
[26:20] conformed to the image of his son that
[26:22] he might be the firstborn among many
[26:24] brethren over whom he did predestinate
[26:26] them he also called whom he called them
[26:30] he also justified anomie justified them
[26:34] he also glorified
[26:35] what shall we then cease these things
[26:38] they've got before us who can be against
[26:41] us we live from 1st Thessalonians
[26:43] chapter 4 verse 7 for God hath not
[26:50] called us unto uncleanness but unto
[26:54] holiness on our last scripture from 1st
[26:57] Peter chapter 1 verse 13 it reads thus
[27:00] we have forked up the loins of your mind
[27:03] be sober and hope to the end for the
[27:06] Greece that is to be brought unto you at
[27:08] the revelation of Jesus Christ as
[27:11] obedient children not fashioning
[27:14] yourselves according to the former lusts
[27:16] in your ignorance and that not fashion
[27:21] illness do not conform yourselves to
[27:22] evil desires that govern you in your
[27:26] former ignorance when you did not know
[27:28] the requirements of the gospel verse 15
[27:32] but as he which had called you is holy
[27:33] so be holy in all manner of converts
[27:38] and that would conversation is all
[27:40] manner of conduct and manner of living
[27:43] as a mean of conversation of poor but if
[27:46] with 17 but if he call on the father who
[27:49] without respect of persons judgeth
[27:52] according to every man's work pass the
[27:56] time here of your surgeon in here in
[28:00] fear and the amplifying have that if you
[28:03] call upon him your father who judges
[28:07] each one impartially according to what
[28:10] he does then you should conduct yourself
[28:12] with true reverence throughout the time
[28:15] of your temporary residence on earth
[28:20] whether long or short for as much was 18
[28:25] as you know that you were not redeemed
[28:26] with corruptible things as silver and
[28:28] gold from your vain conversation
[28:29] received by the tradition of your
[28:31] father's but with the precious blood of
[28:33] Christ as of a lamb without blemish
[28:35] without spot who verily was foreordained
[28:38] before the foundation of the world but
[28:40] was manifest in these last thanks to you
[28:42] by who by him do believe in God that
[28:46] raised him up from the dead and give Him
[28:48] glory that your faith and hope might be

[29:08] forever may God bless his word you may
[29:11] be seated or praise the name of the Lord
[29:13] I have a context scripture from
[29:16] Ephesians 1 and you know it blessed be
[29:18] the God and father of our Lord Jesus
[29:19] Christ so blessed us with all spiritual
[29:21] blessings in heavenly places in Christ
[29:24] Odin as he has chosen us in him before
[29:25] the foundation of the world that we
[29:27] should be holy without blame before him
[29:29] in love having predestinated us unto the
[29:33] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[29:36] himself according to the good pleasure
[29:37] of his will to the praise of the glory
[29:39] of His grace where it he admit as
[29:41] accepted and beloved in whom we have
[29:44] redemption through his blood the
[29:45] forgiveness of sins according to the
[29:47] riches of His grace God would is
[29:49] wonderful God would is true could we see

[29:56] predestinated according to foreknowledge
[29:59] predestinated according to foreknowledge
[30:03] again I want you to leave the church
[30:05] tonight get away from yourself your past
[30:07] your feelings your fears and your own
[30:09] thinking and just see if you could just
[30:11] receive what is being spoken tonight
[30:13] because this have to lodge in your soul
[30:15] in your mind in your spirit also this
[30:18] Sunday was really powerful
[30:19] amen what you look what do you see oh
[30:22] praise it all depends upon what you're
[30:24] looking for but the Prophet said
[30:26] predestination looks back to
[30:27] foreknowledge
[30:27] I mean lection looks back to
[30:29] foreknowledge and predestination looks
[30:31] to destiny don't forget that election
[30:34] looks back there I was a cockapoo I was
[30:36] born in sin shaped iniquity how many
[30:38] were speaking lies born among sinners
[30:40] father and mother whole family sinners I
[30:42] was a cockapoo
[30:43] all of a sudden I become a weak green
[30:45] how did it happen what was it
[30:49] election God before the foundation of
[30:52] the world elected that the cocklebur was
[30:54] to become a grain of wheat no I know I'm
[30:57] a grain of wheat because I am saved how
[31:00] do I do it look back and see what he
[31:02] predestinated it a long time ago by
[31:04] foreknowledge is seen I would love him
[31:07] so he made appropriation to his own son
[31:10] and chew him I might become a macaque
[31:13] able to agree no BT where am I now I am
[31:16] saved I am walking in the grace of God
[31:19] what does predestination look to destiny
[31:22] where will he take me to where am I
[31:24] going there you are Oh hallelujah
[31:28] according as he has chosen us in him
[31:30] before the function in the world so what
[31:33] I feel like picking people no God is not
[31:35] no picking people so you may as well get
[31:38] out your flesh and accept the reality
[31:40] that if you are chosen you would
[31:43] before the foundation of the world it
[31:46] has nothing to interferes it has nothing
[31:48] to with your paths and I've nothing to
[31:50] with your feelings it has nothing to do
[31:52] with your emotions it have everything to
[31:55] do with what God has said Oh blessed be
[31:58] the name of the Lord having
[32:00] predestinated the US and adoption listen
[32:03] of children by Jesus Christ himself
[32:06] according to the good pleasure of his
[32:08] will what did he do by foreknowledge he
[32:11] foresaw us knowing that he was a savior
[32:14] there was no ins as he was Elohim and so
[32:16] forth and when he started by
[32:18] foreknowledge he looked on he saw
[32:20] everyone that would accept it and by
[32:22] doing so to save that the only way I can
[32:24] do it will be come down myself and we
[32:27] made flesh take the set of man upon him
[32:29] and dive him that I might be the one
[32:32] that is worshipped so at the end of the
[32:35] day we have to come back to that same
[32:37] worship because I said what make him God
[32:39] you can sit in your unbelief you're not
[32:41] bullshitting you can't step in y'all
[32:43] have a pity party you not worship Him
[32:45] you have the second your sickness you
[32:47] not worship Him you worship and
[32:49] regardless because we know why we
[32:51] worship we know what we worship we know
[32:54] who we worship whoa glory that God is
[32:57] not right he came down on take upon
[32:59] himself why did he did that he did that
[33:02] that he might save you who wants to be
[33:04] saved so in his foreknowledge he saw
[33:07] people wanted to be saved and the only
[33:09] reason for them to be safe is to come
[33:11] down to make appropriation for their
[33:13] sins and their failures and that's why
[33:16] he could say openly and Romans 8:28 and
[33:18] we know that all things work together
[33:20] for good to them that love God that they
[33:23] already called according to his purpose
[33:25] because they play me we can see it
[33:27] confidently because they because of what
[33:30] the devil throw on you all things will
[33:32] put together for your good never do

[58:42] soul
[58:43] now listen recloser this remark but a
[58:45] man of faith no don't forget this now
[58:48] faith is designed to see what God wills
[58:52] and wants
[58:55] there is no knowledge can do that so
[59:01] that is why a man of faith is so
[59:04] inspired because he's not going with
[59:08] knowledge sense people know what is to
[59:11] be but they don't have the faith in what
[59:13] is to be the children of Israel they're
[59:16] not knowledge sense Michael laughs was
[59:17] concerned they were seeing knowledge
[59:20] from who is big to face Goliath who has
[59:23] muscles who long in battle who qualified
[59:26] that was knowledge information by sight
[59:30] but David wasn't in that at all as he
[59:34] heard Sunday David even studied him and
[59:35] sighs he just parmesan circumstance he's
[59:39] always that uncircumcised philistine
[59:43] define the army David never saw his eyes
[59:46] he saw the fact he wasn't covenanted to
[59:49] be in that land he any wrong place
[59:52] he on my land you're my territory
[59:55] because I am tolerant okay the Lord I
[59:58] show and when you begin to see that you
[1:00:01] are covenant it by this blood of Jesus
[1:00:03] you are being purchased by the blood of
[1:00:07] Jesus then that give you the vine right
[1:00:10] the plaster Devils the same noses enough
[1:00:15] [Applause]
[1:00:16] [Music]
[1:00:17] [Applause]
[1:00:23] fit is designed to see what God wills Oh
[1:00:29] Harlan there was no knowledge can do
[1:00:32] that it alone is designed and gifted a
[1:00:37] human race to find out what the will of
[1:00:39] God is and you take your fear that you
[1:00:41] cut and it don't focus with the world
[1:00:43] leave it alone they've got the wrong
[1:00:45] fate so your fate and supposed to come
[1:00:48] back with the feelin look at Abraham go
[1:00:49] tell Abram off up Isaac on a mountain I
[1:00:52] will show you
[1:00:52] and when Jordan tell him when he reached
[1:00:55] was at this one
[1:00:56] I'm Abram snip off of his camel or
[1:00:59] whatever I said I and the lad we go up
[1:01:01] and and the lad we're coming back down
[1:01:06] you know we're talking that knowledge
[1:01:09] talking in that is pure faith talking
[1:01:11] then they climb up the mountains

[1:04:06] ages upon the earth she was redeemed by
[1:04:09] his blood and can never comment the
[1:04:11] condemnation
[1:04:12] we read that to you last Wednesday she
[1:04:15] can never come into condemnation she can
[1:04:18] never be in judgment because sin cannot
[1:04:20] be imputed to her and it's a scripture
[1:04:23] for that Romans for if blessed is the
[1:04:25] man who the Lord will not impute sin
[1:04:27] [Applause]

[1:05:18] even on that if we live right that
[1:05:22] doesn't mean that they are immune from

[1:05:26] troubles are directed our way for many
[1:05:30] are the afflictions righteous you see

[1:10:06] Paul what did he do when they are even
[1:10:08] less of a tree yes the study scripture
[1:10:10] to get the vindication and evidence by
[1:10:12] scripture of this light that struck him
[1:10:14] he wasn't with pizza he wasn't with all
[1:10:16] them guys Andrew wasn't like Jesus he
[1:10:18] was with all of that but when he
[1:10:19] combined comical revelation they catch
[1:10:22] challenge that the court that call him
[1:10:24] call him be caught and for knew them for
[1:10:26] knew him
[1:10:27] I'm pre-decimal him to be a right start
[1:10:30] to be an apostle now prophet to the
[1:10:32] Gentiles I'm positive any man take
[1:10:35] himself to be spiritual let him
[1:10:37] acknowledge what I say

[1:22:44] Branham is it true that every Jew born
[1:22:46] since Christ will be schemes that will
[1:22:48] be saved who are 144,000 how dare he
[1:22:52] predestinated wants to be seen with Holy
[1:22:54] Ghost and what is the mission there were
[1:22:57] three questions in one here first one is
[1:22:59] it true that every Jew born since Christ
[1:23:01] came into the world is to be saved
[1:23:03] answer no nothing will be saved only
[1:23:09] those whose names are put on the Lamb's
[1:23:11] Book of Life before the phone isn't
[1:23:13] world Jew or Gentile that is all the
[1:23:18] book holds the mystery and the book is
[1:23:21] only unfolding it now not each one's
[1:23:25] name but what the mystery
[1:23:27] of the book is why this is calling those
[1:23:29] names the book doesn't say only villains
[1:23:34] to be saved or my Neville no it doesn't
[1:23:37] say that it just shows the mystery it
[1:23:39] unfolds the mystery of what the thing is
[1:23:40] but we ourselves my faith believe it
[1:23:44] [Applause]
[1:23:47] someone said well there's no need of me
[1:23:49] trying butter brown said there's only
[1:23:51] one so he said it or if there's only one
[1:23:54] to be safe of Justin see no it should
[1:23:57] enough power but that isn't it that
[1:23:59] isn't that there might be thousands
[1:24:00] saying I don't know I hope everyone
[1:24:01] haven't seen I don't know but here is
[1:24:04] the way I want to believe it I am that
[1:24:05] one hope to believe it if there's one
[1:24:10] live in this church or say I am that one
[1:24:11] [Applause]
[1:24:12] [Music]
[1:24:16] so know Christ and the church has just
[1:24:19] been made known the whole thing is a
[1:24:20] revelation of God to take Eve back to
[1:24:22] right position again with a husband
[1:24:24] notice God is the husband of the church
[1:24:26] and the church is his bride
[1:24:28] now when Peter said flesh and blood
[1:24:30] don't want the Christ under one God he
[1:24:32] said no that's that's Peter the
[1:24:34] predestinated seed of God had received
[1:24:37] this light and given the keys to the
[1:24:39] kingdom and she had a punished rock of
[1:24:41] revelation of who Jesus is
[1:24:43] he is the full manifested God upon this
[1:24:47] rock I will build my church and the case
[1:24:49] of hell shall never shake it down I will
[1:24:51] build my church upon this rock what is
[1:24:53] it a revelation of Jesus Christ not a
[1:24:57] revelation of this tabernacle or the
[1:24:58] pasta a revelation of who that's the
[1:25:01] rocky building mystery charm so that's
[1:25:03] its revolution let's continue well

[1:25:23] the revelation still holds it's not a
[1:25:25] revelation of a man it's the revelation
[1:25:27] of Jesus Christ

[1:25:33] is the frizzy you have a revelation or

[1:32:32] decreed season as each member came for
[1:32:34] and become Express and took his place on

[1:32:43] feminine and designation she is called
[1:32:45] the body of Christ it is very apparent
[1:32:47] she ought to be called that for she was
[1:32:49] predestinated in him and came from the
[1:32:52] same source was he settled with him and
[1:32:54] there's no manifest and court in a many
[1:32:57] membered body whereas one score was
[1:32:59] manifested in one member even the Lord
