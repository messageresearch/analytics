church in fighting all and attributed arcades the faith of the fathers is living still in spite of isis in spite of the horde of hell that is upon the face of the earth faith of the fathers is living

praise god praise god praise god oh glory we are praise god maybe see that never in an age nevertheless has satan encountered a people like this last day people he thought he had his best to keep us trapped it could be so bad the bible said that god will shorten the days for the electic not for any anybody to elect sick that means there's a bunch of people that god see as the elect on the earth nothing could stop her nothing could interrupt her nothing could interfere with her she is the elect she is the predestinated she's the called out she's the foreknown of god that has nothing to do with your backsliding that has nothing to do with what happened in your past life that has nothing to do who he followed he called who he called oh my god i'm not the preacher this morning but i feel inspired this morning i feel on fire this morning i want to have the churches on fire may god put fire in your seat now for the good manners want to welcome aj roberts invited by sister vivian god bless you welcome get ahead soon tabernacle praise the name of the lord amen we'll just stand for a scripture just a few words before the preacher come but eyes are going to preach you this morning blessed be the name of the lord you're going to bless it this morning matthew 15 reading from 21-28 then jesus rendez and departed in the coast of tyre and sidon and behold a woman of canaan came out of the same coast and cried unto him saying have mercy on me o lord thou son of david my daughter is grievously vexed with the devil and he answered turn out a word no response no reply and his disciples came and we saw them saying send her away for he cried after us but he answered and said i am not sent but unto the lord sheep of the house of israel then came she and worshiped him saying lord help me but he answered and said it is not meat to take the children's bread and cast it to dogs and she said truth lord get the dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their master's table then jesus answered and said unto her oh woman greatest thy face be it unto thee even as thou wilt and her daughter was made whole from that very hour let us pray father we thank you for these few scriptures being read just before the minister come to minister us the ungrafted word of god we pray that lord this thought would engrave in the people's heart i may be blessed and made whole in jesus name i ask it amen you may be seated this morning just for the tour before the minister come i want to speak about the right attitude amen i want to share some things with you that would help you trust will bless you and encourage you in your approach to god prayer service word whatever station whatever comes to you in life it truly pays to have the right attitude the wrong attitude will get you would not get you the right results i'll say that way the wrong attitude will not get you the results you would like this is by the brand of 1950 you said all right are you the patient speaking of somebody before i take a hold of your hand i want to talk to you a little bit because you're just a little nervous kind of upset like i want to get you in the right attitude of god mentally speaking towards god promised before i pray for you i wanted to pray for her but he wanted to have a certain attitude listen to this one next one i watch him on the platform sometime in the healing service i watch the attitude they come in the other night remember the lady come with enough why didn't have enough feet hardly to get to the platform she'd been in prayer line after prayer line i know the woman wasn't going to get well i seen her coming up here i knew it wasn't she didn't have the right attitude when she come up to get well she can't do it i said lord jesus bless your sister go may he heal you that's all i could say but it's not here she she's been here and there and everywhere but you got to take god at his word oh hallelujah so he could see people's attitude he could see how they come into church he could see it so make an appearance is not good enough [Applause] make an appearance a church member they appear in church pop that's not good enough now that you are here what next i'm not hearing you not that you're here what next because the woman she made her parents and said lord my daughter is sex with the devil that's good he said he didn't answer a word disciple said send her away please because she harassing us she's crying after us then she come and worship hallelujah she's trying something she's worshiping her lord help me and jesus response was it's not fit to take the children's bread and cast it to dogs now if that woman didn't have a real substance didn't have something real she'd take off after that and make a whole big rap tell the neighbors get newspapers twitter it tweet it whatever it is put it on facebook she name it she doesn't have a lot of problems but a woman stood aground she stood right there i'm not moving said i'm not moving praise god say it they said i'm not moving see i'm not tell somebody i'm not moving tell them i'm not moving oh praise god she stood her ground so grunge was the word she knew that that man standing there was the right man she knew he had the power to do what she wanted done she know her daughter was vexed with the devil her daughter didn't have a toothache the dentist could see about that the doctor didn't have a headache panadol and caffeine or whatever that could take care of that but this daughter was vexed with the devil that's spirit business that that means more than than some medical disease that needs something more you see when the devils have the right it needs power it needs virtue it needs something more than you prepare to deal with praise god and when that comes on the scene you may as well have the right attitude because the bright attitude will produce the right result and we want the right result this morning god expect results god expect to be deadly italian with his people he hit the people that to know their god to be strong and to get exploits god expect us to be delivering people setting people free breaking the plans of wickedness healing raising the dead causing a revival god expects something from his people not sitting on the premises but standing on the promises because somebody's saying amen not grumpy and all kind of upset and mean and nasty that's not what god want god want the right attitude and the right attitude towards any promise that god has made will bring it to pass you can sit there and not be healed when you have the right attitude for your healing god is obligated because he's the same yesterday today and forever we're not preaching no fairytale gospel we are preaching a living gospel a gospel that could deliver you and free you and set you free amen oh glory you may be seated look at next one here jesus christ here jesus christ heal the woman she can go home and be happy see why you're going to be because you come in the right attitude no one ever come to christ in the right attitude but won't went away for what he asked for oh praise god the word is a seed the seed won't grow unless it's placed in the right kind of a ground and no matter how much seeds you got if you're afraid if the seed will do you no good but listen to this every word of god is a seed and every promise of god will come to pass if you will receive it and don't doubt it and can place it in your heart and believe it come from god and water with faith it will bring forth of this time don't never forget this statement i make this on my heart the right mental attitude towards any divine promise of god will bring it to pass listen that woman was so good with her words she chose the right words when jesus said i is not fit the dick the terence brother the cast of the dog she will truth lord in other words amen all you do want to say amen you have to say amen to the word once the word speak to you say amen praise god holla you may not even understand just say amen she will truth lord but even the doors get the crowns of the master's table that was the right words she said the right thing she had the right attitude he said woman great is your faith that faith knocked heaven and heaven knocked that demon plumb off of a daughter you hear what i said jesus didn't even have to pray the woman's faith hit heaven and heaven [Applause] knocked the devil off her daughter he said for this same your daughter is made whole and is there anybody here who want to be made whole praise god you messed up psychology psychologically and messed up in your mind you're messed up in your spirit but god wants to make you whole it's great to be whole you feel good about who you are you feel good about what god said you are you feel great about the promises of god you feel good about god's people they are the best people to be among your lord you feel great about coming to church [Applause] any time you have fighting commercial fight i fight him to come to church but there's no fight did they even start yet that's why i see a reach then what what you're going to get from when you come are you going to waste this time because you're going to be doing something else this morning you could be fishing you could be going to market this morning you could be washing clothes this morning or going for a long drive to relax your mind but you come to church this morning no you just want a competition from the church you want to come and choose to get something you want to make a withdrawal from the bank all this money here all this money and you coming talking to the teller all the telling it is a signature come on anything you ask in my name you didn't hear me this morning everybody should be screaming that one you yelled at anything you ask hang the form in my name shall be given unto you i'm not hearing you this morning oh i'm about to get out of here but anything you ask that's the position god wants the church to be in to ask anything your wife have crack you ask anything you have crack you ask anything something wrong with your family you ask anything something wrong with your body you ask anything some of the doctors give up but you can ask anything because all things are possible to them [Applause] glory hallelujah not some things are possible but all things are possible jesus demonstrated it you may be seated demonstrated it to a crowd of five thousand was hungry and all you have is five loads and two fishes and he didn't make no big fuss and said oh fish hear me those divide and multiply as my words said no no drama just took them bless them believe in what he was blessed believe in the power you see that's the problem we we lost the faith to believe you want to see everything first you want this you want that but faith is the substance of what you're hoping for faith is the evidence of what your eyes have not seen and challenge you to believe things that you never thought was possible oh glory to god you know what i'm believing for this morning a dynamic holy ghost revival i'm believing this morning for god to take the minister into such an atmosphere like you have never been in there before i may be leaving for the glory of god to fill this church that the minister won't be able to minister because of the glory of god he said the attitude is what brings the results see after me the attitude is what brings the results say it again the attitude is what brings the results oh hallelujah people touching jesus and getting nothing but one woman said if i could just touch not him just the helm of his gun i've been made whole her money ran out she had a blood issue i mean this i mean when you have your money you pay your money but when the money ran out you have no more money so she's desperate now she told herself she was speaking to herself some of you didn't talk to yourself but the devil talking to you [Music] talk to yourself go in front of the mirror talk to yourself tell yourself in the mirror you're gonna make it yourself in the mirror you're gonna be delivered you i'm looking at you yes you you know i see people doubting that look in the mirror and talk to the man that you see tell that man that he's going to be filled with the holy ghost tell that man in the mirror that he's going to be free i remember finish the woman told herself told herself if i could just touch the hem of his garment at home now i know who people are they want to see jesus with the garment on waiting for you to touch there's nobody else around that's what you dreamed last night that's what you're praying for but when you come just you and jesus alone i'll be standing on the platform there'll be nobody around you just walk up and touch and you'll be healed no that's good but that dream wasn't right that was only a dream forget it not all dreams are right when she came to this jesus you're looking for was a crowd around him she had a choice boy pressure boy traffic jam too much of people on the road too much of people around him i'm going back home no she came for purpose that was in her heart nobody was going to stop her from there she told herself not her husband told her not she had a personal revelation inspiration and fate that she was going to be healed and these guys who just watching wondering and just looking they have nothing to do with what was in her heart so she said excuse me the first man gave her a room make another one already and excuse me with that the second monster where i look into but that wasn't stopping her she pushed she crawled under the legs she was pushing because she had to get you can't say if i could touch and you're like it's a kind of virtual touch you know i mean you know this is not this this nothing's gonna touch you know you have to literally touch there's not no of a um computer touch thing you know this is you have to get there and when you have to get somewhere you begin to journey so she began to push and press god set it up that way god love it that way he wants you to go against the tide he wants you to believe something and have the power to move past your circumstance and move past your situation and move past your your family and move past your natural environment you pass all your heard and move past all of that and get to where you're going guess what when she touch him jesus say i just felt a withdrawal i just felt vote you left me who who touched my clothes [Applause] [Music] disciples about everybody touching you he said no no no no this one touch was different i felt a power left me that's the ministry of jesus christ that is what these ministers don't have that is what this promise they have to have a power moving out a power oozing out a power leaking out a power getting out that's the power of christ in the church could somebody give a big shout on that one [Applause] notice what jesus didn't say a mystery leave me a hidden one a teaching no unfold from me i'm feeling turkish doesn't help any woman you know she has another talk you know she just dropped from the bank she come with already signed and they tell her how to stamp it ah let's release virtue my god is faith talking his faith asking his faith releasing virtual power once paid uh once fed one's faith is presented power i have to ah that's what we're talking about you're signing a signature with faith in it then you have got to get that retro nobody could hold that back that's the right attitude it's going to bring the right result god said so oh hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to god i'm going to close with this [Music] man going 38 years to the pool 30 years and he know he can't make it can people better than him always get in front but that is supporting after 25 years somebody said wasting your time winter service going to church believe in those promises he said i mean but you see but faith telling me one day think about it now 38 years repeatingly coming and um somebody always stepping in front of him in the pool to be healed because angel used to come and trouble the water anybody coming first will be healed the man can't make it first he had to ask somebody help who i want to win for you so nobody want to help him but he's not coming oh i'm coming i'm coming he was persistent he was perseverant he had no giving up in him he had no i go underneath us i want to stop this and stop that i can't take this no more no he was going because you know his wife has to be delivered he was coming because you know his children hadn't delivered he was still pressing on because he know he had to be healed so he was not giving up he that wasn't his testimony he know god is able he's there to do it yet but he is here [Applause] 38 months no 38 years here come jesus bypassing this one bypassing that one because god must tell jesus by vision there's a man that pressing on for so long today is his day and i feel there is somebody inside of here let me get out of here there is somebody inside of here looking for a bridge there is somebody that's on the internet somebody hooked up looking for a special touch that patch is coming to you this morning oh glory to god glory to god let's stand and worship him in a little bit as we invite jesus to the pulpit oh glory to god glory to god glory to god let's let you in all through it all that's one score is that you read all a little trust in jesus threw it on [Music] i've learned to trust in jesus i've learned to trust hallelujah [Music] [Music] oh [Music] and i learned [Music] to depend upon his word one more time everybody learn to trust in jesus and i learn to trust [Music] upon his word can we get the lord and the praise this morning thank you musicians heavenly father lord we thank you for your august presence here we thank you for the lord will that has already gone forth lord the people are already blessed lord we want to bring the church before you lord and bring every believer bring everyone connected on the internet we want to pray for all the young people who have exams coming up that you be with everyone lord from sca to cxc to the different uh exams may you be with them lord now as we approach your word father may you anoint me this morning may you take me completely out of the way and speak to your people lord may you bring great deliverance in your house this morning father me you set the captives free if there's anyone sick this morning may you heal this morning if there's a backslider here this morning may you restore this morning if there's unsaved in the house lord may they be saved this morning if there's anyone desiring the baptism of the holy ghost on fire may this be that kind of a service father may as the word goes forth father lord may it cut through the bone and the marrow and bring such liberty to your people to forget about the world forget about the distraction and to focus on calvary may you bless the word and the reading of the word today in the precious name of jesus christ and the church says amen so if you have your bibles this morning will you turn to me to one portion of scripture reading from the book of revelation chapter 22. i certainly appreciate the worship service this morning brother gideon may the lord bless you amen amen tremendous so reading revelation chapter 22 and reading from verse 10. when the bible says and he saith unto me seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book for the time is at hand he that is unjust let him be unjust still and he which is filthy let him be filthy still and he that is righteous let him be righteous still and he that is holy let him be holy still and behold i come quickly and my reward is with me to give every man according as his work shall be i am alpha and omega the beginning and the end the first and the last blessed are they that do his commandments that they may have right to the tree of life and may enter into the gates into the city for without or outside are dogs and sorcerers and hormones and murderers and idolaters and whosoever loveth and make it a lie i jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches i am the root and the offspring of david and the bright and morning star and the spirit and the bride say come and let him that herot say come and let him that is a thirst come and whosoever will let him take the water of life freely for i testify unto every man that heared the words of the prophecy of this book if any man shall add unto these things god shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book and if any man shall take away from the words of the prophecy of this from the words of the book of this prophecy god shall take away his part out of the book of life and out of the holy city and from the things which are written in this book he which testifieth these things say it surely i come quickly amen even so come lord jesus may the lord have a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated this morning i have a title this morning the identification of the true believers the identification of the true believers and my subject separating the word bride from the church members and my inspiration only the elect have the ability to hear from god and before i get to my text this morning we are here this morning to hear truth we are not here to play games we are not here to just gather we are here to hear the truth because only the truth will set you free the truth makes you free we're not here this morning to entertain we are not here this morning to make you feel nice or to to get you to feel so excited about your future but you are here to hear the whole truth because you need all of the truth to know where you are standing and as we draw nearer to the closing chapters of time and as we get narrow to the convention and we get nearer to judgment you have to know where you stand tonight you must know where you stand this morning and i believe the time has come for the true believers to be identified a lot of people believe that they are true believers and that is the problem a lot of people believe they are true believers and that is not the case because brother branham taught us in every church there are three kinds of believers and brother branham and preaching three kinds of believers he said he preached a message so that people can assess themselves to see where they stand [Music] i'm not here to assess you but you have to assess yourself by the word to see where you stand because only the true believer is going to make it only the true believers are going to go into the rapture only the true believers are going to get the holy ghost can the church say man some time ago when i was preaching the message rapturing condition a brother called me up after the service and said he had a problem with something i said because i made a statement not everybody in here is going to the rapture and he was troubled by it but that's what brother branham taught us i can lie to you and make you feel nice and say if you come to church you're going to go to the rapture the criteria is not coming to church going to the rapture is not based on attendance going to the rapture is not based on whose church you're in go to the rapture is not based on who your pastor is going to the raptor is based on you living the world can the church say man so i want to get down to some brass tacks this morning get down on the inside of the machinery this morning so that when you leave this service you're going to know exactly where you're standing you're going to know the truth and the truth will set you free so that if you're on the edge this morning you won't be on the edge no more i'm putting you on god this morning because the world is coming harder and harder and harder can the church say amen you may be seated i'm laying the background the bible says and brother branham used this scripture when he preached a message three kinds of believers he referred to john chapter 6 and john chapter 6 starts off with jesus looking around him and the people are hungry and he asks if anybody has anything and beloved spoke about it a young boy comes up with five loaves and two fishes that's john 6 and jesus blesses it and he breaks then he feeds the people later in john 6 he starts to say well this food you're eating is i come for a different purpose i am the bread of life and a little lower down jesus comes and begins to drill deeper he says except you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no pot you are not part of me john chapter 6 verse 6 he says and many therefore of his disciples when they had heard this said this is a who can hear it and people like to come to church and hear nice sayings but this morning we come to do some hard scenes and not everybody can hear it but it's for a reason because as jesus stood there he stood for a purpose because his church was too big and god wanted to separate the church members from the world bride oh you don't hear me this morning god was starting a separation in his church in jesus church at 82 people and when jesus said these words 70 7-0 walked away but the brandon typed those who walked away as the unbelievers they in the church and he said the unbelievers are those who have problems when the word comes forth they can't accept everything [Music] so when you have a problem accepting the word of god you know where you stand in this morning because the true believer accepts every word and acts on every word even if you don't understand it because the revelation of what jesus was speaking about was not being clear to them yet but the unbelievers say no that's too much for us we're going to walk away [Applause] we're going to drill down and say we're going to get deep friends this morning because you got to know exactly where you're standing if you cannot take the word by definition you are an unbeliever not some of the word but every word 70 walked away and jesus turned to his remaining 12 disciples and asked the question will you go also and brother peter said where can we go because you alone have the words you alone have this message you alone have this gospel you alone have signs and wonders you alone are rightly dividing the scriptures you alone are bringing spiritual food in due season you alone are raising the dead you alone are healing the sick you alone could call my name i thought my name was peter but i recognize i have a different name you don't hear me this morning you may be seated three kinds of believers were standing there on that day the seventy who had a problem when the word came forth the 70 who don't want to obey the word the 70 who want to come to church when they want to come to church the 70 who don't want to read their bible because brother branham brought out the unbelievers at those who were not taking all the word so they come to church when they want they read when they want they pray when they want they don't reference their husband it can be anything that you don't obey no wonder brother branham could say full obedience to the world will entitle you to the token [Applause] so there are people sitting down and message churches around the world today and the one thing they're not doing qualifies them as an unbeliever because they're using their own reasoning and their own thoughts and their own assessment this is a hard thing you want to get an easy saying it's all right do this dress this way if you left the world you can't be looking like the world if you left the world you can't be talking like the world if you left the world you can be acting like the world we want to make the church uncomfortable this morning for the unbelievers [Applause] because there must be a separation of the word pride with the church members because the unbelievers can go into the upper room to make believers cannot go into the upper room can the church say man so what are you saying with isaac yeah this is not the kind of shout for joy service a couple of weeks ago when brother preached data weighed upon the law that was a fiery service he can't be handed the next week and say every service can be fire fire fire fire is the word this morning is about the hard sayings about taking the world because the world comes to shape you to cut you to take on all the pieces that you may not even realize is there until all that's left is the word image not your idea not your interpretation all that's left is the word image all that's left is jesus christ all that's left is a living faith living virtue living knowledge living outside of that brother branham said you're wasting your time you may be seated it's one thing if you're living in alaska are you living on a mountain and you have no transport and you can't make it to church and you decide to connect on the internet but anybody who has access to fellowship and doesn't come to church unbeliever at home listening to tips reading books that's all right do that on your time but this year is god's time [Applause] hard sins dressing one way for church and dressing another way for work hard sayings but god will have a perfect church acting nice with the neighbors but acting like a rascal in your house with your family han sayings but it's a word there will be a separation of the word pride from the church members and god will force the issue because only the true believers can take the word and stand the test and god will turn the heat up tilling the heat up till the heat up turn the heat up until all the all that other stuff comes off for you can the church say amen it's easy listen you may be seated if you want to go and just jump and shout the pentecostal church has that but this is the age of the overcomer this is the age of the true believer who can take the word wait till their seven thunders utter their voices to that group who could take the word that's true believers and hand it there it'll slice and cut you may be seated don't shout manifestation until you could take the word and hand it there there will be no manifestation until you could take the word and hand it there until you could take correction until you could hear the word and say lord that's me cut me i've been guilty i've been lord i've been doing nonsense but this morning i'm coming back to call i'm getting away from unbelief i'm separating myself you are going to know the truth this morning and the truth is going to set you free that's what we came here you thought this was not you thought this was just another ordinary service but the truth is this is a different kind of service you thought you were going to come here and leave the same but the truth is you either want to get closer to god or further away from god but something's going to happen this morning you thought things in your life would never change but the truth is the holy ghost is here to bring change to bring change in your life you thought you'd always be sick up but the truth is that this morning healing is here you talk hallelujah hallelujah you may be seated you thought you need that friend in the world but the truth is once you have god you don't need nothing else because the test will come to see where you stand this morning can the church say man friends i'm not from the world i come from god and i'm going back to call i'm not here to have church i am tired of having church i'm looking to go into the rapture but only one group will make the rapture and that's the true believers no unbeliever will be there don't make believer will be there only the true believers will be there the hour now come that the true believers the true worshipers could worship the father in spirit and in truth i'm not talking about your past i'm not talking about your mistakes up peter made mistakes up but he made it to the upper rumor peter was a true believer can the church say mm i don't care if you fall down the true believers will be identified because they're gonna get back up again can the church say man don't just look at me say amen the true believers respond to the word i'm not speaking to how you feel i'm not speaking to what you did yesterday i'm speaking to the true believer the word seed inside of your soul the devil could watch you but he cannot touch you because greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world you are not a believer but the word seed in you that's the believer you couldn't miss this if you wanted to you had to be here because the true believers will be identified in this season hallelujah hallelujah somebody give god a shout out praise i'm not talking about the church i'm talking about the true believers we're going to get to the court but brother branham said god could only prove his word by believers are there any believers in the household you believe with all your heart you believe in all your soul but the penum said if you really believe god will give you the holy ghost up do we have any true believers any real believers this morning [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah [Music] hallelujah hard scenes this morning god had to get the church on track and 70 walked away and there was still a devil in the church it takes a revelation to rightly divide the unbeliever now understand this this unbeliever is not the world we're talking about you know this is people in the church in the church we're not talking about marshall montano and nicki minaj and these demonic people we are talking about in the church in the message three kinds of believers in the message people who still want to cut their hair still want to wear makeup still want to wear pants still want to listen to worldly music compromise on the word still put sports over god still put friendship over god still put their life and money over god those are the unbelievers in the church [Applause] in the church with no testimony that's why i said sometime over this week here that's why i said something you can't testify to anybody because you don't even have a testimony how could you tell somebody about jesus when you look like them talk like them act like them curse like them listen and you would tell them come to church they don't want to hear you you must do something different to have the ability to say you want to know why i am this way it's because jesus touched me it's when you live a life you have the opportunity to say yeah i don't smoke i don't drink i don't do it [Applause] the unbelievers are the easy ones to spot but you see the make-believers jesus said except you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no part for me and judah said hey [Music] and judas was a devil in the church make believer coming to every service paying his tithes the day before he get paid can find a fault with his testimony always in church an hour before the service no argument with nobody no you can't put a finger on him but you know what brother branham said the make-believer is when they compromise on one word they sit in the church reasoning analyzing they believe they are on track to where they're supposed to go but they miss just one word and brother branham said the make believers will show themselves because they cannot make it to the upper room but the branham said it was just when the break was going to take place judas had to expose himself so we are preaching a message point to begin to expose the unbelievers and make believers because there must be a separation of the word pride from the church members somebody's saying man but they ran him in the message the queen of sheba said now some people look at their symptoms my pastor prayed for me last night but my hands know better that has nothing to do with it if you are really a believer you don't even look at that it's already settled forever god healed you what if abraham would have looked that next month to see if sarah was going to have the baby he never noticed that he just noticed what god said and any true believer looks to the promise not what the symptoms are around them they look at what god said so i don't care this morning what your symptoms are your symptoms could be your children it could be your co-worker it could be your boss it could be a sickness it could be anything don't look at the symptoms don't look at the problem look to what god said that's what differentiates the true believers from the make-believer and the unbeliever they only look to what god said [Applause] you may be seated [Applause] in praying brother branham said and we know lord in the message who is this that thy church is not in the majority this morning the true believers are in the minority but someday lord you will take that minority to yourself is that's my prayer this morning that that minority could be taken up this morning can the church say amen in the message might hire the prophet but abandon said all true prophets all true christians all true believers stay with that word no matter what anybody says you stay right with the word they say the days of miracles is past don't you believe it for the bible said he's a same yesterday he is a seem to tame he is the same forever and this is this i mentioned it before improving his word but ibrahim said notice it was by his believers that he proves his word pride he can only prove his word not by unbelievers it's only by the believers that he can prove his word no matter how much of the rest of them claim to be or i believe see if you do god will prove it see it's by true believers that he proves his word not by those who say they believe but by those who really believe it's by his believing children that he proves his word so god is looking for some true believers this morning and he don't need much of them because one will put a thousand to fight two will put ten thousand of life listen i'm not preaching to the church this morning i'm preaching to the true believers you could have walked in this morning for the first time but if there's a true believing seed in your soul and you could take all this word then god could use you god to fill you god could change you [Music] but abram went on speaking about moses and caleb and joshua he said now he had believers the old crop had died off the unbelievers who said we couldn't take it he let every one of them perish every one of them bought the believers in other words god allowed the unbelievers to die out [Music] because he couldn't use them god not using your own belief in them we couldn't take it he let every one of them perish why every one of them but the believers who was left moses had been taken to glory and the unbelievers had perished in the wilderness and their people they have already perished in church you know but they already perished perished in the wilderness and this was their children who were going over they were the only two that cross over and that was the believers joshua and caleb there was the believers there was the one who crossed over it's the only way god can do it is by his believing children you believe that his believers was the one that do it and is the only way that god could do it is to find some believers so god is looking for somebody who could take all the word and believe all the world and can live all the world then he has somebody to work through are you getting it this morning i want to kneel down a few things and then we're going to be out of here from the message minion church age listen carefully but ibrahim said now those children of israel left egypt about 2 million strong they all journeyed together all saw the same miracles all part took of the same manner and water from the smitten rock all follow the same cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night but only two reach the promised land only two were true or real believers that's the prophet everybody coming to church everybody in the prayer meet him everybody reading the books everybody listen to the tapes two million people walked out of the world up and held to the promised land but only two were real believers that is correct because the word tells us that the rest died because of unbelief because unbelief could not enter in then since that is so but a random and only two entered then the rest were not true believers what made the difference two stayed with the world two stayed with the wood when the hearts of the ten spines filled at kiddis paneer joshua and caleb did not stagger for they believed the word and said we are more than able to take the land they knew they could because god had said it i have given you the land and all those israelites saw the power and the goodness and deliverance of god they did not enter into rest listen which is a type of the holy ghost so you can see right now that very few will ever believe all the way to receiving the spirit of god i'll say that again brother branham is now just speaking about believing he's talking about believing all the way to receiving the spirit of god and he typed it as the holy ghost so people have to believe all the way to receive the holy ghost and brother branham said any man supposed to say when you had an encounter with the holy ghost because brother branham when he was speaking about acts 19 he said it was literally translated as you after having believed did you get the holy ghost so you have to believe until something happens [Applause] and don't stop believing until something happens believe until something happens but the problem is a lot of people they don't want to wait they want to ask for it and when god says not yet because you don't have the character yet there's still some issues in your life listen you could cry for the holy ghost all you want until you clean up the areas of your life that's messed up you have no holy ghost to get because full obedience to the word to the full world entitles you to the holy ghost so people all over screaming lord kill me and god is saying you have the word why are you not in church on time why are you forsaking the assembling of yourselves together why are you not reading the bible why are you not praying until something happens then then then you're gonna get the holy ghost god is obligated if you stay with the world to give you the baptism of the holy ghost you may be seated god is no respecter of persons he doesn't respect pastors apostles he respects no person god only respects his word [Applause] i hope this service brings you to a rock solid revelation that playing games is over [Applause] you know disobeying one word could stop you from getting the holy ghost you don't reverence your parents the bible says honor your father and your mother that's a word so you're doing everything else and you're disrespecting your father disrespecting your mother no whole ego ghost coming in there [Applause] and the word that god gives you is word that you can live on because you have a choice you always have a choice god doesn't take that choice away from you on wednesday in the martin i spoke on the valley of decision from the book of joel multitudes in the valley of decision life is about choices you have a choice who your friends are you have a choice who you associate with you have a choice of what you make important in your life [Applause] and you must be prepared to accept the consequences of your choices [Music] you sit in debt or worshiping is a choice because worshipping is not based upon you worship is based upon god being who he is worship is not based on how your day was yesterday and what happened last week worship is because he is alpha he is omega he is beginning he is the end he is el shaddai he is jehovah he is there is none like him i searched all over couldn't find nobody nobody like jesus search high and low still can't find no party i may not have money in my pocket but i searched all over and i couldn't find nobody everybody in here have a reason to give god a praise offering you have no excuse what shall separate us from the love of god forget your back pain forget your unrighteous forget your diabetes what shall separate us we are true believers this morning [Applause] i hope this settles in your soul i said in the martin the battle is not a weak battle over a month but it's a daily battle every single day you have to accept responsibility for your actions the real test and only the true believers can take the real test the test is all about your response we share this in the martian but always talk about that woman who said my daughter is vexed with the devil god wasn't testing what sure she wanted to it was her response and in the midst of her trial she said the right thing [Music] job job's test wasn't about what he lost the discussion between god and satan was what satan's was what was what job's response was expected to be so all of the situations in job's life his children his property his animals it was not about the animals it was not about the children it was not about the property it was about his response because the wager was that if you oppress him he will have a negative response he will say the wrong thing he will curse god and even his wife said why don't you curse god and die she played into the devil's program but job looked at his situation he looked at his son he looked at his daughter he looked at what he lost and he said though the skin worms destroy my body i'm not gonna say the wrong thing yet in my flesh i'm gonna see god i might be able to put my hand all the way up but yet in my flesh there's a resurrection power that's got to come if i have the right attitude i could still say the right thing it could be bad but i could still have the right response is this reaching anybody this morning no matter what the situation is you could say the right thing you may be seated sister hatty right sitting with the prophet talking with the prophet or prophet is sharing an experience and she said that's nothing but the truth she didn't come to better brandon i said but brandon my sons are giving trouble no she just said that's nothing but the truth and brother branham said you said the right thing and for this saying what do you want let that settle down a little bit so only the true believers will believe all the way to receiving the spirit of god and listen when peter received the holy ghost he didn't have to wonder if he got it either that's why i always say when at mount transfiguration when the voice said this is my beloved son and whom i will please hear him and you hear the hearing part you didn't have to wonder if jesus was adopted it was not discussion it was not speculation his life manifested something and when god's power is moving in your life that's why brother brown said it will speak for itself because there's a voice that's speaking and that voice doesn't give an uncertain sound we shouldn't have to discuss if jesus was adopted if this one was adopted if this one has that it should not be a discussion because it's supposed to speak for itself and when it speaks the evidence or the manifestation is a hundred percent clear it doesn't need interpretation because god doesn't need an interpreter [Applause] we're saying some things this morning from the message spoken word is your original seed can you take some more the true believers could take some more [Applause] from the spoken word is your original seed but the bible says now let us stand like joshua and caleb as we see the promised land coming in sight it's nearing the time to be given joshua in hebrew mean savior and represents the promised end time leader to take the church over and that's not a man caleb represents the true believer who stayed with joshua god started israel as a virgin with his word but they wanted something different so did the last day church now notice but ibrahim said god did not move israel until his own appointed time now listen brother branham is speaking he said now listen this is going to mean something and brother branham is speaking about us now he said this is going to mean something so i'm telling you this but really this is going to mean something to you joshua waited for that time no matter how much people might have said god gave us the land let us go now and take it they might have said joshua you lost your commission you're all washed up why are you not doing something you used to know it does dorsey the lord in a moment and what was the will of god listen but this wise god sent prophet knew the promise of god but also knew to wait for that promise a clear-cut decision from god for his time in other words nothing will happen before it's time these parables now watch but ibrahim said and when the time come god gave it to joshua who had stayed with him by the word for he could not trust others he could trust him so will it repeat so god is waiting on somebody who will believe but also wait until god's time you can tell god senate right now god has his timing [Applause] his timing for everything just as he told them wait in jerusalem tarry until you be endured with power from on high the lord already you know away ten days away three days away two days i pray 20 hours and god said time is not yet and god holds time to wait for the right people to be here to wait for the unbelievers to show their colors and to make believers ashoka because there must be a separation of the word bride from the church members because the true believers must be identified can the church say amen could he take some more [Applause] from a message proving his word but it said no i want you to notice he does it that way in every age he does it every time by the same method and that's why i say friends this gospel is not rocket science he said i am the lord and i change not same yesterday today and forever he does it that way in every age he does it every time by the same method he has to take believers and then in order to have believers to meet that word he's got to predestinate it to that age you see it he's got to predestinate this thing to be there to meet the challenge of the age brother branham said did it get you did you feel it did you see it do you understand it that's what's happening today he predestinated it to this by his foreknowledge when he predestinated in malachi 4 it's got to happen when he come over and producing it anything to happen in his word he had to prove his word to be so and when he predestined anything to happen and says it will happen he knows that seed will be there just at that time brother branham said he predestinated a bride she is gonna be there there's gonna be a raptor she's gonna be there he predestinates it by his foreknowledge so there's nothing going to stop him glory he may be seated but i'm in the rejected king but listen you true believers in christ you true christians that believe in god and the supernatural all the time soul was training his big army and all those intellectuals coming up god had a little david out there somewhere feeding his father's sheep on sheep food the word that's why the man of god is cheap food the word not on theological weeds he happened to be standing by when that happened when goliath screamed out david just happened to be standing by and brother branham said they wanted to give david a seminary experience saul came and said try my armor try my sword try my shield try my doctrine try my idea try my revelation try my dream try my prophecy but david said i'm not comfortable with that i'm used to the same word the same signs the same message when the beer came up when the lion came i use the same word and i want to go with the same word it doesn't look like a sword it doesn't look like a shield i don't need an almond because the word is my defensive and the word is my offensive i'm not here to defend them i'm here to attack him because this world must bring results and i'm a true believer i don't believe in the sword i don't believe in despair but i believe in the god of israel i believe in the god of abraham isaac and jacob i don't need what you got once i got the word i got everything somebody gave god a shout out pray you may be seated the whole of israel bogged down in defeat in unbelief listen they didn't believe god could deliver them and god had to take some money outside of the army somebody who wasn't preaching somebody who wasn't teaching somebody was off the scene but all he had was the word he was just practicing the word [Applause] seven thunders give fate the prize gonna have a revival my son is coming back my daughter is coming listen it was no accident when david hit the bear in the lion he had been practicing there's gonna be a revival seven thunders gathered the pride together charity is about to come down i see a cloud like a man's hand humor got to go missing limbs will be restored the bride will have to spoken a word oh you don't hear me this morning there's going to be an adopted pride there'll be a manifested son manifested taught up the devil could have some but he can't have all this backslide is coming back that backside is coming back that is gonna walk david was there practicing you may be cheated he wasn't trying to show off he wasn't coming to make an impression he was by himself praying in the closet and praying for my mama i'm praying for my papa i'm praying for my son and pray for my daughter you may be seated that's what it means you may be seated to take the word and hand it there so when the lion come the lion picked the wrong day the wrong time the wrong flock the wrong shepherd because david had been practicing for a long time and for 40 plus years we have been practicing for a long time and while saul built his intellectual ministers with all their fancy ideas all i need is there's going to be a revival there's going to be a manifestation seven thunders give faith seven times in the practice all i'm doing is practicing every sunday every monday every tuesday every wednesday when i'm in church when i'm in work when i'm walking the street i'm going to be filled i'm going to be healed i'm going to be delivered and the lion picked the wrong day the wrong time the wrong minister the wrong church and this morning we are swinging we are swinging we are swinging we are swinging goliath we are coming we are looking for you this morning those intellectual devils god has some true believers in trinidad who will not back down who is this uncircumcised philistine that dare defy the army of the living god somebody give god a south of praise [Applause] you may be seated [Applause] i don't represent headstone tabernacle i don't represent brother ovid i come from the kingdom we have the same father i know who my father is god used this brother here to carry the seed through but i come from god my genetic makeup i may look like an ovid but i'm not an orphan i'm a son of the king i might resemble him but i also look like my heavenly father fate virtue knowledge temperance i'm adding i'm growing i'm building waiting for charity to drop down because i'm a true believer listen you may be seated i didn't make myself a believer i didn't want to be a believer i didn't volunteer to be a believer but he put a seed up inside of my soul and he put a seed inside of your soul he didn't ask for this he didn't beg for this he found you he chose you he predestinated you he called you [Applause] and god is about to identify the true believers by giving you the baptism of the holy ghost and giving you a seven thunder revival give the lord a shout of praise [Applause] praise him worship him give him praise he inhabits the praise of his people your chains are breaking right now your sickness is breaking right now you are true believers you are true believers and the spirit has to come to the true believers and okay how long you been dead how long you've been sick how long you've been wary how long you've been tired how long you've been crying we pinned me into offer a night out but joy comes in the morning it's got to come because where true believers are the holy ghost got to come [Applause] you may be seated the holy ghost is here somebody's going to break through this morning somebody's going to go free this morning you you're sick you're going to leave here this morning forget about your feeling that's just the enemy forget about your past that's just the enemy together with your mistake that's just the enemy put it under the blood you can receive the holy ghost today you could be changed today you could be restored today right now not tomorrow not next week but now faith is we are in the season of the identification of the true believers [Applause] hallelujah could you take some more this morning could you take some more this morning your son is coming i don't care what he's doing right now but he's coming only believe your daughter is coming i don't care where she is right now she is coming that smoking demon is gonna go that alcohol demon is gonna call that fornication demon is gonna go that last demon is gonna go that field demon is gonna go they are coming back up we're gonna say it we're gonna speak it we're gonna prophesy it we're gonna declare it because we are true believers [Applause] he is here right now he is moving to the camp he is breaking change right now just stop you don't want to let go let it go right now here he already let it go you don't hold it no more he already dropped your charges you don't hold your charges he already dropped it you don't catch it let it fall let it fall let it fall it's falling into the sea of forgetfulness right now your past is falling right now your mistake is falling right now your sin is under the blood right now he covered you he covered you he covered you don't hold on to it let it go there is therefore no condemnation to them [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah noah was a true believer abraham was a true believer job was a true believer the three hebrew boys were true believers daniel was a true believer elisha was a true believer mike kyle was a true believer and i'm going to try to add some names in there but angeli he's a true believer brother oh man he's a true believer you are here this morning i'm prophesying i'm claiming i'm speaking true believers inside of here just small them maybe you feel like peter maybe you feel all unsure about yourself maybe you don't know where you stand but that word see them when you are converted strengthen your prejudice when you will convert him go for your wife when you will convert him go for your husband when you are converted go for your son when you are converted go for your daughter your conversion is coming your conversion is coming that's what the holy ghost is given for to convey [Music] [Applause] hallelujah just 15 20 more minutes and i'm done but i believe something is breaking forth this morning that you don't ever have to be the same again i'm putting you on notice you no longer have any excuse i'm taking it off a minute of the ministry this morning to put it in your lap this morning to live this word to be in this world to stay in the wood to stay in the presence to stay in the books to stay in the tapes and separate yourself from all unbelief separate yourself from anything that takes you away from your promise whether i maintain my family let me maintain christ but i need the holy ghost listen when they give the emergency instructions for an aircraft to tell you if we lose cabin pressure the oxygen masks will drop down if you have any children make sure put your mask on first before you put theirs on because if you struggle to put theirs on and you don't have yours on you might both die but make sure and put your mask on then you can help anybody once your mask is on and friends the mask is the holy ghost because the world is losing cabin pressure this world is about to implode judgment has already been spoken and those angels are being held back because there are some people who need to be sealed with the holy ghost before the judgment strikes so it's coming it's pressing on every corner and the oxygen mass are dropping this morning so you can put it on and as for me and my house lord as for me and my family lord they might be out there but as for me and my house we will serve the lord they may not understand but put on your mask and they're going to feel the pressure and they're going to say give me jesus give me jesus and the only jesus they will see is christ in you the hope of glory [Applause] [Applause] [Music] in the message fellowship where the brandon was dramatizing the of jesus going to calvary and he was bringing out his drama because he said this was the only way god could make a provision for the true believers and brother branham was dramatic he said let's look at him a few minutes and i'm asking you this morning just give us a few minutes but the band said the world's in darkness the church in its intellectual standpoint has fell to the ground has toppled the nation itself is in captivity it's a dark morning first the sun rises pretty and then smoke begin to gather in the earth we're standing in the upper room in jerusalem 1900 years ago and let's take a little trip now and look where our fellowship what happened the reason we could have fellowship let's watch it a few minutes and see if it isn't on the basis of the shed blood and but the branham is dramatizing and you could see this elijah eagle prophet is he seeing it in front of his eyes he said i see him that's how he said i see him i hear a noise outside the window what is it some of them say what has he done i see a little woman run out in front say what has he done he's only healed the sick and comforted the poor and brought life hope of life to us some man smacks all off the street said would you hear her instead of your own pastor your priest away with her someone else raises up and say i had a crippled leg and he healed me take him to the gallows but the venom is seeing it but the man said i'm listening to something bumping let's pull up the shade and look out i see coming down the street a sight that would break the heart of any iron man a one that was innocent of any sin but yet taken the sin of all the world upon him never knowed no sin he never one time displeased god his father there would never was one time he did anything that was wrong he was the perfect and the only perfect man in the world and the imperfect church condemned him to talk about a place they wanted their own organizations their own fellowships and so forth but god was making a way for the true believer for the real sincere the honest believers i said last night every time the devil produces a goliath god's got a david somewhere just always remember that now god was making a way for the true believer as jesus had said he said i hear it bumping that's the cross pumping on the street i look down and see a little bitty frail fellow he's got a little white robe laying over his shoulders wove through all without a seam as he goes down dragging the cross it's bumping on the street hitting against his head thorns blood running over his face as he starts up the hill i noticed some little red dots on his coat it's question what are those what are those little red dots on the back of his coat as he goes up the hill as farther he goes the brighter those little dots get and the wider the spread spreading father and father and the first thing you know all of them go into one great big red splotch and the bloods are beating across the legs like that what was it god making a provision for fellowship friends i'm read their quote because the true believers is not based on your merit it's based on the blood don't ever forget the blood people know the message and they're forgotten about the blood arguing about church and politics and fellowship and this church again and they have forgotten about the blood amen a blood that will never lose its power a blood price that was spiritual you could be here that i could be here i'm not here by my own strength my own merit i'm a nobody trying to tell everybody about somebody who took our sins who took our mistakes and you don't want to thank god and you don't want to worship and you don't want to give your whole heart to him may the holy spirit touch you this morning in the message and i see each other possess the gate of his enemy but ibanum said that's the reason we find our organizations failing falling by the wayside it's because when it comes to the test what tests god's word there's the test god's word is the test and listen to how peter branham put the test he said will we do what a bunch of men says do or will we do what god says do he said that's the difference will we do what a bunch of men says do or will we do what god says do that's the difference there he come the days of dwight moody the days of finney sankey knocks calvin's persian all the rest of them those spiritual men their organizations followed after them they've got a bunch of men back there that's cut their ways into it i'm seeing this for a reason church because we cannot be ignorant anymore of these of these things we can't just come to church and jump and go home and don't know anything so i charge you to listen to this tape again because we're seeing a lot of things this morning for a specific reason we're not playing games because life and death is hanging in the balance i don't care what your position is your office your station is irrelevant what's important is the word and whether or not we measure up to the word but then i said they've got a bunch of men back there that's cut their ways into it each one believing this and that and adding a little here and taking a little away there and adding a little here until finally they made an organization out of it and when they do the real true believer god comes right around and picks up some little humble person and breaks that thing to pieces [Music] always done it god doesn't change this tears that thing up to pieces some spiritually minded person people who will stay right with that word i'm heading to the home stretch now from the message of spaniard church h i want you to listen carefully now we're on the home stretch but the battle said you see the one difference between israel and the rest of the nations was god put god to one side and israel was like any other nation when samson cut off his here he was like any other man put the leadership of the holy ghost aside and the church is nothing but the world with god's name attached to it [Applause] so who is the head of this church the holy ghost must be the head of the church because brother branham said put the leadership of the holy ghost aside and the church is nothing but the world with god's name attached to it listen but the random goes on he said the world and the church are all of the same lump just like jacob and esau were of the same parents but the spirit of god makes the difference but ibrahimovic said it doesn't matter if you call yourself a christian anyone can do that [Music] the point is listen whether or not you have the spirit of god in you for without that spirit you are reprobate and that word reprobate means rascal it means no good it means troublemaker it means good for nothing so let me read it again anyone can call themselves a christian the point is whether or not you have the spirit of god in you for without that spirit you are reprobate or you are a rascal or you are no good or you are a trouble maker good for nothing but about him said you are none of his and then by the bible says amen to make sure the picture is caught listen to the prophet not too long ago i asked a lady if she were a christian she said to me i will have you know sir that i burn a candle every night but ibrahim said what in the world has that got to do with it i'm a methodist i'm a baptist i'm a pentecostal that hasn't a thing to do with it listen to the prophet it is the holy ghost or perish [Applause] so it's not just i believe the thunders don't believe the thunders i believe the voice i believe the trump i believe it's the holy ghost or perish in other words after the equation two plus two plus five divided by three is the equal sign god is interested in jump high jump low let the equal sign equal the holy ghost inside of you if the equal sign if the result is not the holy ghost then it doesn't matter what you have in the equation [Applause] i'm almost done listen but the random continues the same quote and i have to read it because a lot of people don't read these quotes but the band said well starting way back there in the first church the people got to thinking and reasoning how to improve on god the deeds of the nicolaitans began showing themselves then a group formed they drifted away from the pattern of the word and listen all it takes is just one word changed and that little leaven then levels the whole lump he that offends in one point of the law is guilty of all that's the word that's why brother branham can say full obedience to the entire world will entitle you to the token so you know everything but you still can't forgive you still can't shake my hand you have no holy ghost again you have no rapture to go to you can't forgive your husband you can't forgive your wife you can't forgive and you go into which rapture which heaven because there are places named heaven hotel heaven restaurant heaven boss's name rapture maybe it's a bus listen but the band said eve just changed one word but it said that will do it so i'm charging you church recently our brother said to me a lot of people say say what he taped say say well what but bananas say and why we need preachers i said well brother it is not just the preachers have their role to rightly divide what brother branham said because he said they will come many will make more sense it so you have to take what brother branham said and he was telling me he was in a message church where the minister just preached his own ideas preached his own ideas i said that's why we say say what the tapes say and people say see where the tapes are and sit on home and listen to tapes and forsake the assembling to justify their own issues god is not interested in your issues god is respecting his word want to get god's blessing become serious with god some time ago i saw a woman preacher i said not only is it a woman preaching but her head is cut wearing earrings wearing makeup by saying no you're just compounding the issue and when you read this better but i would say just one word off and people stacking this wrong this wrong this wrong and they saying we all go into heaven which heaven why would god in a prophet for us to be doing the stuff that the pentecostal church does we have to climb higher friends [Applause] [Music] let me continue reading i'm almost done the musicians can get ready to come up and when that listen to her brandon describe it when that satan-centered group was formed it began to hate and to fight the true believers insisting that they the aliens were the church of god so the persecution sets in now listen notice how organization breathes hatred it destroys fellowship it makes bitterness that is what myr means that is what smyrna was full of bitterness a root of bitterness defies many so more and more the firemen was coming in and every age will feel its car but ibrahim said the smurfian church had drifted far from the original it had become hybrid it had hybridized itself the way eve did you know what a hybrid is what comes of two species mixing the result is no longer pure like the original it is a mongrel how you expect to mix this with the world and get a perfect result it's impossible i'll skip down some of this but the banner said the church has departed from what she originally was i'm a baptist it wasn't so in the beginning i'm a methodist it wasn't so in the beginning i'm with this minister i'm with this group i'm a dissident it wasn't so in the beginning instead of the straight word of god instead of the spirit-filled men in the church who were led by spirit given a revelation they are all creeds and bylaws and the educated guesses of educated men learning has taken the place of revelation reason has replaced fate programs have replaced spontaneous praise in the holy ghost it wasn't so from the beginning the whole species has changed it is a hybrid church listen to what brother branham asks now when the church becomes hybridized will it produce pure christians it can't the life or seed that brings christians to the birth is not in them like brings forth like the baptists bring more baptists the methodists bring methodists not one is known by the power of god they are known by their worship and their creeds and the original world will produce the original life so church let us get to the original word and every one of the words the musicians could come up [Applause] getting ready to close out here now let's touch on my scripture revelation 22 18 for i testify unto every man that here are the words of the prophecy of this book for if any man shall add unto these things god shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book and if any man shall take away from the words of the prophecy of this of the book of this prophecy god shall take away his part out of the book of life this is a serious admonition this is how the bible ends friends out of the holy city and from the things that are written in this book but the banham said in ephesian church age it is a changing of even just one word by taken away or adding to it it is the original trick of satan in the garden of eden he just added one little word to what god said and that did it it brought debt and destruction and in ephesus it was just the same just a word added just a word taken away and the anti-word anti-christ spirit began to flourish and but the battle said the antichrist doesn't deny the word but the brandon said the antichrist believes the word just not how it's written we're really in the word this morning amen but the branham said did you get it now there are those twins again there are those two trees growing side by side in the same earth partaking of the same nourishment they're coming to church drinking in the same rain and benefiting from the same sun but they come from different seeds one tree is for the word of god exactly as god gave it and loves and obeys it the other tree is from the sea that is anti the word of god and changes it where it wants to it substitutes its own creeds and dogmas for the living true word exactly as did king who ended up killing abel but fear not little flock brother branham said stay with the world keep that word between you and the devil eve did not do that and she failed and when the church lets down on the wood she goes into the depths of the darkness of satan can the church say amen but the random says these ephesians are going to escape some of it these ephesians were christians they bought a name and that name was christ who was the spirit of god within them which was which was one of the threefold names of gods but abandoned said these believers weren't laboring for paul or for an organization they weren't committed to programs and institutions whereby they built up holdings of value they worked for the lord they were his servants not the pawns of the organization they didn't go to church on sunday and talk about that name and then forget it on the rest of the week they didn't give live service to that name no sir it was their lives that were given those are the true believers all they did they did in that name in that name they acted but if they could act in that name then they refrain from acting these were heavenly place christians whose behavior was in the lord [Applause] but abandoned said but that false vine group had wanted to defile that name hung like skulking wolves in the dark waiting to get in and tear down but the scene stood the test and kept the word and the name so that's what we are kneeling down here this morning friends the true believers will keep every word will defend the word not the church defend the word fight for the word content for the word fight for the word content for the word give me the word i don't want nothing else for the word because the word is the conductor of the spirit and if i live the world the spirit must flow the spirit must move the spirit must operate [Applause] you could be in a play something softly in a message christianity versus idolatry but abandon said that's right you have got to know the word stay on the word see the great battle is at hand now we have played church for years and years this is pretty random but the hour comes now when janice and jambres will withstand moses as the bible said they would and it's going to be spiritual battle conflict there'll be some just continue on the denominational church will just move right on into the nomination and go on the way it goes but i mean the real true believer is coming to that battlefield and you'd better be versed and know what you're doing or you can take an evil spirit so easy and not know if it's contrary to this word don't believe it stay with that word young people the word says stay away from shady places a shady place is a place without light a place that's unsure a place you're not supposed to be in because you're not sure you're supposed to be there brother branham said if you're not sure don't do it [Music] that's the word if you stay behind the word the devil can't touch you [Music] so i charge you church clean out your houses clean out your lives clean out your associations make time to read the bible make time to read the message make time to be in service [Music] where your priorities look in the mirror of the world i'm not coming to check where you at you have to answer for yourself the bible says judge yourself so you will be judged [Music] you judge yourself by the word so you wouldn't be judged and the word is coming clear this morning so that you can know where you stand are you our unbeliever you can't take the word you can't take rebuke you can't take it are you a make-believer you want some of the word you want you want to twist this or are you a true believer and your identification is how you stay with that word not how you stay with the church and how you stay with the pastor how you stay with the word because each of us have to make a we're calling an election sure because there's a rapture coming and there's judgment coming this is reality friends more real than elections coming more real than the earthquake coming this is reality friends how close it is recognize the call of god's word in the easter seal and it's an eagle to an eagle it's a scream of an eagle there was something inside a little fella that he knowed he was an eagle and brother said the same thing is with every true believer when the preaching of god's word comes forth and is vindicated and proved that it's god's word for this hour then there's something within the believer i don't care how loyal his father was to the church or how loyal his mother was or his grandparents and if the church is teaching contrary to this hour of the baptism of the holy ghost message there's something in him that screams out he will leave that barnyard he's got to do it the chicken might have been all right one big day but this is eagle hour it's different there's something he must leave the old coop and fly away into the blue then this earthly body is quickened and brought by the quickening spirit to the obedience of god's word now when this holy spirit represented as the eagle flying over the land finds the believer no man can come unless the father draws him and this is where i got my inspiration from the message god's word call for a total separation from unbelief it is a total separation we're not to go back into the world no more or have anything to do with the world but cleave only unto god jesus is coming after a bride a woman a church that's separated from the things of the world or the cares of the world she is separated from the fashions of this modern age that we live in she is separated from the cares and the traditions of churches she is separated only to god and god is the word and as husband and wife is one so does the bride and the world become one for the world is living through the bride that's how that's her credential that's her identification may the lord richly bless you this morning brother gideon let's stand our feet. [Music] give him praise this morning [Music] blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah what a message this morning [Music] let's just worship him let's just give him [Music] praise with every hand raised let's just sing it oh search me oh god and know my heart today try me o savior oh try know my thoughts i pray know my thoughts i pray see if there be some wicked way in me see [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] me free is that your prayer that sings search me search me oh god and know my heart today and know my heart today try me oh savior oh try [Music] know my thoughts i pray know my thoughts i see if there be some wicked way in me cleanse me from everything cleanse me [Laughter] free let's just give him praise hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord [Music] yes lord father we love you we praise your name lord lord we thank you lord search us this evening search our hearts lord way us lord try us lord shape us lord [Music] [Music] all to jesus i surrender [Music] [Music] i will ever love and trust him in his presence with every hand lifted sing i surrendered [Music] [Music] my blessed savior i surrendered [Music] all to jesus lord to jesus [Music] humbly at his feet i bow bleed his feet [Applause] all forsaken and take me jesus take me now then just sing and another verse all to jesus hall unto jesus surrender make me holy thine let me save your fully let me feel the holy spirit [Music] holy spirit truly know that thou art mine [Music] everybody sing oh i surrendered to the let you sing one more face [Music] to jesus i surrender lord i give myself to i give myself to thee fill me with thy love and power fill me with [Music] just one more time [Music] i surrendered [Music] to me my blessed oh
