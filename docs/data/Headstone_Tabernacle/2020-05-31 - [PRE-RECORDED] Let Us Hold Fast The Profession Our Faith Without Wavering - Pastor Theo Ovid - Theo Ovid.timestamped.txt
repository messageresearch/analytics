[30:56] for that
[30:59] I know that our lives have purpose
[31:04] behind it and this is the key thing to
[31:09] come to that spot where you really begin
[31:12] to have an interest in purpose not just
[31:16] purpose from a general perspective but
[31:19] purpose for your life and regardless of
[31:23] a mechanic's teacher lawyer whatever
[31:26] because of what status you in you have
[31:29] to still dig deeper to find out the
[31:33] purpose of God for your life
[31:35] because the end the end game ever use
[31:39] that word is that we really become
[31:42] witnesses of him in whatever capacity in
[31:46] whatever job status at the end of it all
[31:49] is not just for you to be safe in church

[32:00] Eden says safe in heaven he decided calm
[32:02] down himself and seek after Adam and go
[32:06] after Adam and bring back Adam by blood
[32:10] this is what God's love is all about
[32:13] there is no one higher and greater and
[32:17] better than we all are what we are by
[32:22] the grace of God God has extended to us
[32:25] his love and His grace and I would like
[32:29] to think that God would like us to
[32:31] extend it to others so we give God some
[32:34] prizes
[32:37] so let me let me challenge you the same
[32:40] grace won't extend to you extended

[34:49] and their Bibles Elena turn to Psalms 91
[34:53] we want to look at verse 1 2 7 Matthew
[34:57] chapter 6 wanna read from verse 5 to 15
[35:01] and Hebrews 10 from verse 19 to 25
[35:08] Psalms 91 who's 1 to 7 he that dwelleth
[35:14] in the secret place of the Most High
[35:16] shall abide under the shadow of the
[35:19] Almighty I will say of the Lord he is my
[35:22] refuge and my fortress my god in him
[35:24] will I trust surely he shall deliver
[35:27] thee from the snare of the Fowler from
[35:29] noisome pestilence he shall cover thee
[35:31] with his feathers under his wings shalt
[35:34] thou trust his truth shall be thy shield
[35:37] and buckler thou shalt not be afraid for
[35:40] the terror by night nor for the arrow
[35:43] that flies by day nor for the pestilence
[35:46] that walketh in darkness nor for the
[35:49] destruction that wasteth at noonday a
[35:52] Thousand shall fall that I write as I
[35:54] side and ten thousand at thy right hand
[35:56] but it shall not come nigh thee Matthew
[36:00] chapter 6
[36:01] Riaan from verse 5
[36:10] a window Perez thou shalt not be as the
[36:13] hypocrites are for the love to pray
[36:16] standing in the synagogues and in the
[36:18] streets corners of the streets that they
[36:21] may be seen of men very nice unto you
[36:24] they have their reward but thou when
[36:28] thou prayers enter into thy closet and
[36:31] when thou hast shut thy door pray to thy
[36:35] father which is in secret and thy father
[36:38] which seeth in secret shall reward thee
[36:41] openly
[36:42] and when you pray use not vain
[36:44] repetitions as the heathen do for they
[36:46] think that they shall be heard for their
[36:48] much speaking be not therefore like unto
[36:51] them for your father knoweth what things
[36:54] you have need of before you ask him
[36:57] after this manner therefore pray ye our
[37:00] Father which art in heaven hallowed be
[37:02] thy name thy kingdom come Thy will be
[37:05] done on earth as it is in heaven give us
[37:07] this day our daily bread and forgive us
[37:09] our debts as we forgive our debtors and
[37:11] lead us not into temptation but deliver
[37:13] us from evil for thine is the kingdom
[37:15] and the power and the glory forever and
[37:17] ever amen and for if you forgive men
[37:20] their trespasses your heavenly Father
[37:22] will also forgive you but if you forgive
[37:25] not men their trespasses neither will
[37:26] your Father forgive your trespasses
[37:29] final scripture Hebrews chapter 10 I
[37:31] want to read from verse 19 to 25
[37:38] having therefore brethren boldness to
[37:41] enter into the holiest by the blood of
[37:44] Jesus by a new and living way which he
[37:47] had consecrated for us through the veil

[37:54] High Priest over the house of God let us
[37:57] draw near with a true heart in full
[38:00] assurance of faith having our hearts
[38:03] sprinkled from an evil conscience and

[38:14] promise and let us consider one another

[40:27] holy place even under the wings of the
[40:30] cherubim for the cherubim spread forth
[40:33] their wings over the place of the Ark
[40:35] and the cherubims cover the ark and
[40:38] establish their of above and they draw
[40:40] the stars of the ark on the ends of the
[40:42] styles was seen from the ark before the
[40:44] Oracle but he was not seen without and
[40:46] there is under this day there was
[40:49] nothing in the Ark save the two tables
[40:51] which Moses put Devin in or when the
[40:54] Lord made a covenant with the chin of
[40:56] Israel when they came out of Egypt and
[40:58] they came to pass when the priests will
[41:02] come out of the holy place for all the
[41:04] priests that were present was sanctified
[41:05] and did not then wait by course also the
[41:09] Levites which were the singers all of
[41:12] them of Asaf of human of jetson with
[41:16] their sons and their brethren been
[41:18] arrayed in white linen having cymbals
[41:21] and psalteries and harps to the east end
[41:24] of the altar with them a hundred and
[41:26] twenty priests solid with trumpets it
[41:30] came even to pass as the trumpeters and
[41:33] the singers were as one to make one song
[41:37] to be heard in praising and thanking the
[41:41] Lord and when they lifted up their voice
[41:43] with the trumpets and cymbals and
[41:46] instruments of music and praise the Lord
[41:48] saying for he is good for his mercy
[41:50] endures forever then the house was
[41:53] filled with the cloud even the house of
[41:55] the Lord
[41:56] so that the priest could not stand the
[41:58] minister by reason of the cloud for the
[42:01] glory of the Lord had filled a house may
[42:05] God bless his word oh praise the name of
[42:08] the world this morning our title let us
[42:14] hold fast the profession of our faith

[42:35] meetin please the to pull closet as my
[42:40] subject of meat and place the to pull

[42:45] this Oh blessed be the name of the Lord
[42:48] so we in here to get something from the
[42:50] Lord this morning the hallelujah praise
[42:53] God
[42:54] so Berta Branham on a messaging interval
[42:56] he was seen
[42:58] I find that among most Christians I hear
[43:00] to see it that way that most people have
[43:03] professed Christianity seem to have a
[43:05] hard struggling time to hold on and I
[43:08] believe it's a lack of correct teaching
[43:10] of the Bible there's no such thing of
[43:12] holding on the whole Christian principle
[43:15] is based upon rest common to me all that
[43:19] our labor and heaven leaden and I will
[43:21] give you a rest
[43:22] you don't have to worry and struggle
[43:25] you're just resting it's a giver as you
[43:27] enter into a peace that the whole thing
[43:31] is finished Oh hallelujah
[43:34] finish isn't that right then who we call
[43:38] it justified and who he justify he
[43:41] already glorified that just happened to
[43:44] be the word that happened to be what God
[43:46] said who he foreknew he called who we
[43:50] call it justified and who is justified
[43:53] he already glorified that's settled
[43:55] already you can change that hallelujah
[43:59] isn't that right you see a man say I
[44:02] went seeking God no man ever sought God
[44:04] man don't seek God God seeks man isn't
[44:08] that right God went to a Tigana it is an
[44:11] Adam Adam where Dow but the problem he
[44:14] said is intellectual faith but the faith
[44:17] the real faith comes from the heart
[44:19] Oh hallelujah so that's the faith that
[44:23] have people up and down and in and out
[44:25] us intellectual faith but the real faith
[44:27] is from the heart brings core that's
[44:30] inside or glory to God are you with me
[44:33] so he said God told Moses to get some of
[44:36] the golden OMA which is a manner right
[44:38] and take it into the holiest of Holies
[44:41] that it could be kept true generation to
[44:44] come
[44:44] no they could touch the manor they could
[44:47] eat the manna
[44:48] but it only lasted for one day the next
[44:51] day the manna couldn't work but the one
[44:54] and the Holies of Holies that was fresh
[44:57] all the time
[44:57] it wasn't what it was it was where it
[45:01] was it was in a place Oh hallelujah
[45:05] a place that God prepared a place that
[45:09] had Shekinah a place that had glory and
[45:11] once you are put in that place the
[45:15] manner is fresh the world is fresh the
[45:18] whole scripture is fresh the message
[45:21] remains fresh not because of what it is
[45:23] but where it is okay the lot some
[45:26] praises people hallelujah hallelujah
[45:30] without the Shekinah it could be still
[45:32] to some it could be normal to some it
[45:35] could be ordinary your Sun but with the
[45:37] Shekinah it's everything that you need
[45:39] or praise and him alone are you with me
[45:43] praise God praise God hallelujah
[45:46] hallelujah
[45:47] so this Tabernacle is in three parts
[45:50] isn't that right it's done right
[45:52] justification certification and the Holy
[45:54] Ghost he's talking about a great
[45:55] tabernacle the manna fell outside the
[45:57] courts the people eat this manner but
[46:00] God told him to tick up the manner and
[46:01] put some in a holy place in the Ark and
[46:04] God prophesied to the Prophet I will
[46:08] write my laws in their hearts I will put
[46:11] them in the tablets of their heart
[46:13] praise be to Jesus we're gonna jump a
[46:16] little bit
[46:16] he said new heart I'll give you I'm a
[46:18] new spirit I will give you
[46:20] he said that spirit that new spirit is
[46:22] so it can agree with God's Spirit
[46:25] because the spirit some people have they
[46:27] can't agree with itself they can email
[46:30] have fellowship with your neighbor so
[46:32] gonna give you a new spirit first a new
[46:34] heart to give you a heart to watch God

[49:13] up and down in and out I've like no like
[49:16] feeling me pressed down up and down but
[49:18] there's a place beyond the holy place
[49:22] howl doesn't feel between the holy place
[49:25] in that place there is a place I'm
[49:28] convinced of that
[49:29] Abram was looking for a city whose maker
[49:31] and villain Abraham knew praise calling

[1:07:51] see the reveal would have to take it
[1:07:52] back to the written word because the
[1:07:54] revealed word is a revelation of the
[1:07:55] written word the book has been open this
[1:07:59] Bible tour sealed is no unsealed so we
[1:08:01] could go back and see where the
[1:08:02] scripture come from there's got to be
[1:08:08] something happen by a bit which comes
[1:08:12] from God and brings the new bit into you

[1:08:27] see through your body on the front
[1:08:28] things of course have light in it that
[1:08:29] is not God's light that is cosmic light
[1:08:32] but when that white light that's Zoe
[1:08:35] that that is a cosmic light that's a
[1:08:37] different supernatural light that light
[1:08:40] comes into that's a different thing
[1:08:42] all hell let's see it praise God you are

[1:19:36] forward first seal then all the judgment
[1:19:43] of the evildoers you see down to the
[1:19:45] ages as the seals has been breaking you
[1:19:49] see people didn't know it was breaking
[1:19:51] the ages were unfolding without any open
[1:19:57] view
[1:19:58] of it breaking our seals but the reality
[1:20:02] was every it sees us breaking messenger
[1:20:05] coming out people coming out living out
[1:20:08] dying is open is cruising it open big
[1:20:11] fallen it's unfolding and God promised
[1:20:14] to reveal the whole thing at the end
[1:20:15] time so when it bring brother branham
[1:20:19] but around come and said look on this
[1:20:23] look what happened this age look on that
[1:20:26] age look on that age looked on that age
[1:20:28] here we are
[1:20:30] so we can look back and see God's
[1:20:32] pattern and he's on phone and revelation
[1:20:35] and its purpose for his people all these
[1:20:43] evil doers of the seven seals has been
[1:20:46] working mysterious in the church and it
[1:20:50] should be not oppositional in the church
[1:20:51] evil doers I will find out there Milland
[1:20:55] they even work in the name of a church
[1:20:57] they call themselves the church no
[1:21:00] wonder I have been so against
[1:21:02] denomination not knowing why the city
[1:21:07] nomination spirit is what gets people in
[1:21:11] the group that the group becomes their
[1:21:16] voice so they are silenced by group
[1:21:20] teaching group testimonies group
[1:21:23] anointing but when Jesus died this same
[1:21:29] in a veil that was hiding the most holy
[1:21:33] place God rented from the top to the
[1:21:37] bottom
[1:21:38] the shore is no longer priesthood could
[1:21:42] go inside idea but whosoever will have
[1:21:46] access to disk I know it has to be a
[1:21:50] pastor to get it you don't have to be
[1:21:52] like elder to get it it'll have to be a
[1:21:54] deacon to get it whoever will can have
[1:21:56] access
[1:21:58] the Shekinah glory where the mother
[1:22:01] stays fresh in your life in your heart
[1:22:07] or give the Lord some princess people so
[1:22:15] there was no man worthy to look upon the
[1:22:16] book because this book me because in
[1:22:26] this book this book like this because in
[1:22:29] this book was the book of redemption say
[1:22:32] there was a book in the book don't
[1:22:35] forget that know his own name was in
[1:22:38] there nobody was busy sober I'm praying
[1:22:42] there God we are willing to take this
[1:22:43] book we are not good we are unworthy to
[1:22:45] take this book into our hearts and we
[1:22:46] read in the scriptures no man was in
[1:22:48] heaven or beneath it was willing to take
[1:22:50] it and only the Lamb that I mean slain
[1:22:53] he talked about for he was worthy he
[1:22:54] lives the scenes around and we are
[1:22:56] looking to him this morning to reveal
[1:22:58] these contexts that's written in the
[1:23:00] book because it is the book of
[1:23:02] redemption all that is redeemed is
[1:23:05] written Aaron that is redeemed is
[1:23:10] written in so as Isaac preached we read
[1:23:14] the voice of one crime the wilderness
[1:23:16] were when got lucky see John we read a
[1:23:21] virgin shall conceive but when God look
[1:23:23] you see Mary isn't that right so when we
[1:23:27] read scriptures but God see names so
[1:23:30] every name written for this age is in
[1:23:32] the book
[1:23:34] so when the mighty angel came up with
[1:23:36] the book open he came down with your
[1:23:38] name in it that should make you shout
[1:23:40] and scream because John was weeping when
[1:23:46] the book was closed John was weeping
[1:23:48] John was crying I'm John rejoice when
[1:23:52] the lamb came and took the book know for
[1:23:54] you to hear that that lamb not only take
[1:23:56] the book not even open a book but he
[1:23:58] brought down the book nobody have to

[1:31:27] come to a spot when she recognized her
[1:31:29] purpose her destiny whatever this is
[1:31:32] whatever it is such a time as this what

[1:34:52] some praises
[1:34:55] [Applause]
[1:34:56] all right let's blow a beeper now it's
[1:35:00] gonna further stand the gap but a
[1:35:03] brenell speaking about June 8th brother
[1:35:05] Jackson he had a dream he's a Methodist
[1:35:07] minister he told me a dream a dream
[1:35:09] there was a long grassy hill water I'd
[1:35:12] wash up the top of the soil it become
[1:35:15] ball on the top of a mountain then in
[1:35:17] this rock was a funny rating and I was
[1:35:20] standing there with all the brethren
[1:35:22] around the church here interpreting this
[1:35:24] writing and then become a time that I
[1:35:27] got it all interpreted that I got a hold
[1:35:30] of a crowbar like angle bar or angled by
[1:35:34] a pry bar and cut the top of the
[1:35:36] mountain out and lifted it up and on the
[1:35:41] inside of it was a white rock something
[1:35:45] on the order of granite some white rock
[1:35:48] that wasn't written on and I said stay
[1:35:50] here look in on this and while they will
[1:35:55] all look in I slipped out among them
[1:35:57] started going west I'm gonna Jackson
[1:36:00] said he saw me going up a hill I got in
[1:36:02] smaller and smaller he said well the
[1:36:04] interpretation of course was given here
[1:36:05] in the church and I believe the full
[1:36:07] revelation yet is true the age of looter
[1:36:11] and Wednesday and John Smith and
[1:36:14] different ones that preached on the
[1:36:16] Bible then we got over in the Bible and
[1:36:19] showed where the seven angels message at
[1:36:22] the song of the seminal message all the
[1:36:24] message of God would be made known then
[1:36:26] come seven mysterious thunders
[1:36:29] now if it's at the end age we are living
[1:36:33] in we have come to justifications and
[1:36:35] vacation signs wonders prophecy healing
[1:36:37] we have lots of impersonation we have
[1:36:40] people get up and try to act like
[1:36:41] Christians and and life don't compare
[1:36:43] there's something wrong their fruits may
[1:36:46] push your know them never jump a hair
[1:36:49] higher and you live we find out as I
[1:36:52] told you the interpretation on the rock
[1:36:54] on the rock is Christ that was the
[1:36:56] brother's dream and all these years the
[1:36:59] Bible has been interpreted till we have
[1:37:02] an ecclesiastical intubation true but
[1:37:05] the last gift added to the loud is an
[1:37:07] age which
[1:37:08] seven angels message watch del I watch
[1:37:11] like Luther pre justification he gonna
[1:37:13] come and explain it away he let it run
[1:37:15] while Luther never organized the church
[1:37:17] we're never on as a church and so forth
[1:37:20] those man reformers didn't live long
[1:37:22] enough to get it all together John Smith
[1:37:25] brought back water baptism any Muslim
[1:37:26] but her titles many of those things were
[1:37:29] left loose
[1:37:30] but when it come down to the end here we
[1:37:32] go the last message is supposed to
[1:37:35] straighten that all up and bring these
[1:37:37] things to one fate one Lord one baptism
[1:37:40] which we know is another Ephesians so
[1:37:43] after the Bible is interpreted you
[1:37:45] notice I open up the top of a pyramid
[1:37:47] like Rock not pyramid teacher now watch
[1:37:50] but however it was in the shape of a
[1:37:52] pyramid the cap on the pyramid was never
[1:37:55] put on the cap never did come because it
[1:37:59] was the cornerstone the cap was
[1:38:03] disguised as the cornerstone in the
[1:38:07] early church
[1:38:08] it was the cornerstone but in the full
[1:38:11] church
[1:38:11] it's the headstone so it never did come
[1:38:14] it was rejected ya know and it will come
[1:38:19] prophecy so this headstone was disguised
[1:38:22] as the cornerstone of the early church
[1:38:24] because upon this cornerstone what Bill
[1:38:26] seven ages to bring us back to this age
[1:38:28] which is the capstone age now Lisa ends
[1:38:31] it and we break into that slot called
[1:38:34] Holy Spirit slot - the headstone is not
[1:38:37] right so I believe that there's a church
[1:38:41] we're coming to a place from just a
[1:38:43] tional luta sound occasion on the Wesley
[1:38:45] and the Pentecostal message will bring
[1:38:48] the church in such a minority and her
[1:38:49] ministry will be among those people
[1:38:52] exactly the same Ministry of Jesus
[1:38:54] Christ oh my my mind so here we go he
[1:38:59] said now watch because he didn't come in
[1:39:02] the first watch they went to sleep
[1:39:03] second watch in the seven watch and the
[1:39:06] seven angels message when he come all
[1:39:08] those virgins arose and trimmed their
[1:39:10] lamps Presbyterian Baptist with a born
[1:39:12] of the Spirit of God shall go in the
[1:39:13] rapture and I believe here we go that
[1:39:15] the bride will be call out during that
[1:39:17] time
[1:39:19] that's why I say the brightest - because
[1:39:21] we're only holding on but the time
[1:39:25] coming for the landowner gentle with us
[1:39:28] same power same signs in wonders you
[1:39:32] can't expect to go no under your family
[1:39:34] still out set something after begin to
[1:39:36] move up on you that will get your family
[1:39:39] to see to come inside also because this
[1:39:41] is the last our Android on the next
[1:39:43] generation coming along it don't have no
[1:39:45] next messenger coming on the bride will
[1:39:47] be the final to the final that is what
[1:39:51] you are there is no other prophet coming
[1:39:55] there is no other messenger coming
[1:39:57] hollow the Prophet the messenger the
[1:40:00] Prophet on the bride will be saying the
[1:40:01] same thing
[1:40:02] [Applause]
[1:40:07] and so much as you notice by the Jackson
[1:40:09] dream
[1:40:10] there was no writing on this rock on the
[1:40:11] inside that's what I went west for
[1:40:15] nineteen sixty two hundred contests what
[1:40:18] a bad name is prayin make us fit
[1:40:20] servants forgive our pasts bless our
[1:40:23] future guide us Oh Lord I mighty hand
[1:40:26] Jehovah bless these ministers here bless
[1:40:28] the lady all the visitors a be with us
[1:40:31] Lord we are your servants we give
[1:40:33] yourself ourselves wholly to you for
[1:40:35] 1963 that the power of your spirit might
[1:40:38] have more preeminence is in our life you
[1:40:40] know being help us God forgive us and
[1:40:42] help us we pray
[1:40:43] raise up mighty men raise up mighty
[1:40:46] violence of the faith mighty warriors of
[1:40:49] the faith and here he is prophesying in
[1:40:52] prayer open this year Lord that hidden
[1:40:55] manna that rock beneath the rock that we
[1:41:01] might see the program of God so brother
[1:41:03] Branham knew that the rock beneath the
[1:41:07] rock he take a proba and break off the
[1:41:09] capstone as it was there was white rock
[1:41:10] there there was something dear that we
[1:41:13] could see the program of God so the
[1:41:16] revelation of that rock is to show you
[1:41:19] the program of God then he went deeper
[1:41:23] DISA tap off the pyramid of our life who
[1:41:27] know what he was talking about back
[1:41:28] there who I prune back there to know
[1:41:30] what he is talking about faith and
[1:41:31] virtue and knowledge and temperance and
[1:41:33] patience he said cap off the pyramid of
[1:41:35] our life put the capstone Christ Jesus
[1:41:37] upon each one of us means great Manek
[1:41:40] magnificent holy blessing be upon us may
[1:41:42] the fire of the Holy Ghost come upon us
[1:41:43] Metapod resurrection be manifested how
[1:41:46] we thank you tonight we are yours and
[1:41:49] serious this is a time he said might be
[1:41:51] closer than you think
[1:41:52] it got me scared I haven't done enough
[1:41:54] time shall be no more your noxious time
[1:41:56] is over what happens now if that is so
[1:41:59] then the permanence kept by the seven
[1:42:01] thunders you remember the freedom
[1:42:02] message
[1:42:02] it's a capstone wanted to do the Holy
[1:42:05] Spirit capped off the individual and
[1:42:08] seal it notice he's not my church he's
[1:42:11] armored group the Holy Spirit
[1:42:14] caps off the individual and seal it when
[1:42:17] we added off it registers in Ghana some
[1:42:19] theaters of what we kept adding until we
[1:42:22] get seven things and the seven one was
[1:42:23] love which is God that's how he makes
[1:42:26] the individuals he caps him and seals
[1:42:29] them with the Holy Spirit if that be so
[1:42:32] then that individual of 78 ages that he
[1:42:35] had seven minutes treatment ministries
[1:42:37] that's underway and they fought for to
[1:42:39] bring back and the head stone from the
[1:42:41] Capitol
[1:42:42] they fought to do what let me fought to
[1:42:47] bring it back because the early church
[1:42:49] had to seven virtues in them they had
[1:42:51] seven voices in them they had seven
[1:42:53] thunders in them that Christ in them and
[1:42:56] as the church began to fall away the
[1:42:58] others were fighting to bring it back
[1:42:59] what do you think you have to do you
[1:43:02] have to fight to bring it back bring
[1:43:03] back the altar in your home bring back
[1:43:05] the prayer in your life bring back the
[1:43:07] Holy Ghost upon your soul you have to
[1:43:09] fight say fight say hello to fight you
[1:43:14] have to fight to bring it back or give
[1:43:16] the Lord the brezza offering
[1:43:19] [Applause]
[1:43:22] so in in since this name is for my dream
[1:43:24] dream then notice in some mysterious way
[1:43:26] we picked it out in the air shaft tool
[1:43:29] open the top there was white cry night
[1:43:31] it was interpreted there was no letters
[1:43:33] and I set the present look on this
[1:43:36] hallelujah look on this until it fully
[1:43:38] unfold look on all these promises that
[1:43:41] you have I'll never leave your nerve for
[1:43:43] a second why don't you look on that look
[1:43:45] at the healing virtue look at strength
[1:43:47] instead of you have reason and Haga no
[1:43:49] work on why don't you say the Lord my
[1:43:51] fortress I came when I put my trust or
[1:43:53] look on these promises hallelujah and I
[1:43:58] stood there a little bit until the Holy
[1:44:00] Spirit revealed it and said the entire
[1:44:04] Bible as much has been revealed to man
[1:44:08] - justification sonification the battle
[1:44:12] only goes but in Jesus name all these
[1:44:13] have been revealed but there is secrets
[1:44:16] that is hid inside because the Bible see
[1:44:21] with seven seals I must go and find it
[1:44:23] and that morning when those seven angels
[1:44:26] come down and blast the earth rocks flew
[1:44:28] everywhere seven angels stood there and
[1:44:30] said return back to Jacksonville from
[1:44:32] where you come from for the seven seals
[1:44:34] of the seven message will be open and
[1:44:36] today your understanding serpent seed if
[1:44:40] God's willing will understand the
[1:44:41] correctness of margin divorce all these
[1:44:43] things that God has open every seal the
[1:44:47] mysteries since the foundation of the
[1:44:48] world it be up and enjoy the presence of
[1:44:51] the blessing oh my hallelujah this is
[1:44:54] all interpreted according to his dream
[1:44:56] is all finished according to God's Word
[1:44:59] the seven messenger will finish and then
[1:45:02] the seven thunders saw the capstone all
[1:45:04] over praise the name of the Lord praise
[1:45:08] be to Jesus you love him give the Lord
[1:45:12] some praises
[1:45:14] [Applause]
[1:45:20] so I believe this is one of the hidden

[1:45:58] always will because there was only one
[1:46:01] form eternal life we always were the
[1:46:04] reason we were is because we were part
[1:46:06] of God and God is the only thing that is
[1:46:09] eternal so what he's doing you know he's
[1:46:13] bringing a deeper revelation that you
[1:46:15] just been a sinner saved by grace

[1:48:11] you don't remember it because you were
[1:48:13] only an attribute in God you were only
[1:48:17] in his thinking your very name if it
[1:48:21] ever was in the book of life was put
[1:48:22] there before the from vision world he
[1:48:25] knew what you were I am only saying this
[1:48:28] not to mix up doctrine but to straighten
[1:48:31] it out that we might take away the fear
[1:48:34] and the scare you don't know who you are
[1:48:38] you are not going to be but now are we

[1:48:51] will be but no we are the activities as
[1:48:55] powerful as the world itself because

[1:49:04] attribute the attribute and God is just
[1:49:08] as real the tree wasn't gone stinking

[2:21:52] stretch
[2:21:52] yeah alright this is bottom 10 vision I
[2:21:56] want to listen to this when I was sat
[2:22:00] down I was Bonita and standing above her
[2:22:02] the great tent I never seen such a tent
[2:22:04] and I made an altar core see my god only
[2:22:06] altar people weakened hundreds of people
[2:22:08] and then a real kind gentleman went walk
[2:22:11] on a platform and said wild Burmese
[2:22:13] rested moments we call the prayer line
[2:22:15] I noticed the prayer line and when I
[2:22:18] wrong from the tent and I looked I was
[2:22:21] standing on the platform and there was a
[2:22:23] small building about 12 feet across 20
[2:22:26] foot long and I stood at that and I seen
[2:22:29] them bring a lady up on a stretcher
[2:22:31] there was a lady taking a name on a
[2:22:33] paper and there was someone come
[2:22:35] push up through and the next one came to
[2:22:38] it crutches and I went and he went to
[2:22:40] this little building and only outside
[2:22:43] the lady come out screaming at the top
[2:22:44] of voice pushing the stretcher the other
[2:22:47] lady said what happened I don't know I
[2:22:49] couldn't tell the man was sick and
[2:22:52] paralyzed I know he is leaping and
[2:22:54] jumping when he come into this little
[2:22:57] room and notice clothes there's a
[2:23:00] difference between the angel of the Lord
[2:23:02] and that light because I heard something
[2:23:04] moving as it does when it comes on the
[2:23:07] platform at night I kind of like a white
[2:23:10] fire whipping around and it went over
[2:23:12] the top of the audience here we go and I
[2:23:14] went down and she stood over the top of
[2:23:19] that building and settling on the top of
[2:23:21] it and when it did this one standing by
[2:23:25] me the same voice the angel voice says I
[2:23:28] will meet you in dia and this is the
[2:23:32] third pool so this light went the rest
[2:23:37] of the room the angel by the Prophet
[2:23:40] says I will meet you in there that is
[2:23:45] the third pole but nobody would know
[2:23:49] nothing about it I said I don't
[2:23:51] understand why in there my dear he said
[2:23:54] it will not be a public show I don't I
[2:23:57] said I don't understand going into that
[2:23:59] closet then the angel gave him a
[2:24:03] scripture that's what we read today he
[2:24:07] said is it not written by our Lord when
[2:24:10] doe prayers be not like the hypocrites
[2:24:12] who like to be heard before men but
[2:24:15] enter into the secret closet and pray to
[2:24:19] the father who sees in secret and he who
[2:24:22] sees in secret shall reward me openly
[2:24:25] and I said I understand and he took me
[2:24:28] into this place and set me down in this
[2:24:30] room where I was act and then he told me
[2:24:32] what to do the 2-time Christian friends
[2:24:34] when I leave this world that will still
[2:24:36] be in my bosom what a vision
[2:24:42] that is where I got the torte from could
[2:24:43] pull closet hallelujah because you see
[2:24:48] everything has to be in the word alright
[2:24:50] from the Seventh Seal I'm on the horse -
[2:24:52] now he says the holy spirit stood
[2:24:55] between me and God he don't know nothing
[2:24:57] about it is speaking he said know what
[2:24:59] remember Satan will try to impersonate
[2:25:02] everything that the church will do
[2:25:05] notice true the Antichrist but this is
[2:25:07] one thing kind of person it
[2:25:09] there is no mimics to it because he
[2:25:12] don't know it there is no way for him to
[2:25:14] know it it's the temple he don't know
[2:25:17] nothing about it
[2:25:19] next words he doesn't understand it Oh
[2:25:23] hallelujah
[2:25:25] so the vision I seen the light leave me
[2:25:28] go into that building and the voice
[2:25:31] suddenly I'll meet you in there that
[2:25:33] would be the truthful why it wouldn't be
[2:25:35] a public show I want to identify five
[2:25:39] things wherever I'm says it eatable and
[2:25:41] each one of those things have a
[2:25:43] scripture connected with it first the
[2:25:46] one we read was a ten vision he
[2:25:49] connected Matthew 6:6 when opreis and
[2:25:51] tonight closet when I shut the door pray
[2:25:53] to thy father which is in secret and thy
[2:25:55] father which seeth in secret shall
[2:25:57] reward you openly
[2:25:58] he said the third Pole as a spoken word
[2:26:00] scriptures in McCallum 23 if you shall
[2:26:04] say to this mountain be movin don't talk
[2:26:06] in your heart but believe those things
[2:26:08] which you see at Chuck on the pass
[2:26:09] she'll have what survey said he said the
[2:26:12] third pull as the Kings sword scriptures
[2:26:15] in John 15:7 if he abadan me I was
[2:26:17] abiding you that's what you will he
[2:26:18] shall be done unto you Hebrews 4:12 the
[2:26:20] Word of God is quick and powerful and
[2:26:22] sharper - its sword he said a third
[2:26:25] polish the open of this world the
[2:26:26] Scriptures scripture Luke 24 27 and
[2:26:29] beginning at Moses and all the prophets
[2:26:31] he expounded in the scriptures things
[2:26:34] concerned himself
[2:26:35] Luke 24 45 then open here understand
[2:26:38] into the scriptures that they might
[2:26:40] understand the scriptures the fifth
[2:26:43] thing sores in prison
[2:26:44] first Peter 3:18 for Christ also had
[2:26:49] once suffered for sins - just for the
[2:26:51] unjust that he might bring us to God
[2:26:52] being put to death
[2:26:54] the flesh but quickened by the spirit by
[2:26:57] which also he went and preached unto the
[2:27:00] spirits in prison which sometime were
[2:27:02] disobedient when once the long-suffering
[2:27:03] of God waited listen or while the ark
[2:27:06] was preparing we're in a few issues were
[2:27:09] save so if this is the triple then a
[2:27:14] great ministry is lying ahead for us oh
[2:27:18] my inclusion but a bottom says how about
[2:27:24] to meet the Sun gets stronger every day
[2:27:27] is get stronger and finally witness Lee
[2:27:29] in there it will go to take in life
[2:27:31] so first the sweetest green Shaka's
[2:27:34] green you don't know who is who but then
[2:27:36] the pressure come the heat come to bake
[2:27:39] the shout underwrite in the wheat green
[2:27:42] then the wreath goes on to take in life
[2:27:44] and after a while it becomes stronger
[2:27:47] and the green should be maturing and
[2:27:50] getting stronger as the Sun becomes
[2:27:52] stronger every day and that should be
[2:27:54] your testimony Luther's mana will not
[2:27:56] work for Methodist Methodist mana
[2:27:57] wouldn't work for Pentecost Pentecostal
[2:27:59] mana would work for the day it got to
[2:28:01] come fresh Luther's mana messages
[2:28:03] vacation where these message was
[2:28:06] sonification the Pentecost about the
[2:28:08] restoration of the gifts but this is
[2:28:10] introduced in the headstone the last day
[2:28:13] the bride tree
[2:28:15] so therefore this seventh under
[2:28:17] revelation or inspiration was supposed
[2:28:19] to be cuss out and get us out of a
[2:28:22] fleshly shock ways that we could become
[2:28:25] vessels of honor unto God question and
[2:28:28] answers sound vacation is when your name
[2:28:30] goes on the book as a believer
[2:28:32] oh my Kelly's question if we were saved
[2:28:36] we were what we said before the from day
[2:28:38] in the world

[2:28:41] and your your name was put in lamb Book
[2:28:43] of Life before the world was ever

[2:28:47] Ephesians 1 according as he has chosen
[2:28:49] us in him before from this in the world
[2:28:51] that we should be holy before him before
[2:28:54] we love and so on were we spirits then
[2:28:56] no we were nothing then but in course in
[2:28:59] mind we were and his pocket and
[2:29:01] materialized it how many know that Jesus
[2:29:04] that years was the lamb slain for the
[2:29:05] phone in the world God
[2:29:06] book it and it was good as finished and
[2:29:09] when he saw me he saw you before the
[2:29:11] foundation of the world
[2:29:12] we are only figurative in his mind and
[2:29:14] he come to the world we were bought man
[2:29:16] one male and female and got separated in
[2:29:18] man and female spirit isn't that right
[2:29:21] blessed be the name of the Lord we
[2:29:25] almost did someone asked me to repeat
