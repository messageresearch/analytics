John 16 verse 7 Jesus speakin nevertheless I tell you the truth it is expedient for you that I go away for if I go not away the comforter will not come unto you but if I depart I will send him unto you when he has come he reproved a wolf of sin and of righteousness and of judgment of sin because they believe not on me of righteousness because I go to my father and you see me no more of judgment

father we thank you for your word interpreter to us and Lord me you comment it and and blessed in Jesus name we ask it amen and amen before I ever ceases to know and greet somebody in Jesus name always good to see all of you all tonight it's a blessing you make a sacrifice as one into cancer service tonight when I was all terrible but I decided to just let things be and you are out tonight so that's me you're not dry weather Christians you don't have to have all the sunshine you could offer in also still come out amen so that's good even tonight I have a title and it's from the scripture itself Psalms for the tree and the title have is delight and I true let them lead me now I hope that this give or take this as a as a pendant as a word for you that you let the light thy light and I truth let let them lead me enough an inspiration the guide and from a message God's Word call for total separation from unbelief he said if God said let there be light and there was no light that isn't then that isn't that that isn't what God said when God say everything he must backup artisan so gorgeous don't say other words and when the word of God has been vindicated the would have been vindicated that is right [Applause] now the word itself isn't light until it's vindicated light if God's another delight and there was no light then it wasn't the Word of God but when light sprung up on the earth that showed the word was vindicated and it was light and today here we go if God made a promise when that promise is vindicated then that is light that is the light of the day when the wood is vindicated the wood of the hour is vindicated and God has one way of bringing light to you not to ease not ten weeks one way of bringing light to you that is when you are ready to separate yourself from all the things of the world and the cares of the world and plea only to the promise would that's a choice that's a choice action you have to be ready to say you know what this is it this is the pull of grid price you will sell all to get this hallelujah let me say it again this would seem God has one way of began like to you that is when you are ready to separate yourself from all the things of the world and all the cares of the world and cling only to the promise would Alleluia Paul was a Nazarite unto the Lord he was separated from the Orthodox Church to the Word of the Living God even was a Nazarite unto the Lord he was separated from the among the Brethren that we had a bit stone to be high priest it's a portal separation we are not to go back into the world no more other need to do with the world but cleave only under God here we go Jesus is coming after bright a woman a church that is separated from the teeth of the world or the cares of the world she is separated from the fashions of this modern age that we live in she is separated from the cares and the tradition of churches she is separated Oh little God and God is the word and a husband and wife is one so does the bride and would becomes one for the wood is living through the bride that's our credentials that's her identification not this church that church her credentials is a worth living who ID card is the word linen or glorious is beautiful you know this is beautifully done do with Church you know this afternoon will be coming fresh inside of you this has tremendous alone could imagine that is your identification card were livin which one could condemn me of sin that what Jesus said because of what was living in him or glory regardless continue watch if I could pull out a PhD led and show you my credentials from a civilization or some school that school recognized that credential but the only credential that a believer has is the word living in him declaring that Jesus Christ lives in that person that's what you're fighting for not to come to church but to go up the hill his holy hill and he says and I keep and send a light that we may go up there or glory to God and he sent his fruit and he sent his light he sent the street farmers were to a profit this and the light of the ovens indicated the world that we could claim that's why he said I did not come to build another denomination I came to build individuals interest touch of a perfect man that they can become a powerhouse don't you ever forget that not for them to become church members for this is he become a powerhouse let's continue and we are so this is some time with different titles what I was beginning to do maybe is to tell you how much books that we get equal sum I want so I don't want to read it like a flu so it's not one book it's several different books but it have a continuously in it and that's what I have to fight to find the continuity I know that sometimes we could preach free and straight and what some people like that but I can like this too because this is this is seen what it did see and you seen it with inspiration and you know you get in seasons after you isn't that right so what she wants something now he said now watch you see Foreman of the body from the feet coming up when he was here and he was the son and he was killed the church each took his place and then matched them to the Dark Ages on begin to build on a foundation coming out where does the site come from at the top of the head then it started right back coming back the church coming back from the feet notice it's the head thing you can't see with your hands yet this part of your body you can't see with your ears yet it come here you can't see what it knows but gets its spells you can't see with the lips - it speaks that was a Pentecostal age but no is he i time be seen so another see God at the same light so God sent a seer a prophet written Branham as he's here because he had even like the shame that the bride will know how to claim where to go that the word could be a lamp unto your feet and a light unto your part because that is what Amelie lamb for the shine light the world is the lamp it's not right the light is fully show you how to go or close to we're not without a guide the Holy Ghost is the guy so God take the prophet but he didn't take the guide the guided surfers are promised this I will not leave you comfortless but I will release the spirit of truth not of error all your meanness of spirit of truth oh yes the spirit of truth to come to leave you and guide you into all truth or we believe that they can't work let's continue now so now is the eye time the scene no this is there isn't one moving faculty beyond the eye the next is the intelligence go glory record here we go which is Christ himself who controls the whole body not not bishop not no apostle not no new prophet hallelujah after Malachi floor is promised Christ himself because this message was the introduced the Messiah come on on that introduced a bunch of men introduce the Messiah Christ himself the intelligence coming to govern the entire body Oh glory to God they'll fall upon the prophets foundation the intelligence which is the cap which is the mind of Christ which is dynamics Oh glory to God which is the anointing promise come upon a bride Oh glory to God and it coming as the Spirit of Truth to guide us into all truth or get a lot of show so it's not listen I listen it's a guide that take you pay a destination or glory don't got a wonderful glorious baptism of the Holy Ghost where there is virtue and knowledge and temperance and patience and quality some public honest and charity that's what the guy will come and lead us to Oh glory to God so what is light sent for so you can see how to get the wrong it's very simple tonight nothing complicated about this what is lights and fall for you to see how to get are wrong because now this I went in the darkness now hallelujah people blind and wretched and miserable naked so question of probability right evening light because it was getting dark for us to see the last bit of it to get on the way how we thank God for healing light this is a darkness you know we got evening light I miss all the blackout we got even like we are walking in the light tonight Oh hallelujah glory to God Amen hallelujah so he said in the evening time it's shabby like what is that gospel like what does that do is the Holy Spirit what does it do it write in the crop in the last days the Holy Spirit will pour out in time gone but I don't you get that that's prophecy the Holy Spirit will pour out in time in the last days to bring in the latter in drilling or chlorine of God is not powerful tonight that you are under prophecy not maybe not perhaps the Holy Spirit with pour out in time in the last days to bring in the latter in because like the real rain but first first how are you would have a rain when we are still planting denominational seeds bringing forth more unbelief all the time why don't you plan to gospel seed to bring for the power of God in the resurrection so God couldn't just drop rain or kinda old sees God get the first separation look at the shock separate from the seed so he sent seven thunders to gather the bride together to show the bride home to prepare to give the brightness down on the will church look at the Lord show or glory love God who brought the thunders cooper information ten price i saw another mighty angel listen from heaven with a shout who was an angel that much christ who is that your husband ordered the lord a show or glory to go ahead no man listen it's the Lord Himself descends from heaven with a shout the Living bread commences of y'all to get his people together oh my god hallelujah this is a shuttle revelation that cannot be possible broken Oh hallelujah is indestructible it cannot be broken up on this rocky gonna build the church it's revelation we're talking about Christ himself come down to call you oh by seven voices or glory no car honk ooh you miss it and call the bride in every age how could you miss and every years had a voice that voice for them go to wrap up on seven Oh glory to God hallelujah and release all them voices or glory to God not only will those voices call in this edge it will come one voice the voice of the Archangel to even call the death Oh [Applause] hallelujah praise God Utah body intelligence coming though [Music] let's continue so god separate dr. sunlight isn't that right he suppressed death from light and the only way God has today his seed is already here in his word the only thing it needs light on it oh you mean he would still need light it's not as if what is a seed but it still need light and he is the light for he is the word and the word unlike is the same the light India is the light of the world is the light the germ of life lives within the green the light is what breaks forth and brings forth the life out of the green that's to me Christ in the world makes the world do what it's supposed to do just like the life in the grain of wheat or whatever it is it makes the wheat or supposed to do because in it is the life that's in it so life is only by the Word of God made manifest I miss again life is only by the will of God made manifest life comes only by the Word of God made manifest as long as it'll just in the book like this it still can be questioned but when it's made manifest then you see the product of water spoke of being manifested as long as is in books and tapes we could argue and debate but when that will become a Living Word when that will become fresh when that will become manifested Sanders delight Oh glory to God hallelujah hallelujah you must want the light from the world send us the light and your truth the distance of that holy hill will give us the Lord a shout or glory no god it's not just world world world world world is where I Spirit is truth and light a season world hallelujah let's continue hallelujah so that was bring the word the word Setsu and then it comes to pass that is life in light light bringing life light brings life hallelujah you put a plant in a basement there covered over they will never bring forth anything because there's no light there but as soon as I strikes it it will bring forth life if it's a charity season that's the same thing as in the world it would have God when the light strikes it it brings the world to life again and every years has been like that how we appreciate these great things how the world has been vindicated as the light of the spoken word Oh glory to God hallelujah now if he said it I know like come then we don't know whether it's true or not we won't know where he is all right we don't know where he is going or not because he just said let there be and there wasn't but when God speaks and we see it is then that's the light that shines for the truth of the word there is the light under life and him was life life was the light of men Oh glory to God could you take some more when the word becomes fresh it becomes manifested that reminder homie say the word was invisible until it becomes flesh so people talk all the talk let the word become manifested then we will have a confirmation that the world has become all glory to God oh this is wonderful tonight I'm excited about this tonight know this little man connection you know this is God connecting with you I can make your flesh become the world that's a good operation I can't call you that's a good operation I can't give you revelation that's a good operation I got closer to the resurrection that's a good operation excited tonight man is on the picture Oprah's on the picture this episode of picture it's the operation of God no wonder you start to work in you know man I stopped working you don't got that started in you is able to finish it [Applause] I will sail again the god that begins at work in your life he is able to complete it I want to say amen to that say ma'am again that the god of status it'll finish it when the word becomes flesh it becomes manifested like take the water and put it in the right position the Reich and I groan it brings forth the seed will bring forth this kind and the word brought into the right kind of a heart will manifest itself it will bring forth the light it will bring forth upon it nothing natural or spiritual can live without God's light life can only come in by light let a letter have to switch over it has to become light yes because only light could bring life Jesus a the flesh profiteth nothing the ways that I speak they are spirit and they are life the same the words are mechanic and dynamic to hollowly would have power in and to power to transform when Peter was sharing his testimony with Cornelius host was just words but what was was it was it Peter words of God's word God would was coming on that man's mouth and while Peter was speaking speaking the word the Holy Ghost take a hold upon that and God so corny this half condition and that would had fire on it another hour on it and God shoot it and come straight into his heart and he was filled with the Holy Ghost he was filled with power he was filled with the same blessing they had they couldn't believe it the same power that came on Jews and Noah pondage and then it come to a conclusion of our truth God is no respecter or there's a lot of shock oh my god I feeling we're on a church tonight God is no respecter person but you're honest and heart God check that out [Applause] why did they know okay let's continue talking about Jesus why I didn't know that he was the light how could you know he was delight because the word that was promised was made manifest through him that's all you know so every Sabbath day reading scriptures every Sabbath Jesus been on say no he could not yet be codified a.m. yet so this particular Saturday when they say who won we scripture he rabbi I feel

time from the great white from Luther Wesley Pentecost then the capstone in the top of it is so honed but each one of those stones are so perfectly put together we don't know how they set it it's so perfectly put together though we not promote each enough enough built it a long time ago the previous stands is assemble go into the prophets chamber and watch them seven steps where did they God meet the challenge to bring the comma into the prayers of the king at the top of the steps so the king not coming on to you on your way you iron oh you have to climb up there you have to climb up seven steps the king is on the hill he's on the seventh step Oh hallelujah their Shores we have got to become again the same spirit that was on John he introduced the Messiah he was great on all the prophets so we have got to come to a place again to something that's going to introduce a messiah how will the people that's believing him know it unless they're constantly in the word to know what he is Oh hallelujah the wise shall know it but the way unwise wouldn't know watch so they shall know their God how he appear in the last days is to bring the people back to the world so the bride will know a husband know her mate the revealed word so your husband is the word revealed not understood revealed so therefore you fighting for revelation therefore you fight them to get in the spirit and

get close to the world with our dr. Rivlin you still letting it close to the goal you still have the catalyze so people believe with mysteries they are it no you have to get it because Paul explains it do I know all mysteries and have

many things you you cannot understand it now but when he comes he will guide you to it that's the reason the common of the seals at the finishing of the seventh seal the mystery of God should be finished to know who God is what is how he lives his nature this being your supposed to be all the way up there by that time to bring us to the full structure of sons and daughters of God a church that's wash in the blood of Christ that is the purpose of the seals that is why we have seals to bring us into that the whole purpose of the seals is to bring us into that place know who God is to know what he is to know how he lives because cause objective and motive all the time was to reveal himself because he was too mysterious and he didn't want to remain so mysterious he wanted to come down to man to unfold and reveal himself so we can't make quite a whole mysterious thing again when he was trying to get over that thing to become flesh among us that we can handle him or give the Lord a shout when the word become flesh it becomes light among us I'm almost finished or glory to God he said a promise is the baptism of the spirit throughout all the New Testament and Old Testament
