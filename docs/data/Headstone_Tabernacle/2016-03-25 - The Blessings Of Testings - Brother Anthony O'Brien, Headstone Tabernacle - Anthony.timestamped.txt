[26:19] 1 amen Job chapter 1 and verse one says
[26:23] there was a man in the land of oo whose
[26:26] name was joob and that man was perfect
[26:30] and upright and one that feared God and
[26:33] issued
[26:35] evil and there were born unto him seven

[26:41] also was 7,000 sheep and 3,000 camels
[26:46] and 500 yoke of oxen and 500 she asses
[26:49] and a very great household so that this

[26:55] East and his sons went and feasted in in
[26:58] their houses and everyone his day and

[27:20] cursed God in their hearts thus do did
[27:23] job
[27:25] continually now in verse six says now
[27:27] there was a a day when the sons of God
[27:30] came to present themselves before the
[27:32] Lord and Satan came also among them and
[27:36] the Lord said unto Satan whence Thou
[27:39] come when comest thou then Satan
[27:42] answered the Lord and said from going to
[27:44] and fr in the earth and from walking up
[27:48] and down in it and the Lord said unto
[27:50] Satan hast thou uh considered my servant
[27:53] joob that there is none like him in the
[27:56] earth a perfect and upright man one that
[27:59] feareth God and isth Evil then Satan
[28:03] answered the Lord and said do job fear

[28:23] face and the Lord said unto Satan behold
[28:27] all that he had hath is in thy power

[47:36] when that little apple tree is no bigger
[47:38] than that right there every Apple

[48:31] peculiar people the devil has
[48:33] underestimated us tonight he didn't
[48:36] understand what this book thing was all
[48:38] about but it's too late devil because
[48:41] before the foundation of the world he
[48:43] wrote our names in Blood and he gave us

[49:11] do how he confuses the waves of a human
[49:14] Spirit there's one thing in the soul
[49:17] that is settled in heaven forever that's
[49:20] the word of almighty God and the devil
[49:22] can't change that he is very upset
[49:25] tonight because because he cannot change
[49:28] what is about to happen to you he cannot
[49:31] change what is about to take place in
[49:34] your life he cannot change the blessings
[49:37] that are upon you right
[49:41] now oh somebody say
[49:44] amen
[49:46] hallelujah isn't that
[49:48] right see the devil gave up his estate
[49:52] in heaven Hallelujah isn't that right he
[49:55] forfeited his right
[49:57] Hallelujah as a son and decided to tell
[50:00] lies and decided to glorify himself and
[50:03] magnify himself and he took a portion of
[50:05] heaven with him isn't that right and
[50:07] those Fallen Angels they had a battle up
[50:10] there there was a battle of war going on
[50:13] in the heavenlies a holy war of
[50:16] occupation and God said it's not fit to
[50:18] you to be here so he kicked him out of
[50:21] heaven and he and his angels fell down
[50:24] upon the earth and the battle has
[50:26] started in heaven is continuing down
[50:28] here on Earth so God decide to send his
[50:31] sons too because he know that they're
[50:34] going to give him a run for his money
[50:36] they know that he going to run them out
[50:38] of town when they see the name on the
[50:41] book oh Hallelujah and when you see who
[50:43] your father is when you see what your
[50:45] possession is you chase the devil out of

[51:28] it has to grow it has to draw the
[51:30] moisture from the ground and it has to
[51:32] draw more than what its a lotted portion
[51:35] is he said if you give it plenty of
[51:38] water you have to give it plenty of
[51:40] water and he said when you give it water

[52:54] drink and push out and push out every

[54:51] yourself that you didn't think you could
[54:53] you could get to and you're pushing amen
[54:56] and then a part of your will is
[54:58] dying a part of who you are is
[55:01] rotting it's smelly but there's a
[55:05] process taking place God is transforming

[1:02:26] more here praise God and then I'll uh
[1:02:29] and then I'll switch over believe us th
[1:02:31] this he said um now here's what happens
[1:02:33] sin is what brought sickness into the
[1:02:35] world sickness is as a result of sin so
[1:02:38] he said now before we had any sickness
[1:02:40] we had no sin and When sin came sickness
[1:02:44] was a results of sin so Jesus came to
[1:02:47] rid us of sin and to rid he said there's
[1:02:50] not a gospel preacher in the world but
[1:02:52] what would believe that Jesus Christ
[1:02:54] died for our sins he said well uh that's
[1:02:57] where it's at here he said up this place
[1:02:59] here now watch close he said here's
[1:03:02] here's where he paid the price and then
[1:03:04] he died for a sin as a result of his
[1:03:07] death sickness fell right with it see he
[1:03:11] said in other words if my foot was what
[1:03:13] you wanted to kill he said kill the head
[1:03:15] and you've got the foot see the foot
[1:03:18] goes in with it now said that's when he
[1:03:21] atoned for our sins he atoned for the
[1:03:24] sins results and sickness is an
[1:03:27] attribute of sin and Jesus died for our
[1:03:30] sins and sickness iniquity he said all
[1:03:34] was included in his death for our sins
[1:03:37] he said you see it he said then when he
[1:03:39] died for the sins of the world there at
[1:03:41] Calvary he healed you and you and you
[1:03:45] and you and you he said he healed every
[1:03:48] one of you oh hallelujah hallelujah he
[1:03:53] said you are already he
[1:03:56] oh somebody say amen he said he's
[1:03:59] already forgiven you of your sins if you
[1:04:02] just accept it oh Hallelujah isn't that
[1:04:06] right the price is already paid tonight
[1:04:09] so the devil is only bluffing you
[1:04:11] telling that you can't make it telling
[1:04:13] you that you can't overcome telling you
[1:04:15] that you can't be a son or a daughter of
[1:04:17] God but he's only bluffing you because
[1:04:20] Christ has already given us what it
[1:04:22] takes to overcome the devil when he died
[1:04:25] we died and when he rose we rose with
[1:04:29] him oh hallelujah hallelujah that's why
[1:04:33] the Bible says we are more than
[1:04:36] conquerors through him that loved us we
[1:04:39] are more than Overcomers tonight oh
[1:04:41] Hallelujah we are more than we think we
[1:04:44] are more than we feel we are not what we
[1:04:46] feel we are what God says about us we
[1:04:49] are what the word says about us tonight
[1:04:52] oh Hallelujah and in his word is joy in
[1:04:54] his word is peace

[1:04:59] meekness kindness the love of God in his
[1:05:02] word is the Holy Ghost for you there's a
[1:05:05] promise for you and for your family and
[1:05:07] for your
[1:05:08] children that's what Jesus died for oh
[1:05:13] hallelujah oh Hallelujah give him praise
[1:05:16] tonight amen
[1:05:27] my he said now you don't go to hell
[1:05:29] because you're a sinner said no you go
[1:05:32] to hell because you refuse to accept the
[1:05:35] way away from hell he said there's a
[1:05:38] bypass and he said that's Christ there's
[1:05:41] a bypass from your sickness quick death
[1:05:44] premature grave he said that's through
[1:05:46] Christ but now he said your you sinned
[1:05:49] in the beginning and Christ died for
[1:05:50] your sins therefore he saved you when he
[1:05:53] died he saved you and he healed healed
[1:05:55] you he when he died he took your place
[1:05:59] and now all you have to do is accept it
[1:06:01] by faith and you'll receive it see see
[1:06:04] what I mean now he said now there's
[1:06:06] nothing more to be done already paid

[1:06:10] tonight amen he said you can have it
[1:06:14] right this afternoon he said you can
[1:06:15] have it right now this very minute when
[1:06:19] you believe it your faith meets God's
[1:06:22] requirement to believe that Christ died
[1:06:24] for your sickness when he died for your
[1:06:26] sins and he died for your sins at
[1:06:28] Calvary and accepted upon that basis at
[1:06:31] that moment and you're healed in the
[1:06:34] sight of God see then you go on
[1:06:36] testifying of it believe it amen amen
[1:06:39] isn't that right hallelujah hallelujah
[1:06:43] so Christ died so that we could have
[1:06:44] every right to come into the house of
[1:06:47] God and to sanctify ourselves and to
[1:06:50] wait on the promise of the father

[1:07:53] hallelujah so God has made us citizens
[1:07:55] of the kingdom of God by Jesus Christ
[1:07:58] isn't that right amen amen and we belong
[1:08:01] to a place Heavenly places in Christ
[1:08:05] Jesus because that's our position in
[1:08:07] Christ in Heavenly places not Earthly
[1:08:10] places Earthly places is not your home
[1:08:13] it's not about your job it's not about
[1:08:15] how much money you can make it's not
[1:08:17] about how much money you got in a bank

[1:08:25] there's no man could take that from you
[1:08:27] because only God could put you in your
[1:08:30] place and only in your place can you be
[1:08:34] effective to the kingdom and in the body
[1:08:36] of Christ is where you find your place
[1:08:39] in him oh Hallelujah isn't that right

[1:08:50] with all that is in us to find our place
[1:08:53] in Christ we don't belong in this world
[1:08:56] we don't belong in this in this turmoil
[1:08:58] and This Disaster that they call the
[1:09:00] world Hallelujah isn't that right this
[1:09:02] world is headed for funeral service this
[1:09:05] world is headed for the end the
[1:09:07] inevitable end they cannot stop the
[1:09:09] mouth of God that has already spoken

[1:09:15] already judged isn't that right
[1:09:17] hallelujah hallelujah Hal God has
[1:09:19] already pronounced judgment over them
[1:09:22] and God has pronounced a blessing for us
[1:09:24] here tonight
[1:09:25] who can stay with his word those who can
[1:09:28] endure to the end oh isn't that right
[1:09:33] Jesus said he that endureth to the end
[1:09:35] the shame shall be saved he said many
[1:09:38] will run to and fro and and and there'll
[1:09:40] be earthquakes and pestilences
[1:09:42] earthquakes in diverse places isn't that
[1:09:45] right many false prophets arise up and
[1:09:48] false teachings and leading the Sheep
[1:09:50] away but those that will endure to the
[1:09:52] end the same shall be saved God had to
[1:09:56] put something special in us in our time
[1:09:58] and in our season to give us what it
[1:10:01] take to endure to the end this is not
[1:10:04] for the faint of heart but this is for
[1:10:07] those who could endure unto the
[1:10:13] end Jesus said a servant is no greater
[1:10:16] than his Lord that's right he said the
[1:10:18] world hated me before I even came in it
[1:10:21] and he said if the world hates me
[1:10:22] they'll hate you too isn't that right he
[1:10:25] said they deliver you up to be afflicted
[1:10:27] and persecute you he said but don't you
[1:10:29] worry I'll give you the words to speak
[1:10:31] to them I'll put words in your mouth to
[1:10:34] say to them and to prophesy up unto them
[1:10:37] and to preach the gospel he said that is
[1:10:39] when the end will come not all these
[1:10:41] signs and terrifying things he say don't
[1:10:44] look for that but he said this gospel
[1:10:46] must be preached then shall the End come
[1:10:49] oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:10:52] isn't that right praise God Amen okay
[1:10:56] where was I amen so God has made US
[1:10:58] citizens of the kingdom of God by Jesus
[1:11:01] Christ isn't that right Ephesians 2 and
[1:11:03] verse 12 says that in that time you were
[1:11:06] without Christ being aliens from the
[1:11:09] Commonwealth of Israel and strangers
[1:11:11] from the covenants of Promise having no
[1:11:14] hope and without God in the world but
[1:11:17] now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes
[1:11:19] were were far off are made nigh by the
[1:11:23] blood of Christ for he is is our peace
[1:11:26] isn't that right who hath made both one
[1:11:29] and hath broken down the middle wall of
[1:11:31] partition between us oh there was a wall
[1:11:34] separating you from being a Son of God
[1:11:37] there was a wall separating us from
[1:11:39] being all that we could do but Jesus
[1:11:41] broke down that wall Tonight Paul called
[1:11:43] it the wall of partition between us he
[1:11:46] said having abolished in his flesh the
[1:11:48] enity even the law of Commandments
[1:11:51] contained in ordinances for to make
[1:11:53] himself of Twain of one one new man so
[1:11:56] making peace he said and that he might
[1:11:58] reconcile both unto God in one body by
[1:12:01] the cross having slain the enity thereby
[1:12:05] and came and preached peace to you which
[1:12:07] were a far off and to them that were
[1:12:09] nigh for through him we have both access
[1:12:14] by one Spirit unto the father oh isn't
[1:12:18] that right he said now therefore ye are
[1:12:20] no more strangers and foreigners you are
[1:12:24] not a stranger here tonight
[1:12:25] you are not a foreigner here tonight
[1:12:27] here what you are he said but fellow
[1:12:29] citizens with the Saints and with the
[1:12:32] household of God oh isn't that right and
[1:12:35] are built upon the foundations of the
[1:12:38] Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ
[1:12:41] himself being the Chief
[1:12:43] Cornerstone oh hallah isn't that right
[1:12:46] in whom all the building fitly framed
[1:12:48] together growth up into an Holy Temple
[1:12:50] in the Lord in whom ye also are builded
[1:12:53] together for an habitation of God
[1:12:55] through the spirit hallelujah oh
[1:12:58] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah isn't
[1:13:00] that right hallelujah amen amen so we
[1:13:02] become joint a isn't that right and I
[1:13:04] looked up the meaning of the joint air a
[1:13:06] joint air according to law reference uh
[1:13:09] this definition here gives says it's a
[1:13:11] person who shares with another or others
[1:13:16] the right to inherit a person's money
[1:13:18] property or title when that person dies
[1:13:23] so apparently you only become a joint
[1:13:25] air it only becomes effective when that
[1:13:28] person dies oh Hallelujah Hal isn't that
[1:13:31] right you were born in sin shaping
[1:13:33] iniquity coming the world speaking lies
[1:13:36] Christ knew what you had in you he knew
[1:13:38] that you would be a Son of God but in
[1:13:40] order for it to be effective he had to
[1:13:42] die and his death put a law into effect
[1:13:47] Hallelujah his death put a law into
[1:13:49] motion oh Hallelujah the law of Christ
[1:13:52] Jesus is what sets us free to tonight
[1:13:55] from the law of sin and death oh
[1:13:59] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah no
[1:14:01] wonder there will be a bride that will
[1:14:04] not see death because there's a higher
[1:14:06] Lord tonight that has connected us to
[1:14:09] Christ by his blood and by his sacrifice
[1:14:13] and has made us Kings and Priests oh
[1:14:16] somebody's not hearing me tonight no
[1:14:19] wonder that John said we shall rain on
[1:14:21] the earth because his name was redeemed
[1:14:24] from out of the Lamb's Book of
[1:14:27] Life oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:14:33] hallelujah oh you've been made a joint
[1:14:36] air with Christ hallu hallelujah
[1:14:39] hallelujah whatever the father has you

[1:39:42] servant come and say this thing happened
[1:39:44] and this servant come and then this
[1:39:46] servant come it all happen at once
[1:39:49] that's the kind of trial to send

[1:40:46] meeting with the Lord and Satan isn't
[1:40:49] that right Hallelujah there's another
[1:40:51] one the chapter 2 he said and again
[1:40:53] there was a day when the sons of God
[1:40:54] came to present themselves before the
[1:40:55] Lord and Satan came also among them and
[1:40:58] presented himself before the Lord back
[1:41:00] in church again and the Lord said unto
[1:41:02] Satan from whence comest thou and Satan
[1:41:05] answered the Lord said from going to and
[1:41:07] fro in the earth and from walking up and
[1:41:08] down in it and the Lord said unto Satan

[1:41:47] will give for his life but put for thine
[1:41:49] hand now and touch his bone and his
[1:41:51] flesh and he will curse thee to the face
[1:41:54] again the challenge goes out isn't that
[1:41:55] right and the Lord said unto Satan
[1:41:57] behold he is in thine hand but save his
[1:41:59] life and Satan went forth from the
[1:42:01] presence of the Lord and smoke joob with
[1:42:04] sore boils from the sore of his feet
[1:42:06] onto his crown his entire body is
[1:42:10] covered in Affliction Hallelujah isn't
