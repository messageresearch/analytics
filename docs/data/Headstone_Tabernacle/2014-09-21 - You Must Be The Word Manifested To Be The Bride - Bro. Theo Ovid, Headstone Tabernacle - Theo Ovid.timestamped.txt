[30:57] isn't that right and then Joshua told

[31:02] to your wives sanctify yourself every
[31:04] one of you let no man come at his wife
[31:05] or within 3 days you will see the glory
[31:07] of God it's a process of getting ready a
[31:10] lot of people you see it's a process God
[31:12] God Moses presumed because his mother
[31:14] told him stuff that he was a special
[31:16] child that he was deliverer
[31:18] intellectually he knew that but he
[31:19] didn't have the empowerment to do that
[31:22] and you have to be
[31:24] empowered to fulfill God's purpose
[31:27] that's why it's called virtue power for
[31:30] service not your service God's service
[31:33] power to be in service for the Lord
[31:36] that's when God put you in his service
[31:38] that's when he sign you up and he rank
[31:39] you and he put the little tag on you I
[31:41] don't know what that put the tag on you
[31:43] and so on that you have ranked now cuz
[31:45] you're now empowered then you could stop
[31:47] power to stop the demons that get out so
[31:50] so take left take left go right you this
[31:53] one go right you take left that's power
[31:56] that's what what Jesus had is isn't that
[31:59] right power to cast out Devils is that
[32:01] power to prophesy power to overcome
[32:04] power to pray some of you can't pray and
[32:06] you can't pray and you can't pray you
[32:07] can talk long on the cell phone but you
[32:08] can't pray and you can't pray and you
[32:10] can't pray and can't pray can't talk to
[32:11] God but when power come you have power
[32:14] to pray you have the power power to
[32:17] forgive and here there big one there's a
[32:19] big one coming now power to say I'm
[32:21] sorry there a big one there a big one
[32:23] lots of people don't like
[32:26] that
[32:29] [Applause]
[32:30] lot of people don't like to say the
[32:31] sorry because sorry means like you're
[32:33] wrong and you don't want to be wrong you
[32:34] want to be right so sorry means that
[32:37] you're little less down or you're lower
[32:39] down or you make a mistake make it out
[32:40] you don't want to say sorry but sorry
[32:42] means you're little it's small if you
[32:45] want to how powerful are take a bucket
[32:46] of water and take your big fist and
[32:48] punch in that bucket of water and see
[32:50] the whole you remain when you pull it
[32:53] out if you have a hole when you punch
[32:55] that bucket of water and come out you're
[32:56] really powerful
[32:58] yeah you didn't get that one take a
[33:00] bucket of water in it and take your fist
[33:03] and punch a ho and just see if you see a
[33:06] hole there if a hole is there you are
[33:08] really powerful if the hole is not there
[33:10] you have to come and rethink the kind of
[33:12] power that you have so you have to be
[33:15] conscious of your littleness conscious
[33:18] how small we are conscious of the grace
[33:20] of God conscious if wasn't for the grace
[33:22] of God we couldn't be here this morning
[33:24] conscious of the blood of Jesus that
[33:27] amen died to redeem us and to reconcile
[33:31] us back to God because because we lost
[33:34] the
[33:34] connection and and God restore back the
[33:37] wireless connection and you do have no
[33:39] room in charges to pay amen When you
[33:42] pray it's all Wireless you don't you
[33:45] don't have any connection to plugin and
[33:46] so on you don't have to pay for the
[33:48] connection you just you just call on
[33:51] Jesus and the antenna is
[33:54] active hallelujah it's not shut down
[33:57] because when Adam fell he sent angels to
[34:00] guard the tree but now he sent angels to
[34:02] try to drive you back to the tree so God
[34:04] line his Wireless line is always alive
[34:06] and active nothing is that brick in the
[34:09] channel is when you ready to call he's
[34:11] ready to answer glor that's why you had

[34:20] corridor come on now give the Lord some
[34:22] Praises even if the door is not open yet

[35:59] chapter 14 two portion of scriptures
[36:01] this morning St John 1 we want to read
[36:04] from
[36:05] 29-33 and St John 14 12-
[36:16] 21 the next day John see Jes see Jesus
[36:20] come unto him and said Behold the Lamb
[36:23] of God which taketh away the sin of the
[36:25] world this is he of whom I said after me
[36:28] cometh a man which is preferred before
[36:30] me for he was before me and I knew him
[36:33] not but that he should be made manifest
[36:36] to Israel therefore am I come baptizing
[36:39] with water and John bear record saying I
[36:43] saw the Spirit descending from heaven
[36:47] like a dove and it Abode upon him and I
[36:51] knew him not but he that sent me to
[36:56] baptize with water the same said unto me
[37:00] upon whom Thou shalt see the spirit
[37:04] descending and remaining on him the same
[37:08] is he which baptizeth with the Holy
[37:12] Ghost and reading in John 14 reading
[37:16] from verse
[37:25] 12
[37:27] verily verily I say unto you he that
[37:30] believeth on me the works that I do
[37:32] shall he do also and Greater Works than
[37:35] these shall he do because I go unto my
[37:38] father and whatsoever ye shall ask in my
[37:41] name that will I do that the father may
[37:43] be glorified in the son if he shall ask
[37:47] anything in my name I will do it if you
[37:49] love me keep my Commandments and I will
[37:52] pray the father and he shall give you
[37:56] another another comforter that he may
[37:58] abide with you forever even the spirit
[38:03] of Truth whom the world cannot receive
[38:06] because it seeth him not neither knoweth
[38:08] him but he know him for he dwelleth with
[38:12] you and shall be in you I will not leave
[38:15] you comfortless I will come to you yet a
[38:19] little while and the world see me no
[38:21] more but ye shall see me but because I
[38:24] live he shall live also at that day he
[38:27] shall know that I am in my father ye in
[38:30] me and I in you he that ha my
[38:34] Commandments and keepeth them he it is
[38:36] that loveth me and he that loveth me
[38:40] shall be loved of my father and I will
[38:42] love him I will manifest myself to him
[38:45] let's pray father we thank you for your
[38:47] holy word and Lord we are right under a
[38:51] promise of another comforter even the
[38:54] spirit of Truth they were already
[38:56] comforted by Christ among them the
[38:58] Living Word but he promised another
[39:01] comforter which was the spirit to be
[39:03] indwelling in them oh God release that
[39:05] comforter here this morning and fill
[39:07] every Hungry Heart in Jesus name I ask
[39:10] it amen and amen you may be seated oh
[39:13] blessed be the name of the
[39:15] Lord thank you Lord oh blessed be the
[39:18] name of the lord it's so good to have a
[39:21] praise in your heart you always have
[39:23] something to thank God and I think I saw
[39:26] noticed somebody said um once you're
[39:27] above ground you have you have something
[39:29] to praise
[39:30] God you're above the ground you're alive
[39:34] you still have health and strength
[39:36] you're above ground you have something
[39:37] to praise God about amen so this morning
[39:40] I have a title you must be the word
[39:42] manifested to be the bride amen that's
[39:45] my title this morning you must be the
[39:48] word manifested to be the bride and have
[39:51] an inspiration until you are
[39:53] convinced you cannot be concerned
[39:58] until you are
[40:00] convinced you cannot be
[40:03] concerned now praise God so
[40:09] God will never be able watch we will
[40:12] never be able to have a church until God
[40:16] gets a foundation to lay on he will
[40:19] never build his church and a bunch of
[40:21] nonsense he has to come on his word or
[40:24] he won't won't come at all
[40:26] amen isn't that right I'm only building
[40:30] the all is close at hand when you're
[40:32] going to see something happen when
[40:34] something is going to take place and all
[40:36] this background here has only been
[40:38] laying a foundation for a short quick
[40:40] message that will shake the whole nation
[40:43] so for God to build for God to add for
[40:45] God to work there have to be a
[40:47] foundation for him to work with isn't
[40:49] that right and if God is to work with
[40:51] you there has to be a place prepared and
[40:53] that's why John the Baptist was sent he
[40:55] was sent to prepare a place for messiah
[40:58] so God always have preparation made he
[41:02] doesn't just come he come on what has
[41:04] been prepared isn't that right amen now
[41:06] in St John 663 it says it's the spirit
[41:09] that Quicken it the flesh propit at
[41:12] nothing the words that I speak they are
[41:16] spirit and they are life amen Jesus is
[41:20] saying words are also spirit amen words
[41:25] are also life amen it's not just words
[41:28] amen now watch 1 John 56 says this is he
[41:32] that came by water and blood even Jesus
[41:35] Christ not by water only but by water
[41:39] and blood it is the spirit that bear
[41:42] witness because the spirit is truth amen
[41:46] not
[41:47] information Spirit is truth amen that's
[41:49] why in court you said speak the whole
[41:51] truth nothing but the truth and and so
[41:52] help me God and so on because it have
[41:54] whole truth and you could speak
[41:56] something that goes beyond what is true
[41:58] things that you want to color it and
[41:59] flavor it with so they ask you to speak
[42:02] the whole truth and not take back the
[42:04] truth isn't that right so when Jesus say
[42:07] I am the way and the truth he's not just
[42:09] talking from a letter standpoint he's
[42:11] talking about the spirit itself so it's
[42:13] not just words it's Spirit life makes it
[42:17] truth and Jesus said You shall know the
[42:19] truth and the truth shall set you
[42:22] free now a lot of people know the words
[42:26] a lot of people know what is right and
[42:28] what is wrong but they're not empowered
[42:30] to live what is right so when he say you
[42:33] shall know the truth and the truth shall
[42:34] set you free he's not talking about
[42:36] something intellectual he's not talking
[42:38] about some understanding he's talking
[42:40] about that Spirit to come inside of you
[42:43] to release you from your past to release
[42:46] you from your sin to release you from
[42:49] your
[42:50] guilt and set you free and who the son
[42:53] of man set free is free indeed
[42:56] [Applause]
[42:58] oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so
[43:01] truth come to release
[43:04] you isn't that rightall now Luke 8:4 and
[43:09] when much people were gathered together
[43:10] they would come to him out of every city
[43:12] he spake a
[43:13] parable a saw went out to se he swed
[43:16] some fell by the wayside it was
[43:18] strutting down fowls of the air devoured
[43:20] it some fell upon a rock soon as it was
[43:22] sprung up it withered away because it
[43:24] lacked moisture some fell among Thorns
[43:26] The Thorn sprang up and choked it others
[43:29] fell on good ground sprang up bear fruit
[43:31] 100 fold when he had said these things
[43:33] he cried he had an air to hear Let Him
[43:35] hear and the disciples asked him saying
[43:38] what might this Parable be amen and he
[43:40] said unto you it is given to know the
[43:42] mysteries of the kingdom of God but unto
[43:45] others in Parables that seeing they
[43:48] might not see and hearing they might not
[43:51] understand so a parable is really Hidden
[43:54] Mysteries that's right veiled as stories
[43:57] but in them have Hidden Truths to be
[44:00] revealed to who is elected which is the
[44:03] children of the Kingdom isn't that right
[44:06] so then Jesus begin to interpret that he
[44:07] said unto you is given to know the
[44:09] Mysteries he said now the parable is
[44:11] this the seed is the word of God that's
[44:13] right
[44:15] amen now watch he said my words are
[44:18] Spirit my words are life but now he said
[44:21] my word is a
[44:22] seed
[44:24] amen so God takes Spirit Make It Word
[44:28] take word make it seed yes amen and that
[44:32] seed is what comes into you that's
[44:34] right could we give the Lord a praise
[44:38] than those by the wayside that adhere
[44:41] then come at the Devil take it out the
[44:42] word out of their hearts least they
[44:44] should believe and be saved the under
[44:46] the rock a day when they hear receive
[44:48] the word with joy but they have no root
[44:50] which for a while believe in time of
[44:52] Temptation fall away and that which fell
[44:55] among tor a day which when they heard go
[44:57] forth and are choked with cares and
[45:01] riches and pleasures of this life and
[45:05] bring no fruit to
[45:07] Perfection but that on good ground are
[45:10] they which here we go which in an honest
[45:13] and good heart having heard the word
[45:16] keep it and bring forth fruit with
[45:19] patience fruit with patience oh
[45:22] Hallelujah the husband man waited for
[45:24] the rain waited with patience for the
[45:26] fruit of the earth to come forth oh
[45:28] Hallelujah this is not instan thing
[45:31] because character is not a gift
[45:33] character is a victory and character
[45:35] means that you went through something so
[45:37] God is interested in you going through
[45:39] something and not asking him to take you
[45:42] out of something but asking you to help
[45:44] you give the grace to go through the
[45:46] stuff that you need to go through in
[45:48] order to have character because
[45:50] character is not a blessing from the
[45:52] Lord character is a victory oh could I
[45:55] hear some Praises in the
[45:57] [Applause]
[46:01] house so God's son this un spoke
[46:04] Original Seed was his example seed and
[46:08] that's why when we want to look at the
[46:10] template we look to Jesus when we look
[46:12] to see how God handled his sons and
[46:14] treat his sons we look to Jesus because
[46:16] he was the example seed son and when
[46:18] Jesus received the spirit we know when
[46:20] Jesus went Jesus didn't went and put the
[46:22] advertisement on papers and said here am
[46:23] I I am the Messiah Jesus was led by the
[46:26] spirit Into the Wilderness for his place
[46:29] of trying to be
[46:33] tested by the word dry word and Jesus
[46:38] overcame by it is written not I'm
[46:41] feeling this he had no feeling to feel
[46:44] it was dry it was Desert all he had was
[46:47] Rock word it is written it is written it
[46:50] is written you feel something I have no
[46:52] feeling in this it is written it is
[46:55] written it is written and when the devil
[46:57] start to quote he said it is also
[47:00] written glory to God are you with me now
[47:04] so this was the example seed son
[47:08] behavior and operation so watch what is
[47:11] life was when the spirit poured upon him
[47:14] after his baptism and the Holy Ghost
[47:16] came upon him the very life that he
[47:18] produced that same here we go that same
[47:21] watering Spirit of the Holy Ghost will
[47:24] bring forth the same kind of life doing
[47:28] the same thing that he did so now we
[47:31] find out the spirit is also watering
[47:34] spirit so the Holy Ghost is the watering
[47:37] spirit and if you have the watering
[47:40] spirit that Spirit coming for seed right
[47:42] that mean not God just sending water to
[47:45] water no you have to have seed for that
[47:47] watering Spirit to come upon and if that
[47:50] water in Spirit come upon that seed
[47:53] something has to take place
[47:56] because water and Seed does connect a
[47:59] certain way something has happened when
[48:02] water strike
[48:04] seed oh give the Lord some Praises
[48:07] people so you have a seed it's dry it
[48:10] looks like it's dead it has no power in
[48:13] it it looks like it's just a seed laying
[48:16] there that could be a oak tree that
[48:18] could be a coconut tree whatever it is
[48:20] it's looking dry you could walk past it
[48:23] you could store it in the cupboard you
[48:25] could St there for years but if you only
[48:27] let water touch it if you only let water
[48:30] come on it if you only let that water in
[48:33] spirit strike that seed something going
[48:36] to happen because Jesus said my ways are
[48:40] Spirit oh and they life is the spirit
[48:44] that Quicken it oh so you have to sit
[48:48] here and get in the spirit when you
[48:50] understand that nothing going to stop
[48:52] you from worshiping when you understand
[48:55] that nothing going to stop you from
[48:57] praising your God because it's the
[48:59] spirit that quickened the flesh profited
[49:04] [Applause]
[49:10] nothing
[49:12] hallelujah
[49:13] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah do you
[49:18] understand so there's a bit of teaching
[49:19] this morning the word is a
[49:23] seed amen Jesus now watch watch so watch
[49:28] the same watering Spirit of the Holy
[49:30] Ghost will bring forth the same kind of
[49:32] life doing the same thing that he did if
[49:36] it is if it's the same seed son of God's
[49:40] seed will bring forth a son of God's
[49:42] seed in other words every seed after its
[49:45] kind according to Genesis 1:11
[49:47] Hallelujah so son of God's seed will
[49:49] produce son of God's seed isn't that
[49:51] right now Jesus already prophesied and
[49:53] we read it in John 14:12 the same works
[49:55] I
[49:56] do I'm not hearing you shall you do also
[50:00] so what is Jesus saying the same seed
[50:03] that I have going to be inside of you

[1:03:44] Moses he kill them and raise up a whole

[1:04:31] Evangelist we are not talking about a
[1:04:33] pastor we talking about God

[1:04:44] himself it's amazing how this omnipotent
[1:04:49] all powerful God subject himself to his
[1:04:53] own laws
[1:04:54] it's amazing that he doesn't break the
[1:04:57] laws that are set in motion Hallelujah
[1:05:01] he has to come by the word he have to
[1:05:03] lose a prophecy a virgin shall conceive
[1:05:06] for he himself to come by prophecy

[1:05:11] David's prophecy and the David said I
[1:05:13] shall not suffer my holy on in
[1:05:14] corruption and Jesus had to connect with
[1:05:17] that prophecy to say destroy this body
[1:05:19] in three days I'll raise it up Jesus
[1:05:21] connect with David in order to say a
[1:05:24] testimony of where he is at that's how
[1:05:27] interconnected the word is this word is
[1:05:30] God every page is God God is the word in
[1:05:34] the beginning was the word the word was
[1:05:36] with God and the Word was God and the
[1:05:38] word is a seed and the prophet bring the

[1:05:55] them power of the world sir some people
[1:05:58] have a discernment of it some people
[1:06:00] recognizes it and they could respond to
[1:06:03] it like that Centurion came up to Jesus
[1:06:05] and he said master I have a servant he
[1:06:08] is sick I'm not worthy for you to come
[1:06:10] under my roof now there a big shot

[1:06:20] himself he's getting the right Viewpoint
[1:06:22] you see when you recognize how small you
[1:06:24] are and this get this big shot spirit
[1:06:27] and this arrogant attitude and this
[1:06:29] proud and you you and like like God owe
[1:06:31] you something and and and no no you have
[1:06:33] to get out of that atmosphere Al
[1:06:35] together and get a humble heart get
[1:06:37] honest heart get a simple Heart Lord you

[1:06:44] instructions by the word now when the
[1:06:46] guide come and say I'm taking you up the
[1:06:47] up the den is Lions there you say Lions
[1:06:49] where I'm going back there see so when

[1:06:54] where you could be led by the tutor led
[1:06:56] by the guide and he says there's Lions
[1:06:58] up there they say Lord as long as my
[1:07:00] hands is yours I have no problem with
[1:07:01] the Lions just keep on leading see you
[1:07:03] want to take instructions if the pastor
[1:07:05] give you instructions that the pastor
[1:07:06] that's not the guide that's the pastor
[1:07:08] and you don't want to listen follow
[1:07:09] through and Obey I mean when the guy
[1:07:11] come you will say no you see what I'm
[1:07:12] saying now you got to be able to obey in
[1:07:14] the little
[1:07:17] things isn't that right isn't that right
[1:07:20] read the Bible somebody ask brother a
[1:07:22] question how can I get deeper in the
[1:07:24] love of God he said read the Bible and
[1:07:26] pray every day read your Bible and pray
[1:07:29] read the word and it's very simple you
[1:07:31] say put a thing on your ears no read the
[1:07:33] Bible and pray that is all get a
[1:07:35] prayerful Spirit commit your life into
[1:07:37] the Lord you start the day right you put
[1:07:39] God in front and you're looking to trust
[1:07:42] him yeah you're looking to trust him and
[1:07:44] and he becomes your trust and you
[1:07:45] recognize afterwards you start to let
[1:07:47] see God active in your operation active
[1:07:50] in your life you see when God is out is
[1:07:52] you running your show
[1:07:54] you on your own you going here you're
[1:07:56] doing this and you're doing that and
[1:07:58] it's you and you and all about you but
[1:08:00] when but when you surrender and this is
[1:08:03] what God wants then you begin to see God
[1:08:05] you have a miserable class you could
[1:08:07] pray God cool L children down so you're
[1:08:09] a teacher and you don't say well you
[1:08:11] know God have nothing to do with you
[1:08:12] teaching no God in the teaching too
[1:08:14] because you have an opportunity to put
[1:08:15] seed in those children that will set
[1:08:17] them in the right part of life so all of
[1:08:19] that is that you're concerned sometime
[1:08:21] they come from stressful families
[1:08:23] stressful home nobody care for them
[1:08:24] nobody love them and the day somebody
[1:08:26] take time off to show some love and some
[1:08:28] care and concern you're surprised to
[1:08:29] know at that response and that's the
[1:08:31] whole thing some people come and they
[1:08:33] beat the people up beat the people in
[1:08:34] church up because that's the easy thing
[1:08:35] to do everybody know they're born in
[1:08:37] sship iniquity they have issues in their
[1:08:39] own life the pastor come on big sck and
[1:08:41] put licks you know put licks and
[1:08:43] everybody say yes yes yes yes and
[1:08:45] especially those who can't control theel
[1:08:46] they like people to control them they
[1:08:48] people like that that is why dictators
[1:08:50] are necessary in some cases not me I
[1:08:53] know not applying for that post I have
[1:08:55] no desire to be there that's why have
[1:08:57] dictators because people don't want
[1:08:59] internal self- discipline so they need a
[1:09:01] strong man and when the strong man come
[1:09:03] the strong man say left turn they say
[1:09:04] yes sir right turn yes
[1:09:07] sir and they feel in obedience to the
[1:09:09] strong man but God like to say will thou
[1:09:12] be made
[1:09:13] whole Peter love as thou me oh you know
[1:09:17] I love you feed my Lambs feed my love is
[1:09:19] D me P how they get a little pressure CU
[1:09:22] Jesus PES them on you really love
[1:09:25] me and that kind of pushing pushing
[1:09:28] pushing Lord know his all things you
[1:09:29] mean give my break out of that now
[1:09:32] pressing some Nubs are disturbing me and
[1:09:34] I don't want to be disturbing in my
[1:09:36] spirit like that but Jesus was pushing
[1:09:38] an emphasis to show him he has to go
[1:09:40] deeper than where he's at come on now
[1:09:42] come on now come on now and and and and
[1:09:45] as we go forward you have to go deeper
[1:09:47] than where you're at and that's why I
[1:09:49] had to challenge you this
[1:09:51] morning oh Hallelujah Oh Glory my my my
[1:09:56] okay let's go now watch so the watch
[1:09:58] okay let me go further now the AR Noah
[1:10:00] AR was made of go go for wood and
[1:10:02] him wood it's Hollow everything is taken
[1:10:06] out of it but anybody seeing the
[1:10:09] material that Noah used were they going
[1:10:11] to laugh at him because that material
[1:10:13] was going to take in water and sink now
[1:10:16] God is not a fool God is the fun of
[1:10:18] wisdom so God let Noah take a soft wood
[1:10:22] that is very absorbent
[1:10:24] because God is bringing a further
[1:10:25] Revelation to pitch it on the inside and
[1:10:28] outside because God want the pitch to

[1:16:38] need people that are convinced of these
[1:16:42] promises convinced that God going to
[1:16:44] keep his word sir convinced what what
[1:16:48] will make a old man like Abraham testify
[1:16:50] he going to have a son and you know his
[1:16:52] wife is as Bur as bar could be what he
[1:16:55] was convinced it was PE to him it was a
[1:16:58] revelation to him even his wife laugh
[1:17:01] Hallelujah but God didn't talk to his
[1:17:03] wife God talk to him so because his wife
[1:17:05] was laughing he had to have faith for
[1:17:07] himself and her also if he not allow her
[1:17:11] to throw his Fe off then all fall
[1:17:16] down if if Abraham was an emotional man
[1:17:19] and a man p a like a fleshly kind of man
[1:17:23] when your wife say boy you know you
[1:17:25] believe that you see how old I am you
[1:17:28] will get to in that but but the thing
[1:17:31] about it is that Sarah end up tying up
[1:17:34] Abraham to go with hagga because he he
[1:17:37] leave that the interpretation had to
[1:17:39] come that way but God says true Sarah
[1:17:42] thy wife it have no other interpretation
[1:17:45] than that that is how I saying it and
[1:17:48] saying No Other Woman it's true Sarah
[1:17:50] that is my mind concerning this issue
[1:17:52] and if God say to you come on
[1:17:54] now come on
[1:17:56] [Applause]
[1:17:57] [Music]

[1:19:41] conscience and your memory and your
[1:19:43] affection and your reasoning You're
[1:19:44] motivated by the promise of God because
[1:19:47] John was so convinced of the expectation
[1:19:50] and fulfillment of the promise John said
[1:19:53] there was one standing among you I don't
[1:19:56] know who he
[1:19:58] is but he going to baptize you with
[1:20:02] [Applause]
[1:20:06] fire what what what would mck John say

[1:20:12] convinced that he begin to speak at
[1:20:14] present tense he said I don't know him
[1:20:16] but the one who told me to baptize with
[1:20:18] water told me the one that you see the
[1:20:21] spirit coming on and remaining on him
[1:20:24] that is the one that going to baptize
[1:20:27] with the Holy
[1:20:32] Ghost John see John living by faith
[1:20:38] preaching my faith he don't know if
[1:20:40] Jesus is tall dark fair skin fat thin he
[1:20:43] don't know what Jesus look like he don't

[1:20:47] know the one who told him to be baptized
[1:20:49] told him that the one you see the spirit
[1:20:51] so John only looking for Spirit he is
[1:20:53] baptizing but looking for Spirit he is
[1:20:56] hearing word or looking for Spirit he is
[1:20:58] baptizing and preaching but he looking
[1:21:00] for the spirit you looking for somebody

[1:25:59] flesh being Anointed with the spirit of
[1:26:02] God produced the word of God made
[1:26:05] manifest the flesh so Jesus was the
[1:26:08] Flesh of God the word he was the word
[1:26:12] but he needed the spirit to come upon
[1:26:14] him to make it manifest so the fullness
[1:26:18] of the Spirit came down upon that son
[1:26:21] you are not going to get the fullness
[1:26:24] you are going to get your measure oh
[1:26:26] give the Lord some Praises people
[1:26:29] Hallelujah Jesus receiv received the
[1:26:31] fullness but you receive the measure
[1:26:34] just like the ocean that's right just
[1:26:36] like the water and the ocean you take a
[1:26:38] little spoonful of water and you have
[1:26:40] all the ocean there the contents of it
[1:26:44] if you take chemicals of the ocean water
[1:26:46] you have in a spoon the same content of
[1:26:48] that spoon of water is what is in the
[1:26:49] ocean you are not the ocean the what the
[1:26:54] content is what you have so when you
[1:26:56] have a little bit of God in you all that
[1:26:58] was in God all the content of God all
[1:27:01] the mechanics and the chemicals of God
[1:27:04] is inside of you a little of God is God

[1:27:12] chemistry of God inside of you a little
[1:27:14] on of God is God inside of you
[1:27:17] Hallelujah you you have the fullness but
[1:27:19] you have a measure a measure of power a
[1:27:21] me measure of overcoming a measure of
[1:27:23] witness Hallelujah a measure of
[1:27:29] strength oh Glory Hallelujah so listen
[1:27:33] to this so watch so then watch Christ
[1:27:36] mean right the anointed one flesh be
[1:27:38] with the spirit of God produce the word
[1:27:39] of God he here we go he was God's word
[1:27:42] made manifest and now he died here we go
[1:27:47] in order to pay the debt of your high
[1:27:50] breeding that you could die to
[1:27:53] yourself until you are no more yourself
[1:27:58] but be filled with his word believing
[1:28:01] his word then the holy spirit that was
[1:28:04] in him comes down to water that word to
[1:28:08] make it
[1:28:09] grow Hallelujah so you see all this
[1:28:12] money gospel all this blessing gospel it
[1:28:14] can't work because all the blessing
[1:28:18] doesn't give
[1:28:19] character it has to come to a place
[1:28:21] that's why I get it I'll just say it the
[1:28:23] Dynamics have to drive the people to
[1:28:26] Calvary people need to die who do you
[1:28:28] hear saying I hate
[1:28:30] myself but all these selfie cameras now
[1:28:33] taking a picture of themselves they love
[1:28:35] themselves and then technology come to
[1:28:37] make could even help theel some more
[1:28:40] don't they have selfies people love
[1:28:43] themselves but job say I hate myself I
[1:28:46] Repent in dust and Ashes it's a
[1:28:48] stripping of self that man must come to
[1:28:52] which is the cross because only there
[1:28:54] you really meet Jesus it's only there
[1:28:57] you get the Breakthrough into the Holy
[1:28:58] Ghost you are restored to Eden by The
[1:29:01] Altar and through the
[1:29:03] [Applause]
[1:29:05] altar so watch that he might reconcile
[1:29:09] us back to the Sons and Daughters of God
[1:29:12] that through the church through the
[1:29:13] church might flow the same life by the
[1:29:16] word continuing listen the word made
[1:29:21] being manifested as it was in Christ
[1:29:24] Christ was God's word made manifest say
[1:29:28] that after me Christ Christ was God's
[1:29:30] word God's word made manifest man say it
[1:29:34] again Christ Christ was God's word word
[1:29:37] made manifest so therefore the bride

[1:31:35] about no testimony Christ postbook no
[1:31:38] we're talking about a life that begins
[1:31:40] to flow virtue begins to flow a power
[1:31:44] begins to flow as about to pray for the
[1:31:46] sick of power comes there when you come
[1:31:48] into a sick room as you walk in the
[1:31:50] devils in that sick room of sickness the
[1:31:53] devil's know time to leave just get
[1:31:54] ready get get ready we we have to go now
[1:31:57] other Devils talking to other Devils
[1:31:58] saying let's go let's go they are coming
[1:31:59] they are coming they are coming we feel
[1:32:01] them coming nearer because virtue is
[1:32:03] emanating all around you virtue power as
[1:32:06] you walk into the hospital room as you
[1:32:08] walk into the sick room a power is going
[1:32:10] inside of there with you and them Devils
[1:32:12] know to eject exit take the leave and
[1:32:15] they leave before you even get there and
[1:32:17] by the time you get there it's time to
[1:32:18] pronounce the blessings of
[1:32:20] God
[1:32:22] don't you want to see that I want to see
[1:32:24] that don't you want to see that that's
[1:32:26] what God promised a perfect Church
[1:32:28] walking in order oh Hallelujah okay
[1:32:31] let's continue here now now watch watch
[1:32:34] and he died he gave his life that he
[1:32:36] might send the spirit take his body up
[1:32:39] and send the spirit back to water pay
[1:32:42] the redeeming Price He that believeth in
[1:32:44] me then he comes the Holy Spirit to
[1:32:46] water the same word now watch the word
[1:32:49] itself was lost Through the Ages so when
[1:32:52] the spirit come the spirit couldn't come
[1:32:54] to water the word because the word
[1:32:57] itself was lost so God have us to come
[1:33:01] to gather up the scattered word and tie
[1:33:03] up the Loose Ends to restore the seed of
[1:33:08] God back again so all that Luther left
[1:33:12] off CU Luther believe he was justified
[1:33:14] but he was still drinking beer and
[1:33:16] smoking they wasn't Sanctified they were
[1:33:18] saved because the word for that time was
[1:33:20] justification then Wesley come and said
[1:33:22] you can't just be saved and smoking and
[1:33:24] drinking clean up get Sanctified and
[1:33:27] Wesley brought the sanctification
[1:33:28] message and they went on further isn't
[1:33:30] that right so in every age had loose end
[1:33:33] had things that was not clean and clear
[1:33:35] after they were Sanctified like a wash
[1:33:36] glass here come to Pentecostals God
[1:33:39] poured the spirit and then they feel
[1:33:40] they speak in tongues and so on that's
[1:33:42] as far as they go set of baby stuff and
[1:33:44] they play with gifts and so on and here
[1:33:45] comes a prophet to bring the word now
[1:33:47] because the word comes to Prophet the
[1:33:49] word don't come to a pope the word
[1:33:50] doesn't come to a church the word
[1:33:52] doesn't come to denomination the word of
[1:33:53] the Lord came unto Noah the word of the
[1:33:54] Lord came unto Moses the word of the
[1:33:56] Lord came unto Isaiah right the word of
[1:33:57] the Lord came unto William Mar and Bram
[1:33:59] a 20th century Prophet according to
[1:34:01] Malachi 4 behold I send you Elijah the
[1:34:04] prophet isn't that right so the word
[1:34:07] came to a prophet to the prophet brought
[1:34:08] the word the full word hallelujah so
[1:34:12] that word could become a seed
[1:34:18] again so the first part of our ministry
[1:34:20] was T BL
[1:34:25] right are you with me the first part of
[1:34:28] his ministry was tying up six seals of
[1:34:31] loose ends just going back and dealing
[1:34:34] with Genesis serp and seed and all
[1:34:36] different stuff he had to clean that up
[1:34:39] and then he had a message for the
[1:34:41] bride which are seven tenders that will
[1:34:44] gather the bride would show the bride
[1:34:46] how to Bear would give the bride Faith
[1:34:48] would UT to the bride would give the be
[1:34:50] bride Revival in other words he had a
[1:34:52] special message for the bride amen not
[1:34:54] not wasn't his message because the Lord
[1:34:56] himself is send with a shout so the Lord
[1:34:58] himself which was the husband the
[1:35:00] revealed word came for his wife God has
[1:35:03] sent somebody he sent Malachi for to
[1:35:05] call out a bride but he descended with
[1:35:07] the message himself do do you Recon when
[1:35:10] they get a when they get a wedding
[1:35:11] invitation is a message Hallelujah is a
[1:35:14] is a piece of cardboard or or paper or
[1:35:16] whatever inviting inviting you to a
[1:35:18] wedding it's written well that's what
[1:35:20] brother was he came as a messenger to
[1:35:23] bring the invitation to the wedding
[1:35:25] supper of the Lamb Hallelujah for the
[1:35:27] bride to get a call to respond isn't
[1:35:30] that right so the seven Thunder is an
[1:35:32] invitation of life for your life to be
[1:35:35] changed God is not forcing anything
[1:35:37] about on you you could stay a church
[1:35:39] member if you want you could stay
[1:35:41] ordinary if you want or you could be
[1:35:42] like Samson when the spirit Came Upon
[1:35:48] him you hear what I said you could stay
[1:35:51] ordinary or you could be like Samson
[1:35:53] Samson was not ordinary he had Seven
[1:35:56] Locks he had seven tunders he had seven
[1:36:00] virtues he had seven Mysteries he had
[1:36:03] seven
[1:36:04] [Applause]
[1:36:08] voices you see those seven lucks was the
[1:36:13] key to his power and
[1:36:16] strength that was sealed as a mystery to
[1:36:19] Samson alone amen Samson alone held the
[1:36:22] secret that's right of the power that he
[1:36:24] had now Samson wasn't a big small
[1:36:26] muscular man like what you see on paper
[1:36:28] big HK HK muscles that will be
[1:36:30] dishonorable to God come like the man
[1:36:32] strong that why he moving this and
[1:36:33] moving this Sams was an ordinary guy but
[1:36:36] when the spirit come upon him hallu he
[1:36:39] did some extraordinary
[1:36:43] things one
[1:36:45] time they caught Samson inside and they
[1:36:47] closed the gate you know how the gates
[1:36:49] are those times big Gates
[1:36:51] Samson take off the gate with the
[1:36:55] post and carry it on a hill Samson
[1:36:58] didn't even B to even check to see the
[1:37:00] days how heavy the gate is he just take
[1:37:02] the gate out with the post and continue
[1:37:04] walking and take the gate and they can't
[1:37:06] lock Samson in Samson beating lion
[1:37:09] Samson thousand men getting beat down
[1:37:12] with Samson was just different why the
[1:37:15] spirit Came Upon him Hallelujah and
[1:37:19] activated the power inside of him Spirit
[1:37:24] he was a channel to which God could flow
[1:37:27] through when God sees Samson God said
[1:37:30] there is my spirit flowing freely or I
[1:37:33] could use him Hallelujah I could work
[1:37:36] him the devil sat down in his boardroom
[1:37:39] and said this cannot continue we can't
[1:37:42] allow this man to embarrass us Jesus get
[1:37:44] a plan amen call his agent get his spies
[1:37:48] interview the Lila in the spirit Realm
[1:37:51] and and decid to set a Honey Trap they
[1:37:53] call it for Samson Honey Trap did I
[1:37:57] looking good walking good talking good
[1:38:02] and Samson get activated with liking
[1:38:04] Thea that was the beginning of his fall
[1:38:08] but God had another plan besides the
[1:38:10] devil have a plan God was planning on
[1:38:12] top of his plan because God had a plan
[1:38:16] to put Samson in the right position to
[1:38:19] get more results that he could ever get
[1:38:22] before so while the devil is working God
[1:38:25] say moving so I will move so let's
[1:38:31] move let the battle
[1:38:34] [Applause]
[1:38:35] roll you may be se he Thea say Samson
[1:38:39] where's your secret Sam to play games
[1:38:41] with Thea if youe a cord I lose my
[1:38:43] strength tie the cord he break it he
[1:38:46] laughing it's a joke for him because
[1:38:48] even though he lying the power still
[1:38:51] they with him because God is say if you
[1:38:53] lie there'll be no power God said don't
[1:38:55] cut the hael and the power will be with
[1:38:57] you don't break the secret keep it
[1:38:59] silent don't let the devil know nothing
[1:39:01] about
[1:39:04] itall Samson had to do other little
[1:39:06] games and so on you know and Thea wear
[1:39:09] him down and that devil does you know we
[1:39:11] you
[1:39:14] down until Samson decided to give away
[1:39:16] the secret he break that seal of Silence
[1:39:21] over his life of the secret of his power
[1:39:25] give it to theila and theila now fully
[1:39:28] anointed get the man to cut off his
[1:39:29] locks and Samson wake up as if he going
[1:39:33] to wake up with power and only recognize
[1:39:35] the power was not there amen he was
[1:39:39] ordinary and I hope you understand this
[1:39:41] you Christians sitting here without
[1:39:43] God's grace and presence and power you
[1:39:48] are
[1:39:49] ordinary amen
[1:39:53] so really come with a grateful heart
[1:39:57] have a graceful Heart A Grateful heart a
[1:40:01] thankful heart you may not be where you
[1:40:03] want to be now but be
[1:40:05] grateful don't act arrogant and rude as
[1:40:08] if God owe you
[1:40:12] [Music]
[1:40:13] something so know the story the bind
[1:40:17] Samson dig out his eyes s is not blind
[1:40:21] and God watching Samson has some years
[1:40:23] to go through his stuff Samson is
[1:40:25] grinding but God have a plan that's
[1:40:28] right and afterwards they want
[1:40:30] entertainment and said Bing on
[1:40:31] Samson my you see where you are doesn't
[1:40:35] mean where you going to
[1:40:36] be that that way devil don't understand
[1:40:39] and you have to understand your present
[1:40:41] condition doesn't mean that next 2 years
[1:40:43] or next 6 months you will be still be in
[1:40:45] that condition so even though Samson was
[1:40:47] bong let's say for 5 years blind weak
[1:40:51] that time the secret Delux going
[1:40:53] back I will
[1:40:56] restore say the lord the devil could cut
[1:40:59] some but not all he can't go down in The
[1:41:02] Roots because the roots Gone Too Deep
[1:41:03] Hallelujah you see the devil only came
[1:41:05] in the beginning but you were before the
[1:41:08] beginning the devil could only stop when
[1:41:11] he digging he going dig up to in the
[1:41:13] beginning but once he reached in the
[1:41:16] beginning he can't go beyond that but
[1:41:17] but we could go before there was a
[1:41:19] beginning we before the foundation of
[1:41:21] the world we could we have all Roots got
[1:41:24] deeper than in the beginning so the
[1:41:27] devil can only cut off up there in the
[1:41:29] beginning but Samson had deeper Roots
[1:41:31] than that so those roots brought back
[1:41:33] the heal it brought back the strength it
[1:41:37] brought back the word it brought back
[1:41:39] the seed but there was no visible
[1:41:42] evidence of power they thought was the
[1:41:44] same weak man that he was 5 years ago
[1:41:47] they thought he was the same weak man
[1:41:49] that he was 7 8 10 years ago but this
[1:41:52] time what was restored the word was
[1:41:54] restored he was waiting for the watering
[1:41:57] Spirit of the Holy Ghost but more than
[1:42:00] that he was waiting to be positionally

[1:43:02] he was concerned that he could bring
[1:43:04] back glory to God once more once more
[1:43:10] once more he had failed but he wanted to
[1:43:14] bring Glory back to God he fell but he
[1:43:18] wanted to bring Glory back to God it
[1:43:21] wasn't about Samson it was about God it

[1:49:22] crown and put on your head and say I am
[1:49:24] King that is dictatorship that when you
[1:49:27] take Crown in God's program you have to
[1:49:30] be anointed to be king Hallelujah you

[1:49:37] you appoint yourself leader we go ahead

[1:49:45] waiting for Spirit witness the spirit is
[1:49:47] what Witnesses the spirit not the is the
[1:49:50] spirit so you can't look at height you
[1:49:53] can't look at teachings and preachings
[1:49:55] and gift and talent he's looking for
[1:49:57] heart so this man passed that man passed
[1:50:00] all of them pass Samuel say but I ain't
[1:50:03] get no witness do you have any more Sons
[1:50:06] because God can't lie if God tell me

[2:09:22] get healed is in the house of
[2:09:24] God and if there's any place to fall
