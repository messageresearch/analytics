reports lord of that light over the the azusa strip revival father where the neighbors and people were called for the fire services because they're seeing fire on the roof of the building the fire of

privilege to come into the presence of god i don't know how you feel when you come and you feel the atmosphere and the anointing and to think when adam fell and he fell they would drive him out the garden of eden think about being driven out of presence presence you're living in it communion in it all of a sudden you're walking out and you're looking back and you're walking out of presence not only walking out of prisons but angels with swords guarding any way possible for you to get back into presence and the prophet taught us god is setting angels no to drive you back into the presence the object of the service is not just a talk word it's to bring you into presence because in in the presence is life is the presence is power in his presence is healing is his presence is deliverance we wasting time if we cannot come into presence oh glory to god amen amen so this morning you want to go into the word i was so thrilled by the anointing and atmosphere of the song service and you know a body gets started with a tremendous prayer meeting on friday we won't have another one and we won't have another one and we want to stream that next one next friday for those who can't make it out but we want as many of you to come out to come out and join us in that time of prayer and seeking the lord on friday so this morning we want to turn our bibles to mark chapter five it's in john chapter one and acts chapter one for scripture reading this morning reading mark 5 reading from verse 25 on a certain woman which had an issue of blood 12 years had suffered many things of many physicians spend all that she had and was nothing bettered but rather grew with and when she had heard of jesus came in the press behind and touched his garment for she said if i may touch but his clothes i shall be whole and straightway the function of her blood was dried up and she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague and jesus immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him turned him about in the press and said who touched my clothes and his disciples said unto him thousands the multitude thronging thee and says thou who touched me and he looked around about to see her that had done this thing and the woman fearing and trembling knowing what was done in her came and fell down before him and told him all the truth he said unto her daughter thy faith had made the whole go in peace and behold of thy plague saint john 1 reading from verse 11 to 14. he came unto his own and his own receive him not but as many as received him to them gave you power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of flesh nor of the will of man but of god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth and our last scripture one verse was acts 1 8 familiar scripture and you shall receive power after the holy ghost has come upon you and he shall be witnesses unto me both in jerusalem and in all judea and in samaria and to the uttermost part of the earth may god bless his word you may be seated praise the name of the lord oh blessed be the name of the lord as we said on wednesday night uh in going forward once i'm preaching i'll be making reference to azusa street and some pointers of azusa street revival a revival that took place in 1906 where the holy spirit god came down in a powerful way and what i didn't even realize that the brother seymour he prophesied that there was going to be another revival it will be about a hundred years from now because that revival just died out and then god sent a prophet messenger because he needed that atmosphere for the prophet messenger to come into it so 1906 by 1946 rival dead gone the angel of the lord appeared unto branham and gave him a message to bring to a gentile bride that is how you got called out because the pentecostal was like shock and brother branham brought the word which was the seed so he we have a message bought by a 20th century prophet and the message itself is dusty at the lord the message itself is not word only the message itself is not teaching only it's not information only on books only that's what we have had for 40 50 years the message is a little more than that my title tonight is ye shall be witnesses unto me that is jesus words to his disciples ye shall be witnesses unto me and i have an inspiration virtue power for service virtue a witness is to see something experience something to be there a person who is present so you can't be it cannot be a heresy you have to be here to be a genuine witness and jesus he's told disciples you shall receive power after the holy ghost has come upon you and you shall be witnesses unto me not your own witness your witness in christ hallelujah you are going to represent christ you are going to see christ and i realize this is the problem with many people today the burden is not christ it's a selfish thing it's about you it's about your stories about how you feel and how you think it's not about the lord but you are promised to become a true witness a witness unto jesus and that is why when peter healed a man he said you think by my power this man is made whole but in the name of jesus it's not me it's jesus so peter was bearing witness of jesus and as jesus reflect god you shall reflect christ as jesus reflect and reveal god you're going to reveal jesus christ because christ is the mystery of god revealed hallelujah is going to be christ in you amen praise the name of the lord praise god so pride and selfishness and i was given a i think it was in the prayer meeting that seymour who started this revival as loser street revival was a a negro man and he had uh he was half blind so a one-eyed man and god called him the first church he went to was a kind of radical church the church had black and white's worship and in those times that segregation white's here blacks here so he went to church that didn't believe in that was a white pastor but he did not believe in segregation so therefore he was there for a while he went to another church and this church now preaching and teaching the baptism of the holy ghost but that preacher white preacher he believed in segregation so he believed that black and white not supposed to be together but seymour was a humble man and he wanted to hear what to be what is being taught about the baptism holy ghost so he was contented to be sitting outside the church separated from the congregation to listen from outside what the man was teaching hallelujah glory to god and he learned something from the both sides one side was preaching unity when he went back to them they don't believe in the baptismal all heroes but they believe in unity this side don't believe in unity but the teaching is baptized so he was able to draw from both sides and come down the middle with unity and power of the baptism of the holy ghost to activate a revival that we still feel in the effects of oh glory to god because man didn't start that revival as god started revival hallelujah the fire of the holy ghost was so hot over the roof people were seeing fire they were calling fire services to oak the fire that was on top of that building oh glory to god but it wasn't a natural fire it was a holy ghost fire and i am believing that same holy ghost that same fire but come down among you oh hang over the building hang over you or give the lord a shout glory to god [Applause] as long as we remain separate and selfish the spirit cannot come hallelujah what would happen if we come to a unity of defeat hallelujah what would happen if the walls of partition is broken down and people begin to see themselves as brethren sons of god sons of the kingdom a kingdom that cannot be moved hallelujah what a power it's going to be amen glory to god but the branham was talking about what we need today is some fire in the boiler you know them long time training used to move by steam to get steam you had a hot deal water not warm water warm water don't produce steam it has to be boiling water boiling hot water and then the steam come out to produce a power to get that engine moving and the church and going nowhere with lukewarm water oh come on now come on now things have to get hot in here things things have to get hot in your life if you want things to move it has that's why i said rather hot on your coal because if you're cold you're dead lukewarm and moving no train but if you're hurt we can get steam so i say this morning let's raise the temperature of praise let's raise the temperature of prayer let's raise the temperature of worship and see what god's going to do inside of here oh glory hallelujah there's a testimony and i i know but abraham said mr lim will be restored but i didn't realize that that was done in the exercise revival one man in a factory got his arm cut off everybody knew it went to the azure street and his arm grew back in seconds his hand grew back up when he went back to the factory everybody got baptized and including the manager of the factory this says but it's not too hard because god watch dust and bring a man out of dust don't open your eye too big he said let us make man and he brought man out of the dust that god could give you a new kidney a new pancreas a pair of new eyes [Applause] that god could dissolve cancer humor whatever sickness he is the same yesterday today and forever oh glory to god hallelujah glory to god amen hallelujah reflecting on jesus then the power struck the saints they began to speak in tongues japanese people came in by here in japanese hearing the gospel in japanese russian coming by hearing the gospel in russian a sister who never played piano before never read music before when the holy ghost come upon her she playing piano normal music normally normal warmer god know how to play broadly how to go on the dividing god could speak any language god knows what you have needed [Applause] hallelujah do you want to see that same power [Applause] do you want to see that same anointing we have a promise you know greater than that because luther had mechanics and dynamics wesley had mechanism what about the bride we are going to have mechanics and dynamics oh glory to god [Applause] now listen i am speaking this and preaching this because i want you to be under expectation for this you may be seated seymour that colored man all he used to do is to go in a box some box behind him was not pulling some kind of box and put his head and pray they had no order of service they was just singing somebody let's sing a song and start a song and in the beginning they had no music was just singing no instrument listen to this he went to los angeles and when he was sentenced pastor church and he preached he preached a baptism of holy ghost even though he didn't have it yet next day he meets a chain on the church door then lock him out because they say they don't believe that they believe when they're sanctified they have it so he was rejected all quarters and somebody taken him on a house 312 bonney bridge street and he began to pray when you see your back against the wall when you see you are being turned on when you see you have been rejected and you say people don't like you and people don't want you fall back let your default position be prayer when when you don't understand what is happening things seem to be going wrong don't curse don't fuss don't get angry pray [Applause] trouble in your home pray this not working out pray show god that you could believe him he began to pray and the people in the house they begin to pray neighbors come along and they start to pray next where's a hundred people outside the house praying nobody are preaching they're praying no you know you can sing too much you could talk too much you could fellowship too much but you can't pray enough i will say it again you can sing too much you can text too much you can facebook too much but you cannot pray enough you cannot pray too much [Applause] so much people on the balcony the balcony broke down and that is when they know that i find that place and that is where they find the place in azusa street hallelujah a stable abandoned it was formerly a church they created and put some planks and that's where they started ourselves the anointing was so powerful people coming off the train blocks away was feeling the power of god [Music] people were falling on the street not by some mystery sermon but by the power of god i want you to be aware there is something called the power of god if you never taste it you're going to taste it if you never experience it you should want to experience it if you don't know it you should want to know it there is something called the power of god this is not doctrine this is power hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so all of them who want to fight over doctrine they are liars because the power short the manifestation is the interpretation show me god let the gordon answer by fire hallelujah go with us god so i tell brethren don't let doctrine hinder some getting fellowship hallelujah as long as two fellows in the ship we could have fellowship oh glory to god hallelujah so this brother brother seymour he saw in the word where the gifts are promised he saw in the word where this is what is to come now and he created the atmosphere he was praying for five hours every day for two and a half years hallelujah so he had a burden in his spirit in his heart and his mind to see a reality of god he was a half blind guy i don't think he was that handsome that anybody would be attracted much to him god has set up things a certain way but he had the burden of god to pray oh glory to god hallelujah and you talk about a revival hearing revival man lost foot man with god foot come on the scene foot going back out hallelujah praise god unfortunately but you know whole foot going back out paul hand going knuckle no wonder abraham says missing limbs gonna be restored because we're going back to our power [Applause] no wonder why but abraham said usc power yet and let me tell you bride of christ ufc power yet power is coming anointing is coming sons of god going to speak the word he said it's going to create itself just like that did you hear that just like that [Applause] mine i don't know what we need today in the church to boil to boil not to warm the hottest boiling thing there is to boil sin out of your life is love [Applause] i ain't talking about like i ain't talking about good it's good thing the competition a good thing i'm not i'm not like you know i mean you know it's a good thing you know when you go to church you feel good no we're not about that they're not love love make you stand up love make you stand for christ love make you dress decently if you're a woman love make you act like a christian if you're a man love make you act like a christian if you're a woman love does that because you love the lord and you don't want to bring shame to his name how many [Applause] you don't want to bring shame to his name and if you can't love one another how you will love god love is the greatest boiling thing and if you can love one another you're loving god and you're praying praying praying but you hate this one and you hate this one and you can't stand this one and your blood can't take this one and you're not serious happening with this one what kind of love is that bogus bogus you can't buy nothing without love that like a bogus dollar that's bogus money hallelujah the love we're talking about that are stopped that has stopped cancer that will stop cancer that love will heal the sickness amen hallelujah glory to god watch if you can't love one another are you going to love god you can't shake this one hand you're cashing this one hand you can't talk to this one you're gonna fight that you go there again no fight go see a stinking sinner and love him [Applause] and you and you're gonna fight with somebody in church and for god so loved the world he gave his only begotten son but whoever how are you going to love god who you haven't seen love hides a multitude of sin [Applause] get in love with god then you would love one another so if you can't want to love with lana something wrong with your love for god because they love god god forgive me of my sins hope i can hold you up with yours if god forgives me you mean i can forgive you die right jesus said pray forgive them as we forgive those if you don't forgive them your sin is on you and faith for your healing faith for your deliverance is based on forgiveness if you can't forgive you are messed up if you can't drop your nonsense you are messed up have to forgive me oh glory hallelujah get in love with god then you will love one another then you would love the church oh yeah how are your church christian and it's all your church and them and then who is them do you say upon this rocky ability or church in the bible you see i will build my church and the gates you have to love his church his church consists of his people oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah we are the children of the kingdom we are family we are one we're glory to oh give them us god praises [Applause] get in love with god then you would love one another then you would love the church then you would love the cause then you would love everything that is godly and you will keep away from the things of the world because you love the lord oh glory to god hallelujah oh glory to god [Applause] david he loved god he loved god so much that god said he's a man after my own heart [Applause] [Music] [Applause] and he loved god because god didn't put him on each one you know he loved god a long time this is small you love god my name is sheep he loves god seeing more animals you love god that's just who he is hallelujah you just love god you have to be a lover of the lord you love to pray you love to sing you love coming to church you love the atmosphere you love these saints [Applause] 18 and david behave himself wisely in all his ways and the lord was with him wherefore when saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely he was afraid of him [Music] [Applause] there was no fool they were already anointed david i want you to be king saul only holding a temporary position on that seat david knows only a matter of time power power pride is only a matter of time but you shall receive power after the holy ghost [Applause] wherefore when saul saw that he gave himself very wisely he was afraid of him but all israel and judah love david because he went out and came in before him before them oh praise god bless may god bless his word oh hallelujah hallelujah so let's continue says from the rising sun no matter how much your legends claim how well you got your church set how much education you got how much the bible until that wave sheath until the holy spirit comes upon that person to quicken the word the gasoline represents the word it's the truth but without the spirit it won't move we have put too much stress on the mechanics and nothing on the dynamic it needs the dynamic power of god the resurrection power of jesus christ upon the church to manifest and bring to pass that is gasoline so regardless how people are taught how much mysteries they are taught how much revelations they are taught it needs the fire it needs the power to know if it is gasoline because if it is water you scratch your match and drop at the side of the batch ocean [Music] it may be in a gasoline can but that don't mean it's gasoline they can outside my gasoline put in tape and printing gasoline stickers don't make it gasoline [Applause] playing books and playing caves don't make it gasoline no you have to have real gasoline on the inside [Applause] if that is really that so to prove his gasoline you haven't liked it much and when you drop it if it's gasoline boom you'll hear explosion you're gonna see fire if it's gasoline if it's not gasoline people just sit and steal oh going to go but if it's gasoline upon you and that light hit you you have to do something at least your hand will go up at least your head my shake a little bit so [Applause] even even if you're stiff neck your whole body might lose so but something's gonna to move hallelujah listen one time there was burying a dead man and he had some robbers and bandits coming and elijah grave was there and they dropped the dead man and the might come back to life on because it was quickening power not dead power that was gasoline that was gasoline oh glory of god that was gasoline gasoline mega man come back to life the quickman power that's what you are here for tonight to receive quicken power or glory to god we let our scripture he came onto his own and he didn't receive him not they rejected him but as many as we received him as many you know where i'm going right as many i've received him to them to them to those people see their power power power power to become the sons of god [Applause] not to become backslidden not to be defeated but to be sons of god [Applause] hallelujah have you received him have you received the word then power is promised the spirit is promised to you who have received christ the word he let you have received the word first oh glory to god hallelujah so watch so this church is emphasizing the dynamics if anybody asks you what are we doing so we emphasizing dynamics tell them we have 50 years of mechanics and we think we we ready now for dynamics tell them the rims polish the car looking good tell them they have a fresh paying job but the engine we wanted started okay and only god could do that [Applause] [Applause] [Music] gonna put me here in this position to be like cause i'm dumb dumb man dumb dog in israel no we're not fools no we not tower god gave us vision and purpose god gave us expectation what to expect for jesus was no fool he was the messiah he know them guys as flesh and blood that many humans are sacrament after he died he tell them he was going to die he'd do miracles with them and when he died them fellas went back fishing normal normal themselves bring back the normal life normal normal he knew them because you are human and they are human but they are called to a higher order [Applause] become among them i say peace be unto you sharon i have any meat hallelujah mine peter say fish all night and caught nothing yes because you owe to the will of god you have none of the catch you have no blessing to get when you're doing your own thing you have no blessing to get you're fishing whole night and getting nothing but look at the grace of god come casting it to the right side when he cast his neck is an endless fish because he come in obedience to instructions by the word and that is why many people don't want real pastors because they don't want to subject themselves to obedience to instructions guidance and the word and i understand that oh glory to god hallelujah all scripture is given by inspiration and it's a doctrine for instruction for guidance gotta put a minister here for idol they say other pastor pastor for what the pastor can rebuke instruct bring guidance if you don't like it you never exit don't come here and fight me you know because you're gonna lose let me say it again don't come here and try to fight me because you're going to lose i'm anointed and i am commissioned and i am called to do what i am doing [Applause] i'm going to be seated 40 days 40 nights goliath making his most goliath no fully well nobody is coming to fight him if somebody will come find him the first week somebody might have come forward 40 days so god goliath just exercised in his rights to be goliath send me a man to fight me nobody coming to fight him he knows that they were all kind of chicken and big turkeys laid the only feeding gallery as long as as they have goliath they fine and when that devil has some big d money and you backing down he's fine he's fine he just fine cocolat is is the philistine champion but time was running out [Applause] and david almost missed it you know because your brother was was was just in them and roughing him up brethren he owned bedroom his own his own people roughing him up and when he was brought to go go live step forward bad timing wrong timing outer timer [Applause] hallelujah glory hallelujah hi hallelujah time has run out on your laziness on your strengthfulness on your bad behavior on your own christian manners turn on and out you are going to be delivered you are going to be free time running out on your sinful behavior although we have to go be serving notice oh glory to god there's going to be a powerful church a glorious church without spot widow's wrinkle or glory to god i believe that [Applause] until that church becomes both dynamics and mechanics and the spirit of god that moved him to jesus to do the things that he did if he hit on 16 cylinders so will the bride for he said in sin john 14 12 he that believeth on me the works that i do shall do also i will give him a charge of my dynamics in his mechanics that is the interpretation of that scripture [Applause] let me read it again die not a text to exhort on here [Music] means this and me means this and works means this and the greek means the works in greek mean this this is not that exposition on the text of saint john 14 12. this is not that you know this is the same works that speaks for itself that don't need no interpretation that means a manifestation that don't mean don't come to interpret that [Applause] yeah like you know the kind of works like you know maybe might be possible that it might work out something similar he said the same the word say means same [Applause] you don't need to go to the dictionary to explain what same is [Applause] [Applause] somebody somebody gets 2000 dollars pay and the man want wonder gave one five and everybody got two thousand dollars they say where's that you should play five hundred dollars you could you could count you you count it it's fine short no you don't take that and say well you know he gave me 500 sure no you want to know what happened with somebody packet because you see two thousand supposed to be out here wanna check it is one thousand fights so i come back from 500 because it's the same thing you can't shoot me it's the same thing and whatever peter had whatever paul had whatever james had whatever the only church had i wanted don't short me same thing same signs same wonders same miracles [Applause] all glory of god same sign same wonders say miracles humanly seated all in prison at midnight yes what are they singing nice time when manners cry what do we hear oh god i'm your servant i pray for god tell me jayla since i'm a prayer christian if you are feeling depressed let the illness lay hand on the piece of paper paul was an atmosphere paul's had to sing and when he sing then angels say you hear that [Applause] heaven every every saturday you hear that the man in prison it is midnight whenever he's supposed to be sleeping he knows how to sing he said party time for heaven worship time for heaven glory time for heaven and when you start to sing angels are to come down open prison door your prison doors going to begin to open up when you decide to praise sing worship give god glory don't wait for your deliverance praise them before your deliverance praise them now worship him now you are creating an atmosphere all glory to god hallelujah thank you lord so you said it's in john 14 12. he doesn't believe it on me the works that i do shall do also i'll give him a charge of my dynamics in his mechanics that the world will not be able to withstand it [Applause] jesus even say greater works than these shall you do that's the easter message the mechanics and dynamics together the mechanics without dynamics no good nightmares with all the mechanics no good it has to come together you can scream and shout and jump up and down all you want and deny this word no good you're just cranking around the pistons it got to have a spark the fire but there's no gasoline so the mechanics put gasoline in your bottle put gasoline in your system he said the secret is the word or the gasoline is in the right hallelujah here come the dynamics which is the spark which is the fire which is the power to come upon your gasoline over the weed of god and the sun says when the spirit of the lord comes upon my heart i will sing like day [Applause] hallelujah listen friends you may be seated when the spirit came upon samson bomb says something

what do you mean she said what army what what army [Applause] and this bride this bride [Applause] let me see it good the battle that started in heaven we're finishing up on earth the battle that started in heaven we're going to finish it on 8th what satan sat in eden we will correct it god leave the right for the last day to prove to satan we are not like eve this bride is anointed this bride is appointed this bride is predestinated nobody could stop this black this bible will not be manhandled paul will take the man handle off of that right the bride will go free but we give the lord some praises oh my my mind hallelujah from revelation book of symbols brahm say god is waiting and trying and pressing to get the mystery of god revealed to his church that is what holding back the coming of christ now and the great millennium is this great supernatural power that really lays dormant in the church here he is saying the mysteries have to reveal for what for what's the purpose to say we have mysteries other jesus don't have as much mysteries as us we have plenty mysteries tons of it no that's not the purpose no is to get activated this great supernatural power that's why what about him says the mission of the seven thunders he said is this the mystery that will bring back a power into the church will we leap and run over walls not miss you to talk and say well we talk i'm making a mistake no no no is this the mystery they're going to bring back come on shout out power bring back our power into the church power to come into the church [Applause] so after the mysteries we have to see that mystery connecting to power not power to reveal more mysteries so help me guard people stuck in some time warp mystery world it's a mystery oh they're still warped up in mechanics it's a mystery and they don't want to leave the channel because we see when jesus came he meet these crime pharisees with their mysteries of the old testament and and they had long hearts tall hearts long beards nice gongs no works no signs no wonders no miracles no nothing so when jesus come and jesus see them just blast them you see you bite yourself cuts he saw the looking clean old sound like dead men bones on the inside [Music] he busted them and started manifesting what they hated him because he was showing them up they say we are moses children our fathers eat man in the wilderness he said everyone dead you say moses what i am moses on my day and so forth he was trying to view who he was the people who was scripture in the word rejected him and those sinners like peter fisherman gosmod matthew material guys tax collector these are the guys that received jesus because their name was in that book you can't be a christian really unless god ordained you to be that's why you in church this morning considered a privilege and an honor to get the opportunity to hear this word [Music] so christ he's not out of speaking distance some of you are backslid and done that which is wrong you have lost that joy your water is dried up my lord he is still in speaking distance of you he follows you you're sad you're done you're depressed but he's following you he follows you he knows every move you make and everything you do he is longing to hear you call him on the scene of course satan's job is to make sure your mouth get tight and your clothes when the birds get wounded they're flying away to ease the wind pressure on the bridge that is wounded they fly in a constellation a certain kind of a way certain job is to get you aside from the consolation of the group of the flying birds and when it catch you on your side where you have no real guidance and leadership and so on beat you in the corner there and you find yourself suffering all alone it doesn't have to be that way that is why you're among the people that's why in a group where you can get the help and the support and the encouragement and the nurturing and strengthening your soul can be fed where you could be edified or you can be inspired it's more than just hearing words there's a community that is here there's a family that is here there's a blood flow in your veins is the same blood is the blood of jesus hallelujah that brings life give us an opportunity to say you're my brother you're my sister i'm praying for you hallelujah your tears is my tears your pain is my pain when you suffer i am suffering hallelujah i don't have a point to prove that i am better than you the blood is for all of us the same blood for me it's the same blood for you i love you i care for you i am there with you i want to be have your back he's longing to hear you call on him on the scene and this great pentecostal move today god is waiting for you to call him on the scene you are not out of speaking distance with him though you have done wrong sinned turn our backs on him done things we ought not to do yet he is with us christ said he is we will be with us isn't it strange that god wants the people to have a patent to it when jesus looked upon the harvest he said the harvest is right the laborers are few you pray the lord of the harvest look the vision we talk about brother branham 12 year old girl she wants to die that very day the lord tap the prophet and tell him pray for her that that doesn't happen amen so god couldn't stop it because that was destiny that was what was supposed to happen but if a prophet prayed if somebody prayed you could flip it so i i could now see how prophecies could fail because there could be a prophecy against your life you could have one more week to live but god because our prayer god flipped that over and cancel that assignment [Music] whatever assignment on your life prayer to come and cancel that prayer i could change the mind of god or go away to god if you need a cancer in this morning you can have it [Applause] you don't even know the forces of taxes and evil that come in your way and the traps and sneers that sit and set up and you don't even know the reinforcement that god about to put on you because this coming week going to be a a challenging week and god given special unction and inspiration that you could face your week this coming week don't come here and act wiki wikiwiki come here and get strength i'll not not put peeling potatoes in the background but going on the battlefield hollywood hallelujah isn't it strange that god wants the people to have patented when jesus looked upon the house he said harvest is right the laborers are few you pray the lord of the harvest that was him you pray to me that i will send laborers into my harvest it is some part you have to do this thing about prayer is not just saying prayers it's to connect to praying in such a way that you have a prayer life a prayer life is different from prayers or saying prayers let me say it again our prayer life is different from saying prayers our prayer life is a life of prayer you don't eat breakfast once a week so how are you praying once a week all right you're living with breakfast lunch and dinner [Music] you never ease up on your breakfast you hit hard on your lunch that's your makeup for the breakfast that's your name and the lunch is like you crush them at the dinner you hit them real hard so what i'm saying is this if the muslim could pray three times a day or four times a day you're a christian how many times you prayed and if you miss it in the morning you had a crush during the day whether you have to go in the work bathroom where to walk like you're talking to your cell phone and you're praying man [Applause] you'll be seated it should be easy to pray no one is treating them because [Applause] glory hallelujah oh god bring my fellow jesus isaac i've reflect this script this should be the greatest time i pray for the believers no shame at all everybody talking talking they had a string yeah they're talking you're talking you talking to it's who you talk come on come on now come around this will be the greatest prayer time greatness [Applause] so you don't have to wait until it come home and you bought your knees and your body lord god darwin worthy and ho and thee and thou and do and whatnot you don't have to go through all that drama you don't have to go all day hallelujah oh glory to god you could talk if you have listen if you have have fun i want to drive to your work or get to work you could talk that's half an hour put in you can measure it you know because don't like putting half what i wanted here but hallelujah praise god praise god maybe maybe you could start like seymour and pray in the room and then somebody else had to hear you praying and they're praying too oh glory to god hallelujah but we want a prayer team we want our our prayer life we want to be steeped in prayer i want to be a church of prayer my father's house [Applause] my father's house shall be a household say it say it again house of prayer [Applause] they came where they were so insincere they would send people to offer blam for them for their sins take that off of a jehovah take that no sincerity not going to church no sincerity communion service no sincerity hallelujah the minister there doing all kind of wrong things nobody's saying nothing nobody repented no sincerity and god says i hate your feasts i hate your new moon i hate your diss your sabbath and you recognize it because there's no sincerity because to really offer sacrifice you're supposed to lay hands upon the lamb and that land represented you that is supposed to die you're resting your hands on the lamb before he died so you know it alive so when the priest cut the neck of the lamb and the blood start to spit out and you'll feel the life leaving the lamb you know that's supposed to be you you get identified blood is on you you know that's supposed to be you you supposed to die but the lamb is in your stead the lamb taken your place giving you an opportunity to be free it was something that was sacred it was something that was solemn it was something that was ordained by jehovah that you the believer had to lay your hands you have to touch it oh glory to god hallelujah all glory to god and be identified with it you have to touch it hallelujah people talk to service they're not drinking hallelujah they're not buffets at home choose where you want and you're not wanting i'm not drinking today you're feeling like a drink today there's not that you know you have to eat the whole scroll this is the word this is the spirit that woman who read about that woman in the blood issue she spent all her money her money ran out and sometime when your money ran out yeah well wait even though pressure that pressure has been on desperation and people owe that money to do some desperate things you know something's turned to rubbers and all right because they want money bad yes all kinds of things do but this woman she knows she has no money to go to the doctor doctor ripping off a long time yeah because he don't have no cure he's just taking some money but she heard about jesus you have to hear hallelujah she ain't hear about jesus just explaining mysteries and talking she hear about our god that healing is sick reasonably dead you see your body good and you're fine and healthy you could hear plenty mysteries because you don't have no needs but you see when that woman had a need a bloody history you can't teach me about mystery you know trumpets and violence woes woman and his son and this missionary mystery you know what you want is a healing then talk mysteries is a hidden healing's what you want so she told herself because nobody was telling her so she told herself and when nobody telling you you better tell yourself the right thing she told herself if i to touch the helm of his garment how we made whole what are you telling yourself this morning oh we talk about revival we talk about azusa we talk about the power that is promised that is prophesied william branham is not here but the power is here god never take the power it was reserved but here take it [Applause] you may receive oh i love him i just thank god god loose with power i thank god he has character to connect with power because if men behave as they believe no with all power if god gave them power they must have been placed oh glory to god they wrecked the place so god ain't gonna have that he's gonna have character first because the pentecostal they failed because they didn't have character so they stumbled at the gifts they still have the gifts but god called a bride to be formed into the word image he said as many as receive him to them gave me power to become a power to be formed into the image or glory of god ruling of god and faith is a revelation but virtue is power oh glory to god you need power on top of your revelation power for service oh give the lord a shout give the lord a shout oh hallelujah many of revelation but where is the power upon the revelation oh glory to god let's continue you may be seated and the woman pressed away the card was there i like how god arranged it when you talk you talk got a statue talk let me say it again when you talk you talk go to test your talk when you talk your faith god has tested your faith so when the woman went a crowd was around jesus she had a choice go back home and say well i changed him at all when she was dead without talking that talk she has changed she should talk at all i don't talk this already to touch him with his garment i stay in until i do that no i sure the woman didn't rush and just move through the manual she listened she watched she observed men falling answer she watching people how they behaving and she recognized them fellas not even in the spirit them killing somebody walking they were going to the market and just stuck in here and jesus it wasn't intentional they get caught up in the crowd hey what are they looking at oh jesus oh holy i don't just are you talking that woman was seeing that talker you know all right she wasn't seeing an expositor you know somebody who could declare the word and unfold the word she wasn't seeing that you know she was seeing this man have what it takes to cure me she was listen she didn't come for talk you know she come for touch she said if i gonna hear him she already heard about him she don't need anymore convincing she want to get to him [Applause] and these these tall gentlemen and fine ladies that just fanning them just hearing words and gentlemen only nothing to each other yeah yeah i've just checked back that in the scroll i wonder where the scrolls said that you take a note of that take a note of that for me and some pharisees take a note of that that's what he said they must have that's what jesus said this woman looked at the push cause she pushed she sat when she recognized listen nothing they're moving among these mechanics and all these church members and all these so-called people just just listen just hanging around jesus she's at the push no listen when she's had a push heaven pushing with her two you know all them is a push pull move sister look at space there slip between them after 15 minutes she sees herself maybe 15 feet from jesus she mingled him on the crowd she watching she watched him listen she have an agenda she ain't gonna [Music] did i stand up next to jesus you can't do that so she said him so brother the last move she make is to fall down nobody didn't try i don't know she just make a spin so and just fall down and start to push ah coming through [Applause] she's on the drug now hallelujah but if adam said they're on the floor he can't forget when that colored man came up to him he said they're on the floor he said have you received the holy ghost since you believe and dale received it among our people he didn't expect to receive it or give the lord some praise listen when you really want this thing so bad you don't care if you're rolling on the floor but on please i'm saying why i'm a holy roller you know how rolly was up there he's on the floor you know that's the holy spinner holy roller is on the floor why i am a holy roller in the methodist church they were so sanctified that the holy ghost used to come upon them deacons job was to have a bucket of water to revive them because if they don't revive them they will burn the next age of the holy ghost age so every time they're about to receive it bam water upon them because the aid was sanctification but they were so sanctified that means you could live such a sanctified life that you attract the spirit of god let me say it again you can live come on now sail there you can live celery you can live a sanctify life that you attract the spirit of god oh glory to god hallelujah i'm gonna be seated when the woman touched jesus immediately she knew it's over got to explain to her sister you're sure she felt in herself it was done [Music] who touched my clothes she didn't touch him you know she touched his garment the anointing was flowing did you hear that the anointing was flowing through his garment the anointing he was anointed with god when you touch him you touch god they touch the power of god hallelujah that was a son of god revealing god with power he should have felt virtue so if that same power has to come back the people have the feel virtue power that power has to be here it is power for silvis [Applause] oh glory to god hallelujah that's what's promised to be on the ministry power for service you love him he said you pray the lord of the harvest that was him you pray to me that i will send laborers into my harvest is some part you have to do god is waiting for his church to call on him he always did it god here we go is waiting today for the people to call his servant into action and the servant can't get into action till the people praise what a mystery is in this morning this is a hidden mystery that i'm about to reveal right now hallelujah we want to break the seal over this hidden mystery this hidden mystery of prayer that the church so dead that they have stress and and think the capri i think but the clients i think but karen sent me a powerful code this morning if you could find out here oh glory hallelujah praise the name of the lord thank you jesus see you guys in the course i'm all about hallelujah praise god bear with me no it's almost an impossible thing to get people praying and fasting and calling on the lord it seems that the church has got so drowsy and lazy in these last days so pitiful i hate to come and just keep stirring and preaching and saying these things but brother sister that's the truth i just can't hold it it's the gospel and it must be preached it's got to be preached as a witness it is true and i think we have come to that spot we have come to know nia when god has given an issue for the church to call a halt a back to our prayer life not back to prayer no and you pray because we call it permitting no back to our prayer because he said no ministering a revival in the ministers this so-called man of god man and the hour and main man and only man and whatnot if they could have done it they would have done it already he said the reviver can only come by the people in their homes in their lives then you bring a revival with you from your house then you are a preacher bring your revival with you i know we get together here forget it it's a bonfire holy ghost revival i have to start with you go glory to god don't look to me i am not father somebody the catholic church reverent priests has bishops on this i am not that so don't look to me like that you are a high priest you are priests and kings oh glory to god you have a right to access god's presence you have to have your own revival there's a prayer you say lord create a revival let me be the reviver let me be the revival create a revival in me [Applause] oh glory to god so i want you to catch a burden i want you to catch a burden with no prayer a burden that god's servants have to come into action and i just read your word maybe somebody we overlook this and the servant can't get into action till the people pray amen let me read it slow and the servant can't get into action till the people pray so when you're not praying you're saying no action no action give us word brother all right who wants action i'm an action man [Applause] they have loved ones we want to see delivered it has backsliders we want to see restored it takes action to do that the people that was tied up and god tell bahram that's the house of hell freedom and he's watching the bars and he's watching himself he recommends i i i i can't i don't know the freedom all of a sudden he said house of hell [Music] [Applause] give way to the name of jesus christ and the bastard of the pope and the people started to scream they were nice people but they were in the house of hell people in the house of heaven are we coming to get you we coming to get you you're coming out you're coming out you're coming out that holds your hair you're coming out [Applause] days in the church a new time is in the church we are breaking into a new season oh glory to god dynamics to the mechanics oh hallelujah what about him said israel could not get into action with signs and wonders until they fell on their face and prayed for the deliverer god had his deliverer god had his prophet hanging in the wilderness kept in there for 40 years waiting for them to get right to pray but when they got right and start praying then god sent the liver god will do the same thing today if the people just get together if my people that is called by my name shall humble themselves and pray and turn from their wicked ways then i'm going to hear from heaven and i'm going to heal your land and the land will bring forth the corn and the wine and i will restore to you oh come on now let me preach somebody oh oh what the counterwoman the and the locals all i'm going to bring it right back i'm going to bring back your joy i'm going to bring back your life i'm going to bring back your peace i'm going to bring that a revival in your home you're going to be praying the churning will be praying people are going to be coming to act for prayer oh glory to god if i want you pray for them the anointing will be in your house the anointing will be upon your hands the anointing will be upon your lips oh give him praise give him praise give him [Applause] praise god is waiting the hour to see his church come to that position regardless of denomination regardless of creed color whatever it may be that his entire church would come to the place that they are displaying the token of the death of jesus christ you see it nice to talk doctrine talk because we can argue because we don't believe the same thing i found that quote bomb says we'll never agree on the same thing until jesus come or something nothing like that there so it's not a mata green same thing somebody like sprite somebody like cokes on my like big red and somebody like orange and somebody that drinks drinks at all like apple juice cranberry somebody don't want no juice they want hot tea i feel about a george you want coffee so there's about 10 different things we call there and people have different choices they want this they want that god gave you that right to be that peter was a daring guy lord is that you built me to come machi wasn't like that james wasn't like that and brother cannot fight but you're not like that number do you see peter but you know when united trial that peter said i don't know that man at all so be careful who you want to be like what's be careful because any whole pizza you know you can't just take walking in the water you know you gotta take him in the incredibles too and crying and i'm cussing and thinking you have to take all that too so the object is the purpose of god and the objective of god for the brandon said from genesis to revelation the whole mind behind that is for the word to become flesh [Music] that is the objective word to become flesh and the word become flesh is god he said the word was invisible until it became flesh so you carry see god until [Music] it becomes flesh then that god becomes active because he have a place a room a house he can operate in by and true oh glory to god so if god take up you as his house he could speak through you he could heal through you he can see visions through you give you dreams that's the word i report my spirit your sons and daughters shall prophesy all men shall dream dreams and you young minister here you will see visions at the lord i shall upon my admins will i pour my spirit oh glory that scripture include everybody it included all men it included young men it included sisters it included brothers it included fathers it included mothers come on now we have a revival our seven tunnel revival oh hallelujah hallelujah we are pointing revive [Applause] oh glory to god hallelujah why are

blood gear known as the spirit holy spirit the canopy of life the token oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to god how else could we challenge debt without the token with the token you could challenge debt itself because debt cannot have power over the token the token power over that the talk and i pulled over that did you hear what i said the token is a resurrected christ upon your life on display did you get that they took another message you know well let's talk about the talking play the book they talking explain it talking t-o-k-e-n i gotta spell it and it means a sign and i'm going to explain to you this token talking is a ticket i'm gonna go on the bus you understand that but after all that talk you have to get the token which is the real thing and it's not blood now is spirit d spirit not luta not wesley not pentecost but the token itself which is charity which is the love of god that that you feel brotherly kindness you could fail all them things inside of you and you're still failing it's not leaks in the building but when charity the wonderful fitness comes over seal up the virtues no more leaks no more leaks a perfect man on the earth before the election before the resurrection a perfect man o glory of god you are going to come to perfection hallelujah glory to god hallelujah saints excuse me but you ain't going nowhere tonight you know today you're

of thing and no no no no no no what i'm hearing and you call me lawrence i mean what kind of headset is that you gotta come with a crazy head [Music] [Applause] you're the army the army of the lord [Applause] all places are rules regulations demands that's why they have a white line in the middle of the road left side right side you can feel let you have the right side you are care about your left side no more you're going normally right you're looking for accident you're looking for a ticket you're looking to be arrested and imprisoned you have to buy by the rules go to rules too if my people are humble myself you have rules too joshua meditated on the word day and night to have good success if joshua said i have even let them meditate i just go in not their night night going there alone then the scripture is different you know when they go to jordan jordan watch them back to yourself do they say what you say because you're not anointed to open me you don't have the power to open me so jordan jordan is a certain anointed and power so so joshua out of sync with god's program jordan not responding jonah jordan full exams like this but when them guys obey god [Music] under the anointing of obedience because you can't just say amen you know you your spirit have to come in obedience to the word and many people come into church just to here [Music] and have a nice atmosphere and feel good but god wants your spirit to come in obedience to the word because obedience is the key and could give you the scripture faith from obedience to the whole word of god entitles you to the token [Applause] for obedience the prophet said it nicely when abraham came into the fullness of believing then the angel calmed down they gave him a fresh anointing that he going to have isaac he knew it by revelation with all the inspiration fully behind it but when the angel came down his fate is now anointed he know for sure isaac are coming too long time of life is around the corner and the bride have to get anointed to know time of life is right from the corner we are coming into our time of life this church is coming into her time of life time of life we're gonna be born again by the word and by the spirit oh glory to god born again by power oh glory let's continue my god i'm grinding to you this morning [Music] i have 41 pages and believe it or not brethren i'm on page seven so you know what going on here if i continue this trajectory we are till six this evening [Music] one day and one tuesday you know we'll be here till 6. i'm not talking about this morning wait i wouldn't easy all right let's continue brother branham he said traditionally he's the great perfect crowd your traditions are powerless they stink before me have no faith in them by the time jesus came therefore that pots and pans therefore that so many different things going in traditions and jesus said you with your traditions make the word of non-effect because the word here is supposed to have an effect upon the believers [Music] listen don't come all these miles to come and get 500 meal you're coming for the world i i can't understand people come to chicago fight with the pastor every day fighting he's saying this and he's in there you're gonna fight you want to you want to get delivered from your own fight hallelujah so traditions make the world of non-effect the word no longer had the effect upon the people because they was doing it like ritual you see and god don't like rituals because with a ritual your heart is not in it you do it because it has to be done it's like a task it's like a job you do it because you are asked you are do it because you are told but there's no love in it it's just like husband and wife if there's no love there it's just you know two people in the house it's no longer really a home it's just a house and people just talk the wife make the meal you meal they make with no love in it so the meal tastes a certain way it tastes minus love however that does taste it tastes minus love if the meat are loving it and it's only bhaji and rice or bhajjiyan bread it tastes good because they all in half and that meal was prepared with love in it so when you put love between the two slices of bread with some tomatoes in it it do like it's a burger because of love between them two slices you put some ketchup and some pepper and some garlic sauce on that ah you never believe you have no meat inside really why because they have love inside of it and this is how it's supposed to be with you in christ in your life in your work it's supposed to have love in it and when you have a love for the lord if god said no you still have love in it you put some mecha check you put some spice you put some praises you put some worship you put some thanksgiving and you say lord you know best [Applause] because that is how you show you love god by conducting yourself with joy amidst the trials he in his wisdom sends your way so you are blessed you are blessed david say my god run it over man oh glory to god you're so blessed that your cop run it over give the lord a hand up please [Applause] now let's ask ourselves the question isn't that something like today as bad as we have to see it we have got to face facts somewhere there is something wrong he said why this church ought to be a million miles up the road to where it is now jesus is waiting on his church to get ready his bride has made itself ready listen to these words now we we have got the potentials the holy spirit is here god is here the power to heal the sick the power to do all these things that christ did i have seen it demonstrated myself by the holy spirit so the potentials are here so that is why the prophet said what we see manifested temporarily will be manifested in the fullness when the press come down so he saw by manifestation the power that will be hallelujah and god demonstrated to the prophet by speaking to the storm by speaking for his wife's tumor healing creation pull over the element he demonstrated all this and say all of this package is for the bride but it's coming down the road because you expect by down the road all the character will be in us you expect down the road we will be like jesus so we won't be abusing one another and getting the devil a holiday we'll be living like christ and giving the devil a headache because lord we fight one another the devil will have no work to do he is somehow why he's somewhere under some umbrella relaxing himself by the beach people said them fellas fighting one another let him keep fighting and sometimes another text to keep on fighting send something in between give somebody a mind battle keep on fighting send some wrong data some fake news some false news and people absorb it they take it as what is that what they say and instead of verifying everything they tell somebody else and everybody going in a bad mood a bad mood and that's what we are looking at inside of here and that's why i don't burn you with no foolishness because i don't know foolishness upon you anybody could come here and preach the gospel but um what do you mean by the comments i say listen you offend it i said listen if you preach the word the people see amen and glory i say if you preach any strange thing they will look at your soul [Music] i turned out my office i said preach where you want to preach i say if a preacher is strengthening i said my people do so because the train really worked [Applause] so a man come over kind of a cool thing and do not kind of on the lucky number seven i'm doing kind of i kind of danced into the hana and doing the granting could it be whatever it is suppose it's not coming into him whatever it is i wonder if we're not wondering if nothing god sent a prophet to give us dusty of the lord [Applause] see the moon outside and the moon mean this and istan mean this and jupiter mean this and mars mean this and that means and then the church there is a daniel what mean at this they could tell the signs of the sky they could talk about stars and pluto and moon and all kind of types but they can't tell designer why the church is so dead and the bible said already a hot hole oh glory to god explain that hallelujah explain how the lamb took the book and loses themselves and the people sit down stiff explain how john didn't sit down stiff when

means to commune to fellowship i'll come and suck with you i'll fellowship with you and jesus wants fellowship that's what god's heart known for tonight he longs for it in dallas in every place in the world a breakdown of prejudice a cleanup from the pulpit all the way to basement an old-fashioned revival that will shake the nominations together and will fill the real church of the living god shake hands with holiness baptist methodist pentecostal nazarene he longs to get into our fellowship and his people to come in and commune and to bring you something good but the church and the people keeps him away because you see well that group don't believe just like i do we are reading he said what difference does that make that has nothing to do with it we are christians born again in the same family a bunch of pilgrims and here they quote like it's right here we will never see eye to eye until we see him face to face and be changed and made into his glorious own brother so stop trying to look at somebody's eye and say see like my eye because i might be seeing coke next man seeing sprite next man seeing coffee like my seeing orange like my seeing red mekman sea and orange juice so don't try we cannot look to see eye to eye we could see the purpose of god and see what the spirit is trying to accomplish what is a man's motive and objective and that's what ram says you don't judge a man by his church you judge a man by his motive and objective what he's trying to achieve and then if you see he's trying to see the writing you can work with that man because his objective is right oh yeah he may have little slips and sliders only way but he has the right objective because then there was a target the right goal so what about him let's continue he knocks on the door of every mortal that's his duty that's what he's here for no one gets passed by all of them is invited crippled lame hall blind and every church here methodist baptist pentecost another importance one is tunis and dr if you're dragged down those listen if you will drag down those little differences and come together they will empty the hospitals it will cause something to take place that headlines will come into the paper television will cast it across the world when christ come into those homes the thousands of homes it would do it he's there showing you the power of unity the power of coming together the power of having a common purpose how god going to bless that and empower that that they go empty the hospitals oh glory to god you know in the days of john where's your bias close down shut boston

coming together where all the churches with one accord one heart assemble together and forget your man mythology and cry out to god for spiritual power after all the mysteries after only teachings is it time to cry out to god for spiritual power that's all we need he's so christian bang yourselves together with one heart and one accord for god can no more send the gifts to the church while the church is separated i'm going to read it again that word reading he said god can no more send the gifts to the church while the church is separated that he can send the holy ghost unless we have one accord it comes by the holy ghost there's a prophecy there's going to be a unity of the faith god shall lie if god didn't say that in the world no manning will stop that there is going to be a unity of defect restored by malachi 4 that's going to be your unity i believe that i'm on expectation for that i am preaching for that i am living for that oh glory to god there is going to be a unity damn

the oils she had all the oils she had the meal she had to to to the preacher to the kingdom of god and when she dumped it god come along and fill the meal barrel she was gonna die a little me a little loyal but she emptied out to feed the man of god and once he emptied thought god fill as the empty god fill more you empty god fill if you want to be filled empty out sort of things out throw the trash out move things out that people have newspapers with clippings from i don't know 50 years ago 10 years ago they don't want to get rid of the equipment because the people say so that day they have bills they have receipts they have break shoes from cars three generations back that they was wondering if they have need of them old bricks they use it they're doing money car for the bricks but the bricks are still there holders you do have to say guilt like that you know you're guilty don't let me know keep it to yourself i am not saying you are that you know i'm just sharing it i've orders but don't let me know you're a horror i want you to be one that want to empty out because you know is the art of not letting go [Applause] so you've got a whole piece of anger you know it up here people have renewed the anger every year they're looking for a fight because they want so they don't want to be vexed with their husband they're looking for a fight looking to get something you're angry about when the heart gets clear and clean and and they they feeling strange because they want they want an issue there's a finer fault hoarding grudges like if like crutches is loot like gorgeous money ever you have a handful of grudges yeah you're rich and grudges instead of receiving faith you risen oats how can i forgive him for that you know okay and your fingerprint usually can't forgive her she only tell me if she cannot kiss him out give him a moat you're hoarding attitudes but if you let go and i say like spider-man every time you have an oat here is that string tied to this person your string hair stringer you tie when you're walking so when you believe hallelujah when you leave your hands among the strings around you because 10 people you have out on this side 10 people on this side here you're strung up you touch no wonder why your capri is good you're tired or you're just but when you start to drop the odds clicks clicks you're cutting the chords clicks

wow wow you have some sweet things on here but but but we're going to see you right now oh my hallelujah it's good to be in the woods i must check to see how much books how much books is inside of here that'll be quoting from is that one message there's several messages to put together to present this to you oh my so i'm going me skip quickly uh something but i'm talking about the beast and anytime the devil put up power a white horse red horse tail was god's release of power also to come back to the enemy so when god saw the first antichrist was writing with a teaching he was teaching his writing word so god sent the teaching out the word the lion of the tribe of judah which is the word made manifest by the holy spirit that is what god to compact what the devil had to offer he lose what the word made manifest by the holy spirit that was the line of judah oh praise god thank you lord jesus in this scripture hallelujah so remember he keeps his blessings and he keeps his curses every promise god keeps you have to choose which one you want his blessings by believing or his christians by perverting it if you pervert it and believe the perversion side of it you are cursed if you believe it the way he wrote it and hold on to it then you are blessed oh my hallelujah praise god brother brahm said this now he said we find out in revelation 3 there's to be three church ages in this age did you know that he said then he talked about elements three three elements justification sound vacation a holy ghost pentecost three messengers they're coming in the last time now we find out that the rain listen the holy spirit being poured out in the last days do you believe it is to be poured out upon what upon what somebody is sowing seeds to bring forth his latter day crop so the holy spirit is the fall upon what upon seeds i'll restore saith the lord what will i do i will bring her back to her original condition listen careful i will bring her back to her original doctrine i will bring her back to original word i will break every nomination to pieces i will bring her back to my word so maybe i better shut up boy stop i will bring her back and when you get away from the word you got away from god you got away from the principles you got away from the holy spirit you got it from everything the devil will give you something false but it will never be a record of it so anytime people get off the word devil dare to give them something false oh praise the name of the lord the bible is to be finished the gentile dispensation is to be finished with the church age when this anointed messenger arrives of course he will plant the seed of the entire bible plum from the serpent to the messenger of the four marine so brother branham came to plant the seed of the entire bible and the bible is in three levels the zodiac the pyramid and this physical bible so he came to plant the bible which is the pyramid inside of you and today you have a pyramid inside of you which is the seed of the entire bible the secret the word in the bride so all these mysteries all these unfolding of the word is the bible sealed inside of you the mystery of god come built from god as the word of god and that is what is taught and preached and that is what inside of you oh glory to god so listen i believe that christ has a church and the church is the field we will get into it and you have got to get the word in the field before the spirit can do anything so all these years god was getting the word into the field you are the field and the word is the conductor of the spirit so if god will lay down the plumbing and the electric wire the current car flow through it so all these years god was wiring up the church and god is about to pull along the breaker hallelujah because the inspector when you buy your house you have that inspector how's the government inspect the house if the inspector don't inspect the house the house could burn down especially now if they have a faulty electrician or a lesser general didn't get a certificate or some kind of bogus or half-washed electrician he cannot cross the wires and make it wrong so then you flick this thing so bab post bon dong hallelujah so they have an inspector to inspect the wiring oh glory to god then you get approval to get connection to the source to the power source hallelujah oh glory to god so when the inspector come down and look down and see all the wiring's in order we're ready for connection and i feel today we're ready for connection god wants to connect you to the source all glory to god my my mind i'm almost finished just back i'm going to wrap up i know you're hungry but this is food food for your soul you're going to get food for your body but this is food [Applause] all right mori then the kind of seed you have planted in your field will be the kind of crop you will reap mori is for marine or plantain rain so you call it teaching planting rain it's a rain it's the atmosphere but it's the atmosphere to put in seed all right what happened the four marine is planted the unwise version oh there's a big one this is a big one here we go it's going to be the hybrid she has the seed with all the oil with all the moisture to make it grow nice bedroom nice churches no atmosphere no oil no moisture to make it grow all they have is wood wood wood wood seeds seeds seeds they have the seed but no more atmosphere do you see that now he call that the hybrid don't you be like that the virgins are the same the difference is the oil one have oil one don't one oil ran out the other one have extra oil you don't want to be the one that all run out you want extra oil let's see if we wrap up here now now the formal word of mori means teaching in other words there will be a teaching rain and a harvest rain teach and rain 40 plus years hallelujah now we're going to have the harvest rate i am here to expect harvest rain not teaching rain harvesting oh glory to god we are looking to harvest

faith of the fathers the pentecostal part in the restoration time i will restore he is prophesying that we have to come back to the pentecostal part in the restoration time there's going to be something bigger than azusa street before jesus coming oh glory to god hallelujah i'm finished when the angel came down to abraham he said ah personal pronoun says going to visit you according to the time of life you're going to have that baby that you're waiting on then he got in her gear he said the lettering is fixing to fall you have held the seed in there long enough what this latter ain't
