[21:54] portion of scripture
[21:58] reading from the book of revelation
[22:01] chapter four thank you musicians
[22:03] thank you brother anthony for such an
[22:05] anointed song service you appreciate but
[22:07] anthony and the musicians
[22:10] how many appreciate the service last
[22:12] week you appreciate our pastor
[22:14] amen amen amen so revelation chapter
[22:18] four
[22:19] a reading from verse one
[22:22] after this i looked and behold a
[22:26] door was opened in heaven and the first
[22:29] voice which i heard was
[22:31] as it were for trumpet talking with me
[22:34] which said come up hither
[22:36] and i will show thee things which must
[22:39] be hereafter
[22:40] and immediately i was in the spirit
[22:45] and behold a throne was set in heaven
[22:47] and one sat on the throne and he that
[22:49] sat
[22:49] was to look upon like a jasper and a
[22:52] sardine stone and there was
[22:54] a rainbow round about the throne in
[22:56] sight like under an
[22:57] emerald and round about the throne with
[22:59] four and twenty seats and upon the seats
[23:02] i saw
[23:03] four and twenty elders sitting clothed
[23:06] in wide raiment and they had on their
[23:08] heads crowns of gold
[23:11] and out of the throne proceeded
[23:13] lightnings and thunderings and voices
[23:15] and
[23:16] there were seven lamps of fire burning
[23:18] before the throne which
[23:20] are the seven spirits of god
[23:23] and before the throne there was a sea of
[23:25] glass
[23:26] like unto crystal and in the midst of
[23:28] the throne and round about the throne
[23:30] were
[23:31] four beasts full of eyes before and
[23:33] behind
[23:35] and the first beast was like a lion and
[23:37] the second beast like a calf and the
[23:39] third beast had a face as a man and the
[23:42] fourth beast was
[23:43] like a flying eagle and the four beasts
[23:45] had each of them six wings about him and
[23:48] they were full of eyes within and the
[23:50] rest not day and night
[23:51] saying holy holy holy lord god almighty
[23:55] which was
[23:56] and is and is to come and when those
[23:58] peace give glory and honor and thanks to
[24:01] him that sat on the throne
[24:02] which liveth forever and ever the four
[24:05] and twenty elders fall down before him
[24:08] that sat on the throne and
[24:09] worship him that liveth forever and ever
[24:11] and cast their crowns
[24:13] before the throne saying thou art worthy
[24:15] o lord to receive glory
[24:17] and honor and power for thou hast
[24:20] created all things and for thy pleasure
[24:22] they are and were created can we bow our
[24:25] heads for word of prayer
[24:27] our gracious heavenly father we are so
[24:29] humble this morning to be in your
[24:30] presence father lord many of us had
[24:33] lord all kinds of a week this week lord
[24:36] with ups and downs and
[24:37] trials and testings and strains and
[24:40] stresses
[24:41] and lord it has not been an easy journey
[24:44] but we thank you that
[24:45] your grace has brought us here this
[24:47] morning we didn't come by our own
[24:49] strength we are not here
[24:50] by our own ability we are not here
[24:52] because we are
[24:54] stronger than anybody but better than
[24:56] anybody but
[24:57] it is your grace and your blood that
[24:58] made a way for us father
[25:00] o wretched men that we are father that
[25:02] you would call us
[25:04] lord to this marvelous light father now
[25:06] may you walk out the pages of the bible
[25:08] and speak to your people
[25:10] lord in a way they have never heard
[25:12] before may they hear that voice
[25:14] that voice that summon lazarus me they
[25:16] hear that voice
[25:17] that voice that spoke to john may they
[25:20] hear that voice that spoke to your
[25:21] prophet lord
[25:22] may you speak to each one here this
[25:24] morning may you use me as your
[25:26] instrument take me out of the way
[25:28] i don't have a message of my own it is
[25:30] your message may you
[25:31] come to life to your people this morning
[25:33] may you lord break the chains of the
[25:36] captives in the house this morning
[25:38] lord they are those that are sick they
[25:39] are wary they are tired
[25:41] lord may heal and rain pour out this
[25:43] morning if there's a backslider here
[25:45] this morning father
[25:47] may you deliver them lord from whatever
[25:49] is binding them
[25:50] father we curse every foul spirit every
[25:53] unclean
[25:54] spirit every negative spirit we come
[25:56] against it
[25:57] by the power of the holy ghost in the
[26:00] name of the lord jesus christ
[26:02] and we declare this ground to be a
[26:04] delivery room this morning
[26:05] our delivery room to deliver your sons
[26:08] and daughters
[26:09] from the clasp of the enemy house of
[26:11] hell give way to the name of jesus
[26:14] may you anoint the reading of the word
[26:16] may you anoint the opening of the word
[26:18] to your people
[26:19] and may we leave this place with a shout
[26:21] may we leave this place in the spirit
[26:23] may we leave this place inspired
[26:26] may we leave this house motivated may we
[26:28] leave in courage
[26:30] may we leave on another level may you
[26:32] lift us up like the eagles fly
[26:34] lotto where we really belong we have
[26:37] been living under
[26:38] our privileges for a very long time
[26:41] but today is a new day we are in the
[26:43] lord's day today
[26:45] father may you drop down the shekinah
[26:47] glory
[26:48] mary august presents deity himself up
[26:51] lord may he reveal himself to sons and
[26:54] daughters
[26:55] we commit the service into your hands in
[26:57] the precious name of jesus christ
[26:59] and the church says and the church says
[27:03] amen you may be seated in the presence
[27:05] of the lord
[27:06] anybody excited to be in the house of
[27:08] the lord
[27:09] anybody excited to be a christian
[27:12] excited to be called in such a time as
[27:14] this
[27:15] hallelujah what's your identification
[27:18] the hot trials that's your
[27:19] identification
[27:20] the pressures that's your identification
[27:23] because god is going to have some
[27:24] diamonds
[27:25] he's going to have some pearls up he's
[27:27] going to have some jewels
[27:29] and all of these things have something
[27:31] in common it takes a certain amount of
[27:33] pressure
[27:33] to bring out the best in us so we thank
[27:36] god for the pressure
[27:37] we thank god when we are forsaken we
[27:40] thank god when we are desolate
[27:42] we thank god for when we are empty
[27:44] because nothing could happen that god
[27:46] does not allow
[27:47] your trials god allowed it because your
[27:50] back is broad enough to handle it
[27:52] your child has your name written on it
[27:55] don't try to avoid it it's for your good
[27:58] it's for your education it's for your
[28:00] strengthening
[28:01] it's to define who you are it's for you
[28:04] to get the stamp of approval
[28:05] that your character meets the
[28:07] requirement
[28:09] that god has for you so i'm excited this
[28:12] morning
[28:12] because the trial that you have right
[28:15] now is not worthy to be compared
[28:17] with the glory that's going to be
[28:19] revealed in you so lift your head up
[28:22] square your shoulders back up walk the
[28:24] way you're supposed to walk
[28:26] because you are sons and daughters of
[28:28] the living god i didn't ask what you did
[28:30] yesterday
[28:31] sons make mistakes i didn't ask what you
[28:33] did last week
[28:35] daughters make mistake your conditions
[28:38] your past your mystics have nothing to
[28:40] do
[28:40] with who you are you could try to change
[28:43] your name
[28:44] but in god's mind you have a name and
[28:46] there's a new name
[28:47] coming he is looking at you right now
[28:50] and he's calling from the east
[28:52] he's calling from the west he's calling
[28:54] from the north
[28:55] and he's calling from the south and if
[28:57] any man hear my voice
[28:59] he said all that the father had given me
[29:02] must come
[29:03] there's a voice that's calling this
[29:04] morning and when that voice begins to
[29:07] speak up
[29:08] there is no kind of rebuttal there's no
[29:10] kind of
[29:11] answer there's no i'm not coming when
[29:13] that voice said lazarus
[29:15] come forth lazarus was tied up and he
[29:18] had to come
[29:20] he was bound up and he had to come up he
[29:23] was wrapped up
[29:24] but he had to come so even after jesus
[29:27] called him
[29:28] he had to tell him lose him and let him
[29:30] go
[29:31] he is free but he doesn't know it he's
[29:33] on fire
[29:34] but he doesn't know it he's been dead
[29:37] but
[29:37] now he's alive and by the end of this
[29:40] service
[29:41] well you don't hear me this morning by
[29:43] the end of this service
[29:45] somebody's going to be alive
[29:50] hallelujah hallelujah
[29:53] let me warn you this morning i don't
[29:55] know what's going to happen
[29:57] but god knows what's going to happen and
[29:59] that's what excites me
[30:01] because he knows the beginning and he
[30:03] knows the ending
[30:04] he knows what you're going through and
[30:06] he said all things work together for
[30:08] good
[30:09] to tim not love god to them who has he
[30:12] called
[30:12] according to his purpose the fact that
[30:15] you are here this morning
[30:16] is evidence that you have been called
[30:19] according to his purpose
[30:21] so why are you living under your
[30:23] privileges
[30:24] why the sad faces why the depressed
[30:27] faces
[30:27] why the poor me no it's not poor me
[30:31] i am
[30:34] can the church say amen you may be
[30:37] seated
[30:39] it's good to see you in the house of the
[30:40] lord
[30:42] this is where you're supposed to be
[30:43] every sunday it's not supposed to be a
[30:46] pressure to come to church you're
[30:47] supposed to be excited
[30:49] from monday morning you're supposed to
[30:50] be excited to come to church the next
[30:52] sunday
[30:54] what you could get here your employer
[30:56] cannot give you
[30:58] no bonus could give you the news
[31:00] reporter cannot give you
[31:02] the psychologist cannot give you the
[31:05] doctor cannot give you
[31:06] a move he cannot give you a book cannot
[31:09] give you
[31:10] a friend cannot give you this is
[31:12] eternity
[31:13] this is eternal everything else is
[31:16] temporary
[31:17] everything else will come to an end so
[31:19] we are here to partake
[31:21] of eternity this morning we're here to
[31:23] eat manna
[31:24] hidden man up from under the seventh
[31:26] seal
[31:27] fresh food this morning so we can
[31:29] continue along the journey
[31:33] why because he who started the work in
[31:36] you is more than able to bring it to
[31:38] pass
[31:39] you may be seated do you understand it's
[31:42] not your ability
[31:44] it's not your strength
[31:48] it's not your achievement brother
[31:51] branham said if there's anything to
[31:52] happen it wouldn't even be your prayer
[31:54] it'll be the grace
[31:56] of god no wonder the headstone will come
[31:59] with
[32:00] shouting crying grace when they wrote me
[32:03] off there was grace
[32:05] when they said i couldn't make it there
[32:06] was grace when the doctor gave up on me
[32:09] there was grace
[32:11] when my neighbors gave up on me there
[32:13] was grace it
[32:14] is grace to serve the lord
[32:17] grace in your trial grace in your
[32:20] testing
[32:21] grace when you have no money grace when
[32:24] you're feeling sick
[32:25] it's till the grace of god you may be
[32:28] seated
[32:31] so i'm under great expectation this
[32:33] morning
[32:34] and every day my eyes my excitement
[32:37] grows
[32:40] to realize that we are one day closer to
[32:42] the rapture
[32:44] one day closer to the resurrection one
[32:47] day closer to seeing believers who
[32:49] we don't see anymore because they are
[32:50] waiting on us they are not dead they are
[32:52] waiting on us
[32:53] they are just sleeping they are waiting
[32:55] with a time when we could reunite again
[32:59] i'm on the expectation of visitation to
[33:01] the young people
[33:02] and it's good to see so many young
[33:04] people here this morning
[33:06] because god promised a visitation he
[33:09] promised to give
[33:10] you a charge an anointing an experience
[33:12] with god
[33:13] that a book cannot give you a professor
[33:16] cannot give you a mentor cannot give you
[33:19] it's an experience on the inside i'm on
[33:21] the expectation
[33:22] for dynamics under the expectation for
[33:25] power
[33:26] because we have had word upon word line
[33:28] upon line
[33:29] precept upon precept for years but what
[33:32] we need is this word to come alive
[33:34] and brother pranam said one day the
[33:36] right words will be spoken
[33:38] and something is going to happen and
[33:40] somebody somewhere
[33:42] will dash into the presence of almighty
[33:44] god
[33:45] may this day be your day
[33:48] [Applause]
[33:51] backsliders being restored
[33:54] to him not overcoming will i make a
[33:56] pillar in my house
[33:58] a pillar in my temple and the bible said
[34:01] you'll go
[34:01] no more out so there comes a point in
[34:04] your walk with god where
[34:06] there is no thought of backsliding there
[34:08] is no thought of
[34:09] going back to the ability the desire the
[34:12] the weaknesses that you feel will no
[34:14] longer exist because there's an anchor
[34:16] that holds in spite of the storm he
[34:18] didn't say the storms would stop coming
[34:21] but the anchor is going to hold despite
[34:24] of the storm he didn't say the winds
[34:26] would not get contrary but the anchor
[34:28] will hold
[34:29] despite the winds blowing you this way
[34:32] and
[34:32] blowing you that way and when it looks
[34:34] as if all hope is going the anchor
[34:37] it's going to hold can the church say
[34:40] amen
[34:42] hallelujah so are you happy this morning
[34:46] so as excited as i am god is more
[34:49] excited
[34:51] because he's been looking for this day
[34:52] for a long time
[34:54] until you like the prodigal son could
[34:56] come to
[34:57] your senses
[35:00] because that's something only you could
[35:02] do you know only you could come to your
[35:04] senses
[35:05] your neighbor the pastor cannot come to
[35:08] his senses for you or your senses for
[35:10] you
[35:10] there's no such thing but you have to
[35:12] come to your senses
[35:14] to realize that there's more in you than
[35:16] you realize
[35:17] to realize there's more for you than
[35:19] against you to realize that you have
[35:21] been predestinated
[35:22] for such a time as this can the church
[35:24] say man
[35:26] so i have a title this morning i was
[35:28] just testing the temperature
[35:31] to see who's here you know and people
[35:33] who are
[35:34] absent from the body but not present
[35:36] with the lord they're just sitting there
[35:38] i want to make sure everybody is here
[35:40] and on their post of duty with their
[35:42] swords drawn because we are in spiritual
[35:44] warfare
[35:46] so my title this morning is taken from
[35:50] the first verse
[35:53] of revelation 4. my title is come up
[35:56] hither and my subject the voice
[36:00] of god and my inspiration the voice
[36:04] of deliverance can the church say amen
[36:09] so god is going to have a bride i just
[36:11] want to lay a foundation before i get to
[36:12] my text
[36:13] and that bride will be a word bride
[36:17] there has never been a bride like this
[36:19] brian and there will never be one like
[36:21] this bride and what's about to happen
[36:24] could not have happened before because
[36:27] in the back part of his mind he saw
[36:29] it all play out and god could afford to
[36:32] look
[36:32] and sit back and now watch it unfold
[36:35] because brother branham said god could
[36:37] tie up the devil any time
[36:40] and that's what god has done he has
[36:42] really tied up the devil because the
[36:43] devil can only see at a certain level
[36:45] but god is watching your victory and
[36:48] he's smiling because
[36:49] it looks like you're not going to make
[36:51] it and you know who
[36:53] you are the last live love the best
[36:58] god is looking smiling saying he's
[37:01] already made it
[37:02] he's already overcome because that's
[37:04] what foreknowledge does
[37:06] he knows the end before the beginning
[37:08] that's why he wrote your name in blood
[37:10] [Applause]
[37:12] and there's no eraser there's no liquid
[37:14] paper
[37:15] there's no backspace button there's no
[37:18] delete
[37:19] button there's no mistake any file gone
[37:21] missing
[37:22] your name has been written in blood
[37:27] can the church say amen so the holy
[37:30] spirit today the manifestation of the
[37:33] holy spirit
[37:34] is that angel trying to get the people
[37:36] back to the world
[37:38] [Applause]
[37:39] because the holy spirit will only
[37:41] vindicate the word
[37:42] and that's why i challenge you in your
[37:44] daily walk to apply the token but the
[37:47] brandon said is to apply
[37:48] every word don't just hear the message
[37:52] or say i
[37:53] believe the message but apply every word
[37:56] to your life apply it to your house
[37:59] when it looks as if nothing is changing
[38:01] apply it anyway
[38:03] because that's your responsibility you
[38:05] got to say
[38:06] i'm going to be filled my son is going
[38:08] to be restored
[38:10] that's applying the token to your life
[38:12] because
[38:13] full obedience to every word of god will
[38:16] entitle you to the token
[38:18] can the church say amen and that word
[38:21] will defeat the enemy
[38:22] any place anytime under any
[38:26] condition can the church say amen
[38:29] so wonderful so we read the scripture
[38:34] about john having an experience with god
[38:40] and john is very interesting because the
[38:42] more i
[38:43] find myself in the scripture i find it's
[38:45] it's so powerful
[38:47] what is said and what is not said and
[38:48] when you really go deeper when you look
[38:50] at david and you look at
[38:51] caleb and you look at through the old
[38:54] and the new testament the experiences
[38:56] that these men of god
[38:57] had gone through and this book of
[39:01] revelation i believe was written
[39:02] over a period of about three years and
[39:05] john
[39:06] found himself on the isle of patmos
[39:09] found himself in exile because they
[39:12] didn't know
[39:12] what to do with him
[39:17] they tried boiling him in oil and they
[39:19] couldn't kill him
[39:21] they tried throwing him out and doing
[39:23] this to him brother branham said they
[39:24] call him a witch but that didn't stop
[39:26] him
[39:28] and after about 62 years after the
[39:30] crucifixion he is banished to the isle
[39:32] of patmos with
[39:34] with criminals because it's an exiled
[39:36] island where
[39:37] where the worst of the criminals find
[39:39] themselves
[39:41] he was not like the others he wasn't
[39:42] there for robbery he wasn't there for
[39:44] killing somebody he wasn't there but the
[39:46] bible said he was there for the word of
[39:48] god and the testimony of jesus christ
[39:51] what a reason to be in prison what a
[39:53] reason to be in exile
[39:55] the bible didn't tell us if there were
[39:56] other brothers to encourage him
[39:58] if he had a prayer group but what we
[40:00] know he was there
[40:01] by himself and and he's struggling
[40:04] because it's not easy he wasn't on a
[40:05] couch or a hammock
[40:06] but in that exile state he would have
[40:08] been working
[40:10] it would have been a hard experience it
[40:12] would have been a tough experience
[40:13] it would have been a rugged place
[40:16] i don't know if he had a day off or not
[40:18] but the bible said
[40:20] it was the lord's day
[40:23] and he was in the spirit of the lord's
[40:25] day his prison didn't stop him from
[40:27] being in the spirit
[40:29] his prison didn't stop him from
[40:30] worshiping his prison didn't stop him
[40:33] for recognizing that it was the lord's
[40:35] day
[40:36] he might have had a hard day before but
[40:38] that didn't change the fact
[40:40] that he was in the lord's day can the
[40:43] church say amen
[40:46] blessed be the name is everybody with me
[40:48] this morning
[40:49] so your situation your circumstance your
[40:51] problem your trial
[40:53] is no excuse hallelujah
[40:56] hallelujah and while he was there the
[40:59] bible said he heard a voice
[41:01] say come up hither and when john
[41:04] heard that voice the bible says
[41:06] immediately
[41:08] he was in the spirit i want to drop off
[41:11] something to you this morning
[41:12] it's one thing when you're in the spirit
[41:14] because you're prayed up and you're in
[41:15] the spirit because you're in the word
[41:17] but when you hear that voice speak to
[41:20] you directly
[41:21] immediately you get in the spirit you
[41:24] can't put it on it
[41:25] it's not a show it has nothing to do
[41:28] with anybody else
[41:29] but there's power in that voice and if
[41:31] that voice he said it was the first
[41:33] voice it was the
[41:34] same voice he heard in in revelation 1
[41:37] it was the same voice
[41:38] and that voice said come up heather john
[41:41] i know you have the holy ghost
[41:42] john i know you are chosen john i know
[41:45] you're anointed
[41:46] but i got something more to show you i
[41:48] got something higher to show you
[41:50] so come up hither come above your
[41:52] situation
[41:53] come above your problem don't exist down
[41:57] there the isle of patmos something
[41:58] i don't want to talk to you when you're
[42:00] down here in your dumps you come
[42:02] up here come up hither raise up get
[42:04] shake yourself up
[42:05] come up heather i got something i want
[42:07] to show you i can't show you when you're
[42:10] in your pity party
[42:11] i can't show you when you focus on your
[42:13] family i can't show you
[42:15] when you focus on the jobs will come up
[42:17] hither can the church say amen
[42:21] oh blessed be the name of the lord oh
[42:24] hallelujah there's john by himself
[42:28] john has nobody with him he is there in
[42:31] isolation
[42:32] he is forsaken he is alone he is in
[42:36] exile there's nobody say come on john
[42:38] you can make it
[42:39] john is there by himself but he doesn't
[42:41] forget who he
[42:43] he is there by himself and he doesn't
[42:45] forget where he comes from
[42:47] john is there by himself and while he's
[42:49] there working i'm sure he can remember
[42:51] hearing jesus in matthew 16 saying who
[42:54] do men say that i am
[42:55] john is there but he's connected to who
[42:58] he is
[42:59] because nothing could shake him but the
[43:01] branham said god
[43:02] had to allow john to reach into that
[43:04] condition
[43:05] for us to have a book of revelation so
[43:08] if god
[43:08] would let john go through that hard
[43:11] trial
[43:12] for us to have a book of revelation so
[43:14] we can know what's about to happen
[43:16] what do you think god will do for you
[43:18] and your family
[43:19] what will god pass you through you don't
[43:21] hear me this morning
[43:25] you may be seated
[43:28] and john if you could dare say
[43:33] you know the bible said east jacob i
[43:36] love you so i hate it
[43:39] god is sovereign he could do whatever he
[43:41] wants
[43:42] but out of all the disciples we hear a
[43:44] lot about peter and peter's fate but
[43:47] john was the one they said jesus loved
[43:53] in fact his love for john was so much
[43:55] that the disciple
[43:56] asks what will happen to this one
[44:00] call john and jesus said to them what is
[44:03] it to thee
[44:05] if he tarries until i come
[44:09] and those brothers say but wait i look
[44:11] like john will never die
[44:13] jesus loved john so much just this
[44:15] journey
[44:16] and this same john god allowed him to be
[44:19] exiled
[44:20] persecuted beard a reproach of isolation
[44:24] nobody to preach to nobody to preach to
[44:26] him he's in solitude
[44:28] but many times god has to strip
[44:30] everything away from us
[44:31] to get our attention and while
[44:35] john is there on the lord's day of
[44:37] voices of his come up heather
[44:39] i gotta show you something that's about
[44:41] to take place
[44:42] can the church say man someone
[44:45] encourage you something no matter where
[44:48] you are right now there's a higher place
[44:49] for
[44:50] you no matter your position how long
[44:53] you've been in the message
[44:54] how long even the christian days higher
[44:56] for you this morning
[44:58] there's more power there's more grace
[45:00] there's more anointing
[45:02] there's more spilling there's waved
[45:04] after wave after wave
[45:06] so i encourage you this morning to come
[45:08] up hither
[45:11] john was being brought to a place he'd
[45:12] never been before
[45:14] and in that place he saw mirrors of
[45:16] redeemed people
[45:17] he was caught up he saw the throne room
[45:20] and he saw somebody on the throne and
[45:22] you recognize that king on the throne
[45:24] can the church say amen
[45:28] and brother branham he typed it out in
[45:30] the book revelation chapter
[45:32] 4 chapter 1 and chapter 2 and he speaks
[45:35] about after this i
[45:36] looked and behold a door was open in
[45:38] heaven and the first voice which i heard
[45:40] was as it were for trumpet
[45:42] he said that trumpet is the voice of god
[45:44] it's a it's a voice of war
[45:46] saying come up hither i will show thee
[45:48] things which must be hereafter
[45:51] there was no secret god was keeping back
[45:53] from john and the bible said
[45:55] immediately i was in the spirit and
[45:57] behold a throne was set in heaven
[45:59] and one sat on the throne and brother
[46:02] branham said
[46:04] that everything was tied up in that room
[46:07] that that throne room he said it was
[46:09] lightning and thunders and flashings
[46:12] he said it was not a throne of mercy it
[46:14] was a throne of judgment
[46:16] he said because at that point in time it
[46:18] was after the church ages
[46:20] but he said right now that throne has
[46:22] blood over it
[46:24] so because of the blood on the throne
[46:25] that throne is now a mercy seat
[46:28] that if you want mercy you could go to
[46:29] the throne but at that time because john
[46:32] represented a bride and john being
[46:35] called to come up hither was a type of
[46:37] the rapture
[46:38] but before the rapture could take place
[46:40] there's blood
[46:42] there's blood on the throne there's
[46:44] mercy on the throne
[46:46] come all ye who are heavy laden and i
[46:48] will give you rest
[46:49] there's mercy for you there's mercy for
[46:52] your family
[46:53] can the church say man he may be seated
[46:59] on the throne the bible speaks about
[47:02] jasper and sanding
[47:04] speak about the throne and speak about
[47:06] the stone that speak about the types
[47:07] under the brandon said you can run it
[47:09] through the scripture
[47:10] a few weeks ago when we were speaking
[47:12] about caleb we talked about
[47:13] how whenever those hebrew mothers would
[47:15] give birth and say e frame
[47:18] and they would say their name they were
[47:20] positionally placing
[47:23] that child in the promised land do you
[47:25] remember then
[47:26] when manasseh and judah and siemian when
[47:29] the name was called
[47:30] they were being cried out in bird pain
[47:34] but not only would they be in place but
[47:36] the pranam said
[47:37] that their birth also came with a stone
[47:41] and that stone was going to represent
[47:43] every tribe
[47:45] so the high priest when he had the urim
[47:47] thumb him
[47:49] there were 12 stones which represented
[47:51] the 12 tribes
[47:52] so whenever you have a prophecy or a
[47:54] dream you bring it before the high
[47:56] priest
[47:57] and when you stood before the high
[47:59] priest and you prophesied or you
[48:01] told whatever experience you had if it
[48:04] was of god a supernatural
[48:06] light would flash over the urim thumb
[48:09] and if all 12 stones lit up then they
[48:12] knew it was of god
[48:14] that was god's way of showing them that
[48:16] is of god can the church say amen
[48:19] and brother pranam said when john stood
[48:21] in the throne room
[48:22] and he's looking at this whole display
[48:24] of stuff that's about to happen
[48:26] god was tying the old testament and the
[48:29] new testament
[48:30] to beginning at the end and he said
[48:32] jasper and sardine represented the
[48:34] stones
[48:35] from the old patriarchs from the first
[48:38] born
[48:39] to the last born god was showing john
[48:42] that he is the alpha and he is the omega
[48:45] he is the beginning
[48:46] he is the ending and john is standing
[48:49] there
[48:50] seeing emerald seeing amber seeing god's
[48:53] deity
[48:54] cena 24 the four peace
[48:58] and the 24 ella's and seeing what's
[49:00] about to happen
[49:02] [Applause]
[49:03] you may be seated and brother branham
[49:06] and preaching these two messages
[49:08] he said these messages have to stabilize
[49:10] you
[49:11] it's not just to come to you to say i'm
[49:13] happy i'm joyful no it just stabilizes
[49:15] you
[49:15] for you to understand that you are part
[49:17] of a royal priesthood
[49:19] that you are royal seeds of abraham and
[49:22] if you are a child of the king you have
[49:23] to walk like one
[49:25] you have to talk like one you have to be
[49:27] in the spirit
[49:28] you have to walk in the spirit
[49:30] [Applause]
[49:33] so i pray this morning the same voice
[49:36] that john heard
[49:37] that said come up hither that same voice
[49:39] will speak to your heart this morning
[49:41] it's a same voice that lazarus heard
[49:43] it's the same voice
[49:45] that when the boat was rocking and jesus
[49:47] was asleep
[49:48] and they thought they were going to tie
[49:50] and they don't know what to do they said
[49:51] let's wake jesus
[49:54] the winds are contrary all hell is
[49:57] against me when they walk jesus
[49:58] jesus looked at them what you worried
[50:01] about
[50:02] peace be still and he turned back and
[50:05] went back to sleep
[50:06] he didn't even wonder how it was gonna
[50:08] work out
[50:09] because when he spoke something has to
[50:12] happen
[50:12] and the disciples ask themselves a
[50:14] question
[50:15] what manner of man is this we have never
[50:19] seen man like this before
[50:22] no book has it no encyclopedia has it
[50:25] what manner of man is this that even the
[50:28] winds
[50:28] and the seas obey him but it was that
[50:31] voice
[50:31] it was that same voice that said let
[50:33] there be light
[50:35] that same voice is the voice that called
[50:37] john
[50:38] that's the voice that called you because
[50:40] you couldn't be here this morning
[50:42] if the father didn't call you he called
[50:45] your name
[50:46] and you answered
[50:49] can the church say amen hallelujah
[50:52] hallelujah you may be seated
[51:02] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[51:04] hallelujah
[51:05] so you couldn't even be here this
[51:07] morning unless god called you
[51:09] you couldn't be here this morning unless
[51:11] you heard your name
[51:13] because there are many people who won
[51:14] this there are people who want to be
[51:16] free
[51:17] but they cannot be free because they are
[51:19] not predestinated to be free
[51:21] there are people in the nomination in
[51:23] churches having a form of godliness
[51:25] they want to be in church they are
[51:27] religious people but they are not
[51:29] predestinated
[51:30] their names have not been called but not
[51:32] you your names have been called
[51:34] out brother branham's message a shout
[51:37] message
[51:37] was to call names his message was a
[51:40] message of name calling
[51:41] and whenever you hear your name there's
[51:44] got to be something on the inside
[51:46] that has to respond
[51:49] you may be seated oh hallelujah
[51:52] hallelujah you may be seated have you
[51:55] ever been walking down the street
[51:57] and somebody called a name but it sounds
[52:00] like your name
[52:01] maybe you don't know who they are but
[52:03] but maybe anthony you're walking down
[52:04] the street and hear somebody say tony
[52:06] and you look around and and you're
[52:07] wondering if it's you but there's
[52:08] another person that they're calling
[52:10] but it's something inside you have to
[52:12] respond because since you know yourself
[52:15] you have responded to that name well
[52:17] that's what's going on this morning
[52:19] whenever we hear
[52:19] adoption
[52:23] whenever you hear perfectionists
[52:27] whenever you hear the holy ghost summit
[52:29] but that's
[52:30] that's the only name and overcomer you
[52:34] turn around you gotta be talking about
[52:36] me
[52:36] more than a conqueror who's calling my
[52:39] name
[52:40] who's calling my name this morning son
[52:42] of the king
[52:43] that's high priest
[52:47] can the church say man am i talking to
[52:50] anybody this morning
[52:51] do you recognize who you are that's why
[52:54] brother branham said the moment
[52:56] the bride recognizes who she is it'll be
[52:58] a national
[52:59] showdown the devil is finished
[53:02] [Applause]
[53:04] every word every promise every promise
[53:07] in the book is mine
[53:10] you may be cheated so i want to
[53:12] challenge you
[53:13] it's so powerful because the bible said
[53:16] life and debt
[53:17] is in the power of the tongue i don't
[53:19] want you answer to high blood pressure
[53:21] no more
[53:21] don't answer the diabetes no more don't
[53:25] answer to feed me that's not your name
[53:27] don't answer to being tired i am
[53:30] depressed you do you can't say that
[53:32] that's not your name i'm backslidden
[53:35] that's not your name
[53:37] who are you who are you this morning
[53:41] you are not jacob you are israel that's
[53:44] who you are

[54:50] sickness is not my name
[54:52] it's not who i am this lust this demon

[55:07] hallelujah hallelujah
[55:11] my john
[55:14] a type of the bride is there in the
[55:17] throne room
[55:18] and we have an appointment with the
[55:20] throne room to him that overcome it
[55:23] will sit with me in my throne you are
[55:26] part of him
[55:27] as much as he is part of you how could
[55:30] my hand be upset to the rest of my body
[55:32] it's a part of me it's an extension of
[55:34] who i am
[55:36] you might not see my face but my hand is
[55:38] still my hand and you might think you
[55:39] are the least part of the body but you
[55:41] are part of the body
[55:42] and wherever the body goes you have to
[55:45] go
[55:46] you don't hear me this morning so if my
[55:48] foot is giving trouble
[55:50] he can say i'm staying here and the rest
[55:52] of the body is going here
[55:54] so even if i have to use a crutches or
[55:56] use a sling
[55:57] you're still going i don't even got the

[56:06] little finger in the body that's giving

[56:29] because the head christ himself has
[56:32] taken
[56:32] property has taken ownership have taken
[56:35] command of the body
[56:36] and the body has got to go wherever the
[56:38] head goes he is head of the church

[58:18] considered
[58:20] terrorizing
[58:24] bothering stressing out this man called
[58:27] job
[58:33] i thought about it but when i look at
[58:35] the hedge
[58:36] when i look at the protection when i
[58:38] look at the anointing
[58:40] when i look at the way job walks and the
[58:42] way job talks
[58:44] and job's prayer life and the way job
[58:46] encourages himself
[58:49] i tell myself not that one
[58:54] so by the night god say all right i'll
[58:57] remove the hedge
[58:58] i'll remove the protection go touch him

[59:02] do what you want to him and i'll give
[59:03] you mine and go out smiling
[59:05] am i ready here today i know why sanju
[59:08] the god is boasting because he's proud
[59:10] no matter what the pressure is you lose
[59:12] the car you lose
[59:13] five tires and you're driving on an iron
[59:19] you're still smiling the point was why
[59:22] why are you smiling you have no idea
[59:25] though he's slimy yet still like
[59:31] [Applause]
[59:38] and you know like your notifications on
[59:40] your phone you get one email you get a
[59:42] whatsapp get a text to get everything
[59:44] one after the next they bring any report
[59:46] for job
[59:47] animals your children the farm the truck
[59:50] break down the
[59:51] bank account frozen the credit card not
[59:54] working the max trip not working
[59:55] your car pay for this you can do that
[59:57] your country doctor canceled every
[1:00:00] god
[1:00:04] and god is smiling because his strength
[1:00:08] is made perfect in our weakness
[1:00:14] because when you think it's about you
[1:00:16] it's about him
[1:00:18] that's why he said for his namesake you
[1:00:21] see god doesn't play with his name you
[1:00:22] know
[1:00:23] you see years ago there were no written
[1:00:25] contracts there were no written there
[1:00:26] were no
[1:00:27] lawyers who would say sign here inside
[1:00:29] here your name was your bond
[1:00:31] so when you tell somebody i will buy
[1:00:34] that land that was the contract
[1:00:36] your word was your bond and because you
[1:00:39] want to protect your word which is your
[1:00:40] name
[1:00:41] you would make everything happen to make
[1:00:43] that transaction happen
[1:00:45] and god is very old school
[1:00:49] so when he says i'm gonna deliver you
[1:00:51] for his namesake
[1:00:52] he's gonna do it
[1:00:56] when he said you're gonna get the holy
[1:00:58] ghost for his namesake
[1:01:00] because he can't lie and he never did it
[1:01:03] and he can't start no so when he said
[1:01:05] you're gonna be adopted
[1:01:06] for his name's sake
[1:01:11] he has got to do it can the church say
[1:01:14] amen
[1:01:15] [Applause]
[1:01:18] so we are predestinated friends to climb
[1:01:20] higher
[1:01:21] from fate all the way to charity can the
[1:01:25] church say amen come up hither
[1:01:27] predestinated until such a time as this
[1:01:31] god allowed you to come into your family
[1:01:34] come into your neighborhood
[1:01:35] go to the school you went through go to
[1:01:37] the jobs you went through
[1:01:39] meet the people that you met all of that
[1:01:41] to bring you to a spot
[1:01:42] for you to climb higher to climb out of
[1:01:45] your condition
[1:01:47] can the church say man remember that
[1:01:49] branham said in the message
[1:01:50] revelation chapter four in part one
[1:01:53] he said this fourth chapter is right
[1:01:55] after the layer the laodicean church age
[1:01:58] and he said the leonardo sanchez is the
[1:02:00] most messed up church age
[1:02:02] of every age he said you know why
[1:02:05] because this
[1:02:06] church that was supposed to be christ
[1:02:08] church put jesus
[1:02:09] outside of the church
[1:02:14] could you imagine you build something
[1:02:16] and it's yours and your people put you
[1:02:18] out
[1:02:20] in the business world steve jobs started
[1:02:22] apple company
[1:02:23] and for years apple was being built he
[1:02:25] wasn't going too well then they threw
[1:02:26] him out the company
[1:02:29] and they tried for years and he
[1:02:30] recognized they need to bring him back
[1:02:32] in
[1:02:33] and it's only when they brought him back
[1:02:34] in the company did better than it ever
[1:02:36] did before
[1:02:37] and here it is jesus builds his church
[1:02:40] inaudible pentecost
[1:02:42] and through the passage of time by the
[1:02:45] laodicean church age he's not
[1:02:47] invited into the church
[1:02:50] he meets a closed door and he's forced
[1:02:54] to say behold
[1:02:55] i stand at the door and knock
[1:02:59] and if any man would open i will come
[1:03:02] and support him
[1:03:06] and after that passage brother branham
[1:03:08] said here we find
[1:03:09] john in chapter 4
[1:03:13] dealing with the god of heaven being put
[1:03:15] out of his own church
[1:03:19] john on the isle of patmos as it were
[1:03:22] 30 miles from the coast about 15 miles
[1:03:26] round about
[1:03:27] and it was an exile for the romans to
[1:03:29] put prisoners
[1:03:30] out there but the random said and john
[1:03:32] was out there for what what did he do
[1:03:34] did he steal something no they put him
[1:03:36] out there because he was disturbed when
[1:03:37] the people are doing something even
[1:03:38] though
[1:03:39] he was there for the word of god and his
[1:03:42] testimony
[1:03:43] for preaching the gospel
[1:03:45] [Applause]
[1:03:47] make let that be your testimony
[1:03:50] that you are persecuted because you
[1:03:52] stood for the gospel
[1:03:53] you stood for the truth you stood for
[1:03:56] what is right can the church see amen
[1:04:01] and begin the fourth chapter after this
[1:04:03] i looked and behold the door was open in
[1:04:04] heaven and the first voice which i heard
[1:04:06] was
[1:04:06] as there were a trumpet talking with me
[1:04:09] which said come up hither
[1:04:10] and i will show the things which must be
[1:04:13] hereafter
[1:04:14] and by the brand i said we're going to
[1:04:15] take it verse by verse he said i've got
[1:04:17] a lot of scriptures here
[1:04:19] that i want to get to you he said and
[1:04:22] all this from hereafter now will be
[1:04:24] pertaining
[1:04:25] will take place on earth after the
[1:04:27] rapture of the church
[1:04:31] you see after the rapture this is going
[1:04:33] back now to pick up israel
[1:04:35] after the church age after the ages of
[1:04:38] the church
[1:04:40] and then he goes on to talk about the
[1:04:41] marriage of the lamb in this great
[1:04:43] wedding
[1:04:44] let us be glad and rejoice and give
[1:04:45] honor to him for the marriage of the
[1:04:47] lamb has come
[1:04:48] and his wife had made herself ready
[1:04:51] so but abandonment using all of this to
[1:04:53] create a sense of urgency and it's but
[1:04:55] over preach
[1:04:56] last week it's later than we think
[1:04:59] amen and we must know exactly where we
[1:05:02] stand because if we don't
[1:05:03] because i'm taught as teaching places
[1:05:06] the believer
[1:05:07] so you have to understand your position
[1:05:10] understand where we are at so you know
[1:05:12] what you need
[1:05:13] to do remember the brand said blessed
[1:05:17] are they which are called to the
[1:05:18] marriage supper of the lamb
[1:05:22] there's going to be a meeting in the air
[1:05:23] one of these days in that sweet
[1:05:25] sweet bye and bye just stay ready keep
[1:05:27] yourself ready
[1:05:28] purge your heart from all evil thinking
[1:05:31] have faith in god no matter how dark it
[1:05:33] looks
[1:05:34] how many laps and makes fun and says
[1:05:36] you're making a mistake
[1:05:39] keep right on living holy and living for
[1:05:41] god
[1:05:42] just keep more moving on the hour will
[1:05:46] [Applause]
[1:05:48] arrive
[1:05:50] brother branham said that john saw that
[1:05:54] door
[1:05:55] remember i'm going to type it he said
[1:05:57] behold i've said before the unopened
[1:05:59] door
[1:06:00] that no man can shut and no man can open
[1:06:03] no
[1:06:04] preacher could shut it and no preacher
[1:06:06] could open it
[1:06:07] because that door is christ he says i am
[1:06:10] the daughter of the sheepfold
[1:06:12] and the man said that door is the holy
[1:06:14] ghost he said there's only one door to
[1:06:16] the church of the living god and jesus
[1:06:18] is that door
[1:06:19] he said i am the door i am the daughter
[1:06:22] the sheep for
[1:06:23] i am the way amen
[1:06:26] but the man said he said this to the
[1:06:28] church age he said it to the methodists
[1:06:30] and they turned away and went into
[1:06:32] organization
[1:06:33] but i've sat before you and opened oh
[1:06:37] he said i put an opener which is the
[1:06:39] holy spirit that by one spirit
[1:06:42] we are all baptized into one body which
[1:06:45] is christ
[1:06:47] he said that message before the
[1:06:48] methodists they turn it away
[1:06:51] they come up to signification and they
[1:06:52] refuse the holy ghost
[1:06:54] that open though how do you get into
[1:06:56] christ by one spirit
[1:06:58] the holy spirit which is christ's spirit
[1:07:02] i want to name a noun we have entered it
[1:07:04] not by handshaking
[1:07:05] not by sprinkling but by one holy ghost
[1:07:08] baptism
[1:07:10] we are all baptized into one body and
[1:07:12] made partakers
[1:07:14] of that body can the church say amen
[1:07:18] so when the brahman is beginning to
[1:07:19] dramatize as he's laying out this
[1:07:21] message
[1:07:22] he's making sure that they understand
[1:07:24] where he's coming from
[1:07:26] and he's saying john is in patmos and
[1:07:28] he's caught up
[1:07:29] after the church ages has ceased and he
[1:07:31] hears her voice
[1:07:32] and he looks up towards heaven he sees
[1:07:34] an open door and the first voice is a
[1:07:36] trumpet
[1:07:39] that voice but abraham said is the same
[1:07:40] voice that walked into seven golden
[1:07:43] candlesticks
[1:07:44] it's the same voice that spoke of the
[1:07:46] church ages
[1:07:49] can the church say amen amen hallelujah
[1:07:56] but the random goes on a speaker by that
[1:07:58] door and he said listen
[1:08:01] let me skip this
[1:08:06] he said all right he said i want you to
[1:08:08] notice the voice he heard speaking to
[1:08:10] him
[1:08:10] had the clearness of a trumpet you know
[1:08:13] how a trumpet sounds
[1:08:14] it gives a shrill sound what does a
[1:08:16] trumpet mean in the bible it means war
[1:08:20] anytime you see a trumpet blow in a war
[1:08:22] in a bible time
[1:08:24] it sounded meant a war either a
[1:08:25] revelation or
[1:08:27] something takes place and after the
[1:08:29] church ages was over and everything was
[1:08:31] come ready
[1:08:32] made already the setting of the fourth
[1:08:34] chapter the church ages was done
[1:08:36] he had done left the earth see remember
[1:08:39] the voice that spoke to him behind him
[1:08:41] in the seven golden scandal six the work
[1:08:43] is finished
[1:08:44] and now that same voice is speaking up
[1:08:46] in heaven what was it
[1:08:48] he had done redeemed his people his
[1:08:51] earthly work was finished
[1:08:53] and he was in glory calling to john come
[1:08:55] up hither
[1:08:56] he said but about that makes me feel
[1:08:58] like shouting on the eve of the new year
[1:09:00] oh my there you are see come up here
[1:09:03] this is the setting of the great battle
[1:09:05] listen to how he describes it
[1:09:07] the people that rejected god's message
[1:09:12] rejected the holy spirit the messenger
[1:09:15] of the seven church ages who is the
[1:09:17] messenger of the seven church jesus the
[1:09:19] holy spirit is the messenger of the
[1:09:20] seventh church jesus
[1:09:21] the one that had rejected this message
[1:09:24] of grace
[1:09:24] had nothing left but judgment oh
[1:09:27] while he is making ready to pour out the
[1:09:30] plagues upon the earth now
[1:09:31] he says come up hither so this message
[1:09:34] this morning have come up hither
[1:09:36] is not just for you to get into the
[1:09:37] spirit it's really preparing you for
[1:09:40] that call
[1:09:41] that one day we'll see come up hither to
[1:09:43] call to the rapture
[1:09:44] to call to the resurrection is that what
[1:09:46] you're looking for this morning
[1:09:48] to get called out of this world before
[1:09:50] the terrible plague strike
[1:09:52] before the judgment strikes
[1:09:53] [Applause]
[1:09:57] so brother branham saying this scripture
[1:10:00] while he's making ready listen carefully
[1:10:02] to pour out the plagues upon the earth
[1:10:05] come up hither
[1:10:06] and i'll show you what's fixing to take
[1:10:08] place
[1:10:09] christ rejecting godless sinners i'm
[1:10:12] gonna pour my wrath
[1:10:13] upon them watch the setting oh as we go
[1:10:16] down through the night you'll get more
[1:10:18] of this we can't get everything in here
[1:10:19] we have to keep referring from place to
[1:10:21] place how
[1:10:22] it's going to be a terrible thing for
[1:10:25] those when the last trumpet sounds
[1:10:28] when the last battle is fought when the
[1:10:30] last sermon is preached
[1:10:33] when the last song is sung and we stand
[1:10:37] at the judgment seat of christ you're
[1:10:39] going to be asked why didn't you receive
[1:10:41] it
[1:10:42] what did you do with the life that i
[1:10:44] give you you'll be asked to give a
[1:10:46] reason
[1:10:47] what then you've heard me sing that song
[1:10:49] or try
[1:10:50] what then what then when that great book
[1:10:53] is open what then
[1:10:54] when the ones that reject the message
[1:10:56] will be asked to give a reason
[1:10:59] what then what is your excuse what will
[1:11:03] your
[1:11:03] reason be when you come to service after
[1:11:06] service
[1:11:07] and you hear the word you hear the
[1:11:10] warnings
[1:11:10] you hear about the throne room you hear
[1:11:12] that it's a throne that a king sits on
[1:11:15] it's a throne of judgment
[1:11:16] and it's only because there's blood on
[1:11:18] the throne there's mercy
[1:11:21] but it will not be mercy forever and
[1:11:24] when mercy runs out it runs out
[1:11:27] he was filthy filthy still
[1:11:30] he was holy holy still a snapshot
[1:11:33] taken of your life what will your excuse

[1:13:40] whenever the branham goes and i show you
[1:13:42] the church ages on earth

[1:13:51] brother branham is showing here what
[1:13:52] john was experiencing was actually long
[1:13:56] in the future
[1:13:58] and with the brand of us i'll see if we
[1:13:59] get to later on he said when
[1:14:01] in matthew 16 jesus said to his disciple
[1:14:04] there's some among you
[1:14:05] that will not see death until you see
[1:14:07] the son of man coming
[1:14:10] and then by matthew 17 peter james and
[1:14:13] john are there
[1:14:14] on mount transfiguration and jesus is
[1:14:16] standing there
[1:14:18] and then elijah comes and elijah and
[1:14:20] there's moses
[1:14:22] and moses is represented by the baron
[1:14:24] said for our day the six
[1:14:26] ages that went past the sleeping scenes
[1:14:29] and elijah is there representing the
[1:14:31] raptured sins
[1:14:33] and when they get the great revelation
[1:14:34] to build three tabernacles they only see
[1:14:39] [Music]
[1:14:41] we're in the jesus now this morning put
[1:14:44] on your spiritual hats this morning
[1:14:45] we're going somewhere
[1:14:47] john was standing there
[1:14:51] and when jesus told them what is it to
[1:14:54] thee if john
[1:14:57] would see me if i let him tarry until he
[1:15:00] sees me
[1:15:00] here it is said in revelation 4
[1:15:04] john is there seeing everything as a
[1:15:07] rehearsal
[1:15:08] he's seeing the whole thing played out
[1:15:10] in front of him he is seeing the church
[1:15:12] ages
[1:15:13] he is seeing the rapture he is seeing
[1:15:15] the judgment
[1:15:17] what an experience caught up
[1:15:20] into the mind of christ caught up into
[1:15:24] the spiritual realm
[1:15:25] to see everything unfold
[1:15:27] [Music]
[1:15:31] no wonder john could write to book a
[1:15:34] revelation the way he did
[1:15:45] whenever that voice speaks to you he's
[1:15:47] dramatizing when you hear the voice of
[1:15:49] god speak to you
[1:15:50] something happens oh did it happen to
[1:15:52] you like that it did to me
[1:15:55] but i said 31 years ago and i've never
[1:15:57] been the same since
[1:15:59] oh when he said come up to me all he
[1:16:01] that labor and heaven laid and i'll give
[1:16:03] you rest it changed me is that your
[1:16:05] testimony
[1:16:06] this morning
[1:16:06] [Applause]
[1:16:12] don't be satisfied friends we're just
[1:16:15] coming to church
[1:16:16] don't be satisfied with just one
[1:16:18] experience
[1:16:20] don't get satisfied with just one touch
[1:16:22] don't get satisfied with one
[1:16:24] healing there's more where that comes
[1:16:26] from there's
[1:16:27] more grace where that comes from there's
[1:16:29] more anointing
[1:16:30] there's more power there's more
[1:16:32] experiences
[1:16:34] and john immediately he was in the
[1:16:36] spirit friends you could never get
[1:16:38] anything
[1:16:38] unless you are in the spirit
[1:16:41] [Applause]
[1:16:45] and how do you get in the spirit you
[1:16:47] respond to that voice
[1:16:50] many times but the brandon would speak
[1:16:51] and it said respond
[1:16:53] he would say stand up claim your healing
[1:16:56] but you have to respond do something
[1:16:57] even if you don't understand respond
[1:17:00] it's a sign of response it's an action
[1:17:02] don't just sit there and say a nice
[1:17:04] service
[1:17:05] you can get nice services all over but
[1:17:07] when the word the voice of god comes to
[1:17:09] you with clarity
[1:17:10] and calls you from your sin and calls
[1:17:12] you from your past
[1:17:13] and calls you from your mistake let
[1:17:15] somebody say hallelujah
[1:17:16] that's me it has nothing to do with your
[1:17:20] feeling
[1:17:21] it has nothing to do with what happened
[1:17:22] to you but you are identified with the
[1:17:24] voice
[1:17:25] with that word of god concerning you
[1:17:30] the church say amen
[1:17:33] hallelujah remember the brahmana is
[1:17:36] dramatizing i want you to understand i
[1:17:37] want you to pick from this for your own
[1:17:39] walk
[1:17:40] god cannot but ibraheem said god will
[1:17:42] not come down to your level
[1:17:46] he said you have to come up to god's
[1:17:47] level and for you to climb higher you
[1:17:50] have to let go
[1:17:51] all the weights in your life that are
[1:17:53] keeping you down
[1:17:55] for some of us it's our job for some of
[1:17:57] us that were excuses someone says our
[1:17:59] past is whatever it is it doesn't matter
[1:18:01] what it is
[1:18:02] because each of us are different
[1:18:03] individuals you gotta know what it is in
[1:18:06] your life that's weighing you down
[1:18:08] and you gotta drop it today that you
[1:18:11] become so
[1:18:12] light that when the rapture comes
[1:18:14] there's no hindrance
[1:18:16] there's no obstacle there's nothing
[1:18:18] stopping you
[1:18:19] you are ready to go don't be so attached
[1:18:21] to your house to your car
[1:18:22] to your reputation to no because you
[1:18:25] want to go somewhere
[1:18:27] this world is destined to be destroyed
[1:18:30] heaven and earth will pass away
[1:18:31] [Applause]
[1:18:33] [Music]
[1:18:36] i john the same john as the one who saw
[1:18:38] that holy city
[1:18:42] that same john saw the earth saw the
[1:18:44] atmosphere being burnt up
[1:18:47] the same john we were talking about saw
[1:18:49] that new city coming into view
[1:18:52] that's him john saw tens and thousands
[1:18:54] time thousands
[1:18:55] of worshippers saying holy holy holy
[1:18:59] that same john saw the 24 ella's
[1:19:02] throw down their crowns that same son
[1:19:06] so behold the wild the life the wife of
[1:19:09] the lamb
[1:19:10] [Applause]
[1:19:14] hallelujah hallelujah so what are you
[1:19:17] saying preacher
[1:19:18] john he saw you yes
[1:19:21] yes he saw you he saw you he saw you in
[1:19:25] the rapture
[1:19:25] he saw you in the wedding supper he saw
[1:19:28] the things here after
[1:19:29] so shake yourself this morning and climb
[1:19:32] higher
[1:19:33] climb higher and give god praise because
[1:19:36] you are going to make it
[1:19:40] oh my oh glory
[1:19:44] you may be cheated i'm waiting to see
[1:19:46] that day
[1:19:47] for when the voice of god will speak to
[1:19:49] you and your testimony will be like john
[1:19:52] the moment i heard the voice immediately
[1:19:55] i was in the spirit
[1:19:56] there was nothing to stop me from being
[1:19:58] a hundred percent in the spirit
[1:20:00] i was 90 in the spirit but immediately
[1:20:03] i forgot everything else around me i
[1:20:05] don't know if john was working
[1:20:07] if he was walking if he was praying but
[1:20:09] when that voice called his name
[1:20:11] immediately he was in the spirit bring
[1:20:14] us
[1:20:14] that kind of a service where the voice
[1:20:17] of god
[1:20:18] the voice of the archangel where christ
[1:20:20] himself
[1:20:21] will speak to your heart and immediately
[1:20:24] you will be in the spirit
[1:20:25] [Applause]
[1:20:27] you may be seated and god could
[1:20:30] show you things because you'll never see
[1:20:34] it
[1:20:34] in your human spirit you'll never see it
[1:20:37] in your carnal walk
[1:20:38] you'll never see it if you're not in the
[1:20:39] spirit if you're not in a spirit it's
[1:20:41] just intellectual
[1:20:43] it's just another scripture there's
[1:20:44] another quote like most people in the
[1:20:46] message
[1:20:47] but when you're in the spirit all of a
[1:20:49] sudden you get a joy
[1:20:51] you get a peace you get an assurance up
[1:20:54] because this flesh is kind of
[1:20:56] this flesh is physical this flesh is
[1:20:58] natural
[1:20:59] but in the spirit it's your to your name
[1:21:01] it's who you really are
[1:21:03] there's no pain in the spirit there's no
[1:21:05] fear in the spirit
[1:21:07] there's no doubt in the spirit there's
[1:21:09] no sickness in the spirit
[1:21:11] there's no depression in the spirit it's
[1:21:13] your identification
[1:21:15] let us make man in our image in our
[1:21:18] likeness
[1:21:19] is back to genesis 1
[1:21:21] [Applause]
[1:21:25] hallelujah hallelujah you may be seated
[1:21:29] that's why when you're in the house of
[1:21:31] god and you're in the spirit
[1:21:33] you could have walked in here tired but
[1:21:35] when you're in the spirit
[1:21:36] all of a sudden you can't explain it the
[1:21:38] tiredness got to go
[1:21:40] because you are connecting to who you
[1:21:42] really are listen this morning
[1:21:44] you were not seeing me you were seeing a
[1:21:46] shell but inside of this shell
[1:21:48] is the real me made in the image of god
[1:21:52] i'm from the god class i'm a son of god
[1:21:55] angels are subject to my commander
[1:22:11] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:22:14] hallelujah you may be seated i'm not
[1:22:17] trying to work you up in the spirit no
[1:22:20] no no no no no no no it's a little
[1:22:22] higher than that this morning the word
[1:22:24] of god
[1:22:25] the voice must get you in the spirit the
[1:22:28] word has to get you in the spirit
[1:22:30] the pentecostals they just make a noise
[1:22:32] and in the spirit of what they're in
[1:22:34] this is different this is the word
[1:22:37] finally revealed
[1:22:38] they finally interpreted them food
[1:22:40] spiritual
[1:22:41] food rightly divided in due season
[1:22:44] christ himself the voice of the
[1:22:46] archangel speaking to your situation
[1:22:49] when you hear that voice immediately you
[1:22:52] get in the spirit
[1:22:54] [Applause]
[1:22:57] you may be seated hallelujah
[1:23:00] hallelujah you may be seated
[1:23:03] but i gotta explain something to you
[1:23:05] that's why i love about this
[1:23:06] because john is the type of the bride
[1:23:08] but john is also an individual
[1:23:10] god doesn't call the group we we we we
[1:23:13] know this we have been well taught
[1:23:15] god is not about a group is about
[1:23:16] individuals so it's all right
[1:23:18] if the person next to you hasn't heard
[1:23:21] it yet but if you hear it
[1:23:23] if you hear something this morning
[1:23:27] if you hear if you see your name this
[1:23:30] morning
[1:23:33] this is not between you and the pastor
[1:23:35] you and the minister
[1:23:37] you and the elder this is between you
[1:23:39] and god saying almighty god
[1:23:41] you me to tell me you put my name on the
[1:23:44] lamb's book of life
[1:23:46] in my wretched condition you saw me
[1:23:48] overcome
[1:23:49] you saw me in the rapture you saw my
[1:23:52] family
[1:23:53] you saw me filled with the holy ghost
[1:23:55] you saw me delivered
[1:23:56] you saw demons flying out of my life
[1:24:00] you saw the house of hell subject
[1:24:04] [Applause]
[1:24:10] no wonder when john saw his name he said
[1:24:13] all in heaven
[1:24:14] all on the earth even the devils under
[1:24:17] the earth
[1:24:18] heard me shout because i saw my name
[1:24:21] and because my name is written i can be
[1:24:23] redeemed
[1:24:24] because my name is written i can have
[1:24:26] power
[1:24:27] because my name is written i can receive
[1:24:30] the baptism
[1:24:31] of the holy ghost on fire
[1:24:48] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:24:51] hallelujah i pray that by the end of
[1:24:54] this service
[1:24:56] listen you may be seated for those of
[1:24:58] you who are
[1:24:59] battling with condemnation and your
[1:25:02] mistakes
[1:25:03] and your failures listen jesus
[1:25:06] when he started his ministry he saw
[1:25:08] peter
[1:25:09] he said come on
[1:25:15] and peter dropped everything and tried
[1:25:17] to follow
[1:25:20] he picked up andrew he picked up james
[1:25:24] even matthew the tax collector who the
[1:25:26] brothers had a challenge but he said
[1:25:27] come
[1:25:28] they looked at matthew and well all
[1:25:30] right if jesus is calling me got to be
[1:25:32] good
[1:25:32] because jesus is in the name calling
[1:25:34] business
[1:25:36] come come john himself was told to come
[1:25:40] but this call that john gets on the isle
[1:25:42] of patmos is not just a come

[1:26:25] scared of you brother mike
[1:26:27] he is trembling this morning because you
[1:26:29] are
[1:26:30] sons of god listen you may be seated
[1:26:36] [Applause]
[1:26:44] in the bible the syrians had a conundrum
[1:26:50] whenever they were discussing strategy
[1:26:53] on how to take out israel for some
[1:26:57] reason
[1:26:58] israel seemed to know what's going on
[1:27:02] in this secret war chambers of the king
[1:27:06] and brother sheen the king cannot
[1:27:08] understand
[1:27:10] because it was his inner circle he was
[1:27:12] talking to
[1:27:13] he knew these men for a long time
[1:27:16] and he couldn't believe that one of
[1:27:18] these men would sell him out of the
[1:27:19] israelites
[1:27:24] they launched a commission of inquiry
[1:27:26] and somehow they found
[1:27:28] out that there's a man in israel called
[1:27:30] elijah
[1:27:32] and this man had the ability to move
[1:27:34] through space and time
[1:27:37] because that's what prophets do
[1:27:39] [Applause]
[1:27:44] you maybe see that before the doctor's
[1:27:46] hand touches my wife the tumor
[1:27:48] will go down space is not an issue
[1:27:51] distance is not a problem
[1:27:53] sister hearty right i give you you are
[1:27:55] two boys
[1:27:56] why i'm a son of god i don't want to
[1:27:59] hear about the problem the trial the
[1:28:01] situation
[1:28:02] [Applause]
[1:28:04] you may be seated
[1:28:07] there's power here this morning you feel
[1:28:09] it right
[1:28:11] demons are trembling this morning
[1:28:14] we are back to devil in a corner this
[1:28:16] morning house of hell
[1:28:18] give way to the name of the lord jesus
[1:28:21] christ
[1:28:22] you may be seated so the assyrian and
[1:28:25] the syrian army
[1:28:26] they came to surround elijah and brother
[1:28:30] andrew he woke up that morning as
[1:28:31] is his custom maybe he's having
[1:28:33] breakfast and he has a little young boy
[1:28:35] named johazi
[1:28:38] and as this boy looks outside he sees
[1:28:40] the whole host of the army
[1:28:42] and he comes in panicking elijah elijah
[1:28:46] the enemy is around us and i can imagine
[1:28:49] elijah is doing an omelette
[1:28:51] and he takes his time and he flips the
[1:28:53] omelet
[1:28:55] in slow motion because he has nothing to
[1:28:59] fear
[1:29:00] you know many times in the bible jesus
[1:29:02] said fear not
[1:29:04] fear not even in the book in the new
[1:29:06] term he said for i am not giving you the
[1:29:08] spirit of fear
[1:29:09] but of adoption what are you afraid of
[1:29:14] you're afraid you're not going to get
[1:29:15] well forget about it you are going to be
[1:29:17] healed
[1:29:19] what what are you talking about
[1:29:22] you may be seated
[1:29:24] [Applause]
[1:29:30] it's something powerful when you watch a
[1:29:32] man who knows his position
[1:29:35] and knows his authority and knows what
[1:29:37] he's connected to
[1:29:40] and i can't imagine that that you maybe
[1:29:42] see that that little boy
[1:29:43] was wondering where is elijah getting
[1:29:45] this confidence from
[1:29:50] and elijah looked at that he said listen
[1:29:53] lord open up this boy's eyes and when
[1:29:56] this boy looked again the second time
[1:29:59] he said but wait a minute they are more
[1:30:02] for us
[1:30:04] than against us
[1:30:08] he may be seated i challenge you this
[1:30:11] morning
[1:30:12] to look at your situation for another
[1:30:15] time

[1:33:14] [Applause]
[1:33:18] hallelujah oh my oh my
[1:33:23] oh my you may be seated
[1:33:31] john had experienced many things
[1:33:36] john was a witness when jesus was
[1:33:40] preaching
[1:33:41] and the service ran kind of late for the
[1:33:43] benjamin it was longer than normal and
[1:33:45] by that time all the shops were closed
[1:33:48] high low was closed or messy stores or
[1:33:51] whatever it was was closed and
[1:33:52] jesus asked a question what we can't let
[1:33:55] the people go back hungry there no place
[1:33:56] is open it's too late to cook he said
[1:33:58] what do you have
[1:34:02] and i can imagine a deacon come and say
[1:34:04] listen jesus we have
[1:34:05] five loaves and two fishes
[1:34:08] and one of the anointed brothers say but
[1:34:10] what are these amongst openly
[1:34:16] jesus had an experience with those
[1:34:18] brothers
[1:34:19] they seen miracles and yet them brothers
[1:34:21] still they already catch
[1:34:23] really what's going on and jesus blessed
[1:34:25] it
[1:34:26] and yet tell him what would i be saying
[1:34:28] just share it
[1:34:29] i want to know the deacon who started
[1:34:31] sharing because he had the hardest job
[1:34:33] you know
[1:34:34] because he would have been looking at
[1:34:36] five loaves and two fishes
[1:34:38] seeing five thousand and telling himself
[1:34:41] how do i start
[1:34:43] to share this but could you imagine he
[1:34:46] takes one piece and break it
[1:34:48] and when he breaks it is like the peace
[1:34:50] come back he
[1:34:52] [Applause]
[1:34:59] could you imagine that experience
[1:35:02] [Applause]
[1:35:05] you may be seeing could you imagine
[1:35:08] peter and this and jesus just there just
[1:35:12] watching
[1:35:15] just watching john was there to
[1:35:18] experience that
[1:35:21] john was there on the boat when jesus
[1:35:23] was so
[1:35:24] tired the bible said that they carried
[1:35:27] him to the boat
[1:35:28] and in the original greek brother
[1:35:29] nathaniel that would carry
[1:35:31] meant to physically lift in other words
[1:35:34] the god of creation was so
[1:35:35] physically tired that he had to prop
[1:35:38] him up and literally carry him to the
[1:35:41] boat
[1:35:42] so tired was he that when the storms
[1:35:45] came
[1:35:46] he didn't even wake up
[1:35:47] [Applause]
[1:35:52] but yet when it became too hot to handle
[1:35:55] they decided the only
[1:35:56] option was to wake jesus
[1:36:01] john was there when he saw that
[1:36:08] john was there in the garden of
[1:36:09] gethsemane and he had fallen asleep with
[1:36:12] the rest
[1:36:13] of the brothers oh how he loved jesus
[1:36:17] and how jesus
[1:36:18] had loved him but within his own human
[1:36:20] frailty and his own human weakness and
[1:36:23] doing the very best that he could the
[1:36:25] very best that he could do was not even
[1:36:27] good enough
[1:36:28] and like the rest of brothers he fell
[1:36:31] asleep
[1:36:35] but john was also there when he saw the
[1:36:38] resurrected christ
[1:36:39] and for 40 days you see here jesus
[1:36:42] opened their understanding to the
[1:36:43] scriptures
[1:36:45] and he now possessed a clarity that he
[1:36:48] never had before
[1:36:49] because he had walked with jesus loved
[1:36:51] by jesus
[1:36:52] undoubtedly things would have been
[1:36:54] shared to him that only he was privy to
[1:36:58] and he was there in the upper room and
[1:36:59] the holy ghost poured out
[1:37:01] but i want to challenge you as great as
[1:37:04] all of that was there was no experience
[1:37:07] like when he heard the words come up
[1:37:09] either
[1:37:12] because for the first time he is able to
[1:37:14] go straight up into the mind of
[1:37:16] god because the bible said
[1:37:21] i want to read it carefully to you so
[1:37:24] you understand the context
[1:37:26] of what god allowed john to see
[1:37:30] to understand how deep it was
[1:37:34] come up hither and i will show you the
[1:37:36] things which must be hereafter
[1:37:39] and it's unfolding him things that ought
[1:37:41] to be
[1:37:45] things concerning the bride things
[1:37:48] concerning your walk with god and he has
[1:37:50] to
[1:37:50] hold all of that and watch it all
[1:37:54] unfold because god promised that
[1:37:56] somebody would see it
[1:37:58] and it's written in here in secret for
[1:38:00] us for such a time as this how blessed
[1:38:03] are we this morning friends
[1:38:06] so i want to challenge your friends as
[1:38:08] all of the experiences you have had
[1:38:10] in your journey to this day is nothing
[1:38:12] to be compared
[1:38:14] for that call to come up hither
[1:38:17] to hear that voice call you from this
[1:38:20] state into another state
[1:38:23] the rapture is on the inside and then
[1:38:25] what we have preached about becomes a
[1:38:26] reality to us
[1:38:28] that is mortal could put on immortality
[1:38:32] [Music]
[1:38:34] it sounds almost like a fairy tale but
[1:38:36] it's going to happen friends
[1:38:40] can the church see man can the lord give
[1:38:43] the lord a hand of praise
[1:38:45] [Applause]
[1:38:47] do you love the lord this morning do you
[1:38:49] love the word this morning
[1:38:51] you see how blessed we are
[1:38:53] [Applause]
[1:38:57] so i want to nail this down so you
[1:38:58] understand it clearly but ibraham in the
[1:39:00] same message revelation chapter 4
[1:39:02] part 1 chapter 1 25 oh and notice
[1:39:05] john being taken up immediately after
[1:39:08] the church it was a type
[1:39:10] of the rapture church immediately after
[1:39:13] the church age is over this leadership
[1:39:15] and church age
[1:39:16] then comes the rapture the church goes
[1:39:19] up like john did
[1:39:21] into the presence of god but if i said
[1:39:23] my
[1:39:25] that just wins my soul around caught up
[1:39:27] at the rapture of the church
[1:39:30] hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[1:39:33] lord
[1:39:34] i'm getting ready to wind up in a short
[1:39:37] while
[1:39:39] but the popper said no
[1:39:50] you know and in the same message but
[1:39:51] ibrahim said there's hope we don't run
[1:39:53] out of time too quick here now
[1:39:55] that we can get right into this
[1:39:59] and we want to see how that flows into
[1:40:00] the human being it's a beautiful story
[1:40:06] so the branham was given a type he said
[1:40:08] some time ago
[1:40:09] and he's given a story i want you to
[1:40:10] catch us now a bunch of ministers oral
[1:40:13] roberts was one of them
[1:40:14] cecil b demille when he wrote his ten
[1:40:16] commandments i'm sure we've all seen ten
[1:40:18] commandments
[1:40:19] he called up brother shakarian brother
[1:40:21] roberts many preachers across the land
[1:40:23] any preacher that could come and he
[1:40:25] invited them
[1:40:27] to come into the studio before the
[1:40:29] picture was ever released
[1:40:31] and let them see the rehearsal of it
[1:40:34] before it was ever showed out
[1:40:36] when they were charging twenty five
[1:40:38] dollars a ticket they see in the
[1:40:40] rehearsal of it
[1:40:42] that they might pass their opinion on
[1:40:44] whether there was any critics about it
[1:40:47] or what could be said and so forth
[1:40:49] they've seen it
[1:40:51] before the public could see it
[1:40:54] all right you catch that now so when the
[1:40:56] ten commandments is made cecily mill is
[1:40:58] finishing
[1:40:58] he doesn't want to show it to everybody
[1:41:00] unless he gets some support from the
[1:41:02] preachers of the day
[1:41:03] they say brothers come and look at this
[1:41:04] and tell me if you think this ten
[1:41:06] commandments really
[1:41:07] brings out the story of moses and the
[1:41:09] exodus and stuff
[1:41:10] and the brothers come and they see a
[1:41:12] rehearsal of what takes place
[1:41:15] before the public sees what takes place
[1:41:19] and brother brandon begins to connect
[1:41:21] this to john now
[1:41:22] so he said when jesus says some of you
[1:41:25] standing here will not taste that
[1:41:27] until you see the son of man coming he
[1:41:29] said what jesus was talking about
[1:41:31] is calling john aside and giving
[1:41:34] john a rehearsal of ten commandments or
[1:41:38] the unfolding of time
[1:41:40] before the pride was even here
[1:41:43] before the church it is even played out
[1:41:46] so
[1:41:46] john was seeing it for his hand
[1:41:50] to give according to what iran said to
[1:41:54] see if there's any critics or opinion or
[1:41:56] what is going to happen in other words
[1:41:57] to tell people
[1:41:58] you should go and see this thing man
[1:42:00] this thing end up good
[1:42:02] this thing is a good thing to see so
[1:42:04] john
[1:42:05] wrote out his testimony through the book
[1:42:08] of revelation
[1:42:09] of how good these things are that he saw
[1:42:11] when he was caught up
[1:42:14] and in there he sees everything
[1:42:15] including the spirit and the brides they
[1:42:17] come
[1:42:19] he sees and writes everything out and he
[1:42:22] shows how the devil is going to be
[1:42:23] destroyed
[1:42:24] he talks about a new city so what's our
[1:42:27] excuse
[1:42:28] that book of revelation has already
[1:42:30] happened in rehearsal
[1:42:33] the tape is already recorded it's only
[1:42:36] now
[1:42:37] there's no more editing to the table
[1:42:40] i don't think you catch i don't know
[1:42:41] there's no more the tape is finished
[1:42:44] but it's even it's if the movie is
[1:42:46] finished
[1:42:47] the only thing going on now is it's now
[1:42:49] playing in the correct timing
[1:42:52] but we know the end
[1:43:01] we already know the end of the story
[1:43:04] and that's why satan is mad
[1:43:08] because he can never change his part in
[1:43:10] the story
[1:43:11] and that's why you should be glad
[1:43:13] because nobody
[1:43:15] could take you out as a character in the
[1:43:18] story
[1:43:19] in that story you are shouting in that
[1:43:22] story by the terence there's no more
[1:43:24] arthritis
[1:43:24] [Applause]
[1:43:26] but a nickel in that story that foot has
[1:43:28] no more pain
[1:43:30] oh you don't hear me sister christine in
[1:43:32] that story
[1:43:33] those eyes open back up that's
