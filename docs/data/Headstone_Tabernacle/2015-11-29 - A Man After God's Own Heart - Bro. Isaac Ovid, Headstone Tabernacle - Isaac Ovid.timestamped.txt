[16:16] greetings from Germany and from Brother
[16:18] zigma Co and Brena and the church there
[16:20] in Autumn back they send their greetings
[16:21] to The Headstone Tabernacle it was
[16:23] really a blessing to be there in
[16:26] fellowship with them and we are under
[16:28] great expectation for what God is doing
[16:32] and what God is about to do amen we do
[16:34] have some visitors this morning uh
[16:36] Josiah punch and janica punch we' like
[16:39] to welcome you to The Headstone
[16:40] Tabernacle invited by Brother Bavon
[16:42] punch
[16:44] welcome and we also have amila jila
[16:47] Olivia Ramada I'm not sure who invited
[16:50] but I see a name here welcome
[16:53] welcome
[16:55] uh so everybody feeling fine amen
[16:59] everybody prayed up this morning
[17:01] everybody read the Bible this morning
[17:04] everybody is on fire this morning
[17:06] everybody have their swords drawn this
[17:08] morning everybody under expectation this
[17:10] morning everybody doing your part this
[17:13] morning because you know the preacher
[17:15] cannot bring a Revival it takes the
[17:17] people to be under expectation to bring
[17:19] a Revival so we are not here just to
[17:21] wait and bring food for you but there's
[17:23] some fresh killed meat and there's some
[17:25] killing to be done of some meat that we
[17:27] got to eat this morning
[17:28] but it's an army this morning and we
[17:30] want every Soldier to do their part we
[17:33] want every brother to take his place
[17:35] because that's the promise that's over
[17:36] us where every man take his place every
[17:39] husband take his place every wife take
[17:42] her place every son take his place every
[17:45] daughter take her place can the church
[17:47] say
[17:48] amen and it's such a thing you know
[17:50] there was a situation in Paris about two
[17:53] weeks ago with a terrorist attack and uh
[17:56] having to travel through Europe to
[17:59] obviously get to Germany going through
[18:01] the airports you see the heightened
[18:03] tension and the the checks and the
[18:05] double checks and the triple checks
[18:07] because men's hearts are failing for
[18:09] fear because man doesn't know what to
[18:12] expect but what is taking place is only
[18:14] scripture being fulfilled so the bride
[18:17] is never surprised the bride is never
[18:19] worried the bride is never concerned
[18:21] because all of this is the Fulfillment
[18:23] of Prophecy and what takes place outside
[18:25] the church is really not the sign for
[18:27] the church what takes place inside the
[18:30] church is what we are looking for
[18:31] because we are under expectation for the
[18:34] coming of the Lord make sure your
[18:37] expectation is for the coming of the
[18:39] Lord because you're going to get what
[18:41] you expect can the church say
[18:43] amen and as the time brother Kang is
[18:46] getting shorter the devil is going to do
[18:49] everything he can to keep you from your
[18:52] promise as the time gets closer he knows
[18:55] he doesn't have too much time left so
[18:57] he's going to do everything everything
[18:58] he can to take your joy to take your
[19:01] peace to mess with your prayer life to
[19:04] take away your time from the scripture
[19:06] to influence when you come to church and
[19:08] he's going to do all in his power and
[19:10] that's why we came here this morning to
[19:12] do all in our power to get ready because
[19:15] his wife hath made herself ready can the
[19:18] church say
[19:19] amen amen so I'm other expectation this
[19:23] morning for what God is going to do I
[19:25] really want to salute brother ID for the
[19:27] last three messes you appreciate those
[19:30] messages the passion to know the word
[19:34] the cry to get in the spirit and the
[19:36] fervent desire to please God that should
[19:40] be your
[19:41] identification a passion to know the
[19:43] word a cry there's always a cry in your
[19:46] soul to be in the spirit you can exist
[19:49] if you're out of the spirit you don't
[19:51] want to live if you're out of the spirit
[19:53] you want to be in the word and you want
[19:54] to be in the spirit and more than that
[19:57] you want to have a f desire to please
[19:59] God when you wake up in the morning you
[20:01] want to please God uh before you go to
[20:03] bed at night you want to please God when
[20:05] you on the job you want to please God
[20:08] not please the neighbor not please your
[20:10] coworker not please your boss not please
[20:12] the pastor not please the Elder but
[20:15] please God can the church say
[20:18] Amen you know and uh when I heard him
[20:20] preach the first message the passion to
[20:22] know the word the Lord dropped a message
[20:24] in my heart since that week and I told
[20:26] him I have something and then he told me
[20:28] he wanted to do a three-part Series so I
[20:30] said well God knows how to unfold
[20:32] everything because the thought I had I
[20:34] was like my is going to be really
[20:36] fitting to follow what he brought so I
[20:38] want to kind of touch on something this
[20:40] morning a bit of teaching a bit of
[20:42] talking a bit of preaching but I believe
[20:44] that the Lord has given me something and
[20:46] God is going to bless this morning so
[20:48] everybody feeling fine can we give the
[20:50] Lord a hand of Praise this
[20:56] morning you may be seeded so before I
[20:59] read a scripture I kind of want to
[21:01] introduce where I'm going this morning
[21:03] now every biblical character everyone in
[21:07] the Bible has a unique place a unique
[21:10] role a unique purpose for some the story
[21:14] of their lives will span decades and for
[21:17] others in the Bible their Ministry would
[21:20] have lasted for just a few
[21:21] hours with the limited ability of our
[21:25] minds to fully comprehend every aspect
[21:30] of what transpired in this fraction of
[21:33] Eternity we call time it is impossible
[21:36] for us to place one
[21:38] character above the other how do you
[21:41] compare the life of Abraham with the
[21:44] life of
[21:45] Noah how do you compare the life of Noah
[21:48] with the life of Jeremiah amen how do
[21:51] you compare the life of the mighty
[21:53] Prophet
[21:54] Elijah with Nathan how do you compare
[21:58] Samuel with Barack How do you even
[22:00] compare one to the other how do you
[22:02] compare the Prophet Elijah for example
[22:05] with Simon of
[22:07] sirene everyone knows the story of
[22:09] Elijah Elijah shut the heavens Elijah
[22:12] called for fire Elijah took his mantle
[22:15] and struck Elisha the impact of Elijah's
[22:18] Ministry was so great that Ahab asked
[22:21] are you the one that troubles
[22:23] Israel Elijah was just special he was
[22:26] just unique there was just something
[22:28] about Elijah his role was for many many
[22:31] years and the life and the spirit of
[22:34] Elijah was found on Elisha it could be
[22:37] found on John the Baptist and we know
[22:39] it's found on William Mariam brandham a
[22:41] 20th century Prophet so Elijah stands
[22:44] out as a special kind of a prophet as a
[22:46] special kind of a man but in this drama
[22:49] of God God has players and he has
[22:51] individuals for a specific reason and
[22:54] for specific time and for a specific
[22:56] purpose but that's Elijah Hallelujah but
[22:59] how do you compare the life of someone
[23:00] like Elijah with Simon of
[23:04] syene Simon of sirene is not a prophet
[23:08] there were no books written about Simon
[23:11] of sirene his name is not found in
[23:14] Hebrews 11 when Paul recounts the heroes
[23:17] of Fate but in God's Great
[23:20] drama Simon of sirene finds himself at a
[23:24] familiar place at a unique time he is
[23:28] not a Jew he is not a Roman he is from
[23:30] sirene but yet he finds himself in
[23:33] Jerusalem in the closing days of Jesus's
[23:36] Ministry his ministry was not for months
[23:39] or years or weeks Simon's Ministry would
[23:42] be for for a few moments the entire Old
[23:46] Testament was pointing to a messiah the
[23:49] entire New Testament would speak of a
[23:52] messiah and how he would change the
[23:54] world but Simon of sirene finds himself
[23:57] self in the middle of a crowd of people
[24:02] in the days just after the Feast of the
[24:04] Passover and he Witnesses people
[24:07] carrying
[24:09] crosses he is a witness in that day and
[24:12] time the Bible isn't tell us if he
[24:14] understood what was taking place but he
[24:16] found himself there in that day
[24:20] crucifixions were common in Jerusalem
[24:22] but this day was different amen among
[24:25] the men to be crucified was a man called
[24:28] Jesus a man who did nothing to deserve
[24:31] this amen a man without sin a man who
[24:34] had done no wrong but he found himself
[24:37] in the middle of a situation watching
[24:40] this drama unfold he watched This Man
[24:43] Called Jesus being bruised being
[24:45] battered being scarred being mocked tap
[24:48] being spit upon bruised tired and wary
[24:51] he watch this man no longer able to
[24:55] carry his cross amen amen and This Man
[24:59] Called Simon of sirene is commanded to
[25:02] take the cross from Jesus and to Bear
[25:05] the
[25:06] wait for him how precious is it to carry
[25:11] the cross of
[25:13] Jesus with the weight of sin on Jesus's
[25:16] shoulders what a blessing to carry his
[25:18] cross and we could go on and on talking
[25:21] about different characters in The Bible
[25:23] and the roles that they play but as
[25:25] every biblical character stepped forward
[25:28] they played their role in God's drama
[25:32] each one having their part each one
[25:34] having their place and everyone here you
[25:37] have your place in God's drama it might
[25:40] be for a few moments like Simon of
[25:42] sirene or it could be for years like
[25:44] Elijah but I know that this bride is
[25:46] Promised a short quick message that
[25:49] would shake the whole
[25:52] nation in God's Great drama he is moving
[25:55] all the pieces at the right time at the
[25:57] right moment to achieve his plan so
[26:00] don't think for a moment that you are
[26:02] here by accident that you are here by
[26:04] chance there's a purpose this morning
[26:06] for being here there's a purpose that
[26:08] God called you there's a purpose this
[26:10] message came to you somebody said
[26:13] [Applause]
[26:17] amen I'm saying all of that to build a
[26:19] background that it's it's impossible
[26:21] Amen to compare one to the other it's
[26:24] extremely difficult to compare one
[26:26] Prophet to another amen but yet of all
[26:29] the biblical characters in The Bible
[26:33] there is one character that has a unique
[26:38] distinction amen this distinction is not
[26:41] given to Elijah it's not given to Moses
[26:43] not given to Noah but this distinction
[26:46] and this description is called a
[26:49] man after my own
[26:53] heart in the whole of the
[26:55] Bible throughout all of history there's
[26:58] only one man who has the distinction of
[27:02] being described by God as a man after my
[27:05] own heart God spoke lip to air to Moses
[27:10] but this man I'm talking about this
[27:11] morning was a man that God looked at and
[27:14] said there's a man after my own heart
[27:19] and I believe this morning once more God
[27:21] will have men after his own heart
[27:25] somebody say Amen
[27:28] hallelujah hallelujah so by the grace of
[27:30] God this morning I want to speak on that
[27:33] thought this morning a man after God's
[27:38] Own Heart so shall we take our Bibles
[27:42] read one scripture from the book of Acts
[27:45] chapter 13 and reading verse 16 I want
[27:48] to thank the musicians in particular
[27:50] brother John Mark for taking up the
[27:52] challenge this morning oh bless you you
[27:54] appreciate brother John
[27:56] Mark
[28:02] am reading from
[28:05] Acts chapter 13 and reading from verse
[28:12] 16 then Paul stood up and beckoning with
[28:17] his hand said men of
[28:19] Israel and ye that fear God give
[28:23] audience the God of this people of
[28:26] Israel chose our fathers and exalted the
[28:30] people when they dwelt as strangers in
[28:33] the land of Egypt and with an high arm
[28:36] brought he them out of it and about the
[28:39] time of 40 years suffered he Their
[28:41] Manners in the wilderness and when he
[28:44] had destroyed Seven Nations in the land
[28:47] of Canaan he divided their land to them
[28:50] by lot and after that he gave unto them
[28:53] judges about the space of 450 years
[28:57] until until Samuel the
[28:59] prophet and afterward they desired a
[29:01] king and God gave unto them Saul the son
[29:05] of sis a man of the tribe of Benjamin by
[29:09] the space of 40 years and I like this
[29:12] and when he had removed
[29:15] him Saul was
[29:17] fired God fired Saul when he had removed
[29:21] him he raised up unto them David to be
[29:24] their King to whom also he gave
[29:27] testimony and said I have found David
[29:30] the son of Jesse a man after my own
[29:33] heart which shall fulfill all my will
[29:38] may the Lord add a blessing to the
[29:39] reading of his word can we pray one more
[29:41] time Heavenly Father Lord any man could
[29:44] read the scripture but it takes the Holy
[29:46] Spirit to bring it to life may you bring
[29:48] it to life this morning as a living
[29:50] reality for your people to go into
[29:53] action Lord may you bless the reading of
[29:55] the word bless the hearing of it may you
[29:57] you open the understanding of your
[29:59] people may you anoint me touch my vocal
[30:01] cords touch my weary body Lord May no
[30:04] flesh be Lord displayed this morning but
[30:07] may Spirit spoken words come from this
[30:10] sacred desk this morning Lord hide me
[30:12] behind calvary's cross and speak to your
[30:14] people in the precious name of Jesus
[30:16] Christ and the church says amen you may
[30:18] be seated amen amen amen
[30:22] [Music]
[30:25] hallelujah so for a title this morning a
[30:30] man after God's Own Heart and I'm going
[30:35] to take my time because I really want to
[30:37] drive a few things home this morning but
[30:41] our Story begins with as the scripture
[30:44] we read where Paul is reflecting on the
[30:46] history of of how they came to be in our
[30:49] story we find
[30:51] ourselves among the children of Israel
[30:54] they had seen all the works God took
[30:56] them out of Egypt God God blessed them
[30:58] but when you read the book of Samuel you
[31:00] find that the children of Israel were
[31:02] not
[31:03] satisfied with hearing from God they
[31:06] were not satisfied with hearing from the
[31:09] prophets and they looked internally they
[31:12] looked outside and they came to the
[31:15] prophet Samuel to the elders and say we
[31:17] want a king like the Philistines we want
[31:21] a king like the amalekites we want a man
[31:24] to rule us like these other tribes and
[31:27] Nations because talking to God we we
[31:30] really don't want to do that all the
[31:31] time we want to go to somebody my God
[31:35] Fallen man always looks to some man to
[31:38] guide them some man to lead him and God
[31:40] was pleased God was pleased with the way
[31:43] he had it before that's why he told
[31:45] Samuel they have not rejected you they
[31:48] have rejected me because I have sent my
[31:50] prophets to give the word of the Lord to
[31:52] my
[31:56] people So within the hearts of these
[31:58] people God say all right you want a king
[32:00] go find one and they looked and they had
[32:03] their election they had their voting
[32:04] they had their campaigning and they
[32:06] picked by their choice the man called
[32:09] Saul his resume looked good the school
[32:12] he went to was good his height was good
[32:16] his speech was good he was qualified for
[32:18] the job in their eyes but it was not
[32:21] God's choice it was man's choice and
[32:24] whenever man chooses man will make the
[32:26] wrong choice somebody say
[32:29] amen I don't think you got that whenever
[32:32] man chooses man will make the wrong
[32:35] choice because God has a will God has a
[32:38] way God has thoughts about everything
[32:40] and I want the thoughts of God I want
[32:42] the way of God I want the will of God
[32:45] somebody say
[32:49] amen God told Samuel don't stress about
[32:52] it don't worry about it they have not
[32:55] rejected you they have turned me upside
[32:58] down they have rejected me and there
[33:00] will be consequences and for 40 years
[33:03] Saul
[33:04] ruled 40 years and then the Bible said
[33:07] God removed him God took him out of
[33:10] office God moved him off the scene
[33:13] because God said I have found a better
[33:15] man now you have had your time to have
[33:18] your choice but I'm going to make a
[33:20] choice now and I have found a better man
[33:22] go to the house of Jesse a little
[33:25] village down somewhere and you will find
[33:27] my choice his name is not anywhere
[33:30] nobody knows about him he hasn't gone to
[33:33] school he doesn't have a degree he's not
[33:35] qualified but he is my
[33:39] choice oh you don't hear me this
[33:41] morning you may be seated but most
[33:44] importantly he's a man after my own
[33:47] heart there are people who are
[33:49] intellectually in the message but their
[33:52] heart is not of God we talking about a
[33:54] man after God's Own Heart am and God
[33:58] qualifies it Hallelujah he says which
[34:02] shall
[34:03] fulfill all my will so the designation
[34:07] the condition the link between those two
[34:09] statements is a man after my own heart
[34:13] who will fulfill all my will not his
[34:16] will not his ideas not his dreams not
[34:19] his Visions but my will oh somebody hear
[34:23] me this morning is there anybody in the
[34:25] house who wants a fulfill the will of
[34:30] God you may be
[34:32] seated you know what's hindering you
[34:35] amen your will that's right your belief
[34:38] your ideas your thoughts on the matter
[34:41] how you see things how you process
[34:44] things what you knew when you were a
[34:46] child when you all of that is what's
[34:49] hindering you but if you could shut your
[34:51] mind and shut your heart and shut your
[34:53] spirit to all that is you and TI out to
[34:57] yourself than the will of God it's
[34:59] something to get the will of God you may
[35:01] be
[35:02] seated is there anybody in the house
[35:04] this morning is there anybody in the
[35:06] church this morning the will of God is
[35:09] such a powerful thing that even Jesus
[35:11] when he walked on this Earth had to come
[35:14] face to face with a battle of wills you
[35:17] don't hear me this morning Jesus in The
[35:19] Garden of Gethsemane it wasn't his first
[35:21] time there Jesus was very often in the
[35:24] Garden of Gethsemane but the few days
[35:26] before he was crucified as he traversed
[35:29] that area once more he came face to face
[35:32] with Lord not my will but thy will be
[35:36] done because my will would not be to get
[35:39] pain not have trials not have testings
[35:42] not have situations but not my will he
[35:44] said father if it is possible let this
[35:47] come pass father if it is possible let
[35:50] this trial pass let this test pass let
[35:53] this situation pass but nonetheless not
[35:56] my will but I will be done give me a
[35:59] church with individuals seeking the will
[36:02] of God we'll turn this country upside
[36:05] down give me a church with people
[36:08] without their will without their
[36:10] ambition without their desires and watch
[36:13] God move on the scene somebody say
[36:16] [Applause]
[36:21] Amen you may be
[36:24] seated man's choice amen man's Choice
[36:29] that's why the fful ministry cannot be
[36:31] man's Choice it has to be God's choice
[36:35] because God told Samuel when he went by
[36:37] the house of Jesse he said forget how
[36:39] they look forget how they speak I'm not
[36:41] looking at the external countenance I'm
[36:44] not looking at their background I'm not
[36:45] looking at how long their resume David
[36:48] had no Ministry David was unknown David
[36:51] didn't even wasn't even make the cut to
[36:53] be in the
[36:55] army
[36:59] but that was God's choice that was God's
[37:02] choice and the enemy might be looking at
[37:04] you right now and say you are failed so
[37:05] many times you have no great testimony
[37:08] but that doesn't change the fact that
[37:10] you are God's choice the trial that you
[37:13] have doesn't change the fact that you
[37:15] are God's choice you don't hear me this
[37:18] morning when the lion came to David he
[37:21] may have wondered why this lion coming
[37:22] here there are other Shepherds there are
[37:24] other sheep pastures but David didn't
[37:27] know that he was God's choice and his
[37:29] trials his testings Was preparing him
[37:32] for kingship that he didn't know he was
[37:34] going to carry one tape his trials his
[37:37] testing Was preparing him for what his
[37:40] purpose was in life but he was too young
[37:43] to understand it he didn't have the
[37:45] experience to appreciate it and he
[37:47] didn't know because it had never
[37:49] happened
[37:50] before can the church say Amen you may
[37:53] be seated God give us some moment
[37:57] after your
[38:00] own
[38:02] heart
[38:03] Hall when we think about the life of
[38:07] David many things come to mind are you
[38:10] with me this morning can I take my time
[38:12] this
[38:13] morning hope you got a good rest last
[38:16] night because when we come to church we
[38:17] come to church as brother over said I
[38:18] was I was connected to the service in
[38:20] Germany you know I was connected but
[38:23] said I'mma talk about closing Co we
[38:24] still open and the Believers over there
[38:27] who were connected say
[38:30] what said he's not closing
[38:33] yet so we come and the doors are open
[38:35] right now we're not closing right
[38:37] now but when we think about the life of
[38:39] David many things come to
[38:42] mind the little Shepherd boy the
[38:45] musician amen being anointed by Samuel
[38:49] and as you read the book of Psalms you
[38:51] see every emotion
[38:55] imaginable being
[38:57] displayed joy peace
[39:01] frustration fear pain anger anguish
[39:06] grief desire sadness every emotion that
[39:11] somebody could experience is captured in
[39:13] the life of David look at Moses Elijah
[39:16] we have glimpses of their lives not
[39:19] David David grows up as it were before
[39:21] our eyes as a boy as a man his feeles
[39:23] his UPS his down and all the way to his
[39:25] entire tapestry of his life spans Samuel
[39:28] to the Book of Psalms written in the old
[39:30] and the New Testament speak about
[39:33] [Applause]
[39:35] davidl he grows up before our very eyes
[39:38] we see him as a Shepherd a hunter a
[39:41] warrior a general a king a poet a
[39:45] champion an outlaw a
[39:48] ladiesman a musician a prophet a worship
[39:51] leader an adulterer a murderer a brother
[39:55] a husband a son a parent a leader a hero
[39:59] a builder an ancestor of Jesus Christ
[40:02] and a man after God's Own
[40:05] [Applause]
[40:11] Heart despite his UPS his Downs his
[40:14] failures his frustration in Hebrews 11
[40:17] they don't speak about it he is numbered
[40:20] among the heroes of
[40:22] Fate what will your testimony be I'm
[40:25] telling you your ups and downs will not
[40:27] be remembered your failures will not be
[40:30] remembered what you did will not be
[40:32] remembered because it'll be put in a sea
[40:34] of forgetfulness there is nothing
[40:36] against you because you are the new
[40:39] Heroes of
[40:40] Faith men after God own
[40:47] heart can we have church this morning
[40:50] can we preach this morning can we enjoy
[40:53] the Lord this morning you may be seated
[40:57] so I want us to take a drive this
[40:59] morning with a Maron into the mind and
[41:01] heart of this man who had his heart like
[41:05] God you see it's difficult to really
[41:09] identify with
[41:10] Jesus because in your mind and heart
[41:13] he's Messiah Savior and you really as a
[41:16] human can relate to his
[41:19] experience the Bible says he didn't sin
[41:21] he was sented as we are but Jesus is
[41:23] still Jesus but Jesus left a secret for
[41:26] us
[41:26] he left an example to us after as a man
[41:29] after his own heart so when you feel
[41:32] frustrated there's no scripture of Jesus
[41:34] being
[41:35] frustrated but David he has
[41:38] frustration are you with me so David the
[41:42] shepherd the shepherd David says the
[41:45] Lord is my
[41:49] shepherd that is a profound statement
[41:52] because he knew what being a Shepherd
[41:53] was all about so with a deep and a
[41:56] reflective and internal understanding
[41:59] brother papular being a shepherd He said
[42:01] the Lord is my
[42:03] shepherd I shall not want because David
[42:06] had experienced taking care of the sheep
[42:07] and he made sure his sheep did not want
[42:11] can you ride with me this morning he
[42:13] leadth me beside the Still
[42:15] Waters when I need a rest he knows
[42:17] exactly where to carry me he leadth me
[42:19] beside the Still Water he restoreth my
[42:22] soul is there anybody needs a restoring
[42:25] of the Soul this
[42:28] morning you may be seated he leadth me
[42:32] in the path of righteousness for his
[42:35] name's sake it's not about me it's about
[42:37] him he will protect his name he will
[42:40] defend his name he
[42:45] said he may be seated maybe this is
[42:48] speaking to somebody this morning y
[42:50] though I walk through the valley of the
[42:52] shadow of death death all around me I
[42:55] will feil no evil that's how we got to
[42:57] speak in the morning in the middle of
[42:59] the
[43:00] day I will fear no evil for thou art
[43:04] with me what a comfort to know that thou
[43:06] art with me thy rod and thy staff they

[43:24] for you to prepare a table for you in
[43:27] the presence of your enemies so don't
[43:29] feel bad when you have enemies because
[43:32] God is waiting for the enemies to come
[43:33] around you to prepare a table for you in
[43:36] the
[43:37] presence as the young people would say

[45:15] me all the days of my life when I give
[45:18] up on God he's not going to give up on
[45:20] me because goodness and mercy will
[45:22] follow me when I think I can't make it

[51:22] me let us go into the house of the Lord
[51:27] aren't you happy you're in the house of
[51:28] the Lord this
[51:29] [Applause]
[51:34] morning hallelujah hallelujah so I
[51:37] encourage you this week spend some time
[51:39] in the Book of Psalms spend some time in
[51:42] the scriptures and be refreshed because
[51:44] that's what God wants you meditate on
[51:46] the word day and night and you will have
[51:50] good success so let's move on a
[51:54] bit talk about
[51:57] David some would say that David is most
[52:00] remembered for his encounter with
[52:04] Goliath for some it would be the
[52:06] definition of his greatest
[52:09] success for in the midst of a situation
[52:12] where the whole of Israel not like a
[52:13] house the whole of Israel was at
[52:17] pause no movement because we can't find
[52:20] any Minister any preacher any brother
[52:22] Elder Deacon truste help government to
[52:25] go and deal with this situation that the
[52:27] Philistines have brought about yes under
[52:29] the headship of this man called golad
[52:33] right Saul is still King and Saul is
[52:35] ready to give his daughter his money his
[52:38] house his left foot his right arm his
[52:39] cell phone anything to anybody who go
[52:41] and fight that
[52:43] man because sa man's choice is
[52:47] scared he wants nothing to do and this
[52:49] is the tallest
[52:50] man he was chosen because of his height
[52:52] one of his reason was his height and
[52:54] here he's tremlin saying take whoever
[52:57] whoever could fight that man let me know
[52:59] my daughter money title house Car Land
[53:02] cell phone you name
[53:05] it and here's this little Shepherd boy
[53:07] named David not in the Army not a
[53:10] soldier bringing food for his Brethren
[53:12] but the Bram said may have been
[53:15] raisins and he just happened to hear
[53:18] this cry from this man called Goliath
[53:21] send me a man to fight me and as he's
[53:23] walking I can imagine he didn't know
[53:25] what was going on he's like okay
[53:26] somebody going to go and then he nobody
[53:30] going I mean David has the greatest this
[53:33] is the army of Israel you know there's
[53:34] not no Palestine army or Egyptian Army
[53:36] this is Israel yes he didn't come to
[53:39] watch the fight he came to bring food as
[53:42] he's walking away he hears this cry look
[53:44] around somebody got to be nobody
[53:46] going and he ask the brother in back who
[53:49] is this uncircumcised Philistine yes how
[53:51] the Army pin
[53:53] now amen yeah he said let me go back and
[53:56] talk to Saul sa talking to
[53:59] anybody how does a Shepherd boy end up
[54:01] in the king's tent think about it this a
[54:03] big
[54:04] army Saul take anybody anybody come
[54:08] desperate so King David come and say
[54:10] well I think I can handle it he say well
[54:13] you're good enough enough take my armor
[54:14] take my shield take I had this the
[54:16] latest the latest one Tesla made this
[54:19] one this is the latest one all the solar
[54:21] powered everything David say I don't
[54:23] need that I need a slingshot and I need
[54:27] my God because when I was there with the
[54:29] Sheep nobody was watching me but a lion
[54:31] came and a beer came and I give it to
[54:34] them good because I know who my God is
[54:37] and he is my
[54:42] deliverer a
[54:44] man after God's Own
[54:46] Heart and we know the story David
[54:49] knocked out that
[54:51] giant but I want to talk about another
[54:54] Giant
[54:56] Hallelujah this giant called golad David
[54:59] conquered but in this life of this man
[55:01] called golad in his life of this man
[55:04] called David rather I want to talk a
[55:06] little bit about a giant he couldn't
[55:07] conquer
[55:09] yes because after his greatest
[55:12] Victory David also had to contend with
[55:15] his greatest defeat because as much as
[55:17] he was spiritual as as a singer there
[55:19] was a giant in his
[55:22] heart that led him to go after B
[55:25] yes and he couldn't
[55:27] conquer that
[55:29] giant because it took a greater power to
[55:33] overcome that
[55:34] giant than David had if David had the
[55:38] power at that time to overcome that
[55:41] giant we wouldn't need a mighty
[55:44] conqueror that's
[55:46] powerful so God through the tapestry of
[55:49] how he was unveiling things was creating
[55:51] these void to show there's a conqueror
[55:53] that will come that will overcome
[55:55] everything not just in the physical or
[55:57] the mind but in the body in the
[56:00] flesh
[56:03] hallelujah hallelujah there'll be a
[56:06] Christ that would come that David yes
[56:09] who would conquer and be the mighty
[56:11] conqueror the lust of the eyes the lust
[56:14] of the flesh the pride of life so that
[56:17] because he is the mighty conquerer we
[56:19] could also be more than
[56:22] conquerors so in the life of David being
[56:25] lived out huj he had to also show the
[56:27] need for a
[56:29] messiah I want you to understand this
[56:31] because many of us we try to do it on
[56:33] our own and but brandham said when he
[56:36] was preaching he say you can't do it huh
[56:39] or maybe you think you could do it he
[56:40] said that's right you can't do it it
[56:41] takes the Holy Ghost to give you the
[56:44] power to do it because if it's not the
[56:46] Holy Ghost it's your mind it's mental
[56:49] like people who go to the mountain and
[56:50] meditate and they block the world out
[56:52] and they're so focused they're watching
[56:53] a stone for like 82 hours
[56:56] to not think about anything else that's
[56:58] not what God want you to do he wants the
[57:00] Holy Ghost to be in the control tower of
[57:02] your
[57:05] heart Hallelujah and conquer the lust of
[57:07] the eyes conquer the lust of the flesh
[57:10] conquer the pride of life because he is
[57:11] living something
[57:13] out can the church say
[57:19] amen and after all David's ups and downs
[57:23] God looked beyond all that and says
[57:25] he will fulfill all my will when the
[57:28] devil thought he had David knocked out
[57:31] the will of God
[57:33] prevailed God wanted David to build the
[57:35] temple but David hand that so much blood
[57:38] he said no no no no no no no no no no
[57:40] Hallelujah but my will will be prevailed
[57:42] in your life and your son your seed
[57:45] Solomon he will he will build the temple
[57:48] through the prophet Nathan God told
[57:50] David in 2 Samuel and thine house and
[57:52] thy kingdom shall be established forever
[57:55] before thee thy Throne shall be
[57:56] established
[57:59] forever great King David and his Lon and
[58:02] his seed can the church say
[58:04] Amen Give the Lord a hand of Praise this
[58:16] morning so through the line of David as
[58:19] you read the scripture we come right
[58:21] down to
[58:23] Jesus but the brand message crisis the
[58:25] mystery of God reveal said he talking
[58:28] about Jesus is the principal theme of
[58:30] The Bible he was in the prophets he was
[58:33] in the Psalms he was in the history of
[58:35] the Bible the Bible is a prophetic book
[58:38] it's a historical book it's a book of
[58:39] love it's a book of songs it's a book of
[58:42] life and then there you find Christ he
[58:44] was in the prophets he was in the Psalms
[58:47] he was in the history he also in the
[58:50] Bible is the things that is to come amen
[58:53] that's why it's so important that we
[58:54] spend time in the scripture to know what
[58:56] our scripture is what does that make him
[58:58] then B said the same yesterday today and
[59:02] forever and we know that Jesus came with
[59:05] three
[59:07] titles Son of God Son of Man and Son of
[59:10] David that's how powerful that King
[59:13] David line is the very first sentence in
[59:18] the New Testament in Matthew 1:1 says
[59:20] the book of the generation of Jesus
[59:23] Christ the son of David the son of
[59:27] Abraham
[59:29] am and as you look through Matthew
[59:31] Matthew 1 to Tre to for see everything
[59:34] Jesus is going through by the time Jesus
[59:36] is healing and delivering the People by
[59:39] the time you reach Matthew 12 the people
[59:43] the the scripture says in Matthew 12:23
[59:45] and all the people were amazed and said
[59:47] is not this the son of
[59:50] David because all of the Jews were
[59:52] awaiting this son from the line of David
[59:55] who would be a deliverer who would be a
[59:57] messiah and d and Jesus was troubling
[1:00:00] the water so much to say is not this the
[1:00:01] son of David can the church say amen and
[1:00:06] I believe that God will have another
[1:00:08] Ministry another David's Ministry on the
[1:00:12] Earth again can the church say Amen what
[1:00:16] is that Ministry men after God's Own
[1:00:18] Heart on the earth and Christ himself
[1:00:21] that David leading this Army straight to
[1:00:23] the resurrection straight to the Rapture
[1:00:25] can the church say
[1:00:28] Amen in the message perfect strength by
[1:00:30] Perfect weakness but said that's what's
[1:00:32] the matter today God's got a lot of
[1:00:35] sheep that's gone astray the
[1:00:37] organization and things have stole them
[1:00:39] out brought them out into psychology God
[1:00:42] give us Davids with the word of God and
[1:00:45] the power of God to direct it when we go
[1:00:48] to meet these intellectual Giants give
[1:00:51] me the word of God and the power of the
[1:00:53] Holy Ghost and and I tell you we can
[1:00:55] slay every Giant in the field can the
[1:00:58] church say amen that's what I'm looking
[1:01:00] for the word of God and the power of the
[1:01:02] Holy Ghost we need Dynamics and we need
[1:01:05] mechanics we need that same Jesus that
[1:01:09] David the stand and Lead his army can
[1:01:11] the church say
[1:01:12] [Applause]
[1:01:14] Amen Oh My
[1:01:17] My My and brother Bram saids in the same
[1:01:20] message and today we know we need a
[1:01:22] Revival we know we need a stirring
[1:01:25] amongst the people it will not take a
[1:01:27] doctor of divinity it'll take a week he
[1:01:30] talking about Hallelujah that'll take
[1:01:32] the word of God with weak people that'll
[1:01:34] take the word of God in the power of the
[1:01:36] resurrection of Christ and slay this
[1:01:39] thing it'll bring Christ to the country
[1:01:42] and let them see that he can still Open
[1:01:44] the Eyes of the blind he can still heal
[1:01:47] the sick he can still raise the dead he
[1:01:49] is God conqueror we need a David
[1:01:52] untrained in the theological School RS
[1:01:55] we need a man who knows nothing about
[1:01:57] that some little plow boy or something
[1:02:00] some little guy with his stoop shoulders

[1:07:50] hallu I feel religious but B said I he
[1:07:54] religious positionally in Christ he said
[1:07:57] if the believer know his position he'd
[1:07:59] have it oh let me say that again if a
[1:08:01] Believer know his position he'd have it
[1:08:04] David knew his position his faith was
[1:08:07] not based on Saul his faith wasn't based
[1:08:09] on Jesse his father his faith was based
[1:08:11] on a living God who delivered him so you
[1:08:14] may not be where you're supposed to be
[1:08:16] but once you're not where you used to be
[1:08:19] it was God who took you from where you
[1:08:21] were to where you are now that's enough
[1:08:24] of a reason to
[1:08:25] shout because you couldn't bring
[1:08:28] yourself anywhere you couldn't even come
[1:08:30] to church this morning if the Lord
[1:08:32] didn't call you so once you have a
[1:08:34] testimony and know you're not where
[1:08:36] you're supposed to be but if you're not
[1:08:38] where you're used to be then you begin
[1:08:39] to shout if you're not where you used to
[1:08:41] be you could worship because he took me
[1:08:44] out of the Mary clay he put my foot on a
[1:08:48] roor
[1:08:50] state and the Bible says he who started
[1:08:53] the work in you is able more than aable
[1:08:56] to complete it because he's the auor and
[1:08:59] he's the finisher he's the alpha he is
[1:09:02] the Omega he is the beginning he is the
[1:09:05] end he is the first he is the last he is
[1:09:08] that David he is the Messiah he is the
[1:09:11] Redeemer he is the
[1:09:15] savior the mighty
[1:09:18] conqueror sickness has to listen doubt
[1:09:21] has to listen your son has to listen
[1:09:23] your daughter has to listen that demon
[1:09:26] has got to go because when he speaks
[1:09:28] every knee will bow every tongue will
[1:09:31] confess there's no name higher than the
[1:09:33] name of the Lord
[1:09:35] [Applause]
[1:09:48] Jesus you may be seated but the brandom
[1:09:51] said I want to see that again if the
[1:09:53] believer
[1:09:54] know his position he'd have it you have
[1:09:58] to know your position because your
[1:10:01] position means you have to conduct
[1:10:03] yourself a certain way if your father is
[1:10:06] the king you have to conduct yourself
[1:10:08] like your father is the king in fact in
[1:10:10] the Royal house if you study the house
[1:10:13] of the the the in England the queen and
[1:10:15] the family when Kate had to marry Prince
[1:10:18] Prince whatever her name was William
[1:10:21] right they had to take her to a certain
[1:10:23] train
[1:10:24] because she had never lived in the house
[1:10:26] before you have to know how to walk how
[1:10:29] to talk how to dress who is in charge of
[1:10:32] which Duke Dom and which kingdom and
[1:10:34] which which section and know them my
[1:10:36] name because you can appear to not know
[1:10:38] who's the Earl of nothing ham or the
[1:10:40] Duke of Rochester or whatever you got to
[1:10:42] know so God is taking us through some
[1:10:44] training this morning because we are
[1:10:46] sons of the king and you got to know who
[1:10:48] you are you got to know your position
[1:10:50] you got to know what powers you have so
[1:10:52] when the enemy comes so you you don't
[1:10:54] need to get permission to send a blood
[1:10:56] hound after your son you know you have
[1:10:58] access to the throne you know all that
[1:11:00] the father has given must come you know

[1:11:07] bounding Bound in heaven whenever you
[1:11:09] loose on Earth loose in heaven you just
[1:11:12] have to speak because if you shall say
[1:11:15] to this mountain be moved and don't
[1:11:17] doubt you're going to have it when you
[1:11:19] know your position all of a sudden your

[1:18:24] maintain Christ you may be
[1:18:27] seated you see what made David unique he
[1:18:30] had a
[1:18:32] relationship with God and that's what's
[1:18:35] missing in the church today people have
[1:18:39] relationships with one another they want
[1:18:42] to call the pastor they want to
[1:18:43] fellowship with a brother but there's no
[1:18:45] relationship with God David didn't go
[1:18:48] and talk to Saul about his problems he
[1:18:50] went to the Lord about it prise God and
[1:18:53] that's why we need to talk to the Lord
[1:18:55] about
[1:18:57] it Hall you may be seated do you
[1:19:00] understand that the role and I said this
[1:19:02] in Germany last Sunday the fivefold
[1:19:05] Ministries role is limited because it's
[1:19:07] until we all come to the unity of the
[1:19:09] faith there a condition so there'll come
[1:19:11] a time when we'll all come to the unity
[1:19:13] of the
[1:19:15] faith so I'm just here to point point
[1:19:17] you and when you connect with God that's
[1:19:18] it you
[1:19:19] [Applause]
[1:19:21] know amen I'm not trying to keep you
[1:19:24] tired and come and no there come a time
[1:19:26] when there's my spirit flowing in phly
[1:19:28] how I could get between my spirit flu in
[1:19:30] Philly between you and God say Lord let
[1:19:32] me tell I want to make a break in the
[1:19:34] connection I want to connect in that
[1:19:35] line to no you connected to your father
[1:19:38] he's your father I'm not your
[1:19:42] father that's right that's why the Bible
[1:19:44] say call no man father you I I can be
[1:19:48] your father really
[1:19:51] Hallelujah he is your father father he
[1:19:53] is your lord he is your king he's your
[1:19:56] Redeemer it's just through the
[1:19:58] foolishness of preaching we are pointing
[1:20:00] you back to home back to your father
[1:20:03] back to our homecoming because like the
[1:20:05] prodigal son he's looking out for you a
[1:20:07] long time ago you walked away did your
[1:20:09] own thing and God set up a whole system
[1:20:12] waiting for you to come back waiting for
[1:20:13] you to come back home you forgot you had
[1:20:16] spiritual Amnesia you forgot you were

[1:20:49] the Lord in prayer do you have a perfect
[1:20:51] body a perfect perect Joy I can't wait
[1:20:54] to talk to David myself for him to
[1:20:56] explain what he was going through I
[1:20:57] could only understand a fraction of it
[1:20:59] but the one thing I know he was just
[1:21:01] like me he was just like me with his
[1:21:03] struggles is up and down and if God
[1:21:05] could deliver him he could deliver me if
[1:21:07] God could save him he could save me if
[1:21:09] God could restore him he could restore
[1:21:12] me and he was a man after God's own
[1:21:19] house
[1:21:20] Hall hallah
[1:21:26] M you may be see well you know me I'm
[1:21:28] not I'm not too long of a Preacher amen

[1:22:04] is my prayer so close till I can just
[1:22:07] feel it with my hands almost look it's
[1:22:09] right there that's where the Bram
[1:22:12] gesturing but the Bram was looking for
[1:22:14] sun but God didn't let him see it
[1:22:15] because he took him
[1:22:17] home and then he goes on that's what
[1:22:19] I've longed to see waiting for the time
[1:22:21] when walk down the street there lays a
[1:22:23] laying there from his mother's
[1:22:25] womb Silver and Gold Have I None oh
[1:22:28] waiting for the
[1:22:30] manifestations of the sons of God that's
[1:22:33] what this is about it's about a reality
[1:22:34] not being in the message not coming to
[1:22:36] the church but a living reality of the
[1:22:39] Living God when God but the will make
[1:22:42] himself known when they'll stop sickness
[1:22:45] when they'll stop cancer when they stop
[1:22:48] diseases but the B said right now we lay
[1:22:51] hands on the sick but in that time when
[1:22:55] that David is leading his people we will
[1:22:57] command the demons to
[1:22:59] leave no more pray in the name of Jesus
[1:23:02] if devil get out cancer get out can the
[1:23:06] church say Amen brother I long to see
[1:23:08] that day I'm looking for that day is
[1:23:10] there anybody looking for that
[1:23:14] day Hallelujah Lazarus was dead

[1:23:24] what about your
[1:23:25] son what about your daughter you don't
[1:23:28] think God could speak a word and bring
[1:23:31] them back is anything too hard for the
[1:23:34] Lord say at the appointed time I will
[1:23:37] return unto you according to the time of
[1:23:39] life and you're going to see your son
[1:23:41] come back your daughter come back your

[1:23:57] lived voice that humility sweetness
[1:24:00] forgiveness brotherly love it's still
[1:24:02] the same message it doesn't change it's
[1:24:04] the same gospel can the church say
[1:24:08] amenah I'm beginning to wind now the
[1:24:10] prophet introduced Messiah Hallelujah he
[1:24:13] introduced that David he introduced the
[1:24:15] deliverer He restored back the Fate he
[1:24:17] revealed every mystery and left us with
[1:24:20] a promise of Dynamics right but we have
[1:24:22] got to take the land and we know it's a
[1:24:25] good land we have the evidence of that
[1:24:27] land we have been living by the evidence
[1:24:30] of the new land the son of man and I
[1:24:33] believe the time has come the season has
[1:24:35] changed and the hour is upon us for
[1:24:37] David's but the said to step up we need
[1:24:40] these Davids to step up and take their
[1:24:42] position Satan told he could stop this
[1:24:45] he could stop this Mighty Revival but
[1:24:47] it's too late the Seven Seals seven T

[1:25:27] preacher his for knowledge not he that
[1:25:30] will it or he that run it it's God that
[1:25:32] show it Mercy that's right

[1:25:37] just like he knew what was in David he
[1:25:39] knew what was in you before you even

[1:27:22] a version of his word and listen and
[1:27:26] through them and by them will be
[1:27:29] fulfilled all that was promised for his
[1:27:32] word in the Virgin now that does does
[1:27:34] that sound familiar through them and by
[1:27:37] them will be fulfilled all wasn't that
[1:27:40] was what was said of David a man after
[1:27:43] my own heart he will do all of my will
[1:27:47] and then brother brandham is saying a
[1:27:48] bride a virgin through them and by them
[1:27:51] will be fulfill all that was promised so
[1:27:54] that Ministry that David had will be a
[1:27:57] Ministry that the bride will have
[1:27:58] because she will have that nature to
[1:28:01] fulfill all of God's will so wait a
[1:28:03] minute all these years God has been
[1:28:06] waiting for somebody to come into the
[1:28:07] scene who could be so surrendered to him
[1:28:11] that they could do all of his will all
[1:28:13] of his plans and through that people

[1:28:23] fire through that people the world once
