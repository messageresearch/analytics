with you this morning could you turn your Bibles to St John 15 just for a few moments before he comes I want to go back into the scripture St John 15 we want to read verse 1 to8 want to read verse 16 and also verse 26 I am this is Jesus speaking this is in red I am the True Vine and my father is the husband man every branch in me that beareth not fruit he take it away and every branch that beareth fruit he Purge it it that it may bring forth more fruit now you are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you abide in me and I in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can ye except he abide in me I am the vine ye are the branches he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringing forth much fruit for without me he can do nothing if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is withered men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burn if he abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you herein is my father glorified that ye bear much fruit so shall he be my disciples verse 16 we read ye have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordain you that he should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain and whatsoever he shall ask of the father in my name he may give it you verse 26 and 27 but when the comforter is come whom I will send unto you from the father even the spirit of Truth which proceeded from the father he shall testify of me and ye shall bear witness because you have been with me from the beginning let's pray father we thank you for your word bless it interpreted our hearts and may this have a lifechanging effect power in the people's lives in Jesus name we ask amen you may be seated oh praise the Lord hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord oh praise be to jesusall hallelujah oh my I like when Jesus speaks because Jesus doesn't speak church talk Jesus speaks Kingdom talk and one thing you can get from Christ is the truth not psychology not mamy you know not old talk but what you get from Christ is the truth because he said You shall know the truth and the truth is what's going to set you free amen isn't that right yes sir now let's just look at this closely before the speaker comes this morning he said every branch in me not out of meall now we come down to the tie the road now every branch in me that beareth not fruit he take it away amen that Branch will have a testim money I once was connected to the vine that Branch will have a history of going to church but if it don't bear fruit he said not I said not the Pastor said it he said I'm going to cut it off amen so God is interested in fruit bearing Hallelujah say it aloud fruit bearing Bear say it again fruit bearing bear God is not interested in leaves and there branches and you being dear he he he make a connection that you could bear something how many can say Amen to that this has nothing to do with joining church this have to do with genuine Christianity I am the vine and you are the branch I need you to produce from me Hallelujah without me you can't do anything so don't think you're going to run away and leave me and have your own business and your own job and your family and everything going fine with you and you cut me off no you're going to dry up you're going to die and still say you are Christian so he is being PL he is being rugged he is being gutsy he say you're going to produce and if you're only bring for of fruit I'm going to purge you Hallelujah I'm not hearing you you better say amen and every word that we preach this morning he didn't see for fruit he could bring a basket a a bucket that Kentucky F chicken for you he didn't say that he said I'm going to purge you in order for you to bring more fruit Oh Glory Hallelujah Oh Glory do you love him this morning Hallelujah he like a nice Branch he ni like leaves but he want fruit let's look at verse 16 again he have you have not chosen me he the purpose I have chosen you and ordain you that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain hallelujah oh go hallelujah hallelujah can we give the Lord a shout Hall in the Amplified he these words you have not chosen me but I have chosen you I have appointed you I have planted you that you might go and bear fruit and keep on bearing and that your fruit may be lasting that it may remain and abide so that whatever you ask the father in my name as presenting all that I am he may give it to you Hallelujah every branch in me how you get into him by one Spirit you're baptized into him then you're in him he's glad for you to be in him but in him you have to start to bring forth fruit and he's not wasting time he don't bring forth fruit he cut it off you still have a testimony still wear your tie still wear your dress but you're not you get cut off a lot of preachers get cut off Hallelujah still in the Pulpit but cut off ret trenched by God but cut off like Saul amen hallelujah amen so you don't want a last year experience you want a no experience you don't want to know a last year God you want to know he's the same yesterday today and forever Hallelujah you want that God to be present tense shout out present tense that's the god you need hallu more fruit he purges to bring more fruit amen and that more fruit is from in 2 Peter 1: 14-7 that's it after to your fith virtue knowledge Temperance patience what what what you doing more fruit God brotherly all this is the word now brotherly kindness is the word forgiveness is the word it's not a feeling a fe I feel to forgive this one that's not that's not the word amen I feel no no no take your feelings and throw it out as your feelings come just take it and throw it out say you feeling to praise God throw it out you feeling to serve God throw it out you feeling to shout this morning show that out too your children's miserable year feel to pray for them show that feeling out pray because they going be delivered because God answers prayer and prayer changes things and if Prayer Changes Things don't stop praying you see a lot of people and churches get away from the moins of genuine Christianity they are drifting in religious things you could live your entire life without Christ have a job have big business have money buy car house everybody heal you out you feel your somebody because you have some change in your pocket but one day you have to meet that God and it's not the abundance of what you have or what your family have or what you think you have is what you have done for the kingdom of God because we belong to a kingdom Hallelujah and you supposed to be representative of the king not of your family not of your loved ones but of the king that is why by one Spirit we all have to be baptized because we come from different countries different people different color and everything else but one spirit is what correct all of that could we give the Lord a shout I didn't choose my mother I didn't choose my father I didn't choose my color I didn't choose my race but guess what God said I have not you have not chosen me but I have chosen you you better shout right now in your present circumstance in your present condition in your present situation right now begin to thank the Lord Glory H Hallelujah Glory hallelu if I had a husband forget that if I had a different husband forget that if I had a different woman as my wife forget all of that all things work together for good to them that love God to them what he called according to his purpose called according to his purpose for who he for and he called who he called he justified who he justified he had already glorified give the devil a kick this day kick him out kick him out kick him out kick him out hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so as soon as God see fruit he said good it coming on bring the shares clips clips clips clips clips clips clips clip soon as he sees fruit coming he said bring the knife and me cut them clip clip I'm going to prune you prune you here prune your desire here prune your ambition here prune this here prune oh give the Lord a sorry be see get excited so just a point to we have had a a a a church ages gone past we had a lot of people join church members and different thing like that and is unfortunate but fortunately God not interested in church membership what God interested in his sunship so all the people who love church um God not really interested in that your love for church and love for pastor and look for the church God not in that the whole creation happen to be groaning right now they they have belly pain they're groaning they're not feeling comfortable they bong for too long they're under pressure they're looking for sons of God to come forth not little children not not dumb sheep like they don't know who they are no no no no no no there's going a 5old Ministry till we all come to the unity of the faith to the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ that you be no more children coming to a spot where no man have to teach you but the Holy Ghost after all these years I'm almost done I'm almost done I'm almost done you may be seated you know come to the spot like when Spirit Jesus when he got the holy ghost in the fullness the Holy Ghost led him by the spirit Into the Wilderness notice Jesus said Lord is that you Hallelujah come on now when you see Wilderness you say Lord is that you I didn't sign up for Wilderness I sign up for the lake I sign up for Beats front house but the Wilderness is to make sure sure you have power over self before he give you power over others and other things Wilderness is to overcome lust of the eyes lust of the Flesh and the pride of life only Wilderness could do that do I hear shout in the house see somebody see some people holding MTH you're thinking about it about if they say Amen or not sorry we can't preach it out to you it's an experience that you have to go through Oh Glory to God how how could job say I know my redeemer live it and he have been through nothing you got to go through stuff you got to go through hell you got to go through all kind of darkness and gloominess and disappointments and heartache and the house fall down you lost your pay and your husband sick and dis happen and that happen and and and you come to a spot where you said don't he slay me yet I'll trust him oh hallelujah praise God hallelujah how the devil can handle a man like that that man don't care he only care about God he only care about the will of God the purpose of God that's your objective that's your motive that's your desire that's your a may the Lord bless you oh let's stand and give the Lord a shout you may be seated I reach the end of the page so don't worry turn head there's nothing but don't let nothing fool you hallelujah hallelujah fruit amen then he say here it is my father glorified that you get bear much fruit fruit more fruit we hit to brotherly kindness and then charity comes down to produce much fruit charity is the much fruit virtue so you have to abide in the word to abide in the vine some have left their Vine and abide in their emotion yes some left the vine and abide with their family they have a little small circle but remember this he didn't you didn't choose him he choose you and that's why when you come to church you should come with such a grateful heart with such a humble heart because Millions were lost when you were saved God God bypass Millions to find you and it's a stinking shame the level of arrogance so-called Christians just want to pedal and push with a level of pride and arrogance and self-righteousness that is really Antichrist anti- God and anti every principle of Christianity that God put in his word because God love constrain him to come down to us hallelujah to give us the real thing cuz we need help you can't play your reach somewhere which where amen amen yes the wheels about to turn am the devil is about to turn up the heat you have to get fireproof because Ready or Not the heat is coming ready or not Goliath coming ready or not everything that the prophet prophesy it's coming so brother Isaac we have to turn up the heat in the church amen they have been in um warm for too long warm water doesn't do much you know but when the water start to boil it could produce Steam and steam does run engines Hallelujah warm doesn't get you very far either you're hot or you're cold if you're hot you get it boiling Hallelujah something can move when you're getting hot but if you only stay warm that's not good enough am oh let's all stand and sing all over the world the spirit is moving as our servants come to us this morning all over the world the of the coming of the Lord as the wers one more time all over the world all over the world the spirit is moving all over the world as God's Prophet said it would be oh over the world there's a mighty revelation of the coming of the Lord as the waters cover the sea oh deep down in my heart the spirit is moving oh deep down in my heart oh as the prophet said it would be Hallelujah deep down in my heart there's a mighty revelation of the coming as the waters cover the sea may the Lord bless you this morning can we give the Lord a shout of Praise In The House of the Lord are you happy to be in his presence this morning to be Under The Canopy of life under the shelter of the almighty on a blessed Sunday morning Hallelujah he has come down for Fellowship he has come now to talk with you he he wants to hear from you this morning and we are here to hear from him may the Lord bless you this morning so I greet you this morning in the precious name of Jesus Christ you appreciate our pastor this morning Hallelujah he could have kept on preaching you could always keep on preaching amen amen amen you appreciate by the Joshua and the song service the musicians this morning amen you appreciate by the Anthony and the special this morning amen amen amen amen well I'm under great expectation I certainly want to appreciate brother the over for the message last Sunday Messiah how many were blessed last week amen and we had a tremendous time in maraval on Tuesday night and I heard a tremendous report of the Thursday night service so we're looking for God to continue to do great things among us can the church say Amen so i' like to go straight to the word this morning reading from the book of St Luke chapter 14 I'm reading from verse 16 St Luke 14 I'm reading from verse 16 then said he unto him a certain man made a great supper and B many and sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden come for all things are now ready and they all with one consent began to make excuse the first said unto him I have bought a piece of ground and I must needs go and see it I pray thee have me excused and another said I have bought five yolk of oxen and I go to prove them I pray thee have me excused and another said I have married a wife and therefore I cannot come so that servant came and showed his Lord these things and then the master of the house being angry said to his servant go out quickly into the streets and Lanes of the city and bring in Heather the poor and the memed and the Halt and the Blind and the servant said Lord it is done as thou Hast commanded and yet there is room and the Lord said unto the servant go out into the highways and hedges and compel them to come in that my house may be filled for I say unto you that none of those men which were bidden shall taste of my supper can we bow our heads in a word of prayer Heavenly Father we approach your throne of grace Lord having read the Holy scriptures father we know the scriptures are anointed we know this message of Malachi 4 is Anointed and Lord we know that you are here right now to break every yoke to break every chain Lord I pray you bless the reading of the word may you walk out the pages of the Bible today Father father we unite in faith father under great expectation to hear a word from you this morning Lord we are not here to hear from man we are not here to Lord just to see each other but we come for an experience with a pillar of fire May you take complete control today over every life over every situation over every condition Lord if there's anyone sick in our midst may you touch them is there a backslide in the house may you restore them Father we Lord take Lord every Spirit under our control this morning for the glory and honor of almighty God we welcome the angel of the Lord in the house this morning and Lord we pray that you Break Every Chain Break Every shackle Lord we bind the works of darkness this morning we bind tiredness we bind fear we bind frustration we bind Lord the past we bind our mistakes we bind yesterday father we bind every unclean spirit this morning Father we make way for the Holy Ghost this morning Father we shake ourselves this morning from our lethargy we shake ourselves Lord to get into action Lord Lord may you walk out the pages of the Bible and Lord as you walked in Bethlehem and walked in Jerusalem and walked in Bethany may you walk through this Tabernacle this morning may you go from person to person father and may they get a personal experience this morning with a pillar of fire that they'll never be the same again father Lord may you break away Lord Lord everything from us that does not belong may you perform spiritual surgery this morning Lord May the people know that no weapon formed against them could ever Prosper may they catch a revelation this morning that they are born for such a time as this may they catch a revelation that sickness is nothing in the eyes of God may they catch a revelation that the conditions may be bad but it's going to get better because there's power in the Church of the Living God over every sickness every disease uh there's no tiredness can stop us there's no sickness there's no doubt there's nothing shall separate us from the love of God we come here this morning to give the glory to give worship may you get the glory this morning may you get the honor this morning may you get the praise this morning Lord you didn't have to do it but you did we thank you that this morning you see us through the blood we thank you for the blood this morning we thank you that there's power in the blood we thank you that there's an anointing in the house this morning we thank you for the P of fire that's already here this morning we thank you Father oh God for what they've already done and what you're about to do may you bless the service this morning and we commit into your hands in the precious name of Jesus Christ and the church says and the church says and the church says amen and amen you may be seated this morning hallelujah hallelujah keep the prayer huming keep the worship huming you have to create the atmosphere that's not my job job to create the atmosphere that responsibility is on you you have a job to do God has a job to do and I have a job to do this morning and if we all do our jobs then something is going to happen because God is a god of results he is the greatest performance manager that we have ever seen whatever he said that he's going to do he is obligated to do it oh somebody say amen and God is looking for somebody this morning who will do what he has written for them to do he is looking outside the book he knows the beginning he knows the middle he knows the ending and nothing will stop the purpose of God concerning you this morning so I don't know about you but I came to make this place hot this morning because we all have power to turn up the heat brother o said we come to turn up the heat this morning we want to turn up the temperature we want so much fire that there's no room for depression so much fire there's no more room for doubt so much fire there's no room for tiredness so much fire there's no room for arthritis so much fire there's no room for back pain fire there's no room for heartache fire there's no room to be backslid in this service the backsliders will be restored I'm not talking maybe I'm not talking perhaps but in this service the house of hell has got to give way to the name of Jesus there's power in the name there's healing in the name uh there's Deliverance in the name uh oh you don't hear me this morning maybe you in the wrong place or maybe you're in the right place but brother Bram taught us you cannot ever come to church and remain the same he said you either get better or you get worse but I believe in my heart this morning there are some people in the house who want to get better they want to change

the spirit of God I'm identified with a group that knows he's unveiled to know he's unveiled means that every mystery is revealed the mystery of Who You Are the mystery of who God is the mystery of

a different season somebody today is going to go free some body today is going to move from mental Faith to spiritual Faith you have heard the message by the hearing of the air but now is a transformation could it be the Dynamics to the mechanics Hallelujah you may be seated Hallelujah I'm under expectation to see a church that brother brandham spoke about a church he said God will have a spotless church God will have a super Church those were the words that Malachi 4 used and I'm going to use those same words a super church he wants to see a super Church he's not defining it by this group and that group he's talking about a bride body an invincible Army an Unstoppable Army what sin do you have this morning that can come in front of a super Church what sickness do you have this morning nothing will stand before a super church this is not a Pentecostal church not a Methodist Church not a Baptist Church this is the house of God somebody say Amen you may be seated GL hallelujah hallelujah GL so I have a title this morning my title is no more excuses I'll say that again no more excuses say it with me no more excuses one more time no more excuses one more time no more excuses I can't hear you no more excuses Give the Lord a hand of Praise My subject recognizing who who you are what you are called to do and that now is the time and my inspiration a manifestation of a super church because that's our promise a manifestation of a super church now when you study the scripture and you read brother bram's message he said on the day of Pentecost they had a super church it was a powerful church it was a holy ghost L Church there was no sin in the church when ananas came up to Peter he didn't realize that the pillar of fire had tabernacled itself on Peter's heart and Peter was no longer in the driver's seat but the Holy Ghost was in the driver's seat so when he thought he was lying to Peter he was lying to the Holy Ghost and God killed him on his spot Hallelujah in that super Church Peter would walk and the light of the sun would shine on Peter and Peter's shadow people were being healed in his shadow that's the attributes of a super Church somebody help me this morning Paul is preaching somebody Falls dead he doesn't just call an emergency he prays turns around keeps on preaching and that brother is on fire you can't tell me that brother died in church God resurrected in church and sat there for the rest of the service good word today let me take notes about what I experienced no after he fell dead and he came back to life they couldn't stop him jumping I don't know if you heard another word that Paul said but he knew he was there he died and something came over me something took a hold of me something took control of me you may be seated this morning I'm trying to go I'm all over the place this morning but I want to talk about no more excuses I don't know if I'm going to get to read it I don't know how we going to go this morning but brother Bram said let me see if I find it quickly hallelujah hallelujah my my Hallelujah Glory Glory Hallelujah since I laid my burden down Glory Glory Hallelujah since I laid my burdens down yes I'm feeling so much better since I laid my burden down yes I'm feeling so much better since I laid my burden down this is a sovereign church we don't report to anybody we don't need permission to sing in the middle of the service we do what we want to do under the leadership of the Holy Ghost that's why if you want to sing you could sing shout jump dance that's the upper room individual relationship with the Holy Ghost and Fire it's all over me this morning it's all over you this morning and it's keeping us alive Jesus is keeping us alive you may be seated from the message is your life worthy of the Gospel now brother brandom is tying back to the scripture we read of that supper Hallelujah and I want you to understand the context a great man a certain man had a supper he sent out invitations the Bible said he B many he invited a lot of people he said come and eat you don't have to pay for anything I'm preparing everything you just have to show up and come it's not on you it's on me it's not your job it's my job just come he sent out invitations come don't worry about what you're wearing come because in those days when you are invited they provide a robe for you so don't worry about your clothes don't worry about the food there's no admission fee there's no cost to you just show up and come you may be seated and when you having a big feast or a big convention or a big festival or whatever it is there's a lot of preparation that goes into it there's a lot of sacrifice there's a lot of time there's a lot of planning and this great man this certain man he took a lot of time because he wanted his guests to have the very best treatment he didn't want him to just have chicken he wanted chicken and fish and steak and pork and shrimps and cavar he wanted to make sure it was a delectable Cuisine of the finest selection because he was catering for the best of the best he was catering for royalty he was caterings for individuals who had been selected who had been chosen you may be seated you may be seated so he gave us an announcement he got his right hand man he said all things are now ready the pork is hot the chicken is ready for the vegetarians there's rice and tofu whatever you need is all ready now go out to the neighborhood go out to everybody who has been invited and tell them to come tell them come to the Revival tell them come and worship tell them come and dance come and Shout come and pray you may be seated hallu and one by one one by one they start to make excuses excuses yes and There's Something About This Thing Called excuses because an excuse is when you pass on the responsibility for your action unto someone else or something else and they are good excuses they are bad excuses these excuses were not horrible excuses man say I bought a piece of land that's that's legitimate amen amen amen there's nothing wrong with buying land no there there's no sin in mind a piece of property and I say I bought five yoka boxing all right and I have to go and try them see if they're running right see if they can handle weight amen this was not them saying I going into a party I going into a club I go and watch a movie these were not the excuses that they had all right the last one is a noble one he say I got married God Almighty and I'm the man of my house so I can't come because I got to make sure my wife is all right be all that as it may at the end of the day God being a god of results and this being a parable he is interested in only one thing results he's not interested in your reason he's not interested in your excuse he's interested in what happened and what the story was he he wants to know that you attended what he invited you for so a word goes out to the servant who comes back depressed and explains it to the m he say listen go to the highways to the byways because I have prepared too much for all of this food to go to waste there's too many books there's too many tapes there's too much anointing there's too much fire there's too much inspiration there's there's too much hidden under the seven seal that I've been prepared for all this time for there to be nobody to enjoy this food he said go out to the highways go to the byways go invite people who look like they're not going to make it but they're going to make it go invite some people they might be messed up right now but tell them come tell them it's their time tell them it's their season tell them it's their hour tell them it don't matter their condition just come don't matter their mistakes come don't matter their past come no matter where they were born come what job they have come where they're working come tall short big small red white come can the church say Amen you may be seated servant came back he said listen I went and did that and yet there is room I invited everybody in our Circle but yet there is room he said go to the hot go to the lame go to them who have real problems go to the hard case those who people already give up on them and tell them they can never go to heaven go to them too and tell them to come my table will be full there will be a priz Revival there will be a manifestation of this message of Malachi 4 God will raise up people who all the alt are against them but they're going to make it they are going to make it they are going to overcome can the church say Amen I'm the say said you may be seated Hallelujah I got to find it somewhere but but brother BR said it was excuses that they made in the days of Luther because the standard was set but the days of Luther they made excuses that's why they couldn't meet the standard and that's why the Hool ghost had to move on because they made excuses but the bandom even said excuses is denomination he said your Creed could become your excuse but I'm a deacon in this church that's why I can't go to that group and he said all of that is excuses said they made excuses in the days of Moses they made excuses in the Days of Elijah they made excuses in the days of Christ and they make excuses today hallelujah hallelujah brother brandham said in the message is your life worthy of the Gospel he said if Israel 2,000 years ago would have accepted the invitation they were given they wouldn't be as they are today 2,000 years ago Israel turned down the invitation to come to the wedding supper and they turned it down and went into judgment Hallelujah wondering about Jesus when did this man get his learning what school is he from is this not the carpenter son can the church say Amen but the Brandon went on he said Jesus was trying to tell them that their excuses was what killed the prophets that's the prophet's word and what killed the righteous to come he said they accepted their Creeds that men had given them instead of taking the word of God and by doing so had made a word of God of none effect can the church say Amen so as a people we have become very good Hallelujah at making excuses that's right I've made too many mistakes I've never done this before I don't have the right tools Hallelujah I don't know how to use the tools God that brother stumbled me she she started it he made me do it the neighbor did it I was good on Sunday you know all day the service was powerful but by Monday it was C Hallelujah and I wasn't going to respond but then she tell me that thing and that was it excuses I didn't have time all right all right I don't have time I have work commitments amen I don't speak with that brother amen I'm not qualified I don't have an education amen I don't have any experience my family doesn't support me I don't have any friends what are these all excuses because what I want to see this morning at the end of the day when all your excuses finish you're still going to get the Holy Ghost you're still going to be delivered you're still going to get your breakthrough you're still going to have a Revival Hallelujah you may be seated we have excuses for for why we why we are pray why we didn't read the scriptures we have excuses for why we didn't pay our tithes we have excuses for why we late for why we didn't shake this brother's hand we have legitimate excuses in our minds of why we cannot forgive come on now but we're in church every Sunday but there's a reason why you just cannot let it go am hallelujah hallelujah excuses but the word this morning is no more excuses thank you Lord can the church more say Amen can I talk about Moses a little bit amen God had reached a point his limit with what was happening with the children of Israel all right so he said I've I've heard the cries of my people and I've come down and God had to find the right manall the right person the right individual maybe didn't feel good about themselves but that didn't matter because God has his own plan that's right and God had to interrupt his plan interrupt this man's life Called Moses just the same way God has to interrupt us so many times but put different situation in front of us to catch our attention because we get so used to the hustle and the buzzle and we have to recognize the devil's job and I said this on Tuesday night in maraba the devil's job is to use your job to use your neighbor to use the weather to use your paycheck to use your bank account to use the car not working to do everything in his power to give you an excuse to not see who you really are and not realize the potential that God has for you so God has to interrupt Moses's life and drops down and consumes drops down on a on a tree and Pillar of Fire comes down and and attracts in in the mountain and Moses sees it he said this is something because it's on fire but it's not burning and Moses comes up there and God begins to speak to Moses I've heard the cries of my people there are some people who need Deliverance Moses had been living so long in the message 40 years in the message message amen hallelujah that he had lost the burden and God is saying to Moses I've heard the cries of my people you have family down there that need delivered yes you have sons and daughters and neighbors and relatives people you grow up with who need Deliverance I got to send somebody but you got to go you have got to go you have got to do it you have got to forgive you have got to love you have got to drop your heart you have got to pray I've come down but you got to go let me say that again I've come down but you got to go I came down with a message through a prophet but you got to go I'm not going you got to go I've already come down seven angels already came down from eternity but you got to go there's something that you got to do I've come down but you got to go you may be seated and when God explained it all to Moses praise God what did Moses do I can't talk I don't know how to use PowerPoint I don't know how to do presentations I never sell to anybody I never present to anybody I never try I don't know how I'll tell them that they could be free I not even feeling free how I could tell Hallelujah and I can imagine God Is Watching Moses talking I say come on keep it coming give me all tell me all the reasons why you Caro tell me all the problems you have why you Caro because when you finished tell me you're still going when you finish with all your excuses it will reach a point where there are no more excuses after you tell me it's your bills the mortgage too high you're struggling to pay your rent it's a long time you're coming to church you've been holding on when you give me all the excuses I want more tell me today give me all the reasons why you can't be happy give me all the reason reasons you can't shout tell me tell me tell me why you can't pray tell me give me all the reasons why you can't get the Holy Ghost give me all the reasons why you can't grow your hair out and dress like a lady of the Lord tell me all the reasons give me all the excuses because when it's over there'll be no more excuses bring them out today tell me why you can't be on fire tell me you why you can't smile tell me why you can't chop your hor bring on all the excuses because it's got to run out and when it runs out there'll be no more excuses you still got to go oh you don't hear me this morning there's no excuse to be sad this morning there's no excuse to be dead this morning there's no excuse to be depressed this morning there's no excuse to hold art what are you telling me this morning you have no reason there's nothing you could tell me this morning to justify you being a Halfway Christian there is no excuse there is no excuse touch your neighbor and tell them no more excuses Hallelujah turn to somebody else tell them no more excuses no more excuses tell somebody else no more excuses no more excuses we're going to have a Revival no more excuses we're going to have a prayer life no more excuses we're going to pray for our children no more excuses we're going to come to church early no more excuses there's no reason there's no excuse there's no justification there's no explanation I don't want to report about why you're late you're supposed to be at your post of Duty I don't want to know why you miss church I know no excuses turn up the heat turn up the heat a little bit turn up the little heat a little bit I want you to finish all the excuses you may be seated I only now come to church that's no excuse I many for a long time I tired that's no excuse you know how long I have this back pain that's no excuse you know long I used to have back pain now it's a shoulder pain it's two pains that's no excuse when you finish listen Moses say I can't talk he say I'm slow to speech even if you're slow still say it I'm Hallelujah going to make it you're still going no excuse I'm going to have a Revival slow to Speech but slow and steady wins the race no excuses say it speak it shout it scream it we going to have a Revival hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah you may be seated that attitude Changes Everything About You Hallelujah because an excuse is a way out yes that's right but I realize something you see when you get desperate that's right come on when you get desperate there's no room for excuses in those four men who had the friend Hallelujah who with the with the condition of py am he was shaking and trembling he was an involuntary country he lost the control and they heard that Jesus was in the town having a house meeting when they heard that brother Mikey they say we got to get our friend to Jesus they didn't make his condition an excuse they found a way to put him on the bed they were walking on the road like this because he was shaken that wasn't the excuse your car can have three tires that's no excuse doesn't matter what the situation is there is no excuse for you getting what you came to get this morning you may be seated and brother Jerome when they got to the house meeting God loves to create situation to test if you're going to make an excuse if you're going to have a reason for why you're not praying why you're not sighing why you're not desperate I mean they God there the house is full convention overflowing there's no room those guys had a legitimate excuse we cannot get to Jesus but those brothers because of desperation they took the approach no excuses we got to get this man to Jesus they analyze the situation I don't know you may be seated if there was an engineer in the group Hallelujah prise God you may be seated analy the building he said well if we go up to the side and go to the top and we dig a hole with this circumference I don't know how they did it however they did it they found a way they didn't make an excuse they were probably shaking on the way of the house that didn't matter to them they were determined to get to Jesus you may be seated when you take the approach as a Christian no excuses nothing will stop you you may be seated and that's why I realize a lot of people don't have faith that's right said to the young people I said listen if the job that you are in is taking you away from God you are in the wrong job don't tell me you need this job to pay the bills if it's taking you away from God because if you make the decision to follow God he's going to give you the right job no more excuses you may be seated so don't tell me because of your job is why your skirt have to be on the edge right millimeters you just shift a little bit Hallelujah no more excuses hallelujah hallelujah I have to quote there I may get it or not but the brand said that's why he preaches as hard as he can because on the day of judgment God don't want to hear your excuse this is not man's standing God accepts no excuses it's the life or nothing so you have to understand and that's why I said some a couple of months ago prove God prove God Amen that's what the world needs to see the unfailing realities but the Brandon preach of the Living God Amen is either he's Jehovah Gyra or he's not Jehovah Gyra but if he is your provider he is obligated to provide for you put him to the test no excuses no more excuses Give me liberty or give me debt I want to be a real Christian or no Christian at all no more excuses God will force the issue in your life to bring his plan Amen to accomplishment hallelujah look at Gideon Gideon the Mighty Man of Allah excuse number one I'm from the smallest tribe amenu is a this is a a triumverate of of excuses and from the smallest tribe and if you analyze the whole tribe my family is the smallest family in the smallest tribe but Lord I want to go deeper than that smallest tribe smallest family and I'm the smallest one in my family so when you talk about this Gideon Mighty Man of Valor somebody else can't be talking about me and God say say you are the one going when your excuses finally run out and you have no more excuses you're still going can the Church Say Amen I hope this sings down inside of your heart Hallelujah I'm tired of people telling me they don't have time to pray and and you have an excuse for that you don't have time to read the Bible there is there an excuse for that you come to church when you want to is there an excuse for that where are you going when you don't put God first what message do you believe when you have a a excuse a justification a reason for why you can't forgive husbands in the house there's no excuse husband love your wives amen wives reverence your husband there's no excuse there's no there's no A B C or D pick one how much Hallelujah no more come on now excuses Give me liberty or give me debt it's good to shout and jump but there are people in the house with all kind of stuff on the inside that only you know and God know is there and that's what we want to deal with this morning it's easy to talk about now it's your brother it's your sister somebody did you but there's some stuff that some of us carry on the inside that we don't want nobody to talk about we don't want nobody to address we want to mine it and grow it up until it becomes so big it takes you over completely Hallelujah many time we talk about the enemy on the outside and it's this and it's that and it's this and it's that and it's this and it's that but what do you do when the enemy is on the inside it's easy on the outside to do the whole show you know God bless you God with the Raymond Thompson I believe it was so beautifully at the convention said brother brandham used to love to go to the hills to the mountains because he got tired of shaking brother's hands who saying God bless you and he's seeing that there was no love for him in their hearts Hallelujah so I'm going beyond the visual this morning I'm going beyond the external this morning and and say there's no excuse amen for that Envy amen amen amen there's no excuses for the jealousy in your heart there's no excuse for the animosity there's no excuse Young Brother young sister for how you disrespect your parents even if you don't say it but it's on the inside we want to dig that up this morning you are who you are when you are alone by yourself that's the real you amen all of mankind has his ability act trinidadians are uniquely gifted in that area amen amen we have very good actors amen put on a great show Sunday Thursday Tuesday youth service meet them on the street able to switch quickly from work vernacular to God bless you you read that book Hallelujah no more excuses Hallelujah excuses the Bible said in the scripture where that great man got angry at the excuses and understand this as I said earlier they were relatively legitimate you can't tell a man don't buy his land and don't mine his property and take care of his wife those are responsibilities amen but God is digging deeper to say you have to prioritize this specific invitation to the wedding supper this invitation to the Holy Ghost this invitation to the Rapture let the cares of this life choke you and while you may have good motives and good objectives and try to do the right thing and do be nice to people and read and pray and do all the nice mannerisms you still miss the fundamental aspect of its def Thunder the life that shakes the devil and it's the token the Holy Ghost itself is what God is looking for amen when the Bible says put a mark upon those that sigh and cry for the abomination in the city we have become so insensitive to the abomination in the city amen now we accept it when the Abomination should make us feel a certain way enough to make you s and cry amen when said you saying oh God have mercy you just see things and just let it go without catching a burden for it amen amen what is your excuse this morning for not sighing Hallelujah for not crying what is your excuse this morning for not building a prayer altar in your house Hallelujah your wife cannot be your excuse no your husband cannot be your excuse having no money cannot not be your excuse not being able to pay the rent is not an excuse not having a house is not an excuse not having a husband or a wife or a boyfriend or that's not an excuse praise God hallelujah thank you Lord hallelujah you see when you really look now at the excuses from a deeper level you see it's it's really a decision is being made you know those that were invited made a choice not to go so the excuse is really an explanation of why you didn't do it am so the question this morning is what is more important than thisall but another way what does it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his soulelujah for God so loved the world he sacrifice everything he gave his only begotten son that that we could have this access this morning Hallelujah there is nothing to gain without sacrifice hallelujah hallelujah GL Hallelujah there is no reward without sacrifice yes you want success in your school you have to sacrifice Hallelujah how do you measure that sacrifice you study you go to your class you read you review that's the process that's the sacrifice sometimes you want to go and play sometimes you want to go out but you make a sacrifice because you have an exam coming up and because you want results and you want the reward you have to make a choice to sacrifice certain things because you want right Hallelujah the reward you want buy a house you want to buy a car you want to buy something of value you can't spend the same way you did when you didn't want those things all of a sudden you decide to have a budget because you're saving to something there will be days when you want to eat a KFC you want a three piece but you know you settle for now stackpack two piece because there's a sacrifice it's also good for your health too because you want a reward but there's a misconception with the kingdom of God that people want to come to church and then they look to the pastor pray for me they come to church and they expect things to happen that because they came to church they are now on this register that now opens up the door to unlimited blessings unlimited favor without sacrifice and that does not exist Hallelujah you have to sacrifice the Bible says we bring a sacrifice of praise praise itself is a sacrifice some of you in here don't even want to praise and that's that's that's that's a sacrifice that you could that you must be able to do because a sacrifice of praise is when you don't feel like praising Hallelujah he is still worthy of the praise so you sacrifice your feeling you sacrifice what's happening in your life and it's a sacrifice of praise because you are acknowledging that he deserves a praise whether you have money or no money whether you're sick or not sick whether you're having a good day or a bad day you make a choice to sacrifice and to give God praise and worship because he is God and there's none like him there's none higher than him there's none greater than him there's no God like Jehovah and it's a sacrifice of praise because when the Praises go up the glory of God must come down you may be seated talk about those all night payam meanss thank you Lord and that's why brother Bram said you could sing too much you could preach too much you could dance too much but you could never pray never pray too much amen that's right that's right and we need to bring back the church to that level of sighing and crying a church that is not sighing and crying is dying because the shouting and the jumping on the outside doesn't deal with the issues on the inside there's a surgery that needs to take place you can't go go to a hospital surgery and do what you want before the doctor tell you before you come in for the surgery don't eat for 24 hours there's certain things you have to do in preparation for the surgery amen amen that's just the way it is Joshua told the people sanctify yourselves amen because in a few days we are going over you can do what you want amen no more excuses I pray that the light this morning would shine upon the seeds in your soul that you could recognize what time are we living in the woman with the issue of blood she had been in that condition for some time she spent her money she got results the doctors told her what was going on she spent more money and the condition wasn't getting better better she could have blamed the doctor she could have blamed the medication she could have blamed stress she could have done whatever she wanted but when she heard Jesus was in town she had no excuse nobody was going to stop her because she didn't want that opportunity to pass her by amen amen so she began to press away yes to Jesus and around Jesus was there were so many people she didn't make that an excuse she didn't make the crowd an excuse she didn't make what other people doing an excuse and that's why when God speaks to your heart you have to respond to God you're not responding to me you responding to his word hallelujah so if something trips inside of your heart and you want to jump that's on you it doesn't matter if anybody else jumping anybody else shouting it's you and God give us more individuals who will be so focused on the promise of God that they would have no excuses thank you jesusall brother Bram said here their excuses is their Creeds and denominations you see your belief could be an excuse that's right and but as long as the denomination your excuses try to shadow that seed that you know actually lays there you were taking the part of lot he said throw them things away and let the gospel light shining upon there the power of Jesus Christ keeping the light off of it will keep it from living because if the light ever gets to it it'll spring forth to life amen but the B said that's the reason the people say don't go to some of them kind of meeting they afraid some of the light will strike one of their members but the B said remember the woman at the well she was a prostitute she stood there there stood the priest they had seen Jesus tell Nathaniel I saw you when you were under the Fig Tree and all that and this little woman when she walked up there in her immoral State at the well living with six men and when she walked up there in that state Jesus said bring me a drink the conversation started go get your husband and come here she said I don't have any you said the truth you've got five and the one you're living with not your husband she said I perceive that you're a prophet and that goes on but the B said that settled it when the light flashed across the seed laying in that little old harot the hot days was over enter the street she went glorifying God she didn't even make her pass an excuse she didn't worry what anybody else said about her she said come see a man who told me the things I've done isn't this the Messiah what was it the light got to that seed back under the shadow of that prostitute shelter so God found way for the light to get to that seat God himself you may me see that you have to understand God himself lives by that no excuses you know God thank you Jesus so it's not something just for you and God don't live by those rules when it was time for God to do Deliverance the Bible said he was so tired he said take me to the other side and he went to sleep on the boat and it was under the way to the other side that the devil come and bring up the storm they they they could have said let's go back to the shore and the other and and go back to where we came from but God had a destination because there was a man on the other side who needed Deliverance and the storm was not going to be an excuse Jesus tiredness was not going to be an excuse the Bible said you maybe see that Jesus was so tired the word carried they used in the original language meant physically to lift so they physically lifted Jesus into the boat amen but he was so focused on delivering that one man on the other side he didn't let his tiredness P excuse the storm was an excuse and when he got to the other side there's a man screaming out for help with demons on him named Legion and the amount of demons he had was also no excuse because when Jesus came to deliver there's no excuse he come to deliver and when God come to set you free the odds could be against you but there's no excuse you're going to be delivered can the Church Say Amen she may be seated Hallelujah could you take some more I'm going to drive this home this morning but the B said let's compare something amen he said let's let's let's let's let's make a comparison amen let's compare the life of St Paul Paul the Apostle to the Rich Young Ruler listen carefully to the prophet he said the same light struck both men that's right am both had the same invitation from Jesus Christ their Bo was well trained in the scriptures they were both theologians you remember Jesus told the Young Rich ruler keep the Commandments he said well I've done these things from my youth he was a trained man so was Paul both were well trained in scripture Paul used to go to Gia and and he was he was trained in scripture both were well trained both of them had the word listen carefully one had it from knowledge the other had it from The Germ of life in it amen so when the light flashed across in front of Paul he said Lord who are you amen he said I'm Jesus here I am and he was ready the light struck both men one was gerti and the other was not amen that's the way it is church spiritual and church natural that's why brother the Bram Tau he said in every Church there are three kinds of Believers so you can't get upset when we preach as hard as we can to live right and people can't meet the mark because in every Church there are three kinds of Believers is everybody with me listen to the prophet the rich man had his excuse he couldn't do it he was to weigh down with too many friends of the world you remember Jesus Des eared he said help you sell all you have give to the porn follow me and he couldn't do it and the say he couldn't do it because he had an excuse and you have said everything you cannot do there will be an excuse there's a reason for it so this man walked away sorrowful Jesus loved him amen amen but he had so many excuses he couldn't do it but the BAM said notice the rich man had his excuses listen carefully he never forsake his testimony this is powerful he's in church living He but we find out that he went to great business he had knowledge he went to such a place till he had so much increase till he had to build new bonds to put things in and when he died and some Bachelor priest with his color turned around preach his funeral no doubt and when he did he said they might have put the flags at half mast this brother Brandon and said our dear beloved brother mayor of this city now he is in the arms of Almighty because he was such a great member of the church he did so and so and so and the Bible says the prophet said in hand he lifted up his eyes being in torment and remember he still wanted to hold his profession in hell he seen Lazarus in the bosom of Abraham and he said Father Abraham and but Abraham took that said still calling him father so what he knew and what he lived was so ingrained in him he had it intellectually Hallelujah the said he took his knowledge and went to an intellectual church and when the light struck him he turned it down but BR said if that isn't the Modern Trend of the church today no matter what God flashes across their path the pillar of fire or whatever else it might be they're still with their knowledge they can explain it away yes and go to the intellectual group for some social standing listen to The Prophet if this doesn't apply to this day amen hallelujah but listen to The Prophet but Paul was already in the social standing with great knowledge a great scholar under gel a right hand to the high priest in so much till he went to the priest and got orders to put all them holy rollers in jail but when the light struck his path and he seen that the same Pillar of Fire that led Israel through the Wilderness was Jesus Christ he forsook all that he knowed and he came to the life can the church say amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Glory Glory Glory Hallelujah my Hallelujah hallu hallu no more excuses excuses Hallelujah from the message of wedding supper I just want to touch on the scripture a little bit but the B said as soon as the invitation was made and given out any excuses was made oh yes one married a wife and the other brought him Oxon you know the story but that's the way it is today God made the supper ready send the preacher to preach the faith what happened oh I can't go because I'm a deacon in another church I just couldn't do that well I couldn't go because it would lower my Prestige the prophet said your prestige oh I couldn't go because I don't believe them old Holy Rollers that's acting like that I'm going to live my life the excuses was made oh it's too straight I don't want to do that excuse and say well I'm so tired when I come in at night I can't go to church that's excuses today oh I'm afraid my husband wouldn't like it I'm afraid my wife would kick me out of the house she ought to if that's the kind of man you are that's right there you are excuses made many of them we could name excuses and said that was done from Luther on down to Wesley's age all kinds of of excuses yeahall oh well we got other things to do but then when the servant come back and said I done all this and they got all excuses he said watch what he said to the preacher now he said supper is already fixed it's already past time in other words time is already gone there's no more time left so he said run quickly and go to the highways go to the byways go knock on the doors go wake up the people tell them time is at hand amen amen hallelujah and brother brandom said people are crying out what's the matter with you preacher he said that's the light of the Bible go get the lame and the Halt and an invitation church is going out this morning brother brand in the message of blessing prophet he said it ought to be the happiest time in the world for the Christian times are going to change the olds going to become young oh my death's going to Fleet away sickness will be no more no more prayer meetings for the sick no more prayer meetings for the lost but God shall come and take the elect away from the for Winds of the earth and Shall Gather them under his wings and we live and reign with him forever in his Heaven oh brother sister friend of mine if you are not prepared tonight may you be prepared at this hour amen I give you an invitation to come to Christ Jesus tonight and receive you that's been different you that know that you're not where you should be with God these are the prophet's words I invite you to the altar with myself I invite every one of you here to come here and not only say but to stay here until God has cleansed your soul amen from everything that's unlike him until you can go out of here a new person not with a corn plaster on but go out of here with a blood transfusion Hallelujah that purifies your blood and gives you new life and New Hope go out with the baptism of the Holy Spirit go out not shouting not dancing not so much them things are all right they all belong in the church they all belong in the Bible what I'm talking about is the holy spirit God's love can the church say amen hallelujah hallelujah and brother Bram goes on in the wedding supper speaking about the robe he said how would it be if you get invited to this wedding supper and there's somebody sitting out with a fancy suit on this table and somebody with Rags on this table and this one wearing what they want so he said it was the custom and the tradition that when you come to the house you are given a robe so that every single person who comes into the supper is looking the same way amen and mother bam said that robe is nothing but the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen amen because when you come in the right way you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen but it's very difficult to preach the baptism of the Holy Ghost if you don't have it or if you've never experienced it you have to find a way to build a bridge above it hallelujah or try to dig under it but we want to go through brother kangali until every last one is sealed into the kingdom can the church sh amen so the invitations are out tonight friends Hallelujah and the call is out to see who would respond to the core Hallelujah and the angel of the Lord is here and he's handing out robes he's handing out the baptism of the Holy Ghost he is the one to give the experience not the preacher but he is the one but the B said that robe is a type that of Elijah and Elisha of Christ and his church that when that mantle was dropped down the church was supposed to wrap itself under that canopy put on the whole armor of God put on the baptism of the Holy Ghost not just on their flesh but on the inner man amen so that it'll be in the control tower and it's something that when every man has been invited by the said you can't go by the door of the church if you go by the door of the church you'll get mixed up in theology amen H he said and I am the door to the Sheepfold Hallelujah he said it must be that you go through Christ but the B said he always wondered how Jesus could be the door to the Sheepfold and he brought out that the shepherd would lay as the door that when the Sheep come in he would lay across the entrance as the door so that if a wolf or anything try to get in they have to go through him and he is saying here that you have to go through Christ it's not the church you go to it's not who your Pastor is you must go through Christ Hallelujah you must go through the baptism of the Holy Ghost you must at the life it must be a living faith must be a living virtue must be a living knowledge must be Temperance patience godliness broadly kindness charity there's no other way can the church say Amen there they were when this robe come on but the B said I don't mean some big robe that some company made out here that's on the outside for man to be seen But The Robe that Christ gives you he said you will be he said the holy ghost that was in Christ comes into the believer that's got the invitation to the supper amen and the say when that rope comes in there there's a little hidden power that comes down in your heart that all the devils in hell can't make you doubt it amen that hidden power not with a great big something across your forehead and a doctor of divinity it's a inside hidden power it's been God's program since the first lamb was slain in the Garden of Eden Samson had it he had a hidden power what was it a touch of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah and brother Bron goes on to talk about Samson he said Samson had shoulders he said he didn't have shoulders like a like a bando he said Samson was a little bitty mama's boy a little curly-headed shrimp hallelujah hallelujah he said that's what fooled the people he was just an ordinary boy and had seven little curls hanging down his back looking like a little that's right everybody would laugh at him a type of the Holy Ghost Church and he was a weakling but when the hour come and God wanted to use him he was a giant brother God wants a church that he can lay his hand on I don't care how little it is two or three gathered in my name I'll be in their midst not just speak it then you say well we got in his name can the church say Amen oh you may be you seated he said I could see Samson he was on his road to see his girlfriend little CeCe boy his little mommy fix his little curls up for the Venoms and he was going to see his little girlfriend and a great big lion run out and roed at him he was helpless and the Bible said that the spirit of God came on him and he grabbed that lion like he was a little goat and tore it in two what a man he was when the spirit of God come on him he had a hidden power that had been given him well that same spirit of God is the Holy Ghost it's a hidden power yes and he slew the lion as if it would have been a kid how powerful he was cuz he had a hidden power my can the church say Amen it's the power of the Holy Ghost that's brought in by divine grace let me say that again it's the power of the Holy Ghost that's brought in by Divine Grace by God our Father that fill the individual with his presence you shall receive life eternal life Zoe God's own life dwelling in you oh what a hidden power can the church say Amen oh my somebody say Amen but the B goes on Daniel had it when the Lions run at him the hidden power showed itself and the lions got scared Daniel had some hidden power the Hebrew children had some hidden power when the fire started to burn them it was hotter than the fire was the hidden power was hotter than the fire in a fiery furnace my my my peter had it after Pentecost and when he went to the gate called Beautiful there laid a man crippled from his mother's womb said Silver and Gold Have I None but I got some hidden power I will give you if you believe it and he picked him up by the hand and said in the name of Jesus Christ rise up and walk and you know what he projected hidden power and when that man's ankle bones got strong he leaped in the air like a heart and began to jump and praise God you know what it's all about it's a hidden power but the B said that's the robe that was handed out how the king this morning wants to hand out more robes he wants to hand out some more robes this morning oh God today but the B said sinner friend you lukewarm church member God is longsuffering he said this is the last call come right in now God is looking to hand out some robes for some vessels who have been invited it's a robe of power a robe of hidden power oh Hallelujah you may be seated will you come in and get the robe or will you make another excuse will you make another excuse I say no this morning we are coming running in this morning we are running into the Ark of Safety we are running into the wedding supper can the church say amen hallelujah Hallelujah brother goes on he said when they all come in and had their robes on come by the door the Lord Jesus you say is that the way you come in yes sir it's exactly right Peter introduced the way on the day of Pentecost when the Holy Ghost was falling all them Theologian was making fun and saying well H look at all these Buns of Fanatics all looking like drunk people but brother I want to look like drunk people because I want the same thing that Peter had I want the same power that James had I want the same power that they had I'm accepting my invitation is there anybody this morning that's accepting their invitation I'm not going to be too much longer with you you may be seated and friends a lot of people know the message yes a lot of people read the books but there's nothing like you having an experience with God and receiving the Holy Ghost the B said is the theme of every Apostle have you receive the Holy Ghost since you believe go read Acts 19 yes amen hallelujah but preach a message what the Holy Ghost was given for he said the Holy Ghost comes to give you power he said I got some more scriptures here just a minute the Holy Ghost come to give you power power in prayer he said you take a person that lives a good life but they're always defeated oh I tell you it's a good person oh I sure love the Lord Brother random but they always defeated they never get a prayer answered fill that little woman with the Holy Ghost one time watch what take place when she goes before God she's not defeated she comes boldly to the throne of God believing she has a right because she's a daughter of God by birth Born Again take a little man so cowardly the Boss Kick him all over the place wait a minute here now something's changed see he's got the Holy Ghost and if you don't have the Holy Ghost in here this morning you ought to be desperate Lord fill me with the Holy Ghost I want this kind of blessing I want this kind of power I want this kind of experience hallu Hallelujah you may be seated oh my I was talking on power of prayer power of speech power for a holy life amen that's what the Holy Ghost is to do some of you people walking along saying well I just can't quit drinking I just can't quit this the Holy Ghost comes to live in you to make all these cans get away from you that's right make women stop cutting their hair make them quit wearing shorts and slacks and listen to the prophet no excuses make them quit tattling oh yes that word is for to make you a holy life it'll follow the instruction of the Bible every time amen amen listen to The Prophet woman say it's just too hot I just have to wear these gives me a headache if I let my hair grow but there's no excuses with the Holy Ghost AM let me say that one more time there's no excuses with the Holy Ghost so when it comes to the word of God if you find yourself making excuses about what God's word is you need an experience with the Holy Ghost because there's no excuses with the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost makes you follow the word every single time because the Holy Ghost cannot contradict the word the Holy Ghost has to be identified with the word so if you find yourself making excuses this morning you need to hit the Altar and say Lord I need a touch from the Holy Ghost I need the Holy Ghost I need to be filled I need to be refilled I need to be transformed I need an individual experience hallelujah it's there to make it so the Holy Ghost will follow the word just exactly that's what the Holy Ghost is to do it's to make you make you man turn your head from them half naked wom and quit lusting after them yeah church members that what's it's supposed to do it's to quit making you smoke and drink and want to be a big shot it'll take that out of you that's what the Holy Ghost is for it's for a holy life it makes you quit gossiping makes you quit playing cards shooting craps and all these other things that you do around the corner it'll make you quit you're carrying on the way you're doing living untrue to your wife that's what it'll do it'll quit making you want to marry somebody else's wife these are the prophet's words now it's to make you live a holy life that's what the Holy Ghost is power for to set your affections on the things above where God stands the mind of Christ in you Hallelujah he said you can't help them seeing those things but when you look at them you turn your head what does that it's the Holy Ghost you say I can't do it oh I just can't sure you can't but the Holy Spirit comes for that purpose that's what the Holy Ghost is for not by your strength not by your might but by the spirit of the Lord and that's the prophecy that's hanging over you this morning you shall be filled you shall be changed you shall be adopted you may be seated I'm almost finished this gospel is not in world only but it's in power and demonstration God want to see somebody live this thing yes they are sick but that's no excuse I don't care how bad the situation is we're going to still pray for them until there's coming a time brother brandham said we wouldn't even have to lay hands on the sick but we will command the Devils to come out of them that's what I'm looking for no excuses I don't care what the doctor says I don't care what the neighbor says I don't care what your pastor says I care about what the word says because God's word cannot fail his word must come to pass no more excuses no more excuses no more excuses oh hallelujah hallelujah you may be seated so

what you think about before you open your lunch it's got about what you do before you stab the car Lord I want the Holy Ghost I want to live a holy life my soul is thirsting for something my heart is crying for something he said If any man thirst let him come unto me he said blessed that they that that do hunger and thirst they shall be filled may God put a thirst in your soul for him this morning may God put a desire in your heart to be like him may God perform surgery this morning to put a deep desire Lord I don't want to be the same way anymore hallelujah hallelujah you may be seated we have
