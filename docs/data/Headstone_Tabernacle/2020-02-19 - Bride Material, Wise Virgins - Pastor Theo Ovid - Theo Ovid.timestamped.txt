[22:02] pray in Jesus I ask it
[22:04] you love him designed amen god bless you
[22:07] and welcome if of your Bibles I like you
[22:10] to turn to Acts chapter 19 I wanna read
[22:13] verse 1 to 6 I want to read Matthew
[22:16] chapter 5 1 verse 4 6 and also much you
[22:20] chapter 25 really fumbles wanted to team
[22:24] first country-region tonight reading
[22:30] from acts 19 verse 1 came the pass while
[22:34] Apollo's was at Corinth Paul having
[22:37] passed through the upper course to came
[22:38] to Ephesus and finance certain disciples
[22:40] he said unto them have you received the
[22:42] Holy Ghost since he believed and they
[22:44] said to him we have not so much as what
[22:47] did there be any Holy Ghost he said unto
[22:49] them until what then were you baptized
[22:51] they said unto John baptism and then
[22:53] said Paul then said paul john verily
[22:56] baptized with the baptism of repentance
[22:58] seen and unto the people that they
[23:01] should believe on him which should come
[23:02] after him that is on christ jesus and
[23:05] when they heard this they were baptized
[23:07] in the name of the lord jesus and when
[23:09] paul had laid his hands upon them the
[23:11] Holy Ghost came on them and they speak
[23:14] with tongues and prophesied so this Holy
[23:16] Ghost that came upon him was an
[23:18] experience that they received it was an
[23:20] explanation it was not teaching it was
[23:21] not edification and tried to show them
[23:23] what inside of them it was an experience
[23:25] that they receive and from Matthew 5:6
[23:28] he said blessed are they which do hunger
[23:30] and thirst after righteousness for they
[23:33] shall be filled
[23:36] our last scripture from chapter 25 of
[23:39] Matthew then shall the Kingdom of Heaven
[23:41] be likened unto ten virgins which took
[23:44] their lamps and went forth to meet the
[23:45] bridegroom five of them Elias five of
[23:48] foolish D that were foolish took their
[23:50] lamps and took no oil with them but the
[23:53] wise took oil in their vessels with
[23:54] their lamps while the bridegroom tarried
[23:57] and the oil slumbered and slept at
[23:59] midnight there was a cry made behold the
[24:01] bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him
[24:04] then all those virgins arose and trimmed
[24:06] their lamps and the foolish said unto
[24:07] the wise give us of your oil for our
[24:10] lamps are going out
[24:12] but the wise answered and said see not
[24:14] so at least they're not enough for us
[24:17] and you but go ye rather to them that
[24:19] sell and buy for yourselves and while
[24:22] they went to buy the bridegroom came and
[24:25] did our poor ready they that were ready
[24:28] went in with him to the marriage and a
[24:30] door was shut
[24:31] afterwards chemo so the other virgins in
[24:34] Lord Lord open to us but he answered and
[24:36] said verily unto you I know you not
[24:39] watch therefore for you know neither the
[24:42] day nor the hour wherein the Son of man
[24:45] cometh may God bless his word you may be
[24:47] seated
[24:47] oh praise the Lord yasur always a
[24:52] privilege for me to be in the house of
[24:55] God for us to come into God's presence
[24:57] and we looking forward to see what Lord
[24:59] will do for us tonight our title tonight
[25:02] bright material wise virgins strange
[25:05] combination of words but which see what
[25:07] will or will do bright material wise
[25:10] verges have a contact Scripture and this
[25:13] is from Acts chapter 5 eat a reading
[25:16] from verse 5 Acts chapter 8 from verse 5
[25:18] then Philip went down to the city of
[25:20] Samaria and preached Christ unto them
[25:23] what did he preach Christ unto them and
[25:26] the people with one Accord give heed
[25:29] unto those things which Philip speak
[25:32] hearing and seeing the miracles which he
[25:36] did for unclean spirits crime but a loud
[25:40] voice came out of many that were
[25:42] possessed with them and many taken with
[25:45] policies and that will lean were healed
[25:48] and there was great joy in that city so
[25:52] this was hopeful it was preaching the
[25:54] gospel this is all the word was being
[25:56] confirmed this is all the acts 16 was
[25:58] getting into accent oh praise got
[26:00] another scripture we harvest from sin
[26:02] John 12 verse 22 24 and there were
[26:06] sitting Greeks among them that came up
[26:08] to worship at the feast the same came
[26:11] therefore to Philip which was of the
[26:13] taste of godly and desired him saying so
[26:15] we would see Jesus and Philip cometh and
[26:17] telleth
[26:17] Andrew and Andrew and Philip tell Jesus
[26:20] and jesus answered them saying they
[26:22] always come
[26:23] that the son of man should be glorified
[26:26] verily verily I sent you except a corner
[26:29] we'd fall into the ground and die it
[26:30] abideth owned but if I died bringing
[26:33] forth much fruit oh praise God
[26:36] so I ready to smoke tonight ok let's go
[26:40] no this is from so you see Jesus where
[26:43] I'm saying some stuff he said knowing
[26:45] that there was some God somewhere told
[26:47] many Greeks and they had thousands of
[26:49] them that they worshipped the head of a
[26:51] historical quad that none miracles and
[26:53] among the Hebrews and I also heard that
[26:55] this God that you said be a miracle book
[26:57] in Hebrew God was over here in the land
[27:00] with them again so it attracted the
[27:02] attention so they came to see Jesus
[27:05] now notice usually the way people want
[27:08] to find Jesus is to find somebody who
[27:11] knows how to take them to him a leader
[27:14] or one of his servants is do we define
[27:17] him here we go so Jesus if he ever
[27:20] chooses a servant he always chooses
[27:24] somebody that will bring the people to
[27:27] him because it is his purpose to serve
[27:30] the people now they brought unto his
[27:33] presence and I guess into his presence
[27:35] these Greeks Philip they consulted
[27:37] Philip and Philip said no here is
[27:39] someone that wants to see our Lord so it
[27:41] wouldn't be just right for me to have
[27:43] the honor to introduce these Greece to
[27:44] my lord
[27:45] I'll go get aren't you to go with me so
[27:47] they went got Andrew Andrew and Philip
[27:49] boat came and presented these Greeks to
[27:52] Jesus now here is a greeting and a text
[27:55] that's unusual just as soon as these
[27:58] Greeks was pointed to Jesus Jesus did
[28:00] not point to himself
[28:04] now this is big Ian hood like I know
[28:07] your nose already but this is what Jesus
[28:10] did not point to himself nor did he make
[28:12] himself known to them because you cannot
[28:16] know Jesus in that way Jesus is known in
[28:20] that way we see in the scripture that
[28:24] when these Greeks brought brought up to
[28:26] Jesus and won in his presence it looked
[28:28] like Jesus could have said well I am the
[28:30] Messiah of Jewish race has been
[28:32] predicted by the prophets by inspiration
[28:34] don't do the cemeteries and I am here
[28:37] now and I am born of Nazareth I'm a
[28:39] Jewish of a Jewish mother my father is
[28:41] God I'm here to make myself known to you
[28:43] Greeks no that would be more like the
[28:46] 1961 version of this but look as soon
[28:49] here we go as they are brought in his
[28:51] presence that's the main thing get the
[28:55] people in his presence and as soon as in
[28:59] his presence jesus said except a corn of
[29:03] wheat falls into the ground and die it
[29:05] abideth on what an unusual thing instead
[29:10] of accepting the introduction the thing
[29:12] he done was to point them to the place
[29:14] where they could find him except a
[29:18] corner weight falls in the ground and
[29:20] die it abides alone what did he do here
[29:23] he pointed them to that great truth how
[29:25] to see him they could not see him in the
[29:28] way of eternal life just stand-in there
[29:30] though he was he was a man but he
[29:32] pointed them dear in his presence Christ
[29:35] pointed them to the truth he said to see
[29:37] him was to go to the cross that is where
[29:41] it is at the cross except a corner with
[29:45] falls in its Abbes alone
[29:46] and if he did not die he would have to
[29:49] abide alone himself if he did not die
[29:52] but him being the corner weak that fell
[29:54] into the ground and then if it falls
[29:56] into the ground he said it will bring
[29:57] forth abundance it will fall into the
[30:00] ground and dies first it had to be a
[30:02] zoomit eyes green or glory to God what
[30:06] he meant is watch if I live my
[30:08] alone and died this week I just live my
[30:10] life alone
[30:11] well then there'd be no food after me
[30:13] here we go I already but if I fall into
[30:16] the ground under the will of God
[30:18] I will bring forth a new bullet and that
[30:24] new bullet will bring forth another new
[30:26] ability and another new birth until the
[30:29] whole world will be missionary and
[30:31] gospel preached so he was pointing them
[30:35] that the cross will produce the new
[30:38] birth because his water blood and spirit
[30:43] so the cross will release the
[30:47] ingredients to produce the new build or
[30:50] glory to God and the new birth spreading
[30:53] from one to another who glory to God
[30:55] so that is why Parker asks the question
[30:57] have you received the Holy Ghost since
[31:01] you believe because you're supposed to
[31:03] receive it after you believe or glory
[31:06] the God not when you believe after you
[31:07] believe you receive something to confirm
[31:10] you have faith in what you have received
[31:12] as belief or do you leave that glory to
[31:16] God so listen to this now so if we
[31:18] ourselves in our ministry you know what
[31:22] thoughts are in our life if we are bad
[31:24] as we are
[31:24] we can do no good we got to also die at
[31:28] the altar or we will live alone we will
[31:31] live to some Organic denomination or
[31:33] some Creed we will live to some
[31:34] organization but if we die to ourselves
[31:36] then the Holy Spirit here we go will be
[31:39] spread for everywhere by our lips we
[31:45] have got to die all glory to God what
[31:49] happened Peter wins at the house of
[31:50] Cornelius while Peter yet speak these
[31:53] words the Holy Ghost fell upon them that
[31:56] heard the word and they were baptized
[31:58] where the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost was
[32:00] coming out in man mount out of the lips
[32:04] by the word of God being spoken so the
[32:09] world coming out a man mount and gore
[32:10] taking a word and trapping the spirit
[32:12] straight long into people's heart being
[32:14] baptized by the Holy Ghost this is what
[32:17] God promised in the last days we believe
[32:20] that
[32:21] all right so we must realize Oh Chloe
[32:25] aah we must realize that we have got to
[32:30] die in order to bring forth new life

[45:00] so butter Baron says them disciples
[45:04] before they did anything they took these
[45:07] Greeks into the presence of Jesus I like
[45:10] that
[45:11] in the presence but in the teaching and
[45:14] the presence
[45:16] I had a doctrine in the Bible book if
[45:19] you Rosita's DC new fellowship they many
[45:22] presents yet they have not body missing
[45:25] by day but not presence Oh hallelujah
[45:29] you see what I'm saying that is see
[45:33] Mussina possible they seem as in a
[45:35] pastor Creed that's the same as saying
[45:37] Hail Mary and to our Father that make a
[45:40] Catholic does he seem I seen all of that
[45:43] God wants you to come into his presence
[45:46] not the presence of the posture his
[45:49] presence the pastor has to get in his
[45:51] presence
[45:52] I'm not hearing you tonight everybody
[45:56] after coming to his presence
[45:58] Oh glory to God hallelujah Oh glory to
[46:04] God let's go watch and they took these
[46:08] Greeks into the presence of Jesus and if
[46:10] he's the same Alabama if he's the same
[46:13] yesterday and forever he will have to
[46:15] act the same today if you are brought
[46:19] into his presence disciples today is so
[46:23] much different today they bring you to
[46:25] some other place to some church some
[46:29] organization some doctrine laws we
[46:32] believe it so watch but never get you
[46:36] into the presence of Christ there we go
[46:38] almost done this afoot in part a real
[46:41] true disciple would bring you right
[46:43] straight into the presence of Christ are
[46:46] you ready and from dear Christ would
[46:49] show you what you had to do
[46:52] [Music]
[46:55] [Applause]
[46:56] [Music]
[46:59] alright let's cut you know so we could
[47:04] get you here question but a Balam are
[47:08] the five foolish virgins on March 25
[47:10] counted as the Gentile remnant I
[47:12] understand that the five foolish virgins
[47:14] were saved but have to go through the
[47:17] Great Tribulation Period is this correct
[47:19] if so what will be the final destination
[47:22] could there be the sheep that was
[47:24] divided from goats and Marty 25 Brum
[47:28] said a pretty good to theologian you see
[47:33] he said now that they are the remnant
[47:37] the civil version is the remnant spoke
[47:39] of in Revelation of the woman's seed
[47:42] that keeps the commandments of God and
[47:44] have the testimony of Jesus Christ
[47:47] a woman will take a piece of goods Claud
[47:51] unlived on and she takes a pattern and
[47:55] leaves anywhere she desires which way
[48:00] she's going to cut that and then when
[48:02] she has the left over is called the
[48:04] remnant but she chooses to cut it from a
[48:08] certain place by our own free thinking
[48:12] but what is left over is called the
[48:14] remnant and if you notice that they were
[48:17] five foolish and five wise virgins all
[48:19] of them was virgins made out of the same
[48:22] material but by election here we go God
[48:26] chooses bride by election before the
[48:31] foundation of the world
[48:34] hallelujah put their names on the Lamb's
[48:37] Book of Life slain from before the from
[48:39] visible before the world ever began the
[48:43] day in the funeral that I did Somali I
[48:45] was talking about considering the end he
[48:49] said the Bible said that at the end of
[48:51] something than the beginning hallelujah
[48:54] and to consider the end in your
[48:58] decisions and actions consider the
[49:00] endgame where you want to end up what
[49:02] the end will be is not where you start
[49:04] because because Joseph started kick
[49:07] totem and
[49:08] and shun by his brothers but he ended up
[49:10] as the right hand of Pharaoh Oh glory to
[49:13] God David was a shepherd boy that's when
[49:16] he stopped but he ended up in king of
[49:17] Israel it's not my dear status not where
[49:20] you are as very gonna end so you have to
[49:22] consider help me turn on my DS I got on
[49:24] my end but God will start from the
[49:26] beginning he stuff on the end he know
[49:28] that's why he gets a only four new eco
[49:30] Lori called justified origin he know
[49:32] where you're going already
[49:33] that's already glorified so he finishes
[49:36] already and then come at the beginning
[49:38] and start the story then Satan is
[49:40] trapped because he don't understand it's
[49:43] finished already
[49:44] okay the Lord has shown because he
[49:46] starts at the end or Gloria already in
[49:49] the Millennium you already knew city you
[49:51] already have a new body everything is
[49:53] covered already already glorified and
[49:55] you come and I can roll back the tape
[49:56] here and put you to trouble so God is
[50:10] not rolling dice and so quad I hope you
[50:11] make it I want to look tonight not
[50:13] because a way they behaved last night no
[50:15] no God not that kind of frightened mode
[50:17] God know the end from the beginning or
[50:19] glory to God if Israel were to consider
[50:21] their behavior they never they never
[50:23] said we can take it or glory does caught
[50:26] it in under saccade bring them out the
[50:28] same father brought him out judge them
[50:29] because it wasn't considered the end and
[50:31] the Bible said teasing happen for
[50:33] examples for whom the ends of the will
[50:35] have come or glory the caution learn
[50:38] from their behavior learn from the
[50:39] attitude not God is a good god all the
[50:41] time that's a phrase what is the core of
[50:43] the word Oh hallelujah
[50:46] okay the Lord a shout praise God praise
[50:49] God hallelujah glory to God is not he
[50:53] who starts if you finishes these are
[50:56] sprint is a long distant race

[51:01] with God have patience with yourself
[51:03] pace yourself

[51:07] nothing go on to the end
[51:08] all glory to God be in for the long haul
[51:11] [Applause]
[51:13] that's right be not tired dice why be
[51:16] not weary that's why we could start an
[51:18] after the promise of God to on the leaf
[51:20] but stronger than praise for God because
[51:23] we in this thing for the long haul
[51:25] we're not looking for shortcuts there
[51:27] are no shortcuts you have to die to
[51:29] yourself oh - oh we don't want a

[53:34] or glory of God the book of Acts church
[53:37] the church he sent the professional hats
[53:39] back to order the Lord showed a no no's
[53:42] modern singer all glory that's why I say
[53:45] get on fire or glory no God bring your
[53:48] fire with you I come and fire every time
[53:50] I come here as fire coming bring yours
[53:53] Oh hallelujah
[53:56] you either wonder what mines you bring
[53:58] yours when yours when your fire go
[54:07] either God hallelujah hallelujah my
[54:12] glory said the bride is it it shows my
[54:15] election it's not right so then the
[54:17] fullest version was the one who did not
[54:19] have oil in their lamps the happy box
[54:23] the heavy tapes the happy preachers they
[54:26] have the ministers they have for 50
[54:28] years but no oil so the oil is something
[54:35] different then if the butcher is oil and
[54:39] as the oil just piles in the business
[54:41] stuff it in your clothes
[54:43] sleep on it a would wrestle undress with
[54:55] just this book one book and wrap
[54:56] yourself up in it and another stick
[55:02] would make a wave hat
[55:07] it cannot be that he's talking about but
[55:11] something is your preaching the word is
[55:12] the word you're preaching we can't pre
[55:15] Saturn and Venus and Mars even though
[55:16] there's a Bible up there you have to
[55:23] preach the word but then the Bible was
[55:25] also the pyramid so in a preach the word
[55:28] you get the perimeter in you but the
[55:29] perimeter is not at board but with nice
[55:32] colors in it with Rachel in it no this
[55:34] has to be a living fit and live in
[55:37] virtual if either call it a written
[55:39] epistle read and known of all men is the
[55:42] same writen but the writen that becomes
[55:44] flesh
[55:47] so then you yourself become a written
[55:50] word
[55:51] [Applause]
[55:52] you know John was John was the voice of
[55:55] one crying in the wilderness that weird
[55:58] voice of one kind of illness when that
[56:01] make flesh is not a man called John
[56:04] before I send you elijah the prophet
[56:06] when that was made flesh it was called
[56:08] William Marion Branham and when the word
[56:12] for you make fresh is you what you say
[56:18] moreover you have to be the word made
[56:21] manifest
[56:24] tonight he said bye and true the bride
[56:27] will be fulfill all not by the church
[56:32] people so you can look at church members
[56:34] that is them there on the own bye-bye
[56:36] unclear the bride will be full of fill
[56:38] all that was promised in his last day so
[56:41] you can look at the church member and
[56:42] expect some manifestation is not coming
[56:44] it happening Oh glory to God go out to
[56:48] get the right material and we call it
[56:53] bright material wise version material
[56:59] man that one extra shelter
[57:02] extra extra oil hallelu not extra talk
[57:07] because in the last days go are people
[57:10] having itching ears there's hot on them
[57:12] because they want a yes or more
[57:14] revelations more interpretations more
[57:17] what man figure out and collectively
[57:19] note silly woman the Bible College
[57:22] leading with diapers lust ever leading
[57:25] and never committed known truth all they
[57:28] could do is argue and top Anita go and
[57:29] do something in the house I sub
[57:31] gossiping and all kind of thing like
[57:33] that
[57:33] there is no get something right about
[57:35] the spirit ever little never counted in
[57:37] knowledge of the truth Oh hallelujah
[57:40] and God want to reveal to you his
[57:42] knowledge then what knowledge is
[57:44] knowledge of the son of God that you
[57:46] have to be conformed to his image or
[57:48] chlorine or of his likeness because we
[57:50] came back to Genesis and you can go back
[57:52] to Genesis with or coming back into the
[57:53] image and likeness or glories goes image
[57:56] and likeness bring on the preeminence
[57:58] says that is what God wanted will glory
[58:00] to God do you get what I'm saying
[58:01] tonight god I want you he won the Prix
[58:04] eminences or Gloria coy so sinful man
[58:07] and bloom Oh blow him out and then put a
[58:10] fire inside a deer you know this snake
[58:12] out your heart and drop the Dove inside
[58:15] your soul then he could have the
[58:17] preeminence says he could have the
[58:18] oversight he could have the leading he
[58:20] could take you and lead you and you
[58:22] wouldn't fight him oh god you could be
[58:23] left like the spirit right now God can
[58:26] even lead you Witcher with your ability
[58:28] to turn and temp and under no davia

[58:39] sins nor dogged coming near you you have
[58:41] to get rid of all them things you have
[58:43] to be delivered praise God
[58:45] and then that does good come and I
[58:47] realized direct your walk and then it'll
[58:49] fall into the scripture as many as a led
[58:52] by the Spirit of God the other sons of
[58:54] God he had not given the spirit of
[58:56] bondage to fail but he give us the
[58:58] spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba
[59:00] Father he knew some spirit upon you to

[1:06:40] they're coming out that a showdown at
[1:06:42] the end time here it's just two seasons
[1:06:44] ago have hallelujah seven seas upon a
[1:06:47] brain seven spirits upon a bride
[1:06:50] do you understand the bride is and be

[1:06:55] second Timothy four heavy and
[1:06:57] high-minded Emily's you spirits the
[1:07:01] bride spirit is full to knowledge
[1:07:03] temperance peace that's the bride ear
[1:07:05] that's the bright materially well glory
[1:07:08] there go that's what God cotton just
[1:07:12] remembers heady highminded lovers of
[1:07:14] pleasure more than lovers God chief
[1:07:16] because in the church Liars in the
[1:07:18] church it was English that chalice
[1:07:22] people in the church back biters in the
[1:07:24] church
[1:07:25] wreath disrespectful in the search
[1:07:28] [Music]
[1:07:31] [Applause]
[1:07:35] [Music]
[1:07:40] a great solution came to me early and
[1:07:44] said I believe God it was imputed on
[1:07:48] differences I said that is true he said
[1:07:51] what more can a man do by belief I said
[1:07:54] that's all he could do he said but
[1:07:56] didn't where do you go with this Holy
[1:07:57] Ghost stuff I've said that that no you
[1:08:00] know he was about this he said where do
[1:08:03] you go with his Holy Ghost if a man
[1:08:05] believed the minute you believe you
[1:08:06] poverty really goes I said no no you
[1:08:12] make a contradiction in the Scriptures
[1:08:14] the scriptures no contradict themselves
[1:08:17] Paul asked them have you received the
[1:08:20] Holy Ghost since you believed I said
[1:08:24] it's true Abraham the father of faith he
[1:08:26] a promise of collaborative God it was
[1:08:28] imprisoned him for righteousness but he
[1:08:29] give him the seal of circumcision as a
[1:08:32] sign that he had received his fate and
[1:08:36] if he have never sealed you with the
[1:08:38] Holy Ghost yet he has never received
[1:08:40] your faith in Him you've got some loose
[1:08:42] places you might believe but there's a
[1:08:45] lot of loose places but when you get all
[1:08:47] the pop news places back right then he
[1:08:49] sees where the holy goes until the day
[1:08:51] of your Redemption
[1:08:52] that is God's confirmation that he has
[1:08:55] received a faith that you possess in him
[1:08:57] professing him
[1:08:58] oh my the church will see where that
[1:09:03] Dogma this is not good this is not good
[1:09:05] when God gives you the Holy Ghost it is
[1:09:08] settled you know where you stand
[1:09:11] you know what happened you are sealed
[1:09:14] all the day totality of your Redemption
[1:09:16] your destination on this earthly journey
[1:09:18] that oughta make anybody does have faith
[1:09:21] and believe God and rise up in the power
[1:09:23] of the Spirit now these versions did not
[1:09:25] get the Holy Spirit the only thing the
[1:09:28] last was all in their lamps they had the
[1:09:31] books they had the mysteries they had
[1:09:33] the knowledge they had all knowledge but
[1:09:36] not the oil they had the best dishes but
[1:09:43] the greatest revelations but not the oil
[1:09:47] [Music]
[1:09:50] some bring any oil is a different
[1:09:52] ingredient and yet the word is spirit
[1:09:57] and the spirit is life you know either
[1:10:02] couldn't get the oil because the word of
[1:10:04] the Spirit is what they rejected and
[1:10:07] last service I quoted it for you my
[1:10:10] voice has gone I didn't have it here
[1:10:12] tonight to see it back but he says the
[1:10:14] church the bride that rejected the head
[1:10:17] pact of the bride would have to suffer
[1:10:20] it if that be so then the thunders
[1:10:25] capped the pyramid then the seven
[1:10:28] thunders is the head part of that the
[1:10:32] seven thunders is in the Holy Spirit
[1:10:33] slot beneath that is the seven churches
[1:10:36] but God put that slot there and LOV is
[1:10:40] Christ's corporate body coming down and
[1:10:42] then only there's this spirit coming you
[1:10:45] have to be caught up into this spirit so
[1:10:50] lowers you are you have to be magnetized
[1:10:52] not by teaching but by the Holy Ghost
[1:10:55] the teacher has to become spirit in you
[1:10:57] then you become magnetized so when the
[1:10:59] brain love Divine magnatum it can pick
[1:11:02] you up take you up it's not coming for
[1:11:04] you it's currently the same material you
[1:11:09] are thoroughly magnetized to the
[1:11:12] headstone
[1:11:15] magnet capital paper magnet capital wood
[1:11:19] magnet capital plastic it could only
[1:11:21] pick up the metal that is money as I say
[1:11:23] it
[1:11:24] so whatever whatever inside of you your
[1:11:28] flash' wrong it is have to go through so
[1:11:30] when God come you've got to be raptured
[1:11:32] because this power it's inside of you
[1:11:35] that's why I said a rapture gonna be in
[1:11:38] you you're not going to the rapture who
[1:11:40] glory bells got the rapture will be in
[1:11:42] you you'll be changed in a moment what's
[1:11:44] on the inside gonna change what's on the
[1:11:46] outside no church to give it let's
[1:11:58] continue
[1:12:04] you see they were back in the church age
[1:12:08] there were some of them there was good
[1:12:10] people but it wasn't in this night they
[1:12:14] with with with the wick dipped into
[1:12:16] oilmen it was out it was gone out they
[1:12:19] had separated themselves Paul said and
[1:12:22] he give a scripture for that he said
[1:12:24] they separate themselves from us
[1:12:25] seemingly not have benefit so when they
[1:12:31] walk out and they turn on defeat and you
[1:12:33] know what give it right seven thunders
[1:12:34] give it seven thunders the word right so
[1:12:37] they will hurry from the faith and they
[1:12:39] don't understand they will hold from the
[1:12:40] channel to access the oil they love the
[1:12:46] prophet they love the message they love
[1:12:48] the books in love what they hear and
[1:12:49] they love the Brethren but they do have
[1:12:51] any oil not make them off foolish virgin
[1:12:57] certified people nice people people to
[1:13:00] hug and laugh and fellowship with all
[1:13:02] night long but no oil
[1:13:14] now notice this virgin she went into we
[1:13:17] pinwheeling nationality let me say this
[1:13:19] my precious love and friend cause
[1:13:21] usually at the church let me say my
[1:13:22] pressure level friend if I come across
[1:13:24] here I'm to have a healing service and
[1:13:26] pray for the sick I've been telling you
[1:13:27] a long time put your conscience in your
[1:13:30] pocket we want to come and be honest and
[1:13:32] true with one another because when the
[1:13:34] last days da is where you precious

[1:13:42] up to the same place Judas believed the
[1:13:45] Lord Jesus was Savior accepted him as
[1:13:47] Savior he was sanctified in John 17:17
[1:13:49] in Matthew 10 they were given power to
[1:13:51] heal the sick raise the dead cast out
[1:13:53] devils and come back with Joycelyn
[1:13:55] Shelton and Jesus told them to rejoice
[1:13:57] because the Devils have the continued
[1:13:58] Julius was with them but when they come
[1:14:01] to Pentecost Judas reached to receive
[1:14:03] the hope for Judith so busy the Holy
[1:14:05] Ghost he showed his color and that's why
[1:14:09] I said last service Judas didn't make it
[1:14:11] at Pentecost he magetta everywhere else
[1:14:14] but as food egos noisy crying out hungry
[1:14:20] intestine fasting praying bawling-crying

[1:14:36] money save money cut it off
[1:14:37] oh what a thing to have he's away he see
[1:14:43] it there's no noise no God waiting Aaron
[1:14:47] are the workwear bells wrong wrong a
[1:14:49] gamut
[1:14:50] when he walking danger ringing and that
[1:14:53] represented poorly holy unto the Lord

[1:35:23] package for the new birds no he said
[1:35:27] this
[1:35:28] last great step which is the holy ghost
[1:35:30] step of baptism must come into
[1:35:32] perfection that means it has the address
[1:35:36] of the life to come into the person of
[1:35:39] the Holy Ghost not just the Baptist no
[1:35:41] but the person added dies the one in
[1:35:43] silence
[1:35:45] that's the one in silence as a group

[1:35:56] smell and you see break out when it's
[1:35:59] not a grow you don't hear no noise I
[1:36:01] just feed him growing feed and drawing
[1:36:07] but that first step except a corner we
[1:36:10] fall and die that debt is a must
