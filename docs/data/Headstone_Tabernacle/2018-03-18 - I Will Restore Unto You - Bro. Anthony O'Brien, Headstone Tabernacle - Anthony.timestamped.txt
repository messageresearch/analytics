[1:59:09] Oh Holland
[1:59:11] we'll never be ashamed by people shall
[1:59:14] never be ashamed oh my he was a flash
[1:59:33] Lord of God we receive okay he said that
[1:59:36] when he made man in His image he was a
[1:59:38] seed of his word and when Jesus was made
[1:59:41] flesh he was the flesh of the Word of
[1:59:43] God he said but when we receive the Word
[1:59:46] of God then we become God's Word in all
[1:59:48] flesh see the crack that the church
[1:59:51] should be in that condition What did he
[1:59:54] say the secret is that the world is in
[1:59:57] the bride and he received that word
[2:00:00] willingly openly with open face
[2:00:04] beholding as in a glass the glory of the
[2:00:07] law and as we behold him we become what
[2:00:10] we behold and we are changed into that
[2:00:13] same image from glory to glory to glory
[2:00:17] from fate of hates growing from
[2:00:20] hallelujah from perche to virtue a man
[2:00:23] oh my I will respond to you say the Lord
[2:00:26] said now if you plant the seed then you
[2:00:29] go out every morning and dig it up and
[2:00:30] say it to see if it's growing he said
[2:00:32] it'll never grow committed to God and
[2:00:35] leave it there
[2:00:36] amen know that it's so and then when
[2:00:40] corn first come up the farmer looks at
[2:00:42] that stalk of corn and he says oh it's
[2:00:44] not wonderful I've got the first two
[2:00:47] little shots shot shoots on it it's
[2:00:49] marvelous he said that's when the
[2:00:51] Lutheran Church the Lutheran Church
[2:00:52] stayed there right out of there come the
[2:00:54] Methodist Church and then the next two
[2:00:57] shoots of corn come up the Lutheran
[2:01:00] begin to wither the Methodists was a day
[2:01:02] alter the message is coming up any cost
[2:01:04] or profit explain the process you know
[2:01:07] he says the name leaves begin to drop
[2:01:09] down but there's still part of the corn
[2:01:13] it still takes all of it to make the
[2:01:15] stalk isn't all right he said we're
[2:01:17] going on and no Pentecost is becoming
[2:01:20] form and different and drying up
[2:01:23] the shoot is still going right on up
[2:01:25] just the same see all the leaves coming
[2:01:27] down like that but she's going right up
[2:01:30] on into the seed crop that's her sitting
[2:01:33] has anything he said but in the
[2:01:35] resurrection the elect of every one of
[2:01:37] them will be resurrected that plant that
[2:01:41] grain of corn off of it and it'll
[2:01:43] produce another stalk just exactly like
[2:01:46] I'm come up in the beginning amen
[2:01:48] he said so don't worry a poor
[2:01:50] grandmother died 40 years ago if she
[2:01:53] walked in a light
[2:01:54] she had it she'd be in the resurrection
[2:01:56] a man he said that's right
[2:01:57] I will restore saith the Lord
[2:02:00] truly a many man hallelujah
[2:02:05] a momentary consideration of church
[2:02:06] history will prove how accurate this
[2:02:09] thought is in the Dark Ages the world
[2:02:11] was almost entirely lost to the people
[2:02:13] but God sent Luther with the word and
[2:02:17] the Lutheran spoke for God at that time
[2:02:19] but any organized and again the pure
[2:02:21] wood was lost for organization tends to
[2:02:24] what dog man Creed's and so on are not
[2:02:26] simple word and they could no longer
[2:02:28] speak for God then God sent Wesley and
[2:02:33] he was the voice with the word in his
[2:02:35] days now and the people who took his
[2:02:38] revelation from God became the living
[2:02:40] epistles read unknown of all man for
[2:02:45] their generation is not so for every
[2:02:48] word I was preached there was a group
[2:02:50] that raised up and they became living
