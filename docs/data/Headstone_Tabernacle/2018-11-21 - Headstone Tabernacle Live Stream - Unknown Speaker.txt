tonight for unto this people shall divide for an inheritance the language I swear unto their fathers to give them i'ma God blessing an hour just Ephesians 4 4 verse 11 a man before we pray one more time Ephesians 4 and from booth 11 then he gave some apostles some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers what for for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ until we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ we're all gonna come in to measure tonight isn't a many man is a measure that God has for us tonight isn't that right and he said that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the sleight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie wait in this in wait to deceive but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him all things which is

this far and I've seen God is gonna take me through tonight he will not he may forsake me tonight be strong enough a good chorus tonight we're in many men for my type of tonight is Ephesians parallels Joshua a man that's my title tonight a man Ephesians perilous Joshua we know where Paulus and other Ephesians brother brought all that keep striking and striking it brings going on his great promises learning then you can't hardly preach enough about Ephesians because when we get over to Ephesians Amen husbands love their wives wise members their husbands children obey their parents Ephesians 4:13
