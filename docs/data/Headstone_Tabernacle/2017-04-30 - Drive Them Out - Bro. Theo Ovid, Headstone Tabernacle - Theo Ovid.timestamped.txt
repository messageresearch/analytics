[42:15] amen amen
[42:17] amen hallelujah God is in control amen
[42:21] so we are coming back from a mighty
[42:23] Revival in Ivory Coast and we were there
[42:25] last year and this year was even greater
[42:28] than last year and I was saying to
[42:30] somebody you know it becomes very
[42:32] difficult because every convention every
[42:34] service you see this is the greatest
[42:35] convention and every time you say it
[42:37] people like but you said that the last
[42:39] time but this convention was the
[42:41] greatest convention that we have ever
[42:43] been in it started off in a way I've
[42:46] never seen where the con opened up the
[42:48] convention and from the moment he
[42:50] started it was just fire the anointing
[42:53] the place was packed out and he preached
[42:55] a masterpiece and after he spoke Friday
[42:57] morning I came Friday night and then
[42:59] brother Raymond Thompson was Saturday
[43:01] morning and then brother over came
[43:03] Saturday night and then brother Olu
[43:05] spoken about the country and by the end
[43:06] of the service we couldn't even have a
[43:08] prayer line because the convention the
[43:10] place was shaken it was about 2,000
[43:12] people in the convention and God visited
[43:15] them he healed the sick he ministered
[43:18] people were baptized with the Holy Ghost
[43:21] it was fire wave after
[43:24] wave and every Minister every brother
[43:27] spoke under direct inspiration there was
[43:31] no coordination let's talk about this no
[43:33] every brother was led by the spirit and
[43:36] ministered as he was led by the spirit
[43:38] and God confirmed every service and made
[43:41] the all of services connect with one
[43:44] message the final message we are getting
[43:47] out of here we are going to The
[43:51] Rapture you know when you're leaving you
[43:53] tell people pack your bags you're
[43:54] leaving but this journey there's no back
[43:57] to pack don't even bother to pack your
[43:59] bags because it's going to be Goodbye
[44:01] World we stay no longer with you goodby
[44:05] sin goodbye cares of Life goodbye
[44:08] mortgage goodbye rent goodbye doctor's
[44:11] Bill goodbye car payment goodbye bad
[44:15] neighbors goodbye boss goodbye traffic

[44:25] Heart blood pressure Whatever It Is
[44:28] Goodbye World we are leaving this place
[44:31] we are getting out of this place can the
[44:33] church say
[44:35] amen
[44:37] amen and after iy Coast I was invited to
[44:41] Lagos to local Christian Assembly
[44:43] brother Olu uh Church in Nigeria and I
[44:45] spoke to the young people for a youth
[44:47] service on Friday night and then I
[44:49] preached on Sunday morning in Lagos as
[44:52] well and I spoke on the manifestation of
[44:55] a super Church as we near The Headstone
[44:59] which is taken from a direct quote from
[45:01] the prophet and it became so real to us
[45:04] because we know that the headstone has
[45:06] to unite with the body but there is a
[45:08] difference between uniting with the
[45:10] headstone and nearing The Headstone when
[45:13] we Unite with the headstone it's one
[45:15] body it's a finished work but brother
[45:18] Bram said as we near The Headstone even
[45:21] before we unite even before the full
[45:24] power even before the completion as we
[45:27] get nearer it's going to be a super
[45:29] church it's going to be a super race as
[45:32] we near The Headstone and I've got news
[45:35] for you this morning when we started the
[45:40] service we are nearer now than when we
[45:43] started the service when sister ingred
[45:46] sang the special we are nearer now to
[45:48] The Headstone than when she sang the
[45:51] special when I started speaking we are
[45:55] nearer now than when we started speaking
[45:58] one of these days we are going to be so
[46:01] close to The Headstone that there'll be
[46:03] a power put into the church and now is
[46:06] coming in when we'll speak the word and
[46:09] see it created right there cancer will
[46:12] not stop this Pride being backslid will
[46:15] not stop this Pride being sick will not
[46:18] stop this Pride it'll be a super Church
[46:21] it'll be a super race it'll be a
[46:24] powerful Church
[46:25] [Music]
[46:27] can the church say amen that's 50% can
[46:30] the church say amen that's 70% can the
[46:34] church say amen that's
[46:36] 82% let everything that had breath
[46:39] praise the Lord Let the church say Amen
[46:43] oh Hallelujah you may be seated we have
[46:47] a right we have a responsibility to
[46:50] create the atmosphere that a minister
[46:53] could preach we should not need a song

[46:59] not need the musicians to stir us into
[47:02] action we ought to be the Revival this

[57:25] drive them out as the Lord said Judges
[57:30] chapter 1 we want to go from verse
[57:39] 28 and it came to
[57:41] pass when Israel was strong that they
[57:45] put the Canaanites to Tribute and did
[57:47] not utterly drive them
[57:50] out verse 29 neither did Ephraim drive
[57:53] out the kenites that dwell in gizar but
[57:56] the kenites dwelt in gizar among them
[57:58] neither did zebin drive out the
[58:01] inhabitants of kitron nor the
[58:03] inhabitants of n not the kenites dwelt
[58:06] among them and became tributaries
[58:07] neither did Asher drive out the
[58:09] inhabitants of Akon or the inhabitant of
[58:11] zidon no alab no asib no hilab no annik

[58:34] dwelt among the Canaanites the
[58:35] inhabitants of the land nevertheless the
[58:37] inhabitants of beses and beanas became
[58:39] tributes unto them and the amorites
[58:42] forced the children of Dan into the
[58:46] mountains for they would not suffer them

[1:02:18] the F of God coming for a church so they
[1:02:20] figure in the best group God is not
[1:02:22] coming for no group there'll be one
[1:02:24] taken and one left that between a field
[1:02:28] one will be taken one will be left so we

[1:03:10] for appointed time so you wouldn't get
[1:03:12] frustrated you wouldn't get fed up you
[1:03:15] would why did Lord ain't come yet no no

[1:03:23] wait on it I will wait till my change
[1:03:27] come oh give the Lord a shout in the
[1:03:32] H the vision itself is for an appointed
[1:03:36] time oh
[1:03:38] Hallelujah glory to God Abraham rated 25
[1:03:41] years to see Isaac come forth Noah
[1:03:44] waited 120 years to see the rain fall
[1:03:47] children Israel waited 400 years before
[1:03:50] deliverer come but God can't lie God is
[1:03:53] not a man if God say you're going to be
[1:03:55] delivered
[1:03:56] there's no devil in hell to stop that
[1:03:58] deliverance from coming and I feel
[1:04:00] somebody going to be delivered this very
[1:04:02] day this very
[1:04:04] [Applause]
[1:04:15] morning may be seated so God coming for

[1:04:45] God this prophetic Vision that was

[1:05:02] is coming there is no evidence there was
[1:05:05] no witness but Isaac still coming
[1:05:07] because God gave a vision and he had a
[1:05:10] revelation that put him on expectation
[1:05:13] and a spirit of worship that he
[1:05:15] staggered not at the promise of God to
[1:05:18] unbelief but was strong in faith giv
[1:05:21] glory to God you can't have faith and
[1:05:24] you can't worship Faith must have
[1:05:26] worship with it you could never have
[1:05:29] faith and you're dumb and you're dead no
[1:05:32] no faith is already a substance faith is

[1:06:14] different than Cain is because it was
[1:06:17] revealed to him it was a divine
[1:06:20] revelation to Abel Abel offered unto God
[1:06:24] a more excellent sacrifice
[1:06:26] and that's why Jesus come and say who

[1:06:31] say you're that opinions men thoughts he

[1:11:01] Promise all Joshua and Israel was a
[1:11:05] natural en type to a spiritual land that
[1:11:09] God promised
[1:11:13] us so he called them out of Egypt like
[1:11:16] he called us out of the world the
[1:11:19] journey is not the
[1:11:20] destination I'm sorry for some of you
[1:11:24] who expect so much thing in the
[1:11:26] journey but the journey is to a place he
[1:11:29] said I'm coming I taking you to a place
[1:11:31] that I have prepared you're going to a
[1:11:33] place along the journey you have this
[1:11:35] problem that problem but as I say you
[1:11:38] had to travel from Grenada to here to
[1:11:40] there to get to Ivory Coast that's but
[1:11:43] from Grenada to to to let's say Germany
[1:11:46] that's not the destination the
[1:11:47] destination is Ivory Coast but you're
[1:11:49] flying and stopping different places
[1:11:51] along the journey you have turbulance
[1:11:53] playing rocking a little bit fasten your
[1:11:55] seat belt you have shakes a little bit
[1:11:58] scary a little bit you land here you get
[1:12:00] out pick up your luggages you put it on
[1:12:02] there that's process but you have a
[1:12:04] destination destination is Ivory Coast
[1:12:07] destination is Dynamics destination to
[1:12:09] Holy Ghost Land destination Revival
[1:12:12] destination come on now preach back to
[1:12:13] me
[1:12:17] somebody so all the shakes along the
[1:12:21] Journey Don't let it upset you the tri
[1:12:24] of your faith
[1:12:25] being more precious than gold don't let
[1:12:28] that shake you don't let child shake you
[1:12:31] and problem don't let it shake you give
[1:12:34] the devil Romans
[1:12:36] 8:28 for we know all things what
[1:12:41] together for
[1:12:42] good to them that love God to them that
[1:12:48] call according to his purpose and the
[1:12:52] purpose of God must stand
[1:13:02] [Applause]
[1:13:07] Jesus said when the spirit of Truth has
[1:13:08] come Spirit of
[1:13:11] Truth he would lead you and guide you
[1:13:14] into all truth so the spirit of truth
[1:13:17] that is to come after the prophet could
[1:13:19] only speak according to the vision that
[1:13:22] the prophet brought so there are no new
[1:13:25] Mysteries that any man could bring there
[1:13:28] are no new Mysteries or Hidden Mysteries
[1:13:31] every mystery has been revealed it may
[1:13:35] not be revealed to you or me but it has
[1:13:38] been revealed to a prophet because the
[1:13:40] word comes to a prophet no other man can
[1:13:43] come and claim a mystery that the
[1:13:45] prophet did not reveal that's false
[1:13:48] that's contrary every mystery has been
[1:13:51] revealed it's God and a prophet but the
[1:13:54] Mysteries
[1:13:56] and the Mysterious Christ to be in you
[1:13:59] the hope of
[1:14:05] glory all right so all hell all hell
[1:14:10] will be against this prophetic Vision
[1:14:13] that is why God hate the nicolan spirit
[1:14:15] he hate ministers taking the place of
[1:14:17] God playing there at the Holy Ghost
[1:14:20] Hallelujah the Holy Ghost is a promise
[1:14:23] to you not no man the the Holy Ghost no
[1:14:26] the Holy Ghost is your promise I'll be
[1:14:29] with you but I'll be in you come on say
[1:14:32] Amen
[1:14:33] [Applause]

[1:14:57] this when Israel asks for a
[1:15:01] King Samuel dropped to the ground don't
[1:15:05] go there don't ask for that they want a

[1:17:44] you're going to break this and break
[1:17:45] this and break your pride and humble you
[1:17:48] and humiliate you because that's what
[1:17:49] Jesus did he humbled himself and became
[1:17:52] in the form of a servant and he became
[1:17:54] became obedient to the Cross then he
[1:17:56] said learn of me I'm humble and meek and
[1:17:58] lonly in heart there's a spirit of God
[1:18:02] that dwells in humility that b said the
[1:18:04] first sign of the Holy Ghost is humility

[1:30:37] hard and brother R is prophesying oh
[1:30:41] what we need in this journey that we is

[1:30:46] Feast on the word of God that it will
[1:30:49] give us strength he said before there's
[1:30:52] a great journey and a great battle ahead

[1:30:57] been children long enough God is going
[1:31:00] to turn his church into manhood now we
[1:31:03] have played and folic as children but
[1:31:06] now we're going to have to put up with
[1:31:07] childish things and take on manhood
[1:31:14] maturity who would have thought we would
[1:31:16] be here almost 50 years since the last
[1:31:19] has already
[1:31:21] come long journey yes hard journey and
[1:31:26] we are feasting on the word with the
[1:31:28] prophetic Vision that the land belongs
[1:31:31] to
[1:31:34] us listen if you see that it changes
[1:31:41] you then you're on your road to
[1:31:44] possess you can only possess what you

[1:31:54] huah amen GL Hallelujah my Hallelujah
[1:32:00] hear this one and this some brother CH
[1:32:02] send this for me just in time beautiful
[1:32:05] quote from ration chapter 5 you
[1:32:07] understand now what the seven seed book
[1:32:10] was hallelujah what it is we got it in
[1:32:13] scroll now and just remember in these
[1:32:16] last days it was kept in an Earthly
[1:32:19] vessel you understand that now who was
[1:32:23] the Earthly vessel Jesus Christ amen no
[1:32:25] man had it nobody had it it's only
[1:32:27] through him it wasn't even written in
[1:32:29] the word if it was written in the word
[1:32:30] it was hid so you couldn't even find it
[1:32:33] that's right and if it's in him that
[1:32:36] it's revealed then in that Earthly
[1:32:38] vessel it wouldn't rust or rust when he
[1:32:41] comes he pulls back one to his church so
[1:32:44] this seven SE scroll book is to be
[1:32:47] veiled in Earth vessels amen oh my it
[1:32:52] has to be veiled behind you Hallelujah
[1:32:55] so it's a little more than talk right is
[1:32:57] a little more than preaching it right is
[1:32:59] a little more than explaining it right
[1:33:01] what it is it has to be veiled in you
[1:33:03] that's why the prophet had to eat the
[1:33:04] book it was representing of taking in
[1:33:07] the word and getting the word on the
[1:33:09] inside so you have to receive the word
[1:33:11] and become the word then you Veil the
[1:33:13] word itself because you are the words of
[1:33:16] the book so you will be veiling the book
[1:33:18] itself Oh Glory to God hallelujah
[1:33:23] remember Adam had the book the book had
[1:33:25] names in it Adam was supposed to call
[1:33:27] the names but Adam fell the book went
[1:33:30] back to God but the book came back down
[1:33:34] then you like
[1:33:36] Adam God bring back the book to put it
[1:33:40] back in sons in the last days that going
[1:33:42] to call names you're going to be born
[1:33:45] into
[1:33:49] manifestation oh
[1:33:52] Jesus my God help me this morning if you
[1:33:55] know what I'm seeing this morning I'm
[1:33:57] seeing beyond your failures beyond your
[1:33:59] sin beyond your fault beyond your fear
[1:34:02] I'm seeing Suns I'm seeing seeds I'm
[1:34:04] seeing jeans I'm seeing germ I'm seeing
[1:34:06] what you are to become not what you are
[1:34:08] Oh Glory to God help me Jesus I want you
[1:34:11] to see what I'm
[1:34:18] seeing I can see why the devil fought
[1:34:21] this prophetic Vision because if you
[1:34:23] catch it you'll begin to fight with all
[1:34:26] your might you would recognize is no
[1:34:28] sitting long and just taking things for
[1:34:30] granted you're accepting your sickness
[1:34:32] yeah asking this is the cause and this
[1:34:33] is how it is Lord and and no no you stop

[1:35:03] he had to talk he just take his mantle

[1:36:18] that woman I'm more compassion than I
[1:36:20] and God used that woman to pray for the
[1:36:21] child so the prophet did not pray for
[1:36:23] the baby a woman ordinary person not
[1:36:26] Pastor wife not Bishop wife not Elder
[1:36:29] wife ordinary Soul daughter of God with
[1:36:32] faith could pray and God can answer

[1:37:51] yeah let something else come
[1:37:54] man you would run like
[1:37:58] Joseph it all depends upon the
[1:38:02] environment that's why Satan has make it
[1:38:06] nice to wheel you
[1:38:08] in but the wages of sin is still
[1:38:11] dead that's why the way is narrow and
[1:38:13] hard and that's the choice we make we
[1:38:16] choose this rugged way we ches to
[1:38:19] overcome our own selves we have to there
[1:38:21] is something called denying yourself

[1:38:52] will but thy will will be done I I wish
[1:38:56] I could push this aside but there's a
[1:38:58] cost hallelujah oh my

[1:50:34] [Music]
[1:50:37] up character is not a
[1:50:39] victory character is not a gift rather
[1:50:41] character is a victory and a victory is
[1:50:43] something that you have overcome and I
[1:50:46] see it over the years I've never seen
[1:50:47] where blessings give people character
[1:50:49] does all mean pain suffering anguish
[1:50:52] hurts
[1:50:53] this is what forms you into the image
[1:50:58] Hallelujah of God hallelujah I have seen
[1:51:01] blessings destroy people because it
[1:51:03] wasn't even prepared for
[1:51:05] iten Hallelujah that's why God could
[1:51:07] have blessed Solomon with riches you
[1:51:08] know because Solomon asked for wisdom he
[1:51:11] didn't ask for riches he asked for
[1:51:13] wisdom to govern God's people and
[1:51:14] because he asked for that God could weth
[1:51:16] put wealth on him because he have the
[1:51:18] wisdom to manage
[1:51:20] it hallu
[1:51:23] sometime when blessing come too fast and
[1:51:25] too much people go wrong because your
[1:51:27] human Spirit cannot handle it like a
[1:51:30] brother say something in the meeting was
[1:51:31] so powerful he said I don't want to know
[1:51:33] your
[1:51:34] weakness because I don't know how I
[1:51:36] could handle it I don't want to dig up
[1:51:38] and find what you do wrong and go down
[1:51:40] and no I want to know that he said
[1:51:41] because God know your weakness and he
[1:51:43] his attitude towards you doesn't change
[1:51:45] Hallelujah huj his nature towards you
[1:51:47] doesn't change but as a human we could
[1:51:49] change we could feel this way and feel
[1:51:51] that way but when God see you he looks
[1:51:54] beyond your faults he looks beyond your
[1:51:56] weakness he looks beyond your struggle
[1:51:59] when God saw Saul new testament Saul God
[1:52:03] saw him becoming Paul he was riding his
[1:52:06] high hor fighting the church killing
[1:52:10] battling all them Believers running from
[1:52:13] Saul and God see Paul coming but he
[1:52:16] riding a soul right in his high hor God
[1:52:19] knock him off his high hor who are th
[1:52:22] Lord
[1:52:23] who would have thought Saul was going to
[1:52:25] become Paul we write off the man called
[1:52:28] Saul because he fighting the church but
[1:52:31] God didn't write them
[1:52:33] [Applause]
[1:52:38] off don't write off
[1:52:43] anybody there's a real difference
[1:52:45] between opinion and
[1:52:48] judgment you could have an opinion about
[1:52:50] somebody that's fear that's fine
[1:52:53] with more information your opinion could
[1:52:54] change I didn't know this I I know have
[1:52:57] new information my opinion changed on
[1:52:59] that person but when you judge somebody
[1:53:01] put you put them in concrete there's
[1:53:03] nothing they could do because you have
[1:53:04] them fixed they could smile you still
[1:53:07] don't like
[1:53:08] them they can bring a gift for you with
[1:53:10] bow tie you still don't like them
[1:53:13] because you have an opinion and a
[1:53:14] judgment on that person thank God he's
[1:53:16] not like
[1:53:19] that he said Peter you deny me but after
[1:53:23] you
[1:53:24] converted strengthen your brethren Peter
[1:53:27] the devil want to S like
[1:53:28] wheat he could tell what going to happen
[1:53:31] he could tell when you're going to fail
[1:53:32] but he could tell when you going to be
[1:53:34] restored tell when you're going to
[1:53:35] bounce back tell when you're going to
[1:53:37] stand he can tell all about you he still
[1:53:40] chose you that's why you should be
[1:53:41] rejoicing you should be thanking God now

[1:54:40] back and pick up what they had and go
