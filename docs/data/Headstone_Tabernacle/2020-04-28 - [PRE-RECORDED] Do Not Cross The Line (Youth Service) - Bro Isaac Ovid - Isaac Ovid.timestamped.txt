[0:57] find
[1:00] [Music]
[1:03] everybody see with your hands lift it up
[1:06] [Music]
[1:07] there is none that's it like hallelujah
[1:13] glory to God no one else can touch my
[1:19] heart like you - whoa I can search
[1:28] eternity long and find there is no
[1:35] you get a lot of ham the praise this
[1:38] evening blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:43] give Him glory give him honor thank him
[1:47] for being alive thank him for being in
[1:49] the house of God thank him for being in
[1:52] his presence thank him to have breath to
[1:56] have the energy to have something on the
[1:59] inside I've brought you here tonight to
[2:02] hear from God amen blessed be the name
[2:05] of the Lord how many I appreciate by the
[2:07] Andrew Amen how many appreciate by the
[2:10] sealing with the music amen wonderful
[2:14] what I'd like to welcome you all in the
[2:16] precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:19] you may be seated for a minute it's
[2:22] certainly a great honor to be in the
[2:24] house of God tonight for this special
[2:27] youth service and I believe it's truly a
[2:30] special service for all of us and I know
[2:33] that God is going to do something
[2:34] tremendous in the lives of the young
[2:37] people here tonight you know and some of
[2:40] you may already have seen it on our
[2:43] Facebook account but I put up the
[2:46] inspiration for this huge service so
[2:49] that you can meditate on it even before
[2:51] you reach here you know and in this
[2:54] world that we're living in the enemy is
[2:56] on the attack and we have a choice
[2:59] we either allow the enemy to gain ground
[3:01] or we push the enemy back and we gain
[3:03] ground so I believe that the time has
[3:05] come for us to gain ground and do
[3:07] whatever is in our power to make a
[3:10] difference to make a change I'm tired of
[3:13] seeing young people just backslide I'm
[3:15] tired of seeing young people just give
[3:17] up hope I'm tired of seeing young people
[3:19] just move wherever the wind blows them
[3:21] and I believe the time has come for us
[3:23] to fight and first to fight back so I
[3:25] encourage you for a long time I am also
[3:29] guilty in a sense of blasting Facebook
[3:32] and there are many things about a
[3:34] Facebook that I don't like there are
[3:35] many things about Facebook that I still
[3:37] want to blast but there are also some
[3:40] positive state as well I always say a
[3:41] knife can be used to cut piece of meat
[3:44] or cut bread and what's the bread that
[3:46] same knife could be used to kill
[3:47] somebody so in a certain sense is about
[3:50] how you use the tools that are available
[3:52] to us and I believe that our Facebook
[3:56] Peter's a way for us particularly the
[3:59] young people to be kept abreast of
[4:01] what's going on and to have the
[4:02] opportunity to express yourself some of
[4:04] you are too afraid to testify and stand
[4:07] up and talk about Jesus but at least you
[4:08] could put a comment and say I love Jesus
[4:10] somebody say amen amen
[4:14] so everybody feeling fine everybody
[4:18] feeling on fire everybody come to give
[4:21] the devil problems no matter what
[4:24] situation you came through how you fell
[4:26] this week what happened all of that
[4:28] doesn't matter right now we come to do
[4:31] what we need to do for us to be where we
[4:33] need to be kinda church say Amen so I'd
[4:35] like to take this opportunity to welcome
[4:36] all the visitors in our midst
[4:38] welcome to the headstone tabernacle all
[4:40] who are here for the first time we love
[4:42] you we appreciate you thank you for
[4:44] making it out special welcome to
[4:47] everyone here and special greetings to
[4:49] all of you young people who came out
[4:51] today it is it is a sacrifice I leave
[4:53] God will bless amen amen so before we
[4:57] even get to the message tonight I found
[5:00] this quote and I thought I'd read it
[5:02] even before I read the scripture and I
[5:04] want you to think on this in a message
[5:07] making the valley full of ditches but
[5:10] the random said show me your company and
[5:12] I'll tell you who you are let me walk
[5:16] into your house let me see what's laying
[5:19] over on the table let me see how the
[5:22] Bible's mopped up let me see where it's
[5:25] all true stories let me listen to what
[5:28] kind of music you're playing on your
[5:30] radio let me see what kind of pictures
[5:34] you got in your house I'll tell you what
[5:37] you're made out of yes sir
[5:40] that's what your souls that's what your
[5:43] soul is feeding on regardless of what
[5:46] your testimony is your fruits prove what
[5:50] you are that's right oh it's the truth
[5:52] your soul feeds on something and
[5:55] whatever the characteristic of your soul
[5:58] is that is what it will show forth
[6:00] that's the
[6:01] and Jesus said by their fruit you shall
[6:03] know them somebody say man and if
[6:12] tonight you think I'm gonna do all the
[6:14] work you gotta twist it tonight you have
[6:18] to be on fire tonight you have to
[6:20] worship I am becoming more radical about
[6:25] Jesus I have a problem where the world
[6:28] is becoming more expressive of what they
[6:30] stand for and what they believe in we as
[6:32] Christians you want to be quiet and hide
[6:34] when we have the gold when we have the
[6:36] precious elements when we have the best
[6:39] thing that areas we can't hide it under
[6:41] a bushel this light has got to shine how
[6:44] can it sure it's a man
[6:45] so let's stand to our feet and let's go
[6:47] to the scripture this evening let's go
[6:57] to one scripture tonight reading from
[6:59] Isaiah 55 reading verse 6 and the Bible
[7:09] says seek he the Lord while he may be
[7:12] found call upon him while he is near let
[7:19] the wicked forsake his way and the
[7:21] unrighteous man his thoughts and let him
[7:24] return unto the Lord and He will have
[7:27] mercy upon him and to our God for he
[7:30] will abundantly pardon shall we bow our
[7:33] heads for a word of Prayer our gracious
[7:36] Heavenly Father we thank you for your
[7:38] grace you love your mercy law that has
[7:40] been extended to us as young people and
[7:42] Lord God as we pause father from the
[7:45] routine of life from the hustle and the
[7:47] bustle from working to pay the bills
[7:49] from working to to accomplish the dream
[7:52] that the vision that we might have Lord
[7:55] from going to school trying to learn
[7:56] from doing whatever it is we do during
[7:59] the time and a week we have taken this
[8:01] pause this sailor this rest Lord's a
[8:04] commune with you to hear a word that
[8:06] could bring transformation to our lives
[8:08] so wake us up to a true realization of
[8:11] what we are born for what we
[8:13] call to do Lord any man can read a
[8:15] scripture but it takes the Holy Spirit
[8:17] to breathe life upon it may you speak to
[8:19] your people here tonight and bring
[8:21] permanent change in their lives we are
[8:23] needy people tonight father we have so
[8:26] many conditions in this room this
[8:28] evening father people who are bound
[8:29] Laura lost father bound with Lord evil
[8:33] power lying and jealousy and envy and
[8:35] malice and hatred and strife father Lord

[8:40] the name of Jesus Christ father Lord we
[8:43] want me you live the weariness the
[8:45] tiredness the depression the feeling of
[8:47] loneliness of feeling of being lost and
[8:49] confused father and may you build a

[8:54] made of faith bank's rise Lord until the
[8:57] people can leave here shouting and

[9:17] Christ bless the word a reading of the
[9:19] word and blessing people in the name of
[9:21] Jesus Christ amen and amen
[9:24] you may be seated so for a title tonight
[9:30] my title is do not cross the line that's
[9:37] my tattoo tonight do not cross the line
[9:41] my subject seek here the Lord while he
[9:45] may be found and my inspiration time no
[9:50] longer and I took my title from a quote
[9:54] that brother Branham in a message but a
[9:57] Branham spoke called the deity of Jesus
[9:59] Christ and I want you to listen
[10:01] carefully I'm not going to be too long
[10:02] with you tonight but it's a pay close
[10:04] attention but the Branham said father we
[10:07] come this morning and I say this evening
[10:09] as your humble children I realize that
[10:12] we are living in the last hour closing
[10:15] time something can happen at any time
[10:17] men women boys or girls here are without
[10:22] God and I pray the Father you be
[10:25] merciful
[10:26] I pray thee to be merciful to those who
[10:28] have received and now realize that
[10:31] you're near in their hearts and I rien
[10:34] realizing that little things of the
[10:37] world through tears I pray God at every
[10:40] one of them this morning will be really
[10:43] consecrated to you for the coming days
[10:46] to come and how much longer we are going
[10:49] to wait before your coming we believe
[10:51] it's right at hand now and after a while
[10:54] listen carefully they're going to try to
[10:57] get saved and listen this is where I get
[11:00] it from
[11:00] and it's brother Branham and it it
[11:02] struck me it interrupted my sleep last
[11:06] night and by the raddimus said I'm
[11:08] thinking of those young people that
[11:10] night down there at the altar trying to
[11:15] be saved but had crossed the line no
[11:18] redemption for them they were gone could
[11:22] not be saved I'll read it again I'm
[11:25] thinking of those young people that
[11:27] night down there at the altar trying to
[11:32] be saved but had crossed the line no
[11:36] redemption for them they were gone could
[11:39] not be saved and from that I took a
[11:42] title do not cross the line my heart is
[11:49] heavy tonight
[11:50] it's burdened by what's happening all
[11:52] around us but the Branham said in a
[11:55] message influenced what we see happen
[11:57] should put every soul into action it
[12:01] should make a church that would make a
[12:03] revival young people that revival is up
[12:06] to us every single one of us here
[12:09] tonight and I'm troubled tonight because
[12:11] there's a great falling away there are
[12:15] people who were once rejoicing and you
[12:17] can't find them anymore people who were
[12:19] once happy about being with the Lord and
[12:21] you can't find them anymore there's a
[12:23] great falling away it comes as no
[12:27] surprise to us because but a Branham
[12:30] told us this was going to happen he
[12:33] spoke of a feeling out of a falling away
[12:35] of people walking away
[12:37] from their first love but even though we
[12:40] know that this was supposed to happen it
[12:43] still doesn't take away the pain when
[12:45] you see your young brother or young
[12:46] sister suffer under the task under the
[12:49] whip of the taskmaster somebody say Amen
[12:52] and I know that there are young people
[12:55] here who are on fire for God you're
[12:58] pressing on you're giving it your all
[12:59] you're doing your best you're trying
[13:01] your best you have made it in your mind
[13:03] you're going to serve God no matter what
[13:06] I know them so young people here who are
[13:08] holding on you might have your ups and
[13:10] downs you might have your questions and
[13:12] your wondering but there's something on
[13:14] the inside and that brings you and I
[13:16] salute you and I give glory to God for
[13:18] keeping you give the Lord a hand of
[13:20] praise I notice on young people here who
[13:25] are willing to fight a good fight
[13:26] they're willing to leave it all behind
[13:29] and force it all they want to serve
[13:32] Jesus but I also know that there are
[13:37] some young people here tonight and some
[13:39] young people who are here this tape who
[13:41] are living on the edge they are standing
[13:45] on the edge of a line that they don't
[13:48] even know exists wake up tonight friends
[13:53] standing on the edge of a line that you
[13:56] don't even realize is even there tonight
[14:01] we are going to speak about that line
[14:03] and it is five words that you remember
[14:07] from the service is do not cross the
[14:10] line a line is used to divide an area of
[14:14] space a line helps you to understand
[14:17] boundaries and limitations a line helps
[14:21] maintain balance and order Almighty God
[14:24] created the heavens and the earth and he
[14:26] put a line between them to separate them
[14:29] somebody help me this evening a line
[14:32] doesn't always have to be visible
[14:34] country is go to war because of a line
[14:37] that separates one country from another
[14:40] something that line you can see it where
[14:42] they go to war because they feel you
[14:44] crossed into their territory
[14:46] because you cross a line and maybe
[14:47] you'll even realize was there somebody
[14:50] help me people died because of lines
[14:54] that they cannot even see how many young
[14:57] men go to war for a country because
[14:59] across the territory and they didn't
[15:00] even know that line was there young
[15:03] people tonight there are some lines that
[15:06] are safe to cross but there are also
[15:10] some lines that are not safe to cross
[15:13] whenever there is a nuclear meltdown
[15:15] whenever there is chemical exposure
[15:18] whenever there is a viral outbreak a
[15:20] line is set up listen carefully to keep
[15:24] those who have been not affected from
[15:27] becoming affected everybody with me
[15:31] that's the line I'm speaking about
[15:33] tonight
[15:34] young brother young sister because I
[15:36] believe a line has been set up to keep
[15:39] those who have not been affected from
[15:42] becoming affected it's very serious
[15:46] tonight friends because you cross that
[15:48] line there is no cure if you cross the
[15:53] line there is no hope if you cross the
[15:55] line there is no coming back
[15:56] friends young brother young sister do
[15:59] not cross the line and by the branham's
[16:03] words he said for those who cross the
[16:05] line no redemption for them they were
[16:08] gone could not be saved where are you
[16:12] standing tonight if you are trying to
[16:16] live on the edge make sure that you do
[16:19] not cross tonight this line we are
[16:26] speaking about Church separates the Lord
[16:31] side from the devil sighs yes there are
[16:34] only two sides tonight and you must know
[16:37] where you are standing tonight friends
[16:41] you might be surprised young people how
[16:44] many other young people have already
[16:46] sold their souls to the devil if you
[16:49] don't know it witchcraft is in high
[16:52] schools in junior high schools in the
[16:54] kindergartens and young people have
[16:57] already saw
[16:58] a soul to the devil because I want to be
[17:00] successful and they want to pass an
[17:02] examination and they want to get into
[17:04] this university there is darkness all
[17:06] over the world it might surprise you to
[17:10] know how many of the entertainers and
[17:12] the singers and the musicians now sole
[17:15] their souls to the devil they have
[17:18] crossed that line
[17:19] they have already crossed a line and
[17:22] there is no salvation for them there is
[17:25] no mercy for them this is definitely not
[17:29] one of those shout for joy services
[17:31] friends it is a message of warning that
[17:36] you do not cross the line the Bible
[17:40] tells us in second Peter 3 the Lord is
[17:43] not slack concerning his promises as
[17:45] some men count slackness but is
[17:48] long-suffering to us not us you wait for
[17:51] us not willing that any should perish
[17:54] but that all should come to repentance
[17:57] so God is waited hoping that every
[17:59] single person here tonight would come to
[18:02] repent come to turn their lives around
[18:05] come to change the way you walk
[18:07] Jiji way you talk change the way you act
[18:11] but then the Bible goes on but if they
[18:13] are the Lord will come as a thief in the
[18:15] night you don't know it's coming because
[18:20] if you know the thief is coming you look
[18:21] out for him but it'll come as a thief in
[18:23] the night in which the heavens will pass
[18:25] away with a great noise and the elements
[18:27] shall melt with fervent heat because
[18:31] also in the world that are therein shall
[18:33] be burned up listen carefully seeing
[18:37] then that all these things shall be
[18:39] resolved everything around you will be
[18:42] resolved everybody paying attention
[18:45] everybody listening carefully everybody
[18:47] focused on what is being said tonight
[18:51] seeing then that all these things shall
[18:53] be dissolved what manner of persons
[18:55] ought you to be in all holy conversation
[19:00] and godliness what do you spend your
[19:05] time talk
[19:06] about how do you spend your time
[19:08] expressing yourself where is the bulk of
[19:12] your time spent that's why I opened with
[19:14] that quote where brother Branham says
[19:16] show me what you listen to show me who
[19:19] your friends are show me what you're
[19:21] doing and I'll see how close you are to
[19:23] that line the closer you are to the edge
[19:27] the further you are from God too many of
[19:32] us we're walking along the edge of that
[19:34] line and we're in danger of crossing the
[19:37] lines at night but we are seeing to not
[19:39] cross that line tonight run away from
[19:42] the line and run back into the safe
[19:45] territory run back to God run to Jesus
[19:48] Christ tonight somebody see me I believe
[19:55] that this message tonight is a final
[19:57] warning to those who will hear it there
[20:00] is no excuse tonight you know there are
[20:03] some people who just like to do what
[20:05] they want to do you know then I'd see a
[20:08] no entry sign on the street and maybe
[20:11] the street you lived your entire life
[20:13] and maybe you went out to the weekend
[20:14] perhaps and you went and spend a couple
[20:17] days in toko and Monday morning you're
[20:19] driving back home and you come to your
[20:21] Street you live there you know this
[20:23] street you know the neighborhood you
[20:25] come back home and you come to your
[20:27] street and you see a new entry sign and
[20:30] instead of you ask why it's there you
[20:33] say who put this sign in and because you
[20:37] feel you know it's your street you let's
[20:39] drive down the street because in your
[20:41] mind you tell yourself somebody made a
[20:43] mistake and put the no entry sign on the
[20:46] street and you didn't realize that
[20:48] earlier that morning some virus broke
[20:53] out on that street and that sign was a
[20:55] warning to you to keep you off of the
[20:59] street anybody with me tonight do not
[21:05] cross the line don't do your own thing
[21:08] tonight I'm not talking about the line
[21:11] that separates families and churches and
[21:14] friends I'm talking about the line that
[21:16] is a separation
[21:18] between worshipping God and worshiping
[21:21] the devil because if you're not
[21:23] worshiping God you automatically
[21:26] worshipping the devil and by the Branham
[21:29] taught us you could worship anything
[21:31] because God is the object of worship and
[21:34] whatever you spend your time doing
[21:37] becomes your God you could worship your
[21:39] car you could worship your house you
[21:41] could worship your job you could worship
[21:42] your neighbor you can worship anything
[21:44] because that's what you spend your time
[21:45] and your effort but the god I serve with
[21:49] a jealous girl he doesn't want anybody
[21:52] to share worship with him he wants all
[21:54] your worship all your praise all your
[21:57] honor all the glory because you couldn't
[21:59] even be here tonight if it wasn't for
[22:01] his grace if it wasn't for his love if
[22:03] it wasn't for his mercy have the church
[22:06] team and give the Lord a hand upraised
[22:08] tonight this message to rock your world
[22:14] tonight it's a change the way you live
[22:18] is a change the way you talking to
[22:19] change way you act because I'm I've said
[22:23] it so many times and I read a quote a
[22:25] couple weeks ago where brother Branham
[22:27] was saying people keep telling him
[22:28] they're tired of hearing him see certain
[22:31] things and by the branham's response was
[22:33] I'm tired of seeing you two the same
[22:35] things because the moment you stop doing
[22:38] these things I have a reason to stop
[22:40] seeing it but if you keep doing the
[22:43] wrong thing I'm gonna keep saying it
[22:45] until it sticks or you decide you wanna
[22:47] cross the line permanently but we're
[22:50] gonna have a perfect Church we're gonna
[22:52] have a church full of the Holy Ghost
[22:54] maybe on how a church that SCIM cannot
[22:56] stay in that church somebody say man you
[23:02] may not understand everything tonight
[23:04] and I'm trying to bring it as simple as
[23:06] possible that a two year old could
[23:08] understand and preach it back
[23:20] tonight I say unto you do not cross the
[23:24] line on this side friends where we have
[23:27] right now with this sign in this
[23:29] presence in the Word of God there's joy
[23:32] there's peace this Holy Ghost but and
[23:34] that's other side of this line I we're
[23:36] talking about is weeping wailing and
[23:38] gnashing of teeth what time do you want
[23:41] to be on young brother young sister how
[23:43] long will you clear it accord and
[23:45] entertain the enemy we're gonna say some

[23:51] deliverance to you so that you can
[23:52] receive the Holy Ghost that's what this
[23:55] service is for feeds are clean of your
[23:57] house so that a baptism of the Holy

[24:27] things up some more because the enemy is
[24:29] not holding back the devil is not
[24:31] playing games he wants your soul you
[24:33] wants to kill you so we have a reason
[24:35] tonight to fight for every young brother

[24:42] baptism of the Holy Ghost and left this

[25:12] business but as for me and my house we

[26:11] end and try to hold five Bibles so you
[26:14] could prove a point
[26:15] but I'm saying have a testimony live a
[26:17] life don't be ashamed of this gospel the
[26:21] people in the world you do what you want
[26:23] to do they identify with what they want
[26:29] identify with all the time I spent in
[26:35] prison I saw young people who had their
[26:37] identification around them all the time
[26:39] if they're in a gang all their colors
[26:42] show the gang colors all the gang
[26:44] symbols everything to identify that's
[26:47] where their house was that and you don't
[26:50] want to be identified with eternal life
[26:52] and you don't want to be identified with
[26:54] the baptism of the Holy Ghost you want
[26:56] to please some boy some girl some friend
[26:59] some neighbor with their foolishness
[27:01] when they're going to hell and play
[27:03] games with this gospel of Jesus Christ
[27:05] what's wrong with you do not cross the
[27:07] line tonight
[27:08] [Applause]
[27:10] hallelujah somebody say man tonight I
[27:13] will see to you what your father never
[27:15] said to you what your mother never said
[27:17] to you what your teacher never said to
[27:19] you and I'm speaking for heaven tonight
[27:21] do not make the mistake and cross the
[27:23] line because you'll be finished
[27:31] if I'm not making it Clary enough you
[27:33] help me wave your hand and let me know
[27:35] make it harder make it tougher make it a
[27:38] rougher so now I'm clearing the air so
[27:41] that when I see you doing your nonsense
[27:43] I can see it weren't you in church don't
[27:45] you know better than then how long the
[27:49] Bible says will you be slack concerning
[27:50] the promises how long will you live
[27:54] double-minded some of you in here said
[27:57] you're wasting your time I'm telling you
[27:59] straight because you plan to go and do
[28:01] some foolishness tonight or tomorrow or
[28:03] the next day don't waste my time to
[28:06] waste God's time I'm not here for that I
[28:10] [Applause]
[28:12] want to talk to people who want God who
[28:15] wants reality who wants to see Jesus
[28:18] Christ the same yesterday today and
[28:20] forever
[28:20] is there anybody in the house who wants
[28:23] to see the same God who wrote the word
[28:25] manifest the word in your life if that's
[28:28] how you feel stand to your feet right
[28:30] now
[28:33] [Applause]
[28:39] you may be seasoned we had a full house
[28:42] that's wonderful so I'm preaching in the
[28:45] right group tonight everybody stood up
[28:47] if somebody kept sitting I was gonna
[28:48] call the Deacons right away clear them
[28:50] out they don't belong in we're gonna
[28:55] have Church on no church at all can the
[28:58] church say man that's why the scripture
[29:01] we read said seek ye the Lord while he
[29:04] may be found in other words it's coming
[29:07] a time and you will be looking for God
[29:09] and you'll be knocking and crying out
[29:11] but he will not answer because time will
[29:13] be up friends we are running out of time
[29:18] why because eternity is getting ready to
[29:21] take over time is temporary only
[29:24] eternity is eternal can the church team
[29:28] and friends the fact that you are here
[29:34] tonight means that you have come too far
[29:37] to backslide you have come too far to
[29:42] give up you have come too far to quit
[29:45] it's the devil's job to tell you to quit
[29:48] and you know what the problem is friends
[29:51] you see this line we are pissing about
[29:53] tonight if you spend too much of a time
[29:55] living on the edge you're gonna hear all
[29:57] the voices some of the other side of
[30:00] this line but if you come away from the
[30:03] line you're gonna hear a whole different
[30:04] kind of conversation because behind you
[30:06] is a host of the angel that the Lord
[30:08] Himself and his power and the word and
[30:11] the anointing when you step away from
[30:13] this line into the presence of God every
[30:16] day gets deeper the more you in the word
[30:18] the more you in prayer the more in the
[30:19] spirit as you come away from the line
[30:21] your walk begins to change your talk
[30:23] begins to change can the church see man
[30:26] [Applause]
[30:29] so if you want to shut up the negative
[30:32] voices what do you wanna do come away
[30:34] from the line there's some friends you
[30:37] must never talk to again it's that clear
[30:41] enough no conversation no explanation
[30:44] just don't answer the phone is that rude
[30:47] no cut them off because if that voice is
[30:52] not driving you to heaven it's gonna
[30:54] drive it to hell there's only two
[30:56] options is that plain enough but I want
[30:59] to tell them nicely that I can't talk to
[31:01] them I tell them what to give every
[31:04] opportunity to get you to try to explain
[31:05] yourself you know who you are
[31:07] you don't need the experience of your
[31:09] father is the king your father owns the
[31:12] cattle on a Thousand Hills when your
[31:13] father snaps his fingers the clouds
[31:15] begin to move the sky begins to roll
[31:17] back somebody say man do you know who
[31:20] you are do you know where you come from
[31:22] do you know where you're going do you
[31:24] know what your promise is do you know
[31:26] what your ports or to in such a time as
[31:28] this somebody say man maybe you never
[31:34] heard preaching like this before we are
[31:36] not crazy
[31:37] they already tested me I passed I am
[31:48] crazy about God you got to be crazy
[31:51] about something you got to be crazy
[31:53] about something you might as well be
[31:55] crazy about God God this world but the
[31:58] brown said it's growing totally and seen
[32:00] so if the whole world quitting scene I
[32:02] want to go insane for Jesus let me talk
[32:06] about Jesus let me laugh about Jesus let
[32:08] me walk in the streets talking to myself
[32:10] seeing the Lord as good as mercy is
[32:13] everlasting His goodness enjoy it
[32:15] forever surely goodness and mercy shall
[32:17] follow me let me be called crazy for
[32:20] being identified with a God who made
[32:22] heaven and the earth somebody say Amen
[32:28] whoo how are we doing tonight trying to
[32:32] find myself so hmm I already went ahead
[32:39] of my notes I have you yes I know you've
[32:43] been coming to church and you've
[32:45] listened to all the services and the
[32:47] ministers but the reality is too many of
[32:50] us are hearing the voices from the other
[32:54] side of the line more than on this side
[32:57] of the line friends you come to church
[33:01] on a Sunday a few hours maybe you come
[33:07] in the midweek service I understand
[33:10] maybe you finish work so late by the
[33:12] time you get your service is over okay
[33:14] but that's why there is a library that's
[33:18] why there's a website that's why there
[33:21] are resources so that you have no excuse
[33:23] to miss a service it is your
[33:26] responsibility when you can be here to
[33:29] be here there is no excuse for not being
[33:32] here when you physically could be here
[33:34] if you physically cannot be here that's
[33:37] what the website and the library and all
[33:39] the other things are for because if it's
[33:43] to services a week maybe three services
[33:45] and a pre-meeting maybe you spend all
[33:48] your hours of your day here in these
[33:51] voices why don't change your shoes well
[33:55] I don't cut you here why the where is
[33:57] chin why don't try this drink why don't
[34:00] do this listen is yeah here in new
[34:02] Beyonce song get here it well I'm not
[34:05] really supposed to listen they didn't I
[34:07] know you're not really supposed to
[34:08] listen there's no but just this listened
[34:09] like two minutes and before you know it
[34:12] by Timmy Reese you're not strong still
[34:13] in the head
[34:15] isn't that right the voices of the world
[34:18] is all around you you're driving your
[34:21] car you see the sign on the street
[34:23] bombarded the music fashion the status
[34:29] all around you but you are not from this
[34:33] world so you have to heal
[34:35] protect yourself by doing what stepping
[34:38] away from the line the problem is when
[34:41] you live on the edge and you want to
[34:43] please the people in your circle that's
[34:45] why but the Branham said you wander Holy
[34:47] Ghost
[34:47] spend time with people who have the Holy
[34:49] Ghost because your conversation will be
[34:53] different you'll be either will be
[34:55] different your attitude and action this
[34:58] light is not about what you do when
[35:00] you're in service everybody here looking
[35:02] Christian right now everybody here
[35:05] looking very very coolly very sanctified
[35:09] I can look at you and see anything else
[35:12] the problem happens when you leave this
[35:14] place and you're in the world place and
[35:17] all of a sudden forget it your words
[35:20] change you know you know here you see a
[35:22] place Jesus god bless you
[35:24] I'm blessed that's highly favored you
[35:26] have all these you know these phrases is
[35:28] too blessed to be stressed you have all
[35:31] these nice phrases when somebody asks
[35:33] you how we do it
[35:33] I'm too blessed to be stressed really
[35:36] when I get to work and that's how you do
[35:37] it
[35:38] don't nobody say anything I'm
[35:43] challenging you tonight step away from
[35:46] the edge because if you spend too much
[35:49] time on the edge you are at the risk of
[35:51] crossing the line somebody say man this
[35:58] message friends is a call to action let
[36:01] these five words be your anthem if
[36:05] anybody asks you about this huge service
[36:07] you have five words to give them do not
[36:10] cross the line let these five words be
[36:14] your battle cry let these five words be
[36:17] your inspiration do not cross the line
[36:20] listen to brother Branham in a message
[36:23] beginning and ending of the the Gentile
[36:26] dispensation but the Branham said here
[36:28] now a man is permitted to travel so far
[36:32] but there is a separating line between
[36:35] life and death he must never cross that
[36:38] sea you can go on with your little
[36:41] foolishness for a while but you better
[36:44] know where the line is
[36:46] can the church seamen and we are making
[36:50] clear tonight that this line is being
[36:52] drawn out so that you know that you
[36:55] gotta change your walk
[36:57] change your talk but abandom goes on did
[36:59] the Lord ever check you on anything he
[37:02] does all of us pull the check greens say
[37:07] see that's fine enough now then you are
[37:10] better watch what you're doing from then
[37:13] on if you're stepping across towards
[37:16] that line so don't hate if light friends
[37:20] don't take this light today August 16th
[37:23] is the most important day of your life I
[37:26] read a statement this week the two most
[37:30] important days in your life are the days
[37:34] one that you are born and the second the
[37:38] day you find why and I pray that today
[37:41] is the day you find out why you were
[37:43] born what your purpose is what you are
[37:46] called to do and that you have to be in
[37:49] a presence of God for the word of God to
[37:51] be manifested in your life that you can
[37:53] live this thing out what good is Ruta he
[37:57] in the whole world and lose you so I see
[37:59] so many young people I would recommend
[38:01] later who would have University and they
[38:03] go to school and they try to become this
[38:04] or that and they lose their salvation
[38:06] they lose this so they lose their desire
[38:08] for God the one fire and they are all in
[38:10] the degree of a certificate a little
[38:12] education to turn them away completely
[38:15] a little job you pray Lord give me a job
[38:17] help me get a job lord give me a job
[38:19] when they get a job you can see them in
[38:21] church lord give me a car give me a car
[38:24] so I could drive to church when I get
[38:26] carded by the beach can see them in
[38:29] church it's the truth why they were
[38:32] always living too close to the edge
[38:34] friends the only way you could backslide
[38:37] is to be on the edge you know that's why
[38:40] I drove it always says when you
[38:41] backslide it's not because yesterday
[38:44] something happened it's all along you
[38:46] were just walking towards the line until
[38:48] one day you just kept doing what you
[38:50] were doing and you end up crossing the
[38:52] line and when you cross that line
[38:53] there's no way back can the church say
[38:57] ma'am
[38:58] so tonight we're seeing that's far
[39:00] enough if you've been moving towards the
[39:03] line August 16 2014 is the day you
[39:06] realize that you were doing the wrong
[39:07] thing and it's time to back up it's time
[39:10] to come away from the line can the
[39:12] church say men give the Lord a hand oh
[39:16] praise tonight when your friends in
[39:25] school call it to hang out do not cross
[39:29] the line when your friends tell to wear
[39:32] this wear that try this try that do not
[39:36] cross the line when your friends send
[39:40] you a picture to put up as your profile
[39:42] on Facebook do not cross the line when
[39:50] you go to the mall do not cross the line
[39:54] friends you have to know what your
[39:56] weakness is there was a brother many
[39:59] years ago he was delivered from alcohol
[40:01] he was a drinker but whenever he drove
[40:06] you know around Barataria or move around
[40:08] a healthy brewery whenever he drove
[40:11] there liked the scent of it the memories
[40:15] just hit him and for a while he had to
[40:18] like catch himself because that was his
[40:21] weakness that's why the message said you
[40:23] got a Diane rut die is when you you you
[40:27] just you know your get control of not
[40:29] doing it bharat is when the desire comes
[40:32] completely out to you so he died out he
[40:34] was able to resist it but it in rock
[40:36] completely because when he came into the
[40:38] environments if you leave him too long
[40:40] yet the driving fast if you have a
[40:42] traffic diary of a problem if you have a
[40:45] traffic jam you might lose them so you
[40:49] have to know what if I could user will
[40:52] your kryptonite is this is Superman have
[40:55] a kryptonite word this is service
[40:56] tonight boy reach Superman if you know
[41:01] Superman had kryptonite which is his
[41:03] weakness the thing that affected him you
[41:06] have to know what your kryptonite is
[41:08] some of us we have
[41:10] from kryptonite some overseas the music
[41:12] forget it when did he release a track
[41:16] waka flocka and all of them to jeans you
[41:22] name it
[41:23] when didn't you mix team come out forget
[41:26] it you can't find you in Chile for two
[41:28] weeks when is the Grammys at the Oscar
[41:34] and you was the outfit that said you
[41:35] they are lusting after the outfit you're
[41:36] wishing about a dress you know if your
[41:38] mother only go away for a week you're in
[41:40] it the inside if everybody have your own
[41:44] kryptonite the music in fashioned detest
[41:48] it that whatever it is the movies he
[41:51] shows the books whatever it is you have
[41:53] to know how to protect yourself from it
[41:55] because that's what keeps you on the
[41:57] edge of the line and listen but the
[42:01] Branham says the devil is entitled to
[42:03] that punch you know so if you knows what
[42:06] your weakness is you don't you have to
[42:08] understand the devil will inspire
[42:09] beyonds in a singer song just for you in
[42:11] when she tried to make a platinum record
[42:14] for the world is you are the target you
[42:18] won you yes you so if you know your
[42:24] kryptonite but the problem said it like
[42:26] this the devil will only attack your
[42:27] weak spot so if you know it's your weak
[42:30] spot you have to close all the gaps in
[42:33] your life to protect you somebody same
[42:36] and the safest thing to do is come away
[42:41] from that line that's why I said
[42:44] something you need to take it cell phone
[42:46] tonight and either troit any trash or
[42:48] delete all the contacts of people who
[42:51] know your change your phone number
[42:53] defriend the people on Facebook a little
[42:55] NAT this week because you don't want
[42:59] them to be a friend anymore
[43:03] this is rough no it is not rough this is
[43:07] you're protecting your soul something
[43:09] that's precious to you why you do not
[43:11] want to cross the line somebody say
[43:14] ma'am everybody getting this tonight
[43:19] well I'm talking about lying so many
[43:22] by the grace of God tonight when you see
[43:25] any kind of line you'll remember this
[43:26] message I wrote it in my notes when you
[43:29] see a clothes line you say to cross the
[43:31] line I wanted to be so real to you they
[43:35] say I across an aiding an arai so
[43:41] tangible this must be come to you
[43:43] tonight
[43:46] forgive me tonight if I don't sound too
[43:48] deep or too spiritual I could have
[43:51] brought up message tonight a deep
[43:54] message but I tangle for the Ministry of
[43:56] the Spirit to rightly divide a would we
[43:59] need to hear tonight because I've come
[44:01] to the realization we have a lot of
[44:02] people in the message who are not really
[44:05] saved they are not saved because if they
[44:09] were saved it wouldn't be be even how
[44:11] they behave they would not be acting how
[44:13] they act the only claim is there in the
[44:15] message that's why you can't judge a
[44:17] group or church by the believers you
[44:21] have to judge it by the word if the
[44:23] judge how the ministers steer with the
[44:25] word has revealed by God's prophet can
[44:28] the church say man you know this quote
[44:32] from a message in is of the Covenant but
[44:34] a corpsman in 1981 said and you young
[44:37] people the devil is telling you that you
[44:40] didn't taste the world yet wait a little
[44:42] longer and you keep waiting and you're
[44:45] gonna wind up in the Tribulation Period
[44:46] in hell because they ain't no more time
[44:49] yet no more time left
[44:51] I'm no longer the deer you hear my voice
[44:53] harden not your young hands I'm not
[44:57] gonna be too much longer with you
[44:58] friends if you cross the line you can't
[45:02] get the Holy Ghost if you cross the line
[45:04] you can't be adopted if you cross the
[45:07] line
[45:07] there's no rapture for you so many
[45:11] people have allowed situations in their
[45:13] lives so lead them to doubt God to doubt
[45:17] the Prophet to doubt the Bible to doubt
[45:20] the message of the hour don't make that
[45:23] mistake friends do not cross the line
[45:26] Danielle had a choice
[45:29] he prayed so much that he say let's make
[45:32] a war
[45:34] that whoever pray in whatever way that's
[45:37] not how we want them to which won him an
[45:42] alliance then he had a choice he could
[45:44] have crossed that line in his day and
[45:46] given up on what he believed but he held
[45:48] his ground the three Hebrew boys had a
[45:51] choice they could have crossed the line
[45:53] like everybody else but they said we
[45:55] will not bow down God give us some more
[45:57] young people who will not cross the line
[45:59] and give up what is the truth and what
[46:02] is right friends
[46:06] crossing the line is a choice you have a
[46:09] choice tonight but around them in a
[46:12] message God's provided away and I had
[46:15] put this up on our Facebook page earlier
[46:18] this week but the bottom said it's not
[46:20] necessary that any man will go to hell
[46:22] and God don't send no one to hell
[46:27] he said you send yourself to hell
[46:30] God's done everything in the world he
[46:33] can to put you from going to keep you
[46:36] from going to hell and yet you
[46:38] determined to go to hell you fight over
[46:41] every bearing if God puts in your way
[46:43] you just go right on over it I don't
[46:46] believe in this I don't believe in this
[46:48] I don't believe in this I told me leave
[46:50] a cock-up in here I don't believe I can
[46:52] wear these pants I don't believe I can
[46:53] do this
[46:54] I don't believe a college study music
[46:55] it's at a bank are going through why I
[46:57] got a city love song I totally but the
[47:05] random said no there's a red light here
[47:07] in the city and it turns red and green
[47:09] that tells you when you can stop and go
[47:13] if you run it well don't blame the city
[47:15] they put the light up there for your
[47:18] protection but if you run on through it
[47:20] that's up to you it's you you you
[47:23] brought your own judgement friends today
[47:27] come back into the presence of God come
[47:30] away from that line tonight it's always
[47:33] a choice it is a choice tonight God is
[47:36] not going to choose for you young
[47:38] brother young sister but the Brandon
[47:40] taught us that in the year of Jubilee
[47:42] you could go free if you want to go free
[47:45] anybody knows that
[47:46] in the year of Jubilee what was yours
[47:49] had to come back to you in the year
[47:52] Jubilee the devil had to let you go we
[47:55] know this but when the brand of also
[47:57] taught us that there was a choice
[47:59] there was a line if you cross that line
[48:02] you will see to the slave owner you
[48:05] don't want to be free your ear was
[48:09] pierced as a sign that you had crossed
[48:12] the line there was no redemption for you
[48:15] you were gone
[48:17] you could not be saved the Jubilee
[48:20] trumpet could be sounding right next to
[48:22] you but you had crossed the line it's no
[48:26] longer apply to you
[48:28] I warn you tonight in the name of Jesus
[48:31] Christ do not cross the line we always
[48:36] preach about the Jubilee about being
[48:38] free but whatever those who cross the
[48:41] line it was said that the slave owners
[48:44] tried different ways to encourage us
[48:47] leaves to stay and I can't help but
[48:51] wonder if those who cross the line those
[48:55] who chose to steal I wonder if they had
[48:59] any regrets
[49:00] imagine for all their lives they lived
[49:03] knowing a Jubilee was coming they live
[49:07] knowing that it was hope they live
[49:09] knowing that there was a possibility
[49:10] that they could be free and friends it
[49:13] is the possibilities and the hopes that
[49:16] give us a reason to live it is the
[49:19] possibility that this mortal could put
[49:22] on immortality that keeps us coming to
[49:24] church it is the possibility that you
[49:27] don't have to be sick anymore that keeps
[49:29] you coming here but the Branham said
[49:32] missing limbs will be restored there's a
[49:34] possibility if you're missing a hand or
[49:37] missing a leg it could be restored
[49:39] because that's the God we serve
[49:42] it is the possibilities and hopes that
[49:46] keeps us going and the greatest hope
[49:48] which is Christ in you the hope of glory
[49:51] so friends these sleeves were the entire
[49:54] lies they had lived with the purpose
[49:57] that could only come with knowing that
[49:59] one day they could be free but as the so
[50:02] far the trumpet of the Jubilee is
[50:04] sounded no they have a choice and I
[50:07] believe it's trumpet is sounding tonight
[50:09] for some of you young people and you
[50:11] have the same choice friends as I was
[50:14] meditating on this message I'm writing I
[50:17] said it is difficult to understand
[50:20] it is difficult why after being forced
[50:23] to be a slave you had no choose
[50:25] willingly to be one and friends in our
[50:30] teas it is because Adam fell in sin that
[50:33] we were born in sin we had no control
[50:36] over our birth but why would you
[50:40] willingly choose to stay in sin when you
[50:42] could be born again why would you
[50:45] willingly want to do the same thing keep
[50:48] the same or life when its power in the
[50:51] name of Jesus to break every team to
[50:53] take that evil out of you to give you
[50:55] the Holy Ghost and fire to give you a
[50:57] new walk a new talk a new life I'm
[51:00] living seed virtue knowledge temperance
[51:02] patience godliness brotherly kindness
[51:04] and charity I can't figure out but after
[51:14] being asleep for the entire lives when
[51:17] freedom was now made available without
[51:20] money without price they would choose to
[51:22] continue to live the same way they had
[51:25] been living by doing what by crossing
[51:29] the line from life unto death but the
[51:35] Branham said in a message of ten virgin
[51:36] and a hundred and forty-four thousand
[51:38] but the banner said what do you mean by
[51:41] the Branham listen carefully if you hear
[51:44] the gospel truth and you refuse to walk
[51:47] in it then God marks your ear where you
[51:51] will never hear it no more you have
[51:54] crossed the line between life and death
[51:56] then you'll call it your organization
[51:59] your denomination the rest of your days
[52:01] forever so friends it's a warning to
[52:04] every one of us to change how we live
[52:08] not what we
[52:10] but change how we live full message this
[52:14] day the script is fulfilled but a madam
[52:15] said what a perfect example it is of the
[52:19] gospel of Jesus Christ when it's preach
[52:22] the acceptable time and the time of
[52:24] Jubilee anybody no matter who you are
[52:26] what color you are what denomination you
[52:29] belong to how far you've stooped in sin
[52:31] or what's wrong with you
[52:33] you can go free when you hear the gospel
[52:36] trumpet sound out you are free but
[52:39] listen but if you turn your back upon
[52:42] the message and refuse to hear it notice
[52:46] you were bored in your ear with an all
[52:48] that means is here if you have crossed
[52:51] the line between grace and judgment and
[52:53] you will never hear the gospel again
[52:55] you'll never get any further you must be
[52:59] a slave to the system you're in the rest
[53:01] of your days if you refuse to hear the
[53:04] acceptable year friends tonight the Holy
[53:07] Spirit is speaking tonight you know
[53:10] brother Ovid spoke to me I believe it's
[53:12] early this morning and he was actually
[53:15] me what type of response I expect to get
[53:17] from the young people and I said to him
[53:19] beloved if it's one place comes tonight
[53:22] I will preach as hard as I can to that
[53:25] one person because I believe that it is
[53:27] one person here there's always one
[53:30] person who God is gonna speak and arrest
[53:33] your lies you make sure you beat at one
[53:36] person tonight you make sure you're that
[53:39] one person if there's one person to make
[53:42] their calling and election sure you be
[53:44] that one person tonight to make the
[53:47] choice I have decided to follow Jesus no
[53:50] turning back no turning back the Holy
[53:54] Spirit is speaking tonight the Holy
[53:57] Spirit is doing something tonight listen
[54:01] to what brother Branham said listen
[54:02] carefully because for you to grow in God
[54:05] you have to know exactly what the word
[54:07] said but the Benham says in a message
[54:09] greater than Solomon is here and when
[54:11] you see the Holy Spirit doing something
[54:13] like he's doing right now and you make
[54:15] fun of it you play games with it you
[54:18] take it lightly you take it for granted
[54:20] listen you have crossed the line
[54:22] that you will never cross back again it
[54:26] will never be forgiven you so friends
[54:29] this is very serious tonight it's the
[54:32] time of decision for every single one of
[54:35] us here I'm about to close I'm on my
[54:37] last but it's evening Gary to come
[54:39] up in a message God's power to transform
[54:44] but the Branham said that's the say it's
[54:47] God's holy word if we disbelieve
[54:52] willfully in other words you make a
[54:55] choice after what you heard tonight if
[54:58] you choose after this message tonight if
[55:02] we disbelieve willfully after we have
[55:06] seen it and heard it then we across the
[55:09] line
[55:10] there'll be never no more forgiveness
[55:12] for it you have crossed the line oh you
[55:15] see God still blesses me but if Adam
[55:18] said oh yeah but the Branham said
[55:21] remember Israel the borderlines when God
[55:24] give them a promise over in the Holy
[55:26] Land in the land it was good of milk and
[55:28] honey
[55:29] when Moses sent out Caleb and Joshua and
[55:31] the spies to go on spiderland
[55:33] and brought back the vindicated evidence
[55:36] and ten of them said we cannot do it
[55:38] we're unable look at how difficult it is
[55:41] and Joshua and Caleb said we are more
[55:44] than able to do it God made the promise
[55:47] he said and remember the turn back that
[55:49] was kiddush pioneer and it turned back
[55:52] and become Wanderers in the wilderness
[55:54] and every one of them died lost
[55:57] eternally jesus said so don't cross that
[56:00] separating line see listen carefully
[56:03] when you know to do good and do it it
[56:05] not to you it's a sin friends the time
[56:09] has come for action the time has come to
[56:13] believe or don't believe that separating
[56:17] line comes to every man or woman it
[56:20] comes to every child
[56:24] sometimes when you pass that line
[56:26] there's only one thing left
[56:27] that's judgment when you pass between
[56:30] mercy and judgment when you pass that
[56:33] line friends move away from that line
[56:36] tonight let's stand to our feet
[56:39] [Music]
[56:55] you have a choice tonight friends like I
[57:00] said some of us we're not doing too
[57:03] badly we're fighting with all that we
[57:06] got but there are too many of us we've
[57:09] been living on the edge some of us we
[57:12] are pushing our foot so close to the
[57:13] edge we're just on the line right now
[57:16] maybe you wanted them tonight you're on
[57:18] the line you know your situation you
[57:20] know your condition I'm challenging
[57:24] every one of you tonight to make a
[57:27] declaration of God Lord tonight is my
[57:31] night today is my day I'm coming home
[57:36] I'm coming back to my first love I'm
[57:39] willing to do whatever it takes to do
[57:41] law but I don't want to cross the line
[57:44] Lord I don't want to cross the line I
[57:47] can imagine how painful it was for
[57:48] brother branham as he said I'm thinking
[57:51] of those young people on that night down
[57:55] there at the altar trying to be saved
[57:58] but had crossed the line
[58:00] god help us no redemption for them they
[58:04] were gone could not be saved and I and I
[58:06] think of Noah when God shut the door
[58:09] Noah was in the ark and for years he had
[58:11] preached today was gonna rain but nobody
[58:13] really believed him but in all of a
[58:15] sudden the rain began to fall and the
[58:18] people who were outside he acted scream
[58:21] out Noah open the door
[58:23] so we could get saved but it was too
[58:26] late they could not be saved the time of
[58:30] grace the time of Mercy the time of
[58:34] salvation was over friends time is
[58:37] running out today could be your last day
[58:42] your last day your very last day I'm not
[58:45] even reaching tomorrow yet to take be
[58:48] your last day to make things right today
[58:51] could be your very last day to move away
[58:55] from my life before Judgment strikes you
[58:57] but Abraham said when you cross the line
[59:00] you could still be in church and you
[59:02] don't even know that you're finished
[59:04] come to church every Sunday and you
[59:06] could never make it because you already
[59:08] crossed the line friends where are you
[59:11] standing tonight maybe you've been
[59:14] living in sin but you don't need to live
[59:16] in sin anymore
[59:18] maybe you've been living at you know
[59:20] what's right you don't need a preacher
[59:21] to tell you that's right and that's
[59:23] wrong you know it you've heard it long
[59:24] enough everyone in here you know what's
[59:28] the truth you know what's right maybe
[59:31] you haven't been studying the message
[59:32] that you should or read in the Bible as
[59:34] you should of praying as you should
[59:35] you've been living so long in the edge
[59:38] you know more worldly songs and church
[59:41] songs you have more worldly friends and
[59:44] church friends you have more worldly
[59:46] clothes and church clothes you have more
[59:48] worldly desires and desires were God
[59:51] [Music]
[59:53] check yourself tonight
[59:55] come away from the edge tonight and come
[59:58] back to God
[1:00:00] because you do not want to cross the
[1:00:04] line
[1:00:06] I'm gonna challenge you tonight every
[1:00:08] head bowed every eye closed the Holy
[1:00:13] Spirit is already here don't make fun of
[1:00:17] them don't play games with him he said
[1:00:20] if you play games you make fun of this
[1:00:22] thing you you already crossed the line
[1:00:24] I'm gonna challenge every one of you if
[1:00:29] you have been living on the edge
[1:00:31] and you want to make your life right
[1:00:33] with God you begin to talk to God right
[1:00:35] now
[1:00:37] and I want to challenge you because I
[1:00:39] believe us brother branham said you have
[1:00:41] to do something for someone to happen
[1:00:43] you have to take a stand because if you
[1:00:46] stand for gardial he'll stand for you
[1:00:49] and I don't like to preach a message
[1:00:51] like this without giving people the
[1:00:53] opportunity to come to the altar because
[1:00:55] brother Bannon spoke about young people
[1:00:58] down they re also try to be saved but
[1:01:01] they had crossed the line but I believe
[1:01:02] tonight tonight you could come to the
[1:01:07] altar and you could be saved you can
[1:01:11] come to the altar and you can be
[1:01:13] restored you can come to the altar and
[1:01:16] you could be delivered you can come to
[1:01:18] the altar and the piece that you lost
[1:01:20] can be restored you might have come in
[1:01:23] here backslidden you're in charge but
[1:01:26] your back slid the other church and you
[1:01:28] back sitting but you didn't need to

[1:01:36] is there anybody here tonight you've
[1:01:40] been living on the edge and you want to
[1:01:42] see a Lord take me back Lord it is how
[1:01:45] you feel I want you to come to the altar
[1:01:47] right now as a declaration I'm coming
[1:01:49] home I don't care where you're at I
[1:01:51] don't care where you went you come to
[1:01:53] the altar right now you're tired of

[1:02:04] to the holy ghost he knows who needs to
[1:02:06] be up here right now

[1:02:10] you go home without making it right and
[1:02:12] you know there things to be made right

[1:02:21] you off if you need to be here you come
[1:02:24] to the altar right now you've been
