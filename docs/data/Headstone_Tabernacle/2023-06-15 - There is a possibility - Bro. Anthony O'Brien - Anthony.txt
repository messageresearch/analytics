Samson and we want to kind of zoom in on this here A bit tonight see what the Lord will speak to us Judges chapter 16 verse 27 says now the house was full of men and women and all the Lords of the Philistines were there they were upon the roof about 3 000 men and women that beheld while Samson made sport and Samson called unto the Lord and said oh Lord God remember me I pray thee and strengthen me I pray thee only this once oh God that I may be once Avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes and Samson took hold of the middle pillars upon which the house stood and on which it was born up of the one with his right hand and of the other with his left and Samson said let me die with the Philistines and he bowed himself with all his might and the house fell upon the Lords and upon all the people that were therein so the dead which he slew at his death were more than they which he slew in his life may God that blessing to the reading of his word let's just bow our heads as we pray just

you gotta break in the middle of the week to to to to to rest back on the Promises of God Amen and to kick back once in a while isn't that right you get a little time out in a ring Breeze go together drink a water he meant to go back into the fight Amen to get a fake charge in your soul to give the devil his answer on Thursday morning amen amen praise God ready or not here he's coming oh honey so you got to be ready amen so praise God see if you're up against the ropes tonight I pray this message will be for you tonight amen to give you a chance well I have a title my title is there is a possibility there is a possibility and my subject is opportunity disguised as adversity amen opportunity disguised as adversity and more and more uh as I as as I see the days as I live through each day and as God shows me and I I hope he shows you too that uh life is filled ups and downs it's filled with ins and outs and that's just the way that it's been set up had things progressed from Eden without the fall we would not have been in this kind of uh testing ground or in this kind of you know adverse condition um that the world is in but God has set it up that we have to make a choice you know and that's just the way it is God has presented his word to us his truth to us and the devil has presented his lie and so it's up to us to make a choice whether we're going to choose God's truth or we're going to choose the devil's lie Adam when he fell by sin he had to first let go of the word in order to receive the devil's lie and that's that's the way it is and in order for you to overcome you have to let go of the devil's lie and grab a hold of God's truth pray but you're either holding on to one or the other isn't that right and you have to make a choice every day to choose to follow Jesus to choose to fight for the truth to choose to contend for the Fate that was once delivered to the Saints every day we make that choice and every day we are faced with adversity we are faced with trials we are faced with Temptations we are faced with thorns and thistles he isn't that right The Garden of Edo is a beautiful place but then there come a point where God said that because man had sinned and was driven out of the Garden of Eden thorns and thistles shall the ground grow unto thee pain and torment and sorrow and and heartache can burden was introduced to the world that didn't know this heartache and didn't know about all this burden and and pain but but God has it set up that way because it is in this condition of adversity that we find that we find opportunity in this condition called adversity in a condition of Misfortune and I always find it so almost paradoxical that it is in these types of conditions that God finds his opportunities to speak to us in our lives if things were a Bed of Roses you wouldn't understand the fullness of God's love and grace and mercy because you would have it easy you wouldn't have anything to fight for you wouldn't have anything to struggle for you wouldn't have anything to battle for and to grind for and to hope for how could you miss something that isn't gone so then therefore man had to Fall by sin all they got to come into a condition where they begin to miss something and every man that's walking around the earth tonight that doesn't have the Holy Ghost that doesn't have Jesus in his life that doesn't have the reality of God in his life is missing something tonight and he will spend his entire life looking for it searching for the thing that satisfies the longing Soul the thing that satisfies the longing Hearts he looks for it in education he looks for it in science he looks for it in technology he looks for it in Civilization he looks for it in Creature Comforts but he can find no place to rest his head because the only place that you can find rests tonight is in Jesus Christ or while he is the only thing he is the only one who can give you rest in your soul rest in your spirits he said come unto me all who are heavily Laden and I'll give you rest tonight oh hallelujah hallelujah people leave it do you understand that there are lots of people tonight walking around the world without resting their Spirits they're Restless oh Holland they look into things to fulfill their satisfaction they're looking for things to satisfy the longing in their soul and the devil can find a million things for you to occupy your time which and for you to occupy your spirit with and for you to occupy your soul which but I thank God when his hand reached down and showed me something else showed me a vision that was bigger than me it was bigger than you it's a world that is far greater far more real than the one you are sitting in right now in this world has no pain in this world has no sorrow and this world has no torments oh Hallelujah and that's the world that we come from and that's the world we are going back to tonight oh somebody say Amen oh Hallelujah Hallelujah so since the fall of Adam this world has been set up in a way that is meant to truly test the strength of one's character because there's every kind of spirit every kind of adversity every kind of Twisted logic every type of hybrid religion that is designed to influence your mind is designed to invade your emotions it is designed to interfere with your spirits so that to begin to think things and try to use your conscience to navigate this world around you some people try to use reasoning Powers some people try to use their affection some people try to use their emotion but these are misleading because they are come from the world oh and we are not of the world we are in the world tonight but we are not of this world because there's something inside of your soul that God put inside of your heart from since before the foundation of the world and it is because of this something it is because of this sea that is inside of you that is the only reason that you can have faith tonight in the word of God because God put it there excuse me and that is what gets a victory every time now character is not a gift it's a victory isn't that right it's a victory that is one true trial and Circumstance true painful experiences I don't want you to cringe tonight because this is the word you know it human beings we don't like discomfort we don't like discomfort and that's reasonably so because we come from a world that didn't have all this discomfort we long for for Comfort we do we want to be comforted we we will born into a condition that was comfortable this when we talk about Adam and Eve and the Garden of Eden and so on with a comfortable setup everything was fine every need was provided for everything man ever wanted was already there God said the seed is in itself in the earth to produce every herb and every tree to feed any animal to feed every person to feed everyone that would ever come upon the Earth God had the potential in the earth already for every herb to to bring healing to to to isn't that right isn't that right animals know what grass to eat in order to get healed from certain ailments and diseases God God have everything set up praise God from long long time is this we're hitting wisdom that's built into everything that you see around you nature takes care of itself isn't that right I heard someone say one time he said notice how nature is never in a hurry but it accomplishes everything in time the trees bring forth in their season and then their buds and the flowers bloom in their time and in their season and when the time for the flowers to disappear it changes to another season and God is in charge of all these seasons and these times and these dispensation in our lives he's the one who put it so from the beginning and he knows what season you are going through sometimes you go through a dry spell sometimes you feel like you pray and nobody's hearing you sometimes you feel like your prayer and your prayers hitting a wall but that is only God testing you to see if you will continue with this Christianity thing or if you're going to fall up or if you're gonna give up or if you're gonna throw in a towel or if you're gonna say though he slay me yet will I trust him even though I can't see him with my eyes something in my heart tells me he's real and I don't care what nobody tells me I don't care what the reasoning of man I don't care what wisdom of this world they can never persuade me a difference from what I already know in my heart to be the truth this gospel must be preached and then the end shall come don't tell me about any other gospel I want to know about the gospel that Jesus preached I want to know about the gospel that brother Branham was sent to restore resource back to this page that was once delivered to the Saints oh hallelujah hallelujah he sent a prophet to bring you back the signs and wonders bring you back to Miracles bring you back to Healing bring you back to Deliverance bring you back to the baptism of the Holy Ghost and Fire bring you back to the absolutes bring you back to the typos oh what's supposed to be controlling and leading the church today is not the wisdom of man but it is the power of the Holy Ghost it's supposed to lead the church and that's what we're being driven back to oh somebody say Amen oh Hallelujah the prophet lamented he said of the Holy Ghost and if a man being changed and being born again scarcely anything is being said about it and that's almost a condition we come into today where the groups and the different ones are falling away from what's supposed to be the truth not upholding it isn't that right almost a great falling away as it were from the original gospel but it seems just about that hour when it seems most adverse when the condition seems most dread there is a possibility there is a possibility tonight that God could do Miracles he never stopped doing Miracles he's a miracle working God God waits for adverse times adverse conditions when it seems like man give up on God when it seemed like they want nothing about God when it seemed like nobody wants to do the right thing that's the opportunity that God loves to have because when the night is darkest that's when the morning stars shine the brightest and those morning stars are predestinated to reflect the oncoming Sun oh and that sun is Jesus Christ the same yesterday the same today the same forever and God is going to have a church tonight that's going to reflect the glory of this oncoming sun with signs with wonders with Miracles with Revival with prayer meetings when people calling out on God when people are being filled with the Holy Ghost we will be uncircumcised cut off the Flesh in the heart and the Holy Ghost is getting ready to drop in right in on you right in this adverse condition oh Hallelujah still trying to build here amen my so God had to have a situation that presented itself almost as adverse or Miss Unfortunate or almost seem like you know completely opposite to the truth and it's right in that situation it's actually a time for God it is a time of opportunity that's amazing you know they say you never miss the well water you never miss the water until the well-run dry sometimes God let the situation go on until it come almost hopeless until it come almost crazy isn't that right and then he does something different then he does something new his nerd Hallelujah and he does something watch that you cannot do for yourself you bring it to a point where it's almost unredeemable you know or irreparable can it be repaired seemingly and then he comes in remarkably miraculously he repaints the thing that was broken he he Bridges the Gap that was reached he he makes a way where there seemed to be no way 400 years without a prophet but all of a sudden here come a Virgin Mary walking down the road and this was the Fulfillment of Isaiah's word that said a virgin shall conceive and bring forth a son his name would be Emmanuel and Prince of Peace and so forth but yes they just lay without an open vision for years just in Traditions of men in the sect of the Pharisees and the Sadducees and men with tall hats and acting out their religion praise God but inside them was like ten men's bones But Here Comes somebody on the earth light struck the urge all of a sudden for years it was dead in the message yes it was dead in Israel but then all of a sudden God began to something different God saw an opportunity to bring his lights in a fallen world and I so thank God tonight that in my adverse condition in my Brokenness in the shadows of My reality God brought his lights into my heart that's the only reason that I made it here tonight is because God saw an opportunity in my adversity that he brought his love to me he revealed his word to me he showed me that I am his own oh what have got devil tonight can stop you can separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus there is no sickness there's no disease there's no power and hurts that can separate you the night from the love of God God saw an opportunity to save someone that was lost oh Hallelujah that was me tonight I was you that was me that was you isn't that right one time a preacher had a bird cage he brought it to the Social Service and he rested it down on the pulpit and he said I just got this bird cage from a young man a real Wicked young man caught a bunch of birds he said he told a young man what are you gonna do with those birds young man said I'm gonna take a long meal and I poke them stick them until they die and they ended in a cage and the preacher said how much for the birds and the young man said they're not for sale this is my thing to play with he said how much you want for the birds young man said give me a hundred dollars and I'll give any words give it to him he gladly took the money and ran away and left the creature with the cage preacher took the cage out to a field somewhere he let the birds go and they went free and he said I was a bird in that cage once because the devil had me and he didn't want to let me go but Jesus came by one day and he said how much for the bird you let them go and the Bible says like a bird out of the snare of the Fowler we are escaped oh Hallelujah out of the hand of the wicked one you are escaped oh hallelujah hallelujah he overcame so that you could overcome tonight oh Hallelujah I was one of them Birds I was caught in sin in a valley of church but tonight I am delivered because he came and paid a price that I could never pair he came and gave the devil his answer oh Hallelujah and when hope running and he didn't know that he let go The Greatest Prize that this world has ever seen Jesus died for you to come to Perfection to bring on this Resurrection oh Hallelujah he knew what it costs but he was willing to pay that price and to let you free so that you could be all that you were meant to be in God amen amen that's who we are tonight oh Hallelujah we in the devil's clutches but Jesus set us free we were in the prison house but God came and broke our chains we were all messed up in our minds we thought we was going all right we thought we were okay but we didn't know how messed up how naked how poor how blind and how miserable we was but then God came like the prophet said then Jesus came then Jesus came walking by and when Jesus comes something always takes place when Jesus passes by the Sick cannot stay sick when Jesus comes around the spirit cannot stay dead the cannot say because it's Jesus that we're talking about in him his life and his life is the light of man and we walk in that light tonight Jesus the light of the world he's here to fill you tonight he's there to feel you tonight he's here to live with you tonight he's here to open the prison bus and to set you free if you would only open up your Gates tonight lift up your hands worship him give him praise give him honor give him glory lift up your Gates tonight say open up he Gates and let the king of glory come into your heart and life oh pull him closer to you say Lord I need you in my heart I need you in my life I need you in my walk I need you because I have facing adversity and I can't do it on my own her present sufferings is an opportunity for God to do something in all lives that brings him the glory it's not right it's in the beginning when God created a will and everything in it that initial setting was perfect ly as God wanted it and it was peaceful like that for a season there's pizza for like like that for a Time but then sin come into the picture God allowed that to bring this this confusion so that he could unconfuse it praise God Amen with himself with his word with his presence and show the difference between right and wrong amen isn't that right because in that condition it was no wrong until sin came in the picture then there was a need for righteousness then there was a need for Holiness then there was a need for a sacrifice because man had sinned and his life was required but another life took his place another life became a substitute for him praise God and that's how we are here tonight we're not here by some flops we're not here by some chance we're not here by some mistake or by some accident we are here because God loved us and God paid a price for us to be here tonight he made a way for us he broke the dark hands of the enemy and brought you out of the Maori clay and put your foot on a rock oh hello you ought to come into the house of God every day and give God prays as long as you are Breton your lungs that's not my breaths that is the breath he gave in my lunch for me to praise my God and I will praise him while I have my being I will shout for the praises of his glory tell the world how much he means to me amen do you believe it's in it Hallelujah so the animal kingdom went here wire all creation went into confusion because a man that God had set in the garden has fallen out of position isn't that right and it seemed like an unfortunate event to the natural eye isn't that right but it seemed like a sad day but when God looked down he saw an opportunity for him now to himself to be a redeemer because he wasn't a redeemer before that time but now he had an opportunity to be a redeemer he had an opportunity to be a Healer he had an opportunity to be a leader to be a father to be a guide to be El Shaddai the breasted one to nurse his children back to health to nurse them back to strength because they had fallen from off the line and he alone had what was needed to redeem them back to himself he alone had the answer he was caught in his finest moment his opportunity to show himself to be strong to be a loving father you wouldn't know what love was and unless you experienced hate wouldn't know what Joy was unless you had experienced pain there are some songs that the Angels cannot sing because they don't know what it is to come through the buck and the Maya of this world they don't know what it is to be hated of man to be despised and to be cast aside to be misused and to be mistreated to be abused even though you're right even though you have the rights you still take wrong instead for the sake of peace they don't know what it's like to go to the Tempest of life to be pulled this way and that's or they don't know what it's like but you know what it is you know Grace that saved the Wretch like Me I wasn't always good I once was lost but I know someone that was greater than me here oh Hallelujah by my griefs and he broke my chains and set me free he's not right oh Hallelujah you saw an opportunity to do something he hadn't done before isn't that right praise God so God is the god of possibilities he makes a way where there seems to be no way that's what he is tonight isn't that right he is away making God it's not right so he presents himself as the answer to the question as the resolve Amen to this conflict amen that is happening around you isn't that right he presents himself as the answer Jesus is the answer for the world today do you believe it there's a possibility so when doubt sees impossibility Faith sees opportunity oh hallelujah hallelujah praise God Amen Hallelujah isn't that right I think about the woman in the issue of blood how that she had spent all her money at the doctors she had spent all that she had trying to find a solution to her blood issue problem but nothing she did in her natural self could get her an answer she needed she still had a blood issue she spent all her money and she still had a blood issue she tried to find advice she tried to find answers she went on the internet but she still had a blood issue she still had an unresolved issue oh Hallelujah you may search tonight you may run here and there but there's still unresolved issues tonight and I pray that you finally answer in Jesus to match because that woman heard of Jesus was passing by and that woman in adversity in her situation she thought she had an opportunity faith in a soul saw an opportunity in the midst of a Darkest Hour in the midst of a trial in the midst of a circumstance and tonight that is what you have to do in the midst of your adversity in the midst of whatever you are facing in your family on your job in your home in your life oh God is presenting an opportunity to nudge for you to meet Jesus for you to meet the Savior for you to meet the answer for you to get into contact with the Holy Ghost with the baptism of fire for you to get in contact with the supernatural the thing that changes a man truly from the inside oh hallelujah it's an opportunity amen for God to do something this woman saw an opportunity she said if I could just Touch the Hem of His Garment I know that something will happen I know that I will be made whole and guess what when she came down there it wasn't three people in the land and she was number four no no no no there was a crowd Bible called it a great press was around Jesus they were trying to touch him someone's trying to touch him for fame some come to touch him for Fortune some come to touch him just to be seen some came to touch just to be heard but this woman had an unresolved blood issue that she needed solving and the only one that could solve it was a man in that press oh and she pressed away she pressed her way she pressed past this one she pressed past that one she crawled through the legs she got down she got dirty but she had to meet Jesus she made me crying a little she maybe got frustrated but she knew what she was after she needed a healing and tonight if you need a healing if you need Deliverance don't be afraid to press your ear into the kingdom of God the kingdom of God is Rich and Every Man Press their ear into the the kingdom of God press in prayer press and believing press and worship present Faith present God don't you give up don't you backslide don't call that go it is your hour it is your season keep on

unchanging hand don't let go of him Hallelujah until you get your heart's desire until you get your healing until you get your answer is Hallelujah my what inspiration we don't know what this woman is we don't know what this woman name is but I feel like that woman tonight I hope you feel like that woman tonight praise God that if we press we could touch him we could be healed as soon as he touched that was different something Supernatural happened when she touched Jesus because everybody was touching him when she touched him he was going along the way all of a sudden something stopped him in his tracks and he turned around and say who touched me and the disciples Say by everybody touching the Lord everybody are wrong here touching you he said no that's not what I'm talking about this touch was a different touch this touch come from a deep this touch was a cry this touch was a bleeding this touch was a press this Touch come by trials this Touch come true adversity somebody brought an opportunity pulled it out of adversity and got their healing already I'm just here to tell you it's already done woman can't see his eye Lord he says you're here your faith has made you whole it's nice that's what happens when you get in contact with Jesus e-man isn't that right Hallelujah in adversity that's where the opportunity is the woman with the alabaster box when she saw Jesus being entertained at that party she was in a mess she herself wasn't didn't have a wonderful life going on but as the prophet dramatized he said that woman saw Jesus being entertained at the party and saw that he had a need she saw that he was in a messy situation and a lot bled for him because she saw him being entertained there but he had dirty feet and there was no one to wash his feet he came into the party and nobody tended to him nobody sought after him nobody helped him nobody catered to his need Jesus always comes where he's invited but you've got to entertain him you've got to welcome him into your heart into your life and here Jesus was in the corner put away who had an uncatered for and that woman's heart bled out for him Prophet dramatized she went home and got the most surprised possession she had it wasn't a car tire it wasn't a plate or a dish Hallelujah wasn't something she didn't want it was something that was of Great Value it was something of great sacrifice to her personally she took the most expensive thing she had and brought it to Jesus and she broke open that box oh Hallelujah she was keeping that for a special occasion and here it was her opportunity in the midst of this adverse condition in the midst of this horrible stage she saw herself doing an act of service foreign something for Jesus what are you gonna do what are you going to do for Jesus some people put him off in the corner somewhere over their lives in some people's houses he is on capable in some people's homes and lives and hearts he's just sitting there waiting to be spoken to we didn't have a conversation a relationship with you and he's uncatered for I say tonight come and party oil from your Alabaster Box come and take the thing that means the most to you and pour it out Upon Jesus tonight Late At His Feet tonight wash his feet with you with your tears dry them with you here see if he don't do something for you tonight the wise man sitting at a party said he looking at Jesus and they felt pretty smug because in that moment they felt like they knew more than the master and they said they they said they told themselves he don't even know who that woman is if you know who that woman is he wouldn't let her wash his feet but praise God he broke his silence after all was said undone he come to boss it on them say Simon you brought me in your house and you treated all your friends nice you treated me with disdain treated all your higher-ups all your big boys would wash feet and flunky and you did me no service and here I sat with dirty feet but this woman who sins you all know are many I release her from all that guilt from all that shame that woman left there more free than Simon and all his friends praise God she was free to dance Frida shouts free to serve God free to tell the world come see a man who set me free from all my sins and failures amen is not rain oh man Prophet said then Jesus came on call all right let's see if we could strike or text you know kind of close this up so now he said when when she heard him all right he was talking about a Lazarus the devil Lazarus he said no when she heard him she was all right when she when he said I am the resurrection and the life I am he said oh what an assurance of the promise would for he was that I am that was in the wilderness with Moses back there in the burning bush he said even when all hopes was gone yet she was satisfied that if she could only get him to ask that it would take place he said now how we need a fate like that today he said no she had to believe for The Impossibles to the modern mind to the modern way of thinking she had to believe something that was almost heretical that was almost impossible to happen it was Lazarus dead for days but she had to believe that even now Lord hallelujah hallelujah that he could still be changed isn't that right that there was still hope for him oh Hallelujah The Impossible the prophet said is made reality when God is taken at his word he said now notice how beautiful even now Lord even now he said no matter what the situation is even now whatever you ask God God will do it in the attack hour or in that Darkest Hour when they feel like there's no light at all oh hell it's not right he said even now whatever you ask God God will do it for you oh just have faith and believe and see the opportunity in the midst of your adversity tonight he said now let's review a couple of people here he said also in the Bible just a minute he said let's think of job he was the most righteous man on Earth and Satan came upon him and come to God first an accused job of being just God's pet he said sure I got them all fenced up he said but God said break the Hedge and I'll make him curse into your face and God said he said you God said you can do it see he said now and job got into all kinds of trouble the prophet said remember he lost all of his wealth he lost all of his popularity Prophet said he was a prince you know in the East he said on all the Young Prince used to come and bow before him because he was a man of wisdom you know that was his State before he was a prophet and everybody wanted to see him and talk with him he said just a moment just a moment of his time would just means so much and how we used to walk down the street and honor in his heart for God because God had made him a prophet and the wise men would come up and say job sir we know that the great God Of Heaven is with you just one piece of advice we'd like to have we'd have a certain certain thing and so on and God would reveal it to job and they go away that way and so for like that was fine amen skipping on them he said but all at once all the people when his trial come all the people when his tests come the prophet said but all at once all the people got against him yeah everybody turned him down whoa hallelujah hallelujah this is the part we don't hear about huh about Job story amen Oh my he lost his popularity he lost his friends he lost his social status hallelujah's Welch but he didn't lose God he didn't lose Jesus Oh Hallelujah that's what happens when God takes everything away from you the only thing left is God the only thing left is his word the only thing left is his promises his promises stand sure forever and ever and ever oh heaven on Earth will pass away but his word will never pass away his word concerning you in your life isn't that right oh my everything was gone then come some of his very best deacons of the church Prophet said dramatizing here see come to give him comfort and they was accusing him said no job you know a man that was favored to God like you and all this happened to him there has to be got to be something wrong you've done something wrong and job said I am satisfied that I never my heart is clearly for God and I've made my sacrifice amen Prophet said there you are he said then stand on it he said if you met gorn's requirements stay right there oh that's good advice if you've met God's requirements if you've come to the blood if you've been Sanctified he said stay right there he said don't you move brother said Abraham called Everything contrary to that promise as though it wasn't oh nothing he felt in his body nothing he felt in his mind could persuade him otherwise if God promised he would have a son then he was going to have a son God said I'll give you a son or I'll make you Hallelujah a great nation he held to that promise doesn't matter what he felt didn't matter how he woke up that morning he came into church he threw his hands up he shouted Hallelujah glory to God he sang the loudest he jumped the highest without a sign in his body but our faith in his soul prays that kept him pressing on and on and that's how we are here tonight praise God we may not see a sign of it but we know God spoke it and he cannot lie or somebody say Amen tonight if God spoke to your heart if God spoke to your life he cannot lie he has to bring it to pass oh my God job stayed right to it and after a while his own wife kind of turned against him job got broke up with boils his own health failed he went out and sat on an Airship scraped himself with a piece of croc or something scrap just imagine what a miserable shape that that man was in praise God isn't that right my my I said his wife come on said job you're miserable why don't you curse God and die and he said now look he didn't call our foolish woman Prophet said he said thou speak is like a foolish woman in other words you speak foolish hell it is not right the Lord give and the Lord take it away even in that adverse condition job still found an opportunity to give God praise the surface all right here or even in that time of adversity even in that time of darkness in a time when you're supposed to be crying and sighing and in a pity party job still found a reason to give God praise oh to never turn his back on God oh hallelujah oh we ought to be faithful tonight amen he didn't call a fool he said thou speak is like a foolish woman said the Lord Give the Lord take it away bless the name of the Lord he knew he was going to die and he said oh Lord praise God for what he said 14th chapter of Joe the prophet said he said there was hope in a tree if it blows down he knowed he had been uh influenced people he said okay his life had been useful God never gave us our lives just to hang around see he give us he giveth us to be useful for him give all lives to be useful to him to God so we are to be used of him it's not the prophet said eternal life is living for others isn't that right and the adopted son cannot have power over other things unless he has power over himself we are called to a life of service of servitude even Jesus told his disciples when he was washing their feet he said let the greatest is among you let him be your servant we are here to serve the final way to help somebody else to reach somebody else this gift is for others oh Halloween God give you Faith put your knowledge and Temperance what is it for it's for your Fallen brother it's for your Fallen sister to have Temperance with them knowing what's in their hearts calling them a difference knowledge to know the difference patience with them calling us with them brotherly kindness with them oh hello to forgive them as Christ forgive us then we could extend ourselves and express God's kindness to others by showing forgiveness oh hello because if you don't do not forgive then neither will your father in Heaven forgive you oh Hallelujah isn't that right isn't that right hallelujah hallelujah so if you do not forgive you put yourself in the seat of the judgment you are in the seat of the scornful when you do not forgive because you're saying I I deserve the right to judge them isn't that right and the Bible said he that judging himself shall not be judged but when we're judged with Jason of the Lord and to show his death till he come so it's not in our position to judge we give up all right we say Lord you judge this matter you judge this issue I release them I forgive them of this wrong it's not my right I am not going to take any right in this matter you forgive I forgive them and you take charge of it now you pray for that person in a real way and that is God living out that is Christ Living out of you the individual is that right when the people were in the wrong Moses threw himself in the way he said kill me instead that's the attitude of a Christian anybody who sits in a seat of persecution that's not the spirit of Christianity please it's not right in the seat of accusation because the devil is the accuser of the brethren so when they begin to accuse accuse what be careful now you're doing the double job you're called to forgive you're called to repent you're called to make it right you're called to let them go despite what they have done to you and pray for that person the Bible said when you stand praying forgive if you are bought against any that your father in Heaven may also forgive you in other words when you were ready to go to the angel to take the book you have to be on speaking terms with that angel and brotherly kindness puts you on speaking terms with that angel in other words if you lock God's neck he locks yours and you can ask what you will you can't forgive I didn't mean to go there tonight but praise God oh a word to the wise huh well this is our age requirement right so we have to come to forgiveness the blood has to be displayed Upon Our chests praise God we have to show the blood for our age probably kindness speaking the truth and love that's what this Ephesians Ministry is supposed to have this crest of Love upon them to speak the word in love to the to the individual praise God Amen not speak lovely the truth but the truth in love wrapped in love is the truth of God presented amen wrapped in birthday kindness wrapped in forgiveness wrapped in the honey praise God Amen to bring amen the backslider in to bring the Crooked one in and to straighten out all the Crooked pants and make them straight it's not right oh my I'm I'm spraying on here amen okay just have a couple minutes and I'll finish I'll close this out praise God Amen but do you love him amen I hope this helps you tonight oh Hallelujah it's not right all right so let me skip down here now he said uh Prophet said now is that the hour of God Deliverance he said why brother if we come into the presence of God like Moses did why it was a revolutionary to him why it would revolutionize why in the light of that angel of God standing there on a mountain that day everything that he once had or thought would never happen come to be a reality he said and I think if men and women today would ever step into the light of the Holy Spirit under the unction of God's spirit and the light of God word everything that God had promised will eliminate to you and it will be real again he said that's the reason why Moses failed in the first place here's what he here's what's the matter here's a hitter statement Prophet said here's the reason Moses failed it was the lack of having what the burning bush had he said that's right he said that's what our failure is today is the lack of having what the Holy Spirit has Amen in other words he met that bonding Bush but what was supposed to happen was that burning was supposed to come inside of him the Holy Spirit but that's the promise that we have received tonight the baptism of the Holy Ghost to abide in the heart of the believer oh and to make you a real Christian tonight oh do you believe it tonight amen he said that sort of failure today is lacking what the Holy Spirit has and the Holy Spirit has all good things for us and we receive the Holy Spirit and then all things are possible not only possible but promised to us amen Jesus said ask the father anything in my name I'll do it if he abide in me and my words abide in you ask what you will and it will be given to you see when we step into the light of God's word with the unction of the Holy Spirit to shine the light on it brother The Impossible becomes possible then oh let's strike our text and go home amen so we read about Samson isn't that right Brazil could get ready to come Samson saw a possibility even in his pollen condition Samson who was once the champion of his people Israel he was revered he was respected he was a hero but now he has been put to shame as a consequence of his own actions isn't that all right here he was crying and at the Mill and his eyes were tugged out once a glorious Son of God now he's in a pit of Oblivion he's in a pit of Shame doing the devil's work crying at the Mill every day but the Bible said a shock of his hair began to grow out even in that condition even in that situation of adversity here there was still hope there was still opportunity there was still a chance for him to come back or into the arms of God and tonight I don't matter what adversity doesn't matter what shame doesn't matter what jail cell the devil puts you in tonight you've got to see the opportunity that God has presenting to you tonight he is presenting to you he is preaching to you tonight oh Hallelujah an abundant entrance is being ministered to you oh Hallelujah hallelu into the Everlasting Love of Jesus Christ oh isn't that right his eyes were dug out he was made a slave to the enemy and on once more the prophet said there he stood and he began to remember the things of his errors where he had left the straight a narrow road where he had got away from God's promise and he cried out Lord Revenge my eyes why did he do this he knew there was a possibility now is he I want you to listen the prophet said Samson must have thought of where he had left the patch where he saw it was too late now he saw where he had left the patch and he thought there must be a possibility that God would answer he knew if he could repent he knew if he could get caught to see that he was sorry for his error that there was a possibility that God would achieve his promise that God will do it the prophet said God will do it he said he is going to do it oh somebody say Amen tonight if you believe that same God is here tonight to Grant you a possibility that you can be healed there's a possibility here that you could be sealed there's a possibility that you could be saved there's a possibility that your blind eyes could open there's a possibility for Revival there's a possibility for the to walk the blind to speak the death to hear there is a possibility tonight don't tell me that God brought us out here to die God did not bring us out here the perish with no illness get up and get your land tonight there is a possibility tonight for you to be healed for you to be delivered for you to be changed for you to be transformed for you to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost there is a possibility tonight hallelujah oh Set Me Free there is a possibility tonight oh Hallelujah the prophet said God will do it he's going to do it he's that same now God is going to have that church he said don't you worry she's going to be there the holy spirit will move so in that church until the church and Christ will be that same Spirit Luther stood on the feet of justification he said Wesley stood in a heartbeat of love signification but it's raised up to the head now see it's more than that she's denominated and so forth like that and they died never come back to normal they will never come back but still the prophet said there is a seed of life that's there that's coming on he said but notice he could play something Softly but notice Samson thought there that there must be a possibility he caught the idea that the church don't catch that they don't realize that there is a possibility of a Revival they don't realize the possibility they haven't caught the vision yet they just sit or deceived Church by the world Prophet said and here's my only hope I have this morning to wind up my message is this that while Samson was bound a new shock of here growed out the prophet said God send us another church just before the end time that the power of the Holy Ghost can come into her in the demonstrations of the spirit and Saint Mark 16 can't follow that church Acts 2 4 Acts 2 38 all of it will be following right along with the church he said signs and wonders accompany the apostles you can stand I'm getting ready to close great signs of his resurrection accompany them he said while we're in prison surely surely God's growing a crop somewhere for that last great kill may it be you my Christian friend here this morning he says maybe you here tonight maybe that your strength is beginning to grow I pray that this message this morning and out into the land to where this will go I trust that this message will help bring the vitamin to your system that will grow our spiritual power back into your life again may
