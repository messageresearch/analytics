[53:24] service add one child a Fortin in prayer
[53:33] something came to me and I just think
[53:35] it's something altogether different
[53:40] every title this morning is detached
[53:43] when tears shall reap in joy out of old
[53:52] message on the harvest and everything
[53:54] else but this is what I got this morning
[53:57] to bring to you oh you could never
[54:01] figure this thing in I can't figure it
[54:05] out
[54:05] but I know you'll be blessed I feel the
[54:08] Holy Spirit over the building I feel the
[54:11] Holy Spirit over you
[54:12] Thank You Bethany for that song service
[54:14] all right let's go and this is from a
[54:17] message the healed life as a healer
[54:20] notice the Church of the early age they
[54:22] went for from the first three centuries
[54:24] the preach the gospel the healed is sick
[54:26] after that healing miracles begin to die
[54:28] out so people say today that God
[54:32] promised in his word just to be with the
[54:33] fossils and the heal the second it will
[54:35] be primitive age of the church I count
[54:37] that very poor Bible scholar in there's
[54:41] no such Krypton about to prove that God
[54:45] promised in mark 16 his last Commission
[54:49] to the church go into all the world and
[54:52] preach the gospel to every creature he
[54:56] that believeth and is baptized shall be
[54:57] saved he that believeth not shall be
[54:59] damned and these signs shall follow him
[55:02] I believe they will lay under
[55:03] second they shall recover the first
[55:06] Commission he gifted this chest was the
[55:08] Heelys sick the last commission the gift
[55:10] delicious was to heal the sick he has to
[55:13] be all over the world so the Commission
[55:16] is still in effect
[55:17] isn't that right the unbelievers say
[55:21] that was just to convert the heathens
[55:22] the others I believe the reasons the
[55:25] church lost her place in divine healing
[55:27] or we have a little spirit but is very
[55:29] feeble just enough to move around like
[55:33] somebody about half dead that's about
[55:36] the way the Church of the Living God
[55:38] moves today just about enough to grunt a
[55:41] little while you see I'm not saying that
[55:45] for Jukes but it's the truth
[55:47] just enough courage to go down the
[55:49] children see well I'm a Baptist this
[55:53] Alisha's with power with miracles with
[55:55] sign the one that's command a place
[55:56] where people comfortable how many
[56:02] messages you know YouTube just about as
[56:11] much life as they got that's true some
[56:13] allows it to that I do the same I think
[56:16] if the church listen of the Living God
[56:20] Steve is a place and was freed up and
[56:24] lived in the presence of God with the
[56:28] baptism of the Holy Ghost that signs and
[56:31] wonders would be flowing from a like a
[56:33] gush and I think that is where the
[56:38] trouble is you talk about it used to
[56:42] convert heathens that's what God gave it
[56:44] to the church the primitive church was
[56:46] the convert is my dear beloved
[56:47] unbeliever did did you know that there
[56:50] is more Eden study in the world ten
[56:52] times as many as there was two tears of
[56:56] the word is unchristian eyes and the
[56:58] reason we haven't got nowhere is because
[57:00] we have turned all the promises of God
[57:02] into theology into the teaching of some
[57:05] kind of doctrines of men and
[57:07] organization and fail to produce what
[57:10] Jesus said that the signs will follow
[57:12] delivers
[57:14] we put more emphasis on organization and
[57:16] so forth that we have upon the
[57:18] resurrection and the power of the Lord
[57:20] Jesus Christ if we had more prayer
[57:22] meetings instead of sheep suppers and
[57:23] cat parties will be in better offer
[57:25] Christians or glory to God hallelujah
[57:29] they turn the old-fashioned upper room
[57:31] in to supper room or glory to God
[57:34] hallelujah praise God the prayer
[57:36] meetings will do much better and all
[57:39] these theological teaching and
[57:40] explanation
[57:41] I'm anybody said knowledge shall
[57:43] increase but Court promise the
[57:45] tournaments back to the faith of the
[57:47] fathers and theaters all your access the

[58:54] [Applause]
[59:02] so let's identify quickly where God put
[59:05] the presents some rubbish in Chapter
[59:09] four let's turn the Genesis 3:4 I'm
[59:11] Brown beginning to speak a little bit
[59:12] he said no my love and precious darling
[59:15] sisters let me please that my love and
[59:20] precious darling scissors do not think
[59:23] I'm trying I reflect upon your loyalty
[59:25] and a gracious precious jewel of
[59:26] womanhood I'm trying to show you here
[59:29] that you were meant that listening to
[59:31] this tea punch I'm not gonna score new
[59:33] and I'm only a servant of the Lord
[59:34] bringing light the Louis and immoralist
[59:38] and most filth eating there is none it
[59:40] is a woman when she is bad salvation is
[59:47] a good woman
[59:51] then fellows like that one
[59:54] but this is were true our let's continue
[59:58] and I'm speaking to all of that low
[1:00:01] immoral degraded I'm gonna show you here
[1:00:03] and that the Bible teaches for women not
[1:00:06] to be preachers and pastors and teachers
[1:00:08] listen to this behold the man has become
[1:00:11] one of us now he never said the woman
[1:00:13] has become one the man has become one to
[1:00:16] know good and evil Paul said I know I
[1:00:18] suffer not a woman to teach or usurp
[1:00:20] authority over a man because Adam was
[1:00:22] not deceived but the woman was deceived
[1:00:25] Adam was wrong and he knew he was wrong
[1:00:28] but he was not deceived so continue know
[1:00:31] therefore the Lord Sevenfold from
[1:00:32] niganda Eden to till the ground from
[1:00:34] whence he was taken so he drove out the
[1:00:36] man and he placed in the east of Garden
[1:00:39] of Eden and cherubim with flying sword
[1:00:41] 10 everywhere watch for his right to
[1:00:45] keep a sinful condition and what cut him
[1:00:47] off from it you get that
[1:00:49] now these cherubim was first mentioned
[1:00:52] in the East garden and God can't do just
[1:00:55] little gods or anything like that you
[1:00:57] have to know what I mean
[1:00:58] there is the Garden of Eden and there's
[1:01:01] a gate there that swings out and at this
[1:01:04] kid there was terrible's now remember he
[1:01:07] didn't say it cherubim he said cherubims
[1:01:08] and they were what they was the God the
[1:01:12] way of the
[1:01:13] of life who is the way Jesus is the way
[1:01:17] okay now notice these Chairman's that
[1:01:20] John saw must have been interested in
[1:01:22] keeping the Tree of Life
[1:01:23] so he jumped from Genesis to John Oh
[1:01:26] hallelujah
[1:01:28] Oh glory to God they kept the Tree of
[1:01:31] Life guarded the way of life the way of
[1:01:33] life he said I am the way I am the bread
[1:01:35] will come from God know there is a way
[1:01:37] back to the tree of life and I want to
[1:01:40] show you know and make this short it's
[1:01:42] the altar not to say I believe this and
[1:01:45] believe that not that not that
[1:01:46] that's intellect nice read right on
[1:01:48] arithmetic that's what you have to
[1:01:50] understand the way back to the altar the
[1:01:53] author's where you bring a sacrifice and
[1:01:55] the author's where God sends fire upon
[1:01:58] your sacrifice will get the Lord as so
[1:02:00] Oh blowing a Cordillera stellar altar
[1:02:03] you tell me the altar or chlorine oh god
[1:02:07] get a lot of shout the Holy Spirit I
[1:02:12] [Music]
[1:02:18] want to show you know I make it sure
[1:02:21] it's an altar now this must have been an
[1:02:24] altar at the God of Eden I'll tell you
[1:02:26] why
[1:02:26] do you remember what killing a bear came
[1:02:28] up to worship so it shows that God's
[1:02:31] heat and change several ages there was
[1:02:33] seven mercy seat Oh glory to God seven
[1:02:37] blood support of course he can on your
[1:02:40] behalf so God put a moose easy for you
[1:02:43] or glory that the grace of God by the
[1:02:46] love of God to be projected to you and
[1:02:49] we keep you from your sin what said tell
[1:02:53] me what sin
[1:02:55] as far as the East is from the West or
[1:02:59] you have a right they shook this morning
[1:03:01] when you understand what assault is
[1:03:03] about what this blood is about what this
[1:03:06] bump of the blood of Jesus is all about
[1:03:08] is to loose you and free you from your
[1:03:11] past from your fears from your sins he's
[1:03:26] your God can't people see it nothing but
[1:03:30] the blood there has to be an atonement a
[1:03:33] mercy seat dear this alt of judgment
[1:03:37] must become a mercy seat and when this
[1:03:39] alter if the blood is lifted then we
[1:03:41] will stand the Judgment Day the fire of
[1:03:43] God's wrapped the God the tree again the
[1:03:46] only thing will enter into this gift
[1:03:47] will be true the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:03:49] notice Cain and Abel the boys came up
[1:03:53] with a gate to worship so it must have
[1:03:55] been God's altar and before this altered
[1:03:58] he had another altar there was a true
[1:04:00] altar of God in the heart of man
[1:04:01] and there's another altar which was
[1:04:04] representing the holiest of the Holies
[1:04:05] and the holy place is I feel like
[1:04:08] speaking in tongues he said can't you
[1:04:10] see it's perfect the reason I said that
[1:04:13] because you can't find enough words in
[1:04:15] my English dialect to express my feeling
[1:04:18] or glory to God that's why you need to
[1:04:21] speak in tongues after an altar words
[1:04:23] after another Thanksgiving you need
[1:04:26] another language they give göran worship
[1:04:28] songs from the restored prophecy chorus
[1:04:31] thought tongues will be restored back in
[1:04:34] this church prophecies back in the
[1:04:36] church signs and wonders back in the
[1:04:38] church give her wisdom give of healing
[1:04:40] give her miracles all the gifts
[1:04:42] [Applause]
[1:04:48] all glory to God hallelujah glory to God
[1:04:54] amen
[1:04:55] God in the state Kenan even came up here
[1:04:58] to worship so it must have been an altar
[1:05:01] that the God is not right what's the
[1:05:05] Bible Cain went out from the presence of
[1:05:08] the Lord from the gate at the garden so
[1:05:12] the presence of the Lord must have been
[1:05:15] at the altar and the altar was at the
[1:05:18] gate it's got 12 verses that the altar
[1:05:21] Cain went out from the presence of the
[1:05:24] Lord and God for the presence on the
[1:05:26] altar and the author was at the gate and
[1:05:27] kit leave the gate leave the altar walk
[1:05:30] away from the presence of God no you
[1:05:33] coming back you coming back to the gate
[1:05:35] they're coming back to the gate you
[1:05:37] coming back to the way they're coming
[1:05:38] back to the altar you coming back in the
[1:05:40] presence I'll never leave you I'll never
[1:05:42] forsake you but I'd be with you even in
[1:05:44] you you come back in the presence a
[1:05:46] person that will never leave you believe
[1:05:49] it now believe it this is a word no or
[1:05:53] glory to God hallelujah hallelujah Oh
[1:05:59] Moses was taken up to him and saw the
[1:06:04] altar of God now I'm trying to prove my
[1:06:07] point here you know what I'm trying to
[1:06:09] do don't you burn see he went up in the
[1:06:11] presence of God and when he descended
[1:06:14] from the presence of God God told Moses
[1:06:17] make everything on earth and after
[1:06:21] heaven and when he did he made the act
[1:06:25] of the Covenant he put two cherubim
[1:06:26] cigar diac so all those who will see
[1:06:32] what Moses saw so a representation by
[1:06:36] what he was making concerning the act
[1:06:38] Oh hallelujah because he manually saw
[1:06:40] something and God say whatever you see
[1:06:42] up there make a representation down here
[1:06:44] or chlorine of course he put the
[1:06:46] parallels Karen the acts or glory that
[1:06:50] God let's continue
[1:06:51] hallelujah mold emotive brass and put
[1:06:55] their wings touching like this that's
[1:06:57] exactly what John saw in heaven
[1:06:59] four turbines on the four sides of the
[1:07:01] app in the tool of heaven dad in the art
[1:07:04] scene cherubim that was in Genesis Saint
[1:07:07] cherubims in Revelation or give the Lord
[1:07:10] a shout I was sailing and the same
[1:07:13] cherubim that was in Genesis and this is
[1:07:19] the scripture these are matrices up to
[1:07:21] 25 verse 9 to 22 and God speaking the
[1:07:24] motions according to all that I surely
[1:07:26] after the pattern of the tabernacle and
[1:07:28] a pattern of all the instruments thereof
[1:07:30] even so shall you make it they shall
[1:07:32] make an ark of shittim wood two cubits
[1:07:33] and a half shall be the length thereof a

[1:07:58] into the rings on the side of the AK the
[1:08:01] app will born with them the star shall
[1:08:03] be rings of the ark they shall not be
[1:08:05] taken from it though shall put the AK
[1:08:07] the testimony which I give thee thou

[1:08:47] o glorious go and I will meet with thee
[1:08:51] and I will commune with thee from above

[1:09:11] there was a tingle specified I will meet
[1:09:13] you there
[1:09:16] doesn't that sound familiar
[1:09:20] thought let's continue know that God the
[1:09:23] mercy seat when God is in the Shekinah
[1:09:28] glory
[1:09:29] where was this energy category at the
[1:09:32] mercy seat they God the Shekinah glory

[1:09:39] to shows that every scallywag cannot
[1:09:46] come dear and take of that you have got
[1:09:51] to be repaired before you come into the
[1:09:54] presence of it so God but God's around
[1:09:58] the altar and wrong in mercy seat around
[1:10:01] the presence that any and anybody can
[1:10:03] take up and walk with it or give it law
[1:10:10] some prison so that is why I said
[1:10:15] presence must be accessed you have to be
[1:10:21] given access to the presence of God
[1:10:27] anyone can read or listen to the word
[1:10:29] because it is written and spoken but
[1:10:32] presence must be accessed you must have
[1:10:37] access or given access to the presence
[1:10:41] of God the main is where the war is at
[1:10:45] with thoughts and words the battle in
[1:10:49] the main but the presence of God comes
[1:10:51] into the heart and as there is where
[1:10:54] things are settled
[1:10:56] [Applause]
[1:10:59] [Music]
[1:11:02] hallelujah
[1:11:03] yeah is where things are settles not in
[1:11:07] the head in the heart and out of the
[1:11:11] half half comes the issues of life

[1:29:20] Romans 11:29 said for the gifts and
[1:29:25] calling of God are without repentance
[1:29:28] your gifts you have God give them to you
[1:29:33] God can take it back
[1:29:39] God get give you a gift of sing I'll
[1:29:43] give to preach a gift a exhort I give to
[1:29:44] give whatever gift God give you
[1:29:46] let's God give you that it's built in
[1:29:49] it's who you yield that gift to you
[1:29:52] could sing for the Lord or sing for the
[1:29:53] devil that's who you want the yield to
[1:29:56] give to it up well gifted people out
[1:29:59] there singing for Lucifer beautiful
[1:30:01] voice but they're not singing for the
[1:30:03] right person are you with me Alleluia
[1:30:06] Baram says don't try any person it he
[1:30:09] said there's too many trying to
[1:30:10] impersonate they got the Holy Ghost
[1:30:11] there's too many trying to poison it
[1:30:12] divine healing there's too many people
[1:30:13] trying to push their different things of
[1:30:15] the Lord you can't do that that comes by
[1:30:17] election oh praise God but if God calls
[1:30:20] you you are the most thankful person in
[1:30:23] the world because he has called you then
[1:30:27] it becomes real to you they mean God
[1:30:30] really called me yes you mean the devil

[1:30:46] attracts the Holy Ghost
[1:30:47] it's the correct in you it's what in you
[1:30:51] and this is something that struck me the

[1:31:00] guitar piano organ whatever than hands
[1:31:02] going because the gift are gift up there
[1:31:05] music no spirit you know just hands

[1:31:12] if you get that musician connected to
[1:31:16] the power source
[1:31:17] [Music]
[1:31:21] is a little more than hands moving it is
[1:31:24] a spirit moving upon them same hands and
[1:31:28] the music the same music becomes
[1:31:30] inspired the plan becomes inspired I say

[2:08:28] it's really something how God brought
[2:08:31] this seed soil into planting and they've
[2:08:35] give that reference see that to go into
[2:08:39] the ground and be buried an idea if I
[2:08:44] could use it would like a metaphor I
[2:08:45] called the farmer had a choice he had
[2:08:48] this corn and a choice to greet the corn
[2:08:50] and grind the coin to make flour to make
[2:08:52] a big to feed his children or take the
[2:08:55] season pounded painful decision you
[2:08:59] could have chair be hungry for a while
[2:09:01] but the choices if you're greater to
[2:09:04] make flour make a big there's only a
[2:09:05] half but if I take the corn and plant it
[2:09:09] you have a crop that would carry you on
[2:09:13] for the season he choose the planted
[2:09:17] plant in such a sea precious seeds this
[2:09:21] plantain in tears
[2:09:22] it's plantain because they're paying a
[2:09:24] price the price of anguish a price of

[2:36:18] expecting it I mean let's finish off
[2:36:22] here Oh glory to God hallelujah notice
[2:36:27] Pentecost all the actors see if they
[2:36:30] were quittin by the script and power
[2:36:31] that is what we are talking about they
[2:36:33] were waiting up the end themselves they
[2:36:35] were afraid the Jews does what they were
[2:36:38] going to do so they got scared okay I'm
[2:36:41] gonna
[2:36:41] he said no happen you say when this
[2:36:43] quickly power fell from heaven
[2:36:44] there was a bravery set upon them there
[2:36:47] was something and understanding where it
[2:36:50] wasn't too sure a few hours before they
[2:36:52] know he died they know he had risen they
[2:36:54] had talked to him on the way but that
[2:36:56] was the thing for them or what but here
[2:36:59] under their Pentecost the Holy Spirit
[2:37:01] the abstract fell upon the believers
[2:37:03] that made him part of his resurrection
[2:37:05] it made him part of his fellowship the
[2:37:07] Holy Spirit came and confirmed to them
[2:37:10] that they would be raised up because
[2:37:12] they were potentially raised from
[2:37:13] cowards to praise them they were afraid
[2:37:17] of the very word that they taught I read
[2:37:21] it again
[2:37:21] they were afraid of the very word that
[2:37:24] they had taught don't let this pass over
[2:37:27] you they were afraid they know that he
[2:37:30] was the word
[2:37:31] but they were afraid all glory to God
[2:37:35] isn't that right but all of a sudden
[2:37:37] here come the Holy Spirit from heaven
[2:37:38] and it's quicken them and the equipment
[2:37:41] took place there wasn't afraid to make a
[2:37:43] witness of the message that they
[2:37:44] believed that the note was true

[2:38:12] to be the truth they say we are washer
[2:38:15] and the world until the wood was
[2:38:16] preached and when the world was preached
[2:38:18] and vindicated they become sinners for

[2:40:01] and the word is the conductor if you do
[2:40:03] have the word you can't get the conduct
[2:40:04] of the spirit because it split up the
[2:40:06] flow to something and or spirit through
[2:40:08] into the word the Pentecostal feel
[2:40:10] because it didn't have the word what
[2:40:12] give the Lord a shout when the Spirit
[2:40:14] slipped the Pentecostals they didn't
[2:40:16] have the word because the Prophet
[2:40:18] William Branham was bringing the word
[2:40:19] but no he brought the word the secret is
[2:40:22] the word is in the bride no the word is
[2:40:24] in you the word isn't me then we become
[2:40:26] channels of God we become channels of
[2:40:29] the Spirit that will conduct the spirit
[2:40:31] or Florida gotcha you have to be under
[2:40:33] expectation to see the conductor of the
[2:40:36] Spirit the spirit conducting to the word
[2:40:39] so here program says the word is a
[2:40:41] conductor of the Spirit because where
[2:40:43] the word is preached the Spirit follows
[2:40:44] it or glory to God hallelujah I'm almost
[2:40:47] done using comma please
[2:40:48] Oh hallelujah praise God praise His Holy
[2:40:52] Name hallelujah praise God yes yes what

[2:41:32] weary this is the gospel here oh this is
[2:41:36] what God wants you want to know what God
[2:41:38] wants

[2:41:41] messiahs he wants men and women who are
[2:41:43] signs and wonders anointed ones he wants
[2:41:47] men our church such filled with the Holy
[2:41:49] Ghost
[2:41:49] I just reflected him to see me yesterday

[2:41:53] God didn't die he just born a kingdom
[2:41:56] and he got messiahs in it or glory to
[2:41:59] God hallelujah praise God praise God
[2:42:02] listen to this he said watch when the
[2:42:05] first vine come forth the first branch
[2:42:07] that come out of the way was a
[2:42:09] Pentecostal branch
[2:42:10] with visions powers healings baptism the
[2:42:14] Holy Spirit create signs and wonders the
[2:42:16] next branch will have to be the same
[2:42:18] kind of branch Oh glory to God I think
[2:42:20] this is a final quote I have and I'll be
[2:42:22] done as a quote that you know the 7
[2:42:25] angels message is to open the mystery of
[2:42:29] the seals calling the 11 our gentle
[2:42:33] workers to receive the same pay that the
[2:42:38] first our workers got I want to
[2:42:40] emphasize an underline and broad like
[2:42:42] st. pay not have people not want to pay
[2:42:46] same tape August big seals opening up
[2:42:50] all this big mystery on sunset mountain
[2:42:53] and cloud and angel talk that we talking
[2:42:56] for all these years the purpose of that
[2:42:59] is that we receive something simply all
[2:43:06] glory to God hallelujah
[2:43:08] so the even time message is to restore
[2:43:10] again to bring that same thing back get
[2:43:12] ready but Anthony so brother was telling
[2:43:14] them about some orange tree and then was
[2:43:16] grafted in lemon and great food and all
[2:43:18] kind of stuff he said this sucker Liz of
[2:43:20] the strength of the vine it lives
[2:43:22] because the citrus fruit a lemon will
[2:43:23] grow in an orange tree but it will not
[2:43:25] the oranges do it lives by its life and
[2:43:28] the church so call only a crafted
[2:43:30] chuckle living under the name of
[2:43:32] religion suckers pulling from the
[2:43:33] strength of the rain so God has up
[2:43:36] suckers in this message drawing from the
[2:43:37] message but representing themselves
[2:43:39] representing their own teachings and
[2:43:41] ideas only and what not that's what they
[2:43:43] represent him they not say anybody tipsy
[2:43:45] they're not saying what they prophesy
[2:43:47] they say in their own thing
[2:43:48] sometime they call hidden mysteries
[2:43:50] hidden mysteries are kind of foolish
[2:43:52] things but there's no more he
[2:43:54] said his spirit and Lee Brian the
[2:43:55] Prophet will say the same thing and what
[2:43:58] they say will already be said in the
[2:44:00] world so we kept pushing on new thing
[2:44:02] what be saying you could read any
[2:44:03] message or glory of God you have the
[2:44:06] guarantee that what we've seen is the
[2:44:07] word
[2:44:08] Oh blow what me preaching is the word
[2:44:11] show it in your heart
[2:44:12] saw it in your life present is not for
[2:44:15] appreciated present for everybody I'm
[2:44:18] almost done hallelujah praise God put
[2:44:20] destined suckers he said no they have
[2:44:22] the United would yes said I am the vine
[2:44:24] you are the branches and if that tree
[2:44:26] ever puts for another branch it will be
[2:44:29] at your regional fruit show taught
[2:44:32] original original they know no polluted
[2:44:39] and cut with a mango cause a scene
[2:44:43] called mango it's cheap like I cannot
[2:44:45] doc you have I cannot doc she played and
[2:44:47] eating mangoes are strange taste some
[2:44:49] kind of graph getting a little baby I
[2:44:50] don't even know if God make that that
[2:44:52] original some kind of graph this
[2:44:53] something original is just original Iike
[2:44:56] original original stuff right now in the
[2:45:01] science that they yes we didn't
[2:45:05] equitable enough we don't need some kind
[2:45:10] of laboratory buzzer and there's no need
[2:45:12] to make chicken with we don't egg
[2:45:17] there's no make another yes short is
[2:45:21] real again just like our paths original
[2:45:26] original original substitute original
[2:45:32] origins of the Jews that's what it is I
[2:45:34] have original substitute my if that tree
[2:45:38] but for another branch it will bring
[2:45:40] forth original fruit watch watch what
[2:45:42] it's got the comfort for the even time
[2:45:44] and there will be light any even time it
[2:45:46] takes light to ripen it and what a fruit
[2:45:49] cannot writen unless the Sun right plant
[2:45:51] no matter how much you preach whatever
[2:45:53] you do it cannot be writing it cannot be
[2:45:56] manifested it cannot be vindicated only
[2:45:58] by the moon said I am the light of the
[2:45:59] world the world so there's got to come
[2:46:01] for a power people don't like us to say
[2:46:04] that because they feel they have it
[2:46:05] already but I am saying in happy to get
[2:46:07] just got to come for the power the holy
[2:46:11] sprit himself the right one or to
[2:46:14] vindicate or to prove to make
[2:46:16] that is what he predicted what happened
[2:46:19] the evening right but a George produces
[2:46:22] that but this is what a power - the wood
