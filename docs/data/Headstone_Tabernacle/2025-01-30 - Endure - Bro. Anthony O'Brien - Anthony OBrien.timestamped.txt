[35:26] Ecclesiastes uh ch chapter 9
[35:29] afterwards
[35:30] so uh Matthew 24 will be our longest
[35:34] reading and in Ecclesiastes 9 we'll just
[35:38] pick up one verse
[35:40] there but reading from Matthew chapter
[35:43] 24 we'd like to read from verse
[35:47] 4 Jesus answered and said unto them take
[35:50] heed that no man deceive you for many
[35:54] shall come in my name saying I am crying
[35:57] Christ and shall deceive many and he
[36:01] shall hear of wars and rumors of wars
[36:04] see that he be not troubled for all
[36:07] these things must come to pass but the
[36:10] end is not yet for nation shall rise
[36:14] against nation and Kingdom against
[36:18] Kingdom and there shall be famines and
[36:21] pestilences and earthquakes in diverse
[36:24] places all these things are the
[36:27] beginning of
[36:28] Sorrows then shall they deliver you up
[36:31] to be afflicted and shall kill you and
[36:34] ye shall be hated of all Nations for my
[36:37] name's sake and then shall he be uh
[36:41] shall many be offended and shall betray
[36:44] one another my and shall hate one
[36:49] another and many false prophets shall
[36:51] rise and shall deceive many and because
[36:54] iniquity shall abound the love of many
[36:58] shall wax
[36:59] cold but he that shall endure until the
[37:02] end the same shall be Sav and then
[37:07] turning over now to Ecclesiastes 9 for
[37:10] our last reading just one verse there
[37:13] Ecclesiastes
[37:15] 9 chter 9 verse
[37:18] 11 which says I returned and saw Under

[37:25] Swift nor the battle to the strong
[37:29] neither yet bread to the wise nor yet
[37:32] riches to Men of understanding nor yet
[37:35] favor to Men of skill but time and

[40:44] to preach here tonight amen but I have a
[40:46] title and my title is one word
[40:51] endure uh that's my title tonight uh
[40:55] endure if you can get one one word from
[40:57] God tonight then it'll be enough for me
[41:00] amen uh that one word tonight is
[41:05] endure and um you know I was just it
[41:08] just the thought just come to me and I I
[41:10] told my wife I said you know what what
[41:12] does it mean to endure you know and I
[41:14] just began talking to her and then all
[41:17] these scriptures start to unfold like
[41:19] that and that was a while ago and so you
[41:22] know just listening to the service we
[41:24] had last Sunday gone with our precious
[41:26] uh pastor Solomon Aina amen was such a
[41:30] tremendous blessing amen you appreciate
[41:32] that message talking about the time and
[41:34] season God does things in his time and
[41:38] in his season he will unfold
[41:40] himself amen amen all you have to do is
[41:43] wait on God wait for him to do what he
[41:46] promised that he would do to do what he
[41:48] said he would do amen isn't that right
[41:51] and he will fulfill it in his time in
[41:53] his season praise God isn't that right
[41:56] he has a Time for everything I I so
[41:59] appreciate that message on Sunday you
[42:02] know and I heard a a brother say one
[42:05] time that you know when God makes us
[42:07] wait like that it tempers our faith U
[42:11] because we want things when we want it
[42:14] and we feel that we need it right now
[42:17] but God being know a God of all wisdom
[42:20] who who knows what's good for you he's a
[42:23] good father and because he knows what's
[42:25] good for you he knows when to give it to
[42:28] you he knows when your faith is ripe
[42:31] enough for you to receive it he knows
[42:33] when you're you're ready to have what
[42:35] you're asking for he doesn't want you to
[42:37] be like the prodigal son who comes and
[42:40] asks for his inheritance but he's not
[42:42] ready for it God wants you to be trained
[42:45] for the battle he wants you to be
[42:48] prepared for what's coming next because
[42:50] there's coming a famine in the land and
[42:52] you've got to know how to maintain your
[42:55] resources how to handle your yourself in
[42:57] times of trouble and how to endure when
[43:00] the tough times come what you can lean
[43:03] back on what you can rest on because
[43:06] this race is not for the Swift nor the
[43:09] battle for the strong praise God but for
[43:12] them who could endure to the end the
[43:15] same shall be saved do you believe it
[43:17] tonight oh hallelujah hallelujah so what
[43:21] does it mean to
[43:23] endure we talk about it we mention it

[45:06] that it is God keeping us helping us to
[45:12] endure it means to undergo especially
[45:15] without giving in it means to regard
[45:19] with
[45:20] acceptance or with tolerance in other
[45:22] words you're going through stuff and
[45:25] quite frankly you just have to put up
[45:26] with it
[45:28] you're
[45:29] enduring it doesn't mean uh it's a
[45:32] situation of great
[45:34] discomfort enduring doesn't mean that we
[45:37] necessarily are having fun in the moment
[45:40] isn't that right uring means uh it
[45:44] doesn't mean that we're enjoying the
[45:45] activity in which we are involved
[45:48] enjoying means we just got to put up
[45:50] with it because that's what we've been
[45:53] dealt and we just have to to go through
[45:56] we we we can't go around it we we can't
[45:59] go dig a hole and go under it we we
[46:01] can't ignore it because it's in your
[46:03] face it's it's it's spitting in your
[46:05] face and it's flying in your face and

[46:39] he has an intention tonight to kill you
[46:42] tonight he wants you dead and the only
[46:44] reason you're not dead is because God
[46:46] told the devil you can do anything to
[46:49] them but don't you touch their soul
[46:52] because their soul belongs to me and I
[46:55] am the Lord
[46:57] and you got to play by my rules Satan

[52:27] so it comes with great stress
[52:30] enduring it's not uh walk in the park as
[52:33] they say it's not a walk on TR Road it's
[52:36] a it's a it's a it's a it's a It's a
[52:39] Grind it's a grit it's it's pushing it's
[52:44] pulling it's stress it's heartache
[52:48] there's there's pain in there untold
[52:51] stories isn't that right of just going
[52:54] through if you could sit with some young
[52:56] people you need to start with some of
[52:57] these older ones and let them tell you
[52:59] what it means to endure some of us
[53:02] frankly just don't know we we are just
[53:04] too green we need to understand what it
[53:06] means what it takes because we look at
[53:09] them now looking all Victorious in
[53:10] prayer but but but that didn't just
[53:12] happen overnight they had victories they
[53:16] they had battles they had to fight they
[53:18] they have scars from from times when
[53:20] things were not so good they they they
[53:23] had stories to tell you you ought to sit
[53:25] and listen to some of those stories come
[53:27] off your phone for 2 minutes and begin
[53:29] to talk to some of these older ones and
[53:31] begin to understand why they're sitting
[53:33] in this building tonight it is not by
[53:35] happen stance it is not by chance or or
[53:38] by accident but God allow us to go
[53:41] through the things that we went through
[53:43] so that we could come out better for it
[53:46] we could come out Victorious oh knowing
[53:48] that he conquered in us not we and
[53:51] ourselves but we are his people and the
[53:54] Sheep of his pasture and the only reason
[53:57] we made it out alive was because Jesus
[53:59] was on our side and had he not been on
[54:02] our side we the Earth would have
[54:04] swallowed us up quick oh hallelujah our
[54:06] enemy would have consumed us but like a
[54:09] bird out of the snare of the Fowler
[54:11] tonight we have escaped oh hallelujah
[54:15] hallelujah we have escaped the wicked
[54:17] one oh you escaped the world you escaped
[54:21] lust you escape the darkness called in
[54:24] his rich and mercy in his wisdom and his
[54:28] power allowed us to see something
[54:30] greater than
[54:31] ourselves and something in US was
[54:33] awakened and we ran after it and we are
[54:37] still running tonight running away from
[54:40] Fear running away from everything else
[54:43] we are running home tonight running home
[54:46] to Jesus do you feel that way tonight so
[54:50] when man is enduring it usually comes
[54:52] with a sound of great trial and great
[54:54] stress isn't that right heartache pain
[54:58] growth process all of those processes
[55:01] that are necessary for character
[55:04] development amen that is what we do when
[55:07] we endure yes sir amen and it's because
[55:10] we are in this temporary State uh where
[55:13] we have to learn we have to grow we have
[55:16] to come into the stature of a perfect
[55:18] man isn't that right but God doesn't
[55:21] have to come into the stature because he
[55:23] is perfection he doesn't have to to grow
[55:26] because uh he is God he he always was
[55:30] and he always will be isn't that right
[55:32] uh if anybody knows anything about
[55:35] enduring it is God because he he always
[55:38] was and he always will be isn't that
[55:41] right so when we talk about man's
[55:43] enduring it usually comes with great
[55:46] heartache and trial and pain because
[55:49] that's a process we have to do to get to
[55:51] where we want to get to but God is
[55:54] already there tonight he's already where
[55:56] he is he's just waiting on us to come
[55:59] back oh can you say Amen tonight amen
[56:03] amen so when God endures it is usually
[56:05] at the sound of rejoicing when we talk
[56:08] about the endurance of the Lord oh when
[56:11] we talk about how God has endured
[56:13] throughout the ages how God has endured
[56:15] all time it usually comes with rejoicing
[56:19] because we are so confident in God's
[56:21] ability to endure isn't that right
[56:25] Psalms chapter 9 and verse six says oh
[56:28] thou enemy destructions are come to a
[56:31] Perpetual end and thou has destroyed
[56:34] cities the memorial is perished with
[56:36] them but the Lord shall endure forever
[56:40] he had prepared his throne for judgment
[56:43] and he shall judge the world in
[56:46] righteousness he shall Minister judgment
[56:48] to the people in uprightness Psalm
[56:51] Chapter 30 says Sing unto the Lord oh ye
[56:55] Saints of his
[56:56] and give thanks at the remembrance of
[56:59] his Holiness his anger endureth but for
[57:02] a moment and in his favor is life
[57:06] weeping may endure for a night but joy
[57:09] cometh in the morning the joy of the
[57:12] Lord can endure the Weeping of the night
[57:15] the joy of the Lord can endure
[57:17] Hallelujah all of the darkness all of
[57:19] the sorrow all of the despair all of the
[57:23] storm in other words God goes beyond
[57:25] that he can Outlast anything oh that
[57:29] this world has to offer he can Outlast
[57:31] any moment oh Hallelujah that this world
[57:34] can throw at him he can endure he can
[57:39] Outlast and if God can endure then if
[57:42] that same spirit of God were to come
[57:45] upon you tonight he could give you that
[57:48] same strength in order to endure the
[57:51] things you have to go through oh won't
[57:54] be your strength it be his strength in
[57:57] you giving you the ability to
[58:02] endure Hallelujah that's what we need
[58:06] tonight because this world is not void
[58:09] of
[58:10] burdens this world is not void of
[58:12] troubles and
[58:14] Sorrows regardless of whether you go to
[58:16] church or not you're are going to face
[58:19] Hard Times regardless of whether you go
[58:22] to church on a Sunday or not tough times
[58:25] will come
[58:26] that is life that is that is blanket
[58:29] life uh it it it hits everybody it's it
[58:32] it is as an unforgiving sea raging on
[58:35] and on and regardless of who you are how
[58:38] rich you are or what your name is
[58:41] whether you're a big shot or your medium
[58:43] shot it doesn't matter uh what rank or
[58:46] status or file or social structure you
[58:49] have in life you are going to be hit by
[58:51] this Raging Sea at some point or the
[58:54] other you're going to be hit by by the
[58:56] storms of life you're going to have to
[58:59] face it uh uh doesn't matter where you
[59:01] come from or where you're going you're
[59:03] going to be faced with trials in some
[59:05] way but Jesus said my yoke is easy and
[59:09] my burden is light oh Hallelujah if you
[59:12] bear the Yol of this world you you'll
[59:14] have a weight to Bear but but if you
[59:16] carry my Yol oh it's a lot easier if you
[59:19] carry my burden oh there a much light to
[59:22] load so you do the math this tonight but
[59:24] I want the light to load tonight if I
[59:27] got to carry a load then oh Jesus give
[59:30] me the lighter one because oh Hallelujah
[59:32] sometimes it's just too
[59:35] much sometimes we need Jesus to take
[59:39] control one time my wife looked at me
[59:41] and she said how do atheists make it
[59:44] through how do people who don't believe
[59:47] that there is a God how are they getting
[59:50] through this life how do people who say
[59:53] there is no God David said is a fool had
[59:56] said there is no God she said how is it
[59:59] that people say there is no God how are
[1:00:02] they making it through this life because
[1:00:04] she said if anything I've learned to do
[1:00:06] is to trust in Jesus if there's anything
[1:00:09] I've learned how to do is to trust in
[1:00:12] God when all my intellect fails when all
[1:00:14] my memory and my strength and my ability
[1:00:17] fails that's when God's strength endures
[1:00:21] oh it endures a trial it endures a tough
[1:00:24] time it endures oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:00:27] it's not for the Swift it's not for the
[1:00:30] skill you don't even have to have
[1:00:33] talent all you've got to do is to be
[1:00:35] able to make the next step in the
[1:00:38] direction towards the cross that's all
[1:00:40] you've got to do sometimes that's all it
[1:00:43] come down to is a choice you make to
[1:00:47] serve God one more time oh Hallelujah
[1:00:51] Hall you don't even have to have
[1:00:52] education to do that oh that's just a
[1:00:55] choice that you make to love God despite
[1:00:58] the condition despite the trial and
[1:01:02] despite the situations that you are in
[1:01:05] you choose to say Lord you know better
[1:01:08] than I and I trust your will over
[1:01:11] mine I trust your your reasoning over
[1:01:14] mine your your understanding I I I'm in
[1:01:17] the midst of this storm I can't see my
[1:01:19] way out I don't know right from left I
[1:01:22] don't know up from down I'm trusting
[1:01:25] that he tonight has a higher perspective
[1:01:28] that he could navigate me that he can
[1:01:30] show me how to get out of this because
[1:01:33] I'm not able to do it on my own and and
[1:01:35] I believe when we come into that kind of
[1:01:37] a condition now we're ready to be
[1:01:40] yielded and molded and shaped by the
[1:01:42] master oh some he wants to he wants to
[1:01:46] get you trained but you're pulling
[1:01:48] against a chain you don't want to be
[1:01:50] subjective you don't want to be
[1:01:51] surrendered oh Hallelujah triy to hold
[1:01:54] you down and you're pulling against it
[1:01:55] pulling against it sometime you just got
[1:01:57] to leave you let You Yank on that chain
[1:01:59] and yell yell until you're finally ready
[1:02:01] to whimper down until you're finally
[1:02:04] ready to submit until you're finally
[1:02:05] ready to to to surrender to your
[1:02:08] situation to to the harness that God has
[1:02:10] you in so that he could now mold you and
[1:02:12] shape you because you can't go on uh
[1:02:16] pulling against the the the kicking
[1:02:18] against the Pricks isn't that right got
[1:02:21] to get you in a state of mind first

[1:02:29] amen that's what we come to do tonight
[1:02:31] we come to surrender to him Hallelujah
[1:02:33] so that we
[1:02:34] could understand it better by and by we
[1:02:38] won't all get it all at once um but when
[1:02:40] we look back we can be assured that we
[1:02:43] could see the plan of God unfolding
[1:02:46] throughout the years and give praise to
[1:02:48] what he has already done because at that
[1:02:50] point he's already done it and all he
[1:02:52] needs now is just all the praise and
[1:02:54] glory for what he had already brought
[1:02:56] you through even in times when you

[1:08:11] what is that man-made walls partition
[1:08:14] walls it look like it's a barrier but
[1:08:16] when you knock at the the the heart of
[1:08:18] it it's Hollow there's nothing inside it
[1:08:21] just it's just just a facade cutting you
[1:08:23] off with all these ideas and doctrines
[1:08:26] and and and wisdom of men and thing all
[1:08:28] throughout the years have cut people off
[1:08:30] isn't that right but we have promised
[1:08:32] the love of God to sweep in there like a
[1:08:34] flood and rise above all those
[1:08:37] partitions sweep away the Refuge of lies
[1:08:41] that they have hid themselves in and God
[1:08:43] will expose the lies expose the filth
[1:08:46] and he will bring in his mercy and his
[1:08:48] grace and his forgiveness and his pardon
[1:08:52] and his freedom because there is freedom
[1:08:54] in the name name of Jesus Amen isn't
[1:08:57] that right Hallelujah get together
[1:09:00] amenallah he said amen Prophet said
[1:09:03] where there's love God is love love
[1:09:06] suffers long and love is not provoked
[1:09:08] love is not puffed up when you get
[1:09:11] puffed up love is gone and where there's
[1:09:14] all this malice and strife and wars and
[1:09:17] envy and Malice against one another
[1:09:20] brother God just moves out that's all
[1:09:24] and it's a fact he said you could see it
[1:09:27] amen now you've got the right Road
[1:09:29] brother you've got the right path but
[1:09:31] what you need to do the prophet said is
[1:09:33] to come back together again for an
[1:09:36] oldfashioned uh zua Street meeting where
[1:09:40] the men and women will come together in
[1:09:42] all denominations break down all their
[1:09:44] barriers amen hallelujah is that right
[1:09:47] we say interpretations in the message
[1:09:48] and so on break down all their barriers
[1:09:51] and recognize one another as brothers
[1:09:53] and sisters in the Lord Jesus Jesus
[1:09:55] Christ amen isn't that right that's the
[1:09:58] prophet said that's what we need and we
[1:10:01] agree with that tonight amen hallelujah
[1:10:04] so when we
[1:10:05] endure we have to go through it uh it
[1:10:08] takes a lot more than what we've got in
[1:10:11] order to go through something isn't that
[1:10:13] right you have to have a a a strong
[1:10:16] resolve you have to have a real purpose
[1:10:19] you have to have a real vision and it
[1:10:21] takes Faith to reveal the vision of God
[1:10:24] it takes Faith to reveal the desire of
[1:10:26] God to you it takes a revelation to
[1:10:29] reveal it and Faith to stay with it
[1:10:31] isn't that right and stand on that
[1:10:33] Revelation that he give you 2
[1:10:36] Corinthians 4 but we have this treasure
[1:10:37] in Earth and vessels that the Excellency
[1:10:40] of the power of God uh may be of God and
[1:10:43] not of us Paul says we are troubled on
[1:10:46] every side but yet not distressed we are
[1:10:51] perplexed but not in despair oh
[1:10:54] Hallelujah persecuted but we are not
[1:10:57] forsaken we are cast down but we are not
[1:11:01] destroyed always bearing about in the
[1:11:04] body the dying of the Lord Jesus that
[1:11:07] the life also of Jesus might be made
[1:11:10] manifest in our body Hallelujah isn't
[1:11:13] that right oh in other words we're dying
[1:11:15] daily and that Life of Christ is being
[1:11:18] manifest in our body in our flesh in our
[1:11:21] works not of man that we should boast
[1:11:23] but but but in God Hal we could find
[1:11:26] strength we can find courage for another
[1:11:28] day we could find the right word for the
[1:11:30] situation it takes God to be able to do
[1:11:33] that it takes God to be able to give you
[1:11:36] a kind answer to turn away the Wrath to
[1:11:39] turn away um the situation to
[1:11:42] deescalate the work of the enemy it
[1:11:45] takes the wisdom of God to do that and I
[1:11:47] believe tonight there's a people in the
[1:11:49] land who under their messenger are going
[1:11:51] to find these seven things and put them
[1:11:54] all together praise God God for the
[1:11:56] glory of God that we could begin to live
[1:11:59] Christ in these last days that we could
[1:12:01] be as Christ Hallelujah to our brother
[1:12:04] to our sister praise God because some of
[1:12:06] them a book won't do it maybe a track
[1:12:08] won't do it they need to see a life
[1:12:10] living they need to see a reality they
[1:12:13] need to see God
[1:12:16] manifested and then they'll say what
[1:12:18] shall I do to be saved isn't that right
[1:12:21] oh my that's what we want to be our
[1:12:23] testimony our example of God therefore
[1:12:26] in order to endure something we have to
[1:12:28] possess certain qualities isn't that
[1:12:29] right in order to come out victoriously
[1:12:32] after having gone through it to endure
[1:12:34] means to withstand it means to persevere
[1:12:38] difficult
[1:12:39] situation requiring a combination of
[1:12:42] mental fortitude resilience and a strong
[1:12:46] sense of purpose this is what it means
[1:12:48] to This Is What It Takes into your uh
[1:12:50] the ability to adapt to challenges oh
[1:12:54] and the pyramid will help you adapt to
[1:12:55] challenges praise when you need patience
[1:12:58] he can patience will come out of you
[1:13:00] when you need virtue virtue will come
[1:13:01] out brotherly kindness will come out
[1:13:03] godliness will come out Hallelujah isn't
[1:13:05] that right he will give you the ability
[1:13:08] tonight to adapt to any challenge that
[1:13:11] you will face from here on out if you
[1:13:13] have these things in you amen and amen
[1:13:16] and often uh and uh they say you often
[1:13:19] need a support system to help you
[1:13:22] navigate through these hardships
[1:13:24] essentially especially when it takes uh
[1:13:26] uh it takes the capacity to remain
[1:13:28] steadfast even when facing adversity
[1:13:31] this is what it it takes in order to
[1:13:34] endure this is what you need to fortify
[1:13:37] yourself with and we know that the holy
[1:13:39] spirit gives us everything we need to
[1:13:41] fortify ourselves with what we need in
[1:13:44] order to face what we're going to face
[1:13:47] amen because we we can't avoid it amen
[1:13:50] amen hallelujah is not Goliath is coming
[1:13:54] ready or not praise God what you've got
[1:13:56] to know is you have what it takes to fa
[1:13:58] Goliath when you get there um but he
[1:14:01] will be there praise God you better
[1:14:03] believe that your God is there also amen
[1:14:06] that the Revival is in you praise God
[1:14:08] and you've got what it takes to conquer
[1:14:11] every devil on the field but to learn it
[1:14:13] to shame it takes God to do that in youj
[1:14:17] amen and amen and amen praise
[1:14:21] God perfect strength by Perfect weakness
[1:14:24] here's the brother R he says there's so
[1:14:26] many of us likes to testify or likes to
[1:14:28] think that we're insufficient and
[1:14:31] therefore we make that an excuse he says
[1:14:34] so this is like you say you don't have
[1:14:35] it you say I don't have any education I
[1:14:38] have no ability I'm unable to do this
[1:14:42] Prophet said if you keep that up and do
[1:14:44] that in that way you keep going like
[1:14:46] that then you can't amount to anything
[1:14:49] but the very thing that we make excuses
[1:14:52] by our weaknesses butam said God uses
[1:14:56] that very thing to tackle the job with
[1:15:00] oh Hallelujah can we say Amen see he
[1:15:04] waits for us to get to that condition so
[1:15:07] that he can use us isn't that right and
[1:15:10] we take the excuses and we say well I'm
[1:15:13] I I can't do this and so on in other
[1:15:15] words we believe the excuses amen is we
[1:15:17] are standing on the excuses rather than
[1:15:19] standing on what God said uh I'm
[1:15:22] insufficient uh I can't do it
[1:15:25] and God takes that very thing to do the
[1:15:28] job with he says that's true amen and
[1:15:31] that's the reason why he chooses us
[1:15:34] because we're in that condition he says
[1:15:36] now that sounds strange but just a few
[1:15:39] moments we'll get to the reason if God
[1:15:40] be willing he said we find out that just
[1:15:43] as we've been reading that weaknesses
[1:15:45] and
[1:15:46] rejections the prophet said we find out
[1:15:48] that those people who are the weakest
[1:15:51] and the rejected by the outside world is
[1:15:54] God's
[1:15:55] Heroes oh my that conquer in the front
[1:15:59] line those are God's Heroes that those
[1:16:02] uh takes those who are that feel
[1:16:04] themselves unworthy oh my that's what it
[1:16:08] takes my to to be used of God isn't that
[1:16:12] something let's read back Ecclesiastes 9
[1:16:14] again we read it uh just as we started
[1:16:17] right I return and so Under the Sun that
[1:16:19] the race is not to the Swift nor the
[1:16:22] battle to the strong neither yet yet
[1:16:25] bread to the wise yet riches uh to Men
[1:16:28] of understanding praise God and we've
[1:16:31] seen that we've seen rich people who who
[1:16:33] see might know split beans from coffee
[1:16:35] but they were able to put one and two
[1:16:37] together and make money praise God uh
[1:16:39] it's a it's it's it's astounding isn't
[1:16:42] that right nor yet favor to Men of skill
[1:16:45] but time and chance happeneth to them
[1:16:48] all in other words we are all faced with
[1:16:50] situations where we have to make a
[1:16:52] choice and that choice is what will
[1:16:55] ultimately Place us uh uh uh uh whether
[1:16:58] um uh in eternity or in damnation my
[1:17:02] that choice that can either place Us in
[1:17:04] life or death isn't that right oh my
[1:17:07] what this verse is suggesting is that in
[1:17:09] order to make it to the end actual
[1:17:12] overcoming comes down to a choice it is
[1:17:15] not as obvious as one thinks isn't that
[1:17:16] right amen if this Christian Journey Was
[1:17:19] a Race then this race would not be for
[1:17:21] the Swift a lot of people start off hot
[1:17:24] and Swift
[1:17:25] and they look like they're going to make
[1:17:27] it all the way through they all pumped
[1:17:29] they all ready they're dressed in the
[1:17:31] best Nike uh running shoes and they have
[1:17:33] on their Reebok uh t-shirt and they have
[1:17:36] on their dry fit and they they they've
[1:17:38] got their all their bandages in the
[1:17:39] right place and they've got their knee
[1:17:41] brace on and they Before the Race even
[1:17:43] starts they're jumping and they're
[1:17:45] they're looking like they're already
[1:17:46] muscly and they've got what it takes but
[1:17:49] but sometimes when it all boils down to
[1:17:51] it it come down to endurance it come
[1:17:54] down to who who can cross the finish
[1:17:56] line praise God Hallelujah at the end of
[1:17:58] it all can you even cross the finish
[1:18:01] line at all praise God because it's not
[1:18:03] a flat race it's not a short distance we
[1:18:06] in this thing for the Long Haul oh how
[1:18:09] we in this thing for the day in day out
[1:18:12] and though it get dreary though the road
[1:18:15] get tny no more pray oh stay in the
[1:18:20] spirit stay on fire soak up in the
[1:18:23] presence of the Lord
[1:18:25] hide me in the Cliff of The Rock and
[1:18:28] when my heart is overwhelmed lead me to
[1:18:31] the rock that is higher than I oh
[1:18:35] hallelujah hallelujah let me hide in his
[1:18:38] Pavilion hide in a secret place and find
[1:18:42] strength in the word of God find glory
[1:18:44] in his glory in his word uh find rest in
[1:18:47] his word uh because when the world gets
[1:18:50] weary when the world drains us we got to
[1:18:53] have something to lean on we got to be
[1:18:55] able to lean on prayer we got to be able
[1:18:57] to lean on the word got to be able to
[1:19:00] lean on Jesus Oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:19:04] job said though the skin worms destroy
[1:19:07] this body yet in my flesh I shall see
[1:19:11] God for myself and not another oh he had
[1:19:14] a promise from God that he was going to
[1:19:17] see God for himself no matter what
[1:19:20] Abraham went through oh he made mistakes
[1:19:23] along the way oh but God revealed he was
[1:19:27] going to have a son and come hell high
[1:19:30] water oh he had to make it oh he
[1:19:33] staggered not of the promise of God oh
[1:19:36] Hallelujah Hal but was strong in Praise
[1:19:40] giving Faith giving praise unto God oh
[1:19:43] hallelujah
[1:19:45] hallelujah oh when the going gets rough
[1:19:49] you've got to endure you've got to know
[1:19:52] that you
[1:19:53] know that who you're who you're working
[1:19:56] for in order to endure the tough times
[1:20:00] isn't that right Hallelujah the fastest
[1:20:03] may not be necessarily the ones to win
[1:20:04] this race it's not about skill it's not
[1:20:08] about a certain education or particular
[1:20:10] human skill when it all comes down to it
[1:20:12] it's a choice you make isn't that right
[1:20:14] there are people who are skilled to give
[1:20:16] up people who seem very promising isn't
[1:20:19] that right the good uh the seed the SE
[1:20:23] went forth to seow and seeds fell
[1:20:25] everywhere fell on the wayside it fell
[1:20:28] on the Thorns it fell on the Rocks some
[1:20:31] of them sprung up looked like they was
[1:20:33] going somewhere but then the cares of
[1:20:36] Life begin to wrap its way around them
[1:20:38] and legitimate things begin to tie them
[1:20:41] up legitimate things work and family and
[1:20:44] this and that and it started to become
[1:20:47] too much praise God and instead of
[1:20:49] leaning on Jesus they try to do it on
[1:20:50] their own oh Hallelujah and all of a
[1:20:53] sudden that seed begins to lose its grip
[1:20:56] it begins to lose its strength it begins
[1:20:58] to lose its fervor oh Hal begins to fall
[1:21:01] away from its first love all of a sudden
[1:21:04] begin to wax and get cold isn't that
[1:21:06] right oh Hallelujah not everyone is
[1:21:09] going to enter in not everyone is going
[1:21:11] to make it all the way to the end only
[1:21:14] those that fall upon good ground isn't
[1:21:17] that right praise God springing forth
[1:21:19] bringing forth 60 fold 80 fold 100 fold
[1:21:23] isn't that right so the seed is not the
[1:21:25] problem it's where you put it it's the
[1:21:28] environment you put the seed in because
[1:21:30] no man has power to make a seed grow all
[1:21:33] we got to do is create an environment
[1:21:34] for that seed to bring forth and Bud and
[1:21:38] Blossom and and show forth its Glory
[1:21:41] isn't that right no more than a Shepherd
[1:21:43] can make sheep uh make wool he cannot
[1:21:46] make the Sheep make wool the the Sheep
[1:21:48] makes wool on its own his job is to
[1:21:50] provide a safe environment for that
[1:21:53] sheep to Blossom and to prosper and to
[1:21:55] feed on the good alala weeds and to be
[1:21:59] in the right place with the happy
[1:22:00] sunshine and the safe cool nights and
[1:22:03] all of a sudden something naturally
[1:22:04] begins to happen wool begins to pop out
[1:22:06] of the sheep because it just comes
[1:22:08] naturally and and praise God if you are
[1:22:10] in the right environment tonight God
[1:22:12] knows there's a seed in your soul and is
[1:22:15] just waiting for the light to strike
[1:22:16] that seed uh and he's been cutting
[1:22:18] things away from your life cutting away
[1:22:21] negativity cutting away this happened
[1:22:23] and that happened cut cutting a away
[1:22:25] cutting a path for you tonight so that
[1:22:27] you could bur and Blossom and bring
[1:22:30] forth and do the things that he has in
[1:22:33] store for you he has inside of you
[1:22:36] Hallelujah you will show forth the
[1:22:37] Praises of his
[1:22:39] glory once you're in the right place
[1:22:41] isn't that right my God so we thank God
[1:22:44] to be in the right place at the right
[1:22:46] time God's got a promise for us tonight
[1:22:49] amen oh my so they choose to move
[1:22:51] forward despite what they're facing
[1:22:53] isn't that right that's that's what it
[1:22:54] means to
[1:22:56] endure amen uh uh so Hebrews 12 it says
[1:23:02] um for consider him that endureth such
[1:23:06] contradiction of Sinners against himself
[1:23:07] yes ye be woried and faint in your minds
[1:23:10] ye have not uh res yet resisted unto
[1:23:12] blood striving against sin and he have
[1:23:14] forgotten the exaltation which speaketh
[1:23:16] to you as unto children my son despise
[1:23:20] not thou the chastening of the Lord nor
[1:23:23] faint when Thou Art rebuked of him for
[1:23:27] who whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth
[1:23:30] and scourgeth every son whom he receive
[1:23:33] it you've got to enjoy chastening you
[1:23:36] got to enjoy correction it's not again
[1:23:38] it is not a pleasant experience enjoying
[1:23:40] is not talking about a walk in the park
[1:23:42] or a Bed of Roses it's not something you
[1:23:44] particularly enjoy but you have to go
[1:23:47] through in order to come out Victorious
[1:23:50] on the other side you have to go through
[1:23:52] it some people give up halfway and and
[1:23:54] say I don't need to go through all of
[1:23:56] this I could just take a shortcut or pay
[1:23:58] $2,000 to the guy at the desk and get in
[1:24:01] legal something and I'll be good and
[1:24:03] then all of a sudden something happens
[1:24:05] along the way that they're not thinking
[1:24:06] about that that that stunts your growth
[1:24:10] when you could have stayed in the
[1:24:11] atmosphere when you could have stayed in
[1:24:13] the right place and done the right
[1:24:15] things you'd have made it out alive
[1:24:17] you'd have made it out successful um but
[1:24:20] some people don't go into the thing
[1:24:21] right and they end up with a scrap peap
[1:24:24] isn't
[1:24:25] my so see so we want to run the race and
[1:24:28] endure in this race the race that is set
[1:24:32] before us amen he said but um for whom
[1:24:35] God loveth he chasen it scourgeth every
[1:24:38] son whom he receiveth if you endure
[1:24:41] chastening God dealth with you as with
[1:24:44] sons for what son is he whom the father
[1:24:47] chasteneth not but if you be without
[1:24:50] chastisement whereof all all are
[1:24:53] partakers
[1:24:55] in other words all these Heroes of Faith
[1:24:56] were chastised at some point in time
[1:24:59] amen amen praise go when you make it to
[1:25:00] the other side you're going to hear
[1:25:01] Moses tell his story and Joshua tell his
[1:25:04] story and Joseph tell his story and this
[1:25:06] one and that one isn't that right they
[1:25:08] had to go through their stuff but they
[1:25:10] come through Victorious and if you go
[1:25:12] through your stuff with Jesus you're
[1:25:14] going to come through Victorious tonight
[1:25:17] isn't that right Joseph had no clue that
[1:25:21] he would have to go through Jail and to
[1:25:23] be wrong wrongfully accused of a
[1:25:26] trifling Woman by the uh poyer's wife we
[1:25:29] don't have her name but we know that she
[1:25:32] she she was a home wrecker she was a
[1:25:34] kind of a
[1:25:36] character and I think about her because
[1:25:38] her story almost seemingly just left
[1:25:41] unfinished you know we never hear about
[1:25:43] poyer's wife later on in the story I
[1:25:46] don't know if she ever got arrested
[1:25:47] later on down for for her trifling ways
[1:25:50] I don't know if she ever got caught if
[1:25:52] if her judgments ever got caught up with
[1:25:53] her the Bible never revealed whatever
[1:25:55] happened to Piper's wife as far as we
[1:25:58] know she's a dignitary's wife she went
[1:26:00] to the best restaurants she had a really
[1:26:02] nice wedding photography shoot at her
[1:26:04] wedding all of the best were there the
[1:26:07] Prime Minister and his wife was there
[1:26:09] and all the other dignitaries were there
[1:26:11] she has clinking glasses with the best
[1:26:13] she drinks from the best she has the
[1:26:16] best she has access to the best I pray
[1:26:18] isn't that right and here was Joseph
[1:26:20] just an immigrant slave trying to make
[1:26:22] his way through trying to keep his head
[1:26:24] low and do his N9 to five ends up in
[1:26:27] prison wrongfully accused from a woman
[1:26:29] who has everything got going for her and
[1:26:31] yet she still wants to step out of her
[1:26:33] crease to get something she feels she
[1:26:36] deserved and got him in trouble for it
[1:26:39] that seemed very unfair there's no story
[1:26:41] that tells us that Piper's wife ever got
[1:26:44] chastised or ever got thrown in prison
[1:26:46] or ever if that story was ever resolved
[1:26:49] but guess what tonight the story is not
[1:26:50] about Piper's wife the story is about
[1:26:53] Joseph
[1:26:54] and the story is not about anybody who
[1:26:56] accuse you or try to destroy you or try
[1:26:59] to discredit you or try to to take you
[1:27:01] down or try to V victimize your
[1:27:04] character the story is not about them
[1:27:06] tonight the story is about you the story
[1:27:10] is about how you going to run your race
[1:27:13] oh are you going to finish your course
[1:27:15] are you going to do what God called you
[1:27:17] to do are you going to stand for
[1:27:19] righteousness are you going to get the
[1:27:21] Holy Ghost and get out of here for this
[1:27:24] world is not my home I'm just passing
[1:27:28] through tonight and the devil is a liar
[1:27:31] no matter what he tried to throw at me
[1:27:33] or stick at me it won't stay because his
[1:27:38] grace is
[1:27:39] sufficient for me his his pardon Release
[1:27:43] Me From Any prison that the world can
[1:27:46] put me
[1:27:47] into I'm already free and who the son of
[1:27:50] man sets free is free indeed do you
[1:27:54] believe it tonight amen oh my we're
[1:27:56] getting ready to wind down you've been
[1:27:58] such a wonderful audience
[1:28:00] tonight
[1:28:01] amen praise God so he talks about
[1:28:04] chastising and so for like that isn't
[1:28:06] that right now no chastising at for the
[1:28:09] present seem to be joyous but Grievious
[1:28:11] nevertheless afterward if yield it
[1:28:14] yielded Peaceable fruit of righteousness
[1:28:16] unto them which are exercised thereby
[1:28:20] wherefore lift up the hands which hang
[1:28:22] down and the feeble knees is not is that
[1:28:24] right give God praise stay in prayer
[1:28:27] hallu and make path straight for your
[1:28:28] feet lest that which is lame be turned
[1:28:31] out of the way but let uh let it rather
[1:28:33] be healed isn't that right oh my okay so
[1:28:36] I think we got the message there Amen
[1:28:40] brother baham said God pro uh Covenant
[1:28:42] with Abraham he said God doesn't take uh
[1:28:44] make any difference between his children
[1:28:46] every son that cometh to God must first
[1:28:48] be tried or chastised you get it first
[1:28:52] be tried or chastened or corrected
[1:28:54] child train
[1:28:56] schooled everyone not one exception
[1:29:00] everyone there's no exemption
[1:29:03] form there's no exemption form you could
[1:29:05] fill out and say well I want to be
[1:29:06] Exempted from this trial because I have
[1:29:09] a bad ankle uh or because I I have a
[1:29:12] little more money in my bank account
[1:29:13] than the other guy there's no exemption
[1:29:16] forms if you fill out an exemption forms
[1:29:18] it gets thrown into the bin the bin is
[1:29:20] where we put all the exemption forms
[1:29:22] from the ones who want to escape the
[1:29:25] trial because there really is no escape
[1:29:27] from The Trial tonight everyone that
[1:29:29] cometh to God must go through trials and
[1:29:32] testing isn't that right the prophet
[1:29:34] said have you went through trials have
[1:29:36] you went through tribulation have you
[1:29:37] suffered persecution then you endure
[1:29:40] these things and you're are real
[1:29:42] children of God Prophet said Hallelujah
[1:29:44] but when you can't bear chastisement
[1:29:46] when the rod comes down heavy and you
[1:29:48] run off and back into the world the
[1:29:50] Bible said you are illegitimate children
[1:29:53] and not the the children of God for when
[1:29:56] a man's born of the spirit of God he
[1:29:58] expects those things oh my wonderful he
[1:30:02] expects those things he's looking for
[1:30:04] correction because he wants to see how
[1:30:06] he can get better isn't that right and
[1:30:09] you learn more from your failures than
[1:30:11] your
[1:30:12] successes you learn more from the stuff
[1:30:15] you did wrong than when you're on top of
[1:30:17] the mountain it's the valley that
[1:30:18] teaches us how to trust God it's a
[1:30:20] valley that teaches us how to temper our
[1:30:23] faith it's a Valley that teaches us how
[1:30:25] to wait on God wait for God and get
[1:30:29] right with God so that we when we're on
[1:30:31] the top it just reflects the things
[1:30:34] we've learned when we are at the bottom
[1:30:37] amen isn't that right he loves those
[1:30:40] things and the Bible said that when the
[1:30:41] Trials come upon us fiery trials it is
[1:30:44] more precious than gold to US think of
[1:30:47] it the prophet said so you see with
[1:30:50] these ups and downs they've never been
[1:30:51] in there at the first place they just uh
[1:30:53] make believe amen salvation is for
[1:30:55] believers not unbelievers or make
[1:30:57] Believers it's for True genuine
[1:31:00] Believers and it's not a case of Law and
[1:31:03] God's going to make you do something but
[1:31:05] it's because you love to do it amen amen
[1:31:09] praise God what the prophet say they
[1:31:11] will love him and they will keep his
[1:31:13] Commandments they will have thus sayth
[1:31:14] the Lord or they will keep still amen
[1:31:17] that's the Bride of the last day do you
[1:31:19] believe it endure see the important
[1:31:23] thing Prophet said one of the important
[1:31:24] things we must Master now remember thise

[1:31:33] we've got to master if we expect to
[1:31:35] fulfill God's desire in our life that is
[1:31:38] we have to master the thought of human
[1:31:40] ability if we ever get to a spot where
[1:31:43] we think we can do it on our own oh my
[1:31:47] oh wonderful intelligence and our own
[1:31:49] abilities we've got to master that in
[1:31:51] such a way that we could get rid of the
[1:31:54] thing oh kick it out entirely that's
[1:31:57] wonderful amen and lay it aside so that
[1:32:00] God can use us that's right and make a
[1:32:04] complete surrender oh I love this we
[1:32:07] cannot use one ability we've got to make
[1:32:10] a complete surrender and come to God
[1:32:13] you've got to surrender to him both soul
[1:32:16] body and spirit everything that you are
[1:32:20] has to be surrendered to God in order
[1:32:22] that he can work his will
[1:32:24] in you and me oh do you believe that
