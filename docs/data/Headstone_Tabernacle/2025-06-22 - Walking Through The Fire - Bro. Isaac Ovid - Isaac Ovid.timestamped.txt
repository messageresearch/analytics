[26:45] [Music]
[26:50] Blessed be the name

[27:15] Heavenly Father, we come into your house
[27:18] this morning, Lord.
[27:22] Lord, your house of correction, your
[27:24] house of training, your house of
[27:27] healing.
[27:28] your house of restoration.
[27:31] The question was asked, "Is there a bomb
[27:33] in Gill?
[27:35] Is there a physician here?"
[27:38] Lord, you said they that are well have
[27:40] no need of a physician. Lord, we are all
[27:43] here because we have come with
[27:45] situations
[27:47] looking for a doctor. Not just any
[27:50] doctor, but the great physician who is
[27:53] able to not just look at the symptoms,
[27:55] but dig deep into the root cause of the
[27:57] problem and permanently deal with the
[28:00] issues of life that affect us in our
[28:04] daily walk, in our homes, in our jobs,
[28:06] in our marriages, in our family
[28:08] situations. And Lord, the secret sins,
[28:11] the sins that easily beset us, the
[28:14] chains and the weights. and he's able to
[28:16] write a prescription to permanently
[28:18] reverse the situation. Father, Lord, we
[28:21] thank you this morning for your
[28:23] presence, the angel of the Lord that's
[28:24] in our midst to help us to go through
[28:27] the journey. You promise to never leave
[28:28] us. You promise to never forsake us. You
[28:30] promise to be with us, Lord, and to even
[28:33] go further, to be even in us, Lord,
[28:35] until the end of this terrestrial, this
[28:38] earthly journey, Father, until we leave
[28:40] this place, Father. Lord, we pray dear
[28:42] God for every brother, every sister here
[28:44] this morning that the angel of the Lord
[28:46] would speak to your children both here
[28:48] in the sanctuary and those that are
[28:50] connected online. May the angel of the
[28:52] Lord speak to each one. If there's
[28:55] someone that's backsliden this morning,
[28:57] may they come to restoration. If there's
[28:59] someone tired, weary, may you raise them
[29:02] up and give them strength like the eagle
[29:04] could renew the strength of the eagle.
[29:06] Father Lord, there are many have been
[29:08] standing in the battlefield for a long
[29:11] seen brothers come, seen sisters go,
[29:13] seen wounded soldiers, fallen soldiers,
[29:16] but here they are this morning on June
[29:18] the 22nd. They are still standing,
[29:21] Father. They might be wounded. They
[29:23] might be battered, but they are still
[29:24] eagles at their post of duty. Looking up
[29:28] for their redemption joy, looking for
[29:30] the captain of the host, Lord, who is
[29:32] mighty in battle, captain of our
[29:35] salvation, who promised to lead us
[29:37] through every trial.
[29:40] Lord, we give clearance. We give
[29:42] permission this morning to walk through
[29:43] the doors of our hearts, the doors of
[29:46] our lives. You are a gentleman. You said
[29:48] if any man th you said, I stand at the
[29:50] door and knock. If any man open up, I'll
[29:52] come in. Lord, we thank you that you are
[29:54] not a God that boss through situations,
[29:57] but we welcome you this morning in the
[29:59] sanctuary. We welcome you in the church
[30:01] this morning. We welcome you in our
[30:02] hearts this morning. We welcome you in
[30:04] our situations, the ones we have tried
[30:06] to fix ourselves and then we have come
[30:08] short. We welcome you this morning. We
[30:11] give you permission to move anything
[30:12] that needs to be moved, to throw out
[30:15] anything that need to be thrown out,
[30:17] restore anything that needs to be
[30:18] restored. We we don't care about these
[30:20] natural things, Father. Whatever you
[30:22] want to do, Father, do it this morning.
[30:27] Lord, naked we came into this world and
[30:29] naked we will leave. Father, the only
[30:31] thing that is a currency that is
[30:33] transferable over there is our
[30:35] character, Father. So, Lord, help us
[30:37] through the word this morning to hone
[30:38] and shape our character, Father. Lord,
[30:41] help us to cut out the things from us
[30:43] that don't belong. When we look into the
[30:45] mirror of the word, we could say just
[30:46] see Jesus looking back at us. Father,
[30:49] may you take me out of the way and speak
[30:51] lip to ear to your people in the
[30:54] precious name of Jesus Christ. May you
[30:56] bless the reading of the word and the
[30:57] hearing of the word to understanding in
[31:00] the precious name of Jesus Christ. And
[31:02] the church says, and the church says,
[31:05] Amen. Turn your brother sister.
[31:22] [Music]
[31:26] My home,
[31:28] [Music]
[31:37] [Music]
[31:41] whatever you do, Lord,
[31:44] Don't pass me by.
[31:51] Not today, Lord. Not in this season. Not
[31:53] in this hour, Lord. If I ever needed you
[31:55] as this morning, calling you.
[32:00] [Music]
[32:05] Lord, if I ever needed you this morning,
[32:07] hear my humble cry.
[32:13] [Music]
[32:15] I don't want to be left standing when I
[32:17] have all these promises.
[32:21] [Music]
[32:37] Can we give the Lord one more hand of
[32:39] praise? I greet you this morning in the
[32:42] wonderful matchless name of our Lord and
[32:45] Savior Jesus Christ.
[32:47] Before you take your seats, let's just

[32:57] scripture from the book of Romans 8.
[33:00] Read from verse 14.
[33:06] For as many as are led by the spirit of
[33:09] God,
[33:11] they are the sons of God. So this is a
[33:15] conditionality in scripture.
[33:18] To be identified as a son of God, you
[33:20] must be led by
[33:23] the Bible said as many as are led by the
[33:25] spirit of God, they are sons of God. So
[33:27] it's not a you can walk around saying
[33:29] I'm a son. I'm a son. If the spirit you
[33:31] have to ask question
[33:33] for ye have not received the spirit of
[33:35] bondage again to fear, but you have
[33:37] received the spirit of adoption whereby
[33:39] we cry, abare
[33:44] witness with our spirit.
[33:46] that we are the children of God. And if
[33:50] children, then means we have something
[33:52] that we ought to expect, something we
[33:54] ought to receive, something that we are
[33:56] entitled to.
[33:59] God and joint ears with Christ. Again,
[34:02] another conditionality in scripture if
[34:06] that we suffer with him. In other words,
[34:09] this thing we just read is conditional
[34:11] on the basis that you are able to suffer
[34:15] with him. If you are not prepared for
[34:17] the suffering that is part of the
[34:19] suffering with him, this scripture we
[34:22] just read could be removed because it's
[34:25] a conditionality. It is dependent on
[34:27] something. So if children then of God
[34:31] and joint hes with Christ, if so be that
[34:35] we suffer with him that we may be also
[34:39] glorified together. For I reckon that
[34:43] the sufferings of this present time are
[34:46] not worthy to be compared with the glory
[34:49] which shall be revealed in us. For the
[34:51] earnest expectation of the creature
[34:53] awaitth for the manifestation of the
[34:55] sons of God. May the Lord add a blessing
[34:57] to the reading of his word. You may be
[34:58] seated in the presence of the Lord this
[35:00] morning. And can we give the Lord a hand
[35:02] of praise? It's certainly good to be in
[35:04] the house of the Lord
[35:07] on June the 22nd, 2025 and to be able to
[35:11] gather under the canopy of life, where
[35:14] there is hope, where there is
[35:15] opportunity, where there is safety,
[35:16] where there is comfort. I bring
[35:18] greetings from Ghana, from Brother Olu,
[35:23] from the believers there. I was home on
[35:26] Thursday evening
[35:30] as you retreat of God. I had the
[35:33] opportunity to speak to the purchase of
[35:35] the blood of Jesus Christ over there. A
[35:38] tremendous time in the Lord and I was
[35:41] able to strike something
[35:44] the
[35:46] glory which shall be revealed in us. And
[35:49] I took it from the scripture here in
[35:51] Romans 8.
[35:53] For I reckon that the sufferings of this
[35:55] present time are not worthy to be
[35:58] compared with the glory which shall be
[36:00] revealed in us. So I want to connect a
[36:04] few things in there for us this morning
[36:06] and have a different title. Title this
[36:08] morning is walking through the fire.
[36:13] We have to walk through the fire.
[36:17] Hallelujah. Everybody feeling fine?
[36:20] Wonderful. So before we get to the
[36:21] message,
[36:23] unless you have been living under Iraq,
[36:28] you would know that the
[36:30] war between Middle Eastern conflict
[36:36] of conflict has accelerated over the
[36:40] last few days or so,
[36:46] Americans.
[36:54] they believe
[36:56] in.
[37:00] And we are seeing scripture fulfilled
[37:02] before us.
[37:03] Many times many of us who are not part
[37:06] of that geographical area or at first
[37:10] glance the economic impact implication
[37:12] of these things we may consider
[37:14] ourselves immune
[37:16] not realizing that everything is
[37:18] connected and through the word the
[37:21] taught us that wars are really spiritual
[37:23] forces
[37:26] dealing with one another and that what
[37:28] is being manifested in the natural is
[37:31] only an expression of what exists in
[37:34] There's a war for this earth. There's a
[37:37] war for dominion. There's a war for the
[37:40] elements. In fact, the enemy is called
[37:43] the prince of the power of the air
[37:45] because there's a jurisdictional power
[37:47] that comes with an authority of
[37:48] dominion. But when you read future home
[37:51] where the random tells us that the same
[37:54] water and fire and all these things that
[37:56] come to the believer, the same that
[37:58] happens to the earth as well. That one
[38:00] of these days the earth will
[38:03] And the same way that God treat the
[38:05] believers the way he treat the earth
[38:06] that that that that all the spiritual
[38:08] forces that are in the air that we
[38:10] battle not against flesh and blood but
[38:12] principalities and powers and spiritual
[38:14] wickedness that there's a fire to come.
[38:18] That same fire that baptizes the
[38:20] believer and does a transformation in
[38:23] that believer is the same fire that
[38:25] comes upon the earth to burn the earth
[38:26] with a fervent heat and spirits will be
[38:29] destroyed in that fire. Demonic forces
[38:32] will be destroyed in that fire because
[38:34] our God is a consuming fire.
[38:37] Can the church say amen? But the fire
[38:40] that comes to burn the earth or burn the
[38:41] elements or burn things around us, it
[38:43] can only do so much to the believer.
[38:47] Can the church say amen? Because you
[38:49] cannot get burnt in that fire.
[38:53] The fire to us is a cleansing fire, but
[38:56] to the enemy it's a burning fire. But
[38:59] our God is a consuming fire. He could
[39:01] consume everything that is not supposed
[39:03] to be there. So even when you come into
[39:04] the house of God and there's a fire in
[39:06] the place, that fire is doing a number
[39:09] of things. It's demons can stand in the
[39:11] fire. But sons of God could stand in the
[39:13] fire and they could walk through
[39:17] walk through the fire. Can the church
[39:19] say amen? I'm trying to lay a
[39:21] foundation. having a bit of a
[39:23] conversation this morning because we
[39:25] have not been this way before. And we
[39:27] are dependent on the Holy Ghost to lead
[39:29] us through some dark waters, to lead us
[39:32] through some rough patches, to lead us
[39:35] through some situations. Because at the
[39:36] end of the day, naked we came into this
[39:39] world and naked we will leave. The only
[39:41] thing that is transferable, we said it
[39:42] in a prayer, is your character. So your
[39:45] house will burn, your car will burn,
[39:46] your bank account will burn, the bank
[39:48] will burn, but your character
[39:52] that cannot be destroyed. Your character
[39:54] will change its dwelling place. That's
[39:56] the real you. And the real you is a
[39:59] product of the seed that in you that
[40:00] turns into something. That's why the
[40:02] prophet can say you are not even the
[40:04] believer. But the word in you that's the
[40:06] believer. You couldn't come this morning
[40:08] unless there was a word seed in you. You
[40:11] could not bring yourself. This is too
[40:13] exclusive. You don't hear me this
[40:15] morning. This is by invitation only. You
[40:18] can't just show up in the house of God
[40:20] unless he called you because he said all
[40:22] that the father had given me, they will
[40:24] come. Something in you woke you up this
[40:27] morning. I've preached it many times.
[40:30] You didn't wake up your alarm clock
[40:31] didn't wake you up this morning. Go put
[40:33] your alarm clock in the morg and see if
[40:35] it wakes up anybody. They're already
[40:37] dead. But the Holy Ghost woke you up
[40:39] this morning because there's a role you
[40:41] have to play in the economy of God.
[40:47] And that role is to stand. That role is
[40:49] to overcome. That role is to win. There
[40:52] must be a hunger in you to win.
[40:56] You heard what I said. There's got to be
[40:57] a hunger in you to win. There's got to
[40:59] be a hunger in you for your family to
[41:00] win. There's got to be a hunger in you
[41:02] for you to overcome in the natural and
[41:04] in the spiritual. There's got to be a
[41:07] testimony that God is working with you.
[41:10] They've got to take note that you've
[41:12] been with Jesus. They've got to take
[41:14] note that the message found good ground
[41:16] in your heart and that the seed planted
[41:19] by the messenger of the hour has taken
[41:22] root and has brought forth root seed
[41:24] after its own kind. It cannot bring
[41:26] forth something else.
[41:30] It could only bring forth seed after its
[41:32] kind.
[41:35] So prepare yourself because we have some
[41:37] rough waters ahead. I remember when I
[41:39] was a young Christian I read quotes
[41:40] where but the man said it's not an easy
[41:42] journey and we look at it many times as
[41:45] if trials and testings are an
[41:47] interruption of the journey.
[41:51] So it's almost like I have this journey
[41:52] and I in a trial and I'm in a testing
[41:55] but I begin to realize George this
[41:57] journey is one of suffering.
[42:01] The interruption is the mountain but we
[42:03] have to spend more time in the valley or
[42:05] you don't hear me this morning.
[42:09] This is not the kind of sh and jump for
[42:11] joy. So good to see you. You brave the
[42:15] weather. You brave the elements.
[42:17] Show up in the in the house of the Lord.
[42:21] May God bless you for the effort. God
[42:23] takes note of every effort you Oh yes.
[42:28] Not one will be left behind. Not one.
[42:31] You hear what I said, parents? Not one
[42:33] will be left behind. We're not leaving
[42:35] one behind. I don't care where she is,
[42:37] where he is, what they doing, what the
[42:40] devil said, what they say, it doesn't
[42:42] matter. All that the father had given me
[42:45] must come.
[42:48] Don't worry about him. You can't fix the
[42:50] problem. But he can. You don't hear me
[42:53] this morning. He is bigger than whatever
[42:55] situation your daughter is going
[42:56] through. Bigger than whatever situation
[42:58] your son is going through. Bigger than
[43:00] the demonic influence upon their life.
[43:02] The house of hell has got to give way to
[43:04] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. By
[43:06] the power vested in me by the authority
[43:11] by the Holy Ghost himself. All that was
[43:13] in God, he poured it to Christ. All that
[43:15] was in Christ, he bought it here in this
[43:17] church. We have got to claim it for this
[43:19] church.
[43:21] I can't speak for any other church, but
[43:23] for this church, we claim it.
[43:26] Not one shall be left behind. You are
[43:28] going to be filled. You are going to be
[43:30] delivered. You are going to be free.
[43:32] You're going to be shouting on the hills
[43:33] of glory.
[43:36] There's going to be shouting on the
[43:38] hills of glory.
[43:42] Joy unspeakable,
[43:44] full of glory. I'm just encouraging you
[43:46] this morning to lift your head up, to
[43:49] square your shoulders back. We have had
[43:51] tough times. Tougher times are yet to
[43:53] come. But you're going to walk through
[43:55] the fire.
[43:57] You're going to walk through your trial.
[43:59] You have more trials to come. Yes, you
[44:01] have more trials to get.
[44:07] But Isaac, how is this an encouragement?
[44:11] How are you encourage this morning have
[44:13] more trials again?
[44:16] Because the word say God cannot give you
[44:18] more than you could bear. And what he's
[44:20] given you is to prepare you for
[44:21] something greater.
[44:24] So for David was the lion and the bear,
[44:26] but Goliath was always coming. Do you
[44:28] understand? Goliath was always on the
[44:30] plan. God had throwing Goliath, he was
[44:32] always there. But God knew if David
[44:34] didn't deal with the lion and the bear,
[44:36] he could never face Goliath. But because
[44:38] he still could look at Goliath and he
[44:41] could refer to his experience and he
[44:42] said, "But wait, let me tell you
[44:43] something. I was taking care of the
[44:45] sheep. And one time the lion came and I
[44:48] dealt with the lion. And another time
[44:49] the bear came and I dealt with the bear.
[44:52] And from my experience in those trials,
[44:55] I know my God is able to deal with this
[44:58] Goliath.
[45:01] This is nothing new to me. I've dealt
[45:03] with problems before. I've dealt with
[45:05] sickness before. I've dealt with
[45:07] backsliders before. I've dealt with
[45:09] minor devils before. Bring on the real
[45:11] devil. I know who I am.
[45:15] Can the church say, "Amen." You've got
[45:17] to be confident. You've got to be
[45:20] confident.
[45:22] Not just in yourself. You have to be
[45:24] confident in yourself, but confident in
[45:26] the God who brought you through. You
[45:28] couldn't be here this morning if God
[45:30] didn't call you. If God didn't bring you
[45:32] through. Can the church say amen?
[45:42] I'm just talking to you this morning.
[45:53] I read the scripture before and I read
[45:56] it over there in Ghana as well in Isaiah
[45:57] 43.
[45:59] But now thus say the Lord that created
[46:02] thee, oh Jacob, and he that formed the
[46:05] Israel. Fear not for I have redeemed.
[46:11] Who knew he called? who he called
[46:14] justified, who he justified. He had
[46:16] already glorified. The devil looking at
[46:18] you as if you're the same way you were
[46:19] yesterday. And God is speaking about you
[46:21] in the past tense because he already see
[46:24] the end from the beginning. He already
[46:25] see you shouting. He see you with the
[46:27] Holy Ghost. He see you adopted. He see
[46:29] you walking over the devils that been
[46:30] tying you up. He see you victorious. He
[46:33] see you perfect.
[46:35] So you can say who he for you, he
[46:37] called. Who he called, he justified. Who
[46:39] he justified, he hath already glorified.
[46:42] What shall we then say to these things?
[46:44] If God before us, tell me what devil
[46:47] could be against me, what bill could be
[46:49] against me? What sickness could be
[46:51] against me? What family situation could
[46:53] be against me?
[46:57] What child? What test? What problem?
[47:06] Listen to the scripture. This is Isaiah
[47:08] 43. I have called thee by thy name.
[47:13] So God is not in this group thing by he
[47:16] knows your name. We sing the song many
[47:19] songs we sing many things we don't
[47:21] understand it from a personal experience
[47:23] perspective. He said I have called thee
[47:25] by thy name. Thou art mine.
[47:30] Do you know you belong to God? Brother
[47:32] Andrew, sisterana, come on now. Do you
[47:34] know you belong to God?
[47:37] Sister Abigail, do you know you belong
[47:39] to God? And because you belong to him,
[47:41] you have to operate a certain way.
[47:45] Because your life is his life, you are
[47:47] his property. You are for his glory. You
[47:50] are for his honor, not your honor. You
[47:52] exist for his name's sake.
[47:55] You exist to give him glory.
[48:00] Can we talk this morning?
[48:03] Don't get scared. I'm not preaching.
[48:04] Let's having a conversation with the
[48:06] church.
[48:09] He said, "Thou art mine." Then he goes
[48:11] on, "When thou passes through the
[48:13] waters, I will be with thee."
[48:17] So it doesn't matter what tribe you're
[48:19] going through, have you looked for the
[48:20] Lord in the midst of your trial?
[48:23] I say, "Look for your phone. I say look
[48:25] for your neighbor. I say, have you
[48:27] looked to the Lord?" Because he said, "I
[48:29] will be with thee when thou passest
[48:32] through the waters. I will be with thee.
[48:34] And through the rivers, they shall not
[48:36] overflow thee." And listen to this. When
[48:39] thou walkest through the fire,
[48:42] that's where I got the title from.
[48:43] Walking through the fire. When thou, not
[48:46] if you walk through the fire, but when
[48:48] you walk through the fire, I want you to
[48:50] understand the trial is not a optional.
[48:54] It's not a random check. No. When you go
[48:56] through the fire, when you're in the
[48:58] middle of your trial, when you're back
[49:00] against the wall. Oh, come on now.
[49:07] When thou walst through the fire, thou
[49:09] shalt not be burned,
[49:12] neither shall the flame kindle upon
[49:14] thee. For I am the Lord thy God, the
[49:17] Holy One of Israel, thy Savior. I gave
[49:20] Egypt for thy ransom, Ethiopia and Sabre
[49:24] for thee. God is saying, I move
[49:26] governments for you. I move lands for
[49:28] you. I changed the laws for you because
[49:31] you belong to me. Can the church give
[49:33] the Lord a hand of praise?
[49:41] No wonder the Hebrew boys actually live
[49:44] this out, you know, because they were in
[49:46] the fire, brother Lynon, and they were
[49:48] walking through the fire. It looked like
[49:50] if they were they were prepared to die,
[49:52] you know.
[49:55] They said, "We will not bow down. Our
[49:58] God is able to deliver us.
[50:03] But even if he doesn't, we will still
[50:05] not bow down. And they walked into the
[50:08] fire prepared to pay the consequence of
[50:10] the fire. They were mentally prepared to
[50:13] burn.
[50:15] Are you prepared to suffer for your
[50:18] conviction?
[50:19] Are you prepared to bear the reproach?
[50:22] You struggling to cover your knee. You
[50:24] struggling to play Christian music. You
[50:26] struggle. But here it was. These men
[50:27] were saying, "We will not bow down. We
[50:29] don't care how good it looks. We don't
[50:31] care how nice it is. We are not going to
[50:33] bow down. We have seen too much in this
[50:35] message. God has been too good to us for
[50:39] us to bow down in 2025. We have seen too
[50:42] many prophecies fulfilled. All hell is
[50:45] against us. I don't care if brother so
[50:47] and so bow down. I am not bowing down. I
[50:50] don't care if sister so and so is bowing
[50:53] down. I am not going to bow down. And
[50:56] they're walking step by step. They had a
[50:58] choice.
[51:00] And listen friends, this is what I want
[51:03] you to get. God at any point in time
[51:05] could have stopped the fire before they
[51:07] got there. You know,
[51:09] he is God.
[51:11] At any point in time, we could have
[51:12] turned on the fire and and they say the
[51:14] car light it and light the fire out. But
[51:17] what glory God will get if the fire out.
[51:20] When God say you will walk to the fire
[51:22] and the fire wouldn't burn you. You
[51:24] don't hear me this morning. I said in
[51:26] Ghana we have scriptures missing limbs
[51:29] will be restored. Nobody want to
[51:31] volunteer to lose a limb.
[51:36] The sick have to be healed. Nobody want
[51:38] to volunteer to be sick. The dead have
[51:41] to be raised up. Nobody want to
[51:42] volunteer to be dead. But God has to do
[51:45] the choosing. He take a limb here. He
[51:48] throw in a better sickness here. He take
[51:50] this one home. All that scripture could
[51:52] be fulfilled. And there's a scripture
[51:54] that needs be fulfilled that somebody
[51:56] got to walk through fire and then not
[51:59] get burnt. And that was not just a
[52:00] testimony for those Hebrew boys, but
[52:03] it's our testimony. You are going to
[52:05] walk through fire and you're not going
[52:06] to get burnt because there's a fire in
[52:09] your soul
[52:12] that makes you fireproof. It sounds
[52:14] crazy, but it's the truth.
[52:20] Do you know that God already judged you?
[52:22] And because God already judged you, you
[52:24] already judge, you can't go back to
[52:26] judgments again. You don't hear me this
[52:27] morning. He already paid your case. He
[52:31] already died for you. When they're
[52:33] looking to pull your case, they say case
[52:35] dismissed. You cannot get tried for what
[52:37] you didn't do because your case already
[52:39] paid for.
[52:44] You don't hear me this morning. when the
[52:47] devil come because the Bible said the
[52:49] devil is the accuser you know he will
[52:51] say sister come you know what they did
[52:53] and every time he bring the case to
[52:55] present the case they say pull the
[52:56] records but somebody already paid the
[52:58] price here
[53:01] we can't charge you again if if listen
[53:04] if you get a ticket on the road
[53:07] and you go to try to pay the ticket and
[53:09] you didn't know somebody paid the ticket
[53:11] for you you know they can't take
[53:16] You have the ticket. They say I have a
[53:19] ticket here. But brother, I'm telling
[53:21] you, somebody paid
[53:23] you. They saying, "But I want to pay the
[53:24] ticket." You can't pay the ticket. We
[53:27] can't. We have no system to collect the
[53:28] money because the ticket paid. Who paid
[53:30] the ticket? Well, I know who paid the
[53:32] ticket. But we know who paid our ticket.
[53:34] Jesus paid our ticket.
[53:41] And this is why you got to walk around
[53:43] without condemnation, without fear. Yes,
[53:46] you made a mistake, but the ticket paid.
[53:50] The devil cannot hold it over your head
[53:52] anymore. He can say, "You need to pay
[53:54] this. You need to pay this, and you're
[53:55] paying for this, and you're paying for
[53:56] this." It's already paid for. When Jesus
[53:59] died on Calvary, he paid it all.
[54:02] All to him I owe.
[54:11] not just paid it but put it in the sea
[54:13] of forgetfulness. God himself say I
[54:15] can't remember.
[54:17] Could you imagine? There are few things
[54:19] that listen God could do anything he
[54:21] wants to do but there are few things God
[54:22] cannot do. God cannot lie and when it go
[54:26] forgetfulness he cannot remember.
[54:32] You know what I said this morning? God
[54:33] cannot lie. And when it go for again
[54:36] forget, he cannot remember. He don't
[54:38] remember what he did last year. He don't
[54:39] remember what he did 20 years ago. Once
[54:42] it's under the blood, he can't even
[54:43] access it if he wants to. The devil
[54:46] there with a fishing rod trying to pull
[54:48] up 20 years ago. I don't care about it.
[54:50] It's behind me. It's under the blood and
[54:53] I'm underneath the blood where the devil
[54:56] could do me no harm.
[55:00] And brother Brandham said this. He said
[55:02] the devil cannot get to you because you
[55:04] are under the blood. For the devil to
[55:06] get to you, he has to come under the
[55:07] blood too. And he can never come under
[55:09] the blood and underneath the blood. The
[55:11] devil could do you no harm. No harm. No
[55:14] harm. No harm. We are the blood washed
[55:17] purchase of the blood of Jesus Christ.
[55:20] Recognize who you are. You are going to
[55:22] make it. You are going to overcome. You
[55:25] are going to receive the Holy Ghost. You
[55:27] shall be healed.
[55:50] There's an inheritance for you if you
[55:53] could suffer with him.
[55:59] Suffer the reproach.
[56:03] Suffer. What does that mean? Suffer the
[56:06] criticism.
[56:08] Suffer the reproach of baroness.
[56:13] Suffer the cross of having to dress like
[56:16] a Christian when nobody else in our
[56:17] family wants to.
[56:20] Suffer the reproach of standing alone on
[56:23] the faith and conviction that God is
[56:25] able.
[56:30] Why you don't cut your hair? Why you
[56:31] don't wear pants? Why you don't wear
[56:32] makeup?
[56:34] And the easy
[56:39] one.
[56:53] The Bible say present your bodies a
[56:55] living sacrifice. That is your
[56:57] reasonable service. That's first year
[56:59] second year.
[57:01] We reach primary school. We reach
[57:03] secondary school. We reach university
[57:05] level trials.
[57:07] Present your bodies a living sacrifice
[57:10] which is your reasonable service.
[57:11] Reasonable means it's not hard thing to
[57:13] do.
[57:15] I share with them. I see Muslims who put
[57:17] people to shame in this message. I see
[57:20] Pentecostal holiness Pentecostals who
[57:22] will beat left, right, and center
[57:26] and they never hear the message.
[57:30] I challenge the young people. I said,
[57:32] "How is it when somebody backslide the
[57:33] first thing is wear pants, wear makeup?"
[57:36] It was in their heart all along. It had
[57:37] Pentecost wear somebody preach back to
[57:40] me.
[57:46] Holiness people who will outdo you.
[57:51] They will say no worldly music. this and
[57:53] you have this glorious message and want
[57:55] to play games with it. Come on, shake
[57:57] yourself.
[58:00] That is easy suffering. That's not even
[58:02] the real suffering.
[58:05] Abraham had to declare I'm going to have
[58:07] a son and for 25 years suffer the
[58:10] criticism of what
[58:14] to prove, no evidence, nothing to show.
[58:17] He just talking
[58:22] Noah had to build and suffer the
[58:24] reproach. A building with no evidence.
[58:27] It wasn't like rainfall before. And you
[58:29] can say, "Well, remember the last time
[58:30] it happened?" No, it never fell before.
[58:33] I need to suffer the reproach. There's
[58:35] going to be a revival. Seven thunders
[58:38] give faith. Seven thunders will gather
[58:40] the bride together. This never happened
[58:41] before. Don't worry about it. God spoke
[58:43] to me. Seven will show how to go.
[58:45] Rapture and faith is laying in a
[58:47] message. add to your faith virtue and
[58:49] virtue knowledge and temperance,
[58:51] patience. Godlin is brotherly kind.
[58:53] There's a five-fold ministry. Yet,
[58:54] there's a season of adoption. There's a
[58:57] power that's coming into the church that
[58:58] now coming in. And when they speak the
[59:01] word, it will flash like lightning. And
[59:03] they will only say what God wants him to
[59:05] say. And Noah is building something
[59:07] because what he's building and what he's
[59:08] preaching is what will take him to his
[59:10] destination. This message we are
[59:12] preaching is what'll take us to our
[59:14] destination. Somebody give God a shout
[59:16] of praise.
[59:24] Hallelujah.
[59:26] Hallelujah.
[59:28] Hallelujah.
[59:36] Everybody feeling fine.
[59:45] of the seven churches
[59:51] where said the true church of Jesus
[59:54] Christ the bride is likened to pure
[59:57] gold.
[59:58] You see what he compares you to? Pure
[1:00:01] gold. Her righteousness
[1:00:04] is his righteousness.
[1:00:08] Her attributes are his own glorious
[1:00:12] attributes.
[1:00:13] Her identity is found in him.
[1:00:17] What he is, she is to reflect.
[1:00:21] Are you reflecting what he is? What he
[1:00:24] has, she is to manifest.
[1:00:28] From beginning to ending, she is the
[1:00:30] work of the Lord.
[1:00:33] And all his works are perfect.
[1:00:39] Everybody feeling fine? from beginning
[1:00:41] to end. She is the work of her Lord and
[1:00:44] all his works are perfect. In other
[1:00:46] words, God made you perfect. There's
[1:00:49] nothing to change about you. When God
[1:00:51] made you, he designed you a certain way.
[1:00:54] You are fearfully and wonderfully made.
[1:00:56] You have character to build, but you
[1:00:58] don't need what the world has to offer
[1:00:59] because God took his time when he made
[1:01:01] you. And when he made you, he throw away
[1:01:02] the mold. There's nobody else like you.
[1:01:04] You are the best version of what God
[1:01:07] wanted to see when he put you here. And
[1:01:08] when he put you here, he never put a
[1:01:10] substitute. He He never put nobody else
[1:01:12] like you. You are an individual in God
[1:01:14] with a specific part to play that the
[1:01:15] devil could never take your place.
[1:01:20] From beginning to ending, she is the
[1:01:22] work of the Lord and all his works are
[1:01:25] perfect. In fact, in her is summed up
[1:01:28] and manifested the eternal wisdom and
[1:01:31] purpose of God. How can one fathom it?
[1:01:34] How can one understand it? Though we
[1:01:37] cannot do that, cannot accept by faith
[1:01:39] that God had spoken it.
[1:01:42] Can we go on? But not only is a
[1:01:45] candlestick of gold, it is a beaten
[1:01:48] gold.
[1:01:52] Can you endure the beating?
[1:01:54] Can you endure the chastisement? Can you
[1:01:57] endure the trial? I know this kind of
[1:02:00] jump and shout of service, but it's not
[1:02:02] just gold. He said it's of beaten gold.
[1:02:06] handcrafted of beaten gold according to
[1:02:09] her blueprints which were spirit given.
[1:02:12] So God is not randomly doing the
[1:02:13] beating. He is beaten according to our
[1:02:16] blueprint.
[1:02:18] Your trial is is is designed for you
[1:02:21] according to our blueprint.
[1:02:25] Your test is designed for you because
[1:02:27] God is working with blueprints. You know
[1:02:29] when you're building a house, you have a
[1:02:31] blueprint. You know where the roof
[1:02:33] going. You know where the window going.
[1:02:34] God knows what he wants to see with you
[1:02:36] and according to the So God not randomly
[1:02:38] sending you through trials. Whatever you
[1:02:41] are going through is based on the
[1:02:42] blueprint.
[1:02:45] That alone is a reason to shout because
[1:02:47] the
[1:02:49] the Lord himself knows what he wants to
[1:02:51] see from you. And he is only doing what
[1:02:54] is necessary to bring you into a
[1:02:56] masterpiece.
[1:03:00] You don't hear me this morning.
[1:03:05] I hope you get that. You know, so
[1:03:08] everything you're going through is by
[1:03:09] design. You know, there's no accident
[1:03:11] with God. I I always said, it's either
[1:03:14] God in charge or God not in charge. And
[1:03:16] if God is in charge and he knows your
[1:03:18] full potential, he knows your capacity.
[1:03:21] He knows what you can handle. He knows
[1:03:23] what he wants you to do. And he's
[1:03:24] looking at you now and know you're not
[1:03:26] yet ready. He decided to hit you here.
[1:03:29] Beat you here. Hit you here. See this
[1:03:32] problem here? Throw you in a fiery
[1:03:34] furnace. Throw you in a lion's den. Turn
[1:03:37] your wife against you. Turn the children
[1:03:39] against you. He He stomped you. Is
[1:03:42] didn't he preach that in your adoption
[1:03:44] message?
[1:03:46] And he look at you again. He say still
[1:03:48] not ready. Let me hit him again.
[1:03:52] Because this has got to be gold. This
[1:03:54] goal has to be shaped a certain way. He
[1:03:56] look back at the blueprint. He say not
[1:03:58] ready yet.
[1:04:01] Too much temper. Hit it again. Too much
[1:04:04] temper. Hit it again. Little less
[1:04:06] temper. Almost there. Hit it again.
[1:04:10] A little more temper. She was going
[1:04:12] good, but she just answer back. Hit it
[1:04:14] again. I just see no answer back. It
[1:04:17] looked like it. I wonder if it stick.
[1:04:18] Let me just try it one more time and see
[1:04:20] if it answer back again. Okay, no
[1:04:21] answer. Lesson learned. That's the
[1:04:24] shape. I want that part in because it's
[1:04:26] got to look like this.
[1:04:29] And through your suffering, he's beating
[1:04:31] the things out of you.
[1:04:34] Buy of me gold tried in the fire.
[1:04:37] Nothing that is not him can make it over
[1:04:39] there. So he's beating this morning.
[1:04:44] The potter has his hands all up in the
[1:04:46] clay this morning. The refiner's fire is
[1:04:49] burning this morning.
[1:04:54] Anybody with me this morning? Too much
[1:04:57] pride. a blessing and he get too puffed
[1:04:58] up. God pull the blessing.
[1:05:03] Give it some time to dry out. He give
[1:05:05] you back the blessing again and you see
[1:05:06] still too much pride. Pull the blessing.
[1:05:09] Give it the blessing again. See you can
[1:05:11] handle it. Now you see God looking for
[1:05:13] somebody. The more he bless the more
[1:05:15] humble they become. So you got to beat
[1:05:17] the gold until it come into shape. You
[1:05:20] don't hear me this morning.
[1:05:23] God is going to get glory in the midst
[1:05:25] of your suffering. And at the end of
[1:05:27] your suffering, there'll be no more
[1:05:29] suffering. Because weeping may endure
[1:05:31] for a night, but joy comes in the
[1:05:32] morning. One day when you look at the
[1:05:34] word, you're going to be like him.
[1:05:35] There's no need to beat it if it's in
[1:05:37] shape. And if God is putting you in the
[1:05:39] fire is to bring you into shape.
[1:05:46] Anybody with me this morning?
[1:05:53] I'll get back to the quote, but I want
[1:05:55] to take it from Peter. Peter said here
[1:05:57] it is beloved in first Peter 4. Beloved
[1:06:01] think it not strange concerning a fiery
[1:06:04] trial
[1:06:06] which is to try you as though some
[1:06:09] strange thing happened unto you. So what
[1:06:13] we want to make sure you get brother
[1:06:14] Stephford is that this fiery child is
[1:06:16] not a strange thing. Fiery child should
[1:06:18] be a normal thing.
[1:06:23] years ago I thought was a strange thing
[1:06:27] going through a trial and it's like you
[1:06:30] make it so he didn't get one in five
[1:06:31] years
[1:06:34] but here is Peter saying it's a normal
[1:06:36] thing you have trials every day you're
[1:06:38] looking for the trial because the more
[1:06:40] you go through the process of the trials
[1:06:43] you'll get into shape faster
[1:06:46] you you you heard me when you face your
[1:06:49] fear and face the situation and
[1:06:52] Everything get cut off afterward.
[1:06:53] There's nothing else to cut off.
[1:06:57] Anybody with me this morning? When the
[1:06:59] lion cut off and the gossip couple and
[1:07:01] the backbiting and the jealousy and the
[1:07:03] animosity and the pride and there's no
[1:07:05] more pride left. What is there to cut?
[1:07:09] You remember the sister was in church
[1:07:10] and the prophet was preaching.
[1:07:12] Everything except
[1:07:21] when God finish with you, you're dead to
[1:07:24] yourself.
[1:07:26] But describe he said when you're in the
[1:07:28] casket, somebody can lie on you. You
[1:07:30] look at them and say that not true
[1:07:35] because you're dead.
[1:07:37] How many of us really dead to ourselves?
[1:07:41] you're ready to go into war. It wasn't
[1:07:44] so. It wasn't this. And Jesus in his
[1:07:46] suffering to Calvary uttered not a word.
[1:07:49] And he was accused without a cause.
[1:07:51] Hated without a cause. Just like Joseph,
[1:07:54] Joseph had every reason to be mad.
[1:07:58] It was some of us when boys come to get
[1:08:01] food in Egypt.
[1:08:03] Not just no food.
[1:08:06] Just bring some
[1:08:10] gloves here.
[1:08:15] But not Joseph. He was a type of Christ.
[1:08:18] The same brothers who sold him in this
[1:08:22] throw him in a ditch. Nowhere in you
[1:08:26] know some people have diary and they
[1:08:27] plan for life. Nowhere in his plan had
[1:08:29] ditch soul prison all of that accused.
[1:08:34] He get into prison with something he
[1:08:35] didn't even do.
[1:08:37] He said Lord why me? is trial.
[1:08:41] Meanwhile,
[1:08:44] because he had to suffer
[1:08:48] Jesus,
[1:08:49] we know who he is. And the Bible says he
[1:08:52] had to learn obedience.
[1:08:56] So obedience was not the product of his
[1:08:58] birth or his heritage or his destiny. He
[1:09:01] had to learn it
[1:09:03] by the things he suffered.
[1:09:05] We don't know what his suffering was.
[1:09:10] But we know he went through suffering to
[1:09:13] bring him into obedience that he could
[1:09:14] say Lord not my will.
[1:09:17] I have my will but not my will. Then
[1:09:24] so we're going to leave here looking at
[1:09:26] our trials differently
[1:09:29] because we are being transformed by the
[1:09:31] renewing of our minds.
[1:09:34] So when you go to work and you go to
[1:09:36] church and you have conflict and have
[1:09:37] situations, you're going to find the
[1:09:39] things that used to bother you before
[1:09:41] don't bother you anymore. You trust God
[1:09:43] more because there's no accident with
[1:09:45] God and nothing is out of place.
[1:09:51] We fight to defend our name, our car,
[1:09:53] our house, the business, the family, and
[1:09:56] all that God looking for is the
[1:09:57] character. That is the only currency
[1:09:59] that God values
[1:10:02] because if your character don't look
[1:10:04] like that,
[1:10:06] it's not getting transferred.
[1:10:09] The transfer stick
[1:10:14] wouldn't work.
[1:10:18] Can we go on? I'm still in this here.
[1:10:21] Not only is the candlestick of gold,
[1:10:25] but it is a beaten
[1:10:29] But I talk about taking churches through
[1:10:31] a process.
[1:10:33] So the church could get mature.
[1:10:37] And I'm realizing one of the challenges
[1:10:39] in this life is that people are not
[1:10:41] mature. People get older and maturity is
[1:10:45] not a function of age.
[1:10:48] There are some 70 year old immature
[1:10:50] people
[1:10:53] and there are some 20 year olds who are
[1:10:55] very mature.
[1:10:59] Because maturity means you can sort of
[1:11:00] control what you say.
[1:11:03] Maturity means you could separate your
[1:11:05] feelings and what needs to be said.
[1:11:09] They could say of the prophet, you
[1:11:11] couldn't tell his friends from his
[1:11:12] enemies because maturity means you
[1:11:14] conduct yourself a certain way. Even
[1:11:17] though your mind or your heart may tell
[1:11:19] you something different, your maturity
[1:11:21] kicks in and brings these things under
[1:11:24] subjection.
[1:11:26] Even the Bible people are bringing your
[1:11:28] body under subjection which comes with
[1:11:30] maturity. Somebody knew in the faith
[1:11:32] struggled with these things. But when I
[1:11:34] was a child, I spake as a child. But
[1:11:36] when I became a man, I put away childish
[1:11:39] things.
[1:11:45] The Bible said, "As many as I love, I
[1:11:48] rebuke and chasen."
[1:11:51] The other day I had a group call with my
[1:11:52] brothers and
[1:11:55] I just
[1:11:57] one thing that tell us say I love all
[1:12:00] your stupid
[1:12:05] what do what does he mean by that I love
[1:12:08] to the point that I will encourage all
[1:12:09] your foolishness
[1:12:14] because if love doesn't come with
[1:12:15] correction it's not real love and that's
[1:12:18] where some of the parents fail because
[1:12:20] you think by giving your child
[1:12:22] everything they want doesn't do that.
[1:12:26] Every son that come to God must be
[1:12:28] tried.
[1:12:32] I preached some years ago. You have to
[1:12:34] prepare your children for disappointment
[1:12:37] because life will have it
[1:12:39] disappointments if they never experience
[1:12:41] disappointment in your home. How will
[1:12:43] they deal with disappointment on the
[1:12:44] workplace or in life or in marriage?
[1:12:48] You create too perfect an environment
[1:12:50] for them in your home. They will never
[1:12:52] be prepared for the real world.
[1:12:57] and you set yourself up for failure
[1:12:59] because that's not the blueprint that
[1:13:01] God gave us. He said, "As many as I
[1:13:04] love, I rebuke and chasen because I want
[1:13:07] to see a behavior. I want to see an
[1:13:10] attitude. I want you to give thanks when
[1:13:12] things are good and when things are bad.
[1:13:15] In everything, give him thanks in the
[1:13:17] good times, in the bad times, in the You
[1:13:19] don't hear me this morning.
[1:13:24] Some of us, we need to be tougher. We
[1:13:26] need to be prepared for the reality.
[1:13:28] Paul said, "I've learned to be a peace.
[1:13:31] I've learned to live high. I've learned
[1:13:33] to go through all these things. I've
[1:13:34] been hungry. I've been wellfed. In all
[1:13:36] these things,
[1:13:40] to the strong, I became strong. To the
[1:13:42] weak, I became weak." You have to be
[1:13:44] flexible, malleable, unbreakable,
[1:13:48] maintaining your testimony.
[1:14:01] That's why preaches husband love your
[1:14:04] wives not as your father love your
[1:14:05] mother that's on the blueprint
[1:14:08] but as Christ loved the church
[1:14:11] that is the blueprint the Bible has the
[1:14:13] blueprint every business principle you
[1:14:16] could find you could find in scripture
[1:14:17] every marriage counseling book you could
[1:14:19] find in scripture every way to raise
[1:14:21] your children, you can find in
[1:14:22] scripture, it's in the word.
[1:14:26] And the role of the prophet was to shine
[1:14:28] light on the written word by the
[1:14:30] revealed word. So we can open this book
[1:14:32] that's closed to many and see all of it
[1:14:35] in plainness to prepare us to leave
[1:14:37] here.
[1:14:39] And the prophet thought, I didn't come
[1:14:40] to build a denomination. I didn't call
[1:14:42] to bring myself. I cannot point to
[1:14:44] Christ.
[1:14:46] Follow me as I follow Christ. But you
[1:14:48] need to be like Jesus. Don't be like the
[1:14:50] prophet. Be like Jesus. Because the
[1:14:52] prophet had his faults. Of course he
[1:14:55] did. Just like Elijah, just like Moses,
[1:14:57] just like David, just like the only
[1:14:58] perfect one was Christ.
[1:15:01] Oh, you don't hear me this morning?
[1:15:05] So, we got to teach him right and put
[1:15:07] line upon line, precept upon precept, so
[1:15:10] you could rightly not only divide the
[1:15:12] word, but give the answer to every man
[1:15:15] when he comes with his questions.
[1:15:16] Because that's what the Bible charges us
[1:15:18] to do. Be ready to give an answer. Why
[1:15:21] do you believe what you believe?
[1:15:26] Why do you trust God when things go
[1:15:28] wrong?
[1:15:36] God will have no spoil.
[1:15:43] And for many of you, the faster you
[1:15:46] accept who you are, Somebody going
[1:15:49] through being led in the wilderness and
[1:15:52] as you
[1:15:57] take a wilderness
[1:16:02] you eat some spicy hamburger at 3:00 in
[1:16:05] the morning and then Sunday morning the
[1:16:06] enemy fighting you that's not the enemy
[1:16:08] that's you're in
[1:16:11] say hey you're big and you have
[1:16:14] you supposed to know what you can eat at
[1:16:15] 3:00 in the
[1:16:22] You know when you eat that get trouble
[1:16:28] trial
[1:16:34] that is not the end of nothing. Even the
[1:16:36] devil is wonder. He can't blame for he
[1:16:38] didn't even do
[1:16:46] a soft answer turn.
[1:16:49] Do you have an argument at home and
[1:16:52] blackhating
[1:16:53] pong blackhat
[1:16:56] an argument and the enemy in your house
[1:16:58] the enemy soft answer shut down the
[1:17:00] whole thing.
[1:17:03] You know the enemy the enemy they say
[1:17:06] popcorn. Yes. Let me watch the fight.
[1:17:12] Last time the white win.
[1:17:17] Let me see who went in this time.
[1:17:20] Demons fall back. Fall back. They have
[1:17:23] this one on their own.
[1:17:28] We don't need to get involved.
[1:17:32] The devil. The accuser, the husband
[1:17:35] accusing the wife, accusing the husband
[1:17:37] and the children and the witnesses.
[1:17:46] If your neighbors cannot be invited to
[1:17:48] church,
[1:17:58] I talking to anybody here.
[1:18:03] If your coworkers cannot be invited to
[1:18:05] work
[1:18:07] by your life, I talking about you
[1:18:09] preaching to them because your life
[1:18:11] preach way more than I can preach in
[1:18:13] this pulpit.
[1:18:15] If the way you live can't convince
[1:18:17] somebody to ask, what is it about you
[1:18:19] that makes you operate like that?
[1:18:23] And you can say, well, I could explain
[1:18:25] some of it, but in summary, is it Lord?
[1:18:27] And if you want to know more about the
[1:18:28] Lord, come on. Come and just go to
[1:18:30] church with me and come and experience
[1:18:32] what we hear on a Sunday morning.
[1:18:43] We end up suffering things by our own
[1:18:45] design versus the suffering that is part
[1:18:48] of Christ suffering
[1:18:51] which is suffering without a cause.
[1:18:54] suffering for the sake of the gospel.
[1:18:57] Suffering because you have chosen the
[1:18:59] hard away
[1:19:02] and it's your choice and because of this
[1:19:04] a huge portion of heaven awaits thee.
[1:19:12] Anybody in the house this morning? Is
[1:19:14] this helping anybody? I'm not preaching
[1:19:16] this morning. just having a conversation
[1:19:21] still in that boat.
[1:19:23] But not only is the candlestick of gold,
[1:19:26] it is a beaten gold.
[1:19:29] Handcrafted.
[1:19:30] Handcrafted. This is not a automatic
[1:19:33] thing. This is not a a production line
[1:19:35] with other people involved. This is
[1:19:37] handcrafted by the master's hand. God
[1:19:40] has his hand on your life. And make no
[1:19:44] mistake about it. We are preaching about
[1:19:45] suffering, but God wants to bless you
[1:19:47] more than you could even handle. God has
[1:19:50] no problem with you being successful,
[1:19:52] being wealthy, being happy, being on top
[1:19:54] of the mountain. He has no issue with
[1:19:56] that. But he wants you to live that way
[1:19:57] with the character to handle it. That
[1:20:00] when you are there, you could still say
[1:20:02] it was the Lord's doing. And it is
[1:20:04] marvelous in our eyes.
[1:20:10] God is a jealous God. And the moment you
[1:20:13] say, my study and I work so hard and I
[1:20:17] work so hard. God say where am I in that
[1:20:19] picture because all the hard you work if
[1:20:22] your brain is working you have no heart
[1:20:23] to work you know come on young children
[1:20:25] come on young people I bright I bright
[1:20:28] what bright you bright is God give you
[1:20:29] wisdom is God give you intelligence
[1:20:32] there's a reason to thank God
[1:20:38] I talented I talented where you get the
[1:20:40] talent from
[1:20:44] is the Lord give the talent and the Lord
[1:20:47] Man's gift is what make a way for him.
[1:20:49] How you think you end the way where you
[1:20:50] end up is the Lord been guiding you. And
[1:20:52] God is saying up to now I get a proper
[1:20:54] note of praise.
[1:20:58] Well, you don't hear me this morning.
[1:20:59] You got to fix that. You know, you got
[1:21:00] to thank him in the morning. Thank him
[1:21:02] in the noon day. Thank him in the
[1:21:04] evening. Thank him when the sun comes
[1:21:06] up. Thank him in your trial. Thank him
[1:21:08] for the blessing. Thank him for the
[1:21:10] victory. Thank him for the bread on your
[1:21:12] table. It might be bread and bread, but
[1:21:14] thank him. It may be bread and butter,
[1:21:15] but thank him. It may be bread and jam,
[1:21:17] but thank him. I don't care what it is.
[1:21:21] Thank him.
[1:21:30] You may be seated. I was sharing
[1:21:42] years later.
[1:21:46] Everybody,
[1:22:00] but as a young child,
[1:22:02] I was so happy.
[1:22:10] I know apricot
[1:22:14] for you
[1:22:21] and who exchang
[1:22:35] at that context that meant the world to
[1:22:38] us.
[1:22:39] This came from foreign
[1:22:46] and I'm painting a picture that during
[1:22:48] your journey God as the father gave a
[1:22:51] little blessing but as I get older that
[1:22:54] jam you needed more than that jam to get
[1:22:56] my attention because I passed that stage
[1:22:59] and the same way God wants to bless you
[1:23:01] more. God don't just want to give you a
[1:23:02] jam. He want to give you a refrigerator
[1:23:04] with all kind of thing in it. He want to
[1:23:06] bless you with a seven course meal. You
[1:23:08] want to bless your family, bless your
[1:23:10] house,
[1:23:13] you want to put angels around your
[1:23:15] house, you could have blinking
[1:23:16] vigilance. There's nothing like the
[1:23:18] angel of the Lord. They're better than
[1:23:19] bling vigil. Oh, you don't hear me this
[1:23:21] morning.
[1:23:26] The Bible said is the Lord that make it
[1:23:28] rich and addeth no sorrow with it. You
[1:23:30] know much rich people have sorrow
[1:23:34] but when the Lord make you rich there's
[1:23:36] no sorrow in that riches but you don't
[1:23:39] hear me can I is anybody in the house
[1:23:41] this morning
[1:23:44] we look to man pro for pro promotion and
[1:23:47] the Bible say promotion don't come from
[1:23:49] east it don't come from west it come
[1:23:51] north it don't come from your boss it
[1:23:52] comes from the Lord when the Lord ready
[1:23:54] to promote you no man could get involved
[1:23:56] in that when God open a door for you who
[1:23:58] could close
[1:24:03] He said, "In blessing, I will bless
[1:24:05] thee.
[1:24:07] Every place you put your foot,
[1:24:09] you will possess the gates of the enemy.
[1:24:11] All that that is the Abrahamic promise
[1:24:14] that's upon you and your house." Can we
[1:24:15] give the Lord a hand of praise?
[1:24:21] Walk in the confidence of your calling,
[1:24:24] in the confidence of your choosing. Can
[1:24:26] the church say, "Amen.
[1:24:30] I'm still trying to finish this.
[1:24:34] But not only is the candlestick of gold,
[1:24:38] it is a beaten wall, handcrafted of
[1:24:41] beaten gold according to her blueprints
[1:24:45] which were spirit given
[1:24:49] outside of her Lord and Master Jesus
[1:24:51] Christ. Listen to this part of the words
[1:24:54] here. Was ever a people so beaten and
[1:24:57] purged as the bride of Jesus Christ? In
[1:25:00] other words, there's no other people
[1:25:01] will go through suffering like this
[1:25:03] people here because of what she's about
[1:25:05] to get into.
[1:25:10] Listen to the prophet. Surely she is
[1:25:13] filling up the sufferings that Christ
[1:25:15] has left behind. Her goods are
[1:25:18] despoiled. Her life is in jeopardy. She
[1:25:21] is accounted as sheep for the slaughter.
[1:25:24] She is killed all the day long. She
[1:25:27] suffers much in it all,
[1:25:30] but in it all retaliates not. Neither
[1:25:34] does she cause others to suffer.
[1:25:37] Worthy of the gospel is this lovely
[1:25:40] bride of Christ. And as gold is
[1:25:43] malleable, meaning you could shape it,
[1:25:45] you can move it, you could twist it. You
[1:25:46] know, there's some people that can't
[1:25:47] talk to
[1:25:52] Don't be like that.
[1:25:57] You tell them something they get
[1:25:58] offended.
[1:26:01] correction
[1:26:03] all they can take is compliment
[1:26:09] something wrong somewhere along the line
[1:26:11] where the went wrong
[1:26:13] and you have this sense of of I don't
[1:26:17] know what to call it the world where
[1:26:19] people create this mental thing around
[1:26:23] themselves you know I am who I am
[1:26:27] nothing and I have no
[1:26:30] being positive and being encouraging
[1:26:32] yourself and you have to be open for
[1:26:34] feedback
[1:26:37] how you will see because you can't see
[1:26:39] yourself unless you
[1:26:44] have something on your forehead
[1:26:47] who I am
[1:26:51] forhead
[1:26:57] who I am proud of myself Something on
[1:26:59] your forehead.
[1:27:16] Don't let yourself
[1:27:20] be who you are. Love yourself. You still
[1:27:23] have something on your body.
[1:27:28] You could now say, "Well, let me check
[1:27:30] it out and see if something
[1:27:41] happen."
[1:27:46] And I'm painting the picture so you can
[1:27:48] see what's going on in people's lives.
[1:27:51] Sometimes it's not what we say, it's how
[1:27:53] we say things.
[1:27:56] You have a good intention and the way
[1:27:59] you come out is like
[1:28:07] so again
[1:28:11] you have to because friends
[1:28:20] in
[1:28:28] Because if I just go on your face and
[1:28:31] you're wearing stress
[1:28:37] and musicians,
[1:28:48] we have to stand as soldiers. begin to
[1:28:50] address your body. There's a soul
[1:28:53] and we know one day that body will come
[1:28:55] under subjection to that seed in your
[1:28:57] soul that knows when that he could smile
[1:28:59] in the midst of your child. You could
[1:29:01] confuse the devil. We talk about the
[1:29:03] gold say God to bring a man to such a
[1:29:05] spot. The devil don't even know what to
[1:29:07] do with you. The devil, oh God, I don't
[1:29:08] know. I don't know what to do. I push
[1:29:10] him. He praise God. I throw him out the
[1:29:12] work. He praise God. I take away I gave
[1:29:14] him five flat tires. He's still praising
[1:29:16] God. What did I do again?
[1:29:23] All four
[1:29:26] and you still praise God.
[1:29:35] Thursday I left the airport.
[1:29:55] I can see
[1:30:03] where
[1:30:06] to me
[1:30:13] Take out the trunk. Put it in the back
[1:30:15] seat.
[1:30:33] That is life.
[1:30:35] When they get used to the fact that life
[1:30:37] has it ups and it
[1:30:41] You will never appreciate mountain
[1:30:42] unless you taste the value.
[1:30:47] If you only had mountain, it will get
[1:30:49] boring enough. But when you taste a
[1:30:51] value, then you see a mountain.
[1:30:57] When you have a meal not so good and
[1:30:59] then you have a good meal, you can make
[1:31:01] a comparison. Be nice.
[1:31:10] Brother
[1:31:30] experiences.
[1:31:37] in front of us now
[1:31:41] and we want to be prepared as Christians
[1:31:43] that we have no entitlement that will
[1:31:45] always go so smooth that when something
[1:31:48] change you
[1:31:51] know you're going to judge
[1:31:54] your wholeing
[1:32:09] Don't let nobody know. Wash your face
[1:32:12] right
[1:32:26] you all.
[1:32:29] Meanwhile, there are people in here who
[1:32:31] have all kind of problems.
[1:32:33] Make no mistake about it. All kind of
[1:32:35] situation, all kind of burdens. And they
[1:32:38] hear they lift their hands
[1:32:40] and they say, "Lord, I here to trust
[1:32:42] you."
[1:32:44] No wonder the song writers say, "Nobody
[1:32:46] knows the trouble I see."
[1:32:48] Some of us may not be as expressive, but
[1:32:51] some through the water, some through the
[1:32:53] flood, some too great, but all go
[1:32:55] through the blood
[1:32:58] to bring our character to a point that
[1:33:01] God could accept it. I trust it's
[1:33:03] helping somebody this morning. Walking
[1:33:06] through the fire. Can we give the Lord a
[1:33:09] hand of praise? Could you take some
[1:33:10] more?
[1:33:17] And as gold is malleable, meaning you
[1:33:19] could shape it whereas brass will break
[1:33:22] with the
[1:33:24] break
[1:33:27] because will
[1:33:29] and take the hit and they will still
[1:33:30] come to church
[1:33:32] and they
[1:33:44] rebuke and listen
[1:33:47] to reason to come back to normal because
[1:33:49] again people have so much ego and
[1:33:51] feeling in their feelings and God care
[1:33:53] about your feelings. He care about his
[1:33:56] word. He came about your character.
[1:33:58] behavior.
[1:34:04] Whereas brass will break with the
[1:34:06] beaten.
[1:34:08] This gold of God will bear a suffering
[1:34:10] for the Lord. Not bowed, not broken, not
[1:34:14] destroyed, but formed as a thing of
[1:34:16] beauty and a joy forever by the trials
[1:34:20] and testings of this life. Can we give
[1:34:22] the Lord a shout of praise?
[1:34:24] And that's from the Ephesian churches.
[1:34:28] I just have a few more and I'm done.
[1:34:30] Could you take some
[1:34:50] better come before it is too late
[1:34:53] and buy me gold tried in the fire.
[1:34:58] This is why I say walking in the fire.
[1:35:00] You are walking through your trials,
[1:35:02] walking through your situation, walking
[1:35:04] through the reproach, and you're not
[1:35:06] bound, you're not broken, you're not
[1:35:07] defeated, you're there. You're taking
[1:35:09] the punches as it comes because you're
[1:35:11] onward bound. You're looking to your
[1:35:12] destiny. You're looking to your maker.
[1:35:14] You're looking to your future. You're
[1:35:15] looking to redemption. You're looking
[1:35:16] up. You're praising God in the midst of
[1:35:19] your child.
[1:35:22] Like Job, though, the skin destroyed.
[1:35:27] He had a reason to complain. His wife
[1:35:30] bless
[1:35:38] and grace to not call her a foolish
[1:35:40] woman.
[1:35:42] He told the foolish woman he knew
[1:35:45] and he speaking like them.
[1:35:48] He speak like a foolish woman but he
[1:35:51] didn't call her a foolish woman.
[1:35:53] Can the church say amen?
[1:35:56] You better come before said the Lord and
[1:35:58] buy me gold tried in the fire and then
[1:36:01] you will be truly rich. Are we getting
[1:36:03] it? Listen to me. Naked physically we
[1:36:06] came into the world but naked
[1:36:07] spiritually we will not leave it. Oh no
[1:36:09] we're going to take something with us.
[1:36:12] What that something is is all we can
[1:36:14] take with us. Nothing less nothing more.
[1:36:17] So we have better be real careful now to
[1:36:19] see that we take something that will
[1:36:21] make us right before God.
[1:36:25] So then what will we take with us? We
[1:36:27] will take our character
[1:36:29] brother. That is what we will take with
[1:36:31] us. Now what kind of character will you
[1:36:34] take with you?
[1:36:36] Will it be like his whose character was
[1:36:39] molded by suffering in the fiery furnace
[1:36:42] of affliction or will it be the softness
[1:36:46] of this characterless lay of people?
[1:36:50] So here they're probably saying there's
[1:36:52] a softness that this age produces.
[1:36:58] They are not real men anymore.
[1:37:02] Everybody living life
[1:37:09] who could stand for truth, who could
[1:37:10] stand for righteousness, who could make.
[1:37:12] This is what
[1:37:14] it is.
[1:37:21] Could you take some more? I'm not going
[1:37:24] to be too much with you, but I hope in
[1:37:26] some way the message
[1:37:28] that you have what it takes to walk
[1:37:31] through it and situation will come and
[1:37:35] testing you. Many times we look at other
[1:37:38] people and the reality is friends, you
[1:37:39] can't change nobody. You can't change
[1:37:41] your neighbor, your children, the
[1:37:43] government. Through it all, you have to
[1:37:45] be working on yourself.
[1:37:48] That's all you can control. You can
[1:37:49] control your prayer life. You can
[1:37:51] control your attitude. You can control
[1:37:52] the response. You can control how you
[1:37:54] deal with situation, with temptation.
[1:37:55] You can control If you bad, if you do
[1:37:58] stupidness, that is your control
[1:38:06] from theian churches. Now the Lord God
[1:38:09] Almighty says, I know there he is
[1:38:11] walking in the midst of his people.
[1:38:12] There he is the chief shepherd of the
[1:38:16] But does he hold back the persecution?
[1:38:19] Does he stem the tribulation? No, he
[1:38:21] does not. He simply says, "I know your
[1:38:24] tribulation.
[1:38:27] I am not at all unmindful of your
[1:38:30] suffering. And there are many in the
[1:38:32] house who say you don't even know the
[1:38:33] trial I'm going through and all hell is
[1:38:35] against me or this is working out and
[1:38:37] the children and the money and the
[1:38:38] business and this and that. He said I
[1:38:40] know your tribulation. But saying God is
[1:38:44] not unmindful of your suffering. He
[1:38:46] knows exactly what your suffering looks
[1:38:49] like. Whether it is your health,
[1:38:51] whatever it is, he knows
[1:38:55] And I said, "What a stumbling block this
[1:38:58] is to so many people like Israel. They
[1:39:01] wonder if God really loves them."
[1:39:05] How can God be just and loving if he
[1:39:08] stands by and watches his people suffer?
[1:39:10] This is the prophet's words. He said,
[1:39:12] "This is what they ask in Malachi 1-3.
[1:39:16] The burden of the word of the Lord to
[1:39:18] Israel by Malachi. I have loved you,
[1:39:20] sayeth the Lord. Yet you say, wherein
[1:39:22] thou loved us? Was not Esau Jacob's
[1:39:25] brother? Said the Lord. Yet I love Jacob
[1:39:28] and hated Esau and laid his mountains
[1:39:30] and his waste for the dragons of the
[1:39:34] wilderness. You see, they could not
[1:39:36] figure out God's love. They thought that
[1:39:39] love meant no suffering.
[1:39:43] They thought that love meant a baby with
[1:39:45] parental care.
[1:39:48] But God said his love was elective love.
[1:39:52] The proof of his love is election. That
[1:39:55] no matter what happened, his love was
[1:39:57] proven truly by the fact that they were
[1:39:59] chosen under salvation. Oh, come on now.
[1:40:04] Because God had chosen you to salvation
[1:40:06] through sanctification of the spirit and
[1:40:08] belief of the truth. He may commit you
[1:40:10] to death as he did Paul. He may commit
[1:40:13] you to suffering as he did Job. That is
[1:40:15] his prerogative. He is sovereign.
[1:40:19] You are soldiers and he's the chief
[1:40:22] captain. He will determine the road you
[1:40:24] go through. It doesn't mean he doesn't
[1:40:25] love you. He could send you to the fiery
[1:40:28] furnace. He could send you to death. He
[1:40:30] could send you to.
[1:40:33] But his love is elective.
[1:40:36] He is sovereign.
[1:40:38] But it is all with a purpose. If he did
[1:40:42] not have a purpose, then he would be the
[1:40:43] author of frustration and not of peace.
[1:40:46] His purpose is that After we have
[1:40:48] suffered a while, we would be made
[1:40:50] perfect, be established, strengthened,
[1:40:53] and settled.
[1:40:55] Can church say amen? You love it this
[1:40:58] morning? Can we give the Lord a hand of
[1:41:00] praise? Are you willing to have the
[1:41:02] right attitude in the midst of your
[1:41:04] suffering, in the midst of your trial,
[1:41:06] say the right thing, do the right thing?
[1:41:14] Does anybody remember?
[1:41:20] She was complaining about how she was
[1:41:22] frustrated with the
[1:41:31] child.
[1:41:33] Everybody,
[1:41:38] how you act, how you move
[1:41:42] Yes, things are tough, but what is your
[1:41:44] reason for not? What is your reason for
[1:41:46] not being in church? What is your reason
[1:41:48] for because of one trial, one problem,
[1:41:51] one situation? What kind of soldier are
[1:41:54] you? Because the Bible says in this is
[1:42:00] in the same Isaiah 43 or sorry, second
[1:42:03] Timothy 2, thou therefore endure
[1:42:05] hardness
[1:42:07] as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.
[1:42:15] I'm almost done. His purp
[1:42:21] and settled. Don't you want to be
[1:42:22] settled?
[1:42:24] Perfect standing, perfect state. Nothing
[1:42:27] can move you. The Bible said to him that
[1:42:28] overcome when I make a pillar in the
[1:42:30] temple of my God, he shall not go any
[1:42:32] more out. Meaning you are firmly rooted.
[1:42:34] You're backsliding that even an option
[1:42:36] for you anymore because you are
[1:42:37] grounded. You have been settled. No
[1:42:40] temptation could come. Your appetite has
[1:42:42] been changed. The world has no
[1:42:43] attraction to you anymore. Anybody with
[1:42:45] me this morning?
[1:42:48] But goes on, he learned obedience by the
[1:42:51] things he suffered. He was actually made
[1:42:54] perfect by the things that he suffered.
[1:42:56] Hebrews 5:89. Though he were a son, yet
[1:42:59] he learned obedience by the things which
[1:43:01] he suffered. And being made perfect, but
[1:43:03] I'm just putting it there in context. He
[1:43:05] became the author of eternal salvation
[1:43:08] unto all them that obey him. In plain
[1:43:10] language, the prophet says the very
[1:43:13] character of Jesus was perfected by
[1:43:16] suffering.
[1:43:18] Now, when you catch this, you start to
[1:43:20] look at this went wrong, this went
[1:43:22] wrong, this went wrong, why I can't
[1:43:24] catch a break, why I can't see my way,
[1:43:25] why this didn't work out, and to see God
[1:43:27] is trying to perfect you the same way in
[1:43:30] Christ through suffering. my marriage,
[1:43:32] my bills, my problems, my this. And God
[1:43:34] is saying, "Come on, keep going."
[1:43:36] Because you're going through it. God
[1:43:37] could pull you out if he wants to. But
[1:43:39] there's no perfection if he pulls you
[1:43:41] out. You've got to go through it.
[1:43:44] Walking through your fire.
[1:43:48] You will not be burnt. You will
[1:43:50] overcome. Just keep on walking. Keep on
[1:43:52] believing. Keep on pressing. Keep on
[1:43:54] coming. Keep on fighting. Keep on
[1:43:56] worshiping. Keep on praying. Keep on
[1:43:59] believing. Keep on trusting. is going to
[1:44:01] work out. All things work together for
[1:44:03] good to them that love God, to them who
[1:44:05] are called according to his purpose.
[1:44:13] I hope this makes some sense to you this
[1:44:15] morning with some of the things that you
[1:44:17] have gone through in life and you're
[1:44:18] trying to figure out how does it all
[1:44:19] connect together.
[1:44:21] And according to Paul, he has left I'm
[1:44:24] still reading from the prophet, he has
[1:44:26] left his church a measure of suffering.
[1:44:30] I Catch this. So Christ was made perfect
[1:44:33] through his suffering and he left a
[1:44:35] measure of suffering. He said this
[1:44:38] portion of suffering is not for me. I'm
[1:44:40] leaving this portion for the bride.
[1:44:45] He has left his church a measure of
[1:44:48] suffering that they too by their faith
[1:44:50] in God while suffering for him would
[1:44:54] come to a place of perfection. Don't we
[1:44:57] preach about a ministry of perfection,
[1:44:59] commitment to perfection, the process of
[1:45:01] perfection, the process of place of
[1:45:03] trying and character development and
[1:45:06] here it is the prophet is placing it
[1:45:08] that is a measure of suffering that is
[1:45:10] required to see perfection that they
[1:45:13] without us cannot be made perfect. They
[1:45:15] are waiting for you to lift your head up
[1:45:18] through your trial, through your
[1:45:20] testing, through your problem and say
[1:45:22] Lord I will trust you. Though he slay
[1:45:24] me, yet still I trust him. Though all
[1:45:26] falls around, falls apart around me, I'm
[1:45:29] going to trust you, Lord, that you're
[1:45:30] going to see me through. Give the Lord a
[1:45:32] hand of praise.
[1:45:42] I'm almost finished. And I'm to a bit of
[1:45:45] a teaching. I hope it's an encouragement
[1:45:46] to you that you leave here saying, "I'm
[1:45:48] in a trial, but that's all right. I'm in
[1:45:51] a test, but that's all right.
[1:45:53] The enemy is fighting, but that's all
[1:45:55] right. The Lord is with me. I'm all
[1:45:58] right.
[1:46:00] Like that woman, she had that dead baby.
[1:46:03] She's looking for the prophet. And she's
[1:46:05] going, they say, "What's happening? All
[1:46:07] is well." And she's riding to the
[1:46:10] prophets. All is well. She wasn't lying
[1:46:13] because she know where faith coming.
[1:46:15] She's going to the man of God.
[1:46:18] And according to Paul, he has left his
[1:46:21] church a measure of suffering
[1:46:24] that they too by their feet in God while
[1:46:27] suffering with him would come to a place
[1:46:29] of affection. Why did he want this?
[1:46:31] James 1:24, "My brethren, count it all
[1:46:34] joy when you fall into diverse
[1:46:36] temptations, knowing this, that the
[1:46:39] trying of your faith workketh patience.
[1:46:42] But let patience have a perfect work,
[1:46:45] that ye may be perfect and entire.
[1:46:48] wanting nothing. So your completeness,
[1:46:51] your completion is tied to how you
[1:46:54] handle your suffering.
[1:46:59] Why does he stand by? The reason is in
[1:47:02] Romans 8:17 to 18. We read the scripture
[1:47:05] and children and
[1:47:07] ears of God and join with Christ if so
[1:47:10] be that we suffer with him that we may
[1:47:13] be also glorified together. For I reckon
[1:47:16] that the sufferings of this time are not
[1:47:18] worthy to be compared with the glory
[1:47:20] which shall be revealed in us. Unless we
[1:47:23] suffer with him, we cannot reign with
[1:47:25] him.
[1:47:27] You have to suffer to reign. The reason
[1:47:30] for this is that character simply is
[1:47:33] never made without suffering.
[1:47:36] And so it is in the spiritual is so it
[1:47:39] is in the natural. Anybody who has
[1:47:40] succeeded in anything will tell you
[1:47:42] about the failures and the sufferings
[1:47:44] and the problems that led to their
[1:47:46] success.
[1:47:48] The right brothers fail fail fail and
[1:47:50] then they get the plane to work.
[1:47:54] There's no story of overcoming anything
[1:47:56] without ultimate overcome.
[1:47:58] You have to suffer to reign. The reason
[1:48:00] for this is that character simply is
[1:48:02] never made without suffering. Character
[1:48:04] is a victory, not a gift. A man without
[1:48:07] character can't re because power apart
[1:48:10] from character is satanic. But power
[1:48:14] with character is fit to rule. And since
[1:48:17] he wants us to share even his throne on
[1:48:21] the same basis that he overcame and is
[1:48:23] set in his father's throne, then we have
[1:48:26] to overcome to sit with him. And the
[1:48:28] little temporary suffering I'm reading
[1:48:30] from the prophet that we go through now
[1:48:33] is not worthy to be compared to the
[1:48:35] tremendous glory that will be revealed
[1:48:38] in us when he comes. Can the church say
[1:48:40] amen? Oh, what treasures are laid up for
[1:48:43] those who are willing to enter into his
[1:48:45] kingdom through much tribulation. Think
[1:48:48] it not strange concern the fiery trial
[1:48:50] that are to try you. That is what Peter
[1:48:52] said. Is it strange that God wants us to
[1:48:54] develop a Christlike character that
[1:48:57] comes through suffering? No sir. And we
[1:49:00] all have trials. We are all tried and
[1:49:02] chasing as sons. Not one but goes
[1:49:05] through that. The church that is not
[1:49:07] suffering and is not being tried hasn't
[1:49:10] got it. It isn't of God.
[1:49:14] Can I read that again?
[1:49:16] The church that is not suffering and is
[1:49:19] not being tried hasn't got it. isn't of
[1:49:22] God. Hebrews 12:68, for whom the Lord
[1:49:26] loveth, he chastenth and scourgeth every
[1:49:28] son whom he receiveth. But if ye be
[1:49:31] without chastisement whereof all are
[1:49:34] partakers, then ye are bastards and not
[1:49:36] sons. In other words, and we say it, if
[1:49:39] you not going through a trial, something
[1:49:40] wrong here is very direct. You're a
[1:49:42] bastard. Because if you're a son,
[1:49:45] there's a process of sunship to assess
[1:49:47] power. And that accessing of power is
[1:49:49] through suffering and true tribulation
[1:49:51] and true trial and true persecution.
[1:49:57] Could we take some more soon and finish
[1:49:58] reading this? We're done.
[1:50:02] Now this special condition in Smyrna
[1:50:05] must be applied to every age. There's no
[1:50:08] age free from it. There is no true
[1:50:10] believer freed from it. This is of God.
[1:50:13] This is the will of God. It is needful.
[1:50:17] We need the Lord to teach us the truth
[1:50:19] that we are to suffer and be Christlike
[1:50:23] in doing it.
[1:50:26] Are you Christlike in your sickness? Are
[1:50:28] you Christlike in your oppression? Are
[1:50:31] you Christlike when things go wrong?
[1:50:36] So, it's not just suffering and you're
[1:50:38] suffering. It's suffering like Christ.
[1:50:42] It's Christlike suffering.
[1:50:45] Even when things are wrong, still a
[1:50:47] Christian. When things are right, you're
[1:50:49] a Christian. When things are wrong,
[1:50:50] you're still a Christian. Suffer like
[1:50:52] Christ.
[1:50:59] Love suffer long.
[1:51:02] Matthew 5 11-2. Blessed are ye when men
[1:51:06] shall revile you and persecute you.
[1:51:09] That's you young people. When men revile
[1:51:11] you and they laugh at you and ask you
[1:51:13] why you looking like a church girl and
[1:51:16] why in alignment with us and why you go
[1:51:18] to parties and why you have free of
[1:51:20] yourself and
[1:51:22] blessed are ye when men shall revile you
[1:51:25] and persecute you and shall say all
[1:51:28] manner of evil against you fall any
[1:51:31] young person who backslide this is where
[1:51:32] they fail at you know because this is
[1:51:35] the issue peer pressure is this
[1:51:39] all peer is in the scripture here.
[1:51:43] But there's a blessing you when men
[1:51:46] shall revile you, persecute you, say
[1:51:49] manner of evil against you for my sake.
[1:51:51] He said, rejoice and be exceedingly glad
[1:51:55] for great is your reward in heaven. For
[1:51:57] so persecuted they the prophets which
[1:52:00] were before you. It's a good thing when
[1:52:02] they come against you because you belong
[1:52:04] to God. There's a blessing in there. Be
[1:52:07] confident in your blessing. Be confident
[1:52:09] in your reward. Can the church say amen?
[1:52:13] Just a few more.
[1:52:15] This is reading these quotes and know
[1:52:18] these quotes.
[1:52:21] The cloudy skies preaching this and
[1:52:25] storms of life are no signs of God's
[1:52:27] disapproval.
[1:52:29] Neither are bright skies and still
[1:52:32] waters signs of his love and approval.
[1:52:34] His approval of any of us is only in the
[1:52:37] beloved. His love is elective which he
[1:52:40] had for us before the foundation of the
[1:52:42] world. Does he love us? Yes. How shall
[1:52:45] we know? We shall know because he said
[1:52:47] so.
[1:52:49] That's how you know. So the trial is not
[1:52:51] the proof or the blessing is not the
[1:52:53] proof. He loves you because he said so.
[1:52:55] And we say amen to him saying so. And we
[1:52:59] take the blessing. We take the
[1:53:00] suffering. We take the beating because
[1:53:03] at the end of it, he will only see
[1:53:04] himself in us. Can we give the Lord a
[1:53:06] shout of praise?
[1:53:12] We shall know because he said so and
[1:53:15] manifested that he did love us for he
[1:53:17] brought us to himself and gave us of his
[1:53:20] spirit placing us as sons. And how shall
[1:53:22] I prove my love to him? This is our
[1:53:25] part. How shall I prove my love to him?
[1:53:27] Young brother, young sister, elder,
[1:53:29] deacon, minister, usher, trustee.
[1:53:34] How shall I prove my love to him? By
[1:53:37] believing what he said and by conducting
[1:53:40] myself with joy amidst the trials that
[1:53:44] he in his wisdom allowed to come to
[1:53:46] pass.
[1:53:49] You want to prove you love God? Put a
[1:53:52] smile on your face in the midst of your
[1:53:54] trial.
[1:53:55] How shall I prove my love to him? By
[1:53:58] believing what he said and by conducting
[1:54:00] myself with joy amidst the trials that
[1:54:03] he in his wisdom allowed to come to
[1:54:06] pass. There's no trial that has come to
[1:54:08] you that is not the wisdom of the Lord
[1:54:10] being made manifest.
[1:54:13] I don't care if the trial is in your
[1:54:14] job, in your house, in your
[1:54:16] neighborhood. I don't care what it is.
[1:54:17] It's his wisdom to prove something. And
[1:54:20] your part to play is to have joy in the
[1:54:22] midst of your trial. Your part to play
[1:54:25] is to put a smile on your face. Your
[1:54:27] part to play is to rejoice with gladness
[1:54:30] exceeding gladness.
[1:54:36] Glory.
[1:54:38] Glory. I'm finished. Can we give the
[1:54:42] Lord a shout of praise? You love the
[1:54:44] Lord this morning,
[1:54:47] you can get ready to come up.
[1:54:49] So, church, you're going to walk into
[1:54:53] the fire.
[1:54:54] and you shall not be hurt. You're going
[1:54:57] to walk through your fire of all your
[1:54:59] testing and your child. And I just want
[1:55:00] to read one last thing here in the book
[1:55:02] of Daniel
[1:55:05] because you're going to walk through the
[1:55:06] fire and not be burnt.
[1:55:11] I preached this
[1:55:13] some time ago. I believe
[1:55:16] this is with the Hebrew words.
[1:55:19] This is Daniel
[1:55:22] 16. Shadra, and Abednego answered and
[1:55:24] said to the king, "Oh nephew,
[1:55:26] we are not careful.
[1:55:30] We are not careful to answer thee in
[1:55:32] this matter in this matter." In other
[1:55:34] words, they not holding punches. They
[1:55:36] say we not holding back. We have a
[1:55:38] conviction here and we not
[1:55:41] we saying it big. We saying it how we
[1:55:44] feel it in. We have no careful way to
[1:55:46] say this.
[1:55:48] If it be so, our God whom we serve is
[1:55:51] able to deliver us from the burning
[1:55:54] fiery furnace, and he will deliver us
[1:55:56] out of thine hand. But if not, be it
[1:55:59] known unto thee, O king, that we will
[1:56:01] not serve thy gods, nor worship the
[1:56:04] golden image, which thou hast set up.
[1:56:06] Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury,
[1:56:09] and the form of his vis, his face was
[1:56:12] changed against Shad, Meshach, and
[1:56:14] Abedneo. Therefore he spake and
[1:56:16] commanded that they should the furnace
[1:56:19] one seven times more than it was one to
[1:56:21] be heated. So with a pop, they already
[1:56:24] know fiery furnace is the destination.
[1:56:26] And here it was because they saw our
[1:56:28] believers. The enemy said, "We're going
[1:56:29] to it seven times hotter."
[1:56:32] And he commanded, listen to
[1:56:34] Nebuchadnezzar, he commanded the most
[1:56:35] mighty men that were in his army. He get
[1:56:38] his navy seals, his best men that were
