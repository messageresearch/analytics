[11:59] your love. We thank you for the power
[12:01] that we feel among us this morning. May
[12:04] you come down and fill every hungry
[12:05] heart, every thirsting soul. Change and
[12:08] transform us, Lord. Oh, we wait upon you
[12:10] and needy people in this last day, the
[12:13] final generation for your coming. Lord,
[12:16] set us right this morning in Jesus name.
[12:18] we ask it. Amen. And amen and amen. You
[12:22] may be seated.
[12:24] God bless you. Amen. And welcome to the
[12:27] Headstone Tabernacle. We're so glad to
[12:29] have you among us here this morning.
[12:32] This morning, we want to welcome Sister
[12:34] Kate
[12:36] uh
[12:38] Ingbu. I trust I get it right. And her
[12:41] two sons, Success and Francis. Could you
[12:43] all stand? Welcome to Headstone
[12:44] Tabernacle.
[12:46] Dr. Okay, God bless you. Welcome my two
[12:49] children. Amen. Oh, it's so good to be
[12:52] here this morning. And I just want to
[12:54] read a scripture. I'm not the preacher
[12:56] this morning, but Isaac over going to be
[12:57] preaching you this morning. Praise the
[12:59] name of the Lord. So, I'm going to say a
[13:00] few words. And uh from Acts 18, it says,
[13:03] "And he shall receive power." Power,
[13:07] not depression, not frustration, not
[13:10] weakness, not struggling, and you're
[13:12] fighting power. After that, the Holy
[13:14] Ghost,
[13:15] not Luther, not Wesley, not Pentecost,
[13:18] but the Holy Ghost
[13:19] is come upon you. We talking about
[13:21] dynamics or your mechanics. Power in
[13:23] your hands, power in your tongue, power
[13:24] to live, power to overcome, power to
[13:27] forgive, power to make things right,
[13:28] power to humble yourself, power to say,
[13:30] "I'm sorry." Power to say, "Please
[13:32] forgive me." We talking about real
[13:33] power. Power to pray for the sick. Power
[13:35] to lay hands upon the sick. Power to
[13:37] cast out devils. Come. Power to raise
[13:39] the dead.
[13:39] Hallelujah. your power and let the devil
[13:41] know that you are his son.
[13:43] You are God's son and the devil has to
[13:45] go when you speak to him. That's what we
[13:47] talking about power. Real power. Not not
[13:49] just mental thing. Not just verbal
[13:51] thing. Real power. Sometime you don't
[13:53] have to talk. The devil going to see you
[13:54] when you walk. Praise God. We talk about
[13:56] power. Power that the devils feel. Power
[13:58] emanating from the inside out. Not the
[14:01] outside and inside out. Internal power.
[14:04] Godly power. Holy power. Holy Ghost
[14:07] power. Real power. Oh, glory to God. He
[14:10] promises power. Oh, glory to God. That's
[14:13] a promise. Power to have your own
[14:15] revival. You don't have to come to
[14:16] church for revival. You bringing your
[14:18] revival to church. We we talking about
[14:21] real power.
[14:24] Hallelujah.
[14:24] Oh, you may be seated.
[14:27] That's why we have no room to sit back,
[14:29] relax. You have no place to sit back
[14:32] like you got it made. There is always
[14:34] something to reach out after, something
[14:36] to thirst after, something to press
[14:38] after. That's why Paul said, "I forget
[14:40] the thing that I passed and I pressed
[14:42] towards the mark of the high calling in
[14:44] Christ Jesus." There is always a goal.
[14:47] There is always something to achieve.
[14:49] There is something to press onto. You
[14:51] can't sit and stare. You got to press
[14:53] your way into the kingdom of God because
[14:56] the kingdom of God is preached
[14:59] and every man press their way into it.
[15:04] Hallelujah.
[15:06] Oh, glory.
[15:07] Hallelujah.
[15:08] So, on Tuesday, I'll be going to Uganda
[15:11] and uh pray for me. I've been having
[15:14] quite a time healthwise, but God is
[15:16] good. And next month when I get back,
[15:18] I'll be going to France. So, the circle
[15:20] already turning for different places and
[15:24] we just want to be in the will of God.
[15:26] But one thing we know though, but
[15:28] Abraham says once you're on the fields,
[15:30] you are in the will of God.
[15:33] Once you're on the fields, you're in the
[15:35] will of God. You have a right to testify
[15:37] about the glory and the praise and the
[15:39] honor.
[15:40] If you're not testifying, something is
[15:42] wrong.
[15:42] Yeah. You're supposed to be inviting
[15:44] people out, tell him about the Lord, how
[15:45] God has what done for your life.
[15:48] Amen. So, I just want to read two quotes
[15:49] before the preacher comes. And this one
[15:52] we read before, brother Brandham said in
[15:54] expectation, we need back to the Bible,
[15:57] to the oldfashioned Holy Spirit, good
[15:59] old time St. Paul revival and the Bible
[16:02] Holy Ghost. I like that. Not just not
[16:04] Bible Holy Ghost.
[16:06] I like that terminology is what we need
[16:08] back in the church again. It's right.
[16:10] And friend, it will only come through
[16:12] the experience of the new birth.
[16:13] Amen.
[16:13] A man cannot go to the kingdom of God
[16:16] without being born again.
[16:18] No more. Here we go. Than a bird could
[16:20] fly without wings.
[16:24] You need wings to fly.
[16:26] Not you want wings to fly. You need
[16:28] wings to fly.
[16:30] Amen.
[16:30] No wings, you're not flying.
[16:32] You're grounded. Isn't that right?
[16:34] So watch. And he couldn't do it. No
[16:36] matter how much a bird is, he hasn't got
[16:37] wings. He can't fly. And neither can a
[16:39] man go to heaven without being born
[16:41] again. We don't. It's not intellectual.
[16:43] Isn't that right? Praise God. So
[16:46] brother, sister, are you catching it?
[16:49] Watch that God will open the seals in
[16:51] the last days. All seven seals will be
[16:53] broke. Those seals, seven seals will be
[16:55] broke. And the full thing these are from
[16:57] the unveiling of God would come into
[16:59] view of the people. What took place all
[17:01] along the hour of the seven angels
[17:03] message. All the mysteries of God should
[17:06] be made known in that Elijah this last
[17:08] hour. Here we go. How that Christ is put
[17:11] out his church.
[17:13] That's a hard thing to really
[17:15] comprehend. You know Christ
[17:17] put out
[17:19] his church.
[17:20] They're singing about him. They have
[17:22] specials about him. They're preaching
[17:24] about him.
[17:26] They're telling each other, "God bless
[17:27] about him, but he is put out.
[17:30] Christ put out of the church."
[17:32] Hallelujah.
[17:33] Oh, glory to God. One day you're going
[17:34] to wake up and realize Christ is not in
[17:36] the church. Where is he in the bride?
[17:39] [Music]
[17:40] Church is one thing and bride is another
[17:42] thing. Oh, hallelujah. Watch. And Christ
[17:45] is put out of his church, the son of
[17:46] God. How he is revealed to us the son of
[17:48] man again. How the church is to be put
[17:51] in order.
[17:52] Amen. Amen.
[17:54] So the church is not a a willy wheelie
[17:56] and everything go and anything go. No,
[17:58] no, no,
[17:58] no, no, no. It has to come to a spot
[18:01] where the church is put in order.
[18:04] Could I hear a amen on that?
[18:06] How many wants that?
[18:08] That's right.
[18:10] That's right. Not anything goes. Church
[18:12] put in order. Watch. And everything for
[18:14] the last days. Here we go. No creed.
[18:18] No denomination.
[18:19] Just absolutely the word living in the
[18:23] individual.
[18:25] I'll take one. I'll leave one. I'll take
[18:28] this. I'll leave that one. No strings,
[18:30] no denominations, no binding or nothing.
[18:33] It's just a heart with God and him
[18:35] alone.
[18:36] What a hour to come back to.
[18:39] No church can claim anything. Is
[18:41] individuals
[18:42] word living in individuals. Then you
[18:45] become a living tabernacle of the living
[18:48] God's dwelling place. You become God's
[18:50] house. Where you go, God is going.
[18:53] Hallelujah. Where you are, God is there.
[18:56] Oh, could we give the Lord a shout of
[18:58] praise?
[18:59] Hallelujah. The word living not in the
[19:02] church, in you,
[19:04] the individual. Isn't that wonderful?
[19:07] So, as we want to switch over, but I
[19:09] want to thank God for the prayer
[19:10] meetings. We have prayer meeting on
[19:11] Thursday 8:00. It's so powerful. I know
[19:14] the people come and the turnout years
[19:16] ago prayer meeting was one of the
[19:17] hardest service you could know the
[19:19] church by who come out to pray but I'm
[19:21] so excited what I'm seeing and the
[19:23] turnout is tremendous and the atmosphere
[19:25] is tremendous one hour powerful cry out
[19:28] to God and really shaking the shingles
[19:31] as it was to seek the face of the Lord
[19:33] and and I thank God we brought back the
[19:36] altar back into the church.
[19:38] Hallelujah. And have some prayer meeting
[19:39] going strong every Thursday night have
[19:41] it going strong. Amen. 10 15 minutes
[19:44] exhortation word 10 minutes and get down
[19:46] into prayer and that's why we come here
[19:47] I'll be coming on tonight to pray isn't
[19:49] that right
[19:50] so I want to let you know well I'll be
[19:51] talking to you later after the service
[19:53] but the church is going to be set in
[19:55] order things are going to be set in
[19:57] order so yesterday we had a marital uh
[20:00] marriage uh seminar and it was really
[20:02] something was special and I trust that
[20:04] those who were here were blessed
[20:09] because we went back to the Bible with
[20:11] his back to Ephesians And then back to
[20:13] Ephesians where husband love their wives
[20:15] and where wives respect their husbands.
[20:17] That is going back to the word. And with
[20:19] that everything solved,
[20:21] every problem solved, the issue is
[20:23] solved.
[20:24] Isn't that right?
[20:25] Hallelujah. So I trust the Lord that God
[20:27] will bless you this morning in a special
[20:29] way and you'll be inspired to really
[20:31] serve the Lord because that's what you
[20:33] come for. People love God.
[20:34] They ain't come to love the preacher.
[20:36] They come to love God.
[20:37] That's right. We are not to put
[20:38] ourselves into your hearts. We supposed
[20:40] to put the word into your hearts. That's
[20:42] what we supposed to do. So you're not
[20:43] coming here fighting for the church and
[20:45] fighting for the preacher and what not.
[20:46] Forget about it. It's a kingdom we
[20:48] talking about.
[20:49] Jesus Jesus told the disciples, he say,
[20:51] "My kingdom is not of this world."
[20:54] Hallelujah. Because they wanted him. He
[20:56] was popular. He was getting the crowd
[20:58] 3,000 5,000. He was getting heavy
[21:00] physical backing and crowd support. And
[21:03] they thought that he could lead a
[21:04] rebellion against those dread Romans
[21:07] that had them under pressure.
[21:09] So they're looking for a warrior. of
[21:11] their faith.
[21:13] They had their expectation that this
[21:15] Messiah that was able to whip up popular
[21:18] support and had the crowd support of
[21:20] 3,000 and 5,000. Let's jam the Romans.
[21:23] Let's take upstairs and fight them. Only
[21:25] to hear him say, "My kingdom is not of
[21:27] this world. If my kingdom was of this
[21:29] world, my men would fight for me. But I
[21:32] speak of another kingdom." Oh, glory.
[21:35] Oh,
[21:37] hallelujah. Listen, we don't belong
[21:40] here. Everybody else have first place.
[21:42] We belong to a different kingdom. Ah,
[21:46] you thought you had first place. No,
[21:49] they have first place. Our kingdom is
[21:51] coming.
[21:52] But I want to give you a word this
[21:53] morning. Behold, the kingdom is within
[21:56] you.
[21:57] Oh, give the Lord a shout of praise.
[22:00] Hallelujah. And the kingdom is the word
[22:02] made spirit and power in your life.
[22:09] I'll close with this.
[22:10] Hallelujah.
[22:11] When you get behind your heart to close
[22:12] your
[22:13] thoughts be going back and forth and
[22:15] back and forth.
[22:16] Don't let it get too late that you
[22:21] stay long to understand a man life
[22:24] doesn't consist about the things he
[22:26] possess.
[22:28] Some people take too long to get to that
[22:30] spot
[22:31] where for them is about things. is about
[22:34] a car, a house, land, a thing like that.
[22:38] And we talking in the in the seminar
[22:41] yesterday, a woman needs love, romance
[22:43] and so on like that. We talking about
[22:44] that and he's saying, you know, not car
[22:46] it car and and house and curtain and
[22:49] everything else, but where is the
[22:50] relationship? Where is the connection?
[22:53] We talk about hindrances, meddling laws
[22:56] and mother-in-laws and other outlaws.
[22:59] There's a word inventing law. In-law is
[23:02] meddling in marriages and affecting
[23:04] relationship and so on. Not giving it to
[23:06] blend and bond and so on like that.
[23:08] Grudges and whatnot. And it's very
[23:10] important to understand these things.
[23:12] Amen.
[23:12] Oh hallelujah. Because the Bible even
[23:15] teaches if the relationship is not
[23:16] right, it affect the man's prayer.
[23:19] So you're praying and it's not effective
[23:21] because the relationship and connection
[23:23] is not there. So God actually put limits
[23:27] to your so-called manpower.
[23:32] Brother's not saying amen.
[23:34] They get in a little fight. Not a big
[23:36] one, a little fight. But the point about
[23:38] it, God want you to correct your
[23:40] behavior.
[23:41] God want you to correct your attitude.
[23:43] And God want you to change.
[23:46] That's the point.
[23:47] You've got to change.
[23:49] It's not love me as I am. I'm going to
[23:51] love you as you are. But you're not
[23:52] going to stay as you are because I love
[23:54] you too much to leave you as you are.
[23:58] Come on, say amen, somebody.
[24:02] So God, love the world. He gave his only
[24:04] begotten son for us to stay just like
[24:06] how we love us.
[24:07] No, he love us to change us. That's why
[24:09] he sent the Holy Ghost. That's why he
[24:12] said it.
[24:13] Why? That we may have a glorious church
[24:15] without spot, without wrinkle, washed in
[24:19] the blood of the lamb.
[24:22] [Music]
[24:25] [Applause]
[24:27] So we find out the Bible say for this
[24:28] cause shall a man leave is a mother and
[24:30] father
[24:31] mother and father leave them.
[24:33] Yes he abandon them
[24:35] cuz they're the one that nurture you and
[24:37] grow you
[24:38] mature you and feed you and clothe you
[24:39] and send you to school but God say leave
[24:42] and cleave
[24:43] and you can't cleave until you leave
[24:46] and some people just don't leave.
[24:49] So you know what happened? No cleave.
[24:54] And then what happened? The relationship
[24:56] grieve.
[24:59] Hallelujah.
[25:00] Suffer.
[25:04] Mommy boys don't want to lead the mother
[25:06] and daddy girls don't want to lead the
[25:07] father.
[25:09] But there's a requirement. Why would we
[25:11] say that? God want the commission to be
[25:15] manifested. Be fruitful and multiply.
[25:17] Amen.
[25:18] Be fruitful. Have proper foundation of
[25:23] marriage and attitude and behavior.
[25:26] And this is what we want to have sir.
[25:28] Subject one to another. Not the borship
[25:31] that we see. Even Jesus bust his own
[25:32] disciples. He said, you see the
[25:33] Gentiles, they have rulers and who is
[25:36] boss and who is who of our who. He said,
[25:38] I look, I wash your feet. I humble
[25:41] myself. I want you to do that to each
[25:44] other.
[25:45] Don't do like the Gentiles.
[25:50] This one a post. This one a rank. This
[25:52] one up. So, and who higher than him?
[25:55] Hallelujah.
[25:56] Then you get priest, bishop, archbishop
[25:58] and pope.
[26:01] Hallelujah.
[26:02] And everybody want some robe, some gong,
[26:04] some crown, some high chair. His
[26:07] majesty,
[26:09] your majesty.
[26:11] But God Jesus, he was so humble. I'm
[26:14] going to close something. So he was so
[26:15] humble that that Judas had to kiss him
[26:18] for them to recognize which one
[26:20] among these disciples this man called
[26:22] Jesus. He was walking like them, dressed
[26:24] like them, bear like them, looking like
[26:26] them. He had no special role with with
[26:27] flashing lights flashing. I am Jesus. He
[26:29] didn't have that. He was looking just
[26:31] like them. Until Jesus said the one who
[26:33] I kiss, that's the one. That's the one.
[26:34] That's the one. Don't mistake him. The
[26:36] one who I kiss. I have to identify who
[26:38] he is. That's what I'm talking about.
[26:39] Could you be so disappear among the
[26:41] crowd not to give her recognition
[26:43] that'll give her power and popularity
[26:44] and God could push you in the background
[26:46] and still you know you are son of God.
[26:48] You know you're no demon. You're no
[26:50] serpent seed. You're not on your way to
[26:52] hell. You're on your way to glory. Your
[26:54] ticket don't stamp. Your ticket down
[26:57] paid for. Your passport don't stamp. Oh,
[26:59] let's all stand and give the Lord a
[27:01] praise offering. I thank him.
[27:05] [Music]
[27:07] [Applause]
[27:08] [Music]
[27:08] [Applause]
[27:11] Hallelujah.
[27:13] May my life Lord be glorified
[27:18] today
[27:20] in my life Lord in
[27:25] my
[27:26] life
[27:29] Lord.
[27:30] Oh, be
[27:33] fast.
[27:35] Be
[27:42] [Music]
[27:53] in your church, Lord. Oh
[27:58] your
[28:00] church
[28:02] Lord
[28:05] be glorified.
[28:07] [Music]
[28:08] Oh, be glorified.
[28:12] [Music]
[28:15] Your
[28:17] church
[28:19] Lord
[28:21] be glorified
[28:26] today in my life. One more time with
[28:28] your hands lifted to him this morning.
[28:32] My
[28:34] life,
[28:36] oh Lord,
[28:39] be glorified.
[28:42] Oh, be glorified.
[28:46] Oh,
[28:49] in my
[28:51] life.
[28:53] Lord
[28:56] be glorified
[29:00] today. Just give him praise this
[29:02] morning. Give him glory. Give him honor.
[29:06] Hallelujah.
[29:08] Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. Are
[29:12] you happy to be in the house of the Lord
[29:14] this morning? Are you happy to be in his
[29:16] presence this morning? Glory to God.
[29:20] Amen.
[29:23] Oh, hallelujah. Well, God bless you this
[29:25] morning. You may be seated for a few
[29:28] minutes.
[29:30] Amen. I'd like to greet you this morning
[29:31] in the precious name of Jesus Christ.
[29:33] I'd like to How many appreciate the
[29:35] pastor this morning?
[29:38] Amen. I want to salute him, his wife for
[29:40] the opportunity to speak this morning.
[29:42] And uh certainly those who were in the
[29:45] marriage seminar conference yesterday,
[29:46] we were really blessed. We want to thank
[29:48] him for that. What a blessing. And uh we
[29:52] will be making it available in the
[29:53] library and on the website and uh on our
[29:57] YouTube channel as well. So, if you
[29:59] weren't here, you have an opportunity to
[30:01] see it. And for those, there were many
[30:03] people who were here who said they need
[30:05] to see it again because a lot was said
[30:07] and it's something you have to play
[30:08] maybe a couple of times to get
[30:10] everything right. But it was really
[30:11] really a real blessing and we really
[30:12] salute him and thank him for the labor
[30:14] of love.
[30:16] Amen. And what can we say about brother
[30:18] Anthony uh last Sunday? Blessed are they
[30:21] which hunger and thirst. You appreciate
[30:23] brother Anthony.
[30:25] Amen. And the worship service.
[30:28] Amen. So today is the last Sunday of
[30:31] January. I mean time moves so quickly.
[30:33] We just started 2015 and already we
[30:37] coming down to the end of one month
[30:38] already. But I believe the Lord has
[30:40] something special for us to end this
[30:42] month. You believe that?
[30:44] Amen. So as brother Lope said, right
[30:46] after today's service, we'll have a
[30:48] church meeting. You're all invited to
[30:50] stay back for that meeting. And uh next
[30:52] Sunday, we'll be having two services.
[30:54] our 10 a.m. service and the Lord's
[30:56] supper at 3 p.m. Amen.
[30:58] You appreciate the Lord.
[31:00] So, you ready for the word this morning?
[31:04] Just before we read the scripture,
[31:13] leave your burdens
[31:17] down by the river side.
[31:20] Down by the rivers,
[31:24] down by
[31:26] don't you leave.
[31:30] Oh, down by the river side. Carry them
[31:37] no more.
[31:39] Oh, I say to carry them.
[31:44] Say they carry
[31:47] [Music]
[31:51] No more.
[31:54] I say to carry.
[31:58] I say to carry.
[32:02] Oh,
[32:03] carry
[32:05] them no more. Let's just sing that one
[32:08] more time. Why don't you leave your
[32:13] burdens down?
[32:18] [Music]
[32:21] Oh,
[32:22] down my
[32:25] Oh, leave your
[32:28] burdens down.
[32:32] Oh, can't breathe
[32:36] no more. Oh, I say to carry. You mean I
[32:42] can leave it there forever? Carry them
[32:45] no more. Oh, carry
[32:49] them no more. Oh, I say to carry.
[32:57] I don't have to carry it forever. Carry
[33:00] them no more. Oh, carry
[33:04] them no more. Oh, you love the Lord this
[33:09] morning.
[33:11] Let's stand to our feet. We're going to
[33:13] read three portions of scripture.
[33:16] Amen. We're going to read from the book
[33:18] of Psalms, the book of St. Luke, and
[33:21] we're going to read from the book of
[33:22] Hebrews this morning.
[33:26] Reading Psalms 71,
[33:28] St. Luke 21, and Hebrews 12.
[33:37] Psalm 71 and verse 2 says, "Deliver me
[33:42] in thy righteousness
[33:45] and cause me to escape.
[33:48] Incline thine ear unto me and save me."
[33:53] Reading St. Luke 21,
[33:56] reading verse 32.
[33:59] Verily I say unto you, this generation
[34:02] shall not pass away till all be
[34:06] fulfilled.
[34:08] Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my
[34:10] words shall not pass away.
[34:13] And listen carefully now. And take heed
[34:15] to yourselves, lest at any time your
[34:18] hearts be overcharged with suffighting.
[34:21] It's a type of giddiness and drunkenness
[34:24] and cares of this life.
[34:27] And so that day come upon you unawares.
[34:30] For as a snare or as a trap shall it
[34:33] come on all them that dwell on the face
[34:36] of the whole earth. Watch ye therefore
[34:39] and pray always that you may be
[34:42] accountant worthy to escape all these
[34:44] things that shall come to pass and to
[34:47] stand before the son of man. And our
[34:50] last scripture reading, Hebrews 12 verse
[34:54] 25.
[34:56] Hebrews 12 and verse 25.
[35:00] See that he refuse not him that
[35:03] speaketh. For if they escape not who
[35:06] refuse him that spake on earth, much
[35:09] more shall not we escape if we turn away
[35:12] from him that speaketh from heaven.
[35:14] Whose voice then shook the earth. But
[35:17] now he had promised, saying, Yet once
[35:19] more I shake not the earth only, but
[35:21] also heaven. And this word yet once more
[35:25] signify the removing of those things
[35:28] that are shaken as of things that are
[35:30] made, that those things which cannot be
[35:33] shaken may remain. Wherefore we
[35:36] receiving a kingdom which cannot be
[35:39] moved, let us have grace whereby we may
[35:42] serve God acceptably with reverence and
[35:44] godly fear. For our God is a consuming
[35:47] fire. Shall we bow our heads for a word
[35:50] of prayer? Our gracious heavenly father,
[35:51] we thank you for your love, for your
[35:52] mercy to us, Lord, this morning to be
[35:55] called your sons and daughters, Lord.
[35:57] And we thank you for your presence. We
[35:59] thank you for your word this morning.
[36:00] Any man could read the scripture, but
[36:03] Lord, we pray this morning that you
[36:04] would walk out the pages of the Bible,
[36:06] Lord, and bring liberty to the captives
[36:08] here this morning, Lord. May a revival
[36:11] starting here this morning to stir the
[36:13] people up, Father. Lord, that we could
[36:15] break into the unknown this morning. we
[36:17] could break into the supernatural this
[36:19] morning. Lord, may you take me out of
[36:21] the way completely. May you speak lip to
[36:24] ear to your sons and daughters. If
[36:26] there's anyone backsliding this morning,
[36:28] may you restore them. Anyone struggling,
[36:30] may you lift them up. Anyone looking for
[36:32] the Holy Ghost, may you pour out the
[36:34] baptism of the Holy Ghost and fire.
[36:36] Lord, may you take me out of the way and
[36:38] speak to your people in the precious
[36:40] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And the
[36:42] church says,
[36:43] "Amen."
[36:44] And the church says,
[36:45] "Amen." Amen. You may be seated this
[36:47] morning.
[36:50] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Well, give the
[36:53] Lord a shout of praise this morning.
[36:57] [Applause]
[37:01] Amen. Amen. So, I have a title this
[37:03] morning. My title this morning is the
[37:06] great escape.
[37:08] The great escape. And my subject, the
[37:12] way of escape. and my inspiration. Watch
[37:15] and pray that you may be accounted
[37:18] worthy. And we're taking it directly
[37:20] from St. Luke 21:36. Watch ye therefore
[37:24] and pray always that you may be
[37:26] accounted worthy to escape all these
[37:28] things that shall come to pass.
[37:31] Can the church say amen?
[37:33] So, we're talking about escaping this
[37:35] morning.
[37:35] Yes, sir.
[37:37] And I want to start off by defining the
[37:39] word escape.
[37:41] The word escape, it means to break free
[37:44] from confinement.
[37:45] Yes, sir.
[37:46] Or control.
[37:48] It means to get away.
[37:50] It means to get out.
[37:51] It means to run away.
[37:53] It means to run off.
[37:55] It means to break out.
[37:57] It means to break free.
[37:59] It means to get free.
[38:01] It means to break loose. It means to
[38:03] make a break.
[38:04] It means to make a break for it.
[38:07] It means to bolt. It means to clear out.
[38:10] It means to flee.
[38:11] It could mean to fly.
[38:13] It could mean to take flight.
[38:15] It could mean to make off.
[38:17] It could mean to take off.
[38:18] It could mean to slip away. But by any
[38:21] means necessary, you need to escape.
[38:24] What's about to come?
[38:26] Can the church say amen?
[38:29] So, we are talking about the great
[38:31] escape this morning. And when you do a
[38:34] search for escapes, there are different
[38:37] historians and different writers who
[38:39] talk about the 10 greatest escape who
[38:41] broke out of this prison and who broke
[38:43] out of that prison and who made it out.
[38:45] And when you really study the story,
[38:46] it's not an easy thing to escape.
[38:50] You cannot escape by accident.
[38:52] You can't escape. I just see how you got
[38:54] out. I really don't know, but I escaped.
[38:56] No, there's no I don't know. Because
[38:58] when you have to escape out of a prison,
[39:00] a prison means you are locked in there
[39:02] and there are certain controls you don't
[39:04] have.
[39:04] Amen.
[39:06] Somebody say amen.
[39:07] And a lot of people they come to church
[39:09] and they are in prison
[39:11] and they smile with you and they shake
[39:13] hands with you but they are walking in
[39:15] the prison and their cage they carrying
[39:17] their cage with them and they shake
[39:19] their hands through the bars of the cage
[39:22] but they really can't worship the way
[39:23] they want to because somehow they are
[39:25] locked up. They are tangled up. And when
[39:29] you have trouble to raise your hands to
[39:30] worship, maybe you don't even know it,
[39:32] but there's some kind of prison that you
[39:34] might be in that you can't lift your
[39:36] hand up.
[39:39] You may be seated.
[39:42] In certain prisons, in a serious high
[39:45] maximum prison, sometime the height of
[39:48] the prison is this high in certain cells
[39:50] because they don't even want you to
[39:51] stand up. Because when you are
[39:53] considered a serious threat, you cannot
[39:56] be kept under the conditions like the
[39:58] other prisoners. When you are serious
[40:00] threat, they got to make sure they give
[40:02] you the little the least amount of space
[40:05] possible. You can lie down, you could
[40:07] roll off the bed, you could crawl to the
[40:09] door, but you can't stand up.
[40:13] There's only so much of that you could
[40:14] take before it's time to escape.
[40:17] There's only so much of that you could
[40:19] take before it's time to break out. But
[40:21] this morning we are speaking about
[40:22] breaking out.
[40:26] Whatever been holding you down, today we
[40:28] are making a break for it. Today we are
[40:32] getting out of it. I don't care how
[40:35] locked up, how tied up, how tangled up
[40:38] you came in the house this morning.
[40:43] Hallelujah.
[40:45] Somebody's going to go free.
[40:47] Somebody is going to go free this
[40:49] morning. And you may be seated.
[40:51] It's amazing what people will do when
[40:53] they get tired of being in prison.
[40:56] It's amazing what people will do when
[40:58] they get tired of just coming to church
[41:00] and going back home.
[41:02] It's amazing what people will do when
[41:04] they get tired of living the up and
[41:06] down. It's amazing what people will do
[41:08] when they get tired of just walking
[41:09] around the yard in the prison. After a
[41:12] while, the prison just gets too much for
[41:14] you to tolerate.
[41:16] Am I preaching to somebody this morning?
[41:19] I know I'm not preaching to everybody
[41:20] because some people like prison.
[41:23] [Applause]
[41:25] Some people like the controls. Some
[41:27] people like get up in at this time and
[41:29] go to bed and and don't raise your head,
[41:31] keep your head down while I walk around.
[41:33] Some people like that. But the sons of
[41:35] God, they can't handle that kind of
[41:36] thing. Don't tell me when to worship.
[41:39] Don't tell me I can't shout. Don't tell
[41:41] me I can't pray. Don't tell me I can't
[41:43] have a revival. Don't tell me I can't
[41:46] lift my hands and call for fire.
[41:51] You may be seated.
[41:54] One time there was a little child giving
[41:56] trouble in the classroom and he kept
[41:58] standing up in the classroom and the
[41:59] teacher said, "Johnny, sit down." And
[42:01] Johnny would stand back up again. The
[42:03] teacher said, "Johnny, sit down." And
[42:05] Johnny would stand up again. And she
[42:07] gave a final word. Said, "Johnny, sit
[42:09] down." And he sat down and he started to
[42:11] smile. And the teacher said, "What's
[42:12] going on?" said, "I'm standing up on the
[42:14] inside."
[42:18] So, I don't know what condition you are
[42:19] in this morning. Even if your hand
[42:21] hasn't worked in a month, you can lift
[42:23] your hand on the inside. Lord, you know
[42:26] the best I could do. Maybe I haven't had
[42:28] a revival in a long time, but I'm doing
[42:31] the best I could. If I can't bite the
[42:35] devil, I'll use my gums, but I'm not
[42:38] staying dead no more. If the if I don't
[42:41] praise him, the rocks are going to cry
[42:43] out.
[42:55] You may be seated.
[43:02] If you have trouble praying, you're in a
[43:03] prison.
[43:05] If you have trouble worshiping, you are
[43:07] in a prison. Hallelujah.
[43:08] If you have trouble to forgive, you are
[43:10] in a prison.
[43:12] If you can't smile, you are in a prison.
[43:14] If you can't shake your brother's hand,
[43:16] you are in a prison. There are people in
[43:18] the message in prisons, they can't shake
[43:20] hands, they can't worship, they can't
[43:22] smile. If you can't read the Bible, you
[43:24] are in a prison. Wife, if you can't
[43:27] subject yourself to your husband, you
[43:28] are in a prison. Husband, you can't love
[43:31] your wife, you are in a prison. Young
[43:33] man, you don't want to worship God, you
[43:35] are in a prison. But I see some chains.
[43:39] I see some prison doors beginning to
[43:42] open this morning.
[43:47] If you may be seated. Listen, I
[43:50] understand what's going on. Some of you
[43:52] been locked up so long. Freedom. You
[43:54] have to get used to freedom. You know,
[43:55] with a clearance,
[43:56] I give you a true story. There was a
[43:58] gentleman who was in prison for 30
[44:00] years.
[44:01] And prison is designed a certain way to
[44:03] break your spirit. Amen.
[44:05] That's the purpose to bring you under
[44:07] subjection to certain principles because
[44:10] by definition you couldn't behave
[44:12] yourself on the outside. So you are in
[44:14] prison to learn how to behave yourself.
[44:16] And for being in prison for so long he
[44:19] was used to saying this is the time to
[44:21] wake up. Go get your breakfast. Go back
[44:23] to this area. Wait right here. Stop.
[44:28] Now you can go. When they released him
[44:31] after 30 years and he stepped out the
[44:34] prison, he spent an hour, 2 hours
[44:37] standing for a while. The security guard
[44:39] said, "What happened?" He said, "Can I
[44:41] go now?"
[44:43] Been in prison so long. They said he
[44:45] walked to the traffic lights. Brother
[44:46] Kangalian, stop there. This is a couple
[44:49] feet from the prison and he didn't move
[44:51] again. The guard walked out the prison.
[44:54] He said, "You all right?" He said, "Can
[44:55] I cross the street now?" He had been so
[44:58] long in prison that he had forgot what
[45:00] it was to be free. And the enemy's job
[45:03] was to tie you up for so long that
[45:05] worship suddenly felt foreign. Can I
[45:08] worship now?
[45:10] Can I pray now? Can I read my Bible now?
[45:14] But after a while, after a couple of
[45:17] days, all of a sudden,
[45:23] [Applause]
[45:28] You may be seated.
[45:30] Hallelujah.
[45:31] I pray this bless somebody this morning.
[45:34] So, we are talking about breaking out of
[45:36] prison.
[45:36] Amen.
[45:36] I got news for you. You know,
[45:38] it's only certain people could talk
[45:40] about breaking out of prison.
[45:42] Because when you're in prison, you can't
[45:43] talk about the words break out of
[45:45] prison.
[45:46] If anybody hear you talking about
[45:47] breaking out, there's consequences for
[45:50] talking about breaking out. You can't
[45:52] even say the word escape. The word
[45:53] escape carries five more years.
[45:58] But we are talking about a prison break
[45:59] this morning and the devil could do
[46:01] nothing about it because you are going
[46:03] to go free.
[46:05] Satan, you could listen to it. You could
[46:07] get mad about it, but we are going to go
[46:09] free. The young people are going to go
[46:12] free. The young sisters are going to go
[46:14] free.
[46:18] You may be seated.
[46:23] There are certain conditions that must
[46:26] be in place
[46:27] for a prison break.
[46:32] There are four things
[46:34] that you must have
[46:35] to break out a prison.
[46:37] Trust me, I thought about these things.
[46:44] You must have four things
[46:46] to make it out of prison.
[46:49] You need to have a plan.
[46:50] All right.
[46:52] Without a plan, you have no chance.
[46:54] You need to have a good plan.
[46:56] All right.
[46:57] To make it out of prison.
[46:59] That's one of the things. Still three
[47:01] others. You need to have a distraction.
[47:07] [Applause]
[47:08] What good is the plan unless there's
[47:10] something to distract the authorities?
[47:14] What good is the plan if the devil is
[47:16] always watching you? There has to be a
[47:19] moment when he got to look away from you
[47:21] so you can make your escape.
[47:28] You may be seated.
[47:30] There has to be a moment of confusion
[47:33] that the devil doesn't understand what's
[47:35] really going on.
[47:38] You may be seated.
[47:39] You got to have a plan. You got to have
[47:41] a distraction.
[47:43] Something that doesn't make sense.
[47:46] Don't know why it happened. Why the rice
[47:49] cooking in that other pot today?
[47:53] Something different.
[47:55] Can the church say amen?
[47:57] Are you with me this morning?
[47:59] Amen.
[48:00] If you ever get in trouble, these are
[48:01] the four things.
[48:02] Amen.
[48:04] Hallelujah.
[48:09] Hallelujah.
[48:10] Hallelujah.
[48:12] You need a good plan. You need a
[48:14] distraction.
[48:16] You need somebody on the outside.
[48:20] [Applause]
[48:23] What good is it to make it out and try
[48:26] to flag a taxi?
[48:32] Hallelujah. Glory.
[48:36] You have to have somebody
[48:38] on the outside with transportation.
[48:42] you and that person can't be traveling.
[48:46] You need transportation because when you
[48:48] make it out, you have to be ready to go
[48:49] right away.
[48:53] And the last and the most important is
[48:56] you have to be prepared.
[48:59] Be prepared because you never know when
[49:01] the window of opportunity would arise
[49:04] for these three factors to line up,
[49:06] right?
[49:08] Can the church say amen?
[49:10] Well, I have good news for you this
[49:12] morning
[49:15] because out of these four parts of this
[49:18] whole program, we are only responsible
[49:21] for one part.
[49:24] Because the plan, God already put the
[49:26] plan in place.
[49:30] That's what William Mariam Brham came to
[49:32] do
[49:34] to to give us the plan. Rapture in faith
[49:36] laid in the message. I'm giving you a
[49:39] plan to get out of this place, to get
[49:42] out of this world, to get out of sin, to
[49:45] get out of church, to get out of what
[49:47] you're in. We have the plan.
[49:51] Can the church say amen?
[49:56] We are not responsible for the plan. the
[49:59] distraction, we're not responsible for
[50:01] it. Because when the Holy Ghost start to
[50:03] move and begin to move through your
[50:04] house and begin to move through your
[50:06] neighborhood like it did in the day of
[50:08] Pentecost, these men are not drunk as
[50:10] you supposed.
[50:12] This thing don't make sense. This thing
[50:15] doesn't add up. Who drinks at 9:00 in
[50:18] the morning?
[50:21] Can the church say amen? And there's got
[50:24] to be somebody on the outside who's
[50:26] waiting when you step out of prison. He
[50:28] said, "Come and go with me to my
[50:31] father's house.
[50:33] Come and go with me to my father's
[50:36] house."
[50:39] You may be seated.
[50:41] I trust this is blessing somebody this
[50:43] morning.
[50:44] You never heard somebody preach about
[50:45] prison this good, huh?
[50:47] Can the church say amen? So all we got
[50:50] to do is be ready,
[50:52] be prepared, be watchful. That's why the
[50:55] Bible said, "Watch and pray that you may
[50:57] be accounted worthy to escape because
[51:00] you are going to be the escape ones. You
[51:02] escape the Baptist church. You escape
[51:04] the Methodist church. You escape the
[51:06] Pentecostal church. You escape the
[51:08] message church. You escape false
[51:10] teaching. You escape false doctrine. You
[51:13] escape false Christ. You escape sin. You
[51:16] escape the lust of the eye. You escape
[51:18] the lust of the flesh. You escape the
[51:21] pride of life. You escape the
[51:22] temptation. You escape.
[51:27] And there's coming a great escape. An
[51:29] escape to the rapture. An escape to me.
[51:33] [Applause]
[51:35] Can the church say amen?
[51:39] Hallelujah.
[51:41] I pray by the end of this service
[51:43] everybody could able to stand on their
[51:44] feet. I pray by the end of the service
[51:47] the armor of yours that had arthritic
[51:49] pain that prison of arthritis will have
[51:52] to let go. Your hand could only resist
[51:54] far. You try try to get it up a little
[51:56] more but by the end of the service uh
[51:58] you ain't going to make it all the way
[52:00] up because Jesus came uh to open the
[52:03] prison doors. Loose them and let them
[52:06] go.
[52:12] You may be seated.
[52:15] We are speaking about the great escape
[52:17] this morning. The way of escape. Listen,
[52:20] it's hard for one person to escape.
[52:23] It is very difficult.
[52:26] It is even harder for two people.
[52:30] It is almost impossible for a group
[52:33] to escape.
[52:35] But God promised
[52:37] that there'll be a group
[52:39] that's just going to be missing
[52:40] one of these days. this group. Listen,
[52:43] this is a coordinated escape because out
[52:46] of every nation, out of every tongue,
[52:49] God is preparing a people.
[52:52] Somebody help me this morning.
[52:58] We who are alive and remain will be
[52:59] caught up to meet those that were to
[53:02] sleep in summar.
[53:04] [Applause]
[53:08] And the devil can't do nothing about it.
[53:10] The devil can't stop you getting the
[53:12] Holy Ghost. The devil can't stop you
[53:14] going to the rapture.
[53:16] You may be seated.
[53:21] Brother Brandham was relating a story of
[53:24] seeing an eagle in a cage
[53:26] in the message of eagle stirring her
[53:28] nest. And brother Brandham said, "I
[53:29] thought that was the most saddest
[53:31] sight." He said, "I'd have give that man
[53:34] $100 more than he paid for the eagle if
[53:38] he'd have let me open that door and let
[53:41] him out. Oh, to think that he was born
[53:44] to sail those blue skies
[53:46] and then he looks up there and couldn't
[53:48] do it. Somebody had put him in a cage."
[53:52] I thought that was a sad sight. But
[53:54] brother, when I see men and women who
[53:56] were born to be sons and daughters of
[53:58] God, caged in an old cage of
[54:00] denomination denomination theology that
[54:04] they say the days of miracles is passed
[54:06] and to keep you away from the real thing
[54:08] of God, walking around here trying to
[54:10] satisfy that blessed hunger that God put
[54:13] in you to thirst after him and satisfied
[54:16] with wearing shorts and drinking and
[54:18] joining churches and all these creeds
[54:20] and things. That's the saddest sight
[54:22] I've ever seen. You were born to be a
[54:25] man and woman of God, to saw the
[54:28] unexplored and explore the unknown. God
[54:31] made you thus, not to be caged in by my
[54:35] denomination. Don't believe in miracles.
[54:37] I don't care what your denomination
[54:39] does. Your savior said so. That settles
[54:42] it. That's a prophet.
[54:44] Don't let no man put you in a cage. You
[54:47] don't need in a cage. You need to be
[54:49] free. The reason you look upward is
[54:51] because you are a born eagle.
[54:54] Am I speaking to born eagles this
[54:56] morning? The reason you love to do that
[54:59] is because you are God made you thus.
[55:01] You can't stay cooped up in the chicken
[55:04] coupe. You were made to be an eagle to
[55:06] fly in the sky, the heavens above and
[55:10] sail into the unknown into the power of
[55:12] the living God.
[55:14] Can the church say amen?
[55:17] But man went on. You wasn't made to be
[55:20] like other birds. That's what's the
[55:22] matter tonight. That's what your heart
[55:24] is hungering for is to get loose and to
[55:27] get free because you are an eagle to
[55:29] begin with. Brother, when the eagles in
[55:32] the church begin to realize who they
[55:33] are, they're going to want to get loose
[55:35] and to get free. There's not going to be
[55:37] enough room for you to worship. But the
[55:40] Jerham, you might make a lap around the
[55:41] church. When you realize that the wings
[55:44] you haven't used for a long time, they
[55:46] were designed to fly. Those wings you
[55:48] have been used for a long time.
[55:51] [Applause]
[55:58] Listen to the prophet. An eagle is an
[56:00] eagle to start with.
[56:02] He was born an eagle.
[56:04] Hallelujah.
[56:04] Hallelujah.
[56:06] I'll say that again. Born an eagle.
[56:08] And if you're born an eagle, nothing
[56:09] could change that eagle status. It
[56:11] doesn't matter where you go, you are
[56:13] born an eagle. Even if the mirror of
[56:15] your life looks cloudy, you can't see
[56:17] how you look, you are still born an
[56:19] eagle. You might find yourself having
[56:20] all kind of problems, but you are still
[56:22] born an eagle. You might make mistakes,
[56:25] but you are still born an eagle. You
[56:27] might have fallen in sin, but you are
[56:29] still born an eagle. That that's what
[56:31] the devil is afraid of because you are
[56:33] born an eagle. And eagles are built to
[56:36] fly.
[56:40] Can the church say amen? Amen.
[56:44] Thank you, Jesus.
[56:46] That's what makes him hunger and thirst
[56:48] for righteousness.
[56:50] But as long as you are standing in a
[56:51] cage that says the days of miracle is
[56:53] passed.
[56:54] He said, "Oh, don't listen to those
[56:56] fanatics. There's no divine healing.
[56:58] There's no baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[56:59] There's nothing but a bunch of holy
[57:01] rollers." Don't you believe that? Don't
[57:02] you believe that? There's a man who's
[57:04] paid the price that will open the door
[57:06] anytime you wish and fly homeward
[57:09] through power, these blessings. That man
[57:12] is Jesus Christ. He died to take you out
[57:15] of the devil's porn shop and to make you
[57:18] free in Christ Jesus.
[57:20] Can the church say amen?
[57:22] Listen to brother Manam. Yet an eagle.
[57:25] All he hears, how much different is he
[57:27] from a chicken? But they are both birds.
[57:30] What is a chicken? A chicken is his
[57:32] denominational brother.
[57:35] But he's a chicken.
[57:36] How much different is it from a chicken?
[57:38] The eagle goes just as high as he can
[57:40] and builds his nest in the cliff of the
[57:42] rock and he gets up there so no predator
[57:45] can get to him.
[57:46] Get to a point where the devil can't
[57:48] touch you no more. Where the trials
[57:50] don't affect you no more. Where the ups
[57:52] and down don't move you no more. You
[57:53] know where you're standing. Where you
[57:56] moving. You know where you at. You above
[57:57] the predators. You above the situation.
[58:00] You don't look and see it's this brother
[58:02] or this situation. No, no, no, no, no.
[58:05] You see everything for what it is
[58:06] because you are so high. You have that
[58:08] bird's eye view. Can the church say
[58:10] amen?
[58:14] And brother Brand, I'm going give
[58:15] another beautiful illustration.
[58:17] Amen. So, do you believe you're eagles
[58:19] this morning?
[58:21] So, I believe God got some eagles who
[58:23] will escape.
[58:24] Because if you know you're an eagle,
[58:26] escape is built in a union.
[58:29] No matter how long you're put in a cage,
[58:31] that's right.
[58:31] That cage doesn't change your nature.
[58:33] Amen.
[58:35] Doesn't change your nature to fly. The
[58:36] moment they make a mistake and leave the
[58:38] cage open,
[58:39] you're running for it.
[58:42] So God has got some sons in here this
[58:43] morning, some daughters who are going to
[58:46] escape.
[58:47] I'm very sorry, but I cannot apologize
[58:49] for what I believe. I still believe in
[58:50] revival.
[58:51] I still believe in breaking free. I
[58:54] still believe in not living the way the
[58:56] devil wants me to live.
[58:58] You know, the devil have has an
[58:59] expectation of your behavior
[59:01] because he watch how you grow up.
[59:05] Hallelujah. And he expect you to keep
[59:07] behaving the same way.
[59:09] What messes up the devil plan is when
[59:11] you do the unexpected.
[59:14] The devil expect you to hold that ought
[59:15] to hold that grudge. Even when you say
[59:17] drop it, you just put it on the piece of
[59:19] paper.
[59:20] And the right moment you kind of uncover
[59:22] it. I drop it in a but still.
[59:27] But when you do the unexpected, then you
[59:29] trap the devil.
[59:30] Hallelujah.
[59:30] Because you don't give him room to move.
[59:32] Can the church say amen?
[59:33] Amen. in a message God's provided way.
[59:37] But the Brandham said here sometimes I
[59:38] go up into the mountains when I try to
[59:41] get away in the fall of the year to
[59:43] myself for a week or two to go hunting.
[59:45] I love that. But the brand he liked to
[59:47] get away to himself for a while. That's
[59:49] what some of us need to do. You know
[59:51] this friend, that friend, this
[59:53] association, that association and and
[59:55] these associations many time they're not
[59:57] taking you anywhere nearer to God.
[1:00:02] That's a great challenge with so many
[1:00:03] young people.
[1:00:05] They get tied up in the school and the
[1:00:07] job and and the friends and the
[1:00:09] associations. You you so want to please
[1:00:11] people. You so want to fit in
[1:00:14] until you find yourself lost in the
[1:00:15] crowd. And here it is. The prophet of
[1:00:18] God would say, "I want to go up
[1:00:19] somewhere away from everybody so I could
[1:00:21] be alone with God." And he said, "When
[1:00:24] I'm up there, I notice up there one of
[1:00:26] the most particular things along about
[1:00:29] September way up in northern Canada
[1:00:31] where there's some little lakes up there
[1:00:33] and there's these little old ducks you
[1:00:36] have down there in these rice fields.
[1:00:38] They fly up there and go up there and
[1:00:40] make a nest up there in the lake and
[1:00:42] they lay their eggs in the marsh and
[1:00:43] they hatch out their young ones." And
[1:00:46] then the little fellow time fall of the
[1:00:48] year comes on these great big ducks.
[1:00:50] Well, he's swimming around there on the
[1:00:52] pond, you know, and the first thing you
[1:00:53] know, the first cold breeze comes across
[1:00:56] and the snow cap comes on the mountain
[1:00:58] and the cold breeze sweeps down into the
[1:01:00] hollow.
[1:01:02] There's one of them little old fellas on
[1:01:04] there is the Drake. He's the leader.
[1:01:06] He's a born leader. He will run right
[1:01:09] out into the middle of the pond and
[1:01:11] stick that little hunger up in the air
[1:01:13] and go honk honk honk honk and every
[1:01:16] duck on the pond will come right to him.
[1:01:20] Now remember, he has never been off of
[1:01:22] that pond before,
[1:01:24] but he was born and raised on the pond,
[1:01:27] but every one of those ducks knows that
[1:01:30] he is a leader
[1:01:31] and know that God has sent him for a
[1:01:34] leader.
[1:01:35] And that little duck will fly right up
[1:01:37] from there without a compass or anything
[1:01:39] else and come just straight to Arkansas
[1:01:42] to the right feet to the rice fields. Is
[1:01:44] that right?
[1:01:45] He said, "What is it?" You say it's
[1:01:47] instinct. The duck has instinct. He
[1:01:49] said, "Well, if God provided a way with
[1:01:52] a duck
[1:01:53] to have enough sense to escape the cold,
[1:01:57] what about a man led by the Holy Ghost?"
[1:02:03] If God could have a leader among the
[1:02:06] ducks who when he sends the cold, he
[1:02:08] hasn't done this before, but something
[1:02:10] on the inside, he raises that trumpet
[1:02:13] and he's saying, "Everybody, we got to
[1:02:15] fly out because the cold is coming." If
[1:02:18] God would do that for the ducks, what
[1:02:20] about a man who's led by the Holy Ghost?
[1:02:24] He said, "What could what would you call
[1:02:26] that? how to escape your sickness and
[1:02:29] your diseases and your troubles and your
[1:02:31] cold spells. God leads. The Holy Spirit
[1:02:34] leads man.
[1:02:36] You may be seated.
[1:02:39] He said, "Listen, but the trouble, the
[1:02:41] duck, know it lead us, but we don't."
[1:02:45] The Holy Spirit talks to us about
[1:02:47] something. You let Dr. So and so explain
[1:02:49] it all away for you.
[1:02:50] That's where it's at.
[1:02:52] And I want to say this morning, there's
[1:02:53] a cold front coming. There's a cold wind
[1:02:56] coming and the Holy Ghost is calling us
[1:02:59] this morning to fly a little higher,
[1:03:01] to fly away from the cold and fly into
[1:03:04] the rapture. Can the church say amen?
[1:03:09] So the Bible is a book about escaping.
[1:03:15] The Bible begins with Adam and Eve in
[1:03:17] the gun and all is well. There are no
[1:03:20] problems. But as we know, Adam fell and
[1:03:24] Eve fell and sin entered the picture.
[1:03:27] And when Adam was supposed to have
[1:03:28] dominion, was supposed to be in control,
[1:03:30] was supposed to be a leader, was
[1:03:32] supposed to be an example, was supposed
[1:03:34] to be the first of many to come just
[1:03:36] like him. Something went wrong and Adam
[1:03:39] and Eve found themselves in a prison.
[1:03:42] A prison of sin.
[1:03:44] A prison of death. A prison of problems.
[1:03:47] A prison of stress. A prison of trials.
[1:03:51] That's why when Jesus came, he said,
[1:03:53] "The spirit of the Lord is upon me."
[1:03:55] Because he had anointed me to preach the
[1:03:57] gospel to the poor. He had sent me to
[1:04:00] heal the brokenhearted, to preach
[1:04:01] deliverance to the captives,
[1:04:04] and recovering of sight to the blind, to
[1:04:06] set at liberty them that are bruised,
[1:04:09] and to preach the acceptable year of the
[1:04:11] Lord.
[1:04:12] So, the Bible is all about escaping.
[1:04:14] Noah had to escape the flood.
[1:04:17] Lot had to escape out of Sodom. Enoch
[1:04:20] escaped, did the ultimate escape. He
[1:04:22] just disappeared.
[1:04:25] But the Bible is a book about escaping.
[1:04:28] When it was time for the children of
[1:04:29] Israel to be delivered,
[1:04:31] Pharaoh said, "Kill all the little
[1:04:32] children." And Moses escaped because God
[1:04:35] always provides a way of escape.
[1:04:42] And when the time was right for the
[1:04:44] children of Israel to come out of their
[1:04:46] bondage, here it is. Moses is being
[1:04:48] prepped. And God has to speak to Moses
[1:04:50] and Moses going out as a deliverer to
[1:04:53] lead the children of Israel into that
[1:04:55] great escape.
[1:04:57] And as they come out of Egypt, the Red
[1:04:59] Sea is in front, mountain on both sides,
[1:05:01] Pharaoh behind. And God still doesn't
[1:05:04] fail. He provides a way of escape.
[1:05:07] Opens up the Red Sea. I want you to
[1:05:09] catch feet this morning. Whatever
[1:05:11] situation you are in this morning, he is
[1:05:13] still a God that makes a way of escape.
[1:05:16] He is still a God that can never fail
[1:05:19] this morning.
[1:05:21] Amen.
[1:05:23] So by the time Jesus come along, the
[1:05:26] devil is already used to these escape
[1:05:28] artists.
[1:05:30] He tried to catch this one and try to
[1:05:32] catch this one, but these people were
[1:05:33] just too elusive for him. But then Jesus
[1:05:35] just came different.
[1:05:39] Jesus just came different. From the very
[1:05:42] beginning, there was just something
[1:05:43] about Jesus that the devil couldn't
[1:05:44] understand. Just like there's something
[1:05:46] about you that the devil doesn't
[1:05:47] understand why you keep coming.
[1:05:50] Why you keep pressing? Why you keep
[1:05:52] fighting when all hell is against you?
[1:05:54] Why you keep coming? Why you keep
[1:05:56] fighting? When there's no reason to
[1:05:58] smile, you still there's something on
[1:05:59] the inside that keeps pulsing. When it
[1:06:01] looks like there is no pulse, there is
[1:06:03] still a pulse. When it looks like there
[1:06:05] is no heartbeat and there's no reason to
[1:06:07] worship, something on the inside inside
[1:06:10] is trying to come out, trying to escape.
[1:06:16] Take courage church.
[1:06:21] And Jesus came with a great ministry of
[1:06:24] deliverance. A great ministry to bring
[1:06:27] freedom. For years people had been in
[1:06:30] bondage. There was a man who at the pool
[1:06:32] of Bethesda. He for 38 years. The Bible
[1:06:34] said he had been in his lame condition
[1:06:37] and nobody could help him. There was no
[1:06:39] hope for him. And year after year he
[1:06:41] would come to get help. Year after year,
[1:06:43] he would come for deliverance. Year
[1:06:45] after year, he would come for his
[1:06:46] breakthrough. And and he would try to
[1:06:48] get into the pool just when the angel
[1:06:50] would stir the water. But every time he
[1:06:52] came, he just missed it.
[1:06:56] He had been in that prison for a long
[1:06:57] time. And it's amazing because he really
[1:07:00] had no chance to get into the pool
[1:07:03] because when Jesus finally spoke to him,
[1:07:05] he said, "There's no man to help me go
[1:07:07] into the pool." So he was coming just on
[1:07:10] faith. He was coming in case there's a
[1:07:12] possibility that something would happen.
[1:07:14] Maybe there's somebody here this
[1:07:16] morning. You are here looking that just
[1:07:18] in case there's a possibility that
[1:07:20] something could happen.
[1:07:23] But that day was different because he
[1:07:25] was looking at the pool and God was
[1:07:27] looking at him.
[1:07:30] He was looking to seven in the pool and
[1:07:32] he didn't even know God's eyes were on
[1:07:34] him.
[1:07:35] And Jesus asked him, "Wilt thou be made
[1:07:37] whole?" And that man was healed. After
[1:07:40] 38 years in that prison, God unlocked
[1:07:43] the doors of that prison and he walked
[1:07:45] out of that prison.
[1:07:47] That's the God we serve. He is still a
[1:07:49] God to open up the prisons.
[1:07:52] [Applause]
[1:07:54] Can the church say amen?
[1:07:57] And then the time came that Jesus before
[1:08:00] he died in and who is this? Brother
[1:08:02] said, "And as they waited with long
[1:08:04] expectations,
[1:08:05] after a while up across the hill, he
[1:08:07] came someone riding on a little wild
[1:08:10] white mule. It was a type of his coming
[1:08:12] the second time from heaven, riding on a
[1:08:14] white horse, coming up over the hill.
[1:08:17] And this little donkey, little white
[1:08:18] donkey, nobody paid any attention to
[1:08:21] him. But those that were looking for
[1:08:23] him, they cut down branches and run out
[1:08:25] screaming, "Hosana to the son of David
[1:08:27] that comes in the name of the Lord."
[1:08:30] Their hearts were thrilled above measure
[1:08:32] for they was expecting him and all their
[1:08:35] expectations had been met for they know
[1:08:37] the scripture had said he would ride
[1:08:39] into Jerusalem on a mule and they seen
[1:08:42] him coming. What is your expectation
[1:08:44] this morning? You got to be expecting to
[1:08:46] see him. Can the church say amen?
[1:08:50] Listen to brother Brandham. The rest of
[1:08:52] the city went right on with their
[1:08:54] pouring of waters and washings of pots
[1:08:57] and their ceremonies as they went on.
[1:09:00] And when they heard this great noise,
[1:09:02] began to start, hosana, hosana,
[1:09:05] screaming to the top of their voice. Oh,
[1:09:07] I could imagine what those people said.
[1:09:09] You are interrupting our church service
[1:09:11] with your noise. Do you think that
[1:09:13] stopped them? No. The very Christ that
[1:09:15] they had looked for was right with them.
[1:09:17] How could you stop them?
[1:09:20] And when you realize that the living
[1:09:22] Christ is among you, nothing could stop
[1:09:24] you
[1:09:26] from worshiping, nothing could stop you
[1:09:28] from praising. Nothing could stop you
[1:09:31] from getting excited.
[1:09:35] You may be seated. That's why praise and
[1:09:38] worship is so important. Because you
[1:09:40] praise God, the shackles can't stay on
[1:09:42] you. That's the key to you unlocking
[1:09:44] your shackles. When you come in here and
[1:09:46] you all you didn't pray and you didn't
[1:09:48] fast and you didn't get in the spirit
[1:09:50] and you come here any old how God is
[1:09:53] looking to see something from you. He
[1:09:56] already took care of the other three
[1:09:57] parts. You have to come here prepared
[1:10:00] prepared to receive the Holy Ghost
[1:10:02] prepared for your deliverance. Prepared
[1:10:04] for your breakthrough. And when all of
[1:10:06] it comes together down comes the Holy
[1:10:08] Ghost. Down comes the power. Down comes
[1:10:11] your deliverance. Can the church say
[1:10:13] amen?
[1:10:19] But say, "How could you stop them?"
[1:10:21] And he said, "And it caused a great stir
[1:10:23] in the city."
[1:10:25] The people began to say, "Who is this?"
[1:10:27] Hallelujah.
[1:10:28] That's causing all this stir.
[1:10:30] Who is it?
[1:10:32] He's got the people, that little group
[1:10:34] of people wrapped around it.
[1:10:35] Amen.
[1:10:36] Who is it that's causing this? They
[1:10:38] couldn't find him in any of their books.
[1:10:40] None of their seminaries had produced
[1:10:43] him. None of their churches had produced
[1:10:46] him. Therefore, they asked, "Who is it
[1:10:48] who is causing this to? What makes these
[1:10:51] people act like that?" The religious
[1:10:53] people were saying, "What makes these
[1:10:55] people scream? Why are they hollering
[1:10:57] hosana? Make them hold their peace?" But
[1:11:00] Brandon said, "If they hold their peace,
[1:11:01] the rocks will immediately cry out."
[1:11:05] Can the church say, "Amen."
[1:11:07] But went on something had to take place
[1:11:10] because a living Christ was amongst a
[1:11:13] living people.
[1:11:14] Something had to take place. And Brandon
[1:11:17] said the coming of the Holy Ghost in
[1:11:19] these last days has caused somewhat
[1:11:22] alike manner still amongst the people of
[1:11:24] the coming of the Holy Ghost in these
[1:11:26] last days has sent forth a revival. A
[1:11:29] people that's called out, a separated
[1:11:32] people. A people that's free in their
[1:11:34] religion that shouts and screams the
[1:11:37] praises of God that believes in signs
[1:11:39] and wonders. Why? The same thing as it
[1:11:42] was then is now. The spirit of the
[1:11:45] living God lives in them. That's why
[1:11:47] they cry out. That's why they can't hold
[1:11:50] their peace.
[1:11:53] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:11:56] Give him praise.
[1:11:59] And the religious world looks on. What's
[1:12:01] the matter with them people? You may be
[1:12:03] seated. You know, there's some message
[1:12:04] churches where nobody says anything.
[1:12:08] Nobody lifts their hand up.
[1:12:10] Nobody Everybody just sits there quiet
[1:12:13] doing no worship, no praise, nothing.
[1:12:16] Just all dead.
[1:12:21] God rejects that.
[1:12:24] He said, "I rather you're hot or you're
[1:12:25] cold.
[1:12:27] If you're cold, I can deal with you. I
[1:12:29] know where you're standing. Amen.
[1:12:31] But if you're warm, I don't want no part
[1:12:33] of your foolishness.
[1:12:35] Hallelujah.
[1:12:37] But when you on fire for God, then God
[1:12:40] could shape you.
[1:12:42] Then God could mold you.
[1:12:45] And how do you get on fire for God? How
[1:12:48] do you get on fire for God?
[1:12:51] You pray it up.
[1:12:53] You're always in the spirit.
[1:12:55] Nobody could stop you. That's why.
[1:12:57] What's the inspiration? Watch and pray.
[1:13:01] Watch and pray.
[1:13:03] Watch and pray. And that you maybe see
[1:13:05] that watch means to be observer not
[1:13:07] watch and no watch with alertness.
[1:13:11] Because you are watching because you
[1:13:12] expecting something.
[1:13:14] You're under expectation. So you don't
[1:13:16] want to miss it. So you can't afford to
[1:13:18] miss service because you're watching.
[1:13:20] You can't afford to do your own thing
[1:13:22] because you're watching.
[1:13:24] You can't afford to get distracted
[1:13:25] because you're watching.
[1:13:27] And you're praying. and you're in the
[1:13:29] spirit.
[1:13:31] If you are watching and praying, you
[1:13:33] could never come to church dead.
[1:13:41] You may be seated. So, you mean to tell
[1:13:42] me, preacher, you know who's really
[1:13:44] serious about God in the church? Of
[1:13:46] course,
[1:13:47] I can look at you and know if you pray
[1:13:49] this morning.
[1:13:51] You don't even need discernment to know
[1:13:52] that
[1:13:54] because when you pray, you come with the
[1:13:55] church with an attitude.
[1:13:57] If you come to church with an attitude,
[1:13:59] brother Brandham say you cannot get in
[1:14:01] revival unless you're in the spirit of
[1:14:03] revival.
[1:14:04] And if you're in the spirit of revival,
[1:14:05] he said there's certain things you must
[1:14:07] do.
[1:14:08] He said a revival throws the trash out
[1:14:10] the church. It throws the trash out of
[1:14:12] your life. Too many of you have so much
[1:14:14] trash, you wasting your time.
[1:14:18] You may be seated.
[1:14:20] Hallelujah.
[1:14:20] I tell people all the time, I don't come
[1:14:22] to church to waste time.
[1:14:24] If you want to waste time, find another
[1:14:25] church. But don't come here with your
[1:14:27] dead cold, lukewarm. You don't know
[1:14:29] where you stand. You don't know your
[1:14:30] foot from your head, your hand from your
[1:14:31] toe because you're not in the spirit.
[1:14:33] This is the house of God. If you have to
[1:14:36] repent, repent. Go to the elders, get
[1:14:38] prayed for, but get on fire for God or
[1:14:40] find another church because we're going
[1:14:42] to have a church that will be clean,
[1:14:44] will be sanctified, will be holy, where
[1:14:46] we can make a revival where the sick
[1:14:49] cannot stay sick. Where the dead cannot
[1:14:52] stay dead, where the lame will walk and
[1:14:54] the dumb will talk.
[1:14:59] You may be seated. That's what I'm
[1:15:02] looking for. I'm looking for revival to
[1:15:05] escape this world. There is no other
[1:15:07] escape outside of this message of the
[1:15:10] hour. There is no other escape outside
[1:15:12] of this prophetic message. There is no
[1:15:15] escape outside of Jesus Christ. The same
[1:15:18] yesterday, the same today, the same
[1:15:21] forever. There's no escape outside of
[1:15:23] you. receiving the baptism of the Holy
[1:15:26] Ghost.
[1:15:29] You may be seated.
[1:15:32] [Applause]
[1:15:33] If you sit here and you don't have the
[1:15:35] Holy Ghost, you are supposed to be
[1:15:37] nervous.
[1:15:39] You are supposed to be nervous if you
[1:15:40] don't have the Holy Ghost because you
[1:15:42] are supposed to be, "Lord, I need it.
[1:15:44] I can't go home without it. Lord, don't
[1:15:46] come just yet until I get it. Lord, I
[1:15:49] can't go home without it. I want to make
[1:15:51] the escape. I want to be ready. I don't
[1:15:54] want to live any old house.
[1:15:56] [Applause]
[1:16:00] You may be seated. When you really want
[1:16:02] the Holy Ghost, you begin to turn your
[1:16:04] pot over. When you really want the Holy
[1:16:06] Ghost, you begin to turn the televisions
[1:16:08] off. When you really want the Holy
[1:16:10] Ghost, you begin to prioritize what's
[1:16:12] really important. What good is it to get
[1:16:15] your house fixed up nice and you miss
[1:16:17] the Holy Ghost? What good is it?
[1:16:20] [Applause]
[1:16:23] Somebody help me this morning.
[1:16:26] Hallelujah. You got to really want to
[1:16:27] escape. You really want to escape and
[1:16:29] you still have the worldly clothes, the
[1:16:31] worldly music. You're lying to me. You
[1:16:33] really want to stay in prison. You may
[1:16:35] be seated.
[1:16:36] Prison could be nice. You know,
[1:16:39] there are people who, I'm telling you,
[1:16:41] they don't want to leave.
[1:16:43] In prison, you don't have any bills to
[1:16:45] pay.
[1:16:46] In prison, they give you three meals
[1:16:48] every day. In prison, free clothes every
[1:16:51] day.
[1:16:52] Prison free medical attention every day.
[1:16:56] Doctor food,
[1:16:59] recreation,
[1:17:04] for those who spend their lives before
[1:17:06] just playing cards, playing Monopoly.
[1:17:08] Prison have monopoly, too. It have
[1:17:10] cards, too. We can play cards all day
[1:17:12] until people say, "Well, why go and
[1:17:14] fight up to pay a mortgage?" And people
[1:17:16] get so used to coming to church
[1:17:19] and saying church is it and this is not
[1:17:21] it.
[1:17:24] Because after the great escape after the
[1:17:26] rapture, you know what the devil is
[1:17:28] looking for? The church members
[1:17:30] who were in the same services talking
[1:17:32] about the escape because he'll be so
[1:17:34] upset that this group was slipped out of
[1:17:37] prison. He will come to persecute those
[1:17:39] who were just sitting down there saying,
[1:17:41] "I in church again. Amen.
[1:17:44] I trust you wake up this morning
[1:17:47] because if you really want to escape,
[1:17:48] you got to be prepared to do beyond what
[1:17:50] you did before.
[1:17:58] There are stories of people who escaped
[1:17:59] out of prison. They didn't eat for
[1:18:01] months because they wanted to lose
[1:18:02] weight to fit between a hole that they
[1:18:04] didn't even know they could fit in.
[1:18:06] Glory.
[1:18:07] But if you're really tired of what you
[1:18:08] were living in, then you will do
[1:18:10] anything to change the situation. Amen.
[1:18:13] You have to reach a point of no return
[1:18:15] where you say, "I cannot go on unless
[1:18:17] God does something for me."
[1:18:24] [Applause]
[1:18:25] My only desire this morning is to bring
[1:18:27] a spirit of desperation in your soul to
[1:18:29] break out.
[1:18:32] To break out.
[1:18:34] You may be seated.
[1:18:35] Amen. Amen.
[1:18:36] Brother Brandham is standing in the
[1:18:37] pulpit and a man is going around
[1:18:40] preachers. You know the story. And he
[1:18:41] comes in there to the church.
[1:18:43] Hallelujah.
[1:18:43] And all the ministers on the platform,
[1:18:45] they run away and leave brother Brandham
[1:18:47] there.
[1:18:48] And brother Brandham is wondering how
[1:18:50] he's going to deal with the situation.
[1:18:52] And the Lord reveals it to him. And he
[1:18:54] speaks to the man and say, "You're going
[1:18:56] to fall over my feet." And as the man
[1:18:58] comes up, he says, "Come out of him."
[1:19:00] And they ask, "Is he going to be all
[1:19:01] right?" But the Brandon said, "No." And
[1:19:04] they asked what's really going on. But
[1:19:05] the Brandon said, "He worships the
[1:19:07] spirit
[1:19:08] that's upon him." In other words, he
[1:19:09] doesn't want to be free from it.
[1:19:11] And there are people in here, they
[1:19:12] worship the church spirit.
[1:19:14] They're not Christians. They worship
[1:19:16] church spirit.
[1:19:18] Amen.
[1:19:18] But you have to have a desire. Lord, I
[1:19:21] want to be different.
[1:19:23] Let these virtues live in me. Help me to
[1:19:26] escape who I am.
[1:19:28] Break out of who I am. I don't want to
[1:19:31] look in the mirror and see me no more. I
[1:19:33] want to look in the mirror and see
[1:19:34] Jesus. I want to escape.
[1:19:39] [Applause]
[1:19:41] Amen.
[1:19:43] Hallelujah. Glory.
[1:19:45] Thank you, Lord.
[1:19:47] Hallelujah.
[1:19:48] Somebody's going to go free this
[1:19:49] morning.
[1:19:50] Amen.
[1:19:52] Whenever you come to church, friends,
[1:19:54] either one of two things will happen.
[1:19:56] You'll either get closer to God or
[1:19:58] further away from God.
[1:20:01] There's no middle ground. It's either
[1:20:02] you get drawn closer to God or you're
[1:20:05] getting further away from God. That's
[1:20:07] right.
[1:20:08] But my responsibility is to preach as
[1:20:10] hard as possible. So you become really
[1:20:12] serious about what time you come to
[1:20:14] church and what situation you come to
[1:20:16] church in and how much focus you pay if
[1:20:19] you really want to get the Holy Ghost
[1:20:20] and you really want to leave this world
[1:20:24] because judgment is hanging over the
[1:20:26] world. But before there's judgment, God
[1:20:28] always will make a way of escape.
[1:20:33] You may be seated. He doesn't sometimes
[1:20:36] make the way of escape. He always
[1:20:39] makes a way of escape.
[1:20:41] People will sacrifice for the things
[1:20:43] that are important to them and the most
[1:20:46] important thing which is the God's
[1:20:48] business. They don't want to make
[1:20:49] sacrifice.
[1:20:53] Hallelujah.
[1:20:54] I trust it stirs in your heart today.
[1:20:57] They can't miss this meeting. They can't
[1:20:59] miss this appointment. But they want to
[1:21:00] miss churchmen.
[1:21:04] Now the world is crumbling.
[1:21:06] Oil price is falling. The whole
[1:21:09] government is shaking. They they open
[1:21:11] the government oil meeting with a word
[1:21:13] of prayer. All these people they're not
[1:21:15] praying people.
[1:21:18] But the oil price is so far from the
[1:21:20] budget they decide to open in prayer.
[1:21:22] You think God listening to that prayer?
[1:21:24] But over brought out yesterday when a
[1:21:26] man house is out of order, God doesn't
[1:21:28] even listen to his prayer. You think God
[1:21:29] listen to prayer people when they're
[1:21:30] living just openly in sin and against
[1:21:32] his word, against his will.
[1:21:35] But that's what people want. They want a
[1:21:36] God and when they say something,
[1:21:38] something supposed to happen. God say,
[1:21:39] "I reject your worship. I reject your
[1:21:42] sacrifice. I reject it."
[1:21:44] He said, "In vain do they worship me.
[1:21:48] [Applause]
[1:21:50] In vain do they worship me."
[1:21:54] Not realizing God is a God of judgment
[1:21:56] and he's a God of mercy. Amen.
[1:21:58] He's a God of worship, not a God of
[1:22:00] silence.
[1:22:01] Amen.
[1:22:06] Whole country shaking.
[1:22:08] BP says, "Give everybody a VEP package.
[1:22:12] Employers are shaken. Employees are
[1:22:14] shaken. The ground around us is shaken.
[1:22:17] But we we receive a kingdom that cannot
[1:22:20] be moved. Cannot be shaken. Cannot be
[1:22:24] moved. Cannot be shaken. You may be
[1:22:27] seated. You put your trust in the
[1:22:30] economy. You put the trust in your
[1:22:31] education. You put your trust in your
[1:22:33] friends or your business, it will fail
[1:22:36] because heaven and earth will pass away.
[1:22:38] It's guaranteed to pass away. But my
[1:22:42] word, my word, my word shall not return
[1:22:47] void. My word will keep you alive.
[1:22:52] Hallelujah.
[1:22:54] Hallelujah.
[1:22:56] You may be seated. Brother Brandon said
[1:22:58] when the press come down, watch the
[1:23:00] third pull. Then you need bread. You can
[1:23:02] say, "Let there be bread." That's the
[1:23:04] power I'm talking about. I don't need to
[1:23:06] go to the bakery. I don't need to go
[1:23:08] there. I need bread. Let there be bread.
[1:23:10] Because there'll be power in the blood
[1:23:13] was church of the living God.
[1:23:18] Whose side are you on? If you are on the
[1:23:20] Lord's side, then let us serve him. Let
[1:23:23] us worship him. Let us give him glory.
[1:23:27] [Applause]
[1:23:29] You may be seated.
[1:23:31] Some of us in here, we've been sick for
[1:23:33] so long. We accept our sickness as if
[1:23:36] it's our permanent condition. We reject
[1:23:38] that this morning. I don't care how long
[1:23:40] you've been taking medication. There's
[1:23:42] coming a time we'll speak to you and you
[1:23:45] will throw the pills away because the
[1:23:47] God of God
[1:23:57] You may be seated.
[1:24:02] How many want to escape this world? How
[1:24:04] many want to escape the sin? Escape the
[1:24:07] fashions. Escape the styles. Escape the
[1:24:10] fornication. Escape the adultery. Escape
[1:24:13] the pornography. Escape the temptation.
[1:24:16] Escape the music. Escape the carnival
[1:24:19] spirit. Escape what's on your job.
[1:24:21] Escape what's on your neighborhood.
[1:24:23] Escape that man who's messing with you.
[1:24:25] Escape that woman. Escape that boy.
[1:24:28] Escape that girl. Escape whatever it is.
[1:24:31] You must want to escape. Lord, I want to
[1:24:34] be free because who the son of man set
[1:24:36] free is free indeed.
[1:24:43] You may be seated. Hallelujah.
[1:24:46] Hallelujah. Brother Brandham gave the
[1:24:49] story of Johnny Crow. Johnny Crow had
[1:24:51] been tied so long that when somebody
[1:24:53] came kindhearted and cut that cord,
[1:24:56] Johnny Crow still kept walking around as
[1:24:59] if he was still in bondage. He didn't
[1:25:01] even know he was free. Some of us have
[1:25:03] been tired for so long and when the word
[1:25:05] comes, we don't even know what to do.
[1:25:07] But I say this morning, come on Johnny
[1:25:10] Crow, let's fly south.
[1:25:13] Let's fly. Let's fly. Let's fly this
[1:25:15] morning.
[1:25:20] Let's escape the coming storm.
[1:25:30] [Applause]
[1:25:33] A way of escape.
[1:25:35] A way of escape.
[1:25:37] A way of escape. Only one way of escape.
[1:25:40] There are not two ways. There are not
[1:25:42] five ways. Only one way of escape is to
[1:25:44] be sold out loud to Jesus. To not care
[1:25:47] about anything else. You could take the
[1:25:49] whole world but give me Jesus. Listen.
[1:25:53] Amen.
[1:25:55] Hallelujah. You cannot be responsible
[1:25:58] for somebody else's behavior,
[1:26:01] somebody else's attitude, somebody
[1:26:04] else's response. That cannot be your
[1:26:07] responsibility.
[1:26:08] It's an individual affair.
[1:26:10] You cannot control how somebody else
[1:26:14] responds to the word, how somebody, some
[1:26:16] of us, we say, "Well, do this, do this."
[1:26:18] No,
[1:26:19] you could only be responsible for what
[1:26:22] you can do.
[1:26:24] Amen.
[1:26:27] You could have compassion in your heart
[1:26:28] and reach out to somebody to to see a
[1:26:31] situation resolved, but unless they want
[1:26:33] change in their lives,
[1:26:35] they're going to stay in the same
[1:26:36] position
[1:26:37] all the time.
[1:26:39] That's right.
[1:26:39] Amen.
[1:26:42] So all you could do is say, "Lord, I
[1:26:44] want to be ready."
[1:26:47] That's where the song come. If you take
[1:26:48] the whole world, but give me Jesus.
[1:26:50] Amen.
[1:26:51] If nobody else wants to worship, I want
[1:26:53] to worship.
[1:26:54] If nobody else want to pray, I'm going
[1:26:56] to pray. If nobody else want to smile, I
[1:26:59] want to smile. If nobody else wants to
[1:27:01] go to the rapture, I'm going to the
[1:27:03] rapture.
[1:27:09] Hallelujah.
[1:27:10] You may be seated.
[1:27:11] Hallelujah.
[1:27:12] You love the Lord this morning.
[1:27:17] spoke to the young people at the end of
[1:27:19] the service last week and I said to
[1:27:21] them, you know, there are a lot of youth
[1:27:23] activities and programs that we could
[1:27:25] put in place and that's beautiful. It
[1:27:28] has its place. It's important for the
[1:27:30] young people to fellowship and
[1:27:31] congregate. But you know something,
[1:27:32] there's only one thing that will hold
[1:27:35] young people in church and that's an
[1:27:37] experience with God.
[1:27:38] [Applause]
[1:27:41] That's the only thing
[1:27:42] I've seen on young people sing in the
[1:27:44] choir, do all kind of group stuff. Hike
[1:27:47] up, hype, dong, hike, sideways,
[1:27:50] bungee, jump, jump back up the bungee.
[1:27:56] And you can't see them in church no more
[1:28:00] because they have never had a experience
[1:28:02] with the living God.
[1:28:05] Amen. And that is my desire to see a
[1:28:08] genuine experience with God.
[1:28:12] Not an experience that's based on your
[1:28:14] father's experience or your mother's
[1:28:16] experience or somebody else. But you met
[1:28:19] God for yourself.
[1:28:21] Not your father's testimony, your
[1:28:23] mother's testimony, your brother's
[1:28:24] testimony, but I want to serve God.
[1:28:28] You're not going to church. That's no
[1:28:30] problem. I'm going to church because I
[1:28:31] want to hear from God.
[1:28:33] Give me some real Christians like that
[1:28:36] and we will make a church to make a
[1:28:37] revival.
[1:28:41] [Applause]
[1:28:44] The most painful thing as a preacher is
[1:28:47] to see you speak to somebody over and
[1:28:49] over and they don't respond. That's
[1:28:51] right.
[1:28:53] You tell the young people in youth
[1:28:54] services about this or that and then a
[1:28:57] week or two later you see them on the
[1:28:59] road and they don't know you're there
[1:29:01] and you say, "But what is he wearing?
[1:29:03] What is what is she wearing? What what
[1:29:05] are they doing?" And you know what? I'm
[1:29:08] not the person to judge that.
[1:29:11] But God is seeing you.
[1:29:13] Because some of you may not even go out
[1:29:14] on the street with your foolishness, but
[1:29:16] God is still seeing.
[1:29:18] And you're saying, "Lord, give me the
[1:29:19] Holy Ghost." And God is saying
[1:29:22] as but over there yesterday. When you
[1:29:24] stop that foolishness, I got the Holy
[1:29:26] Ghost for you.
[1:29:28] But what are you prepared to do to clean
[1:29:30] your life out if you really want to
[1:29:32] escape?
[1:29:36] People say they want to go to the
[1:29:37] rapture. They want to get delivered.
[1:29:40] But for the few hours in service on a
[1:29:43] Sunday or on a Thursday, they can't put
[1:29:45] those hours together.
[1:29:47] They can't.
[1:29:49] They can't prepare. People prepare hours
[1:29:51] to get to work to be prepared for work.
[1:29:53] Have to be prepared for work.
[1:29:56] They can't go to work unprepared. They
[1:29:58] have a reputation to protect.
[1:30:00] You don't have a reputation to protect
[1:30:01] in the kingdom.
[1:30:04] Didn't brother Brandham teach us that
[1:30:06] when you are born into the family, God
[1:30:08] assigns a tutor,
[1:30:10] which is the Holy Spirit, to monitor
[1:30:11] your behavior, to see if you are worthy
[1:30:13] for adoption. And this tutor has one
[1:30:16] task to follow you around and to take
[1:30:18] notes on your conduct, on your behavior,
[1:30:21] on your attitude to your wife, your
[1:30:23] husband, your children, whatever,
[1:30:25] and then report back to the father and
[1:30:27] said, "This son is a good son. He's
[1:30:29] ready for power."
[1:30:32] [Applause]
[1:30:34] Because until you are proven worthy for
[1:30:36] power, God isn't giving you any power.
[1:30:40] Amen.
[1:30:42] Amen.
[1:30:43] But you want to do what you want and you
[1:30:45] don't want nobody tell anything. Nobody
[1:30:46] tell my father never tell me that. What
[1:30:52] the word is to correct you.
[1:30:54] Amen.
[1:30:55] That's what love is. Love is corrective.
[1:30:58] That's what love is. It's because God
[1:31:00] loves you. He has these services for
[1:31:02] you.
[1:31:04] To bring you into a spot that you and
[1:31:06] him could be one.
[1:31:07] You're not here to impress the pastor
[1:31:09] and impress the believers. It's to
[1:31:10] impress God.
[1:31:12] Your service is to God.
[1:31:15] Your praise is to God.
[1:31:16] Your worship is to God. Your sacrifice
[1:31:19] is to God.
[1:31:20] Can the church say amen?
[1:31:25] Could we take some more?
[1:31:29] I'm still in that quote. Who is this?
[1:31:30] This was a huge page. I didn't have in
[1:31:32] that quote
[1:31:35] talking about Jesus coming into
[1:31:37] Jerusalem.
[1:31:41] And the religious world looks on, what's
[1:31:42] the matter with them people? Who is
[1:31:44] this? What causes this?
[1:31:47] Or I might say this, what is this? What
[1:31:49] is this that causes this? If they would
[1:31:51] only read the scriptures, they'd find
[1:31:53] out that it's a spirit of Christ
[1:31:55] promised by God that in the last days,
[1:31:57] I'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh.
[1:32:00] And there'll be a latter rain, a reign
[1:32:01] of the spirit of God falling upon the
[1:32:03] people in the last days.
[1:32:05] And he said there will also be a latter
[1:32:06] rain and a former rain in the same time.
[1:32:08] Hallelujah.
[1:32:10] So Jesus came to really set the captives
[1:32:13] free.
[1:32:15] Because you remember I said there the
[1:32:17] four conditions that come out of prison.
[1:32:19] Anybody remember the plan, the
[1:32:22] distraction, somebody on the outside and
[1:32:24] you must be prepared.
[1:32:25] Amen.
[1:32:26] Well, there has to be somebody on the
[1:32:27] outside.
[1:32:28] Amen. Amen.
[1:32:30] So in this whole world, we were we were
[1:32:32] all born in sin and shaped in iniquity.
[1:32:34] We were all born in sin
[1:32:36] by default. We were born into prison.
[1:32:38] But it had to be somebody
[1:32:40] on the outside.
[1:32:43] So God said, "You know what? I'm going
[1:32:45] to send my own son."
[1:32:46] Hallelujah.
[1:32:47] Through the system.
[1:32:49] He's going to come in looking like
[1:32:50] everybody else.
[1:32:52] He's going to dress the same way
[1:32:53] everybody dressed.
[1:32:55] When they lined up to eat in prison,
[1:32:56] he's going to line up with them.
[1:32:58] That's why when he came in front of
[1:33:00] John, they were like, John recognized
[1:33:02] him. He said, "But wait a minute. This
[1:33:03] is not a regular inmate. This is not a
[1:33:05] regular prisoner. This is He said, "Why
[1:33:07] don't you baptize me?" But Jesus said,
[1:33:08] "No, don't let them know who I am just
[1:33:10] yet."
[1:33:11] Let everything be fulfilled because it's
[1:33:13] a plan that's being unfolded.
[1:33:15] Somebody say, "Amen."
[1:33:18] And Jesus through this world of a prison
[1:33:21] went around causing disruption with a
[1:33:23] pop all over the prison, healing the
[1:33:25] sick, raising the dead, feeding the
[1:33:28] [Applause]
[1:33:30] There was no inmate in the prison like
[1:33:32] this inmate.
[1:33:34] The records were obscured. They wasn't
[1:33:36] sure how he even came in. But they said,
[1:33:37] "There's something of this image that's
[1:33:39] different. Let's try to kill this
[1:33:40] inmate."
[1:33:42] [Applause]
[1:33:44] Hallelujah.
[1:33:45] The people were never so excited about a
[1:33:47] church service. Now understand this. You
[1:33:49] may be seated in this prison of this
[1:33:51] world. The devil operating in the
[1:33:53] churches. He don't mind you at the
[1:33:55] church because if the church is in the
[1:33:56] prison, then you're still in the prison.
[1:34:00] Amen.
[1:34:02] [Music]
[1:34:06] That's why in prison they have maximum
[1:34:08] security prisons. They are medium. They
[1:34:09] are low. So as you behave yourself
[1:34:11] through life, you see all the people
[1:34:12] say, "Well, I just read my Bible." You
[1:34:14] know, he in prison I don't even know it.
[1:34:15] You know, I don't go to church. I just
[1:34:16] read my Bible. Prison locked up,
[1:34:18] numbered, name tag, everything.
[1:34:23] You have those Pentecostals say they are
[1:34:24] great Pentecostal believer, but they're
[1:34:26] playing mass. I just prayed to Jesus
[1:34:28] prison.
[1:34:31] number 8259-2.
[1:34:37] We call it what it is. It is what it is.
[1:34:40] But here it was. Jesus is different.
[1:34:42] Number 7777.
[1:34:45] Going through the line just like
[1:34:47] everybody else.
[1:34:48] But the Bible says he didn't sin.
[1:34:51] He sinned not.
[1:34:52] He was just different. People walking
[1:34:54] around the candy yard but just you're
[1:34:56] just doing different things from young.
[1:34:59] He was just different because he was he
[1:35:00] had a different purpose. He somebody had
[1:35:03] to really make it out this prison to be
[1:35:05] on the outside so that those who come
[1:35:08] out he can say get into this car. This
[1:35:10] is the car to glory.
[1:35:19] You may be seated. We cannot preach
[1:35:21] about escape unless we really knew
[1:35:23] somebody made it out.
[1:35:25] If nobody make it out, what we having
[1:35:27] this for?
[1:35:28] Let we hope so. We don't know. Everybody
[1:35:30] keep trying and nobody made it out.
[1:35:33] But that's not our situation.
[1:35:36] [Applause]
[1:35:43] Can the church say amen?
[1:35:45] So the devil say kill this inmate. He's
[1:35:48] causing too much trouble.
[1:35:51] Not only that, you know, this is where
[1:35:52] it's really messed up because in prison
[1:35:55] there are people who don't like you in
[1:35:56] prison. So the Pharisees in prison too
[1:35:57] don't like Jesus in prison.
[1:36:02] So the officials which is the devil and
[1:36:04] his crew saying kill him. And the
[1:36:05] Pharisees saying kill him. You see
[1:36:07] they're in agreement.
[1:36:10] Not even realizing that all part of
[1:36:12] God's plan Jesus had to die.
[1:36:14] [Music]
[1:36:18] And that great day of Calvary come a day
[1:36:21] like no other day. the most anticipated
[1:36:24] day that ever was and ever will be.
[1:36:27] Hallelujah.
[1:36:28] As the devil is watching, the Pharisees
[1:36:30] are watching, Peter, James, John,
[1:36:32] everybody's watching. And when Jesus
[1:36:34] said, "It is finished." The devil say,
[1:36:36] "Well, it's over." The problem in the
[1:36:38] prison is finally over.
[1:36:44] And while the devil is celebrating and
[1:36:46] prison is getting quiet, all of a
[1:36:48] sudden, you know, the room where they
[1:36:50] have all these screens to watch what's
[1:36:53] happening in the prison,
[1:36:54] the monitor room, there's a knock on the
[1:36:56] door
[1:36:59] and Jesus opens that door
[1:37:02] and they say, "Isn't this the word? Is
[1:37:04] this the inmate who was dead?"
[1:37:05] And Jesus come there took the keys of
[1:37:07] death and hell
[1:37:09] and walked right out.
[1:37:12] walked right out. Walked right out of
[1:37:15] prison. On the way out, he say all
[1:37:18] Isaiah, all of those who were dead all a
[1:37:20] long time ago, he passing by. They're
[1:37:22] like, "That's the one. That's the one I
[1:37:25] saw. That's the wheel in the middle of
[1:37:27] the wheel. That's the That's the one who
[1:37:30] called my name. That's That's the one
[1:37:34] That's the one."
[1:37:38] You may be seated. And the alarm bells
[1:37:42] in that prison started going woo woo woo
[1:37:44] woo woo because somebody
[1:37:47] was made again out.
[1:37:50] Jesus told them destroyed his body and
[1:37:52] in 3 days I'll raise her back up again.
[1:37:55] This had never happened before.
[1:37:57] And you know what it is? We need help to
[1:37:59] come out of prison. But Jesus need no
[1:38:01] help
[1:38:02] for him to come out of that prison
[1:38:05] because he was God all by himself.
[1:38:09] Because all that God was, he poured into
[1:38:11] Christ. And all that Christ,
[1:38:15] he's poured into the church.
[1:38:18] And because he lives, we can live also.
[1:38:22] [Applause]
[1:38:24] You may be seated.
[1:38:27] I trust this helped somebody today.
[1:38:30] No wonder Paul could say, "Death, where
[1:38:32] is thy sting?
[1:38:34] Grave, where's thy victory?"
[1:38:38] Huh?
[1:38:40] And since that time, since the days of
[1:38:42] Jesus, the word escape has held a new
[1:38:45] meaning to the devil
[1:38:48] because Jesus made what was impossible
[1:38:50] possible.
[1:38:51] Hallelujah.
[1:38:53] And the devil knows that there's a great
[1:38:55] escape coming
[1:38:58] because after Jesus, the escapes become
[1:39:00] different.
[1:39:01] Amen. You have Paul and Silas locked up
[1:39:03] in prison and them fellas really they're
[1:39:05] really scared
[1:39:07] at the midnight hour because if you're
[1:39:09] scared at midnight you just you know but
[1:39:10] at the midnight hour but at night they
[1:39:12] just begin to worship.
[1:39:14] They just begin to worship because Jesus
[1:39:17] was already raised from the dead. What
[1:39:19] do you got to worry about? They just
[1:39:21] began to worship in the middle of their
[1:39:23] trial. They say we worship God. We are
[1:39:26] locked up but we worship God. And the
[1:39:29] walls began to tremble and the walls
[1:39:31] began to shake because you can't lock up
[1:39:33] the Holy Ghost. You can't lock up You
[1:39:35] can't lock up an eagle. You can't lock
[1:39:37] up a true son of God.
[1:39:42] You may be sealed.
[1:39:44] They lock Peter in prison.
[1:39:46] The Bible says, I believe they have
[1:39:47] chains on both hands because they didn't
[1:39:49] want to chain one hand. Next thing he
[1:39:50] tried to use this hand to untick, they
[1:39:53] chained both hands.
[1:39:54] Oh yeah.
[1:39:56] And the angel of the Lord passed through
[1:39:57] the first guards. They actually had
[1:39:59] guards outside and inside
[1:40:01] to make sure that Peter didn't escape.
[1:40:04] And Peter still escaped.
[1:40:07] And the devil knows this and he know
[1:40:09] there's a great escape coming.
[1:40:12] So I can understand why the devil is mad
[1:40:14] this morning. Because every time we try
[1:40:17] to stop the escape, somebody keeps
[1:40:20] slipping away, running away, breaking
[1:40:23] away, getting loose, getting free,
[1:40:26] stepping out, breaking the rules.
[1:40:30] You may be seated because prison has you
[1:40:33] keeping with a certain rule of behavior,
[1:40:35] a certain way you're supposed to dress,
[1:40:37] a certain way you're supposed to behave.
[1:40:39] But God is looking for some rule
[1:40:40] breakers this morning.
[1:40:43] Who could break the rules? And when you
[1:40:45] don't feel like worshiping, you worship
[1:40:47] anyhow. You break the rules. When you're
[1:40:50] not supposed to sing, you sing anyhow.
[1:40:52] You break the rules.
[1:40:55] Is there anybody want to break the rules
[1:40:57] this morning?
[1:40:59] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:41:02] Hallelujah. You may be seated. Born in
[1:41:05] sin, shaped in iniquity. The rule says
[1:41:07] you're supposed to lie. You're supposed
[1:41:09] to steal. You're supposed to not
[1:41:11] forgive. You're supposed to do all. But
[1:41:13] we want to break the rules this morning.
[1:41:14] We want to forgive. Uh we want to love.
[1:41:17] Uh we want to worship. Uh we want to
[1:41:19] sing. We want to live sanctified. We
[1:41:21] want to take the trash out the house. Uh
[1:41:23] we want to break the rules. Uh why?
[1:41:25] Because we want to be free. Free. Free.
[1:41:27] Free at last. Free at last. Thank God
[1:41:30] almighty. I'm free at last.
[1:41:35] [Applause]
[1:41:37] Could
[1:41:41] you take some more?
[1:41:43] Hope I'm not keeping you too long. I
[1:41:44] know I'm going a little longer than
[1:41:45] normal.
[1:41:46] That's all right.
[1:41:47] But that's all right.
[1:41:48] So, we're talking about escaping. So,
[1:41:50] the devil has been nervous since that
[1:41:52] time.
[1:41:54] And after that whole period, the devil
[1:41:56] got so mad, he went after all the
[1:41:58] Christians.
[1:42:00] And he started the whole Catholic
[1:42:02] denomination
[1:42:04] until God had to break out somebody
[1:42:06] else.
[1:42:07] Somebody had to escape.
[1:42:09] So God had to go into the Catholic
[1:42:11] church because everybody was Catholic.
[1:42:13] And he fin have to find a man called
[1:42:14] Luther
[1:42:15] who was studying to be a priest because
[1:42:17] this is all he knew. He all he knew was
[1:42:20] being a priest. All he knew was being a
[1:42:21] Catholic. All you do is pay in purgatory
[1:42:23] and penance and this and that and go to
[1:42:25] tap and shall say I want you to escape.
[1:42:29] Everybody else is going down this road,
[1:42:30] but I want you to turn aside from them.
[1:42:32] The just shall live by faith. And
[1:42:35] brother Luther broke out and he started
[1:42:37] running
[1:42:39] and he started a revolution
[1:42:41] and he was not afraid. You see, you can
[1:42:44] be scared and and want to escape. You
[1:42:46] know,
[1:42:49] those slaves that were held as slaves to
[1:42:51] escape, you got to get rid of the fear
[1:42:53] of retribution and the dogs and people
[1:42:55] who coming after you, you know, when
[1:42:56] they want to escape is listen, I will
[1:42:58] escape or die, but I'm not staying in
[1:43:00] prison.
[1:43:02] I'm not dying in prison. I rather they
[1:43:04] catch me and hang me on the road to
[1:43:07] freedom, but I'm getting out.
[1:43:10] And Luther, he ran. The just shall live
[1:43:12] by faith. And he started a movement. And
[1:43:15] then God had to break somebody else out.
[1:43:17] Hallelujah.
[1:43:18] Here come Wesley. He grabbed the torch
[1:43:21] and he escaped.
[1:43:23] And he preached a message of
[1:43:24] sanctification.
[1:43:30] And then when they were looking for
[1:43:31] another man,
[1:43:34] God created a a hatch.
[1:43:36] Hallelujah.
[1:43:36] A escape hatch.
[1:43:38] He said, "I'm open up a secret." And the
[1:43:40] devil would understand. You know, I say
[1:43:41] you got to do something the devil
[1:43:43] doesn't understand.
[1:43:45] And God slipped in the open door,
[1:43:50] the open door of the Holy Ghost
[1:43:52] that no man could open and no man could
[1:43:55] shut. And whoever go through that door
[1:43:57] was getting free.
[1:44:00] That's the door the Pentecostal begin to
[1:44:02] run through and then run through the
[1:44:04] door into the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:44:06] and speaking in tongues.
[1:44:09] Somebody with me this morning. Am I
[1:44:12] preaching to the church this morning?
[1:44:15] You may be seated.
[1:44:17] And then after that open hatch,
[1:44:20] God says, "This is the last act.
[1:44:23] After this escape, there will be no
[1:44:24] other escaper tonight." So this has to
[1:44:27] be played just right. I have to send a
[1:44:29] specialist,
[1:44:31] an escape artist with the same spirit
[1:44:33] that's been here before
[1:44:34] because the first Elijah, he escaped in
[1:44:37] a chariot of fire.
[1:44:39] So this spirit of Elijah, he knows what
[1:44:41] escaping is all about.
[1:44:48] Can the church say amen?
[1:44:50] I'm going to send the spirit of Elijah.
[1:44:55] Same spirit
[1:44:57] on a 20th century prophet
[1:45:00] and that prophet will point to that open
[1:45:02] door.
[1:45:03] He will make sure that door everybody
[1:45:05] could see it. Who is supposed to see it?
[1:45:12] Everybody with me this morning?
[1:45:15] Oh, I'm having a revival. I don't know
[1:45:16] about you. I'm in a revival. I could
[1:45:19] preach to myself right now. If you got
[1:45:21] to go, you could go. I'll be here for a
[1:45:23] while because I'm in revival. I'm
[1:45:25] getting ready to get out of here. I see
[1:45:27] my escape hatch. I see the Holy Ghost in
[1:45:30] front of me and I'm about to dash into
[1:45:33] it.
[1:45:38] You may be seated
[1:45:40] friends.
[1:45:41] When you escaping sometime it's close,
[1:45:44] you know.
[1:45:46] But I tell you this, if you're escaping
[1:45:49] and the car that's waiting for you is
[1:45:50] right there and the guards are coming
[1:45:53] right here. It don't matter how many
[1:45:54] guards coming. All you got to do is make
[1:45:56] it to the car before they reach you.
[1:46:00] And that's how I feel this morning. I'm
[1:46:03] looking behind and I see the enemy
[1:46:04] trying to get me. But I see my car
[1:46:07] waiting for me. And I
[1:46:11] the world's fastest runner. He ain't got
[1:46:14] nothing on me this morning. I'm running
[1:46:16] for my life.
[1:46:24] You may be seated.
[1:46:27] All I want to do is make it to that car.
[1:46:30] Brother, I've been working out a long
[1:46:32] time.
[1:46:33] When you want to escape, when you're in
[1:46:35] the cell, Brother Clarence, you got to
[1:46:37] be doing some push-ups.
[1:46:38] When nobody's watching, you got to do
[1:46:40] pull-ups on the side of your bed. You
[1:46:42] got to do sit-ups next to your bunk
[1:46:44] because you getting ready to get out of
[1:46:46] here. You can't be like everybody else.
[1:46:49] You will get up in the morning like
[1:46:50] everybody else, but there's a song in
[1:46:52] your heart because you got escaping on
[1:46:54] your mind. You got leaving on your mind.
[1:46:58] When everybody else singing poor me,
[1:47:01] nobody
[1:47:03] knows the trouble I see. There are times
[1:47:06] for that song. Not this time.
[1:47:08] This is not the time for the trouble I
[1:47:10] see because the trouble is about to be
[1:47:12] over. I'm getting out of here.
[1:47:18] When everybody else singing nobody know
[1:47:19] the trouble I see you like no more. Why
[1:47:22] you happy? Breakfast is coming. I'm
[1:47:25] happy. No more. No more.
[1:47:31] Hallelujah.
[1:47:33] Oh, we having church this morning.
[1:47:35] Are you in revival? Are you getting
[1:47:37] excited about Jesus?
[1:47:39] You may be seated.
[1:47:41] And listen, when the devil call you for
[1:47:44] medication, don't take it.
[1:47:48] When he calls you for No, no. This No,
[1:47:50] I'm not telling you go against your
[1:47:51] doctor's advice. Now, this is a
[1:47:53] different example. Amen.
[1:47:55] The enemy has something called pill line
[1:47:57] prison. They got something called a pill
[1:47:58] line. If you're too sad, they lift you
[1:48:01] up. If you're too high, they bring you
[1:48:04] down. But they want to keep you just
[1:48:09] and now in between that lukewarm, either
[1:48:10] you're hot or cold, they want to put you
[1:48:12] right in between.
[1:48:14] But when you want to break out, you got
[1:48:15] to be alert
[1:48:16] because you got to watch and pray. So
[1:48:18] you're going to have to skip the medic.
[1:48:19] Even if they give you, you just put it
[1:48:21] on your tongue and take it back out. The
[1:48:23] stuff you're learning this morning,
[1:48:25] priceless, because we're getting ready
[1:48:27] to escape.
[1:48:32] Hallelujah.
[1:48:34] Hallelujah.
[1:48:36] Hallelujah. You may be seated, brother
[1:48:38] Isaac. This is a different kind of
[1:48:39] service this morning. Yes. Because we
[1:48:42] breaking out.
[1:48:44] This is not about church. This is about
[1:48:45] escape.
[1:48:47] This is not about headstone tabernacle.
[1:48:49] This is about rapture. This is hey this
[1:48:51] is about me and my house because you got
[1:48:53] to be ready so that you can grab your
[1:48:55] son, grab your daughter and say listen
[1:48:57] let's go now come run
[1:49:06] [Applause]
[1:49:09] great escape. Now you see me, now you
[1:49:11] don't.
[1:49:12] That's how it's going to be. Now you see
[1:49:14] me, now you don't. And the devil be
[1:49:16] looking for you. He says sound the
[1:49:17] alarm. Somebody's missing.
[1:49:20] Somebody's missing. It's going to be too
[1:49:22] late. I'm already gone. I'm already out
[1:49:25] of here. Now you see me. Now you don't.
[1:49:35] [Applause]
[1:49:38] How many love the Lord this morning?
[1:49:43] I pray something stirs in your heart.
[1:49:46] But the Ber said, "You got to do
[1:49:47] something for something to happen.
[1:49:50] You can't keep doing the same thing in
[1:49:51] the same routine, the same routine, and
[1:49:53] expect a change.
[1:49:54] You got to do something more.
[1:49:57] Give a little more,
[1:49:58] pray a little more, fast a little more,
[1:50:01] read a little more, call somebody else a
[1:50:04] bit more, get excited a little more."
[1:50:06] Listen, I always telling people, people
[1:50:08] take vacation from work, which is good.
[1:50:10] The Lord rested on the seventh day.
[1:50:12] That's fine. But people take vacation to
[1:50:14] do all kind of stuff. I haven't heard a
[1:50:16] young person tell me, I take a vacation
[1:50:18] to fast and pray.
[1:50:21] Somebody heard that for the first time.
[1:50:22] They never thought of that.
[1:50:31] Take a vacation to consecrate to the
[1:50:33] Lord.
[1:50:33] Hallelujah.
[1:50:35] Take a vacation for the Lord. Amen.
[1:50:37] You you don't go to work for no other
[1:50:39] reason than you want to spend time
[1:50:41] praying.
[1:50:43] Spend time fasting because you have a
[1:50:44] need.
[1:50:45] Amen.
[1:50:46] And you want to make sure that when that
[1:50:48] alarm sounds, when you see the light
[1:50:50] flash seven times to signal the escape,
[1:50:54] you're not sleeping on the job.
[1:50:58] You got to be so prepared. And when that
[1:51:00] sign comes, you don't have this to do
[1:51:02] and this attachment so that you can't
[1:51:05] move fast. You have to be able to move
[1:51:06] fast.
[1:51:07] Can the church say amen?
[1:51:10] Amen.
[1:51:10] Boy, brother George, I keep getting
[1:51:12] pulled all over the place.
[1:51:16] So God allowed brother Brandham to come
[1:51:19] as a specialist.
[1:51:20] Amen.
[1:51:21] To make sure that this escape plan
[1:51:23] happens just the right way.
[1:51:27] In the message, what is the Holy Ghost?
[1:51:30] But the Bible said the body of Christ is
[1:51:31] one spirit where every member from
[1:51:34] Pentecost at this time drinks of the
[1:51:36] same new wine, the same Holy Ghost
[1:51:38] bringing forth the same results.
[1:51:40] How do we do it? By one spirit. It's
[1:51:42] God's open door, the Holy Spirit.
[1:51:45] What is it? It's God's open door. It's a
[1:51:48] sign. It's a seal. It's a comforter.
[1:51:51] It's an advocate. It's an assurance.
[1:51:53] It's rest. It's peace. It's goodness.
[1:51:56] It's healing. It's life. It's God's open
[1:51:58] door to all these things.
[1:52:00] Amen.
[1:52:01] It's God's open door to Christ which has
[1:52:04] God proved he raised up Jesus from the
[1:52:06] dead and those that are dead in Christ
[1:52:08] will God bring with him at the
[1:52:10] resurrection.
[1:52:11] Amen.
[1:52:13] Amen.
[1:52:14] So, Brother Brandham's ministry was to
[1:52:16] ensure that the secret was in you, which
[1:52:19] is the word
[1:52:21] to know the plan for escape. Amen.
[1:52:24] There has always been this rumor that a
[1:52:26] group would escape. Satan doesn't know
[1:52:28] when. Satan doesn't know how. Satan
[1:52:31] doesn't know who.
[1:52:33] Because if he knew, he could do great
[1:52:34] damage.
[1:52:37] So, Satan had only one option,
[1:52:41] to infiltrate the church.
[1:52:44] Yes.
[1:52:45] To try to figure out
[1:52:47] the escape plan.
[1:52:51] And all along, God had a way to make
[1:52:53] sure that nothing could stop his plan of
[1:52:57] escape.
[1:52:59] And to do that, God had to make sure
[1:53:02] that you received the Holy Ghost.
[1:53:06] In the message question and answers, and
[1:53:08] I'm getting ready to close,
[1:53:11] before there was a world, you were in
[1:53:13] God's thoughts
[1:53:14] to give you the Holy Ghost
[1:53:16] because he knew you'd be wanting it. And
[1:53:19] he chose you himself because you
[1:53:22] desired.
[1:53:23] He chose you in Christ before you or
[1:53:26] Jesus any of you was on the earth.
[1:53:29] And he sent Jesus to die to prepare the
[1:53:32] way to send the Holy Ghost
[1:53:34] to bring you to himself.
[1:53:37] This is the church. So I'm I'm at home.
[1:53:39] This is brother Brandon speaking. He
[1:53:40] said this is the church. So I'm at home
[1:53:41] now. See, he said this is so rich to me
[1:53:44] to think. Listen, it's not what I
[1:53:47] wanted.
[1:53:49] It wasn't my desire.
[1:53:51] It wasn't my will. It wasn't my
[1:53:54] choosing. I had not one thing to do with
[1:53:57] it.
[1:53:58] But before the world ever started, God
[1:54:01] saw us and put our name on the Lamb's
[1:54:03] Book of Life before there even was a
[1:54:06] world.
[1:54:07] Talk about God.
[1:54:13] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord.
[1:54:16] From a message on certain Psalm, but the
[1:54:17] Bible say like Rebecca who watered the
[1:54:20] camel, the very camel that she watered,
[1:54:23] she rode on it to meet her husband.
[1:54:25] Yes, sir.
[1:54:26] The very God that we preach about,
[1:54:29] the very word which is God,
[1:54:32] the very God that's in the word will
[1:54:34] rise up someday.
[1:54:36] Amen. by the baptism of Holy Ghost
[1:54:40] and our critics will be killed by the
[1:54:42] same power that raises you to glory.
[1:54:45] That's a serious quote.
[1:54:47] Oh my, rise up and ride on it.
[1:54:50] So you that are sick, don't disbelieve
[1:54:52] God. God will heal you.
[1:54:54] And the devil cannot stop what's about
[1:54:56] to happen.
[1:54:57] He couldn't stop Moses. He couldn't stop
[1:54:59] Joseph. He couldn't stop Jesus. He
[1:55:01] couldn't stop Paul. He tried to stop you
[1:55:03] from coming to church this morning. But
[1:55:05] you are here this morning. Yes, sir.
[1:55:07] And he can't stop you from getting the
[1:55:08] Holy Ghost. And he can't stop you from
[1:55:10] the rapture.
[1:55:12] Just a few more quotes and I'm done. I'm
[1:55:14] not going to be able to finish
[1:55:16] so much time. Just
[1:55:17] Amen.
[1:55:19] I don't know yet.
[1:55:22] Listen to this quote.
[1:55:25] That's what's the evidence is from the
[1:55:27] law having a shadow. That's what the
[1:55:28] evidence is, brother. You have passed
[1:55:30] from death unto life. and all the things
[1:55:32] that you once done passed away because
[1:55:34] the life of Jesus Christ has put the
[1:55:36] Holy Spirit into controlling a new
[1:55:38] creature and once purge has no more
[1:55:41] desire of sin as long as you live on
[1:55:43] earth.
[1:55:44] Hallelujah.
[1:55:45] So listen to brother Bam. So if you are
[1:55:47] constantly weak and falling up and down
[1:55:50] remember you might have a mental
[1:55:54] acceptation or mental acceptance of it
[1:55:57] but never an experience of being born
[1:56:00] again. When meekness, gentleness, and
[1:56:02] patience takes the place of this mental
[1:56:05] theology. Oh, you say, "Listen here, Mr.
[1:56:07] Brandom. I study the Bible. Our pastor
[1:56:09] or so forth, I take Bible lesson." He
[1:56:11] said, "The devil has to."
[1:56:13] That's right.
[1:56:13] You know, he knows more about it than
[1:56:15] you'll ever know. That's right. But
[1:56:17] there's one thing. He can't get the Holy
[1:56:19] Ghost.
[1:56:22] You can. That's right.
[1:56:25] So, as long he can't get to you, for you
[1:56:27] are dead. Your life is hidden God and
[1:56:29] sealed by the Holy Ghost.
[1:56:32] Can the church say amen?
[1:56:34] Hallelujah. Glory to God.
[1:56:41] Listen to this. Brother Brandham said
[1:56:43] the only way the devil could ever get to
[1:56:45] you, he'd have to come through the same
[1:56:47] washing that you come through
[1:56:49] and receive the same spirit you did.
[1:56:52] Then he'd be your brother.
[1:56:53] But he can't do it.
[1:56:55] So he can't get to you.
[1:57:01] What are you saying with Isaac? The
[1:57:02] devil is only bluffing this morning
[1:57:05] because he's not your brother. He can't
[1:57:07] fellowship with you. He can't get to
[1:57:09] you. You come from God and you're going
[1:57:11] back to God.
[1:57:14] I'm getting ready to close out from a
[1:57:15] message making a valley full of ditches.
[1:57:18] Brother Brandham said, "The only way
[1:57:19] you're ever going to see your way out,
[1:57:21] the only way you're ever going to escape
[1:57:23] is an old-fashioned spiritual revival."
[1:57:26] Where the hallelujah of God is ringing
[1:57:28] from the bottom of your heart. An
[1:57:29] oldfashioned Holy Ghost send revival
[1:57:32] hits the place. Then you begin to see
[1:57:34] things. Then God will begin to reveal
[1:57:36] things. Then you'll wonder why these
[1:57:38] real Christians are hanging on while
[1:57:39] they are praying for you. That's what we
[1:57:41] need in the church now. A real revival.
[1:57:44] Can the church say amen?
[1:57:45] Amen.
[1:57:47] Amen.
[1:57:47] Glory.
[1:57:49] Now this is the description of the ones
[1:57:52] that will escape from me touch of a
[1:57:54] perfect man. Brother man said lust for
[1:57:57] money, lust for big things, lust for
[1:58:00] popularity. These things are dead to the
[1:58:03] believer.
[1:58:03] Hallelujah.
[1:58:04] We don't care.
[1:58:06] A tent or a cottage. Why should I care?
[1:58:09] live or die, sink or drown, this is the
[1:58:12] thing that I'm interested in,
[1:58:14] the kingdom of God.
[1:58:16] Whether I m I maintain my home, whether
[1:58:19] I maintain my family, whether I maintain
[1:58:22] whatever it is, let me maintain Christ,
[1:58:25] the hope of glory.
[1:58:26] Build me up, oh Lord, into this. Let
[1:58:29] Christ be my head. Let working through
[1:58:32] me on my foundation of my faith that's
[1:58:34] in him. Let virtue, knowledge,
[1:58:37] temperance, patience, godliness, and
[1:58:39] brotherly kindness work in me, oh Lord,
[1:58:41] is my prayer. I don't care live or die,
[1:58:44] sink or drown, denomination, no
[1:58:47] denomination, friend or no friend, let
[1:58:50] that work in me. Let Christ's virtue,
[1:58:53] his knowledge flow out that I might be
[1:58:56] able to teach those. Can the church say
[1:58:59] amen?
[1:59:02] Hallelujah. How many love the Lord this
[1:59:04] morning?
[1:59:05] The musicians are getting ready to come
[1:59:07] up.
[1:59:08] So friends,
[1:59:11] all these years, God has been waiting
[1:59:12] for the right season,
[1:59:14] for the right people.
[1:59:15] Amen.
[1:59:15] For the greatest prison break the world
[1:59:17] has ever witnessed. The rapture is about
[1:59:20] to take place. An escape for those that
[1:59:22] sigh and cry. An escape for those that
[1:59:25] fast and pray. An escape for those that
[1:59:27] separate from the world. Those that want
[1:59:29] the Holy Ghost. Those that want to be
[1:59:31] adopted. escape for those who want to be
[1:59:34] perfect. Nothing will touch this bride.
[1:59:37] But the B says Satan will be powerless
[1:59:39] to stop her. And the angel of the Lord
[1:59:42] is on the earth now. Messiah is on the
[1:59:45] earth now.
[1:59:45] Hallelujah.
[1:59:46] Messiah
[1:59:48] was with the prophet. He's been here
[1:59:49] with the prophet. And when the prophet
[1:59:51] went, Messiah is still on the earth.
[1:59:53] Hallelujah.
[1:59:54] Fell upon you. The Holy Spirit came upon
[1:59:56] you to reproduce the grain, the life.
[1:59:58] Hallelujah.
[1:59:58] He has never left you. He will never
[2:00:00] leave you. He will never forsake you. He
[2:00:03] will be with you in your trials. He will
[2:00:05] take you through every trial. There is
[2:00:08] no trial, praise God, that is too great.
[2:00:10] No trial can overcome you. There is a
[2:00:12] way of escape this morning. If you are
[2:00:15] weighed down by trials this morning,
[2:00:18] it's a sign that you are elect from God.
[2:00:22] Can the church say amen?
[2:00:24] The devil is trying to stop you, but he
[2:00:26] cannot do it. You will overcome.
[2:00:29] Can the church say amen?
[2:00:33] Amen.
[2:00:34] Amen.
[2:00:35] Hallelujah.
[2:00:36] Hallelujah.
[2:00:38] You could begin to play something softly
[2:00:40] in uniting time and sign. But the man
[2:00:42] said, "God is uniting his bride."
[2:00:44] Yes, sir.
[2:00:45] She is coming together from the east and
[2:00:47] the west and the north and the south.
[2:00:48] There is a uniting time that's on right
[2:00:50] now. What is she uniting for? The
[2:00:52] rapture. Amen. God's getting ready. Yes,
[2:00:55] sir. Uniting. What is she uniting with?
[2:00:57] with the word for all heavens and earth
[2:01:00] will pass away but my word shall never
[2:01:02] pass away. She's uniting herself with
[2:01:05] thus sayeth the Lord regardless of what
[2:01:07] any denomination or anybody else says.
[2:01:10] She's uniting herself. She's getting
[2:01:12] ready. Why? She is the bride. That's
[2:01:14] right. She's united herself with the
[2:01:16] bridegroom. She and the bridegroom is
[2:01:18] the word. Can the church say amen?
[2:01:22] And I want to end with just one
[2:01:23] scripture.
[2:01:24] Praise God. Amen. And you could, you
[2:01:25] don't have to stand, but you could look
[2:01:27] at it. It's first Thessalonians 5. And
[2:01:30] I'll end with this scripture.
[2:01:34] [Music]
[2:01:43] 1 Thessalonians 5,
[2:01:49] Paul's letter to the Thessalonians.
[2:01:53] And Paul is saying, and this is to
[2:01:54] encourage you, friends,
[2:01:56] but of the times and the seasons,
[2:01:58] brethren, ye have no need that I write
[2:02:01] unto you. In other words, I don't need
[2:02:03] to tell you about the times in the
[2:02:05] season because you know what hour we're
[2:02:06] in.
[2:02:08] For yourselves know perfectly that the
[2:02:10] day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in
[2:02:12] the night. For when they shall say peace
[2:02:15] and safety, then sudden destruction
[2:02:17] cometh upon them, as travail upon a
[2:02:20] woman with child, and they shall not
[2:02:22] escape.
[2:02:24] Friends, after the bride leaves, there
[2:02:26] is no more escape.
[2:02:28] But ye bron and not in darkness,
[2:02:32] that that day should overtake you as a
[2:02:34] thief. Ye are all the children of light
[2:02:37] and the children of the day. We are not
[2:02:39] of the night, nor of darkness.
[2:02:43] Therefore, let us not sleep as do
[2:02:44] others, but let us watch and be sober.
[2:02:47] For they that sleep, sleep in the night,
[2:02:49] and they that are they that be drunken
[2:02:51] are drunken in the night. But let us who
[2:02:54] are of the day be sober,
[2:02:56] putting on the breastplate of faith and
[2:02:59] love, and for a helmet to hope of
[2:03:01] salvation. For God had not appointed us
[2:03:04] to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our
[2:03:08] Lord Jesus Christ, who died for us, that
[2:03:11] whether we wake or sleep, we should live
[2:03:13] together with him. Wherefore comfort
[2:03:17] yourselves together, and edify one
[2:03:20] another, even as also ye do. And we
[2:03:24] beseech you, brethren, to know them
[2:03:25] which labor among you, and that are over
[2:03:28] you in the Lord, and admonish you, and
[2:03:30] to esteem them very highly in love for
[2:03:32] their work's sake, and be at peace among
[2:03:35] yourselves. Now we exalt you, brethren,
[2:03:38] and warn them that are unruly, those
[2:03:40] that cannot behave. Comfort the
[2:03:42] feeble-minded.
[2:03:44] Support the weak. Be patient toward all
[2:03:47] men. See that none render evil for evil
[2:03:51] unto any man. Not those in the church,
[2:03:55] to any man. See that none render evil
[2:03:58] for evil unto any man. But ever follow
[2:04:00] that which is good both among yourselves
[2:04:03] and to all men.
[2:04:06] Then Paul begins to preach. He says,
[2:04:07] "Rejoice ever more.
[2:04:09] Hallelujah.
[2:04:10] Pray without ceasing. In everything give
[2:04:13] thanks, for this is the will of God in
[2:04:16] Christ Jesus concerning you. Quench not
[2:04:19] the spirit.
[2:04:21] Despise not prophesyings.
[2:04:24] Prove all things. Hold fast that which
[2:04:26] is good. Abstain from all appearance of
[2:04:30] evil. And the very God of peace sanctify
[2:04:33] you holy. And I pray God your whole
[2:04:35] spirit and soul and body be preserved
[2:04:37] blameless until the coming of our Lord
[2:04:40] Jesus Christ. Faithful is he that
[2:04:43] calleth you, who also will do it.
[2:04:46] Brethren, pray for us. Greet all the
[2:04:48] brethren with an holy kiss. I charge you
[2:04:50] by the Lord that this epistle be read
[2:04:53] unto all the holy brethren. The grace of
[2:04:56] our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
[2:04:58] Hallelujah.
[2:04:59] Amen. May the Lord bless you. Let us all
[2:05:02] stand to our feet.
[2:05:08] [Music]
[2:05:10] Oh, hallelujah. Give the Lord praise
[2:05:12] this evening. Hallelujah.
[2:05:15] Amen. Give the Lord praise this evening.
[2:05:18] Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:05:22] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:05:26] Hallelujah. Come on, give him praise.
[2:05:29] Oh, the Holy Spirit is here this
[2:05:31] evening.
[2:05:33] My my my my.
[2:05:36] Hallelujah.
[2:05:38] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:05:43] Hallelujah.
[2:05:45] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:05:47] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:05:50] Hallelujah. Praise God. Amen. Praise
[2:05:53] God. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:05:56] Yes.
[2:05:57] Softly and tenderly
[2:06:02] Jesus
[2:06:04] is calling,
[2:06:07] calling
[2:06:08] for you and for me.
[2:06:13] [Music]
[2:06:16] will see
[2:06:18] on the portals.
[2:06:20] He's waiting
[2:06:23] and watching,
[2:06:26] watching
[2:06:28] for you,
[2:06:30] for me.
[2:06:33] Oh, this morning. Come home.
[2:06:40] Come home.
[2:06:45] Ye who are weary
[2:06:49] come oh
[2:06:55] earestly
[2:06:57] tenderly
[2:07:00] Jesus
[2:07:02] is calling.
[2:07:06] Oh sinner
[2:07:08] come home.
[2:07:11] Time is now fleeting. The moments are
[2:07:12] passing. Time is now fleeting.
[2:07:18] The moments
[2:07:20] are passing from you and from me.
[2:07:23] Passing from you and from me.
[2:07:29] Shadows are gathering. Death's night is
[2:07:31] coming. Shadows
[2:07:34] are gathering.
[2:07:37] Death's night
[2:07:39] is coming.
[2:07:41] Oh, coming for you and for me. Oh, come
[2:07:49] home.
[2:07:50] Come home.
[2:07:53] Come home.
[2:07:55] Come home.
[2:07:58] Home.
[2:08:00] Oh ye who are we wearing
[2:08:05] come oh
[2:08:09] [Music]
[2:08:11] earnestly
[2:08:13] tender.
[2:08:15] Jesus
[2:08:17] is calling.
[2:08:21] Oh sinner
[2:08:24] come home.
[2:08:28] Oh, right now just lift your hands up
[2:08:29] right where you are.
[2:08:33] You make your altar right where you are
[2:08:34] this morning. This is between you and
[2:08:37] God.
[2:08:40] Oh, how many want to escape this
[2:08:42] morning?
[2:08:44] Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. How many
[2:08:46] want to escape this morning?
[2:08:50] Oh, hallelujah. Our ministry was
[2:08:52] ministered to you abundantly.
[2:08:54] Oh, hallelujah. entrance was ministered
[2:08:56] to you abundantly today. Won't you
[2:09:00] escape today? How many you want to run
[2:09:02] away this morning? How many want to run
[2:09:05] away to glory this morning? There's a
[2:09:07] place home in glory for you this
[2:09:08] morning. Brother Brandham saw it. The
[2:09:11] saints of old saw it. Oh, hallelujah.
[2:09:14] Hallelujah. Just as sure as we're
[2:09:15] standing here in this room tonight.
[2:09:18] There's a new Jerusalem, a holy city.
[2:09:20] Oh, there's a rapture this morning. Oh,
[2:09:23] hallelujah. There's a place Jesus said,
[2:09:25] "I go to pray a place for you that where
[2:09:28] I am, there you may be also." Oh, how
[2:09:31] many want to go to that place this
[2:09:33] morning? Oh, hallelujah. Lift your hands
[2:09:35] up right now. You make your altar right
[2:09:37] where you are. This is between you and
[2:09:39] God this morning. Oh, hallelujah.
[2:09:42] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, how you get
[2:09:45] right with God this morning. Oh,
[2:09:47] hallelujah. Hallelujah. If you feel like
[2:09:49] you heard the word this morning and and
[2:09:51] something pricricked your heart this
[2:09:53] morning, you feel like you want to
[2:09:54] escape this morning, you feel like you
[2:09:56] want to run away this morning, run away
[2:09:59] to Jesus this morning, his arms are open
[2:10:02] to you this morning. If you'd only be
[2:10:04] willing to run, turn aside. Hallelujah.
[2:10:07] He said, "If my people shall humble
[2:10:09] themselves and pray and turn aside from
[2:10:13] their wicked ways, oh hallelujah,
[2:10:16] they'll hear from heaven. He'd forgive
[2:10:18] their sins. He'd heal their land. He
