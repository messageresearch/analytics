========================================

looks like it's overcast it looks like it's never going to end but if he goes just a little bit further he'll break through he'll break out of the rain and sometimes I feel we need God's perspective tonight to show us that all rain clouds are not going to last forever that our midnight is not going to last forever weeping may endure for a night but the Bible says joy comes in the morning and if you could push tonight if you could press your way tonight just a little bit further beyond the clouds that you are currently seeing you're going to break through into the sunlight oh hallelujah hallelujah I thank God that trouble don't last always amen and amen oh do you love him tonight but it is 100% possible to go off track that's why we have to trust him isn't that right Abraham and Sarah they were promised a son and you know what happened they got anxious Sarah got anxious and they concocted a plan to come up with a son that was not the plan and they ended up with Ishmael isn't that right and uh you know and God had to correct that and bring it back Amen to what he said was going to take place that this promised son Isaac that there would were truly waiting on was the son that was really to come forth by the womb of Sarah yes sir and that's what happens when we try to take things into our own hands when we try to be masters of our own destiny we end up going off track because we don't know the plan we don't have God's perspective and if there's one thing I learned recently is that faith is not having faith in your plan but faith is about having faith in God's plan isn't that right faith is not trusting in what you can do faith is trusting in what God can do faith is not trusting in what you can figure out faith is trusting that God has got it in control and that no matter how cloudy it looks right now no matter how messed up the situation looks right now the god that brought me through is the God is going to work it out oh and when he works it out he does a good job every single time he does a perfect work because he's a perfect God and that's the God we serve tonight isn't that right amen amen amen he has a time he has a place for everything to happen in a specific way and he does it that way why does he do it that way so that you could say it wasn't your education it wasn't your ability that brought you to the spot it wasn't what you could do is what what he has done in your life and anytime you open your mouth you can only give God praise for what he has done in your life oh Hallelujah the car that you drive the house that you live in is only by the grace of God the things that he has given you is only by the grace of God he has constrained your life to his praise tonight that you could only give him praise by the things that he has blessed you with isn't all right he works it out so that you he can get all the glory because it's not about you it's about him this tonight amen I heard a preacher say he said whatever you don't turn over into praise he said it turns over into Pride I'll say that one more time whatever you don't turn over into praise ends up turning into Pride because you begin to get in your head that you made it happen on your own and the truth is you didn't do nothing on your own we didn't wake ourselves up this morning we didn't put breath in our body we didn't make ourselves intelligent that was God that gave us food to eat it was God that provided for us it was God that worked things out and when the bottom fell out and we felt that all hope was gone here come God never late but right on time he's an on time God tonight he'll be on time in your situation he'll be on time in your circumstance oh he's never late tonight it might look like he is but he is working things out on your behalf don't you worry isn't that right I'm getting ready to close oh my there's so much we have here but I feel like the message has got home in some way amen and amen hallelujah isn't that right so when God spoke the willing to ex distance he addressed the darkness first he said let there be light and he pushed back the darkness and then now he now that it was light and he could see he could now address the Earth and all its other conditions so he created the heavens and the the sky and beasts and animals and started forming the Earth and all of that was the forming part of the process but he couldn't do that without light and so too tonight and I like likeness onto having a purpose and to having a vision and these things is what bring light to our circumstance these things is what bring light to our present situation Faith a revelation from God God has to open our eyes to see what he wants from us and when our eyes are truly open and we see ourselves in the reflection of God's vision for us then we could see what needs to happen in order to bring us into shape in order to bring us into form so that we could begin to reflect the father's good work isn't that right he needed to see what he was working with so he said let there be light and there was light and then he began to separate the waters from the heavens and all of that was shaping and forming bringing it into form and then he addressed the void afterwards which was bringing plant life animal life and then he created man In His Image and likeness isn't that right Hallelujah glory to God isn't that right oh my oh so let me get ready to wind on here as much as I can amen but God gives us purpose isn't that right and out of purpose we get vision and then out of vision we could begin to shape or form what it is we're actually trying to do all of us are shaped a certain way tonight shaped a certain way by our experience shaped a certain way by our conversations by things we've seen by things we've heard God had for us to come the way we come so that he could shape us that he could form us he knew by his Divine wisdom what family you would born into he knew what parents you were going to have he knew what kind of home you were going to grow up in because he knew what kind of person he wanted you to be he knew what challenges you would face face but he also know what gift he placed inside of you and by God's grace he's going to let that gift come to light oh Hallelujah by God's grace he's going to bring you into his Perfection and he's going to work on you and work on you it's not a one day Wonder oh but it's every day he's chipping away and cutting away and it's a painful process because we don't like it but we have to go through it in order to be shaped in order to be formed into the word image he has to cut off some of the world cut off some of our desires cut off some of the things that we don't like cut off some of the things that we want cut off some of the things that we desire in order to bring us to his desire in order to bring us to what he wants what he wants in our lives oh what Spirit he wants to abide in us we he can't because he can't use us in the state that we're in he has to get us in shape he has to get us in form isn't that right oh my my my I have a scripture here praise God Amen says if thou has run with the footmen and they have wearied thee then how cast thou contend with horses and in the land of Peace where thou trusteth if they weary thee then how will thou do in the swelling of the Jordan so if you have to run with the footman tonight you have to get fit you have to get in shape you have to get in form you have to get in shape in order to run this race oh Hal because this is a long distance race and in order to run this race you have to be in shape in order to run this race you have to be able to take every day as it comes and every day with Jesus has to be sweeter than the day before and even though you might fall seven times you get up eight times tonight make sure you're getting up outweighs the time you fell down and keep on moving forward tonight because there's a goal Beyond us there is something we are trying to achieve there is a form that God wants to bring us into oh Hal but we have to be willing to subject ourselves to the purpose of shaping and to the purpose of forming isn't that right oh Hallelujah musicians can get ready isn't that right amen they could come isn't that right oh Hallelujah David think of David he had to be shaped isn't that right he had to be formed he had a gift isn't that right and God wanted him to be in a position of leadership but he had to go through stuff he had to be shaped and formed in the wilderness a ruddy young man didn't look like much to look at he was in sheep skins playing a harp but that was God's man and he had certain pictures in his mind because he was a shepherd and then one day when he went out to meet golad he said who is this uncircumcised Philistine that defies the armies of the Living God who is this guy who is this this uncircumcised Philistine you see the the thing was that he had a certain perspective when he looked at Goliad he saw the same situation that he had encountered in the wilderness when a bear came and tried to take one of his sheep he slaughtered that bear with the sling and when a lion came along he slaughtered that lion with the sling and he saw this man this uncircumcised Philistine sent from the camp of the enemy is here to Tower over God's sheep and here they are buckling and cowering in fear and God had a man in the wilderness who was shaped who was formed a certain way his mind was shaped a certain way uh he couldn't rest with that picture it didn't seem right to him that the devil would take advantage of God sheep and tonight it does not rest with us that you would be taken advantage of by the devil and all his tricks we are here to say no we are here to come against the forces of the enemy because our minds have been shaped a certain way we've seen too much how can we help but speak by the things that we have seen and of the things that we have heard oh we can't help but prophesy tonight oh we can't help but tell of the goodness of God we can't help but stand for righteousness we can't help but stand for Holiness we can't help but stand for Purity oh Hallelujah when we see the enemy coming like a flood we know that the word of God somewhere will raise a standard against that enemy and so we cannot back down tonight we will not take no for an answer oh but we will stand upon the word of God and though he slame me yet will I trust him I'll be here on the battlefield fighting for my Lord until he come oh Hallelujah because that's the way we are shaped that's the way we are formed oh we are not children of this world but we are the sons and daughters of God oh H and God has an inheritance for us oh God has a place for us in his kingdom there is power in his kingdom there is anointing in his kingdom there is Glory oh and he wants to get you in shape tonight oh why don't you worship why don't you lift your hands oh Hallelujah getting in the atmosphere getting in the spirit all of that is part of getting in shape getting in form uh because when we get to heaven there's going to be shouting on the Hills of Glory when we get over to the other side there's going to be worship there's going to be rejoicing there's going to be singing there's going to be shouting oh Hallelujah why not get in shape tonight oh begin to practice it right here tonight practice worshiping God practice being in his presence practice that anointing because that is the place that we're going back to tonight oh hallelujah hallelujah formed into his image formed into his glory he could begin to play something softly St John 537 I uh St John 537 I'll close with this you can continue standing you can play something softly Jesus said here he said and the father himself which had sent me had borne witness of me that ye had neither heard his voice at any time nor seen his shape yet ye have not his word abiding in you for whom he had sent him you believe not search the scriptures he says for in them you think you have eternal life but they are they which testify of me isn't that right the truth is we couldn't have Christianity tonight if we didn't have Christen because he came in a shape and a form that we could understand he was mysterious throughout the ages but when he came as Jesus he came as a manifest ation of the very Heart Of God he came in a shape and a form that we could understand he he healed the sick he raised the dead He restored the lepers oh he did things oh all of a sudden in his presence when you are confused things begin to make sense oh Hal because he takes a shape and a form that we could connect with that we know has a has a representation down in the heart oh Hallelujah isn't that right oh Hallelujah Hall isn't that right and we were able to see him and understand him isn't that right praise God is that he was on the example seedson and he was lead and led by example and if he had to pray and how much more do we have to pray tonight and if he stayed long enough in the Garden of Gethsemane to say if not my uh not my will Lord but thy will be done how much more do we have to subject ourselves tonight to the will of God that we could be shaped tonight so tonight as I leave are you prepared tonight to stay long enough to be shaped by God we all shaped and bent in many ways some of us have gone through a lot of things that maybe have affected us negatively God knows all about it he knows all about your shape tonight he knows all about your journey and he wants to form you into His Image tonight he wants wants to do something that you cannot do for yourself he wants to bring you into His Image he wants to bring you into his Sheepfold and sometimes he has might have to break our legs to do it but the master the Good Shepherd is here tonight to tuck us under his arm and carry us home he left the 99 he's going after that one tonight will you be that one tonight that will surrender your heart to him will you be that one tonight that will surrender yourself to him tonight that he could take a hold of our lives and shape us and form us into what he wants us to be may the Lord richly bless you tonight I'm finished oh let's lift
