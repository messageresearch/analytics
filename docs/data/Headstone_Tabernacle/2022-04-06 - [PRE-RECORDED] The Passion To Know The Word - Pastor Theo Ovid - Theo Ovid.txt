be the name of the lord blessed be name of the lord so i'd like to turn in bibles ephesians chapter four i want to read verse 11 to 13 and revelation chapter 1 verse 1 to 3. there's two portion of scriptures ephesians 4 11-13 and revelation 1 1-3 ephesians 4 verse 11 and he gives some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ till we all come in the unity of the fate and of the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ revelation chapter 1 i want to read from verse 1-3 the revelation of jesus christ which god give unto him jesus christ to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he's sentenced signified by his angel unto his servant john who'll be a record of the word of god and of the testimony of jesus christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that read it indeed that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand let us bow heads almighty god may you inspire us edify us reveal yourself to us come among us manifest your love to us we are helpless this morning we are needy this morning and we call upon your matchless name your awesome power to make known your word to your people take me out of the way hindi and calvary's cross i may be glorified in our midst and jesus might ask it amen and name you may be seated praise god well this morning i have a title the passion to know the word that's the title this morning the passion to know the word i have a subject the knowledge of the son of god another inspiration god said so our context scripture from psalms 119 verse 9 says wear it thou shall a young man cleanse his way by taking he thereon to according to thy word with my whole heart have i sought thee oh let me not wander from thy commandments thy word have i hidden my heart that i might not sin against thee think that scripture would read in again this from psalms 119 verse nine where it all shall a young man cleanses me how that young man to be cleansed by taking heed there to according to thy word with my whole heart have i sought thee oh let me not wander from thy commandments thy word have i hidden my heart that i might not sin against thee so his word you could actually hide it in your heart you could treasure it nobody can see it on you it's inside of there you are covered inside your heart david said with my whole heart i sought out today now passion means a strong feeling or enthusiasm or excitement for something that's what a passion is it's enthusiasm a strong feeling that causes you to act in a dangerous way that's when you have passion passion is emotions as distinguished from reason when somebody have a passion it looks like they have reasoning they are zealous they are enthusiastic they are on fire they have an output they are animated they have joy there's an intensity to go with it you don't have passion half dead you don't have passion have sleepy that's not passion you are sleepy passion you excited about it you can't wait to get there god when they said unto me let us go in the house of the lord and we talk in this moment a passion to know the word of god a passion to know what god said that you could tell that every god said so come on say him and somebody you got to know what you have to tell that devil because when you're confronted by that devil you don't know you don't know what to tell that devil the devil will slap you up tap you up and push you in the corner but when you know it is written come on it is written when you know it is written it is written oh i want fire to break upon your soul that there will be a deep in your soul crying for the word of god hallelujah praying for the knowledge of the son of god hallelujah blessed is he that read it and here at the words of this book oh give the lord a shout of praise people hallelujah praise the name of the lord now the scripture we read in ephesians in the amplified he said and his gifts were varied he himself appointed and give men to us some to be apostles special messengers is the amplifier some prophets inspire teachers and expounders some evangelists preachers of the gospel traveling missionaries some pastors shepherds of his teachers his intention was the perfecting and the fully equipping of the saints his consecrated people that they should do the work of ministering towards building up christ's body the church so the real church is christ body it's not men church no it is my church the one that jesus said he's gonna build that is his body so when we talk about church we're not talking about this building or this bunch of people we're talking about by one spirit we are baptized into one body and that body is called the church come on same as somebody so this is a gathering of people we say this is church but the real church is the body of which he is the head come on say man somebody not pope francis no he is the head of that body hallelujah not some bishop in rome or any other bishop from any other part of the world he is the head of that body do you know him oh hallelujah do you know him you've got to know him hallelujah okay [Music] here this part that it might develop until we all attain oneness in the fate and in the comprehension of the full and accurate knowledge of the son of god that we might arrive at really mature manhood the completeness of personality which is nothing less than the standard height of christ's own perfection the measure of this touch of the fullness of christ and the completeness found in him till we all come into the union of the faith the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man unto the measure of the statue of that's what we're talking about with full maturity fully grown that they could handle your stuff no more immature no more childish no more playing nintendo and playing games and so forth praise god and the plane coming back down say a big man and he says hold forward triple trip whole triple trippy times going like that ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding the complaint of god and you will see where the title comes from but the brandon was reading version two for never rest i have someone against thee because thou has left thy first love hallelujah you see i like your labor i like how you hate them who uh and hate the nicolaitan spirit i like how you're challenging them say the apostles are not on a phone to be liars you're exposing liars they're pulling a rank on you you're checking them out by the word of god hallelujah nobody pulling wool over your eye no you know the word because paul taught them they used to tell them you're not preaching what paul preached they're not preaching what paul preached paul is the messenger of the age he's a star he's the in the right hand of almighty god you got to say what paul said if you're not single paul say you are false amen [Applause] that's how these two that's how these ephesians believers were like that they were in the word they know the word oh glory to god they had a passion to know the word that is another word they just come to church they want to be just in the message they want to become the message do you know your message [Music] so god have a complaint against them you left the first love that works that building that deakin ushers and elders did everything you could think about but the love was not there hallelujah because for god it has to be about love you have to love him to truly save him isn't that right listen to the prophet now okay here we go to understand this you must realize that this no he's referring to the same statement nevertheless i have somewhat against thee because i was left thy first love to understand this you must realize the spirit is not speaking to the original saints of ephesus alone this message is to the entire age which lasted 120 years the message then is to all the generations in that span now history keeps repeating itself in the generation of israel we see revival in one generation only to see the fires phasing on the next in the third generation the embers may be glowing slightly fought there'll be no vestige of the original flame then god have to light the fire again and the same process is repeated what is he saying god's fire start off he go lower he go lower then he had to find it because you see no fire again fire flare up zeal enthusiasm passion love of god and then fire cool down cool down and that repeat over and over so listen to how we describe it then god lights a fire again same process is repeated it's simply the manifestation of truth that god has no grandchildren amen salvation is not passed by natural birth any more than there's any truth or positive succession it isn't in the world you start out with truly born again believers and then the next generation are no longer just plain christians but they have taken a denominational name there are no baptists methodists that's exactly what they are too they are not christians you have to be born of the will of god not the will of man not because your mother in church is a christian your father in church christian is to be christ-like [Applause] some of the most evil people is in his message say good lord that's not bad behavior people you know they're not boxing people they're going to the other side now they need to believe this but the evil evil spirited now watch they're not christians you have to be born of the will of god not of the will of man to be saved but these folks are all coming together by the will of man now i don't say that some of them not end of all right with god no but the original fire has died down this is where i get it from now and i see three messages out of the day the fervent desire to please god the passion to know his word the cry for reaching out in the spirit all begins to fade and instead of the church being on fire with the fire of god it has cooled off and become formal that is what was happening to the ephesians they were getting a bit formal the abandonment of god was dying out and people here we go want to careful about what god taught of them as they begin to be careful about what the world taught of them so then you have to do it here a certain way because you ain't nobody laughed at you that addresses it no way because then when you laugh at you and you see muslims you see people in the gong it could be hot and the only the eye alone showing they're not ashamed they're wearing the black you can see the jews there's the black pants the same white shirt you know there's one shirt and one pants they have every time you see them in the same color they're not even looking colorful about it they have everything in the back of the head the boys are little curls and so on you can see them from a distance but christian get in fight or even bow the heads and pray for their meals in public we're talking about an abandonment to god and every time i see these extremities i tell myself why we can't be not so much extreme but zealous and enthusiastic about this glorious message and this evening light that god brought of us understand we were wretched miserable naked poor didn't even know it god rich in mercy common send a prophet bring light in this dark age you could nowhere to walk praise god praise god and we have big shots we have arrogant proud people people that feel this self righteous judging everybody and whatnot but is the mercy of god that came to us to send us that elijah the prophet to bring a seventh seventh candle message oh glory to god hallelujah we should be rejoicing every time we come in service thank you lord thank you lord hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah your hand should be always up praise god hallelujah praise god hallelujah when the devil come into the church and see you she said let's get out of here praise god and people worshipping too much let's get out of here hallelujah demons looking for a church to go and interfere with he must pass here straight he said not that one not that one those people on fire they have the zeal of the lord jesus said the zeal of my father's house had eaten me up he took a belt and beat them out he was so enthused he it make him act radical come on team and somebody it made jesus act radical because he said my father's house shall be a host of prayer and you have made it to a ten of thieves oh glory hallelujah don't worry that god god or judgment how much money you have how much fresh amounts too much of car how much whatever it is god don't judge you by that halloween money doesn't bring relationships nobody doesn't keep relationships money doesn't keep love money can't buy love money can't buy friendship money can't be relationship you could have friendship and love and relationship without one cent that's why the bible said without money without price without money coming by without money without price come and buy without money without price glory hallelujah [Applause] stick up in your truth and you're balling oh god i need you and lord i need your lord you don't have to wait for that some accident and your day and your hospital bed and your foot stick up here and some tube here and something here and then oh god oh god oh god you don't wait for that hallelujah everybody have to face it we are coming down to that hallelujah you see a little child two years old that's a big man into your old form hallelujah that's not going to child all the time hallelujah we not here all the time we're here to give a testimony we only give a witness so glory to god but i'm lonely see certain things he said oh god help me live to see it oh god is my prayer looking for the all when man will walk down and say silvan gold have i none but such as i have i give it unto you looking for the manifestation of the sons of god when born sons phil's sons speak the word is manifested just like that he was not talking about a bunch of church members warming some church bench he was talking with literal adam back again that first item that fell that adam get back restored and god the devil told his children adam and god raised back up many atoms the restoration of the sons of god to take us back to eden oh glory to god this gospel is real [Applause] [Music] [Applause] sit down a minute eat doubted and that's why we in this angry here getting barely pain kidney problem and that problem and that problem an arthritic problem and what kind of an eye problem and all kinds of problems or because a woman doubted sarah slightly doubted sarah had an interpretation for abraham god tell abraham true sarah you have a son sarah come and said no here's how it's going to be that's how abram ended up with ishmael look what we have now we have isis the generation from ishmael yeah that's right because a woman slightly doubted what god said all abraham was telling his wife god said so [Applause] i am not hearing you when sarah was telling them stuff all abraham was a woman god said so i look how buried you are we look not by sight but by [Music] [Applause] for you to say and express god said so you have to know what god said you got to have the passion to know what god said if you don't know what god said the devil could deceive you come on shame and somebody now remember in genesis come on sit down sit down a minute hallelujah hallelujah praise god in genesis the devil did not attack evil so the prophet said the devil coming serpent he said what did god say because god's not talking to me i don't know what god said now i said um they said nothing will never get messed up because he still don't know what god said eve keep him out shirt but he said god said we could eat of every tree in the garden either but the three of myths don't eat because the day they did that you shall die then god the devil hear what god said that he could twist it he has to hear it to twist it he's the twister he's a rock and roll star he does dance the twists peters do the twist he does twist things he said you shall not surely die one woman doubted one woman slightly doubted but let me tell you about one more woman just one more woman let's talk about that woman her name is mary when the angel brought the word to her hallelujah you know what she said be it done unto me according to thy word [Applause] mary you remember mary wasn't called snapping never knew what to expect this is what they were hearing a virgin shall conceive 400 years mary knew it had to happen so when the angel came to her she shocked oh god he's an angel no hail mary that one highly favored blessed are the among women blessed is thy womb i come to bring you a news oh god you're going to have a massage child oh it's not right isn't that what i said be it done unto me according to thy word never only had one question it wasn't a doubt it was a question how shall these things be seen i know not a man when the angel had the answer he said the holy ghost he said the holy ghost he said the holy ghost he said dynamics he said the power going to come upon you and you are going to produce messiah well we have another mary here today this mary is the bride i want to tell it's the holy ghost the holy ghost gonna come upon you and all these seeds all these words of the son of man are gonna be manifested in your life don't you ever doubt anymore don't you question anymore don't you be a doubt in your spirit anymore you are going to be filled with the holy ghost on fire god has promised that he will keep his word god is not a man that would lie oh give the lord some praises inside of him god is not a man that would lie [Applause] was the son of god amen amen amen and when he came out speaking in the wilderness you know what he was saying it's written it's written it's a different song it's written the devil couldn't touch him this was written son he could find where it is written he could find his scriptures he from 12-30 he was in the word studying to be reflect the word he was the word itself he was reflecting what we must become we are the final scripture you have to have a passion a zeal an enthusiasm to find your position to find your scripture to find your word amen moses seen the victory he had focus himself though being a prince no heir to the throne of egypt he focus himself listen away from the lust of the world he focused himself away from the beauty and power he had with his own wisdom he had within his own potential to receive something you can make money here make money here achieve this here at what cost at what price sometimes it just isn't worth it we have to learn the sin no your time is too precious you have to say no to people who waste your time i know one executive user asked one of his partners how much time is saying no for the day every day ask them how much many times say no becoming more the better the more know you're saying the more i know you focus yes wow because everything come to this track you from your goals everything everything comes to distract you you want to do this this call this text this person said this this person wanted but this is what you want to do where am i going to shut down this and shut down that and shut down that you can't focus paul said i i pressed towards the mark of the high calling but he said forgetting the things that i passed because he passed a strap you into looking back what you miss what you lose but you're not seeing what you're going after but he took my press forward i press towards the mark i i lean forward i strive i give a push in your spirit i am not what i'm supposed to be so i'm striving i'm not perfect yet but i'm striving i'm not ready yet but i'm striving therefore i can't be tidy i can't be i'll just bail bow and under no i've got to press my way i feel tired yes but i shake it off praise god the snake bit me but i shake it off shake it off in the fire disaffect me but i shake it off i get this mind battle but i'm shaking it off because i've got to go where i'm supposed to go i've got to make it come on sam and somebody hallelujah oh glory glory glory so he focused that out until he's seen the blessed people by the promise of god by the promise of god but he focused in because he knowed what that god promised abraham he would be visit his people and he knew he was rather for that purpose so he focused it all out pharaoh did not have that potential he was offered it but he refused it and when you refuse that you can't focus a powerful statement you cannot accept the devil's word until he reject god's truth so before you go into rebellion mode you young people boy you break all your red lights because they don't listen to modern father that's the bible say honor your mother and father that your days might be long before you do all of that you have to go in rebellion mode where you don't want to hear god you don't want to hear reason you don't want to hear the word you don't want to hear those that go on in front of you that have experience that pain and burn on the stones and rock ahead because you haven't seen the rocks yet you prepare to go yourself because you really want to do your own thing you really want to do your own thing and you feel you know because you are young and you're strong as something that strong could work against you you end up strong will foolish strong will instead of surrendering your will to god and that's why you have to be able to surrender thy will be done thy will be done on earth as it's in heaven and the only way you can get a revelation of god's will is by getting his word because his word reveal his will so if you're not in the word you cannot even know the will of god [Music] come on now we're in this world this this this this this this morning and they'll come ourselves coming to teach a little bit that's what i'm doing here right now this morning i say it again you cannot know the will of god if you don't know the word of god not your dreams i know people holding on to dreams to fulfill their own dreams but because they believe god gave them the dream you see they don't want to say they dream because they eat too much a corn in the night they don't want to confess that they don't want to confess because there's some bad food some kind of some kind of pain some kind of thing that they get this kind of dream i get all kind of dreams do you think i take that one i have the word [Music] god never tell me study a dream or did you bring guidelines and pointers but i can't bother with that sometimes i tell us a grand dream again i know one man any time you're gonna dream you get in trouble he's just jump out of the dream and escape the trouble they're dreaming you're getting in trouble always said well do i stay in the dream get out and drink some coffee and go back and sleep so you gotta dream tired don't let no dream we are here to be led by the world come on give the lord a shout inside the funny one that you don't want to see that's why you don't want to say it because funny you would all know you're funny like why are you not saying it where's your dream is the dreamers of god bring it to human term him let the light flash let it be judged bring it forth where the lord show me something we need something i can't see the lord i'll show you nothing when abraham get the vision from god he said i'm gonna have a son god say who abraham his name is abraham he o holy name abraham means father of nations and he had no son and to testify god told me i have a son that's what god does confront the devil make people laugh at you hey he's part of nations and you have no evidence god loved that you know he put you in an embarrassing situation goddess do that set you up like that lay a walk down like a shame but god get in glory [Applause] [Music] david loose david on him yeah you said am i a boy i'm a dog why are you gonna bring that little boy to fight me david didn't come to fight him they will come to destroy him that's not the same thing david not in this wrestling business david come to finish him off come on see him and somebody come on you're welcome to fight this philistine you come to defeat destroy vanquish eliminate help me jesus glory glory oh give the lord a shout listen to show you how fearless paralyze people israel didn't move until they see the head rolling down the hill they're making sure goliath not even dead you know but head off they even trust her sleeping then trust a man lying with that size he did not trust in him when they saw his head cut off hey everybody we did it we did it hallelujah we win we win saul wanted somebody to fight the light david ford won the battle david has win victory so and then his sisters come up with a special saul cave one thousand difficult ten thousand after that sauce had a watch they were cookie eye he didn't like that kind of song he said he got pressure oh you talked about pressure going and come just now [Music] when the holy spirit start to pick up sons one by one when those eagles have to fly i ain't talking about asking permission to fly you know no no no evil don't ask permission to fly it's built into them it's built into flags it's built into soar nobody could keep you down when god put wings i feel i could fly hallelujah hallelujah how many people could fly this morning fly in the realm of the spirit fly above your trials fly above your bills fireball you don't know where the next meal coming from you're gonna fly of course you could fly [Applause] no man after he turned on the word of god can never focus himself into it because you refuse the word listen you refuse the word that brings you into relationship of christ you see if they get the relationship with christ you wouldn't bother with how brethren i can operate because your relationship is with christ and a lot of your hurts that you have had is your hoods that's your human spirit i don't want to burst that's not god's compassion because compassion is not feeling sorry for people brahms say compassion is the will of doing the will of god sorry for people that compassion you're sorry for that one and you're sorry for that one no compassion is doing the will of god so that's what you got to strive for to do god's will and said it this way give me your host wife give me a farmer give me a preacher give me any man that will put god first i will show you a man that is successful despite everything the devil can put in front of him i will say it again he said give me a man give me a farmer give me a preacher give me a housewife give me any person that will put god first i will show you somebody that is successful despite everything the devil could true at oh you should be shouting on that one you should be shouting that one because you should be warned to be that one that puts god first that's right how could you put god first when you're doing your own thing how could you put god first when you're not in the word how could you put first god first when you don't have a passion to know the will of god you know what jesus said i must be about my father's business my father's business to finish the work that means as far as prison was in the world when jesus went into the temple he didn't just read any scripture the bible said he found a place where it was written how could he find that if he wasn't in the word he wasn't the word he knew where to find it he knew when to find it he knew when to read it he know when to fulfill it that is what he was so on point he was so caught up with word and thought of god and expressing god's thoughts that when they say the heavens will pass away but my words could never pass that's how conscious he became of the power now mind you the prophets had that authority also when elijah cursed the church and the bears came after them because he said god had to honor them with his word because was the word of a prophet prophet is the more peace of god so they have to be careful what they say that curse was a curse a blessing was a blessing or when they released your blessing nobody could take that back when there is a curse nobody could take that back so when the prophet blesses you you are blessed come on same as somebody when that word is released from his mouth you have it that's when christ came along the mighty angel and seven thunders uttered the voices when that voice is uttered to you nobody could take that away from you oh glory and god show you who you are when god show you your sonship there's no devil to take that away satan is jealous this morning because he can't be who you are he can't get what you are proud to receive he has no inheritance in this kingdom oh hallelujah the kingdom is the word already in you and the kingdom is the word turning into power oh give the lord praise his people hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah oh glory to god his word is truth always the truth his believing children believe for it and cry for it until his word is vindicated his word is always his will and if you want to know what the will of god is find it in the bible once it's god's word it is will it's god's will for you to testify it's god will free to give him praise and glory i wouldn't all men hallelujah praise god amen praise god be in good health as your soul prosper it is god's will let your soul prosper is god will that you be in good health so you can accept sickness you can't accept diabetes stop it you can't accept diabetes and have ridicule all kind of diseases reject that always look for your healing and be hungry for your healing glory to god you're coming desperate nobody should come in your ordinary everybody should be coming here desperately [Applause] i saw some family backslidden some daughter in trouble some son some husband some wife some uncle some hand somebody that need a prayer you're coming church and you're coming you stand in the gap for them praise god hallelujah because god has to use your prayer my god you may see receive something but a terence said god give for the brand i'm the greatest weapon the power of prayer and god want to use your prayer but some of you don't you want to open your mouth because you don't even know the word to what to pray and that's why you have to be in the word that you could pray in the will of god you can pray in the purpose of god so in your prayer you're praying like an arrow you're shooting it straight at the target glory to god you're not generalizing lord bless me lord help me what is that hallelujah read paul prayer that should be filled with all the spirit of wisdom and the knowledge of the revelation of jesus christ specific will be seated when abraham god said i bless you and in blessing i'll bless you abraham said what you're gonna bless me with seen and go childless abram was specific he's always blessing all his tent and all this block and all his goat and i have no children what is that amen god said

never leave you i'll never forsake you before you reach your sick your hands anointed your faith is anointed the blood is all over you you anointed with god and the bible said they shall lay their hands upon the sick and they shall recover that's the word come on see him and somebody give the lord a shout on that that's the word they've got to be sick among us sick around us that we can lay

that diabetes that whatever condition whatever condition it's not me i'm the healer no man is any healer i am god and i heal at thee of all thy diseases come on court as a healer come on same as somebody hallelujah he made eyes he made kidneys oh god hallelujah he's the architect of our bodies he know where the spleen is you know where the kidney is you know where the heart is you know where the trouble is even what causing high blood pressure you know we're calling the low blood pressure you know what causing the high blood sugar he knew all about you and he has caught this morning he's the same yesterday today and forever oh hallelujah by his stripes you were healed oh hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah you see man was made to be independent but independent dependent on god not independent in himself but man could live independent of god and die as a man anybody could do that you could study education get a good job have a good cat get a husband or wife get married get some children and just live and die is that people do not every day all over the world not even christians having a wife doesn't make you a christian or husband or having another husband doesn't make another christian doesn't matter isn't that right but when you see what god has done and his purpose his divine will to restore man you think god wanted us to be in this condition this condition gave him an opportunity to reveal more of himself he wanted to be a healer but there was nobody sick he wanted their savior but there was nobody lost he wanted to be redeemer but nobody to redeem but with the fall brought goddess opportunity to display all his glorious attributes he was the diamond with all them fire in him with all the light in him with all the glory in him wanting to express it how could you know god that he couldn't disease if you have no kidney disease how could god heal this disease and that condition if there was not that condition how could god cast out devils as if no devils are cast out stop complaining all the devils study but god can cast it out come on same as somebody stop complaining about the blood issue on the female issue talk about the god i can heal your issue glory to god let's talk about that god this morning let's talk about him this morning let's not glorify the devil let's glorify god let's not talk about the devil talk about what god has done what the lord has done and what the lord is about to do not only has he done it but he's a potential great signs and wonders will be performed by this end time church i'm looking for it i'm expecting it glory to god i expect you to just get whole and dry up and die i am expecting to see a move of the spirit glory that caught i expect an old man to feel young again hallelujah you feel young again make you feel the shout make you feel the dance make you feel together make your future take a ball [Applause] oh hallelujah hallelujah glory you're gonna be seated you'll be seated listen to this i've been a week in the country staying with some friends and i was talking about love and there was a person said to me i believe you an antichrist he stole my love and somebody said i believe you are an antichrist and but abram said if that would be pleasing to my lord that's what i want to be now this is taking it to the next level this is not oh you could call me that you sinner this is not that i rebuke you full spirit in the name of jesus calling me unto christ though demon you alright listen to this praise god if that will be pleasing to my lord hallelujah that's what i want to be i want to be whatever he wants me to be i love him and if he should cast me into hell i will still love him if i go with the same spirit i have now you kind of look at me strange i've seen four or five of them young men young wives fine women i know them boys love their wives i said to them here's the way to test it if your wife before you were married say you before married life you've been dreaming you were married you really wasn't married but your dream you were and you woke up and went and talked it over with your girlfriend and said you know i dream we were married and we had children we're living happy and waiting for the come of the lord and everything else and this girl said to you you know i love another man better than i love you i would be happier with the other man could you from your heart love her well enough to say god bless and rest upon you my dear go with this other man amen amen that's serious stuff that is not skim milk you see you see how the immense light light light happens god this is serious stuff now check that each of you man or woman if your love is correct you would do that for you are interested in her welfare you see there are so many selfish people what come with their mothers i myself and i comment again so their stories i myself i what i want what i feel what i want they're selfish they don't give to those and it's strange things something open to me about selfishness selfish people get jealous because there's one all for themselves when they see somebody have more than them or better than them they get a fight and they can get more selfish to get what they have so god could hardly bless somebody that is selfish because he blessing us up right there the blessing is stopping us from because shuts down there when god finds somebody that could give he challenges things through them amen and the more they can give the more they get to give and god just using them because they come like a channel of god's love and presence god know if he dropped too much upon that selfish rascal that rascal will keep it for themselves it goes nowhere so god would like to get people that could he could flow through there is my spirit flowing freely there is my life there is my love flowing there is my grace flowing there is my power flowing because christianity is not living for yourself is living for others come and give the lord a shout that's what he's telling ideas you don't come here for you you coming for somebody else it makes life worth living oh hallelujah tried to testify a joy to invite somebody at the service a joy to witness about his love amen not complain about your husband and the others who have none complain about your wife and some might have none yeah complain about your children some don't have any you're claiming about your shoes your shoes not up to date and some people have no shoes they're wearing slippers complain about this you can play only complain complaining and complaining and weakness your face every time you always complain always have a complaint always no praises no thanksgiving you complain about this you're complaining about that you have a complete anointing and god had to complain about you they always complaining hear them hear them hear them with them boys say oh what god is able to deliver us so we're not complaining if he doesn't we still not complaining we're still not going down we're still not backsliding we choose for long i'm not backsliding because he should follow we're lying on the church so i'll have the backside you wanted about tonight you wanted the opportunity back tonight no they just closed down then yeah i mean nobody's going to church i mean make an excuse you know people do what they want to do if you want to sing you will sing you will sing to the top of your voice you'll sing with all your heart if you want to praise you will praise [Applause] if you want a hamburger you would drive to me i would get a hamburger if you want that hamburger i have the best rotis in tokyo you will go to 40 miles away and you love that woman you find yourself 40 miles down the road you're not studying transportation now you said you're coming back you're going because you're in love but that's all you have to be for jesus christ yes i know you're going back but you sure come here praise god to be filled with his power filled with the spirit touched by his grace touched by his mercy that's what you're coming for oh glory hallelujah so watch you know you could have her you can live with her she's your wife she will be she'll be marry you but she won't be happy she would be happy if you love her then you wanted to be happy therefore whatever the will of god is let god will be done whether i'm happy with it or not i want to live here we go so he will be pleased with what i do therefore check your objective and your motive by that and you know whether you love god or not oh hallelujah you love him this morning all right let's continue jesus said verily i said unto you this generation shall not pass away did all these things be fulfilled heavens will pass away but my words shall not pass away revelation 22 i testify under every man whether baron said that spree spoke bishop still prospered or whatever that here at the words of the prophecy of this book if any man shall add unto these things god shall add into him the plagues that are written in this book he said what about your dogma what about your unscriptural creeds you're listening to all the nomination there's not one excuse if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy god shall take away his part out of the book of life and out of the holy city brother branham do he be a preacher do he be a church member all his life though he be a bishop of a pope whosoever shall take one word that's one word do you realize it was one word that he doubted caused all this trouble one spoken word of god doubted caused every sickness every disease every hospital to be built every operation to be performed just one word mixing you've got to take the way god spoke it and won't mix with nothing jesus said if you have faith like a mustard seed a mustard seed don't mix is that kind of faith just one word isn't that right blessed be the name of the lord so watch and we went at you with that the seed started first and then slightly doubted and in syria and then he went on to mary so today confused about the evidence of the holy ghost satan can imprison any kind of gift of god but he cannot bring that word word by word that's where you feel in the garden of eden that's where you always feel and that's where the tape unfortunate ones they can be anointed with the spirit speak in tongues shall preach the gospel and still be a devil did you hear that church anointed and still be a devil but now the same thing is this if here we go if you are son of god and if i am a son of god or daughter of god we were in god at the beginning and when jesus became the fullness of the word then we were in him in german form when he was crucified he was crucified in his body when he rose from the dead we rose with him and since we recognize that we are now set in heavenly places in christ jesus because we are sons and daughters of god we are god's children we are attributes of god and when jesus became all the world that we were part of him there you are and there is no devil no powers can ever move it that's the typos of the soul no devil could move that no minister could move that no bishop no pope could take your name out of the lamb's book of life because you are the words of the book hallelujah that's why the book has to open because you are the words of the book come on say amen somebody you were gene torch in the back part of his mind but the words are taught expressed so the thought had to be spoken oh glory to god to come into a manifestation and god said my word shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish your purpose i shall vote to accomplish [Applause] oh hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah so i don't care how much you can preach how much you love this and love that's one of the oldness of the spirit you can't love with your body your love with your spirit that's one outlets of the spirit you can love and even love god and still not be right you can cast out devils and preach and do these things to not be right but in the beginning was the word the word was with god in the words god was god you see the word touching your very soul that's why jesus could go to the water well and see what's what's in her soul the world sees she was a prostitute she was living with this man and that man but jesus saw beyond all of that and saw the seed in that woman and the word went to call the word the word when they called it thought the word went to call the attribute [Applause] hallelujah so when the mighty angel came down he had to have a man on the earth that he could step into to speak the word that adam was supposed to speak because adam was supposed to make and multiply and get back more sons and daughters of god but because adam fell we had to go back to a whole cycle and now don't come the book the mighty angel one with the sweat black wings one with the seventh seal seven thunders or tiny voices to bring back sons go to the angel and take the book eat the book and prophesy you gotta have a passion to know the word a passion for that book give me the book [Applause] hallelujah oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to god hallelujah praise god hallelujah hallelujah they are some denominational churches that are ultimate to their believers this is my church this is my church this is my church they love their church the catholics love their priests love the nuns love rome love pope francis that is their pope but to me under the ones that i hope i'm leading the christ and by christ the bible is our ultimate let every man words be alive and they might be true no wait we talk about some of our church baptist churches but they're spending church jesus all right the first time the word church was used was when he said upon this rock i will build my church it was upon spiritual revelation of who of jesus christ not on some men not of some group it's the revelation of jesus christ [Applause] bringing us into the knowledge of the son of god yes you know jesus pushed money hallelujah if you want to read it and record the scripture revelation one one two three the bible is the revelation of jesus christ now we come down to something the bible is what the bible is what so the bible is not just a history book a book of laws and ethics and behavior and whatever these are people not even christians are being very nice nice behave respectful humble and witness praise god but the bible is the revelation of jesus christ not on some group not some bishop not some pope a revelation of jesus christ isn't that right so the bible is the complete revelation of jesus christ wrote by the prophets elijah all that they were in him all that you are all that i am is in him words witnesses of the word so it's not a book of systems moral ethics neither is it a history book or book or theology it is not it's the revelation of jesus christ god himself revealed from word to flesh that's why i said and the word became flesh and dwelt among us this thought this word this expression actually become flesh that we could handle it because he touched me who touched me the word made flesh oh hallelujah isn't that right god here we go god himself revealed from word to flesh that's what it is the bible is the word and god is the flesh and the god is the word rather and jesus being the flesh is the revelation how god was manifested in human flesh and revealed to us and why he became the son of god he's part of god the body is part of the son isn't that right so let's go to the history it was written by 40 different writers 40 men wrote the bible over a space of 600 years apart at different times predicting the most important events that ever happened in world history and no author but himself watch and there is not one error in the entire 66 books no order but god himself could be so accurate not one word contradicts the other these men wasn't the same age some most times and they have not contradicted each other that's the book we have called the bible going to find out that it's god in print form that book is god in print god in print devil hates that book and in that book two books he especially hate genesis in revelation because genesis is his beginning and revelation is his ending oh hallelujah praise the name of the lord praise gosh abraham says now watch watch luther was the feet pentecostal the tongues lips no is the eyes prophetic look at that luther was feet pentecostal was known by what speaking in tongues and then after the tongues is what the eyes that's prophetic malachi 4. now watch there is nothing else left here to come but himself to step into that the next is the intelligence so after the i is intelligence and we have no intelligence of our own we have no sight of our own he says then is the complete body of christ being revealed in the form of a bride that's taken out of his sign so when god was saying i'll restore he was restoring the bright body that christ would come and connect with it as the head that is the invisible union of the bride connecting to christ then you're going to see the visible union of the bride but you have to be an invisible union where you connected to god by the holy ghost hallelujah nobody in the world know where you're at because you are in the body you are not even in trinidad amen you're not capsule all by yourself you're in a body the body of christ so you walking but you're in a different world hallelujah and that's how jesus communicated when herod said you know i could do something for you he said no no no if my kingdom was in this world i could send for help i could call angels to help me you you can't help me this you don't even know what going on inside of here my father put you there amen hallelujah the picture was bigger than that you know was jesus in a different room altogether you see the problem is we are living in past present future and god altered that you can remember the past you're in the present you could think about the future we're going to happen and you're worried and it can soon and your heart stress out and whatnot but god is above all of that your past presence and future is present to him to him there's no past presence and future that's why he could declare the end from the beginning you have to wait for the end he could come at the beginning and declare your end come on now he's seen it straight [Applause] you worried about next week and he already know what next week amen if i could go up in the realm and go next week and bring it back for you you will see what god see already for you next week next week we'll be fine [Applause] before we know all things work together for good the damn that love god to them who are they called according to purpose says they wake up next week and there's a lion in the street and you can't go out to work you know all things work together feel good stay inside the house and pray come on get the lord and shout the praise all things work

home with a baby then kill not mine i have to do something different amen and i'm telling you if you want to die like the others stay how you are but if you want to live you better do something

child that's why your life has been how it is that's why god could tell things are wrong in your life that's why when people give up on you god and give up on you the devil himself gave up on you and god didn't give up on you when people thought he was gonna stay down you stand up oh when people thought they were going to shut up you spoke come on same as somebody that's faith that's faith by

believe the bible is a seed and those words are seeds and it is god in print form and you receive it into your heart and david said thy word have i hid in my heart that i might not sin against thee you could take the word and hide it and the devil can't touch it because the word is a designer of the thoughts and intents of the heart the devil cannot discern your heart he can mess with your head but he can't mess with your heart [Applause] see when you have it in your heart the devil can't get it you're under cover you're like a secret agent inside of there oh hallelujah thy word is in thy heart and it's in thy mouth oh a word of power a word a blessing a word of peace inside your heart that's why you ought to be careful what you see it was so powerful that jesus said if you shall say to this mountain and be move and don't talk in your heart you could have what you say sons of god walking with such a powerful word that if they speak it it could materialize if it comes from their heart anything you ask in my name i will do it that the father may be glorified in the sun we are coming into that sin john 14 20 at that that you shall know i am in the father you and me and i and

need power to go back home [Applause] some of you're not saying amen your home must be fine but if you're homeless under attack then the devil own your home hi jesus gonna be under attack that's the devil's job sit out there and shoot arrows shoot missiles shoot every bomb he could take praise and we have been in defense mode putting up barriers putting up this putting up this but i want to change the movement amen attack mode [Applause] get out of here we have the thought we have the word we will speak hallelujah that's what jesus did cast out devils that's right kill the secret hallelujah overcome the devil but it's written it's written to prove you don't even need power to overcome the devil but you need to be in the word to know it is written that's right when the devil says come this side here come let me show you something no go and shoot somebody else i'm not available hallelujah sign me off take me off your list come on delete my contact list delete me all your

let the devil fool you [Applause] your past don't determine your future god does give the lord a shout on that one [Applause] what do you say about over look at saul circus all in a new testament he was killing christians he was persecuting christians he was against the church but god had a purpose for life so god didn't take his passes ain't no paul so your soul and now you're doomed finish church never gonna say that until the lord pillar fire knocks all of his horse who adolph he knows the lord because i call you to be a witness gentiles will you say not me lord god then i do oh god i repress persecuted oh church they're gonna hear me they go here paul paul come out so boldly save anybody think himself to be a spiritual prophet let him acknowledge what i write is the commandments of god if you be spiritual i'm talking about when a man meet god the past look look moses moses here intellectually from his parents his speciality special calling protection and whatnot move this trial thing kill one man on a run i mean run out now just run you know run straight out take a 40 years holiday whoa when he met god and he went back that man is fearless enough [Applause] that might have nothing to do with a man print it over again let him recycle that the news 40 years ago moses killed a man and tried to break moses esteem so moses hit egypt newspaper print moses on the front page looking 40 years younger wanted you could shoot that in moses face whatever pushes us what kingdom are you from the kingdom of the most high god amen he has nothing to do with that his past don't determine his future you see the man killed him and can't talk for god as foolishness when god called a man nobody could change what god arranged for that man i don't care what that man has been through i don't care what that man i've done i don't care where that man i've built when caught on the purpose of that man life nothing going to stop the purpose of god [Applause] the bible is a perfect book if it wasn't they never talk about david adultery they never talk about noah drinking they never talk about all the sins of the brothers in the bible because the bible is a perfect book it have truth in it if they all have sinned and come short of the glory not some but all there is none righteous no not one the bible teaches that so we are all free this morning i can't finish this today it's too much i'm going to come out hallelujah [Music] to the smartest theologian he could hide himself set right there in the scripture and you can look all day long and never see it look for a lifetime and never see it he can hide himself there god in the world can find himself showing the word that there's not a theologian in the school could find him yet he is sitting right there you say is that right brother branham how about the pharah season style you see how about every age he's done it he's done it in every age noah smart intellectual age how he hid himself in his promised word did his moses heal himself and does elijah hid himself he said he came on his own he's going to receive him not so walker sit in his word waiting for the believer to open it waiting for the believer to to reveal it to him if you don't go oh he can reveal himself to you when god waiting for you to park the bible practice spoken word book begin to get into it and study and pray and the words of the jump up whoa then it brings stimulation of revelation then that brings prevailing power upon your life so all is weak and you're struggling and you do not make it all of a sudden you get prevailing power because god began to reveal himself to you right out of the world because you're showing you have a passion to know the word of god you're interested in the will of god you want to be about your father's business you don't just want to be hanging in church you want that breakthrough he hides himself from the smartest you say well this is dr father's holy so and so i don't care who he is god hides himself from him and revealed a babe starters will learn the babies of god is predestinated seed so think think the mighty god setting in his own word blinding the smart educated people of this present age and they think is a bunch of fanaticism and look at him there standing hiding the pentecostal baptist matter this reveal himself publication all kind of signs and so forth you said brother jones brother so and so he's a great man he will see it oh no he revealed to whomsoever he will or this brother yes in the message he all in the message but sometimes the old one does get like that guy with samuel day dim sighted ending not seeing right somebody is red blind they're so long they get blind they say oh they get numb they get kind of you know all right kind of dirty kind of old where they don't know what they're supposed to know but god revealed it to whom severe will so you can't say guacare to that sister or that brother you can't say quack this one because this happened no no to whomsoever he will oh musician come on please i think i know have up here god is known by simplicity and of revelation of jesus christ to the most illiterate person not your theology it's a revelation of jesus christ upon this rock i've been my church no other rocks accepted no other things accepted no other roman rock nor the protestant rock nor the school nor than nothing but exactly the revelation of jesus christ through the new birth he is born in there and he injects his own life and your life is gone and the life of christ is projecting itself through you showing the preeminences to the people and the prophet said this the ministry comes to perfection when christ is manifested in nature we're not talking about a sermon we're not talking about what you could write down as a note we're not talking about what you're saying never see it that way we're not talking about that we're talking about christ is reproduced in natural that means the word amen has become flesh by lack of this revelation of what of jesus christ is why we have so much different divisions not revelations causing divisions but the lack of revelation is why we have so many different divisions among us so much mockery so much division is because the people lack that revelation they lack the revelation the teachers who like it the teachers lack the revelation because if the teachers had the revelation they will point the people to jesus christ and not to themselves or their groups or their church hallelujah that's why so bless the preacher in india the savinity of the local church timothy 3 16 all scripture is given by inspiration of god and is profitable for doctrine reproof correction and instruction and righteousness that the man of god may stand perfect thoroughly furnished in our good works amen all scripture is given by inspiration god is a person amen are you ready yes yes god can speak god can talk god can write amen god wrote with his finger the ten commandments isn't that right god can talk he talked to moses on the mount in a burning bush he talked to john in the form of a dove this is my beloved son whom i'm pleased to dwell in he spoke to jesus on transfiguration he spoke to jesus before whole multitude so watch he said on the writing that not one jot or tittle shall ever pass away until it's fulfilled until it's manifested then it'll come to pass now a title means a small mark in other words not one punctuation one expression shall ever fail in the word of god because it's god god manifested in the form of human flesh they only interpret the prophets as god would permit them to interpret amen and if you want first peter 20 this is of no private interpretation so nobody not supposed to say i think it mean this the prophets alone have the qualification to interpret the word not a pastor not a preacher the prophet alone has the authority to interpret the scripture the preachers have to come under the prophet and say what the prophet says because the prophet spoke for god [Applause] so the man of god the prophet gets the thoughts of god speak the word of god for the entire age so if he is the toast he is that word is for the thousand years the prophet may die whatever times he died but the word still remains so the bible said version 10 7 in the days of the voice but abram is not here but the voice is still here we are still living in the tales of the voice it's the voice of god in the last days but the pride will be the voice of god but the prophet and the pride in the spirit will be saying the same thing and what they say has already been said in the word so there is no mistake about it there is no argument with it god word can't lie if god said he will heal you he will heal you if god said he will fill you he will fill you don't do like sarah and slightly don't believe god with all your heart oh hallelujah go glory to god just a little more prophets did not always understand what they were writing or what they were saying or they would know wise i've said it they couldn't they could understand it they were moved by the holy ghost moved by the holy ghost holy men moved by the holy ghost so when isaiah said a verse you shall conceive if he was thinking the truth he never write it because that's impossible but he had to write it hallelujah because court said it in other words once god speak it it's got to come to pass there will be a revival in trinidad there will be a prize revival once there's a pride in trinidad there's a pride revival in trinidad and seven thunders will be the pride revival in trinidad and around the world god said so seven thousand faith god said so that's the pride revival god said soul you're gonna have dynamics in the mechanics god said so you'll get back your joy god said so they will get you inheritance god said so hallelujah hallelujah but you've got to know what god said yes hallelujah glory so the prophet writer the prophet writer must be constant foolish by the author he must live constantly in the presence of the altar to know what the book is going to be so these men were not intellectual men these are men that was inspired oh elijah he wasn't much to look at when he come down that dusty road but he had dust here the lord his bald head gleaming at midday noon but when he stood there and seen that even jew or rain will fall till i called for it my calling and prophet come people tremble because they know god was coming they know the word was coming they know thunder and lightning was coming because that was on the mountain and god said don't let the god speak let moses speak isn't that right of course i'm going to lose prophecy bring the word to them amen oh hallelujah and we have a 20th century prophet my god how would you like to live back there with elijah oh with jeremiah or with ezekiel and these men come out of nowhere stomp down into a village and prophesied god could write there was writing on the wall hallelujah time up thank you jesus amen you're found in a balance of wanting man rejoicing king clanging and drinking and whatnot and he didn't know it was finished oh hallelujah god could write god could speak amen that's right god is the word so god knows exactly what he said in his word he know exactly what could be in the last days you know the spirit of men and lusts of power he not agreed that gonna be the last days he know the authority listen we have this all along dictators naturally yeah precedent for life prime minister for life conquering people for years they can't conquer their servant country god will not allow that god took jesus the example seats and the first thing god did is the ceremony willingness not selling to get a banner and we even like the pope francis and everybody we even had pope francis no he went into the wilderness to become the devil amen then he went into the scriptures to find where it's written because he was the written son that was mary had a son come on it's written and then he begins his ministry looking to fulfill scripture and needs pastor samaria fulfill scripture his life was fulfilling scripture oh hallelujah so that's why the prophet had his mind set constantly in what god said not what man thought what the age taught what the church taught what the kingdom taught what god taught he only expressed god thoughts to words because our words are taught when he's expressed oh blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah praise god all other words i don't care where they are placed how who they come from what denomination they come from how smart the man is is to be absolutely ignored so we don't hear the pre-time magazine music magazine and what in newspaper we're not here for that we had to preach the word of god because paul said though we are an angel of heaven preach anything let him be a christ in other words listen to the prophet voice now if an angel come down from heaven a bright shining angel would stand he said boy that would be a bit for this day wounded a bright shining angel come here and stand and say things with conjuring wood you say satan get away from me only don't say it do you want to see the bright shining ninja [Music] i don't want your shiny news i just want to know what you say if he's sick and dread to the wood tell him go back where you come from get behind me satan because this message is on the word is that bright and shiny is the word are you with me okay so if he's a bishop whatever he is don't you never believe him if he doesn't speak exactly with the word with the bible watch him he will carry with the bible now he will carry to a certain place and then hook it right there and when the bible is saying something and he bypasses that watch him right there oh hallelujah praise his wonderful name oh glory to god hallelujah oh glory to god praise his holy name thank you lord jesus hallelujah give him from praise these people hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord glory to god amen hallelujah probably how will we know the messiah the people that believe in him there's a feast of the trumpets unless they are constantly in the wood to know what he is so you can't just be going wrong with church you have to be constantly in the word to know the messiah is unfolding himself oh blessed be the name of the lord praise this wonderful name blessed be the name of the lord praise god hallelujah glory hallelujah god can't change hallelujah praise his wonderful name so if thomas i'm finished with this quote if she just stayed right and said god said so that's separate god said so she didn't want to do that see she changed the focus of a glass i begin to see instead of in one way they become two ways maybe this man could be right maybe he is right we know god is right maybe he is right this is just more light on what god said this is a hidden mystery are they in mystery that not any word guys that hate mystery that is satan hiding under his mystery any mystery a man bringing and revealing have to be in the word but christ is the mystery of god revealed so a lot of people's taking it saying a lot of stuff a lot of strong stuff and deep stuff and whatnot i'd have woman everything what itching is want to hear a lot of stuff new stuff but at the end of the day you have to see jesus do you love him this morning let's all stand and worship the lord praise the name of the lord joshua oh hallelujah hallelujah praise the lord god bless you oh hallelujah blessed be your name how many appreciate over this this morning oh
