[44:38] and causes to approach unto thee
[44:42] that he may dwell in thy courts
[44:44] we shall be satisfied with the goodness
[44:47] of thy house
[44:48] even
[44:49] of thy holy temple
[44:51] but let's pray one more time father i
[44:53] thank you to be here this morning and
[44:55] for these scriptures
[44:56] it's awesome these scriptures and i pray
[44:59] you would give context inspiration
[45:01] revelation i don't even know how to
[45:03] bring this out but may you just take all
[45:05] the words and just fit it together and
[45:07] edify and strengthen and build up your
[45:09] people and jesus might ask it amen and
[45:11] amen you will be seated oh praise god
[45:16] so this scripture means a lot to me and
[45:18] um
[45:19] i just want to bring back some things
[45:20] from the
[45:21] first just before we get into it from
[45:23] the prime meeting
[45:25] um on friday
[45:26] and the title was revisiting the altar
[45:28] of incense
[45:30] and we read from psalm 65 also psalms
[45:33] 141
[45:34] and i read from matthew 5 just want to
[45:36] read that back quickly and jesus was
[45:39] talking about
[45:40] um you have heard in old time said in
[45:42] old time though shall not kill
[45:44] whomsoever shall kill shall be in danger
[45:46] of judgment but i say unto you that
[45:48] whosoever is angry with his brother
[45:50] without a cause
[45:52] shall be in danger of the judgment
[45:55] now this is back to the bible now
[45:57] this is not in church and i believe the
[45:58] message this is the word now
[46:00] angry brother brother cause shall be
[46:02] danger of judgment and whosoever shall
[46:04] say to his brother raqqa shall be in
[46:06] danger of the consul and but whosoever
[46:08] shall say thou fool shall be danger of
[46:10] hell fire
[46:11] therefore if thou bring thy gift to the
[46:14] altar and there remembers that thy
[46:16] brother had ought against thee leave
[46:19] dear thy gift before the altar and go
[46:22] thy way first be reconciled to thy
[46:24] brother and then come and offer thy gift
[46:28] and this is the amplified
[46:31] okay he said i say unto you that
[46:34] everyone who continues to be angry
[46:36] continues to be angry remember hear me
[46:38] talk about people renewing the anger
[46:40] renewing like is a driver's permit or
[46:42] some kind of thing like that or the bank
[46:44] they're renewing every year right watch
[46:46] i said to you that everyone who
[46:47] continued continues to be angry with his
[46:49] brother or harbors malice enmity of
[46:53] heart against him shall be liable and
[46:56] unable to escape the punishment imposed
[46:58] by the court and whosoever speaks speaks
[47:01] contemptuously and insultingly to his
[47:04] brother shall be liable to and unable to
[47:07] escape the punishment imposed by the
[47:09] sahedrin and whosoever say you curse
[47:11] fool you empty-headed idiot shall be
[47:14] liable to and unable to escape the hell
[47:17] of fire so if you are offering your gift
[47:20] at the altar you dare remember that your
[47:23] brother has any grievance against you
[47:26] leave your gift at the altar go first
[47:28] make peace with your brother then come
[47:30] back and present the gift
[47:32] so now we're talking about a god now
[47:35] not going to church a lot of people go
[47:37] to church but they're not studying who
[47:39] they're going to meet
[47:40] and god is the god of the word not your
[47:42] feeling no but god is the word now so
[47:44] you say if you want to receive you want
[47:46] me to receive your gift or your prayer
[47:49] or your request do what is right and
[47:52] when you do what is right to come back
[47:53] surely i'll receive what you offer up oh
[47:56] praise god isn't that something else
[47:58] isn't that what elijah did
[48:00] he said lord all this i do according to
[48:03] your name and on will father let the
[48:05] firefall and fire came and consumed the
[48:06] rocks consume everything because he did
[48:08] it according to god's will god couldn't
[48:10] deny him oh blessed be name of the lord
[48:13] so first just sell summary and let we go
[48:15] and continue you come to the brass altar
[48:17] that's the place
[48:19] and then that's the first place the
[48:21] brass altar that's the altar where the
[48:23] sacrifice is laid but we're trying to
[48:25] get to the altar of incense because the
[48:27] old of incense is where genuine prayer
[48:30] is offered
[48:31] okay so watch the sacrifice is to be
[48:34] offered daily and god placed that breath
[48:36] that ought of incense just before the
[48:38] most holy place so you place it in a
[48:40] special place sacrifice is to be offered
[48:43] daily morning and evening daily lighting
[48:46] daily training of whips no not saying
[48:47] that just for words you know you have to
[48:49] see your life connected into this in a
[48:51] daily way
[48:53] daily prayer daily reading the books
[48:55] when you're doing something put on a
[48:57] tape so you just won't be idle doing
[48:58] something you're listening while you're
[49:00] doing praise be to jesus that's the key
[49:03] while you're doing something you have a
[49:04] tape playing there and you're you're
[49:06] being soaked into with the word and the
[49:08] devil have no room to give any old
[49:10] foolish thoughts oh praise god because
[49:12] you're always flying with this i'm
[49:14] flying with that he's the prince of the
[49:16] poor of the air so he on that wavelength
[49:18] to put thoughts into your mind praise
[49:20] god and the word of a wavelength to
[49:23] bring thoughts into your mind and if you
[49:24] have the thoughts of the word you will
[49:26] speak the word could somebody say amen
[49:29] so on the daily we have to die daily to
[49:31] have the altar of confession amen that
[49:33] is where we die daily isn't that right
[49:36] the brass altar praise god woe is me
[49:39] amen no confession no cleansing no
[49:42] cleansing no commission you must be
[49:43] washed by the washing of the water of
[49:45] the world first the brass altar where
[49:48] the sacrifice must be accepted and fire
[49:50] is the confirmation of the acceptance of
[49:53] the offering of the fire of the holy
[49:55] ghost so when god come down is that put
[49:57] an offering and walk away god always
[49:59] come down and confirm if the orphan is
[50:01] correct he send fire on it to confirm he
[50:04] have accepted your sacrifice and when
[50:06] you lay upon the brass altar and god
[50:08] accept your sacrifice fire break upon
[50:10] your soul holy ghost and fire it's not
[50:13] talk about much but you still have fire
[50:15] it's still a brass altar it still have a
[50:17] calvary experience it's another depth of
[50:19] self it have all of that but people
[50:21] praise god cuckoo in their mind looking
[50:23] for fresh revelation fresh torch
[50:25] itchiness oh glory to god hallelujah who
[50:29] started the fire first the first fire
[50:31] god himself started the fire and the
[50:33] other fire was lit from that fire but
[50:35] the fire came from god is not right the
[50:38] brass altar the lever to wash this and
[50:41] then the seven golden candlesticks are
[50:43] trim life partaking of the bread of the
[50:45] word then the altar of incense nothing
[50:47] to burn there no strange fire on the
[50:49] altar oh praise god just breaking into
[50:52] the inner veil where the glory never
[50:53] failed i feel so good coming here today
[50:56] because i feel
[50:57] praise god you're getting a great
[50:59] picture that is not church oh glory to
[51:02] god you're coming to him this morning
[51:04] the title of the message is the elected
[51:06] the bride the chosen one to approach the
[51:09] lord oh praise god let me say it again
[51:11] the elected the pride the chosen one to
[51:15] approach the lord and what scripture we
[51:17] read this morning blessed is the man
[51:20] whom thou chooses and causes to approach
[51:23] unto thee oh glory to god if if you ever
[51:26] invite oh hallelujah you know sometimes
[51:28] things going wrong and you didn't you
[51:29] didn't get to invite if you get to
[51:31] invite to cause you to approach god you
[51:34] should be the happiest person in tnt
[51:36] you get to invite you chosen and invited
[51:41] to be able to be in a position to
[51:44] approach god you know what we're talking
[51:46] about there's an approach in the past
[51:47] there's an approach in the church
[51:49] there's no on bishop there's not
[51:51] a person's own prophet this is
[51:52] approaching god himself oh give the lord
[51:55] some praises
[51:56] praise god you were blessed this morning
[51:59] bless for this invitation i like how it
[52:01] is worded hallelujah blessed is the man
[52:04] whom don't choose us or give the lord i
[52:07] shout
[52:08] many are called
[52:10] many accord give me give me scripture
[52:12] but few are chosen blessed is the man
[52:15] whom thou chooses and causes to approach
[52:18] the glory of god that means listen
[52:21] saints you have got to come to a place
[52:24] where you have to approach your god
[52:30] there is no escaping of it
[52:33] oh my hallelujah
[52:35] let's go let's go
[52:41] but the branham
[52:44] he's speaking i think this is some
[52:45] studying and church
[52:47] see
[52:49] i know the blasphemy of them would say
[52:50] they're jews and they're not but have
[52:52] the synagogue of satan
[52:55] church folks
[52:57] would call them synagogue of satan here
[52:59] is a voice that will be a considerable
[53:01] thought not only because it is most
[53:03] peculiar in its contents but is also
[53:06] virtually repeated in an age that is
[53:08] over a thousand years later
[53:10] revelation 2 9 i know that works and
[53:12] tribulation and poverty but are rich
[53:15] i know the blasphemy of them which say
[53:17] they are jews and are not but are of the
[53:19] synagogue of satan
[53:22] to begin with the word jews
[53:25] does not describe the religion of the
[53:27] jewish people
[53:29] it refers only to the people of judah
[53:32] and has the same precise meaning if i
[53:35] were to say i am irish born
[53:38] these people
[53:40] were saying
[53:41] that they were actually jews
[53:44] real jews by birth
[53:47] but they were liars
[53:49] they were not jews by birth
[53:52] and they weren't jews by religion
[53:54] if all this is true what were they
[53:57] they were deceived people
[54:00] who
[54:00] already part of the church
[54:03] they belong to the false vine
[54:05] remember the last week message
[54:07] praise god brother isaac be not deceived
[54:11] so these people call themselves jews and
[54:13] they were liars
[54:14] now listen to this
[54:16] they were not of the true church
[54:19] but of the false church because god said
[54:23] they were the synagogue of satan
[54:26] now the word for synagogue is not the
[54:28] same word as we use for church
[54:30] in the bible church means the callout
[54:32] ones
[54:33] or
[54:34] the summoned ones
[54:36] and here's where he slipped this end now
[54:38] the psalm is said about these elect
[54:41] people
[54:42] are you ready
[54:44] and you know what he quote after that
[54:46] blessed is the man
[54:48] whom thou chooses
[54:50] and causes to approach unto thee
[54:53] that he may dwell in thy courts
[54:55] psalm 65 4.
[54:58] so in other words when david was writing
[55:00] psalm 65 4 he was talking about you and
[55:03] i
[55:04] he was talking about the bride
[55:06] he was talking about the elected whom
[55:08] the lord chooses
[55:10] so you are not just drifting by chance
[55:13] and find yourself falling into this
[55:15] message no you have not chosen me jesus
[55:18] said but i have chosen you
[55:21] oh glory to god holly i'll not take you
[55:24] to bring forth fruit
[55:25] isn't that right
[55:27] so then he said about the meaning of
[55:28] synagogue is assembly or gathering this
[55:30] can be good or bad in this case it's bad
[55:33] for these
[55:35] were assembling is not of god but of
[55:38] their own selves
[55:40] isaiah said of them behold they shall
[55:42] surely gather together but not by me
[55:45] whosoever shall gather together against
[55:47] thee shall fall for thy sake
[55:50] isaiah 54 15 and since these were surely
[55:53] against the true vine god will only deal
[55:56] with them in destruction
[55:58] now why do we have a people
[56:00] mixed
[56:01] in the framework of the church and
[56:04] callings of jews
[56:05] the reason is this
[56:08] since they are liars
[56:10] they could make any claim they wish
[56:14] they could say
[56:15] what they wanted as though it were a
[56:17] fact
[56:18] and then stick to it
[56:20] in this case
[56:22] they could be lying
[56:24] with a very powerful thought in mind
[56:28] was it not so that the early church was
[56:30] almost if not entirely composed of jews
[56:33] making them original members of his body
[56:35] the 12 apostles were jews and later
[56:38] apostles were either jews or proselytes
[56:40] thus for men to swear they were jews
[56:42] would give them a preeminence
[56:45] and a claim to originality
[56:48] and listen to this bomb and we know this
[56:51] especially in america
[56:53] tell a lie
[56:55] stick to it
[56:57] never mind fact of history
[56:59] just say it and keep saying it to the
[57:00] people and soon the people will receive
[57:02] it
[57:05] i decided
[57:06] that america full allies troopers are
[57:08] ready to go there by knockers a
[57:10] microscope to find truth in america
[57:11] right now
[57:13] found to be very elected people they
[57:14] can't even get to know them all
[57:18] let me say it again
[57:20] tell a lie
[57:21] stick to it
[57:22] never mind a fact or history just say it
[57:25] keep saying it to the people and soon
[57:26] people will receive it did you cut
[57:28] something here
[57:29] isn't that the spirit right in the
[57:31] church today isn't there a group that
[57:33] claims to be original true church
[57:34] salvation is wrong in her don't they
[57:36] claim to have the keys of the kingdom
[57:38] that they receive from peter don't they
[57:40] claim that peter was the first pope that
[57:42] he resided in rome and there's
[57:44] absolutely no historical factor and even
[57:46] more most educated and knowing of heroes
[57:49] adherence believer lies satan's
[57:51] synagogue and if satan be your father
[57:53] he's the father of lies then it's not a
[57:55] strange thing that those synagogues are
[57:57] liars also oh blessed be the name of the
[58:00] lord blessed is the man whom thou
[58:03] chooses i hope this engrave in your
[58:05] heart and you know that you have been
[58:08] chosen oh glory to god when god was
[58:10] finished with saul he tells samuel i'll
[58:13] find a better man than that man oh glory
[58:15] to god i chose a king already go to the
[58:18] house at jesse and dear i will pick out
[58:21] one that i have chosen or give the lord
[58:24] a shout and god waited how much hundreds
[58:27] and thousands of years to find a people
[58:29] he could call for his namesake a gentile
[58:32] bride a gentile woman or give the lord a
[58:36] shout in the house he came unto his own
[58:38] his own receive him not that's the jews
[58:41] but as many as receive him to them give
[58:43] me power to become the sons of god who
[58:46] he for nearly called who we call it
[58:48] justified who is justified he has
[58:50] already glorified oh come on you gentile
[58:53] pride oh glory to god you come come come
[58:56] on you already let
[58:58] hallelujah
[59:00] you may be seated praise god amen
[59:03] notice the approach to god
[59:06] god
[59:07] has a way of approach
[59:09] you know if you're going to visit a king
[59:11] there's a way to approach a king
[59:13] there's a way to approach
[59:15] well
[59:16] he said now watch and there's a way to
[59:18] approach
[59:19] all things
[59:21] think that for a minute
[59:23] there's a way
[59:25] to approach
[59:27] all things
[59:28] normally we just see what we want to see
[59:30] do we want to do we wouldn't even pause
[59:33] to say is this the better approach
[59:35] could i have approached this differently
[59:39] i told my wife something you know
[59:41] discover you know somebody get offended
[59:43] because you get offended i mean you're
[59:44] right
[59:46] that's what people are doing you know i
[59:48] met your grandson let's talk about
[59:51] my feelings
[59:53] he's he's six years old
[59:55] i quit his feelings
[59:57] i think i didn't get a note at all
[59:58] because he could write notes
[1:00:04] when he write the note my wife asked him
[1:00:07] who the note for he said he heard his
[1:00:08] ideas
[1:00:10] he didn't commit to that note so now i
[1:00:12] get bad notes
[1:00:15] so what i'm saying is this because you
[1:00:17] get offended that means you're right i
[1:00:19] feel hurt yeah you're wrong
[1:00:23] people feel that hurt feelings make that
[1:00:25] right
[1:00:26] you didn't have to act so you didn't say
[1:00:27] it so you're gonna do it so i feel hurt
[1:00:29] hurt and you're going with your heart
[1:00:30] feeling is that right your hurt feelings
[1:00:33] your spirit are the breakup
[1:00:35] go out to wreck your human spirit
[1:00:39] [Applause]
[1:00:44] you'd rather see immensely true
[1:00:46] gentlemen
[1:00:46] [Music]
[1:00:48] i not begging for any man you know
[1:00:51] when you say amen you say lord i want
[1:00:52] that
[1:00:54] all right so watch there's approach to
[1:00:57] all things and that's why paul after
[1:01:00] paul runs through the gifts and people
[1:01:01] want gifts and tongues and whatnot he
[1:01:02] said behold i show you a more excellent
[1:01:04] way
[1:01:05] then he dropped do i speak with tongues
[1:01:07] of men and angels i have that charity do
[1:01:09] i get my body to be burned do i have all
[1:01:11] knowledge do i know on mysteries do i
[1:01:13] have all faith to move mountains without
[1:01:15] charity or nothing charity suffered long
[1:01:18] and is kind that not puffed up itself
[1:01:20] it's not easily provoked didn't get no
[1:01:22] evil rejoices nothing iniquity but we
[1:01:24] are read all things believe in all
[1:01:26] things hope in all things enjoy it all
[1:01:28] things charity never fail it will give
[1:01:30] the lord some praises oh glory to god
[1:01:33] and that's why i share with husband and
[1:01:35] wife is there a better way this has to
[1:01:37] be a better way there has to be an
[1:01:39] approach there's a right approach a
[1:01:41] wrong approach a better approach oh
[1:01:44] glory to god you want the best approach
[1:01:46] to get the results oh give the lord a
[1:01:48] shout we don't want to waste time we

[1:05:53] the internet yeah since we're in the
[1:05:55] bush

[1:06:18] there'll be a hunger in here that
[1:06:19] dividing them
[1:06:20] those ministers don't even know they
[1:06:22] only have be elected up to the human
[1:06:24] spirit
[1:06:25] they can't touch the seed in their soul
[1:06:28] and once the spirit began to move
[1:06:29] deceiving them god

[1:07:47] how things repeated right back again
[1:07:49] listen but i'm dramatizing who is this
[1:07:51] man what school did he come from what
[1:07:53] fellowship car does he have what group
[1:07:56] does he have when's coming this man and
[1:07:58] he as he comes today like he did then we
[1:08:00] will not have this man rule over us we
[1:08:03] will not have nobody tell us what to do
[1:08:07] this is the problem right here
[1:08:09] people don't want to be told
[1:08:11] what to do
[1:08:13] they don't want christ to be the lord of
[1:08:15] their lives by the word
[1:08:17] they want the lord when they want him as
[1:08:19] lord but they want their own thoughts
[1:08:20] too
[1:08:21] they want their own ideas see
[1:08:24] watch this here
[1:08:25] we are oneness
[1:08:27] we are trainers we are presbyterian we
[1:08:30] are this we don't have to put up with it
[1:08:32] but abraham said i know you don't but
[1:08:34] you'll either take the word or perish
[1:08:37] that's all
[1:08:38] there is no other way but that and that
[1:08:42] is what holds us together god's kingdom
[1:08:44] is not a kingdom of this it's not a
[1:08:46] kingdom it's another system of this
[1:08:48] world jesus said so my kingdom is not of
[1:08:52] this world
[1:08:53] he says we are like abraham ibrahim
[1:08:55] received the word anything was contrary
[1:08:57] to the word he called it as if it wasn't
[1:08:58] and any true born child of god receives
[1:09:01] god's word i don't care what anybody
[1:09:02] says but the system speaks against it
[1:09:04] the word is true
[1:09:06] here we go are you ready
[1:09:08] god
[1:09:09] is obligated to meet you
[1:09:12] on the basis of them promises
[1:09:17] [Applause]
[1:09:19] i want to this be engraved in your heart
[1:09:22] he said when you see the message the
[1:09:23] wrist is filling material i don't preach
[1:09:26] filler material much
[1:09:30] because filler material does take a lot
[1:09:31] of space
[1:09:34] you ever get a gift a big box like that
[1:09:36] and you fill a material and let us draw
[1:09:37] lighting inside there but to give it a
[1:09:39] small thing in the middle
[1:09:40] right first you had to undo the package
[1:09:42] you had to strip the thing around it the
[1:09:45] bow tie and everything else open the box
[1:09:47] then you'll pull all them things inside
[1:09:48] that you see all right it's filler
[1:09:49] material
[1:09:50] now you have to put that
[1:09:52] because the gift will make a big noise
[1:09:53] back the tongue down people lose that
[1:09:54] small thing
[1:09:55] but you put it in a big box with a small
[1:09:57] thing and you put filler material around
[1:09:59] it but the main thing is the main thing
[1:10:02] you ain't going to put this jaw and put
[1:10:04] this straw on top of your house and put
[1:10:05] it until this is the filament no you
[1:10:07] want the gift it could be a cologne it
[1:10:09] could be a broach it could be whatever a
[1:10:12] watch it could be anything but we want
[1:10:15] the main thing
[1:10:16] well the main thing is the main thing so
[1:10:18] we have to preach the main thing or give
[1:10:21] the lord some praises
[1:10:23] so i want you to know how god gonna meet
[1:10:24] you he says god is obligated to meet you
[1:10:28] on the basis of them promises so is
[1:10:30] there anybody asking what you're
[1:10:31] breaching up here said bro over the
[1:10:33] speech promises
[1:10:35] that's all i'm a promised preacher
[1:10:37] what god promised i preaching once i
[1:10:40] find it i've given it to you
[1:10:42] promise to the holy ghost promise a
[1:10:44] revival promise you will not be deceived
[1:10:46] promise you wisdom and knowledge
[1:10:48] understanding promise your power oh
[1:10:50] glory to god promise victory promise
[1:10:53] every place you put your foot is yours
[1:10:55] oh give me give the lord a shout promise
[1:10:57] to adopt you position replace you oh
[1:11:01] glory to god that's what he preaches out
[1:11:02] of here i'm not preaching about dr fauci
[1:11:05] i'm not preaching united nations i'm not
[1:11:07] talking about america about england our
[1:11:10] fans doing and what pope francis doing
[1:11:12] that is his business i want to find out
[1:11:14] what jesus is doing okay the lord i
[1:11:17] shout
[1:11:18] glory to god i imported but now the
[1:11:20] church is doing
[1:11:21] oh hallelujah we have enough promise to
[1:11:24] wrestle with
[1:11:25] oh glory to god wrestle with them
[1:11:27] promises fight up with that promises
[1:11:30] amen
[1:11:33] are you ready
[1:11:36] you see if we don't read this thing you
[1:11:37] wouldn't notice
[1:11:41] these are key things
[1:11:42] god is obligated to meet you on the
[1:11:44] basis of them promises
[1:11:45] outside of them promises he can't meet
[1:11:50] you
[1:11:51] because
[1:11:53] you don't cut yourself off from him
[1:11:56] that's the reason the world is falling
[1:11:58] apart
[1:11:59] that's when the message the world is
[1:12:00] falling apart
[1:12:02] so in other words you have to have a
[1:12:04] promise
[1:12:05] you must have a promise
[1:12:07] on the basis of that god could meet you
[1:12:10] when you could go to god and say god you
[1:12:12] promised a bright revival
[1:12:13] and i want what you promised
[1:12:16] god you promised me the holy ghost and i
[1:12:18] want what you promised god you promised
[1:12:21] a rain to come upon my life you promise
[1:12:24] i'll never leave you i'll never forsake
[1:12:26] you promise the angel of the lord and
[1:12:28] camp around those that fear him you you
[1:12:30] that is that a rock god with them
[1:12:32] promises and he is obligated to back up
[1:12:35] his promises because god can't lie
[1:12:39] oh give the lord a shout
[1:12:41] we aren't talking about miss and hit god
[1:12:44] can't lie
[1:12:45] hallelujah glory to god that's why when
[1:12:48] we prophesy hallelujah we can only
[1:12:50] prophesy according to revelation 10 8-11
[1:12:54] that is in the scriptures though must
[1:12:56] prophesy again and you could only
[1:12:58] prophesy from the book if you eat the
[1:13:01] book or give the lord a shout i can't
[1:13:03] prophesy what biden would do fighting on
[1:13:05] his own oh glory to god i ain't no
[1:13:08] prophet i could only prophesy from the
[1:13:10] book
[1:13:11] concerning the bride concerning the
[1:13:13] world according to the book
[1:13:16] [Applause]
[1:13:27] but
[1:13:28] when a man has become a son a son he
[1:13:31] approach his father he just walk up to
[1:13:32] his father say father i come to visit
[1:13:34] you or see you
[1:13:35] that's his approach now to a stranger
[1:13:37] there's another approach
[1:13:39] there's an approach to god for many
[1:13:41] different things now if i was going to
[1:13:43] my father i was living and i want to
[1:13:44] approach him on a financial matter it
[1:13:46] would be a little different from another
[1:13:48] kind of approach i want to tell him how
[1:13:50] much i thought of him and so forth it's
[1:13:51] approach you have to use to meet god and
[1:13:54] when a man's sin in the beginning the
[1:13:56] garden of eden he separated himself
[1:13:58] and severed himself from all approach to
[1:14:01] god his very lifeline he was separated
[1:14:04] from his maker with no way at all of
[1:14:06] seeing him again because his sin
[1:14:09] his unbelief in trust in god had
[1:14:12] separated him here we go
[1:14:15] there's only
[1:14:16] that's the only sin there is
[1:14:19] is your sin of unbelief
[1:14:21] unbelief is your sin
[1:14:24] and the only reason today we are not
[1:14:27] where we should be it's because of our
[1:14:30] unbelief
[1:14:31] that's it it's because the miracles and
[1:14:34] things isn't in the church as it should
[1:14:37] be is because of unbelief
[1:14:40] separating us
[1:14:42] so this is the word now
[1:14:44] see and because that poor man out there
[1:14:47] is a sinning and murder and stuff in our
[1:14:50] world today all kind of disastrous
[1:14:51] things happen is because of unbelief in
[1:14:53] god that's all if we believe this is two
[1:14:56] things you either believe or believe not
[1:14:58] if you do believe then the works of
[1:15:01] righteousness follow a believer and if
[1:15:03] you do not believe the works of
[1:15:05] unrighteousness follows only thing is
[1:15:08] lying stealing tough and so forth is
[1:15:10] attributes of unbelief and
[1:15:12] long-suffering patience goodness mercies
[1:15:14] and so forth are the attributes of
[1:15:16] belief in god
[1:15:18] or faith
[1:15:20] in god
[1:15:21] but when man was cutting off there was
[1:15:23] no way to approach his only lifeline
[1:15:26] everything was cut off he was left back
[1:15:28] to approach his maker so just polishing
[1:15:31] and joining a church
[1:15:33] and reading a whole lot
[1:15:35] and knowing a lot of books and orders
[1:15:37] and so forth doesn't mean you are
[1:15:39] converted
[1:15:41] because
[1:15:42] you have an intellectual mind and that
[1:15:44] makes you have a mental conception that
[1:15:47] there's a god somewhere still you're not
[1:15:49] a christian yet until
[1:15:51] you actually become
[1:15:53] a personal in contact with christ
[1:15:56] that
[1:15:57] changes your heart
[1:16:00] and nature
[1:16:02] not personal connection with christ and
[1:16:04] you're bringing your own revelations and
[1:16:06] there's different things no no no that
[1:16:07] changes your heart
[1:16:09] and
[1:16:10] nature
[1:16:11] then you become a child of god old
[1:16:13] things pass away and all things become
[1:16:15] new brother branham never changed this
[1:16:18] teaching mystery additional mystery new
[1:16:21] mystery further mystery he never changed
[1:16:24] that a life has to be changed you could
[1:16:26] pour mystery upon unconverted people
[1:16:29] there were just no mysteries but a life
[1:16:32] change you could put mystery on that too
[1:16:33] oh give the lord a shout what do you
[1:16:35] want glory to god look at your own life
[1:16:38] is it matching with the word then you
[1:16:40] need a transformation you need something
[1:16:42] to happen to you isn't that right but
[1:16:44] then keep pressing on because it will
[1:16:46] happen to you you have a personal
[1:16:48] appointment with the supernatural oh
[1:16:50] give the lord a shout blessed is the man
[1:16:54] whom god chooses
[1:16:56] glory to god
[1:16:57] to be invited into his presence
[1:17:00] hallelujah hallelujah glory to god
[1:17:05] jesus said no man can come to me except
[1:17:07] praise god my father draw him is not
[1:17:09] right hallelujah now the way that god
[1:17:12] made for adam to approach now watch adam
[1:17:14] made himself an approach he said i got a
[1:17:16] made god so he made a thick skin leave
[1:17:19] to cover with shame and god refused that
[1:17:21] approach so adam had his own inspiration
[1:17:23] do you know he said god said i have my
[1:17:25] dogs are coming i come and i come and i
[1:17:26] come in
[1:17:28] fake leave and all
[1:17:29] dressed up adam fully dressed he said he
[1:17:31] is he who are you looking so
[1:17:34] who told he was naked i didn't give you
[1:17:36] that revelation you had a holy veil over
[1:17:38] you all the time oh come home come here
[1:17:40] wrap up show like that
[1:17:41] are you tired like that he said
[1:17:45] you know this story
[1:17:46] god refused adam approach and then god
[1:17:48] went and made an approach for adam
[1:17:50] he made adam an approach to himself and
[1:17:52] by doing that he slayed some sheep or
[1:17:54] something get some skins through the
[1:17:56] blood brought the first approach of the
[1:17:58] world for without a shed in the blood
[1:18:00] there is no remission of sins
[1:18:02] so god provided an approach there for
[1:18:04] adam in the garden of eden that through
[1:18:06] the shedding of blood of the innocent to
[1:18:08] appropriate and approach him then adam
[1:18:11] could once more come to the shed blood
[1:18:12] of the lamb to approach that was in the
[1:18:15] very beginning the gardener eden it was
[1:18:17] required blood and through the blood you
[1:18:19] have an approach to god to the blood you
[1:18:21] have access to god it's not you doing
[1:18:23] this and you stop doing that that is you
[1:18:25] and a religious beat but through the
[1:18:27] blood you have nothing you do when you
[1:18:28] do is the blood of jesus that gives you
[1:18:31] direct access
[1:18:32] oh praise god isn't that right so when
[1:18:35] jesus said you must be born again and
[1:18:37] you know share some of my wife i said
[1:18:39] everything in life have a process
[1:18:42] there is nothing without a process you
[1:18:44] said i am going to get my driver's
[1:18:46] license
[1:18:47] you don't just go and walk and have a
[1:18:49] machine and put a coin and bring on your
[1:18:50] license you work with it it doesn't work
[1:18:52] so you have an exam to sit your people

[1:18:56] driving training then you have to go on
[1:18:58] exam to pass and then after you pass

[1:19:10] claim it in jesus name amen
[1:19:12] that's false thing

[1:19:17] but do you have the documents do you

[1:19:25] process you buy the house that is your
[1:19:26] host so everything in life i'm going to
[1:19:28] get a job how do you get a job this is
[1:19:30] what i said my job i come from a job it
[1:19:32] doesn't work so you have to apply for
[1:19:34] the job they have to invite you to get
[1:19:35] give your interview and you have to pass
[1:19:37] the interview and then they give you the
[1:19:38] test and whatnot then they get a
[1:19:39] probation and then you could get a
[1:19:42] confirmation and get the permanency
[1:19:44] on the job so everything has a process
[1:19:47] there is no escape from it i'm going to
[1:19:50] be a successful farmer but you have to
[1:19:52] plant you could cut grass whole week and
[1:19:54] say a farming no you need farming grass
[1:19:56] until you put the seed on the ground to
[1:19:58] sow something and have the patience to
[1:20:00] wait for it to come to maturity to bear
[1:20:02] fruit you have no fruit to get or give
[1:20:05] the lord a shout so buckle down and get
[1:20:08] ready get ready get ready to culture the
[1:20:10] process to culturally approach to be
[1:20:13] successful oh glory to god to be
[1:20:15] overcomer to be victorious whatever
[1:20:17] capacity you're in there is a process
[1:20:21] oh give the lord some praises
[1:20:23] a lot of people don't like the process a
[1:20:25] lot of people end up lazy slutful
[1:20:28] because they don't want the process yeah
[1:20:30] but some people say um they want to open
[1:20:32] their own business
[1:20:33] they want to work for nobody
[1:20:35] they say working with itself
[1:20:38] what they're really running from is
[1:20:39] discipline because before you go for
[1:20:42] yourself you have to know what you can
[1:20:44] do and i always say this before you can
[1:20:46] lead you have to learn to follow oh
[1:20:48] glory to god before you want others to
[1:20:50] work for you you should work for
[1:20:51] somebody else then you understand the
[1:20:53] discipline and what it takes to be in
[1:20:55] the channel down there on the floor down
[1:20:58] there oh give the lord a shout so when
[1:21:00] you know the world from the bottom up
[1:21:03] when you get to the top you know it from
[1:21:04] the bottom up oh give the lord a shout
[1:21:07] that's the problem with adam adam goes

[1:21:16] i'm gonna bring a seed and that baby
[1:21:18] gonna grow and jesus grew and grace and
[1:21:21] knowledge because adam didn't have the
[1:21:23] character formation come on same as
[1:21:25] somebody he was just forming the image
[1:21:27] and likeness of god but jesus learned
[1:21:30] obedience
[1:21:31] by the things that he suffered oh come
[1:21:33] on now same and somebody and that word

[1:22:30] to this being
[1:22:33] when it's completed
[1:22:35] not when it starts
[1:22:36] when it's completed

[1:24:58] to come into his courts
[1:25:00] to come into his house
[1:25:02] to come into his temple
[1:25:04] to come into his presence
[1:25:06] who is that the elected lady the bride
[1:25:10] she's the one to chosen to do there
[1:25:12] oh gloria they're gone
[1:25:14] so brother branham
[1:25:16] he's talking about
[1:25:18] you must be born again
[1:25:20] know the approach to this bit
[1:25:24] it's not just your muscle born again no
[1:25:26] the approach to this boot
[1:25:28] there is
[1:25:29] an approach to it
[1:25:32] and to be to approach this boot you have
[1:25:36] to go through a process
[1:25:41] just like anything that lives
[1:25:44] anything that lives again has got to die
[1:25:46] first
[1:25:47] you cannot keep your same spirit you
[1:25:50] cannot keep your same habits you cannot
[1:25:52] keep your same thoughts how many of you
[1:25:54] love your thoughts
[1:25:56] love your ways
[1:25:57] love how yes do things and say things
[1:25:59] praise god hallelujah that applies to me
[1:26:02] too you know
[1:26:09] i'm so glad i got a scripture that i
[1:26:11] share with you
[1:26:12] from permitting friday and i said back
[1:26:14] again because thinking about some
[1:26:16] intellectual idiots in my mind are going
[1:26:17] through that like that
[1:26:19] and
[1:26:20] and they come with my heart don't say
[1:26:22] that and i didn't know why
[1:26:24] i didn't call over you i'd ever even
[1:26:25] mind you know thinking about these
[1:26:27] people are so smart they're smart to
[1:26:28] like become stupid
[1:26:30] that kind of kind of
[1:26:32] you know
[1:26:34] but then i recognize that i can't see
[1:26:36] that
[1:26:38] especially with my brethren
[1:26:40] so
[1:26:41] so i asking god to help me with my own
[1:26:43] thoughts
[1:26:44] because you see if i take it too long i
[1:26:46] was because you know
[1:26:56] afterwards it does spill out
[1:26:58] you see so what you really want is god
[1:27:00] thoughts
[1:27:01] and you want to get the way god sees it
[1:27:05] see and when we begin to get that way
[1:27:08] then we get insensitive to how god
[1:27:11] thinks and feels
[1:27:13] about things
[1:27:15] you see so it's different from my own
[1:27:17] concept you see so it's a debt
[1:27:20] because i have to die i know tea of it
[1:27:23] i know what he's capable of
[1:27:25] see and god know what he's capable of to
[1:27:28] see so he said you gotta die
[1:27:30] you've got to die like he died you've
[1:27:32] got to die on on his altar
[1:27:34] abel did with islam you got to die with
[1:27:37] your lamb you got to die die to your own
[1:27:40] thinking he's hitting again so this new
[1:27:42] buddhist approach you want to get a
[1:27:43] breakthrough you want to go look what he
[1:27:45] said here he said when you want to say
[1:27:46] your one fate and virtue when you say i
[1:27:48] want to
[1:27:49] get closer to god
[1:27:51] what you are actually saying you want to
[1:27:53] grow in god
[1:27:55] say you want to grow in god god give
[1:27:56] your faith a revelation oh god draw me
[1:27:58] closer i want more of you he gave a vote
[1:28:00] to you
[1:28:01] oh god i want more of you you give your
[1:28:02] knowledge
[1:28:03] you're getting more of him you're
[1:28:04] walking towards him
[1:28:06] hallelujah until they go right up
[1:28:09] to where somebody mash
[1:28:12] your
[1:28:12] corn that's why you put barley cans
[1:28:14] underneath all the other virtues right
[1:28:16] and i said you see that one on top there
[1:28:17] you most troublesome somewhere else god
[1:28:19] always had evil people around me is that
[1:28:21] over the people at the back talking you
[1:28:23] do nothing and they come to do you oh my
[1:28:25] gosh spirits
[1:28:27] and sometimes they they hate you without
[1:28:30] a cause
[1:28:31] see no cause the only cause is no cause
[1:28:34] they don't even know why they don't like
[1:28:35] you and when they don't like it you like
[1:28:37] here it's not people when they when they
[1:28:38] turn over they turn over you know
[1:28:40] nothing you do you get them pumpkin you
[1:28:42] get them bananas you get them a basket
[1:28:44] of dish cherries berries it doesn't
[1:28:46] matter where you give them give them
[1:28:47] nothing i still don't like you take an
[1:28:48] egg you know they take it now but they
[1:28:50] still don't like you
[1:28:52] if you if you want to give them give
[1:28:53] them still praise god just give them
[1:28:55] give them some cold water keep things on
[1:28:57] top of the head be nice it doesn't
[1:28:59] matter they can't help it
[1:29:01] but the test is on you to forgive
[1:29:03] because forgiveness gives you access
[1:29:06] to where we want to go this morning
[1:29:08] oh glory to god blessed is the man whom
[1:29:10] now chooses the cause to come into his
[1:29:13] presence
[1:29:14] his presence is on top the seventh step
[1:29:16] glory to god right ready the uncommon
[1:29:19] meet the king
[1:29:20] oh glory to god you have to get up on
[1:29:22] the seventh step so sometimes your
[1:29:23] children get your problems and
[1:29:27] you wish there wasn't even your children
[1:29:29] you see all this problem selling but you
[1:29:31] see these problems within the heart
[1:29:33] you see and afterwards things becomes
[1:29:35] you know certainly all right let's
[1:29:36] continue now so jesus when he died he
[1:29:40] died till he was so dead that even his
[1:29:43] blood and water separated in his body
[1:29:45] his death was so tremendous the will of
[1:29:47] the nervous breakdown it shook it
[1:29:49] trembled until rocks fell off from the
[1:29:51] mountains what what could die like that
[1:29:53] no pope dying would do that no pastor
[1:29:55] dying would do that but when god in
[1:29:57] flesh died on the cross the earth had a
[1:29:59] nervous breakdown to know that the very
[1:30:02] spoken word of god rocks and dirt sticks
[1:30:05] and clubs trees hanging in the earth the
[1:30:07] stars the moon his very spoken word see
[1:30:10] their creator become flesh and sin
[1:30:13] poured upon him the wrath of god poured
[1:30:15] out upon him until the moon shot of his
[1:30:17] light the sun shot of his light the
[1:30:19] earth had never shaken breakdown would
[1:30:21] have the of pieces if it hadn't
[1:30:23] been the future of us and everything
[1:30:25] else and if in elements of the earth
[1:30:27] upon looking seeing what was taken place
[1:30:30] shook them to that condition what ought
[1:30:32] it to do me and you what ought our souls
[1:30:35] to do when we look and see what god did
[1:30:37] for us it was for you and me what ought
[1:30:40] to do for us continuing sin god forbid
[1:30:43] but to abstain from sin and die to sin
[1:30:46] don't you seen what sin has done sin
[1:30:48] killed him he took the penalty of sin
[1:30:51] that he might bring the righteousness of
[1:30:52] god to you and me so when the rations of
[1:30:55] god comes to us sin is dead in our
[1:30:58] mortal being yes to be born again you
[1:31:01] must go through the process of death and
[1:31:03] everything does you take a grain of corn
[1:31:06] if that corn ever expect to live again
[1:31:08] it's got to die first if the crane of
[1:31:10] wheat expects to live again it's totally
[1:31:12] impossible and all these modern
[1:31:14] creatures in the world out there you
[1:31:16] know what they're telling people god
[1:31:17] doesn't want to change you and make your
[1:31:18] difference you know god won't reveal who
[1:31:20] you always was
[1:31:22] that's a lie from the pet of hell that
[1:31:24] is lucifer himself talking
[1:31:26] no experience necessary jesus come and
[1:31:29] god god revealed it was always a son and
[1:31:31] always this year
[1:31:34] that he's saying as those who say and
[1:31:36] you are the holy ghost
[1:31:37] lying spirits still lights
[1:31:40] hallelujah you're not telling me you
[1:31:41] must be born again must tell you not to
[1:31:43] die just come and believe who you are
[1:31:45] and i'm the i and the bride b-r-i-d-e
[1:31:47] and annie i i in the bride
[1:31:50] that only a word that countries
[1:31:52] you're not sure it'd be bright you know
[1:31:54] you'll find how to get me by just now
[1:31:56] and by one spirit baptism to one body no
[1:31:58] minutes i could push you any brain no
[1:32:00] book could hold anybody you could you
[1:32:02] could balance a spoken book on your head
[1:32:03] and put one you could put seven books on
[1:32:05] your head
[1:32:08] you're not bright because you read books
[1:32:11] you're bright because you're part of
[1:32:12] that bright body
[1:32:13] oh my do you believe that
[1:32:16] praise god shall we talk about that now
[1:32:18] he said watch i'm going to say something
[1:32:20] national force put israel in homeland
[1:32:22] national force will put the church in
[1:32:24] the brooklyn churches but the power of
[1:32:26] god will put the people in the bride
[1:32:28] what
[1:32:29] say it again power of god
[1:32:32] the power of god will put the people in
[1:32:33] the bride what will put the people in
[1:32:35] right but you will put the people in the
[1:32:36] right no they are scripted for that the
[1:32:38] power of god the fightful will put the
[1:32:40] people in the bride
[1:32:41] no they don't have no fightful putting
[1:32:43] people in the bride it has the power of
[1:32:45] god to put the people in the pride could
[1:32:48] we say amen how many want to say amen to
[1:32:50] the power of god
[1:32:52] the power of god will put the people in
[1:32:53] the bride the world forces this way the
[1:32:55] world forces that way but god forces
[1:32:58] upward so we have to have an approach to
[1:33:00] the power of god we can't do like it
[1:33:02] doesn't exist we can't do like we don't
[1:33:04] want it because the promise in the last
[1:33:05] days another kind of church highly
[1:33:07] high-minded lovers of places more than
[1:33:09] lovers of god
[1:33:11] fierce incontinent despisers of those
[1:33:14] that are good have in the form of the
[1:33:16] godliness but denying what
[1:33:19] denying what
[1:33:21] denying what in the message denying the
[1:33:23] pogba they don't want no power they had
[1:33:25] the books they don't want to pour they
[1:33:26] had the tips they don't want to tell the
[1:33:28] power they are fine preachers
[1:33:31] oh glory to god the power is no longer
[1:33:32] necessary you see the power comes from
[1:33:35] god and people like false religion
[1:33:37] because man make it
[1:33:38] oh glory to god and man could maintain
[1:33:40] it he could maintain what he make
[1:33:42] oh glory to god but the power of god is
[1:33:44] different hallelujah that's why when
[1:33:46] elijah tell them fellas he said call
[1:33:48] upon all your god go first do all they
[1:33:50] want to do
[1:33:51] call let the god answer by fire then be

[1:58:22] to her and to charge her that she should
[1:58:25] go into the king
[1:58:26] to make supplications unto him and to
[1:58:29] make requests before him of the people
[1:58:31] and hatash came
[1:58:32] and told esther the words of mordecai
[1:58:35] again esther spake in the hashes and

[1:59:25] think it not with thyself that thou
[1:59:28] shall escape in the king's house more
[1:59:30] than all the jews
[1:59:31] if thou altogether
[1:59:33] whole is thy peace at this time then
[1:59:35] shall their enlargement and deliverance
[1:59:37] arise to the jews from another place but
[1:59:40] dog when thy father's house shall be
[1:59:41] destroyed and who know it whether thou
[1:59:44] come into the kingdom for such a time as
[1:59:46] this

[2:33:41] friday also will be a special service on
[2:33:43] the zoom link
[2:33:44] so you'll stay tuned for that as well
[2:33:47] so a week of expectations amen praise
[2:33:50] the name of the lord
[2:33:51] uh secondly uh maintenance team group
[2:33:54] six
[2:33:55] please meet with brother adrian joseph
[2:33:56] after the service uh he'll be heading
[2:33:59] the group
[2:34:00] this afternoon so so you you know the
[2:34:04] ones who
[2:34:05] in that group yeah i mean you just
[2:34:06] report
[2:34:07] amen and
[2:34:09] you just get the work done and so on
[2:34:11] next week for group two uh is who's got
[2:34:14] it to clean and that group will be
[2:34:16] headed by brother joel striker okay so
[2:34:19] just posting it forward
[2:34:21] thirdly we have a somewhat of an
[2:34:24] important announcement to make here
[2:34:26] uh and just something to note
[2:34:28] as a routine we would like to
[2:34:31] uh remind you
[2:34:33] and i suppose in a way reestablish
[2:34:36] um the washing of hands
[2:34:38] before entering the building okay um
[2:34:41] so we know that just recently we have
[2:34:44] the temperature check
[2:34:45] uh that was posted on the at the
[2:34:47] entrances uh which also has the hand
[2:34:50] sanitizer dispensers
[2:34:52] but what we want to do uh moving forward
[2:34:54] and i suppose as of next week and so on
[2:34:56] when we come into the building we want
[2:34:58] to reestablish the washing of hands
[2:35:01] and i believe it was early in the
[2:35:03] pandemic when they would have mentioned
[2:35:05] that it's a lot more effective
[2:35:08] to wash hands as opposed to the hand
[2:35:10] sanitizers even though it is a good
[2:35:12] measure but we want to just make doubly
[2:35:15] sure that uh persons coming into the
[2:35:17] building
[2:35:18] are cleansed well enough amen and uh we
[2:35:21] then all we can all fellowship
[2:35:23] in the grace of god and safety and so on
[2:35:25] amen so as we're still in a panoramic we
[2:35:28] want to put things in place to make sure
[2:35:30] that all the saints are safe when we
[2:35:32] come in he said you'll bless our going
[2:35:34] in and your blessing going out amen so
[2:35:37] we want to do all we can to make sure
[2:35:39] that uh that things go well smoothly so
[2:35:42] let's just reestablish that so as of
[2:35:43] next week i suppose when you come in
[2:35:45] don't forget to wash your hands when you
[2:35:47] come in just before you do the
[2:35:48] temperature check okay so the washing of
[2:35:50] hands temperature check and then you
[2:35:52] could do the hand sanitizer afterwards
[2:35:54] um and then you can come in to the
[2:35:56] building praise god and enjoy the
[2:35:58] presence of the lord with each other
[2:36:00] amen and as much as we can praise god so
[2:36:03] god bless you um i believe that will be
[2:36:05] all the announcements uh for today
[2:36:09] um as well okay so just to recap service
[2:36:13] continues on tuesday bible study uh
[2:36:15] wednesday live stream friday special
