Thank you for Anthony and God bless you church. We are grateful for each one of you here tonight. Let us bow our heads for a word of prayer. Heavenly Father, we thank you for this great privilege that we have that we could call upon your name in such a time as this. Lord, you knew that we would be in this digital age. You knew you'll be be the age of this connectivity and this internet and this church without walls breaking all barriers and boundaries. I could see how the prophecy could come forth. The Holy Spirit will go across the world overnight. There is nothing. There's no barrier. There's no hindrance. And tonight there's no hindrance to your spirit, to the faith, to whatever you want done, to impossibilities, what we call impossibilities become impossible. Father, may you come and work among us tonight. Work in every home, work in every heart, work in every life. And as we approach your word, may you bless it in Jesus name I ask it. Amen and amen. God bless you and welcome. I believe is in Matthew 17 verse 11 Jesus said Elias truly shall first come and restore all things. And he was talking about that Elijah spirit present future. Elias truly shall first come and restore all things. So William Brandon, brother Brandham, he came with that restoration anointing. That anointing to restore the hearts of return back to the feet of the fathers is an anointing to restore. And that is why we hit that scripture on Wednesday night where God said, "I will restore all the years that the locust and the caterpillar paw had eaten." Now the backdrop of that scripture is what we will read tonight from Joel chapter one. And in in this Joel chapter 1, God is talking about the wine is beheld, the corn, the field is is wasted. And we want to read from verse 10 to 14 of Joel chapter 1. If you have your Bibles and we're going to read Psalms 142 and see what the Lord will do from there. The title of tonight is cry unto the Lord. That's from the scripture itself we about to read. Joel chapter 1, reading from verse 10. God speaks. This is through the eyes of God. The field is wasted. The land mourneth. For the corn is wasted. The new wine is dried up. The oil languisheth. Be ashamed. Oh ye husband men. How old eve wine vine dressers for the wheat and for the valley because the harvest of the field perish. The vine is dried up. The fig tree languisheth. The pomegranate tree. The palm tree also the apple tree. Even all the trees of the field are withered. The reason because joy is withered away from the sons of men. Verse 13, he said, "Good yourselves and lament ye priests. How ye ministers of the altar, come lie all night in sackloord, ye ministers of my God. For the meat offering and the drink offering is withholden from the house of your God. Sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly, gather the elders and all the inhabitants of the land into the house of the Lord your God and cry unto the Lord. That's where I get this title from. And cry unto the Lord. And this is David in Psalms 142. David speaks in verse one. If you want to turn your Bible, say Psalms 142. He said, "I cried unto the Lord with my voice." Note, it's an expression of not you sending a prayer request, not you trying to get people to pray for you, but you with your own voice crying unto God. David was very specific. I cried unto the Lord with my voice. With my voice unto the Lord did I make my supplication. I poured out my complaint before him. I showed before him my trouble. When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, then thou kneest my path. So instead of getting depressed, frustrated, fed up, David is expressing to God his troubles. He is describing how he feel overwhelmed within himself and he is declaring things to God. Thou nearest my part in the way wherein I walked have the privilege laid us near for me. I looked on my right hand and beheld there was no man that would know me. Refuge failed me. No man cared for my soul. And this here paints a picture of somebody's looking for help, looking for a neighbor, looking for a prop, looking for some kind of comfort. And when David look around, he's recognized he's alone. No man cared for my soul. Verse 5, I cried unto thee, O Lord, I said. This is David, thou art my refuge. Look before, refuge failed me. But he said, I said, thou art my refuge and my portion in the land of the living. Attend unto my cry, for I am brought very low. Deliver me from my persecutors, for they are stronger than I. This is a honest confession. This is a very honest prayer. David continues in verse 7, "Bring my soul out of prison that I might praise thy name, not bring my soul out that I can do what I've been doing contrary or slack or whatever." He said, "Bring my soul out of prison that I may praise thy name. The righteous shall compass me about for thou shalt deal bountifully with me. Amen. What a scripture tonight. David crying out unto God. And sometimes it is sad but sometime it take distresses for us to cry out. We could be grunting and groaning but not really talking to God and crying onto God. But Aan prayed this prayer. He said, "God created my revival. Let me be the revival. Let each one of us be the revival. A revival in me. Now, tonight, you're in the right place in your home. You're in the right place to see what you need to do in your home. You don't need to come to church for this because he said no minister could bring a revival. The revival has to start in your home. So, this prayer is applicable to all of us. Let me be the revival. Let each one of us be the revival, the revival in me. Excuse me. Make me, Lord, to hunger. Make me to thirst. Create in me, Lord, that which is needed in me. Let me from this hour on be thine more consecrated servant, a better servant, more blessed of you, more able, more humbler, more kinder, more willing to work, more looking to the things that are positive, getting the things that are past and the negatives. Let me press towards the mark of the high calling of Christ. Amen. Tonight I want to challenge you. Become the change you want to see in others. Wives complain about husbands. Husband complain about wives. Parents complain about children. Children complain about parents. Vice versa. But just think tonight, could you become the change you want to see in others? You want to see your husband humble, but you are proud. You want to see your wife humble, but you are proud. Why not become humble? Just what you want to see, why not live out? You want people to smile with you. Why don't you smile with others? You want people to whatever you want, become that. Look what Paul said to Timothy in 1 Timothy 4:12. Timothy was a young man and you know youth have its pros and cons. And I was sharing with my son Gideon the challenge I had as a young minister dealing with older folks dealing with brethren who's older than me who are gray hair who may know more about me. But I had a calling upon my life and the challenge was how to deal with that how to manage that. But in 1 Timothy 4:12, Paul speaking, "Let no man despise thy youth, but here we go. Be thou an example of the believers in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity." So Paul give this young minister, young believer, young brother a view in order that no man despises youth. Somebody could say well young young but no when you become an example you become as we say the change you want to see in others. In other words you set yourself as a standard. Jesus even brought it in a deeper way. In Mark 5:16, he said, "Let your light not just shine, but so shine before men that they may see your good works." So the truth be told, Christians not supposed to have bad works. Christians not supposed to have a bad report. They're not supposed to write up Christians. They're lazy. They're slful. They work sloppy. That ought not to be a Christian testimony. That is not a Christian testimony. Actually, let your light so shine before men. And this is before men. It's not church men. It's not in your home church men. It's not your believers men or brethren men. Before men, all men that they may see what? Your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven. All right. Bring it. &gt;&gt; The cry unto the Lord is a earnest desperate call for help. We find out that when in time of this great distress, we almost we always talk about Ziglag when David uh lost his wives and they got in captivity and the men wanted to stone David and beat up David and David went and cry out unto God and ask God a question. Should I sit here and mope and depress? Should I have a depression party? Should I get everybody to be sympathized with me and say, "Oh, God, we fighting." We say, "Oh, Lord, look what happened." And all the negative talk and you know when you start this negative thing, you attract negative people. You get support in that negativity. David asks a question. The question was, "Should I pursue? Should I go and fight or should I let it just go?" And God told him, "Pursue." Pursue can't mean continual depression cuz pursue can't mean you have no action. Pursue means just that. And David ruled all night through the story and all was restored. So David under that restoration anointing because to me this is what has opened up to us right now in this church in what we are seeing in the vision that God is presenting a restoration anointing is upon coming upon to reconcile people to bring people right back to where they're supposed to be. I'll restore say the Lord. So to cry unto the Lord is a desperate call for help, a call for God's mercy, a call for God's intervention, a call in a time of distress, a urgent call, a call coming from a place of desperation. And it's amazing what the prophet said, you can't get desperate until God speaks to you. soul is getting to be attuned by the spirit to hear the voice of God speaking to you. Brother Brandon almost done when atomic bombs people are scared in the Pentagon. They don't know what to do and mystic signs in the skies are flying sources and everything else. God predicted it time it's time for Elijah to rise on the scene. Then he prophesied this. Let the people Let that little flop, that little remnant that God gave him, talking about Elijah, let that little remnant go to calling out to God. And watch what happens. There'll be a national showdown. There'll be a power that they have never seen before. The trouble of it is this time it's going to be too late for them. Then the doors will be closed. So remember, we are the end time. Pray. Just think about it, friends. If the people of Israel wasn't pressed so hard that they begin to cry unto God, it was a lamentation amongst them that God could say, "I've heard the cries of my people." Listen to this. That first branch that came forth was a Pentecostal branch filled with Pentecostal power. so impacted by the Holy Spirit till they staggered under the impact of the power of God. That remind me when Bang got the vision of the seven angels. He said the power of God pack him in a corner of the room. He was numb for days, not hours, not minutes, for days. He said, "You know the blessings of the Lord, but you don't know the power of God." When the power of God hit John, he fell as one dead. Hit Daniel, fell as one dead. It has an effect. This is not a game. These that who could talk the longest mystery and more mystery. This is a real God encounter. When God hit Moses, Moses had to God had to tell Moses the place to stand in his holy ground. So he says here that they were filled with Pentecostal power. So impacted by the Holy Spirit till they stand under the impact of the power of God. Listen. They went forth and saw visions, performed miracles, opened the eyes of the blind, healed the sick. Joy was in the camp. They prayed in one accord, all of them together until the building shook where they assembled together. Show me a church doing that today. Even the Pentecostal so-cal is getting so dry. They have ceremonial prayer. What we need is a prayer meeting that will shake the shingles off the top of the house and bring God back into the church again. It wasn't so from the beginning. All these creeds and cold formal ritualistics, all these different things, it wasn't so from the beginning. Jesus set up a church and said these signs shall follow them that believe. That was the beginning. That is what happened in the beginning. If he was here on earth today, he would not endorse our creeds and our things that we are doing. He would say it wasn't so from the beginning. Amen. Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. What we need today is a coming together and a prayer meeting and to stay there until God sends the adoption of the Holy Spirit brings the Holy Ghost down and places in the church apostles, prophets, teachers, evangelists, pastors. Now I know people fight that quote and I know and I'm now getting to realize how much unbelief in this message. He said when a church is believing that the Holy Ghost is just as real and when they are born and positionally born then God sets in the church. It takes the Holy Ghost to set the ministries. Let a man claim whatever you want to claim. I claim to be a teacher. I claim to be evangelist. I claim to be a prophet. I claim to be apostle. Man could talk whatever they talk. It's what God come down and vindicate. But I'll say something. He say that's what we need. That's what the church need. It will stay with the word. No, don't compromise. Don't flirt with the world. A church that will have nothing to do with sin. That will turn its back on sin. That will walk into into the holiness and beauty of God. Living for God. Live or die. About to close here. I'm wondering if we are really tied to the absolute that we claim to or if we are just trusting our church, our affiliation. As the world changes, it changes with that. There's one star that could never change. This word cannot change. His Bible cannot change. And if a man is born of the spirit of God with Christ in him, he punctuates every promise with a amen. He says a prayer meeting is what we need. We must be Christians. A Christian must use this same absolute to ask God. Listen, Jesus said, "If you abide in me, my words abide in you." And then he's talking about to ask for God to work upon the heart of a judge or that parole board and get that lucky fellow out of debt cell. If we have asked with faith believing, he says, "We will get it." and my faith here we go that I have in God I'm speaking that is why I'm here tonight that is why I cancel out something else and got in here I got to drive hundreds of miles tonight back to Tucson Arizona because I come listen to put my faith with yours that's a man it's a soul laying yonder it is someone in need and if we Christians have got to wake up to reality to a genuine faith tie to the word of God. Here it is. And plead that promise. Oh my. If you abide in me and my word abide in you, you can get what you want. He said, but if you can tie your faith, so he's talking some deeper things now. If you can tie your faith into such a place that you know and stay there and pray until God answers back and you know you got it in your heart, something's going to happen. I've seen the dead rays from the funeral home. I've seen the blind eyes come open, deaf ears have stopped. I have seen cancer ridden cases with sacoma cancer, leprosy, healed by the power of almighty God because they had faith to believe that that's God who made the promise would be able to keep his promise. That's real genuine faith like Abraham tie to there. Stay there and pray. Not just get out and say, "God, deliver a little poor fellow and send him home." We all like that. But let's stay there until something happened. When something happened, then that assurance could fall among this little handful of people sitting in this auditorium here tonight and could fall among us right here. Enough faith and power of God. If we could just pray through till we strike that home line, till the absolute comes down, that same pillar father was here in Tucson. Then if you could pray through until they get an answer back, you got the assurance back. The very God, here we go. I'm closing the final quote. The very God that could take a hooknose Jew like Paul angry going down there to put all the Christian to death under capital punishment and could change him and make him to a lovely Christian. That same God lives tonight. Change law to grace. anything he has a notion to do going to call me a holy ruler anyhow so I might as well get started right now then Mark 11:22 if you pray true verily I say unto you have faith in God I say unto you if you say to this mountain be moved when the absolute is come to you then you are anointed with that spirit here we go that comes beyond all scientific control out yonder before there was a atom or molecule the one that spoke it into existence. Say to this mountain, be moved and to doubt in your heart. So what brother Baron has presented to us is that there's a quality of faith that is tied to you my words tonight unlimited power. Oh, give the Lord some praises tonight. There is a quality of faith that is tied to unlimited power that you could see beyond your sickness, beyond your cancer, beyond your disease, beyond whatever ailing your family, you could go beyond that and see that God is God tonight and he is more than able and all things are possible to them that believe. Whether is financial issues, family issues, marital issues, personal issues, all things are possible to them that believe. Let's bow our heads for a word of prayer. Heavenly Father, I thank you tonight, oh God, for this privilege and opportunity that you have given unto us to share these words to your people and may they be inspired with them to cry unto you, Lord. Lord, you don't go around the bush and go around and around in circles. You were very specific. You say, "Gather the elders, call a fast, go call a solemn assembly." Why? Because you we need action. We need to get a result. We need to see something change. We We are needy. We We ask for your intervention. We ask for your mercy. We ask that you come and miraculously and and send on your miracle working power upon the sick and afflicted in our midst. We ask that your virtue will flow out at night. We ask you the power would hit the children, the young people that are at the edge, Lord, and knowing that you have such a powerful influence and is ease in the scripture. In resurrection season, Peter decided to go back fishing. after three and a half years following Messiah that that just because Jesus was not visibly looking at them talking to them among them they decide to go back to what they was in the beginning and this is human this is natural father and Lord I pray that your presence become so real that there'll be no turning back there'll be no going back there'll be no going back fishing father in that context but lord will be a seeking after and a thirst after oh god if it's ever a time to say creating me a thirst creating me a hunger is now because the devil is pelting everything, Lord, to stifle that thirst and to kill that hungering after righteousness. But Lord, you said, "Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled." So we know tonight that those that are hungering here or those that will begin to hunger, Lord, we know there's a blessing upon their lives that they're going to be filled with the Holy Ghost. Oh God, may it start tonight. If they don't have that hungering, may you create it. If they do have that thirsting, may they create it. You said he, oh God, if any man thirst, let him count to me and drink. Oh God, may there be thirsty souls here tonight. Cleanse us, Lord, from the crown of our head to the sos of our feet. Cleanse our heart. Cleanse our mind. Cleanse our thinking. Change our attitude. Change our thinking. Change our ways, Lord, that we be harmony with your will, harmony in your word. You said, "Cry out, Lord." The people of Israel, they cried out, they could answer. You send them Moses. In every season, in every age, when they cried out, something broke forth. Something happened. And that prophet prophesied, we read it. Wait that little group that God gives that Elijah. Wait till they go to calling upon God. It will be a national showdown. Oh God, that is what is needed. Lord, the message world is comfortable. They at ease in Zan. They going through the motions. But Lord, there got to be a spirit, an anointing to to send a revival, a thirst, to send an atmosphere, to create an atmosphere that in the homes, the mothers will be in deep prayer, the fathers will be in deep prayer, not just saying words, but calling upon God and and crying out unto God and and hungering after God, knowing that we have busted through Laia and we have busted through all the hindrances of of the the sins of this age. Oh God, bless the people tonight as they get on in prayer. May your holy spirit come down upon them in a special way. Give them the uncction that this prayer tonight, this prayer meeting tonight be a special prayer meeting. May you release the uncction upon them that they will have that ability to pray with the uncction of the Holy Ghost upon them. Come upon their lips, come upon their hearts, come upon their mind, come upon the words, Lord. Put your thoughts in their heart and your words upon their lips as they pray and cry out unto thee. In Jesus name I ask it. Amen and amen. Praise the Lord. God bless you. Oh, hallelujah. As they get on in prayer, may the Holy Spirit be with you in a special way. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat up here. [Music] Heat. [Music] [Music] [Applause] Heat.
