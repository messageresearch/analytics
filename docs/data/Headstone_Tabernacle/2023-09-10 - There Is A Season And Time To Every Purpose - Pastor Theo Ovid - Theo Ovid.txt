around the word of God Amen and um at this by now all of you would have heard that our precious brother Michael mcmo passed away yesterday he went home to be with the Lord he had after a long time in hospital we thank God for his life and his testimony that he had in the Lord and He is the backbone and Foundation of this very church I remember was being about 21 years old 22 years old when he asked me to go up Kaa with the Saints up there um while he was Station in New York and um this is the history of our church I was a member of the church long in Enterprise but lupas was a pastor at the time and he used to come back and forth from New York and um you know he started a group or work and B George was part of that original work I believe uh but the that's right but the George right here and Samar Ali and different names and and um we still have brother George from way back then and sters brother brother bran Striker his son is here Joel and his wife his mother is also wrong so there are people who still wrong from way back in the 70s back there and how God took us from there to where we are now and it was brother Michael mcmo who introduced me to Brother Joseph colan in 1982 as a brother who has claimed a revoltion of Brotherly kindness and this Ed me to Brother Joseph kman but Michael would forever be in our hearts he was a prolific testifier and winner of souls anytime you encounter him you stand at risk of being invited to a service he had that kind of passion wherever he went within New York Trinidad doesn't matter he always testifying about the Lord and he was a laborer but George will know he would live with one soul for hours hours I used to say even Jo would be impressed at his patience he didn't have that kind of patience but I believe that at the end of it all when he goes to get his reward I could hear God say Well done my good and faithful servant so this time I want to stand and have a minute of silence all departed brother which just want and just B head right where you are let's have a time of Silence praise the Lord uh let's play that song again hold to C and changeing hand we want to switch over to the service Anthony could you sing for me praise God oh to God's unchanging hand oh you got to hold till God's unchanging [Music] hand oh and [Music] to goding hand oh one more time well let's hold to God unchanging hand oh singing hold to God's unchanging hand oh and be h on things etern oh and home to God's unchanging hand thank you thank you so much this morning we want to go to a three portion scripture we want to read Job chapter 14 1-5 and then verse 13 and 14 we want to go to Ecclesiastes 3 1 verse verse one Revelation 19 verse seven find it amen all right we in job uh chapter 14 man that is born of a woman is a few days and full of trouble he cometh forth like a fla and is cut down he flee it as a shadow and continue it not and thust thou open Thine Eyes Upon such an one and bringest me into judgment with thee who can bring a clean thing out of unclean one seeing his days are determined the number of his months are with thee thou has appointed his bongs that he cannot pass and he Amplified that verse 5 said since a man days are already determined and the number of his months is wholly in your control and he cannot pass the bounds of his allotted time verse 14 13 and 14 oh that thou would hide me in the grave that thou would has keep me secret until thy rra be passed that thou wouldest appoint me a set time and remember me if a man die shall he live again all the days of my appointed time will I wait till my change come ecast CH 3: 1 uh to everything there's a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven Revelation 19:7 let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife had made herself ready let's bow our heads father we thank you for your word and I pray that your presence will come down in your word and through your word and bless your people and Inspire your people and edify your people and help your people give us a word in due season we ask in Jesus name amen and amen you may be seated oh praise the Lord blessed be the name of the Lord thank you Jesus love him praise God if you love him then serve him amen praise the lordo you could never get over sometimes when people people uh break from time get out of time and that is what that does that is where brother Michael has get out of time that takes you out of time but what was there before time for sons of God it was eternity and time is like a we call it a kink in eternity a little small break in eternity this l call time and we will be talking about time this morning Amen brother Bron if you have to do something that you can't do in Jesus name let it alone somebody said take a little drink you can't do that in Jesus name somebody say play a little cars you can't do that in Jesus name a dirty smutty joke in your Bridge party you can't tell it in Jesus name let it you can't wear shorts in Jesus name let I go I could go on you can't do that what you can't do in his name leave it alone because he said whatever you do in word and deed do it in all in the name of Jesus Christ oh blessed be the name of the Lord so this morning I have a title there's a season and time to every purpose season time to every purpose of a subject time was given to fulfill purpose and have an inspiration to do doing done that's the inspiration know it might sound a little weird but we see where we go tonight amen I got this while I was watching my vanage I was telling Isaac about it just come to me what time was given to fulfill purpose uh when you miss your purpose you waste your time you waste your time or your time is taken up with other things not connected to your purpose then you feel unfulfilled true fulfillment comes from doing the will of God that's why true fulfillment comes when you know you're doing what God want you to do so that takes you out of other people's business and you mind your own business by minding God's business and God's business will be revealed to you by his word which is his will and when you do his will you feel fulfilled because you're in the direct will of God no devil could shake you off of that no devil could throw you off of that because you're in God's will our lives will be by the fruit the fruit of Our Lives will be shown by how we manage BR time and changes was quite a song this morning time is filled with swift transition changes you know whether rich or poor somebody man money somebody don't somebody have a big house somebody have a small house but all of us have the same time rich man have 24 hours the poor man have 24 hours everybody have the same 24 hours and eastes 31 says to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under Heaven that's how God set it up you don't plant a corn today and get a corn tomorrow it have a process to go through you don't put a peas in the ground and expect a rep peas tomorrow you have a season for sewing a season for the process for the things to grow and mature just like our children The Cho born yesterday and big today you see them go 6 months one year 2 years 4 years 5 years 10 years and before you know it they tall just like Daddy and Mommy isn't that something we cannot change time we cannot challenge time whether you're busy or you're don't busy whether you're wasted or not it's still ticking on whether you apply it effectively or not time still rolling on time respects no man time respects no woman time respects no one time just roll on this is the power of this thing called time Hallelujah we cannot change or influence time you cannot say time hold on hold on don't move so fast until I find who I am some people let life just roll on and miss their time and miss their season and miss their visitation you cannot influence time you cannot change time am isn't that right Daniel 2:20 I will take my time if about time today Daniel answered after Daniel got the vision interpreted Vision Dan say blessed be the name of the god Forever This Daniel 2 for wisdom and might are his and he changeth the times and the seasons he remove Kings and set it up Kings he giveth wisdom unto the wise and knowledge to them that know understanding he revealed the Deep secret things he knoweth what is in the darkness and the light dwelleth with him I thank thee and praise thee Oh god of my fathers who has given me wisdom and might and has made known unto me now what we desired of thee for thou has now made known unto us the Kings matter so God is the one that issues change God is the one that does that set up Kings and bring down Kings do you believe that Daniel answered and said blessed be the name of the Lord God forever for wisdom and might are his for he changeth the times and Seasons he removeth Kings is that right Hallelujah but brandham you were saying yesterday morning we were lying in bed a little late the children didn't have to go to school we got is speaking about different things his wife what was hatred I said hatred had a beginning so it has to have an end love had no beginning so it has no end hatred is forever love is eternal hatred begins and hatred will end love never did begin it will never end it's Eternal and When a Man Loves a Woman and marries her because she's a pretty there'll be an end to that but when a man lives finds a woman that he loves he don't know why but he loves her she she finds a man that she loves no matter what he looks like she loves him that's an eternal meat and Glory death or nothing else can separate them because they are from eternity here we go and they stepped out into space of time and returned back to Eternity eternity has dropped down in a body called time oh glory to God so that seed German s you is eternal God put a seed inside of you a little bit of Eternity inside of you and God dropped you in a body called time so what you are living in today is a Time body and time have a beginning and time has an ending and he has set boundaries that you cannot cross herbs tablets exercise gym that they changing it he has set boundaries that you cannot cross could we say Amen somebody Oh Glory to God hallelujah so they stepped out into space of time and returned back to Eternity eternity dropped down in a body called time now we see the attributes sons of his Spirit have never yet entered into this word form body this body is subject to word to the word and and about the theophany waiting for the earnest change of the body now the difference between him and you as a son he was at the beginning the word and in morphe body he came in and live in that in the personal mzc then later we never heard no more mzc because he became Jesus Christ MDC was the priest and he became Jesus Christ now you bypass that because in that form he knowed all things and you have never been able to know that yet you come like Adam like me you come from attribute to the flesh to be tempted but when when this life is finished here not if when this life is finished here if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting that is where we go that is the word then we can look back and see what we have done we don't understand we never become the word we just become flesh man oh praise God but you will never be the word unless you are taught at the beginning so God take you as a thought Express you in the Loos the word and in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God in the beginning is where God started the beginning in the beginning is where God started time in his beginning in the beginning is when your clock begin to run oh give the Lord some Praises andto everything God attaches time and season Give the Lord some Praises every single thing under Heaven oh give the Lord a shout glory to God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so either you have things to do or you are doing it or it is done but you have a time limit on heaven to accomplish the purpose that God put you here on Earth for oh give the Lord some Praises this morning how many understand that you can't waste no more time oh glory to God God okay how old you are it's not how old you are it's what you have done he say what thou has good well thou good good and faithful servant welcome because of all you said is not you said it's that your mouth it's what you have done give the Lord some Praises glory to God a means nothing to God a thousand years at one day it's not how long in church it's not how long in the message is what you done from the kingdom oh give the Lord a praise glory to God hallelujah that's why I could talk about brother Michael and said God will say Well done my good and faithful servant because he done a whole lot for the kingdom Oh Glory to God and nothing you do if you do for the kingdom you do nothing you start to live yet give the Lord a shout the first mess said Jesus said repent for the kingdom of God is at hand Oh Glory to God hallelujah thy kingdom come thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven God Dro down time to fulfill his will to fulfill his purpose there's the only place you can make up you could break a bridge or give the Lord a shout in the [Applause] [Music] house till you get old to serve God you know I remember that create in the days of that youth Oh Glory when you're young you're strong you can accomplish so much for God when you all you're almost halfway out already praise God you better get it now oh glory to God time glory to God hallelujah could be identified as past present and future it's good where things go in the past you had a going in the past now you forgive that person going in the past you had sins it g in the past he drop your ches going in the past oh and you can bring the future present oh give the Lord a shout you could actually bring your future presence you could conqu the things that are not has there were oh give the Lord a shout by his stripes we are heal Oh Glory to God you can bring the future present oh glory to God but God Lives outside of that come on shout to me it like a like a novel In the book novel reading a book to read in it have past present and future but you outside the book you are reading the book you could spend the pages a mystery book you could go forward you could go backward you could say who done it God know the beginning from the end because he outside your time so he can intervene at any time oh give the Lord a shout he is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and [Applause] [Music] forever do you see it now so all this Petty nonsense and you're fighting this one and you and envy and jealous and all kind of malice and strife or what Reon how Petty and foolish it is Ecclesiastes is a powerful book you know it's almost like a sarcasm of Life the rich and the poor go in the same place the rich are going to Executive grave in the of d a rich gold to the death you know the same pain you know same sickness same old a same everything you know so listen this back now you see in order to stand Temptation you are to bypass the theophany you are to come down here in flesh to be tempted by sin now is not God want to heal you know he is a Healer is not God want to save you now he is a savior that is in him that is who he is he is a savior he is a redeemer he is a deliverer he is a baptizer he is the I am that I am that is what he is but when man was perfect in the Garden of Eden he couldn't manifest what he is so to get it going he put on free moral agency to choose you say of every tree don't touch that tree the day you eat that day you die so when man fell and died God got the opportunity to express who he [Applause] is so the can stop you from being healed He Is A Healer it's not God trying to heal you God have to exercise oh God I want to heal them I want to heal them it's not that he is a Healer he is a way maker he is a provider he is Jehovah Gyra he is a protector oh give the Lord a shout in the [Applause] house so sin brought about this element and that is how we bypass our theophany because Adam was supposed to make sons in His image and likeness to reflect Adam andam was born Spirit man and God put him in flesh look what God did God take a spirit man Genesis 1 and then form a flesh man Genesis 2 and breathed that Spirit man into the flesh man because he brought dust the very Earth that we standing on is what God formed the dust what form God man out of that's why he said dust Thou Art and the dust Thou shalt return oh get the Lord a shout this body come from the dust this body going back to the dust but there's going to be a bride in the last days will not see death she shall be changed it's going to be a Rapture Oh Glory to God this time body going to be transformed glory to God Amen do you believe [Applause] that see come here in the flesh to be tempted by sin so Temptation come

strong desire for advancement that's ambition ambition aspiration pretention means strong desire and advancement ambition applies to the desire for personal advancement or preferment may suggest equal equally a praiseworthy or inordinate desire driven by ambition aspiration implies striving after something higher than one why did I talk about ambition because there are some people have none ambition is what jams you to get a higher ideal you get one subject you want 10 you don't want to aim at nothing and hit Hallelujah you better aim high and miss you could get something a little lower but the aiming on nothing you know I mean like if you ain't going nowhere you must reach you aim at nowhere you're going where nowhere you reach already you have nothing to aim at when you have an aim that's why Paul said it this way I press towards the mark of the high calling you have to get a mark to press on to and that is what the will of God or the revealed word of God come to identify to you to get a Mark I remember when The Gideons people came to the school since College prin to as a student there and there was given out Bibles small Bibles on New Testament but Psalms I took M and I began to read that's why I start to read the Bible I had friends who throw their own in the garbage same age same school and some dumb that they thr that them ly them talking and I start to read that
