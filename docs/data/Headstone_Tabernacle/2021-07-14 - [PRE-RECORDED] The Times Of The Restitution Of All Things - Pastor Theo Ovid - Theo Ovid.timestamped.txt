[23:41] lord your prophet when he was on earth
[23:44] he said this is the best time
[23:46] that we have now you're gonna get worse
[23:50] and worse and worse
[23:54] father the prophet isaiah told us that
[23:56] gross darkness will
[23:58] cover the earth and gross darkness the
[24:00] people
[24:01] but you promised light in the evening
[24:04] time

[24:12] come along in a special way and minister
[24:15] to us and meet our every need
[24:17] and help us help your sons and daughters
[24:20] help those ministers of the gospels
[24:23] those
[24:23] shepherds lord that struggling with the
[24:26] sheep
[24:27] with the responsibility and the
[24:28] comfortability that
[24:30] as a time is at hand god honor your word
[24:33] among us this morning this night
[24:35] in jesus name we ask it amen and amen
[24:38] you may be seated
[24:39] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[24:46] but we bring greetings tonight
[24:50] uh from the headstone tabernacle
[24:51] trinidad we're ingredients to you in
[24:53] jesus name
[24:55] on a tongue but a sigma is family in
[24:56] church
[24:58] for this invitation to be here i want to
[25:01] greet
[25:01] also the fellow ministers fellow
[25:04] laborers in the gospel
[25:05] of jesus christ i want to appreciate all
[25:09] the ministers that has spoken before
[25:11] by the biscar but a pruitt
[25:14] or a kante but isaac but hildebrand god
[25:17] bless you all
[25:19] in your time of labor i want to thank
[25:22] brother zigman for the courage to do
[25:24] what he has done
[25:26] and i you know but abram taught us to
[25:30] look to see a man's motive and objective
[25:33] to see what he's trying to achieve if
[25:38] he's trying to do something for the
[25:39] kingdom of god and i believe that is
[25:41] what
[25:42] it's all about so sad today
[25:45] to see men establishing themselves the
[25:47] kingdom the empire
[25:50] and and so on but
[25:53] friends all this power play and
[25:57] empire building and stuff is just
[25:58] temporary
[26:00] because the train is in the block
[26:05] and the train picks up people along the
[26:07] way
[26:09] and exit others along the way but
[26:11] abraham exited its train in 1965
[26:14] and that train continues on this rapture
[26:16] express as the rapture expressed to
[26:18] glory
[26:19] and we don't know if this is the last
[26:22] meeting we're gonna ever have we don't
[26:23] know
[26:24] what tomorrow holds and i try to
[26:26] approach the
[26:27] puddle pit what i'm saying as if this is
[26:30] my last service
[26:32] as if this is my last sermon what i'm
[26:35] going to tell god's people
[26:38] because that's who you are you're god's
[26:41] people sometimes you don't know who you
[26:43] are
[26:44] and take something to reveal to you who
[26:47] you are
[26:48] i don't want to know well she didn't
[26:49] know she was a daughter of god
[26:51] she didn't know she was a child of god
[26:53] she didn't know her name was in the book
[26:55] but jesus took time off to come her way
[27:00] and he didn't want to talk about all
[27:01] what she did he wanted to show her there
[27:04] was a seed inside of her
[27:06] that was more important than all what
[27:08] she did
[27:09] and if she could get a revelation of
[27:11] what was inside of her what god put
[27:13] inside of her
[27:14] it'll make a whole difference all
[27:16] together and change her very life
[27:19] so this evening i have this message as a
[27:23] tribute to malachi 4.
[27:25] this is what i have this evening
[27:29] upon my heart and i want
[27:32] you to stand we want to go into the
[27:34] scriptures
[27:36] but this message is dedicated to
[27:39] the testimony in life
[27:42] a tribute to william marin brown and
[27:44] malachi 4 elijah prophet
[27:47] and the scriptures we have this evening
[27:49] is matthew chapter 17
[27:51] reading from verse 8 to 12
[27:54] and acts chapter 3 reading from verse 12
[27:59] to 21.
[28:02] the title of the message is the times
[28:06] of the restitution of all things
[28:10] that's the title the times of the
[28:13] restitution of all things
[28:15] and have an inspiration i will restore
[28:18] saith the lord read in matthew chapter
[28:22] 17 reading from verse 8
[28:24] this is after jesus was adopted on the
[28:26] mountain
[28:28] and when peter got an anointing to try
[28:31] to build three tabernacles the voice had
[28:33] to shut him up
[28:34] and tell him
[28:37] to don't bother with that and then they
[28:40] had lift up their eyes
[28:43] they saw no man saved jesus only
[28:47] and as they came down the mountain jesus
[28:50] charged them saying tell the vision to
[28:53] no man
[28:54] until the son of man be risen again from
[28:56] the dead
[28:58] and the disciples asked him saying why
[29:01] then say the scribes
[29:03] that elias must first come and jesus
[29:06] answered and said unto them elias
[29:10] truly shall first come and restore all
[29:14] things
[29:15] but i say unto you that elias has come
[29:17] already and they knew him not
[29:19] but have done unto him whatsoever they
[29:21] listed
[29:23] likewise shall also the son of man
[29:26] suffer of them acts chapter 3
[29:30] we want to read verse 12 this is after
[29:33] peter
[29:34] raised the man up that was crippled at
[29:37] the gate called beautiful
[29:39] and the people was looking at peter and
[29:41] then peter this is verse 12 and then
[29:43] peter saw it
[29:44] he answered unto the people he men of
[29:47] israel
[29:48] why marveling at this or why
[29:51] look so earnestly on us as
[29:54] though by our own power or holiness we
[29:57] have made this man to walk
[29:59] the god of abraham and of isaac and of
[30:02] jacob the god of our fathers
[30:04] had glorified his son jesus whom you
[30:07] delivered up
[30:08] and denied him in the presence of pilate
[30:11] when he was determined to let him go
[30:12] but he denied the holy one and the just
[30:16] and desired a murderer to be granted
[30:18] unto you and
[30:19] kill the prince of life whom god had
[30:22] raised from the dead
[30:23] wherever we are witnesses and his name
[30:26] true faith in his name had made this man
[30:28] strong
[30:29] whom you see and know ye the fate which
[30:32] is by him
[30:34] had given him this perfect songness in
[30:36] the presence of you all
[30:38] and now brethren i what that true
[30:42] ignorance he did it as did also your
[30:44] rulers
[30:46] but those things which god before had
[30:48] showed by the mouth of all his prophets
[30:51] that christ should suffer he had so
[30:53] fulfilled
[30:55] repented therefore and be converted
[30:59] that your sins may be blooded out when
[31:02] the times of refreshing shall come from
[31:04] the presence of the lord
[31:06] and he shall send jesus christ which
[31:09] before was preached
[31:10] unto you and this is where i get my
[31:12] thought from
[31:14] whom the heaven must receive until the
[31:17] times
[31:18] of the restitution of all things
[31:21] which god had spoken by the mouth
[31:25] of all his holy prophets since the world
[31:28] began let's bow our heads with a prayer
[31:31] kind father i pray that your holy spirit
[31:33] will come down in a special way
[31:36] may your pillar of fire drop on my
[31:38] shoulder and speak lip to air to your
[31:40] people
[31:41] you promise once more the world will
[31:42] hear direct from god speak to our hearts
[31:45] we are such a needy people father help
[31:48] us
[31:48] edify us bill us strengthen us inspire
[31:51] us
[31:52] anoint us pour out upon us confirm a
[31:54] word with signs
[31:56] wonders and miracles we ask in jesus
[31:58] name
[31:59] amen you may be seated praise god
[32:16] but i brought him from five
[32:17] identifications
[32:19] he said you cannot organize a kingdom of
[32:22] which christ is the head
[32:25] you cannot denominate a kingdom which
[32:28] christ is the head because christ
[32:31] is king and you cannot take the
[32:34] intellectuals of man
[32:36] and make an organization to which christ
[32:39] will govern
[32:41] therefore any companies
[32:45] any peoples any groups of men
[32:48] that tries to organize the kingdom of
[32:51] god
[32:52] is going contrary to the king and if
[32:56] they are going contrary to the king
[32:58] it would be against the king and if it's
[33:01] against the king it will be antichrist
[33:04] now that's pretty rough an antichrist
[33:08] spirit tries to take a people
[33:12] and call them from organization to
[33:15] organization
[33:17] organizing them together which never was
[33:20] the will of god
[33:22] people has always fussed at me because i
[33:24] struck so hard
[33:26] at organizations it isn't the people in
[33:29] there
[33:30] that i'm striking at it's that
[33:33] dominating spirit
[33:35] that makes the people think we are the
[33:38] people
[33:40] god's people is a called out people
[33:43] i believe they are in every denomination
[33:47] they could be catholic they could be
[33:49] protestant that was that time
[33:51] in this time it could be
[33:52] disinterpretation that interpretation
[33:55] that group that country it doesn't
[33:57] matter
[33:58] they could be jewish they could be kind
[34:01] of what kind of church
[34:02] but the real church here we go is the
[34:05] mystical body of jesus christ
[34:10] and you cannot organize the mystical
[34:13] body of jesus christ
[34:15] by inspiration by doctrine by teaching
[34:18] you still can't do it
[34:20] because it's a mystery it's the mystical
[34:23] body of jesus christ
[34:25] and by one spirit we are baptized into
[34:28] that one body
[34:29] hallelujah hallelujah and once you go
[34:33] into that body nobody can take you out
[34:37] oh give the lord some praises people
[34:40] god's church is free
[34:43] [Applause]
[34:44] god church is bound by no boundaries
[34:48] every human being on earth belongs to
[34:50] him
[34:51] whether he is catholic protestant
[34:54] whatever he is god seek those with an
[34:58] honest heart and we are saved by faith
[35:01] believe in him
[35:03] now you see the church is not an
[35:05] organization
[35:06] people ask he asks are you a christian
[35:10] answer i'm a baptist that don't answer
[35:13] the question at all
[35:16] are you a christian i am pentecost that
[35:19] don't answer the question if you are a
[35:23] christian
[35:24] you are a born-again creature you are a
[35:27] mystic kingdom of god
[35:29] your eyes are not on the things of this
[35:31] world
[35:32] what are the things about and that is
[35:35] the church
[35:36] it is not an organization
[35:39] it can never be an organization this is
[35:43] the prophet
[35:44] take me on record the church
[35:47] of the living god can never be any
[35:50] certain group
[35:54] i want to say it again the church
[35:58] i'm not talking about your church i am
[36:00] talking about the church
[36:02] of the living god jesus said
[36:05] upon this rock i will build
[36:09] my church and the gates of hell
[36:13] can't prevail against him there is going
[36:16] to be a church
[36:17] hallelujah universal
[36:20] international governed by god
[36:24] ruled by god not message popes
[36:28] or bishops or potential powers
[36:31] all hallelujah are people
[36:35] that god has called out oh hallelujah
[36:39] praise god so i say that take me on
[36:43] record
[36:44] the church of the living god can never
[36:47] be
[36:48] any certain group i don't care what our
[36:51] group teaches
[36:52] what doctrine they have it cannot be a
[36:55] certain group
[36:57] it cannot be i have it you don't have it
[36:59] it cannot be this group here have the
[37:01] angel and this group don't have the
[37:02] angel
[37:03] it cannot be this group is right and
[37:05] this is wrong no
[37:07] one spirit one spirit one
[37:10] lord one baptism one
[37:13] god one elijah
[37:18] one message
[37:22] let me be seated restitution
[37:26] the word it means
[37:29] the act of restoring to the rightful
[37:32] owner
[37:34] something that has been taken away
[37:37] lost or surrendered it also means
[37:41] a return to or restoration of
[37:46] a previous state or
[37:49] that's what the word restitution means
[37:52] restoring
[37:53] to the rightful owner now but
[37:57] assadison church i want to bring a
[38:00] backdrop here
[38:01] he was speaking about martin luther was
[38:04] not the only one protesting the catholic
[38:06] church
[38:06] there were others god time was ripe
[38:10] for a definite move of the restoration
[38:13] of the church
[38:15] to an outpouring of the holy ghost at a
[38:16] later date
[38:18] watch they had the written word but not
[38:21] the reveal word
[38:23] this was the reformation period god
[38:27] was about to take the church out
[38:30] from the depth of satan of the dark ages
[38:34] into the depth of god so god
[38:37] was doing a work to bring the church
[38:40] back
[38:41] because the heaven must receive jesus
[38:43] until
[38:44] the restitution or the restoration
[38:48] of all things so based upon the
[38:50] scripture
[38:51] i am convinced that all things that
[38:55] has to be restored all what the
[38:57] counterwork
[38:58] all what the caterpillar or what the
[39:01] locusts
[39:02] all what has been broken up messed up in
[39:05] this message
[39:06] god said i will restore
[39:11] he didn't even ask you if you interested
[39:14] in restoration
[39:15] it's not about you it is his word
[39:19] he said he said
[39:22] he said i gonna be restored
[39:26] or i feel good tonight that the
[39:30] restoration is on
[39:32] the move for the bride is on hallelujah
[39:37] glory to god from laotian church age
[39:40] brother branham now watch the seventh
[39:43] age messenger he's a prophet
[39:46] not only do we see this messenger coming
[39:47] in revelation 10 7
[39:49] but we find the word speaks of elijah
[39:53] before jesus returns and brother branham
[39:55] read the script to be read
[39:56] our disciples ask him why
[40:00] say the scribe elias must first come
[40:03] because the teachers and the preachers
[40:05] they preaching this
[40:06] and liars must first come and watch
[40:10] and restore all things before the coming
[40:13] of our lord
[40:14] elijah must come back for a work
[40:18] of restoration of the church then he
[40:21] quote malachi 4 scripture scripture
[40:22] we're familiar with
[40:23] behold i will send you elijah the
[40:24] prophet before the coming of the great
[40:26] and revelation of the lord
[40:27] and he shall turn the hearts of the
[40:29] fathers to the children and the hearts
[40:31] of the church to their fathers
[40:33] least i come and smite the good for the
[40:34] curse there is
[40:36] absolutely no doubt elijah
[40:40] must return before the coming of jesus
[40:44] he has a specific
[40:47] work to accomplish that work
[40:50] is in malachi 4 6 that says
[40:54] he will turn the hearts of the children
[40:58] back to the fathers so that's barbara
[41:02] job that's his job description
[41:05] he didn't come for us to have message
[41:07] churches all over the world
[41:09] he didn't come for us to give out books
[41:11] and tapes he came
[41:12] specifically to turn the hearts of the
[41:15] children
[41:16] back to the faith of the fathers so
[41:19] every book
[41:20] every tape every message the objective
[41:23] of that
[41:24] is to turn your heart to turn our hearts
[41:28] back to the faith not church
[41:32] defeat not effect defect
[41:36] there was only one fate
[41:46] let's continue laurie central
[41:49] now this messenger of malachi 4
[41:53] and revelation 10 7 is going to do
[41:56] two things
[42:03] [Applause]
[42:05] not 50 things not a hundred things
[42:09] two things
[42:14] one according to malachi 4
[42:17] he will turn the hearts of the children
[42:20] to the fathers
[42:21] two he will reveal
[42:24] the mysteries of the seven thunders of
[42:28] revelation
[42:28] 10. which are the revelations
[42:32] contained in the seven seals it will be
[42:38] it will be these divinely reveal
[42:43] mystery truths that would literally
[42:47] literally literal more
[42:51] hallelujah hallelujah
[42:54] literally turn the hearts of the
[42:57] children
[42:58] back to the father
[43:05] exactly so the prophet for the last age
[43:10] here we go must be bringing a message
[43:12] from god
[43:14] that will forerun the second coming of
[43:15] the lord
[43:17] for his message will with the heart of
[43:19] the church return back to the
[43:20] pentecostal fathers here we go are you
[43:22] ready
[43:23] and with the restoration of the world
[43:27] will come the restoration of power
[43:30] [Applause]
[43:36] may be seated remember
[43:40] the pentecostal received dynamics
[43:45] but it didn't produce the fruit of
[43:48] restoration
[43:49] because they didn't have the word
[43:53] so you can receive spirit without word
[43:58] they had gifts they had signs and
[44:00] wonders
[44:01] they had miracles but they couldn't go
[44:03] on to adoption
[44:05] which is what porter branham come to
[44:07] introduce
[44:10] [Music]
[44:12] he came to introduce the age of adoption
[44:20] because this restoration is to return us
[44:23] back to eden
[44:26] this restoration is to turn us back
[44:29] to what adam had
[44:33] and adam had the book
[44:39] adam had the book but when adam fell
[44:44] he lost it
[44:47] and that book went in the hands of the
[44:50] original
[44:50] owner so this is genesis here
[44:54] this is adam losing the book here and
[44:57] the book stays up there
[44:58] until the end of time i elijah messenger
[45:01] coming here
[45:03] to wait for the book a mighty angel
[45:07] have to take the book bring down the
[45:10] book
[45:11] open the book for you to see
[45:14] your name
[45:28] so i can't share with you
[45:31] just bible stuff or or just
[45:35] you know information about the pope
[45:39] about time magazine about what happened
[45:41] in america
[45:43] or venus and mars or the constellation
[45:46] and pluto means this
[45:48] and then this one and what could it be
[45:50] this
[45:51] and could it be this i'm not here what
[45:52] could it be but abraham didn't come but
[45:54] could it be
[45:55] he can be just scared the lord
[46:00] hallelujah listen to what the bible said
[46:03] behold i sent you elijah before the
[46:06] great and terrible day of the lord
[46:08] and he shall turn the hearts of the
[46:10] children back to the faith of the
[46:11] fathers
[46:12] oh hallelujah i say unto you
[46:15] elias has already come
[46:24] hallelujah hallelujah i
[46:28] say unto you he has already come and he
[46:30] has done his job
[46:32] so the restoration of the word means the
[46:35] restoration of the power
[46:37] before elijah could come to his message
[46:39] he has to tap the loose ends that's what
[46:42] he said
[46:43] the malachi for elijah the seventh
[46:45] injured had no certain message
[46:46] but his job was to tap the loose end so
[46:48] he said the elijah prophet had to open
[46:50] six seals
[46:51] because christ was the seventh seal
[46:52] malachi 4 a son of man could only open
[46:55] six seals
[46:56] because christ himself was the seventh
[46:57] seal so elijah come and tap all the
[46:59] loose ends
[47:00] to talk about the pope and catholic
[47:02] church and all these different kinds of
[47:04] things
[47:04] that's what he did isn't that right
[47:07] hallelujah
[47:08] when he finished he's ready for his
[47:09] message which was the seventh seal
[47:12] the first three series history fought
[47:14] see this prophecy
[47:16] fifteen the souls under the altar six
[47:18] season judgment where are you at
[47:23] so god take a bride listen and slip up
[47:25] under the sub and see you
[47:27] silence only for half an hour half an
[47:29] hour is fixed
[47:30] only half an hour but that silence is
[47:32] about to be broken
[47:34] and we will see the contents of what was
[47:36] under that seventh seal
[47:38] oh hallelujah praise peter jesus oh
[47:41] blessed be the name of the lord
[47:43] so let's continue the age started off in
[47:45] the 20th century
[47:47] i was the age but as it was to be the
[47:49] age
[47:51] in which the true church would return to
[47:54] being the bride she was at pentecost
[47:57] we know that there must be necessarily a
[48:00] retained dynamic power we know that
[48:02] we have to go back to dynamic power
[48:05] that's that's the promise
[48:07] watch the believers sense this
[48:11] in their spirits and begin crying to god
[48:15] for a new authority in the first century
[48:19] what seemed to be the answer came
[48:22] as many began to speak in tongues and
[48:24] manifest gifts of the spirit
[48:27] it was then believed that this was
[48:29] indeed
[48:30] the long-awaited restoration it was not
[48:34] for here we go the latter rain
[48:37] can only come after the former rain
[48:41] which is a spring or teaching rain the
[48:44] latter rain
[48:46] is the harvest ring how could this be
[48:49] the
[48:49] real thing when the teaching rain had
[48:52] not come
[48:53] the prophet messenger who was to be sent
[48:57] to
[48:57] teach the people and turn the hearts of
[49:00] the children
[49:02] back to pentecostal fathers had not yet
[49:04] come
[49:06] thus what was thought to be the
[49:09] restoration
[49:10] yes yes yes what was taught
[49:14] to be the restoration and the final
[49:17] quickening
[49:18] unto the rapture had not come
[49:24] in it was a mixture of the unrighteous
[49:28] partaking of spiritual blessing
[49:30] and manifesting in the holy ghost it is
[49:33] also
[49:33] devil power as men were
[49:36] under the control of devils yet no one
[49:40] seemed to realize it
[49:41] then to prove it was not real
[49:45] these people second generation organized
[49:49] and wrote on scriptural doctrines here
[49:52] we go
[49:52] and build their own fences as every
[49:55] other group ahead
[49:56] have done and this is what doctrine does
[49:58] it build fences
[50:02] instead of bridges it build walls we
[50:05] believe this
[50:05] so we can fellowship with you we believe
[50:08] this so i can't come to your convention
[50:10] we believe this that's what doctrine
[50:12] does it build walls
[50:14] and god promised to send some rain and
[50:17] that rain gonna fall so much
[50:19] the ducks will begin to swim and you're
[50:21] gonna raise above
[50:22] every wall i will restore
[50:26] saith the lord not by might
[50:30] not by power but by my spirit
[50:34] saith the lord god almighty hallelujah
[50:38] glory so then joel 2 said
[50:42] all the flaws shall be full of wheat fat
[50:44] shall overflow with wine and oil oh this
[50:46] is a prophecy
[50:48] only time was barren all the time was
[50:50] hardship
[50:51] but god said the fat shall overflow and
[50:54] wine will overflow
[50:55] and i will restore to you the years the
[50:57] locals have eaten the kangaroo and the
[50:59] caterpillar
[51:00] and palm oil migrate which i sent among
[51:02] you and you shall eat plenty and be
[51:04] satisfied in praise
[51:06] the name of the lord your god that i
[51:08] just want to see with you
[51:10] and my people shall never be ashamed now
[51:12] it says god is going to restore
[51:14] the lutheran church did not restore it
[51:16] started reformation
[51:18] the western age did not restore the
[51:20] pentecostal age did not restore
[51:22] but god has to restore this
[51:25] is not the resurrection of the church it
[51:28] is the restoration
[51:30] god here we go we'll take the church
[51:33] right back to pentecost
[51:35] i believe that do you believe that
[51:38] hallelujah praise be to jesus now watch
[51:42] remember malachi 4 the message come
[51:45] before the terrible of the lord he said
[51:47] all denominations and creeds eat it down
[51:50] god said i will restore it again last
[51:52] days and it will be restored
[51:54] here we go god shall send the holy ghost
[52:00] in such a way note he did not
[52:04] say god's chance shall send doctrines
[52:07] and teachings in such a way no he did
[52:10] not say that
[52:11] we have a lot of doctrines and teachings
[52:13] he did not say that
[52:14] he said god will send the holy ghost
[52:19] in such a way upon planted word
[52:25] that will restore what's the secret
[52:29] the word is in the pride
[52:32] that's the secret that was always the
[52:35] secret
[52:37] god was always putting the word in the
[52:39] bread
[52:40] by books by tips by preachers by
[52:42] messages the word comes into the bride
[52:45] because the mystery of god come down
[52:46] from god as the word of god
[52:49] so as i receive the word you receive the
[52:50] mystery
[52:52] i am not hearing you i will say it again
[52:56] the mystery of god comes down from god
[52:59] as the word of god so as you receive the
[53:02] word
[53:03] you receive the mystery and christ is
[53:06] the mystery
[53:08] oh give the lord a shout give the lord
[53:11] some praises
[53:19] and we will always know when people get
[53:22] revelation
[53:24] you see when it's just intellectual
[53:26] shake your head do it like that amen
[53:28] glory but when revelation breaks
[53:31] it brings stimulation you see revelation
[53:34] is wine
[53:35] revelations make a stagger revelation
[53:38] make a shout
[53:39] you can't cross your leg with that's
[53:41] that's no revelation
[53:43] that is no revelation whatsoever
[53:46] but once you get revelation when jesus
[53:49] told that woman
[53:50] go call your husband she said i have
[53:52] none but the one he said you're one
[53:54] living with is not yours
[53:56] and when jesus finished with her and
[53:57] said i am he
[53:59] she ran she couldn't walk okay jesus
[54:03] okay thank you jesus no no no no no no
[54:06] she couldn't do that
[54:07] she began to run come see a man
[54:11] come see a man come see a man
[54:30] but you know what's wrong in this
[54:31] message if i want to send knowledge and
[54:34] increase
[54:35] knowledge shall increase it's so much
[54:36] our books it's so much that tapes
[54:39] it's so much information that people
[54:41] will get in the spirit
[54:42] but when john got in the spirit bible
[54:44] said john said i was in the spirit
[54:46] i'm sorry your door from heaven when
[54:49] john when they get in your spirit
[54:50] and that's what the worship is for
[54:52] that's why the devil hates worship
[54:54] people intellectual want information
[54:56] writing down notes so you're not part of
[54:58] sight
[54:59] forget about the notes you don't need to
[55:02] note
[55:03] you don't need to write nothing down you
[55:06] need to worship
[55:09] honor glory might
[55:12] power dominion onto the land forever
[55:29] [Applause]
[55:31] my god hallelujah glory to god
[55:34] hallelujah praise god
[55:36] maybe you see that praise god my lord
[55:40] when jesus when peter told that man he
[55:42] was lame
[55:44] silvan go have i none that's the feature
[55:47] okay it didn't say and peter was walking
[55:50] the gate quite beautiful
[55:51] and he handed him a book and said read
[55:53] that
[55:56] he didn't say play a tape listen to that
[55:59] no that wasn't the fate the faith was
[56:01] silver and gold
[56:02] but i don't have i don't have that but
[56:05] i've got something
[56:06] such as i have i could release it i
[56:08] could give it
[56:09] yes yes you have to give it rise up and
[56:12] walk in the name of jesus christ
[56:14] that's the fate and you know what that
[56:16] man began to do
[56:17] he began to jump and leap and praise god
[56:21] maybe you never sin enough maybe he
[56:23] never was done in hell
[56:24] maybe you never was in trouble enough to
[56:26] begin to praise and thank your god
[56:32] one of one of the sickest things to see
[56:34] is ministers that don't want to worship
[56:38] i want the sickest things to see
[56:39] ministers that can't praise god and
[56:41] can't worship and can't thank god you'll
[56:42] get trouble in heaven
[56:44] you get trouble across there you know
[56:46] about rapturing condition
[56:48] you may be seated the astronauts what
[56:50] what isaac was talking about
[56:52] before they go up there they have to
[56:54] rehearse down here
[56:56] they have to go in the atmosphere of
[56:58] where they are going
[57:00] and if you want to go to heaven if they

[57:42] atmosphere because holy ghost can't come
[57:44] on dry

[58:36] sing the song of the redeemed
[58:39] that was redeemed us by thy blood
[58:43] a holy ghost film man john he wept
[58:46] because no man was found worthy angel
[58:49] was worthy but he needed a man
[58:51] a king's man all of a sudden out of a
[58:54] tendency
[58:55] the lamb stepped forward and took the
[58:57] book
[58:59] not for himself no for his wife
[59:02] he took the book and he began to release
[59:05] that book and began to break the seals
[59:08] and john said all in heaven all on the
[59:10] earth
[59:11] all john's had to go in different
[59:13] dimensions
[59:14] his voice his worship his
[59:18] praise start to break in different
[59:20] dimensions
[59:21] all under it all under the earth heard i
[59:24] praise god when the lamb took the book
[59:27] because we shall reign
[59:30] on the earth
[59:45] [Applause]
[59:56] you believe that all those believers up
[59:58] there want to stay up there
[1:00:00] that is not their promise their promises
[1:00:03] back to the earth
[1:00:04] and if we have to reign up there we have
[1:00:07] to demonstrate it down here
[1:00:09] that's why god put adam to control the
[1:00:10] beast of the field and everything else
[1:00:13] and to show the book has been restored
[1:00:15] god led brother branham to
[1:00:16] face a killer bull out in the field
[1:00:20] he even got his gun it's a killer bull
[1:00:22] they had a reputation
[1:00:24] it's not a weaving bull it's a killable
[1:00:28] that's right and brother branham fought
[1:00:29] him caught found himself caught in that
[1:00:31] field
[1:00:32] dealing with this killable i said
[1:00:34] something came over him
[1:00:36] it wasn't doctrine came over him it
[1:00:38] wasn't a teacher and came over here
[1:00:40] no something came over here it was love
[1:00:44] it was the spirit of god something came
[1:00:46] over him
[1:00:47] something this something is what we're
[1:00:49] talking about
[1:00:50] do i know all mysteries do i understand
[1:00:53] all mysteries
[1:00:54] do i have all knowledge do i give my
[1:00:56] body to be burned
[1:00:57] i could know new name mystery seven
[1:00:59] thunder mystery mystery trump mystery
[1:01:01] vile the plagues the wolves every
[1:01:02] mystery hidden mystery written hidden
[1:01:03] mystery or kind of mystery if i don't
[1:01:05] have the love of god i am
[1:01:06] nothing it will take perfect love to go
[1:01:09] across there
[1:01:10] glory to god you may be seated and i
[1:01:14] have news for you
[1:01:15] the killer bull is not found in church
[1:01:20] you don't find a killer bull getting a
[1:01:21] seat in church no you find it killable
[1:01:24] on the outside
[1:01:24] so what you come to church for is to
[1:01:27] equip you to deal with what is on the
[1:01:28] outside
[1:01:29] god will have a powerful bride a
[1:01:31] bridegroom be restored back
[1:01:33] just like the day of pentecost an
[1:01:35] original bride
[1:01:36] there were cowards in the upper room but
[1:01:38] notice what happened when the holy ghost
[1:01:39] came
[1:01:40] peter slammed the door open hallelujah
[1:01:42] my god they can't wait to get outside
[1:01:45] they can't wait to testify you know why
[1:01:47] jesus said you shall receive power
[1:01:50] after the holy ghost come upon you and
[1:01:52] you
[1:01:54] shall be witnesses unto me
[1:02:00] so when the holy ghost came it brought
[1:02:03] witnessing power
[1:02:04] power to declare god present tense
[1:02:08] oh glory to god so you stand there and
[1:02:11] say peter you're cursed that's right
[1:02:13] you deny christ that's right but i have
[1:02:15] something you don't have
[1:02:18] because i just come on the upper room so
[1:02:21] you can talk about me all that you
[1:02:23] please
[1:02:24] i will talk about you on my knees
[1:02:27] because my sins are under the blood i've
[1:02:30] been redeemed
[1:02:32] oh give the lord a shout in the house
[1:02:35] let the redeemed say so oh glory to god
[1:02:38] let the redeemed say so
[1:02:45] god will send the holy ghost in such a
[1:02:48] way
[1:02:49] you see the prophet saying you could get
[1:02:50] enough holy ghost to say i'm saved
[1:02:52] and if i surrender now you can get more
[1:02:54] holy ghost until signs and wonders still
[1:02:56] god begin to come out your very body
[1:02:59] that's the power of virtue because you
[1:03:01] see brother branham restored back
[1:03:04] wow he released the spirit of prophecy
[1:03:07] isn't that right we have received the
[1:03:10] testimony of jesus
[1:03:11] which is the spirit of prophecy isn't
[1:03:13] that right what brother brown brought
[1:03:15] was a prophetic vision
[1:03:16] many ministers and many people haven't
[1:03:18] caught that he brought an actual vision
[1:03:21] the vision is what makes a difference
[1:03:23] the vision gives you an oversight a
[1:03:25] complete picture
[1:03:26] and the vision means a restoration of
[1:03:28] the ministry of jesus
[1:03:30] christ not man ministry this brother
[1:03:32] ministry that part of ministry we're not
[1:03:34] talking about that we had it for 50
[1:03:35] years
[1:03:37] we want the ministry of jesus christ
[1:03:40] oh could we get a shout in the halls
[1:03:43] that's the promise
[1:03:44] the prophetic vision identifies the
[1:03:47] restoration of the ministry of jesus
[1:03:49] christ amongst the people
[1:03:52] when bahrain says the world will hear
[1:03:54] direct from god
[1:03:55] he said how shall we know it's the voice
[1:03:57] of god back then
[1:03:58] it wasn't a vindicated prophet how shall
[1:04:00] we know the voice of god today
[1:04:03] it will be a manifestation of the
[1:04:06] prophet's word
[1:04:08] so we are supposed to say this is that
[1:04:11] that the prophet william branham speak
[1:04:13] of
[1:04:14] amen
[1:04:18] not what we speak what the prophet spoke
[1:04:20] that's what peter did this is that
[1:04:23] that the prophet joel
[1:04:29] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:04:33] hallelujah hallelujah listen friends
[1:04:36] we are promised a seven thunder revival
[1:04:38] you might be seated
[1:04:40] he said the bride hadn't had a revival
[1:04:43] yet
[1:04:44] it will take those seven thunders
[1:04:48] to wake her up again it will take
[1:04:57] you taught a man from somewhere else
[1:04:59] said that no
[1:05:01] the prophet said seven times give fate i
[1:05:04] didn't say that
[1:05:05] he said say what the tip say he said the
[1:05:08] seventh will gather the bride together
[1:05:10] that's not my words that's his words he
[1:05:12] said the seventh honorable show the
[1:05:14] right how to prepare
[1:05:15] that's not my word that's his word he
[1:05:17] said wait till them seven thunders
[1:05:19] after the voices of that group they're
[1:05:21] going to shut the hell they could open
[1:05:23] the heavens
[1:05:24] oh yes heaven could open up tonight
[1:05:27] hallelujah
[1:05:28] hallelujah heaven could open up tonight
[1:05:36] those are not my words those are his
[1:05:38] words
[1:05:39] oh my praise god
[1:05:43] what has to be restored
[1:05:46] what was lost to begin with but ibrahim
[1:05:49] in the breach
[1:05:50] when adam lost his life he lost his
[1:05:53] inheritance in life
[1:05:56] because he had supreme control of the
[1:05:58] earth he was the god of the earth small
[1:06:00] g
[1:06:02] god was the god of the universe big g
[1:06:04] and everywhere but his son
[1:06:06] had the earth under his control
[1:06:10] he could speak he could name he could
[1:06:13] say
[1:06:14] he could stop nature he could do
[1:06:15] anything he wanted to
[1:06:17] let's go back to the ball when baltimore
[1:06:19] said bull go and slide down there that
[1:06:21] was adam again
[1:06:23] having power over the beast of the field
[1:06:27] so that has been vindicated
[1:06:33] so adam just not only lost his life he
[1:06:36] lost his inheritance in life
[1:06:38] so one and when i fell i tried to access
[1:06:41] the power
[1:06:42] he saw something on the screen mark
[1:06:44] access denied
[1:06:50] access denied all the time he had free
[1:06:54] access
[1:06:55] but no access denied angels guard the
[1:06:58] tree of life adam escorted out of the
[1:07:01] garden of eden
[1:07:05] that was in the beginning but in this
[1:07:07] last day
[1:07:08] angel escorting the bride back
[1:07:11] to eden you're getting full access
[1:07:17] did you get that the same works i do
[1:07:21] shall you do also that's full access
[1:07:24] if you shall say to the mountain be
[1:07:27] moved
[1:07:28] and don't doubt that's full access
[1:07:31] the pride go now full access to all what
[1:07:34] jesus had
[1:07:35] hallelujah so adam loss
[1:07:38] his inheritance but i'm an adoption
[1:07:41] somebody
[1:07:42] has to leave use something to inherit it
[1:07:44] is that right
[1:07:45] and inheritance do we have what
[1:07:48] inheritance did i have i didn't have any
[1:07:50] but god left me an inheritance when he
[1:07:53] put my name on the lamb's book of life
[1:07:55] before the foundation of the world you
[1:07:57] say now wait a minute brother
[1:07:59] jesus did that when he died for me no he
[1:08:02] never
[1:08:03] jesus come to purchase that narrative
[1:08:05] for me read the next verse
[1:08:06] in whom we obtain an inheritance
[1:08:10] being predestinated according to his own
[1:08:12] goodwill
[1:08:13] look predestinated us unto his
[1:08:15] inheritance
[1:08:17] if i'm a right inheritance of something
[1:08:20] if god is knocking in my heart and say
[1:08:21] william branham
[1:08:23] i called you a long time ago before the
[1:08:25] foundation of the world
[1:08:27] to preach the gospel i have an
[1:08:29] inheritance
[1:08:30] an inheritance of eternal life god
[1:08:34] sent jesus to make that
[1:08:37] inheritance real to me because there was
[1:08:39] nothing i could inherit it
[1:08:41] it was blank but jesus the lamb slain
[1:08:45] here we go from the foundation of the
[1:08:46] world his blood was shed
[1:08:49] that i may go to my inheritance to be
[1:08:51] what what inheritance
[1:08:53] to sonship to be a son of god
[1:08:56] to be a son of god not not what we are
[1:08:58] right now this is fallen man
[1:09:01] son of god is attribute sons of his
[1:09:02] spirit
[1:09:04] that way son of god is jesus christ so
[1:09:06] he came to call other sons
[1:09:07] that didn't even know they were sons
[1:09:09] peter come john
[1:09:11] come james come he was calling them they
[1:09:13] didn't know what they were being called
[1:09:14] unto
[1:09:15] but he was calling them he was calling
[1:09:17] them to positionally place them
[1:09:19] for manifestation manifestation god call
[1:09:22] you not just to sit
[1:09:23] on a church bench not to sit in the
[1:09:26] church god
[1:09:27] call you to be a manifested son
[1:09:29] [Applause]
[1:09:33] yeah you might be seated the five-fold
[1:09:36] ministry is temporary you know
[1:09:39] i hear so much about fifo and five-fold
[1:09:42] and five-fold and who in the four who
[1:09:43] not in the fall and everything else
[1:09:45] but that fifo ministry is until we all
[1:09:48] come
[1:09:52] to the unity of the faith to the
[1:09:54] knowledge of the son of god
[1:09:56] onto a perfect man in other words you
[1:09:58] going to know who you are
[1:10:01] you're going to know where you come from
[1:10:02] you're going to know where you're going
[1:10:04] then afterwards they do no man to teach
[1:10:06] you afterwards all the minister is going
[1:10:08] to edify the body
[1:10:09] because you will come into a perfect
[1:10:11] realization of where you come from and
[1:10:13] where you're going
[1:10:14] you'll be in a state of perfection what
[1:10:16] man you need over your life
[1:10:17] what man do you need to rule you when
[1:10:20] you come into that perfect oneness with
[1:10:22] god
[1:10:28] so what man lost was his sonship
[1:10:32] his inheritance that's what the book is
[1:10:34] all about
[1:10:35] this is not a difficult message
[1:10:37] ministers sometimes make it complex
[1:10:38] not gordon complexity is god in
[1:10:40] simplicity
[1:10:42] that book held the mystery
[1:10:45] of our names that book held the mystery
[1:10:48] of
[1:10:48] inheritance all was sealed up in that
[1:10:51] book
[1:10:52] oh my watch this might just choke you
[1:10:56] but did you know that
[1:10:57] that men that are sons of god are
[1:10:58] amateur gods how many knows that
[1:11:01] watch they were gods they had full
[1:11:03] domain dominion over the world
[1:11:05] he gave them dominion over all things he
[1:11:06] lost his godship he lost his sonship
[1:11:09] he lost his domain and satan took it
[1:11:12] over but brother you're what we're
[1:11:13] waiting for
[1:11:13] we are waiting for the manifestation of
[1:11:16] the sons of i love that
[1:11:18] here i'm waiting for for conventions and
[1:11:19] churches and groups
[1:11:21] and so on and notices of what we have no
[1:11:23] no you're waiting for the manifestation
[1:11:25] of the sons of god
[1:11:26] who are they they are around the world
[1:11:30] did you hear that they are around the
[1:11:33] world
[1:11:34] so if somebody thinks they are the only
[1:11:35] people on the beach something is wrong
[1:11:38] i am the only man of the man of the art
[1:11:40] forget about it forget about it
[1:11:42] get next to yourself brother brother
[1:11:44] branham said god
[1:11:46] could only find one man in the day of
[1:11:49] elijah
[1:11:50] one man but because here we go
[1:11:54] because it's half this time he has to
[1:11:56] find many men
[1:11:58] because it's half his time so we don't
[1:12:02] need
[1:12:02] less men we need more men
[1:12:05] we need more sons we need more preachers
[1:12:09] we need more sent ones we need more
[1:12:12] anointed man of god
[1:12:14] hallelujah we need men that heard from
[1:12:17] god
[1:12:18] that will go to the angel and take the
[1:12:21] book
[1:12:22] and eat the book and prophesy from the
[1:12:25] book
[1:12:27] [Applause]
[1:12:33] this is hard to deal with that way you
[1:12:35] see because we gone through two thousand
[1:12:37] of these
[1:12:37] national years so what people know is
[1:12:39] church pastors and preachers and people
[1:12:41] teaching bible night stories and whatnot
[1:12:43] the bible was a seal book until brother
[1:12:46] branham come
[1:12:47] all the years people preaching they were
[1:12:49] preaching from the book was sealed
[1:12:51] it took a prophet to unseal it that's
[1:12:53] where we get our message from
[1:12:55] a book that has been unsealed the mighty
[1:12:58] angel brought down the book not closed
[1:13:01] it brought down the book open that means
[1:13:03] all
[1:13:04] seven seas were ripped off don't come
[1:13:06] the angel
[1:13:08] with the book open
[1:13:12] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:13:15] the book is on the earth
[1:13:20] adam is on the act
[1:13:21] [Applause]
[1:13:25] the sons of god are coming back
[1:13:27] [Applause]
[1:13:28] the sons of god are coming back the sons
[1:13:32] of god are coming back
[1:13:35] [Applause]
[1:13:39] what about him he demonstrated what we
[1:13:41] have for the journey
[1:13:43] on our way to the rapture he
[1:13:45] demonstrated it
[1:13:46] son come out and shine four days pour
[1:13:50] over the element

[1:14:01] little fish he had give back your life
[1:14:03] resurrection power he demo listen this
[1:14:06] is already vindicated
[1:14:08] we don't need nobody to say it is wonder
[1:14:11] if it's so it has already been
[1:14:13] vindicated that's a vindication
[1:14:17] the book has been restored
[1:14:21] i will restore
[1:14:27] so what by ram did he restore the bride
[1:14:30] to the full word the token by prophecy
[1:14:40] already you know you may be seated it
[1:14:43] comes like a computer program
[1:14:45] the program is written it's just written
[1:14:47] the press run
[1:14:49] at the appointed time just click and
[1:14:51] everything begin to unfold
[1:14:53] after that program when adam was when
[1:14:56] adam was on the earth
[1:14:57] god was so pleased to get somebody to
[1:14:59] talk to somebody to fellowship with god
[1:15:02] was
[1:15:02] so happy so pleased by the sigma at last
[1:15:05] he had a son
[1:15:06] expressed in his image and likeness
[1:15:08] every evening come down with cool in the
[1:15:10] evening
[1:15:11] talk to his son adam how was your day
[1:15:14] father it's so good
[1:15:15] i shifted this mountain 50 degrees to
[1:15:18] this way
[1:15:19] and i sent that river 10 miles down to
[1:15:21] the left
[1:15:22] adam was having a great time shifting
[1:15:24] things around and moving things are
[1:15:26] wrong and
[1:15:27] naming things are wrong having power
[1:15:28] over this and power over that
[1:15:30] and god says not good for you to be
[1:15:31] alone man you need somebody with you
[1:15:33] i'm going to get a wife for you i'm
[1:15:35] going to get a bride for you i'm going

[1:15:40] he put him in silence
[1:15:41] and for half an hour just making a type
[1:15:43] and afterwards he pulled something out
[1:15:44] of there
[1:15:45] and when adam saw her he said you are
[1:15:46] flesh of my flesh you are born of my
[1:15:48] bone you shall be called woman
[1:15:50] because you were taken out of man oh
[1:15:52] hallelujah praise god what a beautiful
[1:15:54] picture
[1:15:55] in the garden of eden i'll let i want
[1:15:57] you to notice that
[1:15:58] man fell
[1:16:03] it wasn't a boy he put in a gun in he
[1:16:06] put a man
[1:16:08] and the man fell so god said i'm going
[1:16:10] to reboot
[1:16:14] i'm going to reboot this whole system
[1:16:16] i'm going to bring babe
[1:16:18] i'm going to bring on something called
[1:16:19] the process of character development
[1:16:25] because adam didn't have no tests to get
[1:16:26] what he got
[1:16:28] i don't think i'm not trying to get what
[1:16:29] he got god just give him and praise him
[1:16:33] and it didn't work oh give the lord a
[1:16:35] shout
[1:16:36] give the lord a shout god just placed
[1:16:40] him
[1:16:40] and it did not work that man fell
[1:16:44] so god said you know what i'm going to
[1:16:46] reboot i'm going to bring her babe i'm
[1:16:48] going to bring protesting i'm going to
[1:16:49] trial
[1:16:50] the child of your fate i'm going to
[1:16:52] bring destin to give you character
[1:16:54] karate is not a gift character is a
[1:16:56] victory
[1:16:57] so i'm going to send you process
[1:17:02] so here come jesus there come jesus
[1:17:06] holy ghost fell on him
[1:17:09] full anointing fell on him and
[1:17:11] immediately
[1:17:12] first phase first move first thing
[1:17:16] print some business cards to say i am
[1:17:18] jesus no
[1:17:20] no business cards yet first thing
[1:17:23] was to send him into the wilderness to
[1:17:25] overcome the lust of the eyes
[1:17:27] lust of the flesh pride of life in other
[1:17:30] words
[1:17:31] send him in the willingness to overcome
[1:17:33] himself
[1:17:34] before god could give you power
[1:17:37] over others and other things you must
[1:17:40] have power
[1:17:42] over yourself
[1:17:50] i think that with repeating i think that
[1:17:53] would repeat it
[1:17:55] that's why god not releasing power just
[1:17:57] like that
[1:17:58] because it's trouble if it's so much
[1:18:00] trouble no
[1:18:01] much as if god gave people power they
[1:18:03] might speak others out of existence they
[1:18:05] will do all kinetics
[1:18:08] this one do like this one this will not
[1:18:09] fellowship with this one this one can't
[1:18:11] talk to this one
[1:18:12] it will be trouble so god can't do that
[1:18:16] he no no
[1:18:19] you gotta forgive me tonight i'm i'm
[1:18:21] jumping all over
[1:18:22] you may be seated jesus called the
[1:18:25] disciples
[1:18:26] peter come john come he didn't say peter
[1:18:29] bring some of your friends and bring
[1:18:30] them let them come
[1:18:31] so peter have a group a clique coming
[1:18:34] with him no
[1:18:35] jesus called this one that one that one
[1:18:37] that one whether they talking to each
[1:18:39] other like is that that
[1:18:40] has nothing to do with it christ called
[1:18:43] all of them they had to work it out
[1:18:46] fight it out battle it out but they are
[1:18:50] all
[1:18:50] called of god that's the respects we
[1:18:53] must have
[1:18:54] for men that are called of god because
[1:18:57] no man didn't call me
[1:18:59] and no man can't uncall me
[1:19:04] i want to say that again no man then
[1:19:06] call me and they can't take the calling
[1:19:08] off of me
[1:19:09] and they can't take the calling off of
[1:19:10] you so forget it
[1:19:12] don't even think about it what i am
[1:19:15] called to do i've got to do it
[1:19:17] praise what i'm anointed to do i've got
[1:19:18] to do it i can only preach with the
[1:19:20] measure that god gave me
[1:19:22] oh hallelujah that's all i have all i
[1:19:25] have is my sling
[1:19:27] hallelujah and what god give me that's
[1:19:28] what i'm gonna use
[1:19:30] oh praise god so we are waiting for the
[1:19:32] manifestation of the sons of god
[1:19:34] listen who will come back and take it
[1:19:36] over again waiting here we go
[1:19:38] for the fullness of time when the
[1:19:41] pyramid
[1:19:42] gets to the top when the full sons of
[1:19:45] god
[1:19:46] will be manifested when what
[1:19:49] the pyramid comes to the top
[1:19:52] and on top there as far as i remember is
[1:19:54] brotherly kindness
[1:19:55] which is spirit of forgiveness and
[1:19:57] brotherly kindness is a killer
[1:19:59] and i love what god has done he put
[1:20:02] burly kindness in the right spot
[1:20:04] because god knows gonna have feuds and
[1:20:06] corals and forces
[1:20:07] and god will see if you not them not the
[1:20:10] other one
[1:20:11] if you will drop your oats if you will
[1:20:14] forgive
[1:20:14] if you would overcome by the spirit of
[1:20:17] forgiveness
[1:20:18] by putting yourself in your brother's
[1:20:20] place on the matter
[1:20:24] so people talk about faith and they have
[1:20:25] faith in our faith but faith is based
[1:20:27] upon forgiveness
[1:20:28] so if there is no forgiveness what faith
[1:20:30] you're talking about not even faith i
[1:20:32] pray for a headache
[1:20:35] so it has to be the spirit of
[1:20:37] forgiveness
[1:20:38] that brings out the faith in someone oh
[1:20:41] my even if you are right
[1:20:43] and they are wrong are you willing to
[1:20:45] take wrong
[1:20:46] for christ's sake and forgive and have
[1:20:50] that honey
[1:20:51] and have that brotherly kindness because
[1:20:53] it got to be it got to be
[1:20:55] that's what god put for our age our
[1:20:58] agenda books and tips and other
[1:20:59] manifesting them
[1:21:00] if that we win already we we we have
[1:21:03] arrived we gotta hold up our book
[1:21:06] are they talking to the age we have a
[1:21:07] spoken book mac's book one book
[1:21:10] sorry it got to be brotherly kindness
[1:21:13] across our chest it's got to be the life
[1:21:16] for this age do you believe that so
[1:21:19] brother branham says waiting for the
[1:21:20] fullness of time
[1:21:21] when the pyramid will get to the top
[1:21:23] when the full sons of god were
[1:21:25] manifested
[1:21:26] when the power of god will walk out and
[1:21:28] take every power that satan got away
[1:21:30] from him
[1:21:31] notice something to the trumpets
[1:21:33] revelation 10 1-7
[1:21:35] all the mysteries are to be revealed to
[1:21:40] the bride
[1:21:41] by the messenger of the laotian church

[1:21:59] revel no all
[1:22:01] has to be revealed by the prophet
[1:22:05] of malachi 4. it's in the books

[1:22:49] he revealed all six seals but don't say
[1:22:52] nothing about the servant
[1:22:54] and the end time seal that's what he
[1:22:57] called the seven seal
[1:22:58] the end time seal when it starts
[1:23:02] starts it's a total secret
[1:23:05] according to the bible total secret
[1:23:08] at the end of the seven angels message
[1:23:11] all the mysteries of god will be known
[1:23:14] we are at the end time the opening of
[1:23:16] the seventh

[1:23:24] are at
[1:23:25] the opening of the seventh seal he said

[1:24:56] those seven seas will be broke the full
[1:24:58] thing will come into view
[1:25:00] what took place all along the hour of

[1:25:13] revealed our son of man again
[1:25:15] how the church is to be put in order for
[1:25:18] the last day there we go
[1:25:19] no creed no denomination just the
[1:25:23] word living in the individual
[1:25:26] i will take one i would leave one
[1:25:30] no strings no denominations no
[1:25:33] binding is the heart and god alone

[1:25:58] i'm almost finished this part here now
[1:26:03] remember the seventh seal is the end
[1:26:06] time of all things
[1:26:09] the things written in the seven seed
[1:26:10] book it
[1:26:12] is the end is the end of struggling
[1:26:14] world
[1:26:15] is the end of struggling nature is the

[1:26:18] is the end of the vials is the end of
[1:26:20] the earth it even
[1:26:22] ends time time runs out
[1:26:26] now when the angel came down the angels
[1:26:29] swore time shall be no more
[1:26:31] we are about to break from time into
[1:26:33] eternity that angel already swore that
[1:26:38] oh man we are on borrowed time
[1:26:41] and one of the brothers of things about
[1:26:43] the pruitt one of them said there is no
[1:26:45] way out
[1:26:45] think about the pisco and that struck me
[1:26:49] in a way like it never struck me before
[1:26:52] you can't pay your way out of this
[1:26:54] you can't dig down and put some house
[1:26:57] under the ground
[1:26:58] out of this you can't hide from this
[1:27:01] ready or not it's coming there's only
[1:27:04] one way
[1:27:05] that's up what's coming up on the earth
[1:27:08] nothing could stop it
[1:27:10] all glory to god the judgment's already
[1:27:12] set nothing could stop it
[1:27:14] hallelujah there's seven thunder a
[1:27:17] raptor express
[1:27:18] train is stopping at hessin off praise
[1:27:21] god we on our way to the rapture
[1:27:23] oh glory to god get on board get on
[1:27:26] board
[1:27:27] get on board
[1:27:32] hallelujah yes one day
[1:27:36] this same train have a few more steps
[1:27:39] and one day the last passenger
[1:27:42] gonna get on the train there'll be no

[1:28:06] all glory to god we are gonna leave here
[1:28:13] oh hallelujah
[1:28:15] glory to god amen thank you lord
[1:28:20] time shall be no more everything runs
[1:28:22] out
[1:28:23] the end of the seventh seal hallelujah
[1:28:27] but abram said redemption is in two
[1:28:29] parts
[1:28:30] coming out of going into an ephesians
[1:28:34] paralyzed the book of joshua
[1:28:36] and he said now in god ritual mercy now
[1:28:37] then we find out we have come to another
[1:28:39] ephesians
[1:28:40] another ephesians now where our
[1:28:42] intellectual denomination and so forth
[1:28:45] all our educational programs has come to
[1:28:47] its jordan
[1:28:49] we must have an ephesians again
[1:28:52] we must have an exodus to come out
[1:28:56] and go into the rapture now listen to
[1:28:58] this
[1:28:59] because this is a hidden mystery the
[1:29:01] bible only talk about seven ages up to
[1:29:03] laodicea
[1:29:04] but introduce a hidden mystery of our
[1:29:06] age called the bright age
[1:29:09] or the homeland or the eagle age
[1:29:14] or the age that there's going to be
[1:29:15] another ephesians
[1:29:17] what is he talking about let's find out
[1:29:21] so the church world to this day come
[1:29:24] along
[1:29:25] played its part but there is coming a
[1:29:28] time where it must cease
[1:29:30] it must do it there has got to be
[1:29:34] an ephesians of this journey there has
[1:29:37] got to come
[1:29:38] an ephesians and ephesus of this journey
[1:29:42] we are promised here we go are you ready
[1:29:44] according to revelation 10
[1:29:47] according to luke 17 30 there has got to
[1:29:50] come
[1:29:50] an ephesians to this who could reveal
[1:29:53] that
[1:29:55] who could show us that it take a prophet
[1:29:58] to come to prophesy that we could expect
[1:30:02] not a corinthians not a galatians not
[1:30:05] the hebrews
[1:30:06] but an ephesians you will see why
[1:30:09] watch there must come an ephesians to
[1:30:12] this
[1:30:12] there is promising friends that these
[1:30:16] sevenfold mysteries of the word of god
[1:30:18] must be unfolding
[1:30:20] and it's in this laodicea that this
[1:30:22] takes place
[1:30:23] so therefore we luther couldn't get to
[1:30:26] it
[1:30:27] whereas he couldn't get it but now in
[1:30:29] the last days
[1:30:30] we are given to understanding by the
[1:30:32] word that we are going to understand
[1:30:34] it because it will come on ephesians 8
[1:30:36] to it so our ephesians 8
[1:30:38] will bring clarity to the word but
[1:30:41] abraham had to shout
[1:30:42] and he said i wish i had the voice of
[1:30:44] the archangel to bring it to a place
[1:30:46] where you could see it so we have
[1:30:48] promised
[1:30:49] the voice of the archangel to drop down
[1:30:52] to bring clarity to the vision that the
[1:30:55] prophet brought
[1:30:56] habakkuk said write the vision and make
[1:30:59] the vision plain
[1:31:01] the brother brandon brought the
[1:31:02] prophetic vision that the fightful
[1:31:04] ministry
[1:31:05] was supposed to make plain to the people
[1:31:08] [Applause]
[1:31:12] so friends we don't have our own message
[1:31:17] write the vision and make it plain
[1:31:20] that he that read it may run it may have
[1:31:23] an effect upon your life
[1:31:25] hallelujah so he said you're gonna
[1:31:28] you're gonna
[1:31:29] you're going to have it and when it
[1:31:30] comes in the scene to prove what
[1:31:32] there had been many men raised up and
[1:31:34] the time of malachi and matthew 400
[1:31:36] years
[1:31:36] had been great men there was no prophet
[1:31:38] talk about john the baptist
[1:31:40] and to prove he was that ephesians made
[1:31:42] manifest john announced it
[1:31:44] so jesus brought call him the ephesians
[1:31:48] made manifest was jesus christ
[1:31:51] he was the word manifested itself
[1:31:54] oh blessed be the name of the lord and
[1:31:56] this is brother brandon here
[1:31:58] in paradox he said how do you do sir we
[1:32:00] are strangers to each other i don't know
[1:32:01] you
[1:32:02] both of us he says no it would be a
[1:32:04] paradox for something to happen to know
[1:32:06] what was wrong with you
[1:32:08] or something you had done or something
[1:32:10] you ought not to have done he said i
[1:32:12] cannot know it it would have to be a
[1:32:14] paradox
[1:32:14] because there was no way for anyone to
[1:32:16] know that outside of some revelation of
[1:32:18] the unseen
[1:32:19] that's right so here we go
[1:32:22] so that the audience not a show but
[1:32:26] they might see here we go that the
[1:32:28] ephesus
[1:32:29] is here and this is the thing
[1:32:32] that bridges between the nomination and
[1:32:35] glory land
[1:32:37] he promised it so in discernment
[1:32:40] but says not for sure but to prove
[1:32:43] that the ephesus is here this is the
[1:32:47] thing
[1:32:48] that bridges between denomination and
[1:32:50] glory lamb
[1:32:51] so before we go to glory land we have to
[1:32:54] cross a bridge
[1:32:55] called ephesians you see in ephesians
[1:32:58] there's only one lord
[1:32:59] there's only one fate there's only one
[1:33:01] baptism
[1:33:02] in ephesians husband love their wives in
[1:33:05] ephesians children listen to their
[1:33:06] parents
[1:33:07] in ephesians you put in the whole armor
[1:33:08] of god in ephesians you are
[1:33:10] predestinated
[1:33:11] unto adoption in ephesians there's the
[1:33:14] fifo ministry
[1:33:15] in ephesians is your perfection in
[1:33:17] ephesians you're no longer strangers
[1:33:19] or pilgrims but your fellow citizens
[1:33:29] hallelujah and moses only take them up
[1:33:33] to the promised land
[1:33:34] but just what took them over and just
[1:33:36] for his divisions
[1:33:41] so the five four minutes you have to
[1:33:42] take the break into ephesians
[1:33:49] oh my okay let me just go further here
[1:33:52] now
[1:33:53] oh glory to god hallelujah
[1:33:56] jesus in luke 21 24 says and they shall
[1:33:59] fall by the head of the sword
[1:34:01] that shall lead away captive unto
[1:34:02] nations and jerusalem shall be trodden
[1:34:05] down by the gentiles
[1:34:07] until the times of the gentiles
[1:34:10] be fulfilled friends
[1:34:13] the gentiles problem says doesn't have a
[1:34:16] lot of time
[1:34:18] you say the time of the gentile is a
[1:34:19] mystery
[1:34:21] all the bible speaks about is the times
[1:34:23] of the gentiles
[1:34:25] and it also speak about until the
[1:34:26] fullness of the gentiles come in
[1:34:30] but this revelation chapter seven i
[1:34:32] believe it is
[1:34:33] seven angels uh angel angel right from
[1:34:35] the east having the seed of the living
[1:34:37] god
[1:34:38] to seal the hundred and forty four
[1:34:39] thousand going to the jews but before
[1:34:41] god returned to the jews
[1:34:42] you have to close off the gentile
[1:34:45] dispensation
[1:34:46] where are we at tonight when the seal of
[1:34:49] god is about to go across to the jews
[1:34:52] there's got to be a ceiling for the
[1:34:53] gentile bride there's got to be a
[1:34:55] closing time off
[1:34:56] for the gentiles but abraham he says
[1:35:00] romans 11 25 or i'll read scripture
[1:35:03] i would not brethren the ignorant of
[1:35:05] this mystery lisa be wise in your own
[1:35:07] conceits
[1:35:08] that blindness and part is happened to
[1:35:10] israel until the fullness
[1:35:12] of the gentiles come in now from
[1:35:15] recognizing the message but
[1:35:17] the seventh angels message is to open
[1:35:20] the mystery of the seals
[1:35:23] calling the 11th hour gentile workers
[1:35:26] to receive the same pay the first our
[1:35:29] workers got
[1:35:31] that was the purpose to come back to
[1:35:33] same pay
[1:35:34] same signs same wonders same life
[1:35:38] same power that is the promise that's
[1:35:41] the purpose
[1:35:42] of the seals going open up to go back
[1:35:44] you see before we go to rapture we have
[1:35:46] to go back
[1:35:49] they were adopted but rapture time
[1:35:52] wasn't yet
[1:35:52] so they went into the ground we can't go
[1:35:55] forward
[1:35:56] without going back that's why he said
[1:35:58] the prophet was to go back and pick up
[1:35:59] the fate
[1:36:00] then we could go forward for rapture and
[1:36:02] faith wrapped in condition we have to
[1:36:03] pick up the fate that they had
[1:36:05] and the fate that they had wasn't
[1:36:06] debates and arguments and discussion on
[1:36:08] doctrine
[1:36:09] that wasn't the fate that they had they
[1:36:11] had a genuine power
[1:36:12] that was permanent and resident
[1:36:16] oh give the lord some praises
[1:36:20] it wasn't temporary power it was
[1:36:23] permanent residing power
[1:36:27] virtual power hallelujah glorious power
[1:36:31] apostolic power they had power
[1:36:34] they received power jesus promised them
[1:36:37] power and they had it
[1:36:39] this pride will have nothing less than
[1:36:41] that
[1:36:42] [Applause]
[1:36:46] oh hallelujah give the lord a shout
[1:36:57] say what there was a dark age that
[1:36:59] blocked them out then in the middle of
[1:37:00] the age looter wesley
[1:37:02] and there's to be an evening time
[1:37:03] message to receive the same thing the
[1:37:05] even time
[1:37:06] message is to restore back again or
[1:37:08] bring back the same thing
[1:37:09] oh brother give me a church full of the
[1:37:11] holy ghost
[1:37:12] god will do in one year what all
[1:37:15] theology fails to do in two thousand
[1:37:16] years
[1:37:17] you it till the anointing of the church
[1:37:20] strike home
[1:37:22] after the doors of the gentile is closed
[1:37:26] god will anoint the church of them him
[1:37:29] that is filled to be filthy still
[1:37:31] him that is righteously righteous still
[1:37:33] him as holy be holy still
[1:37:35] but always coming upon us and i picked
[1:37:37] it to a picture being snapped
[1:37:38] you caught filthy and snapped and that's
[1:37:40] the picture freeze right there
[1:37:44] you've got righteous freeze right there
[1:37:46] right you're still
[1:37:48] filthy still holy still go just take a
[1:37:50] picture that's it whatever condition you
[1:37:52] caught him that's it
[1:37:54] what are we living in daniel
[1:37:57] baran say he wasn't a gentile he was not
[1:37:58] a gentile but he saw the gentiles rise
[1:38:00] and fall he wasn't a gentile but he saw
[1:38:03] the gentile
[1:38:04] dispensation from start to finish from
[1:38:07] the head of goal ending up to the feet
[1:38:08] of iron
[1:38:08] clay and he said danny was reading
[1:38:12] what the same was we were reading this
[1:38:13] morning and he took
[1:38:15] words from jeremiah the prophet and
[1:38:17] daniel began to realize it's just two
[1:38:19] more years left
[1:38:21] to get out and he set himself in order
[1:38:23] to pray
[1:38:24] and then buddha brahman says and i pray
[1:38:26] to love but i say my inspiration about
[1:38:28] praying
[1:38:29] god if there ever was a time we ought to
[1:38:31] set ourselves to pray
[1:38:32] as we s his true servants we see by
[1:38:35] letters of the apostle
[1:38:36] by the warnings of the holy spirit with
[1:38:38] the last days the holy spirit speaks
[1:38:41] that in the last days men shall be
[1:38:42] headed high-minded lovers of pleasures
[1:38:44] modern lovers of god we understand that
[1:38:46] there's comes coughs in the last days
[1:38:48] i understand nation shall be against
[1:38:50] nation i understand women will pop their
[1:38:52] head off and wear
[1:38:53] short clothes and hide his shoes i
[1:38:55] understand more will be so low in the
[1:38:57] last days
[1:38:58] i understand preachers will be false
[1:39:00] shepherds in the last days
[1:39:01] that will compromise will not feed the
[1:39:03] people the word of god
[1:39:05] go after creeds and things instead but i
[1:39:07] understand there'll be a voice
[1:39:09] come in the last days crying out to go
[1:39:12] back to the original message back to the
[1:39:16] things of god i understand here we go
[1:39:19] that there will be a famine the churches
[1:39:21] will be so organized like they are today
[1:39:24] in this message that in the last days
[1:39:27] there will come a famine
[1:39:28] it will not be for bread and water only
[1:39:30] but for the hearing
[1:39:32] of the true word of god he's not talking
[1:39:34] about books and tapes that have tons of
[1:39:35] that
[1:39:37] so he's not talking about that he's
[1:39:38] talking about hearing
[1:39:40] the truth of god and people go from the
[1:39:42] east to the west not salt to hear the
[1:39:44] true word of god
[1:39:45] and they are so organized and tighten up
[1:39:47] that they will fail to hear it
[1:39:49] i understand my book i understand
[1:39:52] that that will take place just before
[1:39:55] the spirit
[1:39:56] leaves the gentile church to return to
[1:40:00] the jews
[1:40:01] hallelujah are you with me could we take
[1:40:04] a little more tonight almost true
[1:40:06] the law failed moses failed
[1:40:09] joshua took over and the holy spirit
[1:40:13] will come into the church this is the
[1:40:16] promise
[1:40:18] not men not organization
[1:40:22] he says but the holy spirit will
[1:40:25] get among the people and make her ready
[1:40:28] to go up
[1:40:30] and cross jordan oh hallelujah praise
[1:40:33] god do you believe that hallelujah
[1:40:37] praise the name of the lord blessed be
[1:40:40] the name of the lord
[1:40:42] so god blinded israel
[1:40:46] purposely but abram says for you and i
[1:40:49] they cannot see because god blinded them
[1:40:52] to finish the transgression god cut them
[1:40:55] off purposely and blinding their eyes
[1:40:57] so we could get a chance to see and give
[1:40:59] us an opportunity
[1:41:00] and we walk around like we are somebody
[1:41:03] paul tell them here take heed how you do
[1:41:06] that
[1:41:07] take heed for if god spared not the
[1:41:09] natural branch
[1:41:10] how will he have any more mercy on the
[1:41:12] wild branch
[1:41:13] and we walk around say i'm presbyterian
[1:41:16] i am methodist
[1:41:17] i am baptist i am pentecostal that don't
[1:41:20] mean nothing to god
[1:41:22] you have got to be born again by the
[1:41:24] holy spirit
[1:41:26] oh daniel shut up the words and see the
[1:41:28] book till the time of the end seal it up
[1:41:30] till the time of the end close up the
[1:41:31] words and steal the book what did he do
[1:41:34] he sealed up the vision and prophecy but
[1:41:36] ibrahim said that
[1:41:37] now the gentiles wasn't allotted any
[1:41:40] time
[1:41:40] he just said the time of the gentiles
[1:41:42] and we find out that jesus didn't even
[1:41:44] lock them at times
[1:41:46] oh my hallelujah for jerusalem shall be
[1:41:50] trotted down
[1:41:51] of the gentiles until the time of the
[1:41:53] gentiles be fulfilled
[1:41:54] then there is a lot of time but nobody
[1:41:57] knows when it will be it's a mystery
[1:42:00] remember in the time of the persecution
[1:42:04] there will be millions of gentiles will
[1:42:07] die
[1:42:08] that rejected bride the remnant of the
[1:42:11] woman's seed
[1:42:12] the sleeping vision many places but i'm
[1:42:14] saying millions
[1:42:15] will die oh hallelujah
[1:42:18] praise god you know what daniel saw
[1:42:21] right a stone cut out without the hands
[1:42:22] of man
[1:42:23] man it not bringing that stone that
[1:42:26] stone came out without the hands of man
[1:42:28] and brown said what happened at that
[1:42:30] time he said daniels
[1:42:32] he watched a gentile age until the stone
[1:42:34] out of the mountain that wasn't cut with
[1:42:35] hands
[1:42:36] they never put a capsule on the pyramid
[1:42:38] so he's tying them with the capsule now
[1:42:39] ah are we getting somewhere but ram
[1:42:41] tying it with the capstone the clothes
[1:42:43] of the age
[1:42:44] we're looking for power we're looking
[1:42:45] for capstone we're looking for dynamics
[1:42:46] but here's all together
[1:42:47] he said watch he said no the stone they
[1:42:50] never put a capsule on that pyramid
[1:42:51] it wasn't caught up by man's hand it's
[1:42:53] god's hand that cut that stone
[1:42:55] what did it do it hit the image right
[1:42:57] smack in the feet and broke it up the
[1:42:59] pieces
[1:43:00] what happened at that time the coming of
[1:43:02] that stone up
[1:43:03] when the church in the glory of the
[1:43:04] rapture caused it ended
[1:43:06] the gentile dispensation god ended it up
[1:43:10] with the coming of that stone so the
[1:43:12] coming of dynamics to the mechanics
[1:43:14] the coming of the capstone that going to
[1:43:16] end the gentile dispensation
[1:43:18] the baptism of the holy ghost with gifts
[1:43:21] cannot move the bride
[1:43:22] it will protect charity it will take
[1:43:25] dynamics
[1:43:26] it will take the power it will take
[1:43:28] christ the person of the holy ghost
[1:43:29] himself oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:43:33] he christ is that stone he is he watch
[1:43:36] and the church calls the strength of the
[1:43:38] headstone run to the church like a
[1:43:40] magnet
[1:43:40] and the headstone is the holy ghost what
[1:43:43] the heck son is
[1:43:44] it's the holy ghost and every one of us
[1:43:47] that
[1:43:48] have the here we go the magnetism of the
[1:43:50] holy ghost
[1:43:51] when that stone strike the image it will
[1:43:53] flee to it
[1:43:54] and will be taken back into glory so you
[1:43:57] have to have something in you
[1:43:58] that the holy ghost could connect with
[1:44:00] he didn't say what
[1:44:01] doctrine you have he said the magnetism
[1:44:05] of the holy ghost it's got to be in you
[1:44:08] when that big
[1:44:08] magnet begins to sweep over the world it
[1:44:11] must pick you up
[1:44:12] because you are magnetized hallelujah
[1:44:15] with the magnetism
[1:44:16] of the holy ghost oh glory to god
[1:44:19] hallelujah hallelujah praise the name of
[1:44:22] the lord
[1:44:24] hallelujah hallelujah praise god
[1:44:28] hallelujah hallelujah how that magnet is
[1:44:31] coming down
[1:44:32] that magnet coming down to kill you pick
[1:44:34] you up oh glory to god hallelujah
[1:44:37] hallelujah glory to god
[1:44:40] brother branham he is the dynamics of
[1:44:43] the mechanics
[1:44:44] the mechanics of the church what is it
[1:44:45] apostles prophets teachers
[1:44:48] fight for ministry becomes god mechanics
[1:44:50] on earth and he could work that
[1:44:52] mechanics
[1:44:53] because god couldn't use a pentecostal
[1:44:54] because we're just spirit upon men
[1:44:56] flesh but god changes operations he says
[1:44:59] i'm going to use the word in men
[1:45:00] so you put the word in men and men
[1:45:02] become a channel of god
[1:45:04] that the fire of god could flow through
[1:45:06] them adoption time i don't have the code
[1:45:08] for it
[1:45:08] quran says where you could say dear is
[1:45:10] my spirit flowing freely not doctrine
[1:45:12] not teaching we are teaching for years
[1:45:14] mechanics for years explanation for
[1:45:16] years testimonies for years
[1:45:17] you're not talking about that talking
[1:45:19] about a man so died out
[1:45:20] a channel a pipe of god a channel of
[1:45:23] communication
[1:45:24] for inspiration to flow through fire
[1:45:27] coming out of the man's mouth
[1:45:28] how do holy ghost fallen upon them that
[1:45:31] heard the word
[1:45:32] what happened peter is in the body he's
[1:45:34] a channel of god
[1:45:35] he's a branch of god connected to the
[1:45:38] vine of god
[1:45:39] producing the fruit of god being
[1:45:41] glorified god
[1:45:46] hallelujah glory to god
[1:45:50] my lord my lord praise god praise god
[1:45:55] wow now the spirit
[1:45:59] the dynamics of the promised word
[1:46:02] to get into his church and drive them to
[1:46:06] calvary under
[1:46:07] unto the rapture there you are so before
[1:46:09] you go into the rapture
[1:46:11] there's a cross
[1:46:14] see you so quiet again because the cross
[1:46:18] super church super race everybody on
[1:46:20] fire and so on but the dynamics
[1:46:23] going to drive you you have got to die
[1:46:27] i think you're long in the message i
[1:46:29] think how much books you have i must
[1:46:31] tell you're going to die
[1:46:32] [Applause]
[1:46:35] you're all going to die drive us to
[1:46:37] calvary
[1:46:39] oh hallelujah and then into the rapture
[1:46:42] a man is permitted to travel so far but
[1:46:45] it's a separation line between life and
[1:46:46] death
[1:46:47] he must never cross you can go on with a
[1:46:49] little foolishness for a while
[1:46:51] but you better know where that line is
[1:46:54] did the lord ever check you on anything
[1:46:56] pull you up on anything say that's fine
[1:46:58] enough
[1:46:59] oh hallelujah you better be careful
[1:47:02] oh blessed be the name of the lord so
[1:47:05] god
[1:47:06] never did god use a group every time any
[1:47:09] group organized god
[1:47:10] left it praise god therefore during the
[1:47:12] reformation they come right from
[1:47:14] reformers as this embassy will prove we
[1:47:16] find the scripture in malachi 4 this
[1:47:18] feast of the trumpets
[1:47:20] that there is to be an anointing come
[1:47:22] down
[1:47:23] to restore again the original fate
[1:47:26] to bring faith to the people to the
[1:47:28] original pentecostal that anointing
[1:47:30] have to come down and i believe that the
[1:47:33] age has come now
[1:47:35] where the miraculous the phenomenal the
[1:47:38] baptism of the spirit the power the
[1:47:40] signs the wonders
[1:47:41] this great point out of god's spirit
[1:47:45] in the last days that's the thing
[1:47:48] that will bring faith into the people
[1:47:51] that will take our rapture and faith and
[1:47:54] take the church into the glory
[1:47:55] so we could cry we could sigh we could
[1:47:58] sing
[1:47:59] that's not what the prophet said he said
[1:48:01] this is the thing
[1:48:02] the holy spirit the spirit have to begin
[1:48:05] to move
[1:48:06] the spirit has to begin to fall this is
[1:48:08] what god promised
[1:48:09] all i could preach is promises this
[1:48:12] message is a message of promises
[1:48:14] i didn't come to bring my feelings to
[1:48:15] you i didn't come to bring a dream to
[1:48:17] you
[1:48:18] i come to bring a dust here the lord
[1:48:20] promised from a 20th century prophet
[1:48:23] to you
[1:48:28] you see even if you don't see it the way
[1:48:30] we said it still doesn't change what he
[1:48:32] said
[1:48:34] oh hallelujah question
[1:48:37] okay wow
[1:48:41] question answers if the church is saved
[1:48:44] even though she doesn't go to the
[1:48:45] rapture and i believe you taught
[1:48:47] she must go through the tribulation for
[1:48:49] purifying what about these that are dead
[1:48:51] how will they be purified
[1:48:52] the bride don't need no purification
[1:48:56] she's already purified those that are
[1:48:59] dead back there
[1:49:00] they never receive the light that these
[1:49:03] church open has received
[1:49:04] they live by justification and
[1:49:06] sanctification
[1:49:08] like that they live to the light that
[1:49:10] they had
[1:49:11] maybe in a way they suffered whatever
[1:49:13] they went through
[1:49:14] with their persecutions here we go but
[1:49:18] now in this
[1:49:21] rapture in time like this there will
[1:49:24] have to come a time
[1:49:26] now that this bride that rejects the
[1:49:29] head part of the bride
[1:49:31] now he's talking about the church he's
[1:49:33] talking about the church in this message
[1:49:35] that reject the head part of the bride
[1:49:37] listen listen
[1:49:39] in this rapture in time there will come
[1:49:42] a time
[1:49:43] that the bride that reject the head part
[1:49:46] of the bride
[1:49:48] will have to suffer for her rejection
[1:49:50] because the gospel wasn't made plain
[1:49:52] back there
[1:49:53] like it being made plain to you you see
[1:49:56] it's so plain you have had all these
[1:49:57] years
[1:49:58] examples the sea is open the church is
[1:50:00] laid out
[1:50:01] everything else it's so plain you can't
[1:50:03] miss it so then if you fully reject it
[1:50:06] there's only one thing to do suffer for
[1:50:08] it
[1:50:09] so after the bride was raptured
[1:50:12] will any of the foolish virgins be saved
[1:50:14] or will they be lost no
[1:50:17] everything will be finished for the
[1:50:18] gentile church
[1:50:20] when the bride is taking off the earth
[1:50:22] the spirit of god
[1:50:25] leaves the earth here this filthy be
[1:50:28] filthy still
[1:50:29] he that is righteous is righteous still
[1:50:32] here is holy is holy still
[1:50:34] in other words the sanctuary becomes
[1:50:36] smoky
[1:50:37] the attorney stands to plead the case
[1:50:40] christ
[1:50:40] leaves the sanctuary his day of material
[1:50:43] work is over
[1:50:45] the rapture comes and there is no more
[1:50:48] miracle work
[1:50:50] christ comes to claim his material work
[1:50:53] now just me in a minute will the foolish
[1:50:55] virgin be saved no
[1:50:57] whatever happens now after that
[1:51:01] she will have to go through the
[1:51:04] tribulation period
[1:51:06] and this is the bomb and the reason of
[1:51:09] it is
[1:51:10] because she has rejected
[1:51:13] the atonement in its fullness
[1:51:18] now this is very important these words
[1:51:21] are
[1:51:21] very important he didn't say that she
[1:51:24] rejected the atonement
[1:51:25] no she rejected the atonement in its
[1:51:29] fullness let's continue she is a
[1:51:32] professed believer
[1:51:34] but she will have to go through the
[1:51:36] tribulation period
[1:51:38] but for recognizing today's message
[1:51:41] don't want moses
[1:51:42] and elijah same condition he said death
[1:51:44] doesn't do anything to a man but changes
[1:51:46] dwell in place
[1:51:47] death doesn't change in your nature it
[1:51:50] doesn't change
[1:51:51] your it doesn't change your fate it
[1:51:53] doesn't change nothing in you
[1:51:55] but your dwelling place so which way
[1:51:57] your nature is this morning
[1:51:59] if you're thought of god's word you
[1:52:00] won't be a you would be a doctor over
[1:52:02] there
[1:52:02] i don't care who you are how you live
[1:52:05] how good you live
[1:52:06] it wouldn't change you one bit to die
[1:52:08] just your dwelling place
[1:52:10] and if you can't accept the whole word
[1:52:12] of god
[1:52:13] the way it is written you wouldn't do it
[1:52:15] over there don't worry you won't be
[1:52:17] there
[1:52:18] you have got to accept it in its
[1:52:20] fullness
[1:52:21] in the power of its vindication and the
[1:52:24] revelation of what it is
[1:52:26] then you become part of it you have to
[1:52:29] accept it in its fullness
[1:52:31] in its vindication and its revelation
[1:52:34] then you are part of it oh hallelujah
[1:52:37] oh glory to god let's continue these are
[1:52:40] the trumpets
[1:52:42] it's the end time the greedy of the lord
[1:52:43] is at him
[1:52:45] the feast of the messiah now in
[1:52:47] revelation 11
[1:52:49] talking about moses of elijah calling
[1:52:51] israel out of jewish tradition
[1:52:53] just as the seventh angels message
[1:52:56] called the bright out of pentecostal
[1:52:57] tradition
[1:52:59] moses and elijah is to call israel out
[1:53:02] of the old atonement of lamb and sheep
[1:53:04] unto the real living sacrifice to the
[1:53:07] word
[1:53:08] and the seventh angel's message under
[1:53:11] the same
[1:53:12] trumpet same every same seal is to call
[1:53:16] the people the bride
[1:53:17] here we go out of the pentecostal world
[1:53:20] tradition
[1:53:21] to the genuine atonement the word
[1:53:25] christ impersonated in his word made
[1:53:28] flesh among us
[1:53:30] now here we go he's repeating himself
[1:53:33] the same as those two prophets did
[1:53:34] remember
[1:53:36] the gentile bride is to have a prophet
[1:53:38] called elias
[1:53:40] elijah to call them out of their
[1:53:42] tradition the bride
[1:53:44] just the same as these prophets called
[1:53:46] the jews out of judaism
[1:53:48] the christ the atonement and the
[1:53:50] gentiles
[1:53:51] here we go the gentiles already knows
[1:53:54] the atonement
[1:53:56] so the atonement is not the issue that's
[1:53:59] why i told you note
[1:54:00] he used the word fullness of the
[1:54:02] atonement the atonement is not the issue
[1:54:04] he said it is a call the bride back to
[1:54:07] the original atonement
[1:54:09] that's the difference all the
[1:54:11] pentecostal know jesus died for my sins
[1:54:13] christ is the atonement he's not talking
[1:54:14] about that he's talking about your
[1:54:16] recent atonement
[1:54:17] back to the day of pentecost
[1:54:21] hallelujah the fullness of the atonement
[1:54:24] speaking about the bride she spin from
[1:54:26] the church from the church body
[1:54:28] they cut her off soon from a master just
[1:54:30] like joseph was spitting from the
[1:54:32] brethren
[1:54:32] because he was the word jesus was
[1:54:34] spinning on the brethren because he was
[1:54:36] the word the church is spitting
[1:54:37] the bride is spitting from the church oh
[1:54:40] hallelujah
[1:54:41] oh blessed be the name of the lord from
[1:54:44] invisible you and the bride
[1:54:45] he said you remember the grain begin to
[1:54:47] ripen you find
[1:54:48] before the grain can ripen everything in
[1:54:51] this talk has to be dead
[1:54:53] can't you see where you're standing life
[1:54:55] is in the green again
[1:54:56] the same word sucked up these come to
[1:54:59] here up to a head
[1:55:00] and all the life oh i love this all
[1:55:04] the life not teachings not doctrines
[1:55:08] all the life that come through here

[1:55:12] so the life of paul arenas martin
[1:55:14] columba
[1:55:15] luta the life you see that magnet coming
[1:55:17] over to pick up its people
[1:55:19] oh glory to god what are they picking up
[1:55:20] for before the rapture oh hallelujah
[1:55:23] it is forming into a head for the
[1:55:25] rapture oh blessed be the name of the
[1:55:27] lord

[1:55:29] comfort a revival of the just
[1:55:31] and a great power come on the church
[1:55:33] just before it's going it's not too hard
[1:55:35] to pray that
[1:55:35] because you promised that we are looking
[1:55:37] for that for that third pull
[1:55:39] that we know will do great things among
[1:55:41] us what he's talking about a great power
[1:55:43] a great revival a revival of the just oh
[1:55:46] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:55:47] so this restitution i'm almost done this
[1:55:50] restitution the act of restoring
[1:55:52] to the rightful owner what has been
[1:55:54] taken away and barbara
[1:55:55] says if a man lost his inheritance and a
[1:55:58] squatter come on his land
[1:56:00] he could not hold it any longer until 50
[1:56:03] years
[1:56:04] after 50 years a jubilee came by and the
[1:56:07] year of jubilee
[1:56:08] when the year of jubilee come everything
[1:56:11] went back
[1:56:12] to the original the beginning at the
[1:56:14] beginning all
[1:56:15] slaves they went back to the original
[1:56:17] beginning if a man was holding in the
[1:56:18] field
[1:56:19] and the trumpet song and he heard it he
[1:56:20] chewed on his hole and said i'm no more
[1:56:22] slave
[1:56:23] i'm going back to my family everything
[1:56:26] that he had
[1:56:26] had to be given back oh praise god do
[1:56:29] you believe that
[1:56:30] now if some individual lost inheritance
[1:56:34] that was given to them by god there come
[1:56:36] a year called the jubilee year
[1:56:38] isn't that right and in this jubilee
[1:56:40] every man that
[1:56:41] lost his inheritance he was a freeborn a
[1:56:44] true blooded israelite
[1:56:45] no matter listen no matter who held the
[1:56:48] possession
[1:56:49] it had to come back to him he had to go
[1:56:52] free
[1:56:52] he didn't have to pay a thing he just
[1:56:54] had to stop what he was doing and go
[1:56:56] back
[1:56:56] to his inheritance listen he has a right
[1:56:59] to it
[1:57:00] it was a god-given right because by
[1:57:03] grace
[1:57:03] he has inherited it and it would be
[1:57:05] given to his fathers and hanging out
[1:57:07] year after year no matter what taking
[1:57:09] place if he lost it
[1:57:10] he must go free it meant grace has
[1:57:13] provided a way for each individual
[1:57:16] to return to their rightful inheritance
[1:57:18] and the jubilee
[1:57:19] was god's manner of expressing grace
[1:57:22] to his people for restoring or bringing
[1:57:26] back one
[1:57:26] to their rightful condition so when you
[1:57:29] can't make it through go and have a
[1:57:30] jubilee year
[1:57:31] just for you brother branham said the
[1:57:34] power of god was taken back to the
[1:57:36] original 50th day
[1:57:37] the year of jubilee when all things went
[1:57:38] back are you ready
[1:57:41] for the prophecy are you ready for the
[1:57:44] prophecy
[1:57:45] there will come another year of jubilee
[1:57:51] oh
[1:57:52] hallelujah listen to this watch
[1:57:55] and we have added if you notice
[1:57:57] pentecost has been failing in america
[1:57:58] for 50 years
[1:57:59] and about 50 years pentecost began to
[1:58:01] fall know what's happening the church

[1:58:06] revelation of jesus christ
