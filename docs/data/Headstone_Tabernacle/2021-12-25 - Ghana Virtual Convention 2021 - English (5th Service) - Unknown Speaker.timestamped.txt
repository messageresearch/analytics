[52:10] john identified him on that day
[52:14] and he said behold the lamb of god which
[52:17] taketh away the sins of the world
[52:21] and friends we too in this day and age
[52:23] have got to identify the lamb of god
[52:27] and recognize your day in his
[52:30] message because the lamb of god is the
[52:34] word
[52:36] is the holy spirit amen amen it's the
[52:40] fullness
[52:41] of what has been revealed to us in this
[52:44] our day that's the true lamb of god
[52:48] amen we're not talking about a measure
[52:50] of the word we're not talking about
[52:53] amen a good sermon but god
[52:58] sent a prophet
[52:59] and he
[53:01] told us we now have
[53:04] the perfect interpretation
[53:07] of the word
[53:09] with divine vindication
[53:13] not only is the word true
[53:16] but it's vindicated
[53:18] hallelujah to the lamb
[53:20] so today
[53:21] as members of the fifo ministry
[53:25] we are not ashamed of the words of the
[53:28] son of man amen
[53:30] we're not
[53:31] ashamed of the son of man nor his words
[53:34] because we preach
[53:36] a vindicated message yes sir praise be
[53:39] to god
[53:40] we don't have to ever preach and go home
[53:43] and wonder whether things will
[53:45] take place
[53:47] amen they have already prophetically
[53:49] taken place
[53:51] amen because this message amen is a
[53:54] prophetic message praise be to god and
[53:57] just before you stand i just wanted to
[53:59] greet
[54:00] uh brother solomon
[54:03] nachina
[54:04] from the life
[54:06] tabernacle in ghana
[54:08] uh tamale i believe it's pronounced
[54:11] tamale
[54:12] if i don't have that quite right please
[54:15] forgive me
[54:16] amen this uh we were asked to make a
[54:19] video
[54:21] which they will
[54:23] be playing during their
[54:26] december convention
[54:28] we pray and we trust that god will bless
[54:30] you
[54:32] in a special way we
[54:34] send greetings to you
[54:36] to your pastor your church uh there
[54:40] the helps the governments the people who
[54:43] are waiting
[54:44] on
[54:45] the coming of the lord amen
[54:48] i want to let you know
[54:50] here in this little place original faith
[54:54] gospel tabernacle
[54:56] we have a group here that are waiting
[54:58] for the coming of the lord
[55:01] amen and distance may have separated us
[55:05] physically but we're not separated in
[55:08] spirit because we're one in spirit and
[55:11] in truth if we're preaching the same
[55:13] thing
[55:14] amen and if god has revealed to us the
[55:17] same thing therefore we're not really
[55:20] far
[55:21] uh in spirit amen so
[55:24] for us it is a great blessing
[55:26] it is a great honor to share this little
[55:29] thought
[55:30] uh this morning with you
[55:32] and i have my
[55:34] time clock on you just turned on
[55:37] and uh so
[55:39] we will be uh speaking to you
[55:42] for about an hour or so
[55:44] and this time i have to because this is
[55:47] a meeting
[55:48] uh and i don't want to take the precious
[55:51] believer's time
[55:52] amen although
[55:54] locally here we
[55:57] know that an hour
[55:59] is not enough actually
[56:01] amen you get into speaking about the
[56:03] wonderful things and promises of god
[56:05] amen
[56:07] and you know when you go to a ball game
[56:09] or whatever the sports uh the sports
[56:11] world
[56:12] i mean time means nothing of course they
[56:14] do have a time
[56:16] in which they um
[56:19] set
[56:20] and it never actually
[56:23] is the time that they set you know you
[56:26] play a football game or whatever it may
[56:28] be and and each quarter has a certain
[56:31] designated time
[56:33] but you add up all the time at the end
[56:35] of the game it goes way over what they
[56:38] designated for
[56:39] but and you know no one's complaining oh
[56:41] bless god it went over uh you know
[56:43] because they're in the game
[56:45] amen they want to see who won
[56:48] you know so therefore i'm so thankful
[56:50] that uh
[56:51] you know it's hard to kind of put jesus
[56:54] and the word into
[56:56] a time slot and frame because he's
[56:59] beyond time
[57:00] amen he's eternal
[57:02] so
[57:03] i want to also say this before we get
[57:06] into the message
[57:08] that i want to greet all the ministers
[57:10] in the wonderful name of jesus christ
[57:12] and that uh young lady that you heard
[57:16] singing this morning was my wife
[57:19] amen rebecca robledo the best singer in
[57:22] town
[57:23] in my
[57:24] opinion
[57:26] amen yes
[57:28] best singer in town
[57:30] and uh so therefore been singing a long
[57:33] time we were talking about uh the other
[57:35] day you know it's been 40 uh what
[57:39] 41 years
[57:41] or so
[57:42] uh married and in the ministry and yet
[57:46] and yet um we
[57:48] are so thankful
[57:51] for all that god has uh done for us
[57:54] he's been faithful
[57:56] he has taken us through
[57:58] uh hard times good times and we all have
[58:01] so much to thank god for
[58:03] amen and i wouldn't trade this time for
[58:07] any other time
[58:09] because this time we are nearing the
[58:13] coming of the lord amen amen and the one
[58:16] that we loved and the one that we have
[58:19] read about the one that we have uh pray
[58:22] to
[58:23] will come
[58:24] become visible among us amen and we'll
[58:27] see him one day soon amen and what a day
[58:31] that's gonna be
[58:32] and i'm so thankful for that so god
[58:35] richly bless you all the ministers
[58:37] although i have not been
[58:39] uh seen in public too much
[58:42] uh i am alive and well
[58:45] we are here every sunday
[58:47] uh morning preaching the gospel of jesus
[58:50] christ
[58:51] amen so i am alive and well and of
[58:55] course with the covet situation we all
[58:58] know that you're
[58:59] limited in travel and limited in uh
[59:02] various things that you have to do
[59:04] and i do have a job now which i have to
[59:07] uh attend to besides preaching the
[59:10] gospel just about every weekend
[59:13] uh so but we are live we are well and i
[59:17] want to let every uh believer and every
[59:21] pastor and church
[59:23] know that we are fine here and if you
[59:26] ever
[59:27] uh come around new york city
[59:30] uh look us up amen we'll be glad to uh
[59:33] greet you
[59:34] amen and if possible have fellowship
[59:36] with you around the word of god so let
[59:40] us now stand to our feet
[59:43] and we will
[59:44] going to uh we are going to speak on
[59:47] this subject
[59:48] uh this morning of the
[59:50] [Music]
[59:52] uh yeah go out and meet the bridegroom
[59:56] go out and meet the bridegroom
[59:59] amen what a wonderful
[1:00:01] inspiration that our brother solomon had
[1:00:05] amen because we realized that if we're
[1:00:08] asked to go to meet the bridegroom
[1:00:11] well there's a way to go out and meet
[1:00:13] him and we just not can't we we can't
[1:00:18] casually meet him
[1:00:20] uh without
[1:00:21] well let's get into this scripture and
[1:00:24] then we will find out that there is a
[1:00:26] distinct difference between the foolish
[1:00:29] and the wise versions
[1:00:32] because they're both
[1:00:34] you have the five
[1:00:36] uh well they were all versions number
[1:00:38] one
[1:00:40] five of them were wise
[1:00:42] and the other five were foolish
[1:00:46] they all had lamps
[1:00:48] so they all from the outside
[1:00:51] uh
[1:00:52] outside appearance all look
[1:00:55] like the same
[1:00:56] and they were all versions which show
[1:00:58] that they were uh you know
[1:01:01] good people
[1:01:03] but there was a very
[1:01:05] uh important distinction
[1:01:10] that made
[1:01:12] that separated them
[1:01:15] and
[1:01:15] allotted one or half of them to be
[1:01:18] foolish
[1:01:19] and the other half to be wise
[1:01:22] and we're going to find out
[1:01:24] why
[1:01:26] by the grace of the holy spirit
[1:01:29] it is so important
[1:01:31] to make sure
[1:01:33] that we have oil
[1:01:35] in our lamps
[1:01:37] because we realize that that
[1:01:40] the only difference
[1:01:42] between the wise and the foolish
[1:01:46] versions
[1:01:47] were
[1:01:48] was the oil
[1:01:50] or the lack of oil so
[1:01:52] reading now
[1:01:54] from matthew chapter 25
[1:01:58] and we'll start with the first verse
[1:02:02] then shall the kingdom of heaven be
[1:02:05] likened unto 10 virgins
[1:02:08] which took their lamps
[1:02:10] and went forth
[1:02:12] to meet
[1:02:14] the bridegroom
[1:02:16] how many took their lamps
[1:02:19] 10.
[1:02:20] so you couldn't tell them apart
[1:02:23] by counting
[1:02:25] uh
[1:02:26] the versions or the lamps they all went
[1:02:29] out together
[1:02:31] and five of them were wise and the other
[1:02:33] one were foolish
[1:02:36] all right we can
[1:02:38] then
[1:02:40] ask a question why
[1:02:42] in verse two
[1:02:44] why was half of them or five of them
[1:02:46] wise
[1:02:47] and the other five foolish
[1:02:50] verse three
[1:02:51] they that were foolish took
[1:02:54] their lambs
[1:02:56] and took no oil
[1:02:59] with them
[1:03:01] but the wise took oil
[1:03:04] in their vessels
[1:03:06] with
[1:03:07] their lamps
[1:03:09] and while the bridegroom tarried
[1:03:12] they all slumbered and slept
[1:03:15] and we realized how brother branham he
[1:03:17] spoke about
[1:03:18] how um
[1:03:21] the bride
[1:03:23] as it were throughout the ages is slept
[1:03:25] that had to be awakened
[1:03:27] amen and this end time message was an
[1:03:31] end time of behold
[1:03:33] the bridegroom cometh
[1:03:35] amen and all those sleeping uh virgins
[1:03:38] whether they're foolish your wives would
[1:03:40] have had to uh uh you know listen to
[1:03:43] that message
[1:03:44] because when malachi 4 comes on the
[1:03:47] scene amen
[1:03:49] christ is to follow amen praise be to
[1:03:52] god he was the one that woke up the
[1:03:54] bride
[1:03:55] amen so therefore through a message
[1:03:58] wow though a bridegroom tarried all of
[1:04:01] them slumbered
[1:04:03] and at midnight there was a cry
[1:04:08] now
[1:04:09] i guess they probably
[1:04:12] just looking at this in the background
[1:04:14] these uh wise and foolish versions
[1:04:17] they probably waited for quite some time
[1:04:21] and they didn't see the bridegroom
[1:04:24] anywhere to be found and
[1:04:26] some well
[1:04:28] figured that they can get some rest and
[1:04:30] he'll probably come tomorrow
[1:04:32] you see but this is where we let our
[1:04:35] guards down
[1:04:36] because we
[1:04:38] don't know the hour or the day
[1:04:41] or the time you see
[1:04:43] but we have to be ready when he comes
[1:04:47] now isn't that that's a little challenge
[1:04:50] because if somebody said you know i'm
[1:04:52] gonna come meet you
[1:04:54] you know at uh at a certain place
[1:04:59] be there be ready
[1:05:01] but i'm not telling you when i'm coming
[1:05:04] [Music]
[1:05:05] how do you live your life you know where
[1:05:08] the meeting place is going to be
[1:05:10] you see but if you have confidence in
[1:05:13] that individual
[1:05:15] uh
[1:05:15] you're going you know he's coming amen
[1:05:18] but you don't know when
[1:05:20] so you have to be around in such a way
[1:05:22] and just like the exodus
[1:05:25] huh just like the exodus remember the
[1:05:27] exodus how
[1:05:29] they uh moses told them to
[1:05:32] uh make sure
[1:05:34] that you are prepared to travel amen
[1:05:38] amen keep your sandals on
[1:05:40] keep your shoes on keep whatever is is
[1:05:43] on because we're going here we're
[1:05:45] leaving here very quickly
[1:05:47] amen so therefore
[1:05:49] we have to be ready
[1:05:51] when he comes and at the midnight there
[1:05:53] was a cry may behold the bridegroom
[1:05:56] cometh
[1:05:57] go ye out to meet him
[1:05:59] then all those versions arose and trim
[1:06:02] their lamps see all the versions trim
[1:06:05] their lamps and we'll we're going to
[1:06:06] speak on on on the wick uh also
[1:06:10] uh this morning because i'm sure that
[1:06:13] during a convention like this everybody
[1:06:15] will take a subject no doubt read the
[1:06:18] same scripture and probably will
[1:06:20] highlight one particular uh point and
[1:06:23] together it'll it'll make a wonderful
[1:06:26] wonderful time in the lord
[1:06:27] but uh something the lord spoke to me
[1:06:30] something there about the wick you see
[1:06:32] it's a very important part
[1:06:34] of the land because you can have oil in
[1:06:37] the lamp
[1:06:38] but you have to have uh the wick
[1:06:41] dipped in the oil
[1:06:44] and the wick is what draws the oil
[1:06:46] that's right
[1:06:47] amen and is
[1:06:49] it a fire has got to strike the tip of
[1:06:52] the wick
[1:06:53] and if it's not drawing the oil
[1:06:56] which is the holy spirit amen this is
[1:06:58] why we as christians today have got to
[1:07:02] be drawing
[1:07:03] the virtue and strength of the holy
[1:07:05] spirit
[1:07:06] amen to manifest on the outside that
[1:07:08] which is on the inside amen amen so you
[1:07:12] can preach a good message on a good wick
[1:07:14] or whatever it is but i want to know if
[1:07:16] is it lit that's right
[1:07:18] amen is it lit
[1:07:20] and that's a proof that there's real oil
[1:07:24] in the lamp but now all those virgins
[1:07:26] arose and trimmed their lamps and the
[1:07:29] foolish said the foolish said unto the
[1:07:32] wise give us
[1:07:33] of your oil for our lamps are gone out
[1:07:38] how could that be
[1:07:40] you know what they probably were not
[1:07:42] expecting cb because the bridegroom
[1:07:46] delayed
[1:07:48] they didn't plan for that scenario
[1:07:51] they
[1:07:53] did not plan for a midnight
[1:07:56] arrival
[1:07:58] and meanwhile if we're
[1:08:01] looking
[1:08:02] for the coming of the lord
[1:08:04] we have to live
[1:08:06] like today is the day that he's coming
[1:08:09] amen
[1:08:11] we cannot leave things to tomorrow
[1:08:14] we cannot put off things that we could
[1:08:16] do today
[1:08:18] we've got to live our lives in such a
[1:08:21] way
[1:08:22] that we are ready
[1:08:24] when he comes and especially when it
[1:08:26] comes the oil of the holy spirit in
[1:08:29] which we will speak on
[1:08:32] uh this morning but the wise answered
[1:08:35] saying
[1:08:36] not so
[1:08:38] lest there
[1:08:39] be
[1:08:40] not enough for us
[1:08:42] and you
[1:08:44] but go ye rather to them that sell
[1:08:48] and buy
[1:08:50] for yourselves
[1:08:52] now this here is where they missed
[1:08:54] [Music]
[1:08:56] the bridegroom
[1:08:59] they left their position
[1:09:03] of where they were to meet the
[1:09:05] bridegroom
[1:09:07] and they were not there when the
[1:09:09] bridegroom came where were they they
[1:09:10] were shopping for
[1:09:13] oil
[1:09:14] is that correct
[1:09:15] [Music]
[1:09:16] so that was a foolish thing to do
[1:09:19] because if you were prepared
[1:09:21] ah if you know he's coming this way no
[1:09:23] ain't no way you're going to go out and
[1:09:25] i i may miss him amen amen i may miss
[1:09:29] the lord i may miss his coming but no
[1:09:32] they figure well i'll i'll have some
[1:09:34] time
[1:09:34] and when i get back then you know he he
[1:09:37] probably would have not returned yet
[1:09:40] and i'll join the rest of them but to
[1:09:42] their shock
[1:09:43] and amazement wow
[1:09:45] they went to buy now i don't know what
[1:09:47] kind of
[1:09:48] place this was
[1:09:50] the bible says it's midnight or so
[1:09:53] and they're going out and buying oil
[1:09:55] it's kind of late
[1:09:56] they kind of they found it i don't
[1:09:58] know how much long how how much later
[1:10:02] they found it doesn't say
[1:10:03] but they found the oil
[1:10:05] and they come back with it
[1:10:09] but
[1:10:10] god has a an appointed time amen
[1:10:13] and his time does not adjust for you and
[1:10:15] i that's right
[1:10:17] when he said he's coming at a certain
[1:10:19] time
[1:10:20] at a certain place we better be there
[1:10:23] because the train waits for no one amen
[1:10:26] hallelujah you better have your ticket
[1:10:29] you better have your token amen and be
[1:10:31] ready to go when the train pulls into
[1:10:33] the station
[1:10:34] amen and after came also the other
[1:10:37] version saying
[1:10:39] uh all right let's let's go back to
[1:10:40] verse 10 and while they went to buy the
[1:10:44] bridegroom came and they
[1:10:46] uh
[1:10:47] that were ready went
[1:10:50] with him to the marriage
[1:10:53] and the door was shut
[1:10:55] with the five that went uh with him amen
[1:10:59] they met him
[1:11:02] they recognized who he was
[1:11:04] he was the bridegroom
[1:11:07] they had their lamps
[1:11:09] and it to show you that lamp will always
[1:11:12] talk about evening or night time that's
[1:11:15] right you don't need a lamp during the
[1:11:17] day
[1:11:18] so all of these things are taking place
[1:11:21] during
[1:11:22] a day that is
[1:11:24] dark
[1:11:26] so now
[1:11:28] they go out
[1:11:29] [Music]
[1:11:31] the five wise go into
[1:11:34] the marriage
[1:11:36] of the lamb
[1:11:40] the bridegroom
[1:11:42] and after came also the other version
[1:11:45] saying lord lord open to us
[1:11:48] but he answered and said
[1:11:51] verily i say unto you
[1:11:53] i
[1:11:54] know
[1:11:56] you
[1:11:57] not
[1:11:58] [Music]
[1:12:00] now verse 13 watch therefore
[1:12:04] for ye
[1:12:06] no neither the day
[1:12:08] nor the hour wherein the sun a man
[1:12:12] cometh amen
[1:12:14] so he's asking us finally to watch
[1:12:18] what does that mean
[1:12:19] watch in the morning
[1:12:21] watch in the noon time
[1:12:23] watch in the evening amen watch when the
[1:12:26] sun goes down we should always be
[1:12:28] watching amen for the coming of the lord
[1:12:31] amen uh let us turn to revelations 19
[1:12:36] and we will be reading from verse nine
[1:12:39] and rather verse seven through nine
[1:12:42] verse seven through nine
[1:12:46] and then you can have a seat
[1:12:51] and keeping my
[1:12:56] eyes on the clock
[1:13:00] let us be glad and rejoice and give
[1:13:02] honor to him
[1:13:04] for the marriage of the lamb has come
[1:13:07] and his wife hath made herself ready
[1:13:11] and to her was granted that she should
[1:13:14] be arrayed and find linen clean and
[1:13:16] white
[1:13:17] for the fine linen is the righteousness
[1:13:19] of
[1:13:20] saints
[1:13:26] and he saith unto me right blessed are
[1:13:28] they which are called to the marriage
[1:13:32] supper of the lamb
[1:13:34] and he saith unto me
[1:13:37] these
[1:13:38] are the true
[1:13:39] saiyans of god may the lord add a
[1:13:41] blessing to the reading of his word let
[1:13:44] us pray
[1:13:45] our heavenly father
[1:13:47] we have read your word lord and it's uh
[1:13:51] a blessing to us to be living in this
[1:13:54] time where i believe these scriptures
[1:13:58] these quotes
[1:13:59] are alive and more meaningful to us than
[1:14:02] ever before
[1:14:04] lord and we see the scene that we have
[1:14:07] just read
[1:14:09] how the bridegroom was predicted to come
[1:14:12] and yet he delayed the bible said he
[1:14:14] delayed
[1:14:15] and sometimes we
[1:14:17] sit around and talk about oh my parents
[1:14:22] they were waiting for the coming of the
[1:14:23] lord and now they're long gone is he
[1:14:26] actually coming it has the lord delayed
[1:14:28] his coming no
[1:14:29] he's always on time amen always on time
[1:14:33] long suffering waiting perhaps there's a
[1:14:36] lost soul somewhere that needs to be
[1:14:38] saved perhaps there's a mother of father
[1:14:40] or sister brother that yet has to come
[1:14:43] in so we have to wait until the last
[1:14:45] predestinated seed of god comes in to
[1:14:48] the ark then the rapture will go and we
[1:14:51] know that so therefore we ask for
[1:14:54] patience and your grace dear god that we
[1:14:56] may be able to endure lord the extra
[1:14:59] time that uh we would have to fight and
[1:15:03] dwell upon this evil earth dear god and
[1:15:06] we know that there is nothing no nothing
[1:15:08] that the devil can send our way that god
[1:15:11] will not help us overcome so father i
[1:15:14] pray that you would bless each and every
[1:15:16] one here under the sound of my voice and
[1:15:19] bless those on the internet lord bless
[1:15:21] those that would hear this tape lord and
[1:15:24] i pray that it would be a mighty
[1:15:26] blessing to the people because that's
[1:15:28] what we are here for to be a blessing
[1:15:30] and not only a blessing but to be
[1:15:33] truthful
[1:15:34] amen with your word because there are so
[1:15:37] many things that are spoken today in the
[1:15:40] name of christianity and in the name of
[1:15:43] this message that are absolutely false
[1:15:47] so father we
[1:15:49] take our stand today
[1:15:50] because when it comes to the holy ghost
[1:15:53] when it comes to the oil the true oil of
[1:15:55] the holy spirit dear god this is the
[1:15:58] theme of the omega church it was a theme
[1:16:02] of the apostles it has got to be the
[1:16:05] theme
[1:16:06] of the omega church so father we boldly
[1:16:09] preach it in the name of jesus lord i
[1:16:12] pray that if there's any sick here among
[1:16:14] us heal them lord and i pray if anyone
[1:16:16] is
[1:16:17] need of deliverance may you deliver each
[1:16:20] and every one
[1:16:21] father both on the internet and wherever
[1:16:24] this tape should go we ask it in the
[1:16:26] name of jesus christ amen and amen
[1:16:29] hallelujah you may be seated god bless
[1:16:32] you
[1:16:33] amen excuse me i just have a little cold
[1:16:38] this week just battling a little bit
[1:16:40] but i'm here for service
[1:16:42] amen hallelujah not gonna let a little
[1:16:44] cold
[1:16:45] uh keep me from my post of duty amen so
[1:16:49] i chose for
[1:16:50] a title go out and meet the bridegroom
[1:16:54] that's a wonderful wonderful
[1:16:57] uh statement there go out and meet the
[1:16:59] bridegroom
[1:17:00] and we can
[1:17:02] actually
[1:17:03] go back
[1:17:05] i didn't want to get too detailed in
[1:17:07] this message because my time is limited
[1:17:11] but if you take the old customs of the
[1:17:14] bible and the
[1:17:16] the
[1:17:17] wedding
[1:17:18] ceremonies of the old testament and and
[1:17:21] the actual
[1:17:22] weddings and jesus time and so forth it
[1:17:25] was very different than our weddings
[1:17:27] that we do have
[1:17:28] today amen so they had wedding uh
[1:17:32] uh well they had their wedding party
[1:17:34] they had the bridesmaids and they have
[1:17:37] the
[1:17:38] the friend of the bridegroom and so
[1:17:40] forth and we realized that a man
[1:17:44] a young man who proposed to a woman
[1:17:50] he
[1:17:51] had to be able to
[1:17:54] take care of her amen he had to provide
[1:17:57] for her
[1:17:58] he had to
[1:18:00] and i saw this when i went to israel
[1:18:03] that there were uh places under
[1:18:07] construction
[1:18:08] in various different parts of israel
[1:18:11] and i was asking uh because it was just
[1:18:14] a kind of a a thing that got my
[1:18:16] attention
[1:18:18] the construction of this particular
[1:18:20] place and i noticed the proximity of
[1:18:22] another house that probably was
[1:18:24] completely
[1:18:25] all
[1:18:26] fixed and completed
[1:18:28] and the tour guide said well
[1:18:31] that is the property of a
[1:18:34] bridegroom
[1:18:36] and he's preparing a place for his bride
[1:18:40] amen
[1:18:41] and he cannot
[1:18:43] you know him and his father
[1:18:46] meaning the the groom and the father of
[1:18:49] the groom
[1:18:50] they're planning
[1:18:52] amen a place for him to receive his wife
[1:18:56] his new wife to be and isn't that a
[1:18:59] beautiful type how jesus said i go to
[1:19:01] prepare a place
[1:19:03] for you amen that where i am you may be
[1:19:07] also amen amen this is why i have so uh
[1:19:11] nailed this down to here we have no
[1:19:13] continuing city but we seek one to come
[1:19:18] amen
[1:19:19] we see we're under debt here and you
[1:19:22] know the bill collectors come and knock
[1:19:24] on our door and trying to collect the
[1:19:26] rent and everything else and
[1:19:28] i know it's been tough here after i mean
[1:19:31] during a covet time and after covet time
[1:19:33] whatever it's been rough
[1:19:35] i mean bills are rolling in and so forth
[1:19:37] but god has a mansion already paid
[1:19:41] hallelujah i go to a prepare a place for
[1:19:44] you
[1:19:45] amen how did he buy it by the blood of
[1:19:47] jesus christ
[1:19:48] already paid for hallelujah glory be to
[1:19:52] god your salvation is paid for your
[1:19:54] healing is paid for your deliverance
[1:19:56] paid for even your children's
[1:19:58] deliverance are paid for hey amen all we
[1:20:01] have to do is to believe
[1:20:04] the word of god and god will absolutely
[1:20:06] manifest his word but now let me start
[1:20:08] this message here this morning with a
[1:20:12] quote uh from the rapture tape in 1965
[1:20:16] and that was a mind-blowing tape you
[1:20:18] know brother branham speaking on the
[1:20:20] rapture and yet the setting in which he
[1:20:22] had to preach it was quite uh remarkable
[1:20:25] in the cafeteria here the the plates
[1:20:29] you know and the forks and things are
[1:20:31] cleaning up the tables whatever it was
[1:20:33] but this was a
[1:20:35] a powerful tape
[1:20:37] because it sets in order the coming of
[1:20:40] the lord for the lord himself shall
[1:20:42] descend from heaven
[1:20:45] with a shout
[1:20:47] voice
[1:20:48] and trump amen
[1:20:50] and let us not forget
[1:20:52] that jesus does all three
[1:20:56] so we here in the original faith gospel
[1:20:58] tabernacle we tried to stay with what
[1:21:01] brother branham said and if we agree on
[1:21:05] certain things and we'll amen what
[1:21:06] you're saying
[1:21:08] amen we're around the world but it has
[1:21:10] to come to the word yes amen we can only
[1:21:14] have fellowship around the word of god
[1:21:17] amen but when we go off of these
[1:21:19] principles these basic principles then
[1:21:21] we're going to find ourselves in a mess
[1:21:23] but listen the first thing comes when he
[1:21:26] started when he starts uh descending
[1:21:28] from heaven
[1:21:30] there is a shout see what is it is a

[1:23:06] oil or some uh uh um oil that you made
[1:23:09] up amen brother branham talked about
[1:23:11] that you know when you have the
[1:23:13] mechanics and dynamics together amen you
[1:23:16] can have a car amen and you can have a
[1:23:19] gasoline
[1:23:20] jug
[1:23:21] gasoline jug that says gasoline on the
[1:23:24] outside and you pour it into your car
[1:23:27] and you can sit there day and night and
[1:23:29] try to start your car it's not going to
[1:23:32] start because it's not gasoline in the
[1:23:34] jug
[1:23:35] it looks like gasoline

[1:23:40] gasoline amen because there it when you
[1:23:43] turn amen that ignition
[1:23:46] amen and if there's real gasoline in the
[1:23:49] vehicle
[1:23:51] amen it puts that vehicle into action by
[1:23:54] creating a spark hallelujah
[1:23:57] amen and all of a sudden the engine
[1:23:59] parts begin to turn and
[1:24:04] amen hallelujah this is why i want to

[1:24:16] i want good old-fashioned oil in my lab
[1:24:19] amen
[1:24:20] something that will work something that
[1:24:22] will light the foot amen the bible says
[1:24:25] that your word lord is a lamp unto my
[1:24:28] feet
[1:24:30] amen praise be to god now let's continue
[1:24:34] now islam truman trying to uh time arise
[1:24:37] and trim your lamps
[1:24:39] what
[1:24:40] watch was that the seventh not the sixth
[1:24:42] the seventh watch behold the bridegroom
[1:24:44] cometh rise trim your lamps and they did
[1:24:47] some of them
[1:24:49] found that they didn't have
[1:24:51] any oil in their land
[1:24:54] see
[1:24:55] but it's lamp trimming time
[1:24:57] it's malachi 4
[1:24:59] time
[1:25:00] what he promised
[1:25:02] luke 17.
[1:25:04] amen uh and all of these other things
[1:25:06] look revelations 10
[1:25:08] 7.
[1:25:09] all of the other thing it's malachi 4
[1:25:12] time
[1:25:13] it's sea time
[1:25:15] bright time all of these prophecies that
[1:25:18] it can perfectly set it in order for
[1:25:20] this day so the message was to set in
[1:25:23] order the what coming of the lord amen
[1:25:28] that's what this message is all about
[1:25:31] and we don't stop there and say oh that
[1:25:33] was a good thing that brother brown uh
[1:25:35] set the message amen uh
[1:25:38] in order the order of the coming of the
[1:25:40] lord friends we're you know sure we're
[1:25:43] going up the road now
[1:25:45] but now we get into
[1:25:47] uh the deeper things and we find out we
[1:25:49] better have a lamp
[1:25:52] on our feet you're gonna find because
[1:25:56] there are so many
[1:25:58] out there
[1:26:00] that are preaching so many different
[1:26:01] things
[1:26:03] that you may miss it if you're not
[1:26:05] careful
[1:26:07] so malachi 4's message is to call out a
[1:26:10] bride
[1:26:12] for us
[1:26:14] to meet
[1:26:15] the bridegroom amen
[1:26:18] that was
[1:26:18] his only
[1:26:20] commission
[1:26:21] he didn't bind people to himself
[1:26:24] he was called to introduce the bride
[1:26:28] to the right room
[1:26:31] in fact he was called to espouse us to
[1:26:34] the word amen
[1:26:36] which is christ
[1:26:38] and now we are espoused to the word
[1:26:40] which means that we
[1:26:42] made a promise
[1:26:45] in sickness and in death
[1:26:54] we made a vow you know the wedding vows
[1:26:56] and so forth
[1:26:57] and he made a vow back to you
[1:27:01] yes i will take care of you
[1:27:05] in sickness and in death to death do us
[1:27:08] part and yet there is no death you know
[1:27:12] i will supply your needs
[1:27:14] when you're sick i'll make you well
[1:27:18] when you need a deliverer i'll be there
[1:27:21] hallelujah you are mine exclusively and
[1:27:24] even though the devil may try to flirt
[1:27:27] with you you can show them your ring of
[1:27:30] predestinated grace before the
[1:27:32] foundation of the world and you say
[1:27:34] devil i'm already spoken for
[1:27:37] hallelujah
[1:27:38] can a devil amen uh i mean that can
[1:27:41] flirt with you try to flirt with you
[1:27:43] but no no no this one's already taken
[1:27:46] brother branham told her to show the
[1:27:48] devil your ring of predestinated grace
[1:27:51] amen amen you've been spoken for
[1:27:54] but now when we see
[1:27:57] that the seventh watch the seventh
[1:27:59] church age
[1:28:01] what happens
[1:28:03] and is going to tie into what we're
[1:28:06] talking about now
[1:28:08] because in the laodicean church age what
[1:28:10] happens
[1:28:13] the lights
[1:28:17] goes out
[1:28:19] and by faith
[1:28:22] when brother branham was showing
[1:28:24] the light of the church
[1:28:26] ages and you read the church age book
[1:28:31] brother branham says that that light
[1:28:33] throughout the church ages
[1:28:35] struggling to stay on
[1:28:39] and when it came to lay out a seer there
[1:28:41] was almost
[1:28:42] complete darkness
[1:28:46] and laodicea
[1:28:48] and so much as we spoke here just a week
[1:28:51] ago or so that god was he would he
[1:28:54] spewed uh leaders here out of his mouth
[1:28:58] they were not hot and they were not cold
[1:29:01] they were just lukewarm
[1:29:03] and there is a situation in this message
[1:29:06] today with a lot of lukewarm people
[1:29:09] they've lost their fire for god
[1:29:13] that is the truth that's gospel
[1:29:16] you think it's all right to stay home
[1:29:18] and say okay i don't need any pastor i
[1:29:21] don't need anyone to to to to preach to
[1:29:24] me what i should do should not do amen
[1:29:27] you are backslidden that's right amen
[1:29:31] let me tell you the truth
[1:29:34] amen well bless god now i can hear this
[1:29:37] also from a distance and i can hear a
[1:29:39] song so i follow soul soul and yet you
[1:29:42] don't pay your tithe that's right to
[1:29:43] that person you don't pay anything
[1:29:46] that's a layout of seeing spirit amen
[1:29:49] that's right
[1:29:50] go out to meet the bridegroom amen
[1:29:54] are you going to meet him out meet him
[1:29:55] like that in that condition
[1:29:57] no
[1:29:58] all right i'm i'm getting into something
[1:30:00] and i don't i'm just i'm going to be
[1:30:02] good i'm going to be good amen but
[1:30:05] people kind of get nervous but you know
[1:30:07] the truth has got to be spoken
[1:30:09] it's got to be spoken you have to speak
[1:30:11] it
[1:30:12] because then you will never say that oh
[1:30:15] i have never heard it before
[1:30:19] there is a falsehood that is
[1:30:22] spreading through
[1:30:24] the message like covet
[1:30:27] it's killing people
[1:30:30] spiritually speaking is killing people
[1:30:33] cannot breathe anymore meanwhile the
[1:30:35] breath of life is is is is there to
[1:30:38] receive and they
[1:30:40] are in
[1:30:42] you know
[1:30:43] critical condition as it were
[1:30:46] lukewarm
[1:30:47] but i'm going to tell you something you
[1:30:49] know what they have provided today
[1:30:52] oh are you vaccinated
[1:30:55] are you vaccinated are you vaccinated
[1:30:57] and thank god they have provided many
[1:31:00] vaccinations today in our country and i
[1:31:03] trust and pray i mean it's all up to you
[1:31:06] some say that the vaccination is the
[1:31:08] mark of the beast and everything else
[1:31:10] but it's how it has helped our group let
[1:31:12] me just say that
[1:31:13] amen uh it's helped our group and we by
[1:31:16] the grace of god when since we have
[1:31:19] opened again there hasn't been one case
[1:31:21] here amen by the grace of almighty god
[1:31:23] we thank god for it
[1:31:25] and it's uh we thank god for his mercy
[1:31:29] but if you ever take the vaccination of
[1:31:31] the holy ghost
[1:31:33] let me tell you something that will work
[1:31:35] on your dna rna any kind of a amen that
[1:31:39] is wrong
[1:31:40] over any disease
[1:31:43] hallelujah that's what the church needs
[1:31:44] today is a good old-fashioned
[1:31:46] inoculation
[1:31:47] of the baptism of the holy ghost amen so
[1:31:50] therefore
[1:31:52] when we see
[1:31:54] this day approaching when we are in this
[1:31:56] day i only have about half hour or so
[1:31:59] but now
[1:32:00] let's
[1:32:01] see what the difference is
[1:32:04] okay
[1:32:05] let's see what the difference is between
[1:32:07] the wise and the foolish versions
[1:32:11] brother branham says in the 10 and
[1:32:14] 10 versions and 144 000 message he says
[1:32:18] now watch these two
[1:32:20] churches
[1:32:21] he calls them churches oh
[1:32:24] if there
[1:32:25] was some way i could just make the
[1:32:28] people see it
[1:32:30] just burns in my soul these churches are
[1:32:34] just as clean
[1:32:36] and holy
[1:32:38] as this one
[1:32:40] if they're all virgins see they're all
[1:32:43] version just as clean
[1:32:45] the only
[1:32:46] difference
[1:32:48] was the oil
[1:32:51] in
[1:32:52] the lamb
[1:32:54] the
[1:32:56] holy ghost
[1:33:00] the only difference
[1:33:04] they look alike
[1:33:06] they dress alike
[1:33:09] they have the same lamp
[1:33:13] they probably wore the same clothes
[1:33:16] the difference was
[1:33:19] the oil
[1:33:20] or the lack thereof
[1:33:25] and it was an attitude most of all
[1:33:29] because you had
[1:33:31] five wise versions that made preparation
[1:33:35] amen just in case
[1:33:38] he should come in an hour that i don't
[1:33:40] even think
[1:33:42] that he may come
[1:33:44] while the foolish versions then they
[1:33:46] were not even thinking about the
[1:33:48] possibility
[1:33:51] of him coming in the hour that they did
[1:33:53] not expect amen
[1:33:56] this is why
[1:33:57] the bible says let us be ready
[1:34:00] if you knew that a burglar was going to
[1:34:03] come into your house
[1:34:05] at a certain time
[1:34:06] i guarantee you you will not suffer that
[1:34:09] burglar to come into your house you'll
[1:34:12] be right there
[1:34:13] waiting for them and when you try to
[1:34:15] come into your house you tell them devil
[1:34:16] get out of here in the name of jesus
[1:34:19] christ you take the shotgun of faith and
[1:34:21] boom out he goes
[1:34:23] because you were ready
[1:34:25] you were prepared
[1:34:27] hallelujah
[1:34:29] amen it's those that don't be prepared
[1:34:32] oh i'm so surprised i i was vandalized
[1:34:35] and everything they took everything
[1:34:37] and meanwhile you have heard reports all
[1:34:39] over the neighborhood that there's
[1:34:41] vandal vandalism going on
[1:34:44] but she didn't think it's to happen to
[1:34:45] you
[1:34:47] you see the thing is we've got to pinch
[1:34:50] yourselves and make sure
[1:34:52] but
[1:34:53] this is what makes the predestinated
[1:34:56] different
[1:34:58] than
[1:34:59] any other person
[1:35:01] because in their hearts
[1:35:03] the holy ghost will always
[1:35:06] speak to your heart amen i'm going to
[1:35:08] tell you something
[1:35:11] without that voice
[1:35:13] that speaks to you no you shouldn't do
[1:35:15] this go over there
[1:35:16] do this
[1:35:17] no stay away from there
[1:35:19] that little something that's still a
[1:35:21] small voice
[1:35:23] leading you to all truth
[1:35:24] [Music]
[1:35:26] but they didn't have that little small
[1:35:27] little voice ah he's
[1:35:30] he said he's coming
[1:35:32] yesterday he didn't come yeah
[1:35:34] i waited all day today he didn't come
[1:35:38] so
[1:35:40] i'm not saying that they did not have
[1:35:42] oil
[1:35:45] at one time
[1:35:46] but the bible said it ran out amen and
[1:35:49] they refused to
[1:35:52] refill amen and this is what i want to
[1:35:56] make sure that you understand
[1:35:58] amen some people just oh yes i got
[1:36:00] filled with the holy ghost years ago and
[1:36:02] bless god you know brother abraham said
[1:36:05] one baptism many fillings
[1:36:08] amen every hour lord god give me a
[1:36:12] refilling
[1:36:13] hallelujah sometimes our experiences get
[1:36:16] a little old and they get all
[1:36:20] formal and
[1:36:21] hallelujah where we need the holy ghost
[1:36:24] every day in our lives
[1:36:26] don't tell me that was good for years
[1:36:28] ago is good for now as well it set you
[1:36:32] on fire years ago it'll set you on fire
[1:36:34] today
[1:36:36] hasn't changed praise god
[1:36:39] amen is the same holy ghost
[1:36:41] glory be to god the same oil
[1:36:44] the only difference was the oil in the
[1:36:47] lamp the holy ghost and the holy ghost
[1:36:49] if it's in there see it produces a very
[1:36:53] same kind of fire
[1:36:57] listen
[1:36:58] that it did on the on the day of
[1:37:00] pentecost but
[1:37:02] they don't have no fire
[1:37:05] no oil in their lambs
[1:37:08] they have church rituals
[1:37:13] church rituals see it can be fine
[1:37:16] ceremonies nothing against that crete
[1:37:19] uh would shake your conscious and songs
[1:37:22] that angels sing like angels and you
[1:37:25] couldn't put your finger on their lives
[1:37:28] see
[1:37:29] you couldn't do it but still
[1:37:32] that throne
[1:37:34] it's just part of it
[1:37:37] you can sing
[1:37:38] you can sing like an angel
[1:37:41] you can give
[1:37:42] your
[1:37:43] body
[1:37:44] amen to be burned and
[1:37:46] give to the poor
[1:37:49] and that's all nice
[1:37:52] but it's not all of it
[1:37:54] it says
[1:37:56] that's
[1:37:57] the kind
[1:38:00] that misses
[1:38:02] the rapture amen
[1:38:05] did you hear what i just said amen
[1:38:09] amen good people
[1:38:13] bless
[1:38:14] god can you point anything in my life
[1:38:19] no
[1:38:22] can you say that i am i'm an adulterer
[1:38:24] or whatever can you say that i'm this or
[1:38:26] that
[1:38:27] did i am i a liar or cheater that's not
[1:38:30] what we're saying amen
[1:38:32] in fact that's not even what the parable
[1:38:34] of the uh five
[1:38:36] uh virgins foolish and wise is all about
[1:38:40] right because they were all
[1:38:42] versions the difference was
[1:38:46] the oil
[1:38:48] that was the difference
[1:38:51] the sole difference
[1:38:53] so if that was the difference then it
[1:38:55] must be very important
[1:38:59] [Music]
[1:39:01] it is the deciding factor of whether we
[1:39:04] walk in or cast out
[1:39:13] now when i read this i guarantee you and
[1:39:15] i hope it has the same impact it had
[1:39:18] on me
[1:39:20] it's just a part of it
[1:39:22] so it's not just going through rituals
[1:39:25] of the message
[1:39:26] do you realize we had five retreats last
[1:39:29] year
[1:39:30] you know and
[1:39:32] so many people were baptized and so
[1:39:34] forth and that's all good
[1:39:36] then it's hard to keep those people who
[1:39:38] were baptized unless you bring them to
[1:39:40] the holy ghost
[1:39:42] is that correct
[1:39:44] the holy ghost is what grounds the
[1:39:46] person amen
[1:39:48] the holy ghost is what changes
[1:39:51] a heart
[1:39:52] amen the old nature of the heart the
[1:39:55] human heart it changes you from a wolf
[1:39:58] to a lamb amen
[1:40:01] hallelujah you don't have to walk out
[1:40:04] of the church and hope
[1:40:07] that you don't act the old way that you
[1:40:09] used to
[1:40:11] amen if the real true holy ghost came
[1:40:13] into your heart that devil is burnt out
[1:40:17] oh let me tell you something hallelujah
[1:40:20] hallelujah god is sealed in and the
[1:40:23] devil is sealed out
[1:40:26] that's what the true holy ghost is
[1:40:28] amen and if you're still struggling amen
[1:40:31] with your personal life if you're still
[1:40:32] struggling trying to overcome and you're
[1:40:35] still tr struggling amen you and you
[1:40:37] wearing worldly things and you doing the
[1:40:41] things of the world and you still
[1:40:42] holding on to your holy ghost experience
[1:40:45] let me tell you something very clearly
[1:40:47] let that go
[1:40:51] let that go
[1:40:53] you know why because that doesn't work
[1:40:55] for you
[1:40:57] amen let that go
[1:40:59] because my bible says that when the holy
[1:41:02] ghost comes in hallelujah listen
[1:41:07] when a demon comes out of a person
[1:41:10] huh
[1:41:11] one strong demon and is cast out
[1:41:14] see then there is a vacancy in that
[1:41:17] heart
[1:41:19] is a vacancy amen and that basic vacancy
[1:41:22] belongs to the holy spirit
[1:41:25] god himself
[1:41:27] predestinated to be there
[1:41:30] but after a while when it's cast out
[1:41:32] amen you feel good while it's cast out
[1:41:34] but yet you feel an emptiness
[1:41:36] ah
[1:41:38] and then you get closer and just get
[1:41:40] drawn closer to the world and the next
[1:41:42] thing you know
[1:41:44] a demon will look inside that heart and
[1:41:46] find it empty
[1:41:48] cleaned out
[1:41:49] oh that's not
[1:41:52] that flat has not been occupied yet
[1:41:55] that apartment has not been occupied yet
[1:41:58] oh my
[1:42:01] i'll bring seven more of my friends
[1:42:04] amen and i'll come back in
[1:42:07] why because there's nobody in there to
[1:42:09] keep them out
[1:42:11] but when the holy spirit is in there it
[1:42:13] seals that holy spirit in to the day of
[1:42:17] your redemption
[1:42:19] it's no more fighting about the
[1:42:22] the the things of the world
[1:42:24] hallelujah this is old-fashioned
[1:42:26] preaching i'm sure to some people amen
[1:42:28] think although that's that's just the
[1:42:30] way it was preached years ago well thank
[1:42:31] god i'm not changing the way i preach it
[1:42:35] amen it's the same way hey hallelujah
[1:42:39] the same holy ghost
[1:42:42] see just part of it but not all of it
[1:42:44] see is that is
[1:42:46] that's the kind that misses the rapture
[1:42:50] see the psalmist david speaks unto us in
[1:42:52] psalms 119
[1:42:55] and
[1:42:56] verse 105
[1:42:58] thy
[1:42:59] word is a lamp
[1:43:02] unto my feet
[1:43:05] so what is the lamp the lamp is a word
[1:43:10] and a light unto my path
[1:43:13] the word is a lamp unto my feet
[1:43:17] to light up my path
[1:43:19] and without light you know in darkness
[1:43:22] it is very difficult to
[1:43:24] find and navigate
[1:43:27] around
[1:43:31] so it's very important
[1:43:33] what i'm about to say here because in
[1:43:35] bible times
[1:43:37] listen
[1:43:38] you didn't have the streets of jerusalem
[1:43:41] lit the way there it is today
[1:43:44] you don't have these electricity
[1:43:46] electrical lights and things in a major
[1:43:48] city
[1:43:49] no
[1:43:50] they were uh with little lamps
[1:43:54] at night
[1:43:55] and it was very difficult to
[1:43:59] travel through
[1:44:01] the nighttime
[1:44:02] you don't know also who was hiding in
[1:44:06] any kind of uh
[1:44:07] thief or
[1:44:09] you know
[1:44:10] people that were
[1:44:11] to do you wrong
[1:44:14] so you needed light
[1:44:15] [Music]
[1:44:16] to see
[1:44:17] a little further off amen
[1:44:21] so therefore there was no street lights
[1:44:24] as it were electric street lights in the
[1:44:26] bible times
[1:44:28] lamps were used
[1:44:30] a source of illumination
[1:44:32] to direct the path of people
[1:44:35] who needed
[1:44:37] a sense of direction
[1:44:40] brother branham also
[1:44:42] he said it speaks of a dispensation of a
[1:44:45] nighttime or darkness
[1:44:50] now let us
[1:44:51] get back to
[1:44:53] this laodicean church age
[1:44:55] amen
[1:44:57] somebody asked brother brandon i believe
[1:45:00] brother branham you talk about that the
[1:45:02] laodicean
[1:45:04] last went into complete darkness
[1:45:08] and
[1:45:10] i'll share this with you
[1:45:12] and i trust that because i heard it
[1:45:15] from somebody of a reliable source
[1:45:19] and i think it's
[1:45:20] worth
[1:45:22] repeating
[1:45:26] when he said
[1:45:29] about 1977.
[1:45:33] where did he get that from
[1:45:36] and somebody
[1:45:38] was sharing with me
[1:45:41] some kind of vision that brother branham
[1:45:44] had
[1:45:45] or supposed to have had
[1:45:47] there was a calendar pages
[1:45:50] [Music]
[1:45:52] you know and every every page was
[1:45:54] something and then
[1:45:56] 77 it was just nothing but
[1:45:59] darkness
[1:46:01] nothing goes beyond 77
[1:46:04] complete darkness
[1:46:07] after
[1:46:08] 1977.
[1:46:10] so in brother branham he perceives that
[1:46:13] there is no way that anything can live
[1:46:17] and survive
[1:46:20] in that darkness
[1:46:26] how can we survive in darkness
[1:46:29] how can we just survive in this uh
[1:46:32] when you when i talk about darkness you
[1:46:35] see what is darkness
[1:46:37] darkness is error darkness is sin
[1:46:42] darkness is all that is not god
[1:46:46] that's what guard and darkness is
[1:46:49] so it goes into a complete
[1:46:52] total
[1:46:53] darkness
[1:46:54] but when brother branham by faith
[1:46:57] was drawing out the church ages
[1:47:01] there was a little sliver of light in
[1:47:03] which he
[1:47:04] drew out
[1:47:06] in the seventh church age
[1:47:08] a little sliver of light
[1:47:13] and that light was
[1:47:16] put there by faith
[1:47:19] knowing
[1:47:22] that there shall be light
[1:47:25] in the evening time
[1:47:28] the path to glory you will surely find
[1:47:34] so therefore the only light where do you
[1:47:36] find the light
[1:47:41] the only light that would be left on
[1:47:44] this earth is the light in you and i
[1:47:47] am amen can you say amen to that amen
[1:47:53] is that the truth
[1:47:55] look around and you see
[1:47:57] darkness and gross darkness all over
[1:48:00] but yet
[1:48:02] there's a light amen in you
[1:48:06] oh hallelujah
[1:48:08] the devil didn't start it and he can't
[1:48:11] blow it out
[1:48:12] hallelujah there's a lighter
[1:48:14] predestination
[1:48:16] hey amen before the foundation the world
[1:48:19] god knows is his own
[1:48:21] there was a light of predestination
[1:48:24] amen so
[1:48:27] john 12 and 35 then jesus said unto them
[1:48:30] ye
[1:48:32] a little yet a little wilder and this
[1:48:35] light is with you walk while you have
[1:48:38] the light
[1:48:39] lest darkness come upon you
[1:48:42] for he that walketh in darkness
[1:48:44] knoweth not whether he goeth amen
[1:48:49] that's the word
[1:48:51] matthew 25 and 13 we read it
[1:48:54] watch therefore for you know
[1:48:57] neither the day nor the hour wherein the
[1:48:59] son
[1:49:00] of man coming
[1:49:03] now let me go back to what i have been
[1:49:06] speaking on i'm
[1:49:08] almost done
[1:49:12] i have stressed this
[1:49:15] and i have brought this out
[1:49:20] because
[1:49:23] during the seven church ages
[1:49:28] if you read your book
[1:49:30] and you study
[1:49:32] the seven church ages
[1:49:35] there was one like unto the son of man
[1:49:38] who walked among
[1:49:41] seven
[1:49:42] golden
[1:49:44] candlesticks
[1:49:47] and they were lit
[1:49:49] first age was lit
[1:49:52] everyone
[1:49:53] was lit
[1:49:55] he was walking but
[1:49:57] among
[1:50:00] in every age
[1:50:04] but when you come to the laodicean
[1:50:07] church age
[1:50:10] you find the same
[1:50:13] christ
[1:50:14] who was walking among
[1:50:17] the seven church ages
[1:50:21] this time he's outside amen
[1:50:24] this time he's outside
[1:50:28] on the outside looking in
[1:50:32] outside of his church
[1:50:36] what up
[1:50:37] how can there be light in that place
[1:50:40] if jesus the light of the world is
[1:50:42] outside knocking trying to get back into
[1:50:44] his church
[1:50:45] [Music]
[1:50:48] and that church in their layout is in
[1:50:50] church they are worshiping
[1:50:52] making a lot of noise
[1:50:55] oh yes they're moving and dancing and
[1:50:57] carrying on
[1:51:00] know jesus
[1:51:02] jesus is not in the house
[1:51:08] spirit is not in the house
[1:51:12] he said i stand at the door knock
[1:51:18] so this is what i want to tell you
[1:51:22] and i know that i have been going on
[1:51:24] week after week after week
[1:51:27] i have 14 minutes to tell you
[1:51:28] [Music]
[1:51:30] and i will tell you
[1:51:34] what a shame
[1:51:36] to reach delay us in church age
[1:51:39] and find
[1:51:42] that the very god
[1:51:45] the very messiah that we seek is not
[1:51:48] even in
[1:51:50] the church
[1:51:55] let me give you a type
[1:51:58] remember when the three wise men
[1:52:01] they come
[1:52:03] a long distance
[1:52:05] because they have seen
[1:52:07] the star
[1:52:08] in the east
[1:52:10] and they had come all that way to
[1:52:12] worship him
[1:52:15] the newborn messiah
[1:52:18] they traveled through treacherous times
[1:52:20] and conditions and things
[1:52:24] and it led them to a place
[1:52:28] that seemed to be over jerusalem
[1:52:34] and in their mind they thought for sure
[1:52:37] if any
[1:52:39] people would know
[1:52:41] it would be these people amen
[1:52:44] this is where all the churches were at
[1:52:47] all the priests were at
[1:52:50] all the
[1:52:52] ministers association was that
[1:52:54] that the bishop of
[1:52:56] whatever was there
[1:52:59] so they walked into jerusalem
[1:53:03] inquiring where is
[1:53:07] he that is born king of the
[1:53:10] jews for we have seen his star
[1:53:14] and i've come to worship him amen
[1:53:17] you know what they ask
[1:53:21] where is who
[1:53:23] we've never heard of such a person
[1:53:29] not only that but when they went into
[1:53:31] religious
[1:53:32] denominational
[1:53:34] within the denominational city
[1:53:38] they looked up and they couldn't see the
[1:53:41] star
[1:53:43] the star was not in the city
[1:53:46] don't expect the star
[1:53:49] the light
[1:53:51] the messiah amen to be in the biggest
[1:53:54] churches
[1:53:56] the biggest cities
[1:53:59] because what happened is
[1:54:02] when they got into that religious realm
[1:54:06] know it all priests
[1:54:09] they didn't even know that messiah was
[1:54:11] on the earth now
[1:54:14] and they
[1:54:16] said okay you don't know let me walk out
[1:54:18] of here i just but when they walked out
[1:54:21] of the city
[1:54:23] they looked up and they saw the star
[1:54:26] oh and when they saw the star they
[1:54:29] rejoice with great joy
[1:54:32] glory be to god
[1:54:34] listen you have to seek and find and
[1:54:36] look until you find the star
[1:54:42] in your church
[1:54:44] you don't want to start outside your
[1:54:46] church you don't want jesus outside the
[1:54:48] church you want the good old-fashioned
[1:54:50] holy ghost moving in your church you
[1:54:53] want signs wonders and miracles moving
[1:54:56] in your church amen without the holy
[1:54:58] ghost the church dies
[1:55:00] hallelujah and i'm talking about not
[1:55:03] some mental conception i'm talking about
[1:55:05] the old-fashioned experience
[1:55:08] the way it was preached from the
[1:55:10] beginning
[1:55:12] it doesn't change
[1:55:14] for anyone
[1:55:16] nobody no intellectual giant can change
[1:55:19] the experience of the holy ghost
[1:55:24] paul said
[1:55:26] boldly if any man come preaching any
[1:55:29] other thing
[1:55:30] let him be a curse
[1:55:32] why should i feel bad about
[1:55:35] calling things a curse
[1:55:38] when paul tells me to do it
[1:55:45] not beating you up
[1:55:47] preaching the gospel
[1:55:51] time has come to come back to the world
[1:55:56] one final
[1:55:57] thing we are more divided today than we
[1:56:00] ever was
[1:56:02] [Music]
[1:56:04] i have never seen so many fights in my
[1:56:06] life
[1:56:09] i have never seen so much hatred in my
[1:56:11] life
[1:56:16] that's why i stay around i stay away
[1:56:17] from negative people amen
[1:56:23] watch your friends
[1:56:25] stay away from negative people because
[1:56:27] they want to drag you into their
[1:56:29] negativity
[1:56:30] [Applause]
[1:56:32] they have a whole list of people that
[1:56:35] they have ought against
[1:56:38] and they want to be your friend
[1:56:40] all right the next thing you know you
[1:56:42] are their friend and then they talk
[1:56:43] about
[1:56:44] the other ones that they don't quite
[1:56:46] approve and the next thing they want
[1:56:48] their enemies to be your enemies as well
[1:56:53] but a holy ghost person don't get
[1:56:54] involved with that kind of stuff
[1:56:56] [Music]
[1:56:58] oh no no no no no no no
[1:57:01] listen there's too much love in the holy
[1:57:03] ghost person
[1:57:04] oh it doesn't stick
[1:57:06] the hatred doesn't stick into the heart
[1:57:08] amen hallelujah
[1:57:10] it's in your heart
[1:57:14] that's the difference with the holy
[1:57:16] ghost
[1:57:17] you're not busy trying to make somebody
[1:57:19] or de-christianize somebody you just
[1:57:22] simply are trying to preach the truth to
[1:57:24] get people back to the word back to the
[1:57:26] center of the
[1:57:28] listen of the gospel is that too hard to
[1:57:30] ask amen can we go back to the quotes
[1:57:33] that that we used to read years
[1:57:36] ago
[1:57:38] or have we put some of these quotes
[1:57:40] aside because they don't quite fit with
[1:57:43] our teaching today
[1:57:48] that's how you can see how far they have
[1:57:51] strayed
[1:57:52] and then they say oh
[1:57:54] we
[1:57:55] must think outside the box
[1:58:00] well that's the problem
[1:58:03] you're outside yeah you're outside the
[1:58:06] box i can't go out with you outside the
[1:58:08] box and try to
[1:58:10] look at what you're looking at i can't
[1:58:14] this is why i say how can we walk
[1:58:16] together lest we be agreed amen we have
[1:58:20] to agree in principle in doctrine and
[1:58:24] somewhere some common ground
[1:58:26] if not let's keep our conversations
[1:58:28] general
[1:58:31] because as a christian we cannot
[1:58:33] communicate and we cannot fellowship
[1:58:36] because we have no common ground
[1:58:38] one wants to hate and the other one
[1:58:41] praise god wants to love
[1:58:43] and forgive and i want to remind you
[1:58:46] over on the other side
[1:58:48] hallelujah
[1:58:50] brother braham said nothing but perfect
[1:58:51] love will make it there
[1:58:54] nothing but perfect love will make it
[1:58:55] there so i don't care how intellectually
[1:58:59] right your doctrine sounds
[1:59:02] there's a way that seemeth right to a
[1:59:04] man
[1:59:06] but that's the way that leadeth to
[1:59:07] destruction
[1:59:10] god is not impressed with your
[1:59:12] intellectual uh
[1:59:13] a
[1:59:14] understanding of scripture he is the one
[1:59:17] who is the author and the finisher of
[1:59:18] the scripture
[1:59:20] he is not impressed how you can
[1:59:22] twist it in such a way to make it sound
[1:59:24] in a way that is presentable to people
[1:59:27] you think christ is the seed he's not
[1:59:29] deceived he is the word
[1:59:33] hallelujah
[1:59:34] amen
[1:59:35] adam
[1:59:37] was not deceived
[1:59:39] he was the word
[1:59:41] now if you have people looking for and
[1:59:43] hearing seeking for knowledge new
[1:59:45] knowledge and new life
[1:59:48] people got tired of the message
[1:59:51] that's the problem they get tired of the
[1:59:52] message oh they're they're actually
[1:59:54] going after new things
[1:59:57] new age thing
[1:59:59] new age
[2:00:02] i don't have a new age the only new age
[2:00:04] i have is that eternal turk change at
[2:00:06] the end of the seals and that's where it
[2:00:08] ends
[2:00:10] [Music]
[2:00:12] inventing new uh other ages
[2:00:15] i'm gonna close with this
[2:00:17] brother at least you can come because
[2:00:18] this is this is what i want to nail down
[2:00:24] questions and answers
[2:00:27] because this has been
[2:00:30] something
[2:00:31] that i have preached for years
[2:00:35] and this is something
[2:00:38] that brother branham
[2:00:41] preached all of his ministry amen
[2:00:44] and this is something
[2:00:47] that brother coleman
[2:00:49] preached all of his ministry amen
[2:00:52] and this is something by the grace of
[2:00:54] god let me
[2:00:57] so help me god amen

[2:03:54] desire to come upon anything there's
[2:03:56] nothing to come on

[2:04:16] the word is laying in there waiting for
[2:04:20] the holy spirit to put it to work but
[2:04:24] listen
[2:04:25] but it takes the lighting
[2:04:28] of the candle hallelujah
[2:04:31] you see what i'm saying that even if you
[2:04:35] you need fire
[2:04:37] to light a candle
[2:04:41] if you had oil
[2:04:43] if you had the wick that is dipped
[2:04:46] properly
[2:04:47] you still need
[2:04:49] fire
[2:04:55] [Applause]
[2:04:57] still need that experience
[2:04:59] [Music]
[2:05:00] to light that wick
[2:05:02] and let me tell you something when you
[2:05:04] are set on fire this is the kind of uh
[2:05:07] candle that never goes out
[2:05:09] oh no no no no won't go out praise god
[2:05:12] the devil will try to put carbon on it
[2:05:14] from time to time but by the grace of
[2:05:16] god there's lamp trimming time amen and
[2:05:18] here comes the fire just as bright as
[2:05:20] ever
[2:05:22] see here's a candle with the wick uh in
[2:05:24] it and with all of the uh tallows and
[2:05:27] everything it has to have in that candle
[2:05:31] but until the fire comes on it it will
[2:05:34] never shine any light see no matter how
[2:05:38] perfect the candle is or how perfect it
[2:05:40] will burn
[2:05:41] or anything it's got to be lit
[2:05:45] [Music]
[2:05:46] that's why this is what we're trying to
[2:05:48] do get that fire lit
[2:05:50] oh brighten up the corner where you are
[2:05:54] brighten up the corner where you are
[2:05:58] shine your life for jesus
[2:06:00] shine it from
[2:06:05] okay we'll sing that after okay
[2:06:08] no matter how perfect the candle is or
[2:06:10] how perfect it will burn
[2:06:11] and
[2:06:12] everything has got to be lit and then it
[2:06:16] burns
[2:06:17] listen and when you believe
[2:06:19] and are made up
[2:06:21] of the instructions of what the holy
[2:06:24] spirit is love joy peace long suffering
[2:06:27] goodness fruits that it bears out until
[2:06:31] the holy spirit with a fiery experience
[2:06:35] comes down and lights that candle
[2:06:39] see
[2:06:40] you haven't received the holy ghost see
[2:06:44] you've got to have the experience to
[2:06:48] have
[2:06:49] the holy ghost
[2:06:52] i rest my case right here
[2:06:55] [Music]
[2:06:58] [Applause]
[2:07:04] not many people can take that word now
[2:07:08] they're trying to bypass experience
[2:07:11] why it's easier
[2:07:13] oh it's easier you just come in and
[2:07:16] you know
[2:07:17] you just come into a church you join and
[2:07:20] you know and actually another thing that
[2:07:22] is
[2:07:23] they don't want that
[2:07:25] see when people get more sophisticated
[2:07:29] brother brown told you this
[2:07:31] before
[2:07:32] more sophisticated people don't want
[2:07:34] that old-fashioned
[2:07:36] experience they don't want it
[2:07:39] why because they're natural
[2:07:42] they have never received that amen
[2:07:45] although they have claimed that they
[2:07:46] have years ago
[2:07:48] because if you claim you receive
[2:07:50] something you will never decide you will
[2:07:52] never
[2:07:55] disagree
[2:07:57] with the good old-fashioned experience
[2:08:00] you have to stay the same
[2:08:03] how on earth can you say i got some
[2:08:04] revelation that we no longer need
[2:08:06] this it's not a revelation i want
[2:08:09] [Music]
[2:08:10] that's not a revelation that will light
[2:08:12] my candle
[2:08:15] and you young people let me speak to you
[2:08:17] if you're listening amen
[2:08:19] in
[2:08:20] churches tell you you have the holy oath
[2:08:24] and you go out
[2:08:26] and you're defeated every day of your
[2:08:27] life
[2:08:31] you you're depressed
[2:08:34] because you can't even overcome
[2:08:38] a shadow of a trial
[2:08:43] the bible says
[2:08:46] we need power
[2:08:47] to become sons of god
[2:08:51] so i'm here to tell you
[2:08:53] my dear friend
[2:08:55] there's a real holy ghost experience to
[2:08:58] be had
[2:09:00] it'll change the way you walk
[2:09:02] it'll change the way you talk
[2:09:05] it'll change the way you live
[2:09:07] amen it's no longer will be an
[2:09:10] intellectual thing and where you have to
[2:09:12] come to church and and
[2:09:13] memorize charts and everything else and
[2:09:16] tickle your intellect
[2:09:19] you can have all the charts in the world
[2:09:20] and still not have it
[2:09:24] peter on the day of pentecost didn't
[2:09:26] pull out a chart
[2:09:27] he said this is that
[2:09:30] what was that god come down to manifest
[2:09:34] what it was
[2:09:35] and they saw it
[2:09:37] and they were pricked in their hearts
[2:09:39] amen nothing against charts as i said
[2:09:42] but you know
[2:09:43] but now
[2:09:45] we're closing
[2:09:47] patmet's vision
[2:09:48] talking about the uh oh this is
[2:09:50] beautiful but i have to miss i have to
[2:09:52] uh
[2:09:53] bypass it because my time is up
[2:09:57] he was talking about the seven golden
[2:09:58] candlesticks and each lamp
[2:10:02] brother branham explained it so
[2:10:04] beautifully
[2:10:06] that
[2:10:07] the first
[2:10:08] lamp
[2:10:11] had to be
[2:10:12] lit
[2:10:14] by a certain fire
[2:10:20] and then
[2:10:22] they could not take
[2:10:24] that first
[2:10:26] starter
[2:10:27] fire
[2:10:29] and light the rest of them
[2:10:33] it
[2:10:34] this
[2:10:35] this was a special fire
[2:10:37] that started that fire
[2:10:40] then they had to be
[2:10:42] put out
[2:10:44] put aside
[2:10:46] then they took the fire
[2:10:48] that started on the day of pentecost
[2:10:52] took this fire
[2:10:54] and lit this next age
[2:10:58] then they put this one back
[2:11:00] put it there
[2:11:02] now two are lit amen
[2:11:04] then they took this one
[2:11:06] you see because
[2:11:07] the type here
[2:11:09] is that the fire
[2:11:11] that reaches the last age
[2:11:14] will be the same fire
[2:11:16] that started the first stage
[2:11:20] [Laughter]
[2:11:23] amen so how on earth are you going to
[2:11:25] change the fire that's right amen amen
[2:11:28] when the holy ghost had moved from age
[2:11:30] to age and age and age and almost it
[2:11:33] went out but by the grace of god it
[2:11:35] would it started to fire the next age
[2:11:38] and here come malachi for when it almost
[2:11:40] was out completely amen the holy spirit
[2:11:42] was bound by the river euphrates for
[2:11:45] over 2 000 years but he had a ministry
[2:11:48] to release the holy ghost
[2:11:50] amen back to this dark age amen
[2:11:53] hallelujah and we are feasting on that
[2:11:55] fire today
[2:11:57] god still fills with the holy ghost god
[2:12:00] still delivers god still heals god still
[2:12:03] oh our god is an awesome god
[2:12:06] hallelujah to the lamb he's an awesome
[2:12:09] god
[2:12:10] hey amen i'm bragging about jesus that's
[2:12:13] what i'm bragging about amen i don't
[2:12:15] brag about any man i brag about the man
[2:12:17] christ jesus amen hallelujah and i will
[2:12:20] amen anybody that will preach the word
[2:12:22] of god amen like it was on the day of
[2:12:25] pentecost and why do i preach in this
[2:12:28] fashion
[2:12:29] because this is what paul preached
[2:12:32] do you know that brother brown said well
[2:12:34] thank god i'm glad that i preached what
[2:12:37] paul preached
[2:12:38] so if he preached with paul preaching
[2:12:40] thank god i'm preaching what paul
[2:12:42] preached
[2:12:44] amen hallelujah so i thank god for the
[2:12:47] light
[2:12:48] that has been set amen
[2:12:51] go out to meet my groom
[2:12:54] amen don't worry there's a holy spirit
[2:12:56] the holy ghost seed in your heart you're
[2:12:58] believing you're believing and you're
[2:13:00] believing and god knows he sees that
[2:13:03] but he's waiting amen waiting for that
[2:13:06] seat to come to full maturity
[2:13:08] then
[2:13:09] he's going to anoint it
[2:13:11] with dynamics and put it to work
[2:13:14] hallelujah all things are ready
[2:13:18] let the fire fall
[2:13:21] oh
[2:13:22] hallelujah
[2:13:24] amen the patmos vision and i'm gonna
[2:13:27] close
[2:13:28] amen and we'll sing that song uh becky
[2:13:30] maybe you can help me i just uh
[2:13:32] sometimes forget the words but i know to
[2:13:34] brighten up the corner where you are
[2:13:36] hey man i'm gonna brighten up the corner
[2:13:38] where i'm where i'm at but listen just
[2:13:40] in case you're just like what are you
[2:13:41] talking about is that now these lamp
[2:13:43] stands the fire that was on these lamp
[2:13:47] stands in the old testament when
[2:13:49] they
[2:13:50] lit one lamp they could not
[2:13:54] light the next lamp
[2:13:56] with the same fire
[2:13:58] see that's what i was just talking about
[2:14:01] and they had uh
[2:14:03] the fire see that they had in the hand
[2:14:05] uh
[2:14:06] they lit one lamp
[2:14:09] then picked it up
[2:14:10] and lit the other lamp
[2:14:13] and then set it uh set it down and lit
[2:14:18] the next lamp
[2:14:19] and then took it and lit this lamp
[2:14:23] to show see the lamp was the same fire
[2:14:28] that they started at the beginning
[2:14:33] same fire
[2:14:35] so i have to say please don't change the
[2:14:37] fire
[2:14:40] please don't change the fire
[2:14:42] there's no need to change the fire
[2:14:44] see the lamp with the same fire that
[2:14:46] they started at the beginning
[2:14:49] you mean the same holy ghost
[2:14:52] that's really something for a person
[2:14:54] who's like
[2:14:58] who
[2:14:58] can't understand the supernatural the
[2:15:01] same holy ghost that fell
[2:15:04] on the day of pentecost
[2:15:06] in his power and his authority in its
[2:15:11] you know because they had the holy
[2:15:13] spirit in a very special measure amen
[2:15:16] remember
[2:15:17] amen they had the holy ghost
[2:15:19] also that not only sealed them into
[2:15:24] the body
[2:15:26] but they were positionally placed at the
[2:15:28] same time
[2:15:29] so they come out
[2:15:31] of the upper room
[2:15:33] apostles teachers evangelists so forth
[2:15:36] but in this age of course we are sealed
[2:15:38] first and we grow into our positions
[2:15:42] amen but now
[2:15:44] think of what is fixing to pour out now
[2:15:48] charity to seal you in
[2:15:52] and put you into the position that god
[2:15:56] ordained you to be in before the
[2:15:57] foundation of the world
[2:15:59] oh i hope you don't it doesn't go over
[2:16:02] your head jesus christ the same
[2:16:04] yesterday today and forever
[2:16:06] the same fire
[2:16:07] the same holy ghost lit every one of
[2:16:11] these churches
[2:16:12] right down through the ages
[2:16:16] same fire
[2:16:17] not a different one
[2:16:19] never change anywhere
[2:16:21] same fire
[2:16:22] same
[2:16:23] so if it's the same fire then uh
[2:16:27] paul preach
[2:16:29] the holy ghost
[2:16:30] irenaeus preach
[2:16:32] the holy ghost
[2:16:33] martin colombian all over the they all
[2:16:36] had brother branstad their mechanics and
[2:16:38] dynamics together it wasn't in the same
[2:16:40] measure that we have it today neither
[2:16:42] was it in the same measure that they had
[2:16:44] it on
[2:16:44] in the beginning but god said i will
[2:16:47] restore saith the lord amen
[2:16:49] but it is promised that at the end
[2:16:52] amen the fullness of the holy spirit
[2:16:54] would be
[2:16:55] restored
[2:16:57] just like it was on the day of
[2:16:59] pentecost
[2:17:00] hallelujah will have the same sign same
[2:17:03] one the same miracles amen happening
[2:17:05] right here amen because the fullness of
[2:17:07] the holy ghost had been released
[2:17:10] amen and now
[2:17:12] what people don't understand
[2:17:14] is that the revelation of jesus christ
[2:17:17] reveals not only the holy ghost
[2:17:19] as a spirit to seal you but it reveals a
[2:17:22] very person
[2:17:24] the very person of jesus
[2:17:26] christ oh
[2:17:28] and the person has a personality
[2:17:32] a person
[2:17:33] with his personality he behaves a
[2:17:35] certain way
[2:17:37] he acts a certain way
[2:17:39] he moves a certain way
[2:17:41] oh let me get a god bless you

[2:17:48] god bless those that are online
