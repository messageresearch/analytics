sister donna k for friend janella peters who is having an acute asthma attack at this moment so can we just bow our heads for word of prayer our gracious heavenly father we thank you tonight lord that we could come together lord by your blood under your shed blood lord come together in fellowship divine fellowship divine communion lord in the cool of the evening as it were lord after the hustle and bustle of life and lord trying to navigate this new normal and all that is going on father we come to you tonight as a people and needy people needing more from you lord to have a fire sight chat as it were to have a conversation tonight around your holy scriptures lord that you could speak to us and we could see lord perhaps something that we have never seen before in quite this way and lord we come tonight lord lord with different needs different situations different conditions different challenges different struggles different obstacles lord things that we understand things that we're trying to figure out but well we are present we are reporting for duty tonight we we have shown up we are in attendance we are at the post of duty lord coming to report in as it were to get uh a push a shot an encouragement father lord that we could continue to fight the battle lord and father we want to pray for every brother every sister that's here tonight lord you know every need every situation lord we pray special blessing upon them we want to pray for janella peter's lord right now with this asthma attack we come against it in the name of jesus christ lord and we pronounce healing lord upon lord sister donors friend lord and lord by this prayer this request that would become a note of praise though that he would come to know you by revelation and by experience father and if there's anyone here tonight lord who needs a touch lord that the enemy has attacked in some way or the other lord we pray tonight you will touch your people lord may you lift your people up lord may you give clarity of mind clarity of purpose clarity of focus may the dark clouds move back there are dark clouds in the atmosphere right now there are warnings of the the weather and the weather patterns but lord they are also spiritual clouds law that affect people in different ways but lord you looked at the darkness in genesis and said let there be light and the light pushed back the darkness may you push back the darkness tonight by the light of your word the light of your written word lord and that became so illuminated to us by the revealing of the word through your prophet messenger malachi 4 lord may you speak to us tonight may you bless those that are here those that would join us those that may hear the tape and may you speak to us tonight in a special way we thank you lord for this opportunity we don't take it for granted lord we have seen how the way we would lord i want to use the word traditionally worship has been interrupted lord and father this is this is what we are doing now and we don't know how long this will last because lord there's coming a time when we would not even be able to do this so we don't take it for granted at all father we we we take this opportunity to be grateful to be thankful lord for how you have made a way for us lord when father lord so much is going on and and to know that one day your prophet said the last song will be sung the last sermon would be preached lord and the door would be shot and lord those that are inner in those that are out lord bible speaks of a time when he who is filthy is filthy still he who is righteous is righteous still and we see the clock ticking down to zero hour to midnight hour lord when there is no time left so as we approach your word tonight may you speak to us lord in the simple way that you would do father lord and lord to see how the great mystery of god could be veiled in the simplicity of the lord jesus christ when he walked the earth all that was complex was made simple lord so simple that the pharisees mister it's so simple the sad you see is misted so simple the theological aristocracy of the day fear to recognize that deity messiah was in their midst law let us not lord fall victim to that but maybe we realize that you are still the same yesterday today and forever may you speak to young and old may you speak to those that are lord working those that are looking for jobs those that are tired those that are strong whatever the need is the situation is may you walk out the pages of the bible lord may you reveal yourself to those who know very little may you reveal yourself to those who may know a lot lord because there's so much more to learn and in our own way may you give us a personal experience with you tonight as we walk along the way in the precious name of jesus christ and the church says amen amen and amen well certainly a great privilege and an honor to be with you tonight and uh to be in fellowship around the word of god and uh to thank him for his mercy his love his grace to us certainly appreciate uh the service last sunday and uh the water was a tremendous blessing and uh brother anthony uh last wednesday night as well uh to see how god is dealing with his children his people in different ways to keep us encouraged to keep us motivated to keep us focused it's so easy to lose focus you know there's so much that's that's going on and it's so easy to lose focus in in in the time that we live in and uh it's important that we we find ways to to stay on point to stay you know you know on the wood and to not fall victim to distractions and everything else the cares of life you know the bible says all that is in the world loss of the eyes the lust of the flesh the pride of life you know and um it's either that or it's it's the influence of god you know and and as we we look to god to speak to us in simple ways it's for us to to to prove that there's something in us uh that is a seed germ that we didn't put there but god pleased there so i i thank you tonight for your presence i thank you tonight for the the the acceptance challenge as it were to report for duty as true soldiers in the army of the lord tonight so i have a little study uh and um i always say one of uh the reason i enjoy bible studies is that it's not preaching um it allows us to sit a while and and kind of have a conversation as if we we in the same house i know we can't physically all be in in one house right now but um this technology allows us to do just that so kind of relax you know and kind of have a conversation uh looking at what we may have seen before but just taking some time to kind of chat about it discuss it kind of slow down a little bit and kind of look at it again and look at ourselves and and even get a deeper level of understanding of how the dots are connected in scripture you know and i realize that uh as believers our fortification is the word we know this our strength is in the word our confidence is in the word our assurance is in the word so the more you get clarity and understanding of the scripture which is the written word and clarity and understanding of the revealed word which shines light on the written word it puts you in a position that it becomes very difficult to move you if not impossible to move you because the word is your protection and the word is your defense but the branham said if eve had stayed behind the word the devil could have never gotten to her so if her defense was not in her knowledge her defense was not in her ability her defense was in one simple principle staying behind the word because the word is powerful enough to defend the world is powerful enough to attack the world is powerful enough to keep you when you cannot keep yourself that is what the word is for tonight so i want to take a little thought tonight and i kind of want to start um our substantive text will be in the book of saint matthew and i'm going to kind of fast forward the book and then kind of rewind the book and then pull a few things um i don't intend to be too long with you tonight um but by grace you want to take a look at this tonight so i actually want to start with just reading uh what should be a very very very very familiar scripture um to kind of put some context and kind of uh i guess i i draw my title from there and it's somewhat of a foundation for me tonight and it is taken from the lord's prayer which is matthew 6 and i'm reading from matthew deliberately uh after this manner this is matthew 6 and verse 9 after this manner therefore pray ye our father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name and i'm not really trying to teach on the lord's prayer tonight but just to draw reference that the approach to prayer starts uh with worship and um as a as a principle god structures things a certain way many of us when we approach prayer we approach prayer from a petition and ask in position and we see that in jesus teaching about prayer he references god his power his majesty his dominion his authority before he reaches the point to ask for anything he starts off with establishing and acknowledging uh the position that god has his his placement his authority his majesty our father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name and before he meets a request he further goes on thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth or in earth as it is in heaven so now he he still hasn't asked for anything yet he is firmly now giving honor giving praise understanding what god is what he represents what the kingdom is what it represents the authority that god has and that he is now subject to that authority so that will be done in earth as it is and then he comes down to the petition give us is the our daily bread and he goes on and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen now there's one line in there that i want to kind of touch on tonight and it's that and lead us not into temptation and if well it's going to take a little thought around that it will be and lead us not into temptation and i was having a sort of fellowship around this topic of temptation and i was having a conversation with brother ovid about it and i was saying that you know when jesus was teaching this prayer and he was speaking about leaders not into temptation it was not simply a prayer or statement to him because jesus understood what temptation was so there's a gravity to his statement of and lead us not into temptation it's one thing if you say i don't want to have to go through something and you never went through it so you have you know you might have an experience that somebody else went through and it's and by their own testimony you don't want to experience it so somebody say well you know if you if you have to go on and and and and do some type of surgery or something or do some kind of thing you know a rough experience so you know you don't want to go but it's still here see it's still somebody's experience and they tell you well when you go by the dentist and if you have to to pull that that tooting back real hood and then you're right in your mind your your your you're living in that so you say well i ain't going by no dentist because my uncle tell me when he went in a real hood and and your testimony or your decision is based on hearing what somebody else went through or somewhat somebody else endured and based on their negative experience so to speak you know you are taking a position based on their negative experience but this is not that because jesus is saying and lead us not into temptation and this is matthew 6 and that's why i say no when you rewind two chapters earlier you reach to matthew 4 where jesus goes through his own temptation so when when people speak and they they they they say things a certain way and they went through certain experiences so don't wait to it all right so now i want to get down to somewhat of our our substantive teaching which is with his matthew 4 is where we will spend our time in tonight's study and we will touch a few scriptures and we'll touch a few things that the prophet spoke about and and speaks about and we'll see to what extent we can get to it tonight again i'm not trying to be too long with you this is just a little bible study to encourage us a little bit through this word all right now matthew 4 comes uh you know just when uh jesus was was was just after jesus was baptized and we would have said before that out of the four gospels matthew mark luke and john which are all written from somewhat different perspectives of the very same situation matthew is particularly unique and we saw it how god used paul when he wanted to get an academic he went against saul who became paul because he was an academic he was a writer he was he was a learned man he couldn't use peter to do what paul did because peter wasn't really the kind of the kind of scribe as it were that paul was and when it comes to reading matthew mark luke and john matthew was the tax man he was the man of details he was a man of making sure that the books were balanced and the audits were done so his approach to detail is very very unique you know he what he captures we would have talked about how he captured the genealogy in matthew 1 uh very unique in how he presents you know the view of jesus's life on the earth and the reason i like this particular study tonight it's because ultimately many people have missed this focus of jesus all right people fight for doctrine they fight for church they fight for belief and somehow they miss the jesus in the entire story they miss the fact that we are all trying to be like jesus that he is our example you know and i was sharing with yesterday that when you look and there's so many things moving around and it has to be something in the world that really anchors you you know um there is no substitute for jesus you can go around looking at the life of jesus for the entire of the old testament spoke about jesus the entire of the new testament spoke about jesus the ministry of that elijah that great prophet was speaking about jesus so we should take particular attention to study everything around jesus and not miss anything at all because that's who we want to be like so i want to start before we really hit four uh i want to start from the end of three so we understand the context into four so matthew 3 and verse 16 and jesus when he was baptized went up straightway out of the water and lo the heavens were opened unto him and he saw the spirit of god descending like a dove and lighting upon him and law a voice from heaven saying this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased and just after that we now meet matthew 4 verse 1 then so this is a continuation so then the word then means we are continuing then was jesus led up of the spirit this is matthew 4 verse 1 into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil now this one verse here is like three services in one because this is a this is a lot this is a lot and i want to kind of tarry here a little bit now life is about testing you don't get a driver's license unless you do a driver's test you cannot get certain jobs unless you do certain tests even if you have no o levels a levels b levels no levels even to take a job interview is a test nobody just hires you unless you will enter some kind of a test even if the test is pick up that here move it there okay you can do that come on work there has to be some way for anybody to assess if you could do what you say you could do so go into the bank and try to make a withdrawal there's a test show me id card somehow or the other there's something that has to be proven there's always about proving in life so at this point in jesus's ministry it is as if he comes to a test the issue is not if he is son because when you read in verse 3 we know who he is beloved inside an imam well please but now jesus is being led by the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil a few things in there i want to draw our attention to jesus led of the spirit into the wilderness so this wilderness or the concept of wilderness and i'm just going to take some liberty here wilderness represents dryness it represents barrenness it represents emptiness it represents a lack of something whenever you hear wilderness you don't think of harvest you don't think of fruit you don't think of everything is is great and a wilderness everybody goes through some kind of a wilderness wilderness is part of life so wilderness is not just a physical so i don't want you to see it as jesus in this a desert and it's just that type of wilderness everyone in this room has their own wilderness they go through your wilderness could be in your finances your willingness could be in relationship you could be going through a wilderness on your job you could be going to a wilderness in your health you're going through some place in your life that when you look at it you recognize listen boy this is the wilderness and that's seeing fruit when the disciples went and fished and caught nothing that was like a wilderness so i want you to see the wilderness in the in the context of what it also represents because whenever you type wilderness in scripture it is about this place of hardship there's a tough spot to be in and i want you to see it that and i want you to see it from a deeper perspective as well because we slowing down here that as much as god was pleased with jesus as much as he loved jesus as much as he was identified with jesus it did not stop god from sending him into our wilderness so so i want us to appreciate the fact because many times people talk about are going through a dry spell the only time people tell me that i'm going through a dry spell so you know what they're going through our wilderness the joy i used to have in your spirit i don't have it no more are going through they're not they may not use the word you know but they're describing the attributes of the thing are going through our wilderness i go into a rough time i used to be on fire i used to be shouting i used to be but i find myself in a wilderness and i want you to see it from different contexts no now that we have described and put a tag or a description on this state of being when things are not ideal when things are not what you would like it to be or this is not what you hoped it would be this pandemic that we are in right now is a wilderness i know a lot of people who thought that they were diversified that they were protected that things were going to be all right that they they planned for 2020 they started january 1st for 2020 talking about how good this year was going to be and we had another detail and they have everything and then all of a sudden they find themselves in a wilderness who lost their job who business have to close what have to happen who end up in a sick bed who healthy people end up in a wilderness of being sick wilderness now i want to make a distinction now because i rewind it back in the same verse and jesus was led up of the spirit into the wilderness so matthew is making a very clear statement that it was not that jesus by accident end up in the wilderness it was not jesus make a bad decision and end up in the wilderness this was god designing it or to use the word here leading him into the wilderness now before we go any further it means now we have to make this distinction this is very simple and i hope it encourages you in some way we have to make a distinction between you planning deliberately strategizing by making bad decisions to end up in your wilderness that is not what i'm talking about so there are people who through bad decisions bad choices end up in their wilderness and you have your spirit leading into the wilderness so you'll hear about over preaching many times you have yet to be led by the spirit into your place of trying you are yet to be led by the spirit into your proving ground because jesus couldn't get to the next step of his ministry without passing through this place of testing this place of trial these this particular situation anybody with me tonight so i want to kind of dig a little deeper in there so there is a difference friends between god leading you into a situation and you finding yourself in a situation most of us are in trouble because we made decisions that put us in a situation and it's not god letters there and when you connect this one verse to the lord's prayer with jesus being led here to be tempted of the devil and now in matthew's secrecy and lead us not into temptation because temptation is not a nice place to be in i want to stick to together but i want to make the distinction again that god is suffering you could pray but god is sovereign enough to know what's best for you what's best for me and he has to decide what he has to take us through so as much as jesus would pray lead us not into temptation god could decide what journey you have to take and it needs to be made clear god is never the one to tempt and there are many scriptures on that so it's not god ever tempting but god could put you in a situation to be tested he could place you in a position to be tried why would he do it because sorry he has to be sure that you can handle whatever has to come your way so it is not for us to be afraid of the test it is for us to understand that the test is coming and many of us we are in a test we are in a trial and i'm trusting and praying to god that you are looking at this from spiritual eyes to see what god wants you to see tonight so we still in matthew 4 verse 1 then was jesus led above the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil so it's not again i want to make the point and the bible says that we will get it i believe in james we say let no man see is god tempting me so if you go into some type of temptation don't blame god he is not the one tempting all right so let's go now we in canada wrapping up one we might touch it again verse two and when he had fasted 40 days and 40 nights he was afterward and hungry so i was having a conversation about this and i was saying you know temptation is part of life there will always be some temptation but temptation is always amplified when you're in a wilderness and when you're hungry i'm not talking about hungry as in food hungry i just talking about jesus was so hungry after 40 days and 40 nights that it's different if somebody comes with food on day one and somebody have a food on day 40 after you go to a period of this level of not having and in this case jesus was fasting how more attractive the temptation would come and i took this whole thought tonight friends because in looking at this whole pandemic in looking at what is happening in the spiritual realm in the governmental realm and these and all these things that are taking place in this time that we're living in now people are forced to be more real than they've ever been before you have a real choice because we have lost the privilege to see you on a sunday so you are who you are when you're by yourself you have a choice how you live how you speak how you dress how you act if you pray if you don't pray what life you live many people the contact on a sunday as it were is a real encouragement to push you to make it through when you see somebody else and you shake a hand and you say god bless you and you feel charged but but that level of interaction is no longer there so when you're by yourself because jesus was there by himself and there was he was indeed another a club around him a support system around him he is there and it's him and his thoughts and a situation and many times in periods of what maybe deem some level of isolation when temptation comes you have nobody to say you shouldn't do that you know you know you shouldn't do that but then again i was looking at it from and and and from from the time we're living in to see how different situations creep up on people when they're in their wilderness and you're hungry things are happening as you would and i was sharing with somebody recently that uh the central bank of trinidad and tobago the fiu the sec the the the the banks the credit unions put out some disclosure recently about some so that they say that they're real susu and they say the problem is and the reason these things proliferate is they thrive in periods of crisis they say under normal circumstances if people have normal jobs and they don't these things don't creep up but in a period of hunger in a period of desperation in a period of where jobs are lost and and people trying to make ends meet then opportunities that people would not ever look at before suddenly become more attractive it's a temptation now the thing of it is when people hear about temptation they default to thinking sexual temptation alcohol temptation they default to thinking only certain categories of temptation but temptation is anything that's taken away away from god you know so a temptation is in you could be tempted to waste your time you could be tempted to not read your bible and consume other material other content that is breaking you down slowly and you're reckoning and and if you don't see it for what it is then you will realize you're being tempted and being drawn away from what your purpose is in life there are some people tonight not in this room and they have no real excuse for not being here and unless it's a real strong excuse the question is what is the temptation oh boy oh boy oh boy so because at the end of the day our decisions are driven and we'll read it it's in scripture it's it's our own desires it's what end up manifesting you know when somebody backslide and say well well it was it was a person or it was a disorder what they really manifested is what's on the inside so your life you live because it's not god tempting but god looking understand his friends he's looking to give power he's looking to give anointing and presence understand these gifts and callings that without repentance so we're not just talking about gifts and calling it's not people with gifts we're not dealing with gifts we're dealing with a time of power and god looking to pour power on sons and daughters who have overcome overcome what the lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh and the pride of life these three wild attacks that all forms of temptation fall into one of these three buckets so i could speak tonight that's something you say but no woman don't tempt me i i i attempted by this that but but then there's a there's a prior life issue that you have dealing with there that don't manifest itself in running on a woman or going and drinking the bar or going on and and and you feeling holier than though and you're wholly an adult turned into into into good self bad self some other kind of self but at the end of the day you can't approach god with that because it's pride of life of pride of life is one of the powerful ones that manifest itself with car repenting car say i'm sorry you reach so high and status and station that nobody can talk to you and you don't realize that that itself is deception or the spirit of popularity there's so many things in there that are temptation that drive people away from the truth because understand this temptation is to draw away from it's to pull you away from so we talk about there'll be a famine not for books and tapes but fairly true word of god so people end up in a wilderness of not hear any word and then the itching ears go after false doctrine and fourth doctrine is attractive it is tempting it sounds interesting it's curious it's it is worthy of debate but we are fighting now to resist the devil resist temptation because it's never god tempted god not trying to god don't need to attract your attention by by suiting you oh boy the method for god to attract your attention is not this deceitful and deceptive i don't know come come come come come that is not god i have a quote to give you no don't that's not god he don't need to resort to the tactics to to attract your attention in that way that is not he's not a he's not a god who's trying to deceive us into something he's a god of truth he's a god of principle he's a god of clarity he's the god of light anybody with me tonight all right so i hope this is helping you somehow tonight because temptations will increase there will be people through this pandemic who god open up the door for church in a few months or whatever you may not see them again because they succumb to temptation during this period that's the reality of it can the church say amen you have young people who go to jobs and we think about it in in youth services the lord bless them with an earth job the gather two pieces of paper to certificate the yellow working thing and and and and they grew up in a nice home behaving their self hunting and and the first day they woke and think they did a tingling thing and after a while slowly slowly slowly they get time let me stay back i have to work online now let me let me you know and and i've seen so many people break down because they couldn't take a stand on something and in order to fit in fitting in is that temptation you know i don't want to look like i i am not a struck up i i s tush so i will i will i will i will lime i'm not gonna drink it i just and whatever it is so i don't know who this is helping tonight but i don't want anybody to to pretend to be holier than thou because jesus for it to be a temptation it meant and by the branham said it jesus was tempted in every way the bible says it and he didn't sin temptation when you are tempted it means that you thought may have run through your mind so mr branham said he said the temptation is not he said is he giving in to it is what his sin is because the temptation is designed to come at you so we talk about the prophet but ibrahim said he hung across in his car and we just laugh about this as as brothers okay say if that was in the 50s and his 60s and were but abram said he hung across in his car so when he see the woman walk the street he would look at the cross how many brothers were most only hiding behind any cameras but only high-end across any car so when that happens and i told you and people yeah so if you have to do it no you need to put across your whole car you block your whole window the back screw in the windscreen because what we have now is not what you have to do with them but i asked myself the question if he as the prophet vindicated prophet proven prophet put something in place i want you to catch enough he put something in place to protect himself who who is you who am i if the prophet in other words he buy an insurance policy here take it for granted yes sir i am the prophet blessed god these hidden filthy women on the street look one there look one there look one there demon demon jezebel jezebel that's not what he did he put a cross in his car so that he don't even look to see who is jezebel and who is not jezebel anybody with me tonight so it means that the prophet he understood his vulnerability i want you to catch that because there would be no need for him to do it if he did not understand his vulnerability and if as believers we don't understand now the bible say that this we are not ignorant of satan's devices we are not ignorant of the the past that satan have to bring thoughts to our minds so you can't move around stupid you can't move around ignorant we know better we understand the attack we understand we're in a war we understand that temptation is real and the devil if it is we are placed into temptation it didn't happen by accident god allowed it to happen so something could be proven and you have to have your systems in place just like the prophet did just like what jesus did that's like all those who stood the test of time did have to have something in place through the word that you can overcome but robert said it like this he said close the doors close the windows don't give room to the enemy close all the spaces that the enemy could try to come into your life anybody with me tonight we still in matthew you see others i tell myself i'm not going too long tonight and the time already moving right so verse 3 and when the tempter came to him he said if thou be the son of god command that these stones he made bread now this verse here somebody is sitting on you we read this or no we this is not new to us we we all know these scriptures so i want us to understand that this here is not a demon it's not a devil it is the devil all right so there's somebody saying recently the devil not coming to it's not the devil himself coming to people you know he's little let me say that again i think someone look at that it's not the devil himself some of us a little situation listen the devil have really no time for most people it's a big operation he's running he is not the devil leaving hell to come to your pool it's not a house the devil have imps and little demons and he will talk about when you cast one out you want to bring seven more that's not the devil involved in that yet the devil is running on administration so i want you to understand that that's not a little devil a little demon this is this is this is the chanter himself came to him and he said if thou be the son of god command that these stones he made bread now there are many issues here one issue is the fact that the tempter is not actually trying to get jesus to do something that is sinful enough i want you to catch that from all appearances this request could even pass as a legitimate request because if you're hungry and you are who i think you are then just command it to be read and so it's not as if and this is what i remember brother i think years ago preach it he said the devil is the devil know that cocaine is something you would never take he wouldn't come until they take cooking you know better than that but the psychologists talk about what they call a gateway drug so they talk about things that open up into other things so they say when you're a smoke cigarette you might go onto marijuana you might go onto something else you might do taking anything and then you might end up so it might you're taking a long road to get there something open up until you reach there so here we have the first temptation is not even to go and drink go and smoke go and meet a girl go and do just go and do that the first issue is one of trying to understand if this vulnerability if this weakness can be exploited i know you're hungry if you are who you are just speak and command these stones be bred and but i brown i would go through this and talk about this was actually dealing with the same three while attacks lost in the eye must be first prior to life and he goes back into genesis and if you recall that first great test in genesis where let's see we finally very quickly is this helping anybody tonight lust of the eyelash to the flesh pride of life genesis 3 and verse 6 and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food nice lots of the flesh and that it was pleasant to the eyes the rest of the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise pride of life she took up the fruit thereof and did it and by the branham type out that these three wild attacks these three things that all as in the world has fallen under one of these three buckets here it was the devil coming and trying to get jesus to bend his will when it comes for this element of his lust of the flesh but jesus but he answered and said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeded out of the mouth of god first stress then the devil taking them up into the holy city so i want you to watch your progression now it went from flesh it went from something that didn't even seem to be sinful not to ignore the fact that jesus made it very clearly that he word is his defense but the devil take him up into the holy city here take him into the demo prostitutes here take him into where the people linemen are having a party he takes him up into the holy city and setted him on the pinnacle of the temple so i want you to understand here that temptation is not presented in a way at times that is just debauchery and filth that temptation could come to you along the line of something you're interested in that don't even have to look too bad i want you to catch it now the devil knows some people he can't even carry a nearby but here it is the devil take him up into the holy city and set it up on the pinnacle of the temple so not just so i want you to understand the typing you know the holy city on top of the temple that's his spiritual height you're talking about like in front of spiritual people religious people and saying unto him if thou be the son of god cast thyself down no to see how the devil is so subtle and so dangerous and i want you to appreciate the devil keeps saying if thou be the son of god it's it's it's the second time he says it and it is very clear friends that the devil is conscious of who he delivered it is not that he is ignorant of it because his next verse says for it is written he shall give his angels charged concerning thee so the devil is quoting scripture pertaining to this role that he believes he's speaking to and i want us to understand that if the devil not even afraid of going tooth and nail against jesus what puts you in a position of immunity and what would make you be so reckless to not finish life with your word as your protection then you will realize that you cannot approach life without the word and said unto him if thou be the son of god cast thyself down for it is written he shall give his angels charged concerned in thee and in their hands they shall bear thee up lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone and jesus said unto him it is written again thou shalt not tempt the lord like god again for the battle but bring her the type it's you would he's defending by the word all right so again with it the devil will take him up into an exceeding high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them and he said unto him all these things will i give thee if thou will fall down and worship me and it's really really something when you look at this it is not as if jesus said but you can't do this sinner so jesus himself understood the power that adam had forfeited that allowed satan to end up in this position and here it was satan is appealing so he's appealing to everything that could possibly attract jesus's attention so i want us to be watchful i want us to be vigilant i want us to be sharp to understand that you each of us let me nail his own have to deal with our own version of this let me say that one more time each of us have to deal with our own personal individual version of this if jesus himself had to go through this on his journey as it were to adoption don't you understand that you have to also go through this don't you understand that this is given to us so that we can take encouragement from this to learn from this and realize that in our own moment when nobody else is around we have to be able to stand and it reinforces because jesus used the word and we're going to read the quote but the bible says it he had to use the word to defend it was not spirit he was using the word because the word is powerful enough so we cannot take chances with this word we can't play games with this word we can't take what we want and what we don't want because we don't know how the act how the attack will come we don't know what we will need what resource what tool what weapon we have to pull from our toolkit to deal with whatever challenge comes our way candidates amen then say jesus unto him get thee and satan for it is written thou shalt worship the lord thy god and him only shalt thou serve then the devil leave with him and behold angels came and ministered unto him the lord had a blessing to the reading of his word and just to kind of share a few more points before we wrap up tonight this thing about temptation is all throughout scripture it's all throughout life as we read in genesis 3 6 eve had to deal with temptation and she was unable to resist temptation we read of the struggles of king david and dealing with temptation the temptation of bathsheba and in an attempt to cover his sin he planned to have bathsheba's husband killed we see true scripture samson falling to the temptation of delilah this these things are no surprises to us we are fully conscious of them and yet still centuries after this we still have individuals falling to the temptation what separates them from those who did not or who will not or who protect themselves we have the temptation of wealth or the attraction of goods with acon who after the instruction was given to do not mess with the stuff in jericho would hide the babylonian garment and hide the wedge of gold among his stuff which led to defeat to the churn of israel when god promised them that there would be no defeat that they would lose no men they would lose no soldiers but what is it that push aircon to make a decision to do that he actually yielded to temptation but not only do we have situations of individuals who yielded to temptation but you remember when we studied uh neyman and having to go and dip and we talked about um when when when uh when uh uh elisha was done with him and um he he neymar offered him some money and yeah just say i don't want it that was a temptation he said but i'm not doing it for that and then the servant was the one who went after because he he had a spirit in him that only was revealed in that particular situation and we spent time going to that so this issue of temptation is a real situation and of course jesus being the prime example of being able to stand the test of temptation and i just want to read a few scriptures from throughout the bible to speak to this uh praying that it would encourage you in some way first corinthians 10 and verse 13. they have no temptation taken you but such as is common to man but god is faithful i want us to say faithful god is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able but will with the temptation also make a way of escape that he may be able to bear it so this is a comfort to us that no matter what the temptation is god is faithful he will not suffer he will not allow you to be tempted beyond god is faithful he will not let you be tempted beyond your ability but with the temptation he will also provide the way of escape just a quick point to that he provides a way of escape it's up to you to take you in can i say that one more time provided in a way of escape and you take anyways two different things you know so he can provide away and also make you take it away if a way is there but i better preach about god provided way the way is there the way has been there but few people are want to actually take the weight so that still shows as a measure of choice to you making a decision you know what i am going to get out of this situation anybody with me tonight all right so we just go into a few scriptures james 1 and verse 12. if you want to take note of these blessed is the man that endured temptation for when he is tried he shall receive the crown of life which the lord had promised to them that love him and the church say amen all right so i want us to catch that you know uh blessed anyone who remains in another translation said blessed who remains steadfast under trial steadfast on the trial you have to decide i am not going to give in to whatever it is what my attempt you may not attempt me what my term me may not attempt you or somebody else but whatever the trial is whatever the test comes blessed is the man there's a blessing comes from saying no i am not going i'm not doing it i'm not healing to that can the church say amen still reading from james 1 and and uh verse 13. and i said this point before but i want you to show it in scripture because there are still many people you say well this is is god who is to tempt me and some of that but let no man say when he is tempted i am tempted of god for god cannot be tempted with evil neither tempted he any man but listen carefully but every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust and enticed and when lust had conceived it bringing forth sin and sin when it is finished bring it for debt do not uh my beloved brethren let me read that one more time i want to read it from another translation as well let no one say when he is tempted i am being tempted by god for god cannot be tempted with evil and he himself tempts no one but each person is tempted when he is lord and enticed by his own desire so looking at this now i want to pause there for a minute it means that for jesus to not yield to temptation it meant that the desire to give into what the devil offered was not there so there was nothing he could he couldn't respond in the way that the devil wanted him to respond because there was no desire he wasn't lusting after all of the cities of the world he wasn't lusting after the attention or the offer of the world so i wanted to deal now with this issue of the heart because each person is tempted when he is lord and enticed by his own desire so when a sister falls or brother falls or somebody backslide it is not the devil do them it is what was in their heart found a connection with the offer can i say that one more time it meant that the issue was the issue of the heart so whether it is a loss for money but i'm talking about lots of big things lost for popularity whatever it is if that desire or that lust is there when the temptation comes you will respond because it's in your heart when somebody gets up in an argument when when when is he looking for a fight you you return and you look at the pekka fight it's the desire you know the first instance when people are going to pick a fight the first thing they see that mean you need to pick a fight the fight is happening you're going to look into pick a fight you're looking for reason to blow up you're looking by reason but it's in their heart so this whole issue now of dealing with temptation now brings another dimension to it of what is in your heart and what is in your heart is a function of what you feed in your heart i want this to kind of dwell on this a little bit because and we teach on this already guard your heart because all here is heart are all the issues of life so so if in your heart you in your heart decide you know what i want to have this or that or whatever it is that's the only way when any temptation come i want to nail it down that alignment takes place so we want to break that tonight in two ways you want to break it by the word but more and even on a deeper level you want to deal with the issue of the desires of your heart what is your desire tonight what is your desire tonight let me nail it down again let no one say when he is tempted i am being tempted by god for god cannot be tempted with evil and he himself tempts no one but each person is tempted when he is lord or attracted and enticed by his own desire so when a young sister leave church cut her hair put on makeup throw on her pants it's not the devil do that that was in the heart and it was growing growing growing until it got so big and this is why we say when people leave church they don't happen nobody walks our children are saying they say today i live in church you know something was growing in the heart so that when the temptation come there's a connection building until that connection becomes so strong they could no longer feel comfortable in the presence of god friends don't allow this season that we in to allow the desires of the world to grow on your life anybody with me tonight each person is tempted i want to kneel it down when he is lord and enticed by his own desire let us check our desires tonight david made clear his eyes he and the heart pointed out to the water broke so my heart just after thee that was his desire we sing this song this is my desire to honor you lord with all my heart i worship you friends if you find yourself young brother young sister old but a old sister caleb describe it however you want to because i've seen young i've seen all i've seen all kind of people lose their zeal for the word because of what was in their heart i mean we try to close this up here but each person is tempted when he is lord lord means it's like a snake an attraction something pulling you by your own desire then desire listen is a progression when it has conceived in other words when that you know that conception that desire when it is realized so what brother branham was doing when he put a cross in his car he was trying to nip it at the body because the bible said when you look at the woman to lust after her your heart past tense already committed adultery in your heart so he actually took the whole thing from the beginning of the equation and not even reached the point to look to lust to have desire he stop it early because this is saying each person is tempted i want you to catch it when he is lord and enticed by his own desire then desire when it has conceived give birth to sin and when sin and sin when it is fully grown so you see you seen this here so sid could actually grow and reach a point of full growth when sin is fully grown it brings for debt i want to nail this down friends because debt is striking individuals right now they're walking wrong as dead men because their desire has been conceived and given birth to sin and that sin is growing and growing and growing until debt and they could hear you would they could even believe the word but they did because if the devil could believe and tremble the belief alone is not enough it has to be a heart change is there anybody tonight who wants a heart change let's go on proverbs 6 28 can one go upon hot coals and his feet not be burned i'll say it one more time can one go upon hot coals and his feet not be burned in other words if you know what your vulnerability is why would you put yourself in a position to get destroyed because if you play with fire you're going to get burned can anybody go on hot coals and not get burned how are you protecting yourself in this season and i talk about being fearful i'm talking about protecting that seed in your soul by making better choices better decisions i've said it before like this i said you cannot be praying shouting worshipping and just switch from that into that argument with somebody something wrong you was not in the spirit it's impossible for you to be tarry and sick and you wake up early earlier like seek the scripture and you get up from your knees and having an argument with somebody you just came from the presence of god you could switch that easily so the more you are in the presence of god it's more your behavior your motives your objectives because you're feeding on something your fees can so if you want an antidote to stop argument pray just keep praying when you're feeling to respond and an escalating situation let's say i'm gonna pray i just go and lock your door lock your window go find quantity bed and pray until that sweet presence of god comes over your life and the church say amen let's go on matthew 26 and verse 41. i didn't even realize this was the next one watch and pray that he entered not into temptation i was just saying it the last one i say when you feel it go and pray but look at the scripture here watch and pray that he enter not into temptation his spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak so this puts a whole different dimension to prayer meetings and your own prayer life your own prayer life that gives you fortification that gives you defense i'm not gonna be too much longer with you and of course we read the scripture from the lord's prayer and lead us not in the temptation but deliver us from evil now i just have a few quotes on the prophet just kind of tie this up and then one more scripture and we will close out in prayer tonight from the expression of the seven church ages but abraham is speaking about revelation 3 21 he says to him that overcome it will i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i also overcame and i'm set down with my father in his throne now what are we to overcome that is the normal question to ask here but that is not the actual thought of this verse for it is not so much what we are to overcome listen carefully but how we are to overcome so but ibrahim is saying this scripture the logical thing is to ask what are we to overcome but he said the real thing is really how we are to overcome now this is logical for what for does it matter much what we are doing as long as we know how we can overcome how how a quick look at those scriptures which involve the lord jesus overcoming will break out the truth of this proposition in matthew 4 which we read wherein jesus is tempted of the devil he overcame the personal temptations of satan by the word and by the word only in each of the three major trials that corresponded exactly to the temptation of the garden of eden which we touched on the lust of the flesh the lust of the eye and the pride of life jesus overcame by the word eve fell to the personal temptation of satan by failing to use the word so listen to jesus listen to the birth making the distinction now he said that jesus in each of them three major trials that corresponded exactly to the temptation of the garden of eden he brings the parallel which we did as well the lust of the flesh the lust of the eye and the pride of life jesus overcame by the word so he overcame by the word he fell to the personal temptation of satan by failing to use the word so jesus overcame by the word he said if even use the word at all so jesus used you would eve did not use the word and listen adam fell in direct disobedience to the word so he puts adam in a whole different category because eve should have stayed behind the defense of the world she use it but not adam who knew the word was disobedient to the word i want us to cash out now tonight all right so but jesus overcame by the word and right now so let me say listen to brother madam that this is the only way to be an overcomer also it is the only way that you can know if you are overcoming because that word can't fail can the church say amen revelation 3 10 because thou has kept the word of my patience i also will keep thee from the hour of temptation which shall come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the earth all right we're not gonna kind of skip through that here but you see now in the message who is this manchester but you see in order to stand temptation you had to bypass the geophony you have to come down here in flesh to be tempted by sin so i want us to see now on a spiritual level now that this thing we're talking about is not about destroying you it's not about weakening you it's not about you wondering if you want to make it but god in his great wisdom allowed it to be the case that you had to bypassed your to your authority and have to come down here in flesh to be tempted by sin and then if you stand is there anybody who will stand is there anybody who will resist and overcome anybody in the house tonight he said if you stand all the father had given me will come to me and i'll raise them up at the last days see you had to be there first so but obama was making that connection that because you have representation because you come from another place because you are an attribute of god you will overcome and the promises to the overcomers the same way he overcame his sons will overcome his daughters will overcome the promise of overcoming is upon you maybe you didn't overcome as much as you should have been doing but tonight you are being challenged that you are stronger than you realize there's more in you than you realize the seed germ in you has overcoming built into its encoding and it has been the devil's job to distract you from how strong you are for you to feel you are just like everybody else but if tonight you can catch a revelation that come what me whatever temptation whatever trial we are here tonight to do surgery on your heart that your desires could change so that when the temptation comes it will find no place in you to connect oh somebody help me tonight and when they try to come when the temptation comes trying to find somebody who can identify because of their desire in their heart you would not be the one because your desire is for the things above your desire is for his will your desire is for his purpose your desire is for the holy ghost and when the desire in your heart is for the holy ghost when the holy ghost comes by not the temptation but the holy ghost comes by there's a connection between the desire in your heart for the holy ghost and the holy ghost itself i want to dwell in your heart and because there's a deep call into a deep there's got to be a deep to respond can the church see amen i want to connect this now friends that the word that we have heard all these years has come to us to protect us from the office of the enemy because every temptation every offer of the enemy is the people of us to hell it's to pull us away from our promise is to pull us from manifestation satan thought that he could have pulled jesus with fantastic offers fantastic he said you can rule the world if you worship me but jesus the desire in him was not to rule the world with satan still having a seat as the ceo of the planet jesus desire was to make a way for sons and daughters to take his example and overcome also and to replace the seat that satan had by taking the same book that adam lost and using that book to now call names and to move things and to bring things into existence and to speak when the seven thunders utter am i speaking to anybody tonight is there anybody tonight understanding that the temptations of the coronavirus the temptations it's all distractions it's all things to pull us to the news the news is the temptation the the everything is to distract us from our high calling in christ jesus i want us to fix our compass tonight with compass in our heart to the not i want us to look i want just to turn northwards i want us to align ourselves because there's a there's a great moving of the spirit and in our heart it's not lust and desires or evil but he promised to change our thinking the change of our heart that's what the holy ghost is given for because when the holy ghost comes these temptations brother branham said the things you wanted to do you don't want to do them no more the things that attracted you you don't want them they don't attract you to more the food have a different flavor the parties they look boring to you but if tonight you are still vulnerable recognize that vulnerability and you can come to the cross tonight you could come to the cross tonight if you can recognize you're not where you're supposed to be there's room at the cross for you he loves to take the desires and change it around hallelujah anybody with me tonight oh hallelujah hallelujah i'm trying to wrap up here so your test is coming but i have no doubt about it you're going to overcome god didn't put you here to feel he didn't put you here to fall he put you here to have a testimony just like jesus had a testimony you miss you must have a testimony somebody somewhere will be in their wilderness and say i'm not going to bow down those hebrew boys they were given the temptation if you're born you're going to live but they resisted that because it was not in their heart it was not in their heart caleb said i gave word as it was in my heart what's in your heart tonight oh god give us a heart to serve him give us a heart of worship give us a heart for manifestation amen by the pop world and watch god do great things for us oh i'm trying to find a way to close out here hebrews 4 12 for the word of god is quick and powerful and sharper i love it this description here puts the word in a position that is now it it doesn't even leave the world with one descriptor it it gives multiple descriptions for the word of god it's quick quick the use of quick deal me it's faster than you are the enemy before the enemy can reach you the world can intercept the situation before the enemy can come to your house the world can get there just on time what time was my servant healed what got there faster than this that he could get there it was the world it's quick it's powerful and sharper than any two-headed sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and i have the joint and marrow and as a disearner of the thoughts and intents of the heart listen now neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight talking about the word here and all things are naked and open unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do seeing then listen now that we have a great high priest that has passed into the heavens jesus the son of god let us hold fast our profession this is powerful for we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feelings of our infirmities do you have an infirmity tonight do you have a situation tonight do you have a problem tonight do you have a a challenge tonight the feeling of these infirmities they have the ability to touch him but was in all points tempted like as we are oh yet without sin but brandon said jesus had to deal with sexual temptation jesus had to deal with every temptation but jesus stood in the midst of every temptation but there was no desire in his heart so when the temptation came there was nothing to connect oh come on now there was another connect because he was not of that oh he was tempted in every manner yet without sin let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need also import letter to the hebrews he knew the people were struggling he knew they had the infirmities he knew they had their situations he knew they had their temptations he knew they were worrying if they're gonna make it how they're gonna make it he knew they stumbled he knew they fell but he said this high priest oh that we could go to he understands temptation he understands your pain he understands what these things are because he himself had to go to his test and in his own prayer he said lead us not into temptation but if we are to be led into temptation trust me he give it grace and he give it more grace and he will not give you more than you could bear you could handle it you could handle it you have to know you can handle it you have to know young brother young sister that you could stand in the midst of your job in the midst of your neighborhood in the midst of your business in the midst of your family i don't care who walks away and okay who backs life i don't care who don't believe i don't care what people say do it does not matter all these are distractions all of these are temptations to take your eyes away from the cross to take your eyes away from the rapture to take your eyes away from your destination and god but tonight we fix our face like flint tonight we make our focus clear and our heart pure and our desires right that we want the holy ghost we reject every form of destruction to the enemy we reject every temptation of the enemy let us bow our heads for a word of prayer oh well gracious heavenly father we thank you tonight that you have done lord what we have to go through you have done it you have experienced it you have walked the road and you have proven to us that you understand you know you could empathize you could sympathize you could not identify with what we're going through because you have gone through it lord you understand that this could be so great at times that in your own prayer you say lead us not into temptation but we understand the higher mind of god lord that that there are some of us lord many of us lord oh you have to craft through different journeys to ensure that we pass the test because there's a promise of power a promise of adoption a promise of manifestation and that power cannot be released unless sons and daughters have gone through their place of trying their place of test their proving ground when they are given offers situations opportunities that they need to say no that's not it that's not the word that's not what i am that's not who i am that's not my name lord as as moses said that's not my name that's not my identification temptations they must come they will come we understand this but we understand also that you promise to change our hearts you promise to give us a new heart you promise to change our desires so that when the temptations come they can find no place in us they can find no weakness in us they can find no vulnerability in us because just as sin can grow the word seed in us can grow also grow all the way from faith to charity so father may you bless your church may you bless your people may you bless the believers tonight who have been faithful to report into the call of duty help them to understand that the temptations will come the temptations there's nothing wrong there's nothing wrong with the temptations coming but lord there has to be grace and strength to resist the devil to resist the devil to resist the temptation and to stand on the rock of ages so father may you bless your people may you bless the service tomorrow night may you bless the prayer meeting on friday may you bless us this coming sunday may you bless your church lord as we continue to go through this new normal as it were lord yesterday i believe there are none five deaths in this country it's a new thing to us the way they're publicizing this and all these things happening around us but lord our fate is resting on you our trust is resting on you our hope is resting on you our confidence is resting on you may you bless your people may you bless our pastor may you bless the ministry may you bless the believers may you bless those on this call may you bless those i couldn't make it may you bless those that would hear the tape may you bless your church we commit them into your hands in the precious name of jesus christ amen amen and amen may the lord richly bless you until we meet again stay on the firing line resist the devil the devil has got to flee and let the devil know it is written it is written it is also written it is written about you it is written about me the devil cannot take it out it's already written it's written so let it be done may the lord rich you bless you
