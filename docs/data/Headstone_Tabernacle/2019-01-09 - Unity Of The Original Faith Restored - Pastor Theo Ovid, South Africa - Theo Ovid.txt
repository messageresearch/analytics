been a wonderful two half days or so and we live a million years I have a thousand Tom we can't thank God enough for His grace upon our life so if you don't mind open your Bible to the book of Hebrews chapter three and or you can limit also for us out in the in description if you got it just with your hand so I know you you have it there's a few people that didn't get it yet he push up the trail it's a promise you know all the teams will being hard as it is we had in the last two and half days is about holding on to our own promise what a brand said that you you I think is actually in the book of John chapter eight verse that it we said jesus said to those disciples that believe in him if you continue in my word then are you my disciples indeed not just because you believe on stop the operative word is the continuity continue to believe hallelujah okay he bush at that array let me address you the way Paul addressed you he in accounting for you who you are believing on behalf of you it says wherefore holy presence but the cast of the heavenly calling consider the Apostle and high priest of our profession Christ Jesus who was faithful to him that appointed him as also Moses Mastretta his house for this man was counted more worthy of glory than Moses inasmuch as he that building the house had more honor than the house for every house is beautiful some man but finally he debuted offenses God Eman Moses was rattling health as accessible as the testimony of those things which were to be spoken after but Christ as a song although his own house whose house are we you and myself we are the house of God on one condition if we well past the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope frame onto the end by seven wealth or as the Holy Ghost has said today if you hear his voice harden not your heart but it's as in the provocation in the day of temptation in the wilderness when your brother tempt me and so I walked 40 years I was pleased with that generation and say they are always here in their heart and they have not known my way verse 11 sure I swore in my wrath they shall not enter into my rest first word take heed brethren lest there be in any of us and evil heart of unbelief in departing from the Living God first I think that's what we are doing this morning both excellent one another why it is good today lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin 44 we are mathematic as of Christ if we were the beginning of our confidence steadfast under the and wherefore as the believers are said to die to emphasis a second time if you hear his voice harden not your heart for soon when they have had it provoked help me it was not with them that came out of Egypt with who was equipped 40 years was it not with them that are same with Colossus firm in the wilderness and to will swarthy that they do not enter into his rest but to tell that believeth not soon past 19 we see that they could not enter because of unbelief the Bible scholars had told us it is written in the scripture 365 times do not be afraid that means God is telling us don't be afraid every day of our life including Libya Bible permitted also be a friend Hebrew chapter 4 verse 1 and 2 and say therefore fear lest any promise being left us of entering into the rest any of you should seek the cultures of it for unto us was the gospel preached as well as

tremendous and we looking for a great time in the Lord this morning amen so appreciate the messages reading spoken what I shall faint time-tested time-tested faith and also but a jessee's message a manifestation of the original faith so this morning wanna go straight to the word we wanna stand if you wanna go to Ephesians chapter 4 wanna read from verse 4 to 13 1 a good Jude chapter 1 you wanna read verse 3 and said mark chapter 16 you wanna read from verse 15 to 20 readin Ephesians 4 we didn't from verse 4 there is one body and one spirit even as he a call in one hope of your calling one Lord one feet one baptism one God and Father of all who is above all and through all and in you all but under every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ wherefore he said when he ascended on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men now that he ascended what is it but that he also descended first to the lower parts of the earth he that descended is the same also that ascended up far above heaven that he might fill all things and he gives some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come into the unity of the faith of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ we would add Jude Jude 1:3 beloved when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you want exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered under the scenes and we go to sin mark 16 reading from verse 15 and he said unto them go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature he does believe in his baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover so then after the Lord had spoken unto them he was received up into heaven and sat in the right hand of God and they went forth and preached everywhere the Lord working with them confirming the word with signs following amen may God bless his holy word you may be seated so this morning I have a title unity of the original faith restored by Malachi 4 that's my title this morning unity of the original faith restored by Malachi 4 I never thought contending for the original faith defeat and I believed in my heart and I'm looking forward for it that there is going to be a unity of D faith that's what the Bible says that the five for ministry gonna be here until we all come into the unity of the faith so all the issues in the message was supposed to be sorted out by another Ephesians another Ephesians was to bring us all on the same page because when it come to Ephesians become to one Lord one faith one baptism it has nothing to do with interpretation doctrine and men's idea it's gonna be one Lord it will be one thing it wanna be one baptism all praise the name of the Lord Oh hallelujah are gonna be seated praise God glory to God amen so Berta manaman adoption he's talking about sons and he's talking about the right kind of a son not just sons that war kind it have AB accident sons renegades sons disobedient sons rebellion sons all sons but adoption is the right kind of sons not the right sermon the right kind of sons he's not adopting the sermon he's adopting the man he's not adopting the position he's adopting the man Oh glory to God hallelujah glory to God you have to find a man that he wanna adopt oh praise the name of the Lord we believe that you may be seated and my mom says now when the guy when the Sun is the true Sun and so on and got tests him and try him and go on with the setting mode this is what he said it's no secret we all see it when a man proves that God loves him he takes him out somewhere to himself and in the front of angels do something for him he lifts him up in the presence of God and gives him and fills him and sesamum that is the age we are living in or glory to God hallelujah praise God so in 1906 the precursor revival started and 40 years later it was finished 1946 an angel drop down to come to William Branham to start the adoption season to start the adoption age where he could set out sons born sons filled sons anointed sons and send them out oh god hallelujah praise God glory the God you will be seated so 1946 with the appearing of the angel of the Lord it was seen there was a new trunk shun of time or clothing of God God was seeing a new time is here where the sons of God is about to be born into manifestation Oh hallelujah praise God do you believe that do you believe that or chlorine over you may be seated so God sent a prophet at the end of the laude sin church age to bring us out hallelujah you are not allowed this here you'll be called out into a supernatural age that the devil don't know about he only know about now this year but this is supernatural this is the pride age this is a merry season I am NOT in South Africa I'm in heavenly places this is where we belong we belong to a kingdom not a church kingdom [Applause] Louie oh you

then he said the same holy spirit that's here the Lutheran's that sanctify the Methodists that baptize apparently cough stops it's no second in order the coming of the Lord or chlorine of what I feel something is about to break out why not here why not now why not you give the Lord a show [Applause] [Music] [Applause] we preach the gospel isn't power you shall receive power we have our promise president we have to be on that spectator for it glory to God the same Holy Spirit that save the neutrons let's sit by the methodist baptize the Pentecostal is no in an order the coming of the Lord Jesus when it'll be so powerful that body will come into this group of church that will draw the rest of them from the greatest there will be a resurrection so brother Branham 1954 he said so tonight I represent the I back up a little bit now we are moving right into another great age somebody read this one coming for the rapture of the church a thing about a burrito I mean this we are living in a time of the restoration of the gifts it's humble many a big design churches it's sent the Nazarene backwards it makes my not over the Pentecostal but just the same God is moving right on bringing in listen bringing in the rapture in the faith for his church bringing it in what that's right so tonight listen I represent that hate wallet Paulette listen listen I represent that faith the faith that was once delivered to the scenes in the way of a divine gift this is very important you may be seated he was saying tonight I represent that faith by way of the gift what he's doing here he said the gift is demonstrating and showing something representing the faith but the faith is coming because the faith could only come by the breaking of the seals if we saw back the faith what they had is not a Fiat now it is defeat we want to emphasize that people regional one not be Pentecostal one not they have not the ones they have all wrong and on the TV right now not that that is not original original is alpha original is what people had original and silver and gold have I none such as I have I give it unto you North never move and I said so Oh glory to God that's your rhythm of a [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hooray glory love God you may be seated and this fate is the purpose you have this regional this feat is based upon forgiveness so God put us in this age here the ears are bloody love where people will get cut or finalize that is what miss you and I and we are challenged to forgive we are challenged to drop the Lord's because we have to come to the faith and space participants or get the Lord I stroke [Applause] maybe season [Applause] but a Branham may be seized with numbers on the restaurant and he saw this woman and he began to condemn and say Lord is that's the kind of place my child when the raise up in and so on like that and God taught it on his shoulder pull him aside give him a vision showing when he was sworn his sins coming up to God and the blood of Jesus like a bumper bouncing at all and there again God wrote forgiven but company see forgetfulness and God said I forgive you and you condemn her so he himself had was to be fully fit into perfe kindness into the spirit of forgiveness it's not just saying I forgive you it's a spirit it's an annoying it's a it's something that has to be real when God sees it do you know what we are saying this morning we have to have faith to pull down charity [Applause] maybe see them we have to have faith to pull down the capsule if we have to leave it in the rapture we have to pull down the cap because charity never faileth so it has to have a certain atmosphere and the Prophet said a woman when she's about to give birth regardless if she's a prostitute it doesn't matter what kind of woman a sweet spirit comes around her before she has that baby and if that sweet spirit is not a wrong you maybe you're not pregnant maybe you're not ready maybe having come to full turn but once you come to full turn once you are ready and right now this morning we are pregnant with God we are pregnant but Messiah and once you are come to fulfill a sweet spirit sweet anointing forgiveness it's to be their father forgive them they know not what they do or get the Lord a shock even Jesus even Jesus manifested it even Jesus expressed it this is it that peace upon forgiveness Oh glory to God I think it's in a message for the brown school Baram says rapture and fate will only be revealed to those who forgive their brothers [Applause] [Music] I'm ten feet will only be revealed the doors who forgive their brothers Oh Maureen Oh God you may be seated hallelujah hallelujah and you know what the Prophet said when the church signs is popular when the church find its holy pieces you when the church finds its place in Christ it will call to the other members of the body come on let's shout come I rejoice with us we are from the point that yes yes not from our school no come on rejoice pick up the coin the place has been restored or glory of God and once that fear that we store you could have begin to see a unity of the face you will see the pressure and begin to coddle together or glory they're gone you may be seated or glory laron a unity of the face so I say this with Charlie one-man show is over years ago we went to jaha butter blue to my remember dad's we went to Nigeria and there was a guy in a hotel you call him Charlie one-man show he sat there he had something behind his head yet an old organ here yeah here you got something else here and he's playing this I'm blowing this unclean this calling charlie one-man show he have all different kind of instrument all around him and he alone doing everything or glory that day is over by them it have no Sally one-man show God has given grace that every gift but finds its place no one man have to fight for ministry no one man you did God so small to put the whole cycle in one man this omnipotent omniscient all-powerful and it gives some pastors he gave some teachers he gave some apostles he gave some evangelists he gets some prophets [Applause] and bringing these virtues into you the scenes Oh God maybe season the Spirit of God is not something it can't be cooled into you the spirit can't be cooled into you so all this teaching can teach the spirit unto you he said it is something that is predestinated into you by the hand of Almighty God your experiences cannot be schooled or taught into you it is predestinated look at brother Branham walk into the house of God two people carry on making love in the church Holy Spirit drop down whatever you see whatever you see whatever you see up someone blame option to death absent record even more the up service [Applause] so a brother come against you and the Lord drop down what do you see you see white Bordeaux on the default because it's right now we are saying the wrong thing what the peloton says he said I forgive you no no no we can't even get I can attest because a decoy : people hope one time those people will get thrown on the church we can't even get that kind of test we can't even get a pants wearing woman test to come inside the church because she got dressed right oh she don't want the dress she's a sinner the spirit and the bride say come whosoever will let them come to the door [Applause] [Music] well maybe season when we lust for knowledge it's a sin to do so it's a strong statement this one my message sit-ins eating butter brown now someone's tree into this messaging lust for knowledge but the Bible prophesy that their people last happen kitchen ears you want to know easily dismiss tree that they can understand and Christ is the mystery of God reveal I have read and preached so much a deep stuff and I'm not nothing about the life stuff is because butter bottom said it I do not the coat yet he said the mysteries was revealed that we couldn't see the plainness of God and know how to behave ourselves in the present day that we live in hell the mysteries are not revealed for information sake it's revealed that we can see the plainness of God and know how to behave so it come back to a behavior that God must approve Oh glory to God amen shiburin says the thing I meant today we don't try to establish the Word of God in the people's heart we try to establish ourselves or churches I trying to establish the doctrine of the church in the person's heart we are commanded to establish the Word of God you may be seated Paul said any good Paul I didn't come to you with enticing words of man that your faith might rest on the knowledge of the man I come to you can power and manifestation of the Holy Ghost that your faith might rest in God so Paul was careful that the people not impressed with his knowledge and information and revelation as opposed to having confidence in the power that got to use him hallelujah God can use that man of God and deal with your heart and deliver your spirit and free your soul by the power of Almighty God Alleluia and the word is the conductor of the spirit so that's why the word was fought and the spirit could follow that word and bring that complete deliverance he said establish the Word of God take all the unbelief and establish the king of God in on my heart and the kingdom of God can be established in a man's heart least what me that man does Oh God when the Son of man cometh shall he find that feet on the dirt he said we store the feet of the children back to the feet of the father's original word back to the faith of the father's original word Oh glory to God not if it was delivered he said defeat and defeat was once a better the Saints not a field people say is against my faith there's only one fate there's only one law so what are we against what is people against in this message when there was only one fate become the priest I picked this morning there's only one fate or glory to God hallelujah praise God we believe that now the only way that we ever want to know if we can find out what the fate is then we can ill Missy contention that fate no the faith was once delivered if you go back to where they were first called scenes and what the fate was what they come have the content for and that would church to say which means sanctified they had a faith there we go in our resurrected living Christ someone who rose from the dead and was living among them just to see him as he was before he died it wasn't contented for some historical of fear but they were contending for a living Christ who was in their myths get a little while the were seeing me no more but you shall see me and that is what the Apostles believed they believed that he was in the flesh and he was more in the spirit that is what they taught that is what they believe the practice and that is what God confirmed and that's the very faith this that we had in the beginning is supposed to be today that same fate in a resurrected Christ not just talking about brother Branham but talking about now right now say it in the living Christ among the bride of Jesus Christ Oh glory to God hallelujah praise God oh yes listen to this we have had plenty past were plenty trucks and theology around the world let's call it spoken word books let's call Bibles Jesus Jesus Jesus said go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature but around then he meant to go in the world and demonstrate the power of God that's the gospel or blowing it for a stubborn man preach you say you know what I'm waiting on I'm waitin on he's alone all glory to God and he's talking I'm just talking and he is talking all of a sudden say he is here yes yeah he's I take every spin Gloria listen this in order to preach the gospel before you can make it a customer preach you have got to have the power and demonstration of the Holy Spirit to prove the gospel the letter killeth the spirit make it align it is not a ritualistic of fear it is absolutely a real living reality of the resurrection of Jesus living among men and that's the faith I'm trying my best to contend for today that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and this power is unlimited so the Prophet said missing limbs will be restored [Applause] do you have faith for that missing limbs will be restored [Music] [Applause] seems like people are more faith any doctors that in God doctors say take six bills four pairs Reapers to take all the pills without question about question take this twice a day treat them today whatever they are you doing everything in the Gaza but God said you shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover what is the god of miracles he forget the miracle this morning he's still work miracles he's still open the blinds he's still crippled the world he's still netiquette Oh Diaz clock this morning [Applause] hee hee hee [Applause] easy [Music] [Applause] and the Anointed of God maybe season 1 say if you take your awful noisy bunch I can prove to you it ain't no easy if there ain't no noisy hypno but they're all glory to God is none rise hallelujah praise God so you may be seated so dude hallelujah spoke about contending for this faith that was once delivered under recipherus they had was the manifest they couldn't ready money has that faith until they went to the upper room to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost isn't that right and that faith produced another book of Acts it wasn't the acts of man it was the acts of the Holy Ghost operated through men and the book of Acts had no leader the book I had has no headquarters and had no bishop and had no mighty book message van it had nothing like that it was the acts of the Holy Ghost and my 10 sons of God and directing them and leave them as to what to do and what a banner prophesied there'll be another book of Acts or glory of God that means there's gonna be angels there's won't be visions this will be powers but that means angels it means visitation I am nothing to top the target this is where I belong this is my message [Applause] [Music] maybe season blood did the freeze of a man to be a bishop over you you're not wife of some man you are the wife of the Lamb let us rejoice and be glad for the marriage of the lamb is come on [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] Fuli butter Baron said I wasn't the one that appeared on the river I was only standing there when he appeared I'm not the one that foretells these things that happens as perfect as they are I'm only one that hears when he does it I was only a voice he used to say it I surrendered myself it was it was the man [Applause] [Music] on the sea to come with a CD beside the seed of the entire Bible going to be shown in a bride a pyramid wrap up and see for this was healed this this book was sealed with seven seals Oh glory to God hallelujah praise God what about himself these messengers they were hit in the seals a satire coffee he said they were mysteries so they were hidden mysteries so when you see red horse and white horse that's the devil seen that goon but when the high red horse behind that boy he was his but whatever I'm came and revealed all those hidden mysteries [Applause] [Music] [Applause] nobody knew but I always always [Applause] then the man anointed and the Eagle anointing unless but I don't fly with the Eagle anointing and prophesy deceits will fall and the huts of the predestinated around the world that's how we africa because as a bride in south africa no man could hold back this bride in South Africa God will move the man out listen listen this is a junction for the whole message world that was going to be at unity of the faith the devil hardest long enough but decisions and confusion the devil had a slowly enough reduction of distances but I am saying this with one Lord one said one Holy Ghost baptism let's press for that let's push for that not a seizure [Applause] [Applause] this book was read this message malachi forward through two things accord the malachite falling with ten have returned back to the father's to he revealed a mission to seven thunders which other revelations contained in the seven seals it will be DS d finally reveal mystery truths that literary to enhance our friend back to the Pentecostal farmers and some but people believe that e more treats to reveal is important as it is because this here is written the way it is let's see what else the prophecies will turn our hands back to the feet of the fastest oh my you see because any fate because fiat he says the bible is the road map that leads to the power of god and faith leads you to the power so man cackling they have seen that no power what kind of fate is that meat and power will produce the promise did you get that say it brings you to power power produces a promise to manifest the promise we need power and the Prophet says because we find out in Malachi 4 there is to be an anointing come down to restore again the original faith to bring the faith of the people back to the original Pentecost the feet of the fathers an anointing to come down right let me know sit down bottom your seats we in for I notice enter evangelism it's not be shut receiving and believe the endtime evangelism is to restore he is going to restore a tree that we believe the world and when she come up under there Pentecost if that original doctrine that were written our faith watch what bring them back to the Father in the restoration [Applause] so people sit down in this message for years under the Ministry of the word but there's a prophecy that we're gonna turn to the Ministry of the sheraton maybe turning today maybe turning right now and it will be different you may be seated my Timmy's brother Peter was seen four hundred years silence men with tall hats dong dongs ceremonial guys Pharisees and scribes everything normal normal nothing interrupts India reality and the ritual and Here Come John the Baptist vice of one panel illness shaken up the whole system hallelujah come Jesus come into the temple as usual Jesus every Saturday every Sabbath day Jesus in the temple this time Jesus [Music] [Applause] they didn't know he just overcome the lust of the eyes overcome the lusts of the flesh himself right it is written the didn't know I'm knocking apart the steering and he found a book in the prophet Isaiah the Spirit is upon me and people sleeping in service but the Spirit is upon me because he has anointed me and the Pharisees death he will be seasoned all of a sudden but that was one thing with the seal hat but then he said this day but that is when they take the glasses on do so he said this day the scripture is fulfilled in your [Applause] he's nominated he throw his scriptures he's not ready for the ministry or give them are some phrases in every season I'm going to what kinda annoyed you that's the devil telling you that go when go get set up a shawl he tells Samuel go to the holster Jesse and I knowing one of his son skin I went Jesse went by the horn and oil there was no witness on Davis brothers there and Jesse said isn't there one more they say yeah but right now he with the Sheep smelling like it looking like it just like he's shepherd boy send for him they become your service service you sent to me yes sir when Samuel saw that boy [Music] [Applause] but once i anoint you this morning here one here's what I want to get to you David wasn't ready to be king he was a shepherd boy but he was anointed to be king you're told to be ready to be anointed or give the Lord a shout [Applause] notice the Empire messenger this job will be to get the scenes ready the bridegroom ready that will be his message for the bride the bride ready for the ride Roman what bring back the church to the world now what is this message of Malachi 4:2 do restore back to original faith the resurrection feet so for the random called the original faith the resurrection feet you may be seated because they had effect before Jesus died and under that faith they was cast out Devils do not stop they were gifted under that feet and when he died widow and fishes everybody forget the revelation that he was supposed to have everybody do in the morning but Jesus appear today another faith now is anointed there have the holy ghost yet there had the upper room yet but their faith is anointed because you opened the world and open it understanding that they might understand the scriptures there is a goonie upper room until she power from on high on high this fall coming from above mr. back the original fate the resurrection fit and he explains it here that the same Jesus that they're seen Jesus I figured reason the dead seen him working I'm going down let's continue praise go from Juba jira 1962 is one of my favorite quotes he said we are waiting for something that's going to take the feet 1962 he seen being beaten on something that's what take the feet and we saw the feet of the cheering back to the original Pentecostal tree all the denominational crease eats it down God said I will restore it in the last days it will be restored get a prophecy God shall send the Holy Ghost in such a way upon planted with that it will restore so we still come in from these seven thunders but we going on deeper now how that will be because these truths will bring season to you which will be planted word and now you take the Holy Ghost to come upon planted wood and it will be restored God shall send the Holy Ghost in such a way upon planted wood that it will restore the message that Gracie said the suffered angel messenger what's the restored of faith and return back to the father's in other words rebuild the church again under the power of the Spirit not by God not by night but by my spirit says the Lord not by organization not by denomination but by the Holy Spirit God will bring the tooth in the last days or glory to go to all these teachings and all these revelations it has to be converted something has to change or glow in a glowing butter brown wasn't a mountain a blast went for three blasts one two three he said the Brethren heard the blasts but I heard the voice the boy said judgment striking Westeros the Brethren who the blasts so they get one last revolution like for myself well glory no God is how its interpreted Scripture voice of one time the wilderness that's the word but that's also a jug we'll just shall conceive that's the word but that is merely what Malachi 4 6 that's the word that's you the children who has to be chained back to the fate of the Pharaohs that's in the book but that's yeah this morning your hats literally glory to God you will be seated from a recognizing idea this message national force but Israel in the homeland national force or put the church and the work into the churches but the power of God will put the people in the bride Oh glory to God it will take the power of God to put the people in brand then he spoke about an adoption he's talking about coming on and and the mothers being placed groaning and the labor pains and so on he's in our church go to labor pains they get tremendous sometimes I went a church is groaning under the persecution of the outside world they're leaving on the Lord Jesus that the promise of the Holy Ghost is just as real as it was the Pentecost and this is the problem I don't hear people talking about it that's just such a real Oh glory to God I want what Peter had just what Paul had those brothers had it but everyone came that we kind of go forward until we go back and pick up what they have we have to go and pick up the field that they have because that is the original City its original turn to face the rapture those guys were adopted those guys have the Holy Ghost but time ran out on them and they fell into the ground but be who are live and remain alive and renamed shall attend to them he said hold a groan and cry in the river pains but when they are born unprofesional e born into the church into the kingdom of God then the Holy Ghost sets in the church some apostles some prophets some teachers some passes snip Angeles praise God then he give it to destigmatize praise God hallelujah interpretation and tongues and O'Connor miracles oh please hallelujah praise God so when the Son of man cometh shall he find faith yes because all that dwell on the earth shall be received except the names written in the Lamb's Book of Life for the foundation of the world or glory the one if your name is written you will act like it you will do like it all praise be to Jesus thank you Lord hallelujah praise be to Jesus very few will to recognize the name on the book John saw his name and John had a behavior free is called you could yeah kind of missing the early church failed because the people take the anointing are they taking magic of the people and put it on a man we better become a poop Nicole eaten and then become a doctrine then become a man and the church fell away from that God his organization he hits the domination he hits a man that is like button on top but his affinity of the local church because once it go to this bishop and Archbishop and somebody higher and man is man man is still man he still one power still one power without character but God is still God he will give you power with character or glory record him and lets up be the name of the Lord we believe it oh praise God hallelujah so this morning we are free we are free from man system I've told some of the brothers any any vision that is connected to any man group huge country is not on Cooper vision the Prophet was an open vision a pro/con vision is that Iraq would and the Lord if I have to come from Africa to get something something wrong because Jesus said if they say go here go

done is right now it never was attacked anywhere else they went off on the anomalous breeze you may be seated I want you to get this this is supremely important trans important he said no watch it

objective that's the ball the spirit come to the people we see nations u19 we see the world unite and praise God we see the pride unite in uniting with the word why the word is God as the bridegroom

body swarming ourselves into his image and see you 19 himself with us in his works the dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the Holy Spirit that we have worked in a small measure while the headstone is coming down to unite with the body and went ahead and bought unites together the full power of the Holy Ghost would raise our so the head connects with the body and the full power of the
