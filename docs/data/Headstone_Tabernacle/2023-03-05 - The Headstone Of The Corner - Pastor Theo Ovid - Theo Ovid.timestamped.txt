[1:09:51] one of us should do this please God will
[1:09:54] I am just doing what I feel led to do
[1:10:01] you have to find it there's some uh Acts
[1:10:02] chapter 10. there was a certain man in
[1:10:05] Caesarean named Cornelius a centurion of
[1:10:08] the band called Italian band
[1:10:10] these are the Jew he's a gentile
[1:10:12] a devout man
[1:10:15] he didn't get my present in Jesus name
[1:10:16] he committed Fellowship no church he had
[1:10:18] no Bible no book
[1:10:19] one that feared God that any kind of
[1:10:21] money is with all his hopes and give
[1:10:24] much arms to the people
[1:10:28] might attack the pocket
[1:10:30] could we tell them that you ain't going
[1:10:31] good they don't want you they don't want
[1:10:33] to put their honey give it nothing the
[1:10:34] mean of the devil
[1:10:37] in church
[1:10:38] this man he's not in church
[1:10:41] he's not a believer
[1:10:42] he is devote God see in that he has just
[1:10:45] got seeing that he feared God God seeing
[1:10:48] that he given much God seeing that and
[1:10:51] he prayed to God always
[1:10:54] you're here about 700 Revival yet
[1:10:58] but be praying to God
[1:11:00] always for your gossip pray to God
[1:11:03] before you complain pray to God I've
[1:11:05] been saying 90 percent of the people
[1:11:06] they complaining to they don't want to
[1:11:08] hear your complaints they don't want to
[1:11:09] hear your story you're coming across
[1:11:11] negative 10 of the people want you to be
[1:11:14] as you are they're happy when you're in
[1:11:16] trouble
[1:11:19] to take your burden to the Lord and
[1:11:22] leave it there
[1:11:24] Hallelujah
[1:11:26] so God give Cornelius a vision to send
[1:11:28] for Peter because Peter is in the body
[1:11:32] and the blood of God runs through the
[1:11:33] body
[1:11:35] germs come from the body
[1:11:37] isn't that right Peter under the other
[1:11:40] hand got a vision also rise and eat God
[1:11:43] is showing him to do something he never
[1:11:45] did before
[1:11:46] because he never ministered his Gentiles
[1:11:48] before
[1:11:48] and Peter there came a voice Peter said
[1:11:50] rise and eat but Peter said not so Lord
[1:11:52] I have never eaten anything common or
[1:11:54] unclean and the voice speak unto him
[1:11:56] again second time saying what God has
[1:11:58] cleansed
[1:11:59] Thou shalt not call command
[1:12:02] so if we don't know could teach us
[1:12:05] to reveal to us to bring Clarity to his
[1:12:08] purpose in your life because sometimes
[1:12:10] God called it to do things that you're
[1:12:11] not expected that your human Spirit
[1:12:13] might might get problems with watch now
[1:12:17] when Peter doubted in himself what his
[1:12:19] vision which he had seen should mean
[1:12:20] behold men which was sent from Cornelius
[1:12:23] had made inquiry for Simon's house stood
[1:12:25] before the gate
[1:12:33] spirit is speaking arise get it down go
[1:12:37] with them doubting nothing for I have
[1:12:39] sent them
[1:12:41] I have sent them then Peter went on to
[1:12:44] the man which was sent from unto him for
[1:12:45] Cornelius and said behold I am here with
[1:12:47] whom don't seek what is the cause
[1:12:49] wherever you have come then said
[1:12:51] Cornelius the Centurion or just man one
[1:12:53] that favorite God of good report among
[1:12:55] all the nation of the Jews was born from
[1:12:57] God by an Holy Angel to send for thee
[1:13:00] unto his house and to hear words of Thee
[1:13:03] then calling them in and Lodge them and
[1:13:05] on the more Peter went away with them
[1:13:07] and certain bedroom dropper accompany
[1:13:09] him the president come with Peter too
[1:13:11] and and tomorrow after the international
[1:13:13] caesarea Cornelius greeted for them had
[1:13:16] called them together his kinsman's near
[1:13:18] friends and as Peter was coming and
[1:13:20] Cornelius met him and fell long at his
[1:13:22] feet and worship him Peter took him up
[1:13:24] and saying stand up I myself also I'm a
[1:13:27] man
[1:13:31] explanation by the reason that he bow
[1:13:32] you know because he anointed me
[1:13:37] he saw the anointed upon me that that's
[1:13:39] why he born you know so don't be hard on
[1:13:41] him Peter wasn't that foolishness
[1:13:43] make an excuse for man worship and
[1:13:45] pumping up man and whatnot Peter said no
[1:13:47] no I'm not sure man and he talked with
[1:13:50] him he went in and found many that will
[1:13:52] come together he said to them he know
[1:13:54] how that is unlawful thing for a man
[1:13:56] that is a Jew to keep company or common
[1:13:58] to want that of another Nation but God
[1:14:01] showed me that I should not call any man
[1:14:03] common or unclean therefore came I unto
[1:14:06] you without gain saying as soon as I was
[1:14:08] sent for I asked therefore for what
[1:14:11] intent you have sent for me I call you I
[1:14:14] said four days ago I was fasting oh my
[1:14:17] God
[1:14:18] you hear that word as I would foreign
[1:14:21] now you know this thing called fast
[1:14:25] in church but he
[1:14:27] I was fasting
[1:14:30] until this hour and at the ninth hour I
[1:14:33] prayed in my house
[1:14:34] and behold a manager before me in bright
[1:14:37] clothing I said Cornelius my prayers
[1:14:39] heard
[1:14:41] baptized
[1:14:44] a church or older and God said
[1:14:47] your prayer
[1:14:49] so you can't judge people all day you
[1:14:51] know because God know what's inside the
[1:14:53] heart God know what the praying you
[1:14:55] can't say because this man's not in
[1:14:56] church because you don't believe what we
[1:14:58] believe no no no no no no you not the
[1:15:00] judge of that let God deal with that
[1:15:02] that's sincere genuine people that may
[1:15:04] never step into this building that may
[1:15:06] never come to this church or whatever it
[1:15:07] is but they love God they have a heart
[1:15:09] for God and they're crying out to God
[1:15:11] for help for deliverance for
[1:15:13] breakthrough
[1:15:14] [Music]
[1:15:17] Cornelius thy prayers heard thine arms
[1:15:20] are hard in remembrances so God even
[1:15:22] commended them he's given
[1:15:25] free
[1:15:27] your arms are held in remembrance in the
[1:15:31] sight of God
[1:15:32] send therefore to Japan call Heather
[1:15:34] Simon who sent him as Peter he's lodging
[1:15:36] the house of one Simon attana by the Sea
[1:15:38] and he shall speak unto thee immediately
[1:15:41] therefore I send to thee and thou has
[1:15:43] wealth as well done that thou had come
[1:15:45] now therefore are we all here present
[1:15:48] before God to hear all things that
[1:15:50] commandity of God so what they're saying
[1:15:52] there Peter you are a spokesman God sent
[1:15:55] you to bring words to us
[1:16:00] then Peter opened his mouth instead of a
[1:16:02] truth I perceive that God is no
[1:16:06] respecter
[1:16:07] prisons
[1:16:08] but in every nation either feared him
[1:16:10] and work at righteousness is accepted
[1:16:12] with him the word which God sent unto
[1:16:15] the children of Israel preaching Peace
[1:16:17] by Jesus Christ he is Lord of all the
[1:16:19] word I say you know which was published
[1:16:20] throughout Julia beginning From Galilee
[1:16:23] and the baptism is John preached oh God
[1:16:25] anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy
[1:16:28] Ghost and with power listen to Peter's
[1:16:30] testimony how God anointed Jesus of
[1:16:33] Nazareth where the Holy Ghost went power
[1:16:35] who went about doing good and healing
[1:16:37] all our oppressed of the devil for God
[1:16:39] was with him and we Are Witnesses of all
[1:16:41] things which he did both in the land of
[1:16:43] the Jews and in Jerusalem and they slew
[1:16:46] and hung on a tree him God raised up the
[1:16:49] third day and showed him openly not to
[1:16:52] all the people but unto Witnesses chosen
[1:16:55] before God even to us who did eat and
[1:16:59] drink with him after he rose from the
[1:17:01] dead so Peter is testifying that he is
[1:17:04] risen he is resurrected the Christ will
[1:17:07] tell him but they're not dead price the
[1:17:09] gospel we preacher and no dead gospel it
[1:17:11] is resurrected it is quick name it is
[1:17:13] alive he is raised from the dead
[1:17:16] Hallelujah
[1:17:18] verse 42 and he commanded us to preach
[1:17:21] unto the people and to testify that it
[1:17:24] is he which was ordained of God to be
[1:17:26] the judge of the quick and the dead to
[1:17:28] him give all the prophets witness that
[1:17:30] through his name whosoever believeth in
[1:17:33] him shall receive remissions of sins
[1:17:34] while Peter
[1:17:38] speak these words
[1:17:40] the Holy Ghost
[1:17:41] [Music]
[1:17:42] [Applause]
[1:17:44] fell
[1:17:45] [Music]
[1:17:48] on all them
[1:17:50] which heard the word
[1:17:52] that means the Holy Ghost could fall on
[1:17:55] you
[1:17:56] today
[1:17:57] oh give the Lord some praises
[1:18:00] not the pastor shake your hand not an
[1:18:03] explanation of the Holy Ghost but this
[1:18:05] Holy Ghost we're talking about
[1:18:07] it has fallen you
[1:18:09] anointed
[1:18:13] fall on me
[1:18:15] [Applause]
[1:18:18] anointing Hallelujah
[1:18:22] fall on me
[1:18:26] [Music]
[1:18:28] Corey
[1:18:31] so Peter was so anointed you may be
[1:18:33] seated so traumatized with the power and
[1:18:35] presence of God
[1:18:37] that the words coming out of his lips
[1:18:39] were the words of God
[1:18:41] and the Holy Spirit the spirit follows
[1:18:43] what
[1:18:44] the spirit follows the words so Peter
[1:18:47] was with me flesh
[1:18:49] world was coming out of his mouth and
[1:18:51] the spirit began to follow what Peter
[1:18:53] was saying so after a while the word
[1:18:56] convert the spirit because Jesus said
[1:18:58] the words that I speak unto you
[1:19:00] they are Spirit they are life
[1:19:04] so Peter was speaking words and during
[1:19:06] the words being spoken it must transform
[1:19:10] to Spirit and the spirit fell upon them
[1:19:13] and quickened what was in them okay the
[1:19:16] Lord some Praises okay the Lord has
[1:19:18] shouted the house
[1:19:19] glory to God the spirit come like water
[1:19:22] the Spirit come like rain
[1:19:25] spirit is quick than power
[1:19:27] or glory to God
[1:19:34] listen
[1:19:36] and they of the circumcision which
[1:19:38] believed were astonished this is shock
[1:19:40] treatment for them the president
[1:19:42] repeater all of them as many that came
[1:19:44] with Peter because on the Gentiles also
[1:19:47] was poured out what that would poured
[1:19:49] out
[1:19:50] the fighting already
[1:19:52] on the Gentiles was poured out the gift
[1:19:55] of the Holy Ghost
[1:19:57] and they heard them speak with tongues
[1:19:58] and magnify God then answer Peter can
[1:20:01] any man forbid water that he should not
[1:20:03] be baptized which have received the Holy
[1:20:06] Ghost as well as we
[1:20:07] the same Holy Ghost we receive them have
[1:20:09] to but as soon as I get baptized in
[1:20:11] water oh give the Lord a shout and if
[1:20:14] God could feel Cornelius if God could
[1:20:16] fill out Gentile man that's not that
[1:20:19] that has nothing baptized in Jesus name
[1:20:20] why God can't fill you this morning
[1:20:22] come on come on come on come on people
[1:20:24] come on hallelujah praise are showing
[1:20:27] you that this thing is real this thing
[1:20:30] is positive this thing is Possible Oh
[1:20:33] Glory to God hallelujah praise God
[1:20:35] hallelujah glory to God
[1:20:38] so the Dynamics is about to break
[1:20:41] upon the bride around the world
[1:20:44] for the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:20:46] given a Feeling
[1:20:48] and refilling
[1:20:50] and then to form us into the wood image
[1:20:52] which is virtue and knowledge and
[1:20:54] Temperance and patience and Godless and
[1:20:55] broadly kindness isn't that right and
[1:20:57] after that to do what
[1:20:59] to send us into the wilderness
[1:21:01] to be tried
[1:21:03] and nobody press come down not yet
[1:21:06] because when Jesus got his measure
[1:21:09] Hallelujah the fullness of the Holy
[1:21:11] Ghost when it hit Jesus so Jesus said
[1:21:14] come on and say I am Jesus you know I
[1:21:16] have full measure here a charge no the
[1:21:20] Bible said the spirit
[1:21:21] let him

[1:21:26] let him
[1:21:28] into the willingness to overcome the
[1:21:30] loss of the eyes to overcome the loss of
[1:21:32] the flesh to overcome the pride of life
[1:21:34] to have a personal one-on-one man or a
[1:21:37] manual with Lucifer himself and when he
[1:21:40] finished with Lucifer he returned into
[1:21:43] the temple and the Spirit came back upon
[1:21:45] him then he found the place where it was
[1:21:47] written the spirit and the bride the
[1:21:50] spirit is upon me because he had
[1:21:52] anointed me oh God have mercy and the
[1:21:56] pride will come back after a place I
[1:21:59] tried come back and say the spirit is
[1:22:03] now upon me because the spirit will come
[1:22:05] upon the bride that is thirsty at the
[1:22:08] Lord that is Dusty in the scriptures

[1:22:34] to God in and
[1:22:35] wait
[1:22:37] let's continue
[1:22:38] Luther pre-justification but he let it
[1:22:41] run wild because he didn't live long
[1:22:43] enough
[1:22:44] and they organized Luther never
[1:22:45] organized it the church Wesley they got
[1:22:49] the Wesleyan Church after that come John
[1:22:51] Smith and the Baptist on Alexander
[1:22:52] Cameron support and they were reformers
[1:22:55] that didn't live long enough to get it
[1:22:57] together
[1:22:57] so a lot of loose ends were left what
[1:23:00] about this many Muslim but using title
[1:23:02] and many of those things that are left
[1:23:04] loose but when we come to the end this
[1:23:07] is us now to the last message is
[1:23:10] supposed to straighten all that up to
[1:23:12] bring all these things to one fate
[1:23:15] one Lord
[1:23:16] one baptism in other words another
[1:23:19] Ephesians so this message is to bring us
[1:23:21] into the Ephesians which were the
[1:23:23] elected Church the collation the
[1:23:26] Galatians was the Corinthians were
[1:23:27] Slackers I'd walk on a crazy living
[1:23:29] harmonica region the Galatians was
[1:23:31] legalists Hebrews was babies but the
[1:23:34] ideal bright church was Ephesus Church
[1:23:37] that Paul was the pastor of
[1:23:40] so we have to come back to the to the
[1:23:42] ideal I am Alpha and Omega so what God
[1:23:45] promised to restore the last days and
[1:23:46] another Ephesian Church our Ephesians
[1:23:49] Church who find them who say the
[1:23:51] apostles found them are not
[1:23:52] unfortunately Liars they were not
[1:23:54] preachers these were Believers exposed
[1:23:57] and then ministers those impersonators
[1:23:59] those charlatans okay the Lord some
[1:24:02] Praises oh give the Lord some Praises
[1:24:04] you talk about the Glorious Church
[1:24:06] Without spotter wrinkle God gonna bring

[1:24:26] unto a perfect man you are going to come
[1:24:30] into a perfect man
[1:24:31] [Music]
[1:24:36] I will tell you plain this gospel is not
[1:24:39] about the preaching you know this gospel
[1:24:41] is God God's people
[1:24:42] if the preacher flopped one raise up a
[1:24:44] next man go down by preacher did he have
[1:24:46] a final next one you have no time to
[1:24:48] waste when Moses that he said in Joshua
[1:24:50] Moses my servant is dead now take these
[1:24:52] people over or give the Lord some
[1:24:54] Praises godhead and the weep and mourn
[1:24:56] and cry about nothing nothing is by
[1:24:59] chance all things are ordained of God we

[1:25:13] all right let's go here now watch this
[1:25:15] here now this is a key part
[1:25:18] of this message this morning but what
[1:25:20] you're about to say now after the Bible
[1:25:22] had been interpreted

[1:25:30] pyramid but the cap on the pyramid was
[1:25:33] never put on I've been in Cairo in Egypt
[1:25:35] the cap never did come because it was a
[1:25:40] Cornerstone
[1:25:42] so God designs the count
[1:25:45] as a Cornerstone
[1:25:47] but the Cornerstone is also the Capstone
[1:25:50] is also the headstone
[1:25:52] oh they're looking for the Capstone but

[1:33:13] Hallelujah
[1:33:15] Hallelujah
[1:33:18] up to nowhere and get to the key thing I
[1:33:20] want to say here yet
[1:33:22] he said the cap never did come
[1:33:24] because it was a Cornerstone
[1:33:26] it was a headstone
[1:33:29] then he rephrased it he said in the
[1:33:32] church it was the Cornerstone in the
[1:33:34] full church is The Headstone and unless
[1:33:37] he's saying in the church it was
[1:33:39] Ephesians 2 20. we are built upon the
[1:33:41] foundation of the Apostles and Prophets
[1:33:44] with Jesus himself as the Chief
[1:33:46] Cornerstone so in the early church that
[1:33:48] was the Cornerstone but the Cornerstone
[1:33:50] now become The Headstone
[1:33:52] ah and the stone the pillar reviews has
[1:33:55] become The Headstone of the corner and
[1:33:58] the Bible said this is the Lord's doing
[1:34:01] for Give the Lord a shout this is the
[1:34:05] Lord's doing it is marvelous in our eyes
[1:34:08] this is the day
[1:34:10] this is the day that the Lord had made
[1:34:14] we are going to rejoice
[1:34:16] and be glad in it
[1:34:18] oh my
[1:34:20] hallelujah praise God praise God praise
[1:34:23] God praise God hallelujah hallelujah
[1:34:26] glory to God glory to God
[1:34:30] glory to God
[1:34:32] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:34:34] glory to God glory to God hallelujah
[1:34:38] give me season
[1:34:40] so listen
[1:34:41] that's the reason the devil fight
[1:34:43] broadly kindness
[1:34:45] that's the reason the devil fought
[1:34:46] against the spirit of forgiveness
[1:34:48] because as long as we don't have that
[1:34:50] Spirit as long as we catch up our Earth
[1:34:53] we cannot break into the Holy Spirit
[1:34:55] notice where the holy spirit is placed
[1:34:58] right on top of Brotherly kindness when
[1:35:01] you stand praying for Dynamics for the
[1:35:04] Holy Ghost for the baptism forgive if
[1:35:07] you have ought against any so the devil
[1:35:09] jumped all these years was to ensure
[1:35:12] people mine and caress they Grudge and
[1:35:15] they ought and they keep renewing their
[1:35:18] membership in The Grudge Affair renewing
[1:35:21] the Envy every year they're taking a
[1:35:23] fresh renewal of the hatred praise God
[1:35:26] some passes even put it upon the people
[1:35:28] oh glory to God but that can't attract
[1:35:31] the Holy Ghost what attract the Holy
[1:35:33] Ghost it's a spirit of forgiveness when
[1:35:35] you could drop your heart against your
[1:35:37] husband against your wife against your
[1:35:39] children against the boss against your
[1:35:40] sister against your brother against your
[1:35:42] family against their sister against this
[1:35:44] brother I just a pastor against some
[1:35:46] Elder you drop it drop it drop it drop
[1:35:48] it drop it okay the Lord some Praises
[1:35:51] because you are pressing the Perfection
[1:35:53] you are present the charity you are
[1:35:55] present the love
[1:35:56] [Applause]
[1:36:16] [Music]
[1:36:20] story don't be seated
[1:36:24] so hear this prophecy
[1:36:26] of what
[1:36:28] will be among the true church
[1:36:32] but the true church all over the world
[1:36:34] has shaped down to a place
[1:36:37] that they come a Ministry among them
[1:36:40] just
[1:36:41] exactly like the ministry of Jesus
[1:36:44] Christ
[1:36:45] no ministers fight me when I preach
[1:36:47] about days of fight for Ministry yet
[1:36:50] because everybody figured because any
[1:36:51] people put this fight from the street
[1:36:52] that's not true
[1:36:53] the fifo ministry is adopted songs
[1:36:56] I have my Ministry in Baltimore
[1:36:58] but Christ is a person
[1:37:03] Christ has his own Ministry
[1:37:05] if Christ stepped into this Tabernacle
[1:37:07] he will manifest his ministry
[1:37:11] that's what happened
[1:37:13] he said I represent defeat
[1:37:20] yeah he was representing the faith until
[1:37:22] the faith came into him which was the
[1:37:25] angel of God
[1:37:26] so the prophecy is the pillar far is to
[1:37:29] be veiled in the adopted Sons
[1:37:31] don't think that's an impossible and
[1:37:32] we've got Peter had it you know he was
[1:37:34] because but fisherman Peter you know he
[1:37:36] was denying man Peter I don't know that
[1:37:38] man you know but the pillar fire was
[1:37:40] veiled in Peter
[1:37:43] so when anas and pharah come lying in
[1:37:45] the church they told us another man
[1:37:47] standing there I hear him for so much
[1:37:48] time I listen to him I hear him already
[1:37:51] I know him
[1:37:52] Peter said you enlighten me you lie to
[1:37:54] the Holy Ghost I'm not in charge of this
[1:37:56] thing here no judgment strike he said go
[1:37:59] happen again because people watching
[1:38:01] with their eyes and with their flesh and
[1:38:02] with their senses instead of watching
[1:38:04] what God promised
[1:38:05] [Applause]
[1:38:07] [Music]
[1:38:08] like if somebody watching Jesus and say
[1:38:10] well Jesus never stuck on Instagram
[1:38:14] Jesus never even Shake
[1:38:18] Supreme anointing
[1:38:19] power and control
[1:38:22] but what did Isaiah say
[1:38:24] Isaiah system her lips I never hear
[1:38:27] Jesus stammer you what Jesus underwater
[1:38:29] prophecy
[1:38:31] you are Jesus keep watching Jesus
[1:38:33] you are the what is your prophec
[1:38:36] Y and your prophecy says stagger your
[1:38:38] promises said baptism
[1:38:41] approaching God's Throne that way you
[1:38:43] have something called it burners which
[1:38:45] is seraphims
[1:38:46] that have fire and calls when Isaiah
[1:38:49] said war is me I'm undone I'm a man of
[1:38:51] unclean lips then the angel came at
[1:38:53] coals above the altar touch his tongue
[1:38:56] he said no that iniquity is purged
[1:38:59] a man speaking for God any unclean but
[1:39:01] God Purge him with what with fire
[1:39:04] with Mysteries fire with a nice message

[1:42:26] church in the glory at the Rapture
[1:42:28] caused it and did
[1:42:30] the Gentile dispensation
[1:42:33] God ended it up the coming of that stone
[1:42:38] so The Headstone closes off
[1:42:41] the Gentile
[1:42:42] dispensation
[1:42:44] now when the Rain Begin to Fall
[1:42:46] Noah was already sealed into the ark
[1:42:49] anybody feeling inspired now to to
[1:42:52] believe Noah's message to get in they
[1:42:54] couldn't go in
[1:42:55] because what God God shuts is shot and
[1:42:59] the Bible said God shut that door so no
[1:43:01] one couldn't put his hand and open that
[1:43:03] door for nobody
[1:43:04] I am your cousin
[1:43:07] he had a hundred and twenty years to be
[1:43:09] cousin

[1:43:21] children feeling you know somebody texts

[1:43:45] because that next two hours
[1:43:50] and every rain coming next week as me as

[1:43:56] oh yeah
[1:44:00] shut up son it's gonna rain two days
[1:44:03] pass through this part what God doing
[1:44:04] preaching to people that cannot be saved
[1:44:10] nothing you could do about that
[1:44:12] and the prophecy is they're going to be
[1:44:14] a preaching to Eternal loss
[1:44:16] people will be seen on the internet
[1:44:17] seeing signs one does Miracles or
[1:44:19] pouring fire falling and they can't do
[1:44:22] nothing about it
[1:44:23] finish
[1:44:27] the stone
[1:44:29] the builders refused
[1:44:31] don't understand
[1:44:40] let's go
[1:44:42] so Jesus was God's Corner wheat to have
[1:44:45] been recently dead
[1:44:47] and he was the first fruits of them that
[1:44:49] slept
[1:44:50] and he was a Sheaf
[1:44:52] no when in the Bible time when you have
[1:44:54] your corn crop on you you get the corn
[1:44:55] coming to maturity you get the first one
[1:44:57] come to maturity first firm aircon this
[1:45:00] is a common with it before the Lord
[1:45:03] that was a weave chief and what that
[1:45:05] tells you others coming you know
[1:45:07] they're the first one to come to
[1:45:08] maturity so there's a sign we're getting
[1:45:10] a crop here it is
[1:45:13] God is good
[1:45:14] oh God be so in tears we're written now
[1:45:18] we're so in tears we venture the months
[1:45:20] mole and corn spray and corn and what no
[1:45:23] no we have a harvest now this is only
[1:45:25] the first one you have 10 acres with
[1:45:28] corn this is the first one come to
[1:45:30] maturity well Christ was the first fruit
[1:45:33] of them that set
[1:45:36] all them things were going on they're
[1:45:38] not dead they're only sleeping but
[1:45:41] Christ rose from the dead as the first
[1:45:43] fruit of them that step
[1:45:47] I can hear Brother nice praising God I
[1:45:50] can hear all them things were going on
[1:45:51] before saying hallelujah oh glory to God
[1:45:55] the church has come to cut the
[1:45:57] Perfection to bring on the resurrection
[1:46:00] and every Devon held don't want you to
[1:46:03] see Perfection Oh Glory to God
[1:46:05] hallelujah hallelujah you may be seated
[1:46:08] remember Abraham has Faith remember
[1:46:10] Isaac is love remember Jacob is Grace
[1:46:13] but Joseph
[1:46:15] that's Perfection nothing against him
[1:46:17] nothing against you nothing against him
[1:46:20] nothing against you you are the bride or

[1:47:14] so the first one that comes to maturity
[1:47:17] had to be waved as a memorial on
[1:47:20] Thanksgiving to God oh praise God and
[1:47:23] what's something he was the first person
[1:47:25] that slept he was wave over the promised
[1:47:28] seed I had the promise of life he was
[1:47:31] waved on the day of Pentecost and where
[1:47:33] there came a song from heaven like a
[1:47:35] waving Mighty Russian wind and wave over
[1:47:38] the people amen waiting for the blessing
[1:47:40] to come and is to be waved again
[1:47:43] again according to Luke 17 30 the son of

[1:48:24] the Lord a shout in the house Oh Glory
[1:48:27] to God this waving of the Holy Ghost
[1:48:30] oh Hallelujah Glory
[1:48:34] let's continue here now who is the son
[1:48:36] of man in the beginning was the word the
[1:48:39] wizard with God and the Word was made
[1:48:41] flesh and dwelling Among Us Now Luke 17
[1:48:43] verse different scriptures that word
[1:48:48] again is wave over the people what has
[1:48:51] been wave over that the dead tradition
[1:48:54] of man is dead and the Son of God is
[1:48:57] alive with the baptism of the Holy
[1:48:59] Spirit right Among Us
[1:49:01] but at only we have to have this right
[1:49:07] we don't need no money we need a baptism
[1:49:10] of the Holy Ghost right
[1:49:12] among us if nobody in the message wanted
[1:49:15] we wanted
[1:49:17] this is the oil
[1:49:19] I don't want to be no foolish version
[1:49:21] I want to have oil and extra too
[1:49:23] that's why I shouting the way I shouting
[1:49:25] that's why I praise and a way of prison
[1:49:27] I want a little more give me all in my
[1:49:29] lamb to keep me burning Oh Glory to God
[1:49:32] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Glory
[1:49:36] love God
[1:49:40] what
[1:49:42] we even have a Sheaf what was the Sheaf
[1:49:44] the first one that come to mature that
[1:49:47] prude was a wheat that prove it was a
[1:49:50] Sheaf he said I'm sure you know what I'm
[1:49:51] talking about it was way over the people
[1:49:53] and for the first time they will come
[1:49:56] forth prophecy for the bright age
[1:49:59] not loudicia
[1:50:03] he at least prophesied it
[1:50:05] first time for the bright age
[1:50:07] there will be a message
[1:50:09] you want to hear my messages the message
[1:50:11] will be the full maturity of the word
[1:50:15] has turned back again in its full power
[1:50:19] being wave over the People by the same
[1:50:23] signs and wonders that he picked up
[1:50:26] that's the prophecy
[1:50:28] the maturity of the word
[1:50:30] so we find out Faith could grow
[1:50:32] Faith could ripen
[1:50:34] fake and mature
[1:50:36] feet are different stages
[1:50:38] the different qualities of Faith they
[1:50:41] find measures of Faith so God wants to
[1:50:43] get the measure that will take us right
[1:50:44] up that we could even enter into Rapture
[1:50:46] and Faith because he say it will take
[1:50:48] more faith than ever to leave this world
[1:50:50] because you have to believe your mortal
[1:50:52] going to change your flesh going to
[1:50:54] change so that's not normal thing that's
[1:50:56] that's super stuff that's why he said
[1:50:58] Divine Healing he said we have to have
[1:50:59] that because how we can believe we can
[1:51:02] be changed now we can't have Faithfully
[1:51:03] Divine Healing
[1:51:05] a little thing oh praise God understand
[1:51:08] this Peter never did that before you
[1:51:10] know Silver and Gold Have I None such as
[1:51:12] I have I give
[1:51:13] even if the man didn't want the work he
[1:51:14] was giving him
[1:51:16] um do you want me to be healed do you
[1:51:18] ask me if you want to be healed no he
[1:51:19] said I come to I have something I want
[1:51:20] to give it to you
[1:51:22] I have it I could give it I own it I
[1:51:25] could give it it's a part of me I can
[1:51:27] handle it come on preach back to me
[1:51:29] somebody do you see the difference
[1:51:33] a blind man come to Jesus and Jesus God
[1:51:36] asked him what do you want me to do for
[1:51:37] you
[1:51:38] now you would say why would Jesus ask
[1:51:41] that he could see the man dying but yeah
[1:51:44] surely man want to see
[1:51:48] suppose he might want to bring the
[1:51:49] lottery
[1:51:54] supposedly desires he wants you to
[1:51:56] express what is upon your heart
[1:51:58] what it is you want me to do for you
[1:52:01] Lord that I might receive my sight and
[1:52:05] God give him a sight
[1:52:06] oh God what if God come on this morning
[1:52:08] to ask what do you want me
[1:52:10] to do
[1:52:12] for you that is today
[1:52:14] [Applause]
[1:52:16] come on give the Lord some Praises they
[1:52:18] didn't expect that one did you
[1:52:20] didn't expect that one did you
[1:52:22] hallelujah what do you want God to do
[1:52:24] for you today
[1:52:25] [Music]
[1:52:34] so what if we have a Car steering wheel
[1:52:36] in the completed diamond studs all over
[1:52:39] it engine was mechanically tested to be
[1:52:41] exactly right engine Wheels bearings
[1:52:43] greased up tires puncture proof blood
[1:52:46] free Sandy face to be tested pushed off
[1:52:49] assembly line both of them filled with
[1:52:51] gasoline that's running powered gasoline
[1:52:54] high octane but
[1:52:56] don't have any Spark
[1:52:59] no firing power
[1:53:01] taking pictures supported Instagram with
[1:53:03] your fancy girl move my Red Bicycle
[1:53:06] tricycle no driving past you
[1:53:09] the toddler with a tricycle passenger
[1:53:12] your shame
[1:53:14] yeah
[1:53:15] it can't move
[1:53:17] no battery no power
[1:53:19] but better you're shining
[1:53:22] I polish them with this mystery and he
[1:53:24] hitting them and destroying this side
[1:53:25] here and you put oh God the people say I
[1:53:27] never see it so I never see that shine
[1:53:29] my food
[1:53:32] moving
[1:53:36] just mechanics
[1:53:42] is that I don't care how much how much
[1:53:44] power is in the gasoline unless it has
[1:53:46] spark the Manifest that power
[1:53:48] there's a power to confirm that is
[1:53:49] ghastly is my will be water so we assure
[1:53:52] that gasoline
[1:53:53] yeah
[1:53:56] supposedly can
[1:53:58] but it's really water
[1:54:00] but it can Mark gasoline on it
[1:54:04] then the prophet said this no matter how
[1:54:07] much the theologians claim how well
[1:54:09] you've got your truth set how much
[1:54:12] education you got how much you like the
[1:54:14] Bible until the wave Chief until the
[1:54:18] Holy Spirit comes upon that person to
[1:54:21] Quicken that word the gustling the
[1:54:24] gasoline represent the word it's the
[1:54:27] truth but without the spirit it won't
[1:54:28] move
[1:54:30] and this is what I'm gonna get to we
[1:54:32] have put too much stress on the
[1:54:35] mechanics
[1:54:37] and nothing on the dynamic
[1:54:40] so from this service forward
[1:54:43] we want to press
[1:54:44] the dynamic button
[1:54:46] because we have an order here we put too
[1:54:49] much stress on the mechanic and nothing
[1:54:52] on the dynamic it needs the dynamic
[1:54:55] power of God the resurrection power of
[1:54:58] Jesus Christ upon the church the
[1:55:00] Manifest or to bring to pass that this
[1:55:03] is gasoline
[1:55:04] it might be in a gasoline can because it
[1:55:07] will be water
[1:55:08] the only proof of it is to put your life
[1:55:09] on it
[1:55:10] and it prove where genuine or not no no
[1:55:12] no
[1:55:14] but the Brandon says
[1:55:19] there's a far greater gift here
[1:55:22] would be the best what gift is the best
[1:55:24] the gift of the Holy Ghost of wisdom
[1:55:26] to put the word together
[1:55:28] to show the church where we are standing
[1:55:31] when you see this quote this word
[1:55:34] greatest gift to put the word together
[1:55:36] but in this season these are all the
[1:55:37] time in court
[1:55:39] because we have 40 plus years
[1:55:42] to put things together
[1:55:44] so if I come and talk about you know
[1:55:45] sayings you know what I mean
[1:55:47] to put the word together
[1:55:49] yeah wisdom to put the word together so
[1:55:52] we're doing last 40 years
[1:55:54] was
[1:55:56] putting on them ready to send bigger
[1:55:58] missiles and bigger bombs earthquakes
[1:56:01] what kind of issue America crumbling
[1:56:03] daily
[1:56:08] they were president like a Walking Dead
[1:56:13] America go on you know they already
[1:56:16] they're waiting for the sentence
[1:56:18] is this judgment hanging over America
[1:56:20] it's getting worse and worse and worse
[1:56:24] right
[1:56:26] the bright copy getting worse
[1:56:28] we have to be getting like Abraham
[1:56:30] strong and fate give him praise and
[1:56:33] glory to God
[1:56:36] watch
[1:56:37] notice the life that was in the husk in
[1:56:41] the stalk in the tussle or goddess of in
[1:56:44] the seed
[1:56:45] the light that was in the stalk one went
[1:56:48] to make the other justification made our
[1:56:50] way personification some vacation made a
[1:56:52] way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:56:54] and the baptism of the Holy Ghost made a
[1:56:57] way for the Holy Ghost itself
[1:57:00] to come right down in Perfection and
[1:57:03] back to the wood again to manifest
[1:57:06] itself
[1:57:07] so the history of the seven Church ages
[1:57:09] is the history of the life of the plant
[1:57:12] a seed goes on into the ground
[1:57:14] the church started out it fell into the
[1:57:17] ground and up come Luther Wesley
[1:57:19] Pentecost God is going to bring it back
[1:57:21] to seed
[1:57:22] when the Holy Ghost came it brought the
[1:57:24] atmosphere for the sea to come in the
[1:57:27] Pentecostals who broke into the Holy
[1:57:30] Ghost age they rejected this message
[1:57:32] therefore they rejected the seed to
[1:57:35] bring them to adoption to make them
[1:57:38] please Sons so God had to leave the
[1:57:40] Pentecostals to come to you
[1:57:43] to find you wherever you are you have to
[1:57:46] find you to make the headstone or give
[1:57:50] the Lord I shout that he could come into
[1:57:51] it so you have to find you to make up
[1:57:55] this bright body
[1:57:56] in this last day that the spirit could
[1:57:59] come in
[1:58:00] oh give the Lord some Praises hallelujah
[1:58:04] hallelujah glory to God

[1:58:19] their respective places not assembled in
[1:58:21] their places they were cut out
[1:58:23] separately independently and when they
[1:58:26] brought it together Solomon just fitted
[1:58:28] together it was the fitting of the
[1:58:30] stones to fit the building but God
[1:58:32] caught your right I have a place for

[2:00:31] positionally for its resting place for
[2:00:34] that generation and the glory of God
[2:00:36] filled the place where they were sitting
[2:00:39] and there was Shekinah Glory over the
[2:00:41] whole building and the glory was so
[2:00:42] great until the priest couldn't even

[2:17:18] Headstone is the Holy Ghost the Thunder
[2:17:20] says the Holy Ghost the Thunder's in two
[2:17:22] parts revelation
[2:17:24] a manifestation he said what we see
[2:17:26] should make a church and to make a
[2:17:28] Revival that people fly from everywhere
[2:17:30] say the seven Thunders is being
[2:17:32] manifested oh my hallelujah oh glory to
[2:17:36] God what's the purpose of the Holy Ghost
[2:17:38] form to get
[2:17:43] and he revealed it as the shout
[2:17:45] when the bride Catch The Headstone I
[2:17:48] wonder if it's going to be the voice
[2:17:50] the voice of the Archangel because you
[2:17:52] protect Perfection to bring on the
[2:17:54] forces of Resurrection and Jesus does
[2:17:56] all three he does the shout he does the
[2:17:59] voice he does the Trump
[2:18:00] he did the show to William Branham
[2:18:03] is he going to do the Force Through The
[2:18:04] Bride because the spirit and the bride
[2:18:06] will have a voice
[2:18:08] this bridge in the Bible say come
[2:18:10] the bride will be representing Jesus
[2:18:12] Christ children Mrs Jesus Christ on the
[2:18:13] Earth the work that he didn't finish the
[2:18:15] Bible finish Shield their continuation
[2:18:17] of the works of Christ Oh Glory to God
[2:18:20] hallelujah I'm closing get a spot
[2:18:25] question and answers
[2:18:27] if the church is saved even though she
[2:18:29] does not go into the Rapture I believe
[2:18:31] you're taught she must go through the
[2:18:33] tribulation for purifying but what about
[2:18:35] those that are dead how will they be
[2:18:38] purified question
[2:18:40] here the answer
[2:18:42] the bride don't need no purification
[2:18:46] she's already purified
[2:18:48] and the dead back there they never
[2:18:50] receive the light that these Church up
[2:18:53] here have received they live under
[2:18:55] justification sanifications over like
[2:18:57] that they lifted the light that they had
[2:18:58] maybe no way they suffered whatever they
[2:19:00] went through with the position but now
[2:19:03] talk about us a lot of more Baptist
[2:19:05] method you don't want people in the
[2:19:06] message now talk about us but now in the
[2:19:10] Rapture in time like this
[2:19:12] there will come a time
[2:19:15] that the bride talking about the church
[2:19:18] that rejects the head part of the Bride
[2:19:20] will have to suffer for her rejection
[2:19:23] so he's saying the church in this
[2:19:25] message that rejected part of the Bible
[2:19:27] which is the headstone
[2:19:28] we'll have to suffer for that
[2:19:31] symptoms to the three and a half years
[2:19:33] tribulation
[2:19:34] because the gospel wasn't made plain to
[2:19:36] them bacteria I just made plain to you
[2:19:39] today
[2:19:39] you have it so plain you have all these
[2:19:42] years an example the series open the
[2:19:44] churches laid up plain and so plain you
[2:19:46] can't miss it if you fully reject it
[2:19:49] there's only one thing to do suffer for
[2:19:51] it
[2:19:53] I'm almost done
[2:19:54] you say what what he did
[2:19:56] he call out the elect to make up the
[2:19:57] lutherans he called it like ruled around
[2:20:00] the make of the wesleyans he could
[2:20:01] already let the make of the Pentecostals
[2:20:03] and now he's calling the elect
[2:20:05] Pentecostals to make the headstone
[2:20:10] to come into it
[2:20:12] you see what you're talking about now
[2:20:14] you dare without us
[2:20:16] and not made perfect
[2:20:18] so The Headstone brings on the
[2:20:19] completion of that Perfection so God
[2:20:23] calling you to make up this shape this
[2:20:25] Capstone that the spirit could come into
[2:20:27] it to raise up all them some Adam come
[2:20:30] right up oh there's gonna be a
[2:20:32] resurrection
[2:20:34] do you believe that
[2:20:35] final quote and I'm done
[2:20:47] I want you to notice he never said he
[2:20:49] should have been for the Cornerstone he
[2:20:51] shall bring for The Headstone we know
[2:20:53] the scripture says that Jesus Christ is
[2:20:55] the Chief Cornerstone he also is a
[2:20:58] headstone now everything for a few
[2:21:00] minutes that the seventh Church each
[2:21:02] messenger was to restore the faith of
[2:21:05] the children back to the fathers then he
[2:21:08] said in other words
[2:21:09] rebuild the church again
[2:21:12] under the power of the spirit not by
[2:21:14] power not by might not by but by my
[2:21:18] spirits here the Lord not my
[2:21:19] organization not by denomination but by
[2:21:22] the holy spirit will God bring for the
[2:21:23] church in the last days and I'm done
[2:21:25] listen to this carefully
[2:21:27] we have built churches
[2:21:28] groups
[2:21:30] fellowships
[2:21:31] by the word
[2:21:33] by mechanics but this is what we last
[2:21:35] hear already
[2:21:37] is a prophecy
[2:21:38] that the church will be rebuilt
[2:21:41] by the spirit
[2:21:42] it will take Dynamics to do that
[2:21:45] it will take the power to do that to
[2:21:47] rebuild the church again and he said
[2:21:49] when Revival hit the sisters came wash
[2:21:52] the dishes it's an atmosphere this place
[2:21:55] was so charged you could see is
[2:21:57] something moving

[2:57:05] always use an extra and an extra support
[2:57:08] we all use the Tabernacle and all of the
[2:57:12] resources so to the extent that you can
[2:57:14] Avail yourselves will be appreciated
[2:57:15] feel free to speak to brother Stephen

[2:57:19] or mention it to one of the deacons and
[2:57:21] they can direct you

[2:57:25] announcement is with regards to our
[2:57:27] upcoming convention in July we under
[2:57:30] great expectation and we would have had
[2:57:32] our head trustee speak with us last week
[2:57:34] so just to remind you as well that we
[2:57:37] are soliciting your support for a
[2:57:39] wonderful time in the Lord in July and
[2:57:42] as we would have indicated sister
[2:57:44] Bernadette will be managing the pledges
[2:57:47] and the commitments for the convention
[2:57:48] and we are encouraging your support
[2:57:51] we have just about six months if we
[2:57:55] count July month as well this is the end
[2:57:57] of February beginning of March so we can
[2:58:00] encourage you to want to pledge but if
[2:58:02] you can make it a consistent commitment
[2:58:04] so that the trustees have visibility
[2:58:06] with what what we can do and when we can
[2:58:08] do it we have the end of February March
[2:58:10] April May June and even as far as the
[2:58:14] end of July if you could let sister
[2:58:15] internet know so that the trustees could
[2:58:17] be cognizant of what is possible that
[2:58:20] God could do something tremendous for us
[2:58:22] so we encourage you in whatever way you
[2:58:24] can if you can do more do more but
[2:58:26] whatever you can do you do it all to the
[2:58:28] Lord and as you can see around you you
[2:58:30] see what happens with the resources here
[2:58:33] as we strive for the kingdom we're
[2:58:34] looking for a wonderful time in the lawn
[2:58:36] both with our Believers locally as well
[2:58:39] as abroad and certainly the ministers
[2:58:41] that will be coming here to be a part of
[2:58:43] this great move of God so continue most
[2:58:46] importantly as well to be in prayer
[2:58:49] prayer for the convention in prayer for
[2:58:51] the church and prayer for the ministry

[2:58:57] bear you're passed up in prayer because
