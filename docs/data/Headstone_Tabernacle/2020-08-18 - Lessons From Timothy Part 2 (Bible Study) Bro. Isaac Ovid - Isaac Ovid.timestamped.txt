[5:28] god bless you church such a great
[5:30] privilege
[5:31] to be gathered once again can we just
[5:33] bow our heads
[5:35] for a word of prayer tonight uh gracious
[5:38] heavenly father we thank you tonight
[5:40] lord to
[5:41] be able to gather in this way in this
[5:44] time
[5:45] lord and to see how lord you would allow
[5:48] us to be able to
[5:50] do things in in in in in such a way that
[5:53] we could still be drawn closer to you
[5:55] lord in our daily walk or daily talk
[5:58] father we
[5:59] could still lord make it a priority lord
[6:02] to put you first in our lives and we
[6:04] could
[6:04] go beyond our feelings we could go
[6:06] beyond our emotions we could go beyond
[6:09] lord the physical challenges that we may
[6:11] have lord and
[6:13] lord there's so many needs so many
[6:14] situations lord among your
[6:16] body of believers lord within this local
[6:18] church we thank you for
[6:20] lord calling us for such a time as this
[6:23] lord we
[6:24] lord we are so appreciative and so
[6:25] grateful that you
[6:27] lifted the scales from our eyes that we
[6:29] could see you
[6:30] lord both in the scripture lord and more
[6:33] than that to see you in the reveal word
[6:35] that brought
[6:36] lord a further revelation and shine more
[6:38] light on the scriptures that we could be
[6:40] walking in the light tonight so father
[6:42] lord as we approach this little study
[6:45] tonight
[6:46] lord it's not a preaching service it's a
[6:48] conversation lord i like to type into
[6:50] the cool of the evening
[6:51] lord when he would come down for
[6:52] fellowship so too we have gathered
[6:54] tonight just to have fellowship around
[6:56] your word
[6:57] lord to encourage one another to law to
[7:00] say
[7:00] something that could motivate us to push
[7:02] us to
[7:03] push us to a new limit to push us lord
[7:06] pass
[7:06] lord a sound barrier the prophet would
[7:08] say lord it's so easy to get stuck
[7:11] in a routine it's so easy to get stuck
[7:14] in a comfort zone with the things that
[7:16] we are used to do and the way we used to
[7:18] do things and
[7:19] lord to see how lord natural man has
[7:22] discovered that
[7:24] to create a new habit lord it takes a
[7:26] certain amount of time for a new habit
[7:28] to be formed
[7:29] lord and we want to be in the habit of
[7:31] the word a habit of prayer
[7:33] a habit of consecration a habit of lord
[7:36] trying to find lord who you are lord
[7:38] a deeper understanding of who you are
[7:40] lord and lord so that we can be so
[7:42] grounded in the present truth so father
[7:45] tonight may you
[7:46] lord break the scales from our eyes and
[7:48] lord may you help us
[7:49] lord help us in our homes help us to how
[7:52] we deal with our jobs and
[7:53] a lot of workplaces and and and the
[7:55] school situations or the home situations
[7:58] or
[7:58] whatever the challenge might be father
[8:00] lord we are not in a new season the
[8:02] whole world is trying to figure things
[8:04] out
[8:04] lord but we thank god that lord you have
[8:07] already figured things out and
[8:09] lord the pathway to glory has already
[8:11] been defined
[8:12] lord the highway to heaven is already
[8:14] defined so we
[8:15] thank you for your grace lord i pray you
[8:17] bless all those that are
[8:19] in this room tonight those that would
[8:21] join us along the way as it were
[8:23] lord may you bless those for whatever
[8:25] reason couldn't be here tonight lord and
[8:27] lord may you reveal yourself to us lord
[8:29] me lord i want to cast down my thoughts
[8:32] cast all my understanding and
[8:34] lord surrender to you father so may you
[8:36] speak to us tonight if there's anyone
[8:38] who
[8:38] needs healing tonight lord lord let your
[8:41] people be confident that healing is
[8:43] still available
[8:44] and healing can happen in this service
[8:46] lord and father if there's anyone who
[8:47] may be depressed feeling down feeling
[8:49] overwhelmed
[8:50] lord as a as this little study
[8:52] progresses may you lift that off of your
[8:54] people that we can leave this
[8:56] lord study tonight feeling confident
[8:58] feeling persuaded feeling
[8:59] a bit lighter knowing that the cares of
[9:01] this world are being dropped off from us
[9:03] so
[9:03] father we commit the service into your
[9:05] hands we commit the the study into your
[9:07] hands in the precious name of jesus
[9:08] christ amen
[9:10] and amen and amen it's certainly a great
[9:12] privilege uh to be here once again
[9:15] on this tuesday this bible study this
[9:17] time where
[9:18] we come together and just have a
[9:20] conversation about jesus
[9:22] and his word and how he has hidden
[9:24] himself in the world
[9:26] and how he wants to be made known and we
[9:28] thank god for
[9:29] the ministry of the prophet malachi 4
[9:33] that he would come to shine light on the
[9:35] scriptures
[9:36] that the book to us is not a closed book
[9:39] it's an
[9:39] open book so we can go anywhere in the
[9:42] scripture
[9:43] and uh make more sense to it because the
[9:46] ministry of that elijah that prophet was
[9:49] the tire of all the loose ends
[9:51] and you know but over has been speaking
[9:52] about the dangers
[9:54] of loose ends of when things are not
[9:56] tied up when things are not closed up
[9:58] when things
[9:59] are not in their place it creates room
[10:02] for the enemy to operate
[10:04] so we are being challenged we are being
[10:06] encouraged to
[10:07] close the doors to close the windows to
[10:10] tie up the loose ends to
[10:11] make no room for the enemy to move you
[10:14] know so
[10:15] you know and but the branham would type
[10:17] this as sealed in and
[10:18] sealed out so sealed in and the enemy is
[10:21] sealed
[10:21] out you know and and moving along that
[10:23] that carriage we as it were
[10:25] that box cow when the inspector puts a
[10:27] seal of approval
[10:28] it sealed all the way until your
[10:31] redemption
[10:32] so we thank god tonight um for his love
[10:35] for his mercy
[10:36] anybody thank god for life this evening
[10:38] for being in the land of the living i
[10:40] know i do
[10:41] thank god that you have the strength to
[10:43] even be in this service tonight
[10:45] there's so many people you know i was i
[10:47] was hearing
[10:50] i guess a speech coming out of the u.s
[10:53] you know the u.s is also heading into
[10:54] elections so
[10:56] they have all these things and and you
[10:58] know sometimes it's
[11:00] when you sometimes it's not just what is
[11:03] said it's how it is said that brings
[11:04] it in focus you know so uh somebody was
[11:07] speaking and
[11:08] they were talking about this corona
[11:09] virus and i don't want to just
[11:11] you know you know use it as a talking
[11:14] point
[11:14] but was making a statement that every 80
[11:18] seconds
[11:18] in the united states someone dies from
[11:20] the coronavirus
[11:23] and it's one thing to hear about that
[11:25] counts and this is happening but when it
[11:26] is said like that
[11:27] and you can look at the the the
[11:29] statistics
[11:31] it is true but it puts a whole different
[11:33] perspective that every 80 seconds
[11:36] somebody is dying from the coronavirus
[11:40] you know and this this time this this
[11:43] clock of time that is ticking that does
[11:46] not stop ticking
[11:47] you know by the time it is sad but by
[11:50] the time the service is over
[11:52] it is unfortunate that more people would
[11:54] have gone on
[11:55] because of this and and that is one
[11:57] situation because that is what is
[11:59] in the mainstream media right now but as
[12:02] time
[12:02] ticks things are unfolding things are
[12:05] changing
[12:06] there are forces that are moving forces
[12:08] in the spiritual realm forces in the
[12:09] ecclesiastical realm forces in the
[12:12] financial realm in our own country
[12:14] within 24 hours
[12:15] a new government is in place there's so
[12:17] much that
[12:18] that that that is moving there's so much
[12:20] that is happening and
[12:22] brother branham would make the reference
[12:24] that when he looked at the natural he
[12:26] looked at the
[12:27] the horse and buggy he looked at the car
[12:29] he looked at the airplane he looked at
[12:31] the astronaut and and he saw the
[12:33] progress of man
[12:34] in his natural if i want to use the word
[12:36] evolution of progress of achievements
[12:39] and he looked at the church and said but
[12:41] wait a minute if the
[12:42] world is moving at this peace what about
[12:44] the church what about the bride
[12:46] in advancing what should be advanced in
[12:49] a deeper understanding
[12:51] uh where we activate he would he would
[12:53] bring that and
[12:54] and and it challenges us that every day
[12:57] we should be making progress
[12:59] every single day we should be making
[13:02] progress
[13:03] you know and one of the reasons i love
[13:05] these sessions so much because
[13:06] it's not it's not us preaching a pulpit
[13:09] it's a conversation
[13:10] you know so um you know i
[13:13] i'm not being held to a rubric or a
[13:16] standard from anywhere else
[13:17] we are sovereign so we want to have a
[13:19] conversation because
[13:21] god expects the best from us you know
[13:24] and
[13:24] and uh many people you know they're very
[13:27] light about what god's expectation
[13:29] is you know when you look at how genesis
[13:32] was structured when you looked at
[13:34] the approach that god took to lay out
[13:36] everything when you looked at how
[13:37] specific he is and specific he was when
[13:41] he talked about
[13:42] how he wanted noah to build the act it
[13:43] wasn't billaboutner
[13:45] it wasn't a dua king he was very very
[13:47] specific
[13:48] because he is a very specific god you
[13:51] know he has
[13:52] very specific expectations of us you
[13:54] know when he called gideon it was for a
[13:56] specific thing when he
[13:57] called moses it wasn't moses i have a
[13:59] job for you no
[14:00] moses was given a job description every
[14:04] individual that god put his hands on
[14:07] it was not an arbitrary thing it he was
[14:10] putting his hands on them to do a
[14:12] specific thing
[14:13] so even when brother branham was on the
[14:15] it's it was to do a specific thing
[14:18] this elijah this messenger
[14:21] this prophet was to do certain things
[14:25] and the reality is if god put
[14:27] individuals
[14:29] in place to do certain things and we
[14:31] have seen it
[14:32] through scripture it is impossible for
[14:35] that thing to not be to be accomplished
[14:37] i want to say that one more time if god
[14:39] puts his hands on somebody to do a
[14:41] specific thing
[14:42] it is impossible for that thing
[14:45] not to happen and a classic example is
[14:48] jonah
[14:49] as much as jonah was running away from
[14:52] his purpose
[14:53] is as much as he was running to his
[14:55] purpose all right so you're familiar
[14:57] with it but as much as jonah
[14:58] was running away from his purpose is as
[15:01] much as jonah was running
[15:03] to his pooper so i want to encourage the
[15:06] young people i want to encourage the
[15:08] parents i want to encourage
[15:09] uh the church i want to encourage those
[15:12] that are
[15:12] that are dealing with different
[15:14] challenges i don't want to use the word
[15:15] just struggling but dealing with
[15:17] challenges
[15:18] because challenges are a part of life
[15:20] and you have to deal with it
[15:22] you know you could try to ignore it you
[15:24] could brush it aside for a season
[15:26] but until the challenge is dealt with it
[15:28] remains a challenge
[15:29] and one thing i've learned you know in
[15:32] the short years i'm on this it
[15:34] is it is not that life just gets easier
[15:37] there's no such thing as life getting
[15:38] easier but it is as our
[15:41] as our maturing in the world and in our
[15:43] experiences
[15:44] we can begin to get more developed we
[15:47] begin to process things a little
[15:49] different
[15:50] we begin to look at things a little
[15:52] different things that used to bother us
[15:54] five years ago cannot be affecting us
[15:57] the same way
[15:57] as it is now if that is happening then
[16:00] we are we are missing the mark somewhere
[16:03] because all through scripture it's about
[16:05] adding
[16:06] it's about maturing it's about ripening
[16:08] it's about progress
[16:09] it's about doing things to be able to
[16:12] handle
[16:13] more responsibility you know i was
[16:16] sharing with my wife today in looking at
[16:18] the situation i see that person avoids
[16:20] responsibility and you see
[16:23] responsibility is a big word because
[16:25] we are still in the book of timothy and
[16:27] timothy is a big book
[16:28] that deals with responsibility because
[16:31] as we would have discussed
[16:32] paul is getting ready to leave and he's
[16:35] placing
[16:35] increased responsibilities on timothy as
[16:38] he is preparing to leave the scene
[16:40] and the reality is when jesus walked
[16:43] on the earth and he was preparing to
[16:45] leave as he is leaving
[16:47] he is assigning responsibility you know
[16:51] and he cannot give responsibility to
[16:52] somebody who is not responsible
[16:54] or we we speak about it in spiritual
[16:57] terms adoption
[16:58] you know about my father's business his
[17:00] signature of the son is as good as the
[17:02] father
[17:03] but it comes down to being able to
[17:06] handle
[17:07] responsibilities there are
[17:08] responsibilities that we have to deal
[17:10] with
[17:10] as men their responsibilities we have to
[17:12] deal with as
[17:13] women their responsibility as fathers
[17:16] their responsibilities
[17:17] as sons their responsibility on your job
[17:19] there's responsibility in your
[17:21] neighborhood
[17:22] you cannot get away from
[17:24] responsibilities
[17:26] and as much as the natural has field
[17:30] in bringing a deep appreciation of
[17:33] responsibilities
[17:34] it's it's so much more that we as
[17:36] believers supposed to be
[17:38] exemplaries or examples of what it is to
[17:41] be
[17:41] responsible discipline and
[17:44] responsibility
[17:45] go hand in hand i don't know why i'm
[17:46] saying this it's not part of my notes
[17:48] but i just kind of relaxing i don't know
[17:50] if it'll help somebody i don't know if
[17:52] it'll encourage somebody
[17:53] but discipline and responsibility
[17:56] go hand in hand when they found jesus
[18:00] in the temple after mary and joseph had
[18:03] quite honestly
[18:04] forgotten about him when you look at the
[18:06] context of scripture for about three
[18:08] days
[18:08] plus they had forgotten jesus so caught
[18:11] up in the
[18:12] festivities the celebrations that was
[18:15] only after a while they recognized that
[18:16] jesus wasn't there
[18:17] and when they went back to him he said i
[18:20] have to be about
[18:21] my father's business he understood his
[18:24] responsibilities
[18:26] it is a responsibility to be here
[18:28] tonight it's a responsibility
[18:30] to be committed to the word yes it's
[18:32] discipline but it's also a
[18:33] responsibility because
[18:35] it means god has an expectation of what
[18:37] you do with it
[18:38] you know when we we're familiar with the
[18:40] quote what we see should put our souls
[18:42] into action to make a church to make a
[18:44] revival
[18:45] that we are not coming here tonight as
[18:47] as pentecostals as baptists has met this
[18:50] as
[18:50] message we are coming here as sons and
[18:52] daughters
[18:53] really coming to an appreciation and
[18:55] understanding
[18:56] of our responsibilities of our position
[19:00] position and responsibility when you get
[19:02] a promotion
[19:03] in your job to a new position that new
[19:06] position
[19:07] comes with increased responsibilities
[19:09] when you move within your company
[19:11] that position comes with increase and
[19:14] expectation of discipline
[19:16] you cannot go higher and have less
[19:18] discipline they cannot go higher
[19:20] and have less responsibility anybody
[19:22] with me
[19:23] tonight is this is this helping anybody
[19:25] you know so you hear it a lot in the
[19:27] pentecostal room
[19:28] a new level a higher level we're going
[19:30] and people don't want
[19:32] more responsibility because the
[19:33] behaviors are still operating at the
[19:35] original level
[19:37] all right so it is expected the higher
[19:40] you go
[19:41] because of the position you hold you
[19:43] have to say things a certain way
[19:46] when you hold no position you could talk
[19:48] all you want because nobody places
[19:50] weight
[19:51] on what you say if you have no position
[19:54] but by virtue of your question that is
[19:56] why when people look
[19:57] at the political landscape and they
[19:58] compare leadership
[20:00] because without being political you
[20:02] could address leadership you can look at
[20:04] leadership and we have made a point
[20:05] before during this whole coronavirus
[20:07] thing on a worldwide global scale
[20:10] studies have been done how different
[20:12] countries address the situation
[20:14] and how different styles of leadership
[20:17] and the world is placed
[20:18] lightly because not because you are in a
[20:21] position of leadership makes you a
[20:22] leader
[20:23] the same way not because you're a male
[20:25] it makes you a man or because you have
[20:27] children it makes you a father
[20:29] so people in different positions so
[20:32] looking at it biblically saul was king
[20:35] but in his position as king god saw him
[20:38] as a failure
[20:40] and while he is in office god is saying
[20:42] i found a better man
[20:44] so i want to challenge us that we get
[20:47] out of anything
[20:48] what we put into it and
[20:51] your as your responsibilities increase
[20:55] and as your understanding of your role
[20:57] if i could use the phrase in the economy
[20:59] of god
[21:00] there are many people who are listening
[21:01] this and say well is this is this the
[21:03] message
[21:04] the the message is is a life so there
[21:06] are many people who get so caught up
[21:08] in in the technical aspects over the
[21:11] random quality
[21:11] mechanics of the situation and when it
[21:14] really comes down to
[21:16] dealing with the pressures and struggles
[21:18] of life
[21:19] they feel the examination so i want to
[21:22] encourage
[21:23] us tonight that we are preparing to pass
[21:26] the examination
[21:28] that is what all of these things are for
[21:30] to pass the examination in life
[21:33] so that when people look at you and your
[21:36] past you can see you can't even take
[21:37] credit for it
[21:38] because it was god who took you through
[21:41] it was god who carried you through
[21:43] and that should be an encouragement to
[21:45] us all so i want to encourage
[21:47] every single person in this room tonight
[21:49] young old
[21:50] whether you're working you're not
[21:52] working whether you're between jobs
[21:53] whether you have a business
[21:55] to to lift your head high not because of
[21:57] pride
[21:58] or achievement but lift your head
[22:01] because you're not supposed to be down
[22:03] and depressed and discouraged lift your
[22:05] head above your situation
[22:07] and look up because your redemption
[22:09] draws nigh when you look up
[22:11] so i want to challenge you as a church
[22:13] as a body of believers
[22:15] we have a choice to accept our situation
[22:18] or do something different about it
[22:21] all right i might a little motivational
[22:23] tonight but something when i'm
[22:24] motivating you are motivating myself as
[22:26] well
[22:26] we have a choice to accept our situation
[22:30] or do something about it we talk about
[22:32] the lepers
[22:33] they sat there they say if we stay here
[22:36] we die
[22:37] if we go out we die the equal sign
[22:40] is dead but if we stay here nothing
[22:43] change if we go there at least
[22:44] there's a small possibility that
[22:46] something could work out
[22:48] and but abraham said that was the lowest
[22:50] kind of faith when you rate the scale of
[22:52] feet
[22:52] from 100 that might not be a one you
[22:54] call it dingy feet
[22:56] but he said when those guys begin to
[22:58] move
[22:59] they didn't even understand what they
[23:01] were walking into
[23:02] and they god allowed situation to unfold
[23:05] for them to meet a whole camp of food
[23:06] and blessings that
[23:08] they had to relax and enjoy themselves
[23:09] before they tell anybody else about it
[23:11] so i want to encourage you church smile
[23:14] smile
[23:15] put a smile on your face laugh at your
[23:17] situations laugh at the circumstances
[23:21] somebody will say what what trouble is
[23:23] this smile put a smile on your face
[23:26] look the devil in his face and say
[23:28] you're not taking my joy away
[23:30] because the joy of the lord is his
[23:31] strength every day i look into get your
[23:34] joy every day looking for peace of mind
[23:36] every day you wake up in the morning and
[23:37] say thank god for today
[23:39] yes you don't know how you're going to
[23:40] pay the bill but you thank god for today
[23:42] you don't know how you're in the city
[23:43] but you're going to work out but your
[23:45] thank god anyhow you don't know
[23:47] how the situation will be resolved but
[23:49] it can't go
[23:50] any anyhow when you
[23:53] study i'm gonna get to the scripture in
[23:55] a bit if
[23:56] this is okay with you when you study
[23:58] people who have achieved
[24:01] a lot of it they when they battle any
[24:03] mind
[24:06] i was reading you know somebody i was
[24:09] trying to do something on this this this
[24:10] this coroner arresting her people so
[24:12] thing but i was i was i was i think
[24:15] listen to a video reading about uh
[24:16] survivor and they were saying you know
[24:20] one thing they realize is that
[24:24] when you almost lie down and begin to
[24:27] accept it
[24:28] it's it's almost like he was making his
[24:29] point someone said he various way to
[24:30] just
[24:31] lay down and take it he said he changed
[24:34] his mind and said you know what i don't
[24:36] get them anyhow
[24:38] and and and doctors talk about they talk
[24:40] about the placebo effect
[24:42] they talk about the power of positive
[24:44] thinking and talk about the power of
[24:45] faith
[24:46] and they show through different
[24:47] situations how important it is to have
[24:50] they will call it a positive mind we can
[24:53] call it the right perspective or faith
[24:55] because
[24:55] fate makes you look at the impossible
[24:58] and cd possible
[25:00] it's the same principle faith makes you
[25:02] look
[25:03] at what shouldn't happen and say it
[25:05] could happen
[25:06] they will say it's a positive mindset
[25:08] and and they're being positive
[25:10] but it's principles that they are
[25:11] tapping into how much more we
[25:14] who have been given access to to talk
[25:17] about things like perfect feet
[25:19] or or super feet or or rapturing feet
[25:23] so it underscores i can understand in
[25:26] ages going past though but not this age
[25:28] this is the age
[25:29] where fear is supposed to be squashed
[25:30] under our feet because in this age
[25:32] we're not just talking about divine
[25:34] healing we're talking about rapture
[25:35] so so when the brotherhood say how can
[25:37] we have faith for divine healing
[25:40] if how could your faith would erupt your
[25:42] rather if you can't even have faith for
[25:43] divine healing so
[25:44] that's my little introduction tonight i
[25:47] pray that you're giving the devil a run
[25:49] i pray that you are doing all in your
[25:53] power
[25:54] to bring the devil under your feet this
[25:56] is not something the pastor could do
[25:57] it's not something the assistant pastor
[25:59] could do it's not something
[26:00] the deacon supposed to do you have power
[26:03] you have power and i want you to
[26:06] understand that if you
[26:07] understand who you are understand your
[26:09] responsibility
[26:11] understand what's given to you when god
[26:13] called gideon he didn't give
[26:15] gideon something he was calling out of
[26:17] gideon what was already there
[26:20] can i say that one more time when he
[26:21] said gideon down mighty man of allah he
[26:24] wasn't given he didn't have books of
[26:25] allah
[26:27] he was identifying what he was seeing in
[26:31] gideon
[26:34] so when god called you it is not calling
[26:37] with a plan to give although you will
[26:40] get certain things along the journey
[26:42] he is calling you because his
[26:44] foreknowledge has already identified
[26:47] certain things in you that lets him know
[26:50] that he could work with you
[26:52] i don't know if this is helping anybody
[26:53] tonight because one of the greatest
[26:55] tricks
[26:56] that the devil plays on your on your
[26:58] mind you know
[27:00] so i will share something with you
[27:01] church um
[27:08] so the last two days or so i wasn't
[27:11] feeling 100 percent now
[27:13] so i telling my wife boy
[27:16] i ain't feeling together now gone on my
[27:19] phone
[27:20] i see where the car is laughing and i go
[27:22] on
[27:23] and look up covet symptoms
[27:28] they try to eliminate i say well i i had
[27:32] this i
[27:32] had this i said but i feel a hundred
[27:35] percent too tall enough i
[27:36] feel like i ain't feeling good at all i
[27:38] go on and take a tomorrow eternal
[27:41] and i'm checking my temperature by now
[27:44] i'm
[27:44] i'm becoming an expert because i know
[27:47] the temperature
[27:48] i know the ranges i really think so
[27:51] but what i say for you letting your mind
[27:53] just race so just to show you
[27:55] how how your mind is such a powerful
[27:57] thing
[27:58] so i mentioned i think i mentioned to my
[28:00] dad last night or so
[28:01] my feelings weren't thinking he said
[28:03] something i'm gonna try and say probably
[28:04] just he said get up early sleep get that
[28:06] early sleep
[28:07] now the reality is for days and days and
[28:09] days i push and i'm doing this and doing
[28:11] that so you know when you're just going
[28:12] to go and go in your body just tired
[28:14] so last time i said let me go to sleep
[28:15] early i'm biting awake in this morning i
[28:17] feel so strong i feel so good
[28:20] and i say look how your mind and that is
[28:22] what the enemy uses you know
[28:25] the enemy has only one place to wage war
[28:29] it is in your mind
[28:31] and if the devil can convince you that
[28:33] you're not going to make it
[28:34] every devil can convince you that oh go
[28:37] away wasted time
[28:38] then the battle could be won right there
[28:40] you know
[28:42] but as you begin to go above the
[28:44] situation and you begin to
[28:46] begin to take authority over it and
[28:47] begin to realize who you are
[28:49] and begin to realize that that the devil
[28:52] has his job to do but we have our job to
[28:54] you your whole outlook begins to change
[28:56] this is encouraging anybody and and and
[28:58] people because listen it's so easy
[29:01] you know and it happens in every walk of
[29:03] life
[29:04] work shaking up you wanting i might you
[29:06] want to get fired i might you want to
[29:07] get fired i might
[29:08] and you there and the boss even looking
[29:09] at you
[29:11] but you're allowing your mind to go
[29:12] there if you place your trust
[29:14] on the promise of god not the promise of
[29:16] god for that specific job but the
[29:18] promise of god and he will take you off
[29:19] your needs
[29:20] that if it is allowed because
[29:23] nothing could come nigh job and let's go
[29:25] out allow it
[29:26] so if it is allowed that your
[29:29] job at your pacific location have to be
[29:32] adjusted it will mean that god has
[29:34] something better for you you know
[29:35] can i get a witness in the house anybody
[29:37] anybody in the house tonight
[29:39] all right so let's let's get a little
[29:42] a little study i hope i didn't take up
[29:43] too much of my time i don't tend to be
[29:45] too long tonight
[29:46] uh just to kind of recap from last week
[29:49] before we
[29:49] continue reading where we were at for
[29:52] those who were here just to kind of
[29:53] refresh
[29:54] your memory and for those who may not
[29:56] have been here
[29:58] we were introducing this interesting
[30:01] character
[30:02] in scripture by the name of brother
[30:04] timothy
[30:05] and we placed context on who he was
[30:09] because he was made very how do i say
[30:13] noticeable because of the attention that
[30:15] paul
[30:16] formerly known as saul placed on him we
[30:19] would have talked about how
[30:21] paul who was saul was a pharisee of the
[30:23] pharisees and we know about him
[30:25] an academic a writer we know that peter
[30:27] was an
[30:28] unlearned man we know that that that
[30:31] a lot of the brothers who were around
[30:33] jesus were
[30:34] were simple men but for god to write in
[30:38] new testament and for letters to be
[30:39] written
[30:40] he had to find an academic and he found
[30:42] that in this
[30:43] man who was saul who became paul who was
[30:46] so convicted and so persuaded of what he
[30:49] was
[30:49] that it took an actual encounter with
[30:51] god for him to
[30:53] change his mind and we we talked about
[30:55] that
[30:56] and we talked about paul being a
[30:58] messenger to the first age and out of
[31:00] the
[31:00] seven stars that the bible would
[31:02] reference paul would be the first
[31:04] all the way to william branham all right
[31:06] and we talked about
[31:08] that that that paul would be the gold
[31:10] standard or the benchmark
[31:12] so when you read anything written by
[31:14] paul
[31:15] realize that all of the ages that would
[31:17] follow would
[31:18] reference what paul presented because
[31:21] paul was
[31:22] uniquely positioned to be a connector so
[31:25] to speak
[31:26] between the the the jews and those who
[31:29] were
[31:30] trained under the old law and they want
[31:32] to introduce if i could say the new law
[31:34] that was that connection to the gentiles
[31:36] that if jesus hadn't blinded the jews
[31:39] agendas wouldn't even have a chance but
[31:42] as paul's ministry would expand
[31:45] we would understand and we were trying
[31:46] to come to an understanding last week
[31:48] of all the letters within all the
[31:50] letters that paul wrote
[31:52] that he wrote to the ephesians to
[31:53] colossians the galatians the philemon to
[31:55] timothy
[31:56] the titus the hebrews to the romans so
[31:58] thessalonians the corinthians the
[32:00] philippians
[32:01] the bulk of the new testament we made a
[32:03] reference to the fact that it is very
[32:05] interesting when someone is coming
[32:07] to the end of their ministry or the end
[32:09] of their time because
[32:10] you're very careful with what you say
[32:12] and how you see it and and what seeds
[32:14] you leave
[32:15] because you know you don't have too much
[32:17] time to say too much
[32:18] more so you're very careful with how you
[32:21] position things
[32:22] because you really have no time to waste
[32:24] and we have to see it ourselves that
[32:26] when we come to meetings like these we
[32:28] really don't have time to waste
[32:29] because the landscape is shifting and
[32:31] before you know it this world is
[32:33] finished
[32:34] it sounds as if it's been said for a
[32:35] long time but nobody has ever been in
[32:37] this position
[32:38] to see that blending of time into
[32:41] eternity
[32:42] and we would have mentioned last week
[32:44] that careful research would position
[32:46] that paul's letters to timothy would
[32:49] have been
[32:50] among the last that he would have
[32:51] written in so much
[32:53] that he would have said in second
[32:54] timothy 4 and we'll and we should get to
[32:57] it tonight
[32:57] for i am now ready to be offered at the
[33:00] time of my departure is at hand
[33:02] i have fought a good fight i have
[33:04] finished my course
[33:05] i have kept defeat and we talked about
[33:09] it is interesting that his young protege
[33:12] as it were
[33:13] this timothy was a unique brother to
[33:15] begin with
[33:16] a young man raised by his grandmother
[33:20] raised by his mother his father is a
[33:22] unbeliever
[33:23] his father was a greek and yet still
[33:26] this young man
[33:27] made a decision and we have always
[33:30] preached on this and
[33:31] maybe just encourage you that life is
[33:32] about decisions
[33:34] we've said it over and over it's a
[33:36] decision to save
[33:37] it's a decision to spend your money it's
[33:39] a decision to pray
[33:40] is the decision to not pray is it its
[33:42] decision to wake up early
[33:44] it's a decision to wake up elite it's a
[33:46] decision to watch a movie
[33:47] it's a decision to watch your teeth it's
[33:49] a decision to follow the news
[33:50] it's the decision to it's a choice
[33:53] and i remember as a young man preaching
[33:56] youth services many years ago
[33:58] i was building off of the economic term
[34:02] opportunity cost
[34:03] it's one of the first principles you
[34:04] learn in economics
[34:06] and the principle is if you have five
[34:07] dollars and the five
[34:09] single five dollars allow you to buy one
[34:12] of two things
[34:13] whatever you choose to buy what you
[34:16] rejected
[34:17] economics or economists call the
[34:20] opportunity cost
[34:21] it is that thing you gave up to acquire
[34:24] what you went with
[34:26] and this is a powerful principle because
[34:29] what it means is that when somebody say
[34:31] they didn't have time to pray
[34:33] what they're really saying is something
[34:36] else was more important than praying
[34:39] when somebody said they didn't get time
[34:40] to finish their schoolwork
[34:42] it meant something else took priority
[34:44] over their schoolwork
[34:46] and when you amplify this and make it
[34:50] more in focus when you look at the fact
[34:52] that every single man
[34:53] woman child on this earth has the very
[34:56] same
[34:57] 24 hours some people it are people with
[35:00] 28 hours
[35:01] that do people with with 40 hours in a
[35:03] day everybody has the
[35:05] same exact amount of time
[35:09] and that's a powerful concept because if
[35:12] you see
[35:12] that every single person has the same
[35:15] amount
[35:16] of time available then
[35:19] when you look at the character of a man
[35:22] or the character of a woman
[35:24] or what a man has achieved in the
[35:26] spiritual or any natural or whatever it
[35:28] is
[35:28] it means that what really separates
[35:31] those who have in a spiritual realm any
[35:33] natural realm
[35:34] from those who do not have the what is
[35:37] really the management of time
[35:41] can i say that one more time what really
[35:44] separates
[35:45] is the management of time and if you
[35:48] live
[35:49] by the principles of scripture that
[35:52] gives you
[35:52] insight into you know the bible say wake
[35:55] up early
[35:56] like scripture you know
[36:01] do i say consider the ant simple things
[36:05] when you go through it and and and
[36:06] that's why i love it because we can take
[36:08] consider the aunt how we toys and it
[36:10] goes through
[36:11] all these examples and you read through
[36:13] proverbs and you see
[36:14] when those cities are in in in in
[36:17] so that means if you're a man given the
[36:19] appetite put a knife to your truth
[36:23] dice bible that's in the bible you know
[36:26] if you're a man given to appetite
[36:28] so if you like to eat depending on where
[36:30] you go
[36:31] put a knife to your own truth in other
[36:33] words behave yourself conduct yourself
[36:35] get in our order
[36:36] that is scripture
[36:40] so so these principles that the bible
[36:43] would show us
[36:44] about in in all labor there's reward so
[36:47] how could you expect a reward if there's
[36:49] no labor
[36:50] it's a principle whatever your soul your
[36:52] reap
[36:54] that's a principle so you're so certain
[36:57] good things you will reap good things
[36:58] just so bad things you'll reap
[37:00] these are principles and they're people
[37:03] in a natural
[37:04] who live by these principles and would
[37:06] achieve a certain measure and i see a
[37:08] certain
[37:09] measure of success because god is a god
[37:12] of his law and of his promises
[37:14] so that's why we say the rain will fall
[37:17] on the just and the unjust
[37:18] because it's principles all right so
[37:21] i'm coming to the point about choice and
[37:23] how timothy
[37:25] although it would seem as if he didn't
[37:27] have the best home that he would have
[37:29] grown up and he didn't grow up
[37:31] in the house of a pastor or a deacon or
[37:33] a believer so to speak
[37:35] that was he didn't have a father figure
[37:36] or a role model
[37:39] and i would have made the point last
[37:41] week and i hope it resonates with you
[37:43] for every person who speaks of what they
[37:45] did not have
[37:46] and want to use it as a reason to to
[37:49] account or make
[37:51] and i want to be careful saying there's
[37:52] excuses for where they're at i can show
[37:54] you
[37:55] somebody with the very same limitation
[37:58] who made a decision to go beyond it
[38:03] and you have a choice and this is one of
[38:05] the greatest decisions you have to make
[38:07] tonight
[38:09] you can live in the realm of negativity
[38:12] and look at the negative influences
[38:14] around you and there are people who are
[38:16] inspired by negativity
[38:18] when you're inspired by negativity you
[38:21] can have a party and it's called a pity
[38:22] party
[38:24] so when you're inspired by negativity
[38:26] you spend your time
[38:27] glorifying what car workout what can
[38:30] happen
[38:30] what is impossible you're what you
[38:32] cannot do what you can achieve
[38:34] what we never have but if you change
[38:37] your focus and your eyes and your
[38:39] mindset
[38:40] on what is possible and what is
[38:43] happening
[38:44] and what should be accomplished and
[38:45] achieved then your whole disposition
[38:48] begins to change
[38:51] anybody with me i don't know if this is
[38:54] inspiring anybody at all but
[38:56] i i trust that it is
[39:00] so timothy had to make a decision
[39:05] and the thing about it is your spiritual
[39:08] success
[39:09] just as your natural success is based on
[39:12] little decisions
[39:18] little decisions that we make every
[39:20] single day
[39:21] could destroy your life
[39:25] could destroy family to destroy your
[39:28] spiritual walk
[39:31] because you allowed a simple situation
[39:34] to get out of hand
[39:36] let's get back on on theme so we would
[39:38] find out that timothy
[39:40] made the right decisions and in making
[39:43] the right decision he was privileged to
[39:45] be able to travel with paul
[39:47] throughout many locations beyond the
[39:50] fact that he traveled with paul
[39:53] we will realize that many of
[39:56] the books that we read in the new
[39:58] testament
[39:59] you could almost say were co-authored
[40:03] by timothy so we would read that paul an
[40:06] apostle of jesus christ by the will of
[40:08] god and timothy our brother
[40:10] and that timothy would be on the quality
[40:14] supporting end the supporting role the
[40:16] advisory role because he would be there
[40:18] with paul
[40:19] you know sending greetings sending
[40:21] encouragement sending
[40:23] admonition you know to each of these
[40:25] groups who had their
[40:26] own unique challenges so he would be
[40:28] aware of these challenges he would be
[40:30] aware of their situations he would be
[40:31] aware of all these things
[40:33] and then when we come to first and
[40:35] second timothy
[40:37] it'll be the first time that timothy is
[40:40] not sharing he is not
[40:41] helping he's not advising he's not
[40:43] admonishing he's not teaching
[40:46] he's not representing paul but he is now
[40:49] being given
[40:49] instruction and it's very important to
[40:52] us because
[40:53] many of us sometimes we find ourselves
[40:55] in the role of being a teacher
[40:57] or a help or advisor but it's important
[41:00] that we learn how to be taught and we
[41:02] learn how to be encouraged
[41:04] we learn how to be you know and and
[41:07] and the best example that i could see of
[41:09] that and i've said this before
[41:11] you know is is jesus the word made flesh
[41:15] would sit in the temple from just about
[41:18] age 12
[41:19] as it were uh all the way to
[41:23] to the time that he has to take his
[41:25] place is his ministry as it were
[41:27] you know 18 years of of silence
[41:30] and the bible said it was his custom to
[41:32] be in the temple which meant jesus
[41:34] subjected himself
[41:35] to the very same thing that any
[41:38] young person growing up like he was
[41:41] would have done
[41:43] and at no point in time did he
[41:46] break ran so to speak to show he was
[41:48] anything more than just a believer
[41:51] so it is a great lesson in maturity
[41:54] to understand that no matter your
[41:58] position you could be humble no matter
[42:01] your station
[42:02] you can get advice you're not above
[42:05] learning from anybody
[42:06] so i consider myself a student of
[42:08] scripture i don't consider myself
[42:10] learning in any way but by the grace of
[42:12] god
[42:14] i love the word i love the believers and
[42:17] i love
[42:17] most of all seeing progress seeing
[42:20] growth
[42:20] peter would say add to your faith virtue
[42:22] and divert your knowledge
[42:24] in other words i want to see your
[42:25] progress i want to see you
[42:27] increase i want to see you grow from
[42:29] strength to strength to strength so
[42:31] may the lord bless us tonight if you
[42:33] have your bibles we would have reached
[42:36] we were in second timothy and we were in
[42:39] chapter 2
[42:40] and we would have reached about verse
[42:42] 15.
[42:44] so i just want to pick up from verse
[42:47] 14 and we're going to continue there uh
[42:50] for maybe a few minutes or so half hour
[42:52] or so and and see where we would read by
[42:55] the grace of god and
[42:56] to encourage you as we just study this
[43:00] together to see
[43:02] both try to understand if i can say that
[43:05] what paul is trying to share to timothy
[43:09] and not just what he's sharing to
[43:11] timothy
[43:12] for his edification but
[43:16] what timothy also had to be trying to
[43:19] pick up from this
[43:20] one two and thirdly that after all of
[43:23] these years have passed
[43:25] because it's here for a purpose for us
[43:26] to take instruction from it as well
[43:28] so when paul is speaking you have to see
[43:31] okay how does this
[43:32] help me my family house the church
[43:35] because this here is words of life to us
[43:37] all right
[43:38] so let's start from second timothy 2 and
[43:40] verse 14
[43:41] of these things put them in remembrance
[43:44] charging them before the lord that they
[43:46] strive not
[43:47] about words to no prophet but to the
[43:50] subverting of the hearers all right so
[43:53] that's 2 verse 14 we would have read
[43:55] that
[43:55] last week as well uh and
[43:59] in another translation that verse 14
[44:01] says remind them of these things in
[44:03] other words the things that i've been
[44:04] talking about remind them of these
[44:05] things
[44:06] and charge them before god in other
[44:08] words hold them before god
[44:09] not to quarrel about words which does no
[44:13] good but only ruins the hearers
[44:15] all right so it's an encouragement to us
[44:17] as believers and in life
[44:19] don't waste time talking about things
[44:21] that have no value
[44:23] don't waste time there's so many things
[44:26] to do when you have a limited time you
[44:27] really have to choose what to do with
[44:28] your time you know
[44:29] if you want to talk about u.s elections
[44:32] and this and that
[44:33] for the whole day you can spend your
[44:34] whole day doing it you know but what is
[44:35] the
[44:36] profit about it how does it benefit you
[44:38] how does it advance your objective
[44:40] spiritually
[44:41] naturally family wise all right and then
[44:43] he goes on study to show yourself
[44:45] approved
[44:46] which is what we are doing right now we
[44:47] are studying so that we could show
[44:49] ourselves a proof we want to
[44:50] have a clear understanding we want to
[44:53] have a clear understanding and
[44:54] an appreciation of what this means how
[44:57] does it apply to me
[44:59] so learning is not just about reading
[45:00] it's about how does it help me what
[45:02] change
[45:03] should i expect when i go through this
[45:05] all right should i serve a proof unto
[45:07] god
[45:07] a workman that needed not be ashamed
[45:10] rightly dividing the word of truth
[45:15] but and again paul is reinforcing it
[45:17] here
[45:18] but son so now we reach a new part we we
[45:21] we we know it's a new territory from
[45:23] last week but sun
[45:25] profane and vein babblings
[45:28] for they will increase onto more
[45:30] ungodliness
[45:31] i want to read that one more time but
[45:33] shun profane
[45:34] and vain babblings for they will
[45:37] increase
[45:38] onto more ungodliness
[45:41] the bible said the book of prophets are
[45:43] fool
[45:44] when he is silent is considered wise
[45:49] paul is encouraging timothy and i want
[45:51] to read it in another translation
[45:53] but avoid irreverent babble
[45:58] for it will lead people onto more and
[46:00] more ungodliness
[46:03] so i want to encourage you this is not
[46:05] about a great mystery
[46:07] because there are people who know great
[46:08] mystery and they cannot stop talking
[46:10] shipping us
[46:14] they know a lot of things about the
[46:16] message but catch them after work
[46:19] when they're not in the environment of
[46:21] believers
[46:22] and put them in the middle of a
[46:24] discussion about politics
[46:26] about the election about the government
[46:28] about dddd
[46:30] you name it they have something to say
[46:32] that would qualify as
[46:34] irreverent bubble for it will lead
[46:36] people into more
[46:38] and more ongoing you know much families
[46:41] and how much fights and and situations
[46:44] because people just said the wrong thing
[46:46] people are you are you and talk so much
[46:48] until they said what couldn't be taken
[46:50] back
[46:51] but here it is now i want you to
[46:53] understand the context of this
[46:54] conversation
[46:55] this is paul the apostle messing with
[46:57] the age speaking to a minister
[46:59] so he is warning a young minister a
[47:02] young believer
[47:03] because your cabinet minister you know
[47:05] they believe her he shouldn't be heard
[47:07] and saved as a believer so i want you to
[47:08] also see
[47:09] the parallels that it also applies to
[47:11] being a believer
[47:12] so listen don't talk stupidness control
[47:14] how you speak
[47:15] so when people meet you as a believer
[47:18] one of the
[47:18] attributes that you should exhibit or
[47:21] one of the things you
[47:22] should not exhibit his irreverent bible
[47:24] for it will lead
[47:25] people into more ungodliness all right
[47:28] and their word will eat as dot a conquer
[47:31] another word for kang is gangrene
[47:33] in other words the words have an effect
[47:35] on people of whom
[47:37] is and paul is actually naming brothers
[47:40] who are guilty of this thing
[47:42] so for them brothers you know when you
[47:44] read scripture
[47:45] and you see names names have meanings
[47:48] and contexts
[47:49] these brothers lord help them paul is
[47:52] using them as the reference of what not
[47:54] to do
[47:55] lord let us be examples of what to do
[47:57] when people call your name
[47:59] let your name be called as an example of
[48:01] what to do
[48:02] and what and not what not what you
[48:04] should not be doing but here it is
[48:06] policing
[48:08] these two brothers who considering the
[48:10] truth have heard
[48:12] hear how they've heard seeing the
[48:13] resurrection is passed
[48:15] already and overthrow the faith of some
[48:18] now i want you to catch this here now
[48:20] paul is speaking about two
[48:23] brothers because within context these
[48:26] would have been brothers who
[48:27] or or or men who around the faith so to
[48:30] speak
[48:31] who because the bible they bible their
[48:33] bible till they battle into heresy
[48:36] and have in fact overthrown the fate of
[48:39] some
[48:40] so they talk they talk they talk until
[48:42] by the time they finish talk
[48:44] people lost their feet so paul is
[48:47] encouraging
[48:49] can the church say amen so and then paul
[48:52] goes on in verse 19.
[48:53] nevertheless in other words all that
[48:56] being the case
[48:57] the foundation of god standing sure
[49:00] having this seal
[49:01] your lord knoweth them that are his
[49:04] and let everyone that name it the name
[49:07] of christ depart from iniquity
[49:09] can the church say amen now he goes on
[49:12] so your personal life now he said but in
[49:16] a great house there are not only vessels
[49:19] of gold and of silver
[49:21] but also of wood and of earth
[49:24] and some to honor and some to dishonor
[49:28] so he's making a very interesting
[49:30] positioning here
[49:32] he is saying there are different kinds
[49:33] of vessels some are gold some are silver
[49:36] some are wood and clay
[49:37] despite you being gold you could be gold
[49:40] and honorable or gold
[49:42] and dishonorable i want you to see that
[49:44] you could be silver and honorable and it
[49:46] could be silver and dishonorable
[49:49] you could be wood and honorable you
[49:51] could be wood and dishonorable
[49:53] you could be clay and honorable you
[49:54] could be clay and dishonorable in other
[49:56] words
[49:57] no matter your station there's a choice
[50:00] of being honorable or dishonorable
[50:03] everybody seeing that so paul is
[50:05] painting a tapestry
[50:06] for timothy to understand no matter what
[50:10] your station
[50:11] you have a choice to be honorable or
[50:13] dishonorable so he goes on 21
[50:16] if a man therefore purge himself from
[50:19] these
[50:20] now this is not god purging no
[50:24] this is if a man and that would purge in
[50:26] this context mean
[50:27] cleanse so therefore if anyone cleans
[50:30] himself
[50:30] from what is dishonorable
[50:34] everybody with me so if a man therefore
[50:37] pulls himself from these he shall be a
[50:39] vessel under honor
[50:40] sanctified and meet for the master's use
[50:44] that word is fit or useful to the master
[50:48] so in other words paul now is coming
[50:52] home to timothy and saying you
[50:55] have work to do and this is what a lot
[50:58] of people
[50:59] don't like to hear that they have the
[51:02] actual work to do
[51:03] so as much as i come tonight and
[51:05] highlight this
[51:06] you have a choice to do to be honorable
[51:10] to push yourself from the dishonorable
[51:12] to push yourself from
[51:14] the conversations from the friends from
[51:16] the whatsapp chats
[51:18] from the facebook groups from the
[51:19] websites from the movies
[51:21] from the newspapers from whatever it is
[51:24] that could contaminate you that you
[51:26] could be honorable
[51:28] so here paul is actually bringing a
[51:30] message of sanctification right here
[51:32] anybody with me everybody with me and
[51:35] whatever i've been preaching about it
[51:36] i'm just showing you
[51:37] everything that is preached and is
[51:39] brought to the prophetic message you can
[51:40] find it in scripture
[51:41] you just have to slow down take your
[51:43] time and
[51:44] read it and meditate on it and then he
[51:47] goes on
[51:48] so he's nailing it down now flee
[51:51] also youthful lust
[51:54] so just after you deal with dishonorable
[51:56] and honorable keep going in for the kill
[51:58] flee also youthful lust
[52:02] you'd hear preach avoid shady places but
[52:04] this flea don't mean walk away you know
[52:09] this flea flea is not even running her
[52:14] young brothers young sisters this flea
[52:18] is not walk it's not even run it's not
[52:20] jog away
[52:21] this is run for your life you know
[52:24] flea also youthful loss
[52:28] and i like how this is positioned
[52:30] because youthful lust
[52:32] is not speaking to young people oh boy
[52:37] youthful lust is not speaking to young
[52:39] people it is speaking to the lust
[52:41] associated with being young
[52:44] so you could be 70 years old with
[52:45] youthfulness oh help us jesus
[52:51] so this is not a message here to young
[52:53] people it's a message to the entire
[52:54] church
[52:55] flee also youthfulness
[53:00] but follow righteousness faith
[53:04] charity peace with them that call
[53:07] on the lord out of a pure heart listen
[53:10] carefully i want to say it again i want
[53:12] you to see this
[53:13] follow righteousness faith charity peace
[53:17] with them the operative teaching here
[53:20] is not just follow after charity and he
[53:22] says no it is
[53:24] how you follow you are following with
[53:26] them
[53:27] that call on the lord out of a pure
[53:30] heart this sounds familiar
[53:31] this sounds like when the prophet said
[53:33] if you want to get the holy ghost
[53:35] spend time with people who have the holy
[53:37] ghost anybody remembers that
[53:38] so he say in following in following
[53:42] righteousness and faith you're supposed
[53:44] to be following it with
[53:45] them so it means your associations
[53:49] your friends the people around you
[53:50] you're with them who you spend your time
[53:53] with
[53:53] them and you do things with them they
[53:56] should be following the same principles
[53:59] and that call on the lord out of a pure
[54:02] heart
[54:03] one of the reasons and again i don't
[54:06] like excuses if if anybody spend enough
[54:09] time with me
[54:10] he would know i don't like excuses and
[54:12] maybe
[54:13] maybe something i got from the way god
[54:15] treated moses
[54:16] but when moses finished talk and talk
[54:18] and talk and had all his excuses
[54:20] god say you're still going one
[54:23] of the greatest challenges that i've
[54:25] seen with young
[54:26] and old is people who
[54:29] have created stronger bonds and
[54:32] friendships
[54:33] quote unquote with people who don't
[54:35] share their values
[54:37] their beliefs their trajectory their
[54:39] direction
[54:40] so you have a situation and instead of
[54:43] talking to somebody who is of defeat
[54:45] because i am sharpening iron and confess
[54:47] your fault one to another these
[54:49] scriptures
[54:49] may not have resonated with them just
[54:51] yet they go for advice and counsel
[54:54] from people who have no foundation in
[54:57] word and scripture
[54:58] so they are following after other things
[55:01] and they confide in people
[55:03] who really cannot have their best
[55:05] interest because they don't know what
[55:06] best interest looks like
[55:07] is this speaking to anybody so the point
[55:10] i want to make about excuses is when
[55:12] people say to me
[55:12] well i don't have any friends in church
[55:16] oh i do have any believers who are
[55:17] friends
[55:19] but you have friends in in your job
[55:20] right so so
[55:22] isn't that also a choice
[55:25] isn't who you who you choose to talk
[55:27] with and spend time with and deliberate
[55:30] about isn't that also
[55:31] a choice that you make so again
[55:36] if something is really important to you
[55:40] it should be that you put extra to get
[55:43] it
[55:44] you know and i was sharing with my wife
[55:46] recently you know you look at people do
[55:47] do things
[55:48] and stuff and i say you know when
[55:49] somebody really wants something you know
[55:51] because they will go all out to get it
[55:53] they already want it they will go all
[55:54] out because it's important to them
[55:56] you ask somebody for a favor they say
[55:58] well i'll do it i'll do it for you but
[56:00] but and
[56:00] it you can't vex with them because when
[56:04] they have to do something for themselves
[56:05] that is important to them
[56:06] you listen you need to wake up three
[56:08] o'clock in the morning
[56:10] the upper tree in the morning you know
[56:11] because they find it important to them
[56:13] so i want to challenge you don't make
[56:15] the mistake
[56:17] of having all these friends in your
[56:20] workplace
[56:20] or in your school or in a neighborhood
[56:23] who are not sharing this
[56:25] because in the attempt to flee
[56:28] youthful lust you have to this is the
[56:30] instruction of timothy unto us tonight
[56:32] follow righteousness faith charity peace
[56:35] with
[56:36] them that call on the lord out of a pure
[56:38] heart
[56:39] we can spend the whole next 30 minutes
[56:41] talking about the pure hard part
[56:44] because people call on you lord but many
[56:47] not with a pure heart
[56:49] pure heart means a heart without an
[56:50] agenda a heart without
[56:53] you know uh uh uh how do you say boy i'm
[56:56] i'm blessed and not stressed
[56:58] anything and there's no attempt to
[57:00] reconcile those statements with a life
[57:02] so it's not from my place of genuineness
[57:04] so you have the psalmist david
[57:06] who was always saying creating me a
[57:08] clean heart a pure heart
[57:10] renewing the right spirit within me and
[57:13] all of these scriptures is to see
[57:15] he paralyzed through the word so that we
[57:17] can reflect and look at our daily lives
[57:20] because the word friends
[57:21] have to have an impact on daily lives i
[57:24] don't know if this
[57:25] has been anybody but my deep desire
[57:28] is to see the world living me and the
[57:31] world living in
[57:32] us is not a sunday wednesday night
[57:35] tuesday bible study friday night
[57:36] situation
[57:38] we're dealing with situation on the job
[57:41] in your work
[57:42] in your neighborhood in the bank and you
[57:44] tell me boy i get so
[57:45] vexed with that bank man here give me
[57:47] the loan and think and what's not
[57:49] and you give up customer a long time ago
[57:51] but in your heart
[57:55] your formerly same energy uniformly
[57:57] words or no but the energy when they
[57:59] translate the energy
[58:00] of what your walker the banquet that i'm
[58:03] considering is the same thing
[58:06] because you still have issues that you
[58:08] have to resolve and when you look at it
[58:10] that is not how jesus was would would
[58:13] would conduct himself
[58:14] that is not how the prophet would behave
[58:15] himself
[58:18] can the church say amen so what we are
[58:19] fighting for is a life
[58:21] and when you strip back all the
[58:23] cosmetics strip back
[58:24] all the acting strip back the great
[58:27] performing and academy awards
[58:29] stellar award behavior we do god bless
[58:31] you behind that
[58:33] barrier behind that veil that inner man
[58:36] has to be dealt with
[58:38] and that is what the word comes to deal
[58:40] with the inner man to strip out to
[58:42] perform
[58:42] surgery by the word by the scripture so
[58:45] that we can grow up to be sons and
[58:47] daughters of god
[58:48] that could handle the responsibility and
[58:50] he could say dear is my spirit flowing
[58:52] freely
[58:52] friends for the spirit of god to flow
[58:55] freely
[58:56] it means there's no hindrance there's no
[58:58] obstacle
[58:59] there's nothing that could stop god flow
[59:01] into your life
[59:02] sickness can't stop him flowing your
[59:04] past cast up and throw him
[59:05] don't cast up him fluid his spirit could
[59:08] flow freely
[59:09] because you have brought everything on
[59:10] the subjection and kind of chill say man
[59:14] at this rate prove it this is
[59:18] a study of timothy part two it looked
[59:20] like we might have to do
[59:22] a part three because we move in slowly
[59:27] we move in we win straight tonight but i
[59:28] hope it's been a blessing to you i hope
[59:30] that you are enjoying this as much as i
[59:33] am
[59:34] and um and and and you want to take it
[59:37] and apply it in your daily walk
[59:39] okay so but foolish
[59:42] this is verse 23 now this is
[59:46] interesting but foolish and unlearned
[59:49] questions avoid
[59:53] but foolish and unlearned questions
[59:56] avoid
[59:58] knowing that they do gender strife
[1:00:02] in another champion they have nothing to
[1:00:04] do with foolish and
[1:00:06] ignorant controversies you know that
[1:00:08] they breed quarrels
[1:00:12] you know people like to pick fights
[1:00:16] they get that pleasure they get that
[1:00:18] pleasure and see
[1:00:19] like they know they know just what to
[1:00:21] say
[1:00:23] to get you to respond a certain way
[1:00:26] and if you don't know how to avoid
[1:00:29] either the situation or the people
[1:00:32] before you know it you'll be in a strife
[1:00:33] winner
[1:00:35] so but interestingly just to put things
[1:00:38] in context
[1:00:39] every scripture you could read about
[1:00:41] timothy
[1:00:43] there is nothing to suggest that timothy
[1:00:45] was like peter
[1:00:48] when you look at peter peter comes
[1:00:49] across as he ready peter is like
[1:00:51] peter fella if you're in trouble you're
[1:00:53] one peter with you
[1:00:55] you know if you're ever in a problem you
[1:00:57] have people around you who
[1:00:59] you you know they go they would jump
[1:01:01] they would jump they would jump in the
[1:01:02] fight
[1:01:05] peter is the kind of one somebody
[1:01:06] testing it people say were you
[1:01:08] i i hear i with your hair with you don't
[1:01:10] worry i with you
[1:01:12] timothy doesn't come across like that
[1:01:14] kind of man timmy comes across very meek
[1:01:17] very gentle in fact theologians would
[1:01:20] say he was he almost came across a
[1:01:21] little sickly
[1:01:22] you know very very vitamin but here it
[1:01:25] is paul is encouraging him
[1:01:26] but foolish and unlearned question avoid
[1:01:29] knowing
[1:01:30] that you'll end up in a coral and listen
[1:01:33] nobody
[1:01:34] has ended up in a quarrel and felt good
[1:01:36] about it anybody is there anybody in
[1:01:38] this room tonight
[1:01:39] who went through a coral and he didn't
[1:01:41] have no headache your blood pressure
[1:01:43] didn't raise
[1:01:44] your choke is it is there anybody who
[1:01:46] like warling
[1:01:48] so as a principle so many times
[1:01:52] and when you read this and you see paul
[1:01:54] is speaking to timothy as a son
[1:01:57] so if your father never tell you this
[1:02:00] this is paul
[1:02:01] in a role of a father speaking to a son
[1:02:04] in the ways of life and your way of
[1:02:06] living to avoid issues the quarrel that
[1:02:09] you
[1:02:09] end up here in is not the devil
[1:02:11] portuguese
[1:02:12] this is you encouraging and getting
[1:02:15] involved in foolish and alone questions
[1:02:17] and creating your own issues all right
[1:02:19] anybody with me all right good let's
[1:02:22] move on
[1:02:25] so that what was said is now a
[1:02:27] background to
[1:02:28] introduce and pause writing when you
[1:02:31] read this it's really profound like
[1:02:33] it is really racist because it's almost
[1:02:34] like he lays a foundation
[1:02:36] creates almost like the opposite
[1:02:38] situation paints a picture
[1:02:39] of what not to do and then comes them
[1:02:41] back to what to do and the sermon of the
[1:02:43] lord so he's speaking to him
[1:02:44] as a minister as a young ma as a young
[1:02:47] man servant of the lord
[1:02:49] and but this applies to all of us
[1:02:51] because we are all in our own little
[1:02:52] worlds
[1:02:53] a servant but ibrahim teaches us that
[1:02:55] everybody is a preacher
[1:02:56] you mean you may not preach any pulpit
[1:02:59] but your your your
[1:03:00] your your preachers so many you live
[1:03:02] your sermon
[1:03:03] and the servant of the lord must not
[1:03:05] strive and that word strive in that
[1:03:08] context
[1:03:08] is not must be quarrelsome
[1:03:12] so whenever you see a brother or sister
[1:03:14] just quarrel something
[1:03:16] you know it that's not a it's not
[1:03:17] quarrel back with them just pray for
[1:03:19] them just remember them and pray
[1:03:21] they're working out they're still
[1:03:22] working on it but don't get any quarrel
[1:03:25] because brought up here they're not into
[1:03:27] problems
[1:03:28] and the several law must not strive
[1:03:52] wheaton waiting on the promise
[1:03:55] waiting on an answer waiting for
[1:03:58] you still small voice that is something
[1:04:01] that we have to practice
[1:04:02] practice patience there's so many things
[1:04:05] we
[1:04:06] think we want in life and many times we
[1:04:07] get into trouble because we rush to do
[1:04:09] things
[1:04:10] without exhibiting patients so they're
[1:04:12] just dropping that in there
[1:04:13] in meekness instructing those that
[1:04:15] oppose themselves
[1:04:17] friends there will always be opposition
[1:04:20] all the people who do agree with you
[1:04:22] even paul and peter didn't see eye to
[1:04:24] eye but it's how you manage it it's how
[1:04:26] you deal with it
[1:04:27] if god per adventure will give them
[1:04:30] repentance
[1:04:32] to the acknowledging of the truth and
[1:04:34] that they may recover themselves out of
[1:04:36] the snare of the devil
[1:04:37] who are taken captive by him at his will
[1:04:40] so that's the end of chapter two
[1:04:41] and we're gonna just go a little bit
[1:04:43] into second timothy three this is a big
[1:04:45] one
[1:04:46] because you see it through the message
[1:04:48] you see it always been identified as a
[1:04:50] bucket second timothy tree spirits
[1:04:53] is a whole bunch of spirits there's a
[1:04:56] whole bunch of spirits in there
[1:04:58] but this know also that in the last days
[1:05:01] powerful scripture perilous time shall
[1:05:04] come
[1:05:05] and i don't know about you but this is
[1:05:07] spiritual times
[1:05:09] it's a time of difficulty this know also
[1:05:12] that in the last days perilous times
[1:05:14] shall come
[1:05:15] for men shall be lovers of their own
[1:05:18] selves
[1:05:21] covetous
[1:05:24] boasters proud
[1:05:29] blasphemers disobedient to parents
[1:05:34] unthankful unholy
[1:05:38] without natural affection
[1:05:42] truth breakers false accusers
[1:05:46] incontinent fierce despisers of those
[1:05:51] that are good
[1:05:52] traitors heavy high-minded
[1:05:56] lovers of pleasure more than lovers of
[1:05:59] god
[1:06:00] against that backdrop your apostle paul
[1:06:04] goes on
[1:06:05] having a form of godliness
[1:06:08] but denying the power thereof from such
[1:06:12] turn away and
[1:06:16] i think everybody here would have heard
[1:06:18] this before but i deliberately wanted to
[1:06:20] read it slowly
[1:06:21] because whatever you see going on in the
[1:06:24] world you can find it under one of these
[1:06:26] things
[1:06:29] without self-control lovers of self
[1:06:33] proud abusive disobedient appearance
[1:06:37] despises of those that are good lovers
[1:06:40] of pleasure
[1:06:40] one and lovers of god
[1:06:44] it is easy to for people to do what goes
[1:06:47] against god
[1:06:48] versus coming under subjection to god
[1:06:51] you speak to somebody who has been here
[1:06:53] for some time they would say when
[1:06:54] 20 40 50 years ago everybody walked the
[1:06:57] street to say good morning good morning
[1:06:58] but as time passed
[1:07:00] what they call manners are to go away
[1:07:01] all of that is part of the
[1:07:03] what is called the apostasy falling away
[1:07:05] part of this
[1:07:06] breakdown what they call a breakdown in
[1:07:08] society is really a spiritual condition
[1:07:11] disobedient appearance
[1:07:15] it's a spirit so it's not
[1:07:18] the child it's a spirited you know the
[1:07:21] spirit of the age
[1:07:23] and then what makes it an insult is that
[1:07:26] these conditions can be wrapped into
[1:07:30] having a form of godliness and this is
[1:07:33] where it gets destructive now because
[1:07:35] you have people who are exhibiting these
[1:07:37] behaviors
[1:07:38] but they have a form of godliness so
[1:07:41] they
[1:07:42] they're trying to be spiritual trying to
[1:07:43] be religious but denying the power
[1:07:45] thereof
[1:07:46] because denying the power because the
[1:07:47] power brings you under subjection to god
[1:07:51] but if and say was your holy was given
[1:07:52] for power to pray power to live a holy
[1:07:54] life
[1:07:56] power to speak so the power of god
[1:07:59] you can't tell me you have the power of
[1:08:01] god and you have the holy ghost
[1:08:03] and you and you're exhibiting these
[1:08:05] behaviors
[1:08:07] and these behaviors exist not just in
[1:08:09] the world friends they actually operate
[1:08:10] within the church
[1:08:11] within the framework of the church and
[1:08:13] brother branham said within every setup
[1:08:15] three kinds of believers
[1:08:17] so it is it is not that that we are
[1:08:20] ignorant of this but we have to
[1:08:22] understand that this is also now
[1:08:24] prophecy that we are living in
[1:08:26] when we see this
[1:08:30] for of this sort are they which creep
[1:08:33] into houses so if you never read it
[1:08:37] before i want you to understand it
[1:08:38] creep in the houses and lead captive
[1:08:41] silly woman
[1:08:42] laden with sins led away by divers
[1:08:45] lust
[1:08:50] ever learning but robert preaches this a
[1:08:52] lot ever learning
[1:08:54] i'm never able to come to the knowledge
[1:08:57] of the truth
[1:08:58] so the more information they get
[1:09:02] the more knowledge the more revelation
[1:09:05] the more ideas
[1:09:06] you're getting more but you're not
[1:09:08] getting closer to the truth
[1:09:11] and i've spoken this before you see you
[1:09:13] can't hide
[1:09:15] in front of the truth
[1:09:18] because no lie can stand in front of the
[1:09:20] truth
[1:09:21] so you closely get the truth a good
[1:09:24] example is like isaiah
[1:09:25] coming into the presence of god when
[1:09:29] you're away from the truth
[1:09:30] you can't see so if the truth is light
[1:09:33] and light is true
[1:09:34] the further your way you can't see your
[1:09:36] issues you can't see your faults
[1:09:38] but if you instead of learning and
[1:09:39] you're getting closer to the truth
[1:09:41] you will never see an issue so you can't
[1:09:43] even come out of what you're in
[1:09:45] because the closer you come to truth or
[1:09:47] the light you begin to see
[1:09:49] your issues and any issues is not
[1:09:51] anybody else you know the issue becomes
[1:09:52] you
[1:09:54] and you could only you know when you're
[1:09:57] really coming contact with the truth or
[1:09:58] the light
[1:09:59] because you're now focused all your
[1:10:01] fingers in yourself who is me
[1:10:03] that's the only thing somebody who comes
[1:10:04] to the light will will begin to say
[1:10:06] where is me because you will see the
[1:10:08] light with no highlights
[1:10:11] wait a minute wait a minute i need to
[1:10:12] fix this i need to fix that
[1:10:15] paul is saying ever learning and that's
[1:10:18] why you have people who
[1:10:20] wait a message for years they know a lot
[1:10:23] of stuff
[1:10:25] but the truth is not there because
[1:10:29] survive what is coming or what is
[1:10:32] dealing with right now with just
[1:10:34] knowledge
[1:10:38] you cannot survive with jessica
[1:10:39] information
[1:10:41] you have to meet the truth the knowledge
[1:10:44] of the truth
[1:10:45] and paul goes on now as janice and
[1:10:48] jamboree witstered moses
[1:10:50] so do these also resist the truth
[1:10:54] and i want to do a teaching sometime
[1:10:55] with this issue of truth
[1:10:57] because this is this is the real this is
[1:10:59] the real real real thing here
[1:11:01] jesus said i'm the way i'm the truth i'm
[1:11:04] the life
[1:11:06] most people can't confront the truth
[1:11:13] i'll say that again
[1:11:17] most people cannot confront the truth
[1:11:20] because you have to be really prepared
[1:11:21] to deal with the truth
[1:11:24] there's some people say well i can't do
[1:11:25] this and i can't do this and
[1:11:27] if they already hear the truth behind
[1:11:29] what is holding them back they don't
[1:11:30] want to accept it
[1:11:33] i'll give you another example the truth
[1:11:35] has to deal with
[1:11:36] blame as well so you have people saying
[1:11:38] well the reason i am this way is because
[1:11:39] this happened
[1:11:41] but the real truth is you can't blame
[1:11:43] anybody else for your decisions and your
[1:11:45] actions you know
[1:11:48] but it's easy it is convenient it is
[1:11:51] convenient to blame other situations for
[1:11:54] your position
[1:11:56] but the truth now places it squarely
[1:11:58] back on your responsibility to take
[1:12:00] action
[1:12:01] we will spend some more time talking
[1:12:03] about that now as janice and jamboree
[1:12:05] withstood
[1:12:06] moses so do these also resist the truth
[1:12:10] men of corrupt minds reprobate
[1:12:13] concerning defeat
[1:12:15] but they shall proceed no further for
[1:12:18] their follies shall be manifest unto all
[1:12:20] men
[1:12:21] as theirs also was so paul is saying the
[1:12:24] same way janice and jamborees
[1:12:26] ended up being exposed
[1:12:30] those who operate the same way men of
[1:12:32] corrupt mind
[1:12:34] reprobate concerning defeat who come to
[1:12:37] deceive and you see
[1:12:38] they will all to be exposed so this is
[1:12:42] this is now a whole shift in paul's
[1:12:45] instructional timothy
[1:12:46] around our behavior and he's saying and
[1:12:48] now we've committed a doctrine
[1:12:50] and friends we cannot be ignorant of the
[1:12:52] issue of doctrine
[1:12:53] we cannot be ignorant on the devil
[1:12:55] trying to clot your mind
[1:12:57] from seeing what your portion is what
[1:12:59] your inheritance is
[1:13:00] what your spiritual possession should be
[1:13:03] nothing should distract you
[1:13:05] from your spiritual journey and purpose
[1:13:07] of adoption
[1:13:08] of perfection of the holy ghost of seven
[1:13:11] living voices
[1:13:12] because that is where we want to be that
[1:13:15] is what we should be displaying
[1:13:17] can the church say amen so now
[1:13:21] paul begins to give some measure of the
[1:13:24] antidote so to speak
[1:13:26] and begin to speak to encourage him now
[1:13:28] but thou
[1:13:29] has fully known my doctrine
[1:13:32] now that's a powerful statement so paul
[1:13:34] is speaking to a preacher
[1:13:36] and we have lady background so friends
[1:13:39] as believers as sons and daughters can
[1:13:42] you make a statement
[1:13:43] that you fully know the doctrine that
[1:13:46] you understand this message that if
[1:13:47] somebody comes with something that's
[1:13:49] beautifully presented that you can say
[1:13:51] no that is not what it is
[1:13:53] because paul will be the same one to say
[1:13:55] if an angel comes from heaven and he
[1:13:57] says something different
[1:13:58] let him be accused so this whole thing
[1:14:01] is about studying to be approved to
[1:14:03] understand induction so when you
[1:14:04] hear something because i've said it
[1:14:06] before it is impossible
[1:14:09] to prepare you for every count of it
[1:14:11] because common defense will always exist
[1:14:13] so the best defense we have is to make
[1:14:15] sure that the truth is so plain
[1:14:17] that you understand what a real dollar
[1:14:18] looks like so that when a culture will
[1:14:20] come you can say this is not that this
[1:14:22] is not that this is not that
[1:14:24] anybody with meat tonight but thou
[1:14:27] has fully known my doctrine
[1:14:30] manner of life purpose

[1:15:39] yeah we're actually gonna we're gonna
[1:15:40] make it to where i wanted to be at
[1:15:41] tonight just a few more
[1:15:43] minutes but evil men and seducers shall
[1:15:46] wax worse and worse deceiving and being
[1:15:49] deceived now that scripture right there
[1:15:51] i don't even know what to deal with that
[1:15:53] because evil men and seducers
[1:15:56] shall what's worse and worse deceiving
[1:15:58] and being deceived
[1:16:00] no but a clearance it's one thing to be
[1:16:03] deceiving people
[1:16:04] it's the next thing when you see people
[1:16:05] and you yourself being deceived in them
[1:16:08] whether it's create that that is a
[1:16:09] that's a scary thing
[1:16:12] and what's worse and worse which means
[1:16:14] false doctrine
[1:16:15] false interpretation misappropriating
[1:16:18] scripture
[1:16:19] taking a prophet message and and the
[1:16:21] amount of
[1:16:22] craziness has come out of people who
[1:16:24] have done
[1:16:26] horrible harm with the script any
[1:16:28] message and when you thought it couldn't
[1:16:29] get worse
[1:16:30] there's worse when you thought they can
[1:16:33] create a new crazy adoption there's a
[1:16:35] crazy adoption and then you realize
[1:16:37] what's worse than was deceiving and
[1:16:39] being deceived
[1:16:42] but and i love this no matter how bad it
[1:16:45] gets
[1:16:46] no matter if it gets worse and worse no
[1:16:48] matter if they become deceived and they
[1:16:49] themselves deceiving and it doesn't
[1:16:51] matter but
[1:16:53] continue thou in the things which joe
[1:16:56] has learned
[1:16:57] and has been assured of knowing of whom
[1:17:01] thou has learned them in other words
[1:17:03] continue let me
[1:17:04] oh hallelujah anybody with me tonight
[1:17:09] but as for you but as for you continue
[1:17:12] in what you have learned and have firmly
[1:17:13] believed
[1:17:14] knowing from whom you have learned it
[1:17:16] hallelujah
[1:17:19] and that from a child though has known
[1:17:21] the holy scriptures
[1:17:23] you see the importance of knowing the
[1:17:24] scriptures and i've said it on congress
[1:17:27] location one of the greatest
[1:17:29] weaknesses in the message message
[1:17:32] believers
[1:17:32] do not know the bible and the ministry
[1:17:36] of that elijah
[1:17:37] was to shine more light on scripture so
[1:17:40] you have to study body message
[1:17:42] and the scripture because this word this
[1:17:45] written word this is the foundation but
[1:17:46] the branham himself
[1:17:48] had to go in scripture to find himself
[1:17:52] so his and he made the point clear he
[1:17:54] said whenever the angel came to me
[1:17:56] i checked what the angel said in
[1:17:58] scripture
[1:18:00] so if you don't know what scripture says
[1:18:03] how can you verify if is the right angel
[1:18:08] so that is but a branham himself had his
[1:18:10] own test he said when the angel came
[1:18:13] and brandon when you said he said it was
[1:18:15] it's been about six months since i saw
[1:18:16] the angel and when he came the angels
[1:18:18] looked at me and walked away
[1:18:20] and you have all these encounters but
[1:18:22] you see when he and judge speak i would
[1:18:23] first go and check the scripture
[1:18:25] to make sure that what the angels say
[1:18:27] and lining up in scripture
[1:18:30] so we want to be a church that is a word
[1:18:33] church a church that's built on this
[1:18:36] message of the hour
[1:18:37] but the church has also based firmly in
[1:18:40] scripture
[1:18:41] so that when paul's saying but from a
[1:18:43] child though has
[1:18:44] known the holy scriptures which are able
[1:18:47] to make thee
[1:18:47] wise under salvation true faith which is
[1:18:50] in christ jesus
[1:18:51] can the church say amen we almost
[1:18:53] finished
[1:18:55] and then paul nailed it down he said
[1:18:58] all scripture all
[1:19:02] scripture i want to nail it down it's
[1:19:04] given by
[1:19:05] inspiration of god and that's why
[1:19:07] brother branham said he said if you read
[1:19:09] the bible
[1:19:10] and don't see jesus in every verse read
[1:19:13] it again
[1:19:15] because all scripture is given by
[1:19:17] inspiration of god
[1:19:19] and it's profitable you want to make a
[1:19:21] profit you can make a guaranteed profit
[1:19:23] here
[1:19:24] it's profitable for doctrine for reproof
[1:19:27] for correction for instruction in
[1:19:30] righteousness so but ibrahimovic you
[1:19:33] want to grow as a christian
[1:19:35] read your bible pray every day and
[1:19:37] you'll grow we sing it in sunday school
[1:19:39] read your bible pray every day show me
[1:19:42] somebody in argument
[1:19:44] show me somebody in baccanal show me and
[1:19:46] by something i mean
[1:19:47] believers there in these situations i
[1:19:49] mean you will show me somebody who's not
[1:19:51] reading and praying every day
[1:19:55] hallelujah
[1:19:58] show me somebody who can find their way
[1:20:00] in life
[1:20:01] under this covenant because when you
[1:20:02] leave the world you're on a new covenant
[1:20:05] the principles that apply to the world
[1:20:07] don't apply to you when you leave the
[1:20:09] world
[1:20:10] let me say that one more time when you
[1:20:12] leave the world you are under a new
[1:20:14] covenant
[1:20:16] and that new covenant means the all
[1:20:18] rules no longer apply
[1:20:20] because you know better you you
[1:20:24] understand better can the church say
[1:20:26] amen
[1:20:27] all scripture is given by
[1:20:30] buffet style this thing you can't say
[1:20:33] well i like this
[1:20:34] and i don't like this and i don't like
[1:20:36] this all scripture is given by
[1:20:38] inspiration of god and it's profitable
[1:20:39] for
[1:20:40] doctrine for reproof for correction
[1:20:43] for instruction in righteousness why
[1:20:46] there's a purpose that the man of god
[1:20:49] may be perfect
[1:20:50] we want perfection thoroughly furnished
[1:20:53] unto all good works
[1:20:55] so we don't want to take things for
[1:20:56] granted we don't want
[1:20:58] when the exam come we didn't know this
[1:21:00] answer we didn't think this was on the
[1:21:02] book we didn't know we want to ensure
[1:21:04] that we keep the main thing remaining no
[1:21:07] compromise with that
[1:21:08] but we want to spend quality time in the
[1:21:11] world
[1:21:11] so that this becomes our source this
[1:21:14] becomes our reference point
[1:21:16] where the brahman said i don't if you
[1:21:17] you remember i think you gave the story
[1:21:19] of this
[1:21:19] supposed to came out to pray and he said
[1:21:20] he could have see it was a pretty person
[1:21:22] he was a prayer
[1:21:24] or warrior he could see the parade
[1:21:28] so it comes out of your life if you pray
[1:21:30] it comes out of your life
[1:21:32] if scripture and the word is your source
[1:21:36] it troubles me when people know more
[1:21:38] about
[1:21:39] politicians and more about geography and
[1:21:42] geology and all these things and i don't
[1:21:43] know
[1:21:44] that you can find geography and geology
[1:21:46] and chemistry and biology and
[1:21:47] philanthropics all in scripture
[1:21:50] and if you get this right it'll change
[1:21:52] your life it'll change your work it'll
[1:21:54] change your talk
[1:21:54] can the church say amen
[1:21:58] i'm gonna wrap up here we on the home
[1:21:59] stretch
[1:22:01] i charge thee therefore before god and
[1:22:04] the lord jesus christ
[1:22:05] who shall judge the quick and the dead
[1:22:07] at his appearing and his kingdom
[1:22:09] preached a word
[1:22:12] so this is i take a minister myself and
[1:22:14] i'm challenging you with this with your
[1:22:15] life preach you would
[1:22:16] be instant in season out of season
[1:22:20] reprove rebuke exhorted all long
[1:22:24] suffering and doctrine
[1:22:26] so when are tired you still have to do
[1:22:28] it when you don't feel like doing it
[1:22:30] it's let you do it because it's a
[1:22:31] responsibility
[1:22:32] for the time will come when and we in
[1:22:35] that time now
[1:22:36] when they will not endure sound doctrine
[1:22:39] what is sound doctrine
[1:22:41] when something is sound it means it can
[1:22:43] be defended
[1:22:44] it means it is properly established i
[1:22:47] have heard people use scriptures and
[1:22:48] connect scriptures
[1:22:49] that cannot be connected
[1:22:53] you realize it new schema cannot be
[1:22:57] connected
[1:23:00] misappropriate scripture and because
[1:23:02] they want to run with one's quote or one
[1:23:04] word
[1:23:06] for something to be sound it has to line
[1:23:08] up
[1:23:10] but a time will come when they will not
[1:23:12] endure sound doctrine
[1:23:14] but after their own lusts and that's the
[1:23:16] problem
[1:23:18] after their own desires after their own
[1:23:20] interests
[1:23:21] after what they would like to happen and
[1:23:23] the way they wanted to happen and
[1:23:25] the way they were seeing it and how they
[1:23:27] would like it to unfold
[1:23:30] shall he shall they heap to themselves
[1:23:33] teachers
[1:23:33] having itching ears and they shall turn
[1:23:37] away
[1:23:38] their ears from the truth and shall be
[1:23:41] turned
[1:23:42] into fables these are the community last
[1:23:45] words
[1:23:46] that paul is speaking so paul is
[1:23:49] speaking out the greatest warnings
[1:23:51] to timothy on the eve of his departure
[1:23:55] so if you want to give more weight to
[1:23:57] the words as they come down
[1:23:58] this is it preach the word be instant in
[1:24:01] season
[1:24:02] out of season lockdown no lockdown
[1:24:05] churches can meet do it and zoom
[1:24:07] whatever you have to do
[1:24:08] reprove rebuke exhort with all long long
[1:24:12] suffering say it over and over again the
[1:24:15] book of accent and with many other words
[1:24:17] did they many other words they found
[1:24:19] other ways to say it
[1:24:20] because they want to get the message
[1:24:21] home that you're going to make it that
[1:24:24] you have to make it that you have to
[1:24:25] separate yourself
[1:24:26] and you have to do things differently
[1:24:27] but you have to sell out
[1:24:31] surrender all with all long-suffering
[1:24:35] and doctrine so you understand the
[1:24:37] foundation of your belief
[1:24:39] because if you don't people could blow
[1:24:41] you away but if you understand and you
[1:24:43] know why you do what you do what is the
[1:24:45] purpose then nobody can move you
[1:24:48] for the time will come when they will
[1:24:49] not endure sound doctrine
[1:24:51] but after their own lust shall be heaped
[1:24:54] to themselves teachers
[1:24:55] having itching ears they want to hear
[1:24:57] something new something nice
[1:24:58] they they their other twinkling story
[1:25:01] tell me that a little different
[1:25:03] i never hear that before oh we know
[1:25:05] nobody ever said it
[1:25:06] the prophet never said that they shall
[1:25:12] turn
[1:25:12] away their heirs from the truth and
[1:25:14] shall be turned into fables
[1:25:16] but watch dow in all things endure
[1:25:18] affliction
[1:25:19] affliction do the work of an evangelist
[1:25:22] and make full proof of that ministry
[1:25:24] and we're going to end with these last
[1:25:26] three verses and we're done tonight
[1:25:29] for i am not ready to be offered
[1:25:32] so this is the context now showing this
[1:25:36] is
[1:25:36] he's wrapping up his ministry here the
[1:25:38] time of my departure is at hand
[1:25:41] i have fought a good fight hallelujah
[1:25:44] i have finished my course it is
[1:25:47] something powerful
[1:25:48] when you know you finish your mission i
[1:25:50] have finished my course
[1:25:52] i have kept defeat henceforth is laid up
[1:25:56] for me
[1:25:56] he is speaking knowing knowing what his
[1:25:59] position was
[1:26:00] there was no doubt in his mind
[1:26:02] henceforth has laid up for me
[1:26:04] a crown of righteousness which the lord
[1:26:07] the righteous judge
[1:26:08] shall give me at that day and not to me
[1:26:11] only but unto all them
[1:26:14] also that love his appearing may the
[1:26:17] lord have a blessing to the reading of
[1:26:18] his word
[1:26:18] and we said it last week but the branham
[1:26:21] was comforted
[1:26:22] by that statement i've preached what
[1:26:25] paul preached
[1:26:26] so i want to challenge the church
[1:26:27] tonight as we bring this study of
[1:26:30] timothy to a close
[1:26:32] and we will see what the lord will will
[1:26:34] take us through that
[1:26:35] you continue to study the word continue
[1:26:38] to
[1:26:38] make the scriptures a joy make the
[1:26:41] scriptures
[1:26:42] a place of refuge when they have
[1:26:44] questions go into the scripture
[1:26:45] you might actually see something unfold
[1:26:47] you'll say wait a minute what i'm going
[1:26:48] through is right here
[1:26:50] because there's nothing new under the
[1:26:51] sun that scripture also
[1:26:53] so what you are going through somebody
[1:26:54] else has already gone through
[1:26:56] what you are going through somebody has
[1:26:57] already went through that so i want to
[1:26:59] encourage you to
[1:27:00] keep your head up stay in courage let's
[1:27:02] just bow our heads for our word of
[1:27:03] prayer
[1:27:05] our heavenly father we thank you tonight
[1:27:08] lord for this
[1:27:09] little study around the scripture not uh
[1:27:12] a great explosion of mystery and
[1:27:16] and and trying to to to to bring our
[1:27:18] weight on the people
[1:27:20] lord but uh to take the scriptures and
[1:27:23] just breathe some some life in it that
[1:27:25] you could walk on the pieces of the
[1:27:26] bible and
[1:27:27] lord as a humble bunch of believers we
[1:27:30] can understand how each piece
[1:27:32] of the puzzle fits into this plan of
[1:27:35] redemption
[1:27:37] law that you saw before the world even
[1:27:39] began
[1:27:40] how in your great divine mystery lord
[1:27:43] you were unfold from
[1:27:45] eternity through time to back to
[1:27:47] eternity
[1:27:48] and to close out this great race lord
[1:27:51] you would have a bright elect an elect
[1:27:53] lady
[1:27:54] a lady about to come into power and how
[1:27:56] the enemy would try to distract
[1:27:59] and try to deter and try to to bring all
[1:28:02] kinds of opposition
[1:28:04] but lord in the midst of it all we could
[1:28:06] find ourselves
[1:28:07] lord under the canopy of life around
[1:28:10] your word and we could only look into
[1:28:12] the scripture this way
[1:28:13] lord because of your grace send us a
[1:28:15] prophet lord a prophet who would
[1:28:17] lord go into the mind of god and see
[1:28:20] lord the things you would want us to see
[1:28:22] in such a time as
[1:28:23] this lord to see the plainness of god
[1:28:26] and
[1:28:26] lord who you are your nature your being
[1:28:29] your attributes and what we are to
[1:28:30] become
[1:28:31] so father may you bless your sons and
[1:28:33] your daughters lord as we continue to
[1:28:35] strive
[1:28:36] lord to get into that place to our
[1:28:38] position lord to be placed in christ
[1:28:40] lord
[1:28:41] even adoption lord where you could say
[1:28:43] there's my spirit
[1:28:45] flowing freely where lord is not us
[1:28:47] identified with the message but the
[1:28:49] message
[1:28:50] identifying with us not us identifying
[1:28:52] with you but you identify with us so
[1:28:54] lord we long for the day when he could
[1:28:56] place that seal of approval
[1:28:58] lord and sons and daughters who have
[1:29:00] died out died out to their ideas to
[1:29:03] their emotions and their feelings to
[1:29:05] what they were like and
[1:29:07] they have yielded completely to the mind
[1:29:09] of christ so may you
[1:29:10] break every chain that may be holding
[1:29:12] your people back if there's anyone sick
[1:29:14] tonight
[1:29:15] lord god may you heal and may you touch
[1:29:17] if there's anyone going through anxiety
[1:29:19] tonight
[1:29:20] may you lift the anxiety the nervousness
[1:29:22] the tension
[1:29:24] the prophet preacher message letting all
[1:29:25] the pressure lord may we let all of the
[1:29:28] pressure tonight
