Christ amen you turn in your Bible to Luke the 24th chapter and also Romans the 8th chapter also Luke 24 Romans 8th chapter everybody glad to be here this morning amen can be no better place to be the house of the Lord to worship him and give him the praise and the glory and honor that's due to his name Luke 24:36 I wish to read this story here of Easter and as they thus spake Jesus himself stood in the midst of them and said unto them peace be unto you but they were terrified and AF frighted and supposed that they had seen a spirit and he said unto them why are you troubled and why do thoughts arise in your heart behold my hands and my feet that it is I myself Hallelujah hle me and see for Spirit had not Flesh and Bones as they see me have amen and when he had thus spoken he showed them his hands and his feet and while they yet beli not for joy and wondered he said unto them have you here any meat and they gave him a piece of a broiled fish and of a honeycomb hallelu and he took it and did it before them and he said unto them these are the words which are spoken to you while I was yet with you that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the law of Moses and in the prophets and in the Psalms concerning me amen then open he their understanding that they might understand the scriptures and he said unto them thus it is written and thus it behold Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day and that repentance and Commission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations beginning at Jerusalem and he Witnesses of these things and behold I send the promise of my father upon you but carry in the city of Jerusalem until ye be endured with power from on high and he led them out as far as to Bethany and he lifted up his hands and blessed them and it came to pass while he blessed them he was parted from them and carried up into heaven and they worship Him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy and were continually in the temple praising and blessing God amen amen Amen in Romans the 8th chapter verses 10 and 11 and if Christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness can we say Amen but if the spirit of him that raise up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raise up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you amen and one more scripture in Revelation chapter 1 verse 17 and 18 and when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not I am the first and the last I am he that liveth and was dead and behold whole I am alive forever more amen and have the keys of hell and debt amen what a scripture that that is this morning amen well can we just bow our heads and we want to

the the time and the age in which we are living to the people which you already know I know your minister here preached many things to you amen so it's a kind of a difficult for a man to come behind him to say something amen but I'm I'm sure then that you know that the age in which we are living is an abrahamic [Applause] age amen did you ever hear the prophet say this is an abrahamic age it's a age like Abraham like Abraham time amen no history have a way of repeating itself so we are living in an abrahamic age we also are in a wheat age amen the age of the wheat wheat age we also is in a Harvest Time [Music] hallelujah praise God amen amen this age is also called a bride [Applause] an abrahamic age a wheat age a Harvest Time a bright age a Rapture in time how many believe this is

and amen so we thank the Lord to be here in this Easter morning again I just want to read something here I can't help reading this you you couldn't have a Easter Service without reading this little this little quote it's a simp simple little quote now here from the message uh from the rising of the sun it's Sunrise amen oh praise the name of the Lord now here's what the prophet said now there's just a little quote inside here now the Sun at the rising of the sun there was a time when the world was laying in utter Darkness yes it was without form and was void and with is all covered with water and was laying there in the dark dismal gloomy atmosphere and the spirit of God moved upon that water and God said let there be light amen now God had a reason to do that everything that God does is a reason so he had a reason to do that for down beneath that water yes there were seeds that he planted and it had to have that sunlight to make it live oh praise God oh I love that amen seeds that God had planted it had to have the sunlight to make it live and the first light was ever given in the Earth was God's spoken word the first light that ever struck the Earth the the Earth was God spoken word God said let there be light and there was light and that turned Darkness into light in order to bring forth a creation of joy and life upon the earth now now now understand please that that was the first sunlight that was the first time the sun rose upon the Earth amen amen amen but oh it wasn't nothing look he's comparing the sunlight there oh it wasn't nothing that Sunrise like the sunrise on that first Easter [Applause] morning what a comparison here he's comparing the sunrise the first time it Rose upon the Earth to the sunrise on Easter morning oh so there must be something special about Easter morning can we say praise the name of the Lord hallelujah amen oh praise the name of the Lord it wasn't nothing that Sunrise like the sunrise on Easter morning this time that's Easter morning when the sun leaping into the sky it brought forth a greater Sunrise than ever because it came greater news with that Sunrise than it did with the sunrise at the beginning this sunrise in Easter brought a news that he is [Applause] risen Hallelujah it brought the news that he is risen and he is quickened from the as he promised he's risen from the dead so the first time the sun rose in Genesis it was bringing a message that there will be life upon the Earth amen mortal life but this time when the sun rose there was a dual sunrising another sunrising it was not only Sun Su n Rising was s o n Rising amen not s amen s n is greater than s o s o n is greater than S N because s o n make s n can we say praise the name of the Lord is a greater Sunrise let's give the Lord a

praise the name of the Lord notice now now no more could the botony life live back there at the beginning without the Su son to bring it to life no more than today when sons of God is upon the Earth it takes the s o n light to bring them to eternal life his chosen ones that he knew before the found of the world he had chosen them listen in himself before the foundation of the world that is not now that is way back there can we say Amen praise the name of the Lord and on Easter morning then praise Lord in this dirt somewhere laid our bodies at that time yes I wasn't even born yet but my body

right for you yes sir amen amen another thing I want to say is look at Thomas you see all of them was Believers you know all of them were Believers but they didn't have a true Easter yet they were only getting infallible proofs of his resurrection but they themselves didn't have a Easter oh praise God I hope you see what I'm pointing out this morning and Thomas wouldn't believe he said I would

said my Lord and my [Applause] godall amen see see the Lord had to do that to give them proof of his resurrection and and look at Simon Peter here when he come to Peter amen and hear this now I got this from a brother a young brother was preaching by us and he made this nice remark and I love it so much when he come to Simon Peter amen amen and he's going to get Peter his commission and everything what he should do amen am and when and and turn in your bible let me read it first turn in the Bible here in the Book of John amen all right now watch this here now praise the name of the Lord verse 14 of of St John 21 when you have it say amen I want to read it first because I think when you read it you don't miss a word St John 21 verse4 this is now the third time that Jesus shed himself to his disciples after that he was risen from the dead can we say Amen a after he was risen from the dead he's now given the disciples proof of his Resurrection so when they had Den D Jesus said to Simon Peter Simon son of Jonah L us thou thee thou me more than these he said unto him y Lord thou knowest that I love thee he said unto him feed my Lambs he said to him again the second time Simon son of Jonah lovest thou me he said unto him ye Lord thou knowest that I love thee he said unto him feed my sheep he said unto him the third time Simon son of Jonah lovest th me Peter was grieve because he said unto him the third time lovest thou me and he said unto him Lord thou knowest all things th knowest I love thee Jesus said unto him feed my sheep amen amen friends now if you notice now he come to to Peter this after the resurrection and he asked Peter if you love him yes he said yeah Lord you know I love you he come again he said Simon lest th me he asked him a second time he say yeah Lord and I love you then he ask him a third time and here the brother said you know why he asked him a third time because he deny him three [Applause] times he deny him three times and he make him confess three time can we say praise the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah let's say praise the Lord amen oh my at the crucifixion he deny Peter deny three times you know and the third time Peter cursed while doing it fisherman [Applause] language and because he deny him three time he come back and make him confess him three time that he love him oh praise the name of the Lord oh glory be to God Amen and amen Oh Praise His wonderful name so the Lord was given them proof of his resurrection there so many times when he come on the seashore when them Simon and them went back fishing he me say children have you any have you any fish you caught any fish they said no Lord we didn't catch none he amen he called them to show and when they come to show he had fish they frying and everything [Applause] them all of that was a lot of proof of his resurrection am amen and amen all right but the church was in a ashib condition they did not know that he was risen from the dead but he had to come and give them some proof amen friend amen and that was on the first Easter bre yes and Easter is the resurrection but what I'm driving to you here this morning they did not have an Easter in them it is only when you have an Easter in you that that that Easter can be made real to you amen when you have the Easter in you sir it become as real as when Mary magdalina and them had it in can we say amen and the only time the Easter come become Easter become real to them the resurrection become to them is when they got it in them can we say Amen so what he did he sent them to [Applause] Pentecost he said behold I send the promise of my father upon you but go up to Jerusalem yes sir and wait amen until this Easter come to you until you be enjoyed with power from on high amen until you be enjoyed with resurrection power amen hallelujah friend it's when resurrection power come into you then you guarantee you're going in that Rapture can we say amen hallelujah and it come by the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen then is when you are short that you're going to hit that Rapture amen that is what we want this morning a Easter in every believer amen Easter made real to the Believers amen oh praise God hallelujah you believe it friend amen that is what I'm preaching about here this morning that what the Lord put on my heart that the Believers have an in them and Easter would become as real as Peter and them had it it will mean more than just a memorial service Easter is the resurrection and the resurrection power in you can we say Amen short to get you in that Rapture there hallelujah amen because listen to this now amen Jesus send them to to Pentecost he sent them to Jerusalem to wait for that resurrection [Applause] power so I read Romans 8 it sa of the spirit brother say if if the spirit that rais up Christ from the dead if it dwelleth in you if it dwelleth in you if it dwell it in me here what it's going to do Quicken your mortal bodies can we say praise the name of the Lord it will Quicken your mortal bodies Hall Oh Glory to God amen amen oh praise the Lord the Lord just give me this God in his uh this morning I get this God in his great wisdom is Mindful and is he cares for and is concerned about these mortal bodies we [Applause] have don't just condemn it all the time and says a pest house is a this it it is it is it is a pest house amen this house we living in is a pest house it's full of corruption it full of evils and everything is that right friend but God is concerned about it [Applause] too if he wasn't concerned about it amen he wouldn't have that scripture you wouldn't have the scripture that say if the spirit that raise up Christ dwell in you it will Quicken your mortal bodies why you so concerned about these [Applause] bodies these bodies are full of sickness full of pain full of suffering full of evil but God is concerned about it amen he's concerned so much that he maketh his [Applause] temples know you not that your body is the Temple of the Living God can we say amen and that God dwelleth in them temples can we say amen God is concerned when the Holy Spirit just Quicken that thing to me God is concerned over mortal bodies even though it's born in sin and shaping iniquity oh amen friend amen but he's so concerned about it that he wants to bring it subjection to his word am and the only way he could bring it and make it subjection to his word is put the spirit in [Applause] it when you put a spirit in it the spirit of God throws this body in subjection to the word of God do you believe that say Amen because you know that this body in our flesh and what not we are rebellious is that right am amen Even in our nature our nature is contrary to God word can we say amen and we rebellious we stubborn and all sort of a thing we full of greed we full agreed and everything is like that in this bodies so his concern is to bring these mortal bodies yes sir Amen in subjection to his word and the only way he could do that is to send his spirit in it this body can never obey that word without the spirit can we say Amen it can never come in subjection without the spirit amen but when the spirit inhabit this body it shows it in subjection to the [Applause] world it Quicken it amen and amen amen friends oh blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah yes sir this body is What I Call Flesh man oh friends let me say something here this flesh man is no good this flesh man is a corrupt [Applause] man this flesh man is a backsliding man is that right friend oh let's let's get a picture of man here just for a little moment before I go on and listen close to what I'm going to say amen amen let's get a picture of when God make man from the beginning am amen and when God made man the Bible say he make him in his own image that was not flesh [Applause] man not this not this this is in the image of animal amen Abraham said take the Holy Spirit away from a man he will take a little baby out of a mother hand and ravish her for beastly lust that that's is how Wicked This flesh man [Applause] is amen everybody following me so listen to this in Genesis the Bible says God make man in his own image he said let us make man in our own image Genesis 1:26 and when he make that man was not a flesh man that's right that's right it was a spirit man everybody agree say Amen but the scripture went on to say there was not a man to till the soil so how come you make a man in His image and no man to tell the soil that's right amen friend amen so what God did he formed man body from the dust of the ground is that right friend amen and he breathed in him the bread of life man become a living soul is that right all right so you see there's two scriptures there in Genesis in in Book of Genesis Genesis 1 126 and Genesis 2:7 yeah and so they ask the prophet a question they said brother Braham what is the difference between the man in Genesis 126 and the man in Genesis 2:7 what is the difference between these men amen here the prophet answer he said the second man in Genesis 2:7 is the first man in Genesis 1 126 manifests in five senses [Applause] amen the second man to till the soil was the first man that was manifested in five senses can we say amen amen you put him in five senses now that he can see tast feel smelling [Applause] here but it's the same man it's the same man it ain't no different man amen friend well look and throughout the scripture scripture does reveal scripture and we go to the scripture where a man named [Applause] MDC came to Abraham how many remember that say amen amen amen friend Abraham called him a man yes sir and when Paul writing in Hebrews 7 Paul said consider how great this man was talking about said consider how great this man was to whom Abraham gave the tent of all the spies is that right friend but this man appeared to Abraham in the form of a theophany how many understand that say amen I know your pastor preaching so I can mention it and in the form of a did this man melc he was a man you know but in a different form is that man is that true no but the question is mesc was mentioned down there in Genesis 14 yes sir and after that he disappear yes and you never hear nothing throughout the Bible about mzc again he never was mentioned again from that time until Paul speak of him in Hebrews 7 am are you fallowing friend well the question is what happened to mzc what happened to this man he just come to Abraham brought him Bread and Wine serve him communion and then disappear what happened to him yeah what brother Bram says MDC become Jesus Christ Oh Praise Hallelujah let's say praise the Lord mzc become Jesus Christ is the same man is the same man now in five senses is the same man now in flesh can we say amen hallelujah I say hallelujah glory to God in the highest is the same man in flesh praise the name of the Lord this MDC king of s yeah king of Peace king of righteousness King of [Applause] Kings hallelujah amen friends yes sir but let's take this this this man here this flesh man and that was Adam Adam never sinned in the spirit no no no when Adam sin he sin in the flesh amen right in the flesh is where we all have our trouble [Applause] amen and amen amen somebody in the flesh flesh man is where we have all the trouble amen and flesh man fell from God yes sir how could this man Adam in such high order yeah how can he fall he wasn't deceived his wife was deceived but what the prophet reveal here in the seals he said Adam turn loose the word of [Applause] God Amen and when he turned loose the word of God he was separated from God and when a man is separated from God he [Applause] backslid amen and amen amen amen Adam was separated from God Amen he fell from what did he fall from the word he fell from the word of God he turned loose the word amen amen and man sinned In the Flesh not in the spirit amen and then he become something like a Wanderer amen now he's away from God what's something here Adam Fell From aapo Love yes sir anytime you fall from God you fall away from that love can we say amen amen then we find him going after his wife amen we find him going after his wife what kind of a love that he had there amen amen he the love for that a man have for his wife yes sir he went after wife and he followed her is that right but you see he had no redeeming power in him to bring her back oh praise the name of the Lord amen and amen no man is a way from God and here are some things about this man here yes sir that we think he's so nice amen yes he follow from God yes he become backslid man this is man all down Through the Ages eh sir you can't trust Man In the Flesh did not the scripture tell you put no confidence in [Applause] flesh amen look at things in the scripture here how man become when they when they fall away from God Amen and amen now there's the first Adam are talking about and he fall away from God what how man become he become deceitful yes sir very much amen I'm taking things from the scripture he become they become traitors they become he they become highminded they become greedy can we say Amen they become Hypocrites evil men seducers amen is that right friend all kind of a things man become sir and every imagination of the thoughts of the heart is evil continually that that's that's the bad state that man become in when they away from God they can do anything didn't know the scripture say a backslider is perverse in all his ways he perverse in all his ways he can't do nothing right because he what he have is his own thinking that's right he doesn't have the Mind Of [Music] God it's the mind of God that makes you thinking [Applause] right that's why the scripture say we should have the mind of Christ let this mind be in you brother say we have no right to our own thinking but let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus Oh Lord hallah and God mind is God word amen amen hallelujah but we can see from our fallen nature amen we are Fallen we in a negative here but we are reflecting something in a a positive yes sir now brother if you want to be hon us on this Easter morning look at ourselves we can see in our fallen nature amen friend that we are no good even though we are Christians sometime your thoughts you're thinking that be so you have to pull back yourself and say now wait no I shouldn't think [Applause] so this this this thing here no good [Applause] amen I going to read something here for you look at this qu quotation here all right just let me read it make you understanding a little better amen do you love him this morning do you hate brother [Laughter] [Music] won what brother say now this is the fall he said that's the reason that God does does nothing outside of man watch this he always works through a man because God he had to use a man yes sir a man is what he had to use to display his attributes of Savior died the first Adam in the beginning he had to use this man to display his attribute of savior he had to make him in his image and make him something like him and put him on free moral agency and let him act any way he wanted to now he could take so that he could take his choice yeah but he knew that man by giving him his choice would fall yeah that's right see this is this whole Plan of Redemption is not by guest he know by putting Adam in five senses and putting him on free moral agency and giving him a choice he would fall God knew he would fall yes sir and let me say this even though you're a Christian God when he choose you knew everything that you would do he knew everything that you would do he knew that by putting Adam in that state condition and given him his choice that he would fall so being that he had to do that God had to do that he turn back around and make man a partner to him and does nothing except he does it through man so the whole work of redemption come by man and the prophet shout hallelujah hallelujah death come by the first man life come by the second Adam can we say amen and God does nothing because he had to use a man for that then he used a man to redeem back again praise the name of the Lord oh that's beautiful to me that unfold the whole Plan of Redemption that God had to use a man in the beginning and because he had to use a man so them attributes can be brought out then he turn around and make man a partner with him in the Plan of [Applause] Redemption do I come to preach this morning with that [Applause] understanding he takes man brother Terry yes sir and make man a partner with him Amen in the Plan of Redemption amen and that that is such a great thing amen that hear what he say in his word it pleased God to save Man by the preaching of the gospel and he choose man to preach it praise God hallelujah amen so we are right in the plan of God here this morning is that right now I'm going to say some beautiful things and try to close off quickly before the

that's a long time all right let me close now so here friend this man here how God is so concerned of our mortal bodies that even though he know man would sin he turn around and make man a partner with him in these mortal bodies in these sinful bodies still make us a partner with him is that right friend amen so in the wisdom of God is concern for Mortal bodies amen but the way that he would bring The Mortals bodies in subjection is put his spirit in them that's why Romans 8 says if the spirit that raise Christ from the dead dwell in you it Quicken your mortal bodies is that right all right and listen now flesh man sin all down Through the Ages amen all the way from Adam watch how he's going to bring this flesh man this Mortal man again that when the second Adam arve second Adam arriv amen friend the second Adam come preaching his first Doctrine was the New [Applause] Birth oh all down through the new Old Testament the new birth was not preached come on I make you [Applause] think they never preach the new birth all down through the Old Testament amen friend but what happened to man when he sinned In the Flesh God had a propitiation for himself God make a way for him that he would sacrifice a lamb a substitute sacrifice that he would offer for his sins but the new birth wasn't preached it is when the second Adam come he preached the new birth and he said a man know flesh man you must be born again but you can't enter there's two things that Jesus the second Adam did for us that's why I say we benefici of his resurrection he give us a new birth he offer us a new birth yes sir and then he invite us yes sir to be partakers of his divine [Applause] nature amen you offer us a new birth and then invite us to be partakers of his divine nature now here let me close

from from the people knowing it here's you and I my brother flesh men amen God don't look God is concerned about your mortal [Applause] body amen so concerned that he send his Spirit to Quicken it to Quicken you to the word Quicken the word to you amen friend to let you know that you are raised up amen and amen you hear our sister sing the song when he was on the cross we was in his [Applause] mind amen because you see when he was on the cross the bride wasn't separated from the groom yet oh praise the name of the Lorden but Jesus offer us the new birth and then invite us to be partakers of his Divine haa now here's something now get this everybody give the undivided attention God know that when we come here he know everything he's infinite he know that when he allow us to come here after the fall amen make a New Covenant and we come by sex can we say Amen am God know that we was coming here without a [Applause] theophany my brother and my sister we bypass we come here in the

fleshman bypasses theophany amen friends oh praise the name of the Lord hallelujah but yet even though we bypass is still how highly God think of us yes even though we bypass with theophany then he promised to take us to adoption I know you're Pastor preach that adoption we are going to adoption can we say Amen flesh man is going to this adoption is that right friend oh praise the Lord but flesh man in himself can't go to adoption by himself so Romans 8 say he give us the spirit of [Applause] adoption hallelujah amen we couldn't go by ourself this can't make it can we say Amen but he has

adoption without a theophany this flesh man we don't need the theophany to go to adoption that's the mystery God's going to do such a great thing with this flesh man that the spirit is taking us to adoption without a theophany because that God know we come in here without a theophany amen he and leave flesh man so that is why he promised the baptism of the Holy Ghost the baptism of the Holy
