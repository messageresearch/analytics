[20:18] to turn to Matthew chapter
[20:20] 15 want to read from verse 21- 28 also
[20:24] Romans chapter 4 verse 19- 21
[20:29] welcome this
[20:30] evening praise God to you here and those
[20:34] connected life to us we say
[20:36] welcome reading from Matthew chapter 15
[20:40] reading verse 21 then
[20:44] Jesus went then and departed unto the
[20:47] coast of Thai and sidon and behold a
[20:50] woman of Canaan came out of the same
[20:53] coast and cried un him saying have mercy
[20:55] on me oh Lord thou son of David my
[20:58] daughter is grously vexed with the
[21:01] devil but he answered another word and
[21:04] his disciples came and besought him
[21:06] saying send her away for she crith after
[21:09] us and he answered and said I am not
[21:12] sent but unto the L sheep of the House
[21:15] of
[21:16] Israel then came she and worshiped him
[21:19] saying Lord help me but he answered and
[21:23] said it is not meat to take the ch's
[21:26] bread and cast it to dogs
[21:29] and she said truth Lord yet the dogs eat
[21:33] of the crumbs which fall from their
[21:36] master's table then Jesus answered and
[21:39] said unto her oh woman great is thy
[21:42] faith be it unto thee even as thou Wilt
[21:46] and a daughter was made whole from that
[21:50] very hour and reading from Romans chter
[21:54] 4 I want to read from verse 19 to 20 1
[21:59] speaking about Abraham and being not
[22:01] weak in faith he considered not his own
[22:03] body now dead when he was about a 100
[22:06] years old nearing yet the deadness of
[22:09] Sarah's womb he staggered not at the
[22:12] promise of God through unbelief but was
[22:15] strong in faith giving glory to God and
[22:18] being fully persuaded that what he had
[22:21] promised he was able also to perform
[22:24] let's pray father we thank you for your
[22:27] holy word and and what consolation we
[22:29] have in the scriptures even Jesus had
[22:33] full confidence in the scriptures that
[22:36] he said destroy this body and trees I'll
[22:38] raise it up because of David's word I
[22:41] shall not suffer my Holy One to see
[22:43] corruption or leave his soul in Hell
[22:45] father help us this night this evening
[22:48] that we can have such full confidence
[22:49] and faith in your word that's it knowing
[22:51] that your word can fail amen heaven will
[22:54] pass away but your word will never pass
[22:55] away we thank you for the Blessed
[22:57] assurance that your word is true that
[23:00] your word is you that your word is real
[23:02] confirm your word this evening in Jesus
[23:05] name I ask it amen and amen you may be
[23:07] seated oh praise the name of the Lord
[23:10] for title this evening be perseverant
[23:14] for your promise of Dynamics that's the
[23:17] title this evening be perseverant for
[23:19] your promise of
[23:21] Dynamics and I have an inspiration from
[23:23] a quote uh from brother Brandon message
[23:26] perseverance you said what we need to
[23:28] today is a man and a woman who will take
[23:32] God by his word and be persistent with
[23:35] it that's what we need a man or woman
[23:38] that will take God by his word and be
[23:41] persistent with it perseverance the
[23:45] quality that allows someone to continue
[23:49] trying to do something even though it is
[23:53] difficult perseverant able or willing to
[23:57] persevere
[23:59] and I want to bring something from this
[24:01] message called perseverance and brother
[24:03] B was trying to bring an atmosphere of
[24:05] Faith to the people and he said
[24:07] perseverance means to be persistent to
[24:10] make a goal faith is the substance of
[24:12] things hoped for the evidence of Things
[24:14] Not Seen we have a body like a seed a
[24:17] seed on the outside has a shell inside
[24:19] the shell has a crust or a pulp and had
[24:22] a germ that's the where we are Body Soul
[24:25] Spirit and the body has five senses say
[24:28] see smell here to the soul uh so forth
[24:32] the inside one Avenue that Avenue is the
[24:34] place that God set every man from Adam
[24:37] and Eve self-will you will to live or
[24:41] you will to die either one you want to
[24:44] it is based on free moral agency and
[24:48] whatever Spirit listen that you let
[24:51] dominate you will bring forth the fruits
[24:54] your life will be dominated by the
[24:57] inside
[24:59] so regardless of what people say your
[25:02] life is dominated by what is on the
[25:05] inside of you so if you let Faith
[25:08] dominate your life it will reflect on
[25:10] the outside if you let doubt dominate
[25:13] your life it will also reflect on the
[25:14] outside so many people rely on these
[25:17] outside senses they're fine nothing
[25:18] against them if they agree with the six
[25:21] sense this Spirit can be only two kinds
[25:24] one is the spirit of God the other is
[25:26] the spirit of the devil amen you can't
[25:29] serve two masters at the same time you
[25:32] either give one or you give the other so
[25:33] if you got a spirit of God in you you've
[25:35] got faith and you believe every word
[25:37] that God said now the devil is not like
[25:39] some people think he's mean and
[25:41] everything but he's deceitful the devil
[25:43] make you think you're right and when you
[25:45] disagree with the word that shows that
[25:47] it isn't the spirit of God because the
[25:49] Holy Spirit wrote the Bible there's got
[25:51] to be agreable with the word isn't that
[25:54] right so you can't hunt for wisdom you
[25:56] have to stay with the word to to
[25:59] persevere to be persistent is to make a
[26:01] goal you've got to set your mind on
[26:03] something you got to be persistent in it
[26:06] because you believe is the thing that
[26:07] you want you believe you can get it
[26:10] Hallelujah is Dynamics the thing you
[26:12] want amen do you believe you can get it
[26:14] yeah praise God now watch you've got to
[26:17] in your mind made up of what you're
[26:19] going to do now you cannot have faith in
[26:22] God without knowing the word of God or
[26:24] knowing something about God isn't that
[26:26] right blessed be the name of the Lord
[26:28] Christ when he was on Earth was the body
[26:30] of God God created this body isn't that
[26:34] right Solomon built him a house how be
[26:36] the most high don't dwell in houses May
[26:38] hands but a body has th prepared me now
[26:40] God prepared himself a body in the form
[26:43] of the Lord Jesus which was the Christ
[26:45] meaning the anointed one now all that
[26:47] was in God he poured into Christ he was
[26:49] the fullness of the godhead bodily and
[26:52] all of his Christ he poured into the
[26:53] church what is it anointed one to
[26:56] continue his work
[26:58] so Christ work must be continued to a
[27:02] body a bright body this time his body
[27:05] hallelu Hallelujah so in other words you
[27:07] become Ms Jesus Christ by coming into
[27:10] his body and you become God's mechanic
[27:13] on the earth isn't that right Hallelujah
[27:15] you believe that now God can't change if
[27:19] God made a decision it has to remain
[27:20] that way if he changes then he's human
[27:23] like I am he's just a man that can make
[27:26] a mistake but he's infinite and he's
[27:28] omnipotent he cannot make a mistake and
[27:31] be God so his first decision when man
[27:34] sin he forgive him on the basis of
[27:36] believ in the word the second man come
[27:38] he's got to act the same way isn't that
[27:40] right you have got to have faith in what
[27:43] you're doing amen and if your heart
[27:45] condemn us not then we have faith isn't
[27:48] that right now you cannot get yourself
[27:52] together because you know there's things
[27:55] there that God teaches that you will not
[27:56] cope with so if your life is not coping
[27:59] with the word you have a problem to get
[28:01] Faith to receive what God say because
[28:03] your heart sits there condemned but once
[28:06] your life begin to cope with the word
[28:09] every promise is yeah every promise is
[28:11] true every promise is amen there is no
[28:14] condemnation in your heart as a Believer
[28:17] you have access to your father isn't
[28:19] that right do you believe that so
[28:22] therefore you can't come up here and
[28:23] said I want to be healed and last night
[28:25] I was drunk out there Lord Heal me this
[28:27] morning I won't drink doing too much
[28:28] more you have got to surrender yourself
[28:31] you got to give yourself completely to
[28:32] God you have got to obey the word still
[28:36] completely when God speaks to a man here
[28:39] we go he has
[28:41] ambition and he has purpose and that is
[28:45] why you have to hear from
[28:47] God and that is why people follow people
[28:50] because they're not hearing from God so
[28:52] they trust the people that they
[28:53] following that they hear from God but
[28:56] they themselves don't hear themselves
[28:58] and that's why Jesus asks his disciples
[29:00] who do men say I am then he ask who do
[29:02] you say I am and Peter said th are the
[29:05] Christ Peter heard direct from
[29:07] Heaven oh Hallelujah he didn't ask James
[29:12] and anybody else he said D the Christ
[29:15] the son of the Living God he could
[29:16] pronounce his confession because he got
[29:18] a revelation once you get a revelation
[29:21] you can confess it but it got to be
[29:23] according to the word God only reveal
[29:26] his word oh oh blessed be the name of
[29:29] the Lord so when God speaks to a man he
[29:32] gives him Faith that's why amam and
[29:34] Joseph didn't hide Moses under the bed
[29:38] they take that baby and put him to sail
[29:40] right right in the midst of alligators
[29:42] they put him to sail into the AMS of
[29:44] pharaoh why because when God speaks to a
[29:46] man he has faith not fear he has Faith
[29:51] you know you're going to get a
[29:52] breakthrough you know you're going to
[29:53] get delivered you know you're going to
[29:55] get a victory you know you're going to
[29:57] get touched Hallelujah you know that
[30:00] because God put a faith inside your soul
[30:04] Hallelujah so when God speaks to a man
[30:07] he has faith in God hallelujah not what

[30:27] People

[31:17] getting closer to where I want to go to
[31:20] I have an name I have a vision I have a
[31:22] purpose that's what having a vision is
[31:25] that's what having an ambition is it
[31:26] makes you get up from Jericho and head
[31:29] down to Bethel it makes you get up from
[31:31] Bethel and head down to Jordan that's
[31:34] what purpose is that's what goal is it

[32:02] work more responsibility more orders
[32:05] more accountability you don't want to be

[32:10] carries accountability ambition is a
[32:12] powerful thing Let My People Go and they
[32:15] go they have no more excuse they can't

[33:33] him a purpose when God speaks to a man
[33:36] he gives him ambition when God speaks to
[33:38] a man he gave him Faith to do it right
[33:41] to accomplish or to achieve what his
[33:46] purpose is in
[33:48] life what God called him to do and he

[41:12] Elijah tell go and tell me what you
[41:15] seeu it's plenty days
[41:17] gone go and tell what you see man a
[41:20] mountain and go and see there's
[41:23] nothing I a
[41:25] come I tell you what you see
[41:28] what did you see how you can see
[41:30] nothing how you how you see
[41:33] nothing how you can climb a mountain and
[41:35] actually see nothing there's you could
[41:38] you you could see that there is nothing
[41:41] after 40 plus years of believing a
[41:44] message there's nothing there is nothing
[41:48] you mean you comeing to just all these
[41:49] years and there is nothing run again go
[41:52] and see again run again see again run

[42:11] [Applause]
[42:13] again he run seven times you know why he
[42:16] run seven times because Elijah wasn't
[42:18] taking nothing for an answer because
[42:20] nothing is ready and not an answer
[42:22] nothing is zero nothing is nothing you
[42:25] can't come back with nothing come back
[42:27] with something he said I see a cloud
[42:29] like a I what run
[42:33] run is that small but R rain is coming I
[42:39] hear the song of the abundance of rain
[42:43] you better begin to persevere to your
[42:46] promise of
[42:48] [Applause]
[42:51] Dynamics each one of you each individual
[42:55] begin to understand
[42:57] begin to anoint it AR fresh you each one
[43:00] of you be like Simeon God must reveal to
[43:03] you you're going to get the Holy Ghost
[43:05] God must reveal to you that this revival
[43:08] is yours it it's not the church own it's
[43:11] your own come on come on now come on
[43:19] now I don't have permission to put
[43:21] people in The Bride thank you Lord or
[43:23] out the bride so really and truly we
[43:26] don't know who really is the bride right
[43:27] per that mystery is in God I have
[43:30] permission to preach the word hallu you
[43:32] have permission to receive it that's
[43:33] right believe it that's right and act
[43:35] upon it I have permission to be
[43:37] convinced this is the truth have many
[43:39] people right now all over the Internet
[43:41] they're coming against brother BR coming
[43:42] against the message they don't want to
[43:44] quote but Bram they don't believe the
[43:45] prophet no more all kind of foolishness
[43:47] but I believe this is a genuine Malachi
[43:50] 42 Cy Prophet that brought a message and
[43:53] God is allowing the critics the Skeptics
[43:55] the make Believers all of them to be
[43:56] exposed
[43:57] because God could only work through True
[43:59] Believers so after 40 plus years God
[44:02] filtering you see the first filter was
[44:04] big holes in it the big big unbelief
[44:06] fall right through then you have smaller
[44:08] holes to let but afterwards the rest
[44:11] that remain is True Believer all the
[44:13] unbelief God shaken the camp God shake
[44:17] it in the 70s in the 80s in the '9
[44:21] shaking the camp shaking filtering
[44:25] because he want to get some people who
[44:27] become his voice who become his body who
[44:30] become the final Voice who become his
[44:32] very word itself he's got to find a
[44:35] people that wouldn't move one eye out
[44:37] from what he has promised because what
[44:40] he has promised he has able to perform
[44:43] what he has
[44:45] [Applause]
[44:45] [Music]
[44:48] promised what he has
[44:51] promised God is able to perform so I
[44:54] have no problem believing the cripper
[44:55] going to walk because God promis it I
[44:58] have no problem believing miss going be
[45:00] restored because God promis it I'm not
[45:03] responsible for keeping it to bringing
[45:04] it to past I'm responsible to make
[45:06] myself available to be a channel in
[45:09] which God can use because you can make
[45:11] yourself available to God if God could
[45:13] use a donkey God could use me come on
[45:17] come on now if God
[45:18] [Music]
[45:19] could that's a measly
[45:22] fate there a low one call it a low blue
[45:25] if God could use a donkeys reason God
[45:28] could use me donkey donkey not donkey

[45:45] want the world I things of the world I
[45:47] these ties out there I find myself
[45:48] looking in magazines but God could
[45:49] change that and that's how you have to
[45:51] begin to speak to yourself you have to
[45:53] tell yourself something oh glory to God

[51:55] almighty God have the effect this all
[51:58] powerful God is waiting for somebody
[52:00] with Bly Faith to step out and challenge
[52:04] the enemy on the basis of his word hallu
[52:07] oh Hallelujah when
[52:09] Elijah they from second handed row after
[52:12] his whole heart's desire was to get that
[52:14] promise he wanted the promise that was
[52:17] his motive that was all his hearts that
[52:20] was his life that was his intent
[52:22] everything all every hung on getting
[52:25] that promise
[52:27] that's the whole every time you wake up
[52:28] in the morning the promise Simeon the
[52:31] promise Abraham the promise ABR going to
[52:34] mark it but he's standing to promise at
[52:37] how you going I'm going great but God
[52:39] promised me hallelujah hallu hallelujah
[52:42] you go to Abraham house you have a sign
[52:44] I am promised a
[52:46] baby not everybody like that
[52:49] sign who would like that sign everybody
[52:51] say you're old man but Abram only
[52:53] laughing and rejoicing because he
[52:54] already had Isaac is was in faith ins
[52:57] inside his soul so he could shout he
[52:59] can't produce it yet but is a revelation
[53:01] to him Revelation comes to the
[53:03] individual listen you have any internet
[53:05] called to share you can share this and
[53:07] share that you can't share a
[53:09] revelation hall Hall I'll say it again
[53:14] you cannot share a revelation it have no
[53:17] button to click share with Revelation
[53:19] you could testify your Revelation but
[53:21] Revelation is personal and individual
[53:24] Revelation is your own that's your
[53:27] button when God revealed it to you it's
[53:29] yours now Faith is so when Abraham it
[53:33] was quickened to him his precious wife
[53:36] he is so close to it wasn't quicking to
[53:38] her that is why she could have a good
[53:42] laugh but that was his wife she could
[53:45] laugh because she doesn't have what God
[53:47] revealed to Abraham and when God
[53:49] revealed it to you your sister could
[53:51] laugh your mother could laugh your
[53:52] brother could laugh your husband could
[53:53] laugh but you can't laugh because you
[53:55] have a revelation of of what God has
[53:57] revealed to you could we say amen amen

[54:55] who wants sought salvation by the
[54:57] baptism Holy Ghost who once taught

[55:17] degrees you may have The Robe of the
[55:18] Methodist Church you may have the
[55:20] Pentecostal church only a secondary to
[55:23] begin with some man-made dogmas to come
[55:24] for like that but even if you're a
[55:26] Christian he said
[55:29] today what up some preacher he said
[55:32] today with many school and educated
[55:34] Scholars with many men who can tear the
[55:36] Bible apart and set it together in
[55:38] mathematics many men who can tell you
[55:41] great things in the way of teaching who
[55:42] knows Bible History to the very moment
[55:45] who could tell you that the hour hell
[55:47] was lit and the hour it went
[55:50] out that's how deep these mens are they
[55:54] could tell the our hell God
[55:56] it and oh it went out they can tell you
[56:00] these things they got spiritual baptism

[56:04] Jordan to the face the critical world
[56:06] what did he cry hallu about elishah
[56:08] where is the god of Elijah here we it
[56:11] wasn't the robe of Elijah that done it
[56:14] it was the power of God of Elijah that
[56:15] done it and the thing that the world
[56:17] needs today this morning is the power of
[56:20] the god of Elijah you might have spoken
[56:22] tongues you might have run up the floor
[56:25] watch a second hand robe was all right
[56:27] but he needed a fresh call in his heart
[56:31] from God he needed a fresh anointed from
[56:34] God hallelujah he wore a second-handed
[56:36] robe when he come to the river but he
[56:37] needed a brand new firstand call from
[56:41] God a firstand power to perform the
[56:44] Miracles Hallelujah acts: 18 you shall
[56:47] receive power after the Holy Ghost come
[56:49] upon you isn't that right oh blessed be
[56:52] so what are they looking for what more
[56:54] do you want what does the church want he
[56:57] said everybody looking for messiah what
[56:59] does the church really want what are you
[57:01] looking for ask what am I looking for
[57:03] what are you looking for here he said we
[57:05] already got it God give it to us it's
[57:09] his promise for the
[57:11] hour that is what you supposed to be
[57:14] looking
[57:15] for the promise of the hour what's the
[57:18] promise Dynamics you shall receive power
[57:21] you already got the
[57:24] promise hallelujah amen listen to this
[57:27] we look in the Bible we see everywhere
[57:29] to the Bible anointed ones come on and
[57:31] make that would live again right in the
[57:34] hour for the hour we have got the
[57:36] Messiah it's him the word he said in the
[57:39] beginning was the word it's just waiting
[57:41] for somebody with faith to anoint it and
[57:44] make it live again oh that's beautiful
[57:48] so think about it now all the promises
[57:49] are there that's the Messiah is right
[57:51] here amen he's not coming amen he is
[57:54] here amen the Messiah is the word amen
[57:56] the promise for the hour just waiting
[57:59] for somebody with faith to anoint it and
[58:02] faith is based on forgiveness oh
[58:04] Hallelujah so therefore you still have
[58:06] to come through brotherly love you still
[58:08] have to come to the honey to have the
[58:10] faith anointed let's take a look at that
[58:13] woman she came to Jesus she had a lot of
[58:15] Vex with the devil right oh she had
[58:17] plenty of disappointments her disciples
[58:19] couldn't handle her and then Jesus said
[58:20] it's not fit to take the children's
[58:22] bread and cast it the door but when
[58:24] faith is anchored you could
[58:27] When Faith is in your soul you don't
[58:29] have disappointments because you just
[58:31] bind disappointments when Jesus said
[58:33] it's not fit to take the children's
[58:35] bread and cast the dog that didn't throw
[58:37] her off she didn't stop coming to church
[58:40] she didn't give up on God she stood
[58:42] right there you see Faith makes you
[58:45] stand Faith make you persevere Faith
[58:48] have I'm not going to give up I'm going
[58:51] to stay right here till something
[58:54] happens that's what faith does that's
[58:58] how Faith Works real Faith perseveres
[59:02] real Faith press to watch The Promise so
[59:05] the Bible said Abraham staggered not at
[59:07] the promise of God to unbelief but was
[59:10] strong worshiping he was strong praising
[59:14] he was strong smiling when he come to
[59:16] church because he knew every day Isaac
[59:18] was coming closer every day the promise
[59:21] was coming more real every day he was
[59:23] nearer to his Revival every day he was
[59:27] nearer to his Deliverance every day he
[59:29] was nearer to his healing every day he
[59:32] was nearer to his healing that's what
[59:35] faith
[59:40] does the church s spiritually dead God
[59:45] gone the hours pass them they in a slump
[59:49] hardly know what to do one running this
[59:51] way one that way and he every promise
[59:54] that God made in the Bible every every
[59:56] one of them is laying Just As Good As It
[59:58] Ever
[1:00:00] Was
[1:00:01] Hallelujah GL what's make the church
[1:00:04] like this laia she has to come that way
[1:00:08] oh praise God now here we go from the
[1:00:12] absolute every great
[1:00:15] achievement has been tied to an absolute
[1:00:18] amen not achievement if a great
[1:00:21] achievement amen and there's got to be
[1:00:24] something a final time post and no man
[1:00:29] cannot by no means achieve anything
[1:00:32] unless they recognize there's an
[1:00:34] absolute and Paul and an absolute his
[1:00:36] absolute was a Christ centered life so
[1:00:38] what brother BR is saying you can
[1:00:40] achieve much if you don't come to an
[1:00:41] absolute well I don't know if this is
[1:00:44] right because somebody doing this
[1:00:46] somebody doing that you have no absolute
[1:00:49] absolute is the red light red light
[1:00:51] cannot mean
[1:00:52] go that going to be massive confusion
[1:00:56] amen red supposed to mean absolutely
[1:00:59] stop green means absolutely go that is
[1:01:03] an absolute ire absolute man is out man
[1:01:07] is out is a goal is no goal blow the
[1:01:09] whistle you're out off the field walk
[1:01:13] whatever the ire say is final if you
[1:01:16] don't have ire it going to be riot in
[1:01:17] every match so you have to have the ire
[1:01:20] you have to have the lights you have to
[1:01:21] have an absolute one time Hitler was an
[1:01:24] absolute ever Hitler say everybody yes
[1:01:26] sir no sir Hitler is the boss but that
[1:01:29] was Bo absolute but we have an absolute
[1:01:31] absolute is the
[1:01:36] word don't know should say this here but
[1:01:38] you know have scales B hat a fall
[1:01:41] scale hit somebody with false scale
[1:01:43] false thing on the scale and some people
[1:01:45] use false scales they use one scale for
[1:01:47] themselves and one scale and change
[1:01:49] skilles quick to change to judge
[1:01:50] somebody else so they using scales to
[1:01:53] suit theel that's not an absolute you're
[1:01:55] shifing scal you shift in the weight the
[1:01:57] same way you judge you have to go
[1:01:59] consistent you have to use the same Plum
[1:02:01] line you can't say this is for my family
[1:02:02] and that's not for yours this is for
[1:02:04] this church not for that church no it
[1:02:05] got to be the same scale and when you
[1:02:07] see the same scale that's absolute the
[1:02:08] word so you don't have feelings in it
[1:02:11] and emotions it's just the word
[1:02:14] hallelujah that is what an absolute is
[1:02:17] the word oh praise God I'm going to wrap
[1:02:19] up here the reason that Paul had a
[1:02:24] Christ centered life
[1:02:26] because he personally lay aside his
[1:02:29] teaching and he personally met Christ I
[1:02:31] like that Hallelujah he really met
[1:02:34] Christ so he wasn't just taught and had
[1:02:37] knowledge and information and Revelation
[1:02:40] he met Christ by way of the pillar of
[1:02:43] fire and when you meet Christ and the
[1:02:45] only way you're going to ever know him
[1:02:47] is to meet him to know him is life not
[1:02:51] even to know his word as good as it may
[1:02:53] be you've got to know him to know him
[1:02:55] life to know him his life and when your
[1:02:57] life change you make you make it make
[1:03:00] you do thing you ordinar will not do he
[1:03:02] says like a ship a ship have an absolute
[1:03:04] that's the anchor when the ship is toss
[1:03:07] in you can put the anchor it will hold
[1:03:09] and if Christ here we go is your
[1:03:12] absolute you ATT tie to him in a manner
[1:03:15] no matter what anybody says how hard the
[1:03:17] persecution gets how bad the storm seems
[1:03:19] to be how it looks impossible for it to
[1:03:21] happen it something has to happen to you
[1:03:23] Christ becomes your absolute any promise
[1:03:26] in the Bible becomes your absolute if
[1:03:28] you are sick you are praying for healing
[1:03:30] and something strikes you I've got it
[1:03:33] nothing going to shake you from it amen
[1:03:35] amen here we go what the Christian needs
[1:03:39] today in this atomic age in this time of
[1:03:42] incity you need something besides just
[1:03:44] an experience of joining church that's
[1:03:46] right you need an anchor that's right an
[1:03:49] absolute that you know that's right
[1:03:50] because here we go churches will
[1:03:54] fail right amen am might want to admit
[1:03:59] it but that is what the prophet said I
[1:04:01] am not a prophet I believe a prophet so
[1:04:04] if he said that I have to believe that
[1:04:07] churches will fail people will fail but
[1:04:14] Christ cannot fail so Christ is the
[1:04:17] absolute to the believer and if Christ
[1:04:21] is your absolute you are tied to
[1:04:23] him not the church
[1:04:26] Church to him so if the church fail
[1:04:29] that's not
[1:04:31] [Applause]
[1:04:33] you you heard what David said don't
[1:04:36] 10,000 fall on my right
[1:04:39] side shall not be
[1:04:42] moved that is
[1:04:45] them that have nothing to do with me
[1:04:49] that is 10,000 on my right side I am on
[1:04:52] this
[1:04:53] side they on that side
[1:04:57] that's David the Lord is with me th run
[1:05:01] staff they comfort
[1:05:04] me don't prepares the table for me in
[1:05:06] the presence of my enemy David had a
[1:05:08] relationship with
[1:05:09] God a personal
[1:05:13] one when he get in trouble I done to De
[1:05:16] oh Lord have I
[1:05:17] Sinn David know he sined against God so
[1:05:20] he came to God and confessed restore
[1:05:23] unto me the Jo
[1:05:28] Hallelujah David recognize the joy God
[1:05:31] but he know he's a son restore unto me
[1:05:34] the joy God are not feeling good oh give
[1:05:39] the Lord
[1:05:43] Praises so you do have joy well the time
[1:05:46] you repent and ask God to restore your
[1:05:47] joy and when you repent and ask God to
[1:05:49] restore Here Comes Your Joy am then
[1:05:51] David said I was glad when they said
[1:05:53] unto me what let us go into the house of
[1:05:55] the Lord then they get a joy to come to
[1:05:57] service you get a joy to come to church
[1:05:59] you get a joy to worship a joy to hear
[1:06:01] the word of God it becomes your
[1:06:05] [Applause]
[1:06:07] joy
[1:06:12] amen so you know if the red doesn't mean
[1:06:16] red he said no watch it going have a big
[1:06:17] traffic jam it's kind of rude way to
[1:06:20] express it but yet you know what I'm
[1:06:22] trying to say notice the reason we have
[1:06:24] gotten to it there because every one of
[1:06:26] us make our own
[1:06:28] absolute that kind that kind of selfie
[1:06:31] absolute they already making their own
[1:06:34] we have our own absolute each church has
[1:06:36] its absolute each group has its own
[1:06:38] absolute and they say each one of them
[1:06:40] say we are the truth the way we got it
[1:06:42] all you ain't got nothing to do with it
[1:06:44] you and the minority we are the greatest
[1:06:46] group and people do that you ought not
[1:06:48] to do that amen until it's like the days
[1:06:51] of Judges where every man does what's
[1:06:52] right in his sight he thinks he right in
[1:06:55] his own sight but there's a way that
[1:06:57] seem right unto man and the end thereof
[1:06:59] is the way of death but the Bible said
[1:07:01] people did that because the word of God
[1:07:02] was precious they didn't have a prophet
[1:07:05] and if we didn't have a prophet message
[1:07:07] that we could go back to to tie
[1:07:09] ourselves back to it we' be in big
[1:07:11] trouble he said we want to live life is
[1:07:13] the greatest treasure that man can have
[1:07:15] and now we've got to find what is life
[1:07:16] he said my word is life he didn't say
[1:07:18] yesterday today and forever you have got
[1:07:20] to get the Living Word in you to have
[1:07:22] the Living God in you because the word
[1:07:24] here is God when is made flesh in you
[1:07:27] made spirit and life in you when it goes
[1:07:31] into your flesh and your faith and
[1:07:33] becomes life right not just your faith
[1:07:37] it have to go in your flesh too the word
[1:07:39] have to singe you the word have to
[1:07:41] become part of you and I say you have
[1:07:43] your hand you can raise it that's your
[1:07:44] hand that's how the word has to be part
[1:07:46] of you you must want it to
[1:07:48] live you see when you come to church and
[1:07:50] go back home and it doesn't apply to
[1:07:52] your life you're not getting involved
[1:07:55] you're not get you have to get mixed up
[1:07:56] with the word
[1:07:59] then it have to come saturated in your
[1:08:02] being it have to become part of you
[1:08:04] where you're feasting on it you're
[1:08:06] living on it you're talking about it
[1:08:08] amen tomorrow you could testify about
[1:08:10] the service you could share back things
[1:08:12] from it if tomorrow you forget
[1:08:14] everything you know what going

[1:10:16] inspired right now there are conditions
[1:10:18] all around us God set it up that way he
[1:10:21] s the mountain so high he said the
[1:10:24] valley so low he said the river so why
[1:10:27] to prove he is
[1:10:29] [Applause]
[1:10:32] God you he that he set the mountain so
[1:10:36] high he set the valley Hallelujah soow
[1:10:39] prise
[1:10:42] God when it comes into your flesh and
[1:10:44] your faith and becomes life then you are
[1:10:47] living example you are an Epistle of God
[1:10:51] oh blessed be the Lord God is right his
[1:10:54] word is right right others are not right
[1:10:56] that's right along as they stay with the
[1:10:58] word when you leave the word you leave
[1:11:00] God God is watching over his word to
[1:11:03] vindicate it to make it real and when a
[1:11:06] man takes a word of God no matter how
[1:11:08] little his faith is if he won't mix it
[1:11:10] with unbelief it will bring him out to
[1:11:12] the light oh praise the name of the Lord
[1:11:14] and that's how you are Christian by
[1:11:16] birth when you are born of the spirit of
[1:11:18] God persistent yes but when you can
[1:11:20] achieve something all men through all
[1:11:21] the ages have been able to achieve when
[1:11:24] they are persistent if they faith in
[1:11:26] what they're trying to achieve it
[1:11:27] depends upon what your achievement is it
[1:11:29] depends upon what you're trying to do oh
[1:11:31] blessed be the name of the Lord today
[1:11:33] and here we go I'm closing musician come
[1:11:35] up please what we need today is men and
[1:11:37] women who will take God by his word and
[1:11:41] be persistent with it hallu
[1:11:44] Samson Hallelujah he was persistent as
[1:11:47] long as he could feel those seven LS
[1:11:49] around
[1:11:52] him Hallelujah so Samson wasn't easy we
[1:11:56] know that Samson was quite a character
[1:11:58] but as long as he could feel seven Lu he
[1:12:00] felt
