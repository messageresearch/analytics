[25:59] all the inhabitants of the land tremble
[26:02] for the day of the lord cometh it is
[26:04] nigh at hand
[26:06] a day of darkness of gloominess a day of
[26:08] closure of thick darkness
[26:10] as the morning spread upon the mountains
[26:11] that great people and are strong
[26:13] yet not been ever the like neither shall
[26:16] it be anymore after it even to the years
[26:19] of many generations of fire devoured
[26:21] before them
[26:22] behind them a flame burn it the land is
[26:24] of the gardener even before them
[26:26] and behind them a desolate wilderness
[26:28] year nothing
[26:30] shall escape them the appearance of them
[26:32] is as the parents of horses
[26:34] and as horsemen so shall they run like
[26:37] the nose of charts on the tops of
[26:38] mountains shall they leap
[26:40] like the noise of flame of fire that
[26:42] devoured the stubble
[26:44] as a strong people set in battle array
[26:46] before their face the people shall be
[26:48] much
[26:49] pained all faces shall gather blackness
[26:52] they shall run like mighty men they
[26:54] shall climb the wall like men of war
[26:56] they shall march everyone on his ways
[26:59] and they shall not
[27:00] break their ranks neither shall one
[27:03] trust another
[27:04] they shall walk everyone in his path and
[27:07] when they fall upon the sword
[27:09] they shall not be wounded they shall run
[27:12] to and
[27:12] fro in the city they shall run upon the
[27:14] wall they shall climb up upon the houses
[27:16] they shall
[27:17] enter in at windows like a teeth the
[27:20] earth shall creep before them
[27:21] the heavens shall tremble the sun and
[27:23] the moon shall be dark
[27:24] the stars shall withdraw the shining
[27:28] and the lord shall utter his voice
[27:31] before his army for his camp is very
[27:34] great
[27:34] for he is strong that executed his word
[27:37] for the day of the lord is great and
[27:39] very terrible
[27:40] who can abide it therefore also now
[27:44] said the lord turning even to me
[27:48] with all your heart with fasting and
[27:50] with weeping
[27:51] and with mourning and ring your heart
[27:54] and not your garments
[27:55] and turn unto the lord your god for he
[27:57] is gracious
[27:59] and merciful slow to anger and of great
[28:02] kindness
[28:03] and repented him of the evil who knoweth
[28:06] if he will return and repent and leave a
[28:08] blessing behind him
[28:09] even a meat offering a drink offering
[28:11] unto the lord your god
[28:13] blow the trumpet in zion sanctify your
[28:16] fast
[28:17] call assembler call a solemn assembly
[28:20] may god bless his word you may be seated
[28:23] amen oh praise god could you say praise
[28:26] the lord tonight
[28:28] that's what we're here to do to praise
[28:29] him and to worship him
[28:31] oh praise god so tonight i will try to
[28:34] blow a trumpet
[28:35] song on a lamb that's the title tonight
[28:38] blow a trumpet
[28:40] song and the lamb
[28:43] and i believe this is a call to go out
[28:45] to call you out of samba
[28:47] out of liturgy out of being lukewarm and
[28:50] prayerless
[28:52] a call to repentance a call to
[28:55] confession
[28:56] a call to prayer now this
[28:59] trumpet was first announced in numbers
[29:03] 10
[29:04] numbers 10 verse 1 to 10 and i'll read
[29:06] it
[29:07] and the lord's taken to moses saying
[29:09] make two the two trumpets of silver
[29:12] of whole peace shall now make them and
[29:15] don't misuse them
[29:17] he would have held purpose to them for
[29:18] the calling of the assembly
[29:20] for the journeyian of the camps when
[29:23] they shall blow with them
[29:25] all the assembly shall assemble
[29:28] themselves together to thee
[29:29] at the door of the tabernacle of the
[29:31] congregation
[29:32] if they blow but with one trumpet then
[29:35] the princes which are heads of thousands
[29:37] of israel
[29:38] shall guide themselves unto thee when
[29:40] you blow on a lamb
[29:42] then the camps that lie on the east
[29:44] parts shall go forward
[29:46] when you blow an alarm the second time
[29:49] then the camps that lie on the south
[29:50] side
[29:51] shall take their journey they shall blow
[29:53] alarm for their journeys
[29:55] but when the congregation is still
[29:56] gathered together you shall blow
[29:59] but you shall not sung an alam and the
[30:01] sons of aaron the priests
[30:03] shall blow the trumpets and they shall
[30:06] be to you
[30:06] for an ordinance forever throughout your
[30:09] generations
[30:10] and if you go to war in your land
[30:14] against the enemy that will present you
[30:16] then you shall blow an alarm with the
[30:17] trumpets
[30:18] and it shall be remembered before the
[30:20] lord your god you shall be saved
[30:22] from your enemy and on the day of your
[30:24] gladness
[30:25] and in your solemn days in the
[30:27] beginnings of your months you shall blow
[30:29] with the trumpets over
[30:30] your burnt offerings over the sacrifices
[30:32] of your peace offerings
[30:34] that they may be to you a memorial
[30:36] before
[30:37] your god i am the lord your god
[30:40] amen so that was where god introduced
[30:43] these trumpets
[30:44] and you notice that the trumpet gave a
[30:45] song to cause a certain action
[30:48] whether for war for gathering for
[30:50] announcement
[30:52] it had a purpose behind it it had
[30:54] instructions behind it
[30:55] it gives a distinct and a certain song
[30:57] for a certain purpose
[30:59] but tonight i am trusting that god so
[31:03] it to your heart then that you will
[31:05] arose you into action
[31:07] to shake you into action and not this
[31:10] intellectual sitting in church taken
[31:12] hearing word message
[31:13] thing not that but to spill you and to
[31:16] steal your interaction
[31:18] hallelujah do you believe that it was
[31:21] the duty of the priests to blow the
[31:23] trumpets
[31:24] for the assembling of the congregation
[31:26] to remove the camp
[31:28] to go out to war to announce danger it
[31:31] was the duty of the priests
[31:32] to blow that trumpet the church is in
[31:35] need of a weakness
[31:36] no wonder the prophet said the bride had
[31:38] no revival yet
[31:40] there will be no manifestation of god to
[31:42] stood up bride it will take them seven
[31:43] thunders
[31:44] the prophet knew that it would take
[31:46] something to wake up the people
[31:48] to wake up not the people i should say
[31:49] wake up the bride because she was
[31:51] sleeping but something going to wake her
[31:52] up
[31:53] oh do you believe that tonight so this
[31:55] trumpet was used a song and a lamb
[31:58] to give fear the danger is at hand a
[32:01] warning coming
[32:02] isn't that right to arose of impending
[32:05] danger arouse the people
[32:07] that they could be sensitive to the
[32:08] judgments that was at hand
[32:10] oh praise god hallelujah so we believe
[32:13] that there's a need for an awakening
[32:16] oh glory to god to get a fresh burden
[32:18] for your children and your family people
[32:20] take it for granted you know god is good
[32:22] what is good god is good you can save my
[32:24] children no burden
[32:26] no tears no travail no crying and sign
[32:31] parents and church children outside and

[43:34] he said this is from revelation chapter
[43:36] four justin ville
[43:38] he said you know i've said before the
[43:40] open door he said that to the methodist

[43:48] the holy spirit amen hallelujah
[43:51] so when god put the open door here put

[43:54] he put the holy spirit and set before
[43:56] their open door holy spirit and that age
[43:58] was an open door
[43:59] that anybody could that's why the
[44:00] pentecostal age had no man messenger
[44:03] it was open door still that's why the
[44:05] holy was poured upon them
[44:07] because open door isn't that right watch
[44:10] watch i'll put an open door which is the
[44:12] holy spirit

[44:51] again one
[44:52] holy ghost baptism into that door this
[44:55] door was set in heaven

[44:58] an open door on the first voice
[45:00] song like a trumpet and all the scenes
[45:02] changed from patmos
[45:03] to heaven the voice here we go the voice
[45:06] that will walk with the seven golden
[45:08] candlesticks
[45:08] that same voice didn't change but the
[45:11] voice when it was heard in the first
[45:13] time
[45:13] how many remember that i was in the
[45:15] spirit of the lord's day in the spirit
[45:17] isn't that right i was in the spirit and
[45:18] lord's day and i heard behind me
[45:20] a voice of a trumpet that sounded like
[45:23] many waters
[45:24] and that many waters is the voice of the
[45:26] ministers the voice of the preachers
[45:28] the voice of many waters the voice of
[45:30] the people he explained what the voice
[45:32] of many waters is
[45:33] it's god's voice throughout the ages
[45:35] speaking the word to people
[45:36] and as they rejected the voice turned to
[45:38] judgment oh glory to god
[45:40] remember revelation is still a book of
[45:42] symbols a lot of things representing
[45:44] something else
[45:45] let's continue hallelujah and when i
[45:48] turned it look i saw one star in the
[45:49] midst of semicolon stands six
[45:51] and as he showed all the mystery of them
[45:53] seven golden candlesticks
[45:54] holding seven stars he looked and saw an
[45:56] open door
[45:57] an open door into heaven how do you get
[45:59] in by christ jesus
[46:01] one door one way any man can climb other
[46:04] way any other way
[46:05] same as a teeth and a rubber and in the
[46:07] parable there we go
[46:08] of the one who climbed up and was in the
[46:10] wedding supper without the garment on
[46:12] was found guilty was bound and cast into
[46:15] outer darkness
[46:16] only one way i believe i preached here
[46:18] not long ago
[46:19] whenever somebody gets married in the
[46:21] old country he gave out invitations
[46:22] himself
[46:23] he has to finish the robes and when he
[46:25] met this man sitting there
[46:27] how many remember the parable he found a
[46:29] man at the supper table without a
[46:31] wedding garment on
[46:32] what is it the bridegroom stands at the
[46:35] door
[46:35] and all who comes up with an invitation
[46:38] no man can come
[46:39] to the father except by me or when you
[46:41] come to the invitation
[46:42] so that everybody will look alike
[46:45] look alike not you better than who and
[46:48] i'm better
[46:48] than who look alike watch watch whether
[46:51] they're rich or poor
[46:52] bundle free black or white male or
[46:55] female they are all one in christ jesus
[46:57] and the bridegroom stood at the door and
[46:59] received the invitation
[47:01] and put the robe around his fellow so
[47:02] the rich and the poor all look alike
[47:04] that's the way it is in the kingdom of
[47:07] god there's no big guys and little guys
[47:09] there's only one guy
[47:11] one christ jesus one in christ
[47:14] oh do you believe that so this man he
[47:16] came to this back door
[47:17] and the master came and said friend how
[47:20] did you get in here with otago
[47:22] jesus said to himself he said he called
[47:24] to the porter
[47:25] bind him foot on hand he was cast into
[47:28] outer darkness where there was weeping
[47:30] and wheeling the national teeth that's
[47:32] christ's own words he was cast out
[47:34] because it proved here we go without the
[47:36] weather and garment he comes some other
[47:38] way besides the door
[47:39] because if he come to the door he would
[47:41] have received the wedding garment
[47:43] he said oh listen to this then if the
[47:45] wedding gamut
[47:46] is the baptism of the holy spirit how
[47:49] are we
[47:50] going to be represented any other way
[47:54] you've got to come by christ jesus the
[47:55] way the truth the life
[47:58] oh hallelujah not by some joining some
[48:01] church
[48:02] and everybody message and everybody
[48:03] brother branham what is that
[48:05] without the door you're only getting
[48:06] started the bible you said the devil
[48:08] believe and tremble
[48:10] oh hallelujah let's continue but here's
[48:12] what i want to get to
[48:14] revelation 1 10 3 13 i want you to
[48:18] notice the voice that he heard speaking
[48:20] to him
[48:20] had the clearness of a trumpet you know
[48:23] our trumpet songs
[48:24] it gave a short song what
[48:27] does a trumpet mean question in the
[48:30] bible
[48:31] what does a trumpet mean war
[48:35] anytime you see a trumpet blow it is war
[48:37] in the bible time
[48:38] it is a song then meant a war
[48:42] then he went further either a revelation
[48:46] or something to take place
[48:50] so identify treatings a war
[48:53] a revelation or something to take place
[48:57] oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah
[48:59] praise the lord
[49:01] wonderful hallelujah praise the name of
[49:04] the lord

[49:44] here
[49:45] war this is the setting of the great
[49:47] battle
[49:48] the people that rejected god's message
[49:51] rejected the holy spirit the messenger
[49:54] of the seven churches
[49:56] oh the one that had
[49:59] rejected this message of his grace has
[50:02] nothing left but judgment and that's why
[50:05] with a jubilee trumpet song those who
[50:09] don't want to go free had to be bored
[50:11] in the air so that they will have no
[50:14] more effect upon them
[50:16] they have to hear it and they can't be
[50:18] released from their condition
[50:20] because they choose not to go free oh
[50:23] glory to god that's exactly right
[50:26] when it comes to that set spirit set
[50:28] condition he says 50 50 still
[50:30] righteous still holy still oh this is
[50:33] not skim milk
[50:35] hallelujah there's one that rejected
[50:36] this message of his grace had nothing
[50:38] but judgment was ready
[50:39] while he was making ready to pour the
[50:41] place upon the earth come up here
[50:43] i will show you what was taking place
[50:45] hallelujah
[50:47] moses had to act first before he saw the
[50:49] miracles
[50:51] the three human boys had to act first
[50:53] before they saw the fought man in the
[50:55] fire
[50:56] they had to act on the word so the word
[50:59] is not given to sit down just to think
[51:01] about
[51:01] and to talk about and to explain about
[51:03] and to fellowship about the word country
[51:05] to act on it
[51:10] george sent me something i guess i think
[51:11] i'm going to read it sometime
[51:13] not tonight about a woman who came and
[51:16] she was too late for the prayer line
[51:17] and she was healed before of some
[51:20] disease or something like that

[52:24] hallelujah praise god
[52:25] joshua let's go back to this morning he
[52:28] marched around the wall
[52:29] exactly like the chief captain told him
[52:36] the enemy was defeated because day was
[52:38] inside the wall but now he was going to
[52:40] get in how he will get inside of there
[52:43] so he took a little stroll to meditate
[52:46] and then he met a man he draw his sword
[52:49] and joshua thought maybe this might
[52:51] wanna be the
[52:53] enemy or whatever he joins are you
[52:54] forced are you against us
[52:57] and he said i am the captain of the host
[52:59] and he told him what to do
[53:02] and it's a kind of hard thing to think
[53:04] watch
[53:05] that you could blow a trumpet and make a
[53:06] wall fall down
[53:08] i want you to think about that the
[53:10] instruction looking kind of flimsy
[53:12] that you could blow a trumpet and make a
[53:14] world fall down but he acted
[53:16] and god makes it simple and silly it
[53:19] goes plum
[53:20] over the head of the lamb it takes those
[53:23] unlearned that don't know very much to
[53:25] understand it
[53:26] but when you try to figure it out you
[53:28] can't figure it out you got to take
[53:29] god's word for it the way he said to do
[53:31] it
[53:32] not the way we think to do it but the
[53:34] way he said do it
[53:36] oh glory to god when i beat you to shout
[53:38] shout
[53:39] and then drop them trumpets on them
[53:41] walls oh glory to god i guess if science
[53:44] would go into it now
[53:45] they might say hold them trumpets start
[53:47] to hit a song and hit some kind of
[53:49] toenail
[53:49] level and and start to zoom some kind of
[53:52] thing they could explain it away right
[53:53] now
[53:54] but god said when i beat you to child
[53:56] shout oh glory to god when i shout
[53:58] there is something reverberation going
[54:01] to start up
[54:02] and i go take it from there like how
[54:04] david was doing a sling
[54:05] and when they even released the stone
[54:07] god david said god said release it and i
[54:09] will take the stone from there
[54:10] oh give the lord a shout but i'm taking
[54:13] a rock and chewed up in the air
[54:15] and then done come a whirlwind he said
[54:16] you have to do something
[54:18] for something to happen give the lord a
[54:20] shout inside of here
[54:21] do you get a church do you get that
[54:23] believers you've got to do something
[54:26] for something to happen not just talk
[54:28] about it do

[1:12:03] raise up the foundations
[1:12:04] of many generations and all shall be
[1:12:06] called the repairer of the breach
[1:12:10] the restorer of parts to dwell in
[1:12:13] we have a great ministry ahead a great
[1:12:16] calling ahead
[1:12:18] but there's a cost that goes with it
[1:12:22] i'm almost done ezekiel 33
[1:12:25] reading from verse 1. again the word of
[1:12:28] the lord came unto me saying son of man
[1:12:30] speak to the chair of israel and say
[1:12:32] unto them when i bring the sword upon a
[1:12:34] land
[1:12:36] if the people of the land take a man
[1:12:39] of their coast and set him
[1:12:42] for their watchman when he see
[1:12:46] the sword come upon the land he blow a
[1:12:49] trumpet
[1:12:50] and warned the people then whosoever
[1:12:53] here at the song of the trumpet
[1:12:55] and take it that warning if the sword
[1:12:56] come and take him away
[1:12:58] his blood shall be upon his own head he
[1:13:01] heard the song of the trumpet
[1:13:03] took not warning his blood shall be upon
[1:13:06] him
[1:13:07] but he that taketh warning shall deliver
[1:13:09] his soul
[1:13:10] but if the watchman see the sword come
[1:13:13] and blow not the trumpet and the people
[1:13:17] be not warned
[1:13:19] if the sword come and take any person
[1:13:21] from among them
[1:13:23] he is taken away in his iniquity but his
[1:13:25] blood
[1:13:26] will i require at the watchman's hand
[1:13:30] oh so this give a different perspective
[1:13:33] now
[1:13:34] of this trumpet to be blown oh
[1:13:36] hallelujah
[1:13:38] if the watchman don't blow the trumpet
[1:13:40] and things happen
[1:13:42] god require it at the watchman's
[1:13:45] the men so son of man so dawg verse 7
[1:13:49] so so thou o son of man i have set thee
[1:13:53] a watchman unto the house of israel
[1:13:58] therefore thou shalt hear the word at my
[1:14:00] mouth and
[1:14:01] warn them from me when i say unto the
[1:14:05] wicked o wicked man
[1:14:06] thou shall surely die if thou dost not
[1:14:10] speak to warn the wicked from his way
[1:14:13] that
[1:14:14] wicked man shall die in his iniquity
[1:14:17] but his blood will require a dying hand
[1:14:21] nevertheless if the war on the wicked of
[1:14:23] his way to turn from it
[1:14:25] and he turn not from his way he shall
[1:14:27] die
[1:14:28] in iniquity but that was delivered thy
[1:14:30] soul
[1:14:31] therefore though son of man speak unto
[1:14:34] the house of israel
[1:14:36] thus he speaks saying if our
[1:14:38] transgression of our sin be upon us and
[1:14:40] we find our way how shall we live
[1:14:42] say unto them as i live said the lord i
[1:14:45] have no pleasure
[1:14:46] in the death of the wicked but that the
[1:14:49] wicked thing from his way
[1:14:50] and live turn me from your evil ways
[1:14:54] why will you die o house of israel
[1:14:57] so if you see from these scriptures god
[1:14:59] have a burden for people to really
[1:15:00] repent
[1:15:02] because he wants to forgive he wants to
[1:15:04] restore
[1:15:05] he wants to heal he wants to bless do
[1:15:08] you believe that
[1:15:10] isaiah 21 11 12 the burden of douma he
[1:15:13] called it to me of the seer watchman
[1:15:14] what of the night
[1:15:16] watchman what of the night the watchman
[1:15:17] said the morning cometh
[1:15:19] and also the night if he shall inquire
[1:15:21] inquire ye return
[1:15:23] come and then baraban and preach that
[1:15:25] message wash my word at night
[1:15:27] he says and then he's talking about as
[1:15:30] soon as we get washed up and groomed up
[1:15:31] talk about people that's dramatizing
[1:15:33] we will meet at the tavern as usual and
[1:15:35] i'm sure john
[1:15:37] you are you all this table body message
[1:15:39] we here today watching under the tower
[1:15:41] trying to make a dick to joy all the
[1:15:42] whole life
[1:15:43] trying to tell us there's approaching
[1:15:44] danger because the watchman in the tower
[1:15:46] he's seeing something and these people
[1:15:47] want a party they want to drink and
[1:15:49] whatnot
[1:15:50] so he's talking about people talking
[1:15:51] about it would this watch man want to
[1:15:53] take away the joy from us
[1:15:55] he said now what and you know we have
[1:15:56] the best army there is i mean our
[1:15:58] soldiers meet each night
[1:16:00] same place we enjoy fellowship together

[1:16:05] would refuse to be alarmed about any of
[1:16:07] this stuff
[1:16:08] that this watchman would talk about or
[1:16:10] rabbis know about this or pastors and so
[1:16:12] on
[1:16:12] do you believe that there will be a
[1:16:14] possible chance the wash man could be
[1:16:16] right
[1:16:17] all this warning and warning thing
[1:16:20] you know we don't have to take that so
[1:16:22] serious you know this
[1:16:23] this is barbara you know there's
[1:16:24] something about danger there's something
[1:16:27] about debt
[1:16:28] that seems to have a forewarning of it
[1:16:30] many times that loved ones before
[1:16:31] passing across
[1:16:32] set side a warning comes to them
[1:16:35] hallelujah a watchman must
[1:16:37] be on duty at all times he was to warn
[1:16:40] the people
[1:16:41] of approaching dangers that was his duty
[1:16:43] to watch
[1:16:44] for approaching dana danger he was up in
[1:16:47] a tower
[1:16:48] that was built much higher than the
[1:16:49] walls and this tower had to be up there
[1:16:51] in it
[1:16:52] the books of astronomy and so forth he
[1:16:54] could watch the stars and tell the time
[1:16:56] any approach and time of the day he
[1:16:57] could tell it then he was he could see
[1:16:59] further than anyone on the ground
[1:17:01] he could see further he was up higher
[1:17:04] actually before they built the city
[1:17:05] walls they built the tower
[1:17:08] that's the first thing they built was it
[1:17:10] all first thing
[1:17:12] so they kept piece of land they built a
[1:17:14] tower and they put was found up there
[1:17:16] and he watching and even fighting and
[1:17:18] they watching lane bricks
[1:17:20] they built the wall they built the gate
[1:17:21] then they said they built houses
[1:17:23] they fortified but that watch man you
[1:17:26] had to put him up there
[1:17:27] because he had to scan the horizon
[1:17:29] because there are always some demons
[1:17:30] some spirits some heights
[1:17:32] looking to see they could come and take
[1:17:34] back get back hit back
[1:17:36] revenge back always that's just the
[1:17:38] nature
[1:17:39] of life and the holy spirit is that
[1:17:42] watchman
[1:17:43] who is making ready the people and
[1:17:46] giving warnings to god
[1:17:48] hallelujah that watchman had to be
[1:17:50] trained
[1:17:51] he had to know what he was doing for at
[1:17:53] any distance as soon as he arose the
[1:17:55] enemy could detect it he could tell
[1:17:57] their walk he could tell their match
[1:17:59] he could tell their color he could tell
[1:18:01] their rank and file just as far humay
[1:18:03] could see he could see it he was higher
[1:18:05] than the rest of them he was trained to
[1:18:07] know the enemy
[1:18:08] and god required the whole city as at
[1:18:11] hand
[1:18:12] oh my musician come up please

[1:18:55] of words which
[1:18:56] voice they heard entreated that the word
