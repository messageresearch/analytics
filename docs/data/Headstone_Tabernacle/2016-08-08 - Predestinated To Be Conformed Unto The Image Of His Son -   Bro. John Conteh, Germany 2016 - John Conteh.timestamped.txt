[29:21] here praise
[29:25] God there's one of them is written in
[29:27] German so somebody who can speak German
[29:30] and English should be good to translate
[29:33] this yeah okay well there's uh one here
[29:36] from uh FAO Giovani Farah Khan I guess
[29:41] it is from
[29:43] bethl uh yes come he says uh since 2001
[29:48] I've been
[29:49] struggling with a tumor I am still under
[29:53] therapy please pray for me that God May
[29:57] grant me complete deliverance amen
[30:00] praise the
[30:04] Lord the name is y
[30:07] Anna the Lord Jesus Christ knows my need
[30:11] in my heart in spiritual sense my hunger
[30:15] and thirst for
[30:18] more and also his
[30:21] sickness in my in my body okay wonderful
[30:27] before we bow our heads I'll just say
[30:30] this you heard the testimonies from
[30:33] brother Tim puit just a few hours ago
[30:37] right now that's real that's very real
[30:41] and I know it is
[30:43] because a few years
[30:46] ago my wife um went into the doctor for
[30:50] back pain you know the story right yeah
[30:54] and uh they diagnosed her after an MR r
[30:57] that they took they said she had a uh uh
[31:02] her aorta the main artery out of the
[31:04] heart had a separation in it um uh like
[31:09] a u it was breaking open there's a
[31:11] certain word for it and uh it was very
[31:15] urgent and uh so the doctor wanted to
[31:19] come come in
[31:20] immediately
[31:22] and have a CAT scan they call it so they
[31:26] know how to operate because she could
[31:28] die at any minute it could break open
[31:30] and she's dead and uh so before she
[31:35] went we got down on our
[31:38] knees and we prayed not a long loud
[31:41] prayer with just a simple prayer in
[31:44] simple faith and just like brother Tim
[31:48] did I took this message for
[31:52] me I took it for
[31:54] myself and before I knew what I said
[31:57] said I said before the doctor's hand
[31:59] touches her she'll be completely healed
[32:02] well they brought her in they did the
[32:04] CAT scan about an hour went by the
[32:07] doctor called her in he had two pictures
[32:10] up on the wall one was before and one
[32:13] was after he said this here you see the
[32:15] line here he said that's what the
[32:18] problem was he said I don't know what to
[32:20] tell you ma'am but it's
[32:26] gone
[32:29] oh he's real oh yes he's real
[32:35] Hallelujah so we've got one tumor here
[32:38] and we've got a another illness that we
[32:41] don't know but Jesus knows so we know
[32:44] that he's real and we can pray for these
[32:47] two individuals now and let's bow our
[32:50] heads Heavenly Father we know you're
[32:53] real we know that uh you called this uh
[32:57] conference here Lord so that you could
[32:59] come and amongst your people and and
[33:02] speak to us and demonstrate yourself
[33:05] alive again today Lord you've never gone
[33:09] anywhere you just want us to wake up and
[33:11] realize that you love us and that you're
[33:14] here and that you're here to heal our
[33:17] sicknesses and meet our needs and
[33:19] deliver the captives so father I Lay My
[33:22] unworthy hand on these two prayer
[33:25] requests Lord may this boor be gone in
[33:28] the name of Jesus Christ and may this
[33:30] other answer come quickly to this saint
[33:33] Lord and meet their needs in the name of
[33:36] Jesus Christ Lord we believe it and we
[33:39] say together amen so be it amen praise
[33:43] His name praise the
[33:47] Lord
[33:49] amen praise His wonderful
[33:53] name I guess this would be the same key
[33:56] let's sing um
[33:57] hold to God's unchanging hand you know
[34:01] that song time is filled with swift
[34:05] transition isn't that
[34:08] true days we're living in I haven't been
[34:12] on this Earth long but I've been on it
[34:14] long enough to see it go from bad to
[34:19] worse to completely crazy we live in an
[34:22] insane world but let me tell you
[34:24] something else before we sing this song
[34:28] you know this message that the two
[34:31] brothers have spoken about that they're
[34:33] so passionate about you show me any
[34:36] other evangelist either present or past
[34:39] who could who could at 24 years old tell
[34:43] exact troop movements that was going to
[34:46] happen in a world war that hadn't even
[34:48] happened
[34:50] yet that was going to happen with the
[34:52] imagin or the sigf freed line and how
[34:55] the Americans were going to be uh
[34:57] overcome the Germans and this was going
[34:59] to happen with musolini and Hitler that
[35:01] he just came into Power
[35:04] 1933 and said what was going to happen
[35:06] in the next decade or two tell me who
[35:09] else can do that he did it that's who
[35:13] did
[35:13] it and then he and then he says and then
[35:17] as it goes on technology will get to a
[35:20] place till they have cars that are
[35:22] operated by some other power that need
[35:24] no driver that's
[35:27] now they have to implement it because
[35:30] the cities are too crowded it wasn't
[35:33] necessary before now it
[35:36] is and then he saw a great a woman rise
[35:39] in great power in the United
[35:42] States do I have to draw you a picture
[35:46] do I have to put her picture up there

[36:07] the others that and the fact that God
[36:10] followed that Ministry with Miracles and
[36:13] signs and wonders that all those other
[36:16] evangelists still talk about Benny in
[36:18] and the rest of them they still talk
[36:20] about what happened with brother

[40:35] speaking um this morning when um brother
[40:39] bisc was talking about the soldier that
[40:42] got delivered when he said that a song
[40:45] just exploded in my mind that I had
[40:48] heard and I'd never sung it or anything
[40:51] and I mentioned it and a few of the
[40:53] brothers had heard it before you give me
[40:55] a key for for
[40:57] there and uh some of you young people
[41:00] have probably heard it you know it's in
[41:02] some of the Christian radio stations and
[41:05] stuff but it just it when he talked
[41:08] about him coming out saying I'm
[41:10] free it just all of a sudden I could
[41:13] hear the song so I thought maybe it was
[41:15] supposed to be sung you know so I'll
[41:18] I'll sing the verses and those of you

[41:21] that's fine but the chorus is so simple

[41:35] me with a
[41:39] Melody you surround me with a
[41:47] song of

[43:53] witness men still alive that worked with
[43:56] the
[43:58] prophet that walked in an age that we
[44:01] all aspired to be
[44:03] in the age of
[44:06] adoption one man that
[44:08] was that had an angel working with
[44:12] him and um to be privileged to be in
[44:15] that age and to see all that that in
[44:17] itself is
[44:18] amazing and I think these meetings is a
[44:21] blessing that we can go back down memory
[44:24] lane and bring back all the things that
[44:26] God did in the
[44:28] prophet and all the brothers their
[44:31] testimonies has just blown my heart
[44:35] away
[44:36] amen and
[44:38] um opportune to
[44:41] see what God did in one
[44:44] man but they themselves at that time
[44:46] can't partake of those
[44:49] experiences because when we are all
[44:51] predestinated to partake of those
[44:52] experiences at a time like
[44:54] this the same experience Malachi for
[44:58] had because he gave us a promise that we
[45:01] shall meet that same
[45:03] angel can somebody say Amen to that if
[45:06] that's your promise then say Amen to
[45:08] that tonight am amen glory to God
[45:11] hallelujah and he gave us precious
[45:13] promises revealed from the word from the
[45:17] back of the
[45:18] book and that by these promises we can
[45:21] become
[45:22] partakers of this nature experiences
[45:26] and those experiences is what it would
[45:28] take to transform
[45:30] us into the image of his son which
[45:33] qualifies us for the
[45:35] Rapture
[45:37] Hallelujah so I feel good tonight that I
[45:40] can witness Living
[45:42] Voices that saw God walked on two feet
[45:45] in this
[45:46] age if that's how you feel tonight then
[45:49] say Amen
[45:50] tonight if you feel that way tonight
[45:52] give a god a shout of
[45:54] Amen is a
[45:57] privilege Living
[45:59] Voices that can still give a
[46:02] testimony that God Elohim visited Our
[46:06] Generation and there was a wave shift
[46:08] over all of us that one day we shall
[46:11] come to the same spot where we can
[46:14] partake of that divine nature we can
[46:17] partake of that God we can partake of
[46:20] his nature of his Blessing of his works
[46:22] of his
[46:23] power but the prophet say the things you
[46:25] see in
[46:26] temporarily will become
[46:28] permanent in the bride so I want to
[46:31] thank brother colen
[46:33] Brana for his boldness of Faith to call
[46:37] these
[46:38] meetings he's really bold enough to call
[46:40] these
[46:41] meetings and I believe God has an agenda
[46:44] for these
[46:45] meetings God had a purpose for these
[46:48] meetings
[46:50] Hallelujah so call BR I appreciate you
[46:52] very

[46:57] God water the desires of your
[46:59] hearts we love you I've always

[49:39] little thought tonight let's stand to
[49:41] our
[49:42] feet let's turn to
[49:45] genesis6 and then Romans 8 a little
[49:49] thought predestinated to be conformed

[49:54] son that that's
[49:57] my title for
[49:59] tonight predestinated to be
[50:03] conformed into the image of his son
[50:06] that's why we are here this is not a
[50:09] church this is

[50:23] genesis6 glory to
[50:27] God and God said let us make man in our
[50:30] image after our
[50:32] likeness and let them have dominion over
[50:35] the fish of the sea over the fowl of the
[50:37] air and over the cat and over the the
[50:39] Earth and over every creeping thing that
[50:41] creepeth upon the
[50:43] Earth so God created man in his own
[50:46] image and the image of God created in
[50:49] him male and female created he
[50:52] them and God blessed them and God said
[50:56] unto them be fruitful and multiply and
[50:59] replenish the Earth and subdue it and
[51:04] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[51:07] over the fowl of the air and over every
[51:09] living thing that moveth upon the

[54:42] Jesus praise God Amen well for tonight I
[54:46] want to find a way to see how I could
[54:48] bring
[54:49] forth your word for
[54:54] tonight we have promises in this
[54:59] Bible like it was in
[55:03] Genesis God spoke the heavens and spoke
[55:06] the
[55:07] Earth and right beneath the Earth there
[55:10] were
[55:11] seeds all kinds of
[55:14] seeds
[55:15] reptiles mamalian seeds serpent seeds
[55:19] all those seeds were on the
[55:21] Earth but you see it took the BR of the
[55:26] spirit until the Holy Spirit bruts over
[55:30] the Earth Hallelujah those Spirit life
[55:33] remain
[55:35] hidden say
[55:37] Amen that means the Holy Ghost had to
[55:41] come down brood over the Earth but as he
[55:45] was
[55:46] brooding life Spirit were coming out
[55:51] responding to the
[55:52] brooding but God under the back part of
[55:56] his mind he had an
[55:58] intention he had an image on the back of
[56:01] his mind so he kept brooding he kept
[56:05] brooding repan life showed up animal
[56:09] life showed up marine life showed up all
[56:14] kinds of Life showed up but he kept
[56:17] brooding because was going towards what
[56:20] was on the back part of his mind because
[56:23] on the back part of his mind had an
[56:25] image he had an intention for doing the
[56:28] brooding so he kept brooding until
[56:31] finally something came out of the earth
[56:34] that looked just like the one that was
[56:36] doing the
[56:40] brooding then God
[56:44] stopped can somebody say Amen to that
[56:46] church and that is why in this meetings
[56:49] we can't come to these meetings without
[56:52] the Holy Spirit brooding over you
[56:55] because you sit here tonight with all
[56:57] kinds of
[56:58] seeds all kinds of spirit in our minds
[57:03] in our flesh but as the Holy Spirit
[57:05] keeps
[57:07] brooding not it doesn't only expose
[57:10] those Spirits bring them out but God
[57:13] keeps going deeper Because deep inside
[57:16] of you is a
[57:17] seed a seed of God that lays deep inside
[57:21] the socket of your soul and that's the
[57:24] thing that God is trying to reach said
[57:26] the Pentecostals they can bring forth
[57:29] Deliverance I've seen that in my church
[57:32] and in many meetings the Holy Spirit
[57:34] Falls I've seen the Holy Spirit Falls in
[57:37] meetings I've seen people crawling with
[57:39] their tongue coming out they crawl on
[57:42] the floor like
[57:45] snakes I've also SE the Holy Ghost fall
[57:47] in a meeting in my church and I've seen
[57:50] people back like
[57:52] dogs see these are
[57:57] Spirit but as the Holy Ghost comes upon
[58:00] the church those Spirits cannot hide
[58:03] anymore because the Holy Ghost exposes
[58:06] all those Spirits all the church Spirits
[58:10] this called fanatical Spirits religious
[58:14] spirits that are hiding in the message
[58:16] when the Holy Ghost begins to Bro all
[58:19] those Spirits showed up Hallelujah but
[58:22] those Spirits is not you
[58:27] no those Spirits is not
[58:30] you you are more than those Spirits
[58:33] because deep inside of you God by the
[58:35] Holy Ghost is trying to reach that seed
[58:38] of God that he place inside of you that
[58:41] is his intention let somebody shout
[58:46] hallelujah hallelujah God sent a
[58:50] prophet Hallelujah and but the Bram had
[58:53] the logos of el know
[58:55] him this Bible that you see is a book of
[58:58] life it's a book of
[59:01] seeds all kinds of seeds lays in this
[59:08] Bible say all the religions you see
[59:11] today they all have a seed in
[59:14] here and God sent a Prophet by the Holy
[59:17] Ghost he begin to brood over the world
[59:20] since 1946 47 three pools brooding
[59:25] as he kept brooding all kinds of seed
[59:28] Spirit showed up even the hidden seeds
[59:31] like the serpent seed showed up because
[59:33] the Ser was but it was
[59:36] hidden but as he kept
[59:39] brooding all those Spirits all those
[59:41] lives showed up but on the back part of
[59:44] God's mind God had an image on the back
[59:47] of his mindl he was trying to see if you
[59:50] could have somebody that can become like
[59:53] Jesus and Malai came to East Third pool
[59:57] let somebody say Amen in the midst of
[1:00:00] the revelation of the serpent seed the
[1:00:03] church Spirit showed up false anointed
[1:00:06] Spirits all showed up all kinds of
[1:00:09] spirits showed up in the days of the
[1:00:11] Prophet but God kept broing God kept
[1:00:15] broing until
[1:00:17] 1963 when he hit the third pole a man
[1:00:20] show up his name is William Mario Bram a
[1:00:23] man that was a perfect reflection of
[1:00:26] Jesus
[1:00:28] Christ but the plan was so much like
[1:00:32] Jesus until people missed him for
[1:00:36] Jesus A Perfect Image that stood on the
[1:00:40] earth
[1:00:42] Hallelujah I'm so excited tonight
[1:00:44] Hallelujah that that is your promise
[1:00:51] tonight God's
[1:00:53] intention
[1:00:55] for the bring since 1946 was
[1:00:59] achieved when one man showed
[1:01:02] up there was nothing less than God on
[1:01:04] the
[1:01:07] Earth but the Bram had to understand the
[1:01:11] difficulty separating him from the son
[1:01:13] of man in future home he said that's
[1:01:17] where they get you the whole thing
[1:01:18] confused because he was a son of man
[1:01:22] revealing the but it shows that he was
[1:01:25] so much in unity with
[1:01:29] God he was so much in Oneness with God
[1:01:33] Amen Hallelujah God took his form
[1:01:36] Hallelujah God wore TI God put on shoes
[1:01:40] the prophet stood there it was God
[1:01:43] incarnated oh I feel so religious
[1:01:46] tonight I feel so excited tonight God
[1:01:50] made
[1:01:51] flesh that is your promise tonight
[1:01:54] Hallelujah somebody shch
[1:01:58] Hallelujah don't let no preacher take
[1:02:01] this away from
[1:02:06] you don't let no church membership take
[1:02:10] this away from you that you shall
[1:02:12] promise to become like Jesus you shall
[1:02:15] be perfect you shall be like your father
[1:02:18] you shall be like God if you feel that
[1:02:20] way tonight they shout
[1:02:23] hallelujah
[1:02:25] let me SE that so but
[1:02:27] Bram was a perfect
[1:02:31] reflection of Jesus
[1:02:35] Christ and God had to wave
[1:02:38] him in the midst of all the revelation
[1:02:41] of the serpent seed so that is your
[1:02:44] focus so but Bram was an image of God
[1:02:47] that came from the back part of God's
[1:02:49] mind he was not the serpent seed he was
[1:02:52] not your CH Spirit but you feel
[1:02:56] older and God stopped brooding when God
[1:02:59] saw a man that was exactly like
[1:03:02] himself why can't we feel good tonight
[1:03:05] you had what Edis said all they could
[1:03:08] let you see here was to see how God
[1:03:11] worked in one man how one one man was so
[1:03:14] much in unity with God he was so much in
[1:03:17] Oneness with God hallelujah until he
[1:03:21] could be misunderstood for God Amen
[1:03:24] people literally worship the Bram here
[1:03:27] to deny it that I am not the son of man
[1:03:30] I am only the El Son of men hallelujah
[1:03:33] praise God but that's how I feel tonight
[1:03:36] I feel tonight I can become like
[1:03:53] Jesus
[1:03:56] that sound like a hard thing to
[1:04:00] say so we don't see just Malachi for was
[1:04:03] a
[1:04:05] prophet the only man for our age in all
[1:04:08] ages that attained
[1:04:12] Perfection letting you see what was
[1:04:15] God's intention in
[1:04:17] Genesis that was his
[1:04:20] intention of creating
[1:04:23] Adam when it came to Adam who was he it
[1:04:26] was a
[1:04:27] reflection of
[1:04:31] God and Satan came and M
[1:04:34] image but God cannot fail am he gave a
[1:04:38] promise I will
[1:04:40] restore I'll bring it back hallelujah
[1:04:44] praise God hallelujah hallelujah
[1:04:46] hallelujah hallelujah I mean this is
[1:04:48] good stuff this stuff should make
[1:04:51] somebody
[1:04:52] shout this stuff should make some
[1:04:54] somebody feel happy Hallelujah this is
[1:04:56] not

[1:05:01] bride these are people that are making
[1:05:05] themselves ready for the Rapture these
[1:05:07] are people in whose heart is want to be
[1:05:10] like Jesus that's the bride not your
[1:05:14] church where you pay your tithes and pay
[1:05:17] your offerings I'm I'm not saying
[1:05:21] that but in your heart
[1:05:24] do you want to become like
[1:05:29] Jesus in your heart do you have faith
[1:05:32] you can become like
[1:05:34] Jesus in your heart do you believe you
[1:05:37] can become one with
[1:05:40] God you not say Amen too
[1:05:43] well you are not saying amen too
[1:05:46] well if you don't say Amen then I cannot
[1:05:52] preach because I must preach and you say
[1:05:56] Amen the prophet said when you say Amen
[1:05:59] you watch the words as you water the
[1:06:02] word the Holy Ghost comes down and pour
[1:06:05] the anointing upon that word so let
[1:06:07] somebody say Amen because this is your
[1:06:11] message this is your name this is your
[1:06:13] life this is why you are
[1:06:17] here you are not here to just be in a
[1:06:22] convention you are here to know what is
[1:06:25] your next plan in
[1:06:28] God after you leave here what is your
[1:06:32] next
[1:06:33] hope what are you living
[1:06:39] for why all this
[1:06:43] sacrifice pay all your money to come to
[1:06:46] a
[1:06:47] convention not to be an onlooker or an
[1:06:51] observer but to be given faith
[1:06:54] that once you leave this convention you
[1:06:57] going back to your country you shall
[1:06:59] become like
[1:07:00] Jesus you shall become my God
[1:07:04] hallelujah Satan might not like
[1:07:14] this he does not like this message but
[1:07:18] this is your
[1:07:19] message this is your life hallelujah

[1:07:27] it that's why you see when you go
[1:07:30] through all Mal false message all kinds
[1:07:33] of spirit look at the message today all
[1:07:35] kinds of spirit hallelujah hallelujah
[1:07:38] and people can use any code to justify
[1:07:44] anything because he revealed
[1:07:47] all the
[1:07:52] Mysteries am
[1:07:55] he R the all the he
[1:07:57] life that's in this
[1:08:01] Bible but what is your
[1:08:05] life and what you preach in your church
[1:08:09] that's the life you put into your
[1:08:14] people if you preach the word image
[1:08:17] that's what they will have in your
[1:08:19] church if you preach serpent seed that's
[1:08:23] what they will de but it's all in
[1:08:27] here but God's intention for
[1:08:30] brooding was not to get the serpent seed
[1:08:34] because God brooded past the serpent
[1:08:36] seed there's more yet to e and we shall
[1:08:39] come to it because that is your promise
[1:08:42] hallelujah praise God somebody shout
[1:08:44] hallelujah
[1:08:46] hallelujah in the message today we have
[1:08:48] a
[1:08:50] challenge a very serious
[1:08:52] challenge and our challenge is how do we
[1:08:56] put the word and the spirit together
[1:09:01] amen that's a challenge Hallelujah
[1:09:05] because Malachi 4 presented four
[1:09:07] steps
[1:09:08] justification sanctification B the Holy
[1:09:11] Ghost and Holy Ghost itself but God
[1:09:14] don't have four steps God has actually
[1:09:17] three
[1:09:19] steps because the early church had three
[1:09:22] steps Justified
[1:09:24] Sanctified and the Holy Ghost came with
[1:09:26] power no first
[1:09:29] steps they had the word and they had the
[1:09:32] spirit when they preach Holy Spirit
[1:09:36] Falls They Don't Preach and wait for a
[1:09:38] year later for the Holy Ghost to fall
[1:09:40] they had the word and the spirit
[1:09:44] together that's the
[1:09:46] church down through the seven Church
[1:09:48] ages that was broken
[1:09:50] apart God was separated St John 1:1 says
[1:09:55] in the beginning was the word and the
[1:09:57] Word was with God and the Word was
[1:10:00] God and the word there means logos so
[1:10:04] the logos was with Elohim and the logos
[1:10:07] was Elohim you can't break that God and
[1:10:11] His word are one and what became flesh
[1:10:15] can somebody say Amen to that church and
[1:10:16] St John 424 says God is a spirit so God
[1:10:21] is Not Just word but God is also
[1:10:25] spirit so to emphasize God as the word
[1:10:29] is breaking God into
[1:10:31] parts and that's what went wrong in
[1:10:33] seven Church
[1:10:35] ages separating the word from the spirit
[1:10:39] and each group makes emphasis on what
[1:10:41] they have they don't like no Spirit no
[1:10:45] shouting no Hallelujah no signs no
[1:10:49] wonders in the message is all
[1:10:52] Pentecost we have put away all the
[1:10:54] spirits because it's word word word word
[1:10:57] word but the word can deliver you the
[1:11:00] word alone can set you free the word
[1:11:02] alone can change you you need the word
[1:11:05] and the
[1:11:10] spirit somebody shout
[1:11:13] hallelujah so today in the message is
[1:11:16] the
[1:11:17] word if you preach signs and wonders
[1:11:20] it's
[1:11:22] Pentecost
[1:11:24] but just hear what theis said this
[1:11:26] morning that's not
[1:11:28] Pentecost that was called in flesh there
[1:11:31] was Jesus on the earth you can fool me
[1:11:34] this hour the book has been open you
[1:11:37] have seen your name you know exactly who
[1:11:39] you
[1:11:41] are you see so we make the same mistake
[1:11:44] that was made down through seven Church
[1:11:47] ages breaking God into
[1:11:50] pieces making God three making God four
[1:11:55] making God
[1:11:56] five but here Israel the Lord thy God is
[1:12:00] one
[1:12:02] God Mal for came back to bring the unity
[1:12:06] between God and His words Hallelujah can
[1:12:10] somebody shout hallelujah the word and
[1:12:13] the spirit that's how you are born
[1:12:16] that's how you are
[1:12:17] delivered I can preach all this word to
[1:12:19] you but if the spirit doesn't come on it
[1:12:23] you can't be delivered because the
[1:12:26] spirit gives life to the words the
[1:12:29] spirit activate the word the spirit
[1:12:32] makes the word move
[1:12:43] Hallelujah you be seated so in this age
[1:12:47] we can't have
[1:12:51] four that means when we come come to the
[1:12:54] third
[1:12:55] step it must be word and spirit together
[1:12:59] again like they had it in the early
[1:13:03] church had to bring the word after
[1:13:07] Pentecost because Pentecost had the Holy
[1:13:10] Spirit but no what and that only
[1:13:13] produced false anointed ones because the
[1:13:17] Holy Ghost came there was no seed word
[1:13:20] on the inside that's right so they spoke
[1:13:22] in tongues all kinds of Life signs
[1:13:25] wonders but still no word so God sent a
[1:13:29] prophet to restore back the word as the
[1:13:31] fourth line word connecting back the
[1:13:34] word to the spirit so as you sit here
[1:13:37] now by the time you leave here tonight
[1:13:40] the Holy Ghost will come upon you you
[1:13:43] shall feel God in power experience his
[1:13:46] spirit in your soul and you shall be
[1:13:50] changed Hallelujah you shall be called
[1:13:53] home and another am
[1:13:57] men glory to God hallelujah hallelujah
[1:14:01] hallelujah and the prophet said what we
[1:14:03] have done today we have made too much
[1:14:08] stress the
[1:14:10] mechanics so so it's the stress you
[1:14:15] make what you
[1:14:18] stress is what you
[1:14:22] have we put too much
[1:14:25] stress on the
[1:14:27] mechanics but the mechanics without
[1:14:30] Dynamics is no
[1:14:34] good it takes Dynamics to prove whether
[1:14:37] it
[1:14:38] gasoline because the gasoline can be in
[1:14:40] the gasoline can maybe it's water so put
[1:14:44] fire on it then you can tell whether
[1:14:47] it's gasoline or whether it's water
[1:14:50] praise God hallelujah so the gasoline
[1:14:52] word has been poured to you all these
[1:14:55] years pure gasoline word now God can
[1:14:59] release fire to connect with the
[1:15:02] gasoline world and light you up for your
[1:15:04] age you become a light for this age a
[1:15:08] light for your generation can somebody
[1:15:10] shout hallelujah oh somebody say
[1:15:12] hallelujah
[1:15:19] hallelujah so we can go back to four
[1:15:21] steps because for restore the word now
[1:15:25] be justification sanctification B of the
[1:15:28] Holy Ghost then on your baptism you're
[1:15:30] back to and
[1:15:37] spirit that means when we come to the
[1:15:39] third pool which is our
[1:15:41] pool is word and spirit it will take a
[1:15:45] 5old minutes to to do that that's right
[1:15:48] it will take Jesus to take his word and
[1:15:52] take his spirit and put it together no
[1:15:54] man can do that we can preach the word
[1:15:58] but God will list the spirit we preach
[1:16:02] the word but God release corresponding
[1:16:04] power so it will take God in a f
[1:16:07] Ministry to take his word in his spirit
[1:16:10] and put it together and bless the church
[1:16:13] hallelujah praise God so brother John
[1:16:15] cannot do that but the Ed cannot do that
[1:16:18] it will take God himself to do that that
[1:16:21] is why we all must pray that God sent
[1:16:23] forth this ministry because you have
[1:16:26] promised a Ministry of Jesus Christ that
[1:16:29] Ministry is for your Perfection it is
[1:16:31] not about a man it's about
[1:16:36] Jesus Christ himself coming down to
[1:16:39] perfect You by his word and by his
[1:16:45] Spirit the word and the spirit makes up
[1:16:48] the Holy Ghost
[1:16:51] itself the Holy Ghost is in incomplete
[1:16:54] without word without spirit so the Holy
[1:16:56] Ghost itself that's your Perfection
[1:16:59] that's your Joseph word in spirit
[1:17:04] together until we have that we going
[1:17:10] nowhere and that is what we must contend
[1:17:13] for so in these meetings you can't come
[1:17:17] here this is almost 50 years after is
[1:17:20] gone our understanding ought to our open
[1:17:23] by now
[1:17:25] am you coming to this meeting looking
[1:17:28] for
[1:17:29] what no
[1:17:31] prayer no dedication no worship looking
[1:17:36] for what Hallelujah looking for statue
[1:17:38] of a
[1:17:39] man to speak to you that must
[1:17:46] change this is 50
[1:17:49] years would should come to me like this
[1:17:53] with a prayerful heart not to see a man
[1:17:56] not to hear from a man but to see God in
[1:17:59] flesh the war taken on flesh that is how
[1:18:03] the church ought to
[1:18:11] be that is what these conventions ought
[1:18:14] to
[1:18:16] be we've attended conventions after

[1:21:48] you Hallelujah I came to anoint your
[1:21:51] faith let let's use this few moments and
[1:21:55] ask God the same God of William B Bram
[1:21:59] let that God show
[1:22:03] up let that God come on the
[1:22:17] scene let me seated that let me
[1:22:21] seated
[1:22:27] when I'm talking to you
[1:22:29] tonight I'm not really
[1:22:32] preaching I was in
[1:22:34] Tred and I felt a strong voice in my
[1:22:37] heart that God is changed the
[1:22:42] season God is looking for
[1:22:45] people other P 304 will God called
[1:22:49] people to whom this book is open to
[1:22:54] Hallelujah because if this book is
[1:22:57] closed you don't even know who you are
[1:22:59] you can't
[1:23:01] Pray when Christ came to Resurrection
[1:23:04] Ministry for 40 days what he did he
[1:23:06] opened your
[1:23:08] understanding to understand the
[1:23:10] scriptures but it was scriptures
[1:23:13] concerning
[1:23:14] himself so they set themselves in that
[1:23:18] reflection he gave them promises he
[1:23:20] breathed on them they return to the
[1:23:23] upper room what we are they doing it was
[1:23:27] 10 days of prayer
[1:23:29] supplication that's how you tell when
[1:23:32] the book opens to your
[1:23:36] man if the book is open to you it will
[1:23:39] change your life
[1:23:41] Hallelujah because I am not going to set
[1:23:44] you down for anything less than that one
[1:23:47] image I left my Pentecostal church not
[1:23:50] to be another church member Hallelujah I
[1:23:53] came into this message to have all that
[1:23:56] was in the
[1:23:59] prophet all I'm after I must have all
[1:24:02] that was in Malachi 4 or I will not stop
[1:24:05] preaching this way I will not stop
[1:24:07] crying to God I will not stop praying
[1:24:09] until all that was in Malachi for his
[1:24:12] part to me that's why I'm here today
[1:24:15] hallelujah praise God hallelujah praise
[1:24:17] God I'm an eagle Son of God I will not
[1:24:21] rest
[1:24:22] and we shall not waste until we see the
[1:24:26] same God in that Elijah come back
[1:24:30] hallelujah hallelujah we shall not stop
[1:24:33] we shall not cease until the same
[1:24:36] God because this age has no hope if that
[1:24:40] God doesn't show
[1:24:46] up before God took Elijah of the
[1:24:49] scene God made sure he left Elijah is
[1:24:53] successor what could that age be like if
[1:24:55] there was no
[1:24:57] Elijah if there was no one man that saw
[1:25:00] the need to take back what Elijah had to
[1:25:02] save that
[1:25:04] age this age has no
[1:25:07] hope your family your loved ones look at
[1:25:11] all the young people what have they
[1:25:15] had we have told them almost
[1:25:18] all but their desire is to see God
[1:25:21] taking on
[1:25:24] skin that can't come by sitting there
[1:25:27] and you can't even say Amen it can't
[1:25:29] come that way it can come by you not
[1:25:32] even
[1:25:33] praying it can only come like it came in
[1:25:36] the early church there were are locked
[1:25:38] up in the upper room they spent time
[1:25:40] with God they did their own assignments
[1:25:44] their own homework and God saw that and
[1:25:47] God said fire let somebody shout
[1:25:49] hallelujah God must find that same group
[1:25:53] God must find those same
[1:25:59] people when I walk into an audience I
[1:26:02] can tell you if the book is open to that
[1:26:08] audience an audience with no amens no
[1:26:11] Zeal no crime that's how you tell the
[1:26:14] book is
[1:26:21] closed
[1:26:23] America will soon have a woman
[1:26:26] president Malachi 4 gave that to us as
[1:26:29] an end time sign before the
[1:26:32] analiation that is almost less than 100
[1:26:35] years from
[1:26:37] now a woman will become president
[1:26:43] America what does that mean to the
[1:26:46] bride Woman as a prime minister now in
[1:26:51] London in
[1:26:53] Germany women taking over the seat of
[1:26:56] power when that works the tightening
[1:26:59] comes
[1:26:59] in World Church Council who are they
[1:27:02] coming after
[1:27:04] you to destroy that word image in
[1:27:07] you thank you Jesus like it was in the
[1:27:11] early
[1:27:12] church when they con that they knew that
[1:27:14] Christ was to be formed in this man they
[1:27:16] came against them and the scripture said
[1:27:18] they locked up in the upper for fear of
[1:27:20] the Jews
[1:27:22] we are back on the same thing
[1:27:24] again but God by his grace has opened
[1:27:27] the book To
[1:27:28] Us brother I sense The Squeeze is coming
[1:27:32] on can somebody say Amen to that church
[1:27:35] I sense The Squeeze is coming on this is
[1:27:38] time to unite with the word get closer
[1:27:41] with God hallelujah give your last
[1:27:44] breath say God I've got to get out of
[1:27:48] here I've got to go my home is a future
[1:27:51] home Jesus has a future over you
[1:27:55] Hallelujah that's your
[1:28:00] promise this is
[1:28:02] serious very
[1:28:04] serious and Jesus said Watch and Pray so
[1:28:08] that they don't take you on
[1:28:14] awars that's why we are privilege to
[1:28:17] have received a
[1:28:20] prophet and you must not take it for
[1:28:25] granted your BR in this message is a
[1:28:28] privilege it's the grace of God don't
[1:28:30] take it for
[1:28:32] granted it makes you humble it makes you
[1:28:35] cry out it makes you cry say
[1:28:41] God this is how it should be after 50
[1:28:44] years this is what I expect in
[1:28:51] conventions
[1:28:59] it has to
[1:29:01] change we came from I Coast I told the
[1:29:04] Paul brother get your audience prepared
[1:29:07] but bam said no matter how the preacher
[1:29:09] is
[1:29:11] fished if the audience is not funished
[1:29:13] nothing
[1:29:15] happens no matter how the audience is
[1:29:19] furnished if the preacher is not fished
[1:29:21] nothing happens
[1:29:22] look God had always had Moses in his
[1:29:25] hand but he had to wait for the people
[1:29:29] to cry Hallelujah he gave them a
[1:29:32] promise they came to a season the book
[1:29:35] was open to only a family joed and
[1:29:39] amam they saw through that book for
[1:29:41] their day and they knew they are not M
[1:29:45] doers they took their promise and spend
[1:29:49] time on God and God sent a deliverer for
[1:29:51] them
[1:29:52] them and when God met Moses what did God
[1:29:55] say he said I have heard the groanings
[1:29:58] Hallelujah of my
[1:30:00] people we can't change
[1:30:03] that that has to be a setting for
[1:30:08] Dynamics let somebody shout
[1:30:11] hallelujah that must be a setting for
[1:30:14] Dynamics all the Pastors in this church

[1:30:29] home the Rapture train is on Hallelujah
[1:30:33] I'm on my way to the
[1:30:43] Rapture this is
[1:30:46] serious if you don't have the Holy Ghost
[1:30:49] what are you waiting
[1:30:50] for
[1:30:52] waiting for some man no man can give you
[1:30:55] that a man can preach that to
[1:30:58] you but God gave you a SE on the inside
[1:31:02] that seed must not begin to cry back to
[1:31:09] God May me
[1:31:13] seated God will always respond to a
[1:31:15] desperate
[1:31:17] Soul these messages we are meant to
[1:31:19] bring us all up to a state of
[1:31:21] desperation

[1:34:41] age there is a power in you that can
[1:34:44] live above your
[1:34:50] sin
[1:34:56] listen I told my young folks back home
[1:35:00] that Satan as we Define who a youth
[1:35:03] is or I'm a young man so as a young man
[1:35:08] you must dress immorally because we are
[1:35:11] still young you see that's how you
[1:35:12] define who a youth
[1:35:17] is but God didn't design like
[1:35:23] that because your strength is in your
[1:35:28] youth God expect you to even serve him
[1:35:31] in the days of your
[1:35:34] youth there's power in the
[1:35:36] youth but your mindset has to
[1:35:39] change when you think because I'm young

[1:35:46] no that's wrong your mindset must change
[1:35:50] because God made no mistake when he

[1:36:47] unbelief unbelief has to be casted out
[1:36:58] B says repentance is a change of
[1:37:01] mind sometimes our mind
