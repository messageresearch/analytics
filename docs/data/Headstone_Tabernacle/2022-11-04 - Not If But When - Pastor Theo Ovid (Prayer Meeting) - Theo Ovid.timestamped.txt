[13:49] way we invite you in our midst tonight
[13:51] we invite you in the world tonight to
[13:53] speak to us by your word and give us an
[13:54] entrance man entrance with minister to
[13:57] us tonight but we can approach your
[13:59] throne and crowd onto you in GCM I ask
[14:01] it email and God bless you since it's
[14:04] such a privilege to be here and I'm
[14:06] grateful that all of you are here
[14:08] tonight
[14:08] and we want to just go into the
[14:10] scriptures
[14:11] only read from Matthew chapter 6. I want
[14:14] to read from 1 to 18 Matthew chapter 6.
[14:17] we didn't from one feed and do the very
[14:19] interested in the scripture I know parts
[14:21] of it we touched before but I want to
[14:23] just look at something again
[14:25] Jesus speaks
[14:27] easy take heed that you do not your arms
[14:31] before men to be seen of them otherwise
[14:35] you have no reward of your father his
[14:37] name
[14:38] so Jesus is not seeing
[14:41] um as as if uh uh how you're going to do
[14:44] this but he is expecting you to do this
[14:46] to give give arms
[14:49] and then he tell me how to do it those
[14:52] two therefore window doeth thy arms
[14:56] do not form a trumpet before the other
[14:58] Hypocrites doing this in The Ghost and
[15:00] the streets that they may have Glory of
[15:02] men very nice unto you they have their
[15:04] reward windowed with arms let not thy
[15:07] let her know what thy right and do it
[15:10] got down arms may be in secret or you're
[15:13] given in secret and thy father will see
[15:16] you to the secret himself shall brought
[15:18] openly
[15:19] verse 5.
[15:21] Wendell Prius
[15:23] though shall not be as Hypocrites are
[15:25] for they love the priests standing in
[15:27] the synagogues in the corners of the
[15:29] streets that he may be seen of men very
[15:31] nice unto you they have the reward but
[15:34] when no priest entered into thy closet
[15:36] and when Lord shut their door pray to
[15:39] thy father with Siege and secret and thy
[15:41] father with season secret shall reward
[15:43] you openly
[15:45] so he's showing here that your whole
[15:48] operation in life is not a policeman
[15:51] it's not to do things to impress man
[15:53] it's it's a good consciousness
[15:56] to know that if you're given God is here
[15:59] to know if you're praying God is here
[16:02] okay so therefore he said but when you
[16:06] pray
[16:07] so he's digging down inside of you know
[16:09] use that vain repetitions as a he can do
[16:12] for they think that they shall be heard
[16:15] for their much speaker
[16:17] but be not therefore like unto them for
[16:20] your father knoweth what things you have
[16:22] need of
[16:23] before you ask him
[16:25] so it's not that you wouldn't ask him
[16:27] it's not that you would rock back with
[16:29] her attitude but you know our need of he
[16:31] would you love to ask no you still have
[16:34] to ask
[16:35] but you know he know what you have made
[16:36] up
[16:37] so he said you know who's nice after
[16:40] this manner therefore pray our father
[16:42] was just in heaven yet
[16:47] taking them come still worship them thy
[16:50] will be done in earth as in heaven then
[16:53] verse 11 give us this day our daily
[16:56] bread
[16:58] and forgive us our debts as we forgive
[17:01] our debtors
[17:02] and lead us not into temptation
[17:04] but Deliver Us from Evil for thine is
[17:07] the kingdom the power and Glory forever
[17:09] and ever this is a perfect prayer is
[17:12] that forgiveness in it it have the
[17:14] kingdom to come in it it have the will
[17:16] of God in it it have uh the worship
[17:18] Hallowed be thy name in it it has leaves
[17:21] nothing Temptation in it deliver some
[17:23] evil everything in it who is 14 and if
[17:26] you forgive men not forgive not many
[17:28] trespasses neither will your father
[17:30] forgive your trespasses
[17:32] verse 16 moreover 25. be not as
[17:36] hypocrites
[17:39] of Assad confidence for these figures
[17:41] that they may appear on the mental
[17:43] realize unto you they have their reward
[17:45] but don't when the fastest anoint their
[17:48] head wash their face the door appear not
[17:51] on demand of us but unto thy father
[17:53] which is in secret and thy father which
[17:57] is in secret shall we already openly may
[17:59] God bless his word so it's treating one
[18:00] Accord here
[18:03] When you pray when you give
[18:05] When you pray
[18:07] and when you fast
[18:09] not if you give
[18:11] if you pray
[18:13] or if you fast
[18:15] he is seeing or implying this is a win
[18:21] so I have a title I want to put this not
[18:23] if
[18:24] but when
[18:26] not if
[18:27] but when
[18:29] and we have a consolation tonight
[18:31] enough consolation is the Holy Ghost is
[18:35] poured out on individuals
[18:38] I want you to hold it in your heart
[18:40] tonight that the Holy Ghost is poured
[18:43] out on individuals
[18:46] even if there's no point in the church
[18:48] even if they are point out in the
[18:50] assembly it is still poured out on
[18:53] individuals
[18:55] so you tonight in your room in your home
[18:58] Wherever You Are
[18:59] you are individual that the Holy Ghost
[19:02] can pour out
[19:03] and the Holy Ghost don't have to ask
[19:05] permission from anyone to pour it upon
[19:07] you or to bless your life
[19:09] or to cleanse you or to purify you or to
[19:12] restore you or to heal you or deliver
[19:14] you God is suffering tonight
[19:17] now Jesus
[19:19] when
[19:20] he accused of victory I will know the
[19:23] story Mark 11 and in the morning they
[19:26] passed by they saw the Victory Drive
[19:27] from The Roots
[19:29] because Jesus spoke to the tree and said
[19:31] no man eat from thee so the next day
[19:33] they're checked for your child
[19:34] and Peter called him to remember
[19:36] children say master behold Victory which
[19:39] now Christus is withered away
[19:41] and Jesus and it's really certain to him
[19:44] have faith in God
[19:46] so you know we see the manifestation and
[19:48] there's a question about it a surprise
[19:50] to them look look look what happened
[19:53] it's dried up think about it your cancer
[19:56] trailer
[19:57] your disease driver
[20:00] the condition in your life leakage dried
[20:02] up God could traitor he said her feet in
[20:06] God for relation to you whosoever Shanks
[20:10] see under this mountain so Jesus give
[20:12] them the top of it spoken word Peter
[20:15] remove and beat our customers don't in
[20:17] his heart but shall believe that those
[20:20] things which he said shall come to pass
[20:21] he shall have whatever is here therefore
[20:24] I sent to you whatsoever things you
[20:26] desire When you pray so this is God's
[20:29] expectation from us
[20:32] now whatever do you desire
[20:35] we have to pray
[20:37] and believe that you receive them and
[20:40] you shall have them
[20:41] and when you start praying so what is
[20:43] condition after condition being legal
[20:45] here when you start praying make sure
[20:48] forgive if you are ought against any
[20:50] that your father also which is in heaven
[20:52] May forgive you your trespasses but if
[20:55] you do not forgive neither will your
[20:57] father which is in heaven forgive your
[20:58] trespasses don't worry about the text
[21:00] and so on so much I would I would put it
[21:02] back in the chat that'd be good you
[21:03] could look at it look back at the
[21:05] scriptures that we are sharing tonight
[21:06] so therefore praying is conditional
[21:10] if you have an old a grudge it can't
[21:12] forgive you know you you know God's not
[21:14] going to hear you
[21:16] you have to be able to drop it
[21:19] you have to be able to forgive when you
[21:21] stand praying
[21:22] so he expects to be praying
[21:25] forgive
[21:26] if you're old against any
[21:28] there's nothing wrong with having an
[21:30] ought any sense then that odds come
[21:32] people do wrong people upset you people
[21:34] hurt you people and you people rely on
[21:37] you treat you badly and so on and you as
[21:40] a human being you react
[21:42] but then
[21:43] when you come into praying
[21:45] that is when the case
[21:48] of what you have against someone comes
[21:50] into play because you won't go to answer
[21:52] your prayer you want to go to hear your
[21:55] prayer hear your voice
[21:57] so he says that if you do not forgive
[22:00] neither will your father in Heaven
[22:01] forgive your trespasses so then your
[22:03] Total Praise away some time if you don't
[22:06] prepare to forgive
[22:07] nobody problem
[22:09] you know the story about Society right
[22:11] she said the right thing
[22:13] and God told him to give her whatever
[22:16] she wanted because she pleased the Holy
[22:19] Spirit by her words
[22:20] and of time we talk about it we preach
[22:23] about it but
[22:25] um yet to see people make a conscious
[22:27] effort to speak correctly to speak the
[22:30] right thing unconscious you know
[22:32] sometimes you
[22:33] it's a temper whatever you have to take
[22:36] a hole of what you see
[22:38] because God is hearing
[22:40] and God heard them Jesus knew their
[22:43] thoughts their thoughts is allowed your
[22:45] thoughts evil thoughts even thinking
[22:48] contrary These Eyes is very very loud so
[22:50] so this is a happy right please the Lord
[22:53] the Holy Spirit spoke back and said
[22:55] Hattie ask anything that you will
[22:57] whatever you got you want find out if
[23:00] this is real or not ask anything healing
[23:03] of a crypto sister secondary ten
[23:05] thousand dollars to keep her from
[23:06] digging on the heels over there you'd
[23:08] restored to her well around nobody
[23:09] whatever you ask
[23:11] Citrus mountain and then he broke into
[23:13] something
[23:14] you see Yahoo was being taken place
[23:16] that's the ministry that we are entering
[23:19] into
[23:21] we are way up the road now
[23:23] he's prophesy I know soon the coming of
[23:27] the Lord Jesus
[23:28] and we have got to have Rapture and feet
[23:30] in a church that will be changed in a
[23:33] moment in a critical of an eye to go out
[23:36] so we're not going out on books we're
[23:39] not going out on tips we're not going
[23:40] our peace upon the church we go to or
[23:43] who the pastor is what mystery preach or
[23:45] any message that is not how we're going
[23:47] out we're going out based upon rapturing
[23:51] feet
[23:52] but he says
[23:53] or he said oh we he said oh let me read
[23:56] it again and we have got to have have
[23:59] Rapture and faith in a church that can
[24:02] be changed in a moment and treat them an
[24:04] eye to go out or we will not go
[24:07] but
[24:08] or we will not go but don't worry
[24:12] prophecy it will be there
[24:14] it will be there
[24:16] and when the power of Jesus church Rises
[24:20] without you but when as a title not if
[24:26] and when
[24:28] to tell the Devils a liar tonight
[24:30] tell that they have a discount feel this
[24:32] is the word of God
[24:33] and when the power of this church Rises
[24:36] it will bring it spiritually the power
[24:39] of that church Rises will bring
[24:40] expression the power of that church will
[24:42] bring the other president and then there
[24:44] will be a general Resurrection
[24:46] so there will be no Resurrection if
[24:48] there's no power
[24:49] so if we cannot preach power talk about
[24:52] power real equivalent Resurrection we're
[24:54] looking for human
[24:55] and I keep seeing it clear you know
[24:57] people like man-made religion because
[25:00] there's man doing it
[25:01] if they're doing it I want to do
[25:03] something they can't trust that God has
[25:05] paid the price and they receive Christ
[25:07] and receive his blood and they receive
[25:09] this pardon and receive his mercy and
[25:11] the free to access his throne and Grace
[25:13] they don't want that they want to our
[25:15] father to he'll be married they want to
[25:17] do this they want to play sharply Rosary
[25:19] they want to do so much things that they
[25:20] will think that they are doing something
[25:25] I tell you don't let the world creep in
[25:26] on you
[25:27] don't let the world get into your church
[25:29] is better and free it out
[25:32] fast it out
[25:34] until God comes down and dig a hole
[25:39] so God set up like a law
[25:42] when enemy must come the enemy they may
[25:45] not not living on the beach the enemy
[25:48] have a job to do to bring someone cool
[25:51] former lukewarm doubting questioning to
[25:54] keep us out of this Spirit look as soon
[25:56] as Christ recently dead and Peter and
[25:58] them are wrong went back fishing three
[26:00] and a half years it's promote
[26:01] efficiently combat fiction I go fishing
[26:03] and people have a whole bunch of
[26:04] followers following going man fishes
[26:05] Jesus
[26:07] they say we fish all night and caught
[26:09] nothing causing that to the right side
[26:11] The Voice spoke they go big and they got
[26:13] a lot of fish okay once man come out to
[26:17] the spirit he's in the flesh
[26:18] it's simple you have to despair you're
[26:20] in the flesh you live any flesh you talk
[26:22] any pressure we are going to flash here
[26:24] that's because
[26:26] in the spirit is a whole big difference
[26:28] so he said keep the joy of the Lord
[26:30] among the saints
[26:32] keep them prayed up that's what we hear
[26:34] tonight that's what I appreciate you

[26:37] other things God every little place if
[26:40] no one seeks see a leak in his ark why
[26:42] he put some pitch in it so that's about
[26:44] the best thing I know to keep the leak
[26:46] out the world out is to stop the leak
[26:49] the best thing I know to do the only one
[26:53] way to do it that's prayer prayer stop
[26:56] the leak Prayer Changes Things so
[26:59] there's a leak in your life and you walk
[27:01] with God and your talk with God prayer
[27:04] this prayer tonight this time tonight is
[27:07] is to put that League
[27:09] let's continue
[27:11] the purpose of selling the Holy Ghost
[27:16] was for God
[27:17] to continue to appoint a people
[27:21] continually manifest God to the world
[27:25] that's the purpose
[27:26] not by our Creed
[27:28] not by denomination so not by tax and
[27:31] and and booklets not by denomination
[27:35] church but by but by the power of his
[27:39] resurrection by here we go again making
[27:42] his world real bye here we go taking his
[27:46] promise and standing on the side of the
[27:50] minority like what we are doing tonight
[27:52] and believe in God and what the black
[27:55] Skies move back and the power of God
[27:57] moving and take over that's what he
[28:00] wants
[28:01] you mean that's what he wants to move it
[28:02] yes that's what he wants that is what
[28:06] the Holy Ghost was sent for
[28:08] eign
[28:18] that is not what the Holy Ghost was sent
[28:21] for it was sent to make this word Real
[28:24] by taking his promise his promise
[28:28] standing on the side of the minority and
[28:30] believing God I watched the black Skies
[28:32] move back and the power of God moving
[28:34] and take over that's what he wants
[28:35] that's what Holy Ghost was sent for
[28:37] that's the cool person sent it for
[28:39] that's why he sent it
[28:42] prayer
[28:45] what is prayer
[28:47] prayer is the voice that goes into God's
[28:50] ear
[28:51] how I think about that
[28:53] it's astonishing that we meme humans
[28:57] could pray close our eyes and pray and
[29:01] we could break Dimensions naturally
[29:03] mentions
[29:05] what kind of a logical dimensions and
[29:08] bring all of that and break into the
[29:10] realm of what is impossible with man is
[29:13] possible with God
[29:14] Isaiah 46 that has not now known has
[29:17] done not heard that he Everlasting with
[29:19] God the Lord the creator of the enemies
[29:21] of the good fainted not
[29:23] neither is weary
[29:25] so now we feel retired I'm telling all
[29:28] that and you know like if you're
[29:29] entirely you don't want to say it again
[29:30] and no he's not married
[29:35] there's no such thing of his
[29:36] understanding he was 29 he gave it power
[29:38] to the thing power to who the thief
[29:41] power to the feet
[29:43] and to them that
[29:44] have no might increase that strength
[29:48] even the youths shall think and be very
[29:51] and he said I call you young men because
[29:53] you're strong but thin even huge shall
[29:56] think to me very
[29:57] and the young men shall utterly fall but
[30:01] they
[30:01] bless you here tonight
[30:03] they that wait upon the Lord
[30:05] now this
[30:07] is shy renew their strength God have
[30:10] mercy give us some give God some Praises
[30:11] tonight thee that weed upon the Lord
[30:14] shall be their strength these are
[30:18] multiple things illegals they shall run
[30:20] not be wary they shall walk and not
[30:23] freed
[30:26] prayer lives
[30:28] I want you to see prayer as a living
[30:30] thing you know just stay with a prayer
[30:32] on your finger for your prayer no prayer
[30:34] lives
[30:36] I preach this before I talk about it
[30:37] before prayer goes beyond the present
[30:41] prayer can be generational
[30:44] so sometimes you are here in this room
[30:46] because maybe your great grandfather
[30:48] prayed
[30:50] or your grandmother was praying less
[30:53] like Generations that are going to come
[30:55] Bless the people that's in my loins
[30:57] bless there's that future generation
[30:59] deliver them and save them and he the
[31:02] person died and gone great grandmother
[31:04] great grandfather grandmother
[31:05] grandfather whatever but their prayer
[31:07] lives
[31:09] a person can die
[31:10] but the prayer from your lips lives one
[31:13] before God
[31:14] to be answered in a season on time
[31:17] so tonight if your hair is green you
[31:20] have grandchildren your grandfather your
[31:22] grandmother you have children
[31:25] you have the right to pray for them
[31:28] pray over them you don't know what
[31:30] they're going through right now your
[31:31] children your grandchildren
[31:33] the more you pray the more you can pray
[31:37] The More You Prayed the more you can
[31:40] pray
[31:41] ER
[31:43] this incense goes before God
[31:47] don't let the senses of prayer go empty
[31:51] perishing it
[31:53] verse 1 says and when you have opened
[31:55] the seven seal there was times in heaven
[31:57] I bought this piece of half an hour
[32:00] and I saw seven angels which took before
[32:02] God
[32:03] and to them was given seven trumpets
[32:06] another angel came stood at the altar
[32:08] having a golden Center
[32:10] and it was given unto him much incense
[32:13] that he'd offered with the prayers of
[32:15] all things upon the golden altar which
[32:17] is before the trouble and the smoke of
[32:19] the incense which came with the prayers
[32:22] of the Saints ascended before God out of
[32:25] the Angel's hand
[32:27] and the angel took the sensor
[32:29] to live with fire on the Altar and cast
[32:31] it into the Earth
[32:32] and there were voices and thunderous and
[32:34] lightness and an earthquake
[32:36] the seven angels which had seven
[32:38] trumpets prepared himself the song
[32:40] now this is judgment about the strike
[32:42] the first thing just sounded
[32:44] and they had followed healing farming
[32:46] with blood and they were cast upon the
[32:47] earth a third part of the trees were
[32:49] burnt up on all the green grass was
[32:51] builted
[32:52] isn't it powerful
[32:54] but right under the Southern Sea of
[32:57] Silence the Bible speak about
[33:00] prayers of All Saints
[33:02] upon the golden altar
[33:04] which was Before the Throne is as if
[33:06] praise taught is as if prayers is bottom
[33:10] up until the season of time to cast it
[33:14] for answers
[33:16] to intervention
[33:19] I wrote here pray as a mystery
[33:22] sinful man
[33:24] of the Earth
[33:26] can sincerely look to God and God
[33:29] answers what a thing
[33:32] what a weapon
[33:35] what a tool
[33:36] we have to take it seriously
[33:40] Angels move
[33:41] Angelic movements because a man is
[33:44] praying
[33:45] prayer
[33:47] Bridges the dimension between UT and
[33:50] heaven where did I get that from
[33:53] from Daniel
[33:55] chapter 9. the Bible talk about in the
[33:58] first year Diaries
[34:00] the son of atheros the seat of the means
[34:03] which will meet King with Realm of the
[34:05] challenges and the first year between I
[34:07] Daniel understood by books a number of
[34:10] years aware of the word of the Lord came
[34:12] the dramatic Prophet that could he
[34:14] accomplished 70 years in the desolations
[34:16] of Jerusalem So Daniel had the books had
[34:19] the quotes that he was studying and he
[34:21] understand now time running out
[34:23] what did he do
[34:25] when you see time running out and I set
[34:27] my face unto the Lord God to seek by
[34:31] prayer and supplication with fasting
[34:36] I suck Lord and Ashes and I prayed unto
[34:41] the Lord my God and made my confession
[34:44] and said oh Lord the great and Dreadful
[34:47] God
[34:48] there's no message praying now
[34:51] this is the prophet praying
[34:52] this is not praying for somebody to hear
[34:54] your praying no no this is from the
[34:57] heart
[34:58] I pray unto the Lord my God and made my
[35:01] confession I said oh Lord the great and
[35:04] Dreadful God keeping the Covenant and
[35:07] mercy to them that love him and to them
[35:09] that keep his Commandments we have
[35:11] sinned
[35:12] so he is praying
[35:14] are you not seen they have sinned
[35:18] he is part of the package
[35:20] he's identified with the shame and with
[35:22] the glory we have sinned committed
[35:24] iniquity have done wickedly and have
[35:27] rebelled even the pattern from thy
[35:29] preception from thy judgments neither
[35:31] have we Half Men to die so that's the
[35:33] prophets which speak and thy meaning or
[35:35] Kings or princes or fathers to all the
[35:38] people who Lord righteousness belong
[35:41] unto thee but unto us confusion of feces
[35:45] as with this day to the men of Judah to
[35:48] the inhabit of Jerusalem unto all Israel
[35:50] that are near that are found through all
[35:52] the countries without us driven them
[35:53] because of their trespass
[35:55] than their trespass against the Daniel
[35:58] is focused in his prayer oh Lord to us
[36:01] belong
[36:02] longer to confusion of Feasts to our
[36:04] Kings or princes to our fathers because
[36:06] we have sin against thee to the Lord Our
[36:10] God we love mercies and forgiveness
[36:11] though we have rebelled unto him
[36:14] against him neither have you obey the
[36:16] voice of the Lord Our God to walk in his
[36:18] laws which he set before his servants
[36:20] and the prophets ye all Israel have
[36:23] transgressed that law even by departing
[36:25] that they might not obey their voice
[36:26] therefore the curse is put upon us and
[36:29] the oath that is written along Moses the
[36:31] servant of God because we have sinned
[36:33] against him and you confirm his word
[36:35] which you stick against him against our
[36:37] judges and judges and bring it upon us
[36:39] the great evil for Allah the whole
[36:41] heaven have not been done as I've been
[36:43] done upon Jerusalem
[36:44] I want to skip to verse 15. Oh Lord
[36:47] according to all our righteousness by
[36:49] this history that I anger unless he will
[36:52] be turned away from thy City Jews
[36:54] the Holy Mountain
[36:55] and you could take that and put it to
[36:57] your house together put into your heart
[36:59] they don't put into your life let that
[37:01] uncomfortable we
[37:03] because of our sins for the iniquities
[37:05] of fathers Jerusalem that people are
[37:07] becoming reproached to order about us
[37:09] now therefore oh Lord our God
[37:11] he's got a No-No he had a pre-advisor
[37:14] on his application and cause I face to
[37:17] shine upon thy Sanctuary that is
[37:20] desolate for the Lord's sake oh my God
[37:24] inclined an ear here
[37:27] so our prayer tonight is to catch the
[37:30] ear of God we're not praying to the will
[37:32] without praying just words you are
[37:35] actually praying to God's ear
[37:38] you won't go to here
[37:42] oh God inclined an ear and here
[37:45] open nine eyes and behold our
[37:47] destinations and the city which is
[37:49] called by their name for we do not
[37:50] present our supplication before all
[37:52] righteousness but for your great Mercies
[37:55] oh Lord hear oh God forgive oh Lord
[37:57] happen before not for I don't say oh my
[38:00] God for thy City like people are caught
[38:02] by many and whilst I was speaking and
[38:05] praying I'm confessing my sin at the
[38:08] center of my people Israel and
[38:10] presenting my supplication before the
[38:12] Lord my God for the Holy Mountain of my
[38:14] God while I was speaking in prayer even
[38:17] the man Gabriel
[38:19] whom I had seen in the vision at the
[38:21] beginning being caused to swiftly fly
[38:23] touch me about the time of the evening
[38:25] operation and he informed me and talk
[38:28] with me and said oh Daniel I am now
[38:31] Comfort to give this skill and
[38:32] understanding at the beginning of this
[38:35] application the Commandment came forth
[38:37] and I am coming to show thee for thou
[38:39] had greatly beloved therefore understand
[38:42] the matter
[38:43] who consider the vision so friends when
[38:47] Daniel start to pray Gable was
[38:50] commissioned to go unto him he was the
[38:53] lead
[38:53] because he had to fight his ritual demon
[38:55] activity and Demon power to get to
[38:58] Daniel
[38:59] and the prophecy of Daniel had stopped
[39:01] praying the angel had to stop coming
[39:03] think about that
[39:05] think how weighty and Powerful it is
[39:08] the angel is on his way to bring
[39:12] Revelation to bring Clarity to bring
[39:15] vision and that angel is dependent upon
[39:19] a man and Youth call upon God
[39:23] and if that man only hold back and stop
[39:25] he has to stop
[39:27] so the angel frightened the man is
[39:30] wrestling with God in prayer and as he
[39:33] is breaking through the angel is
[39:35] breaking through I want to challenge us
[39:37] tonight I am included let us make our
[39:40] house
[39:41] a House of Prayer
[39:43] I'm not talking about the church now
[39:45] I'm talking about your home
[39:48] I'm talking about your body
[39:49] I'm talking about you and I
[39:52] I'm gonna wrap up in your home stretch I
[39:54] think this is important tonight
[39:56] not if but when
[39:59] the prime
[40:00] God said in Genesis 2 manner dominion
[40:04] over the world
[40:05] he gave him look me over all things he
[40:08] lost his worship one he lost his sonship
[40:11] two he lost his domain tree and Satan
[40:16] took it over
[40:17] but brother
[40:18] we are waiting for
[40:21] the manifestations of the sons of God
[40:24] who will come back and take it over
[40:27] again
[40:28] waiting for and this is drilling down
[40:30] into details now waiting for the
[40:33] fullness of time
[40:35] so in other words the manifestation of
[40:37] the sons of God cannot come outside the
[40:38] fullness of time time must come to its
[40:40] fullness or waiting for the fullest of
[40:42] time
[40:43] and then he's clarifying when that gonna
[40:45] be when the pyramid gets to the top
[40:50] now to the top is where Veronica misses
[40:53] that Faith virtue knowledge Temperance
[40:55] patience godliness
[40:57] then probably came
[40:59] on probably kindness you get in charity
[41:02] or the Capstone or the headstone Holy
[41:05] Spirit
[41:06] written
[41:08] when the pyramid gets to the top when
[41:11] she's continuing the full sons of God
[41:15] will manifest it when we manifested when
[41:18] the pyramid comes to the top
[41:19] when
[41:21] the power of God will walk out you see
[41:24] Hallelujah and we take every Power that
[41:28] Satan got away from him
[41:29] that's what you're gonna happen to do
[41:31] so we are not called to be wimpy we're
[41:33] not going to be slacker this is not
[41:35] called to be weaklings but we are called
[41:38] to this
[41:39] this is not if
[41:41] this is when
[41:42] I'm almost done
[41:46] in Oneness he said don't Adam
[41:48] Adam Eve let me cry out to you don't
[41:51] listen to the LIE of the devil anymore
[41:53] still with God's word it is thus fear
[41:56] the lord
[41:57] stay with his word to separate from it
[42:00] is breaking your fellowship with God
[42:02] God's Oneness
[42:04] by the Holy Spirit and if you say you've
[42:07] got the Holy Spirit and it's not in
[42:09] agreement with the word then you're not
[42:10] honest with God that is not God's mother
[42:13] the spirit that you got agrees with this
[42:16] word and Manifest this word and make
[42:22] this word power to act the same with the
[42:24] dear
[42:26] and then he said let's see it together
[42:29] had the congregation to see it with him
[42:32] Oneness and they say Oneness with god
[42:35] with God is to have
[42:39] to have God's spirit
[42:42] God Spirit In You in you
[42:46] agreeing agreeing with the word
[42:50] with the word all the word
[42:53] the whole word the whole word and to
[42:57] make it and to make it manifested
[43:01] manifested in power
[43:03] this is
[43:06] almost like a legal
[43:08] document or legal phrase
[43:11] God Oneness with God is to have God's
[43:15] spirit in you agreeing with the word
[43:18] not just with the word all the way
[43:21] not just all the word the whole word to
[43:24] make it manifested in power there you
[43:28] are that is one is for God when that
[43:31] power Works in me it begins Clarity
[43:33] itself Works in you we are one
[43:36] when the power of the Holy Ghost In Me
[43:39] Works in you there's no disagreement
[43:41] the word is there it works it make it
[43:44] what it is God made flesh in You by his
[43:48] word the word made fresh
[43:53] something
[43:54] was wondering if there's a possibility
[43:58] you put his hand upon his posts and
[44:00] stood here before them
[44:02] the Philistines celebrating having a
[44:04] great time they forgot to worship they
[44:07] forgot to watch them
[44:08] and they begin to think God is still God
[44:11] I know yes I've tried to put into the
[44:13] test I know he's telling me it's called
[44:15] it is me that is wrong I'm the one that
[44:17] sinned
[44:18] they didn't notice the tears running out
[44:21] of them blinded sockets tripping off his
[44:23] chin
[44:25] he didn't notice his lips moving you
[44:27] know what I've done wrong
[44:29] let me die with the Philistines
[44:32] so here's another human being now
[44:34] here's a man who
[44:36] we will say pay for his sins report he
[44:38] sowed
[44:39] but he's about the utter words
[44:42] they're going to break dimensions
[44:45] it's about other words they're going to
[44:46] get into the ear of God
[44:48] listen to this he wanted God word
[44:51] manifested before that Jesse now oh
[44:54] Danny wanted his own life oh if that
[44:57] desire could come into the church again
[44:59] he wasn't paying for a new order a new
[45:02] denomination but the word of God might
[45:05] be made known again the promise that he
[45:07] once had I come back to him again he was
[45:10] aware of what would happen if his prayer
[45:13] was answered are you aware
[45:15] what would happen if God answer your
[45:17] prayer he was ready here we go
[45:20] he was in deadliness oh if the church
[45:23] could really get like that then he cried
[45:25] out
[45:25] slowly he was praying it's possible Lord
[45:29] it is possible
[45:31] and I want you to pray that tonight if
[45:32] possible God could heal you tonight
[45:35] it's possible delivery tonight it's
[45:38] possibly your homework free tonight it's
[45:40] possible the enemy that ramping through
[45:43] your family could be rewarded tonight
[45:44] it's possibly stand here with my big
[45:46] friend I'm here my ears rolled out I
[45:50] couldn't see how to whip them no more
[45:51] because my eyes is blind I couldn't see
[45:53] where I was going but it is possible
[45:56] you could let it happen again you're
[45:58] through your poor then you scream out
[46:01] once more Lord just once more just once
[46:03] if the church Glory cried out once more
[46:05] let us see your power once more and as
[46:08] he cried and after God I can see them
[46:11] muscles begin to swell every five and
[46:13] his body begin to twist the Holy Ghost
[46:15] was coming upon him then
[46:17] he stretched for his hands again with
[46:20] the power of the Holy Ghost upon him
[46:21] down went the building he killed more
[46:24] than they that that day that he didn't
[46:26] always satisfied it has always been that
[46:29] way when the power of God come the big
[46:32] destructive isn't full
[46:34] amen
[46:35] and this is final
[46:37] I'm going to spend some time tonight
[46:39] but I think I just felt that I wanted to
[46:41] get this in tonight or Brandon
[46:45] winner Atomic bombers and people are
[46:47] scared in the Pentagon they don't know
[46:49] what to do
[46:51] he says
[46:52] let the people
[46:55] speak about us tonight let it at the
[46:57] flock that little Remnant that God will
[47:00] give him talk about that Elijah
[47:02] calling out to God Watch What Happens
[47:06] so all this here we are getting enough
[47:08] pressure yet
[47:10] I'm gonna sound strange we haven't had
[47:12] enough yet
[47:13] that way I prefer to come down here
[47:16] there will be a national shootout there
[47:19] will be a power that they have never
[47:21] seen before the trouble of it is this
[47:24] time is going to be too late for them
[47:26] then doors will be closed remember we're
[47:29] at the end time pray
[47:30] so friends we're not looking for the
[47:32] government that come on cruises don't
[47:33] want to be hiding because we believe
[47:34] this message that is not what I see in
[47:36] here
[47:38] there's a prophecy hanging over us
[47:40] that we will go to call not in God
[47:43] when your bills are being paid you're
[47:46] sleeping good at night you're eating
[47:47] food you only transport yeah garage
[47:50] sometime you want sometimes two whatever
[47:52] no Britain
[47:54] you go to church as a routine
[47:56] you're going to choose because there
[47:57] were people doing on Sunday
[47:58] as a routine nobody
[48:00] and Isaac but Isaac massively brought it
[48:03] out about that man to teach us going
[48:05] afterwards I think he gave up he gave up
[48:08] trying to enter in first he just become
[48:10] like dices Facebook what is social
[48:12] social Gathering every time you know the
[48:14] angel comes probably whatever are wrong
[48:16] now just in case something happened
[48:18] but God knew his persistence is
[48:20] perseverance God knew his diligence his
[48:22] application Jesus came straight to him
[48:24] and said well you leave whole that
[48:26] question tonight
[48:29] there are some people don't want to be
[48:30] prayed for because they don't want to
[48:31] deliver they don't want to come out over
[48:32] the end just yet you don't want to give
[48:34] it some more time
[48:35] you're not ready yet
[48:38] if you want to come out you come up now
[48:42] God wants his people to pray could
[48:44] somebody say Amen okay
[48:46] when Israel got so tucked in a condition
[48:48] that they could not go any further their
[48:50] time was fulfilled their burden was
[48:52] father and they could thought at the
[48:54] beginning to pray and when the people
[48:56] began to pray then God begins to hear
[48:58] it's time for God to fulfill so even
[49:00] there is a prophecy of fulfillment
[49:01] something has to press the people
[49:03] somebody have to press you and I to get
[49:05] us into prayer I went I'm on my music
[49:07] that sword it was time for the work to
[49:09] be fulfilled they went to pray to God
[49:11] and it is usually here we go those who
[49:13] pray is the one who got the burden the
[49:15] one who gets something is good for free
[49:17] that's what they need to do so
[49:21] last quote
[49:23] when the people begin to pray
[49:26] when Israel start praying for a prophet
[49:28] God had the prophet God had a prophet
[49:32] all the time because God always went to
[49:35] jump ahead of them he had the man
[49:37] prepared but are you ready judge
[49:40] he was waiting for the people to go to
[49:43] pray in the people to want it
[49:46] how to become
[49:48] I'm going to stop right there okay how
[49:51] typical I could say of it today what we
[49:53] need today is not a revivalist it's not
[49:55] another man to some great organization
[49:57] who can get all the groups to organize
[49:58] together all we need to do is a prophet
[50:00] sent from God with a message that will
[50:02] condemn The World God may have that man
[50:04] if the people just benefit you know what
[50:06] I'm speaking he is coming somewhere but
[50:09] the people got to want it God is
[50:14] God doesn't just shoot things down your
[50:18] throat you have to want it blessed are
[50:21] they that will hunger and tears from
[50:23] righteousness for they shall be filled
[50:25] he said and we said it in last service
[50:28] he cannot force you to be saved against
[50:30] your will he cannot heal you against
[50:32] your will you don't want to be healed
[50:34] you will feel sick you don't want to be
[50:35] saved you will be lost and go to hell
[50:37] you cannot force himself is the behold I
[50:41] stand at the door and knock you have to
[50:43] open that door and let them in there are
[50:45] the rooms in the house that close up you
