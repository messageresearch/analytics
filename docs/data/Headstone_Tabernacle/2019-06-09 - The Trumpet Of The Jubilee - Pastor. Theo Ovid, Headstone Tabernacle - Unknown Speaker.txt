jubilee for you what an another penny costs for you all the Warriors to take each other what not the attack let's all stand as you want to go into the word wanna read Leviticus chapter 25 we'll eat 13 so he does he want to write it down first Corinthians chapter 14 one verse verse eight on Revelation chapter 22 17 I like to give her the scriptures those who want to write it down could write it down it's good to go back home on this reflect back over the scriptures Leviticus chapter 25 is 8 and 13 was 8 to 13 rather we went on first Corinthians chapter 14 verse 8 revelation 22:17 let's read from verse 8 of Leviticus 25 God speaking thou shalt number seven Sabbath's of years on to Z seven times seven years which is 49 years and the stays of the seventh sabbath of years shall be unto thee 40 and nine years then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubilee to song on the tenth day of the seventh month in the day of atonement shall you make the trumpet song short all your land he shall hallow the fiftieth year and proclaim Liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof it shall be a jubilee unto you and you shall return every man unto his possession and he shall return every man unto his family Jubilee that sound that fiftieth year be unto you he shall not sow near a reap which grew it of itself in it nor gather the grapes in it of the vine undressed for it is a Jubilee it shall be holy unto you ye shall eat increased air of out of the field in the year of this Jubilee he shall return every man unto his possession let's go the first Corinthians is for chapter 14 verse 8 for if the trumpet give an uncertain sound who shall prepare himself to the battle on our last scripture from Revelation chapter 22 verse 17 and the Spirit and the bride say come let him that heareth say come let him that is athirst come and whosoever will let him take of the water of life freely let us pray father we thank you for your word and here your people Lord different Minds here different spirits and different history and experiences sitting here this morning but you know every heart you know every life you in every condition you know the needs of your people but Lord you give this message to me and put up on my heart to speak it and I pray that the Lord that the whole effect of it will be it'll be effective to their lives Lord speak to them Lord and may they leave your change and transformed in Jesus name I ask it amen you may be seated so last week we had another year of jubilee and then judgment that that's coming this morning our title the trumpet of the Jubilee that's a title the trumpet of the Jubilee and I'm an inspiration come back to your original inheritance to a real Holy Ghost again come back to your original inheritance to the real Holy Ghost again so you love him this morning so I want to take you on a trip on a journey I want you to forget about you forget about your past forget about a history and trying to see if you could listen to what God is speaking because God has to speak and he's the boss what he says is truth whatever the word speaks to you that is the truth and that's what happened with the sign efficient woman with the daughter of x2 the devil Jesus said is not fit to take the church bread and cast as a dog and she's a truth Lord because real faith acknowledges the word to be truth because God knows what is in your heart you you have ideas and I want you to think your needs are but God really knows what you have need of so I want you when you hear a word and you receive the word set fruit Lord say Amen Lord so I believe it I receive it that's what God say you're accepting it say if God say you are free you are free if God say you I deliver you I deliver in court say your paths are go on your chains that fall it's fallen if God said you are forgiven you are forgiven doesn't matter what happened last night last year last 20 years it does not matter you have to listen to what God is telling you I don't care what the boss say what the neighbors say what believers say what people say has none do with them has to do with what God's saying to you when Jesus told a woman woman go and sin no more you are free woman he said you are free nobody could change that and who the son of man said free is free indeed you could call me a chain up and tire but God could break that off for you it doesn't matter who looked at you and hold and looked at you doesn't matter although he came to set the captives free he came to open up the prison doors he came to set as liberty them that are bruised God don't want to bomb Gordon won't you tide Gordon want you in Chains God wanted at the libertine because we are coming to the glorious liberty of the manifestation of the sons of God okay the Lord a shout you were born to be free glory not born to be comforted by demons and demonic oppression you are born to be liberated the woods are full of demons and Satan think that you belong to him all glory to God but he came to set the captives free we were once captives but Jesus came to free us from our captivity let me see the praise God Oh glory to God what is the Jubilee a Jubilee is a year of emancipation and restoration kept every 50 years so if somebody run poor we could read it and they fall in trouble and they couldn't pay their bills they stole into slavery you could only serve that slave master until they of Jubilee if you get money or some rich uncle come and redeem you they could deliver you and pay your bills and take you out but if you can't be if you have no money you have to wait until the and when they LG will become the instruction by God what's the song a trumpet throughout all the land nothing one corner throughout all the land nothing one little corner you have a play that you leave a private trumpet but says song is out 12 all the land that you could go free God's law said that that territory only horner so much and no more and become to detect this morning another Jubilee we are gonna suffer trumpet this morning a Jubilee trumpet and you are going to go three could we get our house Oh hallelujah so this Jubilee is a year of emancipation hallelujah emancipation is freeing someone from slavery but it's not just emancipation it's not just freedom is restoration also because God said you shall return to your family you shall return to your possession you shall return to what you lost doing a shout in the house blowing oh god you lost a health you lost your strength that mean you're gonna be healed you lost your fire your losses heal it's gonna come back Oh glory to God hallelujah you are going to return to it may be seated for a Branham from Revelation chapter 5 he said now Ephesians 1:13 14 Poehler's we have an illness of our salvation the illness of our Redemption for it is the Holy Spirit that is the earnest of our Redemption the next few weeks of teaching will all be based upon redemption upon Redemption not justification it is based upon Redemption not upon the millet Oriole office of intercession but upon redeemed and inheritance that was lost or forfeited has been redeemed back to us again and how it all come about how God handed before the era was a world and home security Church is anchored so what we preach in is based upon redemption not salvation we're not talking about yourself you're not even talking about if you're worthy or not because this question comes to your mind you are unworthy because this happened that happened and you feel here and you feel here and you sin here and you did this year we're not talking about that we're talking about what God has redeemed you back to not what you feel but what God has said because Peter and James and John and all these brothers didn't know that their name is on the book they didn't know they were chosen they thought they were fishermen they thought it was just fathers and uncles and grandma tell it is but Jesus called them to show them a higher order to show them the higher purpose to show them that God ordained them into this glorious work in the last day Oh hallelujah the same God that's called Peter the same mother called Andrew at the same God I call you not a new God not a different God the same God okay the Lord I show not a different God the same God for glory of God and every issue he had his people and every house he left so he had to find them in every age Oh glory to God so blood had to cover every age Mircea to come here eh are we gonna bring a big word to you Chris to come to every age because it's by grace he was saying oh is it grace what the jubilee is the Jubilee is God's Chris Ivery stalling you the way of ones was before or kept the Lord I show more we rely on our sense of money [Applause] [Music] [Applause] no let me see no price to pay justice trumpeter here if you hear the trumpet you could go free and this Jubilee Oh hallelujah praise God so the Prophet said you have got our feet and that's my purpose of doing this for the church here is to give the believers faith and confidence in where what they are standing for because it is the word of the Lord there as long as true the scripture is a sovereignity place I'm Genesis to Revelation back and forth up and down not a way for the devil to move in the anywhere then you've got perfect confidence you know where you are standing no last week Sunday I read from this year where butter Mama's talking about seaton is the squatter and you know after a while he'll be cast in a lake of fire and all who wishes with him but the heirs of salvation will come at Christ now he is a squatter so you don't have to walk around will I give you squattin he's a squatter you are the rightful heir of the earth you really belong even sicknesses in your body he's rotten because that already belong there he could do that give a disease and cancer tumor and stuff that's his job our job is the casted out our job will endure except what he said he playing FedEx he playing mailman trying to deliver to you all kind of stuff and say hold that hold that hold that we our job is to keep that keep that keep that come on come on Sheba preach Matheny somebody he wants a plain mailman and serve you and all kind of meals that you didn't send for your job is a sell it back Mack return to sender I'm not holier than I take in it or glory the court is oppression return to sender this frustration return it back to sender Oh hallelujah this negative atmosphere return it back to sender oh I belong in heavenly places you're gonna revive stick war is hallelujah I'm reading you you're going with me now let's go for this ride now remember in the Old Testament if a man loss is inheritance and a squatter come on the land you lost it you couldn't pay it you have to leave it in something when you can't pay the bank the bank a buddy property nobody is on it but your cap a cap is not yours some squattin gonna live in it he lost it right now what this here is he could not hold it any longer from the owner until 50 years so that mean if the lawsuit and 40 years pass in or loss it and ten more yesterday Jubilee is only ten millions original if you lost it would have six more months - did you believe you reassess one want original but what if you lost it and yours 24 more hours to be Jubilee that might not only hold it for 24 hours because once that trumpet sound once that jubilee suck it means you either said give me back comfort this is mine where you're going with it according to God's law or glory no good according to God's law you have to give it back hallelujah is your ego in that note so when they come to your children will you ever say sit down give it back I woke up my son I wore back my daughter way I think you're going with them then drugs they smoked and they're doing this wait till you go in are coming back to them where is your anointing coming from where is your inspiration coming from revelation 22:17 and the spirit and the bride

heard the voice of God free you from that banner ad or give the Lord a praise offer and now look at you now glory to God hallelujah praise God praise God Oh hallelujah hallelujah coming to know who you are and coming to know who you are and what your inheritance is maybe sees it it has to cover the whole thing you can't just be seen we talked about we team to be a team is to bring you back to where you were before God original purpose its amount of Dominion and power according to Genesis 1:26 let us make man in our image likeness and let them have dominion let them have power but man fell from that man is still man still achieving in the natural in science in technology - stayin on a cave and trying to have some kind of we call it coconut branch reach true from what not mana travel not

prison guard while the windows was being riddled with bullets and rifles and the bullet struck the woman's dress and fell to the floor without ham in her holy ghost nikka bulletproof then police had a

here finest c-span I reached boy Wow persecution always give strength to the church we have had it too easy usually even disappear we get shot full we get to a place where we don't want to move on because here why everything is handed to us it takes sorrow and tears and sweat and prayer and faith and promise to move forward in the power of the Holy Spirit see this is a path this filter people who own church and people who really want a reality Caracas not a gift that's white which sharpeners doesn't make sense something because if you get any worry of the day it just coming to kill you the trials coming to set you up because one want to use you and he can't use you as you are you have to be repackaged and to be repackage you have to sell it to a process so the part I want to share to you and you don't want to be shaped you don't want to put us wheel you say you like yourself as you are this take me and I am no God want to use you and he has to mold and shape you to fit you right because he is a program you have your own you know but he has his own too Paul before he was Paul was soll he had his program his program was to persecute Christians he had seal he had knowledge he re enthusiastic he had the fire and he got permission to persecute them and he goeth left us to catch them give me the names I want the names onion pizza one find them nobody asked every volunteer so he only voluntary admission to conquer Christians right near high-horse fire hit him because God had plans with power hit them because quarter inches and that man called Saul because God knew he will profit God knew his name will change to Paul god call him and go out to arrest him I assured him that man different and when God finished with you you'll be a different man you are going to be changed so I am prophesied over your life you'll be a different man than you over the past 40 years or 30 years or whatever you'd be a different man God will change your walk and change the talk of change your life we do a much sign you know all of a sudden might running for president in America right now he might a man and he on the tablet and he wound up in pools it's back to Sodom again and they bawl with it and if they bawl with it we have to be born with our testimony because the prophecy spirits don't die it have a time for spirits today just as when the Sun nor the spirits coming back so as generation comes free stuff upon them Michael Jackson borne by the demon that was upon him following somebody else or glory to God so God want to release that spirit there was a pond or turns upon Enoch there's a pond Sampson there's a pond Chester elefantes it does upon Joshua you want to lose that sprit upon you because every age had suspicions the Spirit of God upon him Oh glory to God we believe that and God called you to be a warrior of the faith in this hour I believe that around my heart you call for something higher let's see we could wrap up here oh my it takes sorrow and tears and sweat and pray and feet and promise to move forward in a pot holy spirit that's zealand power that they had in those days as a long time vanished out of the assemblies I'm afraid of the windows were shuttled tonight people run everywhere never come back again you know when we got everything so easy we just slip along and the first thing you know we go on out losing or inheritance did you notice as you read Leviticus 25 gone if you have read it that if a man brought a property property inside of a walled city he had wanted to redeem that back if he sold it if he did not redeem that back that property it was inside of the wall at the stadia it could not go free individually it was bunk to stay there they will go over a wall because song the trumpet it couldn't go free and I'm afraid why this is all the old-timers preach against organizing ourselves together we turn around and done the very same thing in a walled city I'm afraid too many of us Pentecostal people have got walled into some denomination if is the open field they could hear the trumpet I'll go free but then wall up churches and whatnot trouble oh my the one that was walled in never got to go free they were born slaves the rest of yet Walden see three Oh hallelujah praise God amen glory watch this part now if a man become a servant and he bought a brother no a brother could be redeemed by a kinsman a kinsman could come and get him in the year of the Jubilee could redeem him what a beautiful Christ picture how how a pilgrim sold out the organization but a kinsman brother that's you I'm talking who knows he's out there some night put his Bible on this ham and go after him a kinsman because he got the same spirit he's born of the faith family go call him out of that group so there are people that will be call out of groups my kinsmen say you're not quite a wolf another organization you're not going to labor for that group we comment to call you to work for the kingdom of God people serve in church is not the kingdom Oh hallelujah now a man and his family could go back to the original heritance if they could hear the jubilee trumpet song and know what it meant to them now if they heard the priests song the trumpet the minister the trumpet is the gospel when they hear it in the north means and in no other inheritance no matter what they lost how far they went back whatever they had to do they had the privilege to come and receive inheritance the whole family could come whole family the whole family say whole family again one more time whole family whole family come whoever could come so this is not you know waiting for the chief citizen or they'll be fine my dear family did not the foolishness become utter foolishness you judge in the orientation enough for you to do your duty is a short because the Lord gives you the city your treatise the praise and worship God glory to God and this is where I got inspiration from but Aram said so it is tonight men of Louisiana to

somebody says instead of God say the Lord he said this is the of Jubilee come back to your original inheritance to the real Holy Ghost again remember he could go free he didn't have to pay nothing didn't after do nothing just get up and go so you walk in here like a sinner are you live here like I seemed did you yell at your walking in at the sinner and you leave a like a sin because you're free Oh glory to God nobody can tell you cash out nobody can tell you the cat praise God they have to be crazy or give the Lord a shout in their house [Applause] all they had to do is to go back if he
