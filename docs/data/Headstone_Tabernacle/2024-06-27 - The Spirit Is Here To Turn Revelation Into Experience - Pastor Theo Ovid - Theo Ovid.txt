love you and we love you father we're here to serve you with all our hearts bless your word tonight as we approach it in Jesus name we ask it amen and amen God bless you thanks for coming welcome uh will like turn our Bibles to Matthew chapter 16 we want to read verse 13 to 18 and we want to read Acts 2 1-4 and 12-8 for scripture reading this tonight so reading uh Matthew 16 reading verse 13 when Jesus came into the coast of cesaria Philippi he asked his disciples saying whom do men say I the son of man am and they said some say thou John the Baptist some Elias others jeremias one of the prophets he said unto them but whom say ye that I am and Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou Simon B Jonah for Flesh and Blood had not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven and I say unto thee that thou art Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it acts chapter 2 one I read 1 to 4 and then we go to 12 and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord in one one place and suddenly there came a song from Heaven as of A rushan Mighty Wind it filled all the house where they was sitting and they appeared unto them clothing Tong note a song they could hear it note that there was a wind they could feel it note that there were clothing tongues like fire they could see it and they appeared unto them clothing tongues like as a fire and it sat upon each of them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and begin to speak with other tongues as the spirit give them utterance verse 12 and after the people started respond and Peter said and they were all amazed and were in doubt saying one to another what mean it this go is something new others mocking said these men are full of new wine but Peter standing up at the 11 lifted up his voice and said unto them ye men of Judea and all ye that dwell in Jerusalem be known unto you and hearken to my word for these are not drunk as he supposed seen is about the third hour of the day people don't drink around that hour but this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel that it shall come to pass after in the last days said God I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams and on my servants and on my handmaids I will pour out in those days of my spirit and they shall prophesy may God bless his word you may have your seats praise God thank you Lord Jesus it's good to be here tonight I feel the anointing right off the scriptures right off the word and it's a good thing to feel that kind of a way praise God so this message is not disconnected from feelings and from the wind and from the seeing the the fire and everything else no it's it's right there in the word okay so I have a title the spirit is here to turn Revelation into experience that's the title the spirit is here to turn Revelation into experience all right let's go brother BR God did not intend for the church to be governed by intellectual or by any Theology of man but the Holy Spirit was given to the church to govern and control the body of Christ so he said no matter in doing that with that in mind in God's program we will never be successful no matter how good our intentions are until we get back into the center of God's program where the holy spirit so the holy spirit is the center of God's program it's not man now man could speak and it don't have to be the Holy Spirit but what you want to see is the holy spirit in operation right realizing this is no new thing to preach on it is something that's been preached on many times but but the way we approach it and the way we take it we take it still thinking that it's a holy spirit control and yet we put our intellectuals mixed with it and then we get a conglomeration of both Holy Spirit and intellectuals and when the Holy Spirit desires to do a thing and degrade something or lift something up it causes petty jealousy among the people which proves that they haven't got the holy spirit so petty jealousy evidence absence of Holy Spirit every man would want to be in his place and in this the people has a reason because they see so much denominational so many different dictators so when I talk about dictators is here you know he said the spiritual dictators in the church to say thus and thus and I call it message popes but the Holy Spirit has placed each one into the body of Christ and we are helpless to maneuver without every member of our body so the nose can't feel led to go off because he feel to smell something different and the eye doing this and the Hand doing this is a body and you want every part of that body isn't that right we have so much what we have to have my hands my arms my mouth my eyes everything that me now when you begin to see this the way God see it you recognize men acting stupid and foolish to try to break up the church and try to say I have it you don't have it and read better more revelation and God With Us and all kind of foolishness you recognize how Petty it is because it's a body of Christ it's an international body and by one Spirit no man can put you in by one Spirit you are baptized into that body no church could put you in no man could put you in the kingdom is preached and Every Man Press their way into it oh give the Lord some Praises that's how God set it up he set it up that we press our way into it okay let's go watch everything that's in me are in me has to operate to make my body function properly then if God wanted his body the church to be governed by his Spirit there's got to be some way or some program that we have got to enter into that but that we ever had that we already had he said now Ezekiel says God speaking he said now watch um he said a new heart I'll give you I'll take away your Stony heart a new spirit I'll give you he never said he have a facelift to the old church he would have a new thing br you and in doing this yeah here we go in doing this you can't mix an old intellectual church with a new Pentecostal experience Church there two kind of churches there we not talking about Pentecostal denomination because true Pentecostal is an experience so the Pentecostal experience you can't mix it with intellectual it's two different things Al together oh glory to God are you with me so Jesus Tau the same thing he said you cannot put new wine in Old bottles Oh Glory to God and the bottle was the animal skin that was tanned and sewed up and and so on and the new wine when you put in it it when the skin get old and dry lacking oil it will burst because wine have an energy in it isn't that right wine doeses does expand that's what Revelation does Oh Glory to God and that's what's lacking right now the the Revelation brings stimulation Revelation is for is for for new wine skins oh give the Lord some Praises that's why God can't send so much of Revelation you know because the skin too old the skin too dry and you don't put wine in Old bottles so God had to get new bottles to put this new wine because new wine coming these people are not drunk as you suppos oh give the Lord a shout feel good tonight but this is that that the prophet Joel speak of because Joel prophesy that there's new wine coming and we are saying new wine is coming Revelation is coming not knowledge not intellect not understanding but Revelation oh give the Lord a shout it wasn't the word that Peter confessed the the Christ that wasn't the key you know the key was he heard from Heaven oh this will make you shout tonight that was the key the key was he heard from Heaven Flesh and Blood ha not revealed it unto you but my father Oh Glory to God and Upon This Rock I will build this have not with brother and his son tabac no I will will build Hallelujah my church so Jesus have a my church this is not my church this is Oh Glory Oh Glory to God I don't have no church but Jesus say Upon This Rock of Revelation I will build my church and more than that the gates of hell can't Prevail against it so if the Gates of Hell Prevail it must not be his church oh give the Lord a shout preach back to me somebody if the gates of hell is banging and busting down and ripping on the church that is not his church because this church he talking about this church that is built upon Revelation the Gate of Hell cannot Prevail fight with it but can't overcome it fight up with it but can't defeat it oh give the Lord a praise and if this rock in you if this Revelation is in you if this new wine in you that devil could fight with you but he not can Prevail over against you oh give the Lord some praises hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah I feel God want to pour some new wine out here tonight glory to God hallelujah praise God all right but brandham he said now what the great eum ecumenical council is going to have the World Church all coming under one head where Satan will be throned the last call is going out to catch the bride before she gets into death that for once she took the mark of the beast doomed she would never come out of it and that's the reason say come out of them among them my people now hatred and debt and eternal separation from God in this eeden lust fil perversion by sewing the wrong seed so the wrong seed produce lust filth perversion don't mess with wrong seed because the secret is the word is in the bride and the spoken word is the original seed and the spoken word is what came out the mouth of that Prophet that Prophet mouth was speaking Spirit spoken word that's why I don't hear ministers when they talk in their own talk let them keep the talk for theel what I want to hear is what came out that prophet's mouth a echo of the word oh give the Lord a shout hallelujah when an echo speaks it say the same thing if it say boo it's about boo boo boo boo boo boo Hallelujah hello hello hello hello hello hello that's an echo saying the same thing and we have a word the spirit the prophet and the bride will say say shout it out the same thing and what they say will already be said in the word Give the Lord I shout I'm not moving from that no man can move me from that the spirit the prophet and the bride will say the same thing oh glory to God we C say something different I'll say this way the spirit the prophet and the bride in India will be saying the same thing the spirit the prophet and the bride in Nigeria will say the same thing the spirit the prophet and the bride in Trinidad will say the same thing if they go to Canada the spirit the prophet and the bride will be saying the same thing if they going America oh give the Lord I shout the spirit the prophet and the bride will be saying the same thing we can't hear a different message in Trinidad a different message in Nigeria a different message in US it have to be the same thing God has sent 10 prophets he sent one Prophet behold I send you Elijah the prophet of God and he shall turn the hearts of the children not he and a man not he and his son not he and somebody else he shall turn the Hearts by revealing every mystery this alone is the ministry of that angel not he and another man to reveal more Mysteries liars deceivers deceitful workers he that's his ministry to reveal every mystery every mystery has been revealed it hasn't been revealed to some people but it has been revealed on books and tapes and it is to be revealed to the bride by the spirit this message could never go still you may be seated this message could never go old because the Bible could never go stale and the Bible could never go old it have depths we have not hit it have Heights we have not reached it have things in day God is yet to be revealed we need Revelation tonight I'm not talking about understanding I'm not talking about information I'm not talking about knowledge I'm talking about hearing from Heaven oh give the Lord I shout if you hear from heaven tonight your life for ever change you leave here excited you leave here stimulated because wine is not water Oh Glory to God the word is water wine is revelation Give the Lord a shout wine have stimulation with it wo why have enthusiasm why have fire with it oh have you licking your lips this thing have to be tasted nice have to be eaten nice that's the wine of God oh hallelujah hallelujah this kind of wine why think people just drink to get all the blues when you come to church and this thing had to open up to you this take the blues away you know you get stimulated by this Revelation you have this issue and family issue and you come here and get some wine you leave your drunk tonight oh give the Lord a hallelujah praise God drunk with new wine the wine of Revelation the wine of God oh it's a joy to connect with this wine but brandom say this here now remind me may have a vision I seen before I ever met the Pentecostal people of a man going around the world in white you heard me tell it many times and one come behind him sowing seeds of Discord and we see that evident in this message and what in the Garden of Eden by lust of Eve for sin the lust of Eve of sin then if Eve losted for knowledge it was sin what did the devil tell Eve God know that if you eat of this tree you shall know and you shall be like of God now all EV had to do was to confess the word eat every tree but that tree we not to touch that because God said so that's is all that's all explanation but the devil brought a revelation what the reason why he said don't touch that because you have more information behind that that God doesn't want you to know God don't want you have the knowledge of that and I am here to tell you put your hand touch it eat it so the lust that Eve end up having was for knowledge that's a big one that what about silly woman Laden with what divers lust ever learning and ever coming to the that coming in N of the truth yeah silly woman those those hands clocking around the new peacock the new new peacock in tongue all right so watch brother BR when we lust for knowledge it's a sin to do so that's a strong statement but that's the truth no matter how strong it is still the truth to lust for knowledge and understanding so what you're supposed to desire is revelation and Revelation is the spirit revealing to you therefore you have to get in the spirit you can't sit down there in your flesh your caral mind hoping for Revelation and you're not getting in the spirit that is why the devil fought worship fought the atmosphere fought the spirit and the more intellectual and dead and dry the people is in this message the less Revelation they have so we know that set of dead hens eggs ring in church because there is no life there for the spirit to reveal because for you to get prevailing power because that's what Revelation is revelation prevailing power shout prevailing power prev that's what Revelation is revelation is prevailing power so without Revelation in the church there is like a prevailing power the people know God s a prophet they know the message is right but there is no prevailing power Oh Glory to God we're going to press on we're going to press on because when the test come to God will test you to see if you will stagger or not Oh Glory to God that's what the test is about you know to see how much you going to stagger because all G is the handle the word you have a son Abraham you have no evidence he have a revelation he don't have an experience he never had a child he have he all has a revelation but God had to bring him from Revelation to experience and he had to Journey from one state to the next state he had to Journey for 25 years brother George with Revelation Oh Glory to God no experience of Isaac Revelation is what make him build the the the the the crib Revelation make him bring all the boot all the booties and everything else Revelation make him say I'm I'm I'm God is more than able without a revelation he sit down and said but this this make sense to know because I will be almost half dead already there just forget this thing God must have make a mistake or something like that no that's intellect that the right but he didn't have that he's tager not Oh Glory to God his face his faith was tested for 25 years oh let's put it this way his Revelation or the wine he had this new wine he had Sarah didn't have that why that why she was laughing but Abraham wasn't laughing because he heard from Heaven woo glory to God he had a different kind of laugh if Abram was laughing he laughing different because he heard from God God told him count the number of stars so shall thy seed be oh God change his name to give him a a covering of expectation that he will be the father of Nations oh give the Lord a shout without no children God say hold that hold Revelation until you come into the EXP experience oh give the Lord a shout hallelujah do you understand that tonight do you understand when God or asked him to offer up Isaac it wasn't a hard thing for him because you know where Isaac come from that was a miracle that was a product of his faith and you know God able to bring him back so when he was with the man he said I and the lad we going up and we coming back down and he knew he was going to offer up Isaac because he knew the God that he serve is more than able to bring back and if God could bring back Oh Glory to God we got to trust God more we got to show God we trust [Applause] him when Abraham off up Isaac on the altar the L foolish said Daddy seen the wood the fire but where is the where is the sacrifice are you tying him down and Abraham saying God will will will provide for himself that's sacrifice that the faith there you know Hallelujah God will Pro fight for himself and when he coming down I say hold your hand I know you playing Bluff you know people Bluff oh you really want me to you're bluffing if you're talking that way waiting waai on the Lord walk unbel there that a ball out Abraham twice in the knife was coming down in Abraham was he was obeying God completely you know and when he was coming out there was a ram already trapped he had to get no lasto and run behind it was was already trapped already oh glory to God to put it on the altar Oh Glory to God you want your lamb trapped you have to get up a m Mariah oh give the Lord a shout you have to climb that mountain go God don't stand up at the bottom and say Lord I want to see the ram I want to see this I want to see that that is showing no faith at all you have to climb your Mount Mariah you have to get up on your Mountain you have to put Isaac on the Altar and you're going to see that Ram right there Jehovah chra woo my Lord my Lord Brother BR today we don't try to establish the word of God in people's hearts hear this brother clar we are trying to establish ourselves this isn't the message now by some many people they know the minister off they C leave because the minister in the heart not Jesus they will kill for that man they will die for that man the man off the beaten part Hallelujah churches here we go are trying to establish the doctrine of the church Hallelujah in a person's heart we see it so that do with what God saying I know we say it so what did God say we are commanded to establish the word of God at what reading again right we are commanded to establish the word of God Paul said see he have a backing backing I didn't come to you with enticing words of man that your faith might rest on the knowledge of man but I come to you in power in the manifestation of the Holy Ghost that your faith might rest in God see if I come and tell you last night I meet an angel he was 6'2 and he hear was thing and thing and thing and thing and he tell me so and so and so then your faith resting on my testimony you didn't you see him suppose I misread supp my eye was seeing like at that time somebody seeing light upstair and light and light moving and light and light the man had a torch light light up ins inside his back pocket you and he was moving around so he Wonder know what that light is what that light is light trigger on in man back pocket roof up somebody saying P fire fire torch lightall not everything your eyes see register as the God angel Satan comes as a angel of Light one time one of them come with a robe a brother come say he's got a robe he's a special man what they say they see you have a robe and somebody see the r they said bring him to Martin Martin he want to go because Martin was the messing bring him to Martin you know when he come to Martin the disappear don't explain to me how he had the r don't explain I can't explain that like a brother come and show me a pyramid like sideways horizontal pyramid a light inside his house and I watch it so I can explain that what you supposed to do with that follow these things you can't explain I don't know who behind that all I know that is not what I I'm on I I have no authority to follow whether the pyr curves so light so it he s so he hide so what what I supposed to mean that mean nothing test the spirit how by the word they have to see what what what the angel tell them that's right that's I want to know a man meet an angel I I Hallelujah Glory what the angel say angel is say nothing well I don't want to hear nothing from you because that's a nothing talking angel that's a dumb Angel then God has send that angel God don't send no dumb Angel when God s an angel the angel have a message so if you tell me the angel only see you and size you up and get a cookie eye and get your blink eye and whatnot I don't want to hear about that angel I don't want to hear that testimony tell me what that angel say is that angel speaking according to the word because Paul said if an angel come from heaven and preach any other gospel tell him go back where he come from oh give the Lord I shout in the house so I talking to man angel angel with wings whatever Angel bring your angel and come oh get the Lord a shout in the house all the men who claim to have me angel and this Angel bring your angel and come bring your testimony and come I want to hear what the angel say if the angel speaking according to the word because when BR was in the seals he said he check what the angel told him with the word of God oh give the Lord a shout he didn't just take what the angel say he compare what was being revealed with the scriptures that's the only Authority we have to try things by the word man mustn't establish yourself they are trying to establish themselves every man I did this me I mine I'm still reading my denomination me this establishing themselves what are we preaching about ourselves or the kingdom of God and that was such a fantastic thing about brother Peter Chandler you never hear him preach about himself it was always the kingdom he was a kingdom man but Bram establish the word of God take out the unbelief and establish the kingdom of God in a man's heart and the kingdom of God cannot be establish in a man Hearts lest God me that man thus oh my all right here we go now the Greek word for Revelation is apocalypse which means the unveiling the unveiling is perfectly described in the example of the sculpture unveiling his work of Statuary exposing it to an UNL her it is an uncovering revealing what was previously hidden now the uncovering is not only the revelation of the person of Christ but it is the revelation of his Future Works in the uncoming seven Church ages now hear this the importance of Revelation by the spirit to a True Believer can never be overemphasized Revelation means more to you than perhaps you realize now I am not talking about this book of Revelation and you I'm talking about all Revelation Give the Lord a shout on that all Revelation now part of the Revelation itself is you coming to a realization or a revelation that you are a son of God so you have to get a revelation of your sunship and as a son or a daughter you have access to [Applause] Revelation Hallelujah so when you talk about revelation God talking about you as a son it's going to come to you oh my do you get that now let me say it again now I'm not talking about the Book of Revelation I'm talking about all Revelation it is tremendously important to the church and then brother quote Matthew 16 what we read and then he says the Roman Catholics said the church is built upon Peter now that's carnal how could God build his church Upon A man so unstable that he n the Lord and so on like God cannot build his church upon any man born in sin now brother George that statement is loaded that mean all them so-called Minister man and who is the Angel and who had angel with them and who up there somewhere and who revealing son of man and Son of Man Ministry and the Second Son of Man Son of Man part two part three part four and all of that all that stuff God not building Church on that God can't build his church upon any man born in sin so them guys had to be virgin born you know if they want to claim to be building Church virgin born you know because once they born in sin they are liars got to come down there low here come through here except to see it so they are Trinidad Liars Li I I can talk about Liars from other places I go to the Liars right here in this country Here Local Liars then local Liars Hall Local Liars all right so God here we go again I love this quote tonight God can't build his church upon any man born in sin it wasn't some rock Ling there God hadn't hollowed that spot it was the Revelation read it the way it is written Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it but my father had revealed it and Upon This Rock Revelation I will build my church the church is built on the Revelation and th sayth the Lord hallelujah what did the word spoken to the prophet said pick a pen and write the bride will have thus sayeth the Lord or she keeps still so what we preaching should be th say the Lord not could it be it have some solar something coming could it be what if it is what if it's not is Lotto could be a crab could be a snake could be you know you're gambling so we don't want to hear could it be could it be could it be that consolation means that could it be remember when when it had um what is it called um uh 1999 um and they say white 2K and Minister preaching white 2K and white 2K and I why on Earth is 2K I never touched that as far as I Y 2 ZK whatever that not what I preaching that that is not what promise they could do what they want out there Lucifer had to do with stuff but we have to do our stuff on this rock Revelation I been my church the church is built upon revelation of God so what's something now now how did Abel know what to do in order to offer proper sacrifice to God how did Abel know that by faith he received the revelation of the blood Kain didn't get such a revelation ahuh you mean some people get Revelation some don't exactly and he is Sovereign he revealed it to whomsoever he will so that mean he can reveal it to you tonight without asking anybody's permission and give you Revelation you could be backed in 40 years and God give her sin tonight and restore you from your condition by giving you Revelation oh give the Lord some Praises it was Revelation from God that made the difference and G Abel eternal life here this part here's this BM now now you might take what the pastor says or what the Seminary teaches and though it might be taught to you with eloquence a sweet talker boy the words come like oil out his mouth with eloquence until here we go God reveals to you that Jesus is the Christ and that it is his blood that cleanses you and that God is your savior you will never have eternal life still comes back to divine revelation after Hidden Mysteries Mysteries inside of mysteries and all kind of mysteries and this same brother don't like Mysteries but BR he said a new birth is a revelation oh the ministers love that one boy oh we Revelation they don't want to talk about experience but he also said the new birth is an experience question which one comes first both statements are true both statements are correct if we only hook up to the one saying the new B is revelation then the more we talk the more the people walk without any experience but if you try to balance it and take it down the middle you would see something Hallelujah that you never saw before Hallelujah so what something now Jude said contend for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints so the first stage of Faith which I'm talking about Abram came to the fullness of believing the first stage of faith is always a battle because you're holding on to a revelation or a promise of a truth of God that is not real to you by experience oh give the Lord a shout not real to you by experience but said so Hallelujah and you're holding on for your children and you're holding on for your husband and you're holding on for your wife and you're holding on for your healing and you're holding on for your deliverance it's not real yet but it's a fith Oh Glory to God there things you're hoping for it is not yet but it's revealed to you and you're holding on to it you're holding on for Isaac Isaac coming doctors run your the office but Isaac still coming Oh Glory to God it's not yet real to you but you're holding on that's the first stage because God said so oh glory to God and you find out many people have experiences but no Revelation so then that's there a whole tie up thing so what did God do when Jesus resurrected and appear to the disciples he didn't go to multiply bread and fish he didn't go down in the in in in in The Villages and so on just a private Ministry to do what open the understanding and open up the word Hallelujah and he was bringing them this what was telling you all along while I was with you here it is here here it is here here it is here here it is there what they were getting Revelation then he breathed upon them receive the Holy Ghost so now they have Revelation they have the Breath of God upon them as a promise that is come in my experience hey glory to God do you get it now he opened the word he open the understanding he breathed the Breath of God upon them that was not the promise that was a promise itself that the Breath of God will come upon you Hallelujah before that he said I can't leave you comfortless I'll come to you a little while the world see at me know but you going to see me at that day you shall know you're going to get an experience you hear any talk now at that day but you're going to actually experience it I am with you but I'm going to be in you oh give the Lord some Praises oh give the Lord a shout in the house so he knew that had was to come from Revelation to experience they was coming down to the upper room we give the Lord a shout in the house Hallelujah so the test of the Revelation is to see that you will not stagger you wouldn't get throw off you're not supposed to get throw off because he said Upon This Rock if is a rock hallelujah the gates of hell can Prevail against it Oh Glory to God something bigger than you something more than you you an experience your promise yet but you have a rock you have a revelation you have a new wine inside your soul God has broken upon you hallelujah hallelujah and when you finish get that approval from God now you accept your faith and send fire send fire to confirm the faith has been receive Fire come off the altar Oh Glory to God to circumcise your heart that God have received your Fai isn't that something now Hallelujah so before they receive the experience in the upper room yeah God open the understanding to the scriptures and the fold Ministry have to be able to experience not only get Revelation but experience along with the Revelation because he said the fful ministry is to pour the virtues into the people and you cannot do that by Revelation oh give come on preach back to me somebody that has to be done by experience we cannot give what we don't have oh oh this is good tonight brother let mejoy myself we cannot give what we don't have Peter said it this with Silver and Gold Have I None such as I have I give I have it I can give it and Peter give it he said get up and walk oh give the Lord a shout in the house this is coming right [Applause] back listen I am I not afraid of this you know I believe this with all my heart you know that's why I preaching it you know Oh Glory to God hallelujah virtue had to be flowing you know virtue is what Christ had you know virtue had to be flowing from the ministry you know when the touch Oh Glory to God the one with the blood issue when she said if I could just touch she just she just makes that up for yourself if I could just touch him of His Garment i' be made whole when she touched him oh glory to God she was made she was made whole Jesus said who touched me Oh Glory to God who touched me somebody touched me I had it somebody draw from it oh give the Lord oh God I can close off here right now who touch my [Music] [Applause] clothes not not not who explain anything not not he who know not who not somebody reveal anything who touch my Clos they say everybody touching you he said no no no no no somebody made a withdrawal somebody made a withdrawal and he told the woman not my virtue heal you know he said thy faith that made thee whole it take Faith to reach out it take Faith to get a contact it take Faith to draw down virtue and right on top of Faith you see virtue oh give the Lord a shout add to your faith oh give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah virtuous power hallu you had resident power at first disciples had temporary power Matthew 10 temporary powers to work with Jesus ministry but the promise was permanent power not temporary power because Judas was there under that did you hear that Judas was under that Ministry to temporary power Ministry Judas had Ministry boy if Jud had a Facebook account or Instagram you looking real good are looking real Shar so the Bible said his wife had made herself ready all of a sudden the bride turn to wife and for the bride to turn into wife she have to have an experience not Revelation to the bride you know you're a bride by Revelation the word the secret is the word is in the bride that's the Revelation but to become his wife have to experience but charity Hallelujah so charity is what's going to make your wife Hallelujah Oh Glory where is Charity at the top we labor to enter into that rest charity is the rest the labor starts at faith faith is a revelation the rest is the experience of the rest that you labor from Faith to Virtue to knowledge to Temperance to patience to godness to brotherly kindness oh give the Lord this thing sweet tonight praise God but the class this is this is good this he nice H I'm enjoying myself tonight his wife had made herself ready that means she gone beyond the revelation of being praise God bride gets into an experience a consumation the two become one and listen to what the prophet said here now from God evil age but in obedience this little fith woman that lives by FEI the Bride Watch believes the word of God obedient waiting in love what for for the promise of the age to be confirmed she is watching for it she is part of that word how by Revelation she is watching for her life to manifest that word brethren can't you see that I hope that didn't go for you the body is waiting for which is the word is waiting for the life which is the spirit Amen to confirm or make it alive so the spirit in the upper room brought the experience of all Revelations that Jesus unveiled to them when he opened the understanding and opened the word to them the spirit brought us as a confirmation so when Peter steep forward coward Peter denying Peter when he's forward and he said this is that that's right he can identify it he makes sure there is no error there not no General inspiration this is that then the prophet said what we see should make a church that would make a Revival that they we say the seven thunders of Revelation 10 is being manifested not seven Thunder Revelation 7even tunder experience seven tunder manifestation oh give the Lord a shout coming from Revelation into manifestation producing an experience Hallelujah live voices Oh Glory to God Hallelujah the body is waiting for which is the word which is the bride budy right waiting for the life which is the spirit not a spirit not Pentecostal Spirit not Luther Wesley the spirit which is the token which is the Holy Ghost itself which is the person of Christ you shall receive power when when the Holy Ghost not Luther not Wesley not the birth Pentecostal when the Holy Ghost ghost itself the Pentecostal didn't have the Holy Ghost itself they had a birth the Holy Ghost come by the restoration of the word because the word was lost through seven ages and the revelation of Malachi 4 was to gather the scattered word to tie back into the word to bring down the Holy Ghost and the entire Holy Ghost is what visited the church in the last day bringing all these precious promises that by these promises we can be partakers of his divine nature oh give the Lord a shout Oh Glory to God I am all over Hal hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah all right so she's waiting for the life which is the spirit to confirm it or make it alive that is what she's waiting for here here we go no other life will work in her so somebody say you are the bride you know they talk so they act so you are the eye and the bride you got to see yourself in the word that like sticking Pi up I'm a pi my fether next FEA and you stick yourself over over like how you have them pictures with the all the wordss and make up a bride body somebody Tak some spok books and just stick this stuff all over mix some spoken dress and and pants and like that it's bright yeah you the word all over you that's just intellect come the man who say take breath Faith just receive Faith take Breath Again hook I wish it was so easy just take a deep breath seven breaths Hallelujah and you have seven virtues I I wish it was like that but it doesn't work like that they just human there's people trying to avoid this thing called Death the arrow said this way to Calvary and people walking that way completely this way to Calvary sir you ready that's she's waiting for no other life will work in her here this part she can't come to life any other way you could preach mystery I talking about Thunder's new name the new city and could tell you how the new City built and the measurements in New City and what the angel measure and the measurement thereof all of that Hallelujah when you finish with all the measurements that still not bringing bright life this is the only way the only way only means only don't have a TR way we we move different yeah yeah you you the church that's why you're moving so the only way yes she feels it's out there she knows it going to happen and here it happens and she wakes up all right now let's look at brother brandom experience but R say any Bo is a mess is a pig pen so it's new birth but out of that death and Corruption comes forth life no seed can bring its life until it's dead and rotten then he said are you ready listen to this I stood there that day I remember as I took my test I've been days after days months after months years four five years on the streets Corner preaching the gospel trying to do what was right in God's sight and he let my wife go right out from under me my baby laying there dying I got down to the baby I said Lord God don't let my baby die 9 months old little baby I looked up and I see a black sheet coming down he even refused to hear me I will show you here what happens when a man have a revelation this is not an anointing atmosphere this is he and his God this is he and the test this is he and this is a live experience this is not a text he's reading this is his own experience he look up a black sheet he even refused to hear me why at this point he could say you know what this God I'm not him I'm finished if he said that he had no rock it was going to prove that the Gates of Hell prevailing but he didn't what he refused to hear me he wouldn't even look at me I raised up about 23 years old he had the age 23 there laid the wife in the mor he refused to hear me for her when all I had done I said God tell me what I have done if I've done wrong punish me not them I said what have I done work all day preach all night stand on the street corners what have I done tell me what I've done he wouldn't even tell me Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail Hallelujah God not talking to him black sheet he ask God to tell him punish not them then Satan come to my side he talk to God he preach him he's a servant he's a son he's a prophet and God they talking and when you see God they talking Satan see an opportunity you know I mean I feeling to talk this morning Satan come inall he said then you will serve him when one word would change your whole situation one word will save your baby but he refuses to do it he won't do it when one word and then you go ahead and serve him but Stephen this is this is a lot all the human reasoning that's right why should i serve him if he won't even as much as look down at my baby and take it all and and take all as much as I had thought I had done done for him then he would have even listened to my own baby that was the hardest temptation all human reasons had broke away why should i serve him if I can't do that much for me can't he can't do that much for me I go day and night for him he even refuses to tell me what I've done well human reason was gone when a man is born again that something in there that holds it come down to a spot when I thought where did I get her where did she come from what am I anyhow where did I come from all the human part had broke away then that real genuine spirit of God laid there I walk over to her and put my hands on her head she was suffering so bad till a little eye was crossing together I said sweetheart in a few minutes I will take you and lay you on mommy's arms out there in the M think about it a 23y old old speaking I'll bury you out here under the pine trees and someday daddy will see you again I looked up and I said God do you slay me yet I trust you Hallelujah you give her you taken her away blessed be the name of the Lord is only when you come into the test area the test field you would really see what's inside it's something to learn you can't rock back on your preaching on your ministry and your calling how long in Ministry how long in this how long you're serving how long you're Deacon how long you're Elder you can't rock back on that something have to be deeper for then all my human reason had vanished I was at the end of my road but when you come to the end of the road There Is that real spirit of God dear to take over at that time and lift you up you must be born again everything had to die away all your theology all your thinking all ever expect to be in your life everything else dies away and then the Holy Spirit comes in so when the Holy Spirit is back there and you're dying and the human Spirit breaks up all your human reasoning all your your gcsx your doctorate whatever just breaks up your soul is what coming up to God your subconscious the real you if there's nothing there what going to raise that's why when that woman when she was deceived by the preacher and when her soul when her all her reason in had to break up and her soul had to come she she said I'm lost I'm lost she recognized she was lost it too late we can't correct it on all the correction had to be made here all the repentance had to be here all all straight up had to be here oh glory to God so the spirit of the Lord is here to change you Hallelujah from a revelation huah to an experience but brandham says faith in God it's a staggering thing to many people and yet we ought to be ashamed of ourselves to confess that we don't have faith in God first there's cowards who die 10,000 deaths while they are here on Earth but hero Never Dies his memory lingers for a great heroic deeds and usually people who have faith here we go are people who have experience experience brings faith we know about faith come here and here in the word but there another side the balance that off Oh Glory to God not intellectually sitting in church there we go let me say it again usually people who have faith are people who have experience experience bring fate Oh Glory to God if David didn't step out and deal with the bear and deal with the lion he couldn't have the faith to deal with golad his experience On The Backs side of the desert he had a revelation that God was with him the god that delivered me out of the bear out of the lion will deliver me from this golad oh give the Lord a shout friends you can't be content to sit in church and just hear word word word word word you got to get something more than that oh glory to God divine revelation make a step forward it make you testify it makes you witness Oh Glory to God make you visit sick people and pray for them help somebody encourage somebody hallu glory to God glory to God let's say it again usually people who have faith are people who who have experience Hallelujah experience brings Faith so it behooves us to have an experience before faith can accomplish very much so what that tells us the message have a lot of I call that M Champions Hallelujah people only talking just talking they don't have faith to even pray for the to take thank you Lord experience Hallelujah therefore people ought to be saved first they come to God and have an experience salvation before they can approach God for healing thank you Paul had an experience yes Lord how many believes experience come by conversion how many believe experience comes by conversion what is he saying conversion brings an experience Paul Ed just switch from Pharisee to Son of God hallelujah a light a fire knock him down that was all you know God tell him blind and God sent him to the church to pray for him Hallelujah God give the church an experience because this is man persecuting them praise God and God sent him there to be prayed for Hallelujah you know what you know what it just to be that night yes this man who put Church killing people come in church blind said St if he said run out the door as as as as saw coming the one bus sh close door close door close door he coming he coming he coming he coming God testing and God testing them hallu brother coming there saw becoming PO he blind but he's ordained he's blind huj but he's elected and selected he's blind but he's a prophet that had to be laid hands on him God can't come and take away the and heal him it has to come to the church huah because the church is the body glory to God Hallelujah the blood which is the spirit was flowing through the body called the church he couldn't get it nowhere else he had to come to the church and the Church of the power and the prophet in the Church of the Living God tonight lays the power to heal the sick to take sin and throw it away oh God help me tonight Hallelujah glory to God when Paul get healed and Paul get delivered Hallelujah he G in the desert when he come back bsing rebuke him rebuking Peter rebuking Apostles and you know then Paul said if a many man think it to be spiritual let him acknowledge what I say is the Commandment of God if he be ignorant let him be ignorant no apology Jesus there a man with Revelation and there is a Manu who get experience there's a Man on Fire part of him in oil and the other part on fire he's dipping oil and the oil just moving through him Paul Apostle I rant unto Corinthians I write unto Ephesus I write unto the Hebrews oh foolish Galatians Paul on fire and there will be another book of Acts there'll be another original Branch there'll be another day of Pentecost another Dynamics to the mechanics Give the Lord a shout we have a lot to shout about we have a lot to look forward for we are not crazy we are not pray we not preaching Madness come on now brother Bram could you take some more tonight of course you could take some more that what you come to church for hallelujah hallelujah here to give you more I always loaded you know I am always loaded all right so here this now how many believes experience come by conversion if it was hasn't I would doubt the conversion a conversion brings experience amall that why some people not converted nothing happened to them let's go a conversion brings experience amen and you can't lot it to anything now this is deep sometimes it might be bring shouting sometimes it might be speaking with tongues sometimes it might be weeping sometimes it might be groaning you don't know what it is so don't try it a lot to lot it hallelujah hallelujah so you can't say I shake my foot boy you got to shake your foot to get it that is when problem start somebody have some Revelation do so do some have it so no it Happ you so thank God for you but that's not how God say you going to do it everybody different oh my watch it now because some of you had proved to be wrong with it I have seen people shout as hard as they could shout and will steal the gold out of your teeth I'm still reading I didn't make this happen I did not make this up you know you said I've seen people shout as hard as they could Shout I will see the gold out of your teeth I seen people speak a tongue like porn peas and dry C hat and honest to goodness with a chew of tobacco on the other side of the mouth and cut your throat if they could do it so there's no evidence that you can't prove it is by the life the person lives by the fruit you shall know that woo I have 13 pages and I want to end the page eight hallelujah we're almost there this one is a big one he this one question and answers does the sons of God mean Angels or Spirits from Heaven that's the person question I believe there wasn't Angels they were beings sons of God like the scripture says not Angels they were sons of godj they come from Heaven to Earth and was put into flesh not press themselves into flesh I believe all flesh is born sexual outside of Jesus Christ I believe he's the only virgin born being that ever was I don't agree with Josephus and that great historian but I do believe that there were supernatural beings that come down and took over the spirit of man I believe they are right here yet today still walking around in jville today some of them beastly lustfully ungodly spirits that live right in human beings hear these words now someday these men will die if there's another generation they will come right down on them remember God takes his man but never his spirit this is this the bomb I want to get to you this is the same Holy Spirit they receive on Pentecost we could close there tonight that I say there's no mother holy ghost in know so when a man die evil spirit right that man dead and gone the spirit spirit and him come and fall on next generation and just as an evil spirit could fall Next Generation the Holy Ghost same Holy Ghost so when the prophet said when a church is believing on the promise of the Holy Ghost is just as real as it was on the day of Pentecost when they are born and positionally born then God sets in the church pastors teachers prophet aband not a man saying I'm a pastor I'm a teacher a liar that's not the scripture that's not what the prophet reveal it has to be the ministry of Jesus Christ when they are born and positionally born then God sets in the church you believe in what the Holy Ghost is just as real Peter was a fisherman Peter was a denier Peter was a CBD but when that fire dropped upon him that was God Almighty sit down in that man heart what did sa well you know an sa you know you know I fell and I know how easy to fall and you know you had to watch that line you know you had to watch that line you know it wasn't Peter you know it was the Holy Ghost he said who you didn't light a man you light to the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost was tabac a man and they packed them out he said that coming back again oh it would be men it will be God man holy ghost dwelling in man not this talk Oh Glory to God for years I've said the message world has not seen judgment that is when men continue with doing the crazy stuff and the figure because it going on and God had touched them yet it's okay it's all right you go pass with false teachings false doctrines false Revelation false inspiration allting off off key you think they know off key after when they love They Don't Love The Truth Listen when people stop loving truth God has G them over to a strong delusion to believe a lie because they don't have love for the truth the Bible said in the last days they will not endure song Doctrine but they will Heap unto themselves teachers hallah having itching ears because they fed up here in the promises a brother tell me I preaching the same thing all the time I say yes fry egg boil egg roast egg Benedict you have all kind of way you could do eggs Hallelujah you same egg It Will Rain that's the promise of God you don't like it come back next week you going hear it again fire going and strike the bride you don't like it the seraps come from Over the altar you don't like it it going to be rea's Veil coming for you to cover you you don't like it another half of the Chinese ticket you don't like it a double portion Elijah double portion we will flip it anyhow but it comeing oh give the Lord a shout Oh Glory to God this bride will be a super race a super church not fighting up with the laws of the land and the government trying to close me which government try to close you down looking for money hallu we init how much billions of dollars they looking for money they CL on church that will the bills they want to win the election youah the other party looking for money if they can get money from the church is fine how we looking for money what are we looking for we supposed to be looking for character we're looking for the magnetism of the Holy Ghost to leave here we look to that we can glorify God let me finish here it's the same devil in religious forms that persecuted to Christ it's the same Devils that in the church today wearing long robes I don't mean the robe over their body I mean the robe on your soul hallelujah hallelujah the Bible says they have a form of godliness but will deny the power thereof from such turn away stay away from it they are still them sons of God but they in a fallen condition Oh Glory to God see what I mean brother George I'm still reading some of them are ministers some are deacons some are Elders some are Bishops just as Pious as they could be and these evil spirits deceive people right many times are very religious Jesus came to a bunch of men that was holy priest and he kept the laws to the letter and they were very religious John called them you gener vipers that is n who wanted to flee when Jesus saw them he said you are the father of the devil remember the devil takes his man but never his Spirit God takes his man but never his Spirit the Holy Spirit comes into your life and sanctifies your spirit and lives through you and gives you power to live and when your spirit goes on your spirit is kept with God but the holy spirit that was on you comes on somebody else Oh Glory to God that's why it's the all time Holy Spirit and the devil won't go near it that's the reason people fa it but it's good enough for me Oh Glory to God is this the word tonight I have more if you are born again you are alive with Christ your affection is set on things above not on things of the world but if you are born again of the spirit of God you become part of God and eternal with him then death cannot touch you when you are born again you are Eternal you can't love Mammon which is the world and love God at the same time he that loves me not keep not my sins Oh Glory to God oh brandham Tabernacle all you good people let's take inventry this is a new year let's do something get the things of the world out of us if it's still in there get rid of it people of today take all kinds of spirits they go up and take a church Spirit they even take spirits that call themselves God's spirit there's a man there a man internet but I wish I could talk to him he's called a prophet and I tracking him because he said something coming on the 21st of June after two days later he say something coming on 22nd of June right now you read 30th of June every day he he's switching I said but these Jokers and them and people following these characters Bo he's a liar you know these are part of the bunch that say Donald Trump will be elected president all kind of thing and when he elected is somebody wrong Satan is Lucifer kind of just a line spirit and amazing these people have tons of followers I say when J say foral there shall be many false prophets I didn't know so many but many many many many any false prophet shall arise both both both outside and any message because when them fellas preaching their Revelations them playing Prophet know they're not saying they are prophets you know but when they're preaching their own thing and using brother Brandon message as salt and pepper and a little shake a little bit of thing sprinkle yeah still message you know but what I bringing forth is my thing I seen that last night they preaching Moon Star they prach all kind of thing they preaching have nothing do message I said a Fluff man they say do say much excited say nothing man inspiring when you check out what you seeing and he's saying saying say when you check it out he a say nothing but he's speaking eloquently brother Brandon notice you can't make yourself please notice you can't make yourself anything different from what God intended you to be until what therefore if your conversion is only you're trying to hide behind something or trying to make yourself better person you you only playing a part of a hypocrite here we go until Christ has actually come to your life and changed you and brought you into an atmosphere that is the difference something that is happened he's talking about an experience a conversion of the heart that has changed you and brought you into another realm Oh Glory to God brother Brandon brother sister we trying to make denominations we're trying to build churches we trying to organize people educate them it's all in vain until the love of God comes in you want to speak in tongues you want to clap your hands you want to jump you want to dance you want to do certain things to make yourself a Christian you will never be until the love of God takes over in your heart and tears that middle out and makes you feel for your brother Hallelujah so this attitude this one is shock and you cut this one off you want to talk to this one what not Holy Ghost you know that sulfuric acid until the church come to that butram she's a total failure why because do I speak with tongues of men and angels though I give my body to be burned do I know all knowledge all Mysteries and have not charity I am Notting a songing brass and tinkling symbol beating iron on the side of the road is making a whole set of noise he will do the same thing if you stand after you receive the Holy Ghost here this after receive the ghost make yourself a Christian Oh you mean after still have work to do oh yes all right glory to God so even Jesus he asked the father as I close if it is possible let this cup pass because that was before him the trial nobody wants trial nobody asks for trial we don't seek trials we don't seek heartache pressure stroke mini stroke we don't seek limping breaking your foot wheelchair we don't seek those things but those things come he say he could turn your wife against you you could turn the church against you do I do he slay me as I trust him but Bram talk about faithfulness and patience go together there's absolutely no way in which to gain patience tribulation work patience how highly God regardless at working of our patience is seen in James 1:4 let patience have a perfect work Watch God's will for us is perfection and that Perfection is patience waiting on God and waiting for God this is the process of character development I'm going to close there's nobody greater than God he took a Oath by himself swearing by himself that he would confirm his Covenant swear by it he would preserve the Seed of Abraham what is the Seed of Abraham to the Gentile question you know the answer the baptism of the Holy Spirit that's the answer is the Seed of Abraham Hallelujah that's summer message the Mighty God Force I think and I close with this oh look at it you talk about now it's right the same one that come down the Pentecost is the same holy ghost that is manifested today from glory to glory and is back to original seed with the baptism Holy Ghost with the same signs same wonders same baptism same kind of people acting the same way with the same power with the same sensation it's from glory to glory hallelujah hallu praise godall I'm going to close hallu Jesus he says maybe you come to a halt before the enemy overtook you maybe there's something in your life that caus you to Halt whatever it is you still have the privilege of a conference to talk it over with him let's all stand Lord L Lord I want to be I want to be a Christian in my heart in my [Music] heart in My Heart Lord I I want to be a Christian in My Heart Lord I want to be holy Lord I want to be more holy in My Heart Lord
