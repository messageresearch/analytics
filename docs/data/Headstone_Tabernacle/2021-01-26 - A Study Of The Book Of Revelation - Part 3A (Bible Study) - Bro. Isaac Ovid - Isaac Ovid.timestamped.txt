[18:32] heard this before may we take another
[18:34] look lord
[18:35] lord maybe look until it we look seven
[18:37] times until we see that cloud like a
[18:39] man's hand
[18:40] to see that the rain is coming the rain
[18:42] lord like in noah's day that brought
[18:44] judgment but that rain
[18:45] also brought deliverance we commit to
[18:47] service into your hands in the precious
[18:49] name of jesus christ
[18:50] amen and amen and amen well it's
[18:52] certainly a great
[18:54] privilege to be here tonight once again
[18:57] amidst the the trials and amidst the
[19:00] testings and the mystery tribulations
[19:01] and the midst of persecutions and amidst
[19:03] the
[19:04] headlines and despite what's going on
[19:07] in our lives around our lives outside of
[19:10] our lives
[19:11] uh to be ready to answer the call uh at
[19:14] any point in time that caller that's
[19:15] been going on behold
[19:17] the bridegroom comment drop what you
[19:18] have and respond to the call
[19:21] so i know it is we don't take it for
[19:23] granted
[19:25] uh for for everyone to be here um
[19:28] but it is also uh uh uh reporting for
[19:32] duty as it were
[19:34] as we see the day approaching to take
[19:36] greater heed and time
[19:38] into the word of god uh and in so doing
[19:41] you will unconsciously recognize you
[19:44] know
[19:44] um there's a change taking place you
[19:46] know um
[19:48] for a few weeks now i i was having these
[19:50] shoulder pains in my left shoulder
[19:53] and you know i i made some adjustments
[19:56] in my
[19:56] diet and different things and and it was
[19:59] after a while i realized i didn't even
[20:00] realize when the pain disappeared
[20:02] but i just realized wait a minute but he
[20:05] being gone
[20:06] but it just happened as a result of
[20:09] doing something different
[20:10] and i actually didn't even think about
[20:12] it until i realized
[20:13] wait a minute the the the discomfort i
[20:16] was feeling is no longer there
[20:18] and it happened i would say almost
[20:19] behind the scenes because it was
[20:21] it was not like all of a sudden thing it
[20:23] was just as you live in your day
[20:25] i see but wait a minute it go on and i
[20:27] realized that
[20:28] as you are into the wood and and i'm
[20:31] sure it is with you the deeper you get
[20:33] into something
[20:34] you don't realize what is beginning to
[20:36] change in your life what is
[20:37] bubbling your perspective your outlook
[20:39] and you know sharing it but over
[20:42] last friday you know it has some
[20:43] challenges to deal with
[20:45] but when challenges come the more you're
[20:48] in the wood
[20:49] you get a different approach to dealing
[20:50] with challenges you get another approach
[20:52] to deal with situations
[20:53] because situation will always come that
[20:55] is life
[20:57] life is made up of situations situations
[20:59] that you could control
[21:01] and situation that you cannot control
[21:03] and you begin to realize that in
[21:05] trusting god and understanding
[21:07] how god operates and how as
[21:10] as being part of the gene of god and
[21:12] having the genetic code of god in us
[21:15] when we begin to operate like him we
[21:17] reap the benefits
[21:18] of kingdom operation you know and he
[21:20] realized that the
[21:22] things that you cannot stress about
[21:25] when the bible say cast your cares upon
[21:27] him you know
[21:29] many times i've preached it before
[21:30] people cast their case and then they go
[21:32] and pick him back up again
[21:33] but when they cast he cares on him and
[21:35] they don't worry about it
[21:36] and you walk away because it's either
[21:38] god can handle it or he can't
[21:40] so if you have the faith that god can
[21:41] handle it then why you will put it in
[21:43] god's hand and then come back and check
[21:44] to see what he doing
[21:45] with it that is the reason why when a
[21:48] doctor is operating
[21:50] in the theater in the operating theater
[21:51] they say leave your family outside you
[21:53] know
[21:55] because plenty times people want to put
[21:57] their head over the doctor
[21:59] and it's not that they know what to do
[22:01] you know
[22:03] they don't have the experience they
[22:05] don't have the training
[22:06] and they are well-meaning they are
[22:08] well-intentioned they're not there out
[22:10] of militias malicious intent or
[22:12] or desiring to do harm but the reality
[22:15] is the act of surgery or the performance
[22:17] of surgery
[22:18] is not really a pleasant thing to look
[22:20] at or experience
[22:21] and even though you may be well
[22:22] intentioned you may not have the
[22:24] character
[22:24] you may not have the mental strength the
[22:27] emotional resilience
[22:28] to be able to witness it without
[22:30] fainting without screaming
[22:32] so they say leave your family outside so
[22:34] that the professional
[22:35] can operate so that the experienced
[22:37] doctor can do what needs to be done
[22:40] so what comes upon us that when we hand
[22:42] situations to the great physician
[22:44] that we take it upon ourselves to want
[22:46] to break into the operating theater
[22:48] when he is operating on our families and
[22:51] he's operating on our situation and
[22:52] he's operating on our behalf and we want
[22:55] to say lord how far you reach
[22:57] lord you need any help you want a
[23:00] different scapula i think that won't do
[23:02] sharpening let it let me there you don't
[23:03] go that aggressive no he knows
[23:05] he knows where to cut how to cut how to
[23:08] operate
[23:09] he has all the experience he the doctors
[23:12] trying to understand the human body he
[23:14] made a human body
[23:15] there's nobody who understands something
[23:17] like the manufacturer of the thing
[23:18] there's nobody who understands your wife
[23:20] your child your situation
[23:22] your business your problem like the one
[23:24] who's cd-holting unfold
[23:26] so why not just trust him that is what
[23:28] trust is you know trust is
[23:30] is a blind kind of thing trust is when
[23:32] he could turn your back on the situation
[23:34] and say i'll leave it up to you lord i
[23:35] trust
[23:36] you your degree of trust has a lot to do
[23:38] with your ability to walk away from
[23:40] something when we hand it to him
[23:41] can i get a witness in your house
[23:42] tonight oh hallelujah that that's
[23:45] powerful i know
[23:46] your trust is being able to walk away
[23:48] from your situation
[23:49] knowing you gave it to the lord and have
[23:51] any confidence in god
[23:53] that he is more than able it is not just
[23:55] words it is a reality
[23:57] more than able to do what he said that
[23:59] he would do
[24:00] so we are here tonight and by god's
[24:03] grace
[24:04] i i don't i i think i said it in in many
[24:06] bibles today i don't intend to be too
[24:08] long with you
[24:09] um but we do have a few things to cover
[24:11] tonight
[24:12] and we are still in the book of
[24:13] revelation and
[24:16] you know my wife was asking you know so
[24:18] you know if i'm if i'm still here now i
[24:20] see
[24:21] i'll be here for a while by the grace of
[24:24] god we'll be here for a while because
[24:25] there's a lot of food
[24:26] a lot of substance in here that i
[24:29] believe for
[24:30] many who may have seen it it is worth
[24:32] another look
[24:33] and certainly for those who have not uh
[24:36] it is certainly
[24:37] worth deep study and reflection to see
[24:40] how
[24:40] god is able to to operate as we said uh
[24:43] last week
[24:44] you know like that teacup and the saucer
[24:46] from different perspectives you know and
[24:48] and and and then you see that everything
[24:50] is lined up a certain way and there's no
[24:51] accident with god and god is operating
[24:54] through his word in a tremendous way so
[24:57] uh this is part three a study of the
[24:59] book of revelation part three
[25:01] and we are just going to continue from
[25:03] where we left off
[25:05] uh last tuesday by the grace of god
[25:08] and um we'll see what god will do for us
[25:10] tonight
[25:12] by way of background you would recall
[25:15] um that we we started two weeks ago
[25:18] uh we started in revelation one and we
[25:22] we were speaking about uh john and
[25:24] john's
[25:25] journey um to being on the isle of parts
[25:28] most and and the whole experience that
[25:31] john would have
[25:32] uh that the lord would come to him and
[25:34] use him
[25:35] as his scribe and and the description of
[25:38] god and what
[25:39] uh john saw the seven golden candle
[25:41] sticks which
[25:42] were the seven churches and the seven
[25:44] stars which would be seven
[25:46] messengers to these churches and we and
[25:49] we went through that whole background i
[25:50] i wouldn't take too much time to retouch
[25:52] it tonight
[25:53] um the services are available for you to
[25:55] go and take a look at it again
[25:57] and then last week uh we spent some time
[26:00] on that first
[26:02] age and we were very clear on the role
[26:05] of
[26:05] paul as the messenger to that first huge
[26:08] age or that
[26:09] ephesus age that age that started with
[26:12] tremendous power
[26:13] um but as time unfolded it began to
[26:17] to win you know and and and the enemy
[26:20] crept into that church
[26:22] and we went through the whole unfolding
[26:25] of how
[26:26] god addressed the angel of that age
[26:28] where he first gave them credit i know
[26:30] thy works i labored i patience
[26:32] and how those can not bear them which
[26:34] are evil which is
[26:36] uh revelation two verse two and thou has
[26:38] tried them would say the apostles and
[26:40] nothing found them to be liars and
[26:42] that's the level of strength and the
[26:43] clarity and the focus and the
[26:45] desire to see the truth and not
[26:47] compromise and how they're born and has
[26:49] patience and for my name's sake has
[26:51] labored
[26:52] everything they did was for the lord and
[26:54] they didn't faint
[26:55] and and then we reached verse 4 where we
[26:58] found that corrective conversation
[27:01] nevertheless i have somewhat against
[27:02] thee because thou has left thy first
[27:04] love and we
[27:05] sort of encourage the church we raise it
[27:07] to the church you know
[27:09] about about our getting back to that
[27:11] first love and
[27:12] and coming back to that place and but
[27:14] iran made it clear in so many teachings
[27:16] that god never walks away from us it's
[27:19] not his nature
[27:20] to do that you know he said we are the
[27:22] ones who walk away from god so if you
[27:23] want to
[27:24] to find god it is about you going back
[27:26] right where you left him
[27:27] you know and through each of these
[27:29] studies you see a message repeated
[27:31] through scripture
[27:32] through scripture you know and in fact
[27:34] looking at genesis
[27:36] we see god actually went even hunting
[27:38] for adam
[27:39] you know so so the reality is god is
[27:41] looking for reconciliation
[27:43] the whole message that he braves here
[27:45] through paul was get back to you for his
[27:47] love remember
[27:49] therefore from whenzo had fallen so he
[27:51] was trying to connect them back
[27:53] from how it was from from from that
[27:56] first experience that position that they
[27:58] had that place
[27:58] you know adam adam where doe you're
[28:00] coming from somewhere that you're not
[28:02] where i left you i put you in a certain
[28:04] position
[28:05] within that position is a certain level
[28:06] of joy and overcoming
[28:08] and peace and resilience and an attitude
[28:11] of not giving up
[28:12] of not turning back uh yes you have
[28:14] rough days i had a rough day today
[28:16] but that doesn't take away from the fact
[28:18] that i understand my position
[28:19] in the planning economy of god and
[28:21] understand that these things that happen
[28:22] around our lives
[28:24] are designed is it it's like a plane
[28:27] trying to fly
[28:28] you know the plane has to deal with some
[28:30] level of resistance some level of
[28:32] turbulence
[28:32] it comes with it you know there's no
[28:34] flight i've ever been on that didn't
[28:36] have some kind of turbulence
[28:38] you know sometimes it's more turbulent
[28:39] sometimes less turbulence
[28:41] but to break past the sound barrier
[28:43] takes a greater level of effort
[28:45] and that effort that that resistance
[28:47] would create a little
[28:48] shaken you know so shaken in your life
[28:51] is part of it you know
[28:52] so we saw in that ephesus church that
[28:55] that they fell from their first love
[28:58] and they were being called to repent or
[29:00] their candlestick was going to be put
[29:01] out of place
[29:03] and and this to their credit that
[29:05] doubted hate the days of the nicolaitans
[29:08] you know and and and we kind of touched
[29:10] on that uh
[29:11] that that that the lady being conquered
[29:14] the hierarchy men in their place
[29:16] and how god hates that because he loves
[29:18] fellowship goes
[29:19] all the way back to genesis where he
[29:21] wants fellowship
[29:22] you know so we come tonight and it's
[29:24] really god won fellowship with you you
[29:26] know
[29:26] you're not here to hear me it's not
[29:27] about me it's it's about you it's about
[29:30] me
[29:30] and my relationship to god as much as it
[29:32] is about you
[29:33] and your relationship to god you know
[29:35] but over the passage of time
[29:37] and even in dealing with the smirnian
[29:39] age which we're going to tonight
[29:41] but iran went to length to speak about
[29:44] how
[29:44] god wanted to be a father to his people
[29:46] he wanted to have a relationship with
[29:48] his people
[29:48] he wanted to provide for his people he
[29:50] wanted to care for his people
[29:52] and yet in the midst of that they looked
[29:54] around
[29:55] and they saw the other nations and they
[29:57] say you know what
[29:58] we don't really want we don't want to
[30:00] lose the blessings you know but we
[30:01] really want a man to look up to
[30:03] you know and it grieved samuel when he
[30:05] heard this and god had to shake samuel
[30:07] and say listen it's not you
[30:09] they're picking a fight with it's not
[30:10] you they are turning away from it it's
[30:12] not you that they are rejecting
[30:13] they're rejecting me you know and that's
[30:16] how they end up with the kingship
[30:18] of soul and and onwards like that you
[30:20] know but but that desire of man to want
[30:22] to be led by a man
[30:24] and the the desire of some men to want
[30:26] to lead man
[30:27] that combination creates this this
[30:30] diesel iniquitation
[30:31] that separates this wedge or this
[30:33] perception of separation
[30:35] between man and god and the
[30:39] ephesians church was against that
[30:42] so all of that led to when
[30:45] you know when but ibraham would draw out
[30:47] all the ages
[30:48] there was there was a greater or
[30:51] greatest amount of light as it were
[30:52] in that ephesus age and as every age
[30:54] progressed through the seven church ages
[30:57] it came down to this last age of aw the
[31:00] seer where there was just a little bit
[31:01] of light
[31:02] which meant as every age progressed even
[31:05] as god would place a messenger
[31:07] and rebuke the age and encourage the age
[31:09] and would call out elect in the age who
[31:11] would be the bride of every age
[31:13] that spirit of the antichrist that false
[31:16] vine
[31:17] that war that started in heaven that
[31:19] fell upon the earth that was not
[31:20] pervasive
[31:21] as there was a shift from the jews to
[31:23] the gentiles is this war
[31:25] climax that we finally come into but to
[31:28] now
[31:28] jump into where we are tonight we're
[31:30] starting now from
[31:32] revelation 2 verse 8. that's where our
[31:35] start will be tonight
[31:37] revelation 2 and verse 8
[31:41] and you will see that in each
[31:44] or in all of these salutations if i
[31:46] could say that
[31:47] of every church age would almost take
[31:49] the same kind of
[31:50] structure and unto the angel
[31:54] of the church in smyrna right
[31:58] these things say the first and the last
[32:00] which was dead
[32:01] and is alive all right
[32:05] so we know by now that that angel that
[32:07] term angel is a
[32:08] divine messenger so this is not an angel
[32:11] with wings this is a divine
[32:13] messenger if you want to call it man
[32:15] angel divine messenger but it's an angel
[32:17] that is a earthly angel so it's a
[32:20] messenger a stein writer of god with a
[32:22] specific
[32:23] commission a specific authority we read
[32:26] it throughout the last two teachings
[32:28] the level of anointing and authority
[32:30] that he had so unto the angel of the
[32:32] church in smyrna
[32:33] write these things say it the first and
[32:36] the last which was dead
[32:37] and is alive and i want to kind of
[32:40] firstly
[32:41] speak here as you profit would have done
[32:43] if you spun into each age i encourage
[32:44] you to study it again
[32:45] because there's so much in there that
[32:47] you cannot exhaust
[32:49] making this part of your life and seeing
[32:51] how it applies to your daily life
[32:53] i'm very conscious that i'm not speaking
[32:55] to the group tonight this is about the
[32:57] individual now so i want you to
[32:58] always look in the world to see yourself
[33:01] and and and get more involved in the
[33:03] unfolding of this plan of redemption for
[33:05] your life
[33:05] so brother branham brought it out and we
[33:08] know it is the case that
[33:09] the angel of that sumonian church was
[33:12] irenius all right so we know it we study
[33:14] it we know it in sunday school
[33:16] paul irenaeus martin columba luther
[33:18] wesley brother random
[33:20] messengers of the seven church ages
[33:23] but i want us to understand the
[33:25] background and kind of take it a little
[33:26] slowly for a few minutes
[33:28] to just kind of see the context of it
[33:29] all right so but
[33:31] i'm saying that irenaeus was
[33:34] the messenger of this age of smyrna here
[33:37] so so this is the messenger
[33:38] that the angel that god is speaking to
[33:41] unto the angels so
[33:42] irenaeus of the church in smyrna and but
[33:45] iran was saying that irenaeus just by
[33:47] background
[33:48] because we know a lot about paul we
[33:50] understand paul we know paul's history
[33:52] we know his pedigree is a pharisee of
[33:54] pharisees he was
[33:55] trained under gamaliel we understand
[33:57] that he was he was a
[33:58] he was an academic he was a scholar so
[34:01] we have a bit of a background and
[34:02] context
[34:03] uh on paul so so to close some of the
[34:06] gap around iranians i want us to
[34:08] understand the background
[34:09] of this man of god arenas he was a
[34:11] disciple of the great saint and warrior
[34:14] of the faith polycarp
[34:16] all right so he would have been a
[34:17] student or a disciple of polycap
[34:20] and it was no doubt so so
[34:23] and and i want to acknowledge here that
[34:25] in doing a bible study in the book of
[34:27] revelation
[34:28] it is impossible i don't care where to
[34:30] read anywhere else
[34:31] it is impossible to get a perspective on
[34:33] on the scriptures and these scriptures
[34:35] without god sending a prophet there is
[34:37] no question about it
[34:38] you could study i'm academic myself
[34:41] and nothing compares to the revelation
[34:44] of jesus christ
[34:46] and the unfolding of it and the role
[34:48] that the seven star has to play in
[34:50] making these things known to us
[34:52] we cannot take credit for it god has to
[34:54] take the credit for it by sending a
[34:56] profit to tie up the loose ends
[34:57] and to make the mysteries known to us
[35:00] that we could rejoice in the clarity
[35:02] of knowing what god is talking about is
[35:04] anybody with me to tonight
[35:05] so the prophet is bringing a background
[35:07] here he's seen he was a disciple of that
[35:09] great saint and warrior of defeat
[35:11] polycarp
[35:12] it is no doubt as he sat at the feet of
[35:14] that great man he learned the christian
[35:16] graces
[35:18] and i love reading stuff like this
[35:19] because christianity has graces with it
[35:24] he learned the christian graces
[35:26] christian grace
[35:27] is is it's it's like seeing uh the
[35:30] christian etiquette
[35:31] the way of behavior there's a nature
[35:34] there's a disposition
[35:35] there's an attitude there's a way of
[35:36] operation that we're supposed to have as
[35:39] a christian
[35:39] so he's saying that iranians no doubt
[35:42] would have learned
[35:43] christian graces that flowed from the
[35:45] consecrated life
[35:47] of polycarp so polycarp had a
[35:49] consecrating life and was one of the
[35:51] truly
[35:52] illustrious scenes of all ages when
[35:55] viewed in the light of a blameless life
[35:58] so by the branham with the eyes of a
[36:00] prophet with his seeing eyes and with a
[36:02] revelation of god that he was allowed to
[36:04] access
[36:05] and with growing and hunting to find and
[36:07] to pull the pieces together which his
[36:09] ministry was entirely loose ends
[36:10] was able to look and see the blameless
[36:13] life of polycarp
[36:15] and the influence that that that
[36:17] polycarp would have had on irenaeus
[36:19] and the reality when you see something
[36:21] like this it may seem simple
[36:22] but the reality is the people around us
[36:25] have an influence on
[36:26] us so before we get into the deeper
[36:30] things
[36:30] the people around us have an influence
[36:33] on us
[36:34] and we have to be very careful who
[36:36] influences our daily decisions
[36:39] because who influences you
[36:42] will either help bring you closer to the
[36:44] lord or further away from the lord
[36:46] all right so i want to i want to make
[36:48] that point who you spend
[36:49] time with all right so in reading
[36:51] there's some people who say well i
[36:53] didn't expect but isaac to go there but
[36:54] i'm looking at these small things
[36:56] because i believe in god details matter
[36:58] you spend your time gossiping and
[37:00] spending time on politics
[37:01] and spending time on the government and
[37:03] these things you may become very
[37:04] knowledgeable and proficient in these
[37:06] things
[37:07] but that doesn't bring you closer to the
[37:09] lord
[37:11] what influences you influences your
[37:13] speech
[37:14] your action what you're interested in
[37:16] what you're interested in finding out
[37:18] about
[37:19] and and and and it has to be clear to
[37:21] you that you
[37:22] have to love the things that god loves
[37:25] hear the things that god
[37:27] anything that god hates so so there was
[37:29] benefit
[37:30] or there was virtue by reason of
[37:33] iranian's relationship with polycarp
[37:36] so i want us in studying this and this
[37:38] is what i say it has to become personal
[37:40] to us
[37:41] check your influences who is influencing
[37:44] you
[37:44] because we are not our own jesus came
[37:46] and he influenced peter he influenced
[37:48] james he influenced john
[37:50] and we would see here but abraham said
[37:52] that polycarp was
[37:53] influenced by john so we could
[37:54] understand the the pedigree
[37:57] understand the lineage of where the
[37:59] influence was so so
[38:00] john influenced polycarp polycarp
[38:02] influence iranians
[38:04] all right so so who is your influence
[38:06] and and and flip this script how are you
[38:08] influencing others
[38:10] many parents say well my child doing
[38:12] this or my child doing that or
[38:13] my son doing this or my daughter doing
[38:15] this and but but what what role are you
[38:18] taking
[38:19] are you giving the kind of christian
[38:20] graces that polycarp would have given
[38:24] because if polycarp didn't give the
[38:26] christian graces and
[38:27] the demonstrated kind of a life to
[38:29] iranians what manner of man would
[38:31] iranians have been
[38:33] so i want us to look at these small
[38:35] things so that it could help shape our
[38:36] lives and that
[38:37] we can take a greater responsibility of
[38:40] our day-to-day work
[38:42] anybody with me tonight but abraham goes
[38:45] on
[38:46] and and you see other state i don't want
[38:48] to be too long but then i get excited
[38:49] but the battle goes on he said you will
[38:51] remember from your own reading
[38:52] that polycarp was mattered you know what
[38:55] a matter is right
[38:57] somebody who who would die for a cause
[39:01] and and there's a stir because of that
[39:03] debt so so polycarp
[39:05] in the in the economy of god you know
[39:07] was a disrupter
[39:08] he was disruptive you know
[39:12] martyrs are known for stirring up think
[39:14] when they die they actually cause
[39:16] more problems in the dead sometimes than
[39:18] in their life
[39:19] because they could stimulate a movement
[39:22] anybody with me
[39:23] all right so you remember from hearing
[39:25] that polycarp was mattered listen to the
[39:27] description
[39:28] and i look at it to say lord what men
[39:30] what
[39:31] what you know we sing that song it's
[39:32] dripping with blood
[39:34] this gospel is dripping with blood he
[39:36] was too old to flee this is the
[39:38] description of polycarp
[39:39] too old to flee and too sincere a man
[39:43] to allow another to hide him so he
[39:46] couldn't run he was too old to run
[39:49] and he was too honest too sincere for
[39:51] anybody to hide him and then have to
[39:53] suffer the penalty for hiding him
[39:56] this is our history this is this is
[39:58] bride history this is church
[40:00] history this is how we get know what we
[40:02] get because if this didn't happen we
[40:04] wouldn't have
[40:05] anybody with me if this didn't take
[40:06] place we wouldn't have this
[40:09] people know the history of what kind of
[40:10] thing i remember in school i learned
[40:11] history of shakespeare and he would
[40:13] share christopher columbus
[40:14] i'm not going to dig into him and nobody
[40:16] taught me in school about irenaeus and
[40:18] paul and martin and thing but thank god
[40:19] for
[40:20] a prophet who pulls things together so
[40:22] we can know our true history
[40:25] so polycarp was too old to flee he was
[40:27] too sincere
[40:28] for somebody to hide him and then
[40:31] sometime afterwards there's retribution
[40:33] behind him
[40:34] all right so he gave himself up to death
[40:37] right is there anybody willing tonight
[40:39] to give themselves up for debt for this
[40:41] gospel
[40:42] hallelujah
[40:46] glory hallelujah
[40:49] i've seen some volunteers and no behind
[40:52] these cameras
[40:53] it have to have some volunteers who
[40:56] willing
[40:57] to give themselves up for debt
[41:00] to the cause of this gospel i know you
[41:02] don't want everybody to know but i know
[41:04] behind the cameras you're willing to do
[41:06] it right
[41:07] so but but listen to the classy way or
[41:10] they say but the brandon said
[41:11] before he did so so he gave himself up
[41:14] there but before he did
[41:15] he asked for and was granted permission
[41:18] to pray
[41:18] two hours for his bridging in the lord
[41:22] for the governor for his enemies and his
[41:24] captors
[41:26] for this to be recorded in history this
[41:28] had to be
[41:29] of note because for him to pray and be
[41:32] granted the
[41:34] permission to this is talk about going
[41:36] out with grace
[41:37] he said i want two hours to pray i want
[41:39] to pray for my brethren
[41:41] i want to pray for the governor i want
[41:42] to pray for my enemies and i want to
[41:44] pray for my captors
[41:46] and like the great saints of all ages
[41:48] and desiring
[41:49] a better resurrection hallelujah
[41:52] he stood firm refusing to deny the lord
[41:58] and died with a free conscience so this
[42:01] was the
[42:01] attribute of that dare but it shows the
[42:04] level of faith and conviction that he
[42:07] had and what he believed in
[42:09] where are people today who will stand
[42:12] for what they believe
[42:13] where are fathers who will stand for
[42:16] truth and righteousness
[42:17] it may not have to be given up to death
[42:19] and die in in reliance then
[42:22] or dying but but that conviction and the
[42:24] grace to live that even in his death
[42:26] he acts he say oh god fire burn abundant
[42:29] captors
[42:30] and and why do you know who i is no no
[42:32] no he said i want two hours to pray
[42:35] and he had just prayed for the brethren
[42:37] he prayed for his enemies and the
[42:38] captors
[42:41] where where we do we see that before
[42:43] jesus are they crossed father forgive
[42:44] them
[42:45] they know not what they do he could have
[42:48] said judge all these romans around here
[42:49] who crucify me
[42:50] judge everybody no that is not jesus he
[42:53] said father forgive them
[42:54] they don't even understand they don't
[42:56] even know what they're doing
[42:58] and and and look look at polycarp
[43:01] look at the life he lived all right he
[43:04] was placed at his stake
[43:06] i know young people are read this one
[43:08] but listen to this so we took one
[43:09] polycarp now he gave himself
[43:10] up to death so i'm saying this because
[43:13] this is the
[43:14] history this is these are the influences
[43:17] that was upon irenaeus
[43:18] who was the messenger of the age so
[43:20] polycarp was placed at the stake
[43:22] and he was untied at his own request so
[43:25] i wanted a picture of this polycarp is a
[43:27] distinct now
[43:28] the reason when you put it in the stake
[43:31] the tire
[43:32] is when the fire come the odds of you
[43:36] staying on the fire is extremely low so
[43:40] it is prudent
[43:41] if you want to burn somebody that you
[43:42] stick to tied into the stick
[43:44] this is not a rocket science thing by
[43:47] your own
[43:48] instinct if you touch fire by the stove
[43:50] your hand will instinctively pull back
[43:53] so if you put you at his stick then then
[43:56] then
[43:56] you would be running leaping you you
[43:59] polycarp at his own request say don't
[44:01] time it
[44:05] and the fire was lit i'm reading i'm
[44:07] reading here from the esponian church
[44:09] so this is another novel reading from
[44:11] right the fire
[44:13] bent away from his body refusing to
[44:16] touch him
[44:20] so he is there untied he fired the
[44:22] lighting fire the fighter that have been
[44:24] away from him
[44:26] he was then pierced with a sword because
[44:28] when they
[44:29] when they realized that he that the fire
[44:32] emblem
[44:33] they're going and pierce him with a
[44:34] sword as this was done
[44:37] water gusts from his side drowning the
[44:39] flames
[44:42] we read about john who they put john in
[44:45] a vata oil to fry him
[44:47] and when they're wrecking me he was
[44:48] unfriable they put him on the aisle
[44:50] apartments
[44:51] as a witch here you have polycarb
[44:53] testimony he said don't time it
[44:56] maybe he was thinking about the the
[44:58] hebrew boys in the fire i don't know but
[45:00] he said no time
[45:02] and when he stood there and the lady
[45:03] fired he fighted a bend
[45:05] this is not the matrix this is that
[45:07] science fiction this is when a son of
[45:09] god is in place
[45:11] and and and and the god anointing upon
[45:13] your life
[45:14] he fires at the bend away when they
[45:16] pierce him
[45:18] water come out of his side
[45:21] drown in the flames but abraham goes on
[45:23] his spirit was actually seen to depart
[45:25] in the form of a wide dove
[45:27] released from his bosom now listen to
[45:30] the prophet now yet for
[45:32] all this great testimony this student of
[45:35] john
[45:36] so remember i mentioned it before it was
[45:38] john had an influence on polycarp
[45:40] this student of john the revelator was
[45:44] not
[45:44] militant against the nicolaitan system
[45:48] so he's saying that that this polycarp
[45:50] for his virtue and his character
[45:52] and his nature and his approach and his
[45:53] anointing he was not
[45:55] militant against the nicolaitan system
[45:58] for he himself leaned
[45:59] towards organization not realizing so he
[46:03] missed this
[46:03] not realizing that the desire for
[46:06] fellowship
[46:07] and what appeared like a good plan to
[46:10] foster the work of god
[46:12] was really a trick of the enemy
[46:15] i remember the branham goes on with
[46:17] iranians this was not so
[46:20] he was militant against any form of
[46:22] organization
[46:24] militant against any form of
[46:27] organization and that's what i love
[46:28] about this gospel
[46:29] this gospel makes you militant against
[46:32] any form of organization
[46:34] and firmly roots in your heart the
[46:36] sovereignty
[46:37] of the local church the most powerful
[46:39] unit of people that could ever exist
[46:41] anywhere on the planet
[46:43] the sovereignty of a local church
[46:47] and the authority of the local elder
[46:49] pastor of that local church
[46:52] where brother branham taught us through
[46:53] scripture there's no higher authority
[46:57] anybody with me tonight so this gives
[46:59] now a firm conviction and a position
[47:02] why where what we do tonight this bible
[47:06] study i can't take no playbook from
[47:08] anybody else
[47:09] i don't know who else want to do this
[47:10] who doing this it doesn't matter
[47:12] because i am taking my instructions from
[47:14] my heavenly
[47:16] father this is a sovereign church
[47:19] i'd rather get permission
[47:22] but it's by revelation by inspiration by
[47:25] operation
[47:26] and irenaeus was clear in that he was
[47:28] militant militant means
[47:30] you're willing to go to war about it
[47:33] it doesn't matter to me what any other
[47:35] church does
[47:36] i have no time i have no interest we
[47:39] have to give an account
[47:40] the pastor assistant pastor ministers ls
[47:43] deacons
[47:43] we have to give an account for what's
[47:45] happening in this church
[47:48] that is how my papers being marked
[47:50] nothing against anybody else that's a
[47:51] word
[47:52] so so so it meant that polycarp's
[47:54] downfall
[47:56] now we understanding now what is
[47:57] happening in the spiritual realm in that
[47:59] season
[48:01] polycarp's downfall was his desire for
[48:04] fellowship
[48:05] letting some compromising irenaeus as a
[48:08] good student
[48:09] watching what is going on he recognizes
[48:11] he's saying you see that kind of thing
[48:12] that kind of organization that kind of
[48:14] group thing they're kind of looking to
[48:16] see who preaching what
[48:17] and which groups coming together and who
[48:19] in the inspiration
[48:20] who in that inspiration who follow it
[48:22] you say i'm not with that i'm militant
[48:24] militant about no organization i want to
[48:26] hear from god
[48:29] anybody with me tonight
[48:32] he was militant against any form of
[48:35] organization
[48:36] also his life history wherein he served
[48:38] the lord was one of much manifestation
[48:41] in the holy spirit and the world was
[48:43] taught with unusual clarity
[48:45] i love that unusual clarity
[48:48] that is what the world needs you know
[48:50] clarity there's so much confusion around
[48:51] the world but what we need in our lives
[48:53] is clarity
[48:55] we want to know how to move what to do
[48:58] we want to get clear instructions
[49:00] not could it be could it be if it might
[49:02] be i don't know i'm not sure and i want
[49:04] clarity
[49:05] because god is clear he is precise he's
[49:07] direct he lays out plans for us
[49:09] there's no guessing and speculation what
[49:12] we know
[49:13] those things which are revealed they
[49:15] belong to us they are
[49:16] some things that are not belonging to us
[49:18] because they are not revealed
[49:19] god in his sovereign power and by virtue
[49:22] of the fact that he is sovereign
[49:24] and he has prerogated what he wants
[49:26] keeps things to himself i'm not trying
[49:28] to figure out what god wants to keep to
[49:30] himself
[49:30] but those things are revealed they
[49:33] belong to us
[49:34] we can act with it we can march to it
[49:37] it's a certain sound for us anybody with
[49:39] me
[49:39] tonight you have to forgive me but we
[49:42] need to be militant
[49:44] about this gospel we need to be militant
[49:46] about the word
[49:47] we need to be militant about our
[49:49] attitude to rising above our situations
[49:52] and seeing the devil where he is seeing
[49:54] god and his word and seeing our place
[49:57] in this great battle
[50:00] hallelujah
[50:04] thus with his strict adherence to the
[50:05] word his powerful understanding of
[50:08] scripture
[50:08] so irenaeus brother branhamson had a
[50:10] powerful understanding of scripture
[50:13] and that is why i believe it's truly
[50:14] inspired that we are fighting
[50:17] to get these bible studies in this place
[50:19] because we have to have a
[50:21] powerful understanding of scripture it
[50:24] is your strength
[50:26] you have to be able to go to war based
[50:27] on this not on well he says so or this
[50:30] won't get a revelation of this
[50:31] where is it in the word brother branham
[50:33] said when the angel
[50:34] came to him he said angel hold up hold
[50:36] up he said
[50:37] check in scripture against what the
[50:40] angels said
[50:41] and make sure it was lining up
[50:46] and you that that was a weaker situation
[50:48] listen to anybody say anything
[50:49] it needs to be lined up with scripture
[50:52] god bring us back to our back to the
[50:54] bible church
[50:55] back to the bible experience back to the
[50:58] principle that was laid on
[50:59] on the day of pentecost anybody with me
[51:01] tonight
[51:02] so we still in verse eighteen we still
[51:05] invested we still
[51:06] just dealing with the angel of the
[51:07] church
[51:09] and the attitude of this angel and and
[51:12] and but ibrahim in many places talked
[51:14] about
[51:15] god shapes a man character he gives them
[51:18] a certain something
[51:19] and is right a mini challenge of the
[51:21] hour so irenaeus would have been
[51:23] formed a certain way natured a certain
[51:25] way conducted himself a situation
[51:28] because of the unique situation that he
[51:30] had to deal with
[51:31] all right so unto the angel of the
[51:33] church in smyrna
[51:35] so whether brahman teaching us would
[51:36] have now said okay he touched on the
[51:38] angel
[51:38] and now we touch on this church in
[51:40] seminar he said the city of smyrna
[51:43] was a little north of ephesus at the
[51:46] mount of the
[51:47] sumona gulf because of his very fine
[51:50] harbor it was a commercial center
[51:52] renowned for its exports
[51:54] this is inspiring churches so you can
[51:56] read this it was also distinguished by
[51:58] its schools of rhetoric
[52:00] philosophy medicine sciences and fine
[52:03] building
[52:04] many jews lived there and they were
[52:06] bitterly opposed to christianity
[52:09] even more so than the romans in fact
[52:12] polycarp the first bishop at smurna
[52:14] was martyred by the jews mattered by the
[52:18] jews speaking about people who
[52:19] would have been privy to the torah privy
[52:22] to the hearing of how they came out of
[52:24] egypt and all these things these were
[52:26] the ones who murdered polika
[52:28] and it is said listen to this listen to
[52:30] the significance of this
[52:31] and listen to how it will make sense
[52:33] when we go deeper into into
[52:34] understanding this age
[52:36] that the jews desecrated their holy day
[52:40] the sabbath day to carry the wood
[52:45] that was going to be used to burn
[52:46] polycarp i wanted to understand
[52:49] the level of resistance here now if you
[52:52] are students of scripture
[52:53] you would understand that there's no
[52:55] work done on the sabbath day
[52:58] in fact when jesus was on earth they had
[53:00] issue with jesus and said well how we
[53:01] could do this on the sabbath day
[53:04] but they were so resistant of what
[53:05] polycarp represented that they
[53:07] desecrated a sabbath day
[53:09] they went and woke on a sabbath to
[53:10] getting wood to burn polycarp
[53:13] so daisy the backdrop of this now this
[53:15] is after
[53:17] jesus raised from the dead this is after
[53:19] the day of pentecost this is after
[53:21] hearing about miracles this is after all
[53:23] these things
[53:23] this is not before this is after all of
[53:26] this these are jews
[53:28] who should have heard witness who should
[53:30] have heard testimony but they were still
[53:31] resistant to the truth
[53:33] now let's go a little further the word
[53:35] smyrna means bitter
[53:38] being derived from the word mu mo was
[53:41] used in embalming the dead thus we have
[53:44] a
[53:44] twofold significance found in the name
[53:47] of this age
[53:48] it was a bitter age filled with death
[53:53] the two vines within the framework of
[53:55] the church
[53:56] we talked about it in ephesians 13 the
[53:59] two vines
[54:00] which is the true vine and the false
[54:02] vine within the framework of the church
[54:05] were drifting further apart with an
[54:08] increased bitterness towards the true
[54:11] vine
[54:12] on the path of the force that was not
[54:15] only the seed of the false vine but even
[54:18] in the true vine
[54:19] there was a creeping paralysis and
[54:22] impotence because they had
[54:24] already drifted from the unadulterated
[54:27] truth
[54:27] of the first few years after pentecost
[54:32] and listen to the prophet no true
[54:34] believer
[54:35] is any stronger and spiritually healthy
[54:39] and alive
[54:40] than his knowledge of listen carefully
[54:42] and adherence to
[54:44] the pure word of god so listen to
[54:47] it again no true believer is any
[54:50] stronger and spiritually healthy and
[54:52] alive
[54:53] so he's giving a formula of what strong
[54:57] healthy and alive is made up of it is
[55:00] the knowledge of so you have to know
[55:04] adherence to which is compliance
[55:07] believing acting is a part of you
[55:09] the pure word of god are seen in the
[55:12] multitude of examples
[55:14] in scripture so i know saying a lot we
[55:17] still
[55:17] in verse eighteen yeah we are going to
[55:20] fire it and i might have to speed up
[55:22] um a bit here and there but we're trying
[55:25] to take our time as well and make sure
[55:26] this thing sits in
[55:28] so you kind of understand not just that
[55:30] this was a
[55:31] location smooner not that this was a
[55:34] dispensational
[55:35] time in in in in the evolution or the
[55:39] or the unfolding if i could say that of
[55:41] all the ages but to see how does it
[55:43] apply even in now what do you know all
[55:44] right
[55:45] so but the brandon would go on and i
[55:47] would jump two different parts as the
[55:49] ephesian age was but a seed bed
[55:52] for the tragic pergamian age which is
[55:54] which is coming after smooner
[55:56] that was yet in the future this morning
[55:58] age was the rain
[56:00] the sun and the nourishment that ensured
[56:03] that the
[56:03] vile corruption that would confirm the
[56:06] church in idolatry
[56:08] which is spiritual fornication would
[56:10] never rise that was permeated so but the
[56:12] brandon was saying
[56:13] that the ephesians age where the decay
[56:17] started
[56:18] that this age of smyrna created the
[56:20] environment
[56:22] for the false vine to grow and and come
[56:24] to ahead in the programming church age
[56:26] all right
[56:27] so let's begin to go a little deeper now
[56:30] of course we're still in verse 8 and
[56:32] under the angel of the church in smyrna
[56:34] it's a bitter age it's bitterness it's
[56:36] darkness bitterness in the heart of the
[56:38] people
[56:39] these things say the first and the last
[56:41] which was dead and is alive we know that
[56:42] is
[56:43] but ibrahim said these things say the
[56:44] first to the last which was dead
[56:46] and is alive no man could say was dead
[56:49] and is alive but iran made it clear
[56:51] that the first thing that happens to man
[56:53] is that he is born alive and then he
[56:55] dies
[56:55] so this can be man speaking this is
[56:57] jesus who was dead
[56:59] and is now alive he said adam took
[57:01] innocence
[57:02] and turned it into guilt this one this
[57:05] jesus took guilt and turn it into
[57:07] righteousness
[57:08] adam took a paradise and turned it into
[57:10] a waste hauling wilderness
[57:12] but this one is coming back to to turn
[57:15] an earth
[57:16] rocking and reeling with destruction
[57:17] into another eden
[57:19] adam took a life of fellowship and joy
[57:21] with god
[57:22] and turned it into a desert of spiritual
[57:24] darkness and brought forth all sin
[57:27] moral decay pain suffering delusion and
[57:30] corruption
[57:31] that wars within the souls of men but
[57:33] this one
[57:34] from all the tragic death and
[57:36] degradation that fill
[57:38] mankind brought forth a life of
[57:40] righteousness and beauty
[57:41] so that a sin once reigned unto death
[57:44] even so might men no reign
[57:46] in righteousness and but ibrahim said in
[57:48] this verse eight here
[57:50] as we have read before he is walking in
[57:52] the candlesticks he's walking
[57:54] through the churches he's walking in in
[57:56] the midst of those
[57:57] whom he redeemed even his church and
[58:00] ibrahim said they were and what were
[58:03] those who were redeemed
[58:04] were not many like paul murderers you
[58:07] know paul was a murderer
[58:08] and corrupt us we're not many like the
[58:10] dying teeth robbers and men killers
[58:12] all true of things of his grace so
[58:14] brother brown was bringing out here
[58:16] that he took these lives of people who
[58:18] had messed up lives
[58:19] and turned them into trophies not their
[58:22] credit
[58:22] not because of them but they were
[58:24] trophies of his grace
[58:26] so there's a trophy of paul who was once
[58:28] a murderer
[58:29] and in it as a trophy with grace stamped
[58:31] on it
[58:32] the the thief on the cross he was a
[58:34] thief but
[58:36] today you will be with me in paradise
[58:38] how much more is a testimony of all of
[58:40] us
[58:40] who know where we come from but there's
[58:42] a trophy of god redeeming
[58:44] pulling and by his grace you could be
[58:47] put up there as well
[58:48] as a testament that god found you picked
[58:50] you chose you
[58:51] can the church say amen all right
[58:57] verse nine we took about 20 minutes on
[59:01] one verse
[59:02] we go in good i know that works
[59:05] and tribulation and poverty but thou art
[59:08] rich
[59:10] and i know the blasphemy of them which
[59:12] say they are jews
[59:14] and are not but are the synagogue of
[59:16] satan
[59:19] hallelujah are we ready
[59:25] but iran started off in speaking about
[59:27] this he says
[59:28] the key to this age but i'm not sure
[59:31] we'll finish this one tonight yeah i
[59:32] think we might have to
[59:33] this might be uh revelation 3.5
[59:37] i have to figure out how how are we
[59:38] numbering it as we go forward you know
[59:40] because this thing i have so much meat
[59:42] in it all right so but i might say the
[59:44] key to this age
[59:45] is most evidently tribulation so you say
[59:48] the whole mark of this age is
[59:49] tribulation
[59:50] how many people yeah tribulation don't
[59:52] tell let's say tribulation
[59:53] but the key to this age is tribulation
[59:55] all right
[59:57] if there was tribulation in the first
[59:59] age by the ram said
[1:00:00] now there is there's there's no
[1:00:02] predicted and intensified tribulation
[1:00:05] so you say whatever pressure existed in
[1:00:07] the first age
[1:00:08] now in this ages is is tribulation plus
[1:00:11] it's tribulation 2.0 it's intensified
[1:00:14] tribulation
[1:00:15] all right there's no doubt that what the
[1:00:18] f
[1:00:18] that but what the following words of
[1:00:20] paul applied there's no doubt that the
[1:00:22] foreign word support apply to them
[1:00:24] to the mass of christians wherever in
[1:00:26] the world and in every age
[1:00:28] so but ibraham is saying that this is
[1:00:30] something that is in
[1:00:31] all the ages and not just in this
[1:00:32] particular age
[1:00:34] so but ibrahim is saying that god said i
[1:00:37] know
[1:00:37] thy works and tribulation and
[1:00:40] poverty so he says he is walking in the
[1:00:44] midst of the candlesticks
[1:00:45] so he knows but but evan said does he
[1:00:48] hold back the persecution
[1:00:51] now i want us to get this now because a
[1:00:52] lot of people
[1:00:54] you know and and and recently i was in a
[1:00:57] conversation around this as well
[1:00:59] but everyone is saying does he stem the
[1:01:00] tribulation no he does not
[1:01:02] he simply says i know your tribulation
[1:01:06] no i don't know your testimony and i am
[1:01:09] the least
[1:01:10] to try to be super spiritual i have a
[1:01:12] real problem in super spiritual people
[1:01:14] i just have a real child i i have
[1:01:16] tribulation
[1:01:17] that is the tribulation that's designed
[1:01:20] for me
[1:01:21] i don't know i don't know about you this
[1:01:22] is my testimony but then i am comforted
[1:01:24] because scripture tells me that is
[1:01:26] normal
[1:01:26] because you might wonder know if what
[1:01:28] you're going through is normal yes it's
[1:01:29] normal
[1:01:30] listen he said i know your tribulation
[1:01:35] i am not unmindful of your suffering
[1:01:38] but i barely said what a stumbling block
[1:01:40] this is to so many people
[1:01:42] listen to this sir he said like israel
[1:01:44] they wonder if god really loves them
[1:01:48] now i've seen good people go through
[1:01:51] some stuff
[1:01:52] that make them question the fate
[1:01:54] christianity
[1:01:55] the message if god loved them and look
[1:01:57] it is here
[1:01:58] in clear prophet in the message of the
[1:02:00] hour
[1:02:01] how could message believers go to a
[1:02:03] trial and then say well god
[1:02:05] don't love me but i branham breaks it up
[1:02:07] very clearly here
[1:02:08] all right like israel they wonder if god
[1:02:10] really loves them how can god be
[1:02:12] just unloving if he stand by and watches
[1:02:15] his people suffer all right so the
[1:02:18] buddha ran him is dealing with this
[1:02:19] powerful statement i know thy works
[1:02:21] and tribulation and poverty and brother
[1:02:23] branham is saying it can almost stumble
[1:02:25] you to say but why
[1:02:26] why if god know he do something about it
[1:02:29] and but ibrahim goes on to say you see
[1:02:31] they could not figure out god's love
[1:02:36] they taught that love meant no suffering
[1:02:40] they thought that love meant a baby with
[1:02:42] parental care
[1:02:43] he said but god said that his love is
[1:02:45] elective
[1:02:46] now we have heard this before no i
[1:02:49] realize
[1:02:50] i'll share my testimony here in this and
[1:02:52] reading this and experiences is
[1:02:54] three different things then because
[1:02:57] i have heard it preach god love is
[1:02:59] elective love and anything
[1:03:01] but when you under fire and and these
[1:03:04] publicity in here
[1:03:05] you know really you could wonder
[1:03:09] so it is understandable that brother
[1:03:11] barnum is trying to bring a clarity
[1:03:13] around it
[1:03:13] because if you are not prepared for it
[1:03:15] you will know the dvd situation when
[1:03:17] they come and trust me they're coming
[1:03:18] so his love is elective the proof of his
[1:03:21] love is election
[1:03:22] that no matter what happened his love
[1:03:24] was proven truly by the fact that they
[1:03:27] were chosen unto salvation
[1:03:29] listen to the prophet so we read it in
[1:03:31] adoption
[1:03:32] he could turn the church against you he
[1:03:34] could turn your wife against you
[1:03:36] he could put in a better sickness but
[1:03:39] nobody volunteered
[1:03:43] i have yet to see somebody volunteer for
[1:03:44] these things right so listen to the
[1:03:46] prophet here in this church
[1:03:47] you say he may commit you to death as he
[1:03:50] did paul
[1:03:51] he may commit you to suffering as he did
[1:03:53] job that is his prerogative
[1:03:55] he is sovereign but it is all with a
[1:03:59] purpose
[1:04:01] so i want us to not look at the
[1:04:03] suffering or the situation but look at
[1:04:04] the purpose right
[1:04:06] if he did not have a purpose listen to
[1:04:08] the prophet
[1:04:09] then he would be the author of
[1:04:11] frustration and not of peace
[1:04:13] his purpose is that after we have
[1:04:16] suffered so it means that suffering is
[1:04:18] for a time
[1:04:20] god gone be god already gone beyond this
[1:04:22] suffering to the after part
[1:04:25] after the battle is over after the
[1:04:27] suffering is over his
[1:04:28] purpose is that after we have suffered a
[1:04:30] while for a season
[1:04:32] we will be made perfect be established
[1:04:36] strengthened and settled i love that i
[1:04:39] love that
[1:04:40] i love that after you suffer
[1:04:43] you would be made perfect i love it one
[1:04:46] established two strengthened
[1:04:50] three and settled you know what has to
[1:04:51] be settled
[1:04:53] worried you're settled you have peace
[1:04:56] you have comfort
[1:04:59] you're not moving anything because you
[1:05:00] already passed the test
[1:05:02] if you've had the exam to go through
[1:05:04] when it back in the days i think they
[1:05:05] call it what
[1:05:06] see sick i see i forget they change
[1:05:08] these things and again hold up
[1:05:09] but back in the day when you had cxc
[1:05:11] hunting and you had your oral exam or
[1:05:12] you have a lab exam
[1:05:14] and you have work building up to
[1:05:16] something you have different one paper
[1:05:17] two paper three people okay and
[1:05:18] everything
[1:05:19] after you go through the preparation
[1:05:21] when you're finally getting
[1:05:22] certificating your hand at your past
[1:05:24] you feel settled you feel established
[1:05:28] you feel like the effort and the journey
[1:05:30] you went through has brought you that
[1:05:31] place that you have proof that you
[1:05:33] overcame
[1:05:34] so he said that the suffering we're
[1:05:35] going through is to bring us to a spot
[1:05:37] that we overcome
[1:05:40] right as job said he put strength in us
[1:05:42] you see
[1:05:43] listen to it you see he himself suffered
[1:05:47] so he's single jesus himself suffered so
[1:05:50] it as if
[1:05:51] you know and and and and in different
[1:05:53] experiences parents would know this you
[1:05:54] know what you go through
[1:05:56] and and after a while you're watching
[1:05:58] children who sitting and you know when
[1:05:59] to intervene
[1:06:00] and when not to intervene because
[1:06:04] learning as a process and this is what
[1:06:07] apprenticeship apprenticeship is so
[1:06:08] valuable
[1:06:09] because if you do everything for your
[1:06:11] children if you
[1:06:12] make the part too clear and they don't
[1:06:14] learn
[1:06:15] real learning they will go and do
[1:06:17] shopping over and over again
[1:06:20] but but because jesus himself suffered
[1:06:22] listen
[1:06:23] he himself suffered he learned obedience
[1:06:26] by the things that he suffered he was
[1:06:30] actually made perfect by the things he
[1:06:32] suffered
[1:06:34] hebrews 5 8-9 we know the scripture
[1:06:36] though he were a son
[1:06:38] yet learned he obedience by things which
[1:06:41] he suffered
[1:06:42] and being made perfect he became
[1:06:46] the author of eternal salvation unto all
[1:06:48] them that will be him
[1:06:50] but ibrahim said in plain language and i
[1:06:52] hope this helps somebody tonight
[1:06:53] because a lot of us go into the poor me
[1:06:55] you know what i going through
[1:06:56] i was certain place and this happened
[1:06:58] and this happened and i give up
[1:07:00] and i think and thing and thing and and
[1:07:02] god is trying to bring you to perfection
[1:07:04] true experiences true trials
[1:07:08] and if it's an easy trial what will that
[1:07:10] bring out to you
[1:07:14] you can't grow you can't grow everything
[1:07:16] easy easy easy
[1:07:18] you can't go back to standard one you're
[1:07:19] past that stage you inform five and then
[1:07:21] with a standard one exam
[1:07:24] you supposed to be doing universities
[1:07:25] that table give a given if
[1:07:27] examiner a for apple b football what
[1:07:30] growth what job you're going to take
[1:07:32] showing me a for apple
[1:07:35] the trial you have to go through has to
[1:07:37] be fit and in alignment with your role
[1:07:40] and the responsibility you're about to
[1:07:41] take
[1:07:43] if your job require a for apple b
[1:07:44] football you really want to be working
[1:07:46] in first year as a little seven-year-old
[1:07:48] mentor
[1:07:49] a five-year-old but but when i was a
[1:07:52] child i speak as a child this is
[1:07:53] maturity this is big mounting
[1:07:56] big woman thing so the expectation
[1:08:00] of your role you're not have to prepare
[1:08:02] for university exam
[1:08:04] and master's degree exam in the
[1:08:06] spiritual realm
[1:08:07] this is not about knowledge now but it's
[1:08:08] about the role you're about to fit into
[1:08:11] the role has a certain expectation a
[1:08:13] certain level of understanding
[1:08:15] you cannot be a ceo and thinking like
[1:08:17] like if you're now entering into the
[1:08:18] organization
[1:08:20] and the role that god wants to put you
[1:08:22] in is kings and priests that kind of
[1:08:23] title
[1:08:24] don't test your door just born that to
[1:08:26] know you have to mature and to be able
[1:08:27] to rule the kingdom
[1:08:29] anybody with me tonight so i wanted to
[1:08:31] see the suffering and the experiences in
[1:08:34] context
[1:08:35] situations come and you fly over your
[1:08:36] hand and realize wait a minute i was
[1:08:38] someone growing up to do boy
[1:08:39] i lose my cool too fast today because if
[1:08:42] i was running the kingdom right now i
[1:08:43] have the kingdom i'm going through
[1:08:46] i have to be a little more patient i
[1:08:47] think they're more soft spoken go ahead
[1:08:48] and raise your voice too low you set up
[1:08:50] a nuclear
[1:08:50] explosion
[1:08:54] so it's character formation by suffering
[1:08:56] right
[1:08:57] so listen in plain language yeah this is
[1:09:01] we definitely have to do 3.5 next week
[1:09:03] in plain language the very
[1:09:04] character of jesus was perfected by
[1:09:08] suffering and according to paul he has
[1:09:11] left his church a
[1:09:12] measure of suffering that they too by
[1:09:16] their faith in god
[1:09:17] while suffering for him would come to a
[1:09:20] place of perfection
[1:09:22] so this coming to a place of perfection
[1:09:24] is not by education
[1:09:26] it's not by sitting down in church and
[1:09:29] and sitting along and even bible study
[1:09:31] and when i'm being perfected
[1:09:33] here and you would you will have some
[1:09:35] experiences to go through
[1:09:37] that would shake the boat of your life
[1:09:40] that you would have to be so dependent
[1:09:42] on the anger holding the spidey storm
[1:09:45] anybody with me tonight
[1:09:51] make you already show away your faith
[1:09:52] angers you know
[1:09:55] why did he want it james 1 verse 2 to 4
[1:09:58] my brethren counted all joy when you
[1:10:01] fall into divers temptation
[1:10:03] knowing this that the trying of your
[1:10:05] feet
[1:10:06] trying off your feet trying off your
[1:10:08] feet is when your feet be intestinal
[1:10:11] the opposite of faith is doubt so to try
[1:10:13] your fate is to test to see where on the
[1:10:16] scale of doubter feet
[1:10:18] your response would be 3d test
[1:10:21] your door in the next move but will you
[1:10:24] have doubt over your feet
[1:10:25] will you launch out and say lord if you
[1:10:28] bid me to come
[1:10:29] or will they say well no i'll never get
[1:10:31] any life jacket and let me test
[1:10:32] and let me see if the weather report and
[1:10:34] and and and where
[1:10:35] your feet being tested knowing that the
[1:10:37] triangle you'll feel working patience
[1:10:39] but let patients have a perfect work
[1:10:42] that he may be perfect
[1:10:44] an entire wanting nothing
[1:10:47] why does he stand this but ibn said in
[1:10:49] romans 8
[1:10:50] and he read the scripture if children
[1:10:52] and ears is of god and joint heirs with
[1:10:54] christ
[1:10:54] if so be that we suffer with him
[1:10:58] that we may also be glorified together
[1:11:01] for i
[1:11:01] reckon that the sufferings of this
[1:11:03] present time are not worthy
[1:11:05] to be compared with the glory which have
[1:11:08] been revealed in us this is not just
[1:11:10] scripture
[1:11:13] there is suffering that we go through to
[1:11:15] defer to form our character
[1:11:17] and that is what abraham was pulling out
[1:11:19] of this thing i know that works
[1:11:21] and tribulation and poverty but though i
[1:11:24] rich but
[1:11:26] i said unless we suffer with him we
[1:11:28] cannot reign with him
[1:11:30] you have to suffer to reign the reason
[1:11:32] for this and where the random explains
[1:11:33] is we know it
[1:11:34] is that character simply is never made
[1:11:37] without suffering
[1:11:39] you look at business you look at anybody
[1:11:41] who's achieved anything
[1:11:43] they would have had to gone through a
[1:11:45] process of suffering
[1:11:47] these successful entrepreneurs tell you
[1:11:49] they have failed more times and they
[1:11:51] have succeeded
[1:11:52] and it is only after repeated failures
[1:11:54] making decisions that they learn they
[1:11:56] learn
[1:11:57] you ask them how you you're getting in
[1:11:59] university they say all the books are
[1:12:01] read and prepare me to deal with the
[1:12:02] situation
[1:12:03] but i make this mistake i make and i
[1:12:05] just i learn i just i
[1:12:07] until they reach a point where they have
[1:12:09] an understanding of what they need to do
[1:12:12] the reason for this is that character
[1:12:14] simply
[1:12:15] is never made without suffering
[1:12:19] there's no school but always say there's
[1:12:20] no school of marriage
[1:12:23] husbands have to develop character
[1:12:25] through suffering
[1:12:26] wise have to develop character true
[1:12:28] suffering oh
[1:12:30] parents have to develop character
[1:12:32] through suffering too
[1:12:34] nobody knows starting out the gate how
[1:12:36] to be the perfect parent
[1:12:37] to be the perfect wife to be the perfect
[1:12:39] husband to be the perfect employee to be
[1:12:41] the perfect boss to be the perfect
[1:12:43] neighbor
[1:12:43] there's no book with it
[1:12:47] and because our backgrounds and our
[1:12:48] history and our stories are different
[1:12:51] there'll be some suffering some changing
[1:12:56] but you have to learn and this is why i
[1:12:57] say every week you must be able to look
[1:12:58] back and say
[1:12:59] i'm not where i was last week i know i'm
[1:13:01] not who i was last week i know i'm not
[1:13:02] how i was two weeks ago
[1:13:04] and the same thing is happening for you
[1:13:06] if you would care to admit and look back
[1:13:07] and say wait a minute
[1:13:08] you're not responding differently i'm
[1:13:11] not as emotional and not as
[1:13:12] as and and you'll begin to see the
[1:13:15] deeper getting into this the changes
[1:13:16] right character is a victory not a gift
[1:13:19] a man without character cannot read
[1:13:22] because power apart from character is
[1:13:24] satanic but a power character is fit to
[1:13:26] rule
[1:13:26] these are powerful quotes we read in
[1:13:28] church this is the church age where
[1:13:29] brother branham was preaching this
[1:13:31] this morning on church age and the
[1:13:34] little
[1:13:34] temporary suffering we go through now is
[1:13:37] not worthy to be compared to the
[1:13:38] tremendous
[1:13:39] glory that will be revealed in us when
[1:13:41] he comes oh
[1:13:42] what tresses are laid up for those who
[1:13:44] are willing to enter
[1:13:46] into his kingdom through much
[1:13:47] tribulation
[1:13:50] there are people who the first trial
[1:13:51] come they want to leave the church first
[1:13:53] child come they want to backslide
[1:13:54] the first child come and many times not
[1:13:56] even think affecting them no
[1:14:00] now let's let's let's listen just a
[1:14:02] think it's not strange concerning the
[1:14:04] fiery child that i have to try you
[1:14:06] that is what peter said in 1st peter 4
[1:14:07] 12 is it strange that god wants us to
[1:14:10] develop a
[1:14:10] christ-like character that comes through
[1:14:13] suffering knows so
[1:14:14] and we all have trials you don't think
[1:14:16] about overhave
[1:14:17] trials
[1:14:21] you don't think the prophet had trials
[1:14:25] so it's all of us we boat here is not
[1:14:28] his childhood smaller
[1:14:29] or bigger
[1:14:34] not one but goes through that we are all
[1:14:37] tried and chasing our sons
[1:14:39] and listen to this this is now to the
[1:14:41] church but everyone say the church that
[1:14:42] is not suffering
[1:14:43] and is not being tried hasn't got it it
[1:14:45] isn't of god
[1:14:50] i see god's sense of any church to see
[1:14:52] what your foundation is and
[1:14:53] see if you're on man to see if you're on
[1:14:55] the group and that's why i said i preach
[1:14:57] it oh yeah this year
[1:14:58] don't judge each other by some quack it
[1:14:59] have quacks i'm not going to call them
[1:15:01] i'm not going to identify it i'm not
[1:15:02] going to tell you who they are but they
[1:15:03] are quacks
[1:15:04] you can't judge each other by them but
[1:15:05] everybody said they're three kinds of
[1:15:08] believers true believers make with
[1:15:10] unbelievable in the church
[1:15:12] no matter your prayer but evans you
[1:15:13] appreciate it blue in the face they do
[1:15:15] what they want to do
[1:15:17] we can't change that hallelujah by your
[1:15:21] judge
[1:15:21] church but how would you stay with the
[1:15:23] word and how the word is expressed and
[1:15:25] how it is spoken
[1:15:26] anybody with me for whom the lord love
[1:15:29] it he chastened
[1:15:30] it and scourged every son whom he
[1:15:32] received that is he in hebrews
[1:15:33] but listen but if you be without
[1:15:36] chastisement and we're not to
[1:15:38] raise your hands but if you don't have
[1:15:40] any chastisement
[1:15:41] where of are all partakers then your
[1:15:43] bastards are not sons
[1:15:45] so be very concerned if you have no
[1:15:47] trials and no chance time
[1:15:48] and no chastening and you know you not
[1:15:51] getting no licks
[1:15:52] because if you're not getting licks you
[1:15:53] need to something is wrong
[1:15:55] that means very very wrong because
[1:15:58] you're a bastard another son but all
[1:15:59] sons
[1:16:00] who come into god will be tested and
[1:16:02] tried
[1:16:03] now to put it in context and listen to
[1:16:05] the prophet's word now this special
[1:16:07] condition and simona
[1:16:09] must be applied to every age there's no
[1:16:12] age free from it
[1:16:13] so don't tell me well that wasn't that
[1:16:15] time now and no no no
[1:16:17] no age is free from it there's no true
[1:16:19] believer free from it

[1:18:14] life
[1:18:14] are no signs of god disapproval
[1:18:18] neither are bright skies and still water
[1:18:21] signs of his love and approval
[1:18:23] his approval of any of us is only in the
[1:18:26] beloved
[1:18:28] his love is elective which he had for us
[1:18:30] before the foundation of the world does
[1:18:32] he love us
[1:18:32] yes how shall we know we shall go
[1:18:34] because he said so and manifested that
[1:18:37] he did love us
[1:18:38] for he brought us to himself and gave us
[1:18:41] of his spirit
[1:18:42] pleasing us our sons all that he's still
[1:18:45] in verse niner
[1:18:46] and i'm just trying to it's just it's
[1:18:48] just four voices we're trying to touch
[1:18:50] tonight you know we're still here he's
[1:18:51] telling the first half of it
[1:18:53] but the bible goes on i know thy poverty
[1:18:55] so i know that i worked within western
[1:18:57] under tribulation we touched working on
[1:18:59] trump and
[1:18:59] and poverty but though outreach and
[1:19:02] bodybuilding said
[1:19:03] there is again see him walking up and
[1:19:05] down in the midst of his church like a
[1:19:07] father he is looking down
[1:19:09] upon his family he is the head of his
[1:19:11] household household
[1:19:12] he is the provider he is the protector
[1:19:15] yet he looks on at their poverty
[1:19:18] oh how the untutored believer
[1:19:22] stumbles at this
[1:19:25] now if you're not in the word and read
[1:19:26] any scripture and rightly divide any
[1:19:28] word on the scripture to understand
[1:19:30] these things
[1:19:31] you see how you can lose your anchor and
[1:19:34] you see why you have to be your own
[1:19:36] student of the word
[1:19:39] this message understand this sir quality
[1:19:41] cup was taken guidance and mentorship
[1:19:44] from
[1:19:44] john i read it was taking it from
[1:19:48] polycarp and the reality is they were
[1:19:50] operating with part lighting or part
[1:19:51] word in them
[1:19:54] there were still mysteries that were not
[1:19:56] understood and opened to them in those
[1:19:57] days
[1:19:58] and as each age passed it was unfalling
[1:20:01] and falling to this age till we have the
[1:20:02] whole brew the whole blueprint in them
[1:20:05] if you go back into that day
[1:20:09] your revelation and understanding would
[1:20:12] make people wonder if they listen to the
[1:20:13] idea
[1:20:14] listen to you you know because you have
[1:20:17] access to the old scroll
[1:20:20] so why the discomfort why why why are we
[1:20:23] so tossed about the prophet will say
[1:20:25] time to let all the pressure listen how
[1:20:28] the untreated believers come how can god
[1:20:30] bear
[1:20:31] to look up on his own in a time of need
[1:20:33] and not just stop it all
[1:20:35] just giving and lavish everything
[1:20:36] material upon them
[1:20:38] and by the random goes into it here is
[1:20:40] where you have to believe again in the
[1:20:42] love and
[1:20:43] goodness and wisdom of god that too is
[1:20:45] needful
[1:20:47] remember he admonished take no thought
[1:20:49] for tomorrow
[1:20:50] what he shall eat what you shall put on
[1:20:53] your father knows the things you have
[1:20:54] need of
[1:20:55] he will close the lead and feeds a
[1:20:57] sparrow so i'll do much more for
[1:21:00] you these physical things are not the
[1:21:03] true basic deception
[1:21:04] necessity of your life for a man's life
[1:21:07] consists is not of the things he
[1:21:08] possesses
[1:21:09] but rather seek he fills the kingdom of
[1:21:11] god and his righteousness
[1:21:13] and listen to the prophet and all
[1:21:15] material
[1:21:16] necessities will be added unto you
[1:21:20] so when you do it in a wrong order god
[1:21:23] will not bless it
[1:21:25] your script your playbook it's not your
[1:21:28] world
[1:21:29] what works for them cannot work for you
[1:21:31] because you are under a different law
[1:21:32] a different covenant your formula
[1:21:36] people talk about the formula to success
[1:21:38] five keys to success the ladder for
[1:21:40] success
[1:21:41] you want your formula seek first the
[1:21:43] kingdom of god
[1:21:44] and his righteousness and all everything
[1:21:47] else will be added to you that is your
[1:21:49] formula
[1:21:50] the key to your business it comes from
[1:21:52] seeking for the kingdom the key to your
[1:21:53] marriage comes from seeking the kingdom
[1:21:55] the key to your educational ambitions is
[1:21:58] because the kingdom and seeking his
[1:21:59] kingdom
[1:22:00] you will get access to his thoughts his
[1:22:02] approach is
[1:22:03] and god wants to bless you he is too
[1:22:06] given the power to get wealth
[1:22:08] but if you don't approach it the right
[1:22:10] way you will mess up
[1:22:11] amber branham goes on he says i see your
[1:22:14] poverty
[1:22:15] i see your need you haven't very much of
[1:22:17] anything to boast of
[1:22:18] what you did have has been taken from
[1:22:20] you you gladly gave up your possessions
[1:22:23] in exchange for eternal ones you are
[1:22:25] laughed at you are scorned
[1:22:27] you don't have material resources to
[1:22:28] fall back on and that's a lot of people
[1:22:31] don't but you are rich in spite of it
[1:22:34] all you see what the scripture said but
[1:22:35] though are rich
[1:22:36] you are rich in spite of it all your
[1:22:38] security lies in him
[1:22:40] who is your shield an ex exceeding great
[1:22:43] reward
[1:22:43] your kingdom is yet to come but it will
[1:22:46] come
[1:22:46] and it will be an everlasting one yes i
[1:22:49] am mindful of your trial and woes
[1:22:51] i know how hard it is to get along but i
[1:22:54] will remember all of this when i return
[1:22:55] to claim you as my own
[1:22:57] and then i will reward you that is how
[1:22:59] buddy branham is bringing it out there
[1:23:02] but evan said there's nothing against
[1:23:04] being rich some have gotcha and irish
[1:23:06] i'm reading same message
[1:23:07] but money can be such a snail
[1:23:10] a snare is a trap so god knows that i
[1:23:13] say some people they want to work for
[1:23:15] you over time they want to go and do
[1:23:16] that
[1:23:16] and before you know it they lost it the
[1:23:18] joy they zeal the enthusiasm
[1:23:20] and and is no longer seek into his
[1:23:21] kingdom his hustle
[1:23:23] grind make it all kind of thing and and
[1:23:25] before you know you can't find him
[1:23:28] and you gasp himself up
[1:23:32] and they take no scriptures out of
[1:23:33] context
[1:23:35] they want to hold on to just the few two
[1:23:36] scriptures about about wealth and they
[1:23:38] want to
[1:23:38] drive that home and they lose their soul
[1:23:40] in them
[1:23:42] so you have to balance it what does it
[1:23:43] profit the man to get you all we're
[1:23:44] going to lose his soul
[1:23:45] it's about finally balance but that
[1:23:47] balance comes from getting connected to
[1:23:49] the mind of god for your life
[1:23:51] who promised to take care of you
[1:23:52] promised to bless you so he was given
[1:23:55] comfort in this eight i know your works
[1:23:57] i know your tribulation i know your
[1:23:59] poverty
[1:24:00] butterworth rich you have access to the
[1:24:02] bunker by the sky your father owns the
[1:24:04] cattle in a thousand hills
[1:24:05] what you have to worry about don't take
[1:24:07] don't taught up tomorrow don't worry god
[1:24:09] will make sure you eat
[1:24:10] david say i've never seen the righteous
[1:24:12] forsaken i've never seen a sea bed
[1:24:14] big
[1:24:19] the story one time i think somebody i
[1:24:21] don't even but a brandon preacher
[1:24:23] i believe that he did uh or buddy the
[1:24:25] person was praying for food
[1:24:27] and the neighborhood them and say well
[1:24:30] everyone buy the food and put it
[1:24:32] on the step so that they think it was
[1:24:34] god bring it
[1:24:36] and they heard the prayer and they went
[1:24:37] and blinded you from a person he said
[1:24:38] how many person opening on cd food
[1:24:41] they say thank you lord for the food
[1:24:42] that the devil reported but thank you
[1:24:44] for
[1:24:44] sending it
[1:24:49] god will ensure that you are blessed
[1:24:52] anybody with me tonight i don't want to
[1:24:55] be too much longer i'm not
[1:24:56] going to finish tonight and then he goes
[1:25:00] on
[1:25:00] i know thy works and tribulation and
[1:25:03] poverty
[1:25:04] but they are rich and i know the
[1:25:06] blasphemy
[1:25:08] of them would say they are jews and are
[1:25:10] not
[1:25:11] what are the synagogue of satan that's a
[1:25:14] powerful one
[1:25:14] i want to read that one in the amplified
[1:25:18] all right i know you're suffering on
[1:25:19] your poverty but you are rich
[1:25:21] and how you are blasphemed and slandered
[1:25:25] by those who say they are jews and are
[1:25:27] not but
[1:25:28] are a synagogue of satan in other words
[1:25:30] in the amplified said they are jews only
[1:25:32] by
[1:25:32] blood and do not believe and truly honor
[1:25:36] the god whom they claim to worship
[1:25:41] that's powerful huh so but ibrahim went
[1:25:44] and linked into this
[1:25:45] and speak about the synagogue of satan
[1:25:49] and the false vine and the fact that
[1:25:51] these
[1:25:52] jews who were saying that they are jews
[1:25:54] and are not are really liars
[1:25:57] and he was speaking about the fact that
[1:25:59] they lie so much till they begin to
[1:26:01] believe it
[1:26:04] scary so he said thus for
[1:26:08] men to swear they were jews would give
[1:26:09] them a preeminence and a claim to
[1:26:11] originality
[1:26:12] tell a lie listen stick to it never mind
[1:26:14] fact or history
[1:26:16] just say it and keep saying it to the
[1:26:17] people and sooner people will receive it
[1:26:22] now why do we have a people mix in the
[1:26:24] framework of the church calling
[1:26:25] themselves jews
[1:26:27] and we're going somewhere the reason is
[1:26:28] this since they were liars they could
[1:26:30] make any claim they wish
[1:26:32] they could say what they wanted let's do
[1:26:33] it while and then stick to in
[1:26:35] and stick to it and in this case it
[1:26:37] would be lined with a very powerful
[1:26:39] thought in mind so brother branham was
[1:26:42] saying this that
[1:26:43] the the thought of the black stream me
[1:26:46] was in this in the door it goes out
[1:26:48] saying they were blaspheming the true
[1:26:49] church so brother branham was bringing
[1:26:52] out that
[1:26:53] the group that inched its way ever so
[1:26:56] slowly into the church by its deeds no
[1:26:59] longer fears exposure but is openly
[1:27:02] organized in a group of its own
[1:27:04] assembling and but ibrahim was saying
[1:27:06] this word synagogue
[1:27:07] is different from church it means it's a
[1:27:09] gathering of people
[1:27:10] so he was bringing out how in this age
[1:27:13] this gathering of people began to grow
[1:27:14] in strength
[1:27:15] who believe their own lie who lied so
[1:27:18] much
[1:27:19] they could have claimed being jew by
[1:27:21] blood but the reality is they were not
[1:27:23] of the truth but they were among those
[1:27:26] who had the truth
[1:27:27] anybody with me tonight and he was
[1:27:30] bringing out that this was the spirit of
[1:27:31] the
[1:27:32] antichrist that started way back he said
[1:27:35] he's praying
[1:27:35] and christ was not in the church ages it
[1:27:37] started before that
[1:27:38] and that's why he typed out how the the
[1:27:41] children of israel
[1:27:42] when they wanted a king that was the
[1:27:44] spirit of the antichrist
[1:27:45] and i actually read this quote uh i
[1:27:47] think was the first sunday of this year
[1:27:49] where brother branham said that just as
[1:27:52] the early church started out
[1:27:54] under the pure ministry of the holy
[1:27:55] spirit i'm getting ready to close in a
[1:27:57] bit
[1:27:58] with signs and wonders and
[1:27:59] manifestations such as prophecy tongues
[1:28:01] and interpreting so forth
[1:28:02] so in the days of israel when they left
[1:28:04] egypt they were under the leadership of
[1:28:07] the spirit of god
[1:28:08] manifesting in gifts god was the leader
[1:28:10] of the people
[1:28:11] actually he was their king he was a
[1:28:13] father king
[1:28:15] he took care of israel like a man cares
[1:28:16] for his family he fed them for their
[1:28:18] battles
[1:28:19] smooth away their difficulties settled
[1:28:21] their problems he just
[1:28:22] busied himself over them they were the
[1:28:25] only nation
[1:28:26] to which he was truly god but one day
[1:28:28] they got to looking around
[1:28:30] and they saw the philistines and other
[1:28:31] nations with kings over them
[1:28:33] it caught their eyes and they decided
[1:28:36] that they ought to
[1:28:37] humanize their leadership so they wanted
[1:28:39] the king
[1:28:40] now god was going to humanize the
[1:28:42] leadership himself
[1:28:44] in the person of the lord jesus christ
[1:28:46] but they got ahead of him
[1:28:48] and this is where i brought this out
[1:28:50] satan knew the plan of god
[1:28:52] so he put it in the heart of the people
[1:28:54] to get ahead of god the word
[1:28:57] so brother branham was bringing this out
[1:28:59] to show that even back then
[1:29:01] because of satan's knowledge of the plan
[1:29:03] he put it in their hearts
[1:29:05] and he said now this is of those this is
[1:29:07] the same
[1:29:08] spirit that's working his way out to
[1:29:10] jews people who in other words
[1:29:11] they're in church but they're not of
[1:29:13] church
[1:29:15] they profess to be believers but they're
[1:29:17] really not
[1:29:18] they're really liars because their lives
[1:29:20] their testimony
[1:29:22] it's not just that they're unbelievers
[1:29:24] you know but they are the synagogue of
[1:29:26] satan
[1:29:26] in other words there are only two
[1:29:28] influences
[1:29:30] so if they're not the truth of the true
[1:29:32] binding of the false mind
[1:29:33] there's no other vine it's like it's
[1:29:35] like a there's no other vine all right
[1:29:38] can the church say amen how tragic that
[1:29:42] was but ibrahim said
[1:29:43] that whole choosing of saul that whole
[1:29:45] rejection of samuel and rejection of god
[1:29:47] he said how tragic that was little did
[1:29:49] they realize
[1:29:50] that when they were asking god to let
[1:29:52] them be like the rest of the world
[1:29:53] they were rejecting him because god had
[1:29:56] ordained that his people
[1:29:57] act different from the world they are
[1:30:00] not of the world
[1:30:01] they don't look like the world they
[1:30:03] don't act like the world they are
[1:30:04] crucified unto the world and the world
[1:30:06] is crucified
[1:30:07] unto them and by the brain i'm saying
[1:30:10] i'm closing on to this
[1:30:11] so he was making a point here is that
[1:30:13] them which say they are jews right
[1:30:16] so it doesn't matter if you call
[1:30:17] yourself a christian you know and when i
[1:30:19] read this
[1:30:20] over the years in this message i have
[1:30:22] seen so much different kinds of
[1:30:24] behaviors
[1:30:24] that make you wonder if these people
[1:30:26] even know jesus
[1:30:28] this is message believers if they even
[1:30:30] know the lord
[1:30:31] i reach even knowing the messenger of
[1:30:32] the prophet but they are saying that
[1:30:34] they are christians
[1:30:35] they're seeing any message they're
[1:30:37] saying they believe but how could you
[1:30:39] say you believe the message and you
[1:30:40] can't shake my hand
[1:30:42] how could you say you're in a message
[1:30:44] and your behavior is not christ-like
[1:30:46] because to be a christian is to be
[1:30:48] christ-like it's not to be like other
[1:30:50] people in church it's a be like christ
[1:30:55] and jesus even though even even even if
[1:30:58] i'm a judas
[1:30:59] jesus said judas whatever you do do
[1:31:02] quickly he never even tell them other
[1:31:03] brothers
[1:31:04] what jesus had to go and do they taught
[1:31:05] jerusalem by something to bring back to
[1:31:07] eat
[1:31:10] jesus didn't even expose judas that's
[1:31:13] the nature of christ
[1:31:14] and he knew what it was he knew what he
[1:31:17] didn't treat judas no different you
[1:31:18] don't think jesus knew all along what
[1:31:20] judas was
[1:31:21] who he was in fact whatever said judas
[1:31:23] was there when jesus
[1:31:24] gave power to his disciples jews were
[1:31:26] there casting out devils with them
[1:31:29] isn't that right so
[1:31:32] not because you say you're jew because
[1:31:35] what ibrahim is saying here
[1:31:37] them which say they are jews and are not
[1:31:39] but are the synagogues of satan but
[1:31:40] say it doesn't matter if you call
[1:31:43] yourself a christian
[1:31:44] anyone can do that the point is whether
[1:31:48] or not you have the spirit of god in you
[1:31:51] and having the spirit of god in you is
[1:31:53] not about knowing scripture
[1:31:54] because or believing scripture even
[1:31:56] because we know it the devil believes
[1:32:00] amber ibrahim brought out the devil
[1:32:02] knows scripture better than any one of
[1:32:04] us
[1:32:05] the devil knows scripture you never
[1:32:07] believe and he trembling
[1:32:08] and they have message believers who are
[1:32:10] not troubling
[1:32:12] because the fear of the lord is the
[1:32:14] beginning of wisdom
[1:32:16] so it is not what you're as but over
[1:32:18] this is not what you profess
[1:32:20] is what you possess all right so it
[1:32:23] doesn't matter if you call yourself a
[1:32:24] christian
[1:32:25] anyone can do that the point is whether
[1:32:26] or not you have the spirit of god in you
[1:32:28] for without the spirit you are reprobate
[1:32:31] you are
[1:32:32] none of his and i will close out there
[1:32:35] we have done two verses tonight
[1:32:38] and we are in chapter 2 of revelation
