Psalm 7 17. one week from verse 1 to 18. Isaiah 40 from verse 28 31 and acts 1 8 tonight so from Psalm 71 in the O Lord do I put my trust let me never be put to confusion deliver me in thy righteousness and cause me to escape under me and save me with all my strong habitation where unto I may continue to Resort there was given Commandments to save me thou art my rock and my Fortress Deliver Me O my God out of the hand of the wicked out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man for thou art My Hope oh Lord God Thou Art my trust from my youth by thee have I been holding up from the womb though what he that took me out of my mother's bowels my praise shall be continually of Thee I am as a Wonder unto many but Thou Art my strong Refuge let my mouth be filled with thy praise and with I honor all the day cast me not often the time of old age for sake be not when my strength feel it for my enemies speak against me they lay wait for my soul take Congress together saying persecute and taken for there is none to deliver him oh God be not far from me oh my God make his for my help let them be confounded and consumed that are adversaries to my soul let them be covered with reproach and dishonor that seek by hurt but I will hope continually and will yet praise thee more and more my mouth shall show for thy righteousness and thy salvation all the day for I know not the numbers thereof I will go in the strength of the Lord God I will make mention of thy righteousness even of thine only oh God I was taught me from my youth and either to have I declared I wondrous works and also when I am old and gray-headed O God forsake me not until I have showed thy strength unto this generation and I power to everyone that is to come Isaiah 40. we want to read verse 28 has thou not known has thou not heard that the Everlasting God the Lord the creator of the ends of the Earth fainted not neither is weary there is no decision of his understanding he giveth power to the faint and to them that have no Mighty increase that strength even the youth shall faint and be weary and the young men shall utterly fall but thee that read upon the Lord shall you their strength they shall monk the brings us eagles they shall run and not be wary they shall walk and not faint or final scripture acts 1 8 familiar scripture where he shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you and you shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and Lord Judea in Samaria under the utmost part of the earth let's pray one more father we read your word and we pray your presence will come down on your will and Speak Life lord lord your prophet prophesied he said oh God he said I I come to lay some seeds and I hope these men may take this word and and make it come to life Lord May the will come to life tonight oh praise the lord it's good to be here tonight who praise God so have a title tonight God's Earthly strength is his word made flesh and I have an inspiration I will go in the strength of the Lord that is sticking from the Psalms that we read tonight I have two context scripture and this from judges you of the final reader judges 16 6 and the lighter said to Samson tell me I pray thee wherein thy great strength light and where it thou might just be born to afflict thee oh praise God somebody always trying to find out what is your strength not because they want to admire your strength and say you're strong you know but to see how they could bind you and bring you down that's what the devil job he was you want to find out your strength to ban you and bring you along amen next context scriptures in John 3 1 8 1 to 80 there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus a rule of the Jews that same came to the the same came to Jesus by night said unto them Rabbi we know that what a teacher come from God for no man can do these Miracles that they'll do is except God be with him so Jesus answered and said unto him verily very less unto you except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God sent him how can a man be born when he's old can he enter the second time in his mother's womb and be born and Jesus answered very very that's absolutely absolutely identity except my mom be born of water and of spirit wooden Spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God duck which is born of the flesh's flesh first but that was one of the spirit and spirit second but marvelous you must be born again the wind blew it where it listed and thou hearest the song thereof but can't not tell when should commit and where did it go it so is everyone that is born of the spirit you can't pin them down they move as they feel led they move as they feel led by the spirit because the spirit is sent to lead his sons and daughters of the Living God okay let's go tonight could you think of a businessman how how far our church is behind could you think of a businessman that started a business a striving business and he got to get some help right quick and he go to a bunch of dead men corpses and saying would you come and work for me benefit to him that's the reason the organization never Rises a bunch of dead unbelief congregating themselves together like Nimrod like Kora all down to the eight he never use it he never did use organization he can't do it it's already out of the will of God it is Out Of Reach it is Out Of Reach so you see God have to come to individuals because he can't use that organization how could you go to a man that could move paralyzed head hand foot and tell him you want to run a race foot race for you run this race with patients lay aside how could you do it when the man can't move he is paralyzed you have got to get that paralytic off of him first then he can run so we find that this man has got to be born again in order to be active or all right or be born of the flesh you have the wisdom of the world and the wisdom of the world obey his fleshly teacher but to be born of the spirit is that though is that right to be born of respect that's something else the born of the spirit is to believe and obey the teaching of the Bible by the Holy Ghost so the Bible is the absolute Oh Glory to whoever the Bible say you have to believe because God have to be big enough to know what he write inside of here hallelujah God have to be wise enough to know no Mystics inside of there not a comma not a foreign [Music] [Applause] let's go watch to be born of the spirit is to believe and obey the teaching of the Bible by the Holy Ghost and a man that I was born of the spirit will obey God's word regardless of what any tradition tell him because what the elders say the minister Association say well this one said what the Bible said I'm holding on to it what the scripture said hold on to it because the prophet came to reveal the scriptures Hallelujah he come to reveal the Bible is that right all right I'm against organized religion to be born of the spirit is to believe and behave yourself in the spirit behave not just believe behave yourself in this world is to understand and believe with your heart that Jesus is Christ and this is his word and no other words can be added to it or taken away from it without your name take note of the book of life that was a strong one if you add one thing to it your tradition one thing from it he said your name shall be rubbed of The Book of Life oh Blessed Be There of the Lord now regards of the flesh the nomination teaching is contrary to the Bible because this is denominational teaching Born Again means to be built from above the new bird put it from above then we are active in the things from above isn't that right for it is himself acting his word through you to be born against be born from above not your first birth not the mommy and daddy business no from above my father had revealed unto you born from above from above this is a real father this is from heaven isn't that right is to be booted from above then we are active in the things from above for it is himself himself acting his word through you so this is a word brain justification is the word that's the bride Oh Glory the God signification was the word that was the bride so when Luther preached justification the word made flesh that was God strengthened here that challenge the Catholic church that was the pride what Give the Lord a shout because that was the word required for that hour for Glory to God when sanctification came Wesley on the Earth was the word made flesh it was the word living through him in sanctification Hallelujah that was God's strength Earthly strength because I was the word made flesh oh God and then come Pentecost and now here you are here tonight and Perfection is required oh give the Lord some Praises o glory to God it have to start somewhere Oh Glory to God if we're going to have a crop it have to start somewhere you have to stand by a seed then we know when they see the seed the crop is coming but they don't have to go through a process you have to put the seed in the ground then the seed go through a process a stalk a castle of wheat a go into a process that's the history of the church ages a process to come back to the original or glory to God so once we hit the seventh step once we hit this last age God is bringing us back to the original the spice and the prophet to turn our hearts back to the faith of the fathers because the faith of the fathers was the original or give the Lord some praises glory to God nothing short of that oh Gloria Capri shutting short of that Hallelujah back to the original amen now what you may be seated now remember he didn't say you ought to be born again you say You must must now as English-speaking people understand what the word must means it's absolutely you've got to do it it's a must there's an I believe the message this they must be born again I believe brother Branham that's not good he must be born again who said that no Jesus said that don't give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah Jesus said that first message first teaching First Gospel you must be born again Hallelujah that which is born of the flesh is flesh that Festival of GCE CXC and degree but they're still flesh that maybe have a doctorate and a PSC but it's still fresh but that which is born of the spirit is Spirit it may be illiterate it may be carried or right but the spirit will give the Lord a shout in the house tonight Oh Glory to God hallelujah hallelujah your glory to God you don't have to be able to read or write to be born of the spirit glory to God Amen Hallelujah must be born again Hallelujah and if you could take that word this morning and break it down what it means that it's totally impossible then it's that essential that great it's totally impossible to enter the kingdom of heaven or even see it until you're born again so many different interpretations of what that were born again you have to seek it out with all our hearts to see what it means there's not a person that want to go to torment there's nobody you don't drive hundreds of miles over and spend your living your money to come to church to shake hands and and so on like that to praise God it's not right it's people that love God isn't that right they want to see what they want to do what is right isn't that right so no matter how much we try to think we are right in saying a Creed or joining a church we are still what we are until you're actually born again of the spirit of God you must be born again you can't behave yourself somebody else you could just keep it on keep it in keep it in until a bad baby show up because you are you Hallelujah you know what I'm saying the change has to come within no man can't change you psychological changes like temporary relief you have to be delivered you have to be free set you free if I have to come down and blow that demon in your soul that snake whatever I'm call it you have a snake in your heart it's fired you're baptized that you stay still there you say again I'm smoking snakes still there you tell them read play tape press play this snake's still there until fire comes that snake I'm moving until Fire come that way we will preacher the fire come and I'm looking for the fire tonight not next week tonight oh Gloria caught the fire after come something after happens inside of you you have to want it Oh Glory to God you have to want it Glory you have to desire it yeah yeah what is it it doesn't change you let's back up a little bit no matter how much you try to think we are right and sing a Creed joining a church yeah the best mystery Villa he is now he's telling you we're going on the world today and I see the plane plane plane you change but you see the plane plane plane it's in a plane on the standard plane that doesn't make you plain you still have the life to live it can make a gifted brother a Christian minister a man of God or Elder whatnot that gift and make it that gift with all the gift and we're preaching and whatnot he said they'll pay your bills yesterday on the yard instead of The Changing Times I'll go flat yeah I know angel with wing that you're flying and you're escaping this and escaping that you are in the world but not of the world you're facing the music just like everybody else you think you are more than somebody here because you're a Son of God you have to deal with everything that's coming to you every day is a fight every day is a battle every day and a battle every day you're dying daily every day you have to turn your head Oh Glory to go from them characters outside there we'll get the Lord some Praises you're backing every single day you know they're not a one-time shopping you know you're fighting for your life you're fighting to live you're fighting to die you're fighting for the word man flesh you're fighting to be in the spirit you're fighting to stay alive oh give the Lord some praises [Music] join in church changing the ideas your good intentions will do as good as my scene is still not right something got to happen the new boot is an experience something has that takes place so it is not what that brings a new birth now the different judges say you have to accept this believe this that's all right that isn't it oh my to be born again the Bible it is to be born again why because we have been sponge sin shaping iniquity come to the world speaking lies that shows us that our nature to begin with is sinful not your intentional your nature your nature is sinful so that's why you have to get a blood transfusion or a major transfusion or something that affects your nature that's why the children are sweet as they are and innocent they are they will go wrong because of the nature we are condemned because of our nature Oh Glory the ghosts are perfect nature practicum on the earth see it virtue knowledge that intention the temperance patience call this broadly kindness have to be made flesh perfect nature that was Jesus a perfect man on the earth Oh Glory the God he come to correct this corrupt nature he come to correct this whole thing oh a new heart I will give you I will take out your Stony heart I will give you a new spirit who glory to God to prepare for the Holy Spirit Well I'll sanctify your spirit okay get nice with your neighbor Hallelujah nice with your friends you stop being cranky because I'll give you a right Spirit I'll give you a new heart I'll give you a Sanctified spirit and I'll go put my spirit inside her there oh Glory the god of the word would become flesh and when the world become flesh the invisible become visible oh go help me tonight oh glory to God do you hear what I'm saying Oh Glory to God I thought word express word made flesh then the invisible become visible oh praise God praise God Hallelujah Hallelujah Jesus said you can take all he said you can take all the thoughts do all the dreaming of it read it study it examine it and everything else and you can't help yourself so that throws it all out I'm so glad it does because if it laid in the thought of knowing something smart we poor illiterate people will be left out but we wouldn't have a chance but God changed it never had it that way in the beginning the churches always make it complicated but God makes it simple so it's brought down into a place where all of us can see all of us can have it it's for whosoever will it is that simple Oh Glory to God when Jesus died the veil of the temporal's rent from the top to the bottom Oh Glory to all them high priest Mysteries behind it he exposed all of it he was showing them he's not long behind there no more drama behind there no more priests holding her back no man stopping you from accessing presence Oh Glory the God God come and release the password of God well Satan tried to fiddle the hack no access he can't break that code he can't break it with a cold all the hacking skills he had he can't hack that one baby okay the Lord I shout in the house when Jesus died at Calvary he brought the password and the power to get us back to where we fell from Oh Glory [Music] hallelujah praise God praise God praise God praise God you may be seated hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Glory Glory oh something moving tonight when Samson was his anointing Samson wasn't anointing he had a reputation his name used to make people tremble Samson come in Samsung anointed they can't stop him one time I try to close the gate on him and he take up the gate and the post they couldn't stop him he was at Paris to the unrighteous okay the Lord I shout Son of God servant of God and when they saw the anoint him that devil upon them people want to get a crack at him and that's where the anointed Delilah and all she want to find out is where your strength lies where yes thank God how are you talking her after ice cream and cake where your strength lied after taking her to the to the wherever it is way a strength Samson wasn't descending what was behind her he was watching the lighter's flesh he was watching the human element her shape a complexion a color of face your beauty and everything else but he wasn't watching the spirits that was hiding behind that beauty hiding behind that flesh to discover what you wear strength lines because sons of God are strengthened her God put strength in you you know there's a strength inside of you you know you are not the believer right you know who's a believer the word in you is the believer all glory the God Hallelujah the word in you is the believer you are not the believer I know the word inside of you now you have to believe the word inside of you because that's the secret the word is in the bride that's why we pump in all these things all these years they kept this word inside of you and preach my own thoughts on what I feel it has to be prophetic utterance has to be the word because the Bible said man shall not live by better alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God and the milk of God Is His prophets and God said behold I send you Elijah the prophet them Liars want to come and say false prophet and what kind of nonsense no it's too late it's too late this one backside and this one can throw off this Minister stop preaching a message it too late he never to leave he was never no messages he was a deceiver he was a false Messenger to begin with Oh Glory to God over my kind of Revelation now we'll never take it out when Jesus said Upon This Rock I will build my church and the case of Hell will never Prevail against it he crazy he could break the word okay the Lord I shout in the house God makes it simple she's brought them to a place where all of us can see it for whosoever will no no one man cannot save the other it makes no difference what anyone tries to say no man can save another no matter how smart or what his office is or what his office is let him be a pastor priest Bishop Cardinal Pope he cannot have one thing to do with saving him as life so if you come here you're finished are you foolishness man controlling people like if they control the book you have a big key and he control the book and he editing your name he could edit that book your name was written before that money whom you talk before the foundation of the world God put your name in Lamb book God is not put in your name because you're behaving good now to be a bad last week you put your name down when it be a bad he think of your name when you believe God you put him on your name that's how God really is this he'll get frustrated because you have more bad times than Good Times if God had to run his building like that when you behave got tick or God taking him off again you know what man God will have no sense after life you have nobody because all these same nature will just act up and after he gets it up make a whole new generation again yes God not doing that so you put your name in The Lamb book of life before the foreign or give the Lord some praises hallelujah praise God the Devil Couldn't keep you whether any Bush whether any Hill whether wherever you're born whatever conditional wrong the devil couldn't hold your back somehow this message had to get to you somehow somebody had to get this word to you because this world has to become flesh this message gonna live we will not all be preaching like this this message going to live Oh Glory to God they're going to live it's going to live God said so and God can't like because God's strength have to be manifested on the earth glory to God hallelujah glory to God Jesus at Calvary look weak he looked weak weakness weakness interpret meekness for weakness you look weak on Calvary looked like I was defeated but give him two more days when Resurrection morning come and then guards guarding the tomb they put the Roman seal and the tomb seal was busted God knock aside Stone roller aside power come forth Oh Glory to God this problem look weak despite my look insufficient you might even be looking like a bride but one of these days he said you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost come upon you you shall be Witnesses Oh Glory to God unto me who me Jesus [Music] [Applause] so this message will produce a bunch of Jesus people he has a witness nobody else you shall be Witnesses unto me who is it me Jesus as when I hear people preaching I want to hear they talk about Jesus who are they talking about where somebody testifying I wonder who to testifying about this modulated when they passed out there's about this and and done by we I know we have a show have we seen it so keep your soul keep it keep it like how you see in it see it so says we would see Jesus at the end of the day all what we preach we have to be able to see Jesus amen all right so no matter all smart no matter what his office is and then we pass the priest bishop or Pope he cannot have one thing to do with even a man life because he's a sinner himself born in sin shape iniquity common the world speaking life is a lot to start with I ain't preaching nothing a liar trying to be comfort a lion trying to bring like Holiness a whole liar Hallelujah watch and what he would still be alive if he's contrary to God's word and God's plan but God made a plan for man to be saved and a man cannot add anything to that plan it is God's plan isn't that right let every man will be a lion man be true it's not right remember the first thing until you're born again you'll never understand twice he spoke it except you'll be born again Hallelujah get the Greek translation very nice unto you watch category you find not see with your eye but see with your heart you cannot see the kingdom of God with your eyes because the spiritual Kingdom see in other words you're never able to comprehend or understand the kingdom of God until you are born again it's all an unraveled mystery and when you're born again here we go here we go the plans of the Kingdom the kingdom itself becomes real to you no you say I am born again and deny the word how can you be your own life gives you a Vindication of it your own group that you're joined with feather wait till we get down to those things comes by the spirit how can you tell people things of the spirit that's not born of the spirit you have to be born of the spirit to understand the things of the spirit now today we say good church members shake hands with the pastor put his name on the book and son Jesus said you must be born again now in order to be born again it's letting yourself go and die and the spirit of Christ comes into you then your normal yours is Christ in you all sons of God must be the same to be born of the word and spirit here we go are you ready brings us back to the spoken word again like in John 3. to be born of the water and the spirit what does that do it what does what does it do it brings you right back again into the place where you should have been at the beginning So Adam wants to produce another spoken with son how did God speak Adam Let There Be and there was he created Adam in his own image by what the word so animals are spoken one son Adam and in return was supposed to speak for his son he didn't and come on to sex that's where we're born in sin when Jesus come he said must be born again of word and spirit to bring us back to adamic again which was before the fall okay the Lord some Praises glory to God hallelujah hallelujah praise God praise God all right let's continue now this is Brother Branham he was praying they might be saying we are crazy but brother to me right now these things are breaking like this under the supernatural thing I can almost hear the song as the clock of time takes away in the utility I can almost see the Angels standing there saying at the last of the seventh Angel's message so the seven angels of a beginning a middle part and a last part at the last of the Seven Angels message time shall be no more that little loyal bride will fly away in His Arms of Jesus one of these days be taken to the father's house let us think of these things as we go along he said Lord I pray that you'll honor these people for their respects of the world is from the six seal and heal them for Jesus sake out here in the audience lord they're sitting up people just like it was who listened to the Apostle Pete on their Pentecost how he went back to the word and got the word he said Jewel said in the last days these things will take place this is that and the three thousand will leave it unbaptize so and father today we stand here by your grace it's not because it's special people it's because just like the day of the land the ox of the man is Eagle time it's the anointing of the r it's the time you're living in it's the working of the holy spirit in this particular time to prove that Jesus is not dead the things he said he would do just before the evening lights went out and we have seen it do it right down the road we see it the picture taken of the pillar of foul who let the children of Israel who met Paul on the Road God let the people be quickly awakened Lord quickly those who have their names put in the Book of Life when this life flashes across their path may they see it like the little ill-filled woman at the well that day she recognized quickly she knew it was the scripture no father I pray that all will receive you at this time in their hearts we'll separate Forever at this hour that they are finished with sin now this turned out to me you know come into a place where you're finished with sin you have seen it you have done it you have went through it and you want no more of it you're finished you're cut you're draw a line in the sand and you're finished with sin that they might be workers in this last evil day for we realize we have just a short time and the church may go up anytime continuing the lamb might at any time leave the sanctuary sacrifice come from the Throne of God where the sacrifice lives and it's over there's no more hope for the world she is Finnish now we talk about the lamb living the sanctuary then you flip it in the spirit to the Earth then she goes into frustrations great spasms of earthquakes great chickens like it was at the resurrection as Christ Rose from the grave when the saints rise the same thing will take place Lord could be at any minute so he's saying the effect of the Lamb leaving the sanctuary have an effect on Earth with earthquakes and judgment hear this part this is where I get inspiration on for tonight take your children under your arm father now draw your little lambs to your bosom granted and feed them on the word till they are in strength for service that's what get this thing tonight this is what hit me tonight feed them on the word until when till they get strength for service when you when you get service when you're going service when do you see Power after the holy ghost coming upon you so he is talking about a prophecy for for Dynamics you're staying with the word you're feeling on with the word until the end you will pour from behind you have to get strength for service because you have to be put into service oh give the Lord some praises hallelujah hallelujah and they begin to sing the song there's a fountain of Nora funk I know there's a function with blood draws Emmanuel vein you see no friends you that are standing on your feet are trying to accept the sweetness of the Lord Jesus the Same Bible that tells us these things will happen brought them to pass exactly what he said now the promise Peter said is unto you and to your children to them that are fouls he must make the Lord of God shall call you stood up because you want the blessings of God on you and as a servant I pray for you I pray that God will give you the baptism of the Holy Ghost and I wonder if you could do it this in your heart if you're sincere if you will make this promise to God God I from this time standing on my feet seeking this baptism of the Holy Ghost I shall constantly pray and wait until you fill me with the Holy Ghost will you make that promise to God by raising your hands I will constantly pray constantly until you fill me with the sweetness and the goodness of the spirit I offer my prayer for you now as we bow our heads and he begins to pray our heavenly father they are trophies of your presence they know that these words are true because they are yours they know that they have been given by the holy spirit because they are the word of God and they have been convinced that they need you that they need the sweetness of the holy spirit in their life to give them overcoming power and they will receive power from on high receive the power to live a Christian Life receive power to overcome Temptations as a song we're just singing they were gathering up a room was praying in his name they were baptized by the Holy Ghost and power for service came that's what they want power for service to come upon them I pray thee father as your servant you've seen them raising their hands they have made a pledge to you and a promise that they will never cease they will not lay it aside but they will pray until you fill them Lord to a satisfying portion of thy holy presence in their life I offer my prayer in their behalf Lord as yourself event that they would be filled with the Holy Ghost Lord I pray that they will not leave this church until that happens that they'll be right here until each soul is filled with the Holy Ghost granted Lord do what God the almighty he was manifested in the flesh to take away the sins of the world you Rose in a tear they ascended on high you are here tonight and Among Us in the name of the Holy Spirit and we pray father that your precious Lord will fill each one of them with your own self may the blessings of your kingdom in the wilderness to come and one day when you finally reach the end of the road that may be today yet we don't know when it may be but may I be able Lord to be counting among those who cause in a Rapture May these be the ones that go in the Rapture May every person in divine presence all that is filled with the spirit that belongs to God go in the Rapture take these into night father they are yours I commit them in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen oh give the Lord Give the Lord a praise Hallelujah glory to God amen amen amen amen amen amen glory to God hallelujah hallelujah Glory my God the holy spirit is in the building Oh Glory Glory Glory water blood spirit Oh Glory to God hallelujah glory to God water blood spirit Spirit of the life hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Glory Glory Glory Glory High Hallelujah glory to God and feel like the whole church is here tonight glory to God I can't say I wish the whole church was here tonight all who ordained to be here tonight or the end to be here tonight what can tell you tonight God can heal you tonight God can deliver you tonight God can baptize you with fire tonight but glory to God Hallelujah glory Lord God you walk out here completely changed [Music] mine mine Hallelujah this is more than believing this is coming to receiving oh God Jesus had received the Holy Ghost Oh Glory to God that's what he breathed upon them he said receiving the Holy Ghost it was a promise to them oh God not your sin in your soul that's all you need is sealing the soul we know the seed in your soul but we receive in the Holy Ghost standing the Holy Ghost to come inside of there hallelujah praise God amen father son Holy Ghost these three are one what about Spirit the agreeing one so in show where it could be justified without being Sanctified you can be Sanctified without having about the Holy Ghost but you cannot have the fire we have in the Sun the calf this whole don't have an holy spirit because these three are one now if a man set a thought of the justification that all you have to have he's wrong he's got to be wrong then if the church who believes like many of the Pentecostals that the Holy Ghost is it that's all repenting at the Holy Ghost that's still wrong because you've got to get the sanification in there to be cleansed before the Holiness comes in you don't leave out the blood and the new birth as people talk about the Battle of the ghost is the new bird no that's wrong the battle only goes is different from the New Birth the new birth is when you're born again but the holy egos is when the power comes into that bird for service you mean we need Paul for civics you mean some just went but God have some that will be sent and have went and sent men go out and they just went out but then God went sent out that's different because Jesus as my father sent me so send that you and the father that sent him was in him Oh Glory according to me God will still send some out yes he's going to come in and then send them Oh Glory to God so the Holy Ghost comes when power comes into that built for service baptize into the Holy Ghost Oh Glory to God Hallelujah the new birth you have been a New Birth by believing in the Lord Jesus Christ by having faith acceptance of the Savior that's bird pass on death in the life but the Holy Ghost is power for service power for what no we're not talking about 1906 holy ghosts in this age for this message we're talking about Dynamics in the mechanics we're talking about Divine love we're talking about the Supreme anointing we're talking about the person of Christ when all these virtues are sealed inside of you then the Holy Ghost come upon you in the true baptism or give the Lord a shout in the house then that is Christ sealed into you let's go Holy Ghost is Paul for civics so when then talk about born again and applying that to the Holy Ghost many of the methodists were wrong it cannot it won't cope with the scriptures it said the way the scripture got its place over there the Holy Spirit you shall receive the new birth after the snow you shall receive power acts 1 8 after this the Holy Ghost has come upon you and they had already believed Satan alive and so forth but they had to have the Holy Ghost for power watch you shall be Witnesses unto me after the Holiness come upon you here's why here's why because the Holy Ghost is a witness of the resurrection showing that you have become an adult in Christ that's where the power and signs and wonders and everything else because God see that you have become adult in Christ so he says the Holy Ghost as our witness of the resurrection of Jesus Christ Hallelujah and I prophecy I want to speak over the church is this after this morning the holy spiritual beautifully coming down business in his great Beauty I was just inspired to speak them words and say some glorious day that all the gifts that's in the church will be just set aside on the mantle as it was and the Holy Spirit himself will take the church note not the pastor not the minister the Holy Ghost itself himself will take the church in such a control of divine love until the sick will be healed the blind will see the lame will walk without hands being laid on them it will be just one great Unity and that is from then Jesus came o praise the name of the Lord hallelujah Hallelujah such a control of the of divine love one time he said well Faith isn't ripe enough we have to lay in the presence of the sun until it be done lay in presence we have been laying on the word but lean and presence so it's prophesying presence Spirit Dynamics that's why he said when Daniel worshiping the living Christ when them Thunder start to Roar out him moving in and out what happened the anointing in the church then your wealth the other pump people raise your hands praise God give God a praise give God that crap nothing like that you know then you are worshiping the living Christ him moving in and out the pastor he's living Christ come on please hallelujah praise God the doors were shut when Jesus came among them peace be unto you then the disciples were glad when they saw when they saw the Lord you have to see the Lord amen right isn't that right he said why can't the weak lay out in the presence of the sun Yonder and see the are we living in Christ is our Ark but his original way to do it they had his spirit all right we know that they wait upon the Lord see his plan on his original word in its season to be Vindicated that's what we should be doing right now he reveals their fate by his word seen him confirm every plan he promised not man schemes of denomination not making members for his own act they got a message now God told the prophet eat the scroll in the Old Testament the prophet of the New Testament say eat a little book why that prophet and the word would be one the ark is the word of God God has promised his word how to be fulfilled and how now it come to pass when he chooses bride how it would be done it has happened right before you in the name of the Lord and that's my original word the even time message is here oh praise God pray are you ready now by faith Moses is led him to make the choice of the word not by glamor so when Faith looks at God's words it esteem it's better and more valuable than the best the world can show When Faith looks at it when faith can see it when faith in the wood can see the word may manifest it's more to them than all the glamor isn't that right Faith sees what God wants done that's why some people are stuck because they're not seeing what God want done but Faith does make you see that and when you see what go on done you go and do it you don't stay in unbelief or Disobedience you go and do what God wants done I hope this goes in faith doesn't look at the present time Faith doesn't see this here Faith look to see what God wants and works accordingly isn't that right are you ready tonight see it is a long-wind vision it don't lower its sights it holds to the Target Oh Glory to God so Faith don't look at your faces Faith to look at your unbelief see it looking at what God Said knowing that you go tally with that word I bragged with a match that word isn't that right in any way any any good shooter no it's a telescope it's hot it's binocular you don't look down around here if you you don't buy nothing to see what time it is you don't use that but you use that binocular way off so you can't take a binoculars and you're watching now anybody here something wrong with your eye off because you want to see where you're going you want to see what you have to accomplish you want to see what God have for you is that right fear does that fit picks up God binoculars both of them the Old Testament the New Testament and see every promise he made and Faith sees on the under and Faith chooses that regardless of what the present tense say it looks at the end he don't drop his side down to look this way in that way that's the fear that God does isn't that right oh glory to God I'm closing Hallelujah glory to God my my Abraham Abraham father of Faith he met all God Almighty and he called him almighty God which is El Shaddai the Hebrew word is the breast of a woman El Shaddai the strong one the satisfier the nourisher are all man a hundred years old God met him and said I am El Shaddai call Glory and when you're old you're gray-headed you're struggling God come and say I am ill shall I Shad means woman's breasts Shadow means breasted plural he is not only breast God he's the breasted God he was whom before transgression with the stripes we were healed if you need salvation hold on a nurse from the breast of God this word his promise you will come bring yourself back from them rocks of sin and immorality to a Godly sainted person if you are sick by your stripes we are healed just hold on to the other promise of God and nurse what does a baby have to do we are God babies I want you to get this sister you are here we are God babies what does the baby do when it is sick and threatened it's really fretting and sick the only thing you have to do is to pacify the mother pick it up and hold it to the bosom and nurse it that is what the mother do the mother produces the milk and the baby nursery strength from the mother to the baby and then the baby is shaking by the mother strength and when we take a whole of God's promise into our heart we are nursing God's strength the strong one we are nursing constantly and think of the little baby lean and the mother of bosom it stop its fretting as students get a hold of the mother's breasts it stop fretting that's why faith is a substance of what you hope for evidence of what you're not seeing and when Faith take a hole let's have to praise him one time stagger not with the promise of God to unbelief and stop your fussing you worship us oh give the Lord some praises thank you Lord and stop fretting they don't fret anymore it is satisfied it quits This Record it's written and when we get a hold of God's promise when God revealed it to us I am the Lord who healed all thy diseases whoever will let him come have kept his hope I am satisfied I am nursing my strength back from Jehovah almighty God the strength Giver o glory to God I will go in the strength of the Lord pay that weight upon the Lord shouting you their strength they shall monk The Remains as eagles they shall rather be weary they shall walk or not faint Caleb said I was young now I'm old I am just as strong as when I first started out if the Lord be with me I shall be able to possess This Land O glory to God may God give you strength tonight oh glory to God the word made flesh God strength Hallelujah oh my God you're almost finished what encouragement to an old man you may be seated 100 years old as good as dead the womb of Sarah already closed she was born still right and a message I am your strength Giver I am ill Shaddai you're 100 years old but you are just a baby to me lay up here in my arms is like a lame Christians and no no no it's all of us oh give the Lord we need strength tonight I want a nurse on that breast tonight I want to miss every promise that's why I put the inspiration there I shall go and the strength of the Lord what I'm doing there I'm holding on to a promise I'm anointing a promise you have to know how you're gonna go I can't go in my strength no Hallelujah but I will go in the strength of The Lord Oh Glory to God my testimony is inside right here we'll give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah that's right David can say you are my rock you're my Fortress you're my stronger mighty tower oh give the Lord some praises Hallelujah lay up in my arms and take a hold of my promise you just don't see nothing else but the promise then what can you do as the whiskers get old as the here Tunes agree you can still nurse and be satisfied that I'll keep my word the doctor say you're getting worse and worse that don't have one face to you you're still missing from the Press of your shadow God you spoke into my heart you give me the promise all Devils of the hell can't take it from me I am satisfied I will be well I am missing from your child I tell you brother that takes the wishbone and put out and put a backbone inside of there oh my Hallelujah I'm gonna close Oh Glory the Bible said Isaiah 9 second does a child is born son is given name Shall be Called Consular Prince of Peace Mighty God Everlasting father of his kingdom there shall be no end and the government shall be upon his shoulder that's part of the body mind what's his body then his shoulder is his body where is the government on the earth in his body the sin shall judge the Earth that's right Paul said dare you to go to court with one another not take it before the church see since the judge the Earth where is the government going to be upon upon the shoulders his body the government upon his shoulders that part of the body what is it his Earthly strength and this is a quote here God's Earthly strength is his word made flesh in his body here on the Earth bringing it to pass that is his Pokemon that's why I get it from God's history is this word made flesh so God has come to the uni to become the word made flesh his Earthly strengthen the Earth Lord glory to God now watch in the beginning was the word and the Word was God and the Word was with God and the word made flesh no that's as fast the human mind can go as far as we can go back to the beginning is that right but Revelation carries us beyond that isn't that right and the same word that was made fresh and dwell among us because of Revelation bring us before the beginning where there was God taught and our word is not expressed isn't that right isn't that right so in the beginning was the word as far as we can go by theology but before that it was a thought a thought was manifested isn't that right that all become the word as we close you can express it by mental conception but if it becomes a real revelation of God to you you see it before it happened an Express it in word form and that is why the message have to be inspired to people reason it is not enough listening is not enough the anointing have to come upon you to inspire to you and then you are changed Oh Glory to God if the anointing doesn't come nothing happens Hallelujah this was the problem we describing Pharisees there was hundreds of years in rituals reading Scrolls there was pressing play right through every Sabbath day but there was not inspired when Jesus come he found the place where it was written that's inspiration he find a player because he anointing upon him he said the spirit is upon me because he had anointed me if Jesus the word had to be anointed what about a bride in the last days what about you and I we have to be anointed by The Same Spirit glory to God here we go now watch if it becomes a real revelation of God you see it before it happened and express it in word form and that word takes a hole and because material a thought expressed we say if your heart your mind is so instilled with God's spirit until your thoughts become his thoughts when you're mine and your leading and your guiding becomes a direct place or a direct inspiration of the Holy Spirit moving in your mortal being what kind of people ought me to be if the very Holy Spirit have you so embodied or empowered that you don't use your own thoughts you don't use your own mind you don't use your own opinion but the Holy Spirit had you so built until your thoughts and your being is God's spirit expressing itself through you what kind of church it would be what kind of people would be this morning if this Branham Tabernacle this morning was so filled with the presence of God why you didn't use your mind just led by the spirit my and they that are sons of God are led by the spirit of God then the human animal goes out the spirit of God fills the vacancy you empty yourself out then will be when the church prophecy that is when the church will be in his power of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus will walk in his steps in his power in his thoughts in his being in his moving do you see what I mean then your thoughts will become words and words will become material when the church in his power and I believe it's on this road when the church will be so wrapped up in Christ the Holy Spirit mankind saw away from themselves they don't see themselves no they don't talk but not thoughts but they serve God their thoughts move on they refuse the things of the world they move in the spirit yeah it is they move in the spirit they live in the spirit they move in the spirit they walk in the spirit so fulfill the law of Christ then the love of Christ in the human heart moving in the Holy Ghost that great wonderful church will go forth with power and deity here's why because deity will be revealed in human beings by the Holy Spirit bringing the past the thought of their mindless all stand father be thank you tonight for your word we thank you for your love towards us that you would
