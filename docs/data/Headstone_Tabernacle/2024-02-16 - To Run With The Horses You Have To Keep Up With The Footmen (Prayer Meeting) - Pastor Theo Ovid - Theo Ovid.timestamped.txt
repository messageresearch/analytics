[12:18] prayer Heavenly Father we thank you for
[12:20] bringing us together tonight Lord this
[12:23] virtual pray meeting and I pray that

[12:29] minister to your people tonight in a
[12:30] special way have your way with them have
[12:33] your way with us tonight Lord and may
[12:34] the spirit of prayer and supplication be
[12:37] poured Upon Us in a special way in Jesus
[12:38] name I ask it amen and amen God bless
[12:41] you and thank you for being here
[12:44] tonight and I'd like to read some
[12:46] scriptures uh we want to read Ephesians
[12:50] 3 14-1
[12:52] 17 and we want to look at Ephesians 6
[12:55] just one verse verse 10 and then we want
[12:58] to go to to Jeremiah 12 verse
[13:02] 1-5 Ephesians 3 reading from verse 14
[13:07] and in the prayer meeting try to of your
[13:09] Bible that you could follow through in
[13:10] the scriptures and this is Paul Paul
[13:13] saying for this cause I bow my knees
[13:16] unto the father of our Lord Jesus Christ
[13:19] of whom the whole family in Heaven and
[13:23] Earth is
[13:24] named that he may Grant you according to
[13:27] the riches of his glory
[13:29] to be strengthened with might by his
[13:33] spirit in the Inner Man note that Paul
[13:36] is asking for the Believers to get that
[13:40] strength in the Inner Man now the
[13:42] amplifi this verse 16 reads like this
[13:44] may he Grant you out of the rich
[13:47] treasury of his glory to be strengthened
[13:51] and reinforced with Mighty power in the
[13:54] Inner Man by the Holy Spirit himself
[13:58] indwelling your innermost being and
[14:01] personality verse 17 that Christ May
[14:03] dwell in your hearts by faith being
[14:06] rooted and grounded in love now if God
[14:10] seeing us as Christians Believers to be
[14:13] rooted and grounded it means that he
[14:15] want us to go strong firm steady
[14:19] Ephesians
[14:20] 610 a scripture we familiar with finally
[14:23] my brethren be strong in the Lord and in
[14:27] the power of His might
[14:29] and Ephesians that same verse in the
[14:31] Amplified says in conclusion be strong
[14:34] in the Lord be owered through your union
[14:38] with him draw your strength from him
[14:42] that strength which his boundless might
[14:45] provides and this is the main text we're
[14:48] going to read tonight from Jeremiah 12
[14:51] reading verse 1
[14:53] to5 and and it's it's a powerful
[14:56] scripture Jeremiah we know know is a
[14:59] prophet that's was under so much
[15:01] persecution and pressure and everything
[15:03] else and he was getting weary and tired
[15:05] and impatient and he began to speak to
[15:08] the
[15:09] Lord and he said this here righteous are
[15:13] thou oh Lord when I plead with thee yet
[15:17] let me talk with thee of thy
[15:20] judgments so he's asking God about his
[15:23] judgments wheree that the Way of the
[15:26] Wicked
[15:27] prosper wherefore are all they happy
[15:31] that deal very
[15:32] treacherously thou has planted them ye
[15:36] they have Tak me root they grow ye they
[15:39] bring forth fruit thou near in their
[15:41] mouth but far from their RS that's far
[15:44] from their
[15:45] hearts but thou oh Lord knowest me thou
[15:49] has seen me and tried my heart towards
[15:53] thee pull them out like sheep for the
[15:55] slaughter and prepare them for the day
[15:56] of Slaughter how long shall the land
[15:59] mourn and the herbs of every field
[16:02] wither for the wickedness of them that
[16:04] dwell therein the beasts are consumed
[16:07] and the birds because it said he shall
[16:09] not see our last
[16:11] end and God spoke here in verse five if
[16:14] thou has run with the
[16:16] footmen and they have weary thee then
[16:20] how can thou contend with
[16:22] horses and if in the land of Peace
[16:26] wherein thou trusted be we theep how
[16:31] Willl thou do in the SW of Jordan may
[16:34] God bless his word and we want to
[16:37] proceed I want to read this verse 1 to5
[16:41] in the Amplified of Jeremiah 12 just
[16:45] listen carefully the first line is it
[16:48] just so powerful to me it says in verse
[16:51] one of the Amplified of this same
[16:54] chapter I'm going to read this verse one
[16:56] and I'm going to go down to what the
[16:57] Lord rebuke Jeremiah
[17:00] about the first verse Jeremiah says
[17:04] uncompromisingly
[17:06] righteous and rigidly just are you oh
[17:10] Lord when I complain complain against
[17:14] and contend with you yet let me plead
[17:17] and reason the case with you why does
[17:20] The Way of the Wicked Prosper genuine
[17:24] concern he seen people in wickedness
[17:26] seem to be happy going well
[17:29] why are all they at ease and driving who
[17:33] de very treacherously and
[17:35] deceitfully you have planted them yes
[17:38] they have taken root they grow yes they
[17:41] bring forth fruit you are near in their
[17:43] mouths but far from their
[17:47] hearts so he is saying how long you to
[17:49] go and judge these people why take them
[17:51] out and prepare them for Slaughter and
[17:52] everything else then God rebukes in
[17:56] verse five the Lord rebukes Jeremiah
[17:58] impatient saying if you have raced with
[18:02] men on foot and they have tied you out
[18:06] then how can you compete with horses if
[18:10] you take to flight in a Land of Peace
[18:13] where you feel secure then what will you
[18:16] do when you tread the tangle Maze of
[18:20] jungle haunted by Lions and the swelling
[18:23] the flooding of
[18:25] Jordan so I want to say this to you
[18:27] tonight
[18:29] and tonight I couldn't wait to get here
[18:31] to share this with you and I believe
[18:34] this is such an important one the title
[18:36] I put for this tonight is to run with
[18:38] the horses you have to keep up with the
[18:41] footmen so you could
[18:43] imagine you know when you have a kind of
[18:45] army going out you have footmen walking
[18:47] soldiers left right left right and in
[18:49] front of these footmen have men on
[18:51] horses and they may be on a TR faster
[18:54] pace so the Bible God rebuked Jeremiah
[18:58] and tell her if you have raced with men
[19:00] on foot and they tied you out how can
[19:02] you compete with
[19:03] horses and I want to share this with you
[19:06] tonight the first
[19:09] difficulty the first
[19:11] disappointment the thing that does not
[19:13] work out as you
[19:14] expect the same drama does it have to be
[19:17] the same drama from you the same
[19:21] carome the same behavior if now and you
[19:25] can sit outside and comfort under
[19:27] sunshine
[19:29] what about when the floods
[19:30] come We complain too much we are still
[19:36] looking for easy way
[19:38] out be prepared for tougher
[19:42] times if you can't stand in this easy
[19:47] coffee break time that's how I place it
[19:49] coffee break time how are you going to
[19:52] stand when the going gets
[19:55] tough God's response to Jeremiah's imp
[19:58] patience you cannot run with the horses
[20:02] if you cannot keep up with the footmen
[20:04] so Believers get T tonight you have to
[20:08] keep up with the footman in Christ here
[20:11] we go is where your blessing lies it
[20:14] does not matter the season or time we
[20:19] must be able to
[20:21] endure we must be able to be strong and
[20:25] to be
[20:26] resilient and four words that struck me
[20:30] I was meditating on it the scriptures
[20:33] and these four words we're going to look
[20:35] at them tonight
[20:37] steadfast that word steadfast means firm
[20:41] and
[20:42] unwavering the cinnamon of of that word
[20:45] steadfast is loyal faithful committed
[20:49] devoted dedicated
[20:52] Dependable reliable constant trusty
[20:57] determined
[20:58] [Music]
[20:59] stalwart Relentless single-minded and
[21:03] uncompromising
[21:04] Saints each one of us we have to become
[21:09] steadfast the other word I have here is
[21:12] immovable not able to be moved the
[21:16] cinnamon is fixed
[21:18] secure stable rooted you know the Bible
[21:22] talk about the 54 Ministry and people
[21:24] move with every wind of Doctrine and so
[21:26] on they always shaky shaky shaky but
[21:29] this word immovable means mored anchored
[21:33] set firm set fast stuck jammed stiff
[21:37] unbudgeable the other word I have here
[21:40] is
[21:41] resilient able to withstand or recover
[21:45] quickly from difficult condition it has
[21:49] been said that I have a a very resilient
[21:52] disposition I could preach say four
[21:55] Services straight and still be just a
[21:58] strong when I started out is is
[22:00] something that you could bounce back
[22:01] quickly C in strong tough Hardy quick to
[22:06] recover quick to bounce back buoyant
[22:10] difficult to keep down irrepressible
[22:13] adaptable flexible and the last word I
[22:16] have here is
[22:17] strong and they have different levels of
[22:20] it but this is one I chose to pick out
[22:22] able to withstand Force pressure or wear
[22:28] and the synonymous is wellb built
[22:31] indestructible well fortified well
[22:34] defended well protected impenetrable
[22:37] Fortress like solid durable hard wearing
[22:41] heavy duty tough sturdy well-made
[22:43] substantial rugged resistant
[22:46] imperishable longlasting
[22:51] enduring that was good so Saints
[22:55] Brethren Believers this is
[22:58] uh if I could say a desire or this is
[23:00] what God
[23:01] wants for we to
[23:04] become
[23:06] steadfast
[23:09] immovable
[23:10] resilient strong why because he was
[23:14] telling Jeremiah it have tougher times
[23:16] ahead and if what you're going through
[23:19] wearing you you can't handle what's
[23:21] coming next this is the issue and it's
[23:24] amazing how God almost like Tre use two
[23:29] references he use the Horseman reference
[23:32] and he talk about the time of peace and
[23:34] the how how you call it uh let me just
[23:36] go back and find it again and he talking
[23:38] about uh if in the land of Peace wherein
[23:42] th trust they we the how will thou do in
[23:45] the S of Jordan and you could
[23:47] imagine you're comfortable you could sit
[23:50] outside you could look up and see the
[23:52] sun the sky the moon relax yourself no
[23:55] trouble peace and if you run out on that
[24:00] if you can't manage that what about when
[24:02] the Storm come or let's say a tsunam
[24:06] something that you're not expecting
[24:08] because this is life life journey is a
[24:11] space of time when everything seems to
[24:12] be normal in steady Rhythm everything
[24:15] seemed to be quite normal nothing out of
[24:17] the ordinary all of a
[24:18] sudden when you didn't expect it a
[24:22] tsunamy storm a unpredictable Challenge
[24:26] and if you can manage what you have now
[24:29] you will be finished with what's coming
[24:32] next so Jeremiah got a rebuke from
[24:37] God a a a a heavy rebuke from God but
[24:40] listen to Paul in Philippians chapter 4
[24:44] you want to look at it 11 to 13 Paul
[24:46] speaking not that I speak in respect of
[24:49] want for I have learned this is Paul now
[24:53] in whatsoever State I am there to be
[24:56] content I know Bo how to be a beast I
[25:01] know how to abound everywhere and in all
[25:06] things I am instructed both to be full
[25:10] and to be hungry both to abound and this
[25:13] suff a need I can do all things through
[25:17] Christ which strength at me now listen
[25:20] to this in the amplifier and you have to
[25:23] catch
[25:23] this Paul speaks and the amplify not
[25:28] that I am implying that I was in any
[25:30] personal want for I have learned how to
[25:34] be
[25:35] content satisfied to the point where I
[25:39] am not Disturbed or
[25:41] disired in whatever state I am that is a
[25:44] seron by said that line is AUM by itself
[25:47] in other words that satisfaction he has
[25:50] is on the inside and it doesn't matter
[25:53] what is on the outside whatever state
[25:55] he's in and in verse 12 contining
[25:58] Amplified he said I know how to be a
[26:00] based and live humbly in straightened
[26:03] circumstance do you know how to live
[26:05] that way or you could only live in Pride
[26:08] or you can only live with certain things
[26:11] Paul is saying I know how to be a beast
[26:15] and to live humbly in straighten
[26:16] circumstance I know how to enjoy plenty
[26:20] and live in abundance I have learned
[26:23] here we go in any and all
[26:26] circumstances this
[26:28] secret of facing every situation whether
[26:32] wellfed or going hungry having a
[26:35] sufficiency enough to Speare or going
[26:37] without or being in want I have strength
[26:41] for all things in Christ who empowers me
[26:45] I am ready for anything and equal to
[26:49] anything through him who infuses Inner
[26:53] Strength into me I am
[26:55] self-sufficient in Christ
[26:58] sufficiency or this is a beautiful thing
[27:00] tonight he was saying in every
[27:02] circumstance he is ready to face any
[27:05] situation whether he's hungry whether
[27:07] he's wellfed whether he have plenty or
[27:11] whether he's in straighten circumstance
[27:13] straightened circumstance is when things
[27:15] are tough things are tough things is not
[27:17] as you expected you are in straighten
[27:19] circumstance so in straighten
[27:20] circumstance you don't have to cuss and
[27:22] Carry On and fuss because that will not
[27:25] be always a circumstance in times of
[27:27] plenty you don't have to gloat and do
[27:29] like if you know you don't care about
[27:30] nobody else in the world no you have to
[27:33] learn to have plenty and you have to
[27:34] learn to be hungry too you have to learn
[27:36] to have straighten circumstance you have
[27:38] to learn whatever state it is that you
[27:40] could handle it so it is a
[27:44] Consciousness here we go to
[27:47] realize you have to face greater
[27:50] challenges or difficulty than the one
[27:54] you already
[27:56] encountered the prophet Jeremiah
[27:58] complained to God about wickedness and
[27:59] Injustice in the world that complaint
[28:02] was rebuked by God telling him if the
[28:05] horsemen Tire you out how are you going
[28:08] to contend with the horses in other
[28:10] words get ready get prepared for even
[28:15] harder trials that will come your way
[28:18] don't lose Fai or courage in the face of
[28:25] evil and this is where I'm going to kind
[28:27] of wrap up here from Daniel 9 and
[28:31] Daniel he is in bondage with all the
[28:35] rest he's in bondage and he is in the
[28:37] word he's in the books he's looking what
[28:41] Jeremiah the prophet said that 70 years
[28:45] will be in the Desolation and in verse
[28:47] three of n he said I set my face unto
[28:50] the Lord God to seek by prayer
[28:54] supplication with fasting sa and ashes
[28:58] and I prayed unto the Lord my God and
[29:00] made my confession and said oh Lord the
[29:03] great and Dreadful God note the
[29:06] selflessness of his prayer note he was
[29:10] going all out he right he said he said
[29:14] we have
[29:15] sinned have committed iniquity have done
[29:19] wickedly and have rebelled he wasn't
[29:22] saying you know I'm not too bad you know
[29:24] I you know I you know no we have sinned
[29:28] committed iniquity have done wickedly
[29:30] have rebelled even departed from thy
[29:32] precepts and thy judgments neither have
[29:34] we had now let me just pause here a
[29:36] minute note the Consciousness and the
[29:41] awareness in his impr praying that he's
[29:45] talking to God he's talking to the
[29:47] almighty he's not talking to a president
[29:49] or a prime minister or another human
[29:50] being he's talking to the lord of the
[29:54] earth he said we neither have have we
[29:57] harkened unto thy servers the prophets
[29:59] which spake in thy name to our Kings or
[30:02] princes or fathers oh Lord I just
[30:04] summarize it let's jumping a bit oh Lord
[30:06] we said righteousness belong unto thee
[30:09] but unto us confusion of faces as of
[30:11] this thing to the men of Judah the
[30:13] inhabitants of Jerusalem all Israel that
[30:15] are near that are far off all the
[30:17] countries where was driven them because
[30:19] of their trespass that trespass against
[30:21] the oh Lord to us belong at confusion of
[30:24] fa to our Kings because we have sinned
[30:26] against the to the Lord Our God belong
[30:28] mercies and forgiveness neither have we
[30:30] obeyed the voice of the Lord Our God to
[30:32] walk in his laws ye all Israel have
[30:34] transgressed we have sinned against him
[30:36] I'm going to skip down a bit then he
[30:38] said verse 15 oh no Lord God th has
[30:41] brought our people forth of the land of
[30:42] Egypt with a mighty hand but has gotten
[30:45] the Renown at this day we have sinned we
[30:47] have done wickedly and also I want you
[30:49] to observe the reminders that came
[30:52] throughout the scriptures and I believe
[30:54] brother U had interjected it in his
[30:56] sermons about God saying remember me
[30:58] when they come into land remember me it
[31:01] know it come like generation after
[31:02] Generation The Generation that came out
[31:04] and saw the mighty hand they were fully
[31:06] aware of the miracle working power of
[31:08] God and then you have a generation that
[31:11] don't know that haven't seen that they
[31:13] born and you know they not seeing any
[31:15] Supernatural not seeing certain things
[31:17] and they have a lesser intensity in
[31:19] serving God and and and this is has been
[31:22] the habit and then it just fall to the
[31:24] evil but the fact remain is the history
[31:27] show what God brought you out from and
[31:29] and if you look at your own life tonight
[31:31] you will look back and see where God has
[31:34] brought you from now you might be where
[31:35] you want to be but what is our attitudes
[31:38] now towards God that's why he said come
[31:40] back to your first love because when we
[31:41] first came out and God was dealing with
[31:43] us as individuals we had that passion to
[31:46] know the word that cry to get in the
[31:47] spirit that f is that to please God
[31:49] that's what we had and afterward you get
[31:51] cold formal after you get wife or
[31:54] children or or house and car and money
[31:56] and whatever it is we get settled into
[31:58] this world as if this is it but this is
[32:00] not it and now Lord th has brought for
[32:02] thy people and then verse 16 oh Lord
[32:04] Accord to righteousness let me skip then
[32:07] he said I prayed now therefore oh God
[32:10] verse 17 hear the prayer of thy servant
[32:13] and his supplications and cause thy face
[32:15] to shine upon thy Sanctuary that is
[32:17] desolate for the Lord's sake oh my God
[32:20] incline thine ear open Thine Eyes Behold
[32:24] our desolations and the city that's
[32:26] called by my name
[32:27] what this is challenging us to is come
[32:30] out of this let's
[32:33] say this entitlement it's a curse but
[32:36] Isaac preach about it where you feel
[32:39] it's supposed to happen this way who
[32:44] says oh God incline thine ear open Thine
[32:49] Eyes Behold our desolations and the city
[32:53] which is called oh God here oh Lord
[32:56] forgive
[32:58] is not some watching a prayer and
[33:00] reading a prayer he is poting out oh
[33:02] Lord forgive oh Lorden and do defer not
[33:06] for th old sake oh my God for thy City
[33:09] thy people of the called and while I was
[33:11] speaking and praying and confessing my
[33:14] sin and the sin of My People Israel and
[33:18] presenting my supplications unto before
[33:20] the Lord my God yeah while I was
[33:23] speaking in prayer even the man Gabriel
[33:26] angel came now whom I had seen in the
[33:27] vision caused to fly inform me and talk
[33:30] with me saying oh Daniel I'm now come
[33:32] for to give the skill and understanding
[33:35] and un finish just one more verse I want
[33:37] to get here Daniel l32 say but the
[33:40] people that do know their God shall be
[33:42] strong and do exploits I want to
[33:45] challenge you tonight Saints God want us
[33:48] to be strong not to be worried but to be
[33:52] strong in God God wants us to be the
[33:55] people that know him and to know him is
[33:59] to know him by his word and know him by
[34:01] experience to become strong like an
[34:05] exercise you have to work out to
[34:07] exercise your muscle have to go what the
[34:09] pain point and when you do the exercise

[34:32] praying but ask God for your own
