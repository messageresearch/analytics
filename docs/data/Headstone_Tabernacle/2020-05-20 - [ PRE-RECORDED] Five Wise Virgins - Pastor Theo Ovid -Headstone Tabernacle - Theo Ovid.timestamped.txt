[16:09] slumbered and slept on a midnight there
[16:12] was a cry made behold the bridegroom

[16:25] gone out but the wise answered saying
[16:27] not so least yea enough for us and you

[16:34] and buy for yourselves and while they
[16:38] went while they went to buy the
[16:45] bridegroom came and either were ready
[16:47] went in with him to the marriage and the
[16:49] door was shut
[16:51] afterward up came also the other virgins
[16:53] in Lord Lord open to us where the
[16:58] answered and said verily I said to you I

[17:23] a time when we expect a dynamic power
[17:26] Lea come amongst your people Lord and
[17:28] baptize them and fire but the holy goes
[17:30] tonight in Jesus mi ask it
[17:33] amen and amen you may be seated oh
[17:35] praise God
[17:36] thank you lord well I said I still be
[17:39] choice him from Sunday I felt as a
[17:41] different turn
[17:43] a new season among us that the Lord
[17:45] would have bless and they work on the
[17:47] port mightily do we believe that tonight
[17:50] just three little words five wise
[17:53] virgins five wise virgins enough
[17:57] inspiration get ready and still ready oh
[18:00] praise God get ready and stay ready this
[18:05] Christianity is not a part-time thing is
[18:08] a full-time thing it can be a part-time
[18:10] Christian deliver the full 10 devil or
[18:12] glory Liguria be fully committed
[18:15] oh praise God isn't that right no but a
[18:19] Branham he had seen they were the shop
[18:20] you see there's three woman carriers of
[18:22] the natural seed until it matured into
[18:25] jesus ishmael could not be he was born
[18:28] from the bonds woman and Isaac was born
[18:31] of sex between Sarah and Abraham but
[18:34] then come along Mary by the vision put
[18:36] produce Jesus Christ that's gone the
[18:38] world no look there were tree woman
[18:40] there are true men type here churches
[18:42] the woman always tied church's tree
[18:45] denominational ages carriers which must
[18:48] also die so therefore just like the
[18:51] shock and so forth to give room for the
[18:52] seed the seed cannot get right until the
[18:57] shock stalk leaves all try that's right
[19:02] it sucks
[19:03] every bit of the light in them and so
[19:05] it's all it all it was is that plus or
[19:10] praise God so the seed cannot write
[19:13] until everything has died and what the
[19:15] sea does the sea draws all the life on
[19:18] everything so afterwards the life is
[19:21] contained in the seed
[19:22] the seed has the light or glory to God
[19:26] he said you cannot do it no it is see
[19:29] time or bright time or glory the shocks
[19:32] are dead the shocks at Chaya this is the
[19:35] virgin would time not touched its virgin
[19:39] remember it's a virgin good time if
[19:41] you're putting in the hands of
[19:43] denomination it won't be a virgin it
[19:45] will be manhandled she's got to be
[19:47] virgin not touch my interpretation
[19:51] always I love it there will be no
[19:53] denominational manhandling in the virgin
[19:57] birth of the bride or glory to God the
[20:00] bride will be and there'd be no
[20:03] manhandling of the virgin put of that
[20:06] bride that's why the Lord Himself
[20:08] descended with a shout or chlorine I've
[20:10] got to get the bride oh we believe that
[20:13] hallelujah so when the Lord told him
[20:15] pick up a pen I was right he said no
[20:17] what in the last days the true the
[20:20] church bride comes and headstone will be
[20:23] a super race as she nears the great
[20:26] headstone there will be so much like him
[20:29] that they will be in his very image in
[20:31] order to be united with him there will
[20:34] be one and that's why we say the Holy
[20:36] Spirit come down on drying the Holy
[20:38] Spirit has to come down on the
[20:39] atmosphere of praise and worship double
[20:42] United with Christ you have to be like
[20:44] Christ whole globe I really got that to
[20:48] be legend with Christ you have to be
[20:49] like Christ
[20:50] Oh glory to God so therefore in the
[20:53] upper room there has to be worshipping
[20:55] to create the atmosphere for the Holy
[20:58] Spirit to come down the only prisoner
[21:00] coming up on death or glory that God had
[21:02] never killed never not dead they come
[21:04] down in the atmosphere whoa glory to God
[21:06] fast user Street he was preached he is
[21:08] praying for two and a half years for
[21:09] five hours every day the church was it
[21:13] was what was being channeling to prayer
[21:15] lies are being challenged the prayer why
[21:17] it was power coming up on a sanctified
[21:20] life let me say it again
[21:22] it was power comment on a sanctified
[21:24] life and I separated life because God
[21:28] put Wesley in that position to clean the
[21:30] church up for your point of the Spirit
[21:32] or glory of God justification pick up
[21:35] the duty class certification wash the
[21:38] dirty glass back till he goes pour milk
[21:40] into the glass or do you believe that or
[21:44] glory to God
[21:45] so the first son was a spook you see
[21:47] word of God he was given my brain
[21:49] oh my the bride was given don't know
[21:51] what the referee use himself again
[21:54] another son of God
[21:56] so this terminology called bride it's
[22:00] for reproduction purposes so Jesus want
[22:03] to reproduce himself to get a brain to
[22:06] produce more sons just like him so you
[22:09] had to become just like him how many
[22:12] believe that not a church member but a
[22:16] reproduction of the green oh good lord
[22:20] hallelujah the bride was given to her
[22:22] producing self again another son of God
[22:25] and she fell by hide readin she fell and
[22:28] caused him to die the second son spoken
[22:32] she'd word was given my bright like Adam
[22:34] so Adam with his Bridal fell right but
[22:36] before he could marry her she fall also
[22:38] okay then from a little group of the
[22:42] true seed of the word God represent
[22:45] Christ a beloved bride of version of
[22:48] version of his word on tonight we sin on
[22:51] the positive five wise virgins Oh glory
[22:55] to God I wanna touch the foolish I want
[22:57] to talk about the wise one
[22:58] all glory to God she will be a vision
[23:01] for the world isn't that right
[23:04] how do you believe that then what a
[23:07] virgin who knows no man-made crease on
[23:10] dogmas what a virgin knows God said so
[23:13] God said so wife I am healed God said so
[23:16] if I come justified or glory to God I'm
[23:20] called of God I'm already justified I'm
[23:23] already glorified God said so or glory
[23:26] to God I am Joseph
[23:27] there's nothing against me because God
[23:30] said so the bride will be Joseph isn't
[23:32] that right so the bride believes the
[23:34] word
[23:36] it doesn't matter how old you are you
[23:39] believe the word it doesn't matter if
[23:42] you look at you can reduce it again you
[23:44] believe what God says or glory that God
[23:47] see repunit in the heart I'm all woman
[23:51] how I expect child and gorsek is
[23:55] anything to have the Lord if his man is
[23:58] a tough call in the other things herbs

[24:05] miracle they need a body change
[24:08] give me that transformation you need

[24:21] you know because you know what you are
[24:23] Oh glory to God I could change you in
[24:26] what you are to become so that
[24:28] experience transformed Jacob by
[24:31] wrestling with the angel but he had to
[24:34] be convinced he wanted that change you
[24:36] had to be convinced you want that change

[36:59] head headship of Christ not headquarters

[37:26] oh my do you believe that what a harmony
[37:30] jesus never did anything on telecine of
[37:32] the father and the father showed him in
[37:34] supra is his word right

[37:38] of life what would of life he shows her
[37:42] she receives it she never doubts it

[38:06] planted the water will reach it up again
[38:09] I got a great big hallelujah he said
[38:12] here is a secret the wood is in the
[38:15] bride now remember always talk about the
[38:19] Pentecostal age when as use the street
[38:21] time they taught about the final written
[38:23] under the rapture he said but it wasn't
[38:25] because the seed has not come yet this
[38:28] prophet messenger had to come to put the
[38:29] season with the reformer in seed and a
[38:33] promise of lottery of his dream to bring
[38:36] the seat of life or Chloe the core so

[38:59] Pentecostal gobos using men because they
[39:03] didn't have the seed the word but no God

[48:25] years Luther revival went in the
[48:27] nomination moody usually rather last
[48:29] about three years but this one went over
[48:31] 15 years not one denomination as far
[48:34] from it this is see time there is no
[48:38] more shock after the shock is gone it is
[48:41] seed cord is ready and if he isn't doing

[48:51] glory to God in Aliza hallelujah praise
[48:54] God praise God
[48:56] all right what time is that he said see
[48:59] time so let's look back at what we read
[49:02] on Sunday when the baptism of the Holy
[49:04] Ghost was presented a Methodist they
[49:06] couldn't take it no when the see time
[49:10] has produced a Pentecost she can't take
[49:14] it she's organized but she has been a
[49:16] carrier of the seal all glories of God
[49:19] he loves people pass through his message
[49:20] in the 70s and 80s all around they pass
[49:24] through the message Oh glory to God
[49:27] hallelujah but you are seated glory
[49:30] record mmm so what did the prophet
[49:33] prophesied see time will produce what
[49:35] another Pentecost hallelujah
[49:39] let's go but I'm talking about Abraham
[49:41] and where thy wife Sarah she's dealt
[49:45] behind you he's I'm gonna visit you I
[49:48] come on I'm going to visit you according
[49:50] to the time of life and you're gonna
[49:51] have that baby that you're waiting on he
[49:54] said Danny breaking but around in
[49:55] prophecy the Lateran is fixin to for you
[50:01] have held that seed in there long enough
[50:03] now believing you are looking for a
[50:07] common son and he is coming why I can't
[50:11] see that the Lateran is fixin to fall oh
[50:15] give the Lord a shout on that do you
[50:19] believe that when you form speak it to
[50:21] yourself pretty about us and Lord I know
[50:24] the Lutheran it's fixin to fall get
[50:27] ready for I'm still ready Oh blow you
[50:32] and I said get ready and steady Oh
[50:35] hallelujah
[50:37] the latter rain is fixing to fall that's
[50:40] guaranteed
[50:41] we'll get the Lord I showed them all
[50:43] that so the rain is not the problem it's
[50:46] what seed inside of you
[50:48] well can the Lord a shout and if that
[50:51] word seed inside of you you have you
[50:54] will you must reproduce a life of Jesus
[50:57] Christ or glory let go because the seed
[51:00] of God inside of you
[51:02] hallelujah praise God remember there
[51:06] will be such a denominational gathering
[51:07] pretty soon it will be terrific and they
[51:10] will bring themselves together in this
[51:12] Federation of churches and then this
[51:14] kind of change when we put out of
[51:15] operation as far as they know it's at
[51:17] that time that Jesus appeared and he
[51:21] will show which is Brian which is not
[51:22] but remember Christian friends I'm a man
[51:25] I can make mistakes but God being God
[51:27] cannot make a mistake all the words that
[51:31] have been written must be fulfilled so
[51:33] we have got things here in scripture
[51:36] that must be fulfilled and that is one
[51:39] of the things this boy got to come but
[51:43] before the boycott tantrum or the
[51:47] mocking of the beast there has to be a
[51:50] seed sword for God to take a church out
[51:53] of it
[51:55] that's what's important these messages
[51:58] to sorta see that they can take out
[52:00] because the my words are spirit and my
[52:06] words are lies
[52:07] so word is also a spirit and you're
[52:10] gonna find all the foolish virgins they
[52:12] can't get the oil because they don't
[52:14] have the word to turn into spirit
[52:17] Oh glory to God or get the Lord I show
[52:21] Loreena go when you come to Simmons they
[52:23] come my exile

[52:48] them they're fearful try seal and
[52:50] awaited on the promise and when the day

[53:02] because I'm seeing again to grow and
[53:04] spread all praise God it was too small
[53:06] in the upper room Oh Chloe and they were

[1:00:19] hallelujah glory to God hallelujah five
[1:00:24] white version but run to the wise vision
[1:00:32] no oil in the Bible symbolizes Holy
[1:00:35] Spirit that's why we anointed stick with
[1:00:37] oil oil symbolize Holy Spirit so the why
[1:00:40] is that oil in their lamps which was
[1:00:42] Holy Spirit so they were ready to go
[1:00:44] into the wedding supper okay and we find
[1:00:46] Ezekiel 9 he skipped oil Holy Spirit
[1:00:49] simonize Holy Spirit now watch this is a
[1:00:53] vision and this is a vision this was
[1:00:55] foolish version this was wise version
[1:00:56] booted envisions if you take that
[1:00:58] version run it down it means holy clean
[1:01:00] sanctified isn't that right now watch
[1:01:04] two churches these churches are clean
[1:01:06] holy as this one they're all virgins
[1:01:07] they're virgins they're clean
[1:01:09] the only difference was oil it alone not
[1:01:16] be container you know you can have the
[1:01:18] thumb but you have to have oil in the
[1:01:24] lamp it's a dupe reaching containers you
[1:01:25] know you can have structure containers
[1:01:28] you can have abundance of lamps you
[1:01:30] could be mr. lamp mrs. lamb brought a
[1:01:33] lamp you sellin lamps you own lamps your
[1:01:36] mystery a mystery of the lamps
[1:01:39] you'll follow me parts of the lamp but
[1:01:42] it needs oil in that lamp and the Holy
[1:01:47] Ghost if it's in there it produces it
[1:01:51] produces the very same kind of
[1:01:55] it did on pentagon it's not on model all
[1:02:00] you see one very hot is only one Lord
[1:02:09] and one Phaeton and once there it is one

[1:02:16] power one Lord one baptism or give the
[1:02:19] Lord Amen sister Judy hallelujah praise
[1:02:21] God in man

[1:02:25] kind of fire it is on Pentecost

[1:02:31] oil India if if if the churches up no
[1:02:36] fire if the minister have no fire

[1:07:42] feed into that they're not enough to be
[1:07:45] so much in the church that you get
[1:07:46] accustomed with the anointing you get a
[1:07:48] customer presence and God take you

[1:09:19] counseling and talking somebody get
[1:09:22] tired I suppose you want to see in the
[1:09:26] office afterwards and now they explained
[1:09:28] and somebody give our hands talk you see
[1:09:31] whether you've ever come or the answer
[1:09:32] is a good question and it's fire all
[1:09:36] over the place and of course actor speak
[1:09:38] they act when they have bring conviction
[1:09:40] you know your cargo here you know you're
[1:09:42] not doing that you know you're not going
[1:09:43] here this evening because the Holy Ghost
[1:09:45] is upon you you are being led by your
[1:09:47] spirit and has been delayed by the
[1:09:48] Spirit of God they are the sons of God
[1:09:50] you're anointed all right watch watch
[1:09:58] they have church rituals fine ceremonies
[1:10:01] nothing against it Cree's I will shake a
[1:10:03] conscience songs like angels singing
[1:10:06] you can't put a finger on their life but
[1:10:08] still it is wrong it's the pact but not
[1:10:11] all of it that's the kind of misses the
[1:10:13] rapture nice songs nice specials nice
[1:10:17] singing clean life everything order long
[1:10:20] dress nice tie jacket matching and
[1:10:23] everything else that missing in rapture
[1:10:29] but this is frightening the same thing
[1:10:36] with a different version under wise
[1:10:37] version they were both signed by people
[1:10:39] but this one I Dora this one did not
[1:10:41] have oil they would they said we are
[1:10:43] good as you are there is none of us good
[1:10:46] as far as that's concerned
[1:10:47] why you're a bunch of holy rollers there
[1:10:49] is none of us good we have all sinned
[1:10:51] come shall glory and you only will ever
[1:10:53] know it not by joining church not by
[1:10:54] trying to live good but by receiving
[1:10:56] Christ it ain't what I live him is what
[1:10:59] he was in what I am is what he is you
[1:11:03] live and that's your life but he lives
[1:11:05] in you that's a different thing
