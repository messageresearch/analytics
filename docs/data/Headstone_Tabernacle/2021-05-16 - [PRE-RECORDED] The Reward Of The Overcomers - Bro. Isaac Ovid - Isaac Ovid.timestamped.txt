[40:03] reading from revelation chapter 3 and
[40:06] reading from verse
[40:07] 11 revelation 3 and verse 11
[40:11] behold i come quickly
[40:15] hold that fast which thou hast that no
[40:18] man take
[40:19] thy crown him that overcome it will i
[40:22] make a pillar
[40:23] in the temple of my god and he shall go
[40:26] no more out
[40:27] and i will write upon him the name of my
[40:29] god and the name of the city of my god
[40:32] which is new jerusalem which cometh down
[40:35] out of heaven from my god and i will
[40:37] write upon him
[40:39] my new name he that hath an ear let him
[40:42] hear with the spirit
[40:43] say it unto the churches and unto the
[40:45] angel of the church of the laodiceans
[40:47] right these things say at the amen the
[40:50] faithful
[40:51] and true witness the beginning of the
[40:53] creation of god
[40:54] i know thy works that thou art neither
[40:56] cold nor hot
[40:58] i would thou would called or hot so then
[41:01] because thou art lukewarm
[41:03] and neither cold nor hot i will spew
[41:05] thee out of my mouth
[41:07] because thou sayest i am rich and
[41:09] increase with goods and have need of
[41:11] nothing
[41:12] and noah is not that wretched and
[41:14] miserable and poor and blind and naked
[41:17] i counsel thee to buy of me gold
[41:20] tried in the fire that thou mayest be
[41:23] rich and white raiment
[41:25] that thou mayest be clothed and that the
[41:27] shame of thy nakedness
[41:29] do not appear and anoint their eyes with
[41:32] eyes out that thou mayest see
[41:34] as many as i love i rebuke and chasten
[41:36] be zealous therefore
[41:38] and repent behold i stand at the door
[41:41] and knock if any man hear my voice and
[41:44] open the door i will come into him
[41:46] and will suck with him and he with me to
[41:48] him that overcometh will i grant to sit
[41:51] with me
[41:52] in my throne even as i also overcame and
[41:55] i'm set down with my father
[41:57] in his throne he that hath an ear let
[41:59] him hear what the spirit
[42:01] saith unto the churches may the lord add
[42:03] a blessing to the reading of his word
[42:05] you may be seated in the presence of the
[42:08] lord this morning
[42:10] it's certainly a great privilege to be
[42:13] able to come to the house
[42:14] of the lord this morning it is what we
[42:18] do
[42:18] it is what motivates us it is what
[42:21] inspires us it's where we get
[42:22] encouragement
[42:23] is where we get a battle plan to face
[42:26] the week to face the month to
[42:28] face challenges it's where we get a word
[42:30] from the lord to
[42:32] deal with our situation because every
[42:34] answer for our lives is in the word of
[42:37] almighty god
[42:39] every answer to every situation can be
[42:42] found in the word
[42:43] of the lord the psychologist could try
[42:46] the psychiatrist could try
[42:48] counselors could try but in the word of
[42:50] the lord is the answer to every problem
[42:53] that you could ever find on this journey
[42:55] you could find the answer in the word
[42:58] of the lord amen and how blessed have we
[43:01] been
[43:02] in the midweek services
[43:06] there comes a time when your energy is
[43:07] not as strong as it was
[43:09] and then many people look back and say i
[43:11] wish i had done more
[43:13] i wish i had done more and that living
[43:16] with that regret
[43:17] of having the opportunity to do more and
[43:19] not doing more puts us in a very
[43:21] precarious position
[43:23] because one day we all have to give an
[43:25] account and we don't want to be found
[43:27] standing
[43:28] and saying i wish i had done more i wish
[43:31] i had prayed more
[43:33] i wish i had sacrificed more i wish i
[43:36] had
[43:36] done more so while there was strength
[43:39] and life in us we want to do all that we
[43:41] can do
[43:42] for the kingdom of god because heaven
[43:44] and earth will pass away but this
[43:46] kingdom of which we preach will never
[43:48] pass away
[43:49] it is from eternity it is eternal and if
[43:52] there's a seed germ in your
[43:54] soul there is something in you that will
[43:56] pulsate no matter
[43:57] what you did last week last year last
[43:59] month once you come in contact with the
[44:01] spirit and the word
[44:03] that seed in you has no choice but to
[44:05] respond
[44:06] because you have no control over the
[44:08] seed in you that's why the prophet said
[44:10] we are not even the believers
[44:12] but the word in us that we didn't put
[44:14] there that's the believer and that
[44:16] believing seed in our souls
[44:18] is programmed to respond a certain way
[44:20] because once you come in contact with
[44:22] the presence of almighty god and with
[44:24] the word of almighty god
[44:26] it does something to the seed in your
[44:28] soul you could try to cover it up you
[44:30] could try to hide it you could try to
[44:32] put the fire out
[44:34] with your work schedule and with family
[44:36] issues and drown yourself with problems
[44:38] but five minutes in the presence of god
[44:41] is all it takes for that seat
[44:43] to let you know i'm still there i've
[44:45] been waiting for a long time
[44:47] to be reminded and to remind you that
[44:50] you are called for a higher purpose you
[44:52] are
[44:52] not called to be defeated you are not
[44:54] called to be a church
[44:55] member you are not called just to be a
[44:57] message believer
[44:58] but you are called to be a participator
[45:01] and a partaker
[45:02] of his divine nature there's a nature
[45:06] that we are born to enjoy
[45:08] there's a life that we are born to enjoy
[45:10] and the devil's job is to try to keep us
[45:13] from that and
[45:14] he does a good job of that but we also
[45:16] have a job to do
[45:17] we have a job to worship we have a job
[45:19] to press we have a job to fight we have
[45:22] a
[45:22] job to achieve we have a job to succeed
[45:25] we have a job to overcome
[45:26] we have a job to contend for the fate we
[45:29] have a job to fight for our lives
[45:31] because
[45:32] the devil wants our lives but we have a
[45:34] job to fight for our lives
[45:36] you could choose to give up or you could
[45:37] choose to fight you could choose to
[45:39] worship
[45:40] or you could choose to have a pity party
[45:42] and i'd seen nobody know the trouble
[45:44] i've seen
[45:45] there's times to talk about the trouble
[45:47] but the bible tells us that the
[45:49] sufferings
[45:49] of this present time are not even worthy
[45:52] to be compared
[45:53] with the glory that shall be revealed in
[45:56] us the sufferings
[45:57] of not being able to pay the bills is
[45:59] not worthy
[46:00] to be compared with the glory that shall
[46:03] be revealed in us the sufferings
[46:05] in your marriage is not worthy to be
[46:08] compared
[46:09] with the glory that will be revealed in
[46:11] us the sufferings
[46:12] on your job they are not worthy to be
[46:15] compared
[46:16] with the glory which shall be revealed
[46:19] in us
[46:20] these sufferings are temporary pain
[46:23] is temporary sadness is temporary
[46:26] sickness is temporary being defeated is
[46:30] temporary having an identity crisis is
[46:33] temporary spiritual amnesia is
[46:36] temporary being down and out is
[46:38] temporary
[46:40] not knowing who you are is temporary
[46:45] [Applause]
[46:48] you may be seated had it not been for
[46:52] the fall of adam we would have been
[46:54] spoken into existence and we would have
[46:56] been spoken into existence
[46:58] with authority to speak to our
[47:00] situations
[47:01] but we bypassed our theophany and we
[47:03] came to this earth as a proving ground
[47:06] so that in satan's eden which he has had
[47:08] over 6 000 years to perfect
[47:11] god could deploy some secret agents who
[47:14] look like the world they go to work just
[47:17] like everybody else they
[47:18] go eat in places like restaurants with
[47:20] everybody else but
[47:21] there's something different about them
[47:23] there's a white light on the inside and
[47:25] there's an invisible light on the
[47:27] outside of
[47:30] so when you woke up this morning the
[47:32] devil's radar went crazy
[47:36] oh hallelujah when you woke up this
[47:40] morning
[47:40] before you even got off the bed the
[47:42] devil said he's up
[47:43] let's see what he's gonna do let's let's
[47:45] hope he stays defeated
[47:47] let's hope he worries about his pills
[47:49] let's hope he worries about his problems
[47:51] but but
[47:52] when you begin to say thank you lord for
[47:53] waking me up the devil say oh boy oh boy
[47:57] today looks like it's going to be a
[47:59] problem every move you do
[48:02] gives the devil a headache i say let us
[48:05] give the devil the biggest migraine
[48:07] he has ever had since jesus was in the
[48:11] wilderness
[48:14] let's confuse the devil let's confuse
[48:17] the devil this morning
[48:19] how do you confuse the devil by doing
[48:21] what he doesn't expect
[48:26] he may be seated that's how you confuse
[48:28] the devil
[48:29] by doing what he does not expect
[48:32] understand this the devil has one
[48:34] objective
[48:34] to keep you blind to your purpose
[48:39] because mr branham taught us the moment
[48:41] the bride
[48:42] gets to know who she is she's invincible
[48:48] that's very powerful because it means
[48:50] you are already something else than you
[48:52] could even see
[48:54] i'll say that again you are already
[48:57] something else
[48:58] that you cannot even see you got up this
[49:01] morning and looked in the mirror and you
[49:03] saw yourself
[49:04] but when god looked he didn't see what
[49:06] you saw
[49:07] oh you don't hear me this morning and
[49:09] when you got up this morning and the
[49:11] devil looked at you
[49:12] he didn't see what you saw because the
[49:16] devil understands the spiritual realm
[49:18] and when you're in the realm of the
[49:20] natural
[49:20] you see your pills you see your problems
[49:23] you see what happened
[49:24] and you're looking in the natural eye
[49:26] and the devil is saying don't open his
[49:28] eyes don't open his eyes
[49:30] don't let them see that he's a king
[49:31] don't let her see that she's a princess
[49:33] don't let them see that their sins are
[49:35] under the blood
[49:37] let them think that they are still tired
[49:39] like johnny crow
[49:40] let them keep walking around in circles
[49:42] but this morning
[49:46] no more circles this morning no more
[49:49] being defeated
[49:50] this morning no more wondering who you
[49:53] are
[49:54] come the church say man
[49:59] hallelujah hallelujah
[50:03] i'm just talking to you a little bit is
[50:05] that okay i'm inside of this service
[50:07] here but i can't we just having a
[50:08] conversation this morning
[50:10] just having a conversation with life and
[50:12] the struggles of life but the brandon
[50:14] preacher might say why are we so tossed
[50:15] about why
[50:16] why we have all these ups and downs and
[50:18] we go through this and all of that is
[50:21] is to try to keep us in this natural
[50:23] realm that is going to fade away one day
[50:26] and the boss that puts pressure on you
[50:28] he's anointed to put pressure
[50:31] the friends in your school they are
[50:33] anointed to do what they do
[50:35] your neighbor is anointed to make noise
[50:37] early in the morning
[50:40] your name is anointed to put on carnival
[50:43] music
[50:44] the maxi you go into is anointed a mac
[50:46] driver has a choice
[50:48] and he's operating under a law to do
[50:50] everything to influence you cause
[50:52] they're only two influences
[50:54] you either influence from above or your
[50:56] influence from below
[50:59] so everywhere you go it's not about
[51:01] family and friends
[51:02] and work and job it's about influence
[51:07] because you have been marked for a
[51:08] destination the devil un doesn't
[51:11] understand the full
[51:12] specification that defines your
[51:14] existence because the devil dealt with
[51:16] david and david made a mistake
[51:18] the devil dealt with moses and moses
[51:20] made a mistake
[51:21] it's just when jesus came it was an
[51:24] experience that the devil
[51:25] could never forget because this man
[51:28] suffered
[51:29] he wept he was hungry he went and
[51:32] suffered just as we as a man
[51:34] but the bible said he didn't sin
[51:38] and then jesus placed a seed in terms of
[51:40] some predestinated people and said
[51:42] because i live
[51:43] you are going to live also but he didn't
[51:46] tell you he did it because when you were
[51:47] born and you were going to school
[51:49] and you were going to work and you were
[51:51] in the bar and you were drinking you
[51:53] didn't even know that you were carrying
[51:55] a present
[51:57] that there was something locked up in
[51:59] you you didn't even know
[52:00] when you did what you did there was
[52:02] something in you
[52:04] so we come to service to find out what
[52:07] god put in us
[52:11] can the church say amen and every time
[52:14] you come to church
[52:15] and you hear the word is the seed in
[52:17] your soul saying that's me
[52:19] that sounds like they're talking about
[52:21] me wait a minute that's how i feel
[52:23] when i feel the anointing it makes me
[52:26] feel good
[52:27] it makes me feel satisfied if i could
[52:29] just have this
[52:30] all the time i'll be all right
[52:34] can the church say amen
[52:35] [Applause]
[52:37] oh hallelujah so i have a title
[52:42] this morning the rewards
[52:46] of the overcomers
[52:49] the rewards of the overcomers
[52:54] because when you overcome you ought to
[52:56] get something
[52:57] when you go to school and you overcome
[53:00] form one
[53:04] you cannot go to form two until you
[53:05] overcome form one
[53:07] if you don't overcome form one they will
[53:09] keep you in form one
[53:11] until at such time as you have overcome
[53:13] from one
[53:15] overcoming form one is required to
[53:18] experience form2
[53:20] and when you overcome form two you're
[53:22] now ready for form three
[53:23] when i was in school they would keep
[53:25] people back if they didn't overcome the
[53:27] form
[53:28] because you have to pass a test to face
[53:31] another test
[53:33] but the objective of going to school is
[53:35] not to say i overcome form one overcome
[53:37] for
[53:38] you could produce your o-level passes
[53:42] and those passes represent the rewards
[53:47] of the overcomers
[53:48] [Music]
[53:50] now when people are in school there are
[53:52] many excuses and then
[53:53] the excuses disappear when you hear some
[53:56] people's story
[53:58] because there are people i remember when
[53:59] in school there were students who
[54:01] struggled with electricity
[54:02] but at the end of the five years they
[54:04] overcame
[54:06] some who had no electricity had more
[54:08] qualification than those
[54:10] who had electricity so electricity was
[54:12] not the differentiator
[54:14] or the lack of electricity was not a
[54:16] differentiator
[54:18] it was that those that overcame had a
[54:20] tenacity
[54:22] had a drive had a desire
[54:25] had a motivation there was something in
[54:28] them that said
[54:29] what my father went through i am not
[54:31] going to go through
[54:33] i heard somebody say a few days ago he
[54:35] said i grew up in abject poverty
[54:38] and i said to myself when my son drives
[54:41] a university
[54:42] he's gonna drive it on his first day in
[54:44] a mercedes-benz
[54:46] and he said what he said with his family
[54:48] they say he's talking to strappiness
[54:50] why are you talking so and he said i
[54:52] worked hard he's giving a testimony
[54:53] i worked hard and i lived to see the day
[54:56] my son went into university
[54:57] he drove it in a mercedes-benz
[55:01] and he was telling a group of people he
[55:03] said until you say it
[55:06] it could never happen
[55:10] he said the first step is saying it
[55:13] because when you say it it puts it out
[55:15] there
[55:17] and this man i don't know how much of a
[55:20] christian he is i don't know what his
[55:21] testimony is
[55:22] i'm saying but did he read the
[55:24] scriptures we read because
[55:26] my bible says if you shall say to this
[55:28] mountain
[55:29] be moved and don't doubt it's going to
[55:32] do something
[55:34] and natural men break into spiritual
[55:37] principles
[55:38] about speaking into existence and
[55:40] walking into it
[55:42] what about the church of the living god
[55:44] when we
[55:45] know from the prophet's message that the
[55:47] spoken word
[55:48] is the original seed and we are
[55:51] commanded
[55:52] as sons and daughters to begin to speak
[55:54] i'm gonna make it
[55:56] i'm gonna overcome i'm gonna get the
[55:59] holy ghost
[56:00] my son is going to be delivered i could
[56:03] see him delivered i could see him
[56:05] jumping in the church that's how we
[56:07] ought to speak i could see him
[56:08] doing no more i can see nobody else
[56:11] doing normal like my son
[56:13] i can see nobody else shouting like my
[56:15] daughter i could see my wife walking
[56:17] into church one day
[56:19] and not knowing what put on to the house
[56:21] of god
[56:22] that's how we ought to speak that that's
[56:25] how christians speak
[56:26] that's how sons of god speak that's how
[56:29] daughters of god speak
[56:32] he may be seated so we talked about
[56:35] overcoming this morning
[56:37] life is a struggle
[56:41] that's a foundational fact of life
[56:44] it is designed to be a struggle it's a
[56:47] struggle for food
[56:51] if you study biology to say the strong
[56:53] survive
[56:56] so the lion who is slow and can't
[56:59] exhibit stealth he will need
[57:02] because as he moves through the jungle
[57:04] everybody hear him come in by tell me
[57:06] reach everybody go
[57:10] so depending on the situation that you
[57:12] have to overcome in
[57:14] you have to understand your terrain
[57:17] understand your challenge
[57:19] i would say to somebody recently that's
[57:20] why paul could say to the strong i
[57:22] became strong
[57:24] to the weak i became weak because you
[57:26] understood that to overcome in different
[57:28] situations
[57:29] you can't use the same tactic all the
[57:31] time
[57:32] bear in mind the end game is to get the
[57:35] o levels
[57:37] form one form two form three from four
[57:39] from five that's a journey
[57:41] but after the journey and their people
[57:43] the journey is different you know people
[57:44] who play sports in school i wasn't one
[57:46] of them
[57:46] the people who do different things and
[57:48] there's nothing wrong with that
[57:50] and the journey is great there are
[57:51] people at age 50 but real missed in
[57:53] primary school
[58:02] and it's almost like they wanted to go
[58:03] back to secondary school when they had
[58:05] no bills because they didn't take
[58:06] no bills no call from the bank to pay a
[58:10] credit card
[58:11] and they say school this was the best
[58:13] way to get best
[58:15] best
[58:18] but that was a stage in your journey
[58:23] because even all levels is a stage to
[58:26] prepare you for a job
[58:29] and life is about stages and god is also
[58:32] about stages
[58:33] see when i was a child i speak as a
[58:35] child i understood as a child
[58:37] when i became a man i want to go back to
[58:40] primary school
[58:43] when i became a man i put away
[58:48] the childish things
[58:53] when i become a man and listen age and
[58:56] getting older
[58:57] doesn't make you a man
[59:01] there's some 50 year old boy still in
[59:04] primary school
[59:08] because as you get older it should be
[59:10] you get more mature that's
[59:12] that's by design but that's not how
[59:14] everybody lives
[59:15] because we allow different situation and
[59:18] we and we try to preserve
[59:20] and change is what's hard
[59:23] we don't like interruption we don't like
[59:25] disruption we like to
[59:27] do things the same way so whenever
[59:29] change comes it makes us feel
[59:30] uncomfortable
[59:32] but god is a god of change you call
[59:33] abraham he say abraham leave your family
[59:35] leave your comfort zone and come follow
[59:37] me
[59:39] abraham had no idea where he was going
[59:42] he was being
[59:42] challenged to change and and coming into
[59:45] this
[59:46] walk i want to call it this walk not
[59:48] church coming into this walk
[59:49] it requires a mindset of change of
[59:52] growth
[59:53] of development of having to overcome and
[59:56] pause it this way i die
[59:58] daily so this overcoming we are speaking
[1:00:02] about
[1:00:02] is a daily overcoming
[1:00:04] [Music]
[1:00:07] it's overcoming when the pastor is not
[1:00:09] there to see you
[1:00:11] overcoming when the deacon is not around
[1:00:13] it's overcoming
[1:00:14] when nobody from church is there and you
[1:00:16] are confronted with decisions
[1:00:18] and you are challenged to overcome
[1:00:24] we're gonna we're gonna get to the
[1:00:26] deeper part i'm just i'm still talking
[1:00:27] to you this morning
[1:00:30] because people tell me i'm struggling
[1:00:32] and i'm struggling
[1:00:34] and they say it as if it's not supposed
[1:00:36] to be that way
[1:00:40] as if the alternative to struggling is
[1:00:42] is
[1:00:43] somehow not struggling and that doesn't
[1:00:45] exist
[1:00:48] struggling is a permanent state of
[1:00:50] existence
[1:00:51] for the believer you struggle to pray
[1:00:55] you
[1:00:56] you struggle to seek the lord you you
[1:00:58] struggle to because we are in a warfare
[1:01:01] [Applause]
[1:01:03] and until we put the devil firmly under
[1:01:05] our feet
[1:01:06] it will always be a battle every inch of
[1:01:09] ground you
[1:01:10] intend to take will be a struggle
[1:01:14] a struggle in your marriage a struggle
[1:01:16] in your finances or
[1:01:17] struggle in your prayer life a struggle
[1:01:20] to praise a
[1:01:20] struggle to worship that's why david
[1:01:23] said we bring a sacrifice
[1:01:25] of praise into the house of the lord
[1:01:27] sacrifice his struggle
[1:01:30] you have a choice to make to live or die
[1:01:32] to worship or stay dead
[1:01:34] to give god praise or stay where you
[1:01:36] were
[1:01:39] but to him that overcome it i have
[1:01:41] rewards
[1:01:42] for the overcomers hallelujah
[1:01:47] [Applause]
[1:01:50] he may be seated
[1:01:53] the challenge i have is people who look
[1:01:56] at
[1:01:58] those who study remember school he's a
[1:02:00] real nerd boy
[1:02:05] only books only books you need books
[1:02:08] i saw some young people buckle under
[1:02:11] that pressure i know
[1:02:12] i no no no i come in i come in and play
[1:02:16] and life is choice so when you're
[1:02:19] confronted with the situation
[1:02:21] if you leave your books because your
[1:02:23] friend's telling you
[1:02:24] you're the year you're a nerd and you
[1:02:27] don't want to be another when the end
[1:02:28] result come
[1:02:31] and there's some students who they play
[1:02:34] all day in school but at night
[1:02:38] the beaten book
[1:02:41] you have all kind of at night they've
[1:02:43] beaten a real book
[1:02:45] and when the results come and say well
[1:02:46] you was playing all the time how do you
[1:02:47] get nine ones
[1:02:48] i was studying that night
[1:02:52] no you can't get vex with somebody who
[1:02:55] put the time and effort into achieving
[1:02:57] it
[1:03:00] god told you shall meditate on the word
[1:03:01] day and night
[1:03:03] and you will have good success you can't
[1:03:05] convex with somebody who have good
[1:03:07] success because they meditate really
[1:03:09] good day and night
[1:03:11] see a man bless he is god ready like him
[1:03:13] that is why he getting a blessing and
[1:03:15] you don't know
[1:03:16] the hours here in the word when in his
[1:03:19] secret closet when he's not looking for
[1:03:21] attention and nobody there but he crying
[1:03:23] and
[1:03:23] holding on to the horns of the altar
[1:03:25] because the bible told us pray in secret
[1:03:29] so that the god that sees in secret will
[1:03:31] reward you openly
[1:03:36] all of that is a struggle
[1:03:40] but to make time to pray to make time
[1:03:44] to study to make time to be a christian
[1:03:47] you have to overcome how you manage your
[1:03:50] time
[1:03:51] you have to overcome the demands of your
[1:03:54] life your work your commitments
[1:03:56] i remember when i was in university soon
[1:03:59] the
[1:04:00] bell ringer i had no bell but soon class
[1:04:02] then i out
[1:04:04] i had no reason to stay to do what to do
[1:04:07] what
[1:04:10] and i saw young people go to university
[1:04:12] and when class done
[1:04:13] time the lime lime to do what
[1:04:18] after all these years what's the equal
[1:04:20] sign from that lime what is the
[1:04:22] end result what do you have to show for
[1:04:24] all the hours you spend lime in
[1:04:28] what is the equal sign of time not spent
[1:04:32] into what is eternal
[1:04:34] because when you spend time into what is
[1:04:36] temporal there will never be anything to
[1:04:38] show for it
[1:04:40] but when you spend time in the eternal
[1:04:42] there's an eternal house
[1:04:44] there's an eternal road with gold on it
[1:04:47] there's a there's an eternal testimony
[1:04:50] because you are investing in your
[1:04:52] in who you really are can the church say
[1:04:55] amen
[1:04:56] is this helping anybody this morning
[1:05:01] [Applause]
[1:05:03] in the message christ is revealed in his
[1:05:05] own word i'm going to take my time this
[1:05:06] morning so
[1:05:08] buckle your seat belts i wasn't feeling
[1:05:10] 100
[1:05:11] good this morning but now i feel 100
[1:05:13] good brother kangali
[1:05:17] there's some viruses going around he
[1:05:18] never thought he would have had me this
[1:05:19] morning but
[1:05:20] i really want to appreciate my wife with
[1:05:22] some ginger tea without sugar this
[1:05:23] morning and some
[1:05:24] warm water with apple cider vinegar and
[1:05:30] just what the doctor ordered to give the
[1:05:33] devil trouble so if you need to take
[1:05:34] apple cider and water
[1:05:36] if you need to ginger tea or green tea
[1:05:40] or whatever you take
[1:05:40] you make sure you come into the house of
[1:05:42] the lord to at least gum the devil if
[1:05:44] you have no teeth
[1:05:47] if you're walking on a cane use a cane
[1:05:48] as a weapon but whatever you
[1:05:51] got like shambler he just had an ox code
[1:05:53] and he used what he had
[1:05:54] because there was a cause there was a
[1:05:56] need there was a situation
[1:06:00] your heart palpitatin will take it easy
[1:06:02] but keep coming
[1:06:05] blood pressure low take it easy but keep
[1:06:07] coming back pressure high take it easy
[1:06:09] but keep coming
[1:06:10] but whatever you do keep on moving every
[1:06:13] day you're getting closer
[1:06:15] to your inheritance closer to your
[1:06:17] portion
[1:06:18] and when it looks like you're getting
[1:06:19] older every step you're really getting
[1:06:21] younger
[1:06:23] because there's another body waiting for
[1:06:24] you a spiritual
[1:06:26] body to hold the seed in your soul that
[1:06:29] you are temporarily carrying
[1:06:31] because these 16 elements one day
[1:06:33] there'll be no more
[1:06:35] but we are from another place another
[1:06:37] dimension
[1:06:38] a place where there's no sickness no
[1:06:41] sadness no depression
[1:06:42] no fear no confusion no mortgage
[1:06:46] no bills no ups and downs that's where
[1:06:49] we come from
[1:06:50] and david he's waiting for me joshua is
[1:06:53] waiting for me
[1:06:55] moses is waiting for me to find out how
[1:06:57] you made it over
[1:06:59] how did you survive 2018 how did you
[1:07:02] survive this internet age
[1:07:05] somebody preached back to me can we give
[1:07:07] the lord a shout out praise
[1:07:15] [Applause]
[1:07:19] and this is my inspiration here this
[1:07:21] morning from the message christ is
[1:07:22] revealed in his own word
[1:07:24] preaching jeffersonville
[1:07:27] august indiana 22nd 1965 knowing
[1:07:30] that what we say this morning we mustn't
[1:07:33] just say
[1:07:34] because we are gathered together to just
[1:07:36] haphazardly speak on anything
[1:07:39] but it is it's something that will help
[1:07:41] stabilize the people
[1:07:43] listen why we leave the stabilization
[1:07:46] for we are going to
[1:07:47] pass through dangerous treacherous
[1:07:50] waters
[1:07:52] we're already sailing through them and
[1:07:55] sometimes i guess it's with you
[1:07:58] like it is with me so the prophet is
[1:08:00] saying
[1:08:01] the what is he going through i don't
[1:08:03] know how it is for you but i can tell
[1:08:04] you what me
[1:08:06] is that it seems like so much of it it's
[1:08:07] such a scary
[1:08:11] so the prophet as a now this is 1965
[1:08:14] this is after the see this is after
[1:08:16] numerous visitations of angels
[1:08:19] and the prophet is saying we want to say
[1:08:22] something this morning because we're
[1:08:23] gonna pass through some dangerous waters
[1:08:26] we're gonna pass through moments in our
[1:08:27] lives that we can't explain that we
[1:08:29] don't understand
[1:08:30] say lord why me why i have to go through
[1:08:33] this
[1:08:35] i've served you all these years why my
[1:08:37] children are struggling serve you all
[1:08:39] and god is saying those treacherous
[1:08:40] waters just keep on walking
[1:08:45] just keep on walking just keep on
[1:08:47] praying
[1:08:48] just keep on pressing because for all of
[1:08:51] your family that's not here you are the
[1:08:53] wave sheep
[1:08:55] you are who's holding on for your
[1:08:57] brother holding on to your sister all
[1:08:59] and on for your family and god has not
[1:09:02] forgotten you
[1:09:03] those things that i revealed belonging
[1:09:05] to us
[1:09:07] and to our children can the church say
[1:09:10] amen
[1:09:12] so you are born to overcome you are born
[1:09:15] to be successful i'm not just talking
[1:09:16] about natural success you are born to be
[1:09:20] successful
[1:09:21] brother branham said it like this you
[1:09:22] are ghost advertisement board
[1:09:25] so when people want to see jesus god
[1:09:27] already sent
[1:09:28] sons and daughters who are going to
[1:09:30] advertise
[1:09:32] if you are an advertisement board for
[1:09:34] god then you ought to be the happiest
[1:09:36] people on the face of the earth
[1:09:39] because the purpose of an advertisement
[1:09:42] is to bring people to buy the product
[1:09:46] that you are advertising and this
[1:09:48] product that we have has no price
[1:09:50] but it's a good product people just
[1:09:53] don't know how good it is
[1:09:55] people just don't know how good jesus is
[1:09:58] people don't know
[1:09:59] that there's a solution when you're sick
[1:10:01] you don't need to go by the doctor
[1:10:03] and people need to know so this morning
[1:10:05] i'm just somebody
[1:10:07] i'm nobody trying to tell everybody
[1:10:10] about somebody
[1:10:11] who could save anybody i want to be a
[1:10:14] good advertisement
[1:10:16] for jesus i want to be a good
[1:10:18] representative of the kingdom
[1:10:20] and for me to be a good representative
[1:10:22] i've got to be on fire
[1:10:24] i've got to have joy i've got to have
[1:10:26] the holy ghost
[1:10:27] i've got to have seven living voices
[1:10:31] [Music]
[1:10:36] can the church say amen
[1:10:39] so you are born to overcome overcoming
[1:10:42] is built in
[1:10:43] the fact that you are here already
[1:10:45] speaks of the fact that you're an
[1:10:46] overcomer
[1:10:47] because you couldn't just come to this
[1:10:48] church this morning unless god called
[1:10:50] you
[1:10:51] you couldn't be here this morning unless
[1:10:53] god spoke to your heart
[1:10:54] there are many churches you could go to
[1:10:56] but not this one for you to come to this
[1:10:58] church this morning
[1:10:59] there has to be something in you that's
[1:11:01] connected
[1:11:02] to your eternal destination this is not
[1:11:05] a catholic church not a methodist church
[1:11:07] not a pentecostal church
[1:11:08] these are a body of believers with three
[1:11:12] kinds of believers
[1:11:13] but i'm not speaking to the make
[1:11:14] believer this morning or the unbeliever
[1:11:17] to spawn him
[1:11:18] because only the true believers can
[1:11:20] overcome
[1:11:21] but the branham said god can only prove
[1:11:24] his word
[1:11:25] by true believers so there's got to be
[1:11:28] some true believers who believe in their
[1:11:31] hearts
[1:11:31] that deliverance will not come from man
[1:11:34] it will come from god himself up he will
[1:11:36] raise the winds
[1:11:38] he will bring the storms up he will
[1:11:40] bring the earthquakes up
[1:11:41] but he will have every sun every
[1:11:44] daughter
[1:11:44] every predestinated seed i don't care
[1:11:47] where they're at this morning they have
[1:11:49] got to come
[1:11:56] oh give the lord a shout or praise
[1:11:58] somebody give him praise this morning
[1:12:01] you are going to be healed you are going
[1:12:03] to be delivered
[1:12:04] you are going to overcome you are going
[1:12:06] to get the holy ghost
[1:12:07] the pillar of fire is gonna visit your
[1:12:09] house
[1:12:10] the pillar of fire is gonna visit your
[1:12:12] job the pillar of fire is gonna visit
[1:12:15] your son
[1:12:16] the pillar of fire will visit your
[1:12:18] daughter
[1:12:20] it's got to happen how do you know god
[1:12:23] said it
[1:12:24] the prophet spoke it that settles it for
[1:12:26] me this morning
[1:12:28] and this morning the testimony of jesus
[1:12:30] is the spirit of prophecy
[1:12:33] we are saying what the tapes say
[1:12:38] [Applause]
[1:12:40] i'm not crazy i'm not crazy
[1:12:43] i've not lost it enough i want to lose
[1:12:44] it some more i want to lose myself
[1:12:48] in the love of god i want to lose myself
[1:12:51] in the goodness of jesus i want this
[1:12:54] thing to run over
[1:12:55] i want this cup to run over till
[1:12:57] everybody must know
[1:12:58] this person is different this young man
[1:13:01] is different
[1:13:02] this young woman is different
[1:13:07] can the church say amen you are going to
[1:13:10] overcome
[1:13:11] young brother young's sister i don't
[1:13:13] care what the world offers you
[1:13:18] it's built in in you to overcome the
[1:13:20] desires of this world
[1:13:23] you may be seated the fashions
[1:13:26] the lust of the eyes the lust of the
[1:13:29] flesh
[1:13:30] the pride of life it's built in you to
[1:13:33] overcome
[1:13:37] it's built-in don't tell me you can't do
[1:13:39] it don't tell me you can't dress like a
[1:13:42] christian
[1:13:42] don't tell me you cannot act like a
[1:13:44] christian don't tell me it is hard it's
[1:13:46] not hard for you because you are built
[1:13:48] to struggle
[1:13:51] it's hard for listen it's hard for a cat
[1:13:54] to fly
[1:13:59] ever punch it's hard for a car to fly
[1:14:03] it's not built to fly but do you know
[1:14:06] it's also hard for a plane to fly
[1:14:09] because when a plane takes off it must
[1:14:11] pass the sound barrier
[1:14:15] it must break out of gravity that's not
[1:14:17] easy
[1:14:18] it's hard the difference is the plane is
[1:14:20] built to fly
[1:14:24] let me say it another way if you look at
[1:14:27] a fish until you fish hey climb this
[1:14:29] tree
[1:14:30] the fish will always be a failure
[1:14:34] because the fish wasn't built to climb
[1:14:37] the tree
[1:14:38] but a young boy climb the tree it'll
[1:14:41] take a
[1:14:42] while for him to get comfortable without
[1:14:43] the climatry
[1:14:45] because if anything you don't know is
[1:14:47] difficult
[1:14:49] anything that's new it'll take some time
[1:14:51] some experience some experimentation
[1:14:54] some experiential learning for you to to
[1:14:56] be able to do it
[1:14:58] so the difficulty will always exist the
[1:15:01] difference is if you are built to do it
[1:15:04] and that's what we're seeing this
[1:15:05] morning you are built to overcome
[1:15:08] you are built to break past gravity
[1:15:11] you are built to break past like the
[1:15:13] lily who could press through the pond
[1:15:15] that lily is built for it so when it
[1:15:18] bounces it pushes through the mud it
[1:15:20] pushes through the mire it pushes
[1:15:22] through the filth and it breaks out
[1:15:25] and that's what we want to do this
[1:15:26] morning break out
[1:15:28] break free break past every limitation
[1:15:32] break past every obstacle now if you
[1:15:35] know
[1:15:36] your destination and you know what
[1:15:38] you're built
[1:15:39] to do and you what you are built for how
[1:15:42] could you get caught up in petty
[1:15:43] nonsense
[1:15:46] well i answer him back because he didn't
[1:15:48] tell me something and then i did really
[1:15:50] and then
[1:15:54] you look fat you know i say you didn't
[1:15:56] look fit
[1:15:57] but you are built for a higher purpose
[1:16:02] i said young people nobody nobody can
[1:16:05] make you do anything
[1:16:07] your actions are always your choice
[1:16:11] [Music]
[1:16:12] you ever seen people trying to fake
[1:16:14] fight or fight hold me back
[1:16:15] hold my back hold me back
[1:16:20] and half the time he's saying hold on
[1:16:21] the fright man hold me back just hold on
[1:16:31] why ate him he he he tell me he did
[1:16:39] you have to accept responsibility for
[1:16:41] every action
[1:16:42] every word
[1:16:45] you can't blame your wife you can't
[1:16:48] blame your husband
[1:16:49] you can't blame the boss you can't
[1:16:50] believe attack the driver
[1:16:52] you should vex your vex your vex you
[1:16:54] wish to church vex
[1:16:55] for this taxi driver this would have to
[1:16:58] do with your walk with god
[1:17:02] usually you vex somebody shake your hand

[1:17:47] inheritance you come for your portion

[1:17:53] you come because your body and pain and
[1:17:56] the best place to be when he in pain is
[1:17:57] in the house of god
[1:17:58] because healing is a children's bread we
[1:18:01] eat healing for breakfast
[1:18:03] that's what we do it's our bread it's
[1:18:05] our food he is our shoe bread he is our
[1:18:08] god
[1:18:09] and if nobody wants to worship that's
[1:18:11] them that has nothing to do with me
[1:18:14] i was born to worship and the our
[1:18:16] commitment
[1:18:17] now is that the true worshipers will
[1:18:19] worship the father
[1:18:21] in spirit and in truth
[1:18:25] born to overcome born to worship want to
[1:18:28] put the devil under your feet
[1:18:32] hallelujah
[1:18:34] [Applause]
[1:18:37] it doesn't matter the situation
[1:18:41] in your job in your school it doesn't
[1:18:43] matter everywhere you go you have a
[1:18:45] testimony
[1:18:47] i said it in digo martin a couple months
[1:18:50] ago i said listen
[1:18:52] find out from your neighbors where's
[1:18:54] your testimony
[1:19:00] and if you don't have a testimony to
[1:19:02] your neighbors
[1:19:04] if they revisit it that's the money
[1:19:10] find out your testimony from your
[1:19:11] co-workers because if your co-workers
[1:19:14] not sure
[1:19:15] you're christian something wrong with
[1:19:18] your testimony
[1:19:19] listen don't don't have anybody guess
[1:19:23] who you are your neighbors must say
[1:19:27] listen that house right there
[1:19:28] that house is a christian house i tell
[1:19:30] you that holds a christian
[1:19:37] let it not be the day have a service in
[1:19:39] by your house you might say wait i
[1:19:41] didn't know there was christina
[1:19:47] i didn't even know i know you know
[1:19:49] you're singing
[1:19:50] really really
[1:19:57] and that's why some of us have a
[1:19:58] challenge inviting people to children
[1:20:00] because when you invite people now
[1:20:02] people who around here can now hold you
[1:20:03] more accountable
[1:20:06] i was i was already doing a commission
[1:20:07] of inquiry into the inviting ratio
[1:20:10] and for the source of the problem
[1:20:12] because if you have a testimony becomes
[1:20:14] easy
[1:20:15] because people are asking why you're so
[1:20:17] happy
[1:20:19] why there's trouble in the economy but
[1:20:21] yet still you're happy
[1:20:22] you see what the lord is my provider
[1:20:27] how do i come in contact with that lord
[1:20:29] who provided for you because all of us
[1:20:30] are in trouble but if he if you have
[1:20:32] somebody who could bribe you i want to
[1:20:33] meet him too
[1:20:35] inviting people to the house of god
[1:20:37] should be the easiest thing to do
[1:20:39] because this is the best product you
[1:20:40] could ever touch this is the only
[1:20:43] product that have healing
[1:20:44] salvation redemption adoption
[1:20:47] deliverance
[1:20:48] and even stuff that hasn't been
[1:20:50] displayed yet missing limbs being
[1:20:52] restored
[1:20:53] is part of our package that we got in
[1:20:55] this age only
[1:20:58] how hard is it and when you could tell
[1:20:59] somebody and the best spot get free
[1:21:04] you have to pay for it just come and
[1:21:06] worship
[1:21:07] just come and enjoy just come and dance
[1:21:10] just come and sing just come and shout
[1:21:13] let's come and give
[1:21:14] god praise there's no cost there's no
[1:21:16] price
[1:21:17] he died for you
[1:21:19] [Applause]
[1:21:23] give the lord a shout of praise
[1:21:26] i haven't even gotten to the message i
[1:21:28] was still having a conversation
[1:21:33] one day military will just break from
[1:21:36] the church into the eternal realm
[1:21:38] you might forget you say you know as
[1:21:41] brother raymond said last week he said
[1:21:43] enoch was walking with god and then one
[1:21:44] day his foot just hit the king's highway
[1:21:47] oh my oh what a thought he just walking
[1:21:50] and then one of your foot hit the king's
[1:21:52] highway one of these morning between six
[1:21:54] and nine
[1:21:55] you'll be on your road to the maxi on
[1:21:57] the taxi and your foot will hit the
[1:22:00] king's
[1:22:00] highway and we'll be
[1:22:03] gone i'm looking for that day is there
[1:22:05] anybody else looking for that day
[1:22:08] then can you come and go with me to my
[1:22:10] father's house
[1:22:11] where there's joy unspeakable and
[1:22:14] full of glory
[1:22:17] [Applause]
[1:22:21] all right you may be now let's
[1:22:23] go back to genesis god
[1:22:26] in his mind because you see the
[1:22:28] challenge is this
[1:22:30] when people get things easily
[1:22:33] you lose it easy
[1:22:36] i say that again when
[1:22:40] you get stuff easy you lose it
[1:22:44] easily
[1:22:47] so there are many stories of businessmen
[1:22:51] who started with nothing and their
[1:22:54] sacrifice
[1:22:55] and when he heard a story they say they
[1:22:56] eat bake and butter for 10 years
[1:22:59] 15 years to work to build something up
[1:23:03] they sacrifice but their children didn't
[1:23:07] understand or went through the sacrifice
[1:23:09] that they went through
[1:23:11] so when the time company children to
[1:23:13] take over
[1:23:14] the business there are many businesses
[1:23:17] that took 14 years to build up
[1:23:18] and two years to go down because there
[1:23:22] was no sacrifice
[1:23:23] to build there was no pain in growth
[1:23:27] so jesus and god himself rather when
[1:23:30] adam was put in a garden of eden
[1:23:32] adam didn't earn anything
[1:23:36] he didn't earn character from experience
[1:23:38] from pain
[1:23:41] but on the other side he had jesus blood
[1:23:43] obedience by the things that he suffered
[1:23:47] but adam it was handed to him
[1:23:52] on a platter with a george essay and
[1:23:55] because of how it was gotten
[1:23:57] it could have been easily lost and god
[1:24:01] pledged it will not be like that ever
[1:24:03] again
[1:24:05] for power to reach to anybody they must
[1:24:08] have
[1:24:09] character and to get character character
[1:24:12] comes by
[1:24:13] trials by by giving you
[1:24:17] exams by putting you under pressure
[1:24:20] to see how you would handle certain
[1:24:22] situations
[1:24:23] because if you don't prove how you will
[1:24:26] handle it
[1:24:38] so the promises of an overcomer that was
[1:24:41] built into scripture
[1:24:43] adam could have never enjoyed because he
[1:24:46] had never overcome anything
[1:24:48] just like the angels never had anything
[1:24:51] to overcome
[1:24:52] adam had no trials no tests no problems
[1:24:55] no sufferings
[1:24:56] no financial problems no problems in his
[1:24:59] marriage no
[1:25:00] all the animals listen to him none of
[1:25:02] the animals batchat
[1:25:06] when the mountains were spoken to the
[1:25:08] mountains moved
[1:25:09] adam had nothing to overcome adam could
[1:25:12] have never been
[1:25:14] called an overcomer because there was
[1:25:16] nothing to overcome
[1:25:19] everybody with me adam had a book of
[1:25:22] names and adam's mission
[1:25:24] was just a call from this book of names
[1:25:27] in the time and
[1:25:28] season and they were going to be made
[1:25:30] manifest
[1:25:32] but adam fell in sin before he had the
[1:25:34] chance to call one name
[1:25:42] can the church say man
[1:25:45] but in that book in the book that adam
[1:25:48] had
[1:25:48] but the branham said there's a category
[1:25:51] of that book
[1:25:53] which he tied to scripture he says in
[1:25:56] revelation 3 5 he that overcometh
[1:25:58] the same shall be clothed in white
[1:25:59] raymond and i will not
[1:26:02] blot out his name out of the book of
[1:26:04] life
[1:26:05] but i will confess his name before my
[1:26:07] father and before his angels
[1:26:10] so there's a section of the book that
[1:26:11] has do not remove
[1:26:14] that their names could never be blocked
[1:26:16] out because they overcome
[1:26:18] you know what it is to know that you
[1:26:19] overcome and god say listen you overcome
[1:26:22] that name could never come out because
[1:26:24] that type of overcoming god
[1:26:25] honors that type of overcoming somebody
[1:26:28] preach back to me
[1:26:30] so one of the rewards of the overcomers
[1:26:34] is to hear that overcome it the shame
[1:26:36] shall be clothed in white raymond and i
[1:26:38] will not plug out his name
[1:26:40] so am i preaching the overcomers this
[1:26:42] morning
[1:26:42] [Applause]
[1:26:44] and for those of you who have been low
[1:26:46] on the
[1:26:47] overcoming scale
[1:26:50] you try to overcome sometimes you want
[1:26:52] to overcome some things and you want to
[1:26:54] overcome the things that you want to
[1:26:55] overcome but the thing that you don't
[1:26:56] want to overcome you don't want to
[1:26:57] overcome
[1:27:01] you say life is about choice
[1:27:04] so things you want to overcome you want
[1:27:06] to anything to do that that you enjoy
[1:27:07] you want blessing with a nice car loader
[1:27:09] you know overcome and if i get the car
[1:27:10] deal

[1:27:24] tangled and you overcome
[1:27:25] everything to do with what you like you

[1:27:30] thank god for the victory the bank gave
[1:27:32] you a hard time but he's able to script
[1:27:33] to get any money to millions of dollars
[1:27:35] for the kanye getty car you overcome
[1:27:36] this
[1:27:37] the bank manager was saying you overcome
[1:27:38] the bank manager and once
[1:27:40] it's what you want you happy to overcome
[1:27:42] and i say you overcoming i overcome into
[1:27:44] agerica
[1:27:47] but the overcoming i'm talking about is
[1:27:48] overcoming in every area of your life
[1:27:51] overcoming when you don't feel like
[1:27:52] praying but you still pray anyhow
[1:27:55] overcoming when you want to answer back
[1:27:57] but you're overcome and you stay
[1:27:59] silent that's the overcoming we don't
[1:28:02] really want to do you know because it
[1:28:04] goes against our very nature
[1:28:07] you overcome when you want to feel like
[1:28:08] staying homeish but you overcome that
[1:28:10] and you press your way to come to the
[1:28:11] house of god
[1:28:12] that's overcoming you overcome when you
[1:28:16] open
[1:28:16] your wardrobe and you look at your
[1:28:17] clothes and recognize wait now this
[1:28:19] girl's a little too

[1:28:42] of the end of my oh come on
[1:28:44] somebody preached back to me this
[1:28:46] morning
[1:28:48] can we talk about overcoming overcoming
[1:28:51] when
[1:28:51] the boys come to the young sisters and
[1:28:53] say you're pretty and you're beautiful
[1:28:54] oh nobody never told you how good you
[1:28:56] look and you overcome and you walk away
[1:28:57] because you know you are a princess you
[1:29:00] born of a king
[1:29:01] and god has a prince for you you
[1:29:03] overcome
[1:29:06] born to overcome every temptation
[1:29:10] every desire every opportunity that the
[1:29:12] devil presents your way
[1:29:14] you overcome it because you are born to
[1:29:16] overcome
[1:29:20] overcome the music but it was a nice
[1:29:22] song it
[1:29:23] it is a nice song it's slow it it's
[1:29:28] it'll put you in what mood
[1:29:38] but you overcome
[1:29:43] overcome the music that's supposed to be
[1:29:46] christian music too
[1:29:48] that makes you want to dance not like a
[1:29:50] christian
[1:29:51] but the devil using all it is too to
[1:29:53] pull you down and you overcome that and
[1:29:55] say
[1:29:55] that's not what motivates me
[1:29:57] [Music]
[1:30:00] your appetite is changing your desires
[1:30:04] changing
[1:30:06] you don't want to look sexy that's not
[1:30:07] your objective you reject that you
[1:30:09] overcome that
[1:30:11] you're bigger than that you're more
[1:30:12] precious than man
[1:30:14] you overcome
[1:30:15] [Applause]
[1:30:17] do he see me yet still i trust him i'm
[1:30:19] an overcomer
[1:30:21] but they laugh at me in school you are
[1:30:24] an overcomer
[1:30:25] let them laugh it does not matter born
[1:30:27] to overcome
[1:30:29] [Applause]
[1:30:33] i said it to him and many youtubers that
[1:30:35] say young sisters
[1:30:36] you don't need to put on makeup or semi
[1:30:39] makeup or have makeup or quarter makeup
[1:30:41] god made you beautiful as you are if
[1:30:44] those worldly ladies need makeup to look
[1:30:46] good that's them that's not you
[1:30:48] feel sorry for them
[1:30:55] you need a drink to be a man smoke to be
[1:30:57] a man run woman to be a man
[1:30:58] that you overcome all of that and that's
[1:31:01] the
[1:31:02] baby stop because the privacy present
[1:31:04] your bodies a living sacrifice
[1:31:06] that's your reasonable service
[1:31:09] reasonable
[1:31:10] [Music]
[1:31:11] [Applause]
[1:31:14] having a testimony too many of us are
[1:31:16] too carnal
[1:31:19] we in the flesh too much and it's
[1:31:22] impossible to be in the flesh if you're
[1:31:24] in the world and you're praying and
[1:31:25] you're tyrion and seeking the lord
[1:31:28] it's impossible for you to get off your
[1:31:30] knees and say but where you touch my
[1:31:32] thing for
[1:31:33] if you were praying and that's your
[1:31:35] quick response from praying
[1:31:37] i don't know what anointing
[1:31:42] you was just praying but when you're
[1:31:44] praying are you getting on something
[1:31:46] they say they say i don't know lord
[1:31:48] is this a test
[1:31:51] right after praying this has to be a
[1:31:53] test can you go back and pray
[1:31:56] and he let god work it out say lord i
[1:31:58] leave this one to you
[1:32:00] because if i handle it i will handle it
[1:32:02] wrong so i want to get back and
[1:32:04] it's a different consciousness it's
[1:32:06] conscious that everywhere you go god
[1:32:08] goes with you
[1:32:09] when you walk into your job he is
[1:32:11] looking there for you and if everywhere
[1:32:13] you walk you know he's there
[1:32:14] how would we speak how would we live how
[1:32:16] would we act how would we dress
[1:32:18] what would we say
[1:32:24] the rewards of the overcomers so i'm
[1:32:27] speaking to overcomers
[1:32:30] because in every area of your life you
[1:32:32] must overcome
[1:32:34] hallelujah in the message how can i
[1:32:37] overcome
[1:32:38] but the man said i think that the church
[1:32:40] maybe should be taking this a step
[1:32:42] higher at this time and that's what i'm
[1:32:44] pushing for to go a little higher
[1:32:46] at this time and but ibrahim said in the
[1:32:48] same message how can i overcome
[1:32:50] now we're speaking on this overcoming
[1:32:53] word overcome of course you know what it
[1:32:55] means you've got to have something to
[1:32:58] overcome
[1:32:59] there is a goliath in all of our lives
[1:33:08] god set up stuff in our lives for us to
[1:33:12] overcome
[1:33:14] it will not be the same for you it will
[1:33:15] not be the same for you but there'll be
[1:33:17] stuff in your life some of us is gossip
[1:33:23] for some of us as self we just have so
[1:33:26] much self god waiting to break that self
[1:33:28] to pieces
[1:33:29] for some of us we just holy we in our
[1:33:31] minds we holy
[1:33:32] and we judge everybody by your standard
[1:33:36] not the word now by your standard
[1:33:37] i don't do this and
[1:33:41] that's why the upper room brought it
[1:33:43] equal
[1:33:45] and when we come to church there's no
[1:33:46] big you belittle me listen i am
[1:33:49] way nowhere above nobody you know
[1:33:52] i am here this morning preaching to

[1:34:23] your desire
[1:34:24] may it be unto you according to your
[1:34:27] heart's desire
[1:34:30] i asked a question this morning if
[1:34:33] almighty god were to
[1:34:35] grant the desire of your heart right now
[1:34:38] what is that desire
[1:34:40] if right now we want to grant a heart

[1:35:11] here i lord send me lord i don't have
[1:35:14] much but i've given you all i have lord
[1:35:16] i'm in need this morning i've been
[1:35:18] coming a long time but i need something
[1:35:21] more
[1:35:21] this morning than yesterday
[1:35:23] [Music]
[1:35:25] i'm ready to overcome myself you know
[1:35:28] what the bible says
[1:35:28] when you lift your hand it's a sign of
[1:35:30] surrender
[1:35:32] when you surrender your efforts your
[1:35:34] activity lord i give up i've tried my
[1:35:37] own way
[1:35:37] but lord i surrender
[1:35:42] [Music]
[1:35:48] but abraham said you've got to have
[1:35:50] something to overcome
[1:35:52] and this church age that the holy spirit
[1:35:54] was speaking about here
[1:35:55] at the laodicean church age as we have
[1:35:58] been through it needed a rebuking
[1:36:01] laodicea had to be rebuked because it
[1:36:03] was different
[1:36:04] towards christ in other words the
[1:36:06] attitude towards christ was a little
[1:36:08] different
[1:36:10] it is not how it was supposed to be was
[1:36:11] not how it used to be
[1:36:13] but it was a little different and if you
[1:36:15] are here this morning and your attitude
[1:36:17] towards god
[1:36:18] is a little different then you need a
[1:36:22] rebuking
[1:36:25] it had put christ outside in their age
[1:36:29] and christ was on the outside trying to
[1:36:32] get
[1:36:33] back on the inside but the man said
[1:36:35] that's love
[1:36:36] and this morning he is he said if he
[1:36:40] said i stand at the door and knock
[1:36:42] and if any man here this morning open
[1:36:45] open his heart i will come in
[1:36:49] he's not trying to break down your heart
[1:36:51] he's had to break into your house into
[1:36:53] your family
[1:36:54] but he's there knocking on the door of
[1:36:57] your heart this morning
[1:37:00] so that you can overcome more than
[1:37:02] you've ever overcome before
[1:37:04] because greater is he that will be in
[1:37:06] you than he that's in the world
[1:37:08] is there anybody want to let him in this
[1:37:11] morning
[1:37:12] let him in every area of your heart
[1:37:15] he is still standing at the door this

[1:37:42] don't turn him away young sister don't
[1:37:44] turn him away young brother
[1:37:46] don't turn him away backslider don't

[1:38:05] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:38:09] i believe in my heart before this
[1:38:11] service is over
[1:38:12] healings will break forth i believe in
[1:38:14] my heart that before this service is
[1:38:16] over
[1:38:17] a backslider will be restored i believe
[1:38:20] in my heart
[1:38:20] before this service is over yes somebody
[1:38:23] could be filled with the baptism of the
[1:38:25] holy ghost on fire
[1:38:26] i ask is anything too hard for the lord
[1:38:28] this morning
[1:38:30] [Music]
[1:38:41] listen to the prophet he said that's
[1:38:44] love
[1:38:46] that's love people don't know what love
[1:38:47] is but he said that's love
[1:38:52] we were born for him to be there we are
[1:38:55] the ones who put him out
[1:38:56] but ibrahim said if you want to find god
[1:38:58] he said god is right wherever you left
[1:39:01] him because he will never leave you
[1:39:04] he said if you want to reconnect with
[1:39:06] god go
[1:39:07] back to where you walked away because
[1:39:10] it's not in god to walk away
[1:39:12] it's not his nature to walk away he's
[1:39:14] the one that goes
[1:39:15] after the one sheep he's the one that
[1:39:18] knocks on the door he's the one that
[1:39:20] oh come on somebody preach back to me
[1:39:22] it's not in his nature to abandon you he
[1:39:25] said i will never leave you
[1:39:26] i'll never forsake you so if you have
[1:39:28] lost your connection with god
[1:39:31] the prophet said walk back trace back
[1:39:33] your steps
[1:39:34] to where you left him because he will
[1:39:37] never leave you
[1:39:39] i don't feel the anointing anymore i
[1:39:42] don't feel i'm praying anymore
[1:39:43] i don't feel like don't blame god for
[1:39:47] that
[1:39:48] don't hold god accountable for that
[1:39:50] that's not on him that's on you
[1:39:53] reverse your steps walk back to the
[1:39:56] altar this morning
[1:39:57] and say lord i'm sorry for walking away
[1:39:59] i'm sorry for missing church
[1:40:01] i'm sorry for not praying and i'm coming
[1:40:04] back to the
[1:40:05] heart of worship i'm coming back
[1:40:08] i'm coming back to our heart of worship
[1:40:11] [Applause]
[1:40:13] we let our time get in the way we let
[1:40:16] our commitments get in the way and god
[1:40:18] is still there you still
[1:40:19] even when we walk away he is still
[1:40:21] knocking
[1:40:27] he is still knocking this morning he is
[1:40:30] still knocking this morning
[1:40:34] he is still knocking he's still knocking
[1:40:38] he's still knocking he's still knocking
[1:40:41] trying to get control
[1:40:47] control of your life
[1:40:50] because when he is in the control of
[1:40:52] your life
[1:40:53] the situations around you you can
[1:40:56] finally put it in your control
[1:40:59] when he is in control it gives you
[1:41:00] authority and power
[1:41:02] to be in control because he said i am
[1:41:05] the vine here the branches
[1:41:07] so when he is connected to you suddenly
[1:41:09] your world begins to
[1:41:11] change because you are connected to the
[1:41:13] source of power
[1:41:14] the source of authority the source of
[1:41:16] the spoken word
[1:41:20] is that what you came to church here
[1:41:21] this morning for or is it to go back
[1:41:24] home and live the same way you live last
[1:41:25] week

[1:41:28] same way
[1:41:30] no more walking around in circles doing
[1:41:33] the death walk as the prophet spoke
[1:41:35] about
[1:41:36] but this morning as for me and my house
[1:41:39] we will serve the lord i don't care if

[1:42:01] children after them that are far off
[1:42:03] there's nobody that gone too far that
[1:42:05] god cannot pull back
[1:42:06] our god is a god of the impossible he's
[1:42:10] a god of deliverance
[1:42:11] he's a god of miracles this morning

[1:42:29] [Applause]
[1:42:29] [Music]

[1:42:35] but the clarence we have the devil and
[1:42:36] the ropes and we're not gonna let up
[1:42:39] until he lets you go
[1:42:43] i'm sick and tired it has to come a
[1:42:45] point in your life
[1:42:46] that you are sick and tired of the way
[1:42:48] things are and the way things work
[1:42:50] and that drives you to change and it
[1:42:53] drives you
[1:42:54] to desperation
[1:42:57] stop accepting failure as your promise
[1:43:00] stop accepting defeat as your promise
[1:43:04] stop accepting it it's not yours your
[1:43:06] promises the holy ghost

[1:43:20] that's your promise
[1:43:24] hallelujah oh glory to god
[1:43:28] god bless you wherever you are this
[1:43:30] morning hallelujah
[1:43:32] our job is to make heaven high and to
[1:43:35] preach hell hot
[1:43:36] and to let you know that god has a day
[1:43:38] and a time
[1:43:39] and an appointment for you and if your
[1:43:41] name is on the book
[1:43:42] there is no devil there is no demon
[1:43:45] there is no past there is no situation
[1:43:47] that could stop you from coming to god
[1:43:50] he said my sheep
[1:43:51] they hear my voice my sheep they know my
[1:43:54] voice
[1:43:55] their sheep oh come on somebody preached
[1:43:57] back to me this morning
[1:44:08] hallelujah
[1:44:16] let us not be a tradition to you let us
[1:44:19] not be a routine
[1:44:20] for you let us not be something that you
[1:44:23] just do because
[1:44:24] you want to come to church and
[1:44:29] the road to hell is paved with good
[1:44:31] intentions
[1:44:33] people have good intentions plenty plans
[1:44:36] plenty things they want to do
[1:44:37] and good hearts good desires but god is
[1:44:39] not measuring heart and he's
[1:44:41] he's looking for that life if the desire
[1:44:44] the intention and the heart
[1:44:46] doesn't translate into a life it's not
[1:44:49] enough
[1:44:53] you have to overcome i want to continue
[1:44:57] but now notice his call here is not to
[1:45:00] just the church
[1:45:02] he that overcome it see not the church
[1:45:05] that would be she see the church body
[1:45:08] but it's he that overcome it
[1:45:10] and but the brand said overcome and
[1:45:12] keeps life in you
[1:45:16] so when you back up and backslide and
[1:45:18] say well because i'm under pressure
[1:45:20] that's why you're not seeing me
[1:45:21] and because under pressure i just going
[1:45:23] through something
[1:45:25] you're dying but overcoming keeps life
[1:45:28] in you
[1:45:31] overcoming keeps life in you overcoming
[1:45:34] keeps you alive
[1:45:36] the bible is a book of overcoming this
[1:45:38] message this morning is a message of
[1:45:40] overcoming
[1:45:42] when god in the beginning said let there
[1:45:44] be light
[1:45:45] that light had to overcome the darkness
[1:45:47] that was there
[1:45:49] the very first beginning of genesis and
[1:45:52] god said let there be light
[1:45:53] that's where overcoming started
[1:45:57] and the darkness had to back up because
[1:46:00] light and darkness cannot stay in the
[1:46:02] same house
[1:46:03] and if there's darkness in your house
[1:46:05] this morning we say let there be light
[1:46:08] in every house in every heart let there
[1:46:11] be
[1:46:12] light in every marriage let there be
[1:46:14] heart let there be light in every
[1:46:16] situation
[1:46:17] let there be light on your job let there
[1:46:19] be light in your school
[1:46:21] let there be light in your financial
[1:46:22] situation let there be light in your
[1:46:25] body and push
[1:46:26] back that darkness of sickness let there
[1:46:29] be light
[1:46:32] because light and tactics cannot stay in
[1:46:34] the same house
[1:46:35] if there's a darkness of doubt the
[1:46:37] tactics of unbelief the darkness
[1:46:39] of an identity crisis because you don't
[1:46:41] know who you are
[1:46:42] let there be light this morning
[1:46:44] [Applause]
[1:46:46] and see the darkness back up oh
[1:46:49] hallelujah
[1:46:50] hallelujah hallelujah and when
[1:46:54] light comes darkness cannot stand a
[1:46:56] chance
[1:46:58] never never never stand a chance
[1:47:03] this morning may the light of the
[1:47:05] revealed word
[1:47:06] as brought by our prophet william
[1:47:08] branham shine in your life
[1:47:11] and push back the darkness the darkness
[1:47:14] of confusion the
[1:47:16] darkness of questions the tactics of
[1:47:19] wandering let
[1:47:20] the light of god shine in your family
[1:47:22] and bring
[1:47:23] healing to your house bring healing to
[1:47:25] your neighborhood

[1:47:33] see you in power

[1:47:36] wants to see you as a son
[1:47:38] a daughter of the living god in dominion
[1:47:41] in control
[1:47:42] in power that's our reward of the
