is active among us we are grateful and we always be grateful such a privilege to have you in our midst and your promise to be walking in and out moving Among Us your people in this last day we are needy people your sons and daughters here we are very needy the parents here very needy the children here are needy come Among Us and bless us this morning in a special way in Jesus name I ask it amen have your seat [Music] hallelujah [Music] hallelujah Glory [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you know it is a powerful thing when you know that you are in his presence and we could think back in the Old Testament to think that the cloud went by them with them by day and the pillar Fire by night and sometime ago was saying could you imagine somebody going into bar we're going to a party when you look up you see the spill of fire you change your mind right away that was the presence of God and this presence is what he promised to be with us wherever you go am in that presence you can't be cursing swearing uh being filthy mouth or whatever no because you under that presence and your conscious of it you're conscious that this battle is not flesh and blood we have several attacks in all different sicknesses and all kind of attacks in the church but you know what I realized God answer every prayer everyone came out Victorious so we know we are serving a prayer answering God uh tonight so I want to read a scripture you can have your seat I'm not the speaker this morning but Isaac will be speaking to you this morning but just before he come I just fell let to share something before he come before he comes and the men this is from Genesis 18 verse 16 and the men rose up then and look toward Sodom this is after the angel came to speak to Abraham and Sarah about having that son Isaac and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way and the Lord said unto Abraham shall I hi from Abraham the thing which I do now judgment was coming so he's going to reveal what he's about to do seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation and all the nations of the Earth shall be blessed in him list is for what God knows for I know him I know him that he will command his children and his household after him and they shall keep the way of the Lord to do justice and judgment that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he had spoken of him so it wasn't like God gave him a promise and everything working in an automatic Channel I know him am I know him and I know what he will do does God know what you will do you can't be sitting and staring and just expecting to work out you have to be in a channel that you could get the revelation of what God wants you to do and the Lord said because of the Cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great because their sin is very Grievious I will go down and see whether they have done all together according to the Cry of it which is come unto me and and if not I will know now Paul when he wrote the scripture in Ephesians 6 to and obey your parents Paul was connected to a word that was given Exodus 20:12 and that scripture in Exodus 20 says honor thy father and thy mother that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee it didn't say your father and mother have to be a Christian it didn't say that it didn't say a mother father have to be Believers it did not say that it say honor which is to give respect unto and the the level of that is that your days may be long in the land which the Lord thy God give thee now Ephesians 6 that reference point we was talking about here where Paul draw from Exodus 2012 he said children obey your parents in the Lord for this is right honor thy father and thy mother which is the first commandment with promise amen that it may be well with thee and thou may live long on the earth and he fathers provoke not your children to rat but bring them up in the nurture and the admonish of the Lord so you see parenting is a great thing whether you have children or not you raise anybody it come like you a parent because you're molding and shaping a life a child a son a daughter you may be molding and shaping a future preacher Pastor Prophet King prime minister you don't know who but son to God okay now the Amplified in this Ephesians 6 says children obey your parents in the Lord as his representatives for this is just and right honor esteem and value as precious your father and your mother this is the first commandment with a promise that all may be well with you and that you may live long on the earth fathers do not irritate and provoke your children to anger they want baby you rock them you put bottle and you know and shake them and so on afterwards them little toddlers start to walk and talk and start to tell you back things and afterwards they start to get your height and they recognize wait a minute you no longer have a child you have a young woman or a young man the Bible says and and and our objective as parents is to bring them to maturity that they could leave and cleave that we overshadow them and we keep well I don't want to use that word um in the business then you know what talking about so so the object is to bring these little guys these little men and women because them big men and woman in small form flip the script and see it different child baby yeah is that right that is a big man and a big woman in baby form just put time on them see Gan preach God has dropped time drop 20 years and a 6month old baby and you get 20 years and six months that no child for this cause shall a man leave his mother and father and cleave to his wife if he's not a man he should stay home that's rough this morning all right okay so this I want to get to but Isaac get ready he's ready fathers do not irritate and provoke your children to anger do not exasperate them to resentment but read them tenderly in the training and discipline and the counsel and admonish of the Lord don't beat them into torment and beat licks you know me but there is no admonishing there's no counsel there's no teaching because lots of time they don't even know and that's why sometime I ask children to forgive their parents because their parents are doing the best that they can and they did it with the knowledge that they had at that time we in an advanced age and you get the opportunity to learn more but this is the point I want to get to something I said in the prayer meeting it is easier to raise a son right than to break fix a broken man am all the pains and struggle in raising these little sometime we call them Rascals but raising these little guys that may be sometimes really challenging sometimes it is worth it for the for it for us to get it right while they are young than to fix broken men the world today is littered with broken men we had enough of that Abraham God said I know him and he will teach his children God help us this morning that we could effectively keep our children our grandchildren that they would grow up to be broken men because broken men will have broken homes broken hes broken family and the devil will have his way but God promised to restore the balance God promised to restore right thinking right approach praise God that you could love fatherhood love parenting a privilege for God to bless you to be a parent and you have to know what you're raising there are some people they love when they reach 18 to say they not responsible no more they're 18 years old no no no no no what if God did us that we are still learning we are still growing praise God you s you saw you had a song uh worthy of worthy of it [Music] [Laughter] all sing it let's all stand you are worthy of it all raise your [Music] hands you are worthy of it all for from you are all things for from you are all things and to you are all things you deserve the glory you're worthy sing you're worthy of you're worthy of it [Music] all for from you are all things to you are all things you deserve the glory one more time sing you're worthy of it all you're worthy of worthy of it all [Music] oh oh for from you are all things to you are all things you deserve the glory [Music] oh

and an atmosphere greetings and what can we say about brother ID's comments amen how blessed are we amen so while you're standing if you would turn with me to three portions of scripture uh we're going to read from the books of Proverbs and the Book of Psalms reading firstly from Proverbs 12 I'm going to read one verse there verse 15 Proverbs 12 verse 15 the way of a fool is right in his own eyes but he that hearkeneth unto counsel is wise and reading for Proverbs 19 and reading verse 20 hear counsel and receive instruction that thou mayest be wise in thy latter end there are many devices in a man's heart nevertheless the counsel of the Lord that shall stand amen and reading Psalm 1 very familiar scripture Psalm 1 verse 1 blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of Sinners nor sth in the seat of the scornful Brothers I know I just give you that one verse but I'm going to continue but his light is in the law of the Lord and in his law that he meditate day and night and he shall be like a tree planteth by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season his Leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper the ungodly are not so but are like the chaff which the Wind Drive it away therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the Judgment nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous for the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous but the way of the ungodly Shall Perish may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word can we bow our heads for word of prayer our gracious Heavenly Father we thank you this morning to be in your house Lord to be able to thank you and to acknowledge your sovereignty your power Your Grace your mercy your loving kindness and the fact that you woke us up this morning Lord you put Lord breath on our lips father life and strength in us that we could come and gather in your house father to hear Lord not from man but hear a word from you just one word from you is more than enough to deal with situations confusion conflict and issues and father if there ever was an hour where we need a word from you it's now father there are so many voices the prophet said so many people speaking so many influences on the earth Lord and Lord trying to mask that still still Small Voice May the still Small Voice speak this morning may you use me as your microphone Lord may you cut off my thoughts my ideas my Lord feelings and whatever it is and Lord may only you be heard this morning may you get Glory may you get honor may you break chains and shackles may you bring Deliverance to your people this morning Father may you set Souls on fire May you revive renew may you strengthen may you edify may you encourage may you build up may you rest to may you lift your people up where they belong father Lord both those are here that are in the sanctuary and those that are connected on the internet and those that may hear the tape father Lord this is for your honor and For Your Glory we come this morning with a burden for the young people we come this morning with a burden for the children and how the enemy throughout scripture has always attacked the young people Lord when Lord Jesus was to be born there was an edict to to kill and to slay when Moses was to be born there was an edict to kill and to slay and the enemy knows that he could affect them when they're young he has a chance but father we come to Rally as a church as a people Lord a in agreement this morning that we are drawing a Line in the Sand and we are declaring this morning that the devil could have many but he can't have all and there will be some young people some children that we will anoint and we will pray for and father God we will apply the token upon them and upon our homes and upon our houses and Upon Our Lives so that when the death Angel comes he can pass by because they are covered by the blood father may you cover Us by the blood this morning if there's anyone in the house this morning that doesn't know you may they come to Know You by Revel by Revelation and by experience if there's someone that's not been baptized in water may they get a burden on their heart to be baptized if there's a backslide in our midst father Lord not just among the children but if there's a backslide of if there's someone that's wward if there's someone has lost their way if there's someone who has been struggling somebody that has just tied a nut and just hanging on Father May today be a day of Liberation May today be a day of breakthrough May today be a day of release we come against every unclean Spirit we come against every filthy Spirit we come against every attack of the enemy we come against the attack of the past and Lord the human senses and Imagination and reasoning we cast down imagination we come against the host of hell we come against the house of hell we come against every sickness every disease we come against every generational curse we come against everything that has been spoken we re reel Every curse and we pronounce blessing this morning we pronounce blessing this morning Hallelujah father may you walk out the pages of the Bible may you bring Liberty and encouragement to your people may you lift us up where we belong we are born to S We Are Born to Fly we are born to overcome we are born to make nak I shall not die but live to declare the works of the Lord father we are born with a purpose paid for by a price we are accounted for father we you get glory and honor to your name father in The Mighty precious name of Jesus and the church says and the church says amen you may be seated in the presence of the Lord certainly a great privilege to be in the house of the Lord this morning Hallelujah we don't know what's going to happen today but we know something is different but the random taught us that you got to do something for something to happen so by faith we are here this morning looking for something to happen we call for a special service to see chains broken and to see the young people delivered and to see them anointed because we fighting a real devil we're fighting a real enemy but we have a real God and we have real angels and they are more for us than against us hallelujah and there's no weapon that's formed against you that's going to prosper no weapon formed against your home is going to prosper no weapon forms against your body is going to prosper no weapon formed against your mind is going to prosper no weapon formed against your children is going to prosper no weapon formed against you is going to prosper Deliverance belongs to you peace of mind belongs to you a good night's rest Belong To You depression is not yours frustration is not yours Hallelujah being down and defeated that's not your promise that's not your inheritance so if you came in here with depression we we cast it out this morning there's power in the Church of the Living God to cast out depression depression has to listen to us because we know under whose authority we speak power belongs to God but Authority belongs to us we stand this morning representing the enforcer and the enforcer is here to enforce claims [Applause] Hallelujah there's power in the blood there's power in the cross there's power in the name of Jesus there's power in this message there's power in the word uh there's power in this church there's power upon this Pulpit there's a power over you there's a power inside of you what does the word say greater is he that's in you that he that's in the world that has nothing to do with how you feel has nothing to do with what you feel I'm not talking about your feeling this morning I'm not talking to your flesh this morning greater is he that's in you right now not tomorrow not next month not next week right now greater is that seed in you that's why the prophet said you are not even the believer the the word in you that's the believer and in that word is the power to deliver in that word is the power to transform in that word is the power to change your work to changes oh come on now somebody help me preach this [Applause] morning there's no better place that to shout that inside of here shouting shows you're alive shouting shows there's something inside of you shouting lets the devil knows whose side you're on you're not shouting for me and not trying to work you up but this is the atmosphere for you to be free free from condemnation free from sin free from your past free from oppression I don't care how old you are whether you're 5 years old or 100 years old there's a reason to give God thanks this morning the joy of the Lord is my strength every trial every test God wrote your name on it it's not by accident God is creating something out of your trials he is creating something out of the pressure listen it doesn't feel good to be under the pressure it doesn't feel good but it's going to be okay hallelujah it's going to be okay you may be seated so put a smile on your face turn to the person next to you and smile at them Hallelujah not no halfway smile turn to somebody else with a smile put a smile on your face you know it takes much less muscles to smile and to frown you know when you smile you have to change your molecular your chemical balance and and when you smile in the midst of your trial you is like a slap to the devil because the devil want to keep your there under pressure and you comeing a grinding through a grinding through yes a grinding through but with a smile on my [Applause] face Bible say G your loins like a man in other words straighten yourself up organize yourself stand up better than that I call it for a purpose I know things rough but G your loins like a man Shake Yourself stand up straight lift your head up I know you have bills to pay but he is Jehovah Gyra G your Lo like a man I know there's trouble in the home but let's invite Jesus into your home to deal with the trouble in your home anybody with me this morning oh I'm trying to take it easy just before I came up but always say take it easy hallelujah hallelujah I can't wait to give up this P house you know this this body has limitations but immortality is locked up inside of us a body change is locked up inside of us and that's what the devil is trying to stop you from from becoming who you are you may be seated so by the grace of God this morning I'm I'm not trying to preach to you in that sense this morning really want to have a conversation with you so for a title this morning it's Godly advice for the young people that's my title this morning Godly advice for the young people amen one time brov was preaching and he said we'll sa from the pulpit things your father never told you things your mother never told you because the word is very clear about certain things and within the context of where we stand with the gravity of understanding of the fullness of this message there are things that are very clear that is brought in scripture and Beyond what is brought in scripture God through his grace and love sent a prophet to provide Clarity to tie up all the Loose Ends that was not covered by scripture and then there are elements if you look back to question and answers when people went to the prophet with questions he said come talk to me afterwards about that because he didn't want to make certain things Doctrine and he wanted to deal with situations as they come but there are things that are very clear to us with how we should live and how we should behave and there are people that many times say well are trying to have the Victory and I can't find the victory but the reality is there's a relationship that God expects for us for us to have Victory he told Joshua meditate on the word day and night and you'll have good success Joshua's success was connected directly to his meditation on the word day and night so we can't expect to serve God in a halfway kind of way and expect God to work for us in a full-time kind of way because God is not a a chain your wear and your neck and something you hang up in your house and you have a picture in your house and you look at it before you walk out and you expect things to work out when you want to live any old kind of life so I'm here this morning to encourage us and to give you some Godly advice for the young people amen we read some scriptures blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel this word counsel is advice amen there are people who give us good advice and the people who give us bad advice you have to know difference but blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly this is not just a young people thing you know because many of us take counsel from the wrong places we have wives who take counsel from other women who cannot help them we have husbands who take counsel from people who are ungodly and it wrecks marriages parents take counsel from people who are not qualified to give counsel and their children have borne the fruit and we have young people who take bad advice people make decisions without good advice there's good advice and there's bad advice the Bible said there's safety in councel there's protection in councel there's a reason there are counselors the Bible said in the multitude of counselors there is safety where are you getting your advice from and if there is advice in the word for us to live and how to live then how do we connect into that so we can have success and peace of mind and and victory and overcome because God wants us to be successful in life and in godliness everybody with me I'm not preaching this morning having a conversation this morning with a burden as we go into school that we ref nect the kingdom of God you're not going to school for your parents in the same way you don't work just because you have a job the Bible says when you go to work work for the Lord anybody with me so I've said it many times no Christian has a right to say well I go to the man walk and I do the man walk that's not scriptural leave that for ungodly who don't have access to the word I don't care how rough your job is pray for God to give you better job but while you're in the job you're working onto the so there is an expectation of a spirit of Excellence because God is demanding Excellence from us as his ambassadors on the earth we are representing a kingdom that's in the natural and in the spiritual and by the same token the expectation of God is when you go to school you do well in school this is a different kind of service H because God doesn't accept mediocrity God is not settled with average I know everybody that an engineer and a doctor and a whatever but if you're a carpenter and you studying wwor you better be the best word worker that ever passed through that program I don't care what the course is whatever you do you're doing it unto the Lord you're doing it to reflect your kingdom your parents can get some secondary credit but the first credit is to the Lord you may be seated that's why brother brandom said if you want to be a bum be the best bum let people know the best bum walking on Frederick Street when they see see that man's a bum with distinction he said go to the dirtiest garbage can don't just take any kind of garbage can find the dirtiest one say no no no leave that one what I coming for because I want the best best God wants you to be the best at what you do there's no exception to that that's the mindset anyone who has achieved anything in this world believe they could achieve greatness how much more us who have accessed to the word where God said it was good it was good it was good it was good he did a perfect job on the first day it was good there was nothing else to fix there was nothing to improve on there was nothing he could have done better he was satisfied that when he finished on the first day it was good and you should be satisfied when it finish first year second year oh somebody preach back to me standard one standard five you may be seated but say haven't done all to stand stand in other words having done everything you could do do it to the best of your ability maybe some of you here this in your home I don't know but I'm letting you know the expectation of the word for both life and godliness because we are challenged to walk and be perfect be therefore perfect as your father in Heaven is perfect how your father tolerated it or your grandfather tolerated it it's not God's expectation we have a lot of work to do to be the best that we could be people must wonder what's your motivation and you must tell them I'm representing a kingdom let them wonder why your work ethic is that way let them Wonder why you approach school that way let them wonder why you approach life that way this is all part of the word [Applause] know when Elijah tell jasi go and look for to see what s see he come say I see anything he said go and write the exam again until I see something after seven time he come see a small sign I small like a man's hand and I know it's going to rain because Elijah had the next expectation of what was next so as you approach school as you approach University Secondary School your job whatever it might look like there is an expectation of Excellence that God [Applause] expects you are fearfully and wonderfully made he take time to work on you he take time to refine you your personality is unique there's nobody like you there was never there was never anybody like you before there will never be anybody after this like you nobody can ever replace you God put you here with a purpose that nobody else could do anybody with me this morning I told a different kind of service this morning so stop trying to be a photocopy of somebody else you are an original there is nobody like you nobody can ever be you but BR preach the message Oddball you're an oddball you're not meant to fit in into places oh come on somebody preach back to me you will never fit in in your school in your job you're different you're shape different you hide different you talk different you look different anybody with me this morning I'm not preaching on deep mystry I preaching the mystery of who you are that God took time to put you here in this age the worst age the hardest age the age where the most filt the age where the L of hell is uncovered and demon powers moving everybody God put before couldn't handle listen young people brother Ram stood on this Earth and say shoot the TV somebody asked me the other day if I ever see the hook Cooking Channel something TV cooking ask about but now it worse everybody walk with a TV in the pocket start to shoot the phones but it shows that the enemy is not static the devil is staying in 1950 1960 1980 he's moving finding interesting and creative ways that's why the Bible say knowledge will increase this whole AI thing has is a multi-dimensional thing people have information so much information they feel they're Invincible they feel they can figure life out they don't want no advice they don't want to hear what their parents say because their parents don't already know what they're going [Applause] through H you know how many people live with the regret of not taking good advice and when you sit on on them and you and that's why they said it's better to go to the house of mourning than in the house of laughter people pay money to go into comedy houses you know because they want to laugh and they forget what going on in real life and say laugh they laugh they forget the bills they forget the mortgage they forget the bank call they laugh laughing is not a bad thing is a sort of therapy that's great but you have the life to contend with the reality after you smoke you drink you do all you do you still have life and you to deal with apart from life is you you and life I said to somebody the other day life just life in right now it's like trial and then if you couldn't taught a next trial could fit in God just slip in the next [Applause] one somebody told me when they get some news said I done I can't take how much more you can take life is tough stress the more issues I saw somebody do a short video the other day they have reached too high in the corporate ladder because they sit on the desk on this ping ping ping ping ping ping message message message message they can't catch yourself they say they need to go back down one step because they didn't expect so much to happen at that high be ladder and God wants to Elevate you to a position of power and authority it means what you might consider to be tough right now when David's dealing with the line and a beer when he have to me go Li he recognize what you already been prepared for so I want to encourage you church that you need to change your mindset the Bible said be transformed by the renewing of your mind some of us our computers have viruses on it malware outdated operating system and our thinking is from 10 years ago 20 years ago the world is moving so fast you can't even think how it was two years ago anymore God hasn't changed but the world where we living in is changed you have to be aware of what's going on in your home what our children watch on YouTube what they watch on the internet what they interact with is the devil at work coordinating the movies and the messaging and the narrative the whole lgbtq agenda and all these things being subtly moved into media moved into school books moved into the teaching room moved into you can't sit down and say Well it going work out how how it going to work out are you praying more are you having the right conversation are you asking any question are you seeking advice I just here to talk to you a little bit anybody with me this morning [Applause] 2 Timothy 2:22 I have a number of different things here and we see how the Lord will lead the Bible said flee also youthful lust now this is not just directed at young people youthful lust anybody get caught up in youthful lust know they have parents here who ignoring the responsibility but they caught up in youthful lust amen but follow righteousness Faith charity peace with them that call on the Lord out of a Pure Heart church young people we must hate the things that God hates we cannot mix up this tolerance move with you tolerating foolishness it's either God is God or he's not God it's either something is right or something is wrong and no matter how old somebody is because my daughter is 5 years old and she know what is right and wrong she know when we say don't do something when she do it and she she hiding to do it the reason you hid in oh who teach her to hide there was no hiding class she signed up for she hide because she know she got an instruction don't do that who taught Adam to hide Adam Adam where I feel hiding there was no hiding course there was no hiding graduation he just hid because he knew it was wrong so why we have to repeat the same thing over and over dress properly stay away from Shady places stay away from foolishness don't get yourself into a situation where you have to be be trying to to to no no no why you putting yourself there brothers sisters let's be careful with these things listen to The Prophet Samson got into Bad Company half of the issues with young people is who you spend time with Samson got into Bad Company and you can always remember that when you are in Bad Company you are out of the will of God years ago I said to the young people there's a difference between your friends and Associates there are people you associated with in school on the job on the neighborhood in the grocery that's associate that can be your friend because Jus say except your forsake mother father brother even family for this cause so as you approach this New Year check your company but Bram goes on my old southern mommy used to tell me if you lay down with a dog that's got fleas you'll get up with the fleas that's rather a rude expression but it's got a lot of common everyday sense to it you just can't associate yourself with the things of the world and expect to stay spiritual and humble before the Lord You're known by your company there's an old saying show me your company and I'll tell you who you are so some of us we need to learn to walk alone and we really have no excuse and I've said this before for everybody who have an excuse with this or that there's somebody who will the same story overcome I preached before there was a young man I forget what country it was had no electricity and he made the front page of a World magazine because he's sitting on on the street under the street light to study and he pass all his exams money flooded from all around the world because he showed what was in him was more than a situation he had to deal with so for those who say I have no electricity look the example of somebody with no elri and how they overcame there is no excuse I don't know if I'm going to get into all of it but you know the Bible is a book about young people joash was the youngest king ag7 he went to the throne seven and know Josiah was 8 years old know David was between 15 to 17 around there when he F fight gol you know Daniel was a teenager you know this world is driven by young people Mary was in her late teens you know you have to make a choice of what you want to stand for or just get rolled around by the Water of Life and listen Daniel's parents would have been killed you know so Daniel had no parents to lean on my parents had do for me Daniel made a choice and not eat the king's meet it was his decision because enough was locked up in him to know how he wanted to live amen what's what's our excuse Esther in the Bible she had no parent but she had her family her uncle who gave her advice who is giving you advice whether it's your parents a family member somebody in church you have to connect to the right person to help you make the right decision but the B piece of message come follow me I'm just talking to you I'm going to get into a few things we have some time today right and then we're going to pray for the young people and he teaches before they go to school but the Brandon PRI M say come follow me and in this he said I think the word come follow me that would be the best advice I could give if I was talking to 10,000 kids or if I was just talking to just what I am it's a command and the greatest thing that I think was ever offered anybody and especially a young person follow me you're going to follow somebody you can remember that you're going to follow somebody and the way you follow the person be sure who this person is following listen to the prophet in the same message you make yourself when you're young that is why parents we have to fight to get our young children young people into the atmosphere it could be it a no compromis position because you make yourself when you're young you set your Ambitions to what you want to do and what you're trying to achieve in life that's why the Bible say train up a child in a way he should go so when he gets older he will not depart from it there's a lot of responsibility being placed here this morning we preach a mage days go have we done enough this autopilot mindset well is he Sunday school is he school teacher is he principal is the education system is the government is the pastor is everybody and everybody this who I want to preach and blame responsibility because the moment thing fell sou in the garden of Edom Adam say it wasn't me it was the woman and it wasn't me it was the serpant and then he had nobody else to blame blame versus responsibility and I can look at it on every side because for the parents who could do more shame on you but for the children who sit downst when my parent didn't do enough shame on you too because you are you have access to enough like Daniel to make the right decisions amen and if you don't know you can ask the question to the right person am I making sense this morning so there's a mission and mandate he have no excuses you know when people have seen come and go people who I could achieve this and then they just fall flat on their face and they realize money it is not happiness getting a wife is that happiness getting a girlfriend is that happiness getting a job when when I get a job I going be happy and no happiness there over the last few weeks I've had the opportunity to go in the hospital almost 10 days and I was sharing brother over it it was one of the most traumatic experiences just to walk and to see people in pain it's a long time I have not to walk to the hospital day after day and see people literally screaming balling looking for Relief stressed out and I see members in ter where people lives interrupted people would have had plans and the plans interrupted because this happened that happened and it brings a level of sensitivity of the grace of God to us and your life that you here be here in the house of the Lord this morning because there are people in a hospital who wish it could be somewhere else and we might say to ourselves well I wish I could have be here and my friends going this and my friends doing this and you don't understand what their end is what their road is what their destination is but say love to get us desperate conditions will I don't want to have to read conditions I don't want you you have to break your foot for you to repent and Things Fall Apart and you say well Lord are ready now because you can't ready go any party anymore so you're ready ready some of us God we so stubborn God had to break us shut us down to hear the still Small Voice why let it reach a point of crisis you see people sit on in church and they hear the word and they hear the word and they're shouting and you see them on the street and it's like how you dress so you was in church on Sunday that's why say you can preach the blue in the face but something has to be revealed to you how much time and the old people I don't know if I don't is this happening anybody the old say who don't hear does how to feel what wrong with this generation when you look at the news and the media the exam results from C or whatever they just had was one of the worst in years what is happening it have ai it have chat GPT it have thing and people so on social media and entertainment they can't even pass basic exams but over preached it a couple weeks ago if you don't know something it's your fault to know because YouTube teach you to make everything you want to make fried rice it day and if you can't read the recipe thing it have courses on how to read so you can read that first do that first and then read the recipe most people and it's embarrassing for us as Believers how much time we spend on Facebook and talking things that make no sense we know all kind of thing about everything else but what's important when you study successful people before get into the spiritual realm of it successful people do they they have no time for social media I have sat in rooms with people who teach in business and they say make sure you don't have Facebook and these things because it's not helping you achieve what you're going if the activities you do daily not drive your success what why why you doing it because people liveing know 24 hours in a day and if you check your phone 3 hours on Facebook 2 hours on Instagram 4 hours on WhatsApp what whatever that looks like you have all kind of thing you're doing I don't like to read it have AUD your books what is the excuse I hope this help us to recalibrate things and have some open and honest conversation in our homes because the children we have now don't even know about the prophet the way they did 10 15 20 years ago who's responsible for that what is happening in your homes that that children don't know the prophet voice can I drive to your house this morning what is your daily discipline weekly discipline monthly discipline to achieve success in every aspect of your life you know all the politics you tracking the US election better than the Americans I could see that here in tran you know the whole lineup for the Democrats the whole lineup for the Republicans you know the 9 things Trump did right the 29 things he did wrong but you don't know what's happening in your own home am young people know about the influencers the entertainers the singers the sports personalities the Olympics you miss a match you miss a game this your thing I telling you do how you Prophet us to go and Hunt I'm not a hunter you're not going to catch me doing that but make sure in all that you're doing you putting God first and this is not an exam that you have to pass for the pastor or the assistant pastor this is you making sure you put God first how much time if you were to analyze most phones now tell you how you spend your time when the day comes if you were tracking your prayer life is it 5 minutes a day 10 minutes a day 20 minutes a day you know John Wesley mom it was us to pre pray 4 hours a day not a half an hour you know not at 5 minutes you know and I can tell if you have a prayer life give it the M pray say Lord bless the the church Bless the people you know the story about Bram give of the when they had no water it was and he said the old lady get on and pray you say when she start to pray so you know she was a pray warrior they go get bucket one time because when that lady pray you know what going come because she have a relationship with God some of us have distant relationship go God hear a voice so rarely he's like wait now who is is that is that who I'm going to listen again because so long I him go no but isn't just think of it natural so somebody call you I yeah catch your voice of course you catch your voice you talk to me in 5 years how I catch your voice just think of it in the natural but if every day you're calling me then the moment I hear here and I know it's you look at the woman and that's why I say some of us our pain is not great enough I'll say that one more time our pain is not great enough because pain drives us to desperation it's a lot so that wiow woman with the unjust judge the judge wasn't taken on until it was got become overbearing he said if I don't stop this woman and deal with her case here I wouldn't sleep this night the night to come the night let go deal with her because of her incess unstopping wearing unless he wearing me out he thought she was going to go one time you know but say but wait now it's 9:00 it's 10:00 11:00 12:00 she's still knocking 1:00 2:00 have to go down [Applause] yes all night prayer meetings forget about it young people even know to spell the all night pray meeting but put them on a movie marathon they're watching our series The Devil so good it's not just movies it's series so it's episode after episode and they Master the science of cliffhanger so you you have to see the next one mess up your whole day you can't wait for next episode I share this I share this a few times growing up there was no TV in the house um there was a old TV at one point and when whenever Dad went out we used to find a string I don't know if Gideon remember this and run a wire and try to Andrew remember this trying to gety channel we W not too successful at times but but I remember being in secondary school I just sharing we having a conversation and they're watching these series well you know your brother a little sharp now so he's listening you listening listening brother l i watch no party series but I listen until I know the characters and everything and I said to join the conversation because you want to beong now so what happened to James Boy Yes you happened to James well James do so and so yeah boy if James and Betty they don't need do I see the episode yes know but I so want to be long in the conversation in school I want to feel left out now and the reality as humans we want to feel a sense of belonging so young people don't feel we understand and the whole need to everybody going here why I can go everybody doing this why I can do and recognize the devil have all these tricks to catch your attention and what we knew at 12 they know now at 7: so you can't play naive and we have to confront the issues and the reality of it because our young people are under attack am the devil are trying to get them blessed he trying to take their Souls so you have to realize the enemy coming for your house the enemy coming for your marriage the enemy coming for your family the enemy trying to steal to Rob to kill to destroy that's his mission anybody with me this morning so if you accept the reality that your home is under attack your Christianity is under attack your marriage is under attack yours walk with the Lord is under attack then why you walking like if nothing going on and how could you even leave your home without trying to pray and seek the Lord and why would you open the door I sh sh there many many times the enemy can only come in when we open doors for him you know because the enemy has no Authority just walk into your house to even get to job God had to say go and I will remove the Hedge around him go on but if you open the door to the enemy that's a different story and many of us open the door to the enemy with what we watch yes the M the music the the movies the shows all these things that doors because your eyes are going to your soul so turn what set a nonsense and because of that you even aware of it over years over time the devil dropping seeds in their heart and that what we have to cast out love for these things and and after a while is it's it's because it's only two forces only two influences you know it's either God or the devil you know amen like I said I'm not preaching this morning just talking there some Godly advice because there's coming a day when you're going to have to give an account for this very service on this day September the 1st you wouldn't forget this day I said to young people there are some numbers in your phone need to remove there's some people you need to stop taking their calls there's some places you need to stop going there are some shows you have to get rid of I cannot do it for you your parents can do it for you you have to do it for yourself anybody with me this morning and this applies to somebody the adults as well you know but the mam said it was we we us start saying years ago that no doubt was taken from this verse keep your skirts clean it meant don't get involved in questionable things others will be involved and you might be tempted to be involved or someone might try to involve you but stay clear of it we have too much compromisers and on this one I have to hit some of the parents because when your young people leave your home you see how they live but if you say well it's okay go they still have bull P something because when this is why go tell them kill all the amikit you know kill them when when they're small because when you tolerate things and it grow and grow and then it gets a point where it it's no longer checkable until the child now reach a level of rebellion because Rebellion is a as a sin of Witchcraft I'm warning you parents who still have the opportunity to create the environment that this house is a house of praise and worship this house is a house that's under the token this house stands for certain things I saw my dad many years ago told family members we have certain standards here certain things can't happen here if you're coming to this house dress a certain way are we are we here you can't go to cour house just how you want in know so what's wrong with having standards as a person as an individual I have met business people who say I don't drink I don't smoke because it clouds my ability to make strategic decisions that's not even based on no biblical principle they just want to make the best decisions to win and we have wishy-washy Christians who s a little social drink what's wrong with you what kind of nonsense is that listen I still warming up and I still in the I start to get into anything yet how could people who don't have no spiritual Foundation have more guts to stand for something than we who are here you have people who are successful say we I don't spend time with people with negative energy I guard the energy around me some of us we like the pity party we want to spend people who taking going nowhere they just complaining they just complaining is complaining what are you feeding yourself on I don't care whether you're eight whether you're 10 whether you're 15 or you're 92 here this morning you have to take a stand but obit said years ago it always stuck with me as a young person growing up throw the acts first I'm a Christian get your job to help you stay accountable because the moment you make the Declaration I'm a Christian they say but m Christian does do this or do do this and it will make you feel icted some of us don't want nobody to know we are Christian especially the brothers let start on the [Applause] brothers the sisters have more pressure because you have to cover your knees is not an option is it a discussion it's not a suggestion it's not a recommendation it's a requirement from the [Applause] word if God said it that's it it settles it dress like a Christian walk like a Christian talk like a Christian you represent a kingdom so these sisters have a work to do because they have a public declaration by the way they move the way they dress the way they act to have a testimony let people wonder what kingdom you come from and the Bible says my people shall never be ashamed how could you be embarrassed for standing in truth how could you be embarrassed because if you embarrass of God he'll be embarrassed of you you know people proud to dress how they want live what they want they decline they identifying this way and they I identify as this I'm I identifying as a Christian [Music] people changing pronouns okay I identify as a Christian as a Christian I have principles I dress a certain way I speak a certain way I Daniel had a choice he got to go and hide in the bathroom and pray but he was not ashamed he had a testimony and against persecution he did what was right and I say we go and TR the land then I say sorry I already mean that no know he knew what was right some of us we need a stronger conviction we need to be convinced we need to be persuaded that judgment is over the Earth judgment is over the government judgment is over the seas judgment is over everything judgment is over homes in fact the Bible said judgment will begin in the house of God and the ancient men those who have heard this and did nothing with it I don't know who this is for this morning but don't let me see you walking out your school young sister and you have the shortest skirt we know all the tricks years ago it's not a new thing years ago people stashing shorter skirt in the bag they leaving your house with a longer skirt and have a shorter skirt but I want I expose everything today because they think we born yesterday I told my wife my daughter have enough years on the earth to challenge me yet you enough years and years I remember young sisters they they leave hor house looking Christian you know but by time they hit the mat taxi that skirt change and next skirt because us who here now we are born this size of we went to school too listen you might believe it I thought I was going to be a bad boy at one pointed I'm not sure this SP will be received but I had my wannabe gangster days stepen gang stop it please sister Nicholas not here today good good good because if she was here we'd have to be getting some special help for her at one point I thought I was bad I rolling with boys boy one day I get Rob leaving school my ganger is done but I to watch Street to make sure I can walk on the road I said to read psalms leaving school the Psalms the Lord is my shepher I think Gideon Gideon were you with me when yeah Gideon was with me we walking on the road and about six men grabed the watch off my hand walk with a big stick there I don't even know how the rubbery start finish I just keep walking in a days the stepen Paul the next day I leave school with my [Applause] Bible that was the that's when I retired from the ganger life help me I remember coming over from school and my mom saying wherever your pick that up wherever it was put it back we where where the parents who talk so and all this is part of the shaping so there's nothing new the Bible say there's nothing new Under the Sun and through this struggle is a crisis of identity and purpose for God to try to work something out and for you to have enough faith and believe because at that point it drove me to the Bible now I wouldn't know how much I would fall in love with scripture and studying but maybe no thing about it have been starting point you know thank God for the robbery yes afterbody you learned to thank God for your trials it was a good watch it was a nice watch too but it changed my approach to leaving school I think I called Dad a few times to pick him up and think my faith was weak but the reality we go through different experiences and the issue is young people what we trying to help you to see is that there are mistakes that we have made that you don't need to make and anyone and and butov said it I believe earlier this same service our parents most of them did the best they know how to do you know and that's why it's so important that we could learn from each other because there's wisdom in having the conversation about the reality of life but would talk about he was in a job one day and this lady say some some move she push and he say I'm married see the ring she say who care about that and that was how much years ago now forget it you have women who want to be the chick because they don't want to be the responsibility of the being your wife this word just Twisted so you can't walk around blinders anybody with me this [Applause] morning keep your skirts clean it men don't get involved in questionable things others will be involved and you might be tempted to be involved or someone might even try to involve you but stay clear of it all by steering a course away from it I remember in form two I think it was I can't remember what yeah it was there was a walkeron in school secondary school and my dad was not comfortable sending me to the walkon so he sent her older brother young brother but older than me to be like the person to watch us now chaperon well I couldn't believe it cuz the chaperon was bopping to the music so I trying to understand who watching who good intention wrong selection but the reality is friends and I've said it before peer pressure as a young person as a Believer should not be people putting pressure on you it should be you putting pressure on other people I remember preaching in school I remember having heated debates about scripture my whole life has been me fighting to get people to believe this thing is right you ever tried to testify about the goodness of the Lord my growth I'm sharing my testimony was because people say well show me in the Bible what they say and show me this and show and well I couldn't show them know you ever meet somebody Challenge and recognize well they no different things and you recognize you had no answers for certain and recognize you have to go back and go back to basics and then get better and come back again I'll come back for you tomorrow but that's how you get sharp because the Bible say be ready to give an answer for why you standing with but if you can't answer why you're doing what you're doing you'll get washed upen you have to believe God sent a prophet you have to believe this thing is right you have to believe that there's a purpose for your life you have to believe that there are things that God hates the thing that God loves and you have to have a testimony if you believe that things would show you off you'll be off every day is a every sun is a crank up let me kick out him again bring bring the jumper cables but when you have a revelation of this thing you could put you anywhere Daniel was in a foreign land and he was still a Believer Esther was in a foreign land she lost her vision but she was still a Believer she didn't fall and put on the makeup and all the earrings and all the thing no no no no no she Liv a clean thing and that is what caught the attention of the king can the church say Amen could you take a a bit more stay clear of it by steering a course away from it friends I'll say it it this way up to yesterday I was sharing this with with Dad in business Steve Jobs was considered one of the greatest CEOs of the 21st century with how he Led Apple to being apple apple is an incredible company I'm just not advocating I mean I'm advocating for their phones and stuff it's not a paid announcement but it's a fantastic company and he made a statement he said success in business is much more about saying no than saying yes because every day a deal comes an opportunity comes a request for this comes and the better you get at knowing what you don't want to see is the clearer what you want to see appears bringing the way the prophet presented it he said when was Michelangelo was carving out he said what he wasn't trying to carve out the image he was cutting what was not supposed to be there so that only what was supposed to be there remained anybody with me you have to learn to say no all right so Church could we just say no no did everybody get it not St Paul I didn't see you say I want everybody to say no that was 82% let's say no let's just try it one more I just a little louder let's say no no all right how hard was that I want you to go home and practice that later because have plenty people who will come to you and you have to tell them no no I don't go I don't want to go I'm not interested [Applause] no let me go now no and you will realize no actually get your stress to drop you is a liberating word know because when you put yourself in situations where you start to feel uncomfortable and then it's a pressure I think sister Karen spoke about it years ago the young we had a youth youth service and it was an end of year Christmas function in the office and they had little drinks and alcohol and thing and they say well why you don't drink too she say well I I'm a Christian and the person who was offering said well I'm a Christian too and if you not grounded and cast in no then you well you in a country and the and the longer you take to say no is a hole that it hard to come out of it but the faster you say no is the Freer you BEC coming them let them say but you real boring but I am so boring have any other word you want to use you have to be comfortable in your skin I'm not interested I'm not going if if you tell me one more time I'll will never come again how hard is that what what points you lose when you really assess and this is where I say when you meet people who at the end of their Road and they start to Value life and recognize what was worth it than what was not they come to say all is Vanity how thing we stress about not word stressing about you know all the people they trying to impress and please rarely even care about you you know can I say that again have the people they trying to impress and and you're trying to organize yourself to look a certain way they don't care about you and how could they when you are on OD ball God blessed us with not with with with God blessed us to not have the ability to hear people really thinking because if you really hear what people thinking about you you stay in your house and never come out because the people who think you who you think are your friends not your friends you know I say to young people all the time try to understand who trying to go where you are going because I'm trying to go to heaven I trying to make it to the other side and only perfect love will get me there so if what they're trying to do not supporting that mission that is not your friend there has to be a line of separation between where you are going and everything else and if it's not where you're going then why is it taking your time your energy or even more stressing you out can we go some more you there laying brown powder like per but you you you you okay you there fighting you and the Bron po having war you they trying to find every you want to be so close to the edge because you know you're not supposed to have a makeup but you're trying to I don't even know how to articulate this thing brother friends you're not from the world stop trying to look like the world the world need them kind of thing because they don't look as good as you let me start this morning let let me start this morning there a what I could see let me reverse the car of that one I think the point just made but don't try to be like the world but the brandom said there only one woman painted her face like that that was Jezebel you have to have a testimony be different be proud to be different we said it before when you look Queen Elizabeth is who just passed on right yes you never see see Queen Elizabeth walking she in her tight pants or a minis skirt Lizzie no no no that's not how it was working that was the queen she carried herself as a queen yes see no picture of she going in VIP much less a line to go into her fet because she's the queen even the royal family and this is not just across all the royal families Denmark Finland you name all the different countries I think was for her funeral or the wedding or whatever it was you see everybody dressed a certain way everybody neede properly covered every and it was they defin it as the classiness of royalty you supposed to be so proud to dress like royalty when people challenge how you dress you need to tell them step up to my level there's a level I'm operating at that you need to understand when you understand the level I'm at come talk to me somebody preach back to me don't let them pull you down to their [Applause] level I want us to stick because we let these nonsense influencers on the internet Define how people supposed to live the word is already twisted and perverted in know and because we become so tolerant of the foolishness we accepted for is so your nails your hair your thing everything is you're trying to be like the world that not going into heaven can I say that again well Lord I could I could come in here with this nail thing with this foot polish this nail am I talking to anybody the Bible say I'm the Lord and I change not he has a standard know I say again even a natural court of law you can't well I go into court put a vest a white beer they will stop you at the entrance you cannot go into a natural Court like that you cannot go into a court with them kind of min hallelujah how much more for the house of God how much more for your own house because you could establish parameters for your house for your life and for whatever else you cannot control you could control this Temple you can control this body and the Bible say present your body as a Living Sacrifice holy and acceptable your body is a sacrifice how you dress how you move how you live where you carry it what you do with it that's a sacrifice because his body wants to do all kind of thing but you need to bring your body under subjection can I can we have a conversation this morning could we take some more I lose track of time God is going to reward those who follow this advice that is the prophet's words amen Godly advice to the young people you cannot go everywhere you cannot do anything you cannot speak a certain way there's some jokes that you make that those words shouldn't be coming out your mouth that's one part of it the other part is you shouldn't be living a double life that what people see here and a Sunday is is who you are but after Sunday don't catch you on a Monday evening because they see real you and don't don't let somebody push you because if they push you well it's then it wasn't me upset to know but it's because she pushed me you see a whole different person and it's not a different person or know it's really who you are because under pressure and stress the real you always shows up in them that's why companies have probation because you when people join a company I see over and over anybody who manage boy they want people early to thing oh gosh they thing they thing week one week two week three some many people the holding straight you see them struggle because you real them they inside the house the real the real person who come late the real person who don't do the work right they take shortcut by the time they reach the probation Mark the real you then stand up there big and gold you can't hide it no more you know amen that's why I need a change that's what the new birth is for to change the old nature because while we can have all these conversations which is about your love to God not rules but your love to God that has you live in a certain way I want to repeat that again this is not a bunch of rules we are discussing this morning it's your love to God grows to such a point you want to please him and do the things that he loves the things that he wants to see the thing that he takes pleasure in your love for him starts to align with his love for you but there's another part of this which changes the Inside Man until the Inside Man don't want to do the evil things no more somebody preach back to me this morning that's why the Bible says if you love me keep my Commandments only if you love him oh God help me this morning is there anybody who love the Lord this morning because if you love him then keeping his Commandments is not a formality it's not a stressful thing it's not a feeling pressure no you love him so much that song says I love him too much to fail him now and every day with Jesus supposed to be sweeter than did before I love him more and more my love become so much I glad to throw out the clothes and throw away the music and all the I want to get rid of it because I want to please [Applause] him you may be seated I preached it before I still working on it preached it before I know my wife watching She's recovery about she watching the home she say I will have to deal with this when I go back home but I say when love your wife you tell put the white clothes here and put the colored clothes here don't mix it up because it makes it harder to to wash it that could be fed like a rule but it's not a rule I love her are supposed to do it brother stepen we all have some growing up to do but the point I want to make is you could see as a rule but in reality Your Love drives your behavior a certain way we are supposed to be interesting in thing that God loves God loves when we sing he loves when we worship you come to church and you ain't [Applause] singing you singing Silent Night not the song you just silent but when you come in church you come with praise on your lips s say I was glad when they s to me let's go there are people here who are glad I know they're glad they're glad to Lord and there's some of us we need to get happier and see this as the greatest thing we could have ever experienced that the grace of God could extend to us and God could send a prophet with a message of reality that could change us not information and knowledge but who you are as a person is changed now you want to forgive you want to look past somebody else's faults you may be seated and friends we are not saying this this morning to point fingers and do this do this do this we are all trying to grow because all of us have things to fix all of us have things to improve all of us are pressing to that Mark all of us are striving to Perfection all of us need to get better at forgiving at loving at praising at serving at being more humble more honest if God could tell the prophet you need to be more sincere what about you and I Lord help us get a deeper sincerity is either this thing is right or it's wrong but if it's right then let's do it with 100% with our everything and watch God bless our homes bless our families bless our finances bless our marriages bless us anybody in the house this [Applause] morning so Church stay out of shady places what you doing in a bar what you doing in a club what you doing after hours and what what what are you trying to do because you might start saying I drink it I just because I after workk something and it might be innocent you know but the environment takes a toll on you and willower is like a candle scientifically proven you can wake up any morning your willow is highest by the evening you're tired scientifically proven that's why they say some of the most important decisions to make you make first thing in the morning e you're tired people may typically make bad decisions in the evening because you're ready to go to sleep okay whatever happen sobody tell me reach young you're avoiding fried food you're avoiding this all this is your willow going down tell me even you have two more Willow left and the catch a bad day one Willow after what no Willow and then you on a fried chicken but you there with a with a dinner special Court CT on camera with a dinner special i n will be having it because your willower eroded and that's why it's so important for you to manage your environment but over preached about it there was a brother he not here now I trust he get delivered whenever he passed by Fernandez on the main road and that smell hit him look up tell brother don't take no main Ro Maxi find a highway taxi main Ro not for you because if that is your weakness then you avoid Shady places other people is not their weakness it don't bother them another brother whenever par season come dies it he take us six weeks soeno s Reno can't find him for six weeks caught him in the spirit you have to know because what will affect you when it affect somebody else it have brothers will stand up there and no woman is the issue no man but alcohol something else old talk it could be just be old talk you know you like to talk trippiness lust for money lust of popularity loss of the eyes loss of the flesh you pride of life for some people is the ambition some people just Pride all of us have our thing to deal with so don't go around judging other people for this the issue is for us to realize that we have work to do and we come to service to see from the word because the word is the mirror we supp to look in at the word and say wait a minute something off here you know it's not us trying to correct you you have to do self correction because you have to give an account the responsibility of the ministry is to preach the word clearly to you so that it's not our responsibility anymore but the moment I let you know that you're supposed to live a certain way based on your word then it's on you anybody with me this evening husband love your wife that's a command you know there's no command for wies to love their husbands because the makeup of a woman is different is built into heart to love but the husbands need to be commanded love them as Christ loved the church which qualifies the kind of love not I love she and bu a fridge it's fridge love brother over just say talk about fridge love you have to appreciate the H the pastor it is keep us in line no we talk about fridge love but as Christ loved the church a certain Behavior a certain act certain attitude so the command to the husbands to love the wives and the command to the wives is to what reverence could the love part be there but the reverence part is be harder Sarah call Abraham Lord I know some sisters get a little to chew that one a little slowly I want a little slowly I wish my wife was here today we have nice conversations around these things say but Sarah call Abraham Lord I tell him to call me Lord but I mean there any Scripture let's I I didn't make it up it's there but it's in the word for us to see friends that there's a better way and the more you align with the way the word presents it is he better your relationships become and the way you deal with life become and the way you deal with situation become because all hell is against us not part of hell you know all of hell is against us you know and if there's a weak spot in your armor then you're going to get knocked out what we trying to do is avoid having to resuscitate people every Sunday because you're putting on the whole armor of God so you could stand in that day against the Ws of the attacks of of the enemy anybody with me so we we get stronger and when we back one another up one will put 1,000 to flight two put 10,000 to flight and we row the enemy out of our homes R the enemy out of our Lives R the enemy out of our families can the church say Amen could it take some more I didn't even expect to be here this long this morning in choosing of a bride but the B said that many time men and women here go truth isn't that what's happening this morning because we taking it from the scripture from the prophet me it is it truth it's certain behaviors children obey your parents that's the word not disrespect them not mow them off not because you have two degree and two o levels and two CXC or whatever they want to call it and many time men and women hear God's truth and see it Vindicated and proven truth but yet they don't want to hear it there's some other reason in other words they taking some kind of advice there's some other choosing that they have than to face up the truth and facts therefore their ears can be closed to the gospel I'm reading the prophets words they'll never hear it again my advice to you when God speaks to your heart you act right then Elijah gave them a choice which they should choose you this day whom You Shall Serve if God be God serve him but if bail be God serve him friends I want to encourage you I'm not going to be too much longer with you the Bible said every knee will bow every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord the man who say there is no God will have to confess the man who believe in whatever religion he wants to believe will have to confess that Jesus Christ is the Lord that's the word and we have a great privilege through the message of this hour to see Jesus Christ present tense walking out of the pages of this word with Rapture and faith and everything else in there to see clearly what we are called to do are to understand the attack of the enemy that we are dealing with friends we must have a church on the word or no church at all we are in a crisis we need to see that we are in a crisis a crisis in our homes a crisis in the nation a crisis everywhere and if we're in a crisis it means we must operate a certain way making a valley full of ditches I'm going to be about 10 more minutes or so show me your company and I'll tell you who you are amen let me walk into your house let me see what's laying over on the table let me see the how the Bible is marked up let me see what's on your phone let me see your last 25 WhatsApp conversations let me see what you're spending time with on Facebook and on Tik Tok and on Instagram that tells me who you are you don't need to tell me just just just let me see that and I know am what you watch on YouTube what you I don't need you to tell me let let me see I know for myself that's what the prophet is saying here let me see how the Bible's marked up let me see where it's all true stories let me listen to what kind of music you're playing on your radio half of the trouble people is getting because of music you know Lucifer was in charge of Music he was a music director so that music that get people angry music that people come home and they in a in a state because the music work them up David played the half he played music to drive evil spirits away from King Saul so music could move Spirits away from you music could lift music could bring spirits to you how much criminals listen to music before Comm committing an act they pych itself up and the music put them in a spirit to go and do what they want to do be very careful what music will listen to you know musicians some some I want to get it you put up a picture behind a church and see people with their hands lifted and somebody in pulpit and put a picture in a party or concert you ready can tell what is the environment because both pictures will show people hands up and there's somebody with a microphone it's worship people go to concerts and their hands there in the spirit of the song and the song gets lodged into the heart and the spirit and songs could break marriage song could lead you into fornication song could lead you into adultery song could lead you straight to hell because the musicians and the singers they are ministers you know the devil has ministers right yes I will say it clearly here the most effective ministers that the enemy uses right now is in the music real that's the most effective in the songs and the songs telling it this song and that and and and people just singing it and they don't even understand the meaning of the words sometime we'll get into it when you take the some of the songs and phrases people don't even know the meaning of the words in the songs and when you see the meaning is talking a devil worshiping and they singing the words not even knowing what the words actually mean you think it's a game you think it's just a casual thing we wrestleing against flesh and blood so be very careful Church young people what you listen to what you feed your spirit what you see because your eyes is AD da to the soul you see somethingone that change your whole perception of life and before you know it you can't reconcile your walk with God because you're watching things that you're not supposed to watch look I read an article recently some movie came out and people went to get psychiatric help after watching a movie some horror movie one is the why would you watch something that is so horrible that will drive it to a psychiatrist but the thing is what is the content of it that would drive you to go and see medical help to recalibrate your mind because it have you so traumatized you couldn't sleep and people have to get prescription to sleep because what they so trouble their spirit so much you catch that now let me see what kind of music you're playing on your radio let me see what kind of pictures you got in your house and I'll tell you what you made out of yes sir this I'm reading from the prophet that's what your soul is feeding on so people say well I'm going to the gym and I and I running or walking on the treadmill and what you listening to I want something a beat so I could move faster but what you listening to this wouldn't apply to everybody but there's somebody here it applies to that's what your soul is feeding on regardless of what your testimony is your fruits prove what you are your soul feeds on something and whatever the characteristic of your soul is that what it'll show forth that's the reason Jesus said by their fruit you shall know them in the message straight is the gate you have to make a choice you can't stand neutral you've got to say yes yes or no and we already touched on that earlier you never leave that door the same person you came in you can do it you've got a choice to make make it for Christ today let me warn you this morning church be careful I'm reading from the prophet it takes time today in our self righteous self-sufficient generation of hypocrisy that we are living in and our when men and women stand in the churches and in the pews and sing the anthems of God and walk out of that church and smoke cigarettes and drink whiskey and go to dances and live for the world and tell dirty smutty jokes and call themselves Christians same message straight to the gate he said as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the coming of the son of man oh out of 10,000 there was trees saved so as we approach this New Year young people church family friends we have a responsibility God against the music guard against the social media guard against movies and the content to friends and the family the associations look at today how people will stay home that call themselves Christians this is the prophet in 1964 and listen to such characters as Pat Boon Elvis Presley Ernie Ford and those who sing hymns on Sunday and look at them things they look at them kissing them wom and things out there where the Prophet says when no man should ever kiss a woman till he is married to her but look at it today all these movies and things it's public adultery brother brandham said work events social drinking all crafted to be an influence clothes being challenged but the BAM said in the junction of time it's a sin and a shame that way people are living and doing out on the streets naked young girls and old grandmas and all together and then go to church and sing in the choir and call yourself righteous your fruits show what you are why do you want to strip your clothes off for only one person in the Bible ever did and he was demon-possessed am I'm not saying that to be rude I'm saying that to warn you this may be the last time I ever see you or speak with you I want you to remember listen to The Prophet let me tell you something sister you may be as pure as a lily to your husband but on that day of judgment you're going to be counted an adulterous when you dress yourself like that these old sexy looking clothes that they wear and get out here in the street do you know that when a sinner looks at you and though you could be as pure as you can be that sinner lusting after you commits adultery with you said Jesus in his heart and when that sinner has to answer for adultery who presented their s to him you are guilty if he committed adultery who did he commit it with what caused him to do it because you dressed yourself like that but Bram shoots out he says get out of my private life because he's feeling what people are thinking in the service he said that's what you say to the Lord this is his word you say they don't sell any other kind of clothes brother brandham he said they sell sewing machines so there's no excuse you know that's right we don't spend enough time on these things you know because we have a lot of people with excuses and so butam goes on and father the hour is come get a little quiet father the hour has has come so on but today the whole nation is in that Trend use the word trend and we have this social media term more what's trending people want to be trending so the fashion the style the clothes they want to be in the latest Trend friends I'm not saying this for you to to feel uncomfortable that's know the objective here you know the objective is you to look at yourself in the word and say if you really want this thing called Christianity then this is what it looks like if you really want to be a believer it has a certain look a certain Behavior a certain expectation from God and America is not no more really America it's not no more Christian Nation it's a woman's Nation little old Jezebel go down the street all painted up and brother man will fall on their knees to her that's right I know that kind of hurts but that's the truth the BAM said let me say something right here my ladies I hope you all love me and I I'm not here to criticize you I'm only here to know that yonder at the day of judgment I will have to answer when I know these things and don't tell them then if I do warn you then the blood is off of my hand and that's the burden we are coming with this morning to make sure the blood is off of our hand so that you understand from the word not an idea not a suggestion but he who is Holy Holy still he who is righteous righteous still he who is filthy filthy still it's either you want God that's why the word says choose you this day whom you will serve because if you want to be a real Christian God will bless you for it but if you're not sure then you are looking at judgment I'm kneeling it down behold I stand at the door let me tell you something something sister there was only one woman in the Bible that ever painted her face her name was Jezebel and God fed her to the dogs you don't want to be one of her daughters it's a disgrace 2 Timothy 3 the musician get ready to come forward this know also that in the last days perilous time shall come for men shall be lovers of their own selves Covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient appearance un thankful Unholy without natural affection truth Breakers false accusers incontinent Fierce despisers of those that are good traitors heavy highminded lovers of pleasures moreour and lovers of God Amen we live in a selfish ungrateful World an entitled world I did a whole bible study on entitlement and the curse of entitlement where people live life thinking the world owe them something and that's how it's supposed to be having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turnaway from God's provided way it's not necessary that any man would go to hell listen to The Prophet now God don't send no one to hell he said you send yourself to Hell God's done everything in the world he can to keep you from going to hell and yet you determined to go to hell so going to hell brother B presents is a choice by the decisions we make you fight over every barricade God puts in your way you just go right on over it I don't believe in this and I don't believe in that and I don't believe in this that's what brother talking about and there's a red light here in the city and it turns red and green that tells you when to stop and go and if you run it well don't blame the city they put the light up there for your protection but if you run on through it that's up to you you brought your own judgment you could begin to play something Softly and I warn you in the name of Jesus Christ get in the kingdom of God now that's right don't you fool about it you press in because there's coming a time when you'll scream and cry to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost it'll be shut off from you I trust in some way this morning this little encouragement this Godly advice to the young people that is to the entire church but to the young people in particular would bring a stark reality of God's love for us his expectation of us and will give us some things that we could go back and think on study on look on reflect on so that we could approach this new year with a conviction and A Renewed focus on Lord I want to serve you because we'll pray for you but you have to one God you have have to want change you have to want the Holy Ghost you have to want to live the right kind of life you
