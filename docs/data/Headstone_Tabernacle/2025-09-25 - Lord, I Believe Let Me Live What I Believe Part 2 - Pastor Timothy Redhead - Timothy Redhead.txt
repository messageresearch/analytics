Amen. &gt;&gt; The streams thereof shall make glad the city of God, the holy place of the tabernacles of the most high. God is in the midst of her and she shall not be moved.

We pray in Jesus name we ask it. Amen. Amen. God bless you, man. Have a seat. Praise him Lord. Welcome each and every one of you here tonight. And tonight we have a special speaker, Brother Redhead from Grenada. He want to share the word with us. We have a special guest among us. Praise God. Brother Peter Chandler's daughter and her husband and family is here. Could you stand? God bless you and welcome Headstone Tabernacle. God bless you, my brother. Thank you. Praise the Lord. Amen, Sister Abigail. Praise God. Amen. So, God bless you and we send our love and greetings to the saints on that side. And we certainly welcome to have them here today. Praise God. Amen. So, we're looking forward for a wonderful time to the Lord. We want God to speak to us. We want God to bless us and help us and be refreshed by his presence. Let's sing through it all. Through it all, I learn to touch in Jesus. That's my brother. True. True. Through it all. I learn to trust in Jesus and learn to trust in God. Oh, through it all. Through it all. Through it all. I learn to depend upon his word. So I thank God for the mountains. I thank God for the valleys. I thank him for the trials and been through. If I never had a problem, I never knew that God would solve them. Never know what faith in this word can do. Oh, tonight through it all. Through it, Lord. Through it all, I learn I learn to trust in Jesus. I learned to trust in God. Through it all, through it all, I learn to defend. Through it all, true it all. Oh, through it all. through it all. I learn to trust in Jesus. I learn to trust in God. Sing it. Through it all, through it all, I learn to depend upon his word. Amen. Amen. Glory. Let's give the Lord a praise. Hallelujah. Through it all. Amen. And amen. Amen. And although the song says I've learned, I'm still learning. &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads. Heavenly Father, we thank you for the opportunity you've given us tonight. And we thank you for precious brother Hov and the church here in Headstone Tabernacle. Truly we feel your presence every time we come. And it's always good Lord when the anointing is there. So father all we have to do is step in and then you would lead because without you we are nothing. &gt;&gt; Lord if you don't come then I might as well sit down. And that is why we've been praying. That is why we've been trusting. And that's why we have the faith that you are here &gt;&gt; to bring us into that place where we cannot go cuz you have the eyes, you have the wings, and you have the strength and we have the need. So I pray that you will meet it and you would lead us and satisfy us &gt;&gt; just like you did with Abraham when he was told that you are the double breasted God. El Shad &gt;&gt; Lord. And there something else to have two breasts to suck on at the same time. One on the left, one on the right. When you're tired on the left, you go on the right. Father, we are grateful. &gt;&gt; Please Lord, &gt;&gt; have your own way tonight. And we'll not forget to give you the praise, the honor, and the glory in Jesus magnificent name. And all the people say, &gt;&gt; turn around and greet the person next to you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. You can have your seats when you're finished. And it's good to see all of you are here this evening. And I realize that we are in a holiday and usually you know people tend to gravitate to rest. I tried to do that but I got labors and you're like oh brother um Isaac said that labor into your rest I never thought of that so I couldn't say no and when you can't fight the word &gt;&gt; and you cannot break the word to fulfill the word &gt;&gt; so I had no choice but it's good to be here because brother and I go back a while and since in the days of brother Mio who introduced me to him and I love He's a real man of God. &gt;&gt; And I think as a church here, you should be real happy. &gt;&gt; I usually, you know, when I'm home, I am not, you know, preachers funny. We get funny ways. And I normally don't tune into a lot of preachers because I don't want to have bad thoughts, especially these days. So to avoid bad thoughts, I choose my battles &gt;&gt; and I choose who I listen to because the amount of voices they have over there today, you're wondering what's going on. &gt;&gt; I know it's in the end time and it's difficult and that is why I choose my my battles. So the ones I choose, I don't have a problem. And before I go further, let me greet the young lady in the back. I've heard of Brother Chandler. I've never met him, but meeting you, it makes us connect. So, God bless you. And let me also greet brother Isaac. Couple times we met coming through Grenada and I always uh admire him and when he preaches I see myself when I was his age and that that brother has had an experience with God. That's my personal take and I've had my own share. We've been on the road. I might look a little older when brother because you take better care of him. But we are same age. And I realized something since I came here in Trinidad. You eat now and worry later. We don't have that pleasure because things home expensive. So while we are buying we have to worry then eat. So we pray that the Lord will bless you all and the musicians you know I don't have that privilege. I have to play and then preach and when I come here and I see all of that my daughter said oh my god could you imagine so I have to see if I can get a labor from here is fair exchange come Grenada and see if you can help us. Amen. So time flies past and when I was here the last time I didn't even have time to give the the um the scripture readings and so on and uh you have had some amazing meetings recently and it puts me in uh the vocative it puts me in a place now what do I do after up there I can't bring it down so you need to help me bring you bring me up &gt;&gt; to where you are so that I can be there at least with my head above water because it was an amazing service and and I heard that brother when he was going he was just gone. real wonderful preacher &gt;&gt; and it's good to see that you know all is not lost but how we still have some men who still have some fire &gt;&gt; because a lot of churches and the message these days while they are speaking you are sleeping so it's and I worry about that because like brother I don't really have time for games when I see what's going on and when we have to deal with demons and devils and spirits And then you have to present a church &gt;&gt; to God. &gt;&gt; And let me tell you, those of you who don't know, I worry all the time and I never come here without spending a lot of time before God because one day I have to give an account &gt;&gt; about what I tell you, &gt;&gt; what I tell him and what I tell myself. &gt;&gt; So I take it very seriously and I never ever go and preach or do anything just like that. I spend a lot of time asking him because I am nothing &gt;&gt; and I don't know about you but I am nothing &gt;&gt; and uh all my and when I'm praying and these days the more I pray is the more I realize how nothing I am &gt;&gt; and I go deep down and I say Lord and sometimes in my prayer all I'm saying is Lord have mercy Lord have mercy Lord have mercy and you may say Tim well you're a preacher but you see when you become a preacher the words open up &gt;&gt; and you have no excuse I preach a message like got no excuse. Though what an inexcusable &gt;&gt; oh man &gt;&gt; and many times we don't realize we have no excuse with all that have been told us &gt;&gt; and I treated very very seriously. &gt;&gt; So I trust that you are praying for me that the Lord will help me to stick and stay with the word &gt;&gt; because we must give an account. A lot of people now being let loose in the pulpit and they are committing a lot of damage and I don't want to be one of them because when you are gone that's when you know who you were &gt;&gt; what is said about you &gt;&gt; your legacy is your life &gt;&gt; and you build your legacy with what how you live &gt;&gt; not so much what you say but how you live. And I I say that and I want to get into it, but I just want to feel a little comfortable. You know, you are here. I am coming. So help me so I can feel a little comfortable and settle in. But I was speaking to I'm I I like to observe things. I don't only preach, but I like to see what I preach and observe people and observe things and observe myself. And I was speaking to someone in the message and I was trying to reconcile what they were saying. She said at one time they were told forsake not the assembling of yourselves together and now they are told that pass but the Bible didn't change &gt;&gt; and they had difficulty with that and then they were told you must um have communion and feet washing and so on. Now they told another story. Now these are serious things &gt;&gt; because he said you cannot add neither can you take &gt;&gt; and especially he's not so much talking to you but he's talking to those that he has given the charge &gt;&gt; to bring the word to the people. &gt;&gt; And I don't know what's wrong with people today but I fear God. &gt;&gt; I fear God so much that I would rather wait than be presumptuous. &gt;&gt; I am afraid. He is wonderful. But there's another side. Same amount of love, same amount of legs. &gt;&gt; Same amount of love, same amount of seriousness. &gt;&gt; God so love and that God is so wrathful. &gt;&gt; Everything in him is extreme. There's no part. There's no little piece. Is that because he's perfect. So you must recognize you who are coming here and serving the Lord, you're not going to walk away &gt;&gt; cuz every day you get the word, &gt;&gt; it's recorded in your conscience. &gt;&gt; Even if you don't turn it on, it's there. &gt;&gt; And if you try to ignore it when you are dying, &gt;&gt; God turns it on. &gt;&gt; Not you. God turns it on. And then you see all those things that you had the chance &gt;&gt; cuz all the labor that we as ministers put down is not in vain. &gt;&gt; It will not return void. &gt;&gt; And so you need to understand that this is not a game. &gt;&gt; That this is life and death. And that's how God started in the garden &gt;&gt; and it has not changed. &gt;&gt; So when you come to a church, choose a church that gives you the word. But once you get that church and you choose that church to go to, stay with it until &gt;&gt; because you need to recognize you will be judged &gt;&gt; by what you know. &gt;&gt; By what you know. &gt;&gt; So God can't judge me if I don't know what you know. He will judge me by what I know. So to whom much is given, much is required. I'm saying all of that so you could get a little understanding of me because I I kind of different to most preachers and I tend to go down &gt;&gt; and when I come in your house I'm in the I'm down in the basement. I like to go and check down there because you could have a nice looking house but rat infested mice infested ants infested and it's only when it will give in. &gt;&gt; So I'd like to go down because I like to see why we do these things. What causes us to behave like that? For example, I observe you. You you come and you rejoice and you you're wonderful. And I ask myself, how long does it last? &gt;&gt; After you come and you rejoice and you give praise, is it as long as going down in the car? &gt;&gt; Is it on you still Monday, &gt;&gt; Tuesday? When I preach the whole week, the anointing is on me still because I stay in prayer &gt;&gt; so that I can live close to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; We don't have no guarantee. &gt;&gt; The only guarantee we have is that as long as you have faith, you will remain what you said you are. &gt;&gt; You can have faith now and lose it in another 5 minutes. &gt;&gt; And that's what I want to talk to you about this evening and to show you that God give you a long time to live. Not to live to enjoy yourself, but to live to please him. &gt;&gt; And if you please him, you will be happy. &gt;&gt; Amen. So I tend to make people think and I believe that when I'm finished preaching and if you're not thinking about it then I fail. &gt;&gt; My job is to help you that you will never be the same person again. &gt;&gt; That's all I live for. I'm not much. I'm a little spokes when I was dunkers. Brother Isaac came down mighty man of God and I laugh. Mighty is overrated. Anyhow, let's go to the word and you have had the scripture readings and I'm going to get I have couple of them because I'm starting now and finish on Sunday of God is give us the mercies and I know a lot of people expect the rapture but I don't think they're right because nobody know the day nor the hour. All they wanted to do was a trip but we are here to go into the word. So the first scripture we're going to use is Mark 11. &gt;&gt; Mark 11 if you find it for me. And just bear with me. I'm a little slower, you know. And reading from verse 22 to 26. And may the Lord, Father God, this is your word. When you were here, you broke the bread and it multiply and fed 5,000. Lord, this is spiritual food. Break it. And those who are listening, if the Wi-Fi is working and those who are here, may we all eat in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Could you join with me? &gt;&gt; And Jesus answering said unto them, "Have faith in God. For verily I say unto you, that whosoever shall say unto this mountain, be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea, and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he see shall come to pass, he shall have whatsoever he said." These are powerful words, &gt;&gt; and many times I don't think we think about them. Therefore, I say unto you, what thingsoever you desire when you pray, believe that you receive them, and you shall have them. &gt;&gt; And when you stand praying, forgive. If you have ought against any, that your father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses. But if you do not forgive, neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses. Mark 16. I have a little reading and you know That's that's where it's coming from. Reading from verse 16 or 15. I'm going to go a little ahead of you. And he said unto them, "Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature." That's what we are doing now. He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved. He that believeth not shall be done. And these signs shall follow them that believe in my name. Shall they cast out devils. They shall speak with new tongues. I shall take up serpents. And if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them. They shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover. One more reading in Romans chapter 4. Romans chapter 4. And you can't talk faith without talking to Abraham. Reading verse hold on. There we go. Chapter 4 verse 16. Amen. &gt;&gt; Therefore, it is of faith that it might be by grace to the end the promise might be true to all the seed. Not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all. As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations before him whom you believe, even God, who quickened the dead and called those things which be not as though they were. who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken, so shall thy seed be. And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead. When he was about 100 years old, neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb. He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief, but was strong in praise, giving glory to God. And being fully persuaded, that's a that's a key thing, being fully persuaded. that what he had promised, who God had promised, he was able also to perform. May the Lord bless the word. You can have your seats. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless brother Terry, wonderful brother. Now, this evening, I want to go a little more into what I started that Holy Spirit had given me on last Wednesday about Lord, help me to live what I believe. It sound It sounds strange, but if you think about it, are we really believing or living what we believe? And this evening, I want to go a little deeper and have a text dismantling unbelief. &gt;&gt; The word dismantle is a big word. In fact, I was hoping to get one of them true them cube. You know them cube, them square cube. And I was hoping to bring it and dismantle it so you would see that it takes effort to dismantle. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You can't just say you're going to dismantle. Dismantle doesn't happen by speech. &gt;&gt; Dismantle happens by action. &gt;&gt; And faith is an action. &gt;&gt; Unbelief is a product of of one you don't believe. So beyond beyond to understand that dismantling is not something you come on a Sunday and you get and you're gone. &gt;&gt; Are you following me? That is why Abraham had some time &gt;&gt; cuz the greatest test in faith and unbelief is time &gt;&gt; and none of us have time &gt;&gt; and that's why we have problems because everybody want it &gt;&gt; now. And that is the that is the uh phenomena that we have to get rid of when we become children of God because we in into that thing where we I want it now &gt;&gt; and if we don't get it we you know we lose faith and we get weak and so on. So I want to look a little about dismantling unbelief. Now the word dismantling means to take something to pieces or take it apart or strip it bare. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me systematically? So you're pulling narrative pieces. What we want to talk about this evening is Lord help me to live what I believe. And of course unbelief is what is blocking us or this uh not allowing us to live what we believe. &gt;&gt; Now you when I say the word what I believe is what you claim and what I claim. I believe the message. I believe God sent a prophet and I believe everything I read in the Bible. &gt;&gt; The question is do I live it? &gt;&gt; Do I believe enough to live it? And if I'm not living it, why? Because God cannot lie. &gt;&gt; And you say you're lying. &gt;&gt; And two of us can be saying the same thing and not getting the results. &gt;&gt; And I know God cannot lie. So we have to assume that we are the ones that are lying. &gt;&gt; But we don't like to acknowledge it. And therefore, we need to recognize before you could fix anything, you have to find the reason that you are sick or the reason that you are like that. If you don't find a reason, then you're just doing what we call plastering. &gt;&gt; You don't want that. You want to find the cause so you can get the cure. &gt;&gt; And unbelief began in the Garden of Eden. &gt;&gt; So dismantling means disconnecting, &gt;&gt; detaching, dismembering, dividing, &gt;&gt; disassembling. All those things are connected to what we want to talk about this evening. All right. &gt;&gt; Now, let me see if I can go here and try and follow me. Now many times we think that sin which is unbelief is drinking, gambling, committing adultery. But these are just attributes of unbelief. What's the topic again? Dismantling unbelief and unbelief is the only sin. &gt;&gt; Gambling is the attribute of this sin. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. So he says the attributes of unbelief. Now those who does those things do it because they do not believe. &gt;&gt; But I thought you said you believe &gt;&gt; but then we find within ourselves these habits &gt;&gt; and we've been on the road a while. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; And we still lying. &gt;&gt; Of course we don't take it as a lie because we laugh but laughing don't make a lie the truth. &gt;&gt; And probably that's one of the reasons why we are not serious. Brother Brandham was told be more sincere &gt;&gt; and he is the one with the sign and the angel is with him &gt;&gt; and he is not sincere enough and the angel is telling him cuz I'm coming to that. So you need to understand one of the only way to grow as a Christian and remove that unbelief is be honest. &gt;&gt; There is not enough honesty in the bride of Christ. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? And honesty means you have to be honest with yourself first. It begins with me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you know, majority of us like to think that we good &gt;&gt; and we we perfect and we reach where we going. That's why we don't take telling and we don't take advice and we don't take we don't like nobody tell us anything. &gt;&gt; And if you really want to know if it's a believer, let the pastor say, "Listen, I don't think you should do that. I need think you need to stop and see if you take it with a pinch of salt or if you take it with a smile. See if you take it with knowing that he loves you and he cares. &gt;&gt; Are you following me? And these are the times that we get to know who we really are when we are being tested. &gt;&gt; And every son and every daughter must be tested, tried and proven. There is no excuse for you to go in. You have to pass through that door. You have no window climbing &gt;&gt; and you have to pass through that door though where you are proven. I listen to brother T a lot of times and he's looking for that time when we'll see the the uh the sick raised and the dead raised and the lame walk and so on. Now these are powerful things. Who's going to do it? People who have been tested, tried and proven. God is not going to give you a gun and you don't know who to shoot. &gt;&gt; You don't give your child a gun. For example, I just saw on the news a little boy seven years old put his little child sister two years in an oven and baker. &gt;&gt; Now how is he going to be staying home and do that? Because the parents were not there. &gt;&gt; God is not going to give us things to do in before Jesus here what Jesus told the disciples. Before you go and do anything about representing me with all those signs, I want you to go in the upper room. &gt;&gt; Why? Because there was a time when Jesus had gone to a place and the people didn't accept them. And when they were leaving, one of the disciples with all the godliness in him said, "Let burn them." &gt;&gt; And Jesus said, "You don't know what kind of spirit you have." &gt;&gt; And one of the things that Jesus recognizes that these brothers had zeal, but zeal without the knowledge and without the control can be destructive. &gt;&gt; Are you following me? And therefore, it's important for us to learn these things by experience. Faith comes by hearing, hearing the word of God. But you cannot get faith without an experience that brings you to a place where you really know if you believe or not. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So let's continue. So he says uh Jesus would not do those things. So these things are actually the attributes of unbelief. And there is only two spirits that control a man. That's either his faith or his doubt. And you notice not mine, yours. our faith, our doubt. Now you might think it's God's faith. You as a child of God has been appropriated a certain amount of faith to do a certain amount of thing. God will not tell me if you believe you can get what you want and then don't show me how to do it or don't allow me to do it. He don't play. &gt;&gt; He will give you a promise that is available, that is unattainable and that is possible. The problem is we don't check it out to find out why &gt;&gt; am I not getting it &gt;&gt; cuz if it is for me I want it &gt;&gt; I don't want to you know hear you in other words brother Brennham talk a lot of nice things and many miracles and signs and I'm following the same God you know many time I'm telling I say father the same way you helped brother Brennham and he was able to come to you about these things we have issues too we have needs Where do we go? &gt;&gt; To whom shall we go? We love you. We We appreciate you. And the devil is hearing that. And he's saying, "Don't don't listen to him. Don't listen to him because I don't want him to get smart. I don't want him to wake up. I don't want him to dismantle that unbelief." &gt;&gt; And you don't even realize it, but there are two people with you. When you get up, when you become a believer, Satan is just behind you. just behind your head. If you read brother Brennham, he will tell you that old evil spirit is just right there. That's why he just talk to you in your ears. &gt;&gt; In your ears. &gt;&gt; Are you getting that? That's why the air is in the head, not in the foot. &gt;&gt; He's right there because you want to go back in the house. &gt;&gt; When the unclean spirit leaves a body, it is not going and look for another house. That's his house. But I'm saying to you that that house was not designed for him. &gt;&gt; He's a thief. He's a robber. He came in without permission. He wants to come back. &gt;&gt; What you have to do is have a strong man, which is faith, which comes by hearing the word &gt;&gt; to keep him out. The devil don't play. He has one plan. I met a young lady downstairs and she uh uh was in a wheelchair. Now, I don't know about you, that break me. &gt;&gt; You know why? I'm saying I'm a preacher. I preach the gospel and I'm preaching about power and I'm preaching about deliverance and I read this verse whatsoever you desire. &gt;&gt; And I feel helpless. And I said, Lord, shouldn't I? Isn't there something that I can do? I listen to that child. The only reason she's alive today is because she has faith. &gt;&gt; I do insurance. Insurance says when you have sickle cell at 17, you die. &gt;&gt; She's sick 26. That is the grace of God. &gt;&gt; That is faith in her. &gt;&gt; She is fighting. And while she's talking to us, she bends her head down and says, and I asked the mother, "What's wrong?" She says, "She has pain. &gt;&gt; That's why I don't play." Amen. &gt;&gt; The devil should not be able to do that. &gt;&gt; We have been given the tools &gt;&gt; and we've been praying &gt;&gt; rather than building &gt;&gt; because to dismantle to dismantle unbelief is to build faith. &gt;&gt; You can't get rid of unbelief and not building something. &gt;&gt; You mean to tell me you come to church and you don't even know what your what your purpose is, what God called you for? God didn't call us for us to get blows. God call us for us to get blows to be conquerors. We have a plan. We have a purpose. He's right there. Willing us sending the message over and over. What is the message doing to you? &gt;&gt; That word is supposed to build you in what? The stature of what? &gt;&gt; The perfect man. Where's the man? Amen. &gt;&gt; Where is the woman? &gt;&gt; Listen, do you know why the rapture ain't come yet? &gt;&gt; Don't blame God. &gt;&gt; We are late. &gt;&gt; Because him not willing that any should perish. He sees that many of us and you live in a place I I don't know about you, but I feel sorry for you because Trinidad have everything. My daughter just come for a week. She said, "D, I want to stay." And of course, you know who's spending and one this and oh wow I can stay here and I'm like checking the days but we only have another week and I'm like how do you do it you have the world at your fingertips life and the things of life pride of life lust of the flesh lust of the things &gt;&gt; and you think it's great but it's more dangerous &gt;&gt; because you you have no idea when you know I don't want to go off track. When Jesus met that rich rangula, that rich rang ruler did not go to Jesus because he wasting time. He go to Jesus because he have everything right on that side and he want to fix your life now. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? And Jesus said, well, you know the the law. He said, I have obeyed all 10 &gt;&gt; from my youth. &gt;&gt; All 10. &gt;&gt; And Jesus looked at him and said he loved him. &gt;&gt; Hello. Now, we want to see if it's true. And you're going to get a test now. You ready, honey? Go. Go. &gt;&gt; Wait, wait, wait, wait. Is he saying go? &gt;&gt; Go where? &gt;&gt; You know how long I take to build that? Do you know why my balance in my count is? Do you know what I have done to have that? I sleepless nights. Working double shift. &gt;&gt; Working real hard. Some days I ain't eating. My stomach on fire. I have reflex. &gt;&gt; And what you saying? Go. &gt;&gt; Wait, wait, wait. Did he say go? What's the other one? And what? &gt;&gt; Okay. Okay, Lord. I could do a portion. I could sell a portion, but you can't let me sell this. Come on. You know how my father gave me that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I can't give up all that. Please go easy. For goodness sake, go easy. Ease up. Jesus didn't ease up. He said, "Go and sell all &gt;&gt; that you have accumulated. &gt;&gt; You want eternal life &gt;&gt; or you're just talking. &gt;&gt; It's easy to obey the law. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, sin is not, oh, don't shall not do this and don't shall not do that." It's them things that I can't see like malice &gt;&gt; and hate. &gt;&gt; You could have hate and I would never know. &gt;&gt; Grinding it, sucking it away and you're there and God bless brother and I would never know how powerful that is. Because why? You were designed like that. &gt;&gt; When we came to this world, we came as hybrid &gt;&gt; in the garden. spoken word is the original seed hybrid. &gt;&gt; You know what hybrid means? You have a lot of cars here and the name hybrid. And you even realize we live in the message &gt;&gt; and all of us want hybrid. &gt;&gt; Nobody want the original old condom or the old the original thing where you turn the key. That's arcade. You're not with the times. &gt;&gt; Did you hear? No. Some of you might get offended, but it's all right. I'm only here for a week. But these are the things when I came to God, when God arrested me, I had what you call a Honda Integra, the first one in Grenada. I was working in the bank. So they had a big show and I'm driving this fancy car. And when I came to God, the Holy Spirit asked me, "Which one you put in front, the car or God?" &gt;&gt; I sold it. I had to prove that that car is not more important to me than my faith. &gt;&gt; I got rid of it. &gt;&gt; So I got another one and I'm there. And when I'm going into it, one of the guys says, "So Tim, you're going to live in that." I put car before house. You know when you're young, he says, "You're going to live in that." I changed my mind on car. So car now is just transportation. I can't live in it. What happened to it? They dismantled my ideas, &gt;&gt; destroyed it, &gt;&gt; and I'm saying to you, what do you have that is not beneficial to your soul, to your destiny? We getting older, not younger. You're getting pains that you never had before. And on top of that, with unbelief, how you going to get well? &gt;&gt; Don't you see what's happening? &gt;&gt; And we are going down the road. held bell and nobody checking. Do I have what it takes? Yes, the word have what it takes. &gt;&gt; The word has been given it to us. But for us, church became a transaction. &gt;&gt; You ever heard about a transaction where I buy, you sell. &gt;&gt; So it's a transaction. God, you give me peace, I give you part of my life. &gt;&gt; Just enough, &gt;&gt; not too much. cuz I want a little nice things. I want a little I want to be able to listen to a little calypso now and then. I want to be be able to listen to, you know, some of this what we call regular music. I mean, not because you save your stupid. So, we still have some of the old taste that we not giving up. &gt;&gt; We are still some of them old things and the little steel bar and so on. &gt;&gt; And we like a little function where the world is. No, as I said before, me ain't worrying about you because brother know I only here for a week. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But my job is to help you recognize that time is running out. &gt;&gt; And you need to know God. You need to be certain of God. &gt;&gt; You cannot be committed. Look at look at the amount of people on a holiday in Grenada. When it's holiday, it didn't make a difference. &gt;&gt; The whole church comes. &gt;&gt; You know why? cuz everybody's concerned and everybody's praying and when you pray you get into the inner veil and when you get into the inner veil you realize I may not be in where I thought I was. Paul himself said I must be careful. &gt;&gt; When I think I'm already in &gt;&gt; and I'm not. &gt;&gt; I'm not unsaving you know because if you're unsaving means you're unsaved. Amen. &gt;&gt; What I'm trying to do is to get you to hook dismantle unbelief which is the greatest scourge in the message. &gt;&gt; We have a lot a lot of people but very few believers. &gt;&gt; They come in by their turns on the on the and the the droves. I was standing by a place today in my massi and a lady was there nice long dress and a man is coming. She say, "God bless." So me, you know, in Grenada, you hear God bless that message. So I said, "How she saying God?" That must be your message believer. So I say, "Hi, are are you a believer?" She said, "Yes." I said, "What you chose?" And then I see her pastor. She said, "I'm a pastor." And that man is coming with a red shoes, a red pants, and a red everything red. So media had to ask about if his message again because what coming there is not a man. Not long after the people came that were with her one of her pants I say hey everybody saying God bless now any let me move on I ain't have much time on this holiday I don't want you to &gt;&gt; run out while I'm preaching so here's what this this says each one of us this day is possessed with one of the other &gt;&gt; Amen is a horrible thing and Jesus in his teaching upgraded them because of their unbelief. You know what upgrade means? Forcefully. You have to understand we preach as soft. When you're dealing with Jesus, you either come straight or don't come. &gt;&gt; He didn't play around. He empty your whole church. 70 evangelists, preachers, popes, they left because he deliberately said, "Eat my flesh. Drink my blood." because he knew from the beginning &gt;&gt; they had unbelief. &gt;&gt; I wonder if you're hearing me. &gt;&gt; So when they were gone who does he personally choose remember he choose the same but it's not like choose like he went and look for that one here and he went and look for that one. He didn't go and look them come and look for him. &gt;&gt; And when they came, you say, "Okay, y'all want to be part of the program, right?" And he send them out two by two. And they were casting out devils. Devils casting out devils. &gt;&gt; Hello. Why is that possible? Because he had given them power. &gt;&gt; And the devil must understand who in charge. They had authority. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? They were given the authority and they were doing it. And they were glad. There are some things going on now in the world. It's crazy. &gt;&gt; Here is this woman. I I mean these days people just stand up. You go in a church and they speak in tongue, not tongue, something. And they run it and I'm like, what is in the world is going on? So here is this woman and she's running it and the man says uh anybody here to speak just pray in tonesues. And she raised her hand. He said come. And he gave her the mic. He said let me hear you pray in tones. And she went look and she make cheating and when he done he said now tell them what you just say. She couldn't even say the first word. He said now watch me. Go on. Sit down. Stop that nonsense and stop distripping us. Don't do that again. &gt;&gt; She never ever will speak. All I'm trying to show you is what unbelief is &gt;&gt; and there silently creeping along &gt;&gt; being your passenger being with you. Why? Because you're not growing. If you grow, it means faith is victorious. &gt;&gt; We need to be higher than where we are. &gt;&gt; This place should be on fire. People all over the place. Why? We have an opportunity. People are saying the rapture is today. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Look behind you. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you something. Even if you see the dead raised here, it wouldn't change you. &gt;&gt; It will not even change you. By tomorrow, you're back in number one. &gt;&gt; And I have seen that with my own eyes. Brother near in debt. Custing all the time. He didn't the message. You always had to go and help him repair damage. always repairing damage that he did with his mouth. &gt;&gt; He's dying. We send the brothers and he's still crawling dying. &gt;&gt; Death don't change you. &gt;&gt; Death don't take away your anger. Death don't take away your bitterness. Death don't take away the way you are. &gt;&gt; That's why you must &gt;&gt; be born again. &gt;&gt; And we take that and we make it simple. It's like, well, well, you know, I'm born again. are baptized. Born again means not the same person. &gt;&gt; A new creation, &gt;&gt; a new generation, a regeneration of what it was. &gt;&gt; Not the same car with a different paint. And many of us could be faithful and Christians here. Can I come to your home &gt;&gt; and be invisible and hear the husbands and wife &gt;&gt; and let me move on. I know &gt;&gt; let me go on because that is coming real regular now &gt;&gt; and people get so custom in living in the message that they ain't even watching the life &gt;&gt; and pastors are not preaching about it because they're going to lose ching ching. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. But I know you're not like that. So I could afford to make that comment here. But y churches, I can't say that. &gt;&gt; Let's go now. He upraded them that they should not have done a particular thing. And he also chided Sidon and Capanium which were exalted up into heaven shall be brought down to hell. For if the mighty works, hear it. Mighty works had been done in you as to Solomon Gomorrah and the other cities. If the mighty works had in Solomon Gomorrah had been done in Capalonium, it would have been standing today. &gt;&gt; Hello. Hello. So why wasn't Solomon Gomorrah standing? They had an angel. They had a message of God and they failed to receive it. And today Solomon Gomorrah lies in the bottom of the sea. That's the result of unbelief. I am your friend, not your enemy. I am here to tell you, wake up. &gt;&gt; Believe. Be certain of God. &gt;&gt; Stop the games. &gt;&gt; Be real. &gt;&gt; If you can't find it, stay here. Do what I do. Do I'll stay here. I ain't leaving. So help me, God. Life too serious. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Don't be spoiled. Do you know easy living means no victory? &gt;&gt; You know that &gt;&gt; it's only when a man face trials and hardness that he calls God. &gt;&gt; People don't want God because they all are right. &gt;&gt; And worshiping God is connected to need. &gt;&gt; If you don't have a need, you in pray. If everything going f well you see the rich as they get the richer they get the less they pray &gt;&gt; and pray is your power &gt;&gt; the power in a church is prayer &gt;&gt; you could listen to all the message in the world and you don't want to talk to God you think God going to say all right I could I could ease you up &gt;&gt; God made me to talk to him God made you to talk to him to spend time on Gre's knees But we don't want that. We want it easy. You pray for me. You pray for me. You do my religion. It ain't going to happen in the message. We are not Roman Catholics. &gt;&gt; We don't burn candle. We don't say or whatever they just say and roll bead. &gt;&gt; We don't pray for the dead. [Applause] I have never heard William Brandon preach a message and at the end he's not crying &gt;&gt; or saying &gt;&gt; what's wrong with us. &gt;&gt; You have the greatest message that ever hit this earth and we treat it as if it is a Roman dogma. &gt;&gt; Not because them men and they mess it up it means wrong something wrong with it. Don't watch them men. They will always have. &gt;&gt; You don't see fellas pelting mango that green. &gt;&gt; You go after something that's good. &gt;&gt; So there's something in the message that the devil trying to blind to blindfold to sabotage to wreck. &gt;&gt; And we are depending God is dependent on you. You you you the little ones the little bride. Little boy, little men, are you hearing me? Who knows what it is to be born again. &gt;&gt; Being born again is not words. &gt;&gt; I just had a grandson, first one out of five children, and the last shall be first. The last boy give me a grandson. And you know how much thing they had to do for that boy, that boy to born. And every day my little daughter come, watch your picture. Watch your picture. Watch your picture. Me want to see the picture when he's in the belly. I want to see the picture when he's up. &gt;&gt; Because I live so long, you know, longer than them, they are excited. Come on, feel it. Come on, feel it. You know many children died in the belly. Do you know many people in church die as church members &gt;&gt; until you are born &gt;&gt; until you are born? &gt;&gt; You're not inside. &gt;&gt; The new birth is a must. &gt;&gt; It's not a suggestion. &gt;&gt; It's not something you well if you don't mind. He told Nicodemus, you must verily &gt;&gt; and our prophet says without the new but we perish. Those are not just words. These are truths. &gt;&gt; William Mar and Brennham when he came into the message and he had a little hookup about it. How many died? You said we none die by me because you don't know who you are. The devil ain't taking none because you're already his. &gt;&gt; The devil has only interfere with what is not his. &gt;&gt; Why would I go after something that I have? &gt;&gt; And he is number one in greed and envy. &gt;&gt; So what he is a thief? You don't thief your own thing. &gt;&gt; You don't thiefs. Hey, I just th some mang who the tree for mine. That make sense? They should arrest you for lying. You can't keep what it's yours. &gt;&gt; And the devil only goes after lambs, sheep, &gt;&gt; people who come to the house of God with a claim. &gt;&gt; With a desire, &gt;&gt; but how strong is a desire? I told Labarie, love is not enough these days. &gt;&gt; I love you, darling. It's not enough. &gt;&gt; Help me wash the ways. Help me sweep the at the house. &gt;&gt; Come with me. Let's go and shop. &gt;&gt; The love that we have is Go ahead. &gt;&gt; Here's the money. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Gone. Gone. Gone. &gt;&gt; Though love is together. &gt;&gt; We walk together. We talk together. We love together. We embrace together. We shout together. We praise together. Do you love him? Prove that love. Saying your love is not enough. &gt;&gt; What about when the wife reach menopause and she pause &gt;&gt; and you last you get a hug and then your mother man you expect man to make it. You don't understand this thing. He's a human too and I have feelings. Amen. &gt;&gt; Get those feelings born again. &gt;&gt; I ain't asking you. I'm telling you. Been there. Experience it. And until that old nature is gone, your eye long. &gt;&gt; Male as well as female. Don't Don't take away the female. You know them more deadly. &gt;&gt; Don't think well it's a sister. She have no bad thoughts. Let me go on. And these are what the attributes of what? &gt;&gt; Unbelief. I'm saying to you, unbelief is a pandemic. &gt;&gt; Actually, it's a endemic. &gt;&gt; I don't know which one is worse. Brother Isaac know more about these things. I don't know which one is. All I know is a mick &gt;&gt; and it bad. And I am st &gt;&gt; this message I love. And when I see what they're doing with it, shooting it down, pulling it here, pulling it there, destroying people, and they have people onto them as if them is God. &gt;&gt; Oh, God. &gt;&gt; You mean people that can't even read you a man, it's more important for you to please a man &gt;&gt; when the when the word is God? Since when if my if I'm your pastor and I'm going wrong, leave me. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; No, pastors don't fear that. They're afraid to say that tonight. &gt;&gt; But real man of God is not afraid &gt;&gt; because he is fixed. Faith is fixed. Faith is settled. Faith don't move left nor move right. You don't care who coming, who not coming. As long as you please God, that's all. [Music] You're there on the bus, you go. You're not on the bus, you left. [Applause] &gt;&gt; God begging you. &gt;&gt; We must beg him. &gt;&gt; So long in the message, still have that temper. &gt;&gt; What's wrong with you? &gt;&gt; And you're getting older. You think temper just get easier when you get older. &gt;&gt; It get more complicated. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's harder to deal with &gt;&gt; because now you in your system and that what have you sick &gt;&gt; before you know you say brother Tim I nervous you know you're nervous that thing inside there that rage &gt;&gt; use your mother child until you become a son of God or a daughter of God you are your mother's child you are your father's daughter &gt;&gt; and the seed of the father is in you until you become a son of God, until you become a daughter of God, until you are born again. &gt;&gt; DNA is no joke. &gt;&gt; People look at me say, "Boy, you look like your father." But it's better for me to say, "Boy, you're doing like your father." &gt;&gt; And he says, "Me and my father are one. I want to do like he did. He brought me a word. He brought me a life so that I can be like him. And then we have the belly to say God come and live in me. Where? &gt;&gt; Where? In that rage. &gt;&gt; In that in condition when Matthew 5 is the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; You ever pray for your enemies? Well, send them a gift. Amen. &gt;&gt; You said except your righteousness exceed what? &gt;&gt; The righteousness of what? The rich young ruler. &gt;&gt; You cannot &gt;&gt; enter into the kingdom of heaven. And we have come to a place where everybody want a nice soft message. Go easy. It's for your own harm. &gt;&gt; You cannot if brother I heard brother Isaac preach a message. It takes perfect love &gt;&gt; to enter there. What do you think is perfect love? Biting, snarling, leave me alone before I put on my salvation. That's perfect love. If you want to know is perfect love and brother Brennham said it and up to now I I'm not connected. Not not that I'm not connected but I hope I not to do that. You say if you love this lady and this man love her more and you have the love of God in your heart, he'll tell her look go with him. &gt;&gt; Put up your say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There were a lot of thing in this message we only watching &gt;&gt; but it is there to live. &gt;&gt; Them that honor me, &gt;&gt; I will honor them. Let me move on. &gt;&gt; Oh God, how much time I have to Jesus? &gt;&gt; All right. All right. At least nobody gone yet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So Jesus had just been called Beelub. &gt;&gt; Hear that? Before somebody give you a nickname or something, you're upset. They call him Belug and he turn back. He's not be them. They calling you use that. So why you bothering you? &gt;&gt; Oh, I was going to the bread and shake hand and just turn away. So what? Shake somebody else on. &gt;&gt; Why you had to make that a problem? &gt;&gt; I don't know what I doing. And then you go there and the devil say yes I catch one. &gt;&gt; Everything the devil drop, you're taking it up. What wrong with you? You're a garbage pickup. Every foolish thing he dropped. Oh, well, you know, brother, so what wrong with you? Why you come to church? Well, you know, I was planning to come. But I understand this, brother. Say this and Oh my God. &gt;&gt; If he was living in the days of the tree, right? Those three Hebrew boys, what you do when everybody was against them and their faith remained steadfast &gt;&gt; and they said, "We will not defile ourselves with the king's meat." &gt;&gt; These men and the Holy Ghost was not yet given They just raw love. &gt;&gt; Many things that we say we can do, we could do it to just roll off &gt;&gt; because feel love have some power. &gt;&gt; A gap is what bends the corner. &gt;&gt; Let's go. &gt;&gt; So could you imagine the prophet said who was the prince of the devils and because that he was able to discern the thoughts of the people. telling them where they had been and what they had done. They said he was an evil spirit. So I'm your brother as long as you ain't tell me nothing bad. &gt;&gt; God help me &gt;&gt; the day that happened. Then tell yourself, uh, I got dementia. &gt;&gt; I will lay the same word down as when Paul &gt;&gt; regardless. And I know according to the word, he going to get less. Amen. &gt;&gt; When I was telling the message said 12 right now, how much you saying? &gt;&gt; Let's go. &gt;&gt; Could you imagine men and women who had sat under the reading of the scripture through the years and had the great schools of spirit and would be and would be in a shape till they would see such as that and nail it down to a devil working when in the scripture had plainly quoted that's what it will be. And they were so took up in their dogmas until they failed to recognize him. And that's what's happened in the message. We fail to recognize the presence of God. &gt;&gt; And many times the Holy Ghost would come down and pay the place, but we busy and we going and God said, "Don't worry." Amen. &gt;&gt; Many times I'm finished preaching and I can feel the anointing dropping down and those when they're not ready the whole place flooded and everybody on the floor &gt;&gt; and then there'll be other times you could see the tension they want to go and God gone. &gt;&gt; It was starting but it gone &gt;&gt; and you could switch off God like that &gt;&gt; because you don't have a prayer life and you don't even know when he comes. Could you imagine you worshiping God for the last 20 years and you don't even know when he come &gt;&gt; and you said God is my father and God is the one I love and you're willing to to say all kind of thing and fight &gt;&gt; and you don't know him. &gt;&gt; You need help to stand up in your faith. &gt;&gt; I don't need no help. &gt;&gt; I don't care if it's me alone. &gt;&gt; I will stand with it. So help me God. Until you have an experience with God, you are nothing. Nothing. &gt;&gt; You're just a church member. &gt;&gt; Jesus, you know what Jesus says? In vain, they have what? A form. &gt;&gt; I don't want no form. &gt;&gt; You know what form means? They know what to say. Amen. They know to shake your hand. And they know how to do these forms. Where's the power to live above? Where's the power to tell unbelief scatter, dismantle? [Applause] &gt;&gt; Where's the power? Listen, the spirit in you have more power over your body. Then why you allow your body to rule the spirit? &gt;&gt; Why allow your temper to rule your inside? And then go and say you see why you cause cause what? &gt;&gt; You do your own thing for yourself and blaming me. You need help. &gt;&gt; Don't blame me for what you're doing. &gt;&gt; Take the responsibility and recognize you need the new breath. &gt;&gt; You need faith. &gt;&gt; When a man of faith, he can't lose it. &gt;&gt; Faith is settled. &gt;&gt; It's a substance. You know what substance means? &gt;&gt; Substance mean is a living thing. You know what the Holy Spirit was showing me? He said unbelief is a devil and the substance that we call faith is the spirit of God &gt;&gt; is real. &gt;&gt; And if it's substance and is invisible, what else could it be? &gt;&gt; It's invisible. Have you ever seen it? But you have seen the works. You've seen the action. Faith is a action thing. &gt;&gt; That's why you have works with faith. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when you say I believe the message and you keep coming, then God will cause something to happen in your home to see if you will still come. &gt;&gt; Well, let me tell you when time for church &gt;&gt; and my car break down. I'll walk. &gt;&gt; I'll walk. &gt;&gt; God will give me a ride. &gt;&gt; You say, "Bro, what if you're living in town and you going grande?" I don't care. &gt;&gt; Before they make God make foot When I when it comes to my God, nothing &gt;&gt; comes between me and him. &gt;&gt; When I was dying, he helped me. When I was down, he picked me up. When I was lost, he saved me. And what am I doing? &gt;&gt; I am not ungrateful. &gt;&gt; 10 lepers come to Jesus. And leprosy is a form of spiritual darkness. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? It's on the flesh and it's on the soul. &gt;&gt; And they came and they said, "We want to get delivered." &gt;&gt; And Jesus watched them. He could have touched them. &gt;&gt; But these were different &gt;&gt; because they had nine denominational and one believer &gt;&gt; and he didn't want to make the denominational fellas feel bad for the believer he saw. &gt;&gt; So he said, "Go and show yourself to the priest." action and on the way &gt;&gt; on the way &gt;&gt; on the way &gt;&gt; all of them skin clean &gt;&gt; what happened nine was Grenadians didn't go back your country they not one &gt;&gt; went back &gt;&gt; and say thank you do you know why &gt;&gt; one time I was preaching and the Holy Spirit showed me because the nine got back the leprosy. &gt;&gt; Cuz when the unclean spirit leave a person, it ain't gone. &gt;&gt; It's a clean. &gt;&gt; Let's move on. &gt;&gt; So he said that would be such as that and nail it down. Okay. So God in all the ages has walked through men and the reason that they didn't believe him is because he was doing these great works of God. He had been a man. But it pleased God to manifest himself through his subjects. For God is a spirit. And God was manifesting himself through his son, the Lord Jesus. And they was trying to say that he made himself God. And they were ready to stone him. &gt;&gt; You hear? Who want to stone him? Who get healing? Who eat a lot of bread and fish? Who eat a lot of things from him? Cuz your Bible said they chase him. They went looking for him. And he said, "I know why you're coming." We all also have to ask ourselves why we coming cuz people just go in church and hide &gt;&gt; cuz people just tell him what happened to you. Well, something do with me some maybe they do me or some mal take me and they say well baptize. So people baptize and they say you going church. Yeah. Going still. &gt;&gt; Where's the change? Where's the power? Well, you know how it is. &gt;&gt; I ain't too agree with everything they're saying. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; People have their own quiet things, &gt;&gt; intricacies, &gt;&gt; widens fully when &gt;&gt; you know it's the best of the rest. &gt;&gt; Old Pharisee, &gt;&gt; you you have the right to say wise best and wise rest. Since you don't understand why I preach it to be you. But if it's for you then you know if the cap fit &gt;&gt; I don't play. &gt;&gt; God don't play. &gt;&gt; And you should not play. [Applause] &gt;&gt; So God where am I? So him being a man could do those things. And the world hasn't changed too much. It's still hard for people to see that God is a spirit that works through men. He did it through Moses, Elijah, Noah, Enoch, and Jonah. Now, faith is not an emotion. It's not a sensation, but a substance, and it comes by hearing. So, it comes with an experience. &gt;&gt; It is not a mental conception. It is not a myth. It is not something mysterious. It's something you possess. &gt;&gt; All right? &gt;&gt; Buckle up. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If it is something you possess and it's something real, can you honestly I want you to speak to yourself inside. Do I have that? &gt;&gt; I want you to question yourself. Do I have this substance? Is it so real in me? Because when it is real in you and it is there, you obey it. &gt;&gt; You don't question it. You don't reason it. You just obey &gt;&gt; cuz faith is spirit. And spirit, there's only one spirit that's connected with faith. If faith cometh by hearing God and God is the word &gt;&gt; and God is a spirit. &gt;&gt; So faith is spirit. &gt;&gt; Spirit is substance. You must know if you have a spirit in you. &gt;&gt; Hey, &gt;&gt; that's why we say not by might, &gt;&gt; not by power. That's what pushes me. That's what pushes brother Isaac. That's what pushes preachers to keep going in spite of what the people do. &gt;&gt; But the people have a responsibility for that same spirit. What they do with it. &gt;&gt; Every time you hear that word, &gt;&gt; you have to give an account. &gt;&gt; Every day you hear of a message. Coming to church is good and forsaking not the assembling is better, but it comes with a price. &gt;&gt; Look at my hair. I have to forsake for go all physical ailments to bring the word to you. It's a price. &gt;&gt; I'm sure brother who is around my age have little ailments that he had to deal with too. &gt;&gt; And that many times I studying the word and pain. &gt;&gt; Does that stop me? &gt;&gt; No. I have a purpose. I have a plan. God, I must please. Amen. &gt;&gt; When I was in the world, who helped me? &gt;&gt; When I was heading for hell, who helped me? &gt;&gt; God sent Jesus died for you, &gt;&gt; suffer for you, &gt;&gt; go through all them thing for you. What is your response? &gt;&gt; You're in shame. &gt;&gt; What is our response? Are you self what do I call die to self so much that you would give him all &gt;&gt; he didn't hold back &gt;&gt; are you sold out &gt;&gt; lock stuck and barrel that if God say stop that you would give it up &gt;&gt; I don't like to do these things but the Lord have a way of dealing with me so if I go somewhere I shouldn't go he would send me a dream you shouldn't go there don't go there again &gt;&gt; no that's because of a prayer life I have I Don't you talk about me. I don't know about you. And I if I like God know it's not it's not a lie. &gt;&gt; And and and then when I when he says watch that then I watch it because why I am telling him I need his help &gt;&gt; because the road is dark. The road is deadly and Satan is like a roving lion. He's let me tell you and the closer you are to God is the more danger you face. &gt;&gt; There's no no game. Amen. &gt;&gt; When I stand here to preach the gospel and I come to pray for you to cast out devils. When that devil gone, he watches me. &gt;&gt; And if I'm not living right, he attacks. He comes. &gt;&gt; The only thing to keep him is the angel. &gt;&gt; You are coming here and you're serving God. And the angel of the Lord encamped what? &gt;&gt; Round about now. When last check to see if the angel there, &gt;&gt; is he with you? He ain't camping. &gt;&gt; Where is the fear? &gt;&gt; He asked that question. Where is my fear? &gt;&gt; People of of uh Headstone Tabernacle, don't get to the point where you get too big. &gt;&gt; Stay humble. &gt;&gt; You have a wonderful, wonderful minister. &gt;&gt; Support it. &gt;&gt; There are few like that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it not getting better. You know what I asked my church? God forbid that he tries and we gone. And Isaac had to carry the burden. I wonder who gone to get quiet. So what happened? I done ain't done yet. How many here because of brother or how many here because of God? &gt;&gt; I think I'm going too far inside there. Okay. Yeah. Some parts in the house you can't go. So let me go back. But I usually preach by inspiration. As the Lord revealed it, I speak it. Any let me continue as I come to a close. He said, "Now it is the evidence of things hoped for. You do not have it as yet, but you have the authority of God to say that you have it." &gt;&gt; You hear that? &gt;&gt; You have the authority of God to say that you have it. I saw that child in the chair and I said, "Lord, what can I do?" And he said, "You have the word." &gt;&gt; And I ain't reached there yet, but I can tell you something. If that child don't get healed, then the church bears the responsibility. Because one sin unconfessed &gt;&gt; can cause that child not to be healed. &gt;&gt; One person can make the church fail &gt;&gt; pitily. &gt;&gt; And God, brother Brenham said at the day of judgment, you will be called to give an account. &gt;&gt; You come in here, we don't confess sin, have a little boyfriend on the side or have a little girlfriend on the side and nobody don't know. You think God seen it? Hey, married, but yet you're having conversations in work or wherever you're going. That shouldn't be &gt;&gt; those things don't go. So, &gt;&gt; it's being looked at. It affects the growth and perfection and power in the church. Satan loves that. &gt;&gt; So, we would come with all the faith and you ain't have, you know what happened? We had to go back home. &gt;&gt; It takes two, &gt;&gt; brother. all the faith. If you ain't in half, it won't happen. That's why he don't follow the people. He follow the light &gt;&gt; where the faith is. &gt;&gt; And all of us have the ability to pull the light. &gt;&gt; But the light comes with sincerity. It comes with &gt;&gt; genuiness. &gt;&gt; Back home in Grenada, I was preaching about this message and people owing God in tithes. I don't know what y'all doing in Trinidad. talking about Gree and people just owe God. &gt;&gt; Oh, you could owe God when first fruit is. &gt;&gt; No, I'm telling you. Gay that. So, don't say I come here and preach tight. &gt;&gt; Gate that because you ain't supposed to be doing that because you're making good money. As I ask the question, as I tell you, I like to observe. I ask what is it? What is it like in Trinidad? Oh, plentiful. Nice. My daughter want to come to whom much is given. Notice anytime you go in a church and you say money the place gone dead quiet brother. You could talk about this, talk about adultery, talk about this, talk about all kind of thing. Wearing bands cussing all thing. You say money. Ouch. Don't go there. &gt;&gt; That is sacrosant. &gt;&gt; I'm saying where created the point I'm making is if you could rob God in tight, what else will you rob him in? &gt;&gt; Because when you start, it takes a kind of unbelief to make that move. Especially when you know you're wrong &gt;&gt; and you're you're riding over it. Now remember g help me ga and especially when you know you're wrong and you're riding over it and you kind of let her pass but you pass in your conscience &gt;&gt; and what you do you deaden it. What's doing that? Unbelief &gt;&gt; and you ain't even worrying that God give you a 100 and all he aifi is 10 cents. &gt;&gt; You ain't watching that. What you watching the 90? That's all I left with a bills to pay, rent to pay. What we talking greater? Because your face getting frightened. [Music] Smile. So I know it's not you, not a dealer. You get the picture. But the point is if you could do that and I'm not talking about little people or big people, deacons, trustees. In fact, the more the people who make the more &gt;&gt; guilty of that the most. &gt;&gt; It's too much. &gt;&gt; And God say I proven in that just that. And you break that. You know what is the next thing you'll be telling me? There'll be must be something else. Cuz if you could make that move there, where else? Now why am I doing dismantling unbelief? What is the biggest problem in the church today? Unbelief. It plaguing it pulling down people. It takes away the strength of the church. When the church should be vibrant, &gt;&gt; you have enough. I hear message pass you here. Each one of you should be a prayer warrior healing people all over the place. &gt;&gt; The level of message pass here. &gt;&gt; So it ask I have to ask one question. What have you done &gt;&gt; with Jesus &gt;&gt; called Christ? Cuz if you take the word, you become the word. And if you become the word, no sickness should walk through that door. &gt;&gt; No condition should walk through that door. Because why? These signs shall follow where there is no unbelief. &gt;&gt; So we all a brother's keeper. We all have the right and we all have the responsibility to have that faith. That's why in the book of acts what happened &gt;&gt; a thin believer came in &gt;&gt; who owe tithes from the sale of the land ga smile please smile I could talk about my country and they said this is what we get now remember Peter no thy god in Peter. Peter can't kill people. &gt;&gt; He don't have the belly. &gt;&gt; God can kill. &gt;&gt; And God &gt;&gt; took her down &gt;&gt; without forgive me. &gt;&gt; Without I'm sorry. Without Please give man another chance &gt;&gt; one time. For the sin was in the heart, &gt;&gt; not the mouth. &gt;&gt; Not long, notice how they just go to church over there. About an hour after they're still in church, you going home already. The wife come that time. You going home long time cuz you can't stay long in church. You had to go and do your thing and make a dollar or whatever and eat your doubles and so on. And Peter ask him nothing less. She asks and nothing less. Come, come, come, come, come. We here waiting on you. The whole church waiting on you and she want to walk. Everybody so sad. We just bury your husband. Tell me your turn. Now how much you sell the land for? You know that foolish lady lie to &gt;&gt; she ain't even have I thought the woman supposed to have some intuition to tell she said something ain't right. She lie. She say yes for so much. He said, "Well, them people who just bury your husband will take you out." &gt;&gt; Do you remember brother Brandham had the chance to do it and he couldn't do it &gt;&gt; because the angel tell him you did the right thing. &gt;&gt; Who killed them? &gt;&gt; Who killed them? These things are written for what? &gt;&gt; For what? &gt;&gt; And you know why nothing happened to us yet? Those who are praying &gt;&gt; bringing grace. Amen. &gt;&gt; Those who are believers bringing grace. You say understand Abraham &gt;&gt; brought grace to a backsliden nephew. &gt;&gt; The nephew had nothing &gt;&gt; left to the nephew alone. He dead. Abraham beg. &gt;&gt; Do you know who the 50 was? 50 of Lot family. &gt;&gt; He knew that was Sodom. He's a prophet. He knew he had nobody down there. &gt;&gt; So who he was begging for? Lot and his family. Because Lot went in there really harang on them &gt;&gt; and the 50 of them. So he said, "What about 45 and God going down here, &gt;&gt; you reach 10 and you make one final thing." He say, "I don't want to get you vexed, but permit me to say one final time before I get in trouble. Would you do it for five? &gt;&gt; Saints, tell me something. This boy grew up with Abraham praying, reading the Bible and everything. He gone down in that place and in no time at all, everybody backslide. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Unbeliev them. &gt;&gt; And the only reason why they coming out is because of what? The righteousness of who? &gt;&gt; Abraham. So the righteousness of one or two &gt;&gt; will stand in the gap for the many &gt;&gt; pray God the rapture come and you ain't gone cuz all of that is over &gt;&gt; a closing we continue Sunday because we're not talking this thing we looking real serious and I really ain't want to take licks yet wait until Sunday I close him with in Grenada. Where? Grenada. We had a situation in the church because we are very serious. &gt;&gt; No games. And there was a brother and a sister who were living in sin. I didn't know. The church did not know. And the night after studying, God gave me a dream. And as always get them dreams around five. And in the dream, I saw two great big black snake in the building. One inside hiding and the other one trying to come out huge. And I said, "There's something God is warning me about." &gt;&gt; So I went to the church and in the preaching we found it out. When the service was over and I finished preach, a young sister walked in in my office shedding tears, balling, &gt;&gt; she was living in fornication. Choir member, &gt;&gt; you hear this choir member. I didn't know God knew. And she came. And the other one was a highlevel member who while I preaching walk out on God not once, not twice, not three times. &gt;&gt; And I spoke to him. I said, "You can't do that." And when he walking out, things went bad and he went south. We sent the brothers to pray, see if he come back. He sent her confession when I read it. I said, "But there are no place in this confession where he say he's sorry and he wouldn't do it again." So I said, "Brother, I I want to help you, but you had to put something in there to show that you mean business &gt;&gt; action. You didn't do it. You wait, he wait, he waits, please." And then the Holy Spirit tell me that man is not going to do it. So after we give him a month, I went back and checked the prophet and I see where the prophet said, "You have a month and then do what you got to do." And right in the front of the church in the Sunday morning, we released the body to the devil that the soul might be saved. No, I'm just telling you about Ga. Guess what happened? It changed the church. &gt;&gt; People in plane, everybody serious. The whole church prays. The whole church to a man &gt;&gt; and they don't stay home. No service holiday or not. &gt;&gt; Is that me? No. When you begin to get serious with God, God begins to get serious with you. And I'm saying to you, this is we're going to stop here because I think we need to stop to go back on Sunday when we'll continue cuz I can feel the pull. If he has spoken to you this evening, don't leave as you came. &gt;&gt; The time is finished. &gt;&gt; We don't have more time. &gt;&gt; It is punto fin. &gt;&gt; It's over. Are you hearing me? The little bit of God you have in now to pull you is going to soon disappear and then the bride will have a revival quick short work. &gt;&gt; At that time you can't come. &gt;&gt; At that time you can't confess. &gt;&gt; At that time it's pass. &gt;&gt; It will be only a manifestation for the inside. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz you now have your upper room experience &gt;&gt; where the Holy Ghost takes over. &gt;&gt; Why? Because whatever he is, we must rise. The prophet said we have to lift ourselves because what we have now can do it. What you think bring the lift? Conditions &gt;&gt; the situation. And I am feeling it. The more I pray is the more I feel that darkness and people are just going through the motion and soon they will just like a truck that run out of gas tired. Can't keep going. They're losing whatever they had. Why? They did not had an experience with God to get the baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; We can't keep saying that forever. Everything have time. &gt;&gt; Everything. Even our service have a time &gt;&gt; to start and a time to end. Then why wouldn't God have a time &gt;&gt; for you &gt;&gt; and for your life? You can't keep playing with your soul. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? The most important asset you have is your soul. And hear me? You can't blame God. He says you have a choice. &gt;&gt; Nobody is without excuse. You are inexcusable. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh man, &gt;&gt; woman, &gt;&gt; don't blame nobody. &gt;&gt; When everything is finished, you are the one to kneel there and talk to God. When everything is finished, you are the one to skate with your temper, with your malice, and whatever it is, you don't want to get rid of it. &gt;&gt; You &gt;&gt; cause an individual affair, &gt;&gt; not your pastor. You &gt;&gt; I to get to business with God. &gt;&gt; There's no time for playing. &gt;&gt; Yes, boy. Before revival could start, there has to be a purge and there has to be a cleaning. And we cannot take it for granted that all is well until we go down in the bottom. That's where Gideon was before God came. He was down in the well, hiding, starving, barely surviving. And the angel said, "Oh, mighty man of God." And he shocked. He said, "Me mighty hiding down here." There is a power in the church. And the devil know that more than all of us. But I'm here to tell you, wake up. Arise and shine. Do what you have to do or whatever that is. Get right with God. Be certain of God. Whenever you make a vow, you say anything, mean it or don't say it. Then God will start hearing your prayer. Then God will start drawing near. Then you'll start getting a purpose in your life. Cuz this is not a myth. This is not talking. This is real. Faith is real. And before I leave, I would like to pray or see something happen for the sick. Oh, where's the brother that is sing? My sister, my daughter was telling me about his wife. I I I don't know. I have a problem. I just get compassion for people. And we God has given us the resources and the tools to pray these things out. But it begins with us as a church. It begins with you and I as individuals. A call to God. Dismantle unbelief. Run. Move from it. Don't play. May God bless you as we pray. Let's all stand. That song you sang, give me more. You all know it. You know it. Well, I want more. Could you come and sing it while we pray? Heavenly Father, I come to you this evening. Lord, I pray that somehow somebody will be touched. Lord, even if it's five, it will be worth it cuz that would be five changed individuals. I have asked you to help me and I've done just that. And I pray, oh God, you'll do the rest. I ask that you will change our desires and make them holy, change our thinking and make it right. Lord, there there are conditions here that has to be met. We can't go outside. We can't call the pope. We cannot call a priest. We have to call you. &gt;&gt; And therefore, we are praying, oh God, that you would intervene because it is your desire that we be well. &gt;&gt; It is your desire that we walk away, heal, delivered. It is your desire that we rejoice and be happy. It has never been your desire for us to suffer unnecessarily. And so let faith rise and build this evening and dismantle unbelief and let there be a purpose in the hearts of the people. Thank you for brother. I thank you for your servant. Not many are willing to stand with purpose and his mind fixed. I love that. Help us Lord. It's a very difficult time but it's in a very beautiful moment. Have your own now as I surrender them to you is my prayer in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen. I hope I put you in trouble but I love that song. [Music] Thank you Jesus. Oh, hallelujah. I know what it's like to be in the presence of the Lord. [Music] &gt;&gt; And not know what time it is. Because time stood still and bodies were healed and families restored &gt;&gt; because we stayed. here in the presence of the Lord. No one had to say a word. [Music] Couldn't even make a sound. But I give up everything for this treasure I found. [Laughter] [Music] I never wanted to end. Oh, so please stay. Stay, Lord. I don't want you to go cuz my heart is burning. Oh, for your presence, Lord. Oh, please stay. Stay. I don't want you to go. [Music] Oh, cuz my heart is burning. [Music] Yes, Lord. For your presence, Lord. I want more. I want more. Oh Jesus.
