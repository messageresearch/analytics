[25:07] you to turn to two portion scriptures
[25:08] tonight
[25:09] deuteronomy chapter eight and first
[25:12] corinthians chapter 9
[25:15] we want to read the whole chapter of
[25:17] deuteronomy chapter 8
[25:19] and we want to read first characters 9
[25:20] 24
[25:22] to 27 i think i i
[25:25] read that sometime before in the past
[25:29] this is deuteronomy chapter eight
[25:30] reading from verse one all the
[25:32] commandments which i command thee this d
[25:35] shall be observed to do that you may
[25:38] live
[25:39] and multiply and go in and possess the
[25:42] land
[25:43] which the lord sway unto your fathers
[25:46] and thou shall remember all the we
[25:48] which the lord thy god led thee these 40
[25:50] years
[25:51] in the wilderness to humble thee and to
[25:54] prove thee
[25:56] to know what was in thine heart whether
[25:58] thou would keep us
[26:00] his commandments or no
[26:03] and he humbled me and suffered into
[26:05] hunger feddy with manner which down you
[26:08] is not
[26:09] neither thy fathers know that he might
[26:12] make thee know
[26:13] that man shall not live by bread alone
[26:16] but by every word that proceedeth
[26:18] out of the mouth of the lord that man
[26:20] live
[26:22] the arraignment wax not all upon thee
[26:25] neither did thy foot swell these forty
[26:27] years
[26:28] thou shall also consider in thine heart
[26:31] that as a man chased
[26:32] at his son so the lord i got chastened
[26:36] at thee
[26:37] therefore thou shalt keep the
[26:39] commandments of the lord thy god to walk
[26:41] in his ways and to fear them
[26:43] for the lord i god bringeth thee into a
[26:45] good land
[26:46] a land of brooks of water fountains of
[26:48] depths and spring out of the valley
[26:50] and hills a land of wheat and barley and
[26:53] vines and fig trees and pomegranates a
[26:55] lot of oil honey
[26:57] olive on honey land where it though
[26:59] shall eat bread without scarceness
[27:02] though shall not lack anything in it a
[27:04] land whose stones are iron
[27:07] and out of whose hills thou mighters dig
[27:10] brass
[27:11] when thou has eaten are not full
[27:15] then thou shalt bless the lord thy god
[27:17] for the good land
[27:18] which he had given thee beware that thou
[27:21] forget not
[27:22] the lord thy god in not keeping his
[27:25] commandments
[27:26] and his judgments and his statutes which
[27:28] i commanded his day
[27:30] least when thou has eaten are not full
[27:35] and has built goodly houses and dwelt
[27:37] therein
[27:38] when thy hoods and eye flocks multiply
[27:41] and i silver and thy goal is
[27:43] multiplied and all that dou has is
[27:46] multiplied
[27:47] then thy heartbeat lifted up and thou
[27:50] forget the lord thy god which brought
[27:52] thee forth
[27:53] out of the land of egypt from the house
[27:55] of bondage
[27:56] who led thee through that great and
[27:58] terrible wilderness
[27:59] wherein were fair recipients and
[28:01] scorpions and drought
[28:02] where there was no water who brought
[28:04] default water out of the rock of flint
[28:07] who fed thee in the wilderness with
[28:08] manner which thy fathers knew not
[28:11] that he might humble thee that he might
[28:13] prove thee
[28:14] to do the good at thy latter end
[28:17] and thou shalt say thine heart my power
[28:20] and the might of my hand had got me this
[28:22] wealth
[28:23] but thou shalt remember the lord thy god
[28:26] for it is he
[28:27] that giveth the power to get wealth
[28:31] and that he may establish his covenant
[28:34] which he sway unto thy fathers
[28:35] as in this day and shall be if thou do
[28:38] all
[28:39] at all forget the lord thy god and walk
[28:41] after other gods and save them
[28:43] and worship them i testify against you
[28:45] this day
[28:46] you shall surely perish as the nations
[28:49] which the lord destroy before your face
[28:51] so shall he perish
[28:53] because you would not be obedient unto
[28:55] the voice
[28:56] of the lord your god and from first
[28:59] corinthians chapter nine
[29:01] wondering from verse 24 paul speaking
[29:05] knowing not that day which run in a race
[29:07] run all but one receiver the prize
[29:09] so run that he may obtain that's a
[29:12] message we preached
[29:13] a couple of weeks ago and every man that
[29:16] strived for the mastery is temperate in
[29:19] all things
[29:20] now they do it to obtain a corruptable
[29:22] crown but we are incorruptable
[29:24] i therefore still run not as uncertain
[29:27] so fight i not as one that beated the
[29:30] ear
[29:31] but i keep under my body and bring it in
[29:34] subjection
[29:36] least by any means when i have preached
[29:39] to others i
[29:40] myself should be a cast away
[29:43] and i think i want to just look at that
[29:46] scripture again
[29:47] first corinthians chapter 9 and you want
[29:49] to just read it
[29:50] in the amplified you say but like a
[29:52] boxer i buffet my body
[29:55] handle it roughly discipline it by
[29:57] hardships
[29:59] and subdue it for fear that after
[30:01] proclaiming to others the gospel
[30:04] and things spitting into it i myself
[30:07] should become unfit
[30:08] not stand the test be unapproved and
[30:11] rejected as a counterfeit
[30:13] let's bow heads one more time heavenly
[30:14] father we thank you for your word we
[30:16] have read it
[30:16] and only you could interpret it to our
[30:18] hearts lord and you know what's upon my
[30:20] heart to share with you people tonight
[30:21] mew inspired lord i
[30:23] i trust you tonight and i have
[30:25] confidence that you would come down
[30:27] among us and speak to our hearts and
[30:29] and change and transform our lives in
[30:31] jesus name i ask a team and you may be
[30:32] seated
[30:33] or praise god i certainly appreciate the
[30:34] bible study we're going to steve muller
[30:36] very uh last night
[30:38] oh praise the name of the lord uh it was
[30:41] a
[30:41] a nice word for us amen praise god so
[30:43] this will tie into that and tie into
[30:45] uh the last message we preach also okay
[30:49] so i have a title tonight the cost of
[30:51] freedom
[30:53] the cost of freedom of a subject
[30:56] discipline as a price
[30:58] and an inspiration freedom is not free
[31:01] or praise the name of the lord and
[31:04] uh romans itself tells us romans 8 14
[31:08] first man led by the spirit of god are
[31:10] the sons of god
[31:11] you have not received the spirit of
[31:13] bondage again to fear
[31:15] but you'll receive the spirit of
[31:16] adoption wherever you cried the father
[31:18] could imagine from coming from sinners
[31:20] god could release
[31:21] not the spirit of bondage but the spirit
[31:24] of adoption
[31:25] that you call abba father it's
[31:27] circumvent all the little
[31:29] mary's and all the secretaries and all
[31:31] the inbetweenies
[31:34] cut all that off it brings you direct
[31:36] access to god
[31:38] because you're not crying about pastor
[31:39] evangelist apostle you're kind of a
[31:41] father
[31:42] direct director your lord you're not
[31:46] coming to a man
[31:47] you're coming to direct source spirit of
[31:49] russian crime abba father
[31:50] and you have received again the spirit
[31:52] of the option cover the spirit itself
[31:54] buried witness with our spirit that we
[31:56] are the children of god and if turin and
[31:58] ears ears of god
[31:59] joined it with christ so he's laid it
[32:01] out if if heirs
[32:02] is of god joining with christ if so if
[32:05] so if so that we
[32:06] suffer with him that we may be also be
[32:09] glorified together if i reckon that the
[32:11] sufferings
[32:11] of this present time are not worthy to
[32:13] be compared with the glory
[32:15] we shall reveal in us so if you can't
[32:17] suffer then they carry with him
[32:19] there's a price there's a cost we're
[32:21] going out somewhere this night amen
[32:23] for the earnest on expectation of the
[32:25] creature
[32:26] waited for the manifestation of the sons
[32:28] of god and then it went on to talk about
[32:30] the creation
[32:31] supposed to be vanity but i want to jump
[32:32] into the amplified for the whole
[32:34] creation
[32:35] all nature waits expectantly and longs
[32:38] earnestly for god's sons to be made
[32:41] known
[32:42] wait for the revealing or the disclosing
[32:45] of their sonship
[32:46] it's almost as god's sons are hidden
[32:48] they are veiled but the
[32:50] nato itself is waiting for them to be
[32:52] unveiled
[32:53] oh glory to god for the creation which
[32:56] is nature
[32:57] was subject to frailty watched not
[32:59] because of some intentional fault of its
[33:01] part
[33:02] but by the will of him who subjected it
[33:04] yet to hope
[33:05] the nature of creation itself will be
[33:08] set free
[33:10] from its bondage to decay and corruption
[33:13] and gain entrance into the glorious
[33:16] freedom of god's children
[33:18] so we are promised what the bible called
[33:20] the glorious
[33:21] liberty of the sons of god hallelujah
[33:25] hallelujah from this bondage of
[33:27] corruption
[33:28] into the glorious liberty or the
[33:30] glorious freedom
[33:32] of the sons of god we wasn't made to be
[33:34] bong
[33:35] we wasn't made to be tied up we wasn't
[33:37] made to be tangled up we wasn't made to
[33:39] be in a prison
[33:40] we were made to be free in the image and
[33:43] likeness of god
[33:44] that's how god placed us in the garden
[33:46] of eden in the original
[33:48] oh give the lord a shout that's original
[33:50] commission
[33:51] oh let us put man in our image we have
[33:54] nothing on earth like him we're going to
[33:55] make one like
[33:56] ourselves and when god saw it was good
[33:59] oh give the lord some praises
[34:01] he made a spirit man oh glory to god no
[34:04] no flesh man the flesh getting a theft
[34:06] and a child he made a spirit man and
[34:08] said what's good
[34:09] he's in my image and likeness and in
[34:11] genesis 2 he put a dust man
[34:13] and put the spirit man in that dust man
[34:15] man became a living soul
[34:17] oh glory to god give the lord a shout
[34:19] because there was no man to tell the
[34:21] soil
[34:22] but we are going back to our sonship we
[34:24] are going back to inheritance
[34:26] oh hallelujah hallelujah do you believe
[34:29] that
[34:30] amen so we know the whole creation grown
[34:33] and travail it and paint together
[34:34] not only they but ourselves also we have
[34:37] the full suit of the spirit
[34:38] even we ourselves growing ourselves
[34:40] waiting for the adoption
[34:41] to with the redemption of our body
[34:45] now this word discipline it as a system
[34:49] it means that i got
[34:50] got um of it it means control
[34:53] gain by enforcing obedience or order
[34:58] that's what discipline means
[35:01] or prescribed conduct or pattern of
[35:04] behavior
[35:06] training that corrects
[35:09] molds or perfects the mental faculties
[35:13] or moral character that is what
[35:15] discipline is about
[35:16] you do this up in a child you try to run
[35:18] away bad behavior and that small child
[35:20] become a big big
[35:22] problem in society later on because
[35:24] there's no discipline
[35:25] but you know god doesn't have his sons
[35:27] running in discipline we know every son
[35:29] that committed god
[35:30] god has handled them a certain way
[35:32] because there's god you're talking about
[35:34] you're not talking about a man he you
[35:35] know doti grandfather all humanistic
[35:37] sons and daughters
[35:38] hallelujah real life grandchildren and
[35:40] so on we love that but god only our sons
[35:42] and daughters
[35:43] so all them mini babies and small babies
[35:44] then we go see sons and daughters
[35:46] even before they were born in the
[35:48] mother's womb oh hallelujah god see them
[35:51] as sons
[35:51] coming forth hallelujah so that's why
[35:54] they could tell rebecca maybe the mother
[35:56] of millions
[35:57] i mean your seed possessed the gates of
[35:59] them that hate him
[36:00] oh glory to god it wasn't just watching
[36:02] mother and father and all my
[36:03] wife you're watching generation upon
[36:05] generation hallelujah what is it the
[36:07] seed of the righteous
[36:09] because god knew there was a serpent
[36:10] seed on the earth they are going to
[36:12] pervert and table with judgment and
[36:14] everything else
[36:15] and they will so corrupt the earth that
[36:16] the seed of the righteous will get left
[36:18] and less and less and less
[36:19] so god had to preserve the seed of the
[36:21] righteous oh glory to god so he put
[36:23] something inside of you
[36:25] that you could respond to the word in
[36:26] your time in your generation
[36:28] in your season he put that inside of you
[36:31] and no adultery fornication lying
[36:33] drunken parents grandparents could stop
[36:35] you from coming forth
[36:37] you put your name on the book first and
[36:39] let me drop you along in time
[36:41] to whatever family to bring you forth
[36:43] you couldn't miss your appointment for
[36:45] nothing
[36:45] here you are tonight elected
[36:48] predestinated
[36:50] all glory to god not to be deceived oh
[36:54] go with the god amen hallelujah
[36:57] hebrews 5 8 talking about jesus though
[37:00] he was
[37:01] son yet
[37:04] learned he obedience by the things which
[37:07] he suffered
[37:08] so he suffered he learned obedience like
[37:10] that
[37:11] so we're not born on obedient children
[37:13] we learn obedience
[37:15] just as jesus had to learn it we have to
[37:17] learn it too and there's a way god will
[37:19] instruct and bring guidance and so on
[37:22] isn't that right
[37:23] first peter 4 1 2 says
[37:26] for as much as christ had suffered for
[37:29] us
[37:30] in the flesh i am yourself likewise
[37:34] with the same mind for he that suffered
[37:37] in the flesh
[37:38] had ceased from sin think about it
[37:42] all right i know there's not a nice
[37:44] smoothie smoothie service
[37:46] there's not like a press you know right
[37:47] here you put some frozen
[37:50] banana and some whipped cream and
[37:52] presents
[37:54] and they give wait let's call it again
[37:56] i'm gonna school drink a smoothie a
[37:58] smoothie
[37:58] they didn't have a smoothie tonight all
[38:00] right there's no smoothie
[38:02] all right so watch for as much as christ
[38:04] has suffered for us in the flesh
[38:06] arm yourself likewise with the same mind
[38:09] for he that
[38:10] suffered in the flesh that cease from
[38:11] sin
[38:13] that he should no longer live the rest
[38:14] of his time in the flesh to the lust of
[38:16] the
[38:16] men but to the will of god first peter 2
[38:20] 21-23 it says here
[38:22] for even here unto were he called
[38:25] because christ also suffered for us
[38:28] leaving us an example
[38:29] that we should follow his steps who did
[38:31] no sin neither was god found in his
[38:33] mouth
[38:34] who when he was reviled reviled again
[38:36] when he suffered
[38:37] he threatened not but committed himself
[38:40] to him
[38:41] that judge it righteously oh glory to
[38:44] god
[38:45] and then barbara was praying he said
[38:46] bless all coming together we pray lord
[38:49] uh this wednesday night that we have

[40:07] spiritual attitude then there will be a
[40:09] revival really
[40:11] and it will be so much better for our
[40:13] prayers for the sick

[41:20] oh come on now hallelujah so watch
[41:23] as long as our conditions are shrunken
[41:26] we just don't seem to pick it up like we
[41:28] should
[41:29] but when everybody is sprayed up
[41:34] kid high and a great
[41:37] expectation i've walked to the platform
[41:40] many times be five or seven thousand
[41:43] people
[41:43] and not be one feeble person left
[41:47] as soon as you walk out on the platform
[41:49] everyone get all the wheelchair cuts and
[41:51] stretches
[41:52] and everything walk right away because
[41:54] you're under such expectation
[41:56] no that was in the days of the early
[41:59] beginning of the ministry
[42:00] before there was anybody else on the
[42:02] field it had to be kind of let down for
[42:03] a while
[42:04] and then everybody it was new and the
[42:06] people were just expecting anything
[42:08] now if you will have the same
[42:11] expectation
[42:11] you'll get the same results so nobody
[42:14] can tell me that was when the prophets
[42:16] are wrong
[42:16] and he reported him as you know if we
[42:18] get the same expectation
[42:20] we'll give the lord a shout we will have
[42:22] the same results
[42:24] because he is jesus christ the same
[42:26] yesterday today
[42:27] and forever oh glory to god do you
[42:30] believe that
[42:32] hallelujah so
[42:35] [Music]
[42:36] amen so now we know what happened when a
[42:38] boy come to a certain age
[42:39] that boy was adopted into the family
[42:43] they took him out in a public place put
[42:45] a special robe on him
[42:46] had a ceremony and all the people of the
[42:48] city gathered around and looked
[42:49] and they had looked upon this boy and
[42:51] the father a sermon of adoption don't
[42:53] miss this
[42:54] and that son was abducted his name on
[42:56] the checkbook was just as good as his
[42:58] daddy's
[42:59] there is where the god is trying to get
[43:01] his church god is what
[43:02] trying to get his church okay
[43:06] just say that this mountain be moved and
[43:07] we'll move authority
[43:10] sons of god the whole creation has grown
[43:12] and waiting for the manifestation of the
[43:14] sons of god
[43:15] waiting to a spot to where sickness will
[43:18] be arise
[43:19] and it will be that way the blind will
[43:22] receive their sight
[43:23] death and dumb we pray for them now but
[43:25] then you will command it
[43:27] didn't they didn't it said these sons
[43:29] you follow them believe they shall pray
[43:31] for the sick he said they shall cast our
[43:33] devil that i will they will
[43:34] and if you say to the smoke not if i say
[43:37] if you say to this mountain
[43:38] be move and don't doubt in your heart
[43:41] what we need is adoption
[43:43] need adoption sons and daughters need
[43:46] adoption
[43:47] but how can the church here we go
[43:51] the pentecostal church and the methodist
[43:53] and the baptist church be adopted
[43:56] until they come to discipline
[44:00] no discipline no adoption
[44:04] let me say it again no discipline
[44:08] no adoption the church
[44:12] must come into discipline
[44:16] hallelujah not people run around with
[44:18] their own feelings
[44:20] because discipline is separate from
[44:21] feelings now this opinion is the order
[44:24] of things
[44:25] you have to do it because it needs to be
[44:27] done even if you
[44:28] feel like it you feel enough to take a
[44:31] seat
[44:32] but it's the father's business oh glory
[44:35] to god when somebody owned a business
[44:37] they had to open it and close it
[44:38] it's their business they're feeling sick
[44:40] they're still going because it's their
[44:42] business
[44:42] oh glory to god they have to see about
[44:44] their business and god have a business
[44:47] it's the kingdom of god you have to be
[44:49] interested in your father's business
[44:51] jesus i must be up with my father's
[44:53] business he wasn't caring about his
[44:55] feelings he was concerned about his
[44:57] father's
[44:58] business well give the lord a shout all
[45:01] glory hallelujah
[45:03] okay watch how can the church the
[45:06] pentecostal church
[45:07] watch and the methodists and the baptist
[45:09] churches be adopted until they come to
[45:10] discipline
[45:11] we have got to be disciplined first i
[45:14] know you don't hear much preaching on
[45:15] this but this is the word here now
[45:17] oh hello people adoption and speak the
[45:18] word when you press come down oh yeah
[45:21] take this before all this press come
[45:23] down and because you
[45:24] you have this mountain you feel so deep
[45:26] and you feel so on
[45:27] take this you've got to be disciplined
[45:29] first god
[45:31] could not trust his power with the
[45:33] church it's hard to tell what they will
[45:34] do
[45:35] you might want to speak me out of
[45:36] existence they don't know you like my
[45:38] head
[45:39] so god can't put power on all of that
[45:40] that crazy stuff
[45:42] you have to go and see what's in their
[45:43] heart oh glory to god
[45:46] when the children of israel wanted the
[45:47] freedom go deliver us
[45:49] deliver us
[45:52] but they gave good food philosophy them
[45:56] to the full
[45:57] isn't that right they were feeding them
[45:59] to work hard
[46:01] to build the cities god sent moses to
[46:03] deliver them
[46:05] what a jubilee to leave egypt hallelujah
[46:08] now they're going where they don't know
[46:09] two million people
[46:10] god sent manna and you had the bible
[46:12] study but but isaac talking about it
[46:14] when manna falls the people find me by
[46:16] the light it tastes like coriander seed
[46:20] and in egypt they had meat in egypt they
[46:23] had this
[46:25] it wasn't so hard as it was in egypt
[46:27] they're studying the bondage
[46:29] they're studying the licks they're
[46:31] saying all of that they're only studying
[46:32] oh they can't handle what god given them
[46:34] now and all god trying to get them to is
[46:37] to the promised land
[46:38] all of this is journey manner is journey
[46:42] hallelujah what in the rock this journey
[46:44] hallelujah
[46:45] all this thing is journey you see what
[46:47] i've scripted i read he said your foot
[46:48] didn't swell
[46:50] oh glory to god i kept you for 40 years
[46:53] all glory to god remember who brought
[46:55] you
[46:56] out when you build your big house when
[46:58] you have your money
[46:59] when you have your car you better don't
[47:01] forget me because i am the one who
[47:03] brought you out
[47:04] and empower you to get what you get or
[47:07] give the lord a shout in the house oh
[47:10] hallelujah praise god hallelujah
[47:15] you say how could a father trust his
[47:17] business with a boy that might simply
[47:18] pollute his whole inheritance
[47:20] he can do it the church has got to come
[47:23] to a place to where it is disciplined
[47:25] god's under work right now discipline he
[47:28] took that son out made a ceremony
[47:30] this is my son i adopt him and watch he
[47:33] was take that to jesus right
[47:35] and jesus had pleased him he took him up
[47:37] took three early witnesses peter james
[47:39] and john
[47:39] he called it hope faith and charity and
[47:41] brought moses and elijah down to witness
[47:43] this great adoption
[47:45] what was he done there is something
[47:47] special here tonight what we're gonna
[47:48] say here tonight
[47:49] the bible said he was transfigured
[47:53] and his rainman shine like the sun a
[47:55] special robe
[47:56] listen to these words a special robe a
[47:59] special anointing
[48:03] oh glory to god a special robe a special
[48:07] anointing
[48:08] and when they looked up they saw him
[48:10] shining in the glory of god
[48:12] and a voice said this is my beloved son
[48:14] here in him what god wants to do with
[48:16] the church tonight
[48:17] he wants to do with an individual
[48:21] is to find somebody the holy spirit is
[48:23] searching to find
[48:25] men that he can take out a certain place
[48:28] and speak to that person
[48:29] anoint them and give them something
[48:32] special great powers
[48:34] and gifts to work his will and to do his
[48:38] will
[48:38] not to stand up and just talk behind
[48:41] pulpit
[48:42] or give the lord some praises but great
[48:44] powers and gifts
[48:46] to do his will and to work as well
[48:49] so what am i supposed to expect more
[48:51] talk oh glory to god
[48:54] how can he do it if he constantly has to
[48:56] compensate oh it's terrible
[48:58] they just run after this they run after
[49:00] error they won't go to church
[49:01] look at what the conditioned churches if
[49:03] god can't do it to the body
[49:04] he will pick up individuals and do it
[49:07] god is able
[49:08] to rise children unto abraham oh glory
[49:11] to god
[49:12] so when we spoke the last message we
[49:14] talk about entitlement right
[49:16] and paul was showing that he didn't
[49:17] consider himself entitled
[49:19] and he considered himself pressing
[49:21] towards the mark
[49:23] he considered himself going amen are
[49:25] running a certain way
[49:27] because there are no shortcuts
[49:29] hallelujah
[49:30] and he said therefore so run not as
[49:32] uncertainly sulfite eye
[49:34] as one that beats the air but i keep my
[49:37] body
[49:38] and bring it on subjection so what he
[49:40] was saying and he was keeping in the
[49:42] discipline
[49:43] in order to win in order to stand
[49:46] in order to run or give the lord a shout
[49:50] you see some people just think they are
[49:52] just predestinated and they sit back
[49:54] and tight entitled to the rapture and
[49:57] that's a lie from the bitter hell
[49:59] you can't overcome a full-time devil
[50:01] being a part-time christian
[50:03] or give the lord some praises and this
[50:05] devil not don't have corona virus and
[50:07] you do not know quarantine
[50:08] what gives the lord some praises he has
[50:10] actively bringing unbelief to people's
[50:13] mind
[50:13] he is actively depressing and
[50:15] frustrating and dropping darkness upon
[50:17] people
[50:18] you have to be actively pursuing the
[50:20] promises of the living god
[50:22] come on preach back to me somebody you
[50:24] have to be active in your pursuit
[50:26] to the mark of the high calling in
[50:28] christ jesus
[50:29] let's continue he said you know what i
[50:31] believe
[50:33] he said people are convinced that jesus
[50:35] is coming soon i don't believe that the
[50:37] people are convinced he's coming in this
[50:38] age
[50:39] i believe the reason they are not
[50:41] concerned is because they're not
[50:42] convinced fully convinced
[50:44] they are not convinced he's with them

[59:09] killing sleep
[59:11] god he didn't have the burden i didn't
[59:14] recognize the cost and the price that he
[59:16] had to pay
[59:17] but he set himself the bible said he set

[59:49] others there is no shortcut
[59:52] there is no other way face up to it
[59:55] oh glory if you are a slacker and you
[59:57] don't want to study the word yourself
[59:59] any man could deceive you because you're
[1:00:01] leaving up to him to interpret the word
[1:00:03] to you
[1:00:04] and god sent a messenger with a message
[1:00:07] that is thus here the lord
[1:00:09] lord
[1:00:13] check inaudible the man preaching by the
[1:00:15] word oh give the lord a shout don't be
[1:00:18] though
[1:00:18] dead and lazy that is a man of god and
[1:00:20] you might not go check him out
[1:00:22] try the spirit see if they of god oh
[1:00:25] glory to god and trust in no man
[1:00:28] i trust in god are taking the word and
[1:00:31] checking every spirit out
[1:00:33] oh because many false spirits have come
[1:00:35] into the world
[1:00:36] much of them lying all around the world
[1:00:38] right now same line spirit that drop
[1:00:40] upon 400 prophets
[1:00:41] i feel we have over ten thousand false
[1:00:43] prophets in this world or more
[1:00:46] and the same spirit anointing all of
[1:00:48] them
[1:00:49] lying prophets oh recorded not speaking
[1:00:52] according to the word
[1:00:53] every man would be a lion man be true
[1:00:56] wow wow wow wow
[1:00:58] so paul was under discipline that's why
[1:01:02] he could conduct his bodies roughly
[1:01:04] that he didn't want to be a cast away he
[1:01:06] didn't want to be after he preached a
[1:01:07] gospel he ended up on the scrap heap
[1:01:10] but i'm saying many ministers would end
[1:01:11] up on the scrap heap because they didn't
[1:01:13] end it right
[1:01:14] they're trying to work the works of
[1:01:15] christ before having the life of christ
[1:01:17] and that can't work
[1:01:18] there's not a pentecostal age die by god
[1:01:20] given all this
[1:01:21] length of time and there's eight times
[1:01:23] of lingering
[1:01:24] waiting not for constant churches and
[1:01:26] press here waiting for them you know he
[1:01:28] reading verse
[1:01:29] god is waiting on you and i adoption
[1:01:31] time when god could pour out his spirit
[1:01:34] oh god paul is putting a bunch of
[1:01:36] nonsense you had to get the word right
[1:01:39] the foundation right the mechanics right
[1:01:42] oh give the lord some praises
[1:01:44] oh glory to god so what is a disciple
[1:01:46] what is becoming a disciple
[1:01:48] a disciple is a follower a student of
[1:01:51] christ
[1:01:52] christ being the master and luke 9 23 he
[1:01:55] said unto them if any man will come
[1:01:56] after me
[1:01:57] let him deny himself take up his cross
[1:01:59] and follow me
[1:02:01] my i must hold something if anyone will
[1:02:04] come after me come after
[1:02:06] which is a follower which is a disciple
[1:02:08] let him deny himself
[1:02:10] i'll take up his cross daily i want to
[1:02:12] underline that word
[1:02:14] daily that means it's a daily walk
[1:02:18] daily talk that's a choice you know you
[1:02:21] ought to make you know
[1:02:22] to make it daily reading the word daily
[1:02:25] praying
[1:02:26] daily applying daily fighting daily
[1:02:29] pressing daily a christian every single
[1:02:32] day
[1:02:34] that's why i'm saying make yourself a
[1:02:36] christian make yourself a christian
[1:02:39] is that no holy water to drink can they
[1:02:41] become a christian
[1:02:42] you make yourself a christian luke 14
[1:02:45] and whoever does not bear the cross and
[1:02:47] come after me can i be my disciple
[1:02:50] bear the cross and come after. bear it
[1:02:52] and come after.
[1:02:53] go get a cross and you have to come
[1:02:55] after he says sit down
[1:02:59] oh we have to follow yes who the pastor
[1:03:02] know him yeah they can follow me as i
[1:03:04] follow christ
[1:03:06] you have to know that you're following
[1:03:07] christ but the key is christ
[1:03:09] paul said follow me as i follow christ
[1:03:12] conditional
[1:03:14] okay he said now watch whoever does not
[1:03:17] bear
[1:03:17] crosstalk and come after me cannot be my
[1:03:18] disciple for which of you
[1:03:20] come on now intend to build a tower sit
[1:03:23] a knock first
[1:03:24] and come to cost whether you are
[1:03:26] sufficient to finish it
[1:03:28] at least happily after he had laid the
[1:03:30] foundation he's not able to finish it
[1:03:32] and all the people begin to mock him
[1:03:34] saying this man begin to build
[1:03:37] and he was not able to finish what did
[1:03:39] the prophet teach us is that him who
[1:03:40] starts
[1:03:42] is him who finished you have to count
[1:03:44] the course
[1:03:46] oh if you will finish he said which man
[1:03:49] he said what oh what king going to make
[1:03:51] war against another king sit
[1:03:52] down first and consulted whether he be
[1:03:55] able with ten thousand to meet with him
[1:03:56] he's committed against him with twenty
[1:03:57] thousand
[1:03:58] or else which the other is a great way
[1:04:00] off he standeth ambassador
[1:04:02] and desired condition of peace so
[1:04:05] likewise here we go
[1:04:06] whosoever he be of you that forsaken not
[1:04:09] all he had
[1:04:10] he cannot be my disciples so jesus was
[1:04:13] clearly defining discipleship

[1:12:41] soul
[1:12:42] for 40 years they're getting blessed in
[1:12:44] the wilderness because god provided for
[1:12:46] them because you want to bring them to
[1:12:47] the promised land
[1:12:48] to show them he is good and he keeps his
[1:12:51] word
[1:12:52] he asked them ministers to go and bring
[1:12:54] a report and then

[1:12:58] our evil report

[1:18:56] at this age lord be unveiled to us
[1:18:58] reason
[1:18:59] that we will see the plainness of god
[1:19:02] what for
[1:19:03] so that we will know how to behave
[1:19:06] ourselves
[1:19:07] and act correcting ourselves
[1:19:10] and bringing here we go the members of
[1:19:12] our body into the discipline to the word

[1:19:22] lord jesus so all the seals
[1:19:24] all the mysteries is for us to get a
[1:19:26] revelation of the plainness of god to
[1:19:28] know how to behave
[1:19:29] what is that romans 12 present your
[1:19:32] body's a living sacrifice
[1:19:33] about this even say which is a
[1:19:34] reasonable service the lowest level
[1:19:37] hallelujah that they may prove what is
[1:19:38] that good acceptable of god
[1:19:41] hallelujah
[1:19:47] hebrews 10 and every priest who's 11
[1:19:50] standard ministering and offering of
[1:19:52] times the same sacrifice
[1:19:54] which can never take away sins but this
[1:19:56] man like that
[1:19:58] after he had offered one sacrifice for
[1:20:01] sin
[1:20:02] forever sat down at the right hand of
[1:20:03] god
[1:20:05] from henceforth expecting till his
[1:20:07] enemies we made the footstool
[1:20:09] for by one offering he had perfected
[1:20:10] forever them that are sanctified
[1:20:13] oh my do you believe that tonight oh
[1:20:16] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:20:18] o praise god hallelujah hallelujah
[1:20:21] i'm about to close oh my
[1:20:25] but abraham let us examine the first
[1:20:26] phrase that remains i love and the greek
[1:20:28] the emphasis is upon the peace not
[1:20:30] pronoun i he does not say as many
[1:20:33] would feel he should say as as many as
[1:20:36] love me
[1:20:37] no sir we must never try to make jesus
[1:20:40] the object of human love in this verse
[1:20:42] not is as many that are that are the
[1:20:45] loved ones of god it is
[1:20:46] his loving question not ours
[1:20:50] so once again we find ourselves glory in
[1:20:53] his salvation
[1:20:54] his purpose and his plan and we are
[1:20:57] confirmed even more strongly in the
[1:20:59] truth of the doctrine
[1:21:00] of the sovereignty of god even as he
[1:21:03] said in romans 9 13 jacob have i loved
[1:21:05] does it not obtain that he also loved
[1:21:08] only the many
[1:21:10] is he therefore in the state of
[1:21:11] complacency awaiting the love of those
[1:21:13] who have not drawn
[1:21:14] nigh him by no means is this so for he
[1:21:16] declared in romans 8 9 13
[1:21:18] he saw have i hated and in verse 11 the
[1:21:21] spirit boldly calls out for the
[1:21:23] children not being born neither have
[1:21:25] done anything good or evil
[1:21:26] that the purpose of god according to
[1:21:29] election might stand not a works
[1:21:31] but of him that call it this love here
[1:21:34] we go as we close tonight
[1:21:35] is elective love it is his love
[1:21:38] for his elect and his love for them
[1:21:42] is apart from human merit nothing you
[1:21:45] could do
[1:21:47] could deserve this love it is his love
[1:21:51] it's a path from human merit for it says
[1:21:54] that the purpose of god
[1:21:56] stands in election which is exactly
[1:21:59] opposite to works
[1:22:01] or anything man in himself because
[1:22:03] before the show were born
[1:22:04] he had already said jacob have i loved
[1:22:07] and he so have i hated
[1:22:09] and now he said to his own as many as i
[1:22:12] love a rebuke and chasing
[1:22:14] to rebuke is to reprove to reprove
[1:22:20] is to expose with a future correction
[1:22:23] chasing does not need to punish
[1:22:26] it means a discipline because the
[1:22:29] subject amendment is in mind
[1:22:32] this is exactly what we find in hebrews
[1:22:33] 12 5 11.
[1:22:35] for you have forgotten the exaltation
[1:22:36] which speaketh unto you as unto children
[1:22:38] my son despise not
[1:22:40] the chastening of the lord nor faint
[1:22:42] when thought rebuked of him
[1:22:43] for whom the lord loved it he chastened
[1:22:46] it and scorch it
[1:22:47] every son whom he receive it if you end
[1:22:50] your chaste and god delivered you as
[1:22:52] with son
[1:22:52] for what son is he whom the father
[1:22:54] chastened not but if he be without
[1:22:56] chastisement way of
[1:22:58] all are partakers then your bastards are
[1:23:00] not sons furthermore we have had fathers
[1:23:02] our flesh
[1:23:02] which corrected us and we give them
[1:23:04] reverence shall we not much more rather
[1:23:06] be the subjection
[1:23:07] of the father of spirit live for they
[1:23:10] verily for a few days chasteness after
[1:23:12] their own pleasure
[1:23:13] but he for our prophet that we might be
[1:23:15] partakers of his holiness now
[1:23:17] not chasing for the present seemer to be
[1:23:19] joyous
[1:23:20] but grievous nevertheless afterwards it
[1:23:22] healed the peaceable fruit
[1:23:23] of righteousness unto them that are
[1:23:25] exercised nearby
[1:23:27] hearing is now set forth the love of god
[1:23:30] he desired in love a family of his own
[1:23:33] a family of sons sons like himself
[1:23:37] there before him lies all mankind has
[1:23:39] one lump of clay
[1:23:41] out of the same lump he will now make
[1:23:44] vessels under honor
[1:23:45] on the dishonor the chosen will be his
[1:23:48] own chosen
[1:23:49] then those chosen ones born of his
[1:23:53] spirit
[1:23:54] will be trained watch to conform to his
[1:23:57] image
[1:23:58] in their walk he reproves them
[1:24:02] with all long suffering and gentleness
[1:24:04] and mercy he
[1:24:05] chastened with neil's guide hands
[1:24:08] sometimes this spotter
[1:24:09] must take the vessel he's working on and
[1:24:11] totally break it down in order that he
[1:24:13] may rebuild it exactly as he does
[1:24:14] desired
[1:24:15] but it is love that is his love
[1:24:19] another way of his love there is not
[1:24:22] they cannot be let's all
[1:24:27] [Music]
[1:24:28] oh stand he loves you
[1:24:34] oh how he loves me
