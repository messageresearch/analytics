[45:22] and Jesus am I ask it amen and amen God
[45:25] bless you praise the Lord
[45:27] so great to be here and I think that I
[45:31] want to just bring a slight recap from
[45:32] the Friday prayer meeting in which we
[45:36] talk about homegrown and testing for the
[45:39] supernatural just to follow through
[45:41] what about Anthony shared on Wednesday
[45:43] night and we took the scripture from
[45:45] Luke 2 talking about Simeon the Bible
[45:47] says it was it was behold there was a
[45:50] man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon
[45:52] the same man was just on the Vault
[45:54] waiting for the consolation of Israel
[45:55] and the Holy Ghost was upon him
[45:58] you can underline that path and what the
[46:00] Holy Ghost was upon him I was revealing
[46:02] to him by the holy ghost that was upon
[46:04] him that he should not see death that
[46:06] has seen the Lord's Christ and brother
[46:08] Brian was talking about America people
[46:11] begging for the baptism of the Holy
[46:12] Spirit they are sick and tired of
[46:14] Theology and human psychology they want
[46:16] to feel the touch of the Living God who
[46:19] changes men's lives can make them new
[46:22] creatures in Christ Jesus this is what
[46:24] the Holy Ghost does because Holy Ghost
[46:26] is not from our realm Holy Ghost is
[46:29] Supernatural like but Anthony was
[46:30] speaking about so when God step into
[46:32] your realm and do something for you you
[46:35] have to be a changed person because
[46:37] that's not natural flesh and blood that
[46:39] what Jesus told Peter flesh on the heart
[46:40] to reveal it and to use that right he
[46:42] said the trouble of it is the church is
[46:44] not hungry enough the night for God
[46:49] information but they're not hungry for
[46:52] God and that's hungering until sin is
[46:54] what the Bible said blessed are the day
[46:56] that hunger and Truth after
[46:57] righteousness so we're not talking about
[46:58] coming to church here and Jordan should
[47:00] we're not talking about that we're
[47:01] talking about hungry for God I remember
[47:03] when I was young and I come to the Lord
[47:04] I was hungry for God I fasting and
[47:07] praying and seeking I couldn't help it I
[47:08] don't know if it's food I want I don't
[47:10] know what I was hungry for God I want
[47:12] you to live in reality praise God and
[47:14] that is what changed my life you have to
[47:16] be hungry and if you're not hungry this
[47:17] morning your prayer must be creating me
[47:19] a hungering creating me a testing
[47:22] because it is needed it is necessary the
[47:25] world of all his advertisement out there
[47:27] to attract our attention to take away
[47:29] the hunger from God but God wants you to
[47:31] focus on him that you could hunger after
[47:32] him not after money not after popularity
[47:35] not after woman not after Fame nothing
[47:37] else but him they seek first the kingdom
[47:40] and all other things gonna be added unto
[47:42] you do you believe that that the trouble
[47:43] of it is the church is not hungry enough
[47:45] tonight for God is the reason the holy
[47:48] spirit is not moving in the church
[47:49] tonight so once the hungering start to
[47:51] kicking praise God you will see the
[47:53] operation of the Holy Ghost praise God
[47:55] we're not talking about people coming to
[47:56] examine the message and judge the
[47:58] message from your seat you're not coming
[48:00] here to do that you come here to hang on
[48:01] tears of the righteousness you're
[48:03] looking for a donkey come behind you you
[48:05] don't care who speak it doesn't matter
[48:06] who speak it's not the speaker it's the
[48:08] Holy Ghost the whole Glory that God is
[48:10] Not the Man in the Holy Ghost is that
[48:12] who we have in today is the Holy Ghost
[48:14] and who I want this one to preach and I
[48:16] pray for this one it's not that it's the
[48:17] Holy Ghost once the Holy Ghost here the
[48:19] Holy Ghost want to speak the Holy Ghost
[48:21] got to heal the Holy Ghost gonna deliver
[48:23] the Holy Ghost is going to revive the
[48:25] holy is going to restore the holy is
[48:27] going to pour out or give the Lord a
[48:29] shout in the house glory to God
[48:31] hallelujah praise God praise God
[48:34] hallelujah
[48:36] listen to this it's the attitude of the
[48:38] people that brings the results as you
[48:40] know who the people out here who
[48:43] shout out the people
[48:45] it takes the people to call court on the
[48:47] scene they take the people to call God
[48:49] civil interaction it's the attitude of
[48:51] the people no man can bring a Revival
[48:53] the Revival have to come by
[48:56] the Revival of the come by
[48:58] have to stop what you give yourself a
[49:00] shout give a shout unto the Lord so God
[49:03] put you have a path to play in getting
[49:06] this real turning it's getting this
[49:08] revival moving God ordain you you are no
[49:11] mistake you are no miscarriage praise

[49:28] you know you know no God need you we
[49:31] need you we need you right where you are
[49:34] we need you shouting we need you
[49:36] praising God we need you to be on fire
[49:38] we need to be under expectation we need
[49:41] to be hungry and our tears of the
[49:42] righteousness
[49:42] [Applause]
[49:47] Glory
[49:49] will be seated is the attitude of the
[49:52] people that brings the results and here
[49:54] we go that's the reason at Pentecost
[49:57] they have to go in an upper room and
[50:01] pray until the Holy Ghost came
[50:04] so Jesus said receiving Holy Ghost
[50:06] because they are taken by faith I get it
[50:09] already because he spoke it up over me
[50:11] he speak the word
[50:13] no he said he's satari in the city of
[50:15] Jerusalem until
[50:18] yeah but do it far from on high not far
[50:21] from below not far from the side not
[50:24] powerful Emmanuel Pulpit far from on
[50:26] high that's our Supernatural power
[50:29] that's a power that man don't have and
[50:31] bend the day of Pentecost was fully come
[50:34] or Glory fully come they were in the
[50:37] spirit they were praising God they were
[50:40] creating an atmosphere Mary was there
[50:42] Andrew was there oh Glory there God Mary
[50:45] Magdalene Mary Mother Jesus all the
[50:47] Mary's was there everybody was there the
[50:50] pastor was there the talenter was there
[50:53] the convocation was there the song
[50:55] leader was there the deacons was there
[50:57] the trustees was there everybody was
[51:00] there they were waiting on a promise the
[51:02] promise of the father man didn't give
[51:04] that promise man can't make that promise
[51:06] God give you a promise regardless of
[51:09] what you have done you'll still have a
[51:11] promise that promise is over you even if
[51:13] you're backslidden it is still over you
[51:15] you shall receive power after the Holy
[51:18] Ghost come upon you once a son always a
[51:21] son the devil can't change you from
[51:24] being a son you might be a better son
[51:26] but just tell a son you are still a sea
[51:29] God wants to baptize you with the Holy
[51:32] Ghost and with fire oh give the Lord a
[51:35] praise this morning
[51:42] that's the reason you receive it at
[51:45] Pentecost you have to go to the upper
[51:47] room and pray until the Holy Ghost came
[51:49] because they got into one place and one
[51:51] Accord it's the atmosphere that brings
[51:55] the results he said you believe that let
[51:58] every man and woman in this building
[52:00] this morning boy or girl get everything
[52:02] from their minds but the Lord Jesus and
[52:05] believe that he is standing present now
[52:07] and you will see something happening
[52:09] that will cause headlines in the
[52:12] newspaper in the morning that's right
[52:14] it's the atmosphere
[52:16] oh my God that's the recap
[52:19] oh praise God imagine that we just
[52:22] finished the recap there has to recap
[52:24] from the promising
[52:25] or praise God so today
[52:27] have a title
[52:30] a city set on a hill
[52:32] cannot be hid
[52:34] that's Jesus
[52:37] I see these set on a hill cannot be here
[52:39] I have a subject
[52:41] subject is ambition
[52:43] one week
[52:45] I have an inspiration let's have
[52:47] ambition
[52:49] High ambition
[52:51] o praise God let's have ambition hi
[52:54] ambition
[52:57] Angelic beans Associates together
[53:01] he said now if you have got the Holy
[53:03] Spirit In You
[53:04] then you are candidate
[53:06] for Association but the Unseen World
[53:10] and the supernatural
[53:12] no wonder people can't believe in those
[53:14] things they have never come in contact
[53:16] they've got nothing in there to believe
[53:18] with but when the Holy Spirit comes into
[53:20] the heart quickly he becomes a twofold
[53:23] being
[53:24] you become a twofold being
[53:26] one of the earth to die
[53:29] and one of Heaven to live
[53:32] in this body he says subject to debt but
[53:35] in his soul he is passed from Death
[53:38] under life
[53:39] in his body he has his Earthly conduct
[53:42] with his five senses in his Spirit he
[53:45] has a contact with God
[53:47] through the Holy Ghost
[53:49] and the angels of God visit them
[53:52] speaks with them and they are messengers
[53:55] of God sent
[53:58] from God to reveal and to bring Muslim
[54:01] God to the individual could we give the
[54:03] Lord some praises
[54:06] I have
[54:08] two more if I say context scriptures and
[54:10] you'd have to find it one is from
[54:11] Genesis 1 26 and God said let us make
[54:14] man in our image after likeness let him
[54:16] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[54:18] over the fall of the ear and over the
[54:20] cattle and over all the Earth and over
[54:22] every creepy thing that creeped upon the
[54:23] Earth so description Genesis here is God
[54:26] intent and purpose for man
[54:29] I want you to see the scripture here not
[54:31] just in the scripture but this is God's
[54:33] ambition
[54:34] this is God intent that man must have
[54:36] dominion this is God's desire them this
[54:39] scriptures from God's Own Heart let us
[54:41] make man in our image after likeness and
[54:43] let them have dominion underlying
[54:46] Dominion let them have dominion Romans 6
[54:49] next context scripture reading from his
[54:50] 11. Paul speaks likewise reckon yourself
[54:53] also to be dead unto sin but alive unto
[54:57] God through Jesus Christ Our Lord let
[54:59] not sin therefore reign in your mortal
[55:01] body that you should obey it in the lust
[55:04] thereof neither yield him your members
[55:07] as instruments of unrighteousness Unto
[55:09] sin but yield yourself unto God as those
[55:13] that are alive from the dead and your
[55:16] members as instruments of righteousness
[55:18] unto God for sin shall never dominion
[55:20] over you
[55:21] so yeah we fell in sin but yeah prophecy
[55:24] that sin Must Have No Dominion over you
[55:27] but you must have dominion over sin this
[55:29] is what God this is God's desire this is
[55:32] God's ambition that people conquer same
[55:34] we will put our foot on that Devil's
[55:36] neck Oh Glory to God isn't that right
[55:39] for sin shall end of dominion over you
[55:41] you are not under the law but on the
[55:42] grace What then shall be sinned because
[55:44] we are not under the law but under grace
[55:46] God forbid know you not that to whom you
[55:49] heal yourself servants to obey his
[55:52] servants the after whom you will be
[55:53] whether sin unto death or obedience unto
[55:57] righteousness but God be thanked that he
[55:59] will be Servants of sin but you have
[56:01] obeyed from the heart that form of
[56:04] Doctrine which was delivered unto you
[56:06] being then made free from sin you become
[56:09] Servants of righteousness this is God's
[56:11] objective that will be free from sin and
[56:14] become Servants of righteousness it's
[56:16] not right I speak to you after the
[56:18] manner of men because of the infirmity
[56:20] of your flesh for as you have yielded
[56:22] your members servants on cleanness and
[56:24] to iniquity unto iniquity even so now
[56:27] yield your members that's our order
[56:29] yield your members civil righteousness
[56:32] and unto Holiness we'll give the Lord
[56:34] some Praises do you love him this
[56:36] morning
[56:38] praise God so therefore in the in the
[56:41] Amplified verse 12 said let not sin
[56:43] therefore rule as King in your mortal
[56:46] short-lived perishable buddies to make
[56:49] you yield Ed cravings and be subject to
[56:52] its lust and pattern oh praise God I
[56:54] wouldn't call anymore I just want to
[56:56] skip that down that day Hallelujah
[56:58] ambition
[57:00] ambition
[57:01] ambition is a strong desire to do and to
[57:04] achieve something
[57:05] not a desire
[57:07] strong desire as somebody says strong
[57:11] desire
[57:12] to achieve or do something it's the
[57:16] desire and determination to achieve
[57:18] success you don't just want to run and

[1:11:26] give the Lord some praise
[1:11:28] prophets did not always understand what
[1:11:30] they were writing or what they were
[1:11:32] singing or they were the noise I've said
[1:11:34] it if they understood it but the Bible
[1:11:37] said they were moved
[1:11:39] by the Holy Ghost
[1:11:41] moved he said when the Holy Ghost move
[1:11:43] you you move
[1:11:45] so I can't preach but other people
[1:11:46] preaching because they preaching that I
[1:11:48] can't preach because everybody's saying

[1:12:24] of the word of God is rolling on
[1:12:28] hallelujah praise God praise God
[1:12:30] hallelujah let's continue the prophet
[1:12:33] writer
[1:12:34] must be in constant fellowship with the
[1:12:37] author
[1:12:39] he must live constantly in the presence
[1:12:41] of the altar to know what the book is
[1:12:43] going to be
[1:12:45] so not because he's a prophet he had to
[1:12:47] care about the presence and he ought to
[1:12:48] know he has to say constantly
[1:12:50] and the fellowship you see sometimes we
[1:12:52] miss process
[1:12:54] I think sometimes we talk about David
[1:12:56] and David is Anointed to be king
[1:12:59] but watch he says
[1:13:05] foreign
[1:13:06] so I'll kill him
[1:13:08] yeah you can't talk that talk he's not
[1:13:11] ready yet he's not mature enough yet he
[1:13:14] ain't qualified here God had to set him
[1:13:16] up
[1:13:17] isn't that right he's anointed but not
[1:13:20] yet appointed not yet ready Oh Glory to
[1:13:24] God and hear David going to process now

[1:13:31] between the Philistines on Israel I
[1:13:35] fight that Israel couldn't deal with

[1:17:33] this is foreign
[1:18:00] Lucifer son of the morning Hallelujah
[1:18:03] all in music and everything else but in
[1:18:05] his heart he had a desire to be like the
[1:18:08] most high to be like God and he preached
[1:18:11] and deceived two turns of the Angels
[1:18:13] praise God if they take they believe the
[1:18:15] devil's lie and you can't accept the
[1:18:17] devil's light until they reject God's
[1:18:18] truth a lot of people believe in lies
[1:18:21] now because they reject God's truth
[1:18:22] they'll be condemned by the lies that
[1:18:24] they believe God sent a prophet with
[1:18:26] original word we have no right to take
[1:18:28] but any man say okay the Lord I shout in
[1:18:32] the house
[1:18:34] who he is
[1:18:37] [Applause]
[1:18:45] hurry
[1:18:47] now watch he said when the prophet had
[1:18:50] his mind set constantly on what God Said
[1:18:53] not what man thought what the age
[1:18:56] thought what the church thought what the
[1:18:59] kingdom taught is what God taught he
[1:19:02] only expressed God thoughts to word
[1:19:04] because a word is the thought when it's
[1:19:06] expressed no the word is a thought
[1:19:08] expressed so the prophet was waiting for
[1:19:10] God's thoughts and when God revealed his
[1:19:13] thoughts to him he expressed it in the
[1:19:15] word does see at the Lord so when it
[1:19:18] dropped tongue into the prophet's heart
[1:19:19] you hear thus say of the Lord hallelujah
[1:19:21] praise God that's why the defied
[1:19:24] kingdoms and church Ages which to do in
[1:19:27] their day was a death penalty you woke
[1:19:29] up in a king's face and said don't say
[1:19:31] the Lord
[1:19:34] the church will put you to death right
[1:19:36] now for doing it but these prophets were
[1:19:37] bold why they were moved by the Holy
[1:19:41] Ghost
[1:19:42] [Applause]
[1:19:44] so what's the sense we know the date the
[1:19:47] Press coming
[1:19:48] we don't need documents they come in
[1:19:49] with we know what the order is and we
[1:19:52] have no power
[1:19:53] it's basically going to buy food and
[1:19:54] store it up
[1:19:56] for the tribulation then we are PPN to
[1:19:59] be tribulation seeds you have to be
[1:20:01] moved by the Holy Ghost when there was
[1:20:03] built in Stephen which Stones demons oh
[1:20:04] God says Lord don't put this charge on

[1:21:20] you're going
[1:21:22] God like Miss Heritage unto eagle
[1:21:25] because another thing the eagle does the
[1:21:27] eagle business we High
[1:21:30] I've got off from my horse many times
[1:21:32] and tied it to a little sapling and got
[1:21:35] my binoculars search the skies to find
[1:21:36] an eagle just to study him in the way
[1:21:38] high in the Rockies and Eagle business
[1:21:39] as high as he can build it why
[1:21:43] it is for safety and protection
[1:21:46] he is so high until the Predators can't
[1:21:48] get to him
[1:21:50] the coyote trying to come to the Eagle's
[1:21:52] Nest break his neck
[1:21:54] and that's the reason are you ready
[1:21:56] that's the reason God liked his church
[1:21:58] unto the eagle
[1:22:00] because the Eagle's Nest which is the
[1:22:01] church is built far beyond the case of
[1:22:04] this world
[1:22:05] out of the danger lines
[1:22:07] cross the blood where the modern
[1:22:10] prowling Predators never get to
[1:22:13] he said you are a city set on a hill
[1:22:15] foreign
[1:22:18] something the Church of the Living God
[1:22:20] is built high

[1:23:21] church
[1:23:24] the Church of the Living God has a high
[1:23:27] ambition
[1:23:29] other churches don't have to have any

[1:29:19] Church of the Living God can't set still
[1:29:24] can't

[1:29:46] and God is waiting for his people to
[1:29:48] call upon him to get God's civil action
[1:29:50] God but his prophecy said God and Moses

[1:53:06] no Lord take me through them
[1:53:10] a lot of Christians don't understand
[1:53:12] this
[1:53:14] a lot of people don't believe
[1:53:16] Romans 8 20th they know the scriptures
[1:53:18] they know what it said all things but
[1:53:19] they don't really believe all things
[1:53:21] what they really believe is good things
[1:53:23] work together for good
[1:53:25] yes yes
[1:53:27] I want you to think about that now what
[1:53:30] they really believe is good things work
[1:53:32] together for good to the middle of the
[1:53:33] Lord
[1:53:34] so whenever bad things come oh
[1:53:39] [Music]
[1:53:41] yeah another problem
[1:53:43] but the Bible said all things
[1:53:49] when Joseph Brothers Shoal him out
[1:53:52] all right well they put him in a pit on
[1:53:53] the black he did and whatnot and whatnot
[1:53:55] poor fella cried he was 17 years old or
[1:53:57] whatever right according to Egypt Newton
[1:53:59] new language learning everything else it
[1:54:02] looked critical crisis you look like oh

[1:54:05] sinful they're wicked men they've only
[1:54:07] catch them
[1:54:09] but it was looking for good because God
[1:54:12] was sending Joseph to Egypt
[1:54:15] to preserve life
[1:54:19] he is 17 he's unaware of his Destiny
[1:54:23] he's unaware of his purpose he's on our
[1:54:25] way of his calling he's unaware of his
[1:54:27] Destiny of what God called him to do
[1:54:30] God disguised it as brothers selling him
[1:54:32] out God disguised it by using jealousy
[1:54:35] as a tool
[1:54:37] as a chariot
[1:54:38] to get your name in position a city set
[1:54:42] in a hill

[2:00:33] he rejected there's a big one the
[2:00:36] original Vindicated word
[2:00:39] and those are people like when the moon
[2:00:40] says bring what kind of cuckoo
[2:00:42] Revolution the man make it up
[2:00:44] a man see it the prophet said you know
[2:00:47] the prophet is the man that sent from
[2:00:48] God to bring him manner for the Bride of
[2:00:51] Jesus Christ but they prefer some other
[2:00:52] man's word and what the prophet say
[2:00:55] he rejected what the original
[2:00:58] Vindicated word
[2:01:00] here we go as we hit the home stretch
[2:01:01] here now
[2:01:04] go tell Elijah as your lord slave it and
[2:01:07] I'll not leave you he went to the school
[2:01:09] of the Prophet second stage of the
[2:01:10] journey he went to Jordan from there
[2:01:12] stay here while I go to Jordan as Lord
[2:01:14] liveth I'll not leave you a type of the
[2:01:16] true church following Jesus Christ
[2:01:18] I went across Jordan Jordan means debt
[2:01:21] because Joy what would you have me to do
[2:01:23] he said a double portion of your spirit
[2:01:25] be sent upon me
[2:01:28] he said yeah it's a great thing
[2:01:30] you ready now God wants us to ask for
[2:01:33] big things
[2:01:40] wish I had some kind of technology to
[2:01:42] find all the temperature like when
[2:01:44] people were saying amen how much
[2:01:45] percentage
[2:01:47] [Music]
[2:01:50] people like they don't want to say
[2:01:55] um
[2:01:57] God wants us to ask for big things man
[2:02:00] he said God he don't run out of
[2:02:03] blessings up there
[2:02:04] you can't ask for too much
[2:02:06] [Applause]
[2:02:15] he don't run out
[2:02:17] the car asks too much when they even
[2:02:20] start to draw down he said my cup
[2:02:22] run it over
[2:02:24] David keep on asking and when was at the
[2:02:27] dump itself Not only was his cup full
[2:02:29] his cop ran over he said
[2:02:31] the water got in the sauce I know
[2:02:33] Hallelujah went back that's when you cop
[2:02:36] ran over they're drinking from the
[2:02:38] saucer hey because your cop ran over
[2:02:41] Give the Lord some praises
[2:02:45] oh my
[2:02:46] God he said you can't ask too much he
[2:02:48] said could you you can't ask for too
[2:02:50] much could you imagine a little fish
[2:02:51] about that long in the middle of the
[2:02:53] ocean since I better not drink much of
[2:02:54] this water because it might go dry
[2:02:56] that's just as unreasonable as it was to
[2:02:59] to think that God blessings would be
[2:03:01] ever be exhausted to the Believers all
[2:03:04] Heaven belongs to you and when he
[2:03:06] answered the proportion he said he acts
[2:03:07] are hurting
[2:03:08] but if you see me when I go you'll have
[2:03:11] it
[2:03:11] now the Bible wants us let me say it
[2:03:14] again
[2:03:14] the Bible wants us to ask for big things
[2:03:19] not to be satisfied Lord here I belong
[2:03:22] to a church no that's enough no that's
[2:03:24] not enough for me I want to do something
[2:03:26] else I want greetings well Lord by his
[2:03:29] grace I claim a million souls for Christ
[2:03:31] in my own individual Ministry a million
[2:03:35] even a million Souls of Christ I'm not
[2:03:38] satisfied with that I want two or three
[2:03:40] million Souls
[2:03:44] [Applause]
[2:03:55] for some people
[2:03:59] somebody said when you come to the money
[2:04:01] you don't have money yet
[2:04:02] the people who have real money for them
[2:04:07] anytime you continue your money you
[2:04:08] ain't starting to get money yet
[2:04:11] are you counting it
[2:04:12] them guys
[2:04:22] there's a scripture is a straight
[2:04:23] scripture
[2:04:25] a scripture man was about to get fired
[2:04:28] and he went and tell all the people and
[2:04:29] only Master he said how much you owe him
[2:04:32] you're 100 pay 50.
[2:04:33] yeah 10 55. and Jesus commended the man
[2:04:38] for his his holy describing
[2:04:41] for for the kind of wisdom then I'm just
[2:04:43] the king
[2:04:48] Kingdom because that man make people pay
[2:04:51] half that when he leave I get fired he
[2:04:53] have friends
[2:04:56] that would deal with him
[2:04:57] and Jesus was talking about how that man
[2:05:00] operate and he said the children of this
[2:05:02] world is wiser than the children of the
[2:05:04] Kingdom don't act like a fool
[2:05:06] or give the Lord some praise against the
[2:05:08] Lord a shout

[2:10:12] mustard seed
[2:10:13] get out there to some other kind of
[2:10:15] faith move out in big things big things
[2:10:18] is just as easy to receive as other
[2:10:19] things
[2:10:24] we should be shutting down service right
[2:10:26] now when you hear that you can't wait to

[2:10:51] all right
[2:10:54] I want to read this part again big teams
[2:10:57] is just as easy to receive
[2:11:00] as little things you just have to
[2:11:03] believe that's all God expects his
[2:11:06] children to trust him for everything
[2:11:08] that they have
[2:11:09] but we want to trust the hand of man
[2:11:12] I rather have my horse built on Christ
[2:11:14] take in my solemn stand upon his grace
[2:11:17] and mercy than any educated group of
[2:11:19] people who were former organizations say
[2:11:21] this is the way Christ said I am the way
[2:11:24] the truth the light no man cometh to the
[2:11:26] father except for me God dwells moves
[2:11:30] Works in mankind God doesn't work
[2:11:33] through orders he doesn't work through
[2:11:35] organization he works through
[2:11:37] individuals God works in man God doesn't
[2:11:41] do the work today he energizes or
[2:11:43] projects his Spirit into men to do so
[2:11:46] I am divine Divine don't bear fruit
[2:11:50] ye are the branches
[2:11:52] praise God as David duplessis said to me
[2:11:54] one at noon if these lazy Pentecostal
[2:11:57] people would get up and do something
[2:11:58] instead of trying to take a ringside
[2:12:00] seat and watch God do it the church will
[2:12:02] be moving on
[2:12:03] you see I think that's right
[2:12:04] get up and move
[2:12:07] God are you ready
[2:12:09] God is expecting you you are the
[2:12:12] branches your hands is his hands
[2:12:15] your lips is his lips
[2:12:17] your thoughts is his thoughts as I said
[2:12:20] last night Nathan said to David do all
[2:12:22] of this in your heart for God is with
[2:12:24] you
[2:12:25] God is with his people in his people God
[2:12:28] in your hope of glory god is in his
[2:12:30] people Tabernacle
[2:12:31] once in this pure unadulterated body of
[2:12:35] the Lord Jesus by virgin put that blood
[2:12:38] cell was broke and he made a way you
[2:12:40] couldn't do it you couldn't Merit it but
[2:12:42] he merited your rights and called after
[2:12:44] dwelling in Christ given himself as a
[2:12:45] ransom for reconciliation to bring man
[2:12:48] and God together Unite with them again
[2:12:49] when the Dove and the lamb come together
[2:12:52] him would kiss our body close
[2:12:55] any civilized normal mind knows that we
[2:12:59] are at the end of something
[2:13:00] civilization can't stand any longer she
[2:13:03] is just weaving and shaking What's it
[2:13:06] waiting for it is way past you I want
[2:13:09] these are Noah long-suffering in
[2:13:11] leftover for the elect's sake
[2:13:13] God
[2:13:15] is waiting
[2:13:17] to get his church in order
[2:13:20] he is waiting on you and I
[2:13:23] God
[2:13:24] is written
[2:13:26] watch this
[2:13:28] he says no
[2:13:30] you see the great solar system speaks of
[2:13:32] Christ everything that you see speaks of
[2:13:35] Christ if you just look at it look at
[2:13:36] the church today on its condition weak
[2:13:38] vaccine going back into the world that
[2:13:41] speaks of Christ exactly what he said he
[2:13:43] stand the door and knock put outside or
[2:13:45] organize him out he's trying to cut them
[2:13:49] down and bring them to a spot here we go
[2:13:51] where the great Capstone comes
[2:13:56] the ministry that's in the church
[2:14:00] and the Capstone will come right
[2:14:03] straight together like a magnet
[2:14:05] they will just seal right in together
[2:14:07] God help us
[2:14:10] it will be there don't worry it will be
[2:14:12] there he said it would be there for us
[2:14:14] to fit ourselves to meet that
[2:14:17] Cornerstone
[2:14:18] so we see now that all this preparation
[2:14:20] is to meet the Cornerstone the Capstone
[2:14:22] that she stole himself
[2:14:25] Oh Glory to God almost done you know
[2:14:29] there's a paradox to do
[2:14:31] his program he took an old man eight
[2:14:33] years old Moses never put a sword in his
[2:14:34] hand or Crooked Stick and sunk Egypt in
[2:14:37] the bottom of the Dead Sea incredible
[2:14:38] what God can do he uses a paradox to do
[2:14:41] it he brings it to a paradox a Crooked
[2:14:45] Stick of a Shepherd instead of a
[2:14:47] matching Army a nation rule by the world
[2:14:49] you'll begin to play something again
[2:14:52] the only thing God is waiting on now I
[2:14:54] believe Russia don't mean nothing to God
[2:15:00] you hear that
[2:15:02] Russia don't mean nothing to God he
[2:15:05] wants to get one man
[2:15:07] he don't have to have big organizations
[2:15:09] he don't have to have big denominations
[2:15:11] he wants to get one man that he could
[2:15:14] wrap his Spirit into him that will tell
[2:15:16] the rest of it there will be another
[2:15:18] Paradox until he can get someone
[2:15:21] completely surrendered that will do that
[2:15:24] that's the way God does
[2:15:28] God is waiting to find somebody it's not
[2:15:32] too unusual to that they can be Anointed
[2:15:34] with the Holy Ghost to prove that Jesus
[2:15:37] Christ is the same yesterday to them
[2:15:39] forever to be a Shining Light to Blind
[2:15:42] the eyes of the unbeliever and that they
[2:15:44] would blaspheme and bring Justice upon
[2:15:46] them
[2:15:46] oh my I am done
[2:15:48] friends
[2:15:50] Jesus said you are City
[2:15:52] that is set on a hill

[2:16:18] them on that Hill set to shine light to
[2:16:20] the rest
