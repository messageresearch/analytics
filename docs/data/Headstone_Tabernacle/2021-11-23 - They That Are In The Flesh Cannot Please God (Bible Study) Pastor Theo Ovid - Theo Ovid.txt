forget that we forget that this is not where we belong we're just passing true father john said he saw a new heaven and a new earth and that is what we're going to come back to but this world as we know it will feed i would pass away father maybe study your word tonight and see the things that are eternal see the things that are real see the things that will remain forever granted father and jesus we ask it email an amen god bless you and welcome certainly appreciate you coming out here tonight uh to be with us as we want to share the word of god i trust in that uh the couple of messages and bible studies have been edified and helpful to you i believe the last thing we spoke in bible study was about a glorious church without spot or wrinkle and this is god's vision of the church nothing less than that he is going to have a glorious church lord's puerto rican i was wondering you know what to follow and up after that because that was speaking about this church this bride this uh this just what what what is called female in designation the bride of jesus christ and we give some old testament references to what god sees as a woman as a bride as a wife and everything else but tonight we want to go into the new testament we're going to see the new testament tonight and we want to zero in on the individual the people who want to be part of that bright body who are interested in being that part of the pride body who want to get rid of what they in this is for you tonight it's not a general thing it's specific very specific and you will be instructed by the scriptures tonight i don't even have to say much but the scriptures that would speak to itself so tonight we want to go straight into uh what we have to share i'd like you to turn your bibles to romans chapter eight you want to read verse 1 to 10 romans chapter 8 familiar scripture verse 1. could you just actually excuse me one second please okay there is therefore now no condemnation to them which in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus had made me free from the law of sin and death for what the law could not do in that it was weak to the flesh god sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemns sin in the flesh that the righteousness of the lord might be fulfilling us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit now that verse was for the righteousness of the law might be fulfilling us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit and the amplified it says so that the righteous and just requirement of the law might be fully met in us who live and move not in the ways of the flesh but in the ways of the spirit our lives governed not by the standards and according to the details of the flesh but controlled by the holy spirit verse 5 for they that are after the flesh to mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit so it have to they dear they who after the flesh and they who are after the spirit and the amplified it expresses this this way for those who are according to the flesh are controlled by its unholy desires set their minds on and pursue those things which gratify the flesh but those who are according to the spirit are controlled by the desires of the spirit set their minds on and seek those things which gratify the holy spirit verse 6 for to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually binded is life and peace amplified expresses that now the mind of the flesh which is sense and reason without the holy spirit is dead death that comprises all the miseries arising from sin both here and hereafter but the mind of the holy spirit is life and soul peace but now and forever seven because the carnal mind is enmity against god or like an enemy of god for it is not subject to the law of god neither indeed can be so then they that are in the flesh cannot please god that is amplified because the mind of the flesh which is kind of thoughts and purposes is hostile to god for it does not submit itself to the law god's law indeed it cannot so then those who are living the life of the flesh catering to the appetites and impulses of their carnal nature cannot please or satisfy god or be acceptable to him and the title that i have tonight is d that are in the flesh cannot please god and this is where i got it from which is verse 8 these are in the flesh cannot please god in other words those who are catering to the appetites and the impulses of the khana nature but you are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of god dwell in you and if any man have not the spirit of christ he is none of his and if christ being new the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness now you know sometimes you could read scriptures and just read it like if it's a text just like you know words but the bible actually says to be carnally minded is death and to be spiritually minded is life and peace and we have to begin to take what god say as what god means if he means to be kindly minded is that it means just that that's nothing to do with any message what i believe is not a confession of what you believe or a confession of belief but it's what you applying to your heart and you'll realize tonight that paul is speaking to christians he's speaking to people who came to the lord and in church he's addressing their issues he's addressing their challenges he's not saying you are all right because you receive christ because i'm seeing it this way when you give your heart to the lord it's coming like you can invite christ in your porch he's not aldia you invite him he's in your porch but he wants to come in all the rooms the bedroom the living room the kitchen around the yard in your inner chambers you want to be there is where you want to invite him and you have an opportunity for him not just to be safe here but him to be lord so i think that this is something that if you really want to go deeper in god then you would see the need to apply what you're hearing from the scriptures to your very own life and not just be sitting hearing hearing hearing and believing what you're hearing and not connecting it to apply life or like but i would like to say all things pertaining to life and godliness this is what the gospel come to do because become that this word could become flesh in us that is what that is about now galatians 5. we want to read from 16 to 26 and we want to check out what paul spoke to the galatians as the works of the flesh so this is galatians chapter 5 in the bible verse 16 this i see then she's paul exalted walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the loss of the flesh so if you could get an order to walk in the spirit that means somebody could walk in the flesh now he's talking to christians i want you to get this he's not talking to unbelievers he's not talking to sinners he's talking to believers and he's exhorting them to walk in the spirit that you fulfill not the lust of the flesh 4 17 the flesh lusted against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh and these are contrary to one to the other so you cannot do the things that you would so he's showing here a war is going on between the flesh and the spirit don't tell me it's not going on because the word is self-identifying is a war 18 but if you be led of the spirit you are not under the law and verse 19 is where he started drill down in the works of the flesh now the works of the flesh are manifest which are these adultery fornication uncleanness laziousness and in the amplified they said no doing practices of flesh are clear and obvious they are immorality impurity indecency verse 20 it when did you say idolatry witchcraft that's right witchcraft hatred variants emulations rat strife seditions and heresies now sometimes i wish we could go down in detail of every one of these descriptions but i'll just give it in the amplified because it's important that you understand the depth of what is identified as the works of the flesh the amplified identifies idolatry sorcery enmity strife jealousy anger which is ill-tempered selfishness yes divisions dissensions people breaking away in our corner party spirit factions and sex with peculiar opinions and heresies all of that is works of the flesh verse 21 went on to speak about envyings murders drunkness revelant and such like and it comes with a warning this is the believers and in this package of identifying the works of the flesh community warning and such like of the witch i tell you before as i have also told you in times past that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of god let me read that again of the which i tell you before as i have told also told you in times past that day which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of god that is plain as spain can be it have no ifs it has no bots it's plain as that so what it means is that this thing called whatever calling the books of the flesh that's what christ come to die to people that we could have conquer all these behaviors in all our hearts in our lives no and he says now verse 22 he's switching over so identify the works of the flesh he said but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace long suffering not short suffering long suffering gentleness goodness faith meekness temperance against such there is no law and they that are christ have crucified the flesh with the affections and lust not only amplified that verse 24 said and those who belong to christ jesus the messiah have crucified the flesh the godless human nature with his passions appetites and desires now that is what we are born with that is what we have passions appetites desires filthy torts 30 desires unholy torch this is built in but coming to christ get give us our opportunity to be listen carefully to be fire bombed that these things could get bomb out of us or the grip of the enemy upon our lives could be broken and it's important to see it that way because remember we were born in shape iniquity but that is not how god come for let us remain it come that we could get that yoke bondage broken off of us that we can live the abundance no the word in itself washing will be cleansed by the washing of the water by the word but the operation of the spirit fire fire is to really burn and cleanse and that is where the seraphs comes in they are the burners that prepares the worshiper to come into god's presence so it's uh it's a it's much more beyond the letter and you know in this intellectual age with the increase of knowledge people have moved away from the spirit and they move into a level of intellectualism no intellectualism is a powerful thing because intellectualism is like knowledge glorified without god because intellectualism is putting things together from the human standpoint so god not really in it in that sense it could be nice words and fancy explanations but it's not god breathe you see and the bible talks about holy men moved by the holy ghost and every scripture is given by inspiration every scripture is god breathed so this is what the spirit is therefore to breathe and bring life by the word because the letter killer but the spirit is what brings life so trust tonight that you begin to take a closer look at what we are saying tonight about those that are in the flesh and those that in the spirit that for the fruit of the spirit okay now and those who belong to christ jesus the messiah have crucified the flesh the godless human nature with his passions and appetites and desires and verse 25 said if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit so that is very interesting how he presented that if we live in the spirit let us also walk in a sprint so there is a way to walk and the amplifier is if we live by the holy spirit let us walk by the spirit if by the holy spirit we have our life in god let us go forward walking in line or conduct control by the holy spirit verse 26 let us not be desires of vain glory for walking one another and being one another no he is not talking about unbelievers i want to get that he's talking about true truth folks he's talking about church people and he amplified let us not become vainglorious and self-conceited competitive and challenging and provoking and irritating to one another envying and the jealous of one another all this is church folks challenging provoking irritate envian being jealous praise alone second corinthians chapter 10 have your bibles nearby you're running a course tonight and you see how it goes present blessed being in the flow second corinthians chapter 10 paul speaks but i beseech you that i may not be bold when i'm present without confidence wherein i think to be bold against some which think of us as if we walk according to the flesh and paul bringing our balance as he always does and this is in verse 3. for though we walk in the flesh not being fleshly now we in this flesh do we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty true god to the pulling down of strongholds cast in dung imaginations and every high thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of god and bringing in the captivity every thought to the obedience of christ now you could see by the way paul is presenting this he is actually showing that this is operational in other words this is not like some esoteric or some kind of fan down good thought or just an imagination or some uh uh deep mystery he is saying watch by casting down imaginations he's actually doing that and every high thing that exhausted itself against the knowledge of god and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of christ now let's read this in the amplified for though we walk or live in the flesh we are not carrying on our warfare according to the flesh and using mere humans weapons for the weapons of our warfare are not physical weapons of flesh and blood but they are mighty before god for the overthrow and destruction of strongholds in as much as we refute arguments and theories and reasoning and every proud and lofty thing that sets itself up against the true knowledge of god and we lead every thought and purpose away captive into obedience of christ jesus so you could see could you see yourself being that type of active christian to walk in the spirit actively pursuing god like jesus said this way if any man come after me i just love that let him deny himself take up his cross and follow me he didn't see if any man is in church people love church church they love church they sit in church but we're not talking about church now if any man come after me you are pursuing him you are going after him you want to be like him you want to walk like him you want to talk like him you want to live like him you want to relate to others like him and i share this with somebody that you know um everybody had their limits and i have minds too and i was thinking of you know speaking of seeing certain things some ministers and stuff and to really kind of rough things up you know with you know when i had enough of the foolishness and so on and i find myself asking myself if jesus would see it that way and i find that's very interesting because i know i know to you of it i know how he will see things i know how he could react and so now when i think it over i said no jesus would not say that and i said myself if jesus will not say it i will not say it and i find that was a good experience to me because i'm not saying i'm not trying to to do it my way i'm trying to catch how would christ act how would christ see could i see it better you know paul said before i show you a more excellent way do i speak with the tongues women angels have their charity and so on and when it comes across like that you always find yourself looking not just for a we but is there a better way for husbands for wives for marriages for parenting how we do what we do is there a better way that it could be done yes you did it it's fear it's okay but could it have been done better is there a better approach and to me this have to be something in our hearts that this is me i gotta take me as i am no no no no that is really you intrude that is you in your flesh you in your flesh see i in my flesh but how would christ act and this is what we all have to come to amen praise the lord okay let's go to uh colossians chapter 3. you want to read lengthy scripture from one when we down to 15 and we would see how that goes colossians chapter 3. this is paul getting down now you would see how he's switching and he's is a continuity it's it's a continuing line that paul is presenting to the believers of their walk with god of their their willful decisions and actions in this kingdom and i'm seeing that because in the journey from egypt to the promised land manna fell from heaven goats and queens and get them meat and water and everything else but when they got into the land they had us to take their land little by little and mana ceased to fall in that land so anybody coming into the land and they don't expect to get a hoe and the fork and all the instruments to do work to clean up the land being problems in trouble when they think and you know come to jesus everything's going to be fine and they expect manager for from heaven with the final that they're getting seed to plant and they have a ground to till and labor and work and they're not prepared for that that will be problems but look at paul in colossians 3 verse one said if you be risen with christ seek those things which are above now this is active this is not passive this is not the past i have the mysteries and once you have the right pastor you're you're safe this is poor exhorting them seek those things which are above where christ sits in the right hand of god or you're christian all right smoking drinking partying whatever it is your mind on things out there this is the natural life here goes to set your affection on things above not on things on the earth you know you could set tuna washing machines and be stove set this set that whatever it is set an alarm just set it you actually pre-program it yes rest there i want to go in that direction he said set your affections on things above other things of the earth for you are dead and your life is healed with christ in god and when christ who is our life shall appear then shall he also appear with him in glory now this is the verse i want to get to this is the first i want to go to this fight it says mortified therefore your members which are upon the earth fornication uncleanness in ordinate affection evil concussed percents and consciousness which is idolatry that word mortify amplified in the amplified it says so kill i say modify deaden the price of power the evil desire looking in your members those animal impulses and all that is easily in you that is employed in sin sexual vice impurity sensual happy tax desires and all greed and consciousness for that is idolatry the define of self and other created things instead of god let's read it again motif idea for your members which are upon the earth who is to do that i could modify your members or what you think about could a pastor modify somebody else member no that is you that is what you have to do that is what i have to do that is what we all must do mortify your members nobody could do that for you as a husband your wife can't do that for you if you want to go lusting she can't stop you as a wife your husband cannot do that for you if you want to go lusting he cannot stop that from you you have to have a desire in your heart to bring your members in subjection to god's plan and god's program praise the lord but this community warning so this is not um how they say it's not buffy style you know i i don't want that tonight you know i it could do with some some trumpets and some vials and some woo i want to hear about a new name to them that will come all right fine for which things seek this is verse 6 the wrath of god comment on the children of disobedience also wait a minute it's not just coming to church that's right it's not just i believe that's right are you going to come to the spot where you have to accept now you know wait a minute wait a minute i have to do that yes it's like man know thyself you have to understand how your body works you have to understand what is make a trip you just have to understand you know like the guy he got delivered he came to the lord and he stopped drinking and smoking but any time he passed by which by the making manufacturing drinks it was wiped him out does he smell because he he was under that influence just like the girl who was in partying and whatnot and she passing dear you know something tell her go and testify does he say tonight sit and try to get back in the airport we come out of all kind of stuff and the devil's job is to get you back into that happens it's not hard to do that the example is in the scriptures jesus called all these brothers out of fishing and whatnot but three and a half years he's just pumping wood pumping miracles uh taking them anointing them blessing them and they're seeing all kind of stuff but when jesus died and he prophesied to them he told them the son of man he'd wear the whole hug the whole scroll and once they see my wrong guess what peter said go fishing and they all say we go fishing they went back to fishing after three and a half years not with a pastor not with a teacher not with the evangelist but with the lord himself the messiah they backslid and went back to the original estate the original position that he pulled them out from and jesus knowing flesh is flesh he came and said sharon are you any meat and the confession was we we fish all night and caught nothing and you give them a word cashing it to the right side these guys are facing yes something tell them is truth coming forth the word coming forward and they will be and they got the fish jesus still was concerned about them because they knew they were foreknown of god but he knew they're not they have to come into shape they have to come into position they are not there yet they are still walking in the flesh isn't that something peter you'll deny me hallelujah peter you remind me but after you're converted i want you to distract me you'll fall i'm saying that so it's not as if he doesn't know that you are in the flesh or you walk in the flesh it's not that you but it's what you lean into because how the tree leans is we're gonna form so you have to come to this spot like we shared in some bible study the beauty of holiness you have to come to that spot where you could raise your hands sincerely and say lord i worship you in the beauty of holiness isn't that a beautiful thing that you could say i worship you in the beauty of holiness jesus told his crime and pharisees your teachings and your doctrine make the word of non-effect what i want to see and what i would love to see is this word having an effect upon your everyday life that your wife will know your husband will know your children now your neighbor your co-workers anybody you come in contact with you will know that what you are hearing what you are being taught what you are doing what you are reading and studying you are applying it to your heart and to your life oh blessed be name of the lord so it says for the which things seek the wrath of god comment on children of disobedience and the amplified say it is on account of these very sins that the holy anger of god is ever coming upon the sons of disobedience those who are abstinently opposed to the divine will now i believe in the old testament god judge the two sons of the earth fool around and a priesthood god come and judge a nasty sapphire and there's a prophecy that will repeat again in the last days because people think it's church when the pendulum is swinging to god's mind and god's peoples and plan as we said in one bible teaching that the reason and national fire was judged not for god to show he's a judge he is a judge but he wanted to keep the church clean this was the miss this was the most important thing to keep the church pure to keep the church clean and he's the same yesterday today and forever now verse seven that same scripture in which he also walked some time when you lived in them so that was supposed to be passed and paul is saying okay used to live contrary and live rebellious disobedient but verse 8 he said but no you also have to put off these things anger rat malice blasphemy filthy communications out of your mouth so he's adding to it adding to what they were living in amplified of that verse it says but now put away and rid yourselves completely of these things anger bridge bad feeling towards others curses are in slander and full mouth abuse and shameful utterance from your lips i don't remember the early days in the early days was sword fighting you know when you meet bredrin it's so generous and it was crazy because it had no bragging kindness it had no love with it it's just trying to find the crudest rudest way to save something and you would chop somebody down and every time they meet it's like cling clang is like sword fighting and you know you look back now and see it was so vile in those times because it wasn't about the grace of god the love of god it wasn't about redemption and people not understanding what the will of the lord is it's a matter of you are right and you are arrogant with your rightness and you are dead wrong by your heart of arrogance because one once the one thing god hate is pride and arrogance that is ice problems because that's what lucifer in the beginning and you as a christian could actually go in the wrong direction because you can become self-righteous and self-righteous is a religious sinner you see because they can't tell them anything and they could judge others there are people who right now who be on the righteous force judging everything right now and they're on their own but when you understand and grasp the grace of god that you see who we phone you call we call it justified we justify you're very glorified and he'll leave all that sanctification part leave all that labor part in that scripture justified glorified and that middle part is where we are at is what we have to do in our sanctification in our modification in our cleansing in our application to what god tells us other than that if this is not truth all we have to do is believe i believe a prophet i believe um you know what what what the prophet said and that's it just a belief that is no different from the catholic scene the apostle creed that is no different from all these novenas and hilly mary and just reading stuff and believe that because you read these stuff or see it many times you're safe you're fine that's not different from that it's just in a modernized and a modern way okay so what so put away these things all right put away completely anger rage bad feeling towards others curses flanders fall mouth abuse and shameful utterances from your lips so it's night lying not one to another seeing that you have put off the old man with his deeds and have put on the new man which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created this verse to me is very important and you have put on the new man which is renewed in knowledge so whereas before smoking drinking carrying on you didn't have the knowledge and the information now it's there so watch amplified of that one and have clothed yourself with the new spiritual self which is ever in i love this how this is placed and have clothed yourself with the new spiritual self which is ever in the process of being renewed and removed into fuller and more perfect knowledge upon knowledge after the image the likeness of him who created unlike that the process of being renewed the process of being remolded into a fuller and more perfect knowledge i call the prophet said we know in part and prophesy in part but when that is perfect is come and he said that is from partial realization into full realization because we know in part but we are going to be brought from partial realization into full realization and you could see what jesus said when he said in john 14 20 at that day you shall know i am in the father in me and i knew so that would be a good point for us and then you could connect that ephesians 4 till we all come into the unity of the fate the knowledge of the son of god onto a perfect man unto the fullness of the measure of the statue of christ so that is the stature of perfection isn't that wonderful tonight oh blessed give the lord some praises blessed be the name of the lord so watch verse 11 paul hitler at home here now and there is neither greek nor jew circumcision or uncircumcision barbarian skintion bond nor free but christ is all and in all then he comes back verse 12 put on therefore a hell and not believe put on therefore as the elect of god holy and beloved bowels of mercies kindness humbleness of mind meekness and long suffering now you know there are some people naturally natural they are kind helpful there are some people as mean as the devil and they come to church no offense they're terrible and um but god called them but here it is just as we would talk about when you bring your invitation in the wedding and those in the new testament the eastern philosophy we in the eastern way you get a garment and everybody gets the same garnet and they don't know if you are rich or poor if you have one clothing no whatever it is everybody has the same garment and they found the guy in there without the garment the man said by the hand and foot throw him out because he comes some other way once you come to the door you get that gun so this is it here now you have to be rubed so it's not a matter well she kind and not so kind she's soft-hearted i heart-hearted no no this is the order here this is the order here put on therefore as the elect of god holy and beloved powers of mercedes kindness humbleness of mind meekness long suffering and the amplified is expressive industry include yourselves therefore as god's own chosen ones his own picked representatives who are purified and holy and well beloved by god himself by putting on behavior marked by tender hearted pity and mercy kind feeling a lowly opinion of yourself that's a big big big one a lowly opinion of yourselves gentle ways and patience which is tireless and long-suffering and has the power to endure whatever comes with good temper blistering in your bible for bearing one another forgiving one another if any man had a quarrel against any he must christ forgive you so also do we be amplified be gentle and forbearing with one another and if one has a difference a grievance or complaint against another really pardoning each other even as the lord has freely forgiven you so must you also forgive verse 14 says above all things put on charity which is the bond of perfectness and let the peace of god rule in your hearts to which also you are called in one body and be careful all blessed be the name of the lord so that is colossians let's go back to romans 8 and we want to go from 12 to 14. so i know it's police are slipping away and i i i i felt like to do it this way we go back to romans 8 but we want to read from verse 12 to 14. dear for brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh for if you live after the flesh ye shall die that is specific but if you through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body you shall live and then is a familiar scripture in verse 14 as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god now remember they that are in the flesh cannot please god because they cannot be subject to god and yet they could sit down in church and say what they believe but they are not in subjection to god or man they in no subjection anybody they actually go by their own thoughts and you hear me sometimes of time say they is not the god of the bible the servant they are serving the god of their own imagination or the god of their own mind or whatever god or spirit they serve and telling them that they are right sometimes they sit down in the congregation and they judge the preacher as wrong and they are taught as right because they've seen it so and they're getting in so and they don't even understand that is not god at all is a god of their own imagination they that and their flesh cannot please god now let's read and amplify this romans 8 12 so then brethren we are debtors but not to the flesh we are not obligated to our carnal nature to live a life ruled by the standards set up by the dictates of the flesh so the flesh is the boss manual i want you to see that that's why i had to modify i had to arrest him that's why i had to buy him and lock him up because he does dictate he has given orders are you with me tonight how many being uh 85 from this tonight the flesh is a ruler that's why the exhortation is to arrest him as a motivation to to take away his power to deaden it that is what all that is about okay so let's continue here now watch so brethren we are debtors but not to the flesh we are not obligated to our carnal nature live a life rule by the standards set up by the dictates of the flesh but if you live according to the dictates of the flesh you will surely die that's something like god maybe but if you through the power of the holy spirit you are here we go habitually put into debt and making extinct deadening the evil deeds prompted by the body you shall really and genuinely live forever for all who are led by the spirit of god are the sons of god oh praise god so and i want to go to ephesians four you do have to find this one because i'm going to read all of this from the amplified ephesians 4 maybe later on i'm going to put out the all these scriptures and stuff so basically check it out afterwards but ephesians 4 17 to 27 i want to read it straight from the amplifier for this i say and solemnly testify in the name of the lord as in his presence that you must no longer live as the hidden the gentiles do in their perverseness in the folly vanity and emptiness of their souls and futility of their minds their moral understanding is darkened their reason is be clouded they are alienated extreme self-banished from the life of god with no shame this is because of the ignorance the want of knowledge and perception the willful blindness that is deep seated in them due to their hardness of heart to the insensitiveness of their moral nature verse 19 the amplifier be continued in their spiritual apathy they have become colors and past feeling unreckless and have abandoned themselves i pray to unbridled sensuality eager and greedy to indulge in every form of impurity that their depraved desires may suggest and demand but you did not so live in christ assuming that you have really heard him and have been taught by him as all truth is in jesus embodied and fun sonified in him strip yourselves of your former nature hallelujah put off and discard your unrenewed self which characterize your previous manner of life and becomes corrupt through lust and desires that spring from delusion and be constantly of the start renewed in the spirit of your mind having a fresh mental and spiritual attitude and put on the new nature the regenerate self created in god's image god like into righteousness and holiness therefore rejecting all falsity and being done now with it that everyone expressed the truth with his neighbor for we are all parts of one body and members of one another so in other words you don't have to hum and hold well and you're bobbing and you're ducking in your weaving because you want to see what you should see no it says stay true even it's against you it's still the truth because if you're lying you ought to see a next lighting called the first line and then you have to see a kid like the color of the second night right now finish you have a lot of number of likes guys see the bible already clearly see but he's not the unbelievers put away lying okay let's continue therefore rejecting all falsity and being done now with it that everyone expressed the truth with his neighbor for all parts of one body are members of one another when angry do not sin do not let your wrath your exasperation your fury or your indignation last until the sun goes down leave no such room or football for the devil give no opportunity to him so the bible says resist the devil isha free romans 6 so go back we'll hit roman 6 now 15 to 23. you could find it romans chapter 6 your bible is dear sword sharpen romans 6 50. what then shall we sin because we are not under the law but under grace god forbid knowing not that to whom you yield yourself servants to obey his servants he are to whom you will be whether of sin unto death or obedience under righteousness amplified of 16 says do you not know that if you continually surrender yourself to anyone to do his will you are the slaves of him whom you will be whether that to be sin which leads to debt or to obedience which leads to righteousness right doing and right standing with god so listen whichever side is two sides flesh and spirit and which side you will be is who's in charge of you if you're following through with the details of the flesh then you're a slave of that if you're following through with the peace of the spirit then you are subject to the spirit i want you to get that tonight so in your heart you have to have a strong desire to be under obedience unto righteousness verse 17 says but god be thanked that you were servants of sins were but you have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered to you let's see what that isn't amplified but thank god though you were once slaves of sin you have become obedient with all your heart to the standard of teaching in which you were instructed unto which you were committed being then made free from sin you become the servants of righteousness you can't have both free from sin you become a servant of righteousness you can't serve two masters at the same time hallelujah oh it's not wonderful tonight you've got some priests hallelujah you're here to serve christ the messiah all right so paul says here verse 18. i want to read it again being made free from sin you became the servants of righteousness and the ambly fight says i haven't been set free from sin you have become the servants of righteousness get us of conformity to the divine will in thought purpose verse 19 i speak after the man of men because of the infirmity of your flesh but as you have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity even so now he's given instructions even now yield your members servants to righteousness underwhelming and amplified we continue i'm speaking in familiar human terms because of your natural limitations for as you yielded your bodily members and faculties as servants to impurity and ever increasing lawlessness so now yield your bodily members and faculties once for all are servants of righteousness right being and doing which leads to sanctification verse 20 for when you were servants of sin you were free from righteousness what fruit had he in those things where of you are now ashamed for the end of those things is dead but now being made free from sin and become servants to god you have your fruit unto holiness and the end everlasting life for the wages of sin is death but the gift of god is eternal life to jesus christ our lord and now we go back to galatians chapter 6 which i want you to find i want to read verse 7 to 10 then galatians chapter 6 verse 7 to 10. and verse 7 says be no deceived god is not mocked for whatsoever a man swear that shall he also reap for he that swear to the flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption he that swear to the spirit shall the spirit reap life everlasting so wait a minute you could sow to the flesh of course you can sow to the spirit of course what you read what you look at but so to the flesh if you go and look at pornography that will source in the flesh and you'll reap what harvest that comes up if you read the bible read the word of god and study the word of god that will suit the spirit is the environment you want to be in if you're lusting after a woman you're lusting after this you want to go and scoot for the world just be at the edge there in your dress in your way and compromising in the conversation yeah you could sow to the flesh and you could switch to the spirit i mean say it again you can sow to the flesh and you could sow to the spirit you mean is that real of course that has nothing to do with what is preaching behind the pulpit that has to do with you applying the word to your heart and getting the results from it so so that brings it personal now you understand what i'm saying this is not a big complicated mystery and to give you a headache and you don't understand it and you're catching it and whatnot no this is the scriptures this is the foundation that we are built upon the apostles and the doctrine of the apostles this is the foundation of it but i say make yourself a christian make yourself a christian i can give you a scripture his wife had made herself ready make yourself ready get ready be ready and stay ready make yourself a christian could we see amen tonight oh blessed be in the name of the lord so what he that swear to his flesh shall the flesh reap corruption he that swore to the spirit shall the spirit read life everlasting let us not be wary in for in due season we shall reap if we faint not as we have therefore opportunity let us do good unto all men especially them who are the household of faith let's read the flow of that in the amplifier i'm going to read it straight do not be deceived and deluded and misled god will not allow himself to be sneered at scorned disdained or mocked by mere pretentions or professions or by his precepts being set aside he inevitably deludes himself who attempts to delude god for whatever a man souls and that only is what he will be for he who sows to his own flesh his lower nature sensuality will from the flesh rip the key and ruin and destruction but he who sows to the spirit will from the spirit reap eternal life let us not lose heart and go weary and think in acting nobly and doing right for in due time and at the appointed season we shall reap if we do not loosen or relax our courage and feed so then as occasional opportunity open to earth here we go let us do good morally to all people not only being useful or profitable to them but also doing what is for their spiritual good and advantage be mindful to be a blessing there we go especially to those of the household of faith those who belong to god's family with you the believers read that last but not least be mindful to be a blessing especially to those of the household of faith those who belong to god's family with you the believers so that is plain and simple be extra special to the brethren be extra special to the believers become a blessing to them first peter 2 11 daily beloved i beseech you as strangers and pilgrims abstain from fleshly lust which war against the soul beloved i implore you as aliens and strangers and exiles in the world to abstain from the essential urges the evil desires the passions of the flesh your lower nature that wage war against the soul hebrews 12 you can find this one 14-16 we read and hebrews 12. so you can find follow peace with all men and holiness without which no man shall see the lord looking diligently least any man feel of the grace of god i wanted to remember since he is talking to christians he's talking to believers so you see all these guarantees that men giving men about the kingdom of god you have to be leery of that you have to be careful with that he is speaking here watch looking diligently least any man feel of the grace of god lease any root of bitterness bringing up trouble you and thereby many be defiled please there be any fornicator or profane as he saw who for one morsel of meat soul is good right amplifiers that strive to live in peace with everybody pursue that consecration and holiness without which no one will ever see the lord exercise foresight and be on the watch to look after one another to see that no one falls back from and fails to secure god's grace it's unmerited favor and spiritual blessing in order that no root of resentment ranker bitterness or hatred shoots forth and causes trouble and bitter torment and many become contaminated and defiled by it oh god have mufi and people have done what kind of crazy stuff and too easy to hold grudges and oat i mean we're living in perilous times we're living in dreadful times and you know it's easy to for people to trip you upset you to set you back but you have to guard your heart so to speak verse 16 that no one may become guilty of sexual advice or become a profane godless and sacrifice person who sold his own birthright first single me we're gonna wrap up now you can you're almost there luke chapter eight some other scripture you can find it the greatest storyteller is about to speak uh parables just jesus you know verse four of luke chapter eight you're gonna read from four to fifteen and when much people were gathered together and they will come to him out of every city he's picked by a parable asura went out to sow his seed and as he sawed some fell by the wayside it was strutting down when the fault of the air devoured it sun fell upon a rock as soon as it was sprung up it was it away because like moisture some fell among thorns the thorns sprang up with it choked some felon could cry sprung up and bear fruit a hundred fool and when he had said these things he cried he had an essay here let him hear and his disciples asked him saying what might this problem be he said unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of god but to others in parables that seeing they might not see and hearing they might not understand now the parable is this the seed is the word of god those by the wayside are they that hear and commit the devil taking away the word out of their hearts least they should believe and received so that's wonderful beyond the rocket day which when they hear receive the will with joy these have no roots which for a while believe and in time of temptation fall away they which fell among tones are they which when they lived or fought and are choked with tears riches pleasure of this life now this is the tricky one here this one is in church but choked this one is is in church but they are buddhism with kiers good mid riches with pleasures of this life and bring no and here he defined it no fruit to perfection was 15 but that on good ground a day which in an honest and good heart having heard a word keep it and bring forth fruit at patience now listen to this no pastor is in charge of the heart's operation no minister be given that right nobody could determine that if people was determining heart condition they could have never imagined saul would become poor so the operation of the heart has to be in god the woman of the world heart woman caught in adultery heart all of these things are heart conditions they may not like matthew he was a tax collector but he was called because his name was on the book god saw what was in his heart you may not like joe's jacob because of his strict sin and his miserable behavior and trying to scheme everybody and scam everybody that might be going to work with a lot of people because esau was a more decent man if you could describe it that way but the bible says it's not my opinion jacob i love is so i hate so ultimately the seed is original it's the word that can't change it have power in it it have life in it is where that seed falls it's the type of heart that feels falls in and if you as a believer have an opportunity tonight to say you see the scares these stones these tissues whatever is affecting the flow of god to you through you or by you you want to cut off you want to deal with how about the clothes oh blessed be the name of the lord first corinthians 6 verse 15 to 20 you could find it first corinthians 6 15 to 20. as we wrap up verse 15 knowing not that your bodies are the members of christ shall i then take the members of christ and make them the members of a harlot what forbid what knowing not that he which is joined to an hour is one body for two said he is shall be one flesh but he that is joined unto the lord is one spirit free fornication every sin that a man do it is without the body but he that fornicated he's a commit fornication sin it against his own body what know you not that your body is the temple of the holy ghost which is in you which you have of god which you are not your own for you are bored with a price therefore glorify god in your body and in your spirit which are gone yes we haven't amplified that really flowing do you not see and know that your bodies are members but be part of christ the messiah am i therefore to take the parts of christ and make them part of a prostitute never never or do you not know and realize that when a man draws himself to prostitute he becomes one body better the two it is written shall become one flesh but the person who is united to the lord becomes one spirit with him shun immorality and all all sexual looseness flee from impurity and thought word or deed any other sin which a man commits is one outside the body but he who commits sexual immorality sins against his own body do you not know that your body is the temple the very sanctuary of the holy spirit who lives within you whom you receive as a gift from god you're not your own you were bored with a price purchased with a preciousness and paid for made his own so then honor god here we go and bring glory to him in your body not just your mind but in your body tea that in the flesh cannot please god okay so i believe we're on the final page yeah we're gonna find a page right now romans 12 i beseech you there for brethren by the mercies of god that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is a real reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good acceptable and perfect will of god i appeal to you therefore brethren the amplified and beg of you in view of all the mercies of god to make a decisive dedication of your bodies presenting all your members and faculties as a living sacrifice holy devoted consecrated well pleasing to god which is a reasonable rational intelligence service and spiritual worship do not conform to this world this age fashion after and adapt it to external to official customs but be transformed the change by the entire renewal of your mind by its new ideals its new attitude so that you may prove for yourselves what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of god even the thing which is good and acceptable and perfect in a sight for you and our final scripture tonight is hebrews 11 5 and 6. i'll read this one by faith enoch was translated you should not see that and was not found because god had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased god without faith this is impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must believe that he is and that he is a reward of them that diligently seek oh blessed be the name of the lord this is this is um i i i i was really blessed to share this with you tonight and i trust that you were blessed the way i have been blessed in studying it and and bringing it to you enoch please god he was wrapped in material he had faith he was in the spirit he was walking in the spirit dealers in the flesh cannot please god it has no rocket for them if you want to stay in the flesh the tribulation is guaranteed i'm telling you it's not a perhaps it's not a suggestion it's an option civilization guarantee you have to walk in the spirit you have to come into the spirit if you want to be among the tribulation scenes you have thousands of toastmen people that sit on this message for years applying nothing you would not effective to them they just believe the pastor believe the church believes the message of the hour and that's the end of the story but there's going to be a bride who's going to address herself to the gong of his promised word she's going to wrap herself and clothe herself with humility include herself with grace clothe herself with a new man include herself with the holy ghost cooler said with the rope of righteousness that is going to be the bride let's buy it heavenly father i thank you tonight i don't know what to present after speaking about this grower's church without a wrinkle but here it is lord just share with the people they that are in the flesh cannot please god each person here tonight and those that would hear the tape of a choice to continue as they are or stop in their trucks and adjust lord everything that was spoken came with a warning that people who do those things will not inherit the kingdom it has warnings going we don't hear much warnings but they are coming north because it has to come when the incone writer begins to put his mark and the last one was marked the incorn writer reported it is done it is finished and then the slaughtering angels will give them instructions and the first instruction was begin at my sanctuary for judgment must begin in the house of god people are caught up with things on the outside they caught up looking at news on the outside it was reaching the outside and they're not understanding not realizing it starts on the inside a lord has to start on the inside of us may it start tonight that we could re-examine and look again at our walk with you our walk in god and and lord if it is not as it's supposed to be tonight may our mind be stirred your heart is still may your mind be renewed in such a way that we want to like called jesus the bible said set his face towards jerusalem jesus was busy doing so much things going different places but when his hour came he said my hour has not come and he set his heart and his face towards jerusalem father maybe we set our heart towards walking in the spirit set our hearts towards your holiness your righteousness your purity set our hearts to the thunder that shakes the devil and undefined life walking around the world today without a blemish you said that's
