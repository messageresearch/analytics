[29:06] your bible is likely to turn to three
[29:08] portion scripture matthew 15
[29:10] 21-28
[29:13] philippians chapter 3
[29:15] verse 12 to 14
[29:17] and luke
[29:18] 16
[29:19] 16.
[29:21] read in matthew chapter
[29:24] 15 reading from verse 21.
[29:27] then jesus went dense and he parted unto
[29:29] the coast of tyre and sidon and behold a
[29:32] woman of canaan came out of the same
[29:34] coast and cried unto him saying have
[29:36] mercy upon me o lord thou son of david
[29:38] my daughter
[29:39] is grievously vexed with the devil
[29:42] and he answered her not a word
[29:45] and his disciples came and besought him
[29:47] saying send her away for she cried after
[29:50] us and he answered and said i am not
[29:52] sent but unto the lord sheep
[29:54] or
[29:55] out of the house of israel
[29:58] then came she and worshipped him saying
[30:00] lord
[30:01] help me
[30:03] and he answered and said it is not me to
[30:05] take the children's bread and the
[30:06] cassette dog she said
[30:08] truth lord
[30:10] yet the dogs
[30:11] in the crumbs which fall from their
[30:14] master's table
[30:16] then jesus answered and said unto her o
[30:18] woman
[30:19] greatest
[30:20] thy faith be it unto thee even another
[30:24] wilt and
[30:25] her daughter was made whole
[30:28] from that very hour
[30:29] reading from philippians chapter 3
[30:32] virgin verse 12
[30:34] paul speaks
[30:36] not as though i have already attained
[30:40] either or already perfect
[30:42] but i follow after if that i may
[30:44] apprehend that for which also i'm
[30:47] apprehended of christ jesus brethren i
[30:50] caught not myself to have apprehended
[30:52] but this one thing i do
[30:55] forgetting those things which are behind
[30:57] and reaching forth unto those
[31:00] things which are before
[31:02] i press
[31:04] to what the mark
[31:07] for the price
[31:08] of the high calling of god
[31:10] in christ jesus on our last scripture is
[31:13] from luke chapter 16
[31:15] reading verse 16.
[31:17] and it's a familiar scripture the law
[31:19] and the prophets were until john
[31:22] since that time
[31:23] the kingdom of god is preached and every
[31:26] man press it into it may god bless his
[31:28] would you may be seated
[31:30] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[31:32] okay
[31:33] so this is our first communion service
[31:35] back in line and we're going to be going
[31:37] forward here just keep putting a layer
[31:39] up on layer
[31:40] upon layers we get things in order
[31:43] okay
[31:44] so a title titled this since that time
[31:49] i have an inspiration
[31:51] pressing into the kingdom
[31:53] that's the inspiration for the brown
[31:56] desperation when you seekest me with all
[31:58] thine heart then i'll hear you
[32:01] the kingdom
[32:02] and you get reference to the last script
[32:04] we read the law and the prophets until
[32:06] john since then
[32:08] the kingdom of god of heaven has been
[32:10] preached and man press into it
[32:13] you don't just stand around and say pick
[32:15] me up by the color lord push me in no
[32:18] you press
[32:20] into it you get desperate
[32:23] between life and death
[32:25] wish i had time of another story i was
[32:27] thinking right now of a woman a girl
[32:29] took a wrong role how she had two new
[32:31] pages and things i said sister she got
[32:33] up and said i believe i'd be all right i
[32:35] said no stay there and then the first
[32:37] thing you know she started praying a
[32:38] little bit and directly she got louder
[32:40] and louder after a while she got

[41:28] you have a promise
[41:29] oh glory to god to be genuine
[41:32] overcomers
[41:33] okay
[41:35] oh let's try our text now
[41:38] the law and the prophets were until john
[41:41] since that time
[41:43] the kingdom of god is preached
[41:45] and every man presented
[41:47] things here
[41:49] one the fulfillment of the law
[41:52] the law and the prophets were until john
[41:54] anderson just cap off the old testament
[41:56] already knowing because love was going
[41:57] to be introduced
[41:59] law was fading out and grace was coming
[42:01] law could only identify your sins and
[42:03] your fears and shortcomings but couldn't
[42:05] help you grace was the cure
[42:07] and grace was coming through blood
[42:09] a blood sacrifice a price paid
[42:11] something that you couldn't do so grace
[42:14] always identify itself as something you
[42:15] can't do it's just the grace of god
[42:17] towards you so that's why it's
[42:19] foolishness for this one to judge this
[42:20] one as if they're my power to change
[42:22] this one or see this and see that let's
[42:25] go do the judging
[42:26] let god do the managing let god do
[42:28] deliverance you don't judge nobody and
[42:31] write nobody out who want to cut this
[42:32] one over because one of that is their
[42:34] business but they're not god
[42:36] god is suffering and suffering grace
[42:38] belong to our sovereign one and he can
[42:40] bless you today he can forgive you today
[42:43] cleanse you today he could do miracles
[42:45] with you today by his own decree
[42:48] all glory to god by his own decree he
[42:50] could do it
[42:51] jesus sufferingly choose to walk on the
[42:53] water to get to his disciples he choose
[42:56] not to speak to the storm he chose to
[42:58] speak to them because he wanted to show
[43:00] something to them oh glory to god
[43:02] hallelujah praise god hallelujah
[43:05] understand this god could i let the
[43:06] whole israel walk on the red sea he
[43:09] choose to open up the red sea and they
[43:11] walk on dry land
[43:12] elijah hit the mantle and struck the
[43:14] jordan and he choose for the jordan to
[43:16] open up but jesus choose to walk on the
[43:19] water we could walk on the water we can
[43:21] open the sea he said wait tell them
[43:24] seven thunders after their voices at
[43:26] that group they could shut the heavens
[43:28] they could close the heavens they could
[43:29] do whatever they want to do because
[43:31] there's a word of god coming forth from
[43:33] the mount of god
[43:35] no money go stop it no bishop gonna stop
[43:38] it nobody gonna stop it not trust me no
[43:40] go stop it no sinner will stop it
[43:42] because god spoke it
[43:45] got to come to pass
[43:48] [Applause]

[50:58] church as foundations
[50:59] two things just two not twenty two just
[51:01] two
[51:02] respects
[51:04] and broadly love
[51:05] sins and countries skywalker
[51:08] i give respect because i have respect
[51:10] [Applause]
[51:15] i don't respect because somebody is dis
[51:16] or some other positional
[51:18] promise i respect the mailman i respect
[51:20] this one i respect you treat everybody
[51:21] with respect i treat my sons with
[51:23] respect
[51:23] [Applause]
[51:26] i treat people with respect
[51:28] i have respect
[51:29] i give it because that's what i should
[51:31] do
[51:33] i got a story about a man a man a
[51:35] builder and he built housing for this
[51:37] man working for him for long hours and
[51:39] everything else and the contract was
[51:41] coming to a close and he had one more
[51:42] house he wanted to build he said why you
[51:43] build that house
[51:44] and a man built with all the wretched
[51:46] material all the old material a bit
[51:48] terrible and everything else and a man
[51:50] saying oh you work for me so long and
[51:52] hard i wanted to bless you i think you
[51:53] see that last officer bill
[51:55] die yours
[52:03] how old am i supposed to feel
[52:06] the last house
[52:08] instead of doing his best
[52:10] using the best material he used the
[52:12] cheapest the thingy he built for any man
[52:15] say
[52:16] i really want to bless you you know you
[52:17] see that that's what it is i don't want
[52:18] to tell you no but no i'll tell you that
[52:20] is yours
[52:24] that why sometimes you have to give out
[52:25] your words with kindness
[52:27] because you might eat it back
[52:31] watch your mouth
[52:33] watch your tongue
[52:35] you hear me
[52:36] watch your mouth and tongue be careful
[52:38] what you see and how you see it and to
[52:41] whom you see it
[52:43] [Applause]
[52:44] but there was a something else balaam
[52:46] says i cannot help him
[52:48] he crossed the line
[52:50] i wonder if people especially believe
[52:52] that
[52:55] once the sister went through suffering
[52:56] and when she was dying she tell me she's
[52:58] about here in all that pain i getting is
[53:00] the things i see about ministers
[53:02] so maybe god revealed something that i
[53:04] don't know but she told me that that's
[53:05] not that i see in that she told me that
[53:08] she said she suffer because of things
[53:10] she said about ministers
[53:16] so watch brethren he said he said this
[53:18] one thing i do i reach and fought to
[53:20] those things which are before i press
[53:23] towards the mark oh let me just stop in
[53:25] here brahma said god demands
[53:27] for his servants demands
[53:30] requesting respect he demands respect
[53:32] demands respect
[53:34] oh glory to god if a man make himself a
[53:36] minister well does he make himself that
[53:37] basically when god make a man a minister
[53:39] that's a different thing altogether
[53:41] don't touch that man pray for the man
[53:44] because god can straighten out his men
[53:45] he said not moses he said no no he said
[53:48] now this one and that one he
[53:49] straightened out every son that
[53:50] committed god that will be tested and
[53:52] tried
[53:53] but you don't
[53:54] disrespect you don't do that you don't
[53:56] disrespect
[53:57] okay
[53:58] so this woman now watch what is now
[54:01] now we're coming down hold me along with
[54:03] you
[54:03] this woman description be read she came
[54:06] a daughter next with the devil all right
[54:08] she's a grecian woman a sign official
[54:10] woman we call him and so on she came and
[54:13] worshiped jesus says not take the ticket
[54:14] and breadcrusted the dog she said truth
[54:16] lord brother brown listen to what he
[54:18] pulled from this and this is important
[54:21] perseverance is what he pulled from this
[54:23] i think it means to persevere or to be
[54:25] persistent in something that you're
[54:28] doing
[54:28] in making a goal or something
[54:31] you can't be perseverant and you have
[54:32] nothing set
[54:34] the only way this world comes to play is
[54:36] when you have a goal when you have a
[54:38] target
[54:39] or when you have a mark
[54:41] you say paul said i pressed towards a
[54:42] mark
[54:44] then you could have a perseverance
[54:46] when you have a no goals you go nowhere
[54:49] if you have no work you're not looking
[54:50] for no walk no job you wake up in the
[54:51] morning you have nowhere to go
[54:53] your couple's every year you're
[54:55] persevering out your bed
[54:58] but you're possibly nowhere
[55:00] when you go in my opinion you're going
[55:02] nowhere
[55:03] bro i met a man like that you know see
[55:05] where you're going nowhere you bring him
[55:06] to eat inside the house where are you
[55:07] looking for no nothing
[55:10] day by day
[55:12] he said how people are
[55:14] you have to have a goal
[55:16] and a goal is to have a time in it you
[55:17] know
[55:18] like like like tyrion is here jerusalem
[55:20] until you'll be endured with power from
[55:23] our hearts stay there until i have a
[55:25] time when the day of pentecost was fully
[55:27] come
[55:27] have i ever deadlined it did you ever
[55:30] open that goal
[55:31] you know well you know i go study and
[55:33] two years pass you go study five years
[55:35] past 10 years till you still go study
[55:37] you go study afterwards when you can't
[55:38] study at all
[55:40] but the point about it you have to have
[55:42] a goal
[55:43] in order to persevere
[55:45] for example what we see should make a
[55:47] church that will make a revival
[55:49] that's a goal on wednesday night if you
[55:51] heard the tape on friday night from from
[55:53] usa i preach
[55:55] reward and goals
[55:57] reward is what you get for what you've
[55:59] accomplished but goals is what you could
[56:01] do you could change your mind you could
[56:03] study uh to be a doctor to be a lawyer
[56:05] they could change careers that's what
[56:07] you doing and set as a goal you can go
[56:09] and get subjects advance and get a
[56:10] master's degree whatever you want but
[56:12] i'm saying as a church we could make a
[56:14] church that would make a revival that's
[56:16] a goal
[56:17] and the path that you play to fulfill
[56:18] that goal that's the part that you see
[56:20] that you have to do
[56:22] not just watch but do
[56:24] praise god that your works will follow
[56:25] your faith the one we preach in the
[56:27] preaching giving your faith then what do
[56:28] you do about what you hear and you said
[56:30] there's a goal and they set up the goal
[56:32] you persevere here's why here's why if
[56:34] you're making a goal or something you
[56:36] have to be persistent men throughout all
[56:38] ages that had faith in what they were
[56:40] trying to achieve had to be persistent
[56:43] especially if you're doing something
[56:45] right because you're going to meet an
[56:47] opposition
[56:49] the devil girl are you oh good they take
[56:51] an illness
[56:54] satan chain your own take it take it
[56:56] take it take it
[56:58] you taking what is yours you know
[57:00] and it's the opposition
[57:02] so anytime you're going in the right
[57:03] path
[57:04] and the right channel contrary wins
[57:07] storms that you didn't and that's that
[57:09] isn't the bible says the winds were
[57:10] contrary
[57:11] when jesus rebuked their soul and the
[57:12] bible is kind of the winds were contrary
[57:14] the bible
[57:16] is not peter's sin and then brothers the
[57:18] whole sinful bunch in that boat died
[57:20] like some sister or some brother saying
[57:21] that the other side you know the reason
[57:23] that they're going to that storm is
[57:25] because wickedness
[57:31] and i prophesy they go sink
[57:33] god judging them
[57:38] yeah men playing prophet and also and
[57:40] the bible's places the wins will
[57:42] contrary
[57:43] but sometimes wind just blows contrary
[57:46] it's not because you're sin because god
[57:47] previous sin and in your mind the devil
[57:49] you have a real whoop in your mind
[57:51] because you're going back to all what
[57:52] you do i know sister she's trying to
[57:53] scratch up every tick everything she
[57:54] makes wrong
[57:55] everything and poor soul she goes back
[57:57] and says stop it stop it stop it stop it
[57:59] stop it stop it she going back like this
[58:01] one and making one right going back this
[58:02] one and i brought her call me and tell
[58:04] me she said they tell her sister if you
[58:05] really come at me one more time
[58:10] because she finds she'll make this right
[58:12] she's going right the devil gives you a
[58:14] real trip
[58:16] but it makes no sense you want to put
[58:18] back this and i think i take the pen and
[58:20] show up on my pen and you want to buy
[58:22] pens now to bring back your pen and and
[58:24] all kind of
[58:26] you know things that it's not supposed
[58:28] to be don't let the devil product that's
[58:31] why the blood flow that's what the
[58:33] atonement is for that's what the
[58:35] intercessor is there for
[58:37] to play your case and he has done that
[58:39] and free you by his blood and free you
[58:42] by his power isn't that right all right
[58:43] let's continue
[58:45] men
[58:46] throughout all ages that has faith in
[58:48] what they're trying to achieve has
[58:50] always been perseverant all long to
[58:53] history of time men has never done
[58:55] anything has been men trying to achieve
[58:57] something is to have faith in what
[58:59] they're trying to achieve and when they
[59:00] do it they are perseverant perseverance
[59:03] is to make a goal and be persistent i
[59:06] like that word it's a very 50 to the
[59:08] church of this day or it should be that
[59:10] the church should be perseverant amen
[59:13] praise god and webster day webster says
[59:16] to be persistent in making a goal to do
[59:19] something and men to the ages that ever
[59:21] try to achieve something has been
[59:23] persistent and man in order to be
[59:25] resistant and my quoted again is to know

[1:03:30] in hell we're walking through hell
[1:03:33] because hell is on the earth and we're
[1:03:35] still alive and kicking oh give the lord
[1:03:37] a shout you're above six feet down
[1:03:39] hallelujah you're above ground today
[1:03:41] let's let's see if we could hit this
[1:03:43] here now
[1:03:44] all right
[1:03:45] hallelujah
[1:03:47] okay this is what i love here
[1:03:49] she was a greek
[1:03:50] she wasn't in the belief of that she was
[1:03:52] at a different race of people
[1:03:54] you know
[1:03:55] so this is a different race
[1:03:57] she had no jew
[1:03:58] she had believe torah and moses and
[1:04:00] things she not into that all she she had
[1:04:02] two things
[1:04:03] but a lot of vexed with the devil helped
[1:04:05] me
[1:04:07] that's the only thing we're talking
[1:04:08] about now
[1:04:09] i had some favor i actually preached
[1:04:10] bible to me quotes to me i want to hear
[1:04:13] exaltation my daughter rex with the
[1:04:14] devil and them scribe and pharisees they
[1:04:17] can't help
[1:04:18] this this above their pay grade
[1:04:20] this above their qualifications and i
[1:04:22] recognize you have the qualifications to
[1:04:24] handle this
[1:04:25] all right
[1:04:26] listen to this
[1:04:27] you know but is that preacher's morning
[1:04:29] fate let's find a way
[1:04:30] listen to this faith
[1:04:32] finds a source
[1:04:34] that others don't see
[1:04:38] faith finds a source that others don't
[1:04:40] see and her fade from that source
[1:04:43] and she knew that by hearing if she got
[1:04:45] there what was going to happen
[1:04:47] you might be weak in your arm of faith
[1:04:49] maybe you can just cut off justification
[1:04:51] maybe you can just cut out the jojo
[1:04:53] church but good strong arm of faith can
[1:04:56] cut you to the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:04:59] so isaac is correct in talking about
[1:05:01] different levels of faith oh praise god
[1:05:04] people have levels of faith oh glory to
[1:05:06] god some levels of faith is only to be
[1:05:08] in a certain church and they reach they
[1:05:10] have arrived but you don't want that you
[1:05:11] want the kingdom
[1:05:13] that god promised to come
[1:05:15] to come upon you
[1:05:17] oh glory to god hallelujah watch this
[1:05:19] she had many hindrances and if you
[1:05:21] happen to go on thinking about it but
[1:05:23] her fate didn't have any
[1:05:25] oh glory to god then i was calling a dog
[1:05:27] that just stopped her she ain't moving
[1:05:29] whatever i call her she's not moving her
[1:05:31] fate was not disappointed and if you're
[1:05:34] fake don't have any hindrances it is
[1:05:36] different she had but her faith had no
[1:05:38] hindrances faith does no no hindrance
[1:05:44] so when people claim their faith and
[1:05:45] boldly stump me and this affect me what
[1:05:48] faith is that go back again reboot
[1:05:52] you have to come again die enough of it
[1:05:54] faith doesn't back down
[1:05:56] faith knows no hindrance
[1:05:58] faith looks for a way faith knows there
[1:06:01] got to be a way
[1:06:02] oh glory to god when joshua on the face
[1:06:05] jericho was you know there had to be a
[1:06:06] way to take that because god said that
[1:06:08] is given to thee
[1:06:10] but that's not the problem or given to
[1:06:11] me you know it's how to take it
[1:06:13] what give the lord some praises
[1:06:15] oh glory to god glory to god glory to
[1:06:18] god hallelujah praise god faith there's
[1:06:20] no no hindrance faith only or one thing
[1:06:23] it's goal that is all
[1:06:25] maybe you might have said now wait a
[1:06:26] minute you are greek you are no business
[1:06:28] you're a methodist you ought not to be
[1:06:29] goated pentecostal but that didn't
[1:06:31] hinder her she was persistent
[1:06:33] she was very perseverant another group
[1:06:35] come up and say but wait a minute
[1:06:37] darling you know what the days america
[1:06:38] is past
[1:06:40] but that didn't stop her why fate had
[1:06:41] took a hole and she was still persistent
[1:06:44] she was going anyhow another group said
[1:06:46] some woman of a church might have come
[1:06:47] around said dear do you know what if you
[1:06:49] go across there your husband is a deacon
[1:06:50] over there he would leave you
[1:06:53] there by the force in the family but
[1:06:55] faith had caught a hold of something the
[1:06:57] word of god and she went anyhow she was
[1:07:00] perseverant and she wasn't going to take
[1:07:02] no for an answer fate got a hold of
[1:07:04] something so the disciples had the begs
[1:07:07] that jesus said went away because she
[1:07:09] bought in them she's troubling them
[1:07:11] she's harassing them she's nagging them
[1:07:14] she ain't taking no financer a daughter
[1:07:16] vex for the devil is not right praise
[1:07:18] god praise god praise god and finally
[1:07:21] she arrives and watch disappointments
[1:07:23] god tries every child that comes to him
[1:07:25] and when she got to jesus she taught it
[1:07:27] all over you know and when she got to
[1:07:29] jesus he quickly turned her with great
[1:07:31] disappointment i am not sent to your
[1:07:33] race now after she had passed through
[1:07:35] every one of those barricades and she
[1:07:37] hurdled every one of them by her fate
[1:07:39] she got to this jesus nazareth and as
[1:07:41] soon as she got there went to crying
[1:07:43] after him he ignored her he walked away
[1:07:46] and then finally he turned around with a
[1:07:48] rebuke and said i'm not sent to your
[1:07:50] race i am sent to the lord sheep of the
[1:07:52] house of israel what a rebuke
[1:07:55] hallelujah
[1:07:56] praise god praise god if that had been
[1:07:58] some pentecostal people they have said
[1:08:00] well the way he feels about it and what
[1:08:02] he said another thing he said erased was
[1:08:04] a bunch of dogs the very audacity would
[1:08:08] not have shook up pentecostal he said
[1:08:10] bless god i go to assemblies i'll go
[1:08:11] over so and so on he called her dog i
[1:08:13] was not sent to a race of people i was
[1:08:15] only sent to the jews i'm not sent to
[1:08:17] you and besides your people is like a
[1:08:19] bunch of dogs but she's still held on
[1:08:21] she i i like that is i feel religious i
[1:08:24] like that no matter what obstacle was
[1:08:26] she still held on to that fate and that
[1:08:28] is when you got a hold of that brother
[1:08:30] she held on no matter what anybody else
[1:08:32] said even jesus himself said i am not
[1:08:34] center race you're a bunch of dogs i
[1:08:36] won't take the terrorist but i'm sure to
[1:08:37] you dogs but she's still there on she
[1:08:40] wasn't a hotbed plant she wasn't a
[1:08:41] hybrid modern crop today oh praise god
[1:08:44] hallelujah notice she admitted what
[1:08:47] jesus was the truth she said i am a dog
[1:08:49] amen faith listens
[1:08:51] oh glory to god faith doesn't argue
[1:08:54] give the lord some praises faith listens
[1:08:57] he said what jesus was the word and if
[1:08:59] you've got genuine faith faith will
[1:09:01] always admit the word was right fear
[1:09:03] will never argue against the word it
[1:09:06] will stay with the word the way the word
[1:09:08] says the faith admits is true she says
[1:09:10] truth she admitted he was right and
[1:09:12] faith will do it isn't that right she
[1:09:14] was called the dog god of mercy this
[1:09:16] sinful generation she said truth lord
[1:09:18] i'm not worthy i'm a greek i'm not of
[1:09:20] your people i'm a dog i'm not coming for
[1:09:23] you to bury me but the lay hands on me

[1:09:27] worthy i am a dog you call me one but
[1:09:29] the dogs
[1:09:32] now if jesus didn't call our dog she
[1:09:35] couldn't see what the dog would see
[1:09:39] the dog give her an opening
[1:09:42] for faith to find a channel
[1:09:47] do you see that
[1:09:48] that dog that appeared to be a negative
[1:09:50] become a positive
[1:09:53] for her
[1:09:53] [Applause]
[1:09:55] because all of a sudden when she said
[1:09:56] truth lord i'm a dog

[1:10:31] because that got her the daughter's
[1:10:33] deliverance
[1:10:34] what did you say
[1:10:35] watch
[1:10:36] lord i'm wanting only crumbs remember
[1:10:39] she had never seen a miracle
[1:10:41] she was a greek she had heard there was
[1:10:44] a miracle but jesus performed miracles
[1:10:46] she knowed if he could perform miracles
[1:10:47] on one person god could create they
[1:10:49] could do it watch what she said to jesus
[1:10:51] and what what what did jesus say he said
[1:10:54] for this saiyan
[1:10:58] are you ready
[1:10:59] she had the right approach to god's gift
[1:11:02] you've got to approach it right
[1:11:04] and when you are sitting out there when
[1:11:06] you're in church when you are the altar
[1:11:08] wherever you are you got to approach god
[1:11:11] in the right manner faith
[1:11:13] always admits
[1:11:15] the truth
[1:11:17] oh my
[1:11:18] hallelujah
[1:11:20] oh glory to god
[1:11:22] thank you jesus
[1:11:23] oh i'm going to finish here
[1:11:29] do you see it now
[1:11:31] the kingdom is preached
[1:11:32] and every man pressed away
[1:11:34] but ram says whoa we see david a
[1:11:37] rejected king turn off is shown by his
[1:11:38] brethren his own son
[1:11:40] sit upon monk to love others how perfect
[1:11:42] the son of god 800 years later rejected
[1:11:45] king among his people what was it
[1:11:47] what was it god
[1:11:48] reflected himself in those prophets
[1:11:50] reflecting christ
[1:11:52] and they came one which was the
[1:11:54] perfection of god it was good among us
[1:11:57] and
[1:11:58] since that time
[1:12:01] he has reflected himself in his church
[1:12:03] this side of calvary
[1:12:05] now you see what we are all trying to
[1:12:07] get to this dwelling place there is some
[1:12:09] statue perfect
[1:12:10] the tabernacle of the living god we
[1:12:13] notice here first we have faith virtue
[1:12:15] knowledge temperance patience godliness
[1:12:17] bloody love but love then add love
[1:12:20] now
[1:12:21] peter here
[1:12:23] is outlining something here for us to
[1:12:26] get there
[1:12:28] and i want to say this that there are
[1:12:29] some people who have a portion of this
[1:12:30] virtue knowledge patience and so forth
[1:12:33] that don't even profess to be christians
[1:12:35] he said no watch that won't do it
[1:12:38] there are people have a portion of this
[1:12:39] that don't even pretend to be christian
[1:12:41] but that won't do it it's like a black
[1:12:43] bird trying to put on peacock feathers
[1:12:45] you see watch god's first decision was
[1:12:48] the pardon man was the truth of shed
[1:12:49] blood
[1:12:50] so it's only through the blood we have
[1:12:52] access to this fate and with your
[1:12:54] knowledge
[1:12:55] this year is god's kingdom
[1:12:58] this here is what you have to press
[1:13:00] into
[1:13:01] your president of faith and virtue and

[1:13:52] based upon forgiveness

[1:13:57] but to get the faith to walk by love you
[1:13:59] have to come up into love
[1:14:00] that love could be the source
[1:14:02] and the power source to activate that
[1:14:05] faith oh blessed be the name of the lord
