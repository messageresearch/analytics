tonight we thank you for bringing us together we thank you for this friday lord we hope we appreciate the lord that the believers would gather together this way and to hear from you to hear word from you to get a word of encouragement a word of inspiration a word that would pilot and better guidance in their lives father may be soon as they bless the word the scripture will be read bless the things that will be said made edify and strengthen them in jesus name i ask it amen and amen god bless you and welcome tonight i trust that all of you are doing fine and i trust that all of you here tonight must have heard the wednesday night service uh have no other gods before me and i pray if you haven't heard it you should listen to it it's a very very important message i think it's relevant today and um i would see what the lord will do tonight um i guess um you know sometimes not just you but i myself wonder how things come how scriptures come how thoughts come how inspiration come to share with god's people and and many times i know it's the lord it's not my thinking is that my studies is just being called to say it inspired by the spirit of god to see and to share and to get certain things and i'm grateful to god uh it's not a human ability but i feel that we are hearing from god i believe that we are hearing from the spirit of god on the word and to help us in this hour because it's very treacherous they'd have more bibles more books more ministers more preachers more teachers more voices more influences by way of facebook and youtube and tv evangelists and messengers and so on like that there's so much voices today and but ram talk about it runs out the voice of god and it's shocking because the the prophecies that will be found in the last days and from a natural intellectual standpoint it's virtually virtually almost impossible to think there's a family and that farming is not books and tapes and preachers and ministers we have tons of that but the famine is for the hearing of the true word of god what would cut past the different voices today what would cut past the influences that the other christians goddess have tied up in many different influences and they speak it you speak what is influence in your life you speak what is upon your heart you speak what is near to you what you are thinking about it's near to your mouth if it's politics you find yourself talking politics is religion or whatever it is it will come out your mouth it's abundance of the heart the mouth will speak so whatever is bubbling up inside your heart even though your churchy or go to church or whatever it is it will come out and etch out your mouth if you're negative on the inside it's bubbling on the inside and for a while christian environment you talk a little positive or talk good or whatever it is but generally the negative will begin to spew itself out so i trust today that god help us help us i think the 23rd of march last year 2021 but isaac uh uh spoke a message a bible study changed your mind change your world 20 to the most just about one year ago change your mind change your world and the thing of it is and listen carefully now people have been trained to listen not so much apply but to hear and the challenge is how do you get people from just hearing to begin to want to apply you know something we read i think was wednesday but abram said that his wife had made himself already and he's talking about the true bride the true vine judges herself it almost appears as if okay so the the prophet of the hour brought the close of the world but the bride have to dress herself the clothes is there the promises are there he talked about being wrapped in the gong of his promises of the promised world but what do you do do you sit and it's something that scared me in my league christian experience i was scared of with us uh a message a world people coming out of the pentecostal waiting for the rapture waiting for the rapture and when i saw the prophet say the rapture is a revelation so i i i always believe that the pentecostals of course we know they missed the boat but they didn't have the right picture of what the rapture is about they're looking to be caught up to meet him in the ear without seeing that it takes a revelation to really go and meet him a real revelation of god not your inspiration not your thoughts and ideas but what the words say and as we get deeper you'd realize god keeps his word you know i'm saying something isaac about about uh obedience about obedience someone was talking about obedience a show what obedience looked like contrasted with disobedience i know we talked a little bit i was thinking about brother branham when god told him to go among the pentecostals and he disobeyed and he lost his wife he lost his daughter um he had the flood he lost the anointing for five years and i was thinking about it i was thinking that even though this was a man of god called of god and a prophet it still didn't it still didn't escape god's anger or god's judgment or words and displeasure of his behavior or his conduct now all sons must be tried all sun must be tested and there has to be a basis on which god tests us just like children go to school and after they learn they have to get a test to walk to the next level i see it as we as sons have to go through our own tests we admire but ram's testimony we admire other things because we can he went through and he shared and so like that but when come to us in our times of distress what do we do and it was not worthy in the scripture we read on wednesday night oh god say well listen um go to your gods the god that you choose you leave me you forsake me you know i brought you that protector each i brought you out of different conditions and situations and your choice you choose yourself for the gods you choose to let your heart go astray and i hope that the words we share tonight would help you help your heart jesus rebuke them we hear the scripture these people honor me with their lips but their heart is far from me so you want to get your lips and heart aligned it was those people their lips and their hearts were were not in alignment what they were seeing with their mouths and what they were operating with at the heart level was two different things and that is what makes hypocrisy but when we get what we speak with our mouth line up with what we have in our heart that is a channel that faith and god presence and power can go through so may god bless you tonight strengthen you and i hope that there could be a shift if i see a paradigm shift a shift in your mind that you're not coming just to hear words but you're coming to get clues as to what you must do clues it's almost like the bible is a puzzle a puzzle you know like children long time used to if you have like uh finding the treasure hunt treasure hunt and you put a clue here and a clue there under stones and rocks and different things and when you find this clue when they get this screw it leaves another place and then you get another clue and eventually get to the treasure it's almost something like that clues clues of life who wants it who's hungering for it who's still still fit it is troubling and you may hear me repeating myself to see people who sometimes don't have a desire to change their content with themselves actually they are god to themselves they are absolute in themselves they are their own god if their wife their husband don't tell them anything they pass the catalan as the church nobody can tell they tell themselves you see and no there's in subjection to no one no one could instruct them guide them rebuke them whatever they power their own ship and so on like that but that ship eventually will crash because that's not who god's set up man man was supposed to be dependent on god dependent on god that is what man is supposed to be dependent on god seeing god as his source as his strength as his life and his joy so let's get into something here tonight let me have your bibles i'll let you turn to romans 12 and romans chapter 12 and philippians chapter 4 scripture reading tonight let me just give the scripture uh romans chapter 12 from mega scripture i believe i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world and this is where we want to go tonight but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good unacceptable and perfect will of god and the amplified verse 2 says do not be conformed to this world this age fashion after and adapted to its external superficial superficial customs but be transformed changed by the entire renewal of your mind by its new ideals and its new attitude let me repeat that by renewal of your mind by new ideas and new attitudes that you may prove for yourselves what is the good unacceptable and perfect will of god even the thing which is good and acceptable and perfect in his fight for you philippians chapter four you want to read verse five paul speaks let your moderation be known under all men the lord is at hand be careful for nothing because in everything by prayer and supplication but thanksgiving let your requests be made known under gods all the issues trials tribulations problems you have and what let it be known to god make a request under god the seven and the peace of god which passed that all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds to jesus christ and this is the verse you want to get to tonight eat finely bread with it whatever things are true whatever things are honest whatsoever things are judged whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are a good report if there be any virtue and if there be any praise think on these things tonight our little title i'd like to put us renew your mind think on these things renew your mind the amplified of that same voice it says for the rest brethren whatever is true whatever is worthy of reverence and is honorable unseemly whatever is just whatever is pure whatever is lovely and lovable whatever is kind and winsome and gracious if there be any virtue and excellence if there be anything worthy of priests think on we take account of these things fix your minds on them note note this list that paul presented here to think on these things this list excludes the negative the filthy the what is a contrary what is not wholesome it leaves those things out not does those things doesn't exist but he's trying to get them to refocus to renew to think but i said to friends across the world now you go to look for me i will listen to the angelic choir there are great voices sanki's the phones i love good singing but one of the greatest things i've ever had for enjoyment is meditation in the word of god to me there's one thing that's fundamentally and one thing that is true one thing that is infallible that's the word of god to me all christendom must be based upon one solid thing the word of god and that's the foundation and that's what we are here for tonight is the fellowship around this word and meditate on the word you know the way to find god is to meditate upon god think of god david spoke of it how he would bind the laws on his bedpost how he would merit it day and night and speaking about medication meditation psalms 1 says blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly of standards in the way of sinners or sisters in the seat of the scornful stand it in the way of sinners let me just pause there you as a believer live in such a a way that if you become a stumbling block to the sinners don't do that no sit in the seat of this cornfield but here we go with two but his delight is in the law of the lord and his law that he meditated dear knight his delight is in facebook no is in youtube no is in what's up whatever social media have out there no his in light is in the law of the lord and in his law thought he made the dear knight what happened to this man now he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water so when you see that man a man a woman and i was thinking about man there's only one man who admits enough a male man and a female man male man is man and the female man is woman so woman man he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringing forth his fruit in his season disease also inshallah whichever he does the ungodly are not so but they're like the chaff which the wind drowns away therefore the ungodly shall understand and the judgment or sinners in the conversation of the righteous but the lord nor does the righteous and the way of them godly shall perish so paul paul is trying to get us to have deliberate thought and attention to these things you know sometimes like uh there are something called i think it's it is something so some attention this deficit disorder with children they can't stay focused for long you know they're always pretty fidgety and somewhere are you like that in the spirit realm where you can't focus long enough for something to soak into you see so so this here tonight is trying to get us to have a deliberate thought a deliberate attention as to what we must apply and what we must do so so paul identify all these things whatever that could report what if it's honest and so on and in a world today that is so full of misinformation disinformation lies what is ugly what is disgusting what is rude crude ungodly and everything else he this is a challenge that our minds could become disciplined to dwell on these things to think on these things every single day whether it's on the news whether it's on facebook whether it is on the internet whether it is and whatever on the streets the signboards whatever it is it is information bombarding us it is is all that is have to do with the influences of this world of course and the prince of the power of the ear behind all these technology and everything else but it's trying to influence our minds see so therefore this is to bring us back into our disciplines to a challenge people easier talk about the negative than the positives i think is somebody was sharing something with me uh tonight as i read it einstein i think somebody sent it einstein um was doing some or doing some problems maybe i'm not seeing it right but this is just of it and he's getting everything right first sec second third fourth fifth the tenth question he gave a wrong answer and the whole class came down on him and he said look at that i did from one to nine i'm just part of reason correctly and because i did one wrong you'll get down on me you don't value the right that i've done but you highlight the wrong and this is where this is human this is what we do it is easier to talk about somebody's faults and feelings and to talk about the successes and their uh pure objective and motive and they may have flopped along the way in trying to do something for the kingdom or trying to do the best that they can and they collapse along the way or they stumble along the way and we focus on this fumble and we talk on the stumble and so on like that and that becomes the news that becomes the focus but paul was talking about whatsoever things are lovely what whatsoever things are true whatever things are honest whatsoever things how do we get to discipline ourselves to think on these things as opposed to the the vast volume of negatives and concreting that's come our way because you see if we do these things if we choose choose now to meditate on these things and think on these things then we are more likely to watch going in the direction of practicing these things and applying these things so this is it has to start with the discipline of the mind and that is where we get that thought from renewing of your mind not just hearing but have an interest now i remember i remember uh i have an interest to cook i wanted to cook because i i had a desire to cook food one day for my wife and i went to work all these years didn't get the chance to i had to return i said how you do that how do you do that no i don't know what might have been going through her mind while i was asking those questions but i had an interest to learn and the only way that i could learn is to ask questions and find them now if you're a person who is embarrassed to ask questions well i am very sorry for you you have a problem getting the information you will take longer to learn not that you want to learn it just take a longer way but in order to learn you have to find out you have to get the information you have to know so i would ask how do you do that why you mix that why you put that inside of there why you choose to sprinkle that why you add that and so and i'm going to that way because i know that when i get dear i will have to do it and do it well so the other day i did something i cooked something and i said i said this isn't very good this system just as if you make it and she smiled and um when she tasted it it was ceasing just as good and i felt good about it i felt great about it because i did it well i wanted to do well and to me this is an interest and you have to have an interest you come like i say your wife talking to you or husband talking to you are you on your phone yes you're not listening you are not showing any interest you have to have an interest in what the person is saying so many persons irritated or irritable and and you're not trying to cool them down or soften that irritable ability you identify it by not paying attention by not listening and sometimes we hearing the word coming and we saying you know are you ready but you are hearing but are you listening are you meditating but i could often see to meditate is not to read to meditate is not to listen and it makes it it's just soak in let it digest like since i got this thought i would have not have gotten before me it is ringing in my spirit it is ringing in my eye no other gods no other gods no one of god you know god you see in female form over there you're seeing this out there that's out there no other gods no other gods no other gods nothing must come between you and the real god this is the word of the lord no other gods and this how meditation is thinking about it why would god emphasize that why would god address idolatry because idolatry replaces him he who pleases us he who put us on the earth who call us on our dinners this is what he does and he is offended by it he say i'm a jealous god don't come he don't want that in other words don't put nothing between you and god go put your wife there some people put their children there some people live their lives with their children or their children achieve they feel they achieve and whatever it is some people put the card here the house chair the money there the bank account there they they position there they see you they they whatever post they have the balls whatever it is they put that deal but and they put money there whatever but god said don't do that seek first the kingdom so therefore this word this word to meditate is a serious thing because this takes you beyond reading this take you where you need time how could you meditate in front of a television you can't how do you meditate in your thesis in front of you and cell phone you can't how do you meditate on your face in the newspaper you can't how do you meditate and you're talking long long long talking wasting time with somebody who it doesn't really support your vision and everything else you need time to meditate it meditate and that time is quite time it's time for him to whisper time for him to speak times him to talk to your heart and your spirit and the devil's job is to sidetrack you and take up your attention and drive you almost crazy with information and and emails and disk popping and that popping and and and i i don't i i don't mean to offend anybody in that sense but you see all the forwards people forwarding yeah i watch them forwards and do don't be one of them people being used just forward forwards because you're feeling forward-ish but but you have to understand what you're doing because a lot of these things are distraction it sounds good it's okay and everything else but how much you are caught up in it is is a whole difference so therefore so therefore the to me without renewal of the mind how can you really get that change the bible talk about you must be born again of the word and of the spirit not just born again of the spirit but of the word and of the spirit the word is the conductor of the spirit so the word have to be laid inside the tear that the spirit could do effective work or you could say it this way the word is a seed and the spirit is water so if you want to get uh to change your crop let's say for instance you have pickles and you have torns and you have briars and everything else and you take a hole and you clean this out you want to change what is on your land then you have to put in seed and get water to water the seed and then you get a different crop all together so that is like your mind we are born in sin we iniquity we have a lot of briars and torns and bad behavior and enmity and jealousy and all these sort of stuff and that is what is growing in our system and here it is we get a word you don't have to be like that come and you'll get washed by the washing of the water of the wood come and you'll get cleansed and then afterwards you get seeds now and the mystery of god coming as the word of god and jews sees into you and as the seed begin to get into you then the spirit begin to deal with those seeds and bless the seeds inside your heart then you suddenly begin to grow and then as you grow all these fall off new leaves grow out and then you find yourself changing from the inside out because something supernatural is happening on the inside so after a while and paul if i can find it paul talk about are following me let me see if i get it here okay here it is finally my brethren quotes are we read whatsoever things are true whatever things are honest whatever things are just whatever things are pure whatever things are lovely or something that's a good report if they believe you if the abilities present any things but this part this night those things which you have both learn one and receive to and heard and seen in me do and the god of peace be with you in other words you said practice what you have learned this is the amplifier that's in scripture and receive and heard and seen in me and model your way of living on it and the god of peace of untroubled understood well-being be with you so in other words mimic me mimic what you have heard mimic what you read mimic act like do like repeat like what you are hearing don't just hear it and leave it no act like do like repeat like mimic it and praise god what you see in me do so i think this is a very powerful scripture those things which you have would learn and receive and heard and it's interesting not just how it is pleased but how it is written you have to hear it you have to learn it you have to receive it learn receive heard singing in me do you have to see an example so that is how we get where we go and that's how you come into your own like we say cricket or football or something there's always somebody that you have to train with there's a um always really coach or whatever it is and then they make you watch pictures of footballers or cricket or whatever it is whatever sport and then you watch how they do it and then you do it like them and it's like you're mimicking and you're doing strokes like them and so on like that or kicking the ball like them and afterwards you come into your own form but you start copying you start acting like you start doing like and then you get into your own rhythm your own beat your own authenticity praise the lord so trust tonight that this will help you praise the name of the lord psalms 46 stink on these things this one says god is our refuge and strength a very present hell controller remember brother branham got that scripture god is our refugee strength a very present help to trouble you're thinking on these things therefore will not be fear do the earth be removed and do the mountains be carried in the midst of the sea do the waters thereof roar and be troubled and though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof sinner my so in other words by meditating on the goodness of god the grace of god the mercies of god you could trust god in difficult times in hard times and when you go and tell them go to your gods when they go that you choose when deliver you in your time of tribulation because this is what i'm to israel whenever pressure gets so hot and heavy they cried out to the lord and god delivered them god had enough that he said he said i'm not even part of you i will not deliver you i will leave you in your condition because you choose to watch the other gods tonight i trust that you're gonna reboot i trust you get a renewal i get you know i re a first start with the love of god in your soul but about it's too bad that the church doesn't walk in the spirit like more than we do for it was that kind of time when god comes to you it was on the road to emmaus when cleopas and his friend was speaking and talking and thinking about jesus that he walked out of the bushes by the side of them and walked with him it is while we are thinking upon you the trouble with the world today we are thinking about everything else but him and this is a big problem then he says we wonder why we don't get blessed it was a few weeks ago about three weeks ago when i sat down some sycamore trees i was telling you i begin to think it was dear for the first time he came and declared a new ministry to think on him jonah unto me i'll join i unto you saith the lord think upon him david spoke he was write his commandments upon the back post medicine on him day and night that's what the church ought to do but keep your hearts tuned in with god day and night and in den is when he appears solomon said as the man taken in his heart so as he begin to think that you're one of his children that he saved you that he is good to you and you love him and he loves you don't just wait till you go to church or some convenient hour just keep him on your mind all the time let me repeat that you say begin to think you want of his children that he saves you that he is good to you and you love him and he loves you many times we act as secretary israel okay god did not work for us god did not call us or did not press us we are angry we upset because we don't get what we think we should get at this point in time when you look back historically when you look back in your life you recognize that this grace has brought you all these years and if his grace brought you and kept you all these years he could keep you further so continue trusting him but but to you who believe he said oh god do you know that you've got something in you that is the call into the deep if all the deep you've got have been satisfied then stay where you are but for me and my house for me there is something more than what we have seen there's a land beyond the river somewhere there's still a deep corner to the deep i cannot be satisfied with theology i cannot be satisfied with the good church i cannot be satisfied with a good campaign i cannot be satisfied with hearing service there is something beyond that calling so just let them alone don't argue with them you're going to another line and this is it friends when you recognize that you are going to the land beyond the river you're going to a better place you'd rather go on first and carry on with anybody god said i give esau this mountain don't touch him i've got something different for you cross over amen that's my desire brethren to see my church cross over into another land i desire to move over to the other side if there is something in you first call in there'll be something to respond to that call just settling down to reason sheep isn't good enough for you go into some sort of business not enough for you just to join church put your name on the book is not enough for you because there is something called across the rich yonder across the next ridge all across jordan until you fall in the arms of god a deep call into the deep did you notice when joshua started to cross jordan here we go so is monkey leave brother leave them alone alone because god gave them what they are their portion is before your portion you're the cross jordan you say when joshua started to cross jordan how joshua remembered his commission let not this book of the law my word depart out of your mouth question how come you could believe nice things of people philosophers and and people talking all kind of thing are you not like just on the word that came out that does hear the lord about 20th century prophets in this last day how come all these word of these politicians and philosophers and and all these crazy prophets you have nowadays saying what is saying yes part of it might be right i don't know but i'm seeing what should not depart out of your mouth is this book because the mighty angel the one with the swept back wings the one with the seventh field the one that came out version 10 he came along with this book open this is why we have this revealed word this is why he said the spirit the prophet and the pride will say the same thing we are not here to preach our own message we're not here to preach our own thoughts and ideas and share what we think and what we feel and what we dream we are here to present the words from the angel we can't get it because the word of lord comes to our prophet so god stick a prophet upon the malachi 4 behold i said elijah the prophet he bring the angel to that prophet give him the message because the word comes to the prophet and then the prophet gave it to bride on books and tapes version 10 11 the voice said go and take the book and eat the book and prophesy again and the reason right now we still into prophecy is because it a lot of stuff has not yet been fulfilled so we have to still meditate on the word day and night and if we are doing that then from our mouths will come the word because that is what we are meditating on in other words joshua i don't care what the tribe say what all the clues you see stay with this world for them though shall make that way prosperous no matter how many big things they do how many little things they do how many organizations it means tea with the word joshua stay with the word this word shall not depart out of your mouth so he's reading the scripture only be those strong and very courageous that don may observe to do according to all the law which moses my servant has commanded thee to not from it from the left hand or the right hand to the left in other words do a certain thing do it i don't care what the organization says do it anyhow that's the joshua that god has written for till not one inch one eyeopener stay right with the wood to the nutrient from the right to the left the dominance prospect so watch things even though god is saying joshua take the people over and everything else and i wondered you are with moses that is the bold print as i wanted moses i'll be with you i will not fail you that is the big print you see the fine print the fine print is don't let that book leave you know don't think i take that thought out to your heart or forsake that book and meditate on that book day and night so always there is the fine print to the bold print and the fine print is equal and important to enforce the ball print so the ball print on which you replace your project yours all that song and great but then what about this part the book of the lord shall not depart from thy mouth but also match it in the dna to turn from the right or to the left that don't mess prosper so you say you think you're prospering when you're building big churches getting ten thousand added to your denomination he said that's not prosperity god don't take you one step closer to the promise what we need need is more of god more of the holy ghost repeat that again what we need is more of god more of the holy ghost the dharma is prosper wherever you go this book of the law shall not be passed out of thy mouth but also merit it during day and night in other words you will speak it you'll be meditating on it you'll be thinking on it and it will unfold and come out through you when you are thinking on doing something you are are you taking god's word for it are you finding your desire in the world are you preaching what which is in the bible just like me today preaching for doctrines the commandments of men and said read this book of the law shall not depart out of thy hand or thy mouth he said i'm out what are you saying just don't read it and walk away speak it live it teach it but those shall meditate during day and night the dome is observed to do according to all that is written therein you see what joshua of this day is going to be you see what a joshua the church spiritual is going to be is the same kind of joshua they had into its natural church spiritual has got to be the same thing then he quotes psalms 42 as the heart planted after the water broke so pointed my soul after the o god my soul truth for god for the living god when shall i come and appear before god my tears have been my meat day and night while they continuously unto me where is thy god i think david in the writing of this psalm must have been in distress so are you in distress you're not alone david was in distress it usually takes distress to bring the best out of a man really when god gets down to where we fast many times to get ourselves in position to get ourselves out of the way and i think when david got in these places then he began to meditate on the lord begin to think about the things and many times god get us in tight corners where we have to look up sometimes we even have to get on our back in the hospital bed sometimes somewhere we can look up to see where the great blessings of god come from and that message was he's speaking about truth so we live in a world today where we are being bombarded by messages images world views full vision disorder that are conflicting with biblical scriptures biblical principles and by the isaac so masterfully brought out on the message with the unchanging god-changing world changing people he's talking about in school and i always hear the expression the only change is the only constant is change and that's not true the only constant really is god so you know the modernist and this secular system and world and what they see and and philosophize is trying to make a non-effective scriptures on the bible the power of the word so christians that rub up so much and christians have to talk to effect what do you have out here look what the scriptures say and we have to reject those things that does not draw us closer to god whatever sin or words consider the scripture we read of philippians and that chapter 8 4 8 whatever things are lovely pure good report so if whatever you're reading listen watch it does not bring you closer to god it does not pass this philippians 4 test it does not pass it so you can't continue reading that listening to that looking at that you can't continue doing that because it has to pass this litmus test it has to pass through philippians 4 8 whatever things are true today a lot of things are not true i have seen people they spreading things on the internet spreading things and sharing things only to come and recognize is false is false it's not true it's not confirmed but they're excited to share information without verification but the thing about the word god word is true he can't lie so whatever he promised whatever he speaks it has to come to pass so we have the assurance that is his truth so therefore this is something that we could use as a template to evaluate what we are consuming by way of media whatever digital media or physical media whatever means your tv or facebook or whatsapp or whatever whatever whatever access of the question what i am listening to what i am reading what am i looking at what am i studying what am i meditating on is it bringing me closer to god or further away from god this is what we have to ask ourselves psalms 9 94 this is deep oh lord god to whom vengeance tensions belonging oh god to conventions vengeance belongs lift up thyself thou judge of the earth render a reward to the proud lord how long shall the wicked how long shall the wicked triumph how long shall they utter and speak hard things and all the workers of iniquity boast themselves they break in pieces like the lord an afflicted heritage they slay the widow and the stranger and murder the fatherless yet they say the lord shall not see neither shall god of jacob regard it understand he brutish among the people and he fools when will he be wise he that planted the ear shall he not hear he that formed the eye shall he not see he that chasteneth the heathen shall not correct he that teacheth man knowledge shall not he know the lord knoweth the thoughts of man that they are vanity blessed is the man whom though jesus oh lord and teaches him out of thy law that thomas gave him rest from the deeds of adversity until the pit be digged for the wicked for the lord will not cast off his people neither will he forsake his inheritance but the judgment shall return unto the righteous and all the upright and the heart shall follow it who will rise up like for me against the evildoers who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity unless the lord had been my help my soul had almost dwell in silence when i said my foot slipped thy mercy o lord help me up and the margins of my thoughts within me i comfort delight my soul what is that what is sound sounds like before sometimes you must go and read it over made it on that side and then he amplified i want to just go down quickly he said lord how long shall the wicked how long shall the wicked triumph and exalt the poor arrogant words speaking heart things all the evildoers both love me they crush your people lord afflict your heritage display the widow the transient stranger and murder the unprotected orphan they say the lord does not see neither does the lord of jacob notice it consider and understand you stupid ones among the people and you self-confident fools when will you become wise he who planted the ear shall he not hear he will form the eye shall he not see he who disciplines and instructs the nations shall he not punish he who teaches man knowledge the lord know the thoughts of man that they are vain empty and futile only a breath blessed happy fortunate to be envied is the man whom you discipline and instruct o lord and teach out of your law that you may give him power yes that you may give him power to keep himself calm in the days of adversity until the inevitable pit of corruption is dug for the wicked for the lord will not cast or from spurn his people neither will he abandon his heritage for justice will return to the uncompromisingly righteous and all the upright in heart shall follow it when i said my fault is threaten your mercy and loving kindness oh lord held me up who has been keeping you all these years who have been holding you up all praise the name of the lord and whom you're scared psalm 63 leave it oh god the word my god only will i seek thee my soul twisted for thee my flesh longing for thee in a dry and tasty land where no water is this farm here is an expression of a man who is cut off from worry stuff his soul is after god he is hungering after righteousness if god can help us tonight to understand that he put a twist in your soul you may not be experiencing it now because it's covered up a lot of stuff is on top of there hurts beans self past conscience failures trap smears and it's all there like wrappings over you and you're trying to claw your wheel but it is there the tooth for god is there you know i remember early experiences with the lord in love and tell stream of my sister and they had some empty houses up there and i used to go and pray in them seeking the lord and one of the songs isis peace again over and over let the beauty of jesus be seen in me all his wonderful passions and purity oh thou spirit divine all my nature refined till the beauty of jesus deceiving me it is a song that i couldn't get away from it was like a israelite like an antenna let the beauty of jesus be seeing me i was hungry i was thirsting for god i couldn't explain that to anyone and you may tie it into the first love holy love whatever for the lord anything like that but there was something genuine about it something striving about it i remember experiencing john johnson technical institute where i was studying and um i said testify about the lord i had a d i want a crowd a guy come out and boy look at you i believe in a false prophet and whatnot and i'm trying to talk to him and say something and i started stutter and the woods just can't couldn't come with my mouth and it was quite embarrassing to a point but yet i felt good because i felt that i still have a heart for the lord i love the lord i want to put this to him and even though it was a kind of discouraging thing that i couldn't stand up and say because i just was stuttering i just we just couldn't come out it just just didn't come up but i still believe god said no i still believe you i still trust you set up confidence and sometimes god sends you some embarrassing situations people laugh at you mock you scuff you but you are his son you're one of the stars you're his daughter it doesn't change your status yeah they may mock for a while but you as a son or the child of god will come true that's why i want to encourage you tonight don't just hear it make a conscience a conscious attempt to meditate to think on these things it's an active thing to change your mind you can you know the bible being a eastern book marriages were arranged and you you know it's amazing how these marriages that were arranged many of them most of them last very well because the marriages were based on certain principles of operation the wife the sister they knew what they had to do in terms of how they were brought up and raised when rebecca saw isaac was the first time she see any man she went she's going to get married a man she never met a man she only had a report of and is interested because in so doing in making this arrangement the wife or the woman learn to love her husband she grows to love her husband these days people could talk for long engage for long you know everything long long long stilting break but that those times was the operation was the principles behind it and the principles brought the correct guidance the bible talk about let the older 50 younger ones have to love their husbands and and give you examples about fear and whatnot that wasn't an issue about um women's rights and all them kind of attitudes and so on it wasn't an attitude like that at all it was a matter of the husband and place right in place the children come and fall in line and then they understood that they belong to a special class of people where they're on a lineage that has that is covenanted that is blessed and they belong to the seed of the righteous it was a kind of understanding that they belong to that generation and that seed of the righteous and you have to begin to see yourself exactly like that the serpent seed is on the earth there's a wickedness there's evil all them planting these sodomites everybody who has to come into the position they get into this position and so the bride too would have to come into her position so david talked about as the heart pant after the water book my shoulders could you see that tonight is your soul twisting or are you waiting for this to over to go and watch a movie are you waiting for this over to go and read some novel or some kind of book or something so you know and you'll forget hey i was in submission right here i hear all these pictures like you see some words it can't be like that friends god deserves you your mind your body your soul you can't wait for this to overcome god do your own thing you have to wait for this to over to say lord change me change my thinking renew my mind transform my life i want to think on these things think on these things let us be the meditation of your soul in your heart as i told you since i preached that the wednesday night has been bringing no other gods no other gods you could make anything you god you can make fool your god and all think about it now you know it was not god for his food first serious and you need food because you're a human being but you could make anything your god but he wants to be your lord tonight so let's see how we could just his eye he said what oh god that was my god only will i seek me my soul twisted for thee my flesh longed for thee in a dry and tasty land where i know what it is this is so descriptive you could see it with david say a tasty lamb in the water to see thy power and thy glory so as i have seen thee in the century because thy loving kindness is better than life my lips shall praise thee thus will i bless you while i live i will lift up my hands in thy name my soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness my mouth shall crazy the joyful lips when i remember here we go now this is david this is not hollywood on his bed when i remember thee upon my bed i meditate on thee in the night watches okay so we we like to see david a man after god's own heart but here is this man after god's own heart you could see why he's distant you could see why you could compare it in like my flesh longest within a dry and tasty land where no water is you mean your real tasty your desperate he said when i remember thee upon my dead i meditated on thee in the night watches because thou has been my help therefore in the shadow of thy wings will i rejoice my soul follow it hard after thee my right hand upholded me but those that seek my soul to destroy shall go down in the lower parts of the earth they shall fall by the sword there shall be a portion of foxes but the king shall rejoice in god everyone that spirit by him shall glory but the amount of them that speak lies shall be stopped so paul by seeing think on these things was trying to get the people the believers to refocus and to understand that instead of filling your minds with etc things that carries no value like i find myself in watching news sometimes you know you getting an information person and i recognize this has no value to me i don't forget to read it you should see me spin newspapers you wouldn't believe there's news anybody doesn't because once it doesn't connect with anything i just flip the page put the page flip the page will be paid in no time at all people are done because it doesn't carry the weight i have no interest enough are so much things that i've already none nada nothing i'm not interested so paul was trying to say instead of worrying being anxious forget that idea whatever things are true whatsoever things are genuine watch the word things are authentic what people like we call them they like the negative they like the flare that goes with you you hear that you yeah you you you hear that and god lord you talk about this information i wouldn't go into any detail whatever is true whatever is lovely whatsoever is pure perfect chased uncontaminated think about pure as uncontaminated not you know it could be 60 right 40 wrong you know you cannot mix up no whatsoever is pure whatsoever is a good report good report not bad you know you know you're on the heat no if they benefit you if there be any praise think on these things friends what we think about what we meditate on have a greater effect on our lives that we think some time ago my grandson upset my knee have a park and he was in the park walking around and you know running in different things two little small guys just like himself maybe six six years old one sixth and then one five or four then park two never saw them before they came at their dialogue granddad and i see him talking to them so when he came i said what did you tell them he said to me i told them that my name is samuel david ovid say okay but you could see even at that age he has this confidence that he actually introduced himself now he wasn't taught to do that but he did that because he's aware of who he is and he's confident of who he is and i was amazed and i look at these things sometimes i see the confidence in the children you see adults without confidence adults that don't have that confident look that as the psychologist might say that quality of self-esteem we call a healthy self-esteem and you know when somebody has a healthy self-esteem they have no problem complimenting other people you see when people can't compliment people guys are signed up it's not issues and we know them we have seen them within church the people who cannot compliment they will receive compliments but they can't get and that speaks of a lot of things hidden under there sometimes it has nvidia without jealousy when you are comfortable with you as god has made you as god has blessed you you have no problem praising people and making people feeling good actually but abandon says a great man make other people feel great do you make other people feel great or do you find yourself trying to be little smallify i know that's not a word and um trying to shrink people like i tell people trying to hold somebody kind of doesn't make your light shine brighter yeah and it causes a whole fuss because you you really don't want that person light to shine and you should be happy for somebody light to shine you should be happy for somebody to be blessed because another person blessed that they could serve the lord in a blessed way the devil god gave him blessing for it not faith backside i know her brother say if i only get that car we'll call her go save the lord i'll be there i'll be taking service when you get the car back fighting the beach or everywhere else you see why didn't he call along him from himself so many people think that when they get this they do god better you could serve god right where you are how you are with what you have he doesn't need things he needs heart he needs you renew your mind but you have to actually make a deliberate attempt to do that because it is not automatic understand this if you are and i'm sure there are people here tonight that are negative beasts they will see the glass half empty than half full they are negative based it is not easy for you to come from negative b to positive business you have to make a deliberate choice no i'm not going to speak that i hear this with that person negative i'm not going to go there you have to make a deliberate attempt to adjust your thinking you have to get a renewal of mine and then it will come out your mouth and you choose not to speak negative can i tell brothers and ministers a lot of stuff among ministers i wanted to bring to the church i don't want it i see men through things in the church i the people know this and i know that and there's a lot of things that they they figure they have they speak to the choir they already supported the people so they can tell them anything but they point about it everybody doesn't possess them the same way the former president of america when he talked and he talked he's saying his things an ex-man half crack he ate a certain way and feel like to do certain things and he said but i didn't tell him do that he didn't say that but they hear that they hearing things they say he say so everybody doesn't possess things the same way so we can't just lose and that's why jesus even said be careful how you hear because what you hear have an effect upon what you meditate on your heart so when somebody speaks something negative about another person let's say it's a lie and you receive that until you say stop pull your verification for that you have two or three witnesses you're a recipient right you're telling them okay you know what i hear okay before you speak holy just hold it holy gently what you're about to say about that person is it very fine well sheila tell me no no is that two witnesses behind that because you see if you tell me something that is not true you will cause me to spread something that is not true and i don't want to do that so before you comment your stories get it verified you see what i'm talking about now so things that we hear have an effect upon what we meditate have an effect upon what we speak have an effect about that that's why sometimes somebody have a issue with somebody and they bring it and they put it on the family next minute the whole family have an issue with another family it's not fair it's not right when it's just an issue between two people that could have been sorted out don't be guilty of doing that don't be guilty of running and spreading false stories and stories because you hear it you see it back it's a choice we have it's always a choice you as a free agent of god give them a choice to live to believe to receive the act and i like to hold jesus over it you see a blind man when he came up to the blind man he go ask a blind man what do you want me to do for you and you know it sounds almost illogical because you could say the man is blind jesus supposed to know the man wants sight but that's not true we don't know the man wanted cyborg suppose he man jesus lord i want a million dollars i want this i wonder you don't know what any man had so jesus gives the opportunity for the man to express what he has in his heart if god is to come down tonight let's be close and ask you what is it that you want me to do for you what will your answer be let us bow ahead almighty god i thank you to be here tonight it's such a privilege and an honor to speak to your children and i'm trusting lord and hoping that the few words spoken here tonight will help transform their minds i presented the thought to renew their mind think on these things i will not bring in foreign things or strange things strange fire or strange gods or strange words things you already know i trust you all that you fire them up to rethink their thoughts and what they think on when they look at a brother or sister what are the thoughts that they hear it is so easy to fix people into box boxes and fix them into a concrete as if they can't change but that's not true people can change but it has to start somewhere and you talk about in your world be transformed by the renewing of your mind it has to start somewhere a thought and a word and a manifestation lord may not thought that tonight that i can meditate on whatever is true whatsoever is lovely whatever is pure whatsoever is noble honest whatsoever is a good report and to think on these things you give us words that we could think on meditate on take a pause a seller and wait on your father bless them tonight i appreciate they coming out and listening and i trust that it wouldn't fall to the ground but with stirring hearts like david they'll be stood to apply it to their lives granted father bless the common services coming sunday may you be glorified and honest and jesus might ask it amen amen god bless you thanks thank you for being here tonight appreciate you i trust that this was helpful to you in some way and that god tremendously bless you god bless you have a great night
