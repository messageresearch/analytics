among us and he's no longer there that our eyes can see but we know he lived and just as he was among us and he laughed and shared himself and talked and through and everything else and he's gone the same way that jesus was among us and he died but the difference is he rules from the dead and releases spirit that can have an effect upon our lives tonight is a special night i'm happy to be here i'm glad to be here i'm glad to see all of you out here tonight to honor such a precious soul and um tonight i have something that i believe that i i feel god put up on my heart to share with you tonight and the title i have tonight here is the decision to serve the decision to serve so i want to read a scripture from matthew chapter 25 and reading from verse 14 to 40. i'll let you sit down for this picture i want to read the whole thing jesus speaking he said for the kingdom of heaven is as a man traveling into a far country who called his own servants and delivered unto them his goods onto one he gave five talents to another two to another one to every man according to his several ability and straightway took his journey then he that received the five talents went and traded with the same and made them another five times likewise he had received two he also gained another two but he that received one went and in the earth and hid his lord's money after a long time note after a long time the lord of those servants commit and reckon it with them so all the talents and gifts that we have all the talents and gifts that god has given us there will come a day of recording of what we do with those gifts and talents and so when he had received okay and and so he that received five talents came and brought the other five times and said lord don't deliver us unto me five talents behold i've gained besides them five times more his lord said unto him well done thou good and faithful servant though i've been faithful over a few times i will make the ruler over many things enter into the joy of the lord he also that received two talents came and said lord don't deliver us unto me two talents behold i've gained two other talents beside them his lord said unto him well done good and faithful servant god's been faithful over a few things i will make you ruler over many things enter into the joy of the lord note here how god weighs and considers faithfulness not faithful to much yet but faithful to little so the little god gives to you and i he looks to see how he manages it if you can't manage ten dollars how do you manage i thought the camera is a thousand dollars every month a hundred thousand dollars if you can't manage that particular marriage ten million dollars so god looks to see the measure of faithfulness and the other day when i spoke about about putting away idols and um dog shall have another gods before me that is like floating calling god your lover calling god your husband and your fool along with other gods and he hates that because he i'm a jealous god even hell would i put you here i give you eyes mouth hands i give you life and you want to worship some other god even the god of your own imagination your own thoughts so then he that received the one talent came and said lord i i know thee that taught a hard man reaping veda has not sown gathering where thou has not straw and i was afraid and went and did i talented the earth look dear dog has that is nine so you know will this man get one i said lord look i have where you give me i i'll come and bring it back for you we're gonna make one look look one yes i keep it behind it i bury it i know your heart and look i'll bring that one listen to the lord's response his lord answered and said to him though wicked and full servant the newest i replay i should not and god that way i have been struggled the author is therefore to have put my money to the exchanges and then at my coming i should have received my own with usury which is like interest take therefore the talent from him so this man have won he presented to the lord one and god said what he has take it from him the one that he has says oh god poor one look at paul no ain't poor one you know god said take that one from him watch and give it unto him which are ten talents and then listen to this statement for everyone that had that for every one that had shall be given and he shall have an abundance from him that hath not shall be taken away even the that which he had and cassie the unprofitable servant into outer darkness there shall be weapon of teeth when the son of man here we go shall come in his glory and all the holy angels with him then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory and before him shall be guarded all nations and he shall separate them one from another as a shepherd divided his sheep from the goats and he shall set the sheep on his right hand the goats on his left then shall the king see unto them on the right hand listen to these words ye blessed of my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world amen for i was hungry and you gave me meat i was thirsty and you gave me drink i was a stranger and you took me in naked and you closed me i was sick and he visited me i was in prison and you came unto me then shall the righteous answer and say no what when so we the hungered and fed or toasty or give the drink when so we a stranger and took me in or naked and clothed or when so we be sick and imprisoned came unto thee and the king shall answer and said unto them verily i say unto you in as much as you have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren you have done it unto me amen then shall you say unto them that on the left hand depart from me he cursed into everlasting fire prepare for the devil and his angels for i was hungered you gave me no meat i was thirsty you gave me no drink i was a stranger you took me not in naked you clothed me not sick and in prison you visited me now then shall they also answer him say when saw we thee a hunger than the thirst or stranger or naked or sick or in prison and did not minister to thee then shall we answer them saying verily unto you inasmuch as you have did it not to one of the least of these you did it not to me and these shall go away in the everlasting punishment and the righteous and the life eternal you can stand for this other scripture here you say stan this is some revelation chapter 20 dr finance i'll read it verse 11 to 15 and i saw a great white throne and him that saturn it from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away and there was no place there was fungal please for them i saw the dead small and great stand before god so when you're dead you're done say hey no it has something called the second death every man evil man wicked man murderer man drug lord man that the police are holding catch and they're dead they still had a reason i saw the dead small and great stand before god and the books were open and another book was open which is the book of life and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books listen according to their words not even from the book but according to their works and you see give up the death which were in it and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them you have dead people in debt and in hell and they had to come up to to face this judgment so people who think they escaped they still have to meet this god appreciation about tonight it's not a game it's not a show this is for real and the sea gave up the dead which were in it and death and hell delivered of the dead which were in them and they would judge every man according to their works again and death and hell were cast in the lake of fire this is the second death and whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fact let's bow here toward the prayer heavenly father we so grateful to be here tonight we pray your blessing upon us among us and our family whole household and bless the garden of the believers here tonight and given honor and respect to our brother who has wanted to be with you jesus and lord i could see you say enter into the joys of the lord for he truly did serve and i pray tonight that the few words would still the people's heart that they would look at themselves as a mirror of the word and see where they stand in this fate granted lord in jesus might ask amen you may be seated thanks again for coming we certainly appreciate all of you being here tonight so the title as i told you is the decision to serve another few comments here uh decision to serve it's a choice you have to choose there are only two masters god or the devil it is up to you whom you would serve but among us nicholas was a servant and i have a question to ask tonight do you think that you can serve god without serving others i want your way that taught tonight do you think you could serve god without serving others you see many people are religious not spiritual religious could make you feel you could bring me accountable you could do whatever you want to do and you're serving the lord and you're not serving anybody but jesus said i was sick and you visited me i hungered and you fed me he said these things so to me it is impossible to claim to serve god and you don't have a channel that you could serve but amanda's served and he served well he didn't sell for money he didn't save for pay for fame he didn't save for photographs on instagram he didn't serve to please anybody he's still because he loved god he served god people whether people painted or not he will paint i remember when we were plants in the building before we could even finish complete plaster a brush coming from and i challenge you tonight that is impossible for you to claim to be serving god and you can't serve others because perfect eternal life is living for others hallelujah that is what this is about and the servants because that's what we are here for not to be lord over anybody but the silver oh you think about that as soon as somebody get too carpet two days two days two days they'll talk somebody then support the car and you see something kind of thing like that then they up someday and you watch them show up and you're waiting till they'll come down because it's coming after a while i watch it over the years see people climb into power take power assume power pretend they are power and all and afterwards see them come down from the stairs hitting the up and same one by one they're coming down and you ask yourself the question was it worth it i remember i work in schools and so on and i heard a young boy sing i want a young student he said i want to be a drug lord i would say really i overheard the conversation i said why what that is it doesn't have plenty money i see the dead young you know i see you never saw this young guy i was there young i watch my soul so he sees what people looking at but jesus gave the answer here i was sick and he visited me the other so he said get away he said he said when it is that he was sick when we didn't bring it he said but you didn't do it to none of them because they've done it until the little ones you've done it until so you cannot really serve god without serving others i want to bring the thought of being a silver because the servants there is a welcome enter into the joys of the lord you know people let's do like every funeral service everybody going down you know that's not true you know that is a lie let me say it again every service whether it's baptist catholic methodist joe witness hindu muslim any everybody think that people dead once a day going to heaven the bible adam without smoke cigarette woman money liquor whiskey he died because god said did they you eat thereof that did you die i wish we could take god just what he said because god has kept his word we just talk this kind of thought because he's a good god every time we're doing the wrong thing and we've got every time you're judging he killed two million people in the after he brought them out to them you got what i said 400 years then bondage he bring them without killing them they perished you know when they're on after their children the proof is kind of lying because you say your people your people in other words when your fathers fail you let the next generation get a chance so god has no time to waste you know moses myself and he's dead joshua take over what happened joshua take over if these people don't want to take my word i'm going to raise up another generation hallelujah that is what god does never see a fake you know what i said before the fake plan even put on the flower to get the first and the fake it that sucker you know if you kill the thing you have other ones coming up here that is the law of nature every seed must be fought after its kind everything must survive and live and that is why we say faith of the fathers is living still in spite of fire dungeon and sword they can't stop us they cannot kill us they can wipe us out god will always have the seed of the righteous on the earth and mundus was one of them [Applause] nothing could stop that nothing could stop that through the dark ages so much 68 million christians were killed by the catholic church there was one pope one and called legalized murder to kill christians that didn't believe what they believed and that didn't come back again that's saw the oopsie killing you could see in africa the spirits you know when people are killed six million jews spirits you know amen them spirits and killing spirits where they won the lineman it's all translated upon these evil wicked men in charge of nations in charge of bombs inside of weapons in charge of missiles evil men that's right when a murderer get killed they hung him be dead what spirit upon the weather had gone when i drunk lord dead wait where that spirit upon the way god he jump on somebody else when a sexy spirit all the people who want to go and bought a hole in the airs and everybody else they're boring and when that they're dead michael jackson has dropped his spirit upon him drop on somebody else god help us tonight and that holy ghost that god chopped down until we have pentecost that same holy ghost drop down on others somebody else from generations and generation of generation god has purpose that in the last days there's gonna be the seed of the righteous there will be genuine people that go to serve god and what i'm saying tonight you cannot really serve god without saving others [Music] hallelujah hallelujah i was sick you never visit me i was hungry never feed me some people didn't wanna ask if you're hungry but they don't wanna touch their wallets you know they don't wanna pop nothing over there you're going all right all right all right you know the person's content you know they're hungry but because you don't want to push your hand in your pocket and help them god bless you jesus demonstrated my feet washing listen the way we ought to serve one another jesus christ come you take a clot and he started to wash the feet peter you see peter yeah yeah jesus you know he said he want more than watch people and then jesus demonstrated them how to serve how to wash down their feet now understand this we do feed washington church but you know that is people with feet that have socks in it and the day before they come to church we assume that they had a good bath and they wash their feet and so on like that and you wash clean feet but when you really think about it in jesus time it didn't have maxi taxi and didn't have socks i don't think jesus wears socks maybe he didn't invent socks that time so was sanders a lot of cow dung on the road and donkey yeah maxi so when you're walking is a set of mess and dust and in africa i uh was a hotel one time and hey i said what is that when i open the window is because them fellas have some two sick ones and you know what that was all the sideways is moderates so when you come out you gotta change your shoes and then your shoes muddy and your tucked up and then clean your shoes so then there's shoe shining boys out there and there's a whole business out there so jesus disciples walk in the street foot dusty and everything else and when you come and wash feet because that is what you do when you have a function that's almighty wash your feet before coming in amen yeah come here with the nasty feet of the defeat yeah they get washed there in front of jesus show that that was the lowest job a feet washing flunky and jesus took up that roll to wash their feet and say what 100 feet and by this and all men know that you are my disciples so you can have private christianity you have i am exhibit nobody no i love the lord your love no lord if you love the lord it will obey what god said to save the lord you have to save others to save the lord you have to love others to save the lord you have to treat your enemy right treat your family right treat the people around your right because they can't live with them here trouble will be up there and haven't even had that trouble so you'll go to the other side and have sheep they have goats you have to examine which one you belong to or give the lord some praises tonight it was placed upon me to share this with you because brother mundus was a genuine servant you didn't beg him to save he'll have your corpse in the serve he had to call him to cut grass or paint or do anything they'll never wonder of course come now come now never he coming in front of you he coming ahead of you when you say so much that time he confronted you because that was in his heart hallelujah that is what we need to see genuine servants and when you cross over yonder the lord can say enter into the joys of the lord god good and faithful savage who are you servant today there are only two masters is either the lord or the devil let's continue mark 10 42-45 and jesus called them to him and say it unto them this is jesus speaking to his disciples listen to these words he said you know that they which are accounted to rule over the gentiles exercise lordship over them and their great ones exercise authority upon them and so shall it not be among you but whosoever will be great among you shall be your minister and whosoever of you will be the chief shall be servant of all wow you mean not not somebody opening your cargo because you are a celebrity no no no he that is the chieftain of the servant of all for even here's how he's comparing now even the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life a ransom for men so he's saying that i came to serve yes amen jesus called them to him and said to them you know that those who are recognized as governing and are supposed to rule the gentiles and nations lord it over them ruling with absolute power holding them in subjection and their great men exercise authority and dominion over them but this is not to be so among you instead whosoever desires to be great among you must be your servant amen you want water see what is the tree in them you want chicken or your one fish you want some more juice [Music] who doing that the great ones let's continue this is not to be so among you instead whosoever desires to be great among you must be your servant and whosoever wishes to be most important first in rank among you must be slave to all for even the summer man came not to have service remember to him but to save and to give his life as a ransom for many my thought tonight is the decision to serve maybe you never thought of it maybe you never asked me the question how can i serve in god's kingdom do you know sometimes when you ask for help or volunteer or something like that you know who will raise their hands these are people who automatically you know what's inside their hand but you could write down the name who will be there and there are some who one may be frozen or their hands i don't know but they don't have the inclination to have an interest can i help is there anything i could help is there anything i can help with tonight i come here to serve me me myself when i saw this when i when it came to me i mean i wasn't thinking i i was wondering what to say and always sort of try to look to the lord as to what to share with his people and this being such a special night in honoring and looking at the life of brother nicholas mundus monastic and there's thinking about it then it came to me about the decision to serve then i began to see him as a servant how we save god's people and and didn't say that you know some of yourself grumpy they want me to do it and he wasn't like that he had a joy sometime when i come down for this preaching he you don't know what to say he just watched them they smile i just laugh no words come with his mouth he is so enjoying the lord enjoying the word it was something else to behold you know him on the smile hallelujah just demon you don't know what to say you haven't just shake is it you don't know what to say but the joy was dead to save the lord and this is how god wants you to silver with joy the bible says rejoice ever more of course we have pressure who doesn't have pressure who doesn't have issues and challenges of course but the joy of the lord is your strength this is what you're living for you're not living for you here not living for new things because afterwards you're here might drop off you pom poms may not go on it praise god you're living for god you're looking for jesus you're not living because you're young because it will get all through and the greatest thing on this head will come on yours sometime in the future oh glory to god hallelujah so some point in time it had to hit that your life is on purpose and if god put you here the best thing you could do is to serve him with all your mind with all your heart with all your soul with all your strength glory to god and love your neighbor as you love yourself could we give you some praises tonight what the holy spirit is here tonight thanks for coming hallelujah praise god amen hallelujah listen to this one galatians 5 13 to 14 for brethren you have been called under liberty only use not liberty for an occasion of the flesh but by love save one another for all the law is fulfilled in one word even this thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself so this is good for the adventists who love the law and so on summarizing one word thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself listen to the amplified of this for you brethren we're indeed called to freedom only do not let your freedom be an incentive to your flesh and an opportunity or excuse for selfishness you see because the opposite of servant is selfish you thinking about you only about you you always talk about you know venturing small they love one another and whatnot when please please and all of a sudden all the sibling love just disappeared because things come into view oh my but jesus said here watch what he said don't that excuse for selfishness but true love you should save one another for the whole law concerning human relationships is complied with this one precept you should love your neighbor as you do yourself amen if you don't love yourself you have problems yeah yeah issues to love your neighbor because you have excuse issues we're dealing with you are nice we had to leave with us to deal with that that you have to feel a healthy way about yourself that you could appreciate and value others and instead of saying i love your dress i appreciate you you know what and call your mother you're looking at your dresses that will look better on me yeah you'll get away from all of that because what you love you're trying to encourage you want the support you want to lift up you see somebody in a hole you want to bring them up you know it's aha looks down there or looking down there no pull them up encourage them and i feel if are wrong keep want you all as the family to encourage one another support one another somebody in the hall bring them all they don't want to talk talk to them don't say i ain't talking to him because you're talking to me no can you do that i'm in my muscles nobody just fall does nobody call you i said do you call anybody she said no you want something but you're not going to give anything philippians 2 3 8 says let nothing be done to strife or vainglory but in loneliness of mind seize the attitude let each esteem other better than themselves could you do that to see somebody better than you or do you have to be the best look in the mirror and say am i not beautiful think again think again look not every man on his own things but every man also the things of others you're looking out for your brother you're looking out for your sister you know water and come for three four days and your neighbor getting problems with water you have an extra kettle though give them share with them oh that would hurt some the long time people are saying good morning normal no no people not even saying good morning good morning that give me that pain you don't lose money if it's a good morning you lose your inheritance if you say good morning sometimes you light up somebody with a smile you can see her instead of walking around with a hard face you don't nobody tell you anything but smile on them that's my idea you make somebody feel good somebody's smiling you don't know what hole in what depression in and they see somebody getting a good spam come on we can do better than that or give the lord some praises hallelujah let not every man on his own things but every man also receives of others let this other say that there's a man in england my wife brought some attention that green pumpkins and he win a lot of pumpkin awards and um you know how they do it gigantic black guys and weighing so much and so on and he wins and so on you know what he did he ended up giving the neighbors a wrong all who planted the farmers the pumpkin seeds he had because he don't want them coco pumpkin come and pollinate with his pumpkin and and and lower the level of standard of his pumpkin so what he did he said yeah what i have great pumpkin look look you know some people say i know the formula don't don't go don't make your burger like my burger don't look at my sandwich i'm not gonna tell you the secret of my sandwich no this man shared his stuff and when he shared it everybody could grow and whatnot they could compete but he know he has other secret stuff that maybe he put in inside the ground i don't know but he makes sure he share you know what he does he's trying to keep his standard and that's what we have to do praise god if you don't share you don't come like them businessmen all the time they're making all their money and they're keeping salaries low and whatnot and only when they get breaking and they get somebody from them they say oh god people's content why are they amazing people pay why are they getting enough good money the bank's balling bowling ball is banking banking low any mortgage money they just keep pumping pumping pumping this profits this profit they don't care they only care about themselves but that is not christianity we are called to care for one another help one another support one another encourage one another because we have battle and all hell is against us we choose this way and you have to choose to serve you have to want to serve you have to love the sin oh blessed be the name of the lord so he had him with christ let his mind be you which was also in christ jesus would be in the form of god taught him not robbie to be equal with god but made himself of no reputation but and took upon him the form of a servant and made of the likeness of men and being found in the fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross someone escaped almost true i don't know but isaac here to say a few words praise the lord matthew 5 14 beautiful scripture ye are the light of the world a city that the set of the hill cannot be hit near women light a candle and put it under a bushel unless they want a banana table equation on them [Music] but on a candlestick and it gives it light under the old house let here we go are you ready listen to this wisdom let your light so shine not shine so shine before who men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven so god calls you a light you don't hide the light you put the light that others can see so god really want you to shame god wants a cup to run over what i if i was do i jump out to my secret that imagine your cup did you hear what i just said god wants your cup to run over god wants you to have an abundance in so much that you could bless others come and say a bigger amen than that [Applause] god wants to lift you up now listen if you don't believe that it wouldn't happen to you you know you have to believe that god wants to set you up as a light on a hill lord want this home here to be like a light in marawi and god want the individuals in this house to be like lights in maraval when ma is that they must say you know what what like go down by diana and them they have light down there they have christians down there it happens leave us down there we got people that believe god down there okay the lord some praises god wants your lies to be alive if it didn't know that tonight no you know that stop hiding stop talking stop popping and weaving god wants your life to be alike why that they could see your good works not bad was good words hallelujah and glorify god in heaven oh my god look at that final scripture mach 9 verse 33 and he came to capernaum and being in the house he asked them so what happened jesus saw this is grumbling among themselves and he wants to know what's going on with them said isn't it he said what was it that you disputed among yourselves by the way they're always arguing about but they have their peace for by the way they are disputed among themselves who should be degraded that was the argument that position do you agree jesus shake my hand longer than yours you reckon jesus called me often did jesus and he sat down and called the twelve and sent to them is any man desires to be first i know that wrong is that you know that's fine one of these words if any man denied the first the same shall be last of all and servant of allah amen hallelujah so jesus cancelled the whole argument you know what no wrong problem only first of all but in my program in my kingdom the first question to save so stop you know the bible talk about when you're invited to a place don't go and take the first cheated seat you see a secret gold lining on it and different things the one sitting on it and you think that your seat they say because there's somebody more honorable than you come you have to take you from this excuse me um could you move a little lower down because you know who come in here the prime minister or some or somebody coming the first man coming or the first lady coming to sit there so you say here what to do take the lowest seat first and then let them take you and say come here this is cetera take the lowest seat so don't hide the biggest sandwich don't do that and figure that what you're supposed to get don't do that so jesus he's teaching these principles of servanthood servitude how do we serve to me it's a decision you have to want to sing not for reward you should be scratching my back i will scratch yours somebody starts scratching your back because i know i mean my back is crashed so you have a business silver you serving under business deals see but that's all jesus wanted so i trust tonight these few words would resonate with you how much god wants us to be as silvers you can't be wrong seven i will close with this god call lord abraham and abraham out of his own country and so on again his family came along a lot abraham got blessed his cup ran over and it fell on a lot and his flocks and animals and everything else the husband unlocked with men and iran women started having disputes and arguments and so fight another clean thing so abraham called up aside and said look here what we are brethren you know let's not have any fights you go left i go right you go not i go south where you choose wherever you wanna go go when not look around so you look in his eyes now look towards sodom because some of them have water and planes and everything else and it's like going down one way that's fine i go anywhere desert wilderness and when abraham stepped away from allah god tells abraham look east best movements of all his others so see what is yours nobody could think what is yours is reserved for you but you have to believe what is yours and what is yours is what god has revealed to you as yours so you need to get in contact with god to reveal what is yours so when you see what is yours you didn't jealous anybody envy anybody want what somebody else have because you know assuredly he will give you what is yours praise the name of the lord let's bow our heads tonight heavenly father i thank you to be here and i pray god that your presence would saturate the lives of these people here we honor the memory of what amanda's as a servant of yours who serve the saints who supports people who serve his family he's always doing something always have a vision to do this and to do that never lazy never slept never thoughtful just being business-like we could look and see where he added lord he didn't take that one talent and buried it no he multiplied it and now we have a productive family that is blessed by you father we pray you're under your word amongst them when any in sick healing and he's dying and all lift them up are you struggling raise them up sitting restore them do something special for them and most of all may your hand of protection be upon them in this evil day bless these precious believers and saints and guests that are here may you honor their fate in receiving what was spoken because one day we all will have a recognition with the talents and gifts that you have given to us and what we have done with them father may this be a special night in the hearts and minds of the children granted lord in jesus name amen but anthony come and sing a few songs when i called brother isaac i'm going to share a few words he was a real partner to bala mundus i've got laughs and everything else but i suppose definitely have something to say amen you appreciate the pastor this evening and then and it's a great privilege to be here once again this is familiar ground many many years we had many wonderful services in this very spot and um over the years but amanda's had a unique way about him whenever situations you know got a certain way he said could we have a service his default response was you know so um once again we are gathered and um it's such a fitting tribute to be able to come together and have another service uh in a special way to salute his life his family his testimony and i remember i spoke here just about last year or so and the title i would have taken was remember me and it was based on remembering what he stood for what he longed to see the desires of his heart and that passion still burns with what he represented to us and in particular over the last you know year and beyond as we were in this whole pandemic and we had so many of the tapes from before you know where the mothers had a certain seat in church so whenever you see the service play you're seeing there for a split second you almost forget that you go on because you're seeing him there on the video every sunday every wednesday and he had one approach it was a worshipper whether he was feeling tired he was a worshipper i remember by the wonders full of sleeping church and his wake up response was glory he was a worshiper it didn't matter what the situation was he was a worshiper amber of it so beautifully described him as a silver and then just for two three minutes before brother anthony comes i just want to speak about the fact that brother mundo's had a genuine connection with god and it's that connection with god is what led him to live his life a certain way that is the reason it was not sure it was not performance he wasn't doing it for credit it wasn't if he was the only person by the tabernacle he was the only person by the tabernacle if nobody else was there he was there and it wasn't because of anybody else it was because of his connection with god and one thing that he was he was in his heart is for his family so for the next few minutes this little encouragement is dedicated to his family his immediate family he the extended family and the wider family of god that are connected so i just want to read one scripture you don't have to stand for it but in john 15 and reading from verse 5 and the vine he are the branches he that abideth in me and i in him the same bring it fought much fruit for without me you can do nothing if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is withered so if you are living in god you are cast and withered and withering is a process it's not immediate it means the longer you stay away from the presence of god is the more you wither and when you come back into the presence of god the situation begins to change and we see the historical evidence in the old testament when aaron forgot his rod and the holy of holies that rod was dead but in the presence of god overnight it came back to life so it had nothing to do with how long it was out of fellowship or how long it was out of presence or how long it was dead the moment it came back into contact with presence life started to show once more now what i encourage you tonight it doesn't matter how long you've been in church or what's going on or whatever it is if you get back into presence i'm not talking about church i'm talking about presence of god then something has to happen in your life and and verse 7 if you abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what he will and it shall be done unto you hearing inside of this that's what hearing is is my father glorified that he bear much fruit so shall he be my disciples as the father had loved me so have i loved you continue in my love if you keep my commandments you shall abide in my love even as i have kept my father's commandment and abide in his love these things have i spoken unto you that my joy might remain in you so there's a desire for all of this that his joy remains in you and that your joy might be full where is your joy tonight is your joyful is it joy three quarter way is it halfway god's desire is that your joy is full this is my commandment that you love one another as i have loved you greater love have no man than this and a man lay down his life for his friends if you are my friends if you ye are my friends if you do whatsoever i command you a skip of one verse one last verse you have not chosen me but i have chosen you and ordain you that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit shall remain that whatsoever you shall ask of the father in my name he may give it to you i want to ask one question tonight what are you connected to that's the question but among us was connected to something bigger than himself he was connected to a source that when money was low he had a better source he was connected to a reality that when the world looked glim and this doomy and he should be depressed and frustrated he was connected to something else and the reality is we are here tonight because of a connection it's greater than what we can do ourselves but it is a connection that has kept us through this pandemic through this time it is a connection but i want to challenge you tonight what are you connected to we live in a connected world technology has connected us emails phone technology all these things all exist to keep us connected had it not been for technology when we were on lockdown we wouldn't have no kind of church but technology allowed us to have bible studies and allowed us to have live streaming services it's important to have connections and the ability to be connected we are connected by geography if it wasn't for the fact that this was an island and we all on the same island but the clarence you would never know me and i would never know you but we are connected by the fact that we are on this particular ground we are connected tonight because we are in this room this space this is space something has brought us together and whether you accept it or not we are connected and physics says whenever two particles come into contact with other it with another it's called entanglement it can never be separated that's physics so the connection tonight whether you understand it or not will forever change your life they are connections in nature they are connections in science they are connections in the spiritual god always longed for connection he existed by himself before there was a moon before there was a star before there was man on the earth he longed for a connection and when god said let there be light that was not enough of a connection for him because he couldn't fellowship with the light oh when he created the moon and the stars he was longing for a deeper connection but the connection he didn't have it with the moon and the stars and the mountains and the valleys and the rivers and the animals but when he put man on the earth for the first time god said ah this is the connection that i'm looking for this is the connection that with a mundus found it was that great connection with his creator do you know that you didn't make yourself you didn't choose to be here it's your creator put you here for one reason and one reason only to have a connection with you what a horrible life to live without ever meeting your creator the man who puts you here what life of purposelessness you experience if you don't even know the reason you are born the only reason you can come to know why you are born is to get connected to your creator you meet any young man or young woman who don't know their parents maybe they adopted or whatever it is there's a desire in them i want to know who my father is i want to know who my mother is do you know do you know and and young children as they grow older when they realize this is not their home and maybe they've been adopted you could never beat out of them the desire to figure out who their natural parents are so deep is a desire for connection with where you come from and we live in this world a world of connections that are distractions it is the tv it is the internet it's all the news and it's really distraction because if it catches your eyes enough to keep you away from your purpose then you live like a robot you get them in the morning is your news they get up here in facebook you see what happens and if you can live in that glaze that day that exists you will never come to your full potential but thank god for services like these that remind us that we are not robots that we are not part of the technology that we are not drones walking around without purpose but we are called a higher purpose that can only be known when the connection is re-established god had a connection with adam you were coming in the cool of the evening just like this evening and have just a fellowship how was your day how did you feel what did you what did you do was it a productive day what animal did you name what did you change etc etc until man fell and broke the connection and from that time to now we have been fighting to re-establish the connection come back back into so no wonder when jesus came he said i am the vine and you are the panties you are supposed to be connected to me if you're not connected to me you have no purpose you have no life you have no destiny i thank god but among us found his connection because we could rejoice knowing he is with his father what are you connected to tonight i'm about to close there's a connection between labor and reward people want to achieve things without working for it but there's a connection between effort between studying for an exam and successfully passing the exam there's a connection between actions and consequences and they are consequences for all actions good actions bad actions in action that's also an action you know connection between study and results connection between what you eat and how you feel a connection between your rest and your ability to be productive a connection between your joy and your strength the bible tells us the joy of the lord is your strength anybody with anybody with me tonight a connection between your prayer life and a revival a connection between the alpha church and the omega church a connection between being in the presence of the lord and living your life a certain way a connection between the friends of your job in your school in the neighborhood and your heavenly host and one day you have to fellowship with them a connection between the world and the spirit the connection between sowing and reaping there's a connection between the prophet and his prophecy a connection between worship and your breakthrough a connection between the seed in your soul and the god who put that seed in there that the devil wishes he could destroy but no demon no weapon no principality no power nothing present nothing faster to become could break that connection that god has you belong to god and nobody contains that let the devil put it in his pipe and smoke it you belong to god and the devil cannot change it your mistakes cannot change your connection your failures cannot change your connection your past on this earth cannot change your connection because your connection is not of this world your connection is subject to the eternal bonds that were there before there was a moon before there was a staff before there was a problem before there was rent before there was a mortgage before they were sickness and before they were doctors anybody with me i'm closing [Music] david lost his connection and he penned the song he said restore unto me the joy of my salvation he didn't lose his salvation but there was a joy that was missing he was connected but not as connected as before he said restore unto me the joy of my salvation i don't know what commission you came here tonight you could begin to play something softly i'm finished i don't know what you came here tonight but i want to challenge you the same way but the oneness got connected i want to make sure that you are connected i challenge you and i don't leave this service without getting reconnected to god he is waiting for you because he made you and all god loans for is to have a relationship with you to have a connection with you and him this is not you and the church you and your husband you and your wife you and your family this is just you and god alone that if nothing else would exist in the world yes you and god have such a connection that nothing could break the connection friends don't let your bills break the connection don't let your problems break your connection legend for our heads for word of prayer heavenly father we thank you lord for this great opportunity to come one more time lord into your presence the psalmist david said i was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the lord and father tonight at this very moment this is your house we declare this ground as holy ground father
