from your people so may you bless us tonight as we wait on you in the precious name of jesus christ amen and amen and amen so certainly a great privilege to be here tonight uh once again for our tuesday night bible study and i certainly want to salute um brother ovid and brother stephen who would have done the the last series of bible studies and certainly i have been blessed and i know you have been blessed as well how god has been revealing himself to us through scriptures through quotes through statements through uh inspirations and nuggets and and ways for us to see god in his plainness especially in a time as this and i said he want to salute brett over for the message on sunday russia the king of the north uh what a true masterpiece and and underscoring it all acknowledging that the ceiling time is here you know and um you know i i it's something it's something else when when you know it's not even just in the ecclesiastical realm or the church realm but you know i went for my haircut in the barber shop and it was the conversation it was a topic it was the theme you know wars rumors of wars the end of times and and many of people in the conversation aren't necessarily church folk as it were but there's a buzzing there's a conversation there's a there's a consciousness that things are not normal you know we spend two years going through a pandemic and then there's war and there's change and there's currencies and the markets and you know all of these things that are happening you know it you don't need to be a spiritual rocket scientist to know that the the the the forces that are supposed to be gathering together are gathering you know and i really appreciate but always approach last sunday you know yes we understand what's happening in that realm but more than that it is what do we have to do you know we could spend hours and hours analyzing you know history the history and and russia and the granular details of it but if at the end of that analysis you haven't changed your walk you haven't changed your talk you are not death spirit for the holy ghost then we miss the mark somewhere you know so these things are just signs of the times and the reality is there are those who will see the signs be aware of the signs be conscious of the signs and still not take any action still not change still not do something different in their walk and their talk and that is what we want to be so sensitive of that being in the position that we are in by the grace of god where we understand things that are to be that we don't get so caught up in studying the things that are to be that we miss us getting ready to give an answer for our hope and our walk and our talk and that is the underlying passion and the zeal of finding the balance between analyzing what is happening in the economic realm and and cryptocurrency and the conspiracy theories and the the nato and the u.n yes it's important and and i spent time looking at it but it has to be a balance between understanding these things and crying holding on to the horns of the altar because the angel has not putting a mark upon them who understand these things and putting a mark upon those that sigh and cry for the abomination that's in the city so i really want us to be sensitive and to be conscious you know of these things you know so i'm trusting the lord tonight i have a little thought um that i wanted getting to but i really in my heart to really have you know a burden to just have a conversation as we are approaching this time that we are living in you know and um it's really it is it is so paradoxical how quickly things can change you know we are we are we are on an island and and for us who are here in trinidad we have not experienced anything that europe and these countries would have experienced in you know world war one and world war ii and and what is happening now you know some countries can't understand it you almost have to have been there or have people who are connected to it to kind of see it but the reality was that if you were to rewind the tape on february 23rd things were normal in ukraine because the invasion started on february 24th one day later it was an entirely different situation for some people the building that they worked in no longer exists if you ask them just a week ago just a week ago was february 22nd and for some people their homes existed today their home does not exist for some people a week ago the road existed now the road no longer exists for some people the airport that they would get out at night and look at and see planes coming in would have existed a week ago and fast forward one week later the topography the landscape the atmosphere the noise the smoke the smell you you you can't walk the street the way you did a week ago the situation has changed and it makes us so conscious of how quickly things can happen in a natural and even how much more quickly could happen in the spiritual because god's prophet told us just overnight the power of god can sweep around the world just overnight we could be having a bible study tonight at next week tuesday we don't know if you're gonna have a bible study oh i want you to catch that tonight we don't know what one week from now holds we don't know what two weeks from now holds we don't know what a month from now holds because it could be that rapid so i just want to share a few things with us for a few minutes i don't intend to be too long but i want to touch on on a few things and then one scripture that we have looked at before but in light of recent events i was looking at it again and somehow it just resonated and i want to bring back you know some of it again so just to introduce it it is often said that you are the sum total of all of your experiences the good experiences the bad experiences all of this in combination is what makes you uniquely you when somebody meets you they may not know your story but you walk with your story you walk as a result of how you grow up the struggles you had to face the successes you enjoyed the failures you endured and in combination the equal sign it makes you uniquely you positioned to do certain things position to achieve certain things by virtue of what you have been through when we look at the achievements of certain people we can often trace back situations that led to the person that they are today we look at certain people and we could look back and see because of what their struggle was this is why they are the way they are and there's nothing wrong with that because that is something that is unique and it is a journey that people go through for many of these peoples these experiences are not deliberate we don't have control over the house that we are born in we don't have control of whether we are born into poverty or born into wealth we don't have control if we are born into a single parent home or uh a home with a mother and a father we don't have control if we grow up with our father alone or a mother alone all these things but all of these things add up to the character and the nature of who we are and how we respond to situations how we deal with situations how we resolve conflict and how we deal with challenges in this scenario the experiences are not deliberate it is not planned it is just how life unfolded and the unfolding of life led to the way a person moves so somebody didn't have much growing up so they they they they put certain things in a certain way because they never had and they don't want to ever go through their experience and not having so so they they conduct business a certain way i want to call these people the type one for the purpose of this little study tonight the type one the people who they are who they are because their lives just unfolded that way and it gave them a strength to do what they do well there's another type of person they are those who prepare all their lives for certain types of roles in life you don't just wake up in the morning and decide i am going to the olympics this year it doesn't work like that you need to train for it you need to study for it you need to practice for it you need to understand what it takes what it requires that is what it takes to achieve it and you work hard for it you don't wake up in the morning and decide i'm going to be a doctor today there's a process to become a doctor so let's call these people the type 2 they who have prepared trained practice and sharpen their skills to be who they are so type one they are the ones who life unfold in a certain way and that's why they are the way they are type two those who prepare for a certain thing and they are who they are because of that tonight i don't want to speak about type 1 or type 2. tonight i want to speak about another type because sometimes just sometimes situations come that nothing in your past could have ever prepared you for it and you never had the opportunity to train for it i would like to call this type type three and to give context to this a little bit just building on recent events we don't have to look too far because just a few days ago on february 24th 2022 russia invaded ukraine and almost seven days have passed in what by most reasonable expectations people didn't expect to take this long there are many levels we can discuss in this but i just wanted to share a few thoughts on this and see perhaps if there are any lessons we can learn for our lives but before i get into that i want to read a quote from the prophet in a message victory day whereby abraham was bringing out something and i want us to keep this as an anchor point before we go on but the brandon was saying nations want to see their own way germany wants to see their way alone russia wants to see their way alone america wants to see her way alone it's the spirit of the nations you find it wherever you go you find a national spirit he said it's so strange if i had the time i'd just like to skip through some of the nations and show you he said when you go into germany you find a military spirit everything is military you have to stand straight walk straight cut your corners everything is military you go into france you find any moral spirit woman wine liquor you're going to finland a loyal spirit you can go into america but the banana is running through different national spirits somebody tell a dirty joke and everybody laugh at it and he goes on listen to this and then those spirits get jealous of one another you see and when those spirits get jealous of another spirit what do they do they cause war that's right and you see every nation is controlled by satan the bible said so he is god of the nations satan took jesus up top the mountain and show them all the kingdoms of the world and say these are mine i do with them anything i want i'll give them to you if you worship me so there are multiple levels like i said of this thing all right so and listen carefully now but the balance says when god comes again and takes his kingdom see there will not be any different kinds of spirit a german spirit a friend spirit a norwegian spirit an american spirit there won't be that it'll be one spirit the spirit of god living in every heart there'll be one flag one nation one people a brotherhood a fatherhood of god and a brotherhood of men sonship then we find that because that people do this and called all these fusses and all these things and then he types it into matthew 24. verse 6 and he shall hear wars and rumors of wars see listen and this this this is your encouragement and you shall hear of wars and rumors of wars see that ye be not troubled for all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet for nations shall rise against nation it is not perhaps is that maybe this is jesus's words nations shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom and there shall be famine and pestilences and earthquakes and diverse places all these are the beginning of sorrows so what we are seeing is just the beginning of sorrows i hope this resonates tonight just a short encouragement to you then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and you shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake and then many and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another and many false prophets shall rise and shall deceive many and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall walk schooled but he that shall endure unto the end the same shall be saved and this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations and then the end shall come so i wanted you to pain this as a context because before going further i want us to really realize that behind everything that's happening right now are spiritual forces so while you can pick up the news and read about the united nations and the european union and nato and governments and all these things the reality is they're only two influences and they're only spiritual works and all of these organizations that exist are really the manifestations of of the spiritual realm that is bringing us closer to leaving this place i don't want us to lose sight of that because this allows us to not even from a spiritual perspective try to take a side with anything the reality is we understanding that satan is ruling what's happening and at the same time god has an agenda a program that i believe is happening right now in this room to prepare a bride to leave this place by placing you into his body to give you power because you will need power anybody believe that tonight but just to come back into context to deal with what's going on we have a situation as you all know where russia a country with 144 million people and arguably the world's largest reserve of nuclear weapons an army of over two million more tanks planes etc that you can count invaded a country with just 44 million people with almost no kind of weaponry to match and if you were looking at it on paper it should have been an obvious situation of who would win but for some reason it just hasn't panned out that way and what may have been expected that it should be a quick victory has not been so we have only one hand a powerful nation with his armory it's artillery its sophisticated system and its leader who has military espionage experience and a country that is smaller with a president who up to just a few years ago his job was a comedian it's a paradox how these things unfold i'm not going to spend too much time on these characters there are some lessons that i want to identify because in life and we have to appreciate this life is not fear war is not fear situations are not fear and there are times in life it may appear that you have an advantage and there are times in life it will appear you have a disadvantage there is no question from a surface of looking at this situation that ukraine would appear to have a disadvantage the odds would be against them they have a smaller army they have a smaller population they have a less experienced leader up to how many years ago five six years ago he wasn't even into politics against a nation that had existed for very long with military mighty experience with a leader who has been a leader for a long time and it has caught the eye because even for me looking at my own life and seeing i spent some time studying the linksy because it just blew my mind where he came from what makes this man because he doesn't have the military experience and i was saying to my wife look how your situation in the past really can't stop you from becoming something he was not a general he didn't grow up in the army he didn't cheat and train for this he didn't prepare for this but he is in a position of leadership with choices and decisions to make and he is making it but ovid would have referenced our conversation that we had when i said they tried to extract him he said you and your family can take you or they say i don't need a ride i need more weapons this is not a fighter this is a man who is fighting for a reason and it stirred my heart because it began to me ask question do we have a reason to fight what in our lives or around our lives do we count worth fighting for because many of us in a situation like that if given the opportunity to jump in a plane and fly out we will take it we may take it because it's the easy way out what makes some people take the easy way out and some people take the risk of the hard way young president is quoted as saying if i have to die i'll die here with my soldiers and it shakes you to the core because that is real we we sing songs of it's dripping with blood and we reference the disciples and those who went through the ages who died for this gospel and i found myself asking the question are there people still around for whom this gospel is worth dying for because the people who are in ukraine it is mind-blowing i was having a conversation with a few of the version after church there was an accountant there and he said i never had a gun in my life if you asked me two days ago if i would be doing this you wouldn't even he said i can't even understand it two days later i don't even know if you know how to shoot but he has found a reason to fight so for a few minutes this evening i have a little thought conflict crisis and leadership conflict crisis and leadership because it is one thing that conflict and crisis would bring out is leadership choices decisions so far they are mapping those and there's nothing wrong with deciding to flee and to run into the border that is perfectly fine but if you analyze the numbers out of a population of 44 million people in ukraine i don't even think it has reached half a million has fled which means at this point in time over 40 million people are standing around saying listen if you want this you have to take me with it that is a resolute choice a decision that i want us to look at because is your family spiritually worth fighting for is your soul worth fighting for are you prepared to give up your comfort zone because the accountant who was interviewed he gonna say i'm unaccounted i'm not ready for this and in talking about type 1 type 2 on type 3 the ukrainian people without training without preparation have been forced to fight because they find a that's bigger than them i saw a picture of an 80 year old man who said he's fighting for his grandkids and we have young people who don't understand for the truth of this gospel they see no legacy they're just comfortable because these situations in their lives have not been rocked enough to create a crisis or conflict to demand leadership to demand a choice that i am not going to give my life to the world there's a reason to fight to live a holy life there's a reason to fight for righteousness i'm not speaking about natural war i'm talking about fighting for your soul for your house and so me and my house in interviewing them you have men standing in front of their apartment building because their families are inside and they say if they have to get to my family they need to go through me where are the spiritual men who say they want to get to my family i have to go to my wall of prayer conflict crisis and leadership what are you willing to fight for tonight what are you willing to die before tonight we speak of the disciples of all who are willing to die for this gospel how much are you willing to sacrifice how long will we make excuses of what we don't know and what we don't have and the reality is it is something that is such a unique paradox just like david against goliath goliath did not think when he looked at david david was a threat and so too the news anchors and the media is carrying the fact that the expectation was that the russian army would drive into ukraine but the ukrainians there was one story told of a certain bridge and the soldiers ukrainian soldiers at the bridge said we cannot allow the russians to advance over this bridge and one of the young soldiers was going to set up a bomb and he said there's not enough time to get away if this bomb explodes another young man said don't worry about it and he explored the bomb and he died with it and right there they shut down the advance of the enemy he was willing to die so that they don't advance the only thing that can make you do that is because you believe in something more than you it speaks of deep sacrifice and it's a stirring thing i'm not going to be too long with you but if he was a selfish person if he couldn't see the bigger picture if he couldn't see beyond himself and these are the things that have become unexpected can you move in an unexpected way and change the course of your house of your situation moses had excuses and god had to shut him up and say he's still going anybody with me what is your why is this a few questions we're just having a conversation tonight before we get into one scripture that we have read before but what is your why because that there represents the difference in the reason for fighting we have a situation now where soldiers out of russia are are fighting because of the only payroll they are commanded to go in but ukrainians their why is very different the reason they are fighting is because this is my father's house my child this is my land i grew up here i'm doing this for my children are doing this for my family i send my wife out but as a as a man and this is my house i don't like nobody take me the why is very different than you why creates a a drive with limitations to do what has never been done before are you willing to fight for your house but let me even go deeper because the reality is we are challenging in this meeting here tonight to fight are you willing to fight for your health some of us take our health for granted so it's not just a spiritual challenge here tonight it's a challenge to us as individuals to be the best that we can do are you willing to fight for your health are you willing to fight for your financial future are you willing to fight for your prayer life this is a different kind of bible study tonight are you willing to fight for your prayer life to fight for your prayer life means you have to make a choice of what needs to be sacrificed to pray you can't spend all your time at work and all the time doing other things and and not have time to to pray because it means you are not doing enough fighting are you willing to fight for spiritual breakthrough are you willing to fight for the unexpected are you willing to be unexpected i saw that the ukrainians ordered the country to take down these street signs point the street signs in another direction to confuse the russians and then google turn off google maps so if they were trying to use google maps they get lost if they're trying to follow these street signs they get lost it is a paradox when you look at the unfolding of this thing how the world could crumble and these things take place but the reality is i am not sure they expected these street signs to be turned around i'm not sure in innovation they expected the google map system to go down and the question you have to challenge yourself with because when shamga by the random typed out got frustrated with the philistines taken from him he took her ox gold and ran out to the enemy but branham said and he did what was unexpected in know they thought in themselves what this crazy man coming to do with this obvious good and the bible said he slew 600 with the ox good so he didn't approach them in a way they expected david didn't approach goliath anyway goliath expected even goliath had to ask the question am i a dog because the only way you'll be approaching something looking like that is if you're approaching a dog so am i a dog that that's how you're coming to me but the reality is david approach in an unexpected way so i want to challenge our thinking now sometimes we get tired of trying to do things a certain way but when your back becomes against a wall you need to figure out new ways and new things and it just blows my mind the innovation and the creativity and the ideas and your approach through the attack the internet when known in ukraine ukraine messaged elon musk the center to send internet a satellite moves in space comes over the country internet restored how do you piece these things together but the reality is the point i'm making here is at no point in time are they saying let's give up let's stop fighting let's stop figuring out are we and i want to challenge us from we don't know how this thing will play out you know but it's one thing i admire it is we are not giving up we will find a way if this don't work we try something else if this don't work we try something else if this don't work we try something else but whatever it is we want to make it to the other side question what do you do when the odds are against you what do you do when you are not expected to win what do you do when you are less than someone else because that's the reality of life and we are all faced with situations and challenges that force us in the face of conflict and crisis to figure out the next step not just accept life and situations the way it has been for a long time but look up square your head your strollers and say i'm not giving up things might be bad but it could have been worse i trust this encourage you in some way to really look at your family to look at where you are at right now to look at because it has nothing to do with your past anymore it is the current situation where you are now and where you want to be conflict and crisis demands leadership and i love leadership as a topic of study because kingdoms rise and fall on leadership companies rise and fall on leadership churches rise and fall on leadership families rise and fall on leadership teams and departments rise and fall on leadership marriage rise and fall on leadership and all of us are leaders in different ways even if it is just to lead our tongues even if it is just to lead our emotions and bring it under subjection anybody with me tonight what are you prepared to do so in looking at this situation that has unfolded i found myself drawn once again to nehemiah because i find that zilling caesar is an unlikely general so to speak he is being forged from being a comedian and when he read his story he was he had a tv show or a movie or a series called his wonderful people just as an actor his his role in the tv show as a comedian was he was playing the president and the people there became so fed up of the pavilion government that the tv production crew the senator registered political party with the name of the tv show i want you to think of the paradox of this thing they say the memory tv show is servant of the people let us name the political party servant of the people and the star of the show let him run for president and he won by a 73 percent vote unlikely leader now in a war many of us trust into situations where unlikely to succeed odds are against us things didn't work out the way we thought it would but we are in a battle we are in a war and so too nehemiah when we remember because we studied this last year me when i looked at spiritual leadership and we started with the fact that nehemiah was the king's kabira trusted by the king he had a prayer life he was not in jerusalem but he had a burden what was happening in jerusalem and when he heard a word of how bad things were when he heard word of the situation there it killed something in his heart i don't know if you remember this and it came out so much in his heart that the bible said he had never before been sad in front of the king his disposition was always happy his disposition was always positive whenever you see nehemiah as a positive person and the king took note of nehemiah's disposition and said what is wrong with you because i know you're not sick because the only way you could be looking sad is if you're sick so this have to be something deeper than sickness because i know you're not sick but if it is sad it has to be sore of heart and the bible says nehemiah prayed and he was a praying man and he prayed in his response and when the king asked nehemiah what you want the bible said he prayed again and i would have taught last time that what kind of prayer was this that nehemiah prayed when the king asked him it wasn't a timeout king let me go and pray and come back it meant that nehemiah's relationship with god was in such a condition that he was talking to god and saying lord just give me the right words he knew what he wanted he knew his knee the king was in a position to grant his request and he came and said what you want because this sadness that's over you i want to relieve this sadness and i want to challenge you tonight if there's conflict and crisis in your life and god we know is here tonight what to say to you tonight tell me what your issue is what you want what i could do for you are you in a position tonight to say lord this is what i need this is the situation this is what i've been praying about or are you saying lord i have a situation and i really and you just shrug at the side because that was the name he was able to say lord this is what i need i need this i need this i need this i need this i need this specifically because i want to go and deal with this crisis this conflict this situation there's nothing wrong church friends with having a demon crisis and conflict it is a part of life we all have situations that are crisis and conflict family issues work issues financial issues crisis and conflict things just aren't working out things not the way it is that's not the issue because that's life the issue is can you subject yourself to god's leadership and also be a leader in the midst of the crisis in the midst of the conflict in this situation can you do the right thing can you say the right thing can you ask for the right thing for four months nehemiah was praying for a way to get back to jerusalem to help his people are you praying are you seeking are you crying are you why are you seeing all these things happening around you and you're caught up in the news but but there's no change in your walking you're talking your life in your way i'm not going to be too much longer with you much of this is not new to you but i want to challenge you i want to see the leader in all of you the leader that can decide what to do and what not to do some of us have lost our way and the comfort of the things we know is what we think will carry us through we know what brother branham said we know what the bible said we know this and our knowledge knowledge is not a passport into where we need to go it's a change in our lives in the face of situations that demand more from us in how we deal with our families our loved ones the workplace news information our priorities i don't know if this is helping anybody but i look at nehemiah he was a cobiera who became a general i don't want to make and type better but here we have a comedian who was becoming a general by force he didn't choose it david didn't apply to be king you know he didn't put you a job application there was no vacancy that he submitted a resume for he was thrust by god into kingship let me say it again david didn't apply for opposition come on now paul who became soul didn't apply for the position or you don't hear me tonight he was chosen for the position just as you have been chosen for the position and that seemed david who was chosen for the position saul take a a spear and throw after him he still had crisis and conflict still had to run for his life and solo to kill him didn't change the fact that god shows him for the position and allowed crisis and conflict to exist in and around his life all the way through his life was crisis and conflict bathsheba crisis and conflict come on now his son after him to kill him crisis and conflict down to the end of his death bed he had to get natan and different ones to make sure that solomon was going to be named king crisis and conflict in the face of adversity in the face of his enemies the psalm speaks of the crisis and conflict that david had many idea that rise against me may i do that see of my soul there's no help for him and god crisis and conflict but yet in the midst of crisis and conflict it demands a certain level of leadership where are the leaders in marriages when there's crisis and conflict in marriage where are the leaders in the home when there's crisis and conflict in in siblings and brothers and sisters anybody with me who will be the bigger person who will be the leader who will lead towards a resolution a solution a target there's always an easy way out you know it blows my mind because i'm thinking zelinski was offered listen we would sign a plane and take you in a family out most of us take the easy way out of life that's human nature you know we take the easy way out we like the shortcut we don't want to do the work we don't want to put any time we want to know seven secrets to millionaire and forty years we hold on to these stories how this man became a success in five days all the foolishness because we want this shortcut and we don't want the character formation that comes from it i would say say it to my wife recently people hold on to different things they say um mark zuckerberg dropped out of school bill gates dropped this you know what school he dropped out of he didn't drop what a primary school in them then boys dropped a harvard university you know how hard it is to get into harvard it's not dropper because they don't want to do work it's because they got caught up and anointed for certain kind of work you have young people who never put no work in and say well if you could jump with a school and become a billionaire but that is why so many of them drop at the school and they make nothing with themselves because they never understood the effort and the time and the sacrifice that these people put in to be where they are now it is a process you have to acknowledge the process nehemiah was a prayer warrior can you be described as a prayer warrior is there a memorial that's written about your prayers so that in the time of crisis and conflict your prayers the vile of your prayers can be poured on top of your lord are needed no and you can make a withdrawal from the vial of your prayers and sword up all these years for your children for your son for your daughter for your marriage for your house for your finances for your need i don't know if this helping ceremony tonight but oh god help us help us help us because crisis and conflict it's gonna get worse these are the beginning of sorrows there's more pain coming think of it friends we went through two years you were with your two years of pain pain that even affected the all realms with the pandemic and then there's war friends i want you to appreciate the levels of this thing many may not understand that ukraine is one of the world's largest exporters of wheat russia is a major exporter of wheat right now oil prices are rising because supply lines have been cut when oil price rises when there's a wheat shortage that affects every country in the world you know so this war is not ukraine and russia this war is going to hit your pocket because there are economic effects of these things all of this is by design but i wanted to understand that god is allowing things to unfold because a new world order has to come that has to run in parallel with the forming of a lady an elect lady who is to come into power who is to reign on this earth called mrs jesus christ and it's not a fair fight is that a fair fight because we already conquered these stories already written we walk into the playbook everybody who is in this thing are doing their part of it i want to make sure we know we have a part in this thing and we have to do our part and our part is to get ready our pakistan is to put on that robe of righteousness oh come on now that robe of perfection that robe of holiness because that she'll be a pure she'll be a virgin she'll be a chase sin will not be able to stay in that church we can talk about russia for the week until we get sent out to church we have more work to do oh come on now somebody help me somebody help me tonight we can speak about the vibes any world war one come on now whoa whoa we can spend all the time until we get his sin out of the church until he's staking your heart gets dealt with until i give you a new spirit i put my spirit i change you until these things take place it is it is verbal gymnastics as the pastor would say we're spinning around words trying to pull from here in the end here what means a change and i pray that the crisis and conflict over the last few years and and the crisis uncovered that's coming more become more welcome because he said then when we need it god raises standard so things have to get worse and worse hallelujah anybody with me tonight is this is this helping anybody to shake us into the reality and consciousness that is sealing time is on and that stealing time is not brother over evaluating you is that the pastor evaluating you it is it is is the income right doing his investigation when you least expect it and when trouble come the words that come out your bounty is not worth that supposed to be spoken because you can't deal with crisis and conflict oh yes oh yes oh yes i would have said it when we were speaking about nehemiah and the teaching and i might share back the link again because there's some lessons in there nehemiah's the fourth response to every situation was pray you know when your phone goes bad you can reset it to factory settings the default settings before you it's all abstanding and what can i send you a mess of the phone and you can restore the phone to factory settings well nehemiah's his settings his default operation was pray what is your default operation where's your standard operating procedure where is he playable when people see you what do they see i don't know if this helping anybody tonight crisis and conflicts friends increasingly we will be put into situations where we have not been there before increasingly we will find ourselves in situations where we could have not think we were prepared for it that's how life is david could have referenced the lion and the bear and that helped give him defeat the goliath but david didn't say but you are the second goliath his excuse with goliath was his first time dealing with that particular situation and you have to change your attitude and approach to dealing with different situations it's easy to say i can't list listen friends i'll be honest i find myself there at times you know i'm not teaching you from a position of strength you know i'm teaching my opposition i'm fighting my way out of a trench in in a whole trying to anybody with me facing situations that you never faced before and you have to do what figure it out work it out sort it out find a way anybody with me so you have to have a mindset and this is the mindset there has to be a way because god is a waymaker even if i don't anyway yet it's just to find it because away must exist because god don't ever leave a situation where there's no way maybe you haven't seen anywhere yet maybe you don't know the way maybe you're walking in the wrong direction but there must be a way and if you realize that there must be a way then you ask a different question lord show me the way not i don't know and i'm not sure and i give up and i fed up and i try this and i try it and i try to there must be a way because god is a waymaker if we can accept that he's away make up it means there must be a way maybe you haven't seen it yet maybe he didn't look in the right direction maybe he was facing the wrong way but if you acknowledge that he is the waymaker then the question changes the lord show me the way we could reference by the branham he said i was a guide i was a tracker i was a guide and i thought i could find my way he said i feel on the tree and he wouldn't know and then i found himself in the same place the jet walk he ran to the end of his ability to guide himself oh help me somebody his experience was not enough he needed the guide to show him how to get back home is there anybody lost the night you're lost your way not and and it may not be you you know but it could be you standing in a gap for your house lord my family lost the way but you're prepared tonight to fight for them like many of those in the war who fighting for the family they put them in the subway in the train station they put them on the ground because bombs falling but you can't go wrong there too because you can't allow the enemy to reach down there where they're at they're already down there they're in a situation in a condition what are you going to do what level of resistance will you mount against the demonic influences trying to take out your house you have a choice people find themselves learning to make molotov cocktails you never made it before people don't go to school to study for these things doctors lawyers engineers simple people teachers different ones i'm fighting with my house i'm fighting for my family friends don't give up on your house don't give up on your family don't give up on your children don't give up on those who are backslid don't give up on them fight for them fight for them as for me and my house we we we we will serve the lord the promises unto you and your children your word coverage unto them that are far off even as many as the lord shall call all these scriptures you could hold on to because before we leave this place there'll be another reckoning there'll be another shaking can the church say man i'm trying to find a place to wrap up here find this paradigm between this unlikely hero called nehemiah this unlikely leader called nehemiah it takes a great quality to be a great wife to be a great husband to be a great son not because your son mean your great son not because your husband means your great husband not because your wife makes you a great wife not because you're a worker make you a great worker what makes a great worker what makes a great son a great father a great deacon a great minister great usher a great worshiper a great musician it takes something more than normal it takes something more than just existing it takes you figuring it out doing it challenging yourself to do more not being ordinary if zelinski relied only on his experience all he would have to offer his jokes because that's where he came from he was a comedian but god loves to put us in uncomfortable situations to bring new things out of us that we didn't know were there gideon almighty man of allah he did not even know gideon did not know what was in him and what was going to come out of him you see me my tribe is his smallest striker let me give him a resume my tribe is the smallest tribe my family is the smallest family any tribe and i'm the smallest one in my house you have to be looking for either my bigger brother or you're looking for another child another family but he didn't know what was locked up in him and it took god to reveal to him who he was in the economy of god do you understand who you are after all these years you still want to be moving like a chicken when you're eager they still want to eat from the pig pen when your father is there looking out for you you prodigal sons can you come back home and fight is this helping anybody tonight i'm almost done i just want to quickly go back to nehemiah 4 if you have it we read this before what is a reminder to us and i just found myself looking at it because there is a particular verse in here that i just i want to get to that is my burden right now and i encourage you if they could find back that message spiritual leadership one the bible study i did in may last year because i had the foundation of this and i don't have time to go into it now but nehemiah 4 is is when rebuilding started and back in nehemiah 2 is when stan balot and these fellas they they they are they were true in words at the time but here it was in nehemiah 4. it started to become more than words so nehemiah 4 verse 1. but it came to pass that when stan balot heard that we builded the wall in other words we're doing something about it because the issue was the wall was broken down the defenses was broken down nehemiah was bothered because jerusalem was always under attack and if there's no wall there's no defense there's no fortification you'll be wiped out friends if your home is not fortified if your life is unfortified do you understand that the invasion that's gonna right now in russia and ukraine is is really a shadow of a spiritual invasion taking place in homes right now in churches and people living life normal at realizing that demonic forces coming through the tv the internet tick-tock facebook all these things that infiltrate in your home your life saturating your mind your ideas your consciousness to distract you from your purpose where are your walls are you building walls to defend your house are you allowing everything to go in your house shame on you parents who are enablers of foolishness you are breaking on your own wall by not making your stand for what is right and what is truth but it came to pass that when somebody had heard that we builded a wall he was wrought don't you think the enemy would be angry when you take action against the possible invasion and took great ignition and mocked the jews and he spake before his brethren and the army of samaria and said what do these feeble jews will they fortify themselves will their sacrifice you hear the question i asked the beginning of the study what are you willing to sacrifice what do you want to die for will they make an end in a day will they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned no tobiah the ammonite was by him so this is sambal expressing himself to buy his next him and he said even that was their bill if a fox go up he shall even break down their stone wall so the buyers say what they do when it's so flimsy it's so weak if a dog walk on it if i walking it it will break down this was psychological warfare this was words meant to deter progress this is you trying to achieve and somebody say you're wasting your time don't try to sing you're wasting your time don't try to heal your marriage you're wasting your time don't try to reach out to your son you're wasting any time don't do that do that and talk talk talk talk first four hear oh oh god this is nehemiah starts to pray so here he here here so nehemiah doesn't send back words for what he has heard but over has been saying it the last bible said i did was dealing with conflict name i had a choice you gotta say all they're saying that i and it's an argument he didn't respond to them he didn't go word for word sit for tat with him he turned to god his default response to every situation was let me talk to god about it hear oh our god for we are despised he said lord you hearing what is in i'm not going to answer them you hearing you hear that so when i wanted somebody to talk to about the situation go talk to god lord you hear what you say about me you will get in far less trouble in life if you take it to the lord don't tell anybody else take it to the lord hear o our god for we are despised and turn their reproach upon their own head in other words whatever preaches it when they curse you and you bless them their curse fall back on them and your blessing come back on you he said turn their reproach upon their own head and give them for a prey in the land of captivity in other words make them vulnerable in the land of captivity and cover not their iniquity in other words expose them and let not their sin be blotted out from before thee for they have provoked thee to anger before the builders because nehemiah is saying this is your work it's your business it is god's desire church that you'll be fortified a whole chapter in the book of ephesians is dedicated to put on the whole armor of god which is about fortification it is god's desire that you have a defense it is god's desire that you are protected it is god's business his work that you be protected from every kind of attack for they are provoked the anger before the builders in other words in front of the builders who working hard this talk is coming to the to them and they're not deterring jesse bellas they are provoking god with their words so the sex so built we the wall in the face of criticism in the face of family members who say i cannot do it in the face of your co-workers who say you can't make it as a christian so built we the wall and all the wall was joined together until they have there for the people had a mind to work is your mind set to this work hallelujah in the amplified it says for the people that are hard to work do you have a heart to build this world to build this kingdom to protect our houses and our children from the demonic influences a mining to work a hotel this is a serious thing not a casual thing so what's happening in the in the any realm of the wars and naturally is just signed to us to defend ourselves spiritually a mind to the work a mind to inquire about your brother about your sister a mind to extend your prayer have you extended your prayers your natural response to what's taking place anybody with me tonight friends over there people can't sleep normally i want you to think about it it is not normal you don't know this word you don't know that life if you close your eyes you don't need to see him tomorrow because you don't know you need to be prepared it's war some of us sleeping on our children sleeping on our home sleeping and the devil running circles around us verse seven but it came to pass that when san bala and tobiah and the arabians and the ammonites and the ash judaized heard that the walls of jerusalem were made up and that the breaches began to be stopped god help us are you stopping breaches are you stopping breaches the weak spots the open windows in your home that the enemy has been trying to slip in when they heard of the breaches began to be stopped that they were very wrought they were very angry and scot inspired all of them together to come and to fight against jerusalem and to hinder it this is same spirit is almost in parallel to these scriptures that barobra is reading on sunday that will lead to the great war when the world comes against israel they will all conspire to come against israel the people of god verse nine nevertheless we made our prayer unto our god you see again leading with prayer you see why prem you think that's so important nevertheless in other words in the face of the knowledge that the enemy was conspiring and uniting against us our default initial response nevertheless we made our prayer unto our god and set a watch against them day and night because of them in other words we're not sitting and let it happen to us we're doing something about it we're setting a watch against them day and night because of them and judah said the strength of the bearers of burdens is decade and there is so much rubbish so that we are not able to build a wall and our adversaries said they shall not know neither see till we come in the midst among them and slay them and cause the work to cease stood so judah is saying is a lot of work and the enemy is watching they shall not know neither see what's going on until we come and it came to pass that when the jews which dwelt by them came they said unto us ten times from all places when you shall return unto us they will be upon you in other words the voices around them despite the fact that they prayed the voices still saying only in trouble i want you to catch this at no point in time is it going to be easy friends a service a prayer meeting is one of the few places you will ever find where the world comes to you to tell you you can make it you know outside of this anointing this atmosphere these times these few minutes we spend together on a sunday on a tuesday on a wednesday on a friday is your hope line coming to you saying you can make it you know outside of that voices of even people who you think are your friends are designed to take your eyes off the prize verse 13 we're almost done therefore in other words what we're seeing here is nehemiah taking action every time there's a situation to respond to he's not sitting on doing nothing hoping it works out that is what i want us to get to the internet going on what can we do this didn't work out what can we do they're coming what can we do we're not sitting down and just let the enemy run over us there must be something we can do could be doing planning to do verse 13 therefore he therefore means as a result of what transpired before this is what i'm going to therefore set i in the lower places behind the wall and on the higher places i even set the people after their families with their swords their spares and their bows and i looked and rose up and said unto the nobles and to the rulers and to the rest of the people be not ye afraid of them remember the lord i want us to appreciate this because the fact that he has a serious means that he is seeing some fear inching into the camp there would be no need to say this if fear was nothing to touch the ends of the clothes and people start to get concerned they say they're going to come and get us you know you're sure we could hold your place you're sure we can hold the fought you're sure that our defenses will hold your shore these weapons what weapons are coming with be not you're afraid of them remember the lord which is great and terrible and this is it here now this is the verse and fight for your brethren your sons and your daughters your wives and your houses i want us to catch this because nowhere in this scripture even say fight for yourself when that eight year old man in ukraine fight with my grandchildren that resonated you're able to always say it inspire him because there's something about the selflessness of a bigger purpose the selflessness of a higher cause the selflessness of a legacy beyond you listen to how nehemiah rallies the children of israel he said be not ye afraid of them remember the lord which is great and terrible and fight for your brethren don't you have bridging in here that need support your sons don't you have sons that need support your daughters your wives and your houses verse 15 i'm almost done and it came to pass when our enemies heard that it was known unto us and god had brought their counsel to naught that we returned all of us to the wall everyone under his work in other words when the enemy heard that they were not discouraged in their desire to finish the wall they went back to work and it came to pass from that time thought that behalf of my servants wrought in the work and the other half of them held both their spears the shields and the bows and the habitants and the rulers were behind all the house of judah in other words half working half defending because they in war times it's not a time of peace you better say the time of peace and it's a time of war this is the only type of peace we're in time of war war is raging on the earth friends we are not in a time of peace this is a time of war and you're in a war whether you sign up for it or not in the ukraine they told them if you're between the ages of 18 and 60 you cannot leave your wives your children they can cross the border but if you're between that age your siblings be fighting they didn't sign him for it but he in a war our war may not be physical friends but we are in a war make no mistake about it for we wrestled against flesh and blood but principalities and powers and spiritual wickedness in high places trying to distract you from receiving the baptism of the holy ghost but tonight we serve notice to every principality every power every demon every sickness every condition every doubt fear unbelief whatever it is we take it under our control in the name of the lord jesus christ under our control tonight so you can be free free to worship free to make demands of god requests of god he said prove me try me and see if i will not bless you we're almost done we're 17. they were building on the wall and they didn't bear burdens with those that lead everyone with one of his hands wrought in the work and the other hand held a weapon wartime for the builders everyone had his sword girded by his side and so build it the billion but they armed and he that sounded a trumpet was by me and i said unto the nobles and to the rulers and to the rest of the people the work is great and large and we are separated upon the wall one far from another in what place therefore you hear the sound of the trumpet resort he did unto us our god child fight for us so we labored in the work and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared likewise at the same time said i unto the people let everyone with his servant lord within jerusalem that in the night they may be a god to us and labor on in the day so neither i nor my brethren nor my servants nor the men of the god which followed me none of us put off our clothes saving that everyone put them off for washing in other words we wasn't resting he wasn't relaxing he wasn't taking it easy because we in war times friend eyes challenge you brother challenge you sister to follow up on the broadway tremendous message last sunday and what's happening before us don't take this moment lightly friends there's a spiritual move that's happening at the same time there's a ceiling that's taking place right now the ceiling time is on get your heart right with god and make sure that you fight for your house fight for your family let us pray oh gracious heavenly father we thank you tonight lord for your grace for your love for your mercy for these few broken up words lord to encourage your people conflict crisis and leadership how you are raising up spiritual leaders under your divine leadership of your holy spirit you promised to not leave us comfortless you promised to send lord the spirit of truth father oh god yes promise to send a comforter lord even a spirit that you that guide us in the all truth that we could leave here lord but before we leave this place lord certain things must be in place help us father if there are backsliders in our midst tonight if there are people who are not sure where they're standing lord may you stir our hearts into preparation not just preparation father but preparation with the consciousness of war we in war times there's a war raging lord and this war is part of the unfolding of all other wars that will lead to this lord great coming of this world coming to an end he said heaven and earth will pass away but your word will never pass away all of this foretold nation shall rise against nation all prophesied it's not a surprise to us lord but the time has come for us not to dwell on what's happening lord but for us to dwell on getting our lives right with god to apply the token upon our homes upon our families because the dead angel is passing so father may you bless your people may you stir our hearts into one like preparation lord because we've got to leave this place lord we pray our special blessing on our pastor our lord and the ministers elders deacons ushers trustees helps governments your believers
