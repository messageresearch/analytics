[14:03] actual knowledge of the word of God he
[14:04] calls man to invent the printing press
[14:07] and that printing press got your word
[14:09] into print and then you had Wesley and
[14:12] others that was Distributing the Bible
[14:14] and when you're ready to get it on tape
[14:17] you had the days of the voice you had
[14:19] man to invent Lord tape recorder are we
[14:23] able to catch a prophet last Aid message

[15:12] perimeters tonight take me out of the
[15:14] way and lay the writing will be spoken
[15:16] tonight the writing is set tonight the
[15:18] writing the utter tonight that the
[15:20] people may be helped delivered
[15:22] encouraged strengthened in this rough
[15:24] and tough hour we live in granted Lord
[15:26] in Jesus we ask it amen
[15:29] God bless you and welcome tonight it's
[15:32] great to have each everyone of you here
[15:34] tonight
[15:35] second forward to seeing you in service
[15:38] on Sunday I trust them that the service
[15:40] on Sunday will have blessed your heart
[15:42] that's that same Holy Spirit and that
[15:44] spirit is what God
[15:46] has used over the years and ages to get
[15:51] to his elect to guide his people
[15:52] together never once you've never put
[15:55] whatever God's eye won't allow things to
[15:57] happen and he owes other people that
[16:00] believe him
[16:01] and there's a scripture for that using
[16:03] my sheep hear my voice a stranger they
[16:06] will not follow there's something about
[16:07] a genuine Saint a genuine son a genuine
[16:11] daughter of God a heartened and they
[16:13] cleave too what's the voice it's not
[16:16] that you wouldn't go through a rough
[16:17] time enough touches but you really trust
[16:19] that his mood is true the devil
[16:22] a con man do not conjure up in his life
[16:24] they tricking people into losing trust
[16:27] and losing confidence
[16:29] and find themselves on their own little
[16:32] private interpretation Island
[16:34] where they think they know it where they
[16:36] think they have the answers or anything
[16:38] during the war and it's a false glare a
[16:41] false thing all together so tonight if
[16:43] your bibles are like return to two
[16:46] portion of script you want to read some
[16:47] James chapter five
[16:49] seven of those seven to twenty and we
[16:51] also want to read from Hebrews 10
[16:54] verse 35 to 39 again I want to thank you
[16:58] all for being here tonight
[17:00] James Frank
[17:03] and
[17:05] verse 7 it says be patient before
[17:08] brethren
[17:09] unto the coming of the Lord
[17:11] behold and and here here is being an
[17:16] appoint reference
[17:18] um of of a contrast behold the husband
[17:22] man waiting for the precious fruit of
[17:25] the Earth
[17:26] and had long patience for it
[17:29] until he received the Indian Lottery
[17:33] we also patient
[17:35] establish your hearts for the coming of
[17:38] the Lord joined life
[17:40] and then in speaking about these
[17:43] patients
[17:44] it speaks now of how you're going to
[17:48] deal with one another are we going to
[17:50] treat one another
[17:51] Grudge not one against another Brethren
[17:55] Lucy become dumb so now this
[17:59] is speaking to Christians
[18:01] speaking to believers
[18:03] not a grudge against one another
[18:06] Brethren at least be condemned before
[18:07] the judge family before the door take my
[18:10] vision the prophets
[18:12] who have spoken in the name of the Lord
[18:14] for an example of suffering affliction
[18:18] and of patience and that's the word
[18:20] we're going to hit tonight patience
[18:22] behold become them happy we can view you
[18:26] have heard of the patience of Job and
[18:29] seeing the end of the Lord and the Lord
[18:31] is very pitiful out of tender Mercy but
[18:34] Above All Things my brethren
[18:36] swear not
[18:42] foreign you're maybe me at least he fall
[18:45] in the condemnation
[18:47] is any among you Afflicted let him pray
[18:49] is any merry you can sing songs is there
[18:53] anything among you let him call for the
[18:55] Elders of the church let them pray over
[18:57] him anointing him with the oil
[18:59] the enemy of the Lord and the prayer of
[19:01] faith
[19:02] shall see the sick and the Lord shall
[19:04] raise them up and if you have any
[19:06] committed sins they shall be forgiven
[19:09] through 16. confess your faults one to
[19:12] another
[19:14] that he may be healed
[19:17] the effectual proven prayer or righteous
[19:20] man I feel that much
[19:22] Alliance was a man lighting and
[19:24] delighted that subject to light passion
[19:26] as we are if we honestly that it might
[19:28] not rain and the rain not only Earth by
[19:30] this place of three years and six months
[19:32] and he prayed again
[19:34] and the Heaven givering and the airport
[19:36] food of fruit brethren
[19:39] if any of you do Earl from the truth and
[19:42] one convert him let him know that he
[19:45] which converted The Sinner from error of
[19:47] his ways shall receive a soul from Death
[19:50] he shall hide
[19:51] a multitude of sense so this was a
[19:55] scripture you read covers you know the
[19:57] realm of how you treat how your handle
[20:00] issues and challenges and comparing and
[20:03] have Elias as an example
[20:06] Amanda prayed earnesty and what happened
[20:08] and he prayed again and what happened so
[20:10] we have to do like the example set
[20:12] before sibus 10
[20:14] and this is a text that I want to
[20:16] extract tonight Hebrews 10 verse 35 to 9
[20:19] reads cast not only therefore your
[20:21] confidence
[20:23] which had great recompense of reward
[20:26] for you have need of patience after
[20:30] you have done the will of God
[20:32] you might receive the promise for yet a
[20:37] little while and he'd have cometh will
[20:38] come I will not carry
[20:40] now the judge shall live by faith and if
[20:43] any man draw back my soul shall have no
[20:47] pleasure in him
[20:48] but we are not of them who draw back
[20:50] onto perdition
[20:52] but of them that believe the deceiving
[20:56] of the soul may God bless his word so
[20:59] good night
[21:00] and we are really grateful to have you
[21:02] all here tonight
[21:04] the Amplified of that scripture says do
[21:06] not fling away your Fearless confidence
[21:09] for it carries a great and glorious
[21:12] compensation of reward
[21:14] you have need of steadfast patience and
[21:17] endurance
[21:18] so that you may perform
[21:20] and fully accomplish the will of God and
[21:24] thus receive and carry away and enjoy
[21:27] the full of what is promised
[21:30] boosted theaters under Joshua lit by
[21:33] feet
[21:34] my righteous favor shall live by his
[21:37] conviction respecting man's relationship
[21:39] to God
[21:40] and divine things and holy father born
[21:43] of faith and conjoined with it
[21:46] and if he joins back and drinks and fear
[21:48] my soul
[21:49] has no Delight or pleasure in him
[21:52] but our way Glory is not that of those
[21:56] who draw back to Eternal misery
[21:59] peridition and utterly destroyed but we
[22:02] are those who believe who believe to
[22:06] and trust him and rely on God to Jesus
[22:11] Christ the Messiah
[22:12] and Faith preserve the soul
[22:17] so could you imagine people have come
[22:20] forward to receive Christ to believe God
[22:23] to receive the end time message
[22:26] and they find themselves drawing back
[22:28] and God said I have no pleasure
[22:31] my soul has not enlightened them
[22:34] and the title of what I want to share
[22:36] tonight is cast not obey your confidence
[22:40] you have need of patience
[22:43] don't Cast Away your confidence
[22:44] confidence
[22:46] and this is what they have the feeling
[22:48] of belief
[22:50] that one can have faith in
[22:53] or rely on someone
[22:55] something that's the confidence
[22:58] the feeling of belief that one can have
[23:00] faith in
[23:02] and rely on someone
[23:04] or something
[23:06] you know people make excuses lots of
[23:09] excuses ton of excuses
[23:11] you make excuses because they don't want
[23:13] to deal with themselves they blame
[23:15] others
[23:16] it always amazes me
[23:19] how people get angry at others what
[23:22] others do what others see how others
[23:24] outcome live
[23:26] and they don't seem to get angry with
[23:28] themselves
[23:29] they don't want to look in the mirror of
[23:31] the word to see their own actions
[23:33] attitudes
[23:34] and own behavior
[23:37] and it is easy to find flaws and find
[23:40] faults in others
[23:42] and it's almost as if by finding forms
[23:44] and flows with others it justifies your
[23:47] position
[23:49] but in God's eyes it is not like that
[23:51] and God I all have sinned and comes out
[23:54] of the glory
[23:55] so you're trying to gauge your brother's
[23:57] eyes out or sister's eyes out doesn't
[24:00] justify that you are right and you
[24:02] things are fine it is not so now as we
[24:07] go deeper
[24:09] there are some people who have a portion
[24:11] of this virtual knowledge wisdom
[24:13] pictures and so forth that don't even
[24:15] profess to be Christians
[24:17] so this was not people practicing the
[24:19] god-given nature of these things because
[24:21] we have
[24:22] god-given nature of patience and
[24:24] god-given nature of knowledge you have
[24:26] people that are Hindus Muslim Buddha it
[24:29] doesn't matter unbelievers have
[24:30] qualities fine qualities that not not
[24:33] even Christians and they are what you
[24:36] call nice people
[24:37] but this here is not what we are talking
[24:40] about
[24:41] and in this context we know the
[24:43] scriptures that computer one I'm giving
[24:45] all intelligence out to your feet with
[24:47] human knowledge and Temperance and
[24:49] patience and godliness and body kindness
[24:50] if we examine it it have no way it's
[24:53] this time still it has no way it stays
[24:56] see where you are why is it that there
[24:59] are people who seem to have been stunted
[25:01] grounded and they seem to be in the same
[25:04] spot marking time when God call us to
[25:07] reach the art
[25:09] God is in this thing of growth
[25:13] uh achievement
[25:16] Target
[25:17] goals going further come up here going
[25:21] higher
[25:22] God is Not static
[25:24] he's not one track
[25:26] what I love about him how he never have
[25:29] one animal or plant and one of his own
[25:32] to have this book
[25:34] they are different type of lions
[25:35] different type of bees different type of
[25:37] birds different type of trees different
[25:39] type of herbs there's all different it's
[25:42] almost as if every one just like our
[25:45] bodies the past our bodies have such an
[25:46] effective part to play that no one could
[25:48] boost better than the other
[25:51] you come like the nose feeling led to be
[25:53] by himself because he just want to swell
[25:55] alone or emote just want to talk he
[25:56] wanted he has to hear nothing that makes
[25:58] no sense
[25:59] the whole body
[26:01] 50 joined together is what makes up this
[26:03] glorious body
[26:05] and until we come to this spot where we
[26:07] could realize that each person each
[26:09] believer each member each seed of God
[26:12] after come to its own future then we
[26:15] have some serious challenges in our
[26:16] hands
[26:17] there are some people by their own
[26:19] experience they like to just deal with
[26:20] three or four or five people and that's
[26:22] the end of their world maybe their own
[26:24] family is the end of their world
[26:26] they others they may not grow up like
[26:29] that God never see it like that God will
[26:32] keep reaching out to the lost to the
[26:35] lonely to those that are struggling the
[26:37] spirit of God they forget will keep
[26:40] because that's what we caught US it's
[26:42] not because we were fine we were in
[26:45] trouble and his spirit is what we
[26:48] respond to that brood over us and
[26:50] brought us to this world message
[26:52] so what Obama was saying there are there
[26:54] are people who have a portion of this
[26:58] virtue and knowledge and wisdom and
[27:00] faith that don't even profess to be
[27:02] Christians there are some people have a
[27:04] portion of this that don't even pretend
[27:06] to be a Christian but that won't do
[27:10] okay he said that won't do that won't do
[27:14] it it's like a black bird trying to put
[27:16] peacock feathers in his wings to make
[27:18] him a peacock he only disgraces himself
[27:21] be better to stay a black person see
[27:23] when he tries to exercise these things
[27:26] without being a Christian he is simply
[27:29] all out of place
[27:31] so God himself has given us these
[27:35] promises right
[27:36] we are on deserving and he promised us
[27:39] to be this that is bright he promised us
[27:43] to be this last day super church he
[27:45] promised us all these different things
[27:47] don't Cast Away
[27:51] confidence
[27:52] of what God has already done for you
[27:56] when I look back at my own life
[27:58] I keep seeing things that God has done
[28:01] it's not will do now
[28:03] it is what he has done it is what God
[28:06] has done has brought me to where I am
[28:09] now it's not what I have done in myself
[28:12] is what God has done and I show all of
[28:14] you here tonight could look back in your
[28:16] life and see what God has done what God
[28:19] has done for you how God has taken you
[28:21] through two different issues and
[28:23] challenges and trials and you are still
[28:25] here
[28:26] so I want to challenge you and encourage
[28:28] you tonight stop don't doubt now
[28:31] you have come this far
[28:34] who brought you this far
[28:36] who brought you into this wood who
[28:38] really brought into this message you
[28:40] meet people who are arrogant you meet
[28:41] people who are puffed up you meet people
[28:43] who are indifferent you make people who
[28:44] are you really wonder if they're even
[28:46] saved
[28:47] because their behavior does not align to
[28:49] the Christian principles that have been
[28:51] released to us
[28:53] we are not Baptist we're not left to
[28:55] this we're not Pentecostals these are
[28:57] what the Bible called Blasphemous means
[28:59] we are called to be named after Christ
[29:02] to be like Jesus okay so therefore God
[29:07] himself is who brought you to himself
[29:09] you didn't choose this message in that
[29:11] sense the message chose you
[29:13] so you already on the called side you
[29:17] are part of those who have been called
[29:19] out
[29:20] now redemptions is in two parts being
[29:23] called out and go into what God wants
[29:26] you is to go into going to that secret
[29:28] place okay so tonight we want to kind of
[29:31] take a peek a best word called patience
[29:35] you don't have temperance
[29:38] and patience
[29:40] and courtiness and bodily kindness and
[29:44] if we drill down deeper into each one of
[29:45] these virtues each one of these virtues
[29:48] have their particular place in dealing
[29:51] with particular challenges
[29:53] and patience itself have its place and
[29:56] it's in it's in this is it is very um
[30:00] interesting or the Bible said you have
[30:02] need of patience one two after you have
[30:06] done the will of God
[30:11] and in that message he says when you do
[30:14] what God tells you to do
[30:17] doesn't respond
[30:18] it doesn't react that's the very hour to
[30:22] be certain of God
[30:24] because you see that lull that's peace
[30:27] is where the enemy comes and butter your
[30:30] mind and thoughts come and that is why
[30:32] we say like patience like a triple
[30:34] virtue when brother was told to speak
[30:37] for these girls I want one deer
[30:39] I want one dear the first one appeared
[30:42] right to me I want one deer second one
[30:44] to get a little longer the third one
[30:47] um he spoke and times had to thickening
[30:50] 15 minutes 20 minutes take half an hour
[30:52] whatever and he said hello for the two
[30:54] because I thought you said another one
[30:58] he was teaching him something or the
[31:00] Bible didn't say how long the monkey
[31:03] will move it says if you shall stay to
[31:05] this mountain
[31:06] be moved and don't doubt in your heart
[31:10] you can have what you see now remember
[31:13] our father your father when he spoke in
[31:16] the beginning and let there be light he
[31:17] could have taken a thousand years to
[31:19] Thousand Years ten thousand years but
[31:21] eventually and there was light
[31:24] so God himself has patience to weed
[31:28] until his word materializes and in the
[31:32] scripture he read he talked about the
[31:33] husband man nobody fling out the corn
[31:35] seed and then expect tomorrow morning to
[31:37] pick on
[31:39] the the farmer or the husband man they
[31:42] put out the corn seed and they have to
[31:43] wait
[31:45] they have to wait for the rain
[31:47] that's that's the part that they don't
[31:49] control
[31:50] their job and our job is to put in the
[31:53] seed
[31:54] that's your job
[31:55] and then the rain comes and do his work
[31:58] he begins to grow on people and then
[32:00] time
[32:02] unfolds the life of the pumpkin the
[32:05] watermelon the corn the peas whatever
[32:08] you put into the soil time itself
[32:11] unfolds that because God put a law of
[32:14] life with implant life within life
[32:17] itself the law of life to reproduce
[32:19] itself
[32:20] so when time comes the rains come oh
[32:24] that husband might have patience he
[32:25] waited for the Harvest of the whole
[32:27] Earth
[32:28] and we know we are living in the end
[32:30] time
[32:32] and I said something my son yesterday of
[32:35] a card you're working on and they said
[32:37] there will be no need of a steering
[32:39] wheel they don't even need a pedal and
[32:42] the car sheep exceed is very interested
[32:45] that they have to wait
[32:47] for technology to pick up to connect
[32:51] with the prophecy the prophecy said
[32:54] 1933 by Vision that they were with
[32:57] science will get so powerful that they
[33:00] will develop a car that has no steering
[33:02] wheel that the people was playing
[33:04] checkers or whatever in the car and he
[33:07] was taking it to their destination
[33:09] well they are almost there we are right
[33:12] on the verge of it we are right to see
[33:15] what was seen my vision since 1933 seat
[33:19] unfold right before our eyes but that
[33:22] was not the only Vision that came
[33:25] is the vision of a bride of Jesus Christ
[33:26] there's a vision of a super Church
[33:28] there's a vision about Jewish Soul
[33:30] Jewels Mighty Army there's a vision of a
[33:32] glorious Church Without Puerto Rico all
[33:34] these are Vision even John himself saw a
[33:37] vision and the vision that he saw has to
[33:40] come into a reality if we can truly
[33:43] believe what the Bible said or what the
[33:46] scripture says because that is what it
[33:48] is all about do you believe the word and
[33:50] when we see wood you know uh people get
[33:53] fight and they get this fight and they
[33:54] can fight for this church and it's
[33:55] preaching this past and this telling
[33:57] them is thinking again fight
[33:58] they again fight with themselves
[34:00] they're not one they want to fight and
[34:02] wrestle with the word because then you
[34:04] find the supposed fighting you're
[34:05] supposed to wrestle with the angel not
[34:06] with me
[34:07] I am notified I'm not hindering you from
[34:09] the Rapture or if I'm getting blessed
[34:11] and what nothing no no
[34:13] what you have to wrestle with is the
[34:14] angel you have to get to the angel to
[34:16] meet the angels with the angel to get a
[34:18] change but hear what I want to get to
[34:20] know James won
[34:21] let's turn our Bible to James chapter
[34:23] one and this is so very important James
[34:25] a servant of God
[34:28] of the Lord Jesus Christ to the 12
[34:29] tribes which are scattered abroad
[34:31] greetings
[34:32] so this is like a word from the Lord
[34:35] Jupiter James but James speaking does
[34:37] tonight my brethren come with all joy
[34:40] when you fall into diverse Temptations
[34:42] he's not talking to sinners
[34:45] he's not talking to unbelievers
[34:48] he's not talking to people who don't
[34:49] want to save God
[34:50] he's talking to Believers people are
[34:52] already in there
[34:53] who know Christ and he's talking to
[34:56] graduate Brendan counted all joy when
[34:59] you fall into the diverse Temptations
[35:00] knowing this
[35:02] that the train of your feet
[35:05] Wicked patients
[35:07] so it is cleaner
[35:10] Faith come by hearing hearing by the
[35:12] good of good
[35:13] you cannot see you have no feet
[35:16] if you say you have no feet you could
[35:17] get feet
[35:18] if you say you have no feet you could
[35:20] get dear because the Bible say your feet
[35:23] come feed comes by hearing
[35:26] come if you don't listen to the word if
[35:30] you don't hear the word
[35:32] you have a rough time getting to this
[35:33] feat we are talking about because faith
[35:36] comes by hearing hearing by the word of
[35:38] God feet also come by experience you go
[35:41] to an experience it gives you a greater
[35:43] trust and confidence in God and it grows
[35:45] your feet so that means faith can grow
[35:48] faith in itself doesn't remain static
[35:52] feet can grow feet can ripen feet can
[35:57] mature how is your feet tonight
[35:59] so let me read verse 3 again knowing
[36:01] this that the shrine of your faith with
[36:03] patience
[36:04] but let patients have a perfect work
[36:07] that you may be perfect
[36:10] an entire
[36:11] wanted nothing
[36:13] I may know the prophets that patience is
[36:16] perfection it is written on God
[36:19] unwitten for God and this is the process
[36:23] of character development
[36:25] nor we know as parents we may have
[36:28] struggles or family may be poor and we
[36:30] suffered under someone and we struggle
[36:31] and everything else right and we tell
[36:34] ourselves when we have our own families
[36:36] when we have on our own children we
[36:38] don't want them to be like that
[36:40] so when we get our children and we come
[36:43] into our own we find ourselves blocking
[36:46] covering pampering and making cushions
[36:49] and pillows and feathers and fluffy
[36:52] stuff for our own kids and and to see
[36:55] them sometimes to raise up as a Rascals
[36:57] because they just have it too easy
[37:00] God don't ever treat his children like
[37:04] that
[37:04] they say every son
[37:06] somebody every
[37:09] son that cometh to God must be
[37:14] so when you see somebody trial proof for
[37:15] no trials I'm testing on the skin and
[37:17] teeth and everything else right true you
[37:19] know something wrong with that dude
[37:21] every son cometh to God must be trying
[37:26] so God has no spoil children
[37:28] let's continue let patience of a perfect
[37:31] world that you may be perfect an entire
[37:34] wanted nothing if any of you lack wisdom
[37:37] let him ask of God that give it to all
[37:40] men liberally and upgrade it not and it
[37:43] shall be given to him so watch your luck
[37:45] he asks for
[37:47] but how do you ask those six Expressions
[37:50] done but let him ask in fit not even
[37:54] like a wave of the sea you travel with
[37:57] the Wind on Earth let not that man think
[37:59] he shall receive anything of the Lord
[38:02] double-minded man is unstable in all his
[38:05] ways
[38:06] so I just want to take a peek at that in
[38:09] the Amplified from those three be
[38:11] assured and understand that the trial
[38:14] and proving of your feet bring out
[38:17] endurance and steadfastness
[38:20] many people see they believe but do they
[38:22] really believe
[38:24] and you know as I you hear me say it
[38:27] before
[38:28] that you talk about unbeliever make
[38:30] believe and True Believer on all three
[38:32] are in the church
[38:33] I always wonder about the first one the
[38:35] unbelievable part How could somebody be
[38:37] a unbelievable
[38:38] but it is true
[38:40] these unbelievers claim to believe but
[38:43] they don't really believe
[38:44] because they are not connected with they
[38:47] come like a false people Falls here
[38:48] whatever it is it's not connected to the
[38:50] real head or Tito mouth or Draw it's
[38:52] just something else too
[38:54] and they Pro have a profession
[38:57] because a real seed is proven
[39:02] so it's not somebody claim I believe I'm
[39:04] a Believer yes but the only way
[39:07] you could get proof of that faith is
[39:09] when test and trial comes under it and
[39:12] then your feet is proven when it stands
[39:14] out
[39:14] so what understand that the trial and
[39:17] the pruning of your feet brings out
[39:19] endurance
[39:21] and steadfastness and patience but let
[39:26] endurance and steadfastness and patients
[39:28] have full play and do a thorough work
[39:31] it's not you may be
[39:33] perfectly and fully developed with no
[39:37] defects lacking
[39:40] I'm going to close off adapter
[39:42] okay so this is the object of patience
[39:45] that God speak to Abraham
[39:48] and God put 25 years on the promise that
[39:51] he spoke to Abraham and Abram had to
[39:53] wait
[39:54] you have to wait after 10 years you have
[39:56] to wait 15 years he still written 20
[39:59] years he still with the Yap of wheat
[40:01] until God came and the Bible uses words
[40:05] until Abraham came into the fullness of
[40:08] believing so you could see Abram could
[40:10] have had a level of subconscious
[40:11] unbelief the heart was to be big thought
[40:14] worked out
[40:16] etched out but the Bible in testifying
[40:19] of his faith says he started not at the
[40:21] promise of God to unbelief but was wrong
[40:23] given faith and praise and glory to God
[40:27] in other words fate genuine feet Praises
[40:31] God because feet is already the
[40:33] substance of what is promised you
[40:37] already have the thing before you get
[40:38] the real thing you have something that
[40:40] God put in your spirit in your soul so
[40:43] you'll hear me saying something that I
[40:44] will never allow any man any human being
[40:47] to stop between me and what God put in
[40:50] feet in my soul to believe what he
[40:52] promised
[40:54] so you know there's some people who have
[40:55] taught your dream canceling a vision if
[40:58] they could and null your feet if they
[41:01] could do like it doesn't exist if they
[41:03] could
[41:04] but you see when God perfect in your
[41:06] soul it's not man but that dear it's God
[41:07] put that here God put feet in your soul
[41:10] to believe him regardless
[41:11] so it doesn't matter if the church falls
[41:14] down if the pastor is removed if if the
[41:18] whole spit up into 16 parts that feeds
[41:21] citizens father you because you are son
[41:23] and God put that seed inside of you
[41:25] before the foundation of the world to
[41:27] receive this end time with a message to
[41:29] make you an elect of this last day
[41:32] I had just grateful to God for where we
[41:35] are in Trinidad where we are in Christ
[41:38] where we are in God's plan and program
[41:40] we are part of God's plan and program he
[41:43] said out of many Nation towns and people
[41:45] you have equal other people so we are
[41:47] privileged to be part of this call on
[41:49] bunch
[41:50] okay
[41:52] all right let's continue
[41:54] praise the Lord
[41:57] so this this is a little different
[41:59] tonight I know it's not Bible Study
[42:00] Bible study but we want to share this
[42:02] tonight with you and trusting that you
[42:04] get some strength and and effectively
[42:07] so I want to kind of drop back a bit
[42:09] he's talking about Temperance right
[42:12] and in sharing this part because we want
[42:14] to go from some principation especially
[42:15] here something he shared on patients but
[42:17] we want to just take our time and get
[42:19] from temperance and you would see how
[42:23] detailed this is it's not a game it's
[42:27] not like um you know like just saying
[42:30] words that are Temperance you say oh my
[42:32] we have come to Temperance no you have
[42:35] faith first you have to have to begin
[42:37] with then you add virtue to your feet if
[42:41] it's the right kind of virtue notice
[42:43] words then you add knowledge if is the
[42:47] right kind of knowledge now you're gonna
[42:49] add Temperance now Temperance doesn't
[42:51] mean stop drinking alcohol here either
[42:54] no Temperance doesn't mean alcoholic
[42:56] cure not in this case this is Bible
[42:59] Temperance Holy Spirit Temperance you
[43:02] see how God break it down not Temperance
[43:04] human temper this is Bible temporary
[43:07] this is Holy Spirit Temperance that's
[43:09] just one of the loss of the flesh or
[43:11] we're talking about Holy Spirit
[43:13] temperance
[43:14] that means here we go are you ready how
[43:18] to control your tongue
[43:22] Oh you mean the controller return is not
[43:26] automatic we don't have a remote you're
[43:27] not even multiple integration take it
[43:29] off no it's it's how
[43:33] to control your tongue not be a tackler

[43:40] not fly off every time anybody speaks
[43:44] growth to you later
[43:47] you mean people can speak close to you
[43:51] or speak close to me and then we have to
[43:55] react with this thing called Temperance
[43:57] and manage what's supposed to come out
[44:00] of us
[44:01] copyright he said oh my God a lot of us
[44:04] is going to fall off before we get
[44:06] started aren't we
[44:07] then we wonder why God is not in his
[44:10] church when Miracles and things that
[44:14] they used to do yes sir he is connected
[44:18] temperance
[44:20] these virtues with Miracles and things
[44:24] that God used to do you see a lot of us
[44:26] going to fall off before we get started
[44:27] hungry then we wonder why God is not in
[44:30] his church doing Miracles are the things
[44:32] that they used to yes sir are these
[44:35] things are Temperance did oh Temperance

[44:52] constant against sex I will stick my
[44:54] mind no no no no no no no

[45:20] kindness is that the way you want to be
[45:22] the conversion say Amen when you are
[45:25] riled upon while not back let him be
[45:30] your example there are some people you
[45:32] could hardly tell them something the
[45:33] thief and all you know the works
[45:35] you know they're angry
[45:37] because yeah
[45:42] you're mad you're hungry you're back you
[45:44] can fight about soul
[45:46] as you as your human Spirit are you
[45:49] afraid that's not Jesus okay
[45:52] see let him be your exam when they said
[45:55] if don't be the Son of God Too Many
[45:57] Stones The Bread he could have done it
[45:59] but surely was God but he had temperance
[46:03] when they call him he said I forgive you
[46:05] for it
[46:06] they put handfuls of they pulled
[46:09] handfuls of beard out of his face it
[46:11] splits in his face he said come down the
[46:14] cross he said father forgive them they
[46:17] don't even know what they're doing
[46:19] he had a gift he knew all things for him
[46:22] was the fullness of The Godly they had
[46:25] seen him perform Miracle by telling
[46:27] people what was wrong with them and so
[46:29] forth like that they put a rag around
[46:31] his head around his eyes hit him and
[46:33] said prophesy tell us who hate you we
[46:35] believe you see he had temperance now if
[46:39] you have got it like that
[46:41] add it to your feet so he's actually
[46:44] qualifying the vacuums to be added I
[46:47] don't think I've ever said that before I
[46:49] didn't have the first time I've come up
[46:52] he's actually
[46:53] qualifying the virtues to be added so it
[46:57] is not your imagination is not what you
[47:01] think is not what you feel is the
[47:04] virtues that is qualified oh my God no
[47:07] wonder he says a lived voice
[47:10] it's a qualified
[47:13] Thunder
[47:16] that's the problem that shake the devil
[47:18] it is something that actually has been
[47:21] lived out now being added Oh Glory my
[47:24] god father help me
[47:26] something has been lived out no bill
[47:29] added to you when it's like that you say
[47:31] add it to your feet
[47:33] if you got it like that add it to your
[47:35] faith if you if you still blow up and
[47:38] fast and Fast and stew and Carry On You
[47:41] Can't
[47:42] add that cause it won't add
[47:48] it won't vulcanize and these words are
[47:52] so important it is tremendous because
[47:55] now
[47:56] many years it would vulcanite he's
[47:59] actually bringing now a blending in
[48:02] to effectively add now you can vulcanize
[48:05] piece of wood and rubber it won't work
[48:09] so you have to have the right material
[48:11] written
[48:13] synchronized and vulcanized means it's
[48:16] so connected you can't break it
[48:18] so virtue the right claim who vulcanize
[48:21] the feet I'll be seen as a night
[48:24] knowledge vulcanized the virtue
[48:27] are you seeing it tonight
[48:29] so the right kind is what will vulcanize
[48:33] so each one
[48:35] has to be the right kind in order to
[48:38] vulcanize and this is what could make up
[48:41] this View
[48:44] that is going to go in the rapture
[48:46] that the being is a servant of God in
[48:49] the Church of God that is going in the
[48:51] Rapture or could we give him some
[48:53] Praises tonight we believe that tonight
[48:54] oh praise the Lord okay so let's get
[48:57] sent to you right
[48:58] he says now you can't add that it won't
[49:01] vulcanize you couldn't take a piece of
[49:03] rubber you know and vulcanize it to a
[49:06] piece of iron it just won't work it's
[49:09] got to be flexible just like the rubber
[49:10] is and when your feet
[49:13] here we go and your temperance become
[49:18] the same kind of Holy Ghost Temperance
[49:21] that he had
[49:23] then it will vulcanize with him
[49:26] you have annotated when your virtue is
[49:29] like his virtue then it'll be added to
[49:31] it when your knowledge is like his
[49:33] knowledge I come to you I will of God
[49:35] see with the father's word he defeated
[49:38] every devil
[49:39] heaven will pass away but the word will
[49:42] not see when you have that kind of
[49:44] knowledge it will recognize yourself so
[49:47] I'm seeing these things true
[49:49] it is not something right
[49:51] it is not something like this is not
[49:53] mysterious enough this is already not
[49:55] talking about death tonight well I don't
[49:57] know what that what if you're talking
[49:58] about because I'm talking about that
[49:59] that is too deep for me but I'm seeing
[50:02] that Behind These virtues it's not just
[50:05] numbers names and the two changes and
[50:08] you know like a point of reference it is
[50:11] actually something to be tested try
[50:13] approval and slaughtered into you that
[50:16] will be vulcanized with the rest
[50:18] and I want you to see the importance of
[50:20] you humanly into your own life to strive
[50:24] like we said how many will touch it I
[50:26] pledge I will pray daily until all these
[50:28] features be in this country of mind
[50:31] thank you and you have got the right
[50:33] temperance
[50:34] like he had it was vulcanized if you
[50:37] haven't just a man we man me have free
[50:40] script of belief or Temperance I would
[50:42] have shut them down but maybe I better
[50:44] not
[50:45] because they might put my name in the
[50:47] paper about it that ain't the kind of
[50:50] temperance he's talking about to try to
[50:53] add that it won't work but when you can
[50:55] really put the sweetness from your heart
[50:57] forgive every man call your peace let it
[51:00] be gone and then and vulcanize you can
[51:04] add that to your feed
[51:05] I remember talking to a brother and his
[51:08] family how he managers family and stuff
[51:10] there was some challenges there I told
[51:12] him I said listen you can't kill a
[51:14] cockroach hammer it makes no sense as he
[51:17] has to pick your fight you cannot be
[51:19] picky picky at every little issue
[51:21] every everything you're roaring like a
[51:24] lion
[51:25] I said what about when this serious
[51:26] issue come
[51:27] you're crying for Aunt you're crying
[51:30] after a flea a fly and you're making a
[51:33] racket over something else and you
[51:35] haven't seen anything greeted you
[51:36] haven't seen real challenges yet so I'd
[51:39] like to encouragement I say you have to
[51:41] learn to pick your fights you have to
[51:44] know is it worth it
[51:46] sometimes Believers some of the quarrels
[51:48] or some of the issues we find ourselves
[51:49] is it isn't wood walk
[51:53] to even respond
[51:55] even if you know you are right just walk
[51:58] you don't want to talk just walk all
[52:00] your peace steal your tongue that will
[52:03] be able to say Mark the perfect man he
[52:04] can Bridle his tongue
[52:07] watch a perfect man a man who not there
[52:10] at all without Perfection oh he could he
[52:13] could say a lot all right okay no wonder
[52:16] the church is so short
[52:18] isn't that right no wonder I say repent
[52:21] and be baptized the Bible said in the
[52:22] name of Jesus Christ and strict truth or
[52:25] Tyrion don't believe that
[52:26] okay now then after that fourthly you
[52:29] hear the part you want to get to but we
[52:31] know again
[52:32] after that fourthly you want to add
[52:34] patience to your faith now if you've got
[52:37] feet
[52:38] it will get patients the Bible said see
[52:41] so this is patience now that's the next
[52:45] thing is going to build this statue you
[52:47] know God has got real material in this
[52:52] building
[52:53] so now he is pleasing these virtues as
[52:56] material
[52:57] building blocks
[52:59] what you had
[53:01] it is actually a material
[53:03] you see how short we are bread Brothers
[53:05] he says you see where we are at
[53:07] yes sir see we have Glory we have
[53:10] short-term things because we got faith
[53:12] when we come down to these things here
[53:14] God can't build us into that statue
[53:20] so now watch this rain fell on the
[53:23] Pentecostal 1906. what did they produce
[53:27] their signs wonders tongues Miracles
[53:31] welcome and Supernatural manifestation
[53:33] and that was just a level of faith
[53:36] they couldn't add because they couldn't
[53:39] receive the word because the word comes
[53:41] to the prophet and they rejected the
[53:43] prophet so they stay stuck at that level
[53:46] of the Pentecostal experience fire power
[53:49] presence but not the life added
[53:53] because brother Branham brought the
[53:56] fullness of the word by the revealing of
[53:58] this phenomenon every mystery every seal
[54:01] he brought back and restored the person
[54:04] of Christ the person of Jesus Christ and
[54:07] this person is what you have to receive
[54:09] this person of Jesus Christ so then when
[54:12] he says no you see how short we are
[54:14] Brethren yes sir we have shouts and
[54:16] things because we got feed shroud and
[54:19] things because we are fed but when we
[54:21] come down to these things here
[54:23] God can build us into that subject what
[54:27] is he talking he's actually talking to
[54:30] build us into one
[54:31] Pentecostal will not adopt him they
[54:33] remain as beats in other words abduction
[54:36] age was released when God released that
[54:38] prophet he actually beaten the abduction
[54:40] age or Robert's the Legrand and a whole
[54:43] host about our great men they were all
[54:46] loosed on the fields but only one man
[54:47] was adopted which was William because he
[54:51] went through this whole story here of
[54:53] being tested he lost his wife he knows
[54:56] his daughter he said the Lord Give the
[54:58] Lord take it away before he said that
[55:00] the devil came speaking to him tell him
[55:01] look at you you're preaching the gospel
[55:03] you're serving the lord you're praying
[55:05] for the sick people and whatnot you say
[55:07] God wouldn't even answer your prayer
[55:08] look at your wife dying your baby
[55:10] daughter dying and he's listening he's
[55:12] listening he's listening now what he's
[55:14] two years resting there the humanistic
[55:16] realm air and the realm of the air fit
[55:19] that is listening he's listening there
[55:21] are bad things going on inside of him
[55:22] the Battle of will owns the Battle of
[55:24] hearing voices a voice saying look at
[55:27] you he you know you're gonna your
[55:29] daughter going to die your wife's going
[55:30] to die and something is hearing all of a
[55:33] sudden you know what when the feet feel
[55:35] inside of him when he out of his mouth
[55:37] come the Lord give the lord taketh as we
[55:40] to dig away bless the beginning of the
[55:42] Lord and in him expressing that you
[55:44] could see the fathers please my son you
[55:46] didn't write him he's got the mature you
[55:48] get them at your home because of what
[55:50] he's going through sometimes we ball
[55:52] like a cowards we would see in the look
[55:53] of expression we carry her on because
[55:55] we're going through stuff and you're
[55:57] going to stuff to mature you to get the
[55:58] foolishness out of us go trying to get
[56:00] you through your dullness is slugishness
[56:03] your laziness and your trials does that
[56:05] the custom does that and you come and
[56:08] get a word tonight you have need of
[56:09] patience don't Cast Away confidence wait
[56:12] be patient with God be patient with your
[56:15] wife be patient with your husband be
[56:16] patient with your child you want a child
[56:18] move up so fast you want your husband
[56:20] this way you want your wife that way be
[56:22] patient
[56:24] which man could add one cubic teeth
[56:26] tattoo by giving a thought
[56:28] if we could think ourselves to be fine
[56:31] to the Moon we fly to the moon is when
[56:33] we think that we do it we fight to the
[56:35] Moon we go we want to we go do we want
[56:37] to do
[56:38] we caught by our own thinking not where
[56:40] we think we want again we could think
[56:42] both I want to do that and positive
[56:43] thinking that kind of drama but the
[56:46] reality is this we have to have patience
[56:48] and patience means waiting on God and
[56:51] waiting for God not waiting for your
[56:53] uncle or your aunt or you're waiting for
[56:56] the church that you shall do it and then
[56:57] therefore like why how you are and then
[56:59] that way you're going through and the
[57:01] Brethren and whoever choose to have love
[57:02] and who do have love and what kind of
[57:04] thing and looking for love yeah I love
[57:06] your own self
[57:07] God love you and the main thing you have
[57:09] to know that's the main thing I
[57:11] understand but I brought you a lovers
[57:12] about you love me well love and well
[57:14] loved you're looking for love looking
[57:16] for love
[57:19] God love is expressed by him releasing
[57:22] his son his son forces
[57:26] I need each one of us receive that son
[57:29] the person of Jesus Christ you see there
[57:31] will be no forces there'll be no
[57:33] arguments we still believe different
[57:35] things but that love is not going to be
[57:37] emanate from us okay let's see how we
[57:40] could just hit the home shot here
[57:43] he can't okay let me read something
[57:45] about to get the context he says now we
[57:47] have Glory I've shown things because we
[57:50] got faith right but when we come down to
[57:52] these things here God can't build us
[57:54] into that statue see he cannot he cannot
[57:56] make us up to that kind of a place we
[58:00] got all these other things before
[58:03] and slide off with it
[58:06] church and there's some brother I can't
[58:09] remember which state he was from other
[58:11] Vision some years ago body pyramid and
[58:14] people were climbing up and you know the
[58:16] pyramid is brought at the bottom so you
[58:18] get a ton of people there and they climb
[58:20] up they get less and less and less and
[58:22] as The Godfather people will actually
[58:23] sign off
[58:25] sliding off the payment and it's
[58:27] symbolic of not really fully adding to
[58:30] go further because to add you adding
[58:33] virtue and virtue platform is to get
[58:35] into knowledge another platform it's
[58:38] taken to the temperance Temperance
[58:39] platform if they get to the big
[58:41] specialist but form is taken to the
[58:43] godliness godliness platforms that
[58:45] should be good with kindness where the
[58:46] kindness gets you to the presence of the
[58:47] king
[58:49] the object is to get into the presence
[58:51] of the king because that is where the
[58:53] Run of authority and power that's where
[58:55] the adoptionist act when you get to the
[58:57] top step the top of the step when you
[58:59] enter into the presence of the king like
[59:01] Esther
[59:02] what is this you want me to do for you
[59:04] I'll give you up to half my kingdom okay
[59:06] so what
[59:08] you think
[59:09] with this all things we got all these
[59:13] other things we fall and slide off with
[59:16] it we can't build his church it's
[59:19] powerful here these words the prophecy
[59:21] Park Village Church because he said Upon
[59:23] This Rock Faith Revelation Rock I will
[59:26] build my church so the Church of Jesus
[59:29] is not billions it's not Tabernacles and
[59:31] this Fellowship it's not that is
[59:34] Church's building is really based upon
[59:36] that rock Faith revolution of who he is
[59:39] so that fate was really The Anchor Point
[59:41] that other things supposed to go on top
[59:44] of it like virtue and knowledge and so
[59:45] on like that right you want to repeat it
[59:47] myself patience with what
[59:49] what kind of patience the first thing
[59:52] the first thing of the second or third
[59:55] the first thing is having patience with
[59:58] God
[59:59] and then he made a statement and I don't
[1:00:01] want you to figure this to me
[1:00:02] if it's one thing I don't want you to
[1:00:04] forget is this one if you have got
[1:00:08] real genuine feet you will have real
[1:00:12] genuine patience
[1:00:15] because
[1:00:16] faint Wicked patience
[1:00:20] so if I do like wiring like electrical
[1:00:22] wiring there's a wire connected from
[1:00:25] feet straight to patients
[1:00:28] so you cannot tell me you are fit and
[1:00:30] your poor patients so God I can't start
[1:00:32] with you we can do longer fed up a
[1:00:34] ticket moment no you can't talk like
[1:00:35] that all right if you are genuinely one
[1:00:39] you'll have genuine patience and you
[1:00:42] could see whether statement is booted
[1:00:44] from descriptions because faith will get
[1:00:47] patience and when God sees anything you
[1:00:50] believe it that's all you got patience
[1:00:52] well I asked him to heal me I asked him
[1:00:56] last night to heal me and I'm Justified
[1:00:58] sick this morning oh my what patience
[1:01:01] then he said what to eat around 25 years
[1:01:04] later there still wasn't even one sign
[1:01:07] it was still believing he was patient
[1:01:11] with God so some Minister brethren
[1:01:13] they find it too long now so you look
[1:01:16] like if you go there fulfill his promise
[1:01:18] and they started following stuff all of
[1:01:20] a sudden this seed adopted and because
[1:01:22] they see so
[1:01:23] that is Imagination that is not this is
[1:01:26] my beloved Son God has said that this
[1:01:28] tell them to themselves
[1:01:30] so okay
[1:01:31] put him all before you
[1:01:33] let him be the next cross and say
[1:01:36] you can't cross him so keep him before
[1:01:39] you he said so it's going to happen keep
[1:01:42] him before you that's right so you see
[1:01:44] how we come and we preach and say
[1:01:46] there's one of these fines they're gonna
[1:01:47] be wonderful stick will be here by and
[1:01:48] see we are seeing that because we are
[1:01:50] pumping
[1:01:52] we believe it that could happen someday
[1:01:54] that could happen today and otherwise
[1:01:56] right now the Holy Spirit could come and
[1:01:59] baptize you right in your home right in
[1:02:01] your house
[1:02:02] God could do something special for you
[1:02:03] on Wednesday 19th welcome something
[1:02:05] special for you in your home you have to
[1:02:07] be a team you could be praying all of a
[1:02:09] sudden God come and visit you send on
[1:02:11] your representation in the form of the
[1:02:13] baptism of the Holy Ghost Friday prayer
[1:02:15] go to come and visit you in your own you
[1:02:17] have to have expectations you have to
[1:02:19] create an atmosphere if there's no
[1:02:21] atmosphere of healing how are we going
[1:02:22] to expect healing whether it's to happen
[1:02:24] but I'm talking about is there a
[1:02:26] business in the church attitude of the
[1:02:28] church he said this Spirit can't even
[1:02:29] reveal so that means yes this is awful
[1:02:33] that means he could be speaking words
[1:02:35] but there's no Revelation coming to the
[1:02:37] people because the the atmosphere
[1:02:39] screwed up and the utmost one messed up
[1:02:42] the spirit of review so let's say for
[1:02:44] instance you are here tonight you are
[1:02:45] backstory right and you're trying
[1:02:47] yourself like thinking you're unworthy
[1:02:48] and whatnot and the cause of the
[1:02:51] atmosphere that is here tonight despair
[1:02:53] revealed to you that God mostly has
[1:02:56] extended to you right and God's grace
[1:02:58] coming to you and you're right in your
[1:03:00] home right in your own quickly in your
[1:03:02] own Corner you're getting inspiration
[1:03:04] Revelation it means the spirit is
[1:03:07] operational my words is not just my
[1:03:09] words is if if there's a words coming
[1:03:12] from the Lord I'm good and God's
[1:03:13] inspiring then the same God that speak
[1:03:16] they could reveal it because what we
[1:03:17] need is revelation it's not words the
[1:03:19] church is built on the church is built
[1:03:21] upon revelation we need revelation we
[1:03:23] need to ask what Revolution I don't know
[1:03:25] how much of you and how many people ask
[1:03:27] God God reveal yourself I remember I
[1:03:29] mentioned before say God I don't know
[1:03:31] who you are or 16 years old say Lord
[1:03:33] could you reveal yourself to me this
[1:03:34] year and he did 1975 is when I get
[1:03:36] baptized I asked God for to reveal
[1:03:40] himself to me because I don't know you
[1:03:41] and you have to begin to ask God to
[1:03:43] Revelation not see I go to church not
[1:03:47] see you know that I believe the message
[1:03:49] no you want divine revelation and
[1:03:50] Revelation is what tell me somebody
[1:03:52] relation is definitely i t h Revelation
[1:03:54] is fit so the more Revelation you get is
[1:03:57] the more faith you're supposed to have
[1:03:59] the more faith you're supposed to grow
[1:04:00] and as the more fatal foreign
[1:04:38] then there we go God tries your patience
[1:04:42] that's right God tries them so after you
[1:04:45] told no no I want you to go ahead and
[1:04:47] get in the app I'm going to run the
[1:04:49] animals in there I want you to get in
[1:04:51] time up upstairs so you can look out to
[1:04:53] the top window now when you get there I
[1:04:55] want you to tell the people tomorrow
[1:04:56] what I've been preaching for 120 years
[1:04:59] going to take place
[1:05:01] all right go down
[1:05:04] and you know what you know this story it
[1:05:06] didn't mean
[1:05:07] but notice of it first day second day to
[1:05:10] the Norwegian when we start to fall
[1:05:13] people now getting inspirational
[1:05:14] community
[1:05:18] don't let God shut the door you can't
[1:05:20] come and if God shall come down what for
[1:05:23] God open to me and construct and God has
[1:05:26] opened my door for you here tonight to
[1:05:27] attempt to get out your bathroom
[1:05:30] condition to get closer to God I don't

[1:05:35] you still as you are still where you are
[1:05:37] is come up okay let's continue now

[1:05:43] the church

[1:07:28] on the side of it and Noah telling us
[1:07:30] and be patient son are you sure it will
[1:07:33] rain his daughter-in-law said father you
[1:07:35] know he said it will rain but we have
[1:07:37] been here all these years waiting we
[1:07:40] have been preparing and you told us it's
[1:07:41] going to rain a week ago and we are
[1:07:43] still in here and the doors are all shut
[1:07:45] and we are here walking around in here
[1:07:47] and the Sun is squatting right down like
[1:07:49] this but he will dream how do you know
[1:07:53] keywords God said so
[1:07:55] now when you get that way at it or give
[1:07:59] the Lord a praise tonight oh give the
[1:08:01] Lord some Praises tonight when it gets
[1:08:03] that way where you can tell your friends
[1:08:06] your family your loved one contact your
[1:08:07] God Church
[1:08:09] you're not watching my guys you're not
[1:08:12] feet you're the whom your senses you
[1:08:13] actually challenge in your senses
[1:08:15] because fear is a revelation what your
[1:08:17] sins can declare
[1:08:21] faith is something that your senses
[1:08:24] cannot declare
[1:08:26] so when it when when Elijah tool is
[1:08:30] servant go up and look and tell me what
[1:08:32] you see TC and he doesn't see nothing if
[1:08:34] I just say go sometimes yeah in other
[1:08:36] words keep going until they see
[1:08:37] something because I'm in the season
[1:08:39] where the supernatural have to break I
[1:08:41] don't mean the season where something
[1:08:42] has to be seen I'm in the season where
[1:08:45] something got to happen we got country
[1:08:46] after all these years and there's a
[1:08:48] promise we tell them seven Thunders
[1:08:50] after the voices to that group I could
[1:08:51] take the word during a special season
[1:08:53] you can't tell me there's nothing you
[1:08:55] have to be you know something had to be
[1:08:57] wrong with you you have to keep going
[1:08:58] again exercise yourself go until they
[1:09:01] get a report and then that's even come
[1:09:03] back and say I see a cloud that's
[1:09:05] impossible
[1:09:07] foreign
[1:09:25] let's see if we could wrap up here by
[1:09:27] God's grace
[1:09:28] okay I hope it it didn't blessed tonight
[1:09:30] now when you get it that way at it if
[1:09:33] you're in Godzilla that way don't try to
[1:09:35] add the own book it could work on
[1:09:37] healing it will work on nothing else
[1:09:39] he's got a blending with the same
[1:09:41] materialized material it is vulcanized
[1:09:45] to then patients okay most of that
[1:09:48] patients with God Moses have Credit
[1:09:50] Karma people a little contrast here
[1:09:52] between him and God God showed him his
[1:09:54] glory he said when you see the glory and
[1:09:56] you see he had Faith what's that in my
[1:09:58] hand and we know the story and so on
[1:10:00] like that right okay so I'm just gonna
[1:10:02] skip down when he got in the wilderness
[1:10:04] it was 40 miles from where he crossed
[1:10:07] there right across there the cross again
[1:10:09] Moses the Wilderness with her 40 years
[1:10:11] patience and we should have patience
[1:10:13] with one another could we give a lot of
[1:10:14] hand on that patience with one another
[1:10:17] oh God their brother boy I tell him I
[1:10:19] tell him you're listening I'm patience
[1:10:22] our patients we get so much impatient
[1:10:24] with one another
[1:10:26] we think we've got to be like Moses
[1:10:28] Moses have patience with the people look
[1:10:31] what caused him not to go over
[1:10:34] if you are trying to do something like I
[1:10:37] have tried to get this message over at
[1:10:39] the Tabernacle to see that each member
[1:10:41] of the Tabernacle becomes this it is
[1:10:44] hard to do I try to have patience this
[1:10:47] is 33 years of patients women still
[1:10:50] popular here this is what I'm talking
[1:10:52] about still just a few but just have
[1:10:55] patience see just have patience wait
[1:10:58] have to if you ain't got it don't try to
[1:11:01] build on this down here have patience
[1:11:04] even
[1:11:05] one time when that Rebellion bunch of
[1:11:07] people are impatient they cause Moses to
[1:11:09] do something was wrong but yet when it
[1:11:12] comes to our Showdown God got sick of
[1:11:14] the action he said separate yourself
[1:11:16] Moses I'll kill the whole bunch of them
[1:11:19] starting you he thrown himself in the
[1:11:21] bridge and said God don't do it what
[1:11:22] patience with the people that was
[1:11:26] rebelling against it is that right what
[1:11:27] I'm really there tonight
[1:11:29] locations with the people
[1:11:32] that was Rebellion against him I wonder
[1:11:35] if we could do that
[1:11:37] and I was thinking is a title a message
[1:11:39] or something I wonder if we could
[1:11:40] imagine I wonder if we could do that if
[1:11:44] you can't don't try to build on this
[1:11:47] you know that's the way the first one
[1:11:49] was falconized into this he said no
[1:11:52] Hebrews children had patience
[1:12:00] our God is evil but nevertheless we are
[1:12:03] not good about that image patients
[1:12:04] knowing this that who want to raise them
[1:12:07] up in the last days dislike your means
[1:12:09] so much
[1:12:11] what would raise it up in the last days
[1:12:13] when it comes about an image we won't do
[1:12:15] it we will give Caesar what a Caesar but
[1:12:17] when it comes to Caesar interfere with
[1:12:18] God
[1:12:19] God said don't you go to that image I
[1:12:21] won't do it God is able to deliver us
[1:12:23] and we know the story as we wrap up
[1:12:26] praise the name of the Lord
[1:12:29] praising yourself
[1:12:35] patience is what will help you of being
[1:12:39] upset
[1:12:40] from something somebody want to warn you
[1:12:42] patience work with me
[1:12:43] sometimes you have to say you know what
[1:12:45] they see that but it didn't mean
[1:12:54] so in order to get your protection you
[1:12:56] have to have patience
[1:12:57] because when somebody treats you badly
[1:13:00] I see something to hurt you or wound you
[1:13:03] and you respond it just goes to show
[1:13:05] that you're not there yet
[1:13:07] we have to come to that maturity
[1:13:09] and this comes like a piece of your
[1:13:11] model this thing called patience because
[1:13:14] you are being patient with that person
[1:13:16] you are being patient when God and you
[1:13:19] have your patience with yourself
[1:13:21] so even though right now tonight as we
[1:13:23] close you're not where you want to be
[1:13:26] you know you're not what you used to be
[1:13:29] but you're not even going to get to you
[1:13:30] because you will have patience with God
[1:13:33] and patients with your own selves
[1:13:34] because I'm with your brethren let's buy
[1:13:37] it
[1:13:38] almighty God I
[1:13:41] I was so blessed to come tonight
[1:13:44] and share distinguisher people
[1:13:47] because not a weird confidence Lord
[1:13:50] don't
[1:13:51] speak to their hearts Lord
[1:13:53] I come here tonight that
[1:13:55] there are those here just need some
[1:13:57] encouragement and they won't pull back
[1:13:59] that they wouldn't draw back they
[1:14:02] wouldn't shrink into their own world
[1:14:03] where all these years
[1:14:05] by bit step by step
[1:14:09] maybe they haven't hit the promised land
[1:14:10] yet
[1:14:11] but you brought them out thus far
[1:14:15] there's a song that says I I don't feel
[1:14:19] no retired I don't believe he brought me
[1:14:21] this far to leave me
[1:14:24] Lord and I don't believe it brought us
[1:14:25] to leave us I believe that this here is
[1:14:29] on the end of you this here is is what
[1:14:32] you want believe that that you want this
[1:14:35] out to your people
[1:14:37] that they have need of patience
[1:14:39] patience with God patients with the
[1:14:42] minister the pastor patients with
[1:14:44] patients with each other
[1:14:46] gorgeous like our children everyone is
[1:14:48] different
[1:14:49] and we often take Lord care as to what
[1:14:52] we say to each one because each one is
[1:14:55] different
[1:14:56] and you have children from different
[1:14:57] callings different levels he says some
[1:15:00] Africa Faith some are strong feet some
[1:15:01] of bulldog feet even said to your
[1:15:03] Prophet as the third police for those
[1:15:05] with a weaker faith
[1:15:07] that they could just speak and see it
[1:15:09] materialize their doors have been
[1:15:11] bullied off fruitful just to live and
[1:15:13] they leave you and see it happen
[1:15:15] called not everybody at the same level
[1:15:17] but every one of your children have
[1:15:19] faith free to trust you and to believe
[1:15:21] you
[1:15:22] it might be a challenge in our
[1:15:24] circumstance in our condition to have
[1:15:26] confidence
[1:15:28] I think people walk away from the
[1:15:29] message walk completely out they do
[1:15:32] something completely different work
[1:15:33] packages some church age backwards stuff
[1:15:36] here we are we are challenged to believe
[1:15:39] the message itself
[1:15:40] but the church in the last days will be
[1:15:43] a super church because super reads
[1:15:45] auctioneers they had to
[1:15:47] but to get to the Hedge tool is a
[1:15:49] process
[1:15:51] we quoted many times super Church super
[1:15:53] race as she nears The Headstone they get
[1:15:56] to the headstones his feet and virtue
[1:16:00] Falcon Heights knowledge Falcon lights
[1:16:02] temporary Falcon lights patience
[1:16:05] vulcanized God is vulcanized better with
[1:16:07] kindness Vulcanizing then we enter
[1:16:09] nearing The Headstone where the power of
[1:16:12] God begin to flow sons of God virtue
[1:16:16] fluent free just like when a woman of
[1:16:18] Jesus and virtue flew out of his body he
[1:16:21] said who touched me who touched my
[1:16:22] clothes I felt hurt you left me that
[1:16:26] same future will be the body of Christ
[1:16:28] in the last days father may not virtue
[1:16:30] go tonight into every home every heart
[1:16:32] every person he understood and I vote
[1:16:35] you going to them if they are sick here
[1:16:36] if they are vaccine restore them if they
[1:16:39] are unsaved and they're hearing tonight
[1:16:40] then you see them if they are born and
[1:16:43] their hearing it at night May you
[1:16:44] deliver them anyone I would hear father
[1:16:46] called me of Freedom may they understand
[1:16:48] that God is real your word is true and
[1:16:51] the word the Bible is caught in print
[1:16:53] it's the word of God still it's the word
[1:16:56] and when we speak tonight it becomes a
[1:16:58] Living Word foreign
[1:17:04] [Music]

[1:17:28] special to you edifying to you
[1:17:31] that's not away your confidence
