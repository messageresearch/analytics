[10:23] amen thank you brother anthony certainly
[10:25] a great privilege
[10:27] to be gathered here tonight by the grace
[10:30] of god and
[10:31] certainly a great honor to be
[10:35] in fellowship around the word of god in
[10:38] such a time as this
[10:40] we thank god for his grace for his love
[10:43] for his mercy
[10:44] for his promises for his word
[10:47] that has never failed and can never fail
[10:50] and um uh before we get started we want
[10:54] to go to the throne
[10:56] of grace and um we do have
[11:00] uh firstly a note of praise and then we
[11:02] have two prayer requests
[11:04] uh tonight and that we want to take
[11:06] before the throne before we get into
[11:09] this bible study tonight uh a note of
[11:12] praise i think
[11:13] this request i believe went up uh last
[11:15] week uh from
[11:16] alice robinson wants to give god praise
[11:18] for his mighty healing touch
[11:20] from kovid at the age of 90.
[11:23] she said it's the grace of god her
[11:24] daughter give thanks to god and all
[11:26] those who prayed on their behalf so we
[11:27] thank god
[11:29] for that testimony tonight and we do
[11:31] have two prayer requests uh one
[11:33] for sister christine she's requesting
[11:35] prayer for
[11:36] an infection under her toes it has
[11:38] gotten worse and she's
[11:40] having problems standing and walking and
[11:43] she's giving god thanks
[11:44] in advance for healing and also
[11:48] for sister kangale requesting prayer
[11:51] for her left eye having some high
[11:53] pressure in the eye
[11:55] she did two tests and we'll be seeing
[11:57] the specialist tomorrow
[11:58] please go out to know the results
[12:00] believing god for his healing
[12:02] and if tonight uh there's anyone else
[12:04] who
[12:05] is under the sound of my voice tonight
[12:07] and you have a request
[12:08] that you were not able to send in and
[12:11] you want to lift your hand
[12:13] bow ahead close your eyes as we approach
[12:15] the throne of grace tonight
[12:16] he's a mighty healer he's a mighty
[12:19] restorer he's a waymaker
[12:21] and time and time again we have seen
[12:23] prayer requests become notes of praise
[12:24] so
[12:25] let us bow our heads in reverence and
[12:27] respect to god tonight our gracious
[12:29] heavenly father we thank you for your
[12:30] love for your grace
[12:32] for your mercy lord for lord what you
[12:35] have
[12:36] done for us we come tonight lord
[12:39] not as beggars we come tonight
[12:42] understanding who we are
[12:44] that we are sons and daughters of the
[12:45] living god and you said all i was in god
[12:47] you poured into christ and all that is
[12:49] in christ
[12:50] you pour into the church lord and you
[12:52] died on calvary
[12:53] and you paid it all lord you paid for
[12:57] salvation you paid for healing you paid
[12:59] for deliverance it's already paid for
[13:02] it doesn't need to be paid for it's
[13:03] already paid for so
[13:05] lord we thank you lord that you have
[13:07] given us access to what has been paid
[13:09] for so we come tonight
[13:10] lord to make a withdrawal from what you
[13:13] have already paid for
[13:14] we come tonight to make a withdrawal for
[13:16] our sister christine
[13:18] and we come against that infection lord
[13:20] in the name of jesus christ right now
[13:22] lord may the holy spirit move into that
[13:25] room and touch her from the crown of our
[13:26] head to the souls
[13:28] of our feet lord we bind and dispatch
[13:31] angels against that infection and we
[13:34] proclaim
[13:35] healing in the mighty powerful name of
[13:37] jesus christ and lord for sister kangale
[13:40] lord with that pressure in the eye we
[13:42] pray dear god and even now it will be
[13:44] normalized
[13:46] lord we do not come to believe the
[13:48] doctor's report we want your report and
[13:51] may your report supersede any report
[13:53] from the doctor may you
[13:54] bring healing to her right now father
[13:56] and if there's anyone in this room
[13:58] tonight
[13:58] with whatever situation whatever lord
[14:01] problem whatever challenge be it
[14:03] physical
[14:04] be it lord emotional be it financial
[14:07] be it lord a family situation whatever
[14:10] it might be
[14:11] be it a spiritual challenge whatever it
[14:13] might be tonight
[14:14] lord we bring it all under the authority
[14:16] of the holy spirit tonight
[14:18] we thank you for your blood that covers
[14:19] a multitude of sins we thank you for
[14:22] making a way for us when we had no hope
[14:24] we had no chance we had no
[14:26] possibility or opportunity but lord you
[14:29] have opened it up lord that we can have
[14:30] access to you
[14:32] not by our merit not by our ability not
[14:34] by anything we could have ever done but
[14:36] your love
[14:37] reached us found us called us so father
[14:39] we thank you tonight
[14:41] for uniting us by your blood father we
[14:44] are from different walks of life
[14:46] lord and there's no way possible we
[14:48] could come to know one another had it
[14:50] not been
[14:51] because of you so we thank you for the
[14:53] love that we feel
[14:54] although we may be disconnected in these
[14:56] times lord we are still
[14:58] united as one body as a portion of this
[15:00] great mystical body so father may you
[15:03] touch your children tonight may you
[15:04] touch everyone tonight
[15:06] lord young old lord may you touch every
[15:09] believer
[15:10] may you touch everyone who is strong in
[15:12] faith and looking to get stronger
[15:14] may you touch those who might be weaker
[15:15] and looking to get strength
[15:17] may you give a charge in the church
[15:19] tonight lord to keep pressing the battle
[15:21] we pray our blessing on our pastor
[15:23] lord upon the ministry upon the officers
[15:26] the helps the governments the
[15:28] the teams the groupings the leaders the
[15:30] families lord those that we can see here
[15:32] in this room those that are behind the
[15:34] cameras
[15:35] lord we don't know who they all may be
[15:37] but we pray their god
[15:38] that you would reveal yourself to each
[15:40] one in a personal way
[15:43] that they will come to know you by
[15:44] revelation and by experience may you
[15:46] take me completely out of the way
[15:48] and may you speak to your children lord
[15:51] may you bring my thoughts and ideas
[15:53] under your control and
[15:55] lord may you push it away and may you
[15:56] speak what needs to be said tonight to
[15:58] your children
[15:59] in the precious name of jesus christ and
[16:01] the church says amen
[16:02] and amen and amen i certainly want to
[16:05] thank you all
[16:06] for your diligence and for your
[16:09] commitment and for your dedication
[16:12] and it's not a dedication to the church
[16:13] it's not the dedication to the ministry
[16:15] it's a dedication unto the lord
[16:17] it's what we do because we are called to
[16:20] something higher
[16:21] and we respond to this spiritual calling
[16:24] that
[16:24] keeps us above the water as it will it's
[16:27] very easy to drown in these times and
[16:29] it's a very
[16:31] difficult time for so many people in so
[16:33] many ways and we are being challenged
[16:35] uh to respond to these different things
[16:38] that are happening around us
[16:39] and um so i pray tonight that your faith
[16:43] you know as jesus would have prayed it
[16:44] would not fail and that you would take
[16:46] courage and strength
[16:47] to navigate what we are going through
[16:50] all the way to the
[16:51] rapture to the wedding supper to being
[16:54] able to share your own testimony
[16:56] of how you made it over of how you made
[16:58] it through
[16:59] how you made it through 2020 how you
[17:01] made it through 2021
[17:03] and how much of a time the lord will
[17:05] allow us to
[17:06] to be on this journey on this side you
[17:09] know i really want to appreciate all of
[17:11] the
[17:11] all of the services that have uh been
[17:14] going on i am blessed i trust you are as
[17:17] well i want to salute brother ovid for
[17:19] the bible studies he he he took up a
[17:22] mantle over the last few weeks
[17:24] you know and i really want to salute him
[17:26] for that and the dedication with the
[17:27] prayer meetings and certainly for the
[17:29] inspiration
[17:30] for the services that are streamed out
[17:32] um and it's such a great privilege and
[17:35] such a blessing to see the stored up
[17:37] food
[17:37] that god has has allowed us to be able
[17:40] to feast on
[17:41] that uh when you listen to some of these
[17:43] services you're wondering if it's
[17:44] preaching
[17:45] this month or this month and then you
[17:47] hear you know 2018 2016
[17:49] 20 and realize that you know god has a
[17:52] way
[17:52] that when things come from eternity they
[17:55] could apply to time in different ways
[17:57] so we are trusting god tonight
[18:00] um so i like to get into this teaching i
[18:03] i
[18:03] i was telling my wife um those few weeks
[18:06] that i wasn't here i feel like i come
[18:08] here for the first time
[18:09] um it feels you know like like
[18:12] like a new experience so we just go out
[18:14] tonight um
[18:16] as we go into his wood i have a
[18:19] uh uh a thought for tonight
[18:23] it's somewhat i don't want to use the
[18:24] word strange maybe just a word different
[18:27] but in my heart i want to encourage us
[18:30] you know and for
[18:31] a few weeks i've been telling bird over
[18:33] i want to look
[18:34] at this study i want to look at the
[18:36] story and um we were talking and he says
[18:38] weeks are telling me looking at this
[18:39] thing you know i say
[18:40] i still want to look at this study you
[18:42] know and the more i looked into it is
[18:44] the more
[18:45] my mind was blown with how
[18:48] it unfolded um you know and to see how
[18:52] much thing got locked up in there um for
[18:54] us you know so
[18:56] you know when we go through life if i
[18:58] could just talk a little bit before the
[19:00] teaching
[19:01] um there are certain things as you get
[19:04] more mature you begin to value more
[19:06] and more you know um as you get older
[19:11] as you go through different experiences
[19:14] uh certain things take on greater
[19:16] meaning
[19:17] you know the desire or the hunt you may
[19:20] have to acquire
[19:21] wealth or physical assets uh begin to
[19:24] fade when other things may
[19:26] become a priority you know priorities
[19:28] change
[19:29] depending on your stage of life you know
[19:31] you go through a period of time
[19:34] when you're younger where schooling and
[19:36] education may be important
[19:38] and it is a rush to get qualified to get
[19:41] a job and then
[19:42] it is expected or it is understood or it
[19:45] is desired
[19:46] that the whole context of employment and
[19:49] a job is to be able to get a home and be
[19:51] able to maybe have a family and maybe
[19:53] be in a position at a certain point in
[19:55] time to be able to retire you know and
[19:57] when i was looking at these these
[19:59] elements and i looked at the broad
[20:01] categories
[20:03] um of these things most of what people
[20:06] fight for
[20:07] most of what people contend for most of
[20:10] what people
[20:11] argue and debate about really reside in
[20:15] three main areas
[20:17] most of the stresses of our lives
[20:20] can be traced to three mean categories
[20:25] wealth people stress about their wealth
[20:28] being able to pay for things having
[20:30] things not having things you struggle of
[20:32] having things and
[20:35] family issues in and around
[20:38] family and health so if you were to
[20:41] identify
[20:42] three main factors that
[20:46] for your journey of life would be an
[20:48] area of
[20:49] discussion conversation debate
[20:52] contention
[20:52] stress concern worry perplexity
[20:57] it's something typically to do with your
[20:59] family
[21:00] with your wealth or with your health
[21:04] you know as i was looking at the context
[21:06] because for those who
[21:08] have been around for a while i believe
[21:10] that the gospel is
[21:11] is a practical real living gospel it's
[21:14] not
[21:14] so mysterious that we can't apply it to
[21:16] our lives and the struggles of our daily
[21:18] lives how we deal with family
[21:20] and family situations how we deal with
[21:22] relationships and people who are in
[21:24] contact with us and we could consider
[21:26] all that part of family
[21:27] it could be blood family or extended
[21:29] family but i debate around
[21:31] family and people who are in your circle
[21:33] the whole debate of wealth and
[21:34] and and and job and career and money and
[21:37] saving and providing and these things
[21:40] and on your health and i was looking at
[21:43] and just so you know i'm going into the
[21:44] story of job tonight because the story
[21:47] of job
[21:48] is a story that deals with wealth
[21:52] it deals with family and it deals with
[21:55] health
[21:57] these three great factors and if i want
[21:59] to give tonight
[22:01] a title for this study tonight it'll be
[22:04] loss
[22:05] pain and betrayal a study of job
[22:11] loss pain
[22:14] and betrayal a study of job
[22:18] the title may sound somewhat down
[22:22] but i could assure you it's a feat
[22:25] building
[22:26] teaching loss
[22:29] pain and betrayal a study of job
[22:32] and i'm letting you know that it is to
[22:35] build your feet
[22:37] it is not by the end of this teaching
[22:39] you leave sad and depressed
[22:41] but the reality is friends at some point
[22:44] in time we have to deal with loss
[22:48] we have to deal with pain and we have to
[22:51] deal
[22:52] with betrayal lost pain and betrayal
[22:56] would typically affect one or
[22:59] all of these three areas of our lives
[23:03] family wealth
[23:07] and our health
[23:11] many suffer the painful loss and you
[23:13] could combine your words now
[23:14] painful loss of family
[23:18] painful loss of wealth painful loss
[23:21] of health many of the issues in business
[23:24] come from the betrayal
[23:27] something of trust that was broken or
[23:29] breached
[23:31] some of the issues with family is that
[23:32] of betrayal you never thought somebody
[23:34] would have done this you
[23:35] didn't think that was the stand they
[23:36] would have taken and all of these are
[23:39] issues of life that are real to us
[23:42] so i want to journey if you would and
[23:45] kind of see
[23:46] what god placed in the wood around loss
[23:50] pain and betrayal around wealth family
[23:53] and health
[23:54] and to see the journey of this man
[23:57] called job who to this day is still a
[24:00] mystery
[24:01] there are many things in a book of job
[24:03] that is mysterious
[24:05] we speak of job and we preach about job
[24:08] in
[24:08] in a very in a very focused way at times
[24:11] and few people realize that
[24:13] job or the book of job rather has
[24:17] 42 chapters in the book of job
[24:21] so job is an immense drama that is
[24:24] played out for us so
[24:26] by the grace of god i i don't know how
[24:28] far i'll get but i want you to ride with
[24:30] me i want you to
[24:31] drive with me if you will from journey
[24:34] to journey along this journey and by the
[24:36] grace of god if
[24:37] if i could get to the end of the story
[24:39] tonight um
[24:40] we'll trust god to get there so we'll
[24:43] start with
[24:44] [Music]
[24:45] we will not be able to read the entire
[24:48] book tonight
[24:49] so we will read some scriptures we will
[24:52] jump over a few of them and to identify
[24:54] certain patterns and then we'll pull out
[24:56] a few things so
[24:57] but we do want to start with job 1
[25:00] 1 and i want you to draw attention to
[25:03] the fact that
[25:03] jobs chapter 1 and 2 form somewhat of an
[25:07] introduction
[25:08] of this story between chapters
[25:12] 3 and chapters 37
[25:15] is like another stage of expression of
[25:17] job story and we're going to
[25:19] reach let's call that stage 3 and then
[25:22] after
[25:23] joe 37 we have job 38 onwards which is
[25:27] we'll call it stage four
[25:28] for the purpose of this teaching tonight
[25:30] so stage one is chapter one stage two is
[25:32] chapter two
[25:33] stage three is chapters three the 37
[25:37] and then 38 on what is four all right i
[25:39] hope i haven't lost anybody
[25:41] so jew of one one there was a man in a
[25:42] land of us or
[25:44] whose which history would place
[25:47] somewhere around saudi arabia
[25:50] or no or north arabia but in that
[25:53] arabian area there was a man in the land
[25:55] of who's
[25:56] whose name was job that man was perfect
[26:00] and upright and one that feared god
[26:03] and extrude evil in the amplified it
[26:07] says there was a man in the land of us
[26:08] whose name was job
[26:10] and that man was blameless and upright
[26:13] so perfect and upright in the king james
[26:15] blameless and upright but we get the
[26:17] picture
[26:18] you couldn't put your finger on this man
[26:20] there was something about him
[26:22] and and this first verse here we are
[26:24] reading about is about his character
[26:26] so it's about a man all right there was
[26:28] a man in the land of us whose name was
[26:30] job
[26:30] and that man was perfect and upright one
[26:33] that feared god and we understand the
[26:34] value of fear and god we have done many
[26:36] teachings on the fear of god is the
[26:38] beginning of wisdom we have we have gone
[26:40] through that
[26:41] one who feared god and he amplified it
[26:42] says with reverence
[26:44] and abstain from and turn away evil
[26:47] is in the amplified so this estude evil
[26:50] is a two-part thing abstain from
[26:54] and turn away f from and i want to just
[26:57] touch on this because
[26:58] this thing is so profound when you drive
[27:00] slowly
[27:02] abstain from and turn away from abstain
[27:05] is when you have the control so you are
[27:08] actively deciding i'm not going to go
[27:10] somewhere because it's evil i'm not
[27:12] going to do a certain thing
[27:13] because it's evil that's the kind of man
[27:15] job was so i want to establish
[27:17] in our hearts and minds this man called
[27:19] job as a tie for us
[27:21] to look at our lives through this lens
[27:23] of job and the experience of job
[27:25] and the struggles of job and yet the
[27:27] testimony of job
[27:28] that we are supposed to aspire to that
[27:30] he would on the one hand abstain from
[27:33] evil
[27:33] which means avoid it at all costs it
[27:36] means
[27:37] not deliberately put yourself in a
[27:39] position
[27:40] that could be deemed evil but the flip
[27:43] side of it
[27:44] and turned away from evil applies to
[27:47] sometimes in life their situation that
[27:49] you didn't control you didn't put
[27:50] yourself there but evil is present
[27:55] it's one thing to drive into a club and
[27:57] you choose to go to a club
[27:59] it's another thing to go to a family
[28:00] member's home and you didn't expect it
[28:02] to be a certain kind of situation
[28:04] but then the change it changes while
[28:05] you're there
[28:07] you didn't know it was going to be that
[28:08] way you didn't plan to be there to see
[28:11] what was going on
[28:12] but because the situation changed you
[28:14] turn away from evil and now you exit
[28:16] the scene or you move away or you go
[28:17] somewhere else this was the metal of
[28:19] this man job and i want it to be
[28:21] practical for us because this gospel
[28:24] that we preach this
[28:25] message that we live for is one that is
[28:27] manifested in our lives
[28:29] and we can see clearly here from chapter
[28:32] one verse one
[28:33] this man is a man who we would call a
[28:34] real christian
[28:37] you couldn't put your thing on him he
[28:38] wasn't wondering what his testimony was
[28:41] it is very clear it covers every base
[28:43] perfect and upright
[28:45] feared god and is chewed evil it's a
[28:48] testimony we should all
[28:50] wish or desire or pray that if somebody
[28:53] were to write about us
[28:54] these are the things that they would see
[28:57] here is a man
[28:58] named so-and-so or there's a sister
[29:00] named
[29:01] so-and-so who is perfect and upright you
[29:04] can't put a blame on them
[29:05] they stand up a certain way and they
[29:07] fear god
[29:08] and they as true evil so we are
[29:10] established on the character and nature
[29:13] of the man because
[29:14] the nature and the character of the man
[29:16] is what
[29:17] leads to the unfolding of what will come
[29:19] next so we're going to move
[29:20] from chapter one verse one i hope not
[29:22] going too slowly but i want us to really
[29:24] really understand what we're looking at
[29:26] tonight all right
[29:28] so two and they were born unto him
[29:32] seven sons and three daughters so
[29:35] here we move from the man to his family
[29:38] you with me
[29:39] all right so we moved from the man in
[29:41] chapter one to
[29:42] a view of his family in verse two
[29:46] seven sons and three daughters
[29:49] now we're gonna move from his family to
[29:51] his wealth
[29:53] we talked about what affects our lives
[29:55] our wealth our family our health
[29:57] so in the first three verses of job
[30:00] we moved from the man to his family to
[30:02] his wealth
[30:03] his substance also was seven
[30:06] thousand sheep and 3 000 camels
[30:09] and 500 yoke of oxen and 500 she asses
[30:14] and a very great household so is that so
[30:16] that listen
[30:17] this man was the greatest of all the men
[30:21] of the east i want us to pause there for
[30:23] a minute
[30:24] because we preach and talk about job but
[30:26] many of us miss the fact that
[30:28] by all descriptions by the forbes
[30:31] magazine of its day
[30:33] by whatever credential you want to
[30:35] attribute to the stature of this man
[30:37] here we have scripture defining that
[30:41] this was the greatest of all the men of
[30:43] the east
[30:45] this is not a news reporter this is not
[30:47] an article
[30:48] this is not an investigative report this
[30:50] is scripture
[30:52] defining that when the assessment is
[30:54] made
[30:55] this man job was wealthy he was the
[30:58] greatest of all the men of the east
[31:00] yet still he was perfect yet still he
[31:02] was upright
[31:03] yet still he feared god yet still he
[31:05] eschewed evil
[31:07] which meant that his wealth his success
[31:09] his reputation
[31:11] the respect that was garnered for him
[31:13] was ghana the correct way
[31:15] he didn't do it on their hand there was
[31:16] no crooked activity
[31:18] his testimony was consistent you could
[31:20] not put a finger to him anybody with me
[31:22] tonight
[31:24] we are building bear in mind again
[31:28] our teaching tonight is a loss pain and
[31:30] betrayal
[31:31] you can't lose what you don't have you
[31:34] will not get pain if there's nothing
[31:36] that could ever hurt you
[31:38] and there's no betrayal if there's
[31:39] nobody to betray you or there's not
[31:41] something worth betraying
[31:43] so we are painting the picture here in
[31:45] verse one two and three thus far
[31:48] and now we move from the man to his
[31:51] family
[31:52] to his wealth and back to his character
[31:55] verse four and his sons went and feasted
[31:58] in their houses
[31:59] everyone his day all right for
[32:02] bible scholars and for the way scripture
[32:05] is written everyone his day is referring
[32:06] to his birthday
[32:08] that that's what it refers to there so
[32:09] if you if you don't study it
[32:11] you'll see it so everyone his day
[32:14] everyone has their day so it's the day
[32:15] of the year so basically
[32:17] every one of these sons on their
[32:19] birthday would have a
[32:20] big celebration you know people there's
[32:22] their pits out there some people when
[32:24] they come they they want to hide it they
[32:26] want to take it secret they don't want
[32:27] to wait to know it's a baby they
[32:28] they take a time to reflect there's
[32:30] nothing wrong with that people have
[32:32] choices with how they treat with their
[32:33] bodies
[32:34] not jobs boys job's boys
[32:37] all seven of them made up made it
[32:41] is a serious it's not a thing to play
[32:43] with all right and his sons went and
[32:46] this is not having me
[32:47] feasted in their houses everyone his day
[32:50] and sent and called for their three
[32:52] sisters to eat
[32:53] and to drink with them listen to verse
[32:55] five and it was so
[32:57] when the days of their feasting were
[32:58] gone about
[33:00] listen now to this man called you watch
[33:02] the character of the manju
[33:03] that job sent and sanctified them
[33:07] and rose up early in the morning and
[33:10] offered
[33:10] burnt offerings according to the number
[33:14] of them all
[33:16] so job wanted to know who was there
[33:19] what all you did there i know always
[33:22] celebrating your birthday
[33:23] but i want to be able to offer according
[33:26] to the number of them all for
[33:28] job said it may be without
[33:32] evidence of what took place in the body
[33:35] party
[33:35] he said it may be that my sons have
[33:38] sinned
[33:39] and cursed god in their hearts not even
[33:42] from their lips you know
[33:43] in their hearts thus did job continually
[33:46] so
[33:46] job's love for his sons was so great
[33:50] so i want you to show the connections it
[33:52] was not that
[33:54] job was estranged from his boys it
[33:56] wasn't that job had no relationship
[33:58] with his sons it wasn't that job didn't
[34:01] know what is going on with them
[34:02] he was so in tune with them and their
[34:05] lives and what they did
[34:07] and their habits and their customs and
[34:09] their nature
[34:10] that at the point of knowing that they
[34:12] had a birthday party
[34:14] he went and gave an offering to god
[34:18] just in case one of them thought
[34:21] something
[34:22] in their hearts they cursed god and his
[34:25] love for them wanted to protect them so
[34:27] much
[34:28] that he wanted to give an offering to
[34:30] cover them
[34:31] he wasn't worrying if they wanted to
[34:33] give an offering for themselves
[34:36] he wasn't saying i'm so busy mining my
[34:38] sheep and my flock that i hope i don't
[34:40] have time for them
[34:40] and they're on their own i'm giving
[34:42] context i'm i'm not describing anybody
[34:44] i'm not pointing fingers to anybody
[34:46] i'm painting a picture of the quality
[34:48] the character
[34:49] the nature of this man job anybody with
[34:52] me
[34:53] tonight at the rate i'm going i'm not
[34:55] going to finish tonight but
[34:56] work with me so many singers get so good
[34:58] at so long and there's
[34:59] i was kind of trying to get him the
[35:02] essence of it so he could see it as if
[35:03] you're there
[35:04] seeing a man job he has decisions to
[35:06] make he has a business to run
[35:08] he has more property more animals than
[35:10] everybody else
[35:11] and yet still hearing his sons he is not
[35:14] there at the border party but hearing
[35:16] what's going on with him
[35:17] he makes it his business to get up
[35:20] listen what the bible said
[35:21] he did it continually rose up early in
[35:24] the morning
[35:25] so you're not getting up 11 o'clock i
[35:26] wonder if that boys clean up no
[35:28] he is diligent about it he is consistent
[35:31] about it
[35:31] there's no accident with his actions he
[35:34] is deliberate he is
[35:35] intentional he has a plan he is doing
[35:38] his research
[35:39] he's not leaving it to accident he's not
[35:41] leaving it a chance
[35:42] he is interested in the well-being the
[35:44] welfare the success
[35:46] of his boys you don't want them to get
[35:47] into trouble
[35:50] is this coming real to us yet
[35:54] verse 6 now we switch
[35:58] from it is as if the author is now
[36:00] painting these pieces of the picture for
[36:02] us
[36:03] the success of job the man called job
[36:06] the structure of job
[36:07] what makes him unique his wealth his
[36:10] fame his success
[36:11] his family life is the perfect picture
[36:14] of what we aspire to be to have to
[36:17] achieve to do
[36:17] to live the testimony it's that balance
[36:20] between life and godliness it's all they
[36:22] are painted here
[36:23] between verse 1 and verse 6.
[36:27] and then verse 6 comes now there was a
[36:29] day when the sons of god
[36:32] angels came to present themselves before
[36:34] the lord
[36:36] and satan came also among them
[36:39] now the heat gets turned up and the lord
[36:42] said unto satan
[36:44] whence cometh thou
[36:48] in other words satan what are you doing
[36:51] and i find this question to be
[36:53] interesting
[36:54] because god could have gone straight to
[36:57] the point he wanted to get to
[36:59] but it is as if the author wants us to
[37:02] be clear
[37:03] of what satan's activity was before
[37:06] attending the meeting
[37:08] so when's comments though everything in
[37:10] scripture is deliberate this is not an
[37:12] accidental question god don't have time
[37:14] to just make conversation people
[37:17] there's no idle word in scripture so so
[37:20] this is god saying to us
[37:22] if he was ever wondering what satan is
[37:25] up to
[37:25] let me ask the question so for our
[37:27] benefit in 2021
[37:29] we could know what he's up to and the
[37:32] lord said unto satan once come as thou
[37:34] then satan answered the lord and said
[37:37] from going to
[37:38] and fro in the earth and from walking up
[37:40] and down in it
[37:43] in other words the devil not sitting
[37:45] down either
[37:46] playing pitch playing marble playing
[37:49] internet watching youtube
[37:50] the devil do have time for that he is
[37:53] moving around
[37:54] looking for prey looking for weakness
[37:57] looking for vulnerability looking to see
[38:00] what he could do he's
[38:01] he is actively pursuing stuff i want us
[38:04] to get this
[38:06] so it's a picture here of satan's
[38:08] activity
[38:10] and in the midst of this here we have
[38:12] verse eight and the lord
[38:14] unto satan hast thou considered
[38:17] my silver job that there is none like
[38:21] him in the earth
[38:23] a perfect and an upright man you know
[38:26] what it is for god
[38:27] to describe you as a perfect and upright
[38:29] man this is not your neighbor you know
[38:31] i've preached
[38:32] if your neighbor have a testimony about
[38:34] you check your testimony
[38:37] if your wife can't say something good
[38:38] about you check your testimony if your
[38:40] husband
[38:40] oh don't don't let me go there tonight
[38:42] never show any reviews here everybody
[38:44] just reverse out that street
[38:45] i'll come another street this is not the
[38:48] neighbor
[38:49] saying perfect and upright you know this
[38:51] is god
[38:52] telling satan have you considered
[38:56] has though considered my servant job
[39:00] not just consider him you know he is
[39:02] given the conditions
[39:04] about consideration
[39:07] that there is none like him in the earth
[39:09] one a perfect
[39:10] and an upright man to
[39:14] one that feared god and a steward evil
[39:18] so
[39:18] basically god the author of this book
[39:22] is repeating of his own choice
[39:25] chapter one verse one of job he is
[39:27] repeating it to the devil see
[39:29] if he didn't read it in chapter one
[39:31] verse one let me tell you about this man
[39:33] jew
[39:33] anybody with me ought to have the kind
[39:37] of testimony that god will say
[39:39] have you considered myself on clarence
[39:41] have you have you considered myself
[39:43] michael have you considered my daughter
[39:44] pauline have you considered
[39:48] don't you know that god speaks about his
[39:51] children as any as any happy proud
[39:53] father
[39:54] anybody with meat tonight it's something
[39:56] else when you see a child who's
[39:58] something you're proud about
[39:59] you want to tell other parents you want
[40:01] to tell other people you want to tell
[40:03] and and it's so god feeling good he says
[40:05] satan what he was doing
[40:06] i know you're too unfro body in people
[40:08] but yeah listen
[40:10] have you considered have you have you
[40:13] have you considered myself on job that
[40:15] there's
[40:16] none like him in the earth you're
[40:17] messing with all kinds of different
[40:18] people but
[40:19] take a look at this one here perfect and
[40:22] upright one that feared god and is true
[40:25] with evil
[40:26] bear in mind friends job is you always
[40:28] book any bible
[40:31] then satan answered the lord and said so
[40:34] satan's answer confirms the fact that he
[40:38] has been considering him
[40:42] because consideration meters started to
[40:44] look at he said the job fair god for not
[40:47] in other words and i said this before i
[40:49] believe in the last teaching
[40:50] in the security profession they have
[40:52] what they call soft targets
[40:54] and higher targets so they say when
[40:56] criminal elements looking for a house
[40:59] they look for soft targets soft targets
[41:02] mean
[41:02] there aren't visible signs of defenses
[41:05] you know so
[41:06] a heart attack it is when you put up a
[41:08] sign beware of the dog
[41:09] you might have no dog on it but just
[41:11] this sign beware of the dog
[41:13] sort of make somebody think twice do i
[41:15] really want to engage with a dog tonight
[41:17] or if you see a camera hanging up you
[41:19] don't know if it's real but just the
[41:20] visible center of a camera
[41:22] suggests that this is a harder target
[41:24] than the house next door
[41:26] with no sign of nobody we have no dog no
[41:28] camera
[41:29] so so so satan is saying the
[41:32] job fear god for naught listen to verse
[41:35] 10
[41:36] has down not made an hedge about him
[41:40] and many times talk about the hedge
[41:42] about him but the bible goes on
[41:44] has thou has not done made an hedge
[41:47] about him
[41:48] and about his house and about all that
[41:50] he had on every side
[41:52] listen i said i rejoice in just this
[41:55] scripture no no no because i recognize
[41:56] that
[41:57] when god said to bless you when david
[41:59] says cop run over
[42:00] this thing is a real thing the hedge was
[42:02] not just a wrong job
[42:04] because of job's testimony the head was
[42:07] about his house
[42:08] because of job's testimony the head was
[42:11] about
[42:11] all that he had on every side
[42:16] sometimes we worry about our children
[42:17] and our family and what we should be
[42:19] doing is getting so
[42:20] right with god so that god expand the
[42:23] edge
[42:24] expand the hedge around us to cover our
[42:27] families oh come on somebody help me
[42:29] tonight
[42:30] oh god help me to live so upright help
[42:32] me to have such a testimony
[42:34] but by my testimony it could extend to
[42:37] my house and i could say as for me and
[42:39] my house
[42:40] we will serve the lord oh anybody feel
[42:43] that way tonight
[42:45] so so listen satan's analysis of the
[42:48] situation
[42:50] not only picked up the protection that
[42:53] was around
[42:53] job it was evident that satan's research
[42:56] also surfaced the fact that job's family
[43:00] was protected those who were connected
[43:02] to job was protected
[43:03] and as a result of this satan say i
[43:06] don't even go in there
[43:09] hallelujah but i branham said you can
[43:11] live such a life that's it i don't know
[43:12] what to do with you oh god help me
[43:14] tonight
[43:14] i feel like getting up this chair i
[43:16] don't know what's gonna happen tonight
[43:17] you know
[43:18] you can live such a life that he devil
[43:20] don't even know what to do with you
[43:22] so satan was admitted by what he saw
[43:25] about this man job
[43:27] he had no weapons he could bring to the
[43:29] table come on now i want you to
[43:30] i want you to catch this here satan was
[43:33] realizing
[43:33] that he had nothing to bring to the
[43:36] stabilized joke he couldn't bring
[43:37] anything
[43:38] and it was not job's hedge it was the
[43:41] lord's hedge
[43:42] that was around job so when god put a
[43:45] hedge around you
[43:46] and put a protection around you and put
[43:49] angels dispatched around you to know
[43:51] that fear
[43:51] you think anybody could come in your
[43:53] area unless god allows it
[43:55] because he is the gatekeeper he is the
[43:57] one controlling the edge
[43:58] anybody with me tonight
[44:03] i try to lay a foundation this looks
[44:05] like
[44:06] but the clarence i was very careful to
[44:09] not call this part one
[44:11] because i have said part one many times
[44:13] i never got to part two so i tell myself
[44:15] i'm not saying part one because per
[44:17] adventure i don't get a part two
[44:19] but this look like it might have a part
[44:21] two
[44:23] wilson has do has not done mean and
[44:25] hedge about him and about his house and
[44:27] about all he had on every side
[44:29] listen this is this is powerful this is
[44:32] not
[44:33] this is not god speaking here i want you
[44:36] to catch this
[44:37] this is listen to the continuation thou
[44:40] has
[44:41] blessed the work of his hands you don't
[44:43] think the devil knows when god bless you
[44:47] you don't think demons are aware that
[44:49] the blessing of the lord is upon your
[44:51] life
[44:53] i want you to i want this to resonate
[44:55] upon you i want you to understand
[44:56] who you are in the context of this
[44:59] current situation
[45:00] to understand why your head should not
[45:02] be down
[45:03] why you should not be depressed why you
[45:05] should not be frustrated
[45:09] though has blessed the works of his
[45:10] hands and his substance
[45:12] is increased in the land all of that
[45:14] satan checking your bank accounting
[45:19] marveling at the blessing upon job by
[45:21] virtue of what his testimony
[45:23] his life and the blessing of the lord
[45:26] and here comes satan putin for the
[45:28] challenge but put further in hand now
[45:31] and touch all that he had
[45:33] and he will curse thee to thy face so
[45:35] this was
[45:36] the challenge now this was if this was a
[45:39] game
[45:40] if this is the game the game ends when
[45:43] job would curse god to his face
[45:46] everybody with me
[45:47] so the devil put this out as the line in
[45:50] his son
[45:51] that defines successful failure of job
[45:53] testimony he says
[45:54] put forth thy hand now and touch all
[45:56] that he had
[45:57] so this was going after substance all
[46:01] that he had
[46:01] all that he possessed this is not
[46:03] touching job now
[46:05] the first issue satan had was touch his
[46:07] possessions
[46:08] and what does he get this and satan
[46:11] because he doesn't know i want us to
[46:13] appreciate the fact that satan doesn't
[46:15] have this knowledge
[46:17] the same way satan had to ask jesus if
[46:19] thou be satan is still trying to figure
[46:21] you out
[46:22] just like he was trying to figure jesus
[46:23] out satan is asking this
[46:26] under the belief that if he touches
[46:28] job's possessions
[46:30] it would break job's confidence and
[46:32] faith and trust in god
[46:38] god on the other hand is looking at this
[46:40] and in his heart he's saying job's
[46:42] fate his trust his love his testimony
[46:46] is bigger than his possessions so
[46:49] whether he has the possession
[46:50] or doesn't have the possession his walk
[46:53] of uprightness is not going to change
[46:56] so god is confident
[47:00] to be able to respond in verse 12 and
[47:02] the lord said unto satan behold
[47:04] all that he has as in all of his
[47:06] possessions
[47:07] his business his money his assets
[47:10] his substance everything around them
[47:12] including his family
[47:13] all that is his possessions is in thy
[47:16] power
[47:17] only upon himself in other words don't
[47:20] touch job at all
[47:21] but touch everything around him
[47:24] only upon himself put not fought thy
[47:27] hand
[47:28] so satan went fought from the presence
[47:30] of the lord
[47:32] let's go on with driving verse 13 and
[47:36] there was a day
[47:38] when his sons and his daughters were
[47:39] eating and drinking wine in their eldest
[47:41] brother's house
[47:43] and they came a messenger unto job and
[47:45] said the oxen were plowing
[47:47] and the asses feeding beside them and
[47:49] the serbians fell upon them
[47:51] and took them away yea they have slain
[47:53] the servants with the edge of the sword
[47:55] and i only am escaped alone to tell thee
[47:58] while he is yet speaking so he talk in
[48:01] this thing
[48:01] while he is talking they come another
[48:04] and said the fire of god
[48:06] is fallen from heaven and i'd burn up
[48:08] the sheep and the servants and consume
[48:10] them
[48:10] and i only am escaped alone to tell thee
[48:13] so it's like
[48:14] bad news running into bad news running
[48:17] into
[48:17] bad news as soon as one man coming to
[48:19] the end of his bad news a new bad news
[48:21] start right
[48:23] while he was yet speaking i don't know
[48:24] how many people could deal with this
[48:25] this is
[48:26] very stressful while he was yet speaking
[48:28] there came also another
[48:30] and said the chaldeans made out three
[48:32] bands and fell
[48:33] upon the camels and have carried them
[48:35] away ye
[48:36] and slain thy servants with the edge of
[48:38] the sword and i
[48:40] only am escaped alone to tell thee while
[48:43] while he was yet speaking there came
[48:46] also another
[48:47] and said thy sons and thy daughters were
[48:50] eating and drinking wine
[48:51] in that in their eldest brother's house
[48:54] and behold
[48:55] there came a great win from the
[48:56] wilderness
[48:58] and smaller four corners of the house
[49:01] and it fell upon
[49:02] the young men and they are dead
[49:05] and i only am escaped alone to tell thee
[49:10] so in quick succession this is in one
[49:12] day this is not over a period of time
[49:14] he loses his wealth he loses
[49:18] his young sons
[49:23] verse 20 then job arose rent his mantle
[49:28] shaved his head fell down upon the
[49:31] ground and worshipped
[49:34] lord help us and said naked came i
[49:37] out of my mother's womb and naked shall
[49:40] i return to the
[49:42] the lord gave and the lord had taken
[49:45] away blessed be the name of the lord
[49:50] and the bible said in verse 22 in all
[49:52] this
[49:53] job sinned not nor charged
[49:57] god foolishly so charge god
[50:00] foolishly means to blame god
[50:04] so in all of this
[50:07] all of this he said not
[50:12] and he didn't blame god he lost his
[50:14] assets
[50:15] he lost his family so in that in this
[50:18] one day
[50:20] think about it friends in this one day
[50:22] we started off talking about
[50:23] family wealth and health
[50:27] in one day he suffered and we talk about
[50:30] lost pain and betrayal we'll get to the
[50:32] betrayal of that
[50:32] but in one day he suffered the loss
[50:36] and the pain of losing his wealth and
[50:39] losing his family
[50:40] and all of that is in chapter one of the
[50:43] book of job
[50:44] that has 42 chapters are we ready to
[50:46] keep driving friends
[50:50] job chapter 2 verse 1
[50:53] again there was a day when the sons of
[50:55] god came to present themselves before
[50:57] the lord
[50:59] and satan came also among them to
[51:01] present himself before the lord
[51:04] and the lord said unto satan from whence
[51:06] comes down
[51:07] it's as if this is a repeat of what you
[51:10] saw in chapter one
[51:11] and satan answered the lord and said
[51:13] this is ella listen the devil and idol
[51:16] from going to and from the earth and
[51:17] from walking up and down in it
[51:21] and the lord said unto satan no this is
[51:24] there are some things you try to
[51:26] understand and
[51:28] the lord i tell you the lord is
[51:29] wonderful when you unfold listen to see
[51:31] what god brings with in job
[51:34] listen i don't know how many people
[51:37] could really deal with job one
[51:40] and properly survive like it's not like
[51:43] we're talking about this thing but these
[51:44] things are real thing you know
[51:48] losing one child can mush up people
[51:51] losing two children could master people
[51:55] here job lose on the same day you're
[51:58] here you find out
[51:59] that this thing people get nervous break
[52:01] down for less than that
[52:02] way less than that and it really goes to
[52:06] show
[52:07] that those who are built in this age
[52:09] with this hour
[52:10] for the bride who are chosen by god they
[52:13] build different in them
[52:16] those who are built for this this is not
[52:18] everybody those who built this they
[52:20] built different
[52:21] because on top of what job is dealing
[52:24] with
[52:24] here the lord has not considered
[52:28] my silver jew that there is none like
[52:32] him in the ut a perfect
[52:35] and upright man one that feared god
[52:39] and his truest evil and listen to the
[52:42] next
[52:43] line that god hit and still
[52:46] he hold it listen i was studying this
[52:49] and
[52:50] those two words and still i just stopped
[52:52] and i was like and still
[52:55] and still despite it all
[52:58] and still god was looking at job and
[53:01] saying
[53:01] after all of that and still he hold it
[53:05] and still listen you know we are real
[53:08] and still in this room you know
[53:10] you know how much has gone wrong in our
[53:12] lives and still
[53:14] we're here tonight hallelujah you know
[53:17] how much reasons
[53:18] we had to give up and still you're
[53:21] standing
[53:22] you're but everyone's preaching you say
[53:24] i might be a wounded eagle i might have
[53:26] lost a wing
[53:27] but i am still an eagle
[53:30] and the same way you feel when you feel
[53:32] like giving up and chewing in your toe
[53:33] well
[53:34] is the same way god looks at you and see
[53:36] and still this standing
[53:38] 20 21 and still they're standing look
[53:41] what they lost and still they're
[53:43] standing
[53:44] and god is speaking and i and my mind is
[53:46] blown
[53:47] we know these things but when you
[53:48] process it slowly and say look how god
[53:51] come back and say and still so god is
[53:54] now
[53:55] considering the events of chapter one
[53:58] fully conscious of the pain that job
[54:01] went through
[54:02] and still sin you see in other words
[54:04] it's almost like he taunted a villain
[54:08] he said you're considered job i tell you
[54:10] about this job
[54:12] i tell you this job different you
[54:14] challenge him and look he's still
[54:15] standing
[54:16] oh hallelujah look at him he's still
[54:18] standing
[54:19] you thought he went backslide you
[54:21] thought he would give up you're taught
[54:22] he what cuz the message
[54:24] you're taught he would say this thing is
[54:25] not real but look
[54:28] on a tuesday night he's still in bible
[54:30] study
[54:31] you're not gonna not this job not this
[54:34] job
[54:35] no amount of loss no amount of pain
[54:38] no amount of betrayal will take his joy
[54:41] away come on now somebody help me
[54:43] tonight
[54:45] nothing you do to his wealth nothing you
[54:47] do to his family
[54:48] nothing you do to his health
[54:52] will make him curse god will make him
[54:55] recount on his testimony that his god is
[54:57] real he's the same yesterday
[54:59] today and forever and is still able to
[55:01] bring every promise to pass
[55:04] i told you don't let the title fool you
[55:06] this is a fee building message
[55:08] lost pain and betrayal we could handle
[55:11] it
[55:12] we could deal with it nobody said it's
[55:14] easy nobody said it's gonna be easy
[55:16] new road wasn't promised to be easy but
[55:18] we are billed for pressure
[55:24] and still he hold it fast his integrity
[55:28] i love it although thou moves me
[55:32] against him to destroy him without cause
[55:38] so you don't think god knows what's
[55:40] going on you think
[55:42] understand god understand what he
[55:44] allowing to happen to us in different
[55:46] ways
[55:46] for our character to be formed for our
[55:49] testimony to be developed
[55:52] and satan answered the lord and i made
[55:54] it clear in chapter one
[55:56] god allowed the devil to touch
[55:58] everything around him but don't touch
[56:00] him
[56:00] he could have touched his wealth he
[56:01] could touch his family but he can never
[56:03] touch his health
[56:04] he can never touch his person but here
[56:06] it is now the devil goes in for this
[56:08] third element now
[56:11] and satan answered the lord and said
[56:12] skin for skin yea all that a man half
[56:15] will he give for his life powerful
[56:18] statement
[56:20] you know much millionaires would trade
[56:21] all their wealth
[56:23] to get more time on the youth
[56:29] people studied i look back at steve jobs
[56:31] who built apple
[56:33] billionaire he spent an incredible
[56:36] millions of dollars millions of dollars
[56:39] he could have spent he spent all he
[56:41] could possibly spend trying to get a
[56:42] cure for his cancer
[56:49] he was willing to give every check he
[56:51] tried every study
[56:53] natural everything he could possibly try
[56:55] he did everything he possibly could
[56:56] and the devil understand that he said
[56:58] listen skinfish can alter manhattan will
[57:00] he give for his life
[57:02] in other words in the balance of
[57:05] wealth against health and living and
[57:08] life
[57:08] a man will say keep my house if if i'm
[57:11] on a dead bed
[57:12] and and i can trade my house for more
[57:14] time i will take the house
[57:17] does it meet jeff man i gotta
[57:21] share it with it everybody wants to go
[57:23] to heaven
[57:24] nobody wants to die
[57:29] i want to go to heaven when i die
[57:34] and you see you ready to get you you're
[57:37] ready to go
[57:38] no no
[57:43] but not yet
[57:50] here it is devil understanding nature he
[57:53] says skin for skinny
[57:54] or what a man of heart will he give his
[57:56] life
[57:57] put forth that hand now and touch his
[58:00] bone and his flesh
[58:01] and he will curse thee to thy face
[58:05] and the lord said unto satan behold he
[58:08] is in dying hand but save his life in
[58:10] other words attack his health but don't
[58:12] kill him
[58:14] because now that is the full extent of
[58:16] what you could go to now
[58:17] you don't touch his wealth you don't
[58:19] touch his family now you're good at
[58:21] his health do what you want him but
[58:23] don't touch his life don't kill him
[58:26] so went satan fought from the presence
[58:29] of the lord
[58:30] and smote job with sore boils
[58:33] from the soul of his foot onto his crown
[58:37] and he took him a pot's hood this is a
[58:39] piece of pottery like a piece of clay
[58:40] like a
[58:41] broken piece of a pot to scrape himself
[58:44] up with all and he sat down
[58:48] among the ashes and i want to touch on
[58:52] this here we preach about it
[58:54] then said his wife unto him
[58:57] does thou still retain thine integrity
[59:01] curse god and die but he said unto her
[59:05] thou
[59:05] speak it as one of the foolish women
[59:09] speak it i want to pause there
[59:12] because this captures part of the story
[59:16] i want to look at this in the amplified
[59:18] first to see what the fullness of this
[59:20] verse mean
[59:25] then his wife said to him do you still
[59:27] cling to your integrity
[59:29] and i'm reading the amplified and your
[59:31] faith and trusting god without blaming
[59:34] him
[59:35] curse god and die but he said to her
[59:38] you speak as one of the
[59:42] spiritually foolish woman
[59:47] speaks ignorant and oblivious to god's
[59:51] will
[59:53] that bloom of mine so the foolish we are
[59:57] speaking about here when job says to his
[59:59] wife you speak like a foolish woman
[1:00:02] it's not the foolishness that lives
[1:00:04] between simplicity and wisdom you
[1:00:06] remember when he didn't study in
[1:00:07] proverbs
[1:00:07] he's simply foolish and he wise it is
[1:00:10] not the fool
[1:00:12] that sits between simplicity and wisdom
[1:00:14] this is the
[1:00:15] spiritual fool who speaks with the
[1:00:19] ignorance
[1:00:20] of god's will
[1:00:24] so i was sharing in a room that i was in
[1:00:26] in a meeting and zooming i said listen
[1:00:27] it's only one of two cities either god
[1:00:29] is in control
[1:00:30] or god is not in control it can't be
[1:00:33] there's no middle ground for this
[1:00:35] if we as believers believe god is in
[1:00:38] control
[1:00:39] then there is nothing in your power you
[1:00:41] could do that could change or move
[1:00:43] or impact what god's will and plan is
[1:00:46] because god is suffering well if i do
[1:00:49] this then this would be different and if
[1:00:51] we could do this this will be different
[1:00:52] what are you talking about
[1:00:55] if god listen i know people i i tell
[1:00:58] my my little daughter when she make up
[1:00:59] her mind to do something
[1:01:01] i say but what would ticket to change
[1:01:03] this girl mind and this is my daughter
[1:01:04] not two years old yet if she wants
[1:01:07] something and you distract and give her
[1:01:08] toy hunting
[1:01:09] if you have pay attention two hours
[1:01:11] could pass if you slip up
[1:01:13] whatever she was going for originally
[1:01:15] she added for that same thing
[1:01:17] because it in her heart and i say if it
[1:01:20] had to change somebody's mind
[1:01:23] you think if god make up his mind about
[1:01:25] something you can just come and swing
[1:01:26] around and do something to upset and
[1:01:28] change god's mind
[1:01:30] so job was saying you're spiritual fool
[1:01:34] because i realize it is a there's a will
[1:01:36] that's beyond my will it's a purpose and
[1:01:38] a plan beyond my plan here that's
[1:01:40] playing out that i'm not in control
[1:01:41] controller
[1:01:42] you can't pull me down to that level
[1:01:45] that's a powerful construct so i want to
[1:01:47] make sure it's cleared
[1:01:48] of you speak like a foolish woman it is
[1:01:51] not full as in moronic
[1:01:52] or idiotic or lack of knowledge no it is
[1:01:55] spiritual fool
[1:01:58] who doesn't realize that there's a
[1:02:00] bigger plan and purpose and
[1:02:02] god has something he wants to achieve to
[1:02:05] show
[1:02:05] to demonstrate to prove out of these
[1:02:09] different experiences that we go through
[1:02:11] can the church say amen
[1:02:15] definitely a part two still in chapter
[1:02:18] two
[1:02:20] what and and and job qualifies what he's
[1:02:22] talking about he said what shall we
[1:02:23] receive
[1:02:24] good at the hand of god and shall we not
[1:02:26] receive evil
[1:02:27] this word evil here in english in the
[1:02:29] king james is not the evil we think it
[1:02:31] is
[1:02:32] in the amplified it says shall we indeed
[1:02:34] accept only good from god
[1:02:36] and not also accept adversity and
[1:02:39] disaster
[1:02:40] in other words could it not be possible
[1:02:44] that god carried me through
[1:02:46] different journeys to bring out what he
[1:02:49] wants out of me
[1:02:50] this is what job is saying to his wife
[1:02:53] there's nothing in the contractual
[1:02:55] relationship between god
[1:02:57] and each of us that says it's a bed of
[1:02:59] roses
[1:03:01] we serve at his pleasure
[1:03:05] his least desire is my command
[1:03:08] anybody with me tonight are there any
[1:03:10] christians in the house any
[1:03:12] believers in the house tonight
[1:03:15] in all this did not job sin with his
[1:03:18] lips
[1:03:19] all right we're moving we're moving
[1:03:20] we're moving verse 11. now this is where
[1:03:23] the drama this is the answering in of
[1:03:26] the whole so chapter one was was stage
[1:03:29] one this is stage two in
[1:03:31] this eleventh verse here starts the
[1:03:34] whole of stage
[1:03:35] opens the door into stage three which is
[1:03:38] from
[1:03:38] like chapter three all the way up to
[1:03:40] chapter 37.
[1:03:42] now when job's three friends don't we
[1:03:45] love having friends
[1:03:46] anybody enjoys good strong friendships
[1:03:49] when job's three friends this is where
[1:03:53] so far so i've been using certain
[1:03:55] keywords so that we could kind of
[1:03:57] remember this teaching
[1:03:59] lost pain betrayal family wealth and
[1:04:02] health
[1:04:04] so far we have touched on family we have
[1:04:06] touched on wealth we have touched on
[1:04:08] health we have touched on loss we have
[1:04:09] touched on pain
[1:04:11] now we get into the betrayal part and
[1:04:13] the betrayal part
[1:04:15] takes up almost the largest portion of
[1:04:16] the study i'm not going to go too deep
[1:04:18] into it because we don't have time and
[1:04:19] i'm still trying to see by the grace of
[1:04:21] god i could finish
[1:04:22] but here it is jobs three friends
[1:04:26] we are not allowed to add to the word or
[1:04:28] take away from the word
[1:04:29] but if a context i could put two you
[1:04:32] know those quotation marks
[1:04:33] around that word friends because by the
[1:04:36] time you uncover
[1:04:37] these friends you will wonder what a
[1:04:40] genuine friend really is
[1:04:42] now when job's three friends heard of
[1:04:45] all this evil
[1:04:46] that was come upon him there came
[1:04:50] everyone from his own place
[1:04:53] the temer knight and bildad the shoe
[1:04:57] height
[1:04:58] and sofa the nama tight for they had
[1:05:01] made an appointment together and fellas
[1:05:03] pick up their phones
[1:05:05] what's up one another former whatsapp
[1:05:07] group and say listen
[1:05:08] job in trouble ollie here olay here the
[1:05:11] man i boiled
[1:05:12] house bun dong animal gone through a
[1:05:15] disaster
[1:05:16] i never said my life the man was the
[1:05:19] greatest of all time
[1:05:20] he was only cover-up forbes now forbes
[1:05:22] we want to talk to him
[1:05:26] they made an appointment together to
[1:05:29] come to mourn with him
[1:05:31] come and sing the sad story with him and
[1:05:33] to comfort him
[1:05:35] and when they lifted up their eyes are
[1:05:37] far off and knew him not
[1:05:39] they lifted up their voice and whipped
[1:05:42] that's a real sound they did
[1:05:44] they went and seen his had a cry and
[1:05:46] they ran everyone his
[1:05:48] mantle and sprinkled dust upon their
[1:05:49] heads towards heaven
[1:05:51] so they sat down with him upon the
[1:05:53] ground
[1:05:54] no i have to give them credit this is
[1:05:56] friendship i don't know
[1:05:58] but mike i know so much friends i have
[1:06:00] who would do this
[1:06:01] they sat down with him upon the ground
[1:06:03] seven days
[1:06:04] and seven nights and none speak a word
[1:06:08] unto him
[1:06:08] for they saw that his grief was very
[1:06:10] great so i don't doubt the fact that
[1:06:13] they were friends eh
[1:06:14] then fellas sit on seven days and seven
[1:06:16] nights say listen
[1:06:19] i have nothing to say no i just i just
[1:06:20] hear with you that is real and sometimes
[1:06:24] some of us that's what we needed yes sir
[1:06:26] just to know there's somebody there
[1:06:29] so chapter two ends with job
[1:06:33] not being alone his wife is upset with
[1:06:35] him so she's not in the picture
[1:06:37] children have gone on we will read i
[1:06:40] don't even get it but later in the
[1:06:41] scripture
[1:06:42] job say he called him 77 here come
[1:06:47] joe when you read this thing it's too
[1:06:49] much to get to tonight
[1:06:51] jose it's so horrible he said man who he
[1:06:53] wouldn't even put
[1:06:54] to guard his sheep looking at him for me
[1:06:59] job is there in isolation joe is there
[1:07:03] with nobody and he still has these three
[1:07:05] men
[1:07:06] these three friends these three brothers
[1:07:09] these three call it believers
[1:07:11] however you want to put it who at the
[1:07:13] very least
[1:07:14] they are friends enough to sit with job
[1:07:18] not for 15 minutes well i hear well here
[1:07:20] let's not go on it i have something else
[1:07:22] to do
[1:07:22] i just wanted to pass by and let you
[1:07:24] know that i heard what happened i come
[1:07:27] to
[1:07:27] you know just kind of tarry with you a
[1:07:28] little bit um
[1:07:30] you know if you need to call somebody i
[1:07:32] here for you no this was not that
[1:07:35] seven days adrian seven nights
[1:07:38] they sat next to job no words being
[1:07:41] spoken
[1:07:42] just to show solidarity with job
[1:07:45] we here with you that is remarkable
[1:07:49] that is notable i don't know if this
[1:07:51] have friends left in this day and age
[1:07:52] anymore i really i
[1:07:54] i'm not sure but seven days seven is a
[1:07:56] long time i didn't want it to
[1:07:57] sink in in the context so let's move on
[1:08:01] after this so after the seven day period
[1:08:04] the conversation
[1:08:05] starts and between job three
[1:08:09] and job 37 the entire discourse
[1:08:14] between job 3 and job 37 for the most
[1:08:18] part
[1:08:18] except for the intervention of elohu is
[1:08:22] this dialogue firstly that starts with
[1:08:25] jobs for a lack of a better word
[1:08:28] his frustration being expressed and then
[1:08:31] each of these three brothers
[1:08:33] trying to help job see what's wrong with
[1:08:35] him and job having to respond
[1:08:38] to what he would perceive their
[1:08:39] foolishness all right so
[1:08:41] job so i'm gonna try to take us to a
[1:08:43] little bit of it because
[1:08:44] if we take this word by verse we'll be
[1:08:46] here for the next three months of
[1:08:48] lockdown
[1:08:49] um we
[1:08:52] and to get to these subsidiary closing
[1:08:54] pathways right so
[1:08:56] chapter three starts with job so i want
[1:08:59] you to picture it
[1:09:00] job is there seven days quiet
[1:09:03] no talk some of us can sit still for
[1:09:07] hour
[1:09:09] some of us can't sit still for a day
[1:09:11] without opening our mouth
[1:09:14] god help us some of us to death to our
[1:09:17] fast food
[1:09:18] you know fasting and praying like you
[1:09:20] could do a quiet fascination just stay
[1:09:22] silent and
[1:09:22] listen to these still small voice this
[1:09:24] is not one day two days so after seven
[1:09:26] days
[1:09:27] we don't know what is now bubbling in
[1:09:30] job's mind and heart
[1:09:32] he's not talking the brother is not
[1:09:33] talking it's just silence and then
[1:09:35] joe breaks the silence and job breaks
[1:09:38] the silence with
[1:09:39] a burst of frustration that is almost
[1:09:41] uncharacteristic
[1:09:43] but you know what i love about this i
[1:09:45] love the honesty
[1:09:47] of what i call the human condition
[1:09:50] and the reality that under pressure
[1:09:53] under pressure and we see it even in the
[1:09:55] life of the prophet
[1:09:57] the prophet reached a point where he
[1:09:58] said he wished he was dead
[1:10:00] because depression was too much in fact
[1:10:02] it was not just a thought
[1:10:04] he tried to take his life so the reality
[1:10:07] is situation sometimes can get the
[1:10:09] better of us
[1:10:10] and we have to thank god for his grace
[1:10:12] because in the case of the prophet
[1:10:14] if god didn't stop the gun is a
[1:10:16] different story
[1:10:17] so god had to intervene when we lose
[1:10:21] sight of the north star
[1:10:22] or the anchor or the pivot that holds us
[1:10:25] when we feel sometimes so overwhelmed
[1:10:27] we may not see a way out anybody with me
[1:10:30] tonight but all of this in scripture is
[1:10:33] to give us context
[1:10:35] and to give us advice and solace and
[1:10:37] comfort that life is real
[1:10:39] the struggle is real and lost spin and
[1:10:41] betrayal is also real
[1:10:44] so here a few words of job after his
[1:10:47] seven hours
[1:10:48] is seven days rather of silence after
[1:10:51] this
[1:10:51] job open his mouth and curse his day
[1:10:54] curses day
[1:10:55] is not this is like saying he curses
[1:10:57] birdie
[1:10:59] i regretta was born and job speak and
[1:11:01] said
[1:11:02] let the day perish wherein i was born in
[1:11:05] other words
[1:11:05] he said but i wish i was never born yes
[1:11:07] in other words if i wasn't born
[1:11:09] i would not have have met my wife and
[1:11:11] had these children
[1:11:12] and could lose these children if i
[1:11:14] wasn't born i wouldn't have a business
[1:11:16] and open a business and lose the
[1:11:18] business if i would
[1:11:19] so job is saying let me do paris when i
[1:11:21] was born
[1:11:23] he goes but i can't even earlier than
[1:11:26] his but
[1:11:27] he said on the night in which it was
[1:11:29] said there's a child conceived he said
[1:11:31] chris the day of conception
[1:11:34] job is the expression of job is like a
[1:11:36] poet
[1:11:37] so his writing is like the height job is
[1:11:40] at
[1:11:40] he said forgetting our born curse the
[1:11:43] day i was conceived
[1:11:44] let that day be darkness let not god
[1:11:47] regard it from above in other words
[1:11:49] wipe that day off the record that is
[1:11:52] that is not depression oh gosh i'm
[1:11:54] feeling dumb no he said because the day
[1:11:55] i was born
[1:11:56] because i was conceived let not god
[1:11:58] regard it neither let the light shine
[1:12:00] upon it
[1:12:01] let darkness and the shadow of death
[1:12:02] stain it let a cloud dwell upon it let
[1:12:05] me blatantly
[1:12:06] terrify it and he goes oh no no no no no
[1:12:09] no no no no no the whole chapter is
[1:12:12] about him
[1:12:13] ranting about wishing things were
[1:12:15] different
[1:12:16] i want to sum it up like that just
[1:12:18] wishing things could be different
[1:12:21] or wishing there was an undo button you
[1:12:24] know for those of us who use
[1:12:25] word and excel and these things we have
[1:12:27] gotten used to the undo button
[1:12:29] you make a mistake hit undo and
[1:12:31] miraculously
[1:12:33] what you're messed up get fixed back and
[1:12:36] there's a sigh of relief
[1:12:37] that you don't have to do over what you
[1:12:39] did before
[1:12:41] boy i wish life had an undo button
[1:12:44] you know much time i wish life had an
[1:12:45] undo button
[1:12:47] but god never gave us an undo button
[1:12:50] decisions have consequences and we have
[1:12:52] learnt as policy in whatever situation
[1:12:57] to be able to give thanks and to trust
[1:12:59] god that all things work together for
[1:13:00] good
[1:13:02] anybody with me so we went through one
[1:13:05] we went through two
[1:13:07] we will sum up three for simplicity as
[1:13:09] job's frustration coming out
[1:13:12] cursing the day he was born but
[1:13:14] ultimately it's him coming to terms with
[1:13:16] his
[1:13:16] it is almost as if the reality of his
[1:13:19] pain has now set in
[1:13:21] and it has now taken a grip of what he
[1:13:24] has lost
[1:13:26] and the gravity of his pain is real they
[1:13:28] did say it at the end of chapter two
[1:13:31] for they saw that his grief was very
[1:13:33] great
[1:13:35] he didn't get time to explain it express
[1:13:37] it so his first expression
[1:13:39] was as most people would when in reality
[1:13:41] sits in
[1:13:42] oh i wish things were different by the
[1:13:46] time we read job 4
[1:13:47] and i'm going to try to browse through
[1:13:48] many of these things before his brother
[1:13:50] good brother eliphaz begins to speak
[1:13:55] he starts off nice he say if
[1:13:58] we are sata community in other words if
[1:14:00] we dare to talk with you will you be
[1:14:02] aggrieved so you're trying to approach
[1:14:03] it nice you know
[1:14:04] could we have a word with you but who
[1:14:06] can withhold and separate speaking
[1:14:07] behold that has
[1:14:08] instructed many so he trying to kind of
[1:14:11] warm up job
[1:14:12] you who instruct many thou have
[1:14:14] strengthened the weak hands
[1:14:16] thy words have upholded them that was
[1:14:18] fallen though has strengthened the
[1:14:20] feeble knees
[1:14:21] but but now it is come upon thee and
[1:14:23] though fientists
[1:14:24] so the brothers sign their best to
[1:14:26] encourage job they say listen
[1:14:28] you encouraged brendan before you has
[1:14:30] been the one
[1:14:31] when people don't you lift them up now
[1:14:33] look at you tooting it here and you curl
[1:14:35] up in the fetal position
[1:14:36] they say come on joe come on joe come on
[1:14:38] job they said now we come upon the
[1:14:40] undocumented
[1:14:42] it touches thee and our trouble is not
[1:14:44] this that i fear that confidence
[1:14:46] thy hope and the uprightness of thy ways
[1:14:50] i know elephants good by the elephants
[1:14:52] are to slip in something there
[1:14:54] he say remember i pray whoever perished
[1:14:57] being innocent
[1:14:58] in other words as far as i know people
[1:15:00] who perish something wrong with them you
[1:15:02] know
[1:15:03] or where was the righteous cut off so
[1:15:06] what you go into right now brother
[1:15:08] brother brother brother brother
[1:15:12] this thing you're going through verse 8
[1:15:15] even as i have seen from my little
[1:15:16] experience i'm not no big senior
[1:15:18] minister or anything but from what i
[1:15:19] have seen
[1:15:20] they don't plow iniquity and so
[1:15:23] wickedness really be seen
[1:15:26] so job tell me is us it's just us
[1:15:28] brothers here
[1:15:30] tell me what you did because
[1:15:34] you had a testimony clearly something
[1:15:36] happened between the last time i was at
[1:15:38] the convention and now i've seen you in
[1:15:40] this condition
[1:15:41] it is not the whole churches here just
[1:15:42] us three brothers share with me
[1:15:44] what you did what went wrong because
[1:15:47] these things would just happen just so
[1:15:48] it's a cause and effect
[1:15:49] what you saw is what you reap this is
[1:15:52] brother elifa is trying to
[1:15:53] this is supposed to be so this is where
[1:15:56] now we're coming with
[1:15:57] with what i call the betrayal part
[1:15:59] because we will understand
[1:16:00] from and it is almost and it is clear
[1:16:03] because
[1:16:04] chapter 4 has no knowledge of what
[1:16:06] chapter one and two has with what is
[1:16:08] happening
[1:16:08] between god and satan and god's own
[1:16:12] declaration about the righteousness of
[1:16:14] job
[1:16:15] so these spiritual brothers who quote in
[1:16:17] scripture because they caught anywhere
[1:16:19] they are coming from lefino by the blast
[1:16:22] of god they perish
[1:16:23] there's a quote and by the breadth of
[1:16:26] his nostrils they continue i read it
[1:16:27] then let us bring in scripture and
[1:16:29] revelation and word i'm thinking of
[1:16:31] the show job job hear level up now
[1:16:34] you know if there's unconfession
[1:16:38] whatever it is if there was ever a
[1:16:40] service to make it right
[1:16:41] is this service here right now because
[1:16:43] if we make it right we could have undo
[1:16:45] this
[1:16:46] anybody with me that whole chapter
[1:16:49] chapter four i'm gonna skip it
[1:16:51] chapter five all of that was elephants
[1:16:53] trying to get to the root
[1:16:55] of job's problem
[1:16:58] by six jobma was responding to the whole
[1:17:02] speech from elephants but job answered
[1:17:05] so this is it so a lot of people who
[1:17:06] don't study job job is a cadence
[1:17:09] between the brothers speaking the job
[1:17:11] and job responding that's the pattern of
[1:17:13] the unfolding of the book of job
[1:17:15] the brothers sit there they analyze they
[1:17:17] speak and then job responds but job
[1:17:18] answered so he's answering this brother
[1:17:20] and said oh that my grief was thoroughly
[1:17:23] weighed in other words
[1:17:24] you're not weighing it properly and my
[1:17:27] calamity laid in a balance together
[1:17:30] for no it would be heavier than the
[1:17:31] sound of the sea
[1:17:33] and and he goes on by verse 8
[1:17:36] oh that i might have my request and that
[1:17:40] god would grant me the thing that i long
[1:17:42] for so
[1:17:42] job has a desire in his heart he is
[1:17:44] going beyond the words of elizabeth he's
[1:17:46] saying all he brought is not
[1:17:47] understanding
[1:17:49] job is standing up for his testimony
[1:17:52] even that it would please god to destroy
[1:17:54] me that he would let loose his head and
[1:17:56] cut me off
[1:17:57] then should i yet have comfort
[1:18:01] so job is going on and i can't get into
[1:18:03] all of it tonight but i want it as build
[1:18:05] and job has this long response then by
[1:18:07] the time you reach job chapter eight
[1:18:09] you have bilder other brother no he
[1:18:12] taken a different approach
[1:18:14] he listened to elipha's speech he
[1:18:16] listened to job response
[1:18:18] and he now seen well i hear elephants i
[1:18:21] get through so let me try this thing
[1:18:22] then answered bilal we in job 8 verse 1
[1:18:25] then answered bella deshawn and said how
[1:18:27] long will thou speak these things
[1:18:29] how long shall the word of their mouth
[1:18:31] be like a strong wind that god preferred
[1:18:33] judgment in other words he taken a
[1:18:35] different approach to get to the same
[1:18:36] point
[1:18:37] job there's something wrong with your
[1:18:39] life you did give this whole response to
[1:18:41] elephants and you're not coming clean
[1:18:42] with us
[1:18:43] you're not being honest with us what is
[1:18:45] it that's wrong
[1:18:48] all right so i want to skip through this
[1:18:50] again because
[1:18:51] i really want to get to a deeper
[1:18:53] response
[1:18:54] job 9 and job answer him and said i know
[1:18:58] it is sort of the truth
[1:18:59] but how should a man be just with god if
[1:19:01] he will contend with him
[1:19:03] he cannot answer him and job is not
[1:19:04] responding again to
[1:19:06] what that brother said all right so i
[1:19:08] want to skip now now
[1:19:10] zofa the other brother now then answered
[1:19:12] zofa this is job 11
[1:19:14] verse one we're moving a little quickly
[1:19:15] now
[1:19:17] we may have to do another study on this
[1:19:19] i try but
[1:19:20] the time the time then answered so far
[1:19:22] and number ten said should not the
[1:19:24] multitude of words be answered in other
[1:19:26] words all them brothers asking a thing
[1:19:28] and they keep skirting they keep bobbing
[1:19:29] and they keep weaving and should a man
[1:19:31] full of talk be justified
[1:19:32] they say job you're talking and talking
[1:19:34] but you're not coming clean basically
[1:19:36] with what is secret sinners
[1:19:37] and brother brahman preaching they say
[1:19:39] they keep accusing him of being a secret
[1:19:41] sinner and that was not the case should
[1:19:44] thy lies make men hold their peace
[1:19:46] they are accused of lying
[1:19:50] and when don't make sure no man made me
[1:19:52] ashamed for thou has said my doctrine is
[1:19:54] pure
[1:19:55] i hope job says my doctor is pure and i
[1:19:57] am clean in thine eyes
[1:19:58] but all that god would speak and open
[1:20:00] his lips against thee he said the call
[1:20:02] for judgment
[1:20:04] and that he would show thee the secrets
[1:20:05] of wisdom that are double to that which
[1:20:08] is
[1:20:08] no dear for that god exactly less than
[1:20:11] that iniquity
[1:20:12] deserved in other words they say the
[1:20:15] judgment you get
[1:20:16] is less that you really should be
[1:20:18] getting you see what about betrayal
[1:20:21] this is brothers brother thompson come
[1:20:23] to encourage him you know
[1:20:26] job 11 verse 6 said no therefore that
[1:20:29] god
[1:20:30] they know speaking for god no therefore
[1:20:33] and when i read i recognize how much
[1:20:35] people have been talking for god without
[1:20:36] permission you know
[1:20:38] they telling job know therefore that god
[1:20:41] exactly of thee less than that iniquity
[1:20:45] deserve it in other words
[1:20:46] what are you going through god should
[1:20:48] have beat you more he said i punish you
[1:20:50] more
[1:20:52] they have no clue that this is god
[1:20:55] boasting about job
[1:20:58] you see why it's important to know who
[1:20:59] given your advice
[1:21:02] and who encouraging you
[1:21:05] and who your real friends are could we
[1:21:08] take a little more
[1:21:09] because i want to kind of i want to i
[1:21:11] want to progress here
[1:21:14] so i want to kind of move on a little
[1:21:15] bit and then job
[1:21:17] replied in verse 12 and job answered and
[1:21:19] said no doubt but he had a people and
[1:21:21] wisdom
[1:21:24] job gets so frustrated with him in job
[1:21:26] 12 verse one and job anthony said no
[1:21:28] doubt
[1:21:28] but ye are the people and wisdom will
[1:21:31] die with you in other words you're
[1:21:32] saying all you're so wise by type all
[1:21:34] your god
[1:21:34] nobody that's all that wisdom meaning
[1:21:36] already wisest wizard will die with all
[1:21:38] you
[1:21:38] only have all the answers all you know
[1:21:40] what wrong with with me this is
[1:21:41] this is job in his ash heap
[1:21:44] not letting him fellas move his feet his
[1:21:47] position his conviction huh
[1:21:49] listen to job in verse 3 i am not
[1:21:51] inferior to you
[1:21:54] in other words those brothers how they
[1:21:56] were communicating the job
[1:21:58] started to make joe begin to push back
[1:22:00] and say listen
[1:22:01] don't look at my condition as inferior
[1:22:04] to you you know
[1:22:05] i am not inferior to you don't judge me
[1:22:08] by my circumstances anybody catching
[1:22:11] this
[1:22:13] when you see the magnitude of this
[1:22:15] because god deals with us as individuals
[1:22:20] this is this is some serious and this
[1:22:23] message has been
[1:22:24] plagued with casting fear and judgment
[1:22:27] by people who have no choice you just
[1:22:29] speak for god and we'll see how god
[1:22:30] deals with it by the time you reach the
[1:22:32] verse 38
[1:22:33] it's so and so if you judgment and and
[1:22:35] and cut off continuity
[1:22:37] [Music]
[1:22:39] all the time but this is the context
[1:22:41] people take authority upon themselves
[1:22:43] they say well you lose that because you
[1:22:45] do and so and so and because you leave
[1:22:47] the inspiration or because i believe
[1:22:49] anyway he preach it
[1:22:50] and that kind of foolishness
[1:22:53] and they have all of the explanation and
[1:22:55] they put in god in the mix as well
[1:22:57] and job is forced to respond to each one
[1:23:01] of these things
[1:23:04] and every and if we go on and this whole
[1:23:06] book of job and you need to read it we
[1:23:08] can have a deeper study of it again
[1:23:10] and then after that third brother speak
[1:23:12] the first one time i speak again so by
[1:23:13] the time we reach joe 15
[1:23:15] ellie first take back the microphone
[1:23:16] again
[1:23:18] to try a different approach then
[1:23:20] answered elephants in joke 15
[1:23:23] should a wise man utter vain knowledge
[1:23:26] so and fill his belly with the east wind
[1:23:28] should he reason with unprofitable talk
[1:23:30] so they're saying listen we we wasting
[1:23:32] time here because you again will be
[1:23:34] saying
[1:23:34] oh it's speeches where what he can do no
[1:23:36] good yeah though cast it off fear and
[1:23:38] restraint and spare before god
[1:23:40] in other words you operating they
[1:23:42] telling job you operating
[1:23:43] like you have no fear because you know
[1:23:45] something wrong with you
[1:23:48] this turns on its head things people say
[1:23:50] to you
[1:23:51] you know
[1:23:56] i'm trying to get and i have to skip a
[1:23:57] lot of these things i might have to call
[1:23:59] you but i want to really get
[1:24:00] because i have to touch on elohu but i
[1:24:02] can't touch it today but i want to kind
[1:24:04] of can i have to bring this back
[1:24:06] but i want to get now to
[1:24:09] to verse 38 because i want to at least
[1:24:12] bring some clue to
[1:24:13] this teaching here so between verse
[1:24:17] or chapter 3 and chapter 37 you have
[1:24:19] these
[1:24:20] three brothers going back and forth with
[1:24:21] the response and then you have
[1:24:23] elohu who is this mystery young man who
[1:24:26] comes out of nowhere
[1:24:28] who comes and when abandoned types him
[1:24:30] out as a representative of god
[1:24:32] with a beautiful but adult trying to get
[1:24:34] in there they want to leave you with his
[1:24:35] hope out of it here
[1:24:37] so ella who comes and ministers to job
[1:24:40] probes job a little bit a little
[1:24:42] different
[1:24:44] and then for the first time between
[1:24:48] chapters 3 and chapter 37 for the first
[1:24:51] time in chapter 38
[1:24:52] god appears all along as this dialogue
[1:24:56] is going on between
[1:24:57] job and these friends and these brothers
[1:24:59] job has some questions coming
[1:25:02] job would have asked questions such as
[1:25:04] if i could get to god if i could
[1:25:05] get clarity if i could get answers i
[1:25:07] want to know why i want to because job
[1:25:10] wants to understand he knows there's a
[1:25:12] bigger purpose but you want to
[1:25:13] understand and he want god he said i
[1:25:15] wish i could talk to god i wish god
[1:25:16] could give me answers
[1:25:18] that's the theme that was good and many
[1:25:20] times that's what goes on with us
[1:25:22] we want god to show us why
[1:25:25] i want this to resonate one of the
[1:25:27] biggest challenges we have as believers
[1:25:30] is trying
[1:25:31] to get to understand the why of things
[1:25:35] we want to know why god did it this way
[1:25:38] or why he didn't do it this way
[1:25:40] and ultimately what it leads to is a
[1:25:43] questioning of god
[1:25:45] so job did not curse god
[1:25:49] but as this story was unfolding what was
[1:25:52] happening joe was
[1:25:54] questioning what was happening to him
[1:25:59] and if his one lesson i want us to leave
[1:26:01] with tonight
[1:26:03] is to not question god because
[1:26:06] one of his questions was where is god
[1:26:11] where is god in this situation that was
[1:26:13] one of job's questions
[1:26:15] i'm going through this thing and where's
[1:26:18] god why
[1:26:19] job cried he said i cried to god and
[1:26:21] there's no answer
[1:26:23] we didn't read it but it's there i cry
[1:26:25] to god but there's no answer
[1:26:27] where is he why is he not answering me
[1:26:31] i'm going through loss i go into pain
[1:26:34] are feeling betrayed the friends who
[1:26:37] supports from your friends
[1:26:38] accusing me of things that i know is not
[1:26:40] true and god
[1:26:42] somehow seems to be silent anybody with
[1:26:45] me
[1:26:47] in the midst of my darkest moment having
[1:26:50] lost
[1:26:50] family having lost wealth having lost
[1:26:53] health having endured
[1:26:55] loss having lost pain having endured
[1:26:57] betrayal
[1:26:58] and looking for answers and asking to
[1:27:01] find it
[1:27:04] god give me an explanation tonight help
[1:27:06] me to understand
[1:27:08] that was job's condition his state as
[1:27:11] this whole thing is unfolding
[1:27:13] he is looking for answers
[1:27:16] to his questions
[1:27:21] and then we come to verse 38 and if you
[1:27:24] have a bible to go there with me
[1:27:27] job has questions he has answers
[1:27:30] and god comes down in verse 38
[1:27:33] in chapter 38 verse 1 and listen to
[1:27:36] the response
[1:27:40] and it's as if god says you have
[1:27:42] questions
[1:27:43] let me compare your questions
[1:27:47] with the questions that i have to deal
[1:27:48] with so listen to god's response
[1:27:51] to job's questions
[1:27:54] then the lord answered job out of the
[1:27:56] whirlwind and said
[1:27:58] in other words let me ask you a question
[1:28:00] this is
[1:28:01] god's answer is a question i want this
[1:28:04] to see that
[1:28:05] god's answer is a question and his first
[1:28:08] question
[1:28:09] deals with those brothers who is this
[1:28:13] that darken it counsel by words without
[1:28:16] knowledge
[1:28:18] this itself is a message to preach the
[1:28:21] darkening of
[1:28:22] counsel by words without knowledge in
[1:28:24] other words those brothers speaking
[1:28:26] without knowledge
[1:28:30] he said who is it that darknet counsel
[1:28:34] without knowledge gird up your lawyers
[1:28:37] like a man
[1:28:38] for i will demand of thee and answer
[1:28:40] thou me
[1:28:41] so god comes down and instead of
[1:28:44] answering
[1:28:44] joe's job's questions he said listen i
[1:28:48] come down i'm not here to answer
[1:28:50] your questions i want you to gird your
[1:28:52] loins stand up like a man
[1:28:54] and answer my questions you have

[1:32:42] verse 25 who had divided a watercourse
[1:32:45] for the overflowing of waters

[1:32:51] and what god is doing is showing job job
[1:32:53] listen
[1:32:54] your thing you talking about and going
[1:32:56] through and you're arguing about this
[1:32:57] and fighting about this
[1:32:59] hear this i have come down now and i'll
[1:33:02] let you know
[1:33:03] that there's a way bigger world than
[1:33:05] your world
[1:33:06] there's a bigger plan and purpose than
[1:33:08] your plan there's a bigger
[1:33:10] mystery about who you are and who i am
[1:33:12] and you don't even understand
[1:33:13] all right let us try to kind of and it
[1:33:15] goes on i can't get into all of it now
[1:33:17] we're trying to bring another conclusion
[1:33:18] here job 40.
[1:33:21] let's go to job 40 verse 3
[1:33:26] is where job has a little response this
[1:33:28] is the first time from since job 28
[1:33:30] that's the first time i believe job even
[1:33:32] get a word in
[1:33:34] because god was talking the entire time
[1:33:35] to him
[1:33:37] and job it says job three job 40 was she
[1:33:41] then job answered the lord and said
[1:33:42] behold
[1:33:43] i am vile what shall i answer thee job
[1:33:46] saying i have no answer
[1:33:48] i will lay my hand upon my mouth lord
[1:33:51] jesus help me
[1:33:52] job say i will cover my mouth because i
[1:33:54] recognize i i shouldn't even be talking
[1:33:57] once have i spoken but i will not answer
[1:34:00] yet twice but i will proceed no further
[1:34:02] job saying listen that's all they gonna
[1:34:04] do either i'm now recognized but please
[1:34:06] you know because here's what i want you
[1:34:08] to get church
[1:34:10] before this point this is the teaching
[1:34:12] if you get
[1:34:13] anything at all get this before this
[1:34:15] point job
[1:34:16] thought he had the liberty to question
[1:34:18] god any way he wanted
[1:34:23] job i want you to catch us again job
[1:34:25] thought
[1:34:26] he had the right the authority the
[1:34:29] permission
[1:34:30] the privilege to question god's plans
[1:34:33] his purpose and what god was doing and
[1:34:36] god is showing him you cannot question
[1:34:38] me
[1:34:40] you i have not given you the authority
[1:34:42] to question me
[1:34:44] it is not your place you don't have the
[1:34:46] rank
[1:34:48] when you can measure the foundation and
[1:34:50] close the door on the sea
[1:34:52] come back to me and ask me why i'm doing
[1:34:54] what i'm doing around your life
[1:34:56] i want you to catch that tonight church
[1:34:59] god spent questionable questions saying
[1:35:01] when you could pull stars into place
[1:35:03] when you could do that then you could
[1:35:05] start to ask me why i do what i do
[1:35:07] oh god help me tonight
[1:35:12] that's powerful enough
[1:35:17] now let's say the brains are closed
[1:35:20] so when job responded like that
[1:35:26] verse six then answered the lord unto
[1:35:29] job out of the whirlwind and said in
[1:35:31] other words
[1:35:34] god started to to to to to respond to
[1:35:38] joe based on job's response now
[1:35:40] then i told him to joke girl up there
[1:35:41] don't like a man i will demand of thee
[1:35:44] and declare thou unto me with thou also
[1:35:47] disall my judgment will thou
[1:35:51] condemn me that thou mayest be righteous
[1:35:53] in other words would you blame me so
[1:35:55] that you would look good
[1:35:59] verse 9 has that one arm like god or
[1:36:02] cans though thunder with a voice like
[1:36:03] him
[1:36:04] in other words god is telling job i hear
[1:36:06] any hero but i want you to know your
[1:36:08] place
[1:36:13] this is powerful powerful powerful
[1:36:15] powerful powerful
[1:36:18] people walk around are not understanding
[1:36:21] is a
[1:36:21] it's a mighty god and take the liberty
[1:36:25] to put things in their mouth and
[1:36:26] speak that they have no
[1:36:29] right listen let us walk carefully you
[1:36:32] know
[1:36:33] this would change while you speak even
[1:36:35] when they're in your
[1:36:36] sheep i want you to get this clear
[1:36:39] because job was
[1:36:40] in he had a reason to be frustrated
[1:36:44] he had a reason to be depressed and god
[1:36:46] was saying even
[1:36:47] that situation doesn't give you right to
[1:36:50] say certain things
[1:36:52] verse 10 deck thyself no with majesty
[1:36:56] and excellency in other words
[1:36:57] come up higher the clothes he was
[1:37:01] wearing
[1:37:02] yes you went to a loss yes you went
[1:37:04] through pain yes you went through
[1:37:05] betrayal but verse 10
[1:37:07] deck thyself no with majesty and
[1:37:09] excellency in other words
[1:37:11] you could do better than that array
[1:37:14] thyself with glory and beauty
[1:37:16] you see why i challenge you lift your
[1:37:18] head up depression is not your
[1:37:20] portion frustration not abortion cast
[1:37:22] abroad the rage of thyroid in other
[1:37:24] words
[1:37:24] the anger you have inside about what
[1:37:27] didn't work out get rid of it
[1:37:29] you see how god talking to job
[1:37:36] i'm almost done yeah yeah
[1:37:39] yeah let's let's close out this this
[1:37:41] thing so god speaks there and it goes on
[1:37:44] and i will close out with this last
[1:37:45] chapter of job and we may go deeper some
[1:37:47] other time but
[1:37:48] i still want to get this to drive home
[1:37:50] his message jobs reply
[1:37:51] verse job 42 one then job
[1:37:55] answered the lord and said i know
[1:37:58] oh god help me that dog can't do
[1:38:00] everything
[1:38:02] this was the first time now so what we
[1:38:05] see here now
[1:38:06] is the job of 1-1 the upright job
[1:38:11] had some issues that we didn't see
[1:38:15] that god was actually working out that
[1:38:17] was bringing job to a point
[1:38:20] that he could reach this point so
[1:38:24] god i preached it before has the ability
[1:38:25] to operate simultaneously on different
[1:38:27] levels
[1:38:28] so while god is boasting about job to
[1:38:30] the devil god also knows
[1:38:32] that as upright as job is there are
[1:38:34] little issues he wants to correct in
[1:38:36] job's life
[1:38:37] before dropping too highly of himself
[1:38:40] anybody anybody with me so here it comes
[1:38:43] to the point now of job's
[1:38:44] realization now i know that dog can't do
[1:38:48] everything
[1:38:49] and that no thought can be withholding
[1:38:51] from thee
[1:38:52] who is he that hideth counsel without
[1:38:54] knowledge
[1:38:56] therefore listen listen to this if you
[1:38:59] want to identify
[1:39:00] the sin of job because elohu said the
[1:39:04] same thing
[1:39:05] it may not be the sin that we consider
[1:39:07] sin but if
[1:39:09] to use your words and maybe a strong
[1:39:12] word but the
[1:39:12] issue if i could issue with job because
[1:39:14] i still have to lead the repentance is
[1:39:15] this here
[1:39:16] therefore have i uttered that i
[1:39:18] understood not
[1:39:20] things to wonderful me for me that which
[1:39:23] i knew not
[1:39:24] here i beseech thee and i will speak i
[1:39:26] will demand of thee and declare that i
[1:39:28] want to be i have heard of thee
[1:39:30] by the hearing of the ear so job is now
[1:39:33] acknowledging
[1:39:34] that his knowledge and his revelation of
[1:39:36] god was at a certain level
[1:39:38] i've heard of thee by the hearing of the
[1:39:40] year but no man i see a deep
[1:39:43] i know that i see the fullness of who
[1:39:45] you are
[1:39:46] know that i understand the gap between
[1:39:49] your glory and i
[1:39:50] listen this thing is if you catch this
[1:39:53] if you catch this it'll make you so
[1:39:56] careful
[1:39:57] wherefore look at what it brought job to
[1:40:01] i abhor myself
[1:40:04] it is like isaiah in the temple in the
[1:40:07] presence of god
[1:40:09] he was saying war they wanted you warned
[1:40:11] to you and when he came to the presence
[1:40:13] of god
[1:40:14] and saw himself in the light of the
[1:40:17] presence of god and he saw himself he
[1:40:20] said wait a minute wait a minute
[1:40:21] where is me job
[1:40:25] righteous upright job said wherefore i
[1:40:28] ab
[1:40:28] myself and repent
[1:40:32] there's no reason to repent if there's
[1:40:34] not something to fix or to change
[1:40:36] or to turn around so here it have
[1:40:40] job now coming to that point through his
[1:40:43] experience
[1:40:44] through his question and god pushing
[1:40:46] back questions to him
[1:40:48] job reached that point he said i've
[1:40:50] heard of thee by the hearing of the air
[1:40:52] i have utter things i didn't understand
[1:40:54] i spoke things that i had no
[1:40:55] understanding i
[1:40:56] already didn't know i thought i knew but
[1:40:59] i recognized no i didn't know
[1:41:01] just like those brothers who spoke they
[1:41:03] didn't know
[1:41:05] industrial ashes and we'll close out
[1:41:07] just reading this and we're done for
[1:41:09] tonight
[1:41:10] verse 7 and it was so
[1:41:13] that after the lord had spoken these
[1:41:16] words
[1:41:17] unto job the lord said to eliphaz
[1:41:20] the temenite first wonderful brother my
[1:41:23] wrath is kindled against thee
[1:41:25] and against thy two friends listen why
[1:41:27] listen to what it is
[1:41:29] which is why it is so careful friends
[1:41:31] remember the lord show me
[1:41:32] to tell you so and so i was reading a
[1:41:35] quote and a lord sent me to tell him so
[1:41:36] and so
[1:41:37] and i feel it's because so-and-so is
[1:41:38] white so and so you see that kind of
[1:41:40] foolishness
[1:41:41] my wrath is kindle against thee and
[1:41:43] against my two friends
[1:41:44] for ye have not spoken of me
[1:41:47] the thing that is right in other words
[1:41:50] you using me
[1:41:51] convenient to your agenda you have not
[1:41:54] spoken of me god is saying you haven't
[1:41:56] spoken of me as a lord
[1:41:59] the thing that is right as my servant
[1:42:02] job had
[1:42:03] so he's saying job came to the roo to
[1:42:05] say the right things about me
[1:42:08] this is serious you're saying therefore
[1:42:12] take unto you now seven bullocks and
[1:42:14] seven rams
[1:42:15] and i love gordon go to my servant job
[1:42:19] the same one who you say secret sinner
[1:42:22] go to my sibling job
[1:42:24] and offer up for yourselves a burnt
[1:42:26] offering and my servant job shall pray
[1:42:28] for you
[1:42:30] oh my for him will i accept in other
[1:42:32] words if he had prayed for you
[1:42:34] and not accepting it because i will
[1:42:36] accept job's prayer
[1:42:38] all your self-righteousness you trying
[1:42:40] to job's prayer will i accept
[1:42:44] is that wonderful oh my
[1:42:47] god man lest i deal with you after
[1:42:50] you're folly
[1:42:51] so god is saying i could deal with you
[1:42:53] you know but i've given you a chance
[1:42:55] carry them block something and go and
[1:42:56] let joe pray here because the
[1:42:58] alternative to that is i will deal with
[1:42:59] you after you're falling in other words
[1:43:01] call in my name and your mouth in a way
[1:43:04] that i didn't approve
[1:43:05] is fully and i could deal with you i
[1:43:08] should be with you i could be with you
[1:43:09] but because of job your job friend go to
[1:43:12] him and have him pray for you
[1:43:14] in that he have not spoken of me the
[1:43:16] thing which is right like my silver job
[1:43:18] so verse nine so elephants the temer
[1:43:20] knight and bildar the shoe height
[1:43:22] and so far the namatite went and did
[1:43:25] according as the lord commanded them
[1:43:28] the lord also accepted job and verse 10
[1:43:31] we're closing out here now
[1:43:33] everybody with me and the lord turned
[1:43:35] the captivity of job
[1:43:37] when he prayed for his friends
[1:43:41] so in other words that itself is
[1:43:42] powerful
[1:43:45] job's situation also changed when he
[1:43:48] prayed for his friends which means he
[1:43:49] not only had to be reconciled with god
[1:43:52] but he had to be reconciled with his
[1:43:53] friends
[1:43:54] the same ones who betrayed him oh my
[1:43:56] listen
[1:43:57] i could leave this here oh
[1:44:00] my oh hallelujah i don't know if you
[1:44:04] catch that as much as i catch that
[1:44:06] because some of us would say when i
[1:44:08] talked to god and he showed me what it
[1:44:09] wasn't technically them
[1:44:10] three worthless brothers if i could just
[1:44:12] give i could never for these chocolates
[1:44:13] they tell me when i was dumb
[1:44:14] no no no his captivity was
[1:44:18] turned when he prayed for them you can't
[1:44:21] pray for somebody really pray for
[1:44:22] somebody if it's not in your heart
[1:44:25] and god will accept the prayer is not
[1:44:27] real oh
[1:44:29] my so verse 10 and the lord turn the
[1:44:32] captivity of job so
[1:44:34] job would have overcome his loss job
[1:44:36] overcame his pain
[1:44:37] job overcame his betrayal
[1:44:42] when he prayed for his friends also the
[1:44:43] lord gave job twice as much as he had
[1:44:46] before
[1:44:48] then came there unto him all his
[1:44:49] brethren and all his sisters
[1:44:52] and all they that had been of his
[1:44:53] acquaintance before and did eat bread
[1:44:56] with him in his house
[1:44:57] and they bemoan him and comforted him
[1:45:00] over all the evil that the lord had
[1:45:01] brought upon him
[1:45:02] every man also gave him a piece of money
[1:45:04] and everyone and earring of gold
[1:45:06] so the lord blessed the latter end of
[1:45:08] job
[1:45:09] more than his beginning for he had 14
[1:45:12] 000 sheep
[1:45:13] check chapter one six thousand camels
[1:45:15] checked up to one
[1:45:16] a thousand yoke of oxen check chapter
[1:45:18] one a thousand she asses
[1:45:20] he also had seven sons and three
[1:45:23] daughters
[1:45:23] and he called the name of the first
[1:45:25] jemima and the name of the second kesia
[1:45:27] and the name of the third karen ha pooch
[1:45:30] and all the land
[1:45:31] where would and in all the land where no
[1:45:34] woman found so
[1:45:35] fear as the daughters of job and their
[1:45:38] father gave them
[1:45:38] inheritance among their bridges after
[1:45:41] this
[1:45:42] lived job 140 years
[1:45:45] and saw his sons and his son's sons
[1:45:48] even four generations so job died being
[1:45:52] old
[1:45:52] and full of these may the lord had a
[1:45:55] blessing
[1:45:56] to the reading of his word there's so
[1:45:58] much meat in this
[1:45:59] that i couldn't get to um but when you
[1:46:02] have time go into it
[1:46:04] it blessed me is so much so much so much
[1:46:07] about the struggle of life
[1:46:08] you know and it's really a real
[1:46:10] encouragement to see
[1:46:12] not just the redemption of what job had
[1:46:15] but i particularly love the turning away
[1:46:19] of his captivity
[1:46:20] when he prayed for his veteran who
[1:46:23] actually caused even more hurt than the
[1:46:26] loss of his
[1:46:27] money his wealth and his family because
[1:46:30] they made him question his soul
[1:46:32] they made him question his existence
[1:46:33] even more you know so
[1:46:35] i trust friends that as we go through
[1:46:38] our different
[1:46:39] challenges our different trials or
[1:46:40] different testings or different
[1:46:42] experiences in life inevitably because
[1:46:45] that's the way god has set it up
[1:46:46] we have to deal with loss we have to
[1:46:48] deal with betrayal
[1:46:50] and we have to deal with pain but the
[1:46:52] greatest lesson of this
[1:46:54] is not so much of
[1:46:57] how or what we go through with it but
[1:46:59] it's really our response and having the
[1:47:01] right response and having you right
[1:47:02] attitude to these things you write words
[1:47:06] saying you write things and it's tied to
[1:47:07] what brother preached last sunday
[1:47:09] because thou has done this thing
[1:47:12] we have to learn to say the right things
[1:47:15] we have to learn to do the right things
[1:47:18] and
[1:47:19] god will bless us he wants to bless us
[1:47:22] he loves
[1:47:22] to bless us can we bow our heads for a
[1:47:25] word of prayer
[1:47:26] our gracious heavenly father we thank
[1:47:29] you tonight
[1:47:30] for lord this encouragement
[1:47:33] lord lost pain and betrayal a study of
[1:47:36] job
[1:47:37] lord title that lord it's it's a paradox
[1:47:41] in itself
[1:47:42] how out of this we could be encouraged
[1:47:44] with feet
[1:47:45] to see how you worked with your silver
[1:47:47] and job as a testimony to us even
[1:47:50] through this time lord when
[1:47:52] lord there's so much going on lord
[1:47:55] family
[1:47:55] friends businesses situations challenges
[1:47:58] lord where in some way or the other we
[1:48:00] all deal with loss
[1:48:02] with pain with betrayal lord our
[1:48:04] families are affected our
[1:48:06] wealth is affected our health is
[1:48:08] affected and
[1:48:09] lord true at all lord the questions we
[1:48:12] may find ourselves having or
[1:48:13] asking or wondering or being concerned
[1:48:15] about the law to see
[1:48:17] that lord you still have a plan that is
[1:48:20] so much bigger than our plan
[1:48:22] and that your plan would stand and lord
[1:48:25] it took this whole experience
[1:48:27] lord for job to come to know you by
[1:48:30] a genuine experience lord he had not
[1:48:32] gone through enough to know you the way
[1:48:34] he knew you
[1:48:35] lord when it was over lord and there are
[1:48:37] so many
[1:48:38] bible characters who had different ends
[1:48:41] lord but to see
[1:48:42] job's testimony and how it lived out
[1:48:44] it's such a blessing to us so we thank
[1:48:46] you father for
[1:48:47] lord us being called in such a time as
