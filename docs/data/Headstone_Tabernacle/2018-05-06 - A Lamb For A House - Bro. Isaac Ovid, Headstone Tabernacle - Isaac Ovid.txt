wants to walk again after 23 years of being from an accident and he is believing God for a miracle and we also want to pray for by the Anthony O'Brien he's having some heart palpitations and having some trouble to breathe and if there's any unwritten requests that you want to show by raise of hands as we approach the throne of grace one more time see that hand see those hands all over the building I raised my hand also this morning God of heaven Lord you said healing is a children's bread and we have seen so many prayer requests become notes of praises and law we have this request from but the purchase for Christopher Ram roopu is believing in a God of miracles that after 23 years of being in an accident he could walk again lured me you visit him right now where he is Lord and give

request become notes of praise in the precious name of Jesus Christ and the church says amen and amen and amen you may be seated for a few minutes you can keep playing very softly we do have a testimony from sister Tricia lumens good morning Saints I want to testify of the goodness of God and what he has done and continues to do for me I've been oppressed by depression for some years I've been to doctors over the years taking medication and still I suffered two weeks ago I had a terrible attack that was so bad I started feeling suicidal I went back to the clinic and was told that I will have to start medication antidepressants for a two-year period and I would also have to see a psychologist on a weekly basis and they'd give me an appointment for the very next day when I got home my mother asked me how I was feeling and I told her I was feeling terrible she told me to go inside and pray she will pray also I went inside and I spread a cloth and knelt down and started to cry and how I could hardly pray through the crying and suddenly I heard and sign me a voice speaking saying behold I give you power to trample over serpents dry your tears and go rejoicing Jesus Christ makes you whole [Music] I got up and in two hours I was washing wares and feeling better that same afternoon brother Kang Lee came to my house and unexpectedly and I told him about my situation and he prayed the next day I was up at 5:30 a.m. singing drinking coffee and doing chores I could not do forties that same day I had an appointment for a psychological evaluation of my mental condition I declined since I believe without a doubt that this attack was sent by Seaton to destroy my mind to put doubts about Who I am and who God says I am and she puts something in here she said I have not been attending for a meetings and Tuesdays and when I finally attended all hell was against it and attacked my mind but greater is He that is in me and he that is in the world hallelujah glory to God - sir treasurer gomez what a testimony and she also has a note of praise God morning Saints last days the ad acts for prayer for my brother Vincent Gomez who had visited the doctor's after feeling unwell and was told that his white blood cells was eating the red blood cells however when prayer was offered in tizen night by Friday morning after visiting another doctor he was told at his blood was fine and to just drink a lot of water thank you Jesus and thanks to the Saints you loved the Lord this morning did he make away for you when your back was against the wall and it looked like it was over did he make a way for you when all hell was against you is that your testimony this morning that's my testimony oh let's it'd be the name of the Lord I wish I had a voice to sing glory hallelujah so you're ready for the word this morning amen amen so let's stand to our feet just wanna read from one portion of Scripture reading from Exodus chapter 12 and reading from verse 1 certainly welcome you all to the house of the Lord this morning Exodus chapter 12 and today is May the sixth and I believe the season has change real exactly two months away from the convention so I really want to connect to the theme of the convention so that we are in the spirit of preparation and the theme of the convention is applying the token because the Prophet said the evening time message is to apply the token so Exodus chapter 12 and reading from verse 1 and the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt saying this month shall be unto you the beginning of months not as powerful in other words God push the reset button on their lives and say from this month shall be unto you the beginning of months so whatever happened before we are starting over from this very declaration this month shall be unto you the beginning of months however you used to count it before but this month shall be unto you the beginning of months it shall be the first month of the year to you speaki unto all the congregation of Israel saying in the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb according to the house of their fathers a lamb for a house and if the household be too little for the lamb let him and his neighbor next unto his house take it according to the number of the souls every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb your lamb shall be without blemish a male of the first year he shall take it out from the sheep or from the goats and he shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month and the whole Assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening and they shall take up the blood and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper doorpost of the houses wherein they shall eat it they shall eat the flesh in that night roast with fire and unleavened bread and with bitter herbs they shall eat it eat not oven roar nor sudden at all with water but roast with fire his head with his legs and with the pertinence thereof and he shall let nothing of it remain until the morning and that which remaining of it until in the morning he shall burn with fire and thus shall he eat it with your loins girded your shoes and your feet and your staff in your hand and you shall eat it in haste it is the Lord's Passover so I will pass through the land of Egypt this night and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt both man and beast and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment I am the Lord and the blood shall be to you for token upon the houses wherein a year and when I see the Blood I will pass over you and upon the plague and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when I smite the land of Egypt and this day shall be unto you for a memorial and he shall keep it a feast to the Lord throughout your generations you shall keep it a feast by an ordinance forever may the Lord and a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated this morning amen can the church say men can the church say Amen Oh blessed be the name of the Lord so I have a title this morning a lamb for a house a lamb for a house within that statement there are a number of specifics it speaks about the lamb it speaks about being specific so it's not just a lamb it's for a house and it speaks about being in a house and if they aren't enough people in the house to eat the lamb you should come together because you have to consume the lamb when we speak of applying the token many times we speak of the blood being applied on the doorpost and that is very important but there were a number of conditions that had to be met for what God had envisioned take place it had to be a certain kind of lamb you couldn't just randomly go and pull a lamb from your flocking and offer it it had to be a lamb without blemish for the lamb to be without blemish you had to be able to verify that it was without blemish which meant you would have to take time to check the lamb in speculum to make sure that there was no blemish on the lamb to make sure that this lamb was qualified to be part of this process death was what was about to happen so I'm a hundred percent sure that the inspection of the lamb would have been a very serious thora affair because you couldn't take a chance and get a lamb that had a blemish you have to make sure that the lamb that you cut was one that have no blemish it means that if you want to be really sure it is not impossible to expect that somebody would have checked it and double checked it and triple checked it because you didn't want to take chance because the death angel was gonna pass by it was not just that the lamb was supposed to be without blemish but even when you got the lamb and or blemish you have to put fire on the lamb and you had to eat it eat all of it you can eat and say I just want a piece of it it had to be consumed and it had to be consumed in a in a certain way a certain approach it was not eat sweat comfort but it was eat with your loins get it eat with your staff in your hand because it was a consciousness that this is a meal before leaving it's a last meal as it were it is a meal of preparation so it's a lamb without blemish it's a it's a lamb that was taken the police for the house because the house was a house with problems understand this and we'll go to background in a few minutes but God was not given special treatment to the children of Israel sin is sin and sin has to be judged whether it was sin committed by the Egyptians or sin committed by the churun of Israel the consequence was the same there was no particular attention being placed under Turin of Israel because they were God's chosen people the provision that was being made for them was a way of escape the only difference between the children of Israel and the Egyptians once there was a provided way of escape aren't you glad this morning that there is a provided way of escape that there is no difference because of our natural birth there's no difference between us and anybody else but the real difference is not where we were born or how we were born but the real difference is he made always when it looked like your back was against the wall he made always he made aware of his skin and he sent a prophet with a word to point you through the way of escape no one the Prophet could preach that the evening time message is to apply the token because his whole gospel is about getting out of this place getting out of the world the things of the world the system of the world the mindset of the world the cares of this world [Applause] somebody say min I don't know what's gonna happen this morning but there's lots of BLM for a house I'm concerned about my house this morning are you concerned about your house and if how you're living is too small to consume that lamb you let a partner with somebody partner with the person next to you and say we have got to get a lamb we have got to get that blood we have gotta apply it on the door we have got to consume the sacrifice we've cluttered it at all [Applause] I don't want to eat it in a relaxed way we are getting out of here my loins are got to be good I wanna make sure my staff is in my hand because any minute we can get word it's time to move it's time to leave with [Applause] can attest a man he may be seen it just for background what was taking place three of those instructions was a real knockout punch this was the one Brown attack on the enemy this was a multi-pronged attack God was doing a number of things all at the same time it's one thing to hit the enemy in one spot but God found a way with one instruction to deal with a whole number of situations in that one instruction of a dying of token God was solving the issue of sin he was solving the issue of being in bondage he was solving the issue of you having a testimony he was solving the issue of your family being covered he was solving the issue of your brother that was upon their lives in one move he was feeding them at the same time in one move oh you don't hear me this morning in one night in one night God did a whole list of things and there's coming a stories after one night in one night gotta solve a whole list of the issues in your life overnight Aaron left his rod in the Holies of Holies and overnight life came back I don't care how you came this morning but in this service the chains the bondage the questions the doubt the depression you may be seated you may be seated hallelujah hallelujah somebody say man when I see the blood I'll pass over you he may be seen [Applause] laughs a house people are concerned about having our refrigerator for a house a pool for the house the television for the house a car for the house now we're going back to Scripture a lamb to the house you can have a fridge but if you don't have the lamb you don't have a house the issue is that if you're renting or if you're buying or if you own or you're borrowing or you stand by somebody it's still a lamb then you've got to have for the house going back all the way to Genesis I don't know how long I'm gonna be but today we have the Lord's Supper so we here for a while [Applause] when man fell the relationship with God was broken man could no longer accept access God the way he used to because God enjoyed coming in the cool of the evening and fellowshipping with men having a conversation with man but sin is a barrier it's a wall Herman man fell he found his own way but the man who said by using the fig leaves he's one interpretation to cover up his nakedness that he was now aware of and God found an animal skin and give it to them a table ready of the blood being shed because a payment was required because sin has a consequence and once there is sim it has to be paid for somehow and the wages of sin is still death you could be in the message and dead you could be a church in dead because being in church doesn't take away the sin issue from our lives it take the transformation of our soul at an acceptance of the perfect lamb and perfect sacrifice that could take our place because if you don't accept that you have to find a way to pay so before Jesus would come for years they would pay with a lamb a lamb without blemish and I said to them and they go marching that they would check the lamb they would lift up the hairs of the lamb lift up the check slowly because this was not an act of doing it out of tradition it was supposed to be you on that altar Danny but a lamb was taking your place on it could not be a lamb with sin because it would be back in the same problem so the lamb had to be won without blemish as a type of one without sin who in the priests was satisfied when you were satisfied of this that his lamb was a perfect lamb and have no blemish then the lamb was killed and the life would leave that lemon when that life left the lung your house your life it should have been looted it's gonna bury you there but that lamb was taken your place and I preached it before there should have been a transfer because an exchange was really supposed to be taking place when that life left the lamb it should have been a life that became your life and your sin went onto that lamb but that transfer could have never taken place because you were not compatible with the lamb there was a compatibility era but when Jesus died the perfect lamb for the first time there could have been a transfer of your sins to him and his life to you I'm no longer was it covering your sin but it was bleaching [Applause] it was acting it was eliminating no one he said who is one who he caller who he call it just a fighter who we justified he has already glorified as if you never did it in the first place friends you ABCs it what was going on that mates have never happened before [Applause] can we go back to that night can we go back to that night Moses and Aaron was speaking to the people do you have to find a way to get the word out to everybody this has nothing to do with what tribe you belong to the angel is passing it has nothing to do with if you believe or don't believe it has all to do with the death angel is coming and this is a new beginning the beginning of months because for 400 years we have been in bondage and I shared with them and they go Martin after 400 years there would have been people in Egypt children of Israel in Egypt who would have just heard about the promise from their grandfathers and from their fathers after a while there would have been people who would have wondered if didn't make it out because their grandfather would have said you know there's a deliverer supposed to be coming but I don't know and he would have died in bondage and it'd be somebody there who is grandfather would have died in bondage his father would have died in Bundy that is easy if you've seen this happening around you for you to wonder if there's a chance for you to make it out to the children of Israel out there and they are watching this man called Moses do miracle after miracle sign after sign because God told Moses go down to Egypt as he let my people go and just as sister Tricia said the moment she made an effort to make it to the prayer meeting all hell broke loose and the moment Moses said let my people go Pharaoh give them work and see how given your no straw still make bricks in other words the devil is not gonna make it easy for you to get out he's not gonna make it easy for you to get away he's not gonna make it easy for you to have a revival he's not gonna make it easy for you to have a prayer life he's not gonna make it easy for you to make things right he's not gonna let you just it's not gonna happen by accident it's gonna be a fight so Moses will come and and turn the rod into sneakin and the devil will do the same thing he turned the water to blood and the devil as a responsible frogs and flies and fleas and locusts and he and everything else and it's a war that's going on it's a war that's going on but God is smiling because he knows with every step of the way he's petting his people closer to getting out of bondage [Applause] getting somebody closer to being free from the taskmaster getting somebody closer to being free and we read the scripture bring my people out so they could worship me even Moses Paul Pharaoh let my people go so that they can worship me oh come on now come on now so then when I being set free don't not have to work anymore they were not being set free just to not be slaves they were being set free to worship they were being set free from inheritance they were being set free to have a testimony but God was not interested only in their physical freedom he was interested in the freedom from sin so that's why it was a type of the Passover so blood being shed for the redemption of their souls as well and God wanted it that when they eat the lamb they were eating the sacrifice that's our tie because when Christ died that word party became the sacrifice that we consume and we are consuming this morning and he told him eat at all and we want to eat every bit of it every special every word every promise every verse every line I don't leave anything for tomorrow I want to eat it today with my staff in my hand with my loins get it because anyway we are getting out of here anything we are leaving this place and the church say man somebody give God a shout of praise Oh hallelujah hallelujah it's freedom time it's freedom time for somebody this morning and I could imagine while they were in the house there would have been children in the house they don't understand all that's going on but momma and Poppa have to tell the children boy daughter all your stuff in your hand and eat it in his don't relax and eat it we want to eat it in haste because we are getting out of here go away mama I can't tell you all of these heels but it's a promise but we gotta get out of here you'll understand it better by and by all I can tell you right now is eat in his eating isn't plenty it's at all you don't have to ask permission for seconds because we have to eat everything until it's gone keep eatin you don't need permission to eat this word this morning give me permission to claim your inheritance is spawning we want to eat we want to eat a whole roll we want to eat every promise oh come on come on hallelujah glory to God and the church say Amen if you were confused you could have still made it if you were in a house that had fulfill the request that God made let me see it again if you are just obeyed it was just like in the Genesis wim-kian and email offer their sacrifices God - okay listen if you do what your brother do you'll be all right and qiyam couldn't even do that but in that day if you had put blood on your door and obey the same instruction because the Bible says in Exodus 13 around 36 37 today so where around there that a mixed multitude went out so it was not just the children of Israel that went out there were some other people who heard the rumor and heard the wood and say I don't know if you know what they're doing but what they're doing is they're getting a lamb without blemish and they are cooking this one they are putting blood on the doorpost I don't know about you but dear God is on a deliverance path I don't know how they're doing it but they turn water to blood they send fleas they send frogs his then fries this is the low level fit didn't you fit we don't know what's gonna happen but at least if we do this we have a good shot of making it [Applause] and the Bible's in a mixed multitude left Egypt that's why but the problem said that's why they had people in that group who was making the legal and thing for the Golden Calf it's from that mixed multitude you take God at His Word God is obligated to honor his word he said if you apply if I see blood apply the correct way I'll pass over you you don't even have to understand the full details of it but if I see the blood that's what I'm passing over young brother young sister you understand it by a lie but make sure that there's blood on your house make sure you apply the token on your life make sure you inspect your life this morning can the church same the time had come for their deliverance because the Bible said God heard the cries of his people by reason of their taskmasters and I can't help but reflect the sister Trish's testimony she said at one point it couldn't she could even praise she gets for herself crying and God heard a cry some time it doesn't even take words but he hears the cry he has a cry when you cry for your children he hears a cry when you cry for your situation when you feel that pain in your body and there's a cry in your soul that's has a cry he said I've heard the cries of my people and because they're my people I've come down to deliver them Anna I've got to set them free because those taskmasters have them doing what you're not supposed to be doing and the church seaman and there was a process because those terminals went through a whole fleet of emotions and because you imagine when Moses first come down and and Moses that's what I love about God God doesn't tell you the whole script he tells you just what you need to know to go forward because he be told you the whole script there's no need for trust and God wants you to trust him so Moses goes down there and when he chose the rock down Moses thought that was it enough Moses taught when he dropped that write down there Pharaoh next eprints gonna be everybody go I'm furious Ponce's Janis Jam breeze give him a demonstration enough we can do it too and on top of that go tell your people the same Talley EE Talley nostro keep working I'm Cornish doing something and each other and say Moses why I come why you come we was a prisoner no but are you gonna make it worse they don't understand God is unfallen something but at that point in time in the middle of your deliverance sometimes things just get worse but just before you break you and pray that's when the mosquitoes come that's when the pressure come just before your break truth is he hardest the darkest before dawn and mostly the stallion Tigre criticism and still keep moving because he knows something has got to come he knows the corner he met he knows what happened when he met the pillar of fire he knows the experience that he had so it didn't matter to him what anybody else said he knew that God was gonna deliver oh come on now come on now church come on our church hallelujah wasn't easy for them after 400 years the pressure and increased the trials had increased the challenge had increased but they were close to getting out of there they were close to their deliverance and miracle after miracle or plague after plague however you want to look at it it depends on what side of the equation you're on miracle after miracle or plague after plague or was stripping and breaking down the situation until the last plague striking all the firstborn bought man and beast but the random priestess message that talking with her bleedin with the burden of his heart because it was a serious message and there it was and that night I could imagine and throughout all the hoses their people they are getting ready because they don't know what's gonna happen what Moses is telling them had never happened before and Brandon my name is Krishna but no I said Noah's story one of Acts no.1 daddy are you sure and I can imagine as a dead angel interpreter Langley sitting here screams coming from higher of the street and I can imagine the people in the houses were are you sure he's sure we applied it right are you sure we did everything right I saw we put everything in please because I I hear screams which means somebody that I doff my head daddy was this the right lamb daddy was there any blemish on this little daddy did we cooked in fire daddy did we eat everything daddy did you put the blood on the doorpost but the Brennan said the blood on the doorpost was a public display that you are identified with the sacrifice and when I see that public display I'll pass over you when I see the Blood I will pass over you every feast that a turn of Israel celebrated had a certain importance but this feast of the Passover was a significant one because Jesus became the very Passover what was happening in Egypt was a type of what would come many years ahead when it'll be a lamb for every house back there it was individual lambs and or blemish but when Jesus came it was a lamb singular for every house a perfect sacrifice that to take care of your family to take you of your neighbor to take care of your situation can the church cement this power in the blood this morning can the church same and but the Branham said the blood speaks it speaks a better thing God isn't interested in you say in something friends because whatever you say will never be enough but when the blood is applied the blood takes over the speaking and the blood speaks better lots of things for you better things about you but the ground said in the token it speaks a better thing the Old Testament the blood spoke of guilt in the New Testament it speaks of redemption in the Old Testament it spoke of death and sorrow but in the New Testament it speaks of resurrection and life it's peace of healing it speaks of joy it speaks of power it speaks of life it it speaks of heaven and that seemed blood that was shed up underground that call out after his dead brother the blood of Jesus covers all of our sins and speaks peace and resurrection and power and light and healing and all the redemptive blessing that the blood was shed for it speaks for us certainly it speaks can the church say man [Applause] but it is the difference now because it's not a physical house so you can't just do what somebody else to and walk out of Egypt with the crowd because other people are doing it the house is now your house it's now your tabernacle it's now you as an individual have to get a lamb for your house oh come on now somebody somebody help me somebody help me and you as your house or call it a tabernacle have to consume the lamb have to apply the token on your house so that when you walk the devil knows these are token when you walk God knows there's a token when you walk your brother knows there's a token when you walk sickness knows it's a token when you walk all hell knows there's a token and when I see the blood I'll pass over you and you can sing that song let the death angel pass I shall not be moved I know it is well with my soul I know I've done all that God instructed me to do oh come on now come on now come on now Oh hallelujah Oh glory glory glory glory glory glory but the Branham said some people say when I belong to church mother went up there I was dedicated as a baby that has got nothing to do with it you could have been born and whatever job you were born into you had to display the token but the parent said you must display the token move on all the worldly trash all the things of the world because you can't love the things of the world all your unbelief in God's will remember he promised these things inelastic anything in your life that's against that move it out and get ready and bring the token in hallelujah hallelujah I'm gonna brand untitled like this he said when they kill the lamb and they took the blood but a terrorist loves to speak on this it took his up come on weeds come on Pete and this how to apply it they applied it on the door with the common faith they had and brother branham said that come on feet is the same feet it takes to start your car that is the same thing it takes that when you pick up a cup of coffee you expect that coffee to move in the cup that's faith right there that seemed come on feet you're gonna ply the talk and he said apply on your children apply on your house applied in your family [Applause] hallelujah a sister told me last week that she Aarohi she has an unbelieving husband and when brother over in a couple weeks ago spoke about getting as a family and praying together she wondered how she could do it she said she knows he's not gonna come and pray with her but she decided to take off his coat that she put on her bed and she prayed on that and she said something change he's had to get different so I said to her sister pray for the cup pay for the spoon pay for the plate every pillow kids apply the token on everything and watch what God started oh come on now come on now yes power in the blood yes healing in the blood just deliver us in the blood I'm not talking about the blood of bulls and goats but yes power in the blood of Jesus to break every chain break every shackle oh come on now oh you don't hear me this morning and I got good news for you you may be seated on Saturday mantilla Martin I said even if you don't know who God is the devil knows who he is because when Jesus says let us go to the other side when Jesus came off the boat and he hit the ground the spirits upon Legion the devil upon Legion recognized who he was they are people in church who don't recognize the power of God but when the Devils that were upon Elisha saw Jesus they say why have you come because you never been on this side before why have you come to torment me I've got this body here for a long time but Jesus came with an agenda he came with an agenda it's okay to have an agenda it depends on what it is Jesus came to deliver all man Oh hallelujah oh come on now come on now somebody come on now somebody that man his name was not leaves on you may be seated but the spirits that will upon him they call themselves Legion and when Jesus came do you recognize him Jesus come on devil they see we gotta go somebody trot him in the pigs this same man he was out of his mind but he was crying the Bible said because he knew that deliverance just like the children of Israel he was crying it's gonna be a cry there's gonna be a crying your soul for something more than just coming to church it's gonna be a cry it's okay to have problems but if the problems come with a cry no something could happen about the problem because God responds to the cries of his people that man called Legion he had a cry there was a meaningless soul there was enough of him left inside a deer you know why because the devil can never destroy the seed that God place in your soul that they will try to dig his mind he tried to take his body he typed it oh you don't hear me this morning but the seat of the soul the devil couldn't take it out so that she'd when it recognized that Messiah was on the earth he was pulsing option Jesus had to respond oh you don't hear me this morning you may be seated Oh somebody please back to me somebody please back to me this morning I got some good news for you you may be seated in every plane there's something called a black box so that whenever the plane crashes the black box is like a homing device so that the rescue team could come and find wherever the crashes even gonna get to the homing device the black box he didn't find out what happened so God is what it was a world he knew what he was sending you out into so he put up box in your soul and put a seed and listen whenever something goes wrong catbots he gets a pulse ping ping ping ping it's a distress signal something's not right and whenever you in trouble that signal goes ping ping ping you may be seated so Jesus is preaching and while he's preaching he's hearing Bing Bing Bing the Bible said he was tired he told him let us go to the other side Bing Bing he is sleeping on the boat they don't know what's going on but a homing device has been activated and I believe this morning a device has been activated deep in the socket of your soul and God is obligated to respond to the cries of his people [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you maybe seen it for a minute [Applause] you know what I love about the black box you don't have to manually turn it on it comes on for itself so when you're in trouble the seed in your soul it speaks for itself it's like that kind of I will restore see the Lord see all the years the cankerworm the caterpillar the locust of Hamelin the devil eat everything town until it's a stump and then when it reaches stump the stump could only speak when it's exposed so only when things get really bad the system can't see you guys anymore you've eaten enough now I am worried stop all the years I'm gonna restore your house I'm gonna restore your family I'm gonna restore your children I'm gonna restore your joy oh don't get me started this morning I'm gonna restore your peace I'm gonna sell a revival [Applause] could be take something off [Applause] [Applause] from the schedule you add the word about the Passover took effect from the time of Moses and to this day it is still in effect because the ordinance was given forever however by the time Jesus came the people had lost the sincerity history tells us that the even started to commercialize the lamb chicken they became casual about the sacrifice of a lamb for me too there were men who would have projected away the sincerity of that process of because the checking of the lamb for blemish was your opportunity to also do your own reflection am i living right am I did I make things right did I did I offend this person I say Lord have theirs anyway than me that shouldn't be there Lord take it out is because I should be there but this lamb has taken my place it was supposed to be a solemn sacred event but men attended and it lost its importance its sacredness and Jesus would have none of it no I'm not you turn over the tabernacle and said you have turned my father's house into a den of thieves we have become too casual about this thing we take it for granted Feast of Tabernacles feast of passover feast of unleavened bread fees and everybody have a visa it's an event in fact when Jesus was left in the temple was a feast brought him there and he was so focused on the feast and the event that they forgot Jesus talked about coming to church and forget why I come to church it took them treat is to recognize a Mary where Jesus Joe I thought you had him treat is it's so caught up in the feast and the celebration that you forget Jesus and when they go back they find Jesus surrounded by Eliz high priests ministers taking notes as Jesus expounding the word to them and when they say well Jesus but but ya know he left on come he said don't you know I'm supposed to be about my father's business so people have become casual and the question is have we become casual meditate on the word day and night you see when something becomes necessary for your survival it tells a lot about what you deem important by what you prioritize there are people who are faithful about taking their medication because they understand that if you don't take it something could go wrong heart medication high blood pressure medication you don't mess with them when it come time to take that pill and this gospel which has power to heal the heart condition reverse the high blood pressure regularize the low blood pressure [Applause] people want to take it once a week when the doctor told us take it every day take it in the morning take it in the nighttime and unlike other medications that you are restricted to only to cause you could overdose with disick overdose [Applause] you can take I've needed sleep in the morning ten o'clock eleven o'clock take a scripture you say a prayer all day you cannot overdose on this in fact the more you get the drunker you get morning time this is the only theater drink and nobody can mess with you these men are not drunk as you suppose it's nine o'clock every morning don't worry about them this is that good old fashioned sin killing sky-blue Holy Ghost revival it's good at 6:00 a.m. is good at 10:00 a.m. it's good at 11:00 p.m. it's good at for him you can get drunk anytime hallelujah I said it in the go Martin to see a doctor you need to make an appointment God hated that thing man but when he died he ran the veal from top to bottom he removed this please the role of the high priests he could walk in and there anytime you want their stories there's no secretary there's no permission it's your father and he can attend to everybody at the same time there's no line up there's no permission please anytime you need a touch you can say lord have mercy on me Oh somebody please back to me a lamb for every house [Applause] you see the problem is and I'm seeing it so clearly our same with brother over a few years ago but the brand up is a message convinced and concerned before you can get concerned you must be convinced you cannot have a burden for anything unless you are convinced with [Applause] being convinced is the prerequisite to be in concerned if you don't see the possibility of something happening you will never make preparation for it but whenever you get convinced that something could happen a certain way listen nobody could change your mind when you are convinced no wonder the bugs aren't fully persuaded I don't know who it have to tell it but I am fully persuaded that not in present nothing to come nothing - fully persuaded guess not doubt in my soul that we can have a 7-ton revival I'm fully persuaded that the black spiders in this church could be fully delivered not bad deliverance not may be delivered but I'm fully persuaded that Molokai for some message has not fallen to the ground but there are people on the land who are not yet messenger but with the final voice to the final age I'm fully persuaded [Applause] that the blood could never lose its power I'm persuaded that he is still a deliverer I'm fully persuaded no doubt in my mind no question in my mind because he said he kind of changed he kind of make a mistake he didn't call you by accident he didn't call you by chance he didn't put your name in blood by accident he may be seated and to show how serious he is about this business he actually said the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world so the blood was shed was not shed in a response to what you did it was shed in Antibes in anticipation of the mistakes you would make and yet still God said you you with all your mistakes you know no not a person next to you I'm calling you and I'm gonna give you a new heart I'm gonna give you a new spirit I'm gonna put my spirit in there [Applause] you know what the Prophet said for the devil to get to you he has to come under the blood and he cannot come under the blood oh you don't hear me this morning or you don't hear me this morning because if the devil came under the blood you be your brother but the devil is not your brother I'm gonna need two blood the devil to you no harm oh you don't hear me this morning you don't hear me this morning you see the mistake we make is weeping this 16 elements is who we are this is not who we are God cannot put you in anybody oh you don't hear me this morning the real you is the soul that's seen in the soul oh you don't hear me this table to watch you but he can't touch you [Applause] somebody get gonna shout of praise somebody give Him glory somebody say hallelujah isn't it good to know that your family is going to be delivered isn't it wonderful to know your wife is going to be set free after all these years your husband your children all these years you're holding on rolling on in Egypt holding on in Egypt and while you're holding on corners preparing a deliverer oh you know what's even better in the days of Moses God came down and he sent Moses he said I have come down but you were gonna go but this time the Lord Himself descended and when he sent the Prophet home the mighty angel - want me to step back wings - Lord Himself he stayed to lead the deliverance charge himself because this is the final Exodus oh you don't hear me this morning this was not the work of a prophet anymore this is not the work of a man anymore this is God himself the Lord Jesus himself the very angel of the covenant him down to lead the final Exodus hallelujah he may be seated [Applause] you could imagine when Moses said the Egyptians you see today you will see them no more forever the Lord Himself is waiting to make a declaration that is devil that you have seen for all these centuries you will see him no more because Satan will be bound round in a chain you have no room to move because all the love of God will be wrapped up in a bride and oh come on now there there'll be no room do you understand that if there's no room for the devil in your heart in your mind the devil is crippled here [Applause] just as God needs somebody to use the devil needs somebody to use but when you start to project so much love because the devil can't exist where is love perfect love casts out fear perfect love cast out thought perfect love casts on unbelief when love oh come on now Sovereign Grace takes over the devil have to look for another vessel so we want to have the kind of church where there's so much love that that there's no room for the devil to move never wrekonize not this church not this house not this family there's no room for him in this place we only have room for adoption we only have room for perfection we only have room for the promises of Cory only one of the only words in our tongue is revival and and deliverance and breakthrough and overcoming and trampling the necks of the enemy and that's what we love to talk about the politics such a fade it doesn't mean anything anymore because you're looking towards getting out of here because your loins are girded your stuff in your hand [Applause] can the church same Oh Lord Magus present tends to us the challenge for most of us is we could come to service on a Sunday and we get encouragement the problem is not that the problem is Monday the problem is Tuesday the problem is Wednesday the problem is what I've always called between Sunday's because once the word goes forth with power and clarity the devil someone who came here if you didn't have your reason to feel lighter because light and darkness kind of live in the same house when you put on a light any cockroach anything have to go because it cannot live when he light is on and the world itself is light so when you come into the presence of God you will automatically feel better even if you didn't want to feel better even if your somebody dragged your young or get drag that you just won you feel him at all ready because I think in fact that he has on you [Applause] that's why the progress that we ought to be the happiest people a new face of the earth because every Sunday you get what other people wish they could get you get a whole basket of joy and peace price man to have it Massey stores will have it you could come in and fill it up your how much you want with a problem some time ago I was in a meeting with a job interview and a young man said I'm a good worker and stuff in a way see thing is though if something happened to me it is a figment you see so if somebody my bad drive all day I upset somebody give you a bad drive and we must suffer you hold it because you is now you give me by driving somebody give you an that affect you for you holding and how many of us we rejoice with the world and then something happens and listen it's not like you supposed to be surprised the devil has a job some people pick it before like it's like oh she won't believe me trial every day you have a trial coming and for some special people is more than one and for some very special people is more than two and for some very very slight it's like more than three four that's why when you see one of the runs Sunday should give them a big smile and shake hands because there are some survivors who made it through a war zone landmines greenies rocket launchers the swamp truest see the parachute or the airplane bottle hot and heavy but you know what he made a wing he kept you [Applause] I listen to sister Trish's testimony but he said she felt so bad she felt suicidal the Prophet took a gun to his head God was already working with him and he felt like he couldn't go on anymore it was not a thought to him he pulled the trigger and God jammed it because God says you are ready to go yet yes to work for you to do so stop feeling sorry for yourself and cut up your loins what you have in your hands because I got a people that got to come out of Egypt for the Panama's our losses but he had his Valley he had his little moments but when it counted he said I see a bride coming into view I see your people I see a church marching in step I see the promise man coming into view so close I can almost feel it service is that time for the manifestation of the sons of God somebody give got us out appraised [Applause] something has to click on the inside that manifests on the outside it's not the outside in it has to be inside out that's why young brother young sister mama Papa prayed for God to give you a revelation of who you are of who he is of what the token is of how to live this gospel what works in Luther's day will not work in this thing what work in Wesley's day will not work in this day oh come on now in each day they have to display the message of VAD not in our day we have to display everything because all that was in all ages have been gathered up to this age when God was looking at people to put in ages imagine god looked at Wesley looked at better Ganguly and say you know one Wesley in this age and put real economy in this age good it is harder never put Wesley here he can't make it [Applause] there's a reason where a Joshua that Court put you in this age oh he could not have put anybody in this ditch in this age when the lid of hell is open and streams of demon powers [Applause] God looked at a brownie say Abraham father of missions I'll put you here Moses I'll put you here Jeff tyre put you here pizza perfect I'll put you when I come down I'll be there with you oh god help me but who do I put in 2018 with all the technology and all the music and all the styles and all the fashion and all the pornography and all the stuff on the phones and the tablets and the internet and 4G are my G who do I put who can I put who can I put [Applause] Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh mama mama mind when the devil bring out his best but the panel said the devil came into God's Eden but now it's shaytans Eden he has built it up with the best of everything I'm going to seeing I've gotta save the best for last [Applause] you may be seated friends but the Branham takes it oh I feel comfortable but they're attached dude he said like it was the light being shown on the wood so he said in Luther's day when he's shown he only saw certain things and when Wesley came it was a brighter light so he saw more than what Wesley saw and when the Prophet came he shunned more light revealed everything but within what he revealed there was certain things that are hidden that he said there'll be men come to make more sense of it and to make sure nobody just gets it rapture and features laying there one day you'll recognize what it is but he had to say it for us to be able to connect with it so our young people know more than Wesley our young people know more than Luther so you understand why the devil is afraid of you but knowledge is not what it would take to defeat the enemy belief is not what it will take to defeat the enemy because the Bible tells us even the devil believes so if knowledge and belief was good enough then we make it but unfortunately that's not the case it takes something more than knowledge it takes something more than belief do I have all knowledge do I know mysteries do I give my body to be burned and have not charity there's got to be something more that we get that separates us from everybody else not by our choosing not by our merit not by our ability but by the grace of God because he's had a headstone will come with Shelton's of grace grace grace grace [Applause] so we are here by grace this morning [Applause] [Applause] somebody give God a shout of praise [Applause] so it's grace that has spoken our hearts but the grace that has spoken our hearts a message scheme wrapped in Greece because it was just Greece that you have nothing to do in the issue then the nature of man is to sit back so that's why in the script you read it in haste this has to be a consciousness of urgency in other words God is saying don't be relaxed about this thing what have you do to quickly do it with seriousness do it with the mindset of preparation because if we get relaxed that's where the enemy comes in and the problem with many of us we have taken off the pressure on the devil in our lives you know recall that would compromise compromise we find so many ways to compromise and after a while but the Branham said when that still small voice tells you don't do something don't do something don't do something he said every time you ignore it that voice gets softer and softer until you become insensitive to that still small voice and then you don't hear it anymore because you have silenced that voice that's why brother Branham taught us and it's a word to the young people world to the church if there's a question in your mind about something don't do it should I go to my school thing we have anything I wanna guess you go mommy get the one nervous ago leave it alone the co-workers and work they say as well every Friday a little is a little lime is nine serious the moment you have a question if it will compromise your testimony don't do it the browser says stay away from shady places every place look cheery you don't need to get confirmation if it is we have to be shady verification business the very same I wish on the very appearance it don't have to be real but even appear to be evil there are movies and shows and books and magazines and all kinds of stuff but people get into their lives but the problem see when you apply in the token you can apply the token and keep these things in the house [Applause] in other words in that day if you had got the lamb at 11:00 got a lamb without blemish and you didn't cook it right or you eat it raw and put your blood you actually broke the instruction and this is the point I want to get people say it has I've just put the blood but the blood was been applied with instructions so I kill a lamb you put the blood here cooking Lamia Eden Lamia how could God honor that because he was structuring in a certain way and full obedience to the entire word is what entitles you to the token so when we compromise on this and that and this is the greatest compromise didn't see brother so-and-so doing it yes his sister so and so yes see we passed the daughter pastor's son I trained myself under the bus don't use me as your reason oh come on now Oh somebody preach back to me [Applause] but if brother Isaac that has nothing to do with it make your calling and election sure when lord it was it was the pastor wife threw me off oh come on somebody preached back to me no excuses for house [Music] Claude is no respecter of persons he may receive it I heard a preacher say one time coral fire you and not even tell you saw one was fired and still only truth and God already working with David because God is about his business and he about his world and anybody else he's promised your plans will be loaded there's only one person in Chile that make it Lord let that person be me you have to look to the world yourself that's why I love how Paul said it he said follow me as I follow Christ so he even put a restriction on following him because he said if I step out of line abandon me one time we look to flesh so much that we miss Jesus is the focus so the moment a man makes a mistake your whole boat or over you under the boat you don't know where the engine is but we love with respect there many people the brother who baptized your pastor he left Church it doesn't mean he wasn't baptized but God used him at that time and at that season so God will use people but don't piss your salvation or your testimony or your prayer life or your commitment on anybody it's a lamb for a house make sure your house is in order [Applause] but a Branham said there are three kinds of believers in every Church there's no church immune their church as I said this is the church where the angel is this is the church and with the Branham says in every Church there trait kinds of believers and these are believers this is not dealing with people in the church who are unbelievers alone he deliberately believers which are they also unbelievers I think a few people got that so they are unbelievers it is there it does do even believe and that's why you have to really can I talk of it really search God because it troubles me when I say I'm in that chair but I don't believe everything why are they because you're not a believer you're not even making it to the chickens but within the believer that chick and make believer unbelievable even any true believers so you can't judge a church by its individuals you have to judge a church by how it steers with the wood because the word is the absolute not the idea not a dream it's a vision of the supposition of the suggestion that's the argument that he beat that's what happening in news yesterday not what happened in North Korea that is not the word the word is God and God is consistent everywhere because yet I am God and I changed not and to settle the debate he sends prophets who are his MO peace whoo and this week they're not speaking for themselves they are speaking the very thoughts of God to establish a plumb line by which everything else is measured and it's upon that foundation that is set by the prophets and the apostles we can now stand and look up because our Redemption draweth nigh because we have clarity of purpose clarity of vision clarity of where we have come from and where we are going can the church shame the children of Israel did it in form and function by applying the blood on the door but those people who did that did not even make it to the promised land so this day is different because applying it now makes you a candidate for the promised land apply the token is you starting to step into the promise of this holy ghost land because what was expected of them is different than what is expected of us we have a promise of adoption we have a promise of power but the Branham said right now we lay hands on the sick but when that time comes we'll command The Devil's these stubborn Devils who want to give resistance when that time coming wouldn't be praying anymore it'll be devil get out he said you wouldn't even have to say in Jesus name because Christ himself will be tabernacle in individuals he said the pillar of fire will rest on the shoulders of a top dead sons of God God Himself it was the pillar of fire that was in pizza topping 16 elements is that your expectation is that your prayers at your desire let me try to find a place to close out this woman but friends I want you to take this to heart don't take it for granted friends my prayers that you get convinced and then concerned because God did only bless you if you make room for the blessing it's like taking the valley full of ditches you can take a small ditch and get a little bit of water or you can take a filled out of your life and make room for so much water it's your choice God is a gentleman she I stand at the door and knock he's not breaking on nobody door he said if any man here open the door welcoming I'll come in and sup with him I've come in and fellowship with him have you made time for him this week have you made time for him yesterday did you make time for him the day before did you make time for him in your life on your job I'm just going to talk a little bit then we call the musicians up because Jesus preached he also talked to the people can Jesus take control of your house and do what he wants with it I'm just talking to you a little bit personally it's hard to have a favorite character in Scripture but for me it's it's Peter I just love Peter Peter for me is it's a breathtaking refreshing up-and-down experience of Peter goes from completely one extreme to the next all the time but could Jesus take control of your life and use it and when you read the Bible and this applies to your school your life your marriage your house everything I'm just talking now I'm not preaching anymore and for those in the internet who will see this God richly bless you I'm at home talking here at home Peter had finished fishing caught nothing the Bible said he was washing his nests we talked about this before I just wanna slow down a little bit and the Bible said when Jesus came he stepped into Peters boat pull it away from the shore and started to talk to the people in other words Peters life the mechanism even used for business to provide for his family Jesus was able to take control of it and I want to bring it personally can Jesus take control of your house Jesus command here as a term his vehicle and used it to preach Peter didn't choose to come to service that day he was packing up to go home and well because it's his board here and he couldn't leave so Peter ended up stuck in a church service because Jesus commandeer his boat and was teaching the people can Jesus commandeer your car can take control of your business your house your life your marriage can you walk into is your boat in a condition that he could sit in because Jesus out of all the ports that were available he chose Peters boat to sit in and to use it as his pulpit talk about putting Peter on the spot and having a public display because now Peter they're associated with this creature and Peter is not yet converted this is before Pizza is told to follow me I wonder how Peter was thinking why Jesus is preaching because this is Peters boat his business his livelihood his testimony and he is there and Jesus is teaching Jesus is preaching and Peter is there any saber Whitner potentials no way I didn't know Peter was with Jesus but Jesus is teaching so much and when he's done is when he tells Peter Peter casseon nets back in the water and now Peter has a choice and the choice Peter has is and he makes a choice the Bible said he cast one net the instruction was can see a nets plural Peter made a choice to cast one net and when he put that one you have a choice you always have a choice what Peters choice said was I heard your message the chapter before Peters mother-in-law was healed I spoken this before so I saw my mother-in-law healed I heard you turn water into wine because this is the earliest part of Jesus ministry so I have enough believe that something had happened and it's a hundred percent convinced because if he was a hundred percent convinced he would have done what Jesus said and through all the myths but I heard enough to take some action so he put one net in the water and the Bible says there was so much fish that the net broke and he had to call for other boats to come what are the experiences that God must carry you through to bring you to the point of being convinced because when Peter saw that he was so convinced he didn't even speak about the catch he said Lord forgive me depart from me I'm a sinful man he went beyond the natural and saw his spiritual condition and then jesus said come follow me and pizza walks off the boat leave the biggest catch of his fishing career began he didn't worry who was gonna eat it was gonna sell it was gonna buy it Pizza where you going I don't know Peter how you're gonna eat if this man could get fish too and I don't know there's no fish I'm not worried about that I'm gonna follow he went from being partially convinced to being fully convinced to being fully persuaded pizza I call him a man of extremes Jesus walking on water Peter would say Lord if that is you with us Laura dies you wave Peter says Lord as you bid me come that's Peter because he is so convinced now that he walks out the boot and begins to walk the G until he recognized wait a minute this is a little much for me but he was willing to try Jesus but the problem said you could be fearless and reckless and feet some of us are too timid to afraid Peter a man if extreme that's a three and a half years I said it in dig imagine Jesus there a Garden of Gethsemane after three and a half years of good preaching there's no preacher like Jesus the best response that Peter could get is to pull out a blade and chop off a man yes [Music] and Jesus didn't punish him because jesus knew what he was going through Jesus picks up the air and puts it back science and he talked about alternative and surgery going on and this doctor did this surgery this doctor fix this in one move jesus reattaches money as if it never was cut off because he was on a mission and Peter had a purpose and his ups and downs did not just find his purpose his purpose was defined by what was written about him before there was the foundation of the world a painful experience with Peter Peter before the crows you'll deny me Peter couldn't even believe it Peter did not accept that he was capable of denial and you know with so many experiences we go through in our Christian walk the Italians we fewer on top of the mountain and the time we chest down in the valley and you know what brother branham said he says if there was no mountain and no valleys we would never be able to appreciate the mountain top if we didn't have a valley if there were no bad moments he would merely be able to appreciate took good moments so Peter found himself down in our Valley when Jesus has taken away Peter were you there he's like no it wasn't just a statement to him you know it was the reality settling in that I feel I messed up I actually did just what Jesus told me I was gonna do you imagine what it is to feel that way they asked him again he said no I was not there they asked him again and the Bible said after there's no time Peter wept bitterly what what is it do we bitterly I hope this help somebody this morning we have gone past preaching this is a talk to somebody today going through something I don't know what you're going through this morning but he knows there's some of us we are in the mountaintop and that's wonderful but there many of us in our own valley old crushes our own doubts like what our sister Trisha would have gone through but God pull her out of it and he's able as much to pull you out of whatever condition you are in and it's so blessed me when I think a two weeks ago I was speaking about when Jesus went when he angel met the people he said the woman who came to anoint the body and he told them go tell my disciples and Peter [Music] because Peter would have been down in a valley you know what it is to be having a test of money people know your testimony kudamon say I am tired at Christ's brother Peter Peters Underwood today's shop God talks to Peter Peter walked under water it is anointed and a new calf I am Peter Peter message because he deny Christ and friends there's so many ways we didn't I am we deny him in our homes we deny our jobs when because the token is the flipside of dynamically talking it's a public display we're going somewhere the token must be displayed which is a public declaration that I my I am identified with the sacrifice and what Peter was saying is I'm not identified could you imagine and God understood that and said quote tell my disciples and Peter because they still a work for him to do and many of us have denied him in simple ways on our jobs you know schools and our lines some of us simple things we are afraid to pray for our meals in front of people some of the young people to just dress like a Christian you feel you you you you you're trying to fit in so much you deny him by wearing clothes you should not wear or even thinking the thoughts of whether you fit in it's a way of denying you because if you trust him and you are convinced and no devil could make you change your mind about your testimony as a Christian the token must be public there's no secret token there's no hidden token there's no this is between me and God token it must be a life display that people could know that he put a mark upon you he put a seal upon you he has approved you you identified with him and he's identified with you the devil must know your name oh you don't hear me this morning the devil must know your name the sons of sceva went to cast out Devils there was a Peter I know Paul I know who are you those Devils knew their names Heelys those names had a reputation in the kingdom of darkness I know Paul I know John I know the devil must know my name he must know your name the teller must know when you pray you get your prayer answered so don't mess with you come on now the devil must know that you live a sanctified life that you don't open the door or the window because you have applied a token over your house [Applause] [Music] she may be seated [Music] [Applause] [Music] applying of token it's a sign that you have cleaned up your society you I will beat you have a listen to the instruction you have done everything and now you are ready to say Lord I want to declare it he said uh prior to your children apply to your house applied and watch the transformation watch the deliverance a place is there anybody will supply it today [Music] friends before Jesus came they lived under the law and the law was almost accursed as it was upon mankind because no one was pure enough no one could be good enough no one could have been held accountable to living up to the entire law the law and type kind of almost held people in bondage because it showed the very imperfection of man but the blood of Jesus freed us from the curse of sin the curse of death the law have no completion today was a lamb tomorrow it was a dove next week it was a goat there was it never stopped trying to make up for it because the blood of the goat and sheep was was a temporary solution it was covering but the problem was still underneath it was covering but there was no transformation under there to win Jesus died that blood we moved to him removed remove the problem it no longer needed to be covered up because it took it on the sauce remove the can sorry move the problem to make way for the Spirit of God the only loss itself to follow the word the Holy Ghost said saltan because the Holy Ghost attracted sanctified life and the blood sanctified purified the blood cleans up in the Old Testament the high priest would sprinkle blood on the judgment seat made to be a mercy seat and this would the seven tons of blood is this bloody messages message that came to us dripping with blood has been sprinkled in this day our judgments eaten it means this mercy for your house its mercy for your family it's mercy for your marriage mercy for your children mercy for your mind mercy for your party [Music] hilli-ho testament many lands now it says one lamb a lamb without blemish a lamb that was different because he could identify with you in the Old Testament that lamb he he didn't even understand what was going on but this ma'am understood when the stripes was upon his back that it was being done for a purpose it was being done for your Redemption and he was thinking about us with every step that brought him closer to Calvary oh we were identified with every step because we should have been taking those steps we identify with every lash because we should have been the ones being last I'm finished friends catch the picture catch a bullet John wept because he's found there was nobody worthy until the word said behold the Lion of the tribe of Judah and here comes that bleep bloody lamb the mighty Conqueror God himself he got him off he himself yet changed his mask from God above to God with we spoke about it is so weekend he had to find a way to restore back what was lost in Genesis [Music] you know what he did for us we spoke about it he couldn't solve the problem in heaven because that jurisdiction that's his jurisdiction on earth the jurisdiction is handed to flesh-and-blood so only somebody from this jurisdiction could take dominion over what happens here not even the angels after his diction yeah [Music] this is our territory so God put on 16 elements so he would be qualified to be in dis Taurus diction to take away sickness to take aways and he had to be alone doctored could feel your pain and enjoy your suffering and feel tiredness and be tempted and the Bible said he resisted he was without sin temptation comes without sin this fear comes without sin tiredness comes without sin without blemish the perfect sacrifice and the devil didn't even recognize what was going on [Music] just like in Egypt that night open the doors to their freedom open the door to the Passover he fed them physically he came in one night he unlocked the keys for them and when Jesus died he had finished his first purpose but we spoke about the secret mission of God because he had to go down in the realm to take the keys from Sita he could not do it in 16 elements so he couldn't wait to die his death was not just your salvation his death was just not your Redemption but his death give him permission to drop even lower into the realm of the devlins shelf where you can walk up to Satan in his territory and that asked for mission but he took the keys of the devil's own Kingdom he took the keys of debts he took the keys of hell he took the keys of the grave what bondage are you in this morning there's no bondage because that land that perfect sacrifice he came to deliver your house he came to deliver your mind he became deliver your body he'll deliver your soul friends the redemption on Calvary there was a part of that that was a mystery that only we can identify with because Paul could have said death where is your sting grave where is your victory but Paul still went down to the ground because the curse of man required that man were to go into the ground but when Jesus took the keys of death and hell he made it possible for scriptures like we shall not all sleep because of men that because he no other keys at death hell and the grave he could now say listen you don't even need to go there but you can be changed this mortal to put on immortality this lamb that came oh oh [Applause] come finished column for a house the angel [Music] said I put a mark upon all those that sigh and cry for the abomination in the city because judgment is coming he said to begin at my sanctuary at the ancient man go through the camp and look for that mark go through Egypt and look for the token friends that investigation is happening right now he's moving from individual to individual house the house and he's not asking questions he's just looking for the talk he's not asking for an explanation he doesn't need it he just needs to see the token there's no time to ask what church you go to there's no time to ask how long you've been in a message there's no time to ask do you believe just a token just a token is it on display in your life is it on display in your house when your neighbor passes by your house can they see their lives or Christian can they see that church if your neighbors cannot see that there's something wrong [Music] a saint again friends if your neighbors cannot tell that you are Christian did something wrong because it's supposed to be on display if your coworkers do not know you are a Christian there is something wrong there must be a difference but the way you live it's not you being better than anybody but it's because he touched me and you know what poverty means to you you know have you accept that he died for you you know and accept it you are living on a second chance because if it wasn't for him you are going to hell if it wasn't for his Greece you are destined for hell if it wasn't for his mercy you'd be finished but mercy said no I'm not gonna let them go alone for every house yes your son might be in trouble yes your daughter might be in trouble but apply it her priority see Lord I plead the blood blood I put my son another blood I put my door down at the blood I put my family under the blood apply it apply it

amen present on the be seated [Music] well god bless you we have a little betrothal ceremony we're at a location today between John Mark booties and sister Trisha Ponte and this time I like them to come forward I stand before you want to get engaged done good for the both of them so I say a few words I wanna be doing scripture from Hosea chapter 2 verse 19 this is the Lord speaking and said I and I will be truck thee unto me for ever year will be truck thee unto me in righteousness and in judgment and in love and kindness and in mercies I will even be Trott thee unto me in faithfulness and thou shalt know the Lord praise the Lord engagement represents a serious promise of marriage on this world betras means to be engaged it is the highest the contract of the highest feet between a man and a woman to get married in the near future engagement is just an agreement where two parties decide to get married at a later date God Almighty promised to engage himself to his people that is why we are called the bride of Jesus Christ and had been engaged you're preparing to be married to the Son of God isn't that something tonight amen so because of his grace love for you and I God's love for you and I he made us a covenant arrangement that should not be broken marriages record engagement is recognized as a serious commitment it's a vow that the two parties before the people before gone in the Jewish time it was a tree seed step in which the parents family the agreement between two parties engagement and then afterwards the actual marriage praise the name of the Lord so therefore God sees this as an important step in the stage right now you are be trucked to Christ you are engaged to Christ you suppose I have no other person in your life nor the man in your life not a woman in your life no what I love in your life Christ's supposed to be your love Christ supposed to be your all and the beautiful message this morning that God said situation that you could demonstrate is trust in you your trust in him or other so if you believe out the whole plan then you would not have trusted it's not gonna work out but he set it in a way that you have to exercise
