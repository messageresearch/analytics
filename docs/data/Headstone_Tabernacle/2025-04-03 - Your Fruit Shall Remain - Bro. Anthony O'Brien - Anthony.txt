presence amen we are privileged people tonight amen so God bless you welcome all once again amen and we like to change now order of the service and have the word portion of it and uh thank you so much uh brother stevenh oliv for the music tonight and we want to turn to our Bibles to one portion of scripture from which we will draw all of our context tonight amen and um that is uh St John chapter 15 I'm reading from verse 16 there amen just the one verse so book of St John chapter 15 and verse 16 which says ye have not chosen me but I have chosen youen and ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain amen that whatsoever ye shall ask of the father in my name he may give it to you may God add blessing to the reading of his word let us bow our heads almighty God we thankful for your grace and mercy towards us Lord we are thankful for your word towards us father throughout generations and Lord and and times the world has remained constant dear God lord we know Lord father that we could rest or our soul upon it Lord for we know that in your hour of choosing you will manifest your word as you have promised so father we come gather around your word tonight Lord we pray oh God that your presence would come in a special way and anoint the word Lord and make it alive in the hearts of your people Lord pour out Faith Lord Revelation upon them Father and help them to see Lord and get into this father uh anointing for their time and season there God father Lord we just Look to You Lord we have no power of our own we have no strength of our own father we Look to You Lord For You are the author and finisher of our faith Lord and without you we can do nothing tonight Lord without you I just a m mortal tonight Lord but if you would come Lord and and and uh move Upon Us father in your own sweet way Lord we could uh Lord be fully immersed in the spirit Lord then we know anything is possible ible then because it happens by your spirit dear God father so may you come and minister to our hearts Lord as we wait upon you take me out of the way use the word tonight dear God father Lord as you have inspired it and may you bless us Lord as we wait to hear from you tonight in Jesus Christ's name we pray and ask it amen and amen you may have your seats praise godall amen amen praise God so for a title tonight uh from our scripture Our title is your fruit shall remain am that's the title tonight your fruit shall remain God yeah Jesus spoke in this verse here very assuredly he says to us that he has chosen us we have not chosen him but he has chosen us and more than that he has chosen us to bring forth fruit but even more than that he's going to make our fruit remain amen he's going to make it stay hallah uh he's going to bring you into a constant and fixed position in fruit bearing amen isn't that right so the objective I have here tonight uh and why we want to get into this text uh is because that how God sees fruitfulness this is what kind of came to me and this is how God sees fruitfulness and its connection to the reward of Labor to the reward of of doing the work uh your fruitfulness should be the evidence of the work that has been put in God is not going to spend time working on you if there's no fruit to get from the work that he's put in isn't that right when he spoke the world into existence after every day when he had created and done something uh the Bible said it was good and and God and the evening and the morning were the next day and and then he made this and he made that and it was good and and the morning and the evening were the next day and and so on it went on and I believe there's a reason for that because God is not going to just make anything haphazardly or do anything randomly and if he's going to do it it's a good job because he's a good God and whatever he makes is good whatever he does is good whatever he says is good all of nature is a reflection of the goodness of God so after he had made it with all of his Perfection and all that he had poured into it the Bible said he saw that it was good and then and only then it was finished isn't that right and so but there's something to say about fruitfulness you see and and I feel that there's this connection between me fruitfulness and the reward of Labor the reward of doing the work the reward of of getting it done isn't that right putting in the effort putting in the sacrifice putting together all of the skills the raw material that's involved in order to draw something from it it don't make no sense it's a most painful thing to to work uh to labor and to spend time uh and to spend money or resources or whatever it is and not be able to draw fruit from whatever it is that you're doing is the most I think it's the most sad condition a most painful thing to watch somebody work so hard and not get any fruit from after all their work and not be pleased or satisfied with their work men are wired like this we we we need to feel a sense of accomplish ment every day even if it means making up your bed in the morning you need to be able to feel like you did something today in order to lay ahead at night because it would bother you if you did nothing at all today uh and there's nothing to show for a 24-hour span of Life uh you have nothing to show for it and and nothing to account for it and I feel like God feels the same way about the time that is spent because time is not forever and and he uses time to fulfill his purpose he uses time to fulfill his word and even God knows time is not forever is just for a time and so he has to use that time in order to fulfill his word and his purpose and what he's trying to achieve and all of us are underg governed under time and we have to use the time we have that that's given to us in the wisest way so that we could actually bring forth fruit and this fruitfulness tonight is connected to reproduction is connected to reproducing if you understand what I'm saying in other words in the fruitfulness there is the secret of reproduction happening and taking forth in other words God has a desire to reproduce himself and he can't reproduce himself in an in a an environment that is stagnant or an environment that is not moving or static or where there's no process taking place for that reproduction God wants to make more of himself he wants to see more of himself unfolding in nature condescending in true nature and through the reflections of himself through man and through everything else that he has created and so therefore he created a process a a cyclical process of birth and death and reproduction so that things can go on and to produce itself because he wants to see more of himself unfold as time goes on and so he loves fruitfulness because it gives him the opportunity to reproduce himself isn't that right isn't that right and I wanted to preface this thought tonight that I have amen isn't that right and uh so when we get to the top of the tree there has to be a process to get to that harvest in order to obtain that reward there's a process that gets to that point where we can actually claim the fruit that is up there that's right uh it doesn't just beam out of the sky it didn't just happen you know it went through a process we live in a world today where we we we I don't think we really appreciate the process that it takes to get things you know um like I was speaking to a brother um you know and and and he had grown up long time ago and uh he was talking about how that uh you know clothes was so hard to come by you had something called your Sunday Best which you would wear um and then he said he grewed up in a a family with other brothers and they had one shirt and one pants a good shirt it was the best pants and that shirt and pants were shared among many brothers along with himself so that what he would do is when he didn't have the shirt and pants on he would have to put on something called a kazak I know nothing about this but apparently it's a flower bag that is tacked together in a most crude way um that that serves as a temporary form of dress uh until you could acquire this good shirt and pants that you could use to go out the road with uh uh and so he would have to wait for his brother to come back uh with the good shirt and with the good pants so that he could Now put on the same shirt and the same pants and go out and that's how it was I mean now you could go to the store and and get a shirt for $100 or buy a a trouser for one something get it cheap at the Chinese shop but to get that product took time somebody or something sold that thing together somebody spent time stitching it together they tested the product to make sure it was ready for you to wear but the problem is things are so mass-produced nowadays that you don't get to really appreciate that there's a process behind things the cell phone in your pocket was tested somebody turn it on they put all the parts together wherever they got it from China and Taiwan and different places they put it all together assembled all the parts tested the hard drive to make sure it worked run the battery once run this once run that once before you could even purchase it at the store but you are not aware of all of these processes and so when you take out your money to pay for an item now it goes over your head how much processes it took to get to this product to get on the Shelf whether it's a can of beans or a pack of tomato ketchup or whatever it is things are so easily mass-produced and so being thrown around you know and just like easy to acquire it seems whereas a long time ago people would have to uh plant a tree and and and wait for the fruit to come where they would have to take care of cows and and and get the milk from the cow in order to have something to drink where people have to take care of chickens in order to have the eggs so that they could have breakfast that morning people just go down to the Chinese store and just buy whatever they want for a dollar and come back and they don't appreciate that there's a process that it takes to get it on the Shelf but God's process of things have never changed throughout the years regardless of how technology and how things have advanced and moved ahead of its time in science and education and Technology God has certain processes God has certain processes in place in order to bring Sons into character in order to bring men and women in shape for a Revival he has a process for that it takes prayer it takes supplication it takes sanctification it takes getting close to God it takes a relationship it takes a everyday beating the road it takes a a planting it takes a sewing they that sewing chairs shall reap in Joy those rules have not changed no matter how much Society has changed no matter how much the world has changed and the way to acquire things have changed God hasn't changed tonight and his word is still the same and what he's asking of us is for a sacrifice Hallelujah to go through a process Hallelujah so that you could come out on the Mountaintop so that your worship will be different so that when you sing them songs you will sing it with a depth of reality and understanding that for every Every Mountain he brought you over there's something to give God praise for for every Valley he brought you through tears of revelation will stream down your eyes because you will know that he brought you through it oh hallelujah hallelujah you've got a testimony you're not just singing a song you're not just reading the Bible but it's alive to you because you see him in your walk you see him in your talk he's in the midst of your process oh oh Hallelujah he passed you through the valley of Baker hallelujah hallelujah Hal he passed you through certain things to get you closer to the master to make you understand that to get you to where you need to be you need to go through a process to appreciate the Harvest in the end Hallelujah to appreciate the fruit in the end and moreover like we we saying tonight your fruit shall remain M amen God doesn't just want you to bring forth fruit and then that's it no you continue to bring forth fruit continue to burd continue to Blossom no season come season go your fruit is going to remain that is the condition we're going to actually come into at the end of this process tonight amen so I want us to appreciate that now uh and and understand that God has a way of doing things amen uh you know and it's it's uh brother overo f is God's a school of character development uh it's not a school that uh you can uh pay money to get into um there's no physical building God just takes you by the hand and says walk with me and be therefore perfect he he takes you every single day uh uh uh through every Mountain through every experience and you just have to trust and know that he's at the end of all of this you're going to come out right you just have to trust and know because because because he's going to take you to places you don't want to go he's going to take you to places that don't seem Pleasant at all but you just have to trust that whoever is leading you is going to take you through it and we know that God is a good god tonight whatever he takes us through is for all good isn't that right so I wanted to preface this thought tonight with this with this quote from the prophet from a guide Hallelujah and he said that the holy spirit always speaks of the word he said I've got many things to tell you you cannot understand it now am but when he comes he'll guide you to it that's the reason for the coming of the seals at the finishing of the seven seal the Myster of God should be finished amen for what for to know who God is what he is how he lives his nature and his being let's say that one more time the purpose at the end of the mystery of God should be finished at the finishing of the seventh seal he we should know who God is what he is how he lives his nature and his being Prophet said you're supposed to be all the way up there at that by that time see bringing us into the full stature of Sons and Daughters of God a church that is washed in the blood of Christ that's bought without money and is paid for by the blood of Jesus Christ isn't that right so during this process at the end of it we are supposed to know who God is what he is isn't that right and God sent us a prophet to reveal every mystery so that we could know who God is and what he is isn't that right to know that he God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth isn't that right that he has a purpose that he has a desire something he's trying to achieve one purpose in doing it isn't that right Hallelujah that mystery that was hid from ages and generations is now being revealed which is Christ in you the hope of glory to know his nature to know his being second Peter 1 4-7 faith and virtue and and knowledge and temperance know the seven part nature of God so that tonight we can be brought into the full manifestation of Sons and Daughters of God in the last days isn't that right that's the purpose of it so so God wants us to be fruitful tonight he wouldn't go through all the trouble of bringing us out and establishing us if we weren't fruitful because in there is how he will reproduce himself in there is how he will make more like him make more Sons like like like how he had in in the in the Garden of Eden isn't that right Hallelujah and and and so on so and so if we're not yeah so God wants us to be fruitful he wouldn't go through all the trouble right if we're not bringing forth some form of profit or increase there has to be a purpose behind it isn't that right and God will achieve his purpose amen so everything serves a purpose right what purpose is a tree that brings forth no fruit the same is heun and and cut down and uprooted and cast Into the Fire isn't that right amen I never forget that time when dad had planted a tree in the in in the in the middle of the garden and he was so excited because it was supposed to be a lime tree or a lemon tree of some kind and uh we waited and the tree sprung up and looked good and it was blooming and getting into itself but after after the first year there was no fruit after the second year no fruit third year no fruit and at some point he was like here's what this thing is just occupying space let us uproot it and put something else in its place and I was part of the uprooting process which was quite interesting um but but that's the way it is you see you wouldn't you you're putting up space you're making space for this thing you have such great expectations for it and then all of a sudden there's nothing to get from it that's just a great dissatisfaction I could imagine how Jesus felt when when they were passing by that fig tree and he was hungry his stomach was in his hand and he's coming up to the frig tree to get something from it because he is hoping to satisfy his natural hunger he is hoping to satisfy to satisfy something within but the tree has nothing to offer him and the Bible said he cursed the fig tree Hallelujah to the roots by the time they came back the next day it had dried up from the roots and the disciples marveled at this isn't that right praise God Amen Hallelujah and I believe God does these things to show us that God's desire and intent praise God is very clear he wants fruitfulness he wants multiplication he said in blessing I Will Bless thee and in multiplying I will multiply unto thee as the sand that is on the seashore and as the stars that is in the heaven oh you can't count those Stars you can't count the sand so shall thy seed be oh Hallelujah so shall my word be it shall not return void but it shall accomplish and there'll be blessing after blessing fire after fire anointing after anointing oh Hallelujah when God gets us in alignment with the word of God for our day when God is ready to release his Spirit upon us oh HW brother Brandon said what we seen work in a small measure will be in its fullness when that time comes it will be power after power wave after wave of the glory of God hit in the Earth the dead in Christ will rise up oh up will come brother branam up will come Wesley up will come Luther oh what a power is getting ready to strike the church in the last days oh God wants us to be fruitful and multiply oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to Goden amen amen thank you Lord hallelujah when God created man he commissioned his fruit in in that man isn't that right let's read it Genesis 1:26 and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the foul of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth and so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and Fe female created he them and God blessed them verse 28 and God said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth and subdue it oh in other words overcome it overrun it oh hallel with more beings just like yourself you have a commission God spoke to man this isn't flesh man yet but this is that Spirit man that he had created oh Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah not that flesh man yet not yet Adam flesh man but the spirit man that came before isn't that right amen amen amen hallelujah he told that man be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth in other words make more just like yourself Hallelujah Hal isn't that right and the Mystery of how that was to be done was there yet to be unfolded but he still spoke it over it over the being isn't that right over man over the spirit man he spoke it over them he breathed upon them the promise that they were to receive and to reproduce and to do isn't that right oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah and God's word cannot return void he has already spoken it over this man beinging so if tonight we ever get back into the image and likeness of God like what it had in the beginning then we come right back into our commission again to be fruitful and to multiply and to make more like these oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right God objective to bring us back into that condition an image of likeness of God seven spirits that has been released throughout all the Earth to bring us back into that condition isn't that right oh hallelujah hallelujah and I have in here Psalms 1 which is like a blueprint to getting us back into this condition let's read it it says Psalms 1 blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of the Sinners nor sth in the seat of the scornful in other words this man that is walking is walking separate and apart he is cutting himself away from the seat of the scornful away from the way of The Sinner away from the world and their natural progression and pattern of things this man that God is calling tonight is not walking in the Council of the ungodly oh but he is walking in the counsel of God he is walking in the word he is walking in righteousness he is walking in Purity he is walking in love oh hallelujah hallelujah God separated us from our mother's womb God knew who you was way back in your grandfather father's lineage because he was going to call you out and choose you and predestinated you he said you have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordained you to bring forth fruits and that your fruit shall remain oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh that's what it means god predestinated you out of millions in the world they were lost when you were save God elected you oh put his wedding band of Grace upon your finger and release you into the world you didn't know who you was you didn't know where you come from you were just wandering through but the seed of God that is in you the seed of God that remained inside of you that seed had a destination that seed had a one-way ticket that seed has a Hallelujah a to go back to its creator no matter how many Devils come your way that seed is present tonight it's got to receive uh the fullness of Jesus Christ that's got to receive uh the baptism of the Holy Ghost I don't care what doubts I don't care what fear I don't care what mind battle I don't care what the devil say I'm going to praise my God anywhere in the midst of trial in the midst of Sorrow in the midst of Tempest in the midst of storm The Anchor Holds oh grips the solid Rockall hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah there Anchor Holds tonight oh every trial every test that he has passed you through only proves that that Anchor Holds oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah you wouldn't understand the joy of it if you didn't go through the pain of it you wouldn't appreciate the Worship On The Mountain if you didn't go through the darkness and the thorns and thistles of the valley but God pass us through to prove that his love is greater that his love is stronger that his right arm and His holy hand will get you the victory in every Tri in every test through every pain of circumstance it only proves oh Hallelujah that God is faithful and that his word is faithful oh and it's you every morning oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God that's why the devil laughs sorry that's why God laughs at the Devil I believe amen because he's devil is busy trying to throw you down and God knows what he put in inside of you the devil is busy trying to discourage you and God is laughing because he knows what he put inside of you it might look like you defeated it might look like you can't make it it might look like you can't overcome oh Hallelujah but the match is not over the game is not over yet oh Hallelujah might be getting knocked up in the ring but the match is not over yet you still got one more move tonight what's it going to be Hallelujah rise up in faith tonight oh find that weak point in the enemy Jam him right there oh Hallelujah he can't take the word hallelujah hallelujah we might have lost a few battles but the war is not over yet we still got one more round again amen amen this is the final round no matter how much points you lost there's always something called The Knockout The Knockout crowns everything don't care how much you're losing don't don't care how much you are behind by there's something called a knockout punch that's what we're going for we're going for the juggler we're going for that last great kill watch your enemy look at his footwork oh Hallelujah Know The Enemy at every one of his tricks and when he begins to make the move get ready to size up because the word of God will defeat the enemy anywhere anytime under any circumstance and you were raised up for such a time as this oh hallelujah hallelujah oh glory glory glory amen amen oh Hallelujah blessed is the man oh I believe there's a man here tonight amen but his Delight is in the law of the Lord in the law is his the light and in that La do he meditate day and night oh meditate you're focused on it oh hallelujah it's not like some kind of Hindu meditation no no we just focusing on the word seeing watching what he has said and as he we think of him and we as we talk about him his presence comes as we pray on him and think on him his presence comes and Grace himself unfolds his own word to you unfold it through his gifts manifold gifts that he had placed in the body isn't that right oh and all these things is for our benefit praise God hallelujah we are meditating putting aside every other distraction day and night that is the condition of this man isn't that right and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water oh this is where we want to get to now God wants to plant us this is not a temporary fixation this is not just a short stint no no no no God wants to plant you God wants to dig a hole and put you in it put half of you in it take a hole and establish you in there and cover it up and mold you up in it and let you stay there and abide there and find your roots there and spread out there and catch yourself oh Hallelujah and come into yourself God loves when his sons come into themselves oh when they begin to get mature when they begin to get ripened when they begin to come into this original condition oh the man that he had made amen glory amen in Genesis 1 there was no mention of Adam it only said the man we shall make man in our image man in our likeness this is the back part amen but about that uh Friday night this is the back part the front part is the part you see that's the visible tangible things that you could appreciate with your eyes oh but the back part oh H was the original part oh that was the seab bed that was a rock bed that was a foundation that gave life to what you saw on the surface praise God it's only because of a deeper mystery a deeper truth and when the Breath of God was put into that man flesh man then Man became a living soul but it was what went into that man that made that man who he was amen and when he fell out of that condition even though there was a flesh man there because the spirit was now Twisted because it was now bent it could not no longer hold the authority that was once given to it because something was out of place in the back Parts isn't that right amen God wants to fix us tonight fix our hidden Parts hide in us his word that we might not sin against him he wants to fix us in our secret places tonight tonight oh if we would only open the door if we'd only go in Beyond the Veil drop the door behind us get into our prayer closets and let God speak to us oh and work in us and shape us and mold us oh Hallelujah and draw us closer to him amen and abide in him praise God isn't that right amen then we could bring forth fruit and our fruit will remain isn't that right so a tree planted by the rivers of water planted situated in a specific location not in the middle of nowhere it's not planting God is Not planting you um you know by a wall somewhere or to make you look good by somebody no no he has a purpose for doing it uh he had Rivers out of Eden there were rivers that were coming out that was giving life to all the Earth and everything else around it Eden was specifically uh strategically located by a river praise God that they were fruits and veget ation and flowers and God is very strategic he's purposeful in what he's doing and when God says he wants to plant this man like a tree near rivers of water the purpose is for you to always be nourished by the water that is coming through doesn't matter what seasons come and Seasons go you are where the water source is oh Hallelujah and your fruits will always be coming in oh Hallelujah no matter what Wasa say no matter what this one say or that one say whether the government put in infrastructure or not you don't have nothing to do with that you are strategically plac by the rivers of water oh Hallelujah not a drain not a faucet but Rivers oh hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right we don't have enough Rivers here in Trinidad for us to describe what a river really looks like some of us still thinking about the drain being back of our house that's not what talking about we're talking about rivers bodies of water going down praise God Unstoppable pray isn't that right Mangrove and giving life to every type of bird and every type of crustation and every type of manity in the in the water and everything else there's a Riverside crocodiles dwell by the Riverside looking for things to eat all nature even man worshiped the river at one time because they thought it was a source of life not knowing that it was God that created a river that there was a God and in charge of all of these things that they see around them and that God is still here tonight that God hallelujah there is a river tonight that flows from deep within and if you ever getting connected with God out of that rough of your belly shall flow rivers of Living Water oh you're going to be connected to that River if you could ever abide in him tonight oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh glory glory glory glory amen and amen hallelujah isn't that right oh my that bringeth forth fruit in his season his Leaf also shall not wither and whatever he do shall prosper he's going to bring forth fruit in his season because you're connected to the Water Source isn't that right you're where right where he needs it to be amen and it's just only a matter of time until his word is fulfilled isn't that right okay well I think we've got it here amen wonderful so St John 7 and 37 Jesus says in this scripture here and the last day in that great day of the feast Jesus stood and cried saying if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink and he that believeth on me as the scripture said out of his belly shall flow Rivers of living water and then the Bible goes on to say in verse 39 but this spake he of the spirit which they had yet they they they that believe on him should Reed for the Holy Ghost was not yet given oh so this was a prophecy of this rivers of Living Water to come out of you this was a prophecy of the Holy Ghost doing a work in the individual but it was not yet given even though it was not yet given Jesus still spoke it over them oh that if any man believe on me as the scripture had said then out of his belly out of the depth of him oh shall flow rivers of Living Water oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh John went up to that angel and he took the scroll and he ate it and in his mouth it was sweet as honey but when it D down into the belly it was bitter it was bitter he had to digest it he had to go through a stage of baress oh th must prophesy again because out of that same belly God is going to flow rivers rivers of Living Water oh hallelujah hallelujah oh testing and trial only for a time but God will manifest his word and break the silence hallelujah oh my amen hallelujah he does it in his name glory to God is not right so God's desire for us is to bring forth fruit hallelujah amen isn't that right and not only that but that our fruit should remain it will it will stay it will keep on bearing no matter what trial you go through no matter what anyone says to you you're going to keep on producing fruit no matter how people laugh at you you're going to keep on producing knowledge keep on producing godliness keep speaking godliness to them keep speaking them teaching them uh uh uh treating them with Temperance with with with patience with knowledge as the prophet said knowing what's in the brother's heart but still go in the extra mile with them anyway patience with them brotherly kindness with them going in Walking In Their Shoes understanding it from their Viewpoint being as Christ to them love one another Jesus said as I have loved you oh hallelujah hallelujah and abide in his love that is how you're going to bring forth fruit oh Hallelujah more fruit and much fruit amen isn't that right and multiply and reproduce Christ right in this fruitfulness right in that atmosphere there is God's Outlet to reproduce himself isn't that right so it speaks of a state of permanence that's fruit is going to remain isn't that right amen and God wants to establish in us a permanent situation isn't that right to make you like a pillar in the house of God to set you in there isn't that right not just go in and come in and up and down but but God wants to set you fixed in there oh and when he puts you in there he pours fire upon it to confirm and seal it in oh Hallelujah so you go no more out oh Hallelujah but set in a fixed condition oh you go through a process water then blood oh but down comes a spirit the fire of the Living God to set you in there oh to make it fixed to make it caramelized to make it perfect to cize that thing inside oh Hallelujah that the devil can't take it out no trial can take it out you can't boil it out you can't run it out you can't take it out Hallelujah you are fixed Hallelujah David said my heart is fixed oh God hallelujah oh hallelujah oh Hallelujah glory to God amen amen that's what we want to be tonight amen so you want to establish something permanent in us and right now state is variable isn't that right we have a perfect standing through the blood of Jesus Christ but right now our state is variable one day we're up one day we're down one day we feel like a Christian and then the next day we don't oh but God wants to change that one of these days you're going to walk and realize that God is in you and that you no longer thinking your own thoughts oh Hallelujah but you'll be thinking the thoughts of God what he says about you what he says about your brother what he says about your wife what he thinks about your husband you'll think those thoughts oh hallelujah hallelujah and then you'll walk like God you'll act like God oh it won't be hard then the devil will be on the Run oh because you'll be in alignment with purpose and desire of God amen amen amen hallelujah and we are promised to come into this state amen that ought to put a smile on our face amen it might look like it now devil but we are coming into that state one of these days oh I can't hang on my own ability it is not by my might or my own power but by my spirit sayeth the Lord of hosts oh Hallelujah because the Holy Ghost has been released oh and out of your belly will flow rivers of Living Water what was prophesied then will become a fulfillment today amen and amen do you believe it oh my amen yes yes a state of permanence Prophet said here on Blasphemous names now coming from the Holy Spirit what is come well then he'll give you Supernatural fith spiritual fate that hair at the bottom and then that spiritual fate only recognizes the word no matter what anyone else says it don't do no good that only knows the word oh that's the only thing we know tonight is the word of God Amen is what he promised if anybody says the days of Miracles has passed that fate only knows the word somebody says there's no such thing as a baptism of the Holy Ghost that Faith only knows the word oh God said I'm going to receive the Holy Ghost and if God said it I believe it that Faith only recognizes the word devil says you can't be healed shut up devil that Faith only recognizes the word devil says my wife can be delivered my son can be delivered shut up devil that Faith only recognizes the word that's the reason I came out tonight that's the reason I put on my shoes because my faith only recognizes the word it doesn't recognize how I feel doesn't recognize the infirmities in my body oh count it all as not oh Hallelujah but it only recognizes the word tonight and the word says that you're are going to be healed the word says you're going to be delivered your word says is going to be restored the word says there's going to be a Revival the word hallelujah oh in the beginning was a word oh Hallelujah isn't that right oh and that word cannot return vo it shall accomplish tonight amen amen that Faith only knows the word that's real spiritual Faith you see that's right it only knows the word oh give us that real spiritual fith tonight amen amen how this is that right he says then that was number one he said number one coming to you your mental fate right here coming to your mental fate comes the Holy Ghost down into your mental fate making it a spiritual fith and then the spiritual Faith only recognizes that word and he said now on number two uh three he said then you'll have uh spiritual you'll have the Holy Spirit he said and will'll seal all these things into you oh seal all these things up into you as the Holy Spirit covers this he says from Faith all the way up to the Holy Spirit he said it seals you in with Christ oh hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right that's what we're looking for to happen in the last days the Holy Spirit itself will come down and seal all these virtues up into you isn't from Faith all the way up to Holy Spirit he's going to seal you up isn't right he said and then you become one amen he said get this thing out of my way he said you become one he said see you and Christ live together he said and at that day you will know that I am in the father and the father in me and I in you and you in me see then that is a sealed unit of the Lord God and he said now and then they are Vindicated and placed that's you and I when we come into that uh process says we are Vindicated and plac and he said when that time takes place then they become Vindicated Sons and Daughters of God when we go through that process amen amen isn't that right oh my what a promise Prophet said an ordination he said remember Les this lesson is morning this morning's lesson okay so he comes in the evening service now of Blasphemous names and he speaks it again just what we read here just now he says and remember this morning's lesson uh these uh virtues has to be in there before the Capstone will ever come on it see he said oh you might shout you might sing you might speak your tongues and dance that has nothing at all to do with it he said but until these things scripturally proven and are sealed into you the Holy Spirit seals you in as an individual oh and then you're a son and daughter of God isn't that right amen he said we've heard people speak with tongues that didn't have the Holy Ghost he said you know that he said I've heard witches speak in tongues he said Witch Doctors speak in tongues and drink blood out of human skull and call on the devil yes sir he said so he say I've seen witches Wizards see the time that that pencil was laid down and run up and down the stove pipe and played a shav and hair played that shaven haircut and write in unknown tongues somebody made a pencil animate isn't that right and a guy standing there and just scribble up and down and write and tell exactly what it was saying and and he said now you know that ain't God he said you know all those things he said So speaking in tongues don't mean that you're of God he said working of Miracles don't prove that you're of God he said but it's the thing the thing the fruits of the spirit that proves that you're in God when you see that life sealed Away by the Holy Ghost then that is what proves that you are in God oh hallelujah amen so we're not looking for speaking in tongues in that sense or running up and down no but we've got to see that life signs of that life being emanating from you oh then the fruit will be the evidence that that spirit is in you amen isn't that right that's what we wanted to get to tonight amen being fruitful and multiply that our fruits could come in and that fruit will be evidence of the spirit of God that is working in you amen amen because Jesus said by your fruits you're going to know them isn't that right oh God let it be he says let that be us if we've done sin may the great Heavenly Father forgive us for it he said isn't that right he wants to establish something in US means he also wants to abide in us they believe that tonight Psalms 91 says he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the almighty and I will say of the Lord he is my refuge my Fortress and my God and in him will I trust oh we're not trusting in nobody else tonight but we are trusting in the Lord tonight to perfect that which concerns us tonight amen they believe it he who started the work is able to complete it in us tonight surely he shall deliver thee From The Snare of the Fowler and from the noisome pestilence and he shall cover thee with his feathers and under his wings shalt thou trust his truth shall be thy shield and buckler Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night nor for The Hour That flyth by day nor for the pestilence that walth in darkness nor for the destruction that wasteth at noon day A thousand shall fall at thy side and 10,000 at thy right hand but it shall not come n thee Only With Thine Eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked because thou has made the Lord which is my refuge even the most high thy habitation you see it there God will fight for you when you abide in him he's going to take care of everything else once you are abiding in him seek ye first tonight the kingdom of God and all those other things will be taken care of all the other things will be added to you if we could only abide oh Hallelujah in him tonight oh do you believe it glory to God Prophet said on three kinds of Believers that's the reason I do believe that when the bride is called out and elected and set in The Book of Life there will come a sound from Heaven that will take such a baptism of the Holy Spirit into that bride oh that it will take her from the earth in a rapturing Grace God promise it oh did he promise it tonight oh that when that bride is called out this is a prophecy oh and I believe tonight it's coming into view that when that bride is called out when she's elected and when she's set in The Book of Life there's going to come a sound from Heaven that will take such a baptism of the Holy Spirit into that bride that it'll take her up from the earth in a rapturing Grace called God promis it brother bam said don't care how many science how many astronauts they signed and everything else how many million of miles they can see he said I don't care nothing about that he said there is a heaven and there is a literal Jesus Christ that there will come in a body form to receive his church to himself no matter how old the story seems oh no matter how oldfashioned it's still the truth he said God said so and that is what Believers believe oh do you believe it tonight oh God promis it he is the same God that promis it he's big enough to keep his promise tonight he's big enough to fill you with a glorious wonderful baptism of the Holy Ghost and Fire oh Hallelujah can we praise him tonight Hallelujah God said Hallelujah I am the Lord that heals all thy diseases I am God and I change not Amen brother B says and God is and God is the word and if God don't change then how is the word going to change he said see he said I am God and I change not and the scriptures said that and God said it himself and if he cannot change then he is the word he said in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and Word was God the unchangeable word oh that word promise your deliverance that word promise your breakthrough that word promis your healing what is it the unchangeable word from an unchangeable God oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah he said and that word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us amen yes sir isn't that right glory to God Jesus says here in Matthew 7 bew of false prophets which come to you in sheep's clothing because inwardly they are ravening wolves he says he said but you shall know them by their fruits he said do men gather Grapes of thorns or figs or thistles he said even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit he said but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit and he said every tree that bringeth forth not good fruit is heun down and cast into the fire oh that is the fate of that tree isn't that right and Jesus says again here he said wherefore by their fruits you shall know them oh so there's coming a Time friends where the fruits is going to come in and then you're going to know who is who then you're going to know where the sheep and the goat is isn't that right oh then that will be the separation then because the manifestation will be the interpretation and the reflection will be the Perfection isn't that right by your fruits you will know who is who when that time comes isn't that right it's going to come down to a proven time where the spirit of God will prove who is true and who is false Vine isn't that right amen and amen my God in adoption the prophet said here adoption placing positionally oh let me try to wind up here oh You' been so great tonight amen I think we just have a few more and that's it oh so it's real good amen wow so we thank God adoption he said now uh in adoption 1960 he said adoption placing positionally where are they at show me where they at oh God is calling his children aside by manifestation he said they don't have to say one word about it he said you see something has happened amen don't have to say one word about it God will prove it on the spot isn't that right positionally placing his son getting him into order just exactly with the same things he's just uh as much in Authority his words just as good as an archangel or better Prophet saidah the son was adopted he said he was put on a high place set out there Chang his robes change his colors the father had a ceremony said this is my son and from henceforth he's governed he's ruler he's over all of my Heritage amen and all that I got belongs to him oh Hallelujah isn't that right he said then we could go back to the same a Elohim see where he is self-existent he said and then he come back through Jehovah who made something isn't that right spoke it into existence and he gave man dominion over the Earth he said what are we waiting for the manifestations Manifest ations of the sons of God he said because the Earth is groaning oh groaning and travailing tonight waiting for the sons of God to come into manifestation oh Hallelujah isn't that right waiting for Sons to take up their rightful position oh the Earth is the Lords and the fullness thereof and all they that dwell therein God has a power over all Thrones all dominions all powers all principalities all all kingdoms oh when Jesus walked the Earth he humbled himself yet he was King over everything but he didn't have a place to lay his head he wandered the streets oh Hallelujah and God took care of him yet he was King over everything and Pontius Pilate talk up to him and said whose King are you are you the king of the Jews and he knew that he was King over everything yet he subjected himself to the word and suffered many things for God's name and for the sake of the people oh Hallelujah to be saved by the cross he went through suffering oh he subjected himself to the Cross he objected himself to obedience and said not my will but thy will be done he brought himself to surrender oh H humility before crowning he was forsaken before he became king oh oh and the same God I was brought down he was raised up on the third day oh Hallelujah and was Victorious rose up a mighty conqueror and that same Jesus is here tonight and said as my father had sent me even so send I you oh Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah the power that he raised him up with that same power God's going to put inside of you and make you Kings and make you priests and make you connected uh to this Redemption plan uh to this Redemption story oh Hallelujah there's a place by him tonight oh just abide in him tonight abide in his word abide in his presence stay in the atmosphere oh Hallelujah abide in me and my word abide in you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you oh oh hallelujah hallelujah hallah there's a promise for those that abide in him tonight the longer you stay you're going to move from no fruits to having fruits then you're going to move from fruits to having more fruits then you move from more fruits to much fruits as you stay in his presence oh as you are connected Hallelujah to that vine oh Hallelujah Jesus said I am the vine and my father is a husband man Jesus is the life oh Hallelujah pray Life of Christ that wants to flow into your branch and make you produce fruits more fruit and much fruit and God is the husband man tonight he has the pruning knife in his hand he is walking around the earth tonight looking for branches who want to be cut who want to be pruned who want to be shaped oh who could take the pruning will bring forth fruits they bring forth more fruits bring forth much fruit oh God is on the earth tonight oh I can see the husband man with the pruning knife in his hand it takes a skilled husbandman

ye are the branches you can place Them Softly he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me he can do nothing if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and withered and Men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned but but but if he abide in me and my words abide in you he shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you
