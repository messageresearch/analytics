[54:40] worshiped you need have other

[54:46] about the Battle
[54:48] of altars sacrifices and trees amen and
[54:53] that is what is happening right here
[54:55] right now
[54:57] we come Jesus told the one well woman we
[55:00] know what we worship we know who we
[55:02] worship for salvations of the Jews and
[55:06] when you come to church you have to come
[55:07] to show you know who you're
[55:11] worshiping some Churches they worshiping
[55:13] Devils there's all kind of contrary
[55:15] Spirits behind the scenes but Jesus said
[55:18] we know what we worship we worshiping
[55:20] the Living God the one who wake us up
[55:23] this morning the one who Quicken us
[55:25] today the one who kept us alive and

[55:40] this morning he's alive to confirm his
[55:42] word he's allive to vindicate his word
[55:45] that's the God we serve this morning oh
[55:48] blessed be the name of the
[55:50] Lord
[55:51] hallelujah Bible speaks about men going
[55:53] to be hey and high minded lovers of
[55:55] Pleasures more than lovers of God they
[55:57] have their own Gods I used to call it
[55:58] the god of their own imagination the god
[56:00] of their mind the god of their thinking
[56:02] they have their own God as an idol they
[56:05] could worship a car as a god a house as
[56:07] a god a woman as a god a husband as a
[56:10] God your children as a god money as a
[56:12] god anything you can make a god once you
[56:15] have that how they call it inordinate
[56:17] affection for things giving giving
[56:20] things more attention than God deserves
[56:22] and he deserves all the glory all the
[56:24] honor 70 years is short thing three 10
[56:27] is a short thing you know because
[56:28] thousand years is just one day so that
[56:30] 70 years and that 100 years or 90 years
[56:33] a little
[56:34] flash a little FL just a little light
[56:37] come on just we we passing like little
[56:39] flashes in God's sight just born and you
[56:43] out what God see know lights flash out
[56:46] flash
[56:48] out oh praise God so it's good to be
[56:52] here this morning amen and I want to I
[56:55] know brother is said it I want to really
[56:57] appreciate you and your support for the
[56:58] convention it was a tremendous
[57:04] time and uh I was so happy to see how
[57:07] all these different Brothers uh came
[57:10] with what's upon on their heart and they
[57:12] were able to freely share it uh to the
[57:15] people of God and God did Bless but a
[57:18] common underline team there was the Holy
[57:20] Ghost I was so tremendously blessed uh
[57:23] last Sunday brother Isaac's message I
[57:26] think is one of the greatest messages
[57:27] I've heard him
[57:29] preach the battle of the altars priests
[57:33] and
[57:34] sacrifices nobody could break that
[57:37] nobody could break that but that's is
[57:40] what Elijah said you know let the god
[57:42] that answer by fire let him be God you
[57:46] have your God show off with your God
[57:49] show the power of your God and we will
[57:51] show the power of our God sacrifice
[57:54] versus sacrifice altar versus altar
[57:58] priest versus priest because you cannot
[58:00] go to the altar unless you are priest so
[58:03] for them to offer they have to be
[58:05] priests Oh Glory to God all the
[58:07] Hollywood people they have priests I was
[58:09] listening to testimony war in Africa she
[58:12] was in Nollywood or whatever they call
[58:14] the African Nigerian ollywood and they
[58:16] wanted to offer a sacrifice and she says
[58:20] the more unclean she live the more men
[58:23] she go and sleep with the more doors
[58:25] open for her
[58:26] so they're pulling it into this sexual
[58:29] depravity in order for God for for for
[58:32] the for doors to open and when her final
[58:35] break came she went through all kind of
[58:37] stuff they wanted to sacrifice her and
[58:40] she said that God come and delivered her
[58:44] because they say after the sacrifice her
[58:45] her record or the movie going be a big
[58:48] hit because have got to ser and that God
[58:51] want offering that offering is blood do
[58:55] you understand what I'm saying and when
[58:57] Jesus had to pay the price he had to
[58:58] offer blood this one man offer up his
[59:02] own blood as a sacrifice once for our
[59:07] Redemption who is worthy to take the
[59:10] book you can't take the book without a
[59:12] price it was a blood price that was
[59:14] required and no man could pay that price
[59:17] but the lamb was found worthy and he
[59:20] died that's why he have a right to judge
[59:22] this world because he died himself to
[59:25] pay a penalty to give you an opportunity
[59:28] to come with your foolishness and your
[59:30] nonsense not to be a church member oh
[59:32] give the Lord a shout that's why he
[59:34] going to be angry that's why he going to
[59:36] be vengeful that's why his rra going to
[59:38] be
[59:38] heavy Oh Glory to God because he came
[59:41] down he became flesh he paid a price you
[59:45] was going to hell when he paid that
[59:47] price how dare you not worship him oh
[59:51] give the Lord how dare you not give him
[59:53] praise how dare you not honor him
[59:56] yes buy whether you feel like it or not
[1:00:00] whe you feeling sick or not where you
[1:00:02] feeling good or not this morning it
[1:00:03] doesn't matter he's still worthy he is
[1:00:07] still God with all your problems he is
[1:00:10] still God oh give the Lord I shout

[1:06:59] old right they call me a senior and I
[1:07:02] have low tolerance for
[1:07:09] foolish
[1:07:12] watch this must be an altar at the
[1:07:15] Garden of Eden yes sir do you remember
[1:07:17] both can and Abel came up to
[1:07:20] worship oh they came up at the altar to
[1:07:22] worship that's right watch so that shows
[1:07:25] that God's altar was moved and set here
[1:07:29] at the Garden of Eden and the only way
[1:07:33] back to Eden is by the
[1:07:36] altar here you are again back to Eden
[1:07:40] through the alt and they were to keep
[1:07:43] the way to get it and they couldn't get
[1:07:46] back there until this altar was covered
[1:07:48] with
[1:07:49] blood oh God can people see it nothing
[1:07:53] but the blood there has to be an
[1:07:55] atonement a mercy seat this altar of
[1:07:58] judgment must become a mercy seat and
[1:08:01] when this altar its blood is lifted then
[1:08:04] distance judgment so all this I know it
[1:08:07] was the blood Amazing Grace all that swe
[1:08:10] the song and so on that's as long as
[1:08:11] blood is on the altar but once that
[1:08:13] blood is removed
[1:08:14] judgment and now I understand and more
[1:08:17] getting to understand more and more the
[1:08:19] justice of
[1:08:21] [Music]

[1:09:16] you will realize I'm reading the same
[1:09:17] scripture this morning the whole from 1
[1:09:19] to 11 but it was right out of what I

[1:09:24] you going I said what you preaching he
[1:09:26] say examples and he give me the script
[1:09:27] say wow that is something anyhow 1
[1:09:31] Corinthians 10:1 moreover Brethren I
[1:09:33] would not that ye should be ignorant how
[1:09:36] that our fathers were under the cloud
[1:09:38] all passed through the sea and were all
[1:09:40] baptized into the Moses in the cloud in
[1:09:42] the sea same message same book same
[1:09:44] tapes all did eat the same spiritual
[1:09:46] meat all drink the same spiritual drink
[1:09:49] they drank of that spiritual rock that
[1:09:50] followed them that rock was Christ and
[1:09:52] many of them God was not well pleased
[1:09:55] though they any message for they were
[1:09:56] overthrown in the wilderness and these
[1:09:59] things were our examples to the intent
[1:10:02] we should not lost after evil things as
[1:10:05] they lusted need to be Idols as was some
[1:10:09] of them as it is written the people sat
[1:10:11] down to eat and drink they had fast food
[1:10:14] in them times they can talky whatever it
[1:10:16] and Rose up to play neither let us
[1:10:18] commit fornication of some of them
[1:10:20] committed and fell in one day 3 and
[1:10:23] 20,000 neither let us temp Christ are
[1:10:25] some of them also tempted and were
[1:10:26] destroyed of serpents neither murmur ye
[1:10:29] some of them also murmured and were
[1:10:30] destroyed of the Destroyer now this the
[1:10:32] verse we want to get to these things
[1:10:35] happen unto them for examples and they
[1:10:38] are written for our admonition upon whom
[1:10:43] the ends of the world are come Romans 15
[1:10:47] want read from verse
[1:10:51] 4 this is a beautiful scripture Romans
[1:10:54] 1544 for whatsoever things were written
[1:10:56] a time were written for our learning
[1:11:01] that we through patience and comfort of
[1:11:03] the scriptures might have hope now the
[1:11:07] god of patience and
[1:11:11] consolation Grant you to be likeminded
[1:11:14] one towards another right according to
[1:11:16] Christ Jesus that he may with one mind
[1:11:20] and one mouth glorify God even the
[1:11:24] father father of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:11:27] wherefore receiveing one another as
[1:11:29] Christ also receive us to the glory of
[1:11:32] God let's pray father we thank you for
[1:11:34] your word interpreted father God and may
[1:11:36] you Minister and meet every need here
[1:11:39] this morning in Jesus name I ask it I'm
[1:11:41] waiting upon you may your spirit drop
[1:11:43] down in a special way in Jesus name I
[1:11:45] ask it amen you may be seated praise
[1:11:49] God hallelujah this same scripture
[1:11:52] Romans 15:4 in the Amplified
[1:11:55] it says for whatever was thus written in
[1:11:58] former days was written for our
[1:12:01] instruction that by our steadfast and
[1:12:04] patient endurance and
[1:12:07] encouragement drawn from the
[1:12:10] scriptures we might hold fast to and
[1:12:14] cherish hope now may the God who gives
[1:12:17] the power of patient
[1:12:20] endurance and that is
[1:12:22] steadfastness and who supplies
[1:12:25] encouragement so you could see this is
[1:12:28] the context of you going through stuff
[1:12:31] and the word is addressing it and saying
[1:12:33] the God who gives the power of patient
[1:12:38] endurance and who supplies encouragement
[1:12:41] Grant you to live in such a mutual
[1:12:45] Harmony and such full sympathy with one
[1:12:49] another Amen in accord with Christ Jesus
[1:12:53] that together you you may unanimously
[1:12:56] with United hearts and one voice praise
[1:12:59] and glorify the God and the father of
[1:13:02] our Lord Jesus Christ the
[1:13:03] Messiah welcome and receive to your
[1:13:06] hearts one another
[1:13:09] then listen even as Christ has welcome
[1:13:14] and receive you for the glory of God so
[1:13:18] this scripture alone should eliminate a
[1:13:19] lot of bad attitude and bad spirited
[1:13:22] people because if Christ receive you
[1:13:25] receive
[1:13:28] others it come like as God forgive you
[1:13:31] forgive us as we forgive
[1:13:34] those and if God forgive you how come
[1:13:36] you're bringing up what others have done
[1:13:39] to you have you dropped it or you you're
[1:13:42] mining it you're keeping it you're
[1:13:44] warming it up then you know what I mean
[1:13:46] you have light the food container you
[1:13:49] have a little mini light a little pilot
[1:13:51] light and you're warming up the O you
[1:13:53] keep the O warm you getting cold at all
[1:13:55] you know so easily
[1:14:00] speakable okay here we go good to see B
[1:14:05] praise the Lord have a title this
[1:14:08] morning a
[1:14:11] reminder a warning we are at the end
[1:14:14] time
[1:14:16] yes this is what I have upon my heart
[1:14:19] this morning a
[1:14:21] reminder a
[1:14:23] warning we are at the end
[1:14:26] time the Bible speaks about
[1:14:30] admonition it's a warning it's a warning
[1:14:33] to avoid aberant
[1:14:36] Behavior it is used three times in the
[1:14:39] New Testament Paul give us the example
[1:14:42] about Israel being punished for
[1:14:43] disobeying God it were written for our
[1:14:47] instructions so we do have to be stupid
[1:14:49] like I told someone we you could correct
[1:14:52] ignorance with knowledge somebody don't
[1:14:55] know you could correct ignorance with
[1:14:56] knowledge but you can't correct
[1:15:01] stupidity that's that's a tough one you
[1:15:03] can't commit you can't you can't correct
[1:15:04] stupidity if you're acting like an idiot
[1:15:06] you can't correct that you have to come
[1:15:08] into some kind of understanding and
[1:15:10] knowledge and wisdom ignorance knowledge
[1:15:13] could address that because you don't
[1:15:16] know and then you come that you may know
[1:15:18] or that you might learn and that's why
[1:15:20] Jesus said learn of me so you come that
[1:15:23] your ignorance could be correct
[1:15:26] that you could get a knowledge of God
[1:15:28] the promise is that we will come from
[1:15:29] partial realization into full
[1:15:31] realization that you will know as you
[1:15:33] are known because God know you a certain
[1:15:36] way like I keep talking to my wife about
[1:15:39] and looking backwards looking back and
[1:15:41] see how things unfold over the
[1:15:44] years and the journey of life doesn't
[1:15:48] allow you to see everything but what it
[1:15:51] gives you is the power of choice and
[1:15:53] depending upon what you ch CH the
[1:15:55] thinking your attitude your mindset you
[1:15:58] see the fruit down the
[1:16:00] road this didn't drop down from the sky
[1:16:03] we didn't just arrive here was a journey
[1:16:06] to get to this spot and if we get into
[1:16:09] Rapture preparedness it has to be a
[1:16:11] journey also note note Israel was in
[1:16:15] bondage just like we were in sin and in
[1:16:17] bondage but God sent a deliverer to
[1:16:19] bring them out now the out is not just
[1:16:22] out it's the out to put you in amen
[1:16:27] the message come and catch us in Baptist
[1:16:29] Methodist Catholic World whatever it is
[1:16:31] to get us out but it's not just to pull
[1:16:33] you out it's to get you
[1:16:36] in God don't want to take you out he
[1:16:39] want to take you out and get you in to
[1:16:40] the place he want you to come which is
[1:16:43] the promised land or the land of
[1:16:46] promises or give the Lord a shout in the
[1:16:49] house in the natural they came out of
[1:16:51] Egypt to go into Canaan land in the
[1:16:54] spirit spiritual we coming into this
[1:16:56] land of promise where there is Faith and
[1:16:58] virtue and knowledge and Temperance and
[1:16:59] patience and godliness wherever you put
[1:17:01] your foot that is yours oh give the Lord
[1:17:04] a shout if you want to stay baby and
[1:17:07] have bottle and pacifier and Pampers and
[1:17:09] whatnot they can stay at Faith but if
[1:17:11] you want to grow in God you have to go
[1:17:13] to Virtue and knowledge and Temperance
[1:17:15] and patience and get like a man oh give
[1:17:17] the Lord a shout you can't stay in child
[1:17:20] form whenever the child speak like a
[1:17:22] child that's what children supposed to
[1:17:24] act like talk like live like but when I
[1:17:26] became a man what do you do what do you
[1:17:29] do you put away talish and give the Lord
[1:17:32] a
[1:17:32] shout in the house of God want to pull
[1:17:36] us into
[1:17:38] maturity into
[1:17:40] manhood
[1:17:41] amen so this word that identifies
[1:17:46] admition I wouldn't go
[1:17:47] into thing of it but it has a word that
[1:17:51] carries the meaning of discipline
[1:17:53] admonition and discipline and
[1:17:55] instruction to train and to undergo
[1:17:59] discipline literally to train for
[1:18:01] physical exercise but use figuratively
[1:18:04] or spiritual and mental exercises and
[1:18:06] therefore mean to train or undergo
[1:18:09] discipline now we are not born
[1:18:12] discipline if you leave human beings
[1:18:14] they just do what they feel and what
[1:18:16] they like that's right not what needs to
[1:18:18] be done this is a church we have
[1:18:21] different areas different sections
[1:18:23] different things have to be dealt with
[1:18:24] and if everybody say well just do what
[1:18:26] you want to do everybody might line up
[1:18:27] in a particular place maybe Under the
[1:18:29] Tent picking up leaves or something like
[1:18:32] that but there are other things to be
[1:18:34] done and God have a plan and program
[1:18:36] that's why you have Pastor Prophet
[1:18:37] teaching evangelist that why he have
[1:18:38] different gifts tongu speaking in
[1:18:39] tongues healing and in other words the
[1:18:42] body functions the same way we have nose
[1:18:44] eyes mouth and whatnot if your whole
[1:18:45] body was an eye it looks
[1:18:47] terrible you understand ey behind ey in
[1:18:49] front you're looking like horrible and
[1:18:50] you're looking so you're seeing
[1:18:51] everything behind and you see so what
[1:18:54] I'm saying is
[1:18:55] God temper the body a certain way that
[1:18:57] the hand is functional the nose is
[1:18:59] functional the teeth The Taste and
[1:19:01] everything else is functional and that
[1:19:02] is how the body of Christ supposed to be
[1:19:05] Hallelujah God tap it that way so the
[1:19:08] hand feel I Ain feeling to be handed not
[1:19:10] feeling let to be the foot the hand on
[1:19:12] your
[1:19:13] own you I'm saying then everything is in
[1:19:15] order and this is what God wants to get
[1:19:17] us to I'm going to show you something my
[1:19:21] God
[1:19:25] amen so you have to
[1:19:26] get how the prophet say fitted into the
[1:19:32] headstone to be fitted in you have to be
[1:19:36] cut or
[1:19:38] honed or
[1:19:40] shaped or formed to be placed inside of
[1:19:44] there everybody who want to do their own
[1:19:46] thing they on their own because there's
[1:19:49] a vision when when people climbing up
[1:19:51] they start to slip off and slide off so
[1:19:54] you are to be able to want to take the
[1:19:56] pressure to go all the way because if
[1:19:58] you think this is pressure more pressure
[1:20:00] coming I think this summer was the
[1:20:02] hardest summer ever the hottest summer
[1:20:04] ever in America that temperatur over I
[1:20:07] think 35 degrees terrible for days
[1:20:10] things are heating up not just climate
[1:20:12] change thing and what not you talking
[1:20:14] about around the world and God is
[1:20:16] heating things up he doing the heating
[1:20:17] up too oh praise the name of the Lord
[1:20:20] because judgment is next so this thing
[1:20:23] here is for admission and admonition
[1:20:25] upon whom the end of the world is come
[1:20:29] so then if we coming on to the end and I
[1:20:32] know that may not
[1:20:34] resonate with a lot of people because
[1:20:37] the Bible said people say where the sign
[1:20:38] of his coming talk come in come in come
[1:20:41] in come
[1:20:42] in watch number one Malachi
[1:20:46] 4 Elias is already
[1:20:49] come Daniel was told go thy way seal the
[1:20:52] book until the time of the end the book
[1:20:54] is now
[1:20:55] unsealed the in other words the coming
[1:20:58] of the Lord is nearer than when we first
[1:21:05] believe so the
[1:21:07] bride have received this prophetic
[1:21:10] Spirit spoken word message into our
[1:21:13] heart yes sir the ministers who
[1:21:15] Faithfully take the word and bring the
[1:21:17] promises from the message is they are
[1:21:21] the ones who God used to get the seed
[1:21:22] into the bride amen this whole thing
[1:21:24] about the word is in the bride that
[1:21:26] could only come by the promises that is
[1:21:29] promised to you and I coming from behind
[1:21:31] the pulpit and coming to you that's why
[1:21:33] you supposed to know your
[1:21:36] promises not know the pastor know the
[1:21:39] promises not know the church know the
[1:21:42] promises because the pastor dead you you
[1:21:45] messed
[1:21:46] up but if you know the promises you know
[1:21:49] he just part and was used to the
[1:21:52] capacity and he's finished now and press
[1:21:54] on as
[1:21:57] normal glory to God so God don't want
[1:21:59] you titer a man any man God want you to
[1:22:02] titer
[1:22:03] him so the fold Ministry is a channel to
[1:22:06] reconcile men back to God not men back
[1:22:08] to them Ministry or men back to church
[1:22:11] men back to God so at the end of the day
[1:22:15] God must be the theme and the central
[1:22:17] point of our worship of our attention of
[1:22:20] our focus it must be him because he is
[1:22:24] promised to be among us him moving in
[1:22:26] and out and then we are worshiping the
[1:22:30] living Christ Oh Glory Glory to God do
[1:22:35] we give the Lord a shout in the house
[1:22:37] this has nothing to do with what the
[1:22:39] message has this have to do with what is
[1:22:42] prophesied and then we are worshiping
[1:22:45] the living
[1:22:48] Christ he could move in this morning he
[1:22:51] could move in and deliver you this
[1:22:52] morning he can move in can heal you this
[1:22:55] morning him moving in and out praise God
[1:22:58] praise God praise God so just as Lucifer
[1:23:03] in his panoramic screen offer Jesus all
[1:23:06] the kingdom of this world God sent a
[1:23:09] prophet to bring a prophetic vision and
[1:23:12] to give us a panoramic screen brother
[1:23:14] kangali that we could see the program of
[1:23:17] God oh glory to God we can see where it
[1:23:20] starts and where it's finishing and
[1:23:22] where the bright supposed to be in this
[1:23:23] very hour that's what he brought
[1:23:26] Revelation
[1:23:27] 19:10 and this is where we have the
[1:23:29] authority this morning to speak the way
[1:23:32] we speak 19:10 says and I fell at his
[1:23:35] feet to worship Him He said unto me see
[1:23:37] thou do it not I am thy fellow servant
[1:23:39] and of thy Brethren that have the
[1:23:41] testimony of Jesus worship God for the
[1:23:45] testimony of Jesus is the spirit of
[1:23:49] Prophecy so we were supposed to connect
[1:23:52] with that testimony of Jesus Spirit of
[1:23:54] Prophecy
[1:23:55] 1910 and Revelation 228 says and I John
[1:23:59] saw these things and heard them when I
[1:24:01] heard and seen I fell not to worship
[1:24:02] before the feet of the Angel which show
[1:24:04] me these things then said he unto me see
[1:24:06] thou do it not I am thy fellow servant
[1:24:09] and of thy Brethren the prophets and
[1:24:11] said un and of them which keep the
[1:24:13] scenes of this book worship God he said
[1:24:16] unto me here we go seal
[1:24:19] not the sins of the prophecy of this
[1:24:22] booken for the time is at hand I don't
[1:24:26] have the ministry to explain why brother
[1:24:29] BR went to son and he went on this house
[1:24:31] and he walked on that road and go give
[1:24:33] my sign that's not my
[1:24:35] calling somebody else will do that my
[1:24:38] calling is to find these
[1:24:40] promises and preach it to you but Bram
[1:24:43] had a was a normal man he have a story
[1:24:46] he has testimonies he has meetings and
[1:24:48] everything else but outside of his
[1:24:50] natural life and story which Full of
[1:24:51] experiences and Supernatural he had a
[1:24:53] message amen God tell him your message
[1:24:56] will forun my second
[1:24:58] coming
[1:25:00] Hall so we could deal with the filler
[1:25:03] material around the message or we could
[1:25:04] deal with the message
[1:25:07] itself so we try to zero in on what
[1:25:10] matters most or say it this way to let
[1:25:13] the main thing be the main thing oh give
[1:25:16] the Lord I shout in the house no
[1:25:20] thrills just getting to the meat of it
[1:25:24] or the Lord I
[1:25:25] shout so seal not what the sayings of
[1:25:29] the prophecy of the book Revelation 10
[1:25:34] 8-11 and the voice which I he from
[1:25:36] Heaven speak to me again said go and
[1:25:39] take the little book which is open in
[1:25:41] the hand of the Angel it did not say go
[1:25:43] to
[1:25:44] jonville it did not say go to a man in
[1:25:47] Trinidad or any man anywhere in the
[1:25:49] world it says go to the angel and said
[1:25:53] and take the little book with Open Hand
[1:25:54] of the Angel and when I went unto the
[1:25:56] angel verse 9 and said give me the
[1:25:59] little book he said unto me take it eat
[1:26:01] it up it shall make thy belly bitter but
[1:26:03] it shall be thy mouth sweet as honey and
[1:26:05] I took the little book out of the
[1:26:06] Angel's hand and ate it up it was in my
[1:26:08] mouth sweet as honey as soon as I eaten
[1:26:10] it my belly was bitter and he said unto
[1:26:12] me here we go thou must prophesy again
[1:26:16] before many peoples Nations and tongues
[1:26:18] and Kings so I shown you by the
[1:26:20] scriptures the anointing of the
[1:26:23] testimony of Jesus which is the spirit
[1:26:25] of Prophecy supposed to be in the
[1:26:28] church to prophesy according to rans
[1:26:31] 108 11 to prophesy according to
[1:26:34] Revelation 228 according to Revelation
[1:26:37] 19 that is the authority that we have to
[1:26:40] prophesy of The Nearness of the coming
[1:26:43] of the Lord but BR for Masterpiece what
[1:26:46] did he say in Revelation 10 that would
[1:26:48] take place why the trip to Tucson to
[1:26:51] open to the church in the days of the
[1:26:53] Seven Angels m message the whole word of
[1:26:55] God would be made manifest the seal that
[1:26:58] was all the stock had left off why all
[1:27:01] about it will be made manifest at this
[1:27:03] time is that what the word said
[1:27:06] congregation say Amen then we see it
[1:27:09] then where are we at where are we at
[1:27:11] there's only one thing the Harvest is
[1:27:14] here she is dead ripe she is ready now
[1:27:18] for the coming so that word is a word of
[1:27:21] Prophecy yes sir she's dead R she's
[1:27:23] ready for the coming let's go at the
[1:27:27] Harvest Time the seed is back to its
[1:27:30] original condition why did he say that
[1:27:33] because the original seed that fell in
[1:27:35] the Pentecost when it fell it went
[1:27:37] through processes like a corn seed you
[1:27:40] take a corn seed and you bury it into
[1:27:41] the ground it go through processes when
[1:27:43] you plant a corn seed you don't see corn
[1:27:45] seed spitting up like it's
[1:27:47] popcorn that's on the pack you can get
[1:27:49] that they just popping and whatnot no
[1:27:51] when you bury the corn seed it go
[1:27:53] through a talk it grow it matures it get
[1:27:57] tall it get a flower it get the all the
[1:27:59] little silting and whatnot and you come
[1:28:01] back to the
[1:28:02] original you understand that so the
[1:28:05] church ages is
[1:28:07] really the history of the unfolding of
[1:28:11] the life of the
[1:28:14] seed so what we call Seven Church ages
[1:28:17] is really the unfolding of this tree we
[1:28:19] talking about and you shout out amen you
[1:28:24] you are the seed that is prophesied to
[1:28:27] come at the top of the tree oh give the
[1:28:31] Lord I shout in the house Oh Glory to
[1:28:35] God hallelujah hallelujah the
[1:28:37] Pentecostal was the
[1:28:40] shock but you are the seed that's why
[1:28:43] the son of man had to come to you the
[1:28:46] message had to come to you seed to seed
[1:28:50] oh the Lord I shout the son of man is
[1:28:53] the sore of the good seed and you had
[1:28:55] the potential in you the attribute the
[1:28:59] thought the gene was in you that's why
[1:29:02] you couldn't help it you had to respond
[1:29:05] Oh Glory to God where there's a deep
[1:29:07] deep calling there got to be a

[1:40:21] contrite heart he wakes interet a
[1:40:23] repentant Spirit he always
[1:40:29] [Music]
[1:40:30] does but you must have all the word in
[1:40:33] order to be seed you can't have half a
[1:40:36] seed it won't grow it's got to be the
[1:40:39] whole seed it's got to not manifest I
[1:40:43] believe in the B Holy Ghost Hallelujah I
[1:40:45] believe speak in tongues that is part of
[1:40:47] the seed but now there is added to that
[1:40:50] the
[1:40:51] life he said said to the baptism of the
[1:40:55] Holy Ghost you have to add something the
[1:40:58] life that's what the Pentecost didn't
[1:41:01] have that is why they could be adultery
[1:41:03] and fornication and live up to now
[1:41:05] they're still doing
[1:41:06] it up to now they are still identify
[1:41:10] with who they are no real
[1:41:13] conversion no real
[1:41:15] change notice the life that was in the
[1:41:17] husk in the
[1:41:20] stalk in the tassel gathers up in the
[1:41:22] seed the life was in the stalk one went
[1:41:25] to make the other justification went to
[1:41:27] make sanctification sanctification away
[1:41:30] from the B Holy Ghost and the baptism of
[1:41:32] the Holy Ghost made a way for the Holy
[1:41:34] Ghost itself to come right down in
[1:41:37] Perfection up to now I a see no man from
[1:41:39] train
[1:41:40] yet I don't know if my glasses need
[1:41:43] attention I don't know if I need
[1:41:44] adjustment or something so I need need
[1:41:46] some adjustment up to now I a see no man
[1:41:48] from jville there you I see the B was
[1:41:51] made a way for the Holy Ghost itself to
[1:41:54] come down right down in Perfection and
[1:41:58] back to the word again what for to
[1:42:00] manifest
[1:42:01] itself so this back to the word is not
[1:42:03] to say well yeah I have PL Revelations
[1:42:06] you to come here to hear it that's a lie
[1:42:09] is back to the word
[1:42:11] to manifest
[1:42:14] itself shout out manifest
[1:42:16] itself so again manifest itself manifest
[1:42:19] itself the word has to manifest itself
[1:42:23] oh my one time the prophet said I think
[1:42:26] it
[1:42:27] was he says the the sick is healed the
[1:42:30] dead is rais a BL because the word is in
[1:42:33] the church in the
[1:42:38] person so that that that Vindication is
[1:42:42] evidence the person is back in the
[1:42:44] church Hallelujah who who person the
[1:42:47] person of the Holy Ghost
[1:42:53] Hallelujah Daniel 128 and9 said I heard
[1:42:55] I understood not then I said oh my Lord
[1:42:57] what shall be the end of these things he
[1:42:59] said go that way for the book which are
[1:43:01] closed up and sealed till the time of
[1:43:04] the end so you understand when brother
[1:43:05] brandham came he came at the time of the
[1:43:08] end so we belong to at the end time
[1:43:11] people yes sir that means somewhere it
[1:43:14] going to be a
[1:43:16] closing everybody wouldn't be big know
[1:43:19] they got babies they got toddlers they
[1:43:22] got children
[1:43:23] they go adults have old people have sick
[1:43:26] people rich people poor people everybody
[1:43:29] go be it but they will see the whole
[1:43:32] drama and the whole closing and this is
[1:43:34] what this message is about yes sir to
[1:43:37] remind you and to warn you that we are
[1:43:40] in the end
[1:43:42] times I know you're planning for your
[1:43:44] house and you're planning for your next
[1:43:45] car and you're planning for this and
[1:43:46] planning for that I know no problem keep
[1:43:48] planning because we planning too but be
[1:43:51] conscious
[1:43:53] that any day now something different
[1:43:56] will
[1:44:00] happen but Bram
[1:44:07] says notice for the End of Time message
[1:44:12] he's talking to seven seal this seal he
[1:44:16] revealed all the six seals but they
[1:44:18] don't say nothing about the seventh but
[1:44:20] the end time seal yes sir when it starts
[1:44:24] it will be a
[1:44:26] secret not when it finish when it starts
[1:44:30] right it will be absolutely total secret
[1:44:33] according to the Bible but remember
[1:44:35] Revelation 10 1-7 at the end of the
[1:44:38] seven Angel's message all the mysteries
[1:44:41] of God would be known we are at the end
[1:44:45] time the opening of the seventh
[1:44:49] seal so the open of the seventh seal
[1:44:53] identify that we are actually at the end
[1:44:57] now because we are in time and we
[1:44:58] counting months years dates and so on
[1:45:00] and hours and seconds we don't
[1:45:03] understand God's
[1:45:04] timing because from 1960 to now it's
[1:45:07] like a
[1:45:09] blink God are not hor with the time you
[1:45:12] we have hor because we see we getting
[1:45:14] old and gray and dying and whatnot but
[1:45:16] God they getting old and GRE and dying
[1:45:18] he have a
[1:45:21] clock what is a number of perfection we
[1:45:24] all know that tree is God's number in
[1:45:26] numerology God is known by his numbers
[1:45:28] Tre is perfection seven is worship 20
[1:45:31] for his worship 40 is Temptation 50 is
[1:45:33] Pentecost Jubilee all of his numbers his
[1:45:36] numerals of God is perfected is imp
[1:45:38] Perfection tree is perfection now the
[1:45:42] little baby Jesus was born three stars
[1:45:44] went together one was the morning star
[1:45:46] that reflected the coming of the infant
[1:45:47] Christ a perfect one now what happened
[1:45:51] we see a roar in the paper across
[1:45:53] television across the Nations we five
[1:45:55] stars this is 1962 and time sign seed he
[1:46:00] said when five stars just fell in line
[1:46:03] with the world what is five Grace every
[1:46:05] time those stars come something happen
[1:46:07] on the earth now watch what it says
[1:46:09] Germany almost wash off the map some of
[1:46:11] the ma said the world would burst like a
[1:46:13] watermelon every distressful thing
[1:46:15] prophesied by them in the last days he
[1:46:17] said what it is California like to wash
[1:46:19] into the ocean what is it the beginning
[1:46:21] of Sorrows earthquakes has picked up
[1:46:23] everywhere five stars come in Grace
[1:46:25] God's grace what happened 1962 listen to
[1:46:29] these words an infant Church Hallelujah
[1:46:32] a bride infancy that the power of God
[1:46:37] has begin to fall on her she is taking
[1:46:41] form a bride for this bridegroom so the
[1:46:45] five stars lineup 1962 identify a bride
[1:46:50] seed bride taken form
[1:46:53] oh Hallelujah we are in
[1:46:55] 2024 oh blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:46:58] what is happening I might say this
[1:47:00] friends the church is coming forth God
[1:47:03] prophecy is going to have a church
[1:47:05] without spot a wrinkle and she is
[1:47:08] predestinated God said so he would have
[1:47:10] it that makes it right who's a member I
[1:47:13] don't
[1:47:14] know I am trusting to be myself you see
[1:47:18] that humility I'm the I the bride when
[1:47:20] you see me you see the father
[1:47:23] a
[1:47:23] Calypso where they going with that that
[1:47:27] kind of
[1:47:28] Trinity I I jesus so is that what kind
[1:47:32] of foolishness is
[1:47:34] that everything I going through is the
[1:47:36] Lord is the Lord liar God told me and
[1:47:39] God told me God didn't speak to you
[1:47:42] yet God tell
[1:47:44] theming some Spirit talking to
[1:47:47] them enticing Spirit lying to them and
[1:47:50] God show me and these false prophets and
[1:47:52] and internet they always say you know it
[1:47:54] came to me that the Lord was telling me
[1:47:56] the Lord has talk
[1:47:57] so you hear Isaiah talk like that it was
[1:48:00] coming to me and know you think you mean
[1:48:04] a no Prophet talk like that these Jokers
[1:48:06] and them and people reading the Bible
[1:48:08] and want just listen to these
[1:48:12] nonsense we have a message that we don't
[1:48:15] have to experiment
[1:48:16] with I feeling me it so and we twist it
[1:48:19] so I you a mechanic yeah span on
[1:48:24] spanning you're breaking n in the
[1:48:26] prophet
[1:48:27] message you revealing
[1:48:30] Revelation and next minute is your own
[1:48:33] message own message you know have
[1:48:35] nothing do Prophet say because he say
[1:48:37] say what the tape say because God
[1:48:39] speaking through him I can be more God
[1:48:41] than than God in him God speaks through
[1:48:44] the
[1:48:46] prophets and if I speak what the prophet
[1:48:48] speak is speaking what God say then the
[1:48:51] prophet's voice is on my lip
[1:48:56] then his words are on my tongue and God
[1:48:58] know what he speak to that prophet and
[1:49:00] God know what we are saying this morning
[1:49:02] and God will honor his word one thing
[1:49:04] I'm convinced of he will honor his word
[1:49:06] because God is not a man that would
[1:49:08] lie God would shame the critics he would
[1:49:12] shame the Liars he will embarrass them
[1:49:15] in his time let them grow let them carry
[1:49:17] on let them let them do what they want
[1:49:19] to do your time coming oh give the Lord
[1:49:22] some some
[1:49:23] Praises hallelujah hallelujah I believe
[1:49:27] that these Latter-Day signs and things
[1:49:29] that's happening every one of them is
[1:49:30] peeling together to show that Christ is
[1:49:33] ready to come for his bride as God in
[1:49:36] his word made manifest in a man a
[1:49:38] perfect man so is God and His word
[1:49:40] coming again and making himself manifest
[1:49:42] in a bride not will do like Eve did I
[1:49:45] breed it but the unadulterated born word
[1:49:47] of God will be born into that church
[1:49:51] amen amen
[1:49:56] the same Sun that shines there in the
[1:50:00] East the same sh sign that shine there
[1:50:03] with his same power upon Pentecost is to
[1:50:05] ripen the seed that he planted so look
[1:50:08] at the layers you have to get the word
[1:50:11] scattered to get the seed and then when

[1:54:01] Grandy I know people smoking message
[1:54:04] it's spiritual ganja they high on the
[1:54:07] pastor the high on the church they high
[1:54:10] on the Revelation they high on
[1:54:16] God man I tell you Donald Trump get in
[1:54:20] the ears I know what that is about he
[1:54:23] had a big big p and in the convention s
[1:54:25] them patch
[1:54:26] to them going in sympathy they paint a
[1:54:29] picture of Jesus
[1:54:37] with they worshiping you know that man
[1:54:40] is a God to
[1:54:41] them Christian you know
[1:54:44] soal they worshiping they have a

[1:54:52] and Jesus have my
[1:54:56] back when go take a with
[1:55:00] Trump yeah I wonder if Jesus had
[1:55:03] back but
[1:55:07] Brown
[1:55:08] remember we have shown clearly All
[1:55:11] Through the Ages even as Adam and Eve
[1:55:14] fell because they left the word so the
[1:55:17] Ephesians age fell by turning slightly
[1:55:20] from from the word
[1:55:23] until you see that how he use that
[1:55:25] terminology
[1:55:27] slightly not no big you know when he get
[1:55:30] somebody
[1:55:31] off now you might bother with that
[1:55:33] little but when you walk at 10 miles
[1:55:36] with that instead of going so you're
[1:55:39] going
[1:55:41] show and people traveling message years
[1:55:45] off and they don't want to admit that
[1:55:47] they have been deceived and the years
[1:55:50] off
[1:55:55] watch this we have the final reputation
[1:55:57] of the word by the World Church system
[1:56:00] the loudest and age ends in a blackout
[1:56:01] of the word thereby causing a departure
[1:56:04] of the Lord from the midst so off the
[1:56:07] word means god pull his hands off
[1:56:10] because he and his word is one you have
[1:56:12] the word you have the spirit the spirit
[1:56:14] follows the word if the word being
[1:56:16] preached the spirit is present because
[1:56:18] the spirit is looking over his word if
[1:56:21] the person go off the word Spirit walk
[1:56:23] away because that is what the ni uh Nan
[1:56:26] counsel and so on because they break the
[1:56:30] word and went off the word there was no
[1:56:32] conduit for the spirit to come so the
[1:56:35] Bible talk about the at the river
[1:56:36] Euphrates the holy was bound for almost
[1:56:39] 2,000 years Bound by Crees and dogmas
[1:56:43] Crees and dogmas with Crees and dogmas
[1:56:46] the spirit can't work so the spirit is
[1:56:49] trapped the spirit is not operative with
[1:56:52] creas interpretation and dogmas
[1:56:55] intellectual information and all kind of
[1:56:57] explanation that was going forward but
[1:56:59] the spirit itself could move he said the
[1:57:02] evening time message is to lose the Holy
[1:57:10] Ghost that's what the message come to do
[1:57:13] to lose the Holy Ghost not to put the
[1:57:15] holy gohost in the background and a
[1:57:17] Trinidadian coming in front that know we
[1:57:20] end message for or some flesh and blood
[1:57:22] in front the end time mess is to lose
[1:57:24] the Holy Ghost words the enti mess is to
[1:57:27] kill men kill flesh Hallelujah and God
[1:57:31] come forward and the man go backward
[1:57:34] Jesus said it this way John said this
[1:57:36] way he must increase and I must decrease
[1:57:39] the Holy Ghost must increase and we must
[1:57:42] decrease Dynamics must increase oh give
[1:57:45] the Lord some
[1:57:46] [Applause]
[1:57:50] Praises but
[1:57:53] this lisian age ends in a blackout of
[1:57:56] the word sir thereby causing a departure
[1:58:00] of the Lord from the midst he stands
[1:58:03] outside calling to his own who follow
[1:58:05] him by obedience to the word this's the
[1:58:08] part I want to get to after a short and
[1:58:12] Powerful demonstration of the
[1:58:15] spirit this little haunted and
[1:58:20] persecuted group will go to be with
[1:58:24] Jesus 30% say amen that's okay because
[1:58:28] in this have
[1:58:29] hunted and
[1:58:32] persecuted hallu if you don't want this
[1:58:36] you could have a choice it have a you
[1:58:38] could flip now to the tribulation where
[1:58:40] you'll be
[1:58:46] killed is that fair
[1:58:49] Choice let me say again after after a
[1:58:53] short and Powerful demonstration of the
[1:58:56] spirit this little hunted and persecuted
[1:59:00] group will go to be with
[1:59:04] Jesus I want to go to Matthew 24 I pick
[1:59:07] up something here that there something
[1:59:10] else Jesus went out verse one departed
[1:59:12] from the temple the disciples came to
[1:59:14] him and showed him the buildings of the
[1:59:15] temple Jesus said unto them see ye not
[1:59:17] all these things very like unto you they
[1:59:20] shall not be left here one stone one on
[1:59:22] another that shall not be thrown down
[1:59:24] and as he sat on the Mount of Olives the
[1:59:26] disciples came at him privately saying
[1:59:27] tell us when shall these things be one
[1:59:30] two what shall be sign of th come in
[1:59:33] tree and of the end of the world three
[1:59:35] things that was asked Jesus answered and
[1:59:38] then them first thing Jesus talk about
[1:59:41] take
[1:59:42] heed that no man deceive you watch them
[1:59:48] dogs watch them
[1:59:50] men for men many shall come in my name
[1:59:54] saying I am Christ and shall receive
[1:59:57] many many and
[1:59:59] many he shall hear of war and of
[2:00:03] War see that be not troubled for all
[2:00:07] these things must come to pass but the
[2:00:09] end is not
[2:00:13] yet then Jesus go down deeper Nation
[2:00:16] shall rise against Nation Kingdom
[2:00:18] against Kingdom there shall be famines
[2:00:21] pestilences earthquakes and diverse
[2:00:23] places all these things are the
[2:00:25] beginning of Sorrows but then this is
[2:00:27] interesting if this is sequential look
[2:00:30] what next then shall they deliver you up
[2:00:34] to be afflicted and shall kill you you
[2:00:36] shall be hated of All Nation for my
[2:00:37] name's sake and then shall many be
[2:00:39] offended and
[2:00:41] shall betray one another I I know where
[2:00:44] the
[2:00:45] p number
[2:00:50] 26 I no longer
[2:00:53] believe I could tell you where brother

[2:01:15] you
[2:01:18] know the next parallel scripture with it

[2:01:24] mouth to
[2:01:25] speak when they question you and talk to
[2:01:29] you I have something a statement I have
[2:01:32] at the very end of this message because
[2:01:34] I cannot see any escape from the system

[2:02:34] have time for
[2:02:36] that I said before the devil is not
[2:02:41] omniscient he doesn't know all
[2:02:43] things this technology and artificial
[2:02:47] intelligence system that's about to set
[2:02:50] up for the whole world
[2:02:52] gives him the opportunity to access
[2:02:55] total
[2:02:57] knowledge he know where your house is if
[2:03:00] you go to Google Maps and search for his
[2:03:01] it will Zoom right here you see the
[2:03:03] tents in front of all they taking that
[2:03:06] from the
[2:03:10] sky so if they want to send the
[2:03:13] pope to the church he know ja where to
[2:03:16] go when he land in the airport he said
[2:03:18] take me straight
[2:03:24] where you going to
[2:03:25] run where you going to hide America is
[2:03:29] about to be bummed
[2:03:31] up America is about to be destroyed for
[2:03:34] years I've been saying B angly we're not
[2:03:36] even sure if America Mak tribulation no
[2:03:38] I don't believe they
[2:03:41] will but AB Bram saw he call it the
[2:03:46] annihilation he said America was just
[2:03:48] bummed up with cratus and smoke that's
[2:03:50] supposed to be the land of the bra and
[2:03:52] free everybody want to go
[2:03:56] there under President Obama the legalize
[2:04:01] sodomy legalize what they had in the
[2:04:04] Bible there Sodom and
[2:04:07] gomorra this is a land that came up and
[2:04:10] and Bo out a England and and get freedom
[2:04:14] of religion this is a land that went
[2:04:16] free and now they binding other
[2:04:19] people no longer free the whole thing
[2:04:21] will change you know a dictatorship is
[2:04:24] about to set up you know because the
[2:04:26] Bible talk about you can't buy or unless
[2:04:28] you take the mark you but R say it will
[2:04:30] be a for sin a for sin and that is why
[2:04:35] they will close down the
[2:04:38] churches who knows we might be zooming
[2:04:40] away when that time come nothing about
[2:04:44] rapt I don't word connection and
[2:04:49] zoom we don't know
[2:04:52] but one of these days they're going to
[2:04:53] close us down I could see why now why
[2:04:56] brother we are actually at the end
[2:05:00] time let's
[2:05:02] continue and many false prophet shall
[2:05:04] arise and shall deceive many and because
[2:05:06] of iniquity shall abound the love of
[2:05:08] many shall wax cold but he that shall
[2:05:10] endure until the end the same shall be
[2:05:11] saved and strange enough at verse
[2:05:15] 14 he said this Gospel of the Kingdom
[2:05:19] shall be preached in all the world for
[2:05:21] us
[2:05:22] witness I want to tie that in to what
[2:05:24] bam says after a short display of spirit
[2:05:28] this haunted persecuted group would go
[2:05:30] on to be with the
[2:05:32] Lord so I'm wondering to myself if after
[2:05:34] all this Nations or nations offended
[2:05:38] false prophets iniquity you're going to
[2:05:40] get the gospel being
[2:05:41] preached it will be you know it has to
[2:05:44] preach to people who reject it people
[2:05:47] who was once in it people have to get an
[2:05:49] opportunity to see God in its power
[2:05:52] demonstrate and turn down for the one
[2:05:53] last
[2:05:54] time oh my let me see how we could you
[2:05:59] know God provided place of worship
[2:06:02] notice here we go not only does he come
[2:06:05] in by the holy spirit with The Learning
[2:06:08] of his
[2:06:09] word he manifest that
[2:06:13] word so he comes in by the Learning of
[2:06:17] his word yes so when you come to church
[2:06:19] you come to learn of God amen understand
[2:06:22] this you know I've said it so much times
[2:06:24] they come of Egypt God said bring them
[2:06:25] down to this mountain they don't know
[2:06:28] this God Moses met this God they don't
[2:06:30] know his name his shape his form okay
[2:06:34] pillar fire in Conta with Moses the
[2:06:36] people come from a mighty hand they see
[2:06:37] plagues they see frogs and flies they
[2:06:39] know a power with them a presence with
[2:06:41] them a prophet with them they follow in
[2:06:44] when they come to the mountain and Moses
[2:06:45] went up to seek God they find he staying
[2:06:48] long they say Aon come
[2:06:52] we not even sure that man
[2:06:54] dead you say Aon make us a God the woman
[2:06:58] come with the earrings and all the gold
[2:06:59] and whatnot and he melting melting you
[2:07:01] know he wrong you know he melting under
[2:07:05] conviction he had heavy heavy but he
[2:07:07] melting gold and of all the thing they
[2:07:10] going build is a
[2:07:11] calf a golden
[2:07:14] one Egyptian anointing still on
[2:07:18] them when Moses come down and Moses see
[2:07:21] re now you see God know they're doing
[2:07:22] that but God dealing with Moses when
[2:07:25] Moses come down you saw Ten Commandments
[2:07:27] and Moses come and he said all who are
[2:07:29] the Lord said come with me and and he
[2:07:31] take the Commandments and and throw it
[2:07:32] down and some of them just disappeared
[2:07:35] on the earth K and them lost their
[2:07:38] Barber Shop they lost their um position
[2:07:41] in
[2:07:41] Egypt and they come out and they
[2:07:43] recognize that they can't set up shop
[2:07:45] again in the
[2:07:46] wilderness so as far as they concerned
[2:07:48] any anything come let's go back now I
[2:07:51] was supervisor I was CEO of the babers
[2:07:54] association whatever he was running I
[2:07:55] don't know where he was running let's go
[2:07:57] back and there are people like that
[2:07:59] every opportunity they want to go back
[2:08:02] they want to go back they want to go
[2:08:03] back they want to back why go
[2:08:06] back why go back and these disturbance
[2:08:09] ones because you see when Moses called
[2:08:11] them out he called out three kind of
[2:08:14] Believers that what happen in the
[2:08:15] message right now you know don't message
[2:08:18] don't talk that talk you know that's
[2:08:20] some Rascals in the message you there
[2:08:22] three kinds tell already is one wife I
[2:08:24] had not this year my wife have a name
[2:08:27] name isar
[2:08:30] one all right so he doesn't come in only
[2:08:33] with the learning of his word he
[2:08:36] manifests the word now remember the
[2:08:38] prophets believe the word they received
[2:08:39] the word of God and God the Holy Spirit
[2:08:42] came into them I'm still reading and
[2:08:44] fired yeah gang fire that promise out
[2:08:47] and made it come to pass so brother Ram
[2:08:50] came to fire out promises so so when I
[2:08:51] hit a spoken book I am look in my eyes
[2:08:53] anointed to see what he what was given
[2:08:55] to the bride as a promise in the book he
[2:08:57] may talk plenty stories different kind
[2:08:58] of things he went here there this
[2:09:00] happened and that happened fine but what
[2:09:01] what's the promise in that
[2:09:04] book Jesus said who can condemn me of
[2:09:07] sin sin is unbelief whatever God wrote
[2:09:10] and whatever the prophet said I am the
[2:09:12] answer and they said he came to his
[2:09:14] prophet he came as a prophet the son of
[2:09:16] man that's exactly what he was and what
[2:09:18] he proved to be why the dyam dyamics was
[2:09:22] dear to fire off the mechanics he was
[2:09:25] the mechanics the son
[2:09:27] himself and the father was the Dynamics
[2:09:31] so he given an example of what we have
[2:09:33] to have here the sons here have to
[2:09:35] become the mechanics and the father
[2:09:38] become the Dynamics to fire out the sons
[2:09:41] so now you will see empowered Sons
[2:09:43] anointed Sons inspired Sons Holy Ghost
[2:09:47] filled and anointed Sons not above not
[2:09:49] in front not behind but God in them
[2:09:52] Fire coming out the mount the word
[2:09:55] coming out the mount the word is assur
[2:09:57] coming out the
[2:10:00] mount
[2:10:02] hallelujah hallelujah three things
[2:10:05] happen when the Lord begin to descend
[2:10:07] shout voice and trumpet what is the
[2:10:09] shout it's the message going
[2:10:12] forth first the living bread of life
[2:10:16] bringing forth the bride so the shout
[2:10:19] which is the seven Thunders
[2:10:22] is the living bread so you know what
[2:10:24] you're feasting on all these years while
[2:10:26] the minister fighting it you're feasting
[2:10:28] on living
[2:10:29] bread the
[2:10:31] shout

[2:12:38] ministry of Jesus Christ hallelujah
[2:12:41] praise God praise God hallelujah all of
[2:12:46] this bilding now into
[2:12:47] this a woman will become president
[2:12:51] I want to read a couple of quotes that
[2:12:54] brother brandham have have said with us
[2:12:58] so you can put on this picture praise
[2:13:00] God want you take a look at this
[2:13:03] woman that
[2:13:05] woman I can take it down
[2:13:08] now now I remember you could take it off
[2:13:11] now I remember preaching two messages
[2:13:14] one was the intelligence in which I was
[2:13:16] talking about I didn't always was had a
[2:13:19] question about bid and this woman and so
[2:13:22] like that but I never saw it um you know
[2:13:26] that he was ready to bring her on really
[2:13:29] and I was saying that that that that she
[2:13:32] is a Heartbeat Away from becoming
[2:13:34] president so now she is the Democratic
[2:13:36] nominee and she's not the Democratic
[2:13:39] nominee by the way or the order it's
[2:13:42] supposed to be by competing and whatnot
[2:13:44] she's almost handed the throne it's
[2:13:46] almost like handed to her you see but
[2:13:49] listen to this but br
[2:13:52] just remember this I predict this that a
[2:13:55] woman will be president before we are
[2:13:59] annihilated amen I said that in a 199
[2:14:04] 1933 Vision let go quickly that was from
[2:14:07] God's covenant with Abraham then
[2:14:09] teaching on Moses woman has become an
[2:14:12] idol after a while America would be
[2:14:14] ruled by a woman mark it and see if it
[2:14:18] is not right a woman will take the place
[2:14:21] of a president or something some high
[2:14:23] power in America by fit Moses there the
[2:14:26] one I read when I spoke about uh um an
[2:14:31] end the end is come I was talking about
[2:14:34] uh the self-driving software that they
[2:14:36] have and there was something that I
[2:14:38] overlooked and I bned it up here I
[2:14:40] didn't some of my eyes didn't see it but
[2:14:42] R talk about the the cars were had a
[2:14:46] glass top and I drive Tesla car when I
[2:14:49] go to the states rent and so on and the
[2:14:51] whole top of it is glass it's not like
[2:14:53] if it's um what we normally will know
[2:14:55] and that would they have now watch and
[2:14:57] this year he said now there are just two
[2:14:59] things left in one of those prophecies
[2:15:02] that is for cars to be on the road with
[2:15:04] remote control looking like an egg you
[2:15:07] don't have to drive it it controls
[2:15:09] itself and there will be a great woman
[2:15:11] rise up because America is a woman
[2:15:13] nation and a great woman rise up will be
[2:15:15] president or something like that in the
[2:15:17] nation and then there will be a total
[2:15:21] Annihilation the entire nation will be
[2:15:24] wiped
[2:15:25] out this is not me saying that this is
[2:15:29] prophecy from why we are not an
[2:15:31] nomination he said the cars will keep
[2:15:33] getting more like a egg it shall come to
[2:15:35] pass that those cars will not run by
[2:15:37] steering wheel it will be something
[2:15:40] other than run them and the new cars I
[2:15:42] think supposed next two months which
[2:15:44] will be the robo taxi wouldn't have any
[2:15:45] pedals wouldn't have any steering wheel
[2:15:47] there's no need for it because you able
[2:15:49] to summon the car call with your cell
[2:15:51] phone and something like that and pun
[2:15:53] your destination take you to where
[2:15:55] you're going you pay whatever whatever
[2:15:57] right so watch in them cars they're
[2:16:00] bringing out right now remote control
[2:16:02] for safety and so on then he says
[2:16:04] there'll be a great powerful woman
[2:16:06] raised up either be president or
[2:16:08] dictator or some great powerful woman in
[2:16:10] United States and she will sink under
[2:16:12] the influence of women now remember that
[2:16:14] is thust sayth the Lord this is where he
[2:16:17] said that thust say the Lord that is
[2:16:19] thust sayth the Lord another one this
[2:16:21] from this time so I won't have time in
[2:16:24] this meeting to tell you in 1933 this is
[2:16:27] a woman's nation is number 13 appears 13
[2:16:29] chapter of Revelation 13 stars 13
[2:16:31] stripes 13 everything is 13 everything
[2:16:33] is woman and remember thus sayth the
[2:16:35] Lord there will be a woman rule before
[2:16:39] the end
[2:16:41] time and this is where I come to remind
[2:16:44] you that we are at the
[2:16:47] end don't just live loose live sober
[2:16:52] live thoughtful live with
[2:16:54] restraint understanding that the days
[2:16:57] are evil let's continue thus sayeth the
[2:17:01] Lord there will be a woman rule before
[2:17:03] the end time she'll either be president
[2:17:05] vice president it be Catholic Church as
[2:17:07] a woman I Seena a great woman the nation
[2:17:10] bout her it'll be one before the end
[2:17:13] time thus sayth the Lord write it down
[2:17:15] and find out you young people see if it
[2:17:17] happens if it isn't I'm a false prophet
[2:17:21] conference he said here now they'll have
[2:17:23] an automobile perfected into a
[2:17:27] place I seen a family driving an
[2:17:29] automobile that was glass topped some of
[2:17:32] I didn't I missed that glass topped and
[2:17:34] didn't have any strain wheel in it now
[2:17:36] bear in mind in 1933 around that time
[2:17:39] was the Ford and that was square and
[2:17:42] black top and it was one color when
[2:17:45] you're choosing just one color
[2:17:48] black for but he saw the glass top they
[2:17:51] didn't have any steering wheel in it
[2:17:54] almost done here look at the prophecy
[2:17:56] the Lord give me 933 how they permit the
[2:17:59] V to vote in voting they will elect the
[2:18:02] wrong person seven things was given five
[2:18:06] of them already happened the next thing
[2:18:08] was a great woman a church a power or
[2:18:10] something will take United States to
[2:18:12] rule then I seen it just like ashes
[2:18:14] laying there at the end it was the end
[2:18:18] time what brandham talk about
[2:18:21] he says there was a man and woman in the
[2:18:23] car sitting there with their backs
[2:18:24] turned to one another playing cards and
[2:18:26] the Machine traveling itself something
[2:18:28] on the bumpers that it couldn't hit the
[2:18:30] others going down he talk about radar
[2:18:33] but we know his sensors they have so it
[2:18:35] was breaks it break itself that it
[2:18:38] wouldn't hit the next car I think the
[2:18:40] last one we have you know from the
[2:18:41] center beak of Daniel and then after
[2:18:43] that I turned and looked and I saw this
[2:18:47] United States burning like a smolder
[2:18:50] rocks had been blown up it was burning a
[2:18:53] heap of fire in logs or something just
[2:18:56] set it a fire looked as far as I could
[2:18:58] see she had been blown up and then the
[2:19:00] vision left me five out of the three has
[2:19:03] happened five out of the seven has
[2:19:05] happened oh praise the name of the Lord
[2:19:07] so this is to challenge you and to warn
[2:19:10] you to think again what time you putting
[2:19:12] with the Lord what time you putting in
[2:19:14] prayer we need the Holy Ghost to get out
[2:19:18] of here we need Dynamics to get out of
[2:19:22] here he said the power of the Holy Ghost
[2:19:24] is what will put the people in The Bride
[2:19:26] to be the bride is not to be in the
[2:19:27] message to be in the bride is not to be
[2:19:29] under the best pastor or the or the most
[2:19:31] revelated man that not to be in the
[2:19:32] bride to be in the bride the power of
[2:19:34] God have to put you inside of day so I
[2:19:37] trust this stir you to hunger and thirst
[2:19:40] after righteousness that God could fill
[2:19:42] you that you could recognize that you
[2:19:44] don't have to fulfill all your dreams
[2:19:46] all your dreams don't have to come what
[2:19:48] you think and supposed to be because any
[2:19:50] day now going to break out and I feel
[2:19:52] like Russia and Ukraine just like a
[2:19:54] holding me Russia being held back by
[2:19:57] Ukraine Russia Russia could drop a bomb
[2:20:00] in UK and all this thing and no time at
[2:20:02] all in know but yet it continues
[2:20:06] on this week Israel went and take out
[2:20:10] some leader some some some fighter
[2:20:13] hammmer or something like that leader in
[2:20:15] Teran in
[2:20:17] Iran yeah I mean that's that's
[2:20:21] that's very
[2:20:22] brave but right them people crying they
[2:20:25] blood going to flow in Israel things are
[2:20:28] heating up and even though you may think
[2:20:32] it doesn't affect you it
[2:20:34] will eventually it will affect the
[2:20:36] entire world because Jerusalem will
[2:20:38] become a burdensome Stone oh praise the
[2:20:40] name of the Lord praise God let's see if
[2:20:43] you could try to wrap up here what the
[2:20:45] time is going I wasn't looking at time
[2:20:46] now the coming of the Lord Jesus is so
[2:20:48] close at hand so it's two things running
[2:20:50] in here now the natural vision that you
[2:20:54] could see and the spiritual part that
[2:20:56] you need to understand we supposed to
[2:21:01] have as I say long time you know you
[2:21:04] could copy passport copy identity and
[2:21:06] all kind of that you could hardly do
[2:21:08] that right
[2:21:09] now everything is
[2:21:12] digital you have to put up your identity
[2:21:14] in other words privacy is
[2:21:18] dead because you can't be private in the
[2:21:20] Beast system Every Man Poor Bor Rich
[2:21:26] free all take the mark of the beast
[2:21:29] exit what kind of people we going to be
[2:21:31] for this to face this end time end time
[2:21:34] demands end time Spirit end time
[2:21:36] condition you know we have to get in the
[2:21:38] spirit to deal with the end time
[2:21:40] condition you can't do like if you're in
[2:21:43] Sodom you know I like to dramatize it
[2:21:46] you so so what something Abraham
[2:21:48] interceding on behalf of lot lot s lot a
[2:21:52] good time he's me he a post but he he
[2:21:55] fed up he's sick of what he see Angel
[2:21:58] dispatched to get lot and his family
[2:22:01] out lot wife know that is Angelic being
[2:22:05] lot wife know it's supernatural just
[2:22:07] come out just come out and just keep
[2:22:08] walking don't look back don't look back
[2:22:10] but you see your heart if your heart not
[2:22:12] right if your heart corrupt if your
[2:22:14] heart you know like how Jesus said
[2:22:15] there's nothing in me that the
[2:22:17] devil there's nothing in me the devil
[2:22:19] could pull so we have to be purged
[2:22:21] enough that there is nothing there's no
[2:22:23] strings there you could pull there's no
[2:22:25] desire there that you could pull that's
[2:22:27] how much you want to be like Jesus
[2:22:28] that's how much you want to be close to
[2:22:30] God I do have to see that I can't see
[2:22:32] that God have to see that inside of you

[2:25:53] the issue is if you have the seed if the
[2:25:56] word and the spirit is one why is it

[2:26:53] you shall receive power you got to get
[2:26:56] that power God promised
[2:26:58] it
[2:27:00] Hallelujah
[2:27:03] brother here we go me see where I'm at
[2:27:07] hallelujah oh we have something
[2:27:09] pages I think I'm page 12 all right
[2:27:11] we're going
[2:27:13] good my stop here a minute I believe
[2:27:16] that the people here we go are in the
[2:27:18] preparation of the last
[2:27:20] great destruction this world will ever
[2:27:22] know I believe we are the end you can
[2:27:25] speak to people you can put bigram in
[2:27:27] every city in the United States they
[2:27:29] will still drink whiskey smoke
[2:27:30] cigarettes laugh at you and everything
[2:27:32] else the same here we go they are in the
[2:27:37] spirit of the last
[2:27:39] days so for the last days to be
[2:27:42] fulfilled the people have to come in the
[2:27:45] spirit of it and God here we go cannot
[2:27:49] send destruction
[2:27:51] before the people are in the spirit for
[2:27:58] Destruction so you recognize now the
[2:28:00] people getting in the spirit of it you
[2:28:03] see like when Carnival come in just's go
[2:28:05] to the mass band go and singing and
[2:28:07] Calypso go to fet and what not because
[2:28:08] they're tuning

[2:28:13] Tuesday come now they they explode the
[2:28:16] carnival time then Wednesday do for
[2:28:18] ashes
[2:28:20] by the
