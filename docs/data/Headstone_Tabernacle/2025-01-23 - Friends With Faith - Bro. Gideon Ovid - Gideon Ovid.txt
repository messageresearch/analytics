have your Bibles like you to turn with me to Short scripture reading tonight don't want to keep you too long and reading from The Book of Matthew chapter 18 two verses there three verses verse 18 to 20 Matthew chapter 18 verse 18 to 20 amen everybody feeling fine amen from The Book of Matthew in chapter 18 and verse 18 it says verily I say unto you whatsoever you shall bind Earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever you shall loose on Earth shall be loosed In Heaven There is 19 again I say unto you that if two of you shall agree on Earth as touching anything that they shall ask it shall be done for them of My Father which is in heaven and in verse 20 it says for where two or three are gathered together in my name there I am there am I in the midst of them amen the Lord had a blessing to the reading of his word may we just bow our heads open a word of prayer oh Heavenly Father Lord we consider it such a awesome privilege Lord Lord we love you so much and we so grateful for your grace and your mercy and your love that you've extended towards us tonight Lord to be able to gather together Lord Lord we pray that you will anoint the words that will be spoken tonight Lord I pray that you anoint the the ears the hearts see the minds of those that will not just hear Lord Lord but those that you will Quicken and Inspire and anoint Lord Lord I pray that wherever they are tonight those in the sanctuary those at home those that may be connected via the online connection Lord Lord I pray that your anointing will pour out Lord that your holy spirit will meet them wherever they are Lord Lord raise them up Lord we didn't come here together just to see one another we didn't come together to form a social group Lord but we came together to hear from you Lord to be drawn Closer to You Lord Lord we want to to be perfect we want to to to to to to live such a life Lord that we could be shaped and hounded Lord Lord we want to be molded into your image Lord the way you want us as Sons and Daughters Lord Lord we pray tonight that something be said something be done some song Be Sung Lord Lord that people will know that people will know for sure Lord that that the faith that was once delivered to the Saints is still here Lord Lord we want to to acknowledge that you're Lord and Savior you're King of Kings you're the same yesterday today and forever and something good is about to happen Lord something good is in stored Lord we've come under expectation for the miraculous to take place tonight I pray that you will anoint me and anoint Lord the words that will be spoken Lord speak lip to air to your people Lord Lord anybody could read the scripture but you could bring it to life Lord I pray that the words be made life tonight Lord Lord I pray that you come down and and visit your people in Jesus name we pray amen amen amen blessed be the name you may be seated brother Anthony amen love them for a title tonight seems a little odd but it says friends with fate amen and inspiration relationships are important God God is very very interested in your relationships from the beginning of time when God existed Alone by himself he wanted relationships now I'm not here to talk love and marriage tonight but we talking relationships amen the type of relationship he want is one of accountability one of trust one of faithfulness where he could trust you to do what he said that you should do and that you could hold on to his word and you could believe amen that's the kind of relationship he wants as a matter of fact in in in the Garden of Eden he will come down every evening in cool of the evening and speak to Adam on a one-on-one basis because he wanted Fellowship he wanted to talk and communicate and make sure that we're on the same page we pushing the same head one mind one Accord on the word amen not encouraging each each other in foolishness but we on the word we have a goal a mission our objective and we're going to achieve it together that's the kind of friend he wants that's the kind of friends he want for us so he's very very interested in the type of influences we have he's very interested in the type of relationships we encourage he's very interested in the kind of friends we have around us it doesn't matter what shape or form they come in it might be in the school it might be on the job it might be in the community or the neighborhood it might even be in church but he wants you to have the right kind of friends he wants these relationships to to be Progressive he wants to have the type of relationship that they could depend on you you know often time you you hear stories and you're hear talk and you tell yourself nah they wouldn't do that because you know the person because you know the person you could almost put your neck on a block and you know they don't operate that way they live a particular kind of Life they they they operate at a certain level they don't speak that way they they don't live that way and you feel a level of confidence because it's your friend if it's a stranger anything goes but with God we talking about friends we talking about relationships we talking about the ability to stick closer than a brother the ability to know that my opinion and your opinion is the same why because it's tied to the same post which is the word it's tied together by faith not by our ideas or our thoughts our opinions but it's tie together and we could find it in the word we could find it in the message line upon line so it's not my idea versus yours and who have the greater Revelation no way it's by faith we are connected and God wants that kind of friend for us amen so when you think about it that scripture and I just want to revisit it one more time in Matthew you don't have to find it it says verily I say unto you whatsoever ye bind almost singular you ye bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever ye shall loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven speaking about one in the next verse he went and he said again I say unto you in case you Den he me the first time that if two shall agree on Earth as touching anything that they shall ask it shall be done for them of My Father which is in heaven and almost as if to say in case you didn't hear me I'm going to say it again in verse 20 he say for we're two and three not just one two and three or perhaps four and five or six and seven but where more than one are gathered together in my name there am I in the midst of them amen so that's a scripture so it it remind me when you when it said one can chase a th000 but two would put 10,000 to flight you don't have to fight up anymore because this friendship is not just strong but they're bonded by faith it bonded on the word it could stand up on that and together they could achieve anything amen so it says if you shall agree if you will agree it's not if two shall compete and I do better than you but we agree amen that's what God wants he wants friends to be be the kind of friends that could agree on things that could agree that she's the same yesterday today and forever and the kind of Faith he required back then is the same kind of Fate requires now and if we could do that we'll get the same results there no surprises as a matter of fact the Hebrew boys and we'll get to them in a little bit they didn't have time to do a zoom call they couldn't do a quick WhatsApp chat let's create a little group and see your opinion on this when the word went around and said listen furnace time they were Resolute they had one opinion one view One Voice one word and come and say listen we will not bow down it's not I as a representative of the group I just want to express that the way I feel might be different than the rest but we had a vote and we decide no it was wasn't that we could collectively agree that we will not bow down and if he doesn't deliver we still not bowing down that's what we standing on because we standing on the knowledge that his word Can't Fail his word listen will never return void so we can have faith and confidence in his word that's the kind of friends we want that they could speak an hour behalf and we're not worried we're not scared because we know we stand for the same things we can stand back to back and we not concerned about I wonder if he could stab me back you know to have second thoughts with these kind of friends with the kind of friends that God want for you will cause you to cut out friends that you have now it will cause you to go home and and start to introspect a little bit and say but listen here what going on these friends are really working for me you know I think I need to change I need to change some of them I to replace some some of them I have to come and re-evaluate the relationships I have with them because I don't think these are the kind of relationships that God want for me he want the kind of relationships where my friend friends could keep me accountable where my friends could stand for the same thing as me so they could speak for me knowing that is the opinion I will have because it's grounded in the word of God that's the kind of friends he want like I said the Hebrew boys didn't have time to consult with each other they couldn't come and say listen let's form a group let's see if they could give us um probably 5 days we could meet and we could perhaps after dinner we could talk about it and see how we really feel because because it don't really sound so bad because they say when music play if we just bow a little bit we may not have to bow to the crown but if we could just show reverence To The King by doing that then we will be spared they didn't have time for that they could boldly come and declare this is their position as a group because they were close as a matter of fact we'll get to it in chapter 3 but in Chapter 2 it actually says Daniel because of his relationship with the King because of his position when he was he could have referred his friends that the kind of friend you want so he referred them to the jobs they had they were made Lords and rulers and and they were supervisors basically of Divisions in the Kingdom because Daniel could have referenced them he said listen these fellas they just like me you know so if you're impressed by me you will like these guys that's the kind of friends you want they could support you they could help you they could tell you the truth they could tell you when when you're going wrong they can highlight that and you wouldn't feel bad because it's your friend right so he did this for them and we'll come back to it and we will explore time after time through scripture where friends make or break you not all friends is friends you know so you you look at job and job was going through his his his trial and he had his test to deal with and friends came and they had their opinion but these friends couldn't really encourage him you know they couldn't set him straight and put him on the right path but they were his friends as a matter of fact the prodigal son had friends too you know they could lime they could dance they could listen talk about carry on they had a good time when the money done the friends gone guys not the kind of friends we referring to we referring to the friends and said listen here what going on this is not the kind of testimony you want this is not the way your accustom going this is not the way you should live you're better than that you know the right thing so listen they could come together iron sharpening iron for you to be perfect because they want what's best for you and that's the friend that God wants not the friend that going smile with you now and laughing down the road because you're making a fool of yourself amen so sometimes you wonder why you can't get the results that you're looking for and some people go through that at times Abraham might have thought but look God called me why I can't see the blessing in my life that I believe I am entitled to and God had to call him aside and say listen here what you see this fighting and bickering and and harassment and drama that going on separate yourself from from lot I know he's your friend you know I know you're related I know all you're real good and all you're tight but separate yourself because I have something special for you and once you connected to the these friends or this friend I can't bless you any way I want to I can't pour out onto you the way I want to pour out in your life because you're still too interconnected with the wrong friends I I I hope you're hearing me tonight you know because it calls for a review are your relationships you see to God relationships important he didn't want to be alone so he don't want you be alone but he more concerned about the kind of friends you have the kind of relationships you keep is almost better to be alone than to have the wrong kind of friends you know you don't have to find it but in Daniel chapter 2 chapter 3 and verse 12 I'm going to read a little bit from verse 12 and it says this was an accusation against them at this time right so they do when they do they're working hard and I want to tell you listen your position in life doesn't make you immune to trials it doesn't make you immune to tests and challenges and things going wrong you may feel oh my God I'm so blessed and that sounds good it doesn't change the fact that you're trial next door coming up tomorrow you know it doesn't make it immune So Daniel had a nice lofty position Shadrach mesak Abednego they had their positions they were at ease in Zion the normal living easy good bosses but they came a time in which and I'm going to read it now in verse 12 there are certain Jews whom he have set over the Affairs of the province of Babylon Shadrach mesak bedo these men who came have not regarded thee they serve not thy Gods nor worship the Golem image thou H has set up in verse 13 Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach mesach and abedo then he brought these men before the King Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them is it true oh shadra do not ye serve my gods nor worship the golden image which I have set up because this is the system I put in place and I am the king I am the boss here so you need to really listen I have you where you are at times your natural boss might feel so too you know but promotion don't come from the east or west you know promotion come because your boss like you you know but same the boss like you the boss could unlike you too so in verse 15 he said no this is the negotiation part this is the compromising part he said now if you be ready that at what time you hear the sound of the Cornet flute H sack salery the Simon and all kinds of music you follow and worship the image which I have made well but if you worship not you shall be cast not tomorrow or next week you shall be cast the same hour into the midst of the burning fiery furnace and who that God who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands so he expressing the Wrath at this point he said listen here what I'm not really mean or know I give any options when we play the music you could bow a little bit and you're safe or else I want to know which kind of God will deliver you from the Wrath I have because we have a furnace prepared specially for people who oppose in verse 16 Shadrach mesach and Abednego answered listen they call all three names they didn't have a rap you know all three of them they all answered and said to the king oh Nebuchadnezzar this is the testimony we have this is not just mine this is the one M my friend share with me we all believe this the same thing the same way no deviation line up on line word upon word precept upon precept this is the way we want it to be this is the way God presented to us amen you say listen oh Nebuchadnezzar we are not careful to answer thee in this matter if it be so our God whom we serve is able to Deliver Us From The Burning fiery furnace and he will deliver us out of thine hand oh King not just the furnace but out of your hand out of your wrath out of your negative thoughts in my life or toward me he will Deliver Us from that it went further he said but if not in verse 18 be it known unto thee so we want to make sure it's clear we don't want just say you're misunderstood because we not like you we want you to understand clearly be it known we will not serve thy Gods nor worship the golden image which thou has set up listen if you want to enrage a man show him opposition in this way bold fa too they say listen he was full of Fury and the form of his Visage was change against them therefore he spoke and commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times more than it w was W to be heated so you know this is pressure now seven times more because now you're against him personally this is a personal attack and he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind them Shadrach Meshach and ab bedo and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace and I run it down a little bit in verse 24 he say he was astonished Nebuchadnezzar the King was astonished and Rose up in haste and spake and said unto his councelors did we not cast three men bound into the midst of the fire didn't we bind three men up and cast them in yes am they answered and said unto the king true oh King he answered and said lo I see four men loose walking in the midst of the fire and they have no hurt the form of the fort is like the Son of God but I want to jump to verse 27 it says and the princes Governors and captains and the King's councelors being gathered together saw these men this is when they came out whose bodies the fire had no power nor was an hair of their head singed neither were their coats change the smell of fire had passed on them so listen there was no sign whatsoever you know there was no residue there was no suit there was no discoloration you know the power of God was so listen it was so intense that nothing could separate them from his love you know nothing could impact them you know nothing was going to change their Fai you know nothing could shake it you know they were so determined that nothing was going to overcome that you know am H my god listen this is the good part after all that he made a decree in verse 20 29 here therefore I make a decree that every people nation and language which speak anything things amidst against the god of Shadrach mesach and Abednego shall be cut in pieces and their houses shall be made of down hill because there is no other God that can deliver after this sort then the king promoted s mesach and Abednego in the province of Babylon so listen these are the same guys that oppose them know but this is the kind of friend you want the friend that could support you in keeping your testimony in God and and and having your faith in his word that's the kind of friends you want friends with faith amen I want to shift GE a little bit there were some lepers we know these stories know I'm not creating this I'm not making it up there was some lepers outside the city lepers with a s was a few of them right was four of them actually and brother brandham described this as dingy faith and when they were there they say at the entering of the gate in 2 Kings 7 from verse three he say they were at the front of the gate and they just figured out if I go into the city is death famine in the city there's nothing for me there so if we stay here we going die too so you know what we're going to do he said they rose up in the Twilight in verse 5 to go onto the camp of the syrians and when they were come to the uttermost part of the camp of Syria behold there was no man there for the Lord had made the host of the syrians to hear a noise of Chariots a noise of horses even the noise of a great host they said one to another L the king of Israel had hired against us the kings of the Hittites and the kings of the Egyptians come upon us so this noise was so loud they started to overthink they started to create pictures in the mind of what was taking place that was just the gentle hand of Jehovah you know just creating a way for the lepers because of their faith you know just ensuring that things were cleared for them you know because nobody wanted leprosy around them so God cleared them out in verse 7 wherefore they arose and fled in the Twilight and left their tents and their horses and their asses and even the camp as it was and fled for their life and when these lepers came to the uttermost part of the camp they went into one tent and did eat and drink and carried then silver and gold and rainment and went and hid it and came again and entered into another tent carried then also and went and hid it then they said one to another notice they said one to another everyone had the same idea at that point you know cuz they realized we do it in one tent we go to next next and the result is the same so they started to talk among each other this this is friends to have they start to consult about this and they say they said one to another we do not well this day is a day of Good Tidings and we hold our peace if we T till the morning light some Mischief will come upon us now therefore come that we may go and tell the king's household so they came and call onto the port of the city so listen it wasn't well you you all go ahead because I want to hide some more stuff here we will stay back here they taking no prisoners you know we going we stay in we going in we communicating we going and tell this friends to have when you work together like this with the same mind same Accord same vision based on the word of God nothing could stop you you know they go to the P of the city they told them we came to the camp of the syrians and behold there is no man there neither voice of man but horses tied and asses tied and the tens as were and he called the porters and they told it to the King's house within you see that that is the kind of blessing we talking about you when you could associate yourself with the right people that's what God wants that's when God could move cuz you're not just in a corner doing your own thing now don't get me wrong one is a majority in God you know but just imagine two just imagine tree single eyed and single focused with the same vision establish on the word of God by faith believing his promises my goodness listen referring to Moses there's a there's a there's a message led by the spirit of God 1956 and it was paragraph 56 actually he say he went down there with with this wife on a mule and two little babies with a stick in his hand an old Dead stick in his hand hbling around with the Whiskers hanging down like this perhaps baldheaded going down whiskers along like that his back was all bent over nearly 100 years 80 years you know going on his road down to Egypt that was Moses condition to take over that big nation it goes to show no matter how much in a minority you are as long as you're led by the Holy Ghost one is a majority amen I ask again if one is a majority how about two how about if you join forces if your friends believe the same thing you do you don't realize listen when God said go out in the world and preach he he instructed to evangelize you know he wanted you to have the right type of friends you know he wanted you to share the same word you know the same anointing you know same inspiration you know nothing different he didn't want you manufacture anything he really dictated what he wanted listen paragraph 57 it said it don't make any difference what your neighbors say she say you know what Sally I don't know what's become of her she used to go downtown with me we used to shop and buy all kind of things and clothes but you know she doesn't wear them anymore there's something wrong with Sally sure there is God's got a hold of her that's exactly you know what every time the church bell rings here goes Sally to church well praise God that's good what made difference she got something in her pushing her leading her shoving her that's right that's what happen when you're led by the spirit your friends that you have now will realize something wrong with you you know every minute you want to be reading the Bible every minute you reading the message listening to a tape you going to church every minute so what wrong with you nothing wrong with you it's the Holy Ghost when it get a whole of you you act a little different [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah in a message God keeps his word speaking about Joshua and KB these were friends that's the kind of friends you want to have friends with faith not friends with foolishness friends with faith that could encourage you unto good works that could provoke you a little bit to do the right thing so in paragraph 36 it said now as we see them journeying on they finally come to the place place of Kadesh man just this is just after they left Egypt coming on the road they're now heading over to the promised land yeah just to paint a picture here this sorry that that was a place where there was a great well or Fountain out in the wilderness was one time the Judgment seat of the world many other little Springs come up in the Oasis there around it beautiful type of the Throne of God water life judgment the other little judgment seats churches all springing up around in new Oasis that's where Israel was that's where they were put to the test in paragraph 37 it says now they sent out 10 spies and they crossed over 10 sound like a nice group too you know guess what that's the bigger group it was 12 in all this was the the big group 10 but it had 10 versus too God don't look at the numbers you know God look at your ability to have faith in his word your ability to stand on his promises he not looking at the [Applause] size so they say listen when they came back all but two said this is the 10 it's impossible for us to take the land we just can't do it our opposition is too great we evaluate them for ourselves they said the walls too high we look like grasshoppers be beside them they are Men of War they well trained we have no way of doing it that was the testimony they have is that the kind of testimony you want to have that's not the kind of friends you want God tell you every place you put your foot is yours and your friends saying listen we check it out you know despite what God say this is what we seeing the world's high they are Men of War we like grasshoppers what kind of friends is that that's why I say your relationships are important it's important the influences you have around you it's important the people you're allowed to speak into your life the people you seek advice from the people who are guiding you amen they say all but two you see with this two brother brandom says one Joshua and one Caleb who stood and quietened the people and if there ever was an hour oh listen to this if there ever was an hour that the Church of the Living God needs a Joshua and Caleb it's now that we could quietly the people before the holy spirit all of our little frantics and denominations and PE and running this and this has got it and this has got that stand still a minute God has got it that's the idea this Bible is the answer to every problem that ever come up God has the answer he's got the answer God's got it say that's the idea God has got the answer you set still now of course these ministers who said that we can't do this it's impossible for us to do this there were 10 against two so it was hard nobody said it was going to be easy you know nobody said this this this journey will be easy you know speaking to you now nobody say your life supposed to be easy nobody say because you serve the Lord and I'm a Christian and I've been in church for so many years and my parents with Christians too that life going to be easy he have test customized for you amen he want to rebuke and chase you too he want you to bring forth more fruit he don't want you just exist he want to see what you going to do with the tools he give you what you going to do with the talents he give you he looking for [Music] increase he said that's the way it is today depends on what you're looking at if you're looking at the opposition if you look at the the the corn you're going on mash and I really don't want this one to feel any way about me you know and you know we've been friends for a long time I don't want this I don't want to throw them off now I really don't want them to feel bad we can't do this but he said listen I'm not looking at the opposition or know I'm looking to what God Said what God Said God said it could be done and it will be done but if you're just looking at what's no further than the end of your nose as the expression is it'll never be done because God keeps his word regardless amen with or without you he's still keeping his word so the choice is yours that's that's the beauty about the God I Ser the choice is yours once again I want to shift you see that kind of relationship is so important the people that you consult with the people you talk with I'm reminded in the book of Acts it was Paul and Silas preaching teaching having a good time these are the kind of ministers you want to see things happen when around amen and there's a particular story that's told that there was a woman that used to do all kind of simidi stuff and raise money for her master and Paul spoke spoke to her and all that dried up all the money dried up her ability to do this dried up and it looked like her life just dried up as a result opposition against Paul and Silas because these fellas preaching a kind of gospel that making us poor he preaching a gospel that seems to oppose our thoughts and ideas and our way of doing life because that's what they were accustomed to but here's what happened in Acts chapter 16: 20 and I'll just skip through it says they brought them to the magistrates saying these men being Jews do exceedingly trouble our city they teach Customs which are not lawful for us to receive ceive neither to observe being Romans and the multitude rose up together against them and the magistrates rent off their clothes and commanded to beat them and when they had laid many stripes upon them they cast them into prison charging the Jailer to keep them safely who having received such a charge thrust them into the inner prison and made their feet fast in the stocks what a sight you doing the Lord's business you know you preaching you teaching you're doing the work of the Lord people you know like to have you around but when you see a start to mash the corn when you come in opposition to the people or the status quo who believe you shouldn't be doing that this is where the drama starts so in verse 25 and we know this very popular it say and at midnight Paul and Silas prayed and they sang Praises unto God and the prisoners heard them and suddenly there was a great earthquake so that the foundations of the prison was shaken and immediately all the doors were open and everyone's bands were loosed I didn't want to focus on that too much because they were together in the prison praising and worshiping and and the prisoners could have hear them they weren't doing this quietly they were loud they were praising God they were worshiping because in season out of season friend or no friend it didn't matter what the circumstance was they found themselves in a level of difficulty that they had almost no choice but to praise and worship at the Midnight Hour viewed as one of the darkest hours of the night they decided listen time to praise you know because we locked up already we tied up we tangle up here on the inner parts of the prison what else we will do and listen The Keeper of the prison was awaken out of his sleep because he he was charged to do that and he was sleeping on the outside he say and seeing the prison doors open he drew a sword and would have killed himself supposing that the Prisoners has fled but listen all this was for a reason remember I tell you God want friends with faith he want people who could hold fast to his word and believe and he's concerned and interested in relationships so look look at this we often say you know the praise and it shake it rattle the the prison bars it open up and we say it open bless the name of the Lord Mighty but here's what happens next they say Paul cried out with a loud voice saying do thyself no harm for we are all here we did run away we didn't Escape we didn't have a mutiny we didn't tell the prisoners it's Prison Break let's go no here's what we're doing he called for a light and sprang in and came trembling and fell down before Paul and Silas and brought them out and says s what must I do to be saved this is the mechanism God used to save the Jailer through this experience because they held fast to their testimony and allowed the trial that was sent to them they they listen they gracefully just accept it and embrace it you know because I'm sure he'd never see anything like this imagine having the opportunity to escape and not taken itow they were placed there for a a purpose so imagine he said listen what must I do to be saved in verse 31 and they said believe on the Lord Jesus Christ Thou shalt be saved and thy house and they spake unto him the word of the Lord keep in mind they in prison and to all that were in his house and he took them the same hour of the night and washed their stripes and was baptized and he and all his straight away what a testimony that friends to have that's the kind of friends you want to have listen talk about the work of the Lord and when they had brought them into his house he set meat before them and rejoice believing in God with all his house and when it was days listen hear what happened at the daytime the magistrate sent the sergeant saying let those men go listen we don't need to keep them anymore let those fellas go and they say and The Keeper of the prison told this saying to Paul the magistrate had sent to let you go now depart and go in peace because really and truly and it doesn't say this here God really sent you in this prison so I and my family and my house Soul could be saved that is friends to have that is why you have this kind of relationship God have you where you are you know all you have to do is praise him and worship and bless his name and thank him because listen all things work together for good he called you before the foundation of the world to do this and only you could do it so he depending on you he want you have the right type of testimony can you imagine if Paul and Silas stood in prison and say I don't know what is this now I preaching Sunday Wednesday Sunday every day look them lock me up and beat me tear up my clothes what kind of testimony you'll have but listen at the Midnight Hour they had a praise and worship so loud a earthquake take place the prison bars open and they still Rock back the prisoners hearing them they say listen we not running away we know according to your Customs according to your rules we supposed to be here so listen we assume the position here this is where you place us so we here we not coming here to fight against flesh and blood we're not doing that we know the God we serve and the promise he made to us so we standing by faith on that amen it's important the kind of friends you have he's interested in relationships you know I can't leave this one out there was a guy that was suffering from py in The Book of Mark chapter 2 from verse one it says and again he entered into a capernium after some days and it it was noise that he was in the house so everybody knew Jesus was in the building and straight away many were gathered there in so much that there was no room to receive them no not so much as about the door and he preached the word unto them and they come unto him bring one sick of py which was born off four now listen I want you to understand it's not by chance this man could not bring himself this man didn't walk to a meeting he didn't say can you sign me up for the convention because I understand that Jesus is going to be there he had to have the right kind of friends without them he was going nowhere these friends had to have faith and believe that listen we not leaving you here because we could go for ourselves we could operate and we could tell you about how the service is but we are friends with faith we believe that Jesus can have an impact on you today we believe if we go you go if we stay in you staying because we are friends and that the kind of relationship we want to have relationships that are so important yeah that we could have a a relationship in which the foundation is Faith in which the foundation is the word of God so that's the kind of relationship they had here so they said they came to him bringing one and he was born of four so four of his friends was bringing him when they couldn't come nigh unto him for the Press they uncover the roof where he was was and when they broke it up they let down the bed wherein the sick of the pulsy lay when Jesus saw their faith now Jesus wasn't seeing the operation you know he was seeing their faith their belief that listen nothing going to stop me tonight from receiving the blessing I come for the change I looking for I'm not going home without it we have come here to see a crowd and say n we will come back tomorrow no no no no no no no we want to receive it tonight we want to receive it now we don't want to leave without that change taking place and because they believe that they could come I'm pretty sure based on today's standers a roof is not a cheap item any con construction person or contractor will say your foundation and a roof is the most expensive part so for you to tear up the roof that is not yours you had to be convinced you had to be sure that listen when I burst this thing up the master going to see the need and he's going to meet the need because I'm going to do something that is not the norm I'm going to do something different something radical something that is against the status quo you may not think about it but are we going to do it because we are the right type of friends we have faith that our friend could be healed tonight we have faith that he can be delivered tonight amen so listen hallah they broke it up they sent on the bed and in verse 5 when Jesus saw their faith he said unto the sick of the P say son thy sins be forgiven thee amen and in verse six once again the blessings of God don't make you immune to jealousy and envy and and spirits and backbiting and people trying to come against you you know not because God bless you mean oh I have such a hedge around me I at e in Zion we know the story of job but we see it here the sins be forgiven thee in the next verse but there was a certain of the scribes sitting there and reasoning in their hearts why do this man thus speak blasphemies who can forgive sins but God only they're not testifying and rejoicing with the fact that this these guys amazing boy they come down the roof this is a sight to see a spectacle no they get in a fight with what was said so I would say they're focusing on the wrong thing but they have their role immediately when Jesus perceived in spirit that they so reasoned within themselves they didn't see this they reasoning within themselves he said unto them why reason you these things in your hearts cuz you see he could see inside there you could do what you want you could act you could play you could be nice on the outside and pretend and everybody everything is everything but he's seeing the inside you know so he perceive in the heart and he asked them why reason these things in the heart whether it is easier to say to to the sick of the pulsy thy sins be forgiven thee or to say arise take up thy bed and walk but that you may know just to be sure just in case you had a question about the way we operating arise he say but that you may know that the son of man had power on Earth to forgive sins he said to the sick of the pulsy I say unto thee arise take up thy bed go thy way into thine house and verse 12 say and immediately amen he didn't tell his friends hey fellas it was nice I understand what you say immediately he arose took up his bed went forth before them all in so much that they were all amazed and glorified God saying we never saw it on this fashion that is the kind of friends you want to have that is friends with faith friends that go in the distance they putting the neck on a block for you they ripping up the roof for you they love you they care about you you could trust them you have confidence in them because all you Bound by the word of God all you're bound on faith the promises of God not old J Hallelujah you know interestingly enough the disciples were really friends with faith amen the real test for them wasn't how long they walk with God or know or how far or who walk on water or who you know who was ask a question and didn't answer fast enough that that wasn't the test you know it wasn't who had the Revelation and who was was closer to him and who walk on the right side it wasn't that when all was said and done they had to face the word test it was one of obedience and Faith when he came and he said listen ter I want you to wait I want you to have patience and wait in the upper room you get an instruction so at this point point is a leveler it didn't matter if I call you first I call you second I call you last it didn't matter everybody had the same test and all you want to to follow me follow my word that is the instruction I give you want to be my friend or you walk with me three and a half years oh okay good follow the instruction wait T in Jerusalem amen listen they had to T there and come to a position in which they were in one mind and one Accord there was no fighting and arguing there was no personality battles nobody was trying to outdo the next one and and I singing better and and I I could say a different word and I could worship faster and I could pray longer it wasn't that you know they reach a point in which everybody on the same level everybody obedient to his word that's the kind of friends you want friends I could push you to righteousness friends that could push you to trust in God's word to stand on his promises that the friends you want friends with faith that could be single focused or you're on the same Mission listen I say listen how could two walk together at least they agree you know that's the kind of friends you want all you could agree all you know the master say wait are waiting he said t are taring he say wait here are waitting here and and not figuring it out myself I'm not trying to show that I'm brighter than you or wealthier than you or or a more experienced than than you we all following the same instruction we all marching in the same step to the same beat to the same drum because we're in the same Army supporting each other by faith that's the kind of friends you want now they all had to wait until the Holy Ghost came but listen if you want to learn anything do anything be anything I have seen the easiest way to get there is to model people to hang around them people who have done it before if you want to be a Mason work for a Mason volunteer for a Mason you want to be an artist go work in a gallery work along people along side persons who more experience than you because they could teach you they could Mentor you they could guide you they could teach you and show you things that you may not know even if it's in a book it may take you a long time learn from the experience right Elijah didn't sit down with elishah and say listen let me go through the schools with you know because it took me 20 years to learn what I know you have to there's a phrase we use where we say you have to pay your dues no he didn't say you have to pay your dues and know so you had to take 20 years no he showed him he showed him when the disciples Walk With Jesus he showed them it was action there any kind of friends you want not just telling you but they're showing you they're showing you these steps to improve to build to level up that's who you want around you not PE people secretive and the in the background and the distance and speaking just hypothetical things no you want to be guided by people who have the experience amen now if you want to have a baby they say hang around folks who have babies H hang around mothers hang around people who have the experience so you could learn from them learn the things to do and likewise if you want the Holy Ghost amen what you have to do you fellowship with them you talk to them you relate to them you find out how they operating how they manage certain things how they navigate particular things because you want that too so you muddle after them that's the kind of friend you want if these are the things you want that's the guideline that's the easiest way amen amen hallelujah yeah these are the things you want to achieve these are the kind of friends you want around you these are the people you want to be attracted to no matter listen you could be pulled this way the job pull you this way the school pull you that way listen I say listen God not trying to to create a bonsai tree you know Bonsai pretty but they do twist the branch so and twist it forward and twist it backwards and twist it all over that that is not how how you want you you know listen he wants sons and daughters that he could fellowship with he want your signature to be like like his own he want to look down and say there is my spirit flowing freely he want you have a testimony he wants you to represent him that's the kind of relationship he want he wants when you walk listen this is this is Jesus on two feet you know listen he could look at you and say a chip off the old block what you say is exactly how I would say it that's what you want and that's the kind of friends he want you to have too that when all you talk listen you could almost finish his sentences because all you think are like all you operate are like because all you're bound by the word of God musicians could get ready at the end of the day this message is a message about faith it's about belief it's about trust it's about value in God's word and in a a message faith is the six sense where BR said what is it holding on that six sense not the five we accustomed to he said there's something that makes it real yes sir through the six sense has subdued kingdoms amen the six sense subdued kingdoms through the six sense the walls of Jericho fell flat to the ground amen you believe that the walls of Jericho hit the ground through the six sense through the six sense the sea couldn't drun Paul when he went down there when all hope was gone when he saw a vision of the Angel of the Lord he came back up and says be of a good courage what was the matter no moon or stars for 14 days and night it was just as black as it ever was the storm was just as great as it ever was but that six sent went to work when he seen the angel of the Lord hallelujah that six sense couldn't keep Peter in jail no sir the power of God sent an angel in there and delivered him the six sense couldn't keep Paul and Silas in stocks God sent an earthquake and shook the whole thing down that six sense let it go to work for you sometime because that six sense the Lions couldn't eat Daniel they couldn't fool with that six sense no sir by that six sense the fire couldn't burn the Hebrew children up by that same six sense I was working in Little Martha when she came to see Jesus raised her brother out of the Grave after being dead for 4 days that same six sense clean a leper that same six sense raise up Jesus on the third day that same six sense will Rapture the church one of these days and take it out of here to glory amen Hallelujah you know it is so important how you manage your atmosphere and the things around you the people around you brother brandom one time he spoke about giving a guy a drop and the guy spoke a Blue Streak this wasn't a crazy guy this is somebody you're giving a drop to you're doing a favor to when Jes Jesus went to raise Gyro's daughter one of the first things he did he said listen I just want friends with faith in here you know so all your unbelief had to come out come outside because you will hinder the moving of the spirit of God you will hinder the moving of the power of God here with your unbelief I don't want that kind of atmosphere around me I want Faith he too was concerned about the relationships he had he too was concerned about the atmosphere around them for the power to work you have to be concerned about that you have to be cognizant and conscious of that and the decision you make and the role that you play cuz like I say it doesn't matter how blessed you are you know it doesn't matter how much Services you attend or how experienced you are or how old or young or rich or poor it doesn't matter at the end of the day when the test comes only your faith in God's word will stand amen that alone nothing else no talk and no song and you have a special word today no your faith were you faithful to his word were you faithful to his promise would you stand firm and stand on the Promises of God believing that he's a rewarder them that diligently seek him you could play my faith looks up to thee last scripture as we close as I think of a personal testimony it's so important to be consistent across the board it's so important that your friends your relatives your neighbors know who you are and what you stand for it's so important that you are the same Monday to Sunday in the Book of James James 1: 1-8 as we close it says a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways my brethren count it all joy when you fall in diverse Temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience but let patience have her perfect work that he may be perfect and entire wanting nothing if any of you lack wisdom let him ask God and give it to all men liberally and unraid it not and it shall be given to him in verse six but let him ask in faith nothing wavering so he don't want you to have unbelief and doubt nothing wavering he for he that waver it is like a wave of a wave of the sea driven with a wind and TOS for not for for let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord so don't be doubting and expect that you're getting anything don't expect that your your faith failing and God just going to show up strong for you no he want to find that Faith he want you to believe he want you to trust him he want you to have that confidence in his word and in verse eight a
