[19:47] Oh
[19:47] [Music]
[19:50] Priya's goes to get the beer tonight
[19:53] Amen god bless you if our Bibles are
[19:56] ligated to Romans chapter 7
[19:58] second Corinthians up the tree and then
[20:01] we go to Romans up to 12 verse 50
[20:03] reading tonight
[20:09] Romans chapter seven million from verse
[20:13] one to six
[20:15] know ye not brethren for I speak to them
[20:17] that know the law but the law had
[20:21] dominion over a man as long as he liveth
[20:23] for the woman which had an husband is
[20:26] bound by the law to her husband so long
[20:28] as he liveth but if the husband be dead
[20:30] she is loosed from the law of a husband
[20:33] so then if while her husband liveth she
[20:36] be married to another man she shall be
[20:39] called an adulteress but if a husband be
[20:41] dead she is free from the law that law
[20:44] so she's no adulteress though she be
[20:47] married to another man
[20:49] wherefore my brethren ye also have
[20:52] become dead to the law by the body of
[20:55] Christ that you should be married to
[20:57] another even to him who is raised from
[21:00] the dead that we should bring forth
[21:02] fruit on the court for when we were in
[21:05] the flesh the motions of sins which were
[21:08] by the law did work in our members to
[21:11] bring forth fruit on the debt
[21:13] but now we are delivered from the law
[21:16] that being dead where we were held that
[21:19] we should serve in the newness of spirit
[21:22] are not in the oldness of the letter and
[21:27] reading from second Corinthians chapter
[21:30] three do we begin to commend ourselves
[21:33] or need we are some others epistles of
[21:36] commendation to you letters of
[21:38] combination from you
[21:40] Yahoo pistol written in our hearts known
[21:42] and read from you from all of all men
[21:46] for as much as ye are manifestly
[21:48] declared to be a pistol of Christ
[21:50] ministered by US written not with ink
[21:53] but with the spirit of the Living God
[21:55] not in tables of stone but in fleshy
[21:58] tables of the heart okay let's continue
[22:06] and such trusts have we true Christ a
[22:09] God would not that we are sufficient
[22:11] ourselves to think anything of ourselves
[22:13] but our sufficiency is of God who what
[22:16] meters evil ministers of the New
[22:18] Testament not of the letter but of the
[22:21] spirit for the letter killeth but the
[22:23] spirit to give it life and I'll ask of
[22:26] you from Romans chapter 12 I beseech you
[22:28] therefore brethren by the mercies of God
[22:30] that you present your bodies a living
[22:32] sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which
[22:35] is your reasonable service and be not
[22:38] conformed to this world
[22:40] but be transformed by the renewing of
[22:42] your mind that you may prove that what
[22:46] is that what is that good and acceptable
[22:48] and perfect will of God s ballheads
[22:50] Father we thank you for your word
[22:52] tonight you come and interpret it to our
[22:54] hearts and speak Lord to us know that
[22:57] our lives will be changed and the image
[22:59] and likeness granted father in Jesus and
[23:02] I ask it
[23:02] amen you may be seated or praise the
[23:05] Lord
[23:09] tonight our title courts power to
[23:12] transform his seed to produce his kind
[23:15] God's power to transform his seed to
[23:19] produce his kind of a conduct scripture
[23:21] from Genesis 1 it says in the beginning
[23:23] God created heaven in the earth it was a
[23:25] tall form and void and darkness was upon
[23:27] the face of the deep and this period of
[23:30] God move on the face of the waters and
[23:31] God said let there be light and it was
[23:33] light and God saw the light that it was
[23:36] good and God devises a light from the
[23:39] darkness and God called the light day
[23:41] the darkness he called night and the
[23:43] evening in the morning were the first
[23:44] day
[23:45] and God said let there be a firmament in
[23:47] the midst of the waters and let it
[23:49] divide the waters from the waters and
[23:51] God made the firmament and divided the
[23:53] waters which were under the firmament
[23:54] from the waters which were above the
[23:56] firmament and it was so and God called
[23:59] the firmament heaven and the evening and
[24:01] the morning were the second day
[24:02] and God said let the waters under the
[24:04] heaven be gathered again in one place
[24:06] and let the dry land appear and it was
[24:08] so and God called the dry land earth the
[24:11] garden together of the waters called he
[24:13] seas and God saw it was good and God
[24:16] said let the earth bring forth grass the
[24:19] herb yielding seed and the fruit tree
[24:21] yielding fruit after his kind whose seed
[24:25] is in itself upon the earth and it was
[24:27] so on the it brought forth grass of the
[24:30] appearance seed after his kind and the
[24:33] tree even fruit whose seed was in itself
[24:35] after his kind and God saw it was good
[24:39] so if I know from Genesis 1:26 every
[24:44] seek on the bring forth after its kind
[24:45] and but abandonment is invisible unit
[24:48] brightest prenup prayer you seal God
[24:51] knowing she know fragile we are knowing
[24:56] that we are walking on the brittle
[24:58] treads of life of this mortal life not
[25:02] knowing what time that we're going to be
[25:05] someone's to answer on hi
[25:07] let us O Lord lay aside everything in
[25:10] our heart everything in our mind and
[25:13] look straight to your word tonight for
[25:16] you to come and interpret it but live in
[25:19] Oracle's grant it may your spirit fall
[25:23] upon us and anoint the wood or heart
[25:25] that we might go from here this evening
[25:27] better people that we are now but we
[25:30] might have a closer insight on Jesus
[25:32] Christ granted Lord that we might
[25:35] understand the day we are living and the
[25:38] preparation of God for this hour for his
[25:41] people miss our this great crucial dark
[25:44] time that we're now living in God anoint
[25:47] us not only speaker but here and
[25:49] together make our hearts to tremble at
[25:54] your word
[25:55] for the fear of God is the beginning of
[25:58] wisdom grant these things father we ask
[26:00] in Jesus name Amen oh praise the name of
[26:04] the Lord what a prayer oh praise the
[26:07] name of the Lord are you ready for the
[26:10] word tonight
[26:11] so we know we find out that Elohim he
[26:14] men came down and spoke to Abraham when
[26:16] Sarah died wife and this all spoke or
[26:19] agency Brown says and he said I'm going
[26:21] to visit you I'm going to visit you
[26:23] according to the time of life and you're
[26:27] gonna have that baby that you're waiting
[26:28] on and hear the prophecy the Lateran is
[26:31] fixin to fall you have held that seed in
[26:35] there long enough believing but you are
[26:38] looking for coming son but he is coming
[26:41] so right now tonight you're under
[26:43] prophecy of the Lateran fixin to fall so
[26:47] that's that's the seer the Lord nobody
[26:49] could change that nobody could say that
[26:51] not going to happen
[26:52] so the rain is not the problem or glory
[26:56] that God is if the seed is there or
[26:58] glorious his seed has to be there isn't
[27:00] that right so he said the real church
[27:02] today you said God has promised be
[27:03] careful God has promised in Malachi 4
[27:06] for this last day and Malachi 4 he was
[27:08] saying this has not yet been fulfilled
[27:10] it must be fulfilled because it is the
[27:12] germanized Word of God spoken to Malachi
[27:15] the prophet all scripture has to be
[27:19] fulfilled must be and the Bible is to be
[27:23] finished the Gentile dispensation is to
[27:26] be finished with the church age when his
[27:29] anointed messenger arrives
[27:30] of course listen he will plant the seed
[27:33] of the entire Bible plumb from the
[27:35] serpent to the messenger in the former
[27:37] rain so the prophecy was that the end
[27:41] the seed of the entire Bible would be
[27:43] planted
[27:44] that was what peravaram came to do to
[27:47] plant the seed of the entire Bible and
[27:49] there are only two Bibles well Gloria
[27:52] has gone to zodiac the pyramid and this
[27:54] Bible that we have so that pyramid Bible
[27:57] was the seed that per around him the
[27:59] plant a Bible inside of you isn't that
[28:01] right Oh glory to God
[28:03] so this prick Scripture we read and
[28:06] balarama's was given it and invisibly on
[28:08] the bride
[28:09] Paul was given illustration about margin
[28:11] divorce it pertains the greater portion
[28:14] of margin divorce and hold that he's
[28:15] trained in certain order the church can
[28:17] no more be married to the world and the
[28:19] christ at the same time and be legal and
[28:22] lawful about it then it can be a woman
[28:24] to be living with a husband while she
[28:26] has a live-in husband no he said I
[28:28] believe is to my belief that it unfolds
[28:31] one of the great mysteries of prophecy
[28:34] no woman is always tied to church
[28:37] because the church is considered a bride
[28:38] she's the bride for the Lord Jesus and
[28:41] if you watch the conditions of one
[28:43] conduct a woman you would see where the
[28:45] church is at you watch anything in the
[28:47] natural and nature and watch it in the
[28:50] spiritual also and if you watch the
[28:52] conduct of woman in the world today
[28:54] what's the convict duck of worldly
[28:56] churches today and the conduct of the
[28:58] spiritual bride the natural so-called
[29:00] cream to be bright notice when the
[29:03] spiritual bride when she begins to have
[29:07] a revival begins the honey revival when
[29:11] she begins to come back and line
[29:13] yourself up with the Word of God
[29:14] so all this is prophecy the bride will
[29:17] begin to line yourself up back the Word
[29:19] of God watch them again how the
[29:21] scripture at that time there'd be a
[29:23] message sweep up to cut that break or
[29:26] glory that God's of God looking for
[29:28] their hearts that want to line up with
[29:29] this world because the world is the
[29:31] conduct of the Spirit isn't that right
[29:33] and today oh praise God we see the
[29:36] church natural in your intellectual
[29:38] gospel going further and further away
[29:40] from the world in social gospel we find
[29:43] a woman of the world on the streets
[29:44] members of such kind himself and the
[29:47] same atmosphere they have lost the sense
[29:49] of command
[29:50] see there she is that is her behavior
[29:52] but you'll notice when the people begin
[29:57] to try to line up with the word there
[30:01] comes a fresh message from the Word of
[30:03] God straight to the people and they
[30:06] catch that message and line up with it
[30:08] every time remember what the message
[30:10] come to do we pay our hearts for the
[30:12] coming of the Lord is the message of
[30:14] preparation you have a message out for
[30:16] on my second coming I'm John was center
[30:19] for on the first coming of the Lord and
[30:21] the message was PPA either way of the
[30:23] Lord isn't that right so Paul was saying
[30:26] a woman cannot remarry until a foolish
[30:28] husband is dead she cannot remarry as
[30:31] long as her first husband is living by
[30:33] no circumstances at all she must remain
[30:35] single as long as a foolish husband is
[30:38] living and other than that she being
[30:40] silly she recorded an adulteress right
[30:43] he said no watch saw the church when she
[30:46] tries to mix Creed and denomination with
[30:48] the Word of God
[30:49] she can't be married to denomination and
[30:53] be the Bride of Christ at the same time
[30:54] she has got to be deadly to one or the
[30:57] other there's plenty of lodging boys
[30:59] would and Paul was speaking the same
[31:01] thing she cannot be married to a church
[31:03] or worldly creed and be the Bride of
[31:05] Christ if you are married to Christ here
[31:08] we go Christ is the word or glory to God
[31:12] so you get locked in yeah I've nothing
[31:13] to do what your husband said what the
[31:15] church say what the bishop see is what
[31:17] the word say or Gloria has got crisis a
[31:20] word and he's the Living Word he always
[31:22] was the word he is still the word and he
[31:25] will be the word he was the only the
[31:28] manifestation of the attributes of God
[31:30] because he was the son of God so Christ
[31:32] the word was the actual manifestation of
[31:34] the attributes of God and any son is an
[31:37] attribute of his father and just as you
[31:39] were in the genes of your father in the
[31:41] body of your father when he was a young
[31:43] boy you were in him yet you could not
[31:46] have fellowship with you because he
[31:49] didn't know you and to the Bennigan's of
[31:51] a mother you were brought forth into the
[31:53] earth
[31:53] and becoming the image of your father
[31:55] and then he could fellowship with you
[31:57] so were you sons and daughters of God
[31:59] before there was a moon before there was
[32:01] the star molecule you are sons and
[32:04] daughters of God and you are only the
[32:06] physical manifestation of the attributes
[32:09] that she wasn't gone in the beginning
[32:10] for there's only one form of eternal
[32:13] life and that was you before you don't
[32:15] know nothing about it did you know
[32:17] anything that when you were in your
[32:19] earthly father but you are manifested in
[32:21] his image in the image of God you are
[32:24] made you were manifested for the glory
[32:26] and the fellowship of God I want to
[32:29] highlight that that tonight you were
[32:31] manifested for what for the glory and
[32:33] the fellowship of God God wants
[32:36] fellowship or glory that God don't go to
[32:39] want your silence he wants your praise
[32:41] he wants your worship he wants tell us
[32:44] if he wants your communion with him
[32:45] isn't that right and I'll show us your
[32:48] gene had to be in your father before
[32:50] your natural birth your spiritual gene
[32:52] had to be in God because you are an
[32:55] expression of the attributes of his
[32:57] thoughts before the foundation of the
[32:58] world
[32:59] no we are wrong it so these torches that
[33:02] were about an expression we can't get
[33:03] away from it you have to be a gene in
[33:06] his thoughts you have to be his seed to
[33:09] bring forth his cane because there's a
[33:11] kind that God has there has to be
[33:14] producing this last day we remember seed
[33:16] only our potential until it comes forth
[33:19] you don't know what I see really is or
[33:21] glory to God so it have potential in
[33:23] seed but until the seed be manifested
[33:26] you don't know what that scene really is
[33:27] Oh glory to God the seed after come
[33:30] forth to be vindicated to be manifested
[33:33] to be Express or glory they've got
[33:36] pumpkin seed and wallop watermelon seed
[33:38] it looks similar it's not the same so if
[33:40] you hold the seeds in your hand you
[33:41] don't know watches pumpkin you know what
[33:43] is watermelon but plant it whoa let the
[33:46] rain fall on it
[33:47] let the vine begin to grow then you will
[33:49] see what this pumpkin and what is
[33:50] watermelon or glory there boychik what
[33:53] put the seeds on the earth honey pant it
[33:55] isn't that right
[33:56] hallelujah no the rain is about to fall
[33:58] that's the prophecy 6 into 4 or
[34:01] hallelujah
[34:02] that thank you Lord the nomination has
[34:06] separated the people from the Word of
[34:08] God then Jesus said you through your
[34:11] tradition of me the commandments of God
[34:13] of no effect
[34:14] and through our Creed we have
[34:19] disassociated the fellowship of the holy
[34:21] spirit to anoint the will of God
[34:25] that is for our generation also sit and
[34:28] see any trick of the devil to twist the
[34:31] word that the anointing cannot come on
[34:33] the word to anointed to make it live for
[34:36] your time and season Oh hallelujah
[34:39] and Gordon every generation adds a new
[34:41] part of his book it also gets a goes
[34:43] together like my body was built it
[34:45] started from the spine and wasn't all
[34:47] spine is went to ribs and lungs and her
[34:49] hands and arms and feet and it come out
[34:51] to be the person that I am so God
[34:54] manifested in the beginning he appeared
[34:56] as Jehovah God the Father he has PSS got
[34:59] the Sun in Jesus Christ now we are
[35:01] Pierce has got the Holy Ghost the same
[35:02] God three manifestation of the same God
[35:05] and God has allotted his word from the
[35:08] beginning so we are not in Luther's age
[35:09] we're not in Wesley age we got into the
[35:11] headship age where the Holy Ghost is
[35:14] calling a Holy Ghost Bunch or to be
[35:16] honed and to be cut them to be fitted in
[35:19] the headstone calling you to higher
[35:21] ministry we believe that so just like
[35:24] evolution just like the first thing
[35:25] created and hope that how the signs get
[35:27] messed up because they saw a progression
[35:29] from frog to dis the animals right of
[35:32] the monkey and then man so they saw
[35:34] something looking like it is evolution
[35:36] but God was startled on the small bone
[35:38] right at all not evolution money come
[35:40] from monkey or glory to God God said let
[35:43] us make man isn't that right
[35:44] so what's he saying you know he said
[35:46] like botany like then and in my life he
[35:49] created human life evolution rising
[35:51] higher so has been Gordon his truth just
[35:54] being shot on a looter pulling that
[35:55] right out then I just lesion looter
[35:57] certification the Wesley he the
[36:00] evolution of the spirit or glory that
[36:04] God that's a bill called the evolution
[36:06] of the spirit justification and tip of
[36:08] the spirit certification another tip of
[36:10] the spirit the penny cousin another
[36:12] different the spirit what we going for
[36:14] into the person of the whole course
[36:16] itself or glory their God every wrong
[36:19] has to go higher but because I lost some
[36:22] praises tonight because it's a body he
[36:24] is building that is coming to a head is
[36:27] that that gesture is a body or either
[36:31] God is that right John was the neck and
[36:34] Jesus was the head that chap of the Old
[36:36] Testament and he become the cornerstone
[36:38] of the new testament or glory of God and
[36:41] John the Baptist John Jesus hallelujah
[36:44] John Elijah coming his last day to be
[36:46] the neck as it was to introduce the
[36:48] Messiah his head check the full body
[36:51] word or glory that God is that right so
[36:54] if you're married at Christ she the
[36:56] bride gonna be married to a church in
[36:58] nomination at the same time she cannot
[37:00] live with both husbands they are
[37:02] contrary one to another let every man
[37:05] will be a lie and mine be true a woman
[37:09] is entrusted with certain characters she
[37:12] must not defile a woman is trusted to
[37:14] that there's not a creature like a woman
[37:17] there's no female dog no female of any
[37:19] kind and trusted with the character that
[37:22] a woman is a woman was not even in the
[37:24] beginning of the creation because God no
[37:26] he would fall all other females could
[37:29] not commit adultery
[37:30] she's the only one that could commit
[37:32] adultery and she has been made if she
[37:35] had been made like the original that
[37:37] would have been this complementary to
[37:38] God's great wisdom but she was a
[37:40] byproduct of a man and because she was
[37:42] cast over in that side she also have
[37:45] been given a sacred charge on God for
[37:47] redemption
[37:48] she got character she must not defile
[37:50] her body is given to her a sacred trust
[37:54] no female dog no bird
[37:56] Norah Manimal norther creature like
[37:58] she is the only one the reason it is so
[38:01] sacred is because she has to bring what
[38:03] life into the earth
[38:05] her body is the betting rounds of life
[38:08] dear father that's the reason he gives
[38:10] this a secret trust notice we find her
[38:14] body is the bed and groans therefore
[38:16] it's a sacred trust not to define that
[38:19] I'm speaking out bringing this
[38:20] illustration to show you where the
[38:22] church stands I'm not speaking of you
[38:24] woman whatever you are that's between
[38:26] you and God and you men I'm speaking of
[38:28] the church and Christ and she is given
[38:30] to bring forth life only God Himself can
[38:33] give her husband might be the jewel Mira
[38:35] but God Himself has to produce the life
[38:38] that's in the natural what more in the
[38:42] spiritual which man could produce the
[38:44] life it will take God to produce life or
[38:47] his court to produce life that all life
[38:50] has to come from God any life has to
[38:54] come from God it's perverted it's sinful
[38:57] but life has to come from God because
[39:00] he's the author of life or glory no God
[39:04] can we get a lot of shout life has to
[39:07] come from God whereas the prostitute
[39:09] weathers a whole long it doesn't matter
[39:10] life comes from God someone she has a
[39:14] secret trust of womanhood committed to
[39:16] her she must not break the womanhood I'm
[39:19] speaking of here is a conduct a
[39:21] character around men now keep the church
[39:24] in mind she's kissing and slopping and
[39:26] mixing with everything else but the word
[39:28] let the devil and education and so forth
[39:30] she has a sacred womanhood now we find
[39:33] out she has been given this sacred trust
[39:36] she must not break of womanhood
[39:39] and I corrected to research ildren to be
[39:42] honorable to husband what a secret trust
[39:47] what a responsibility to almond you see
[39:52] why she the type of the church which has
[39:55] there we go
[39:56] the same responsibility as a woman has a
[40:02] secret ability to her motherhood to her
[40:07] virtues to a husband the church has a
[40:11] secret responsibility to prayer to the
[40:16] word and to Christ just the same as all
[40:20] my night all glory to God today here
[40:24] better internet the church have a sacred
[40:27] responsibility to prayer to the word
[40:31] under Christ I went the Holy Spirit told
[40:35] about the man I'm bigger than and right
[40:36] he said the church the bride church
[40:39] comes to the headstone in the last days
[40:42] will be a super church a super race as
[40:45] she nears a headstone they will be so
[40:49] much like him they will be this very
[40:52] image so that is the purpose of this
[40:54] message that we could be conformed to
[40:57] the image of Christ
[40:58] the purpose is best is not about vials
[41:00] and walls and plagues and Rome and Los
[41:04] Angeles dynami purpose that's that's
[41:07] friends the goal for the message the
[41:09] message address the whole it the message
[41:12] addressed all loosens serpent seed but
[41:15] that knowledge is that what images come
[41:16] to give the message come to bring an
[41:18] image that we can become that image
[41:21] because you become what you behold if
[41:24] you don't see it you can't become it you
[41:26] have to see you to become it to become
[41:29] what you behold we stand on a glass and
[41:32] by being changed and being transformed
[41:34] from glory to glory as we see that image
[41:37] we become like that
[41:39] you have to see it you have to see see
[41:42] something bigger than yourself you have
[41:44] to be rather little evil in the banner
[41:46] of the chicken because you only see a

[48:47] the Catalina Liars Bible said born and

[48:55] Tyler Lyons wear white coat white
[48:58] everything is the liars they need
[49:00] confusion they need to be born again
[49:02] then we fire every man-jack need fire
[49:06] hallelujah don't be afraid to testify
[49:08] didn't need God
[49:10] they're making more the knees caught but
[49:12] the need for any halt give me power to
[49:14] meet God need a testimony your witness
[49:18] remember the Connolly but they will be
[49:22] the very manifestation of the wood of
[49:23] the living gorgeous bright denominations
[49:26] can never produce this they reduced
[49:28] their crease and dogmas mixed with the
[49:30] world and bring a hybrid product the
[49:33] first son was a spoken seed would first
[49:36] son what it was said let us make man in
[49:39] our image and all like this
[49:44] speak Adam o Adam comedy motor words
[49:49] then God formed a dustman what you see
[49:52] in all tonight form annals of the earth
[49:54] take some doesn't bring him off from
[49:56] there and put this first man inside of
[49:57] that man got it first time was a spirit
[50:00] man there was no man to destroy there
[50:05] was no physical man but the first man
[50:07] with our spirit man and God put that
[50:09] spirit man and a physical body
[50:10] that's why course it does the lacked and
[50:13] to dust oh shut we came to behave like
[50:16] that I said you know right back where
[50:17] you come from or glory of God you
[50:20] understand what I'm saying because God
[50:22] yes the deepest world oh my
[50:28] now the first time was a spoke more seed
[50:30] of God
[50:31] he was giving my brain to reproduce
[50:34] himself so the object of this thing
[50:37] called brain is for reproduction so
[50:40] Christ having a bribe because he want
[50:41] children after his kind
[50:47] not just as a immaturity of a bride
[50:49] that's to produce his kind a
[50:52] reproduction of the theme original book
[50:55] of acts a reproduction of what the
[50:57] apostle's have that's why William animus
[51:00] Center Tillinghast back to the faith of
[51:02] the fathers because that was the came
[51:05] that quad producing original brother
[51:07] George that is alpha church that's how
[51:10] to be really a church we don't want
[51:12] nothing less than that we act like

[51:50] like never before because this is a
[51:53] darkest age this is the darkest hour
[51:55] they went cross darkness cover the earth
[51:57] and close that with other people so you
[51:59] like shining light right now because yet
[52:10] but the Lateran is fixin to for a fool

[1:00:14] that church rises it's gonna bring the
[1:00:16] bedroom then there will be a general
[1:00:18] resurrection but the power going to
[1:00:21] strike the lottery secrets as the word
[1:00:31] is in the brain and she has the mind of
[1:00:34] christ it has to be coming to maturity
[1:00:36] no maturity to catch the main of cars
[1:00:40] make what could give that mind is
[1:00:42] supreme a mountain but iran says knowing
[1:00:45] what an home
[1:00:46] jesus had to supreme anointing upon him
[1:00:48] and when this anointing came upon him
[1:00:50] the spirits upon me he went and sit down

[1:01:01] item is knowing what an how is the mind
[1:01:04] of christ the intelligence of god to
[1:01:06] know what the spirit wants done
[1:01:09] Oh glory to God hallelujah she does it

[1:01:23] Holy Spirit waters it until it's grown
[1:01:25] and serve its purpose day in the bride
[1:01:29] do only his will
[1:01:31] no man no one can persuade them
[1:01:34] different this stubborn outside you will
[1:01:39] have what is stubborn somebody said do
[1:01:42] this do this do this this stubborn
[1:01:44] hallelujah
[1:01:45] no one can persuade him differently they
[1:01:48] have dust said the Lord or the keep
[1:01:50] still they will do the works of God for
[1:01:53] it is himself in them continuing his
[1:01:57] word to fulfill as he did complete in
[1:02:00] his deeds all things when he was here he
[1:02:02] did not complete all when he was here
[1:02:04] for it was not kind yet then he said let
[1:02:08] us not like just one killer
[1:02:10] watch and it was nearing time to be
[1:02:13] given and Joshua means Savior represent
[1:02:17] the end time leaders they take this is
[1:02:18] over Caleb represent the true believer
[1:02:21] who stayed with Joshua watch God started
[1:02:26] Israel as a vision with his word but
[1:02:28] they wanted something different so did
[1:02:29] the last day Church how God is not moved
[1:02:32] Israel until its own appointed time so
[1:02:36] when people find God time taken too long
[1:02:38] people say this is the time they give me
[1:02:40] interpretation and has some spooky
[1:02:42] spirit India will come and whisper
[1:02:44] something in the air
[1:02:46] the confirmed TL vision of what the time
[1:02:48] is using named imaginable so that way I
[1:02:54] get false interpretation false
[1:02:56] manifestations false prophecy and false
[1:02:59] revelation to interpret what God is have
[1:03:03] a time appointed to interpret he said
[1:03:06] when the press come down watch it will
[1:03:08] pull them who a goddamn and manifest and
[1:03:10] to people and to the partner he said
[1:03:13] power is a character oh god I just
[1:03:15] showed power like crazy
[1:03:17] tell everybody to vindicate some guy
[1:03:21] revelation Lakia the power God moving
[1:03:24] them yeah yeah character where's the
[1:03:26] evidence every test he lost his wife he
[1:03:30] lost his health he's got an accident
[1:03:32] he almost died what he has he gone to
[1:03:35] has he gone to a place of trying all
[1:03:37] these are things have to be designed
[1:03:40] because character is not a gift
[1:03:43] I'm I'm preaching as a gift gifts I'm
[1:03:46] calling is without repentance
[1:03:48] I might get have a gift a minister and
[1:03:50] preach a weapon and have no character
[1:03:52] whatsoever so God is not vindicating
[1:03:55] gifts
[1:03:55] that's why I'd option is the right
[1:03:58] cleaner son not the right kind of sermon
[1:04:01] but the right and a son so you could
[1:04:04] preach your own sermon by delight that
[1:04:06] you live and become adopted because :
[1:04:10] adopting the sermon or the message he
[1:04:12] had adopted a son right kindness son or
[1:04:16] give the lot some praises or glory to
[1:04:19] God hallelujah see on your wing so he
[1:04:23] said no watch no matter how much people
[1:04:25] said God give us the land
[1:04:26] let's go and take it they might have
[1:04:28] said just really love the Commission
[1:04:29] you're washed up why not do it something
[1:04:31] he said thus says the Lord in a moment
[1:04:34] and that was the will of God but this
[1:04:35] wise God sent prophets knew the promise
[1:04:38] of God but also new to wait for that
[1:04:43] it's not only to test to know the
[1:04:45] promise you know but - no - wait he said
[1:04:48] wait till them seven thunders to the
[1:04:49] voices to that group what they will do
[1:04:51] if a man come and say well is here now
[1:04:53] it oughta forces and bring this
[1:04:55] revelation a revolution but I know what
[1:04:57] is he
[1:04:57] it was slice em cut it s they could
[1:05:00] bring more revelations before he said
[1:05:01] speaking things that is your
[1:05:03] interpretation when the blast the
[1:05:06] mountain Bora Burnham said those
[1:05:09] brothers are wrong and heard the blasts
[1:05:10] but hear a voice
[1:05:14] did you get that the bread room with
[1:05:17] brother branham hood the mountain
[1:05:18] blossom treat and past but he heard a
[1:05:21] voice judgment striking west coast there
[1:05:26] Mooney was a noise but he had a voice
[1:05:29] Alaska almost sunk Oh hallelujah
[1:05:33] praise God I went Jesus a device
[1:05:36] thundered but he was God speaking it
[1:05:40] handed whenever God speak at unders Oh
[1:05:42] glory that God but he was speaking to
[1:05:44] his son God going to speak to you see
[1:05:48] when the time come God give it a Joshua
[1:05:51] who has stayed with him by the word for
[1:05:54] he could trust others he could not trust
[1:05:56] him it will repeat so he could trust
[1:05:59] Joshua Carter some other guys oh my
[1:06:02] hallelujah
[1:06:04] so God where does he turn out and God
[1:06:06] being infinite kind of speak one ting
[1:06:08] and change it to something else to make
[1:06:10] a better decision because every decision
[1:06:12] God make is perfect
[1:06:14] once his word is spoken it can never die
[1:06:16] it must live on so when God purpose to
[1:06:20] call you in for he call he can change
[1:06:22] back that : you can run you can hide you
[1:06:25] can duck he can change the calling upon
[1:06:27] your life you have to be called because
[1:06:30] all he foreknew he called you have to
[1:06:32] new you know you before in order to call
[1:06:35] you and we call you justified you have
[1:06:37] to just define you you have to clean up
[1:06:39] your act you have to clean up your
[1:06:41] record and your history that's what he
[1:06:43] does we call it justified we justify it
[1:06:46] done passed already
[1:06:47] he already glorified so you in a project
[1:06:50] now to go to your process knowing you're
[1:06:53] justified knowing your glory side you're
[1:06:55] in between here the devil is a big liar
[1:06:57] tonight you can't give up you can't let
[1:07:00] go your turn back sight
[1:07:02] did not put and let will not know you're
[1:07:03] too late devil this thing is sealed

[1:07:07] word I'm waiting to be sealed by the
[1:07:10] spirit okay the Lord a shout

[1:07:36] oh God thank you Lord and kill order so
[1:07:43] therefore his decision might be perfect
[1:07:44] once he says something it has to go all
[1:07:46] with a judgment if the church has the
[1:07:48] voice of God and you must get as part of
[1:07:50] the church but there are so much
[1:07:51] difference only doctrines so - my
[1:07:53] opinion the voice of God is the judge so
[1:07:56] the voice of God is so perfect it's got
[1:07:59] to come from a perfect resource nassau
[1:08:01] baram look let me say it kind of feel
[1:08:03] because it is god
[1:08:05] it can feel these prophets knew it it

[1:08:12] in the inspiration who only men move by

[1:13:03] seven seals Oh give the Lord some
[1:13:05] previous people our lawyer seven seas
[1:13:07] ready with him seven seas on the outside
[1:13:10] hallelujah praise God or glory of God
[1:13:14] but what was on the outside came from me
[1:13:15] insane or Korena got a closed book a
[1:13:18] sealed book no man wait and look on it
[1:13:20] but no that book is open and the
[1:13:23] brightest challenge to go to the angel
[1:13:25] and say give me that book oh that book I
[1:13:28] want that book you have to see your name
[1:13:31] in that book your authorities in that
[1:13:33] book your blessing in that book Oh glory
[1:13:36] to God amen so therefore the sea can
[1:13:40] only be reproduced by its original
[1:13:42] Breeden life can only reproduce by its
[1:13:48] original Breeden if it's the hybrid it
[1:13:51] cara produces itself all glory to God
[1:13:54] but the hybrid brings a super crop a
[1:13:57] bumper crop that's why they have super
[1:14:00] corn and super tomato and super nice and
[1:14:03] super that hybrid stuff is not right
[1:14:06] when a crop of falsehood depth I read a
[1:14:09] corner bring forth a big crop a better
[1:14:11] crop better-looking but it is dead
[1:14:13] planted back and carry but reduce itself
[1:14:16] if produce a hybrid crop and Jesus said
[1:14:19] except a man be born again he cannot see
[1:14:21] the kingdom didn't hook on a man
[1:14:23] be born again when his old can he
[1:14:25] entered in the second time in his
[1:14:27] mother's womb and be born he say except
[1:14:29] a man be born of water and spirit he can
[1:14:31] enter the kingdom this is the bottom is
[1:14:33] that a seed every spoken word I've got
[1:14:37] is a seed that's right I'm gonna prove
[1:14:38] it in a minute Jesus said every spoken
[1:14:40] word of God is a seed every spoken word
[1:14:44] of God is a seed so when you hear the
[1:14:48] spoken word you are getting and Jesus
[1:14:53] first parable was a kingdom of God was a
[1:14:55] man who went and so and chose seed and
[1:14:59] some fell on the wayside some fell among
[1:15:02] rocks some fell among bones
[1:15:05] some fellow good wrong Oh glory to God
[1:15:09] the west side of birds come and take it
[1:15:11] away
[1:15:11] hallelujah they hear it and just blow
[1:15:14] away the rocks it's spring of our giant
[1:15:17] chocolate fish service and disappear
[1:15:19] after a while hallelujah fell among
[1:15:22] thorns plunger rock around them and chop
[1:15:24] them they bring no fruit to perfection
[1:15:27] what some fell on good ground nothing
[1:15:30] wrong with the seed check the ground the
[1:15:34] seed is the word the seed is his seed
[1:15:37] and have to bring for his time if it's
[1:15:40] fall in the right ground or give the
[1:15:42] Lord some praises right wrong is the
[1:15:44] right atmosphere have to have an
[1:15:46] atmosphere but I see the trouble inside
[1:15:49] or chlorine apart
[1:15:51] I wanted found a good round in port for
[1:15:54] some 60 for some hunter fall but I'm
[1:15:57] gonna bring fort or glory of God
[1:15:59] Alleluia is not the quick jump and up
[1:16:02] and down noise who's grounded who is in
[1:16:06] the atmosphere whose and controls that
[1:16:10] that's he could grow and prosper because
[1:16:12] he bringing forth fruit Oh glory to God
[1:16:16] my mom says oh my hallelujah praise God
[1:16:21] praise God please good thank you Jesus
[1:16:24] so if we transform it to be changed its
[1:16:28] to be mean different from what it was
[1:16:30] it's correct and everything has to be
[1:16:33] changed it was a lying mire with a
[1:16:35] smoker with a drinker god transform yo
[1:16:37] you can't be smoking drinking again it's
[1:16:40] a change you being change them until you
[1:16:45] have to keep changing one day your body
[1:16:48] itself could be changed
[1:16:49] it's a big changer not just an inside
[1:16:53] change afterwards your your body can
[1:16:55] handle what on the inside it's rapture
[1:16:58] Peroni inside and when the sleeping
[1:17:00] since appear for 30 40 years that could
[1:17:03] be a jamming on your body again because
[1:17:05] your faith will be super anointed when

[1:19:59] everything is perfect he commanded each
[1:20:01] one of those seeds watch that they would
[1:20:04] transform themselves into the plant of
[1:20:07] which kind of life that the word spoken
[1:20:08] should be it was an oak tree it become
[1:20:11] an oak it was a palm it was a bring
[1:20:13] forth a pound because the great creator
[1:20:16] has just sent his word and the word seed
[1:20:19] was deer before the real seat was formed
[1:20:22] so when God said let there be a oak tree
[1:20:25] that was the word
[1:20:27] bo clea form yet but from that word for
[1:20:31] man real walk okey so when he said let
[1:20:34] there be a bride and trinidad there's a
[1:20:37] word but then that would go on punku and
[1:20:41] i knew i have you had a real seed of
[1:20:43] that would do you understand that let
[1:20:46] her be a super church that's how word
[1:20:48] seeded but that had to be manifested
[1:20:51] every seed will bring forth and the
[1:20:54] power is here the chance from his seed
[1:20:57] the preferred is cream his pain the kind
[1:21:01] of God loves many many many or glory of
[1:21:07] God don't change the nature bring forth
[1:21:11] this kind will be a pollutant in topple
[1:21:14] poetry if your palm tree everything
[1:21:16] after is kind oh my I remember to bring
[1:21:20] when we put the scene in the earth I'm
[1:21:22] almost done
[1:21:23] the sea can only come forth with the
[1:21:26] power of life within it to transform it
[1:21:30] from see the plant so when you put the
[1:21:33] seed in there is power in the seed if
[1:21:35] the sea could only talk the season took
[1:21:38] the desk
[1:21:39] if the secret only talk is he can put it
[1:21:41] on put it on I'm I don't pull it on I
[1:21:42] don't want to be on top the desk I don't
[1:21:44] want to be on top of stone put they in
[1:21:46] the grown what me down put me down stop
[1:21:50] time in your hand put me in the ground
[1:21:52] I'll perform if you put Manila well I'm
[1:21:55] gonna write I'm going to die
[1:21:58] I'm with the brick fort I'm going to
[1:22:00] break out and you're gonna see what's
[1:22:02] inside of me because it's a power inside
[1:22:05] of me it's a silent it is sealed it is
[1:22:09] colored until the coin the right grown
[1:22:11] or kill the Lord I shock if the sea can
[1:22:15] only talk tonight put me in that girl
[1:22:18] and I'm gonna come for you said if it
[1:22:21] steered in the right category it would
[1:22:23] be just exactly what God said it would
[1:22:25] be because he had made it at me and me
[1:22:27] the channel
[1:22:28] but anything that stays in that channel
[1:22:29] in the line of his world would have to
[1:22:31] bring for exactly as its kind oh my my
[1:22:35] mind and he went on and talked about of
[1:22:37] seats and the spring spring with deform
[1:22:40] policy deform sons Shh
[1:22:42] but Jesus had a repellent or Chloe that
[1:22:45] God we have something that she was a
[1:22:47] thing called guru mousse when it was on

[1:22:59] etching and then my schedule atmosphere
[1:23:05] that is a repellent that you use him
[1:23:07] like a set as a bear repellent for
[1:23:10] mosquito repellent for sin and Satan

[1:23:16] Holy Ghost a repellent notice go to a
[1:23:19] seat of this wood and there's only one
[1:23:21] thing I could quick in the world one

[1:23:25] a life-giver to the word and when the
[1:23:27] life in the word miss the life of the
[1:23:30] Spirit it produces whatever the seed is
[1:23:32] when the life of the world so the word
[1:23:35] is having my life so it's not as a dead
[1:23:37] dead dead dead you know there's a word
[1:23:39] seed Peter was custody a son denying
[1:23:41] Christ but the other seasons out of him
[1:23:42] not like the Saturday and the spirit
