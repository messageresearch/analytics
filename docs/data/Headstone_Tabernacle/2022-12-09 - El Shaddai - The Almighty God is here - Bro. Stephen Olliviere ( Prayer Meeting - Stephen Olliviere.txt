the homes and the hearts of all those here tonight we ask it in a precious and wonderful name at Thanksgiving amen and amen praise God so Isaiah chapter 25 verse 4. and it says for thou has been a strength to the poor a strength to the needy in his distress our refuge From The Storm a shadow from the Heat when the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm against the war praise the name of the Lord and went across to Psalms chapter 72 Psalms 72 verses 12 and 13. it says for he shall deliver the needy when he cried the poor also and him that hath no helper he shall spare the poor and needy and shall save the souls of the needy amen praise God on the final scripture is Psalms chapter 36 9. forward thee is the function of life in thy light shall we see light praise the name of the Lord Lord may the Lord a blessing to the reading of his word tonight amen praise God so just for a few words before we pray amen so all of us here tonight as Christians are different stages in our journey this journey a journey of life and we go through this journey of Life daily every day some are born some go on sometimes we celebrate sometimes we grieve they are mountains to climb and they are valleys to go down into then there are times we walk on the Prairies or the plains and we just Coast a little bit in this journey of life we undergo a wide range of experiences oh my and sometimes they get tremendous at times amen so let's look at children of Israel coming out of Egypt and journeying towards the Promised Land when they came out well while they were in Egypt they cried from the whips of the taskmasters when they came out and crossed over the Red Sea and so on they danced and rejoiced when they saw pharaoh and his men drown in the Red Sea what a time of rejoicing it was for them they followed the pillar of fire in the wilderness but many of them perished in the very Wilderness as well due to their behavior and their attitude towards God a whole generation wiped out during that time oh the Journey of Life the ups and the Downs the ins and the outs the rise and they fall but threw it off the I am was always present can we see amen tonight Hallelujah and we're going to give them my title my title tonight is ill should I the almighty one is here El Shaddai the almighty one praise God and throughout their Journey no matter what in the ups and downs the I am was always present he never leaves us we leave him sometimes but he never leaves us he is the living Fountain ever present for his children I am not I was can we say Amen tonight Hallelujah is the same yesterday to the end forever glory to God Amen and as Christians we are not excluded or Exempted from the rigors of life we go through battles and fights ups and downs sometimes we get really low head down against the ground Maybe but the I am is still ever present can we give him a hand of praise tonight hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so our face might be to the ground but tonight we say Satan you could knock me down but you can't knock me out no no glory to God Amen because the I am is there Hallelujah I can get low but I will rise again can we see amen tonight why because I've got a source I've got a connection to the almighty Hallelujah can we say Amen Glory Glory Glory I have a father that when I get real low I can go to him and nurse some strength back or praise God hallelujah

maybe someone tonight is needy and Sam said thou oh Lord has been a strength to the needy a refuge from the storms of life Hallelujah and when things get hot like a fiery furnace he is a shadow from the heat can we give him praise tonight oh yes Lord yes Lord yes Lord glory to God Hallelujah he was there with the three Hebrew boys in the fire he was the fourth man in the fire the ayam is always with us the almighty God is always with us amen praise God cannot forget his people God cares about you tonight look at Hager in the wilderness Abraham had given her bread and water and sent her on her way in Genesis 21. but the water was finished and the place was heated and the child Ishmael was dehydrated and close to death she had hid him under a shrub and she lifted up her voice and wept oh how we go through trying times sometimes and when she lifted up her voice and her tears was was seen by God her tears would not in vain and the angel of God visited her and said fear not Hager for God

about Abraham Abraham received a promise of a son Isaac but Abram and Sarah were past the age of childbearing he was old he was far gone he was getting weak in body but not in faith Maybe Abraham was now walking with a stick and rocking from side to side now the promise seemed more unlikely then the older he get the more the promise seem unlikely Abraham couldn't look at his body now because his body was finished almost in that sense he couldn't look at Sarah's body now all he had was I remember God spoke to me many years ago and said I would have a son and I believe it I believe it I believe it praise God I don't know how I don't know when my body says no but something inside anchors my faith it's going to happen hallelujah hallelujah somebody say I believe it's going to happen tonight I believe it's going to happen tonight amen I believe it's gonna happen tonight Glory like Abraham and we have children of Abraham from the message the unconditional Covenant Abraham God speaking to Abraham I am El Shaddai the almighty God now yet you're all your strength is all gone Sarah's room is dead she's 90. she's a great great grandmother she's awfully old the people are laughing at you

doubt out the window because an unfair we cast it outside don't and we come in and Faith to believe tonight as we witness from the breast of it should I and when it gets darker and darker and God seems to linger and Linger on and it's and he seems to yet be further and further away from you that's when Abraham's feet got higher and higher Glory he rested on the word of the Living God no matter how unreasonable it seemed and there are times when things would seem unreasonable as if it's impossible and times will get darker and darker and God seems far away but may your faith get stronger tonight may your faith rise tonight get higher and higher praise God Amen because Abraham said all Abraham knew is that God said so because he couldn't look at himself he could look at him and he
