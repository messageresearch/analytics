[20:28] stirring sermon to my soul to see that
[20:32] after years of fighting as a team as a
[20:34] group conventions preaching fighting
[20:38] against false teachings false preaching
[20:41] false interpretation and
[20:43] Revelation there's a transitioning from
[20:45] the group thing to the
[20:48] individual and I don't think that has
[20:50] struck the message world
[20:52] yet you see people have been pointed to
[20:55] church as if church is God the word
[20:59] is
[21:00] God but people have been safe behind
[21:03] churches pastors fivefold Ministry so
[21:06] soall this man of God of the hour this
[21:08] man of the hour and so on but the truth
[21:10] is there'll be two in the bed that's the
[21:13] word now amen one taken one left it
[21:16] didn't say there'll be two groups so you
[21:19] want to be in the right group you know
[21:21] you want to be in Christ am you want to
[21:24] be in the token you want to be if

[25:42] n Oh
[25:47] [Music]
[25:50] Glory my my heart is s s in the hour
[25:55] sred and and yet I'm scared not scared
[25:58] in terms of frighten but scared in terms
[26:01] of how uh people are so comfortable in
[26:06] their
[26:07] scenario that what B says if love don't
[26:09] get your desperate conditions will so I
[26:14] get to realize and I'm feeling now in my
[26:16] spirit that a a bunch of conditions is
[26:19] about to be loosed to get the people
[26:21] into a different mode into a desperate
[26:25] mode and I had a Thanksgiving Mir
[26:27] yesterday and I was read a strange
[26:29] scripture about Mary and
[26:32] Taxation and then when she bought her
[26:35] baby in swaddling cloth and so on but
[26:37] the emphasis I was bringing out is that
[26:39] pressure sometimes come to positionally
[26:41] place you where God want you to be up to
[26:45] Mary she never make it to to Bethlehem
[26:48] because she was Heavy with child but the
[26:50] pressure of Taxation having to go back
[26:53] into the City and so forth forc her to
[26:55] get there and because everybody was
[26:57] going there all the hotels were booked
[26:59] up so she came to the point where there
[27:02] was no
[27:03] room in the end and and today the hotels
[27:07] are booked up people minds and hearts
[27:10] are booked up booked up with
[27:11] interpretation booked up with idea
[27:13] booked up with your own feelings for you
[27:16] to go forward you have to shake off your
[27:17] own
[27:19] feelings you can't even go now with your
[27:23] feelings have to shake that off our weak
[27:27] I struggle and what you to shake all
[27:29] that off because weakness can't take it
[27:31] through struggling can't take you
[27:33] through that's why that's why the people
[27:36] Daniel said the people that know their
[27:37] God sh shall be strong and do great
[27:39] exploits God didn't cat off God didn't
[27:42] cater for weaky and struggling and no no
[27:45] that that was not he said even the third
[27:46] pull is for those that are struggling in
[27:48] faith those that can't must up the great
[27:50] fith God will give them words just to
[27:52] speak heal deliver free just just the
[27:57] word could you imagine you can't must up
[27:59] Faith they Brethren with faith they can
[28:00] frighten you with the faith and you
[28:02] don't have that kind of Faith he said
[28:03] that's what the third PA is about my God
[28:05] you just speaking Hallelujah I see my
[28:09] God devil get out that's all you can say
[28:12] hallelujah and the devil have to leave
[28:13] because God put the words in your mouth
[28:16] God put his thoughts in your heart Oh

[28:19] say all these things have stuff here but
[28:21] there is something moving upon me the
[28:23] holy man of God move by the holy when
[28:25] you moved by God when you moved by the
[28:27] spirit oh when the spirit of the Lord

[30:47] 1965 29th of April brother manam is in
[30:51] California Los Angeles he's saying this
[30:54] is a solemn warning we don't know what
[30:57] time
[30:58] you don't know what time that this city
[31:01] one day is going to be laying out in the
[31:03] bottom of this ocean oh capernum said
[31:05] Jesus thou who has exalted in heaven
[31:08] will be brought down into hell for if
[31:10] the mighty Works have been done in Sodom
[31:12] and Gomorrah it would have been standing
[31:13] to this day and Sodom Gomorrah lays in
[31:15] the bottom of the Dead Sea and Capernaum
[31:18] is in the bottom of the Dead Sea D City
[31:22] who claims to be the city of the Angels
[31:25] which is Los Angeles who have EX exalted
[31:28] yourself in the heaven and sent all the
[31:30] dirty filthy things of Fashions and
[31:32] things till even the foreign countries
[31:34] comeing to pick up our filth and send it
[31:36] away to your fine churches and steepers
[31:39] remember one day you'll be laying in the
[31:42] bottom of the sea your great Honeycombs
[31:45] under right now the wrath of God is
[31:47] belting under you how much longer will
[31:49] he hold this Sandbar hanging over that
[31:52] when that ocean out yonder a mile deep
[31:55] which sliding Plum back to the salt and
[31:58] see it will be worse than the last day
[32:01] of pompy repent Los Angeles repent the
[32:05] rest of you and turn to God the hour of
[32:08] his wrath is upon the Earth flee while
[32:11] there is time to flee coming to
[32:14] Christ so brother manam directly
[32:17] prophesied yes that those Angel is going
[32:19] to sink and that is the happened before
[32:22] the coming of the Lord amen and the
[32:25] bride will still be here yes sir to
[32:27] witness these things that are coming
[32:29] upon the Earth next prophecy you see
[32:32] back again in the shame this is in 1965
[32:35] this is in July of course he said
[32:39] there's a prophecy that the ocean shall
[32:42] weep its way into the desert now this
[32:44] Sultan SE is a part of a desert part of
[32:48] California this Sultan SE is a man-made
[32:51] mistake that that produce the sea and S
[32:53] what they call the salt and sea it's a
[32:54] man-made thing but he said of course the
[32:57] salt and sea is about 200 ft below CA
[32:59] level and if that big churning and earth
[33:01] swallowing it like that with hundreds of
[33:04] square miles he said hundreds and
[33:07] hundreds of square miles sinking in the
[33:09] earth it will throw a tidal wave Plum
[33:11] into Arizona it sure word Mrs Simpson I
[33:15] think she's with us today I see brother
[33:16] Fred she went and got a prophecy I made
[33:19] in 1935 the time would come it's written
[33:21] in a book where the sea would weep its
[33:23] way into the desert look what will take
[33:25] place if that thousands of square miles
[33:27] fall into the lav of the earth and slide
[33:29] there there will be million die at one
[33:32] time Millions die at one time that will
[33:37] cause such a tidal wave uh Plumb into
[33:40] the sult and sea 200 ft lower than the
[33:43] sea level that water will probably come
[33:44] up almost almost a
[33:47] Tucson the water will come Plum up to
[33:49] the salt and sea Los Angeles is doomed
[33:51] for judgment I tell you it before it
[33:54] happened just reading for message called
[33:57] live
[33:58] you know woman is on increase in the
[34:00] nation and it's about three to five
[34:02] children born three of them are girls
[34:04] and the women are getting bigger the men
[34:05] are getting smaller women are taking
[34:07] over of course that's just the trend of
[34:09] the prophecy that this nation is a woman
[34:11] Nation it will be run by a woman and
[34:13] remember 1933 I saw that coming a vision
[34:17] a great powerful woman that will take
[34:19] over the whole nation someday before the
[34:22] end time before the total
[34:25] Annihilation then he spoke about the car
[34:28] the car in that day will be shaped like
[34:30] an egg running back in this form and
[34:33] this is interesting how it is phrased
[34:36] here and it will be controlled by some
[34:38] kind of power that they won't even have
[34:40] to use the steering wheel at times so
[34:44] even now the autonomous car that they
[34:46] have they could put it in automatic and
[34:48] it will drive for itself you just
[34:50] sitting there you don't have to use the
[34:51] steering wheel but they even more have
[34:52] it right now they're getting more and
[34:54] more with technology and so on and woman
[34:56] will take over and the doctrine of the
[34:58] Catholic Church which always would take
[35:00] over the Catholic Church the United
[35:02] States is almost here right now worship
[35:05] of a woman Mary which is contrary to the
[35:06] Bible now you remember I predicted 933
[35:11] it will be way too I saw Vision before
[35:13] the end time a great powerful thing St
[35:15] up United States and become stubbles
[35:18] it's going to happen I said automobiles
[35:21] will be in the shape of an egg they'll
[35:23] be traveling on a road and they won't
[35:25] even have to guide it
[35:29] they can't hit against one another I've
[35:32] got a roote in 1933 I we know the cars
[35:36] now have all the sensors so it wouldn't
[35:37] bounce the next car and everything else
[35:39] it's already there it would break for
[35:40] itself and everything else we are at the
[35:42] end he said now when the woman being
[35:44] permitted to vote would help to elect
[35:47] the wrong person for this nation see
[35:49] what they have done oh praise God then
[35:54] the 10th version he said 1914 the world
[35:56] went to war d never been at peace since
[35:59] constantly swinging swinging swinging
[36:01] they're doing the very same thing what
[36:02] they're doing holding oh God have mercy
[36:05] holding that great thing that I saw in a
[36:08] vision when the whole thing become to
[36:10] destruction holding the atomic walls so
[36:14] it's
[36:15] coming every time man invent a weapon he
[36:17] has always used it be it gun be it
[36:20] slingshot be it bow and arrow whatever
[36:23] man made he used it amen they have
[36:26] Atomic they will use it has already been
[36:29] used and it will be used again isn't
[36:31] that right praise God do you believe
[36:34] that holding the wars that they don't
[36:36] destroy themselves until the thing come
[36:38] to destroy it until Israel returns back
[36:40] and get together then the message will
[36:42] go to Israel and she'll be sealed with
[36:44] the seed of the Holy Ghost the Gentiles
[36:46] is called out a people for his name's
[36:48] sakes and then Israel only receive a
[36:50] three and a half year month's
[36:54] message this is the news now this came

[52:51] praise God we like to turn to acts chap
[52:54] 1:8 we also want to read from from St
[52:57] John chapter 1 and we'll read from
[53:00] Romans 8 as
[53:02] well so you can find a marker for those
[53:04] but we's start with acts 18 praise
[53:08] God
[53:18] hallelujah amen
[53:23] amen Acts chapter 1 and verse 8
[53:29] and it says but ye shall receive power
[53:32] after that the Holy Ghost is come upon
[53:34] you and ye shall be Witnesses unto me
[53:37] both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and
[53:41] in Samaria and unto the uttermost part
[53:44] of the earth now turning over to St John
[53:47] 1 we want to read from verse 10 to
[53:53] 12 uh inclusively praise
[53:58] go so St John
[54:03] 1 see John
[54:06] 1:10 and it says he was in the world and
[54:09] the world was made by him and the world
[54:12] knew him not this is St John 1 verse 11
[54:17] now and he came unto his own and his own
[54:20] receive him not but as many as receive
[54:23] him to them gave he power
[54:26] to become the sons of God even to them
[54:30] that believe on his name and lastly you
[54:33] want to read from Romans 8 CH uh verse
[54:38] 11 praise
[54:41] God Romans
[54:43] [Music]
[54:46] 8 Romans 8 and: 11 says but if the
[54:50] spirit of him that raised up Jesus from
[54:52] the dead dwell in you he that raised up
[54:55] Christ from the dead shall also Quicken
[54:58] your mortal bodies by his spirit that
[55:01] dwelleth in you therefore brethren we
[55:04] are debtors not to the Flesh in other
[55:07] words we don't owe the flesh to live
[55:10] after the flesh for if you live after
[55:12] the flesh you shall die but if you live
[55:15] through the spirit do mortify the Deeds
[55:18] of this body then ye shall live in other
[55:20] words count the Deeds of this body as
[55:22] though it were dead yet ye shall live
[55:25] because we are debt does not to the
[55:26] flesh but to the spirit isn't that right
[55:29] verse 14 for as many as are led by the
[55:32] spirit of God they are the sons of God
[55:36] for ye have not received the spirit of
[55:39] bondage against fear but ye have
[55:42] received the spirit of adoption whereby
[55:44] we cry AB father the spirit itself

[58:24] said don't look to these things as your
[58:26] sign these things are supposed to happen
[58:29] these things are going to be there but
[58:31] that is not our sign our sign is to
[58:33] preach the gospel throughout all the
[58:35] Earth and then the end shall come what
[58:38] is the gospel the gospel is not in word
[58:41] only but that gospel is in power and in
[58:44] demonstration of the Holy Spirit
[58:46] Allelujah it's called taking the word
[58:48] and manifesting it himself bringing it
[58:51] to pass himself isn't that right all the
[58:54] time the word laying there as a seed but
[58:57] in this season an anointing is about to
[58:59] strike the word in the pride and let it
[59:02] begin to take on life then you begin to
[59:05] live those virtues then out to come fate
[59:08] out to come virtue out to come knowledge
[59:11] out to come Temperance patience
[59:13] godliness brotherly kindness it will be
[59:16] scripturally proven to be in your heart

[59:59] distress of Nations but that doesn't
[1:00:01] shake her the earthquake didn't shake
[1:00:04] the prophets the fire didn't shake the
[1:00:06] prophet the wind didn't shake the
[1:00:08] prophet but what attracted that Prophet
[1:00:11] Elijah was a still small voice speaking
[1:00:15] praise God hallelujah somebody say Amen

[1:00:58] a thousand fall on your left side and
[1:01:00] 10,000 on your right we know this
[1:01:03] morning that we shall not be moved
[1:01:06] because we are standing upon God's
[1:01:08] promised word and whatsoever he spoke it
[1:01:11] was done not one word of God has ever
[1:01:15] failed throughout the ages and he's not
[1:01:18] about to fail now come on little woman

[1:01:49] know what to make of Putin they're
[1:01:50] trying to figure out if he's clinically
[1:01:52] insane praise God as far as they concern
[1:01:55] his madman actions they can't track his
[1:01:58] actions one day he up one day he down
[1:01:59] he's just like bipolar praise God some
[1:02:02] say it's a tactic of War some says this
[1:02:05] some says that Hallelujah but it take
[1:02:07] one mad man to push the button and
[1:02:09] that'll be the end of it isn't that
[1:02:11] right it's already prophesied to be and
[1:02:13] the devil right now this morning is very
[1:02:15] scared about our next move he cannot
[1:02:19] predict what we are about to do next
[1:02:21] Hallelujah because as far as he
[1:02:23] concerned there's nothing special about
[1:02:25] us we look like ordinary people living
[1:02:28] ordinary lives Hallelujah PR isn't that
[1:02:31] right glory to God Samson was just like
[1:02:34] that he look like a little fell
[1:02:36] but when the power of God come upon
[1:02:39] Samson he could move Kats he could move
[1:02:42] pillars he could beat a thousand
[1:02:44] Philistines he could do anything he
[1:02:46] wanted to do he could do great exploits
[1:02:50] he could run through a troop Hallelujah
[1:02:52] and when the power of God strikes you in
[1:02:54] this hour yes yes you with all your
[1:02:57] complaining you with all your faults you
[1:02:59] feel like you can't make it when the

[1:03:32] with their part they couldn't fulfill
[1:03:34] all of it Hallelujah isn't the
[1:03:36] Pentecostal and so on and so on but

[1:04:12] mechanics we need the power to make this
[1:04:15] word live isn't that right H and just
[1:04:19] just as Jesus left his disciples with a
[1:04:22] promise of power he said t and wait in
[1:04:25] Jerusalem in the upper room until I you
[1:04:28] be endued with power from on high I am

[1:04:39] truth hallelujah and they waited in the
[1:04:41] upper room for something to come upon
[1:04:43] them isn't that right because they knew
[1:04:45] by Revelation what they were waiting to

[1:04:51] poised and ready she is waiting for her
[1:04:54] Dynamics she is for her life the prophet

[1:05:46] tonight to show you through here that we
[1:05:48] are see to receive a messenger that will
[1:05:52] take all those loose ends out there amen
[1:05:54] and reveal the the whole Secret Of God

[1:06:30] Divine Healing hardly he said we've got
[1:06:32] to have enough Faith to be changed in a
[1:06:35] moment and to be swept out of this Earth
[1:06:39] isn't that right Hallelujah the prophet
[1:06:42] said with his own words what you got
[1:06:44] right now you cannot make it in this
[1:06:47] condition there's got to be some Spirit
[1:06:50] some anointing to come upon the bride to
[1:06:54] commission her and anoint her for her
[1:06:57] time and for her season oh hallelujah
[1:07:01] hallelujah the spirit of adoption we
[1:07:03] have not received the spirit of bondage
[1:07:06] against a fear I am not afraid not in
[1:07:10] this hour that's not the spirit that was
[1:07:13] promised to me but what was promised to
[1:07:15] me was a spirit of adoption to lead the
[1:07:19] sons of God Into the Wilderness to be
[1:07:22] tested and to be tried and to be proven

[1:18:29] spirit all right let me read a quote
[1:18:32] here keep your M huming amen time
[1:18:34] mechanics okay in every age there had
[1:18:37] been some of it left off all right the
[1:18:39] reformer the messenger of that hour
[1:18:42] didn't have time to take care of it okay
[1:18:45] so in the days of Luther he only
[1:18:47] preached justification my faith then he
[1:18:50] was gone right then they made a church
[1:18:52] the prophet said but then after that
[1:18:54] Wesley
[1:18:55] he preached
[1:18:56] sanctification there it was and then
[1:18:58] Along Came the Pentecostal and so forth
[1:19:01] and keep repeating all right then he
[1:19:03] said but we're promised according to
[1:19:05] Revelation 10 and according to Malachi 4
[1:19:09] and St Luke 22:17 and so forth all the
[1:19:11] scriptures that there's got to come an
[1:19:14] Ephesians to this there is promis it
[1:19:17] friends there must come an Ephesians
[1:19:20] that these Sevenfold Mysteries of the
[1:19:22] word of God must be unfold it and it's
[1:19:26] in the loudest age that this takes place
[1:19:29] and I believe that we we're there and I
[1:19:32] believe we're right in the shadows of
[1:19:33] the coming of the Son of God am and as
[1:19:36] Joshua just before the Ephesians raised
[1:19:39] up amen so the John the bapt Baptist
[1:19:42] raised up just before the next Ephesians
[1:19:45] he said and where promis another
[1:19:47] Ephesians it's predicted here in the
[1:19:50] scripture he said so therefore I think
[1:19:54] that we living in the Ephesians age
[1:19:57] again he says it by faith as present
[1:19:59] tense he said we are living in the
[1:20:03] Ephesians
[1:20:05] [Music]
[1:20:07] again and before you said it going to
[1:20:09] happen right in this leian age so what
[1:20:12] happens while the world is getting
[1:20:14] darker while the world is going more and
[1:20:16] more into the lisian spirit while second
[1:20:19] Timothy 3 is running through the
[1:20:21] churches and cutting out the
[1:20:23] uncircumcised the BR
[1:20:25] is being honed and shaped and sealed
[1:20:29] into an age of Promise which is another
[1:20:32] Ephesians which is the bride Age The
[1:20:35] Eternal Church
[1:20:37] age oh hallelujah hallelujah so while
[1:20:42] the world is getting darker we are
[1:20:43] getting more light and more light the
[1:20:46] prophet said if God reveal it try it see
[1:20:49] if it's right and he said if it's right
[1:20:51] send more of it and he said just keep
[1:20:53] moving just keep moving don't stop don't
[1:20:56] stop to build tents don't stop to build
[1:20:58] churches don't stop to build

[1:34:55] H
[1:34:57] GL GL Hallelujah you be you have to be
[1:35:01] concerned about what God promised to you
[1:35:04] Caleb was very concerned about it
[1:35:06] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah it's on
[1:35:08] his heart it was on his mind was on his
[1:35:11] system Hallelujah every day he wake up
[1:35:14] every night he go to bed he thinking
[1:35:15] about it it had people who saw miracles
[1:35:18] in the wilderness it that people who saw
[1:35:20] signs it are people who saw wonders and
[1:35:22] it didn't make it out they didn't make
[1:35:24] it in rather to that Ephesians land of
[1:35:26] promise but Caleb said now therefore
[1:35:29] give me my Mountain I want what God
[1:35:33] promised to
[1:35:35] [Applause]
[1:35:36] me so just because you see big signs and
[1:35:40] wonders doesn't mean or guaranteed your
[1:35:43] success in this Ephesians it had plenty
[1:35:46] people who see cancers fall off and tum
[1:35:48] must fall off in the prophet day where
[1:35:51] are they now where is the Fate because
[1:35:54] the word was not mixed with fate they
[1:35:56] couldn't go in but Caleb said I'm not
[1:35:59] counting on those other guys those are
[1:36:01] my brethren I love them but they didn't
[1:36:03] have enough Faith to reach up and grab a
[1:36:05] hold of their promise but I Hallelujah
[1:36:08] I'm not pegging on their testimony I
[1:36:10] cannot depend on anybody else's
[1:36:12] testimony I got to have my own testimony
[1:36:17] I want my portion that's how you got to
[1:36:20] beat in this hour you got to want your
[1:36:22] portion
[1:36:23] [Applause]
[1:36:32] it's the
[1:36:33] attitude that brings the
[1:36:36] results the right mental attitude
[1:36:40] towards any Divine promise of God the
[1:36:43] prophet said will bring it to pass and
[1:36:46] the prophet said if you meet those same
[1:36:48] conditions he said if the same
[1:36:50] conditions are met then God is obligated
[1:36:53] to to do the same thing he did when the
[1:36:57] conditions were met so if Cornelius was
[1:36:59] devout if Cornelius was prayed up if
[1:37:02] Cornelius was Sanctified waiting on the
[1:37:04] Lord Jesus if he was in that condition
[1:37:07] and he received the Holy Ghost that ESS
[1:37:10] is on you this morning to be prayed up
[1:37:13] to be Sanctified to be waiting on the

[1:47:25] hallelujah amen he said we're looking
[1:47:27] forward to it he said you know Mary and

[1:47:34] went up to Jerusalem at the feast and on
[1:47:36] they road back they missed Jesus among
[1:47:38] them so they sought him among their
[1:47:40] other among their people but he wasn't
[1:47:43] found he said and I think that's a whole
[1:47:45] lot today and they went trying to find
[1:47:47] where he was at he said do you know
[1:47:49] where they found him right where they
[1:47:51] left him that's right
[1:47:53] well that's where we'll find him Prophet
[1:47:55] said that's where the church will find
[1:47:58] him we won't find him in lectures come
[1:48:00] on now we won't find them in
[1:48:02] entertainers we won't find them in the
[1:48:04] way we
[1:48:05] dress that's a big one some people
[1:48:08] believe they long skirt will take them
[1:48:09] to Heaven Hallelujah Hall that's right
[1:48:11] he won't find a way we dress or the
[1:48:13] denomination we belong to comfortable in
[1:48:16] the churches and so on he said but we go
[1:48:17] back to the day of Pentecost where he
[1:48:20] came into the church amen and there is
[1:48:24] where we'll find him because that's
[1:48:27] where the early church left him at the
[1:48:30] ner counil and there is where he's been
[1:48:32] left ever since so it's we have to go
[1:48:35] back to that time to get him in other
[1:48:38] words go back to the original Hallelujah
[1:48:41] Landmark amen that was set by the first
[1:48:43] Fathers Hallelujah the the fathers at

[1:49:25] every one blade of grass asking for
[1:49:28] their reain in their time and in their
[1:49:31] season and if you recognize your day and

[1:50:31] now this messenger Malachi 4 Revelation
[1:50:34] 10:7 has got to do two things one
[1:50:37] according to Malachi 4 he will turn the
[1:50:40] hearts of the children to the fathers
[1:50:43] Hallelujah isn't that right in other
[1:50:45] words we have to go back and pick up
[1:50:46] what they had at Pentecost the original
[1:50:50] dollar the original Holy Ghost the
[1:50:52] genuine anointing isn't that right upon
[1:50:55] the holy ghost back in the church the
[1:50:57] Bible said holy men spake as they will
[1:51:00] move by the Holy Ghost so we have seen
[1:51:02] the ministry of man all these years but
[1:51:05] sir this is a time where we would see
[1:51:08] Jesus we are looking for Jesus back in
[1:51:11] the church again to bring back some
[1:51:14] Apostles and some prophets some teachers
[1:51:16] Jesus was stepping the church hallelujah
[1:51:19] hallelujah isn't that right and live
[1:51:21] these things out that's what we're
[1:51:23] looking for am if we don't have that
[1:51:25] then where are we going what are we
[1:51:30] doing isn't that right two he will
[1:51:33] reveal the mysteries of the 700s in
[1:51:35] Revelation 10 which are the revelations
[1:51:37] contained in the Seven Seals and he said
[1:51:40] it will be these divinely revealed
[1:51:43] mystery truths that literally turn the
[1:51:46] hearts of the children back to the
[1:51:48] Pentecostal fathers the prophet said
[1:51:50] exactly so amen okay back this quote he
[1:51:53] said now these Greeks were not looking
[1:51:54] for a lecturer certain Greeks came and
[1:51:57] came and asked for Jesus isn't that
[1:51:58] right in the scripture the prophet is
[1:52:00] bringing it out he said they didn't look
[1:52:01] for a lecturer on Jesus Christ no they
[1:52:04] wasn't looking for a Pulpit clown he as
[1:52:06] he said a moments ago they're not
[1:52:07] looking for that he said they're not
[1:52:08] looking for entertainers and what do we
[1:52:10] come for this morning we didn't come for
[1:52:12] entertainment we didn't come to put up
[1:52:13] our foot this is not a Jehovah Witness
[1:52:15] Hall we didn't come to lecture to you we
[1:52:18] didn't come to give you information
[1:52:20] about what Hallelujah what's going to
[1:52:21] take place and all this no no no no no
[1:52:23] we come for the Holy Ghost that's what
[1:52:25] we come for we come for a refilling of
[1:52:28] what they had back there in the upper
[1:52:30] room the anointing to come upon the word
[1:52:32] in US Dynamics or mechanics that's what
[1:52:35] we come here for we didn't come to sit
[1:52:38] and stare we didn't come to take up
[1:52:40] space no no no no but we believe the
[1:52:42] Holy Ghost is just as real just as real
[1:52:46] just as real oh healing is just as real
[1:52:50] Deliverance is just as real salvation is
[1:52:52] just as real the power is just as real
[1:52:55] as it was on the day of Pentecost the
[1:52:57] blood is just as real the anointing is
[1:53:00] just as real that angel that was with
[1:53:02] the prophet will be here one more time
[1:53:05] he said I'll ride this Trail one
[1:53:09] [Applause]
[1:53:11] more Hallelujah and the world will hear
[1:53:14] direct from
[1:53:15] God Amen oh Hallelujah give him a shout
[1:53:19] of praise hallah
[1:53:21] [Applause]
[1:53:27] H amen amen you love him okay hallelujah
[1:53:31] amen amen amen so let me try to strike
[1:53:34] my text here after this and that's it
[1:53:36] all right he said they're not looking
[1:53:37] for entertainers he said they want to
[1:53:39] see him the person Jesus Christ he said
[1:53:42] they long to see him oh do you long to
[1:53:45] see him this morning in the church oh to
[1:53:49] him to see him set in the church oh some
[1:53:52] groaning some looking for the Holy Ghost
[1:53:54] laboring under the labor pains graning
[1:53:57] to be placed to be positionally born
[1:54:00] into the kingdom of God oh H to put a
[1:54:03] mark upon those that sigh and upon those
[1:54:05] that cry for the Abomination that being
[1:54:08] done in the city all the sexual lust and
[1:54:11] demons that have polluted the Earth but
[1:54:14] God is getting ready to redeem the Earth
[1:54:16] by fire and he does the same thing to
[1:54:19] the individual you are going to redeem
[1:54:22] by
[1:54:24] fire oh fire got to come and burn the
[1:54:29] snake out of your heart burn the lust
[1:54:31] out of your heart burn the demons out of
[1:54:33] your heart out of your life and then God
[1:54:36] takes up his residence in there then it
[1:54:39] is no more I that liveth but Christ that
[1:54:41] liveth in me that's what I anthonio
[1:54:44] brand I'm looking for in this hour I
[1:54:46] will not rest until the Holy Ghost is in
[1:54:49] my
[1:54:50] soul H I'm looking for it
[1:54:52] I'm under expectation for it you have to
[1:54:55] be under expectation for your promised
[1:54:57] Dynamics and if love don't get us
[1:55:00] desperate conditions
[1:55:03] Will You Bet Your Life on
[1:55:07] it oh
[1:55:11] man Hallelujah my God amen
[1:55:20] amen okay
[1:55:24] amen
[1:55:26] amen uh oh do you love him this morning
[1:55:29] amen amen okay now he said uh they long
[1:55:33] to see him because they had heard of him
[1:55:35] and Faith cometh by hearing the word or
[1:55:38] aren't you glad you heard the word all
[1:55:39] these years he said and he is the word
[1:55:41] see he is the word and they wanted to
[1:55:43] see Jesus they long to see Jesus and we
[1:55:47] long to see Jesus Jesus said the world
[1:55:49] see me no more but you are going to see
[1:55:51] me that's a promise laying in the
[1:55:54] scripture hallah he will appear once
[1:55:56] more in his pride in the voice of the
[1:55:58] Archangel isn't that right he said they
[1:55:59] wanted to see him oh they never wanted
[1:56:01] to hear him they had already heard but
[1:56:04] they wanted to see that wasn't the
[1:56:06] question we want like to hear Jesus s he
[1:56:08] said no we want to see Jesus oh that's
[1:56:12] beautiful he said that's their purpose
[1:56:14] of inquiring it was to see him not to
[1:56:16] have him explain today with great
[1:56:19] intellectual messages he said we could
[1:56:22] explain it until you could see the
[1:56:23] picture but he said that isn't what
[1:56:25] we're looking for tonight he said we're
[1:56:27] looking for the mechanics he said we're
[1:56:30] looking for the Dynamics of it he said
[1:56:32] that's it he said so many say that's it
[1:56:35] we've got the mechanics of religions in
[1:56:37] the Bible so bottled up say until it
[1:56:40] looks like a great big 1635 coach train
[1:56:43] sitting out there on a track he said but
[1:56:45] if you haven't got any steam in it then
[1:56:48] he said it doesn't make sense it dicks
[1:56:50] the Dynamics to per form the mechanics
[1:56:54] and what we need now is to see that this
[1:56:57] that we've been taught all these years
[1:56:59] is it the truth or not it's been
[1:57:01] explained over and over and over to the
[1:57:03] churches and so forth but we are looking
[1:57:05] to see who this person is this person of
[1:57:09] the Holy Ghost this person of Dynamics
[1:57:11] he is a literal
[1:57:13] person the person of Jesus Christ isn't
[1:57:17] that right and he has characteristics he
[1:57:20] has a likeness he has a manner elect
[1:57:23] doesn't persecute elect Hallelujah no no
[1:57:25] no no the spirit of Christ believe it
[1:57:28] all things hope it all things endure all
[1:57:31] things you know when somebody has got
[1:57:34] the Holy Ghost you know when somebody
[1:57:35] has a genuine experience they begin to
[1:57:38] live a life that is worthy of the gospel
[1:57:41] and that's what we need in this church
[1:57:43] that's what we need in this world that's
[1:57:45] what we need on this island genuine Holy
[1:57:48] Ghost Believers that have the power to
[1:57:50] live something and this morning we are
[1:57:53] looking for Dynamics to strike our
[1:57:55] mechanics so that we could live
[1:57:57] something in this
[1:57:59] [Applause]
[1:58:04] scripture oh my said takes the Dynamics
[1:58:07] of perform the mechanics amen okay amen
[1:58:11] isn't that right Bible said he came unto
[1:58:13] his own his own receive him not but as
[1:58:15] many has receive him to them give he
[1:58:17] power to become the sons of God in other
[1:58:21] words a trans home and power come upon
[1:58:23] the seed that is in your soul to turn it
[1:58:26] into what it's supposed to be isn't that
[1:58:29] right L had mechanics and Dynamics they
[1:58:31] became the fullness of justification for
[1:58:33] their day Wesley sanctification and
[1:58:35] sword isn't that right so if we have
[1:58:37] received a seed of perfection then when
[1:58:39] that anointing comes what will it
[1:58:41] produce it has to produce a perfect
[1:58:44] Pride it cannot produce everything else
[1:58:47] it's got to produce whatever the seed is
[1:58:50] because the law in the SE seed is to
[1:58:53] bring forth whatever life is in that
[1:58:55] seed and we have not received conly
[1:58:57] Divine fables we have not preached to
[1:59:00] you men's ideas not men's thoughts but
[1:59:03] we have stayed on that word of God in
[1:59:06] season out of season the pure
[1:59:09] unadulterated word of God and when that
[1:59:12] word is mixed with faith and the
[1:59:14] anointing strikes that word it's going
[1:59:16] to bring to pass another Ephesians
[1:59:19] because another Ephesians is promised oh
[1:59:22] give God a shout of
[1:59:25] Praise hallelujah oh
[1:59:29] my oh my Hallelujah my brother Raymond
[1:59:33] from overseas from England sent me this
[1:59:35] quote here he said a gospel is not in
[1:59:38] word only but in power and manifestation
[1:59:40] of the Holy Ghost he said in other words
[1:59:43] it's the Holy Ghost taking the word of
[1:59:45] God and making it manifest see and
[1:59:49] otherwise he said the only way that the
[1:59:51] signs of of St Mark 16 can follow the
[1:59:54] believer is that the Holy Spirit himself
[1:59:57] has got to take the word of God and
[2:00:00] demonstrated it to the
[2:00:02] people oh not handing out a track about
[2:00:05] it not handing out a quote about it but
[2:00:08] this is that that was spoken of the
[2:00:10] prophet in those days I pour my spirit
[2:00:13] look it
[2:00:17] here in other words it have to come back
[2:00:20] to the Token on display
[2:00:22] God have to be manifested with you
[2:00:25] identified with you this is my son and I
[2:00:29] love him and I am manifesting myself in
[2:00:32] him present
[2:00:35] tense oh H isn't that right like a
[2:00:38] little while ago we was talking about
[2:00:40] that py tree isn't that right and my
[2:00:42] wife asked me the question what does a
[2:00:44] py tree look like and I said I don't
[2:00:46] know it looks like any other tree it
[2:00:48] look like a normal tree you would
[2:00:50] mistake it for another tree in the
[2:00:51] forest but let that tree begin to come
[2:00:54] into its season let that tree begin to
[2:00:57] come into its time then all the leaves
[2:00:59] begin to fall off then all the blossoms
[2:01:01] begin to come out then that tree begin
[2:01:03] to look a little different then that
[2:01:05] tree begin to stand out amidst the crowd
[2:01:08] amidst everybody else and you could see
[2:01:10] a poy Tree on a hill look another one
[2:01:13] there look another one there it's
[2:01:15] different from the others that's how the
[2:01:17] sons of God are going to be in this last
[2:01:20] day they are going to to be very
[2:01:22] different from the world look one here
[2:01:26] look one there look one there there's my
[2:01:29] spirit flowing
[2:01:34] freely glory amen hallelujah okay amen
[2:01:40] said the gospel not one only all right
[2:01:42] he said now holy spirit takes the word
[2:01:44] of God and demonstrated to the people
[2:01:46] that's it he said now Faith makes that
[2:01:49] word live see the word of God
[2:01:52] in the beginning was a word and the Word
[2:01:54] was with God and the Word was God uh he
[2:01:58] said and then Jesus said if you abide in
[2:02:00] me and my word in you ask what you will
[2:02:03] and it shall be done for you see that's
[2:02:05] staying with Christ in the word he said
[2:02:08] don't go right or left he said stay
[2:02:10] right with it see and then it's actually
[2:02:13] not your word he said but then it's his
[2:02:16] word and his word has the power and the
[2:02:20] authority behind it oh hallelujah
[2:02:24] hallelujah hallelujah so when you take
[2:02:26] his word you are taking his power and
[2:02:29] his authority behind his own word
[2:02:31] hallelujah isn't that all the power
[2:02:32] Hallelujah is laying in this word here
[2:02:34] Hal when so when you claim a scripture
[2:02:36] Hallelujah he Health the heal I am the
[2:02:38] one that Health all thy diseases when
[2:02:40] you take that and you begin to anoint it
[2:02:42] to yourself watch the devil run from you
[2:02:46] watch that sickness run from you watch
[2:02:48] that disease run from you why because he
[2:02:50] was anointing the word promis to himself
[2:02:53] Abraham couldn't rely on his feelings
[2:02:55] Abraham couldn't rely on his Sensations
[2:02:58] Abraham had back trouble Abraham I'm
[2:03:00] arthritis but Abraham keep saying I'm
[2:03:03] going to have a son I'm going to have
[2:03:06] Isaac he keep anointing the promise to
[2:03:08] himself Hallelujah isn't that right job
[2:03:11] said though the skin worms destroy his
[2:03:13] part but yet in my flesh I shall seek
[2:03:17] God and even though Joseph was rejected
[2:03:20] until his word came the word of the Lord
[2:03:22] Tried Him tried him he knew what the
[2:03:25] dream meant but he had to wait until God
[2:03:29] fulfill his own promise and the bride
[2:03:32] has got to wait until those seven
[2:03:34] Thunders utter their voices to that
[2:03:37] group who could take the word who could
[2:03:40] really take that word and hand it there
[2:03:43] it'll slice and it'll cut because she'll
[2:03:46] have the mind of Christ to know what to
[2:03:48] do with his
[2:03:50] word oh give him a shout of
[2:03:54] [Applause]
[2:03:58] Praise oh Hallelujah I don't mean to
[2:04:00] keep here just about two more minutes
[2:04:02] and I'm finished amen amen
[2:04:05] okay hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[2:04:08] isn't that right all right he said now
[2:04:11] God's provided a place of worship the
[2:04:12] prophet said I think that's what the
[2:04:13] matter with the church today he said
[2:04:14] we're lacking that dynamical power to
[2:04:17] press this word and make it live for
[2:04:20] this day m Mar Luther had the mechanics
[2:04:22] and dynamics of this his day John Wesley
[2:04:25] had them of his day Pentecostal had them
[2:04:27] with their day he said but what about
[2:04:29] our day he said this is another time he
[2:04:33] said the church should be fully grown
[2:04:35] now ready to meet Christ with a
[2:04:38] manifestation of every blessing that he
[2:04:41] promised in the Bible operating by that
[2:04:44] one great body where he promised he
[2:04:47] would meet the people and be worshiped
[2:04:50] in this great church of his in other
[2:04:53] words there's coming a time he told the
[2:04:54] woman at the well there's coming a time
[2:04:57] he said you don't know what you worship
[2:04:59] we know what we worship he said but the
[2:05:01] hour is coming when the Hallelujah when
[2:05:04] you Hallelujah will not worship not only
[2:05:06] at this Temple and so on he said but
[2:05:07] spirit and truth hallelujah de real
[2:05:10] worshippers are going to step out of the
[2:05:12] pages of this Bible and worship the
[2:05:15] father in spirit and in truth you will
[2:05:18] not only have truth but the spirit will
[2:05:20] be there bearing witness with the truth
[2:05:24] that you have stood for all these years
[2:05:26] the Dynamics to your mechanics the
[2:05:29] anointing striking you him moving in and
[2:05:32] out Hallelujah that's what we're looking
[2:05:35] for hallelujah amen amen he said what
[2:05:39] shall I do with Jesus called the Christ
[2:05:40] he said let me say something too he said
[2:05:42] this uniting time to see churches
[2:05:44] uniting Nations uniting he said it's a
[2:05:46] uniting time of God and his bride too is
[2:05:51] that right
[2:05:52] he said and I say this with reverence
[2:05:53] and respect oh hear the prophet approach
[2:05:56] he said I believe that the bride of
[2:05:58] Christ is called I love how he said that
[2:06:01] he is not speaking in the past tense as
[2:06:03] if it's something that will happen he is
[2:06:05] speaking it present tense he said I
[2:06:07] believe that the bride of Christ is
[2:06:10] called amen isn't that right he said I
[2:06:12] believe she is sealed in the kingdom of
[2:06:15] God oh hallelujah oh say Amen somebody
[2:06:18] that word is for me this morning it's
[2:06:20] not going to happen it's all already
[2:06:22] done in the mind of God he said I
[2:06:24] believe there seal in the kingdom of God
[2:06:26] he said I believe the mechanics is there
[2:06:29] he said and they're waiting for the
[2:06:31] Dynamics that will take her off the
[2:06:33] Earth and into Glory into the Rapture he
[2:06:37] said I believe it with all of my heart
[2:06:41] oh are you looking for it are you under
[2:06:44] expectation for it we need a Dynamics to
[2:06:47] this church this morning Hallelujah he
[2:06:51] said I believe it all my heart he said
[2:06:52] yes sir he said we don't know how he's
[2:06:54] going to do it but he shall do it
[2:06:58] because he is the Dynamics he said we
[2:07:01] just become members of the machine of
[2:07:04] his body forming ourselves into his
[2:07:07] image and see him uniting himself with
[2:07:09] us in his works with his love gifts as
[2:07:13] he hands them to us just before the
[2:07:17] wedding supper another Ephesians what is
[2:07:19] it his love gifts handed to us before
[2:07:21] for the wedding supper isn't that right
[2:07:23] he said we're waiting watching for that
[2:07:24] their big church is to be United
[2:07:27] Hallelujah he said the Dynamics of this
[2:07:28] church will be a refilling of the holy
[2:07:31] spirit that we have worked in a small
[2:07:33] measure while The Headstone is coming
[2:07:35] down to unite with the body but when
[2:07:37] that head and that body unites together
[2:07:39] the full power of the Holy Ghost would
[2:07:40] raise her up just exactly like that he
[2:07:43] said even the dead even the dead in
[2:07:46] Christ for hundreds of years ago oh
[2:07:49] Luther is waiting on us Wesley is
[2:07:51] waiting on us the Pentecost is waiting
[2:07:53] on us irenius Martin Columba all these
[2:07:56] messengers of old who had mechanics and
[2:07:58] Dynamics in their day the Bible said
[2:08:00] they without us are not made
[2:08:05] perfect Hallelujah isn't that right it
[2:08:08] means therefore it's waiting on somebody
[2:08:10] to catch a reality to catch a burden for
[2:08:13] this message to catch a burden for
[2:08:15] what's required of each of our
[2:08:17] individual lives that we have to meet
[2:08:20] the mark that we have to be pressed
[2:08:23] towards the mark of the high calling if
[2:08:26] we want to make it out of here I don't
[2:08:28] know about you but I didn't come all
[2:08:30] this way just to skill time I didn't
[2:08:32] come all this way just to be a church
[2:08:34] member no no no no the Rapture is not
[2:08:36] for church members Rapture is not for
[2:08:38] those who want to just pay ties and go
[2:08:40] on no one day church will be over one
[2:08:43] day all this will be over you better
[2:08:45] have the token you better have the life
[2:08:48] you better have the anointing you better
[2:08:50] have the Holy ghost to show for this
[2:08:54] message oh hallelujah hallelujah oh
[2:08:58] hallelujah
[2:09:00] hallelujah listen I don't know what's
[2:09:01] going to happen tomorrow but said Los
[2:09:03] Angeles could sing tomorrow in the
[2:09:05] morning Hal but if this is my last
[2:09:07] service I want to preach this Hallelujah
[2:09:09] and believe this because I know that
[2:09:11] this is what will take us into the
[2:09:12] Rapture and into Glory Hal it'll take
[2:09:15] his Dynamic power to strike our
[2:09:17] mechanics and to make this word live I
[2:09:20] can't do it on my own
[2:09:22] I can't do it in myself but With God all
[2:09:25] things are possible and what we see this
[2:09:28] morning should make a church that should
[2:09:31] make a
[2:09:32] Revival oh hallelujah hallelujah oh get
[2:09:36] desperate friends time is short get
[2:09:39] desperate friends time is finishing this
[2:09:42] world is all about over but I hear a
[2:09:44] sound of the abundance of rain something
[2:09:48] is about to happen something is about to
[2:09:50] break that this world is not yet ready
[2:09:54] for hallelujah oh don't be caught with
[2:09:57] your work undone musician can get ready
[2:09:59] to come I'm finished prise God oh
[2:10:02] hallelujah
[2:10:04] amen uh but then when that head and body
[2:10:06] unites together the full power of the
[2:10:08] Holy Ghost would raise her up just
[2:10:10] exactly like that even the dead that's
[2:10:13] dead in Christ for hundreds of years
[2:10:15] will rise in the beauty of his Holiness
[2:10:17] and take a flight to the skies thank you
[2:10:19] Lord the Dynamics is is the holy spirit
[2:10:23] amen no dispute okay amen all right let
[2:10:28] me read this last quote here and finish
[2:10:30] amen our educational system our
[2:10:32] denominational system has took the place
[2:10:33] of the Holy Spirit leading in the church
[2:10:35] he said our great fine training of
[2:10:37] ministers and things has taken the place
[2:10:39] of all night prayer meetings and the all
[2:10:42] time way we used to get to God now
[2:10:45] instead of having preachers we got
[2:10:46] lecturers man who knows the word just as
[2:10:49] well could sit there put it together in
[2:10:51] such away and it's astounding how they
[2:10:53] could do it they know the mechanics but
[2:10:55] that ain't the Dynamics he said we want
[2:10:59] the Dynamics he said I don't care about
[2:11:02] the mechanics he said I want to know the
[2:11:05] Dynamics what does it do oh hallelujah
[2:11:10] hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right
[2:11:12] he said that's what we know he said God
[2:11:14] made the promise I'll sport my spirit
[2:11:16] Upon Our flesh Prophet talked about it
[2:11:18] he said it's like a fine car you have a
[2:11:20] car outside it tuned up it polished up
[2:11:22] all the Pistons and gear and everything
[2:11:24] and the muffler in the right place but
[2:11:26] if you can't turn the key it don't make
[2:11:28] no sense you just have a pretty car
[2:11:30] sitting down there and all they have now
[2:11:32] is pretty churches and nice people
[2:11:34] sitting there nice mechanics but no
[2:11:37] Dynamic power nothing to stir the bride
[2:11:40] up but the prophet said it would take
[2:11:42] those unknown Thunders to wake her up
[2:11:45] again the prophet said he will send it
[2:11:48] he promised it and I know it's going to
[2:11:51] happen oh because it's th sayth the Lord
[2:11:55] oh hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah
[2:11:59] few moment I'll finish he said I know
[2:12:01] that car runs out there he said it's got
[2:12:03] pistons and cylinders I know how much
[2:12:05] pressure it used you can play something
[2:12:06] softly the only thing I know is the
[2:12:09] Dynamics put her out there and drive it
[2:12:12] he said and that's what we know God made
[2:12:14] the promise he said I'll pour out my
[2:12:16] spirit upon All Flesh he said and your
[2:12:20] sons and daughters shall prophesy how is
[2:12:22] he going to do it I can't tell you but I
[2:12:25] just want to know that the Dynamics of
[2:12:28] God system he said that's the main thing
[2:12:32] oh and we're here to keep the main thing
[2:12:34] the main thing oh say Amen somebody he
[2:12:38] said today we studied the mechanics you
[2:12:39] can begin to stand he said until it's
[2:12:41] all mechanical but what good is an
[2:12:43] automobile without someone in it to
[2:12:46] drive it what good is the lights or the
[2:12:48] fixtures or whatever he said see we've
[2:12:50] got to have we got all the mechanics
[2:12:52] we've got school Educators could train
[2:12:54] man till he could stand in the pulpit
[2:12:56] and so on he said that don't bring the
[2:12:57] power of God he said where is the power
[2:13:00] of God that used to be in the church he
[2:13:02] said where is that Pentecostal blessing
[2:13:05] that used to flow through the churches
[2:13:07] he said that's the reason our world is
[2:13:08] falling apart because we've got away
[2:13:11] from the real principles of God and
[2:13:14] educated men into systems and things and
[2:13:17] that's what God Us in the condition
[2:13:18] we're today he said I believe that's the
[2:13:21] reason that our world is falling us
[2:13:23] apart he said like Israel back in her
[2:13:25] Promised Land she didn't know how she
[2:13:26] got back there but she just
[2:13:28] automatically got put back there why he
[2:13:30] said National Force put her in her place
[2:13:33] he said no I'm going to say something
[2:13:35] National Force put Israel in a Homeland
[2:13:38] National Force will put the church in a
[2:13:40] world Council of churches but the power
[2:13:42] of God will put the people in The Bride
[2:13:47] oh do you believe it the world force is
[2:13:49] this way and the world forces is that
[2:13:51] way but God's force is upward the spirit
[2:13:54] of God which is the word of God my SP
[2:13:56] word is spirit and life will put the
[2:13:58] bride in her place cuz she'll recognize
[2:14:01] her position in the word and then she's
[2:14:03] in Christ it'll put her in her place n
[2:14:06] no National Force would do it but the
[2:14:07] National Force will drive his to the
[2:14:09] Homeland so forth and so on but the
[2:14:10] power of God will raise the bride into
[2:14:12] glory and out of it I'm finished this
[2:14:16] morning may the Lord bless you let's
[2:14:18] lift our hands
[2:14:21] give God a shout of Praise this morning
