[33:31] and dwell among us we beheld his glory
[33:34] the glory as of the only begotten of the
[33:36] father
[33:37] full of grace and truth let's buy it one
[33:40] more time
[33:41] father these are weighted words
[33:43] and this is what was in the beginning
[33:45] lord and the word became flesh father
[33:47] may you come among us
[33:49] this morning and take me out of the way
[33:51] and may spirit spoken would be spoken
[33:54] granted lord and jesus may ask it amen
[33:56] you may be seated
[33:58] praise god
[34:00] this morning
[34:02] our title the word made flesh
[34:06] with made flesh
[34:08] of a subject three realms
[34:10] humanistic
[34:12] divine revelation
[34:15] and vision
[34:17] another inspiration
[34:19] the invisible
[34:20] become invisible
[34:23] now
[34:23] [Music]
[34:25] let's go
[34:27] so i
[34:28] i know sometimes people find or say it's
[34:31] a bit short or whatnot but
[34:33] what you get is concentrated stuff
[34:36] um i try not to have wasted words and
[34:40] and in the light of
[34:42] the timing that we have have been
[34:44] allowed we try to keep everything
[34:45] compact we have no we will to waste and
[34:49] no time to kill
[34:52] butler branham
[34:54] he's talking about
[34:55] preparation before we go to fight a war
[34:58] we have to prepare for that war
[35:00] if you're going to get married while you
[35:02] prepare for that time
[35:03] you have to have preparations before you
[35:06] come to church you made preparations
[35:08] he says
[35:09] and god
[35:11] is always he always prepares the people
[35:14] for the offense that just about to
[35:17] happen
[35:18] and may i stop here a minute and i
[35:21] believe that the people are in
[35:23] preparation for the last great
[35:25] destruction
[35:26] this world has ever known
[35:29] they are in the spirit of the last days
[35:32] and god here we go cannot send
[35:35] destruction before the people are in the
[35:38] spirit of destruction
[35:40] so in other words before you could even
[35:43] get into the coming of the lord you have
[35:45] to get in the spirit of
[35:47] the coming of the lord
[35:49] just as the people have to get in their
[35:50] spirit you have to get into your spirit
[35:53] that's how we know that time is drawing
[35:55] near not because something happened in
[35:56] america or happening in south america or
[35:58] happened in europe or some place no but
[36:00] because you're getting in the spirit
[36:02] and that is witness to you that you are
[36:05] nearing the coming of the lord
[36:07] oh glory to god so before destruction
[36:09] could be effected the people that they
[36:11] get in the spirit of rejoice destruction
[36:13] because destruction itself is a seed
[36:16] that was sown
[36:18] and came on the mount of a prophet
[36:20] hallelujah los angeles sinking is a word
[36:23] that came on the mount of the prophet
[36:25] and there's a rain to fall upon that
[36:27] seed for that to be manifested
[36:29] and your word also came on the mote of a
[36:31] prophet
[36:33] and your word gonna remain manifest
[36:35] in your season in your time
[36:37] that's why you couldn't miss it if you
[36:39] try
[36:40] you had to be here this morning this is
[36:42] a special service

[36:54] know what's going to happen in this
[36:55] service
[36:56] you don't know what god decreed for this
[36:58] service
[36:59] let me say it again you don't know what
[37:01] god decreed for you being here in this
[37:04] service this morning
[37:06] but one thing i could guarantee you he
[37:08] said my word shall not return unto me
[37:10] void

[37:52] and then his promises as is to come so
[37:56] all of his promises are true

[40:09] it is
[40:14] you own hebrews
[40:16] paul said abraham
[40:18] paid tithes to melchizedek
[40:21] when he was returning from the slaughter
[40:23] of the king
[40:24] and he said levi
[40:27] who was in the loins
[40:29] of abraham when he met merchandise
[40:32] coming from the slaughter and he was
[40:33] reckoned that levi paid tights
[40:38] and levi was two generations
[40:42] do you think god not concerned about you
[40:44] you know how god sees you this morning
[40:47] as the seed of the righteous
[40:49] knowing that the serpent seeds on the
[40:51] earth all them evil wicked spirits in
[40:54] flesh
[40:55] walk in the earth

[41:04] but light coming to you
[41:07] in such a time as this
[41:09] there shall be no frogging face
[41:11] there should be a thanksgiving and a
[41:14] praise to god
[41:15] for his mercy and his grace
[41:19] [Applause]
[41:22] let me see
[41:25] he reckoned levi paying tight also
[41:28] when he was in the loans of abraham his
[41:30] great great grandfather
[41:32] and he visit the sins of the people upon
[41:34] their children
[41:35] from generation to generation
[41:38] that won't keep his word
[41:40] what about her blessings
[41:43] from generation
[41:45] to generation
[41:46] you were all preplanned by god
[41:51] don't watch me say amen
[41:53] you believe that
[41:55] nothing happened by chance
[41:58] [Music]
[42:04] nothing
[42:06] nothing
[42:07] romans 8 28 and we know
[42:10] that all things
[42:12] work together
[42:14] for good to them that love god to them
[42:15] what he called
[42:17] according to his purpose
[42:19] oh glory to god
[42:22] he knows all about it
[42:24] it's all pre-planned for many
[42:25] generations
[42:27] so you could be here tonight did you
[42:28] know that
[42:30] [Music]
[42:35] so god saw my grandchildren before i was
[42:37] born
[42:41] that's a big one
[42:43] let me say that again
[42:45] god saw my grandchildren before i was
[42:47] born
[42:49] so god knew you would be here today
[42:55] god arranged all your life to bring you
[42:57] to the spot today
[42:58] [Applause]
[43:02] and you're going to hear why
[43:04] now watch let's continue
[43:05] just think about that at one time you
[43:07] was in your father in the dream of your
[43:09] father he didn't know you at that time
[43:11] neither did you know him at that time
[43:13] but then you see you were put in the
[43:14] bedding ground in the womb of a mother
[43:16] to holy wedlock and then you become a
[43:18] person expressed in the image like your
[43:20] father and then you have fellowship now
[43:22] that's the only way you can be a son or
[43:24] daughter of god because you have to be
[43:26] to have it in a life and there's only
[43:28] one from eternal life and that's god's
[43:30] life there's only one from eternal life
[43:32] that's god so to be a son of god you
[43:35] have to be in him always
[43:37] the gene of your life spiritual life
[43:40] tonight was in god
[43:42] the father before there was even a
[43:45] molecule
[43:46] and you are nothing but the
[43:48] manifestation of the gene of life that
[43:51] was in god
[43:52] as a son of god
[43:54] that's what you are this morning
[43:56] i don't care if your mother was a
[43:57] prostitute and the father was a drunkard
[43:59] i didn't have your grandfather was this
[44:00] and whatever it is god predestinated you
[44:03] to come forth
[44:04] as a gene on the earth
[44:06] a gene of god
[44:08] all kind of conditions he disguise you
[44:11] so satan wouldn't recognize to cut you
[44:13] off before time
[44:15] you were beaten pan you were hidden
[44:17] smoking drinking devil thought was you
[44:20] was one of his family only to find out
[44:23] when the world hit you
[44:25] you have to stagger out of what you're
[44:26] in
[44:27] to stagger into the world itself
[44:30] like that great mother eager
[44:33] you always was an eagle
[44:35] there never was a chicken
[44:37] even though he was in the chicken bun he
[44:39] had but when that mother eager scream
[44:41] over you something in you start to
[44:44] praise god hallelujah
[44:47] [Applause]
[44:50] you are expressed
[44:52] and after his word comes into you to
[44:54] light up this age you are expressing
[44:56] good life in you because you are son and
[44:58] daughter of god
[44:59] therefore you get what i mean you are
[45:02] now mead you are setting in this church
[45:04] tonight because your duty is to express
[45:08] god to this nation
[45:09] and this people and this neighborhood
[45:12] where you associate and wherever you are
[45:15] god knew that you would be here because
[45:18] you have to be one of his genes or his
[45:20] attributes you had to be if you ever
[45:23] have eternal life it always was eternal
[45:25] life and god before the foundation of
[45:27] the world knew you that you would be
[45:29] here
[45:30] and when the word or the water or the
[45:33] washing of the water of the world fell
[45:35] on you it was expressed in a being
[45:38] i know you are fellowship with your
[45:40] father
[45:41] god just as you have with your earthly
[45:42] father you are children sons and
[45:45] daughters of god
[45:46] let us strike you this morning not son
[45:48] of your father and mother natural sons
[45:50] and daughters of the living god
[45:53] he said whose son am i now
[45:56] hallelujah i was the son of charles and
[45:58] elle branham but who shall am i now
[46:01] oh glory to god i'm a gene of god
[46:04] a thought of god
[46:06] that must be expressed
[46:09] by the word of god
[46:11] or give the lord a shout
[46:13] do you see who we are this morning
[46:15] you are a gene thought
[46:17] that must be expressed by the word you
[46:20] can't come to connect with nothing else
[46:24] let me be seated
[46:26] here we go
[46:27] jesus
[46:28] was the fullness of god manifested
[46:31] he was the fullness of the godhead
[46:33] bodily
[46:34] therefore are you ready
[46:36] when he came to the earth
[46:38] and was manifested in flesh
[46:41] you were in him then
[46:46] because he was the word
[46:48] and in the beginning was the word
[46:51] and the word was with god
[46:53] and the word was god
[46:55] so your genetic connection was there in
[46:57] the beginning
[46:59] when the word came
[47:01] and that word came and become flesh
[47:04] oh glory to god hallelujah you were
[47:07] locked up in him let's continue
[47:09] hallelujah
[47:10] the word of the flesh therefore you walk
[47:12] with him
[47:14] when you were in him
[47:15] when he was on earth you suffered with
[47:17] him
[47:18] you died with him
[47:21] you was buried with him
[47:23] and you are
[47:25] risen with him
[47:27] all glory to god
[47:29] what a fear to take a hold upon that
[47:31] your flesh can't hold up you know
[47:34] because your flesh declares what is in
[47:36] the humanistic realm
[47:40] [Music]
[47:41] it's just only three realms you know
[47:44] the first realm is where people really
[47:46] live
[47:46] the human is sick realm frustrated
[47:49] husband frustrated wife first with the
[47:50] neighbor quarrel carry on and victorious
[47:53] one upset with this one and get in a
[47:54] situation and you can't handle it and
[47:56] you're fed up and what like this is
[47:57] humanistic
[47:58] that is that god program
[48:00] when when they issue the commandment
[48:03] that everybody have to come into the
[48:05] city to take census
[48:07] and mary pregnant with joseph
[48:10] they had a choice i ain't bothering with
[48:11] the government i don't care what he got
[48:13] men see
[48:15] if they had gone that way where jesus
[48:16] was going to be born
[48:18] because jesus wasn't in position
[48:21] according to scripture
[48:23] and to get him in position herod had to
[48:26] call taxation and and sign up and write
[48:29] up and and check up on all that
[48:31] so joseph had to take mary and check the
[48:33] donkey and get down into bethlehem
[48:36] because the bible said out of bethlehem
[48:39] you're not hearing me this morning
[48:41] are you hearing me this morning
[48:43] nothing is by chance
[48:45] oh god i have to rock this here god had
[48:48] to send orders here god had to level it
[48:51] here it's not about herod it's about you
[48:54] okay the lord has shout it's not about
[48:57] no press
[48:59] and the world comes to the churches
[49:01] this is about the bride of jesus christ
[49:03] [Applause]
[49:08] glory
[49:14] he said setting in heavenly places
[49:17] already raised
[49:19] resurrected to new life
[49:21] settling in heavenly places in christ he
[49:23] said that means so much nowadays church
[49:25] that means so much to us to see
[49:28] ourselves positionally placed in jesus
[49:30] christ
[49:32] now if we are those attributes
[49:36] of god
[49:37] we cannot live by creeds
[49:42] if you are attribute of god the other
[49:44] comedy baptist methodist pentecostal
[49:45] you're calling by creed
[49:47] you can't be like to our father entry
[49:48] healing you can live like that
[49:50] because you could only connect to the
[49:52] world
[49:53] that is why jesus could boldly say all
[49:56] that the father had given me shall come
[50:00] and satan had to take her in the pipe
[50:02] and smoke it because he cannot stop all
[50:05] that the father had already given so you
[50:07] are not no coming to the lord
[50:09] wake up this morning he foreknew you
[50:12] that's why he called you
[50:14] in otherwise he was thinking about you
[50:16] before
[50:18] that is why things are pre-planned
[50:21] and god arranged
[50:23] oh hallelujah praise god
[50:26] hallelujah
[50:27] is almighty god that arranged that my
[50:29] mother get baptized at the age of 92.
[50:34] whatever age
[50:35] after being a catholic for all these
[50:37] years but she knew
[50:38] hallelujah that one day she had to hit
[50:40] the waters
[50:42] and when that time come she hit the
[50:43] waters
[50:44] and you know what she did she until none
[50:46] of the other family members
[50:47] because she knew they all thought that
[50:49] was going to come
[50:51] so they were stunned
[50:53] when she hit the waters and get baptized
[50:54] in jesus name
[50:56] but god arranged all of that
[50:58] he will confound the wise and the
[51:00] prudent
[51:02] all glory to god hallelujah he will take
[51:04] the weak things to confront the things
[51:06] that are strong all glory to god he will
[51:09] take the people that doesn't look like
[51:11] his people and make them his people
[51:13] here's why he came unto his own his own
[51:16] receive him not but as many as receive
[51:19] him
[51:20] to dare me give power
[51:22] power forward to become the sons of god
[51:26] oh we are not trinidadians we are sons
[51:29] and daughters of the living god
[51:32] [Applause]
[51:34] [Music]
[51:37] maybe seated
[51:39] therefore
[51:40] we must be
[51:42] that word bride
[51:44] what is that word bride
[51:46] what is that word by question the
[51:48] manifestation of this hour the bride not
[51:50] a creed or denomination but a living
[51:54] oracle of god
[51:56] a living
[51:57] attribute of god displaying to the world
[52:01] the attributes of god in the formation
[52:04] of the bride that has been expressed in
[52:06] this hour that we are now living in
[52:09] oh my
[52:10] god so he said it
[52:12] in the beginning was the word
[52:14] and the word was with god
[52:16] he said in the beginning was elohim
[52:18] an elohim became the word
[52:22] and the word was elohim
[52:24] and the word was made elohim
[52:27] that is him unfolding
[52:29] so elaine was what self-existent one
[52:32] was even god yet
[52:34] he alone could be self-existent function
[52:36] of spirit
[52:37] but then he projected himself into the
[52:39] logos word
[52:41] and that word is what came in the
[52:42] beginning
[52:43] and in the beginning god said let there
[52:45] be
[52:46] let there be
[52:47] he couldn't do anything else but speak
[52:50] because a word is a taught express
[52:52] so therefore the thought had to be
[52:54] created by the word
[52:55] so you can't just think it you have to
[52:57] express it and that's where the word
[52:59] coming to speak it
[53:01] oh glory to god hallelujah
[53:04] so in him was taught he wanted to become
[53:06] material oh glory to god you can't see
[53:09] material that material he was thoughts
[53:13] could you see a thought
[53:14] no
[53:15] it has to become material
[53:17] and the the channel become materialist
[53:20] by by coming through the channel of the
[53:21] word
[53:23] so the thought is here in the mind of
[53:24] god
[53:25] in the intelligence of god in the
[53:28] awesomeness of god
[53:30] in the invisibility of god but that
[53:32] invisibility that thinking have to have
[53:35] a channel by which it could come because
[53:38] he wanted to become material
[53:40] this was his burden
[53:42] how could i come from thought where they
[53:44] can't see me as invisible that i could
[53:46] become visible so he had to use the
[53:49] channel of the word
[53:50] and when he pressed his way and become
[53:53] loma's word that word became flesh
[53:56] nobody could handle him
[53:57] now we could see him now he he can be
[54:01] touched oh glory oh forgive me this
[54:03] morning
[54:04] he can be touched by the feeling of our
[54:07] infirmities
[54:10] [Music]
[54:11] what our loving god we have
[54:13] what a savior we have
[54:15] he didn't say mysterious all sealed up
[54:17] in the back
[54:18] on stage in heaven he came down himself
[54:21] to become one of us
[54:23] oh glory to god hallelujah praise god
[54:25] isn't that something else
[54:27] but the name was thoughts
[54:29] he wanted to become material
[54:31] what did he do then he spoke a word
[54:34] and the word was materialized
[54:37] and hear this that's the whole picture
[54:40] from
[54:41] genesis to revelation
[54:42] that's the bible there
[54:44] there's nothing wrong is elohim
[54:47] materializing so he can be touched
[54:51] and feel
[54:53] so now
[54:54] we find out god and o people god
[54:57] so he know that we will come to the
[54:58] place to read write a repetition
[55:00] so he put the word in print
[55:03] that we could catch the word
[55:05] and find where age is written
[55:07] but that is not god's purpose to stay in
[55:09] print
[55:10] no he always wanted to become material
[55:13] a virgin shall conceive that's on print
[55:16] because that came with him out of a
[55:17] prophet
[55:18] but when god say a virgin shall conceive
[55:20] and that was put on print god always
[55:22] knew was mary
[55:24] he knew her name
[55:26] he knew her village
[55:27] she knew her city
[55:29] she knew he knew what generation she
[55:31] would be born in
[55:32] she know he know who will be married
[55:34] parents
[55:35] so when he said virginia conceived is
[55:36] already done
[55:38] in his thinking
[55:39] but in the unfolding of it
[55:42] it took a time
[55:44] for the history to be unfolded
[55:46] so that word could only circle the earth
[55:48] until mary came on the scene
[55:51] and once mary stepped on the scene
[55:52] nobody else could pick that up
[55:54] that power
[55:55] that revelation that inspiration only
[55:59] one woman could pick that up
[56:01] and this bride come on now you oh them
[56:04] seven thunders
[56:08] glory the god is only one woman
[56:11] on the earth could pick up the exclusive
[56:13] bright promises
[56:15] but american preacher ton lord of stuff
[56:18] people could preach anything they want
[56:20] to preach
[56:21] but there are some exclusive promises
[56:24] for this bride of jesus christ
[56:26] and we pump in one to you this morning
[56:28] an exclusive promise
[56:30] where the word will become flesh
[56:33] and whose flesh

[56:44] talking about in your flesh
[56:46] i am talking about in your head and your
[56:48] heart and your flesh and your flesh

[57:11] afterwards when people bunch of the
[57:13] bunks in the wood
[57:15] oh glory to god when you lay hands upon
[57:17] people is the word lame hands if they
[57:19] lay hands upon the sick they shall
[57:20] recover
[57:22] oh glory to god after a while you have
[57:24] supernatural escorts
[57:26] because angels associate themselves with
[57:28] you
[57:29] to protect you a long life's journey
[57:32] no devil can move unless you get
[57:33] permission to move
[57:37] nothing could stop you

[57:42] oh god god put the hedge around you
[57:45] oh glory to god because there is a
[57:47] purpose for your life no car coming the
[57:50] bombshell
[57:51] no roofing falling on your head you're
[57:54] dying by no accident what give the lord
[57:56] our prayers offering
[57:58] oh
[57:59] hallelujah hallelujah
[58:01] hallelujah
[58:03] hallelujah hallelujah
[58:05] be too fat on the road
[58:07] there will be no mistakes
[58:12] may be seated
[58:14] so watch
[58:15] who am i
[58:17] in the millennium elohim
[58:19] would be honest sitting on the throne
[58:21] and all his subjects around him
[58:23] he brought the estimated before the
[58:24] front of the world
[58:26] he said like a man building chimes to
[58:27] make chimes the moulder each bell had to
[58:29] have a certain ring from the other
[58:32] the same material but so much iron so
[58:34] much steel so much brass to make it to
[58:36] give it the thing
[58:37] and that's the way here we go that's the
[58:39] comparison that's the way god did he
[58:41] bred this one to that one to that one
[58:43] this one until he get exactly what he
[58:45] wanted
[58:46] and that's how we come down god unveiled
[58:48] himself in a pillow fire down to the
[58:50] prophets then into the son of god which
[58:52] was god see it's the same god bringing
[58:54] out exactly it was the same god formed
[58:57] in a man called a prophet
[59:00] and the word of the lord came to this
[59:02] man so it wasn't the prophet
[59:04] the prophet was the veil but the word
[59:06] was god
[59:08] the prophet was what
[59:11] the veil
[59:12] but the word was god
[59:14] so there the bible said let every seed
[59:15] bring forth after this kind is that
[59:16] right
[59:17] and the sea was in the earth right and
[59:19] there was darkness upon the earth but
[59:21] the spirit of god prevented brood over
[59:23] the seas
[59:24] all glory to god so he brewed over the
[59:26] prophets he pulled over moses he put
[59:29] over sect
[59:30] he keep brewed and he keeps brewed and
[59:32] he keeps prudent until finally one came
[59:35] that he blew over
[59:37] and that was jesus christ
[59:39] that was the perfect son of god
[59:41] oh what was he doing he's trying to
[59:43] bring back the image
[59:45] that was lost in the garden of eden
[59:47] because when adam was standing that
[59:49] perfect image the whole image fell up
[59:51] it fell on the ground so god began to
[59:53] brood bring back you have set replace
[59:56] enable and keep it going down one after
[59:58] the other of the other or glory to god
[1:00:00] what he's doing he's coming back to the
[1:00:02] image and when jesus came he was the
[1:00:05] statue
[1:00:07] of a perfect man
[1:00:09] the image and likeness at last
[1:00:11] was restored by the second adam
[1:00:14] this second atom was not going to fall
[1:00:17] this second atom was not going to fail
[1:00:21] out of the mouth of the second adam
[1:00:24] what's going to come other sons
[1:00:26] oh glory to god did you hear what i said
[1:00:29] out of the mouth
[1:00:31] of the second adam
[1:00:32] was going to come other sons
[1:00:35] all glory to god
[1:00:37] from his very body
[1:00:39] he said receive the holy ghost he was
[1:00:42] speaking life
[1:00:44] over the seeds of god
[1:00:46] oh give the lord a shout
[1:00:49] and today life is being spoken
[1:00:52] you shall receive the holy ghost
[1:00:54] oh receiving the holy ghost
[1:00:57] life is being spoken
[1:00:59] your life is going to change
[1:01:02] oh my
[1:01:04] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:01:06] jehovah as a baby
[1:01:08] jehovah is a captain son
[1:01:11] jehovah as a teenager jehovah as a young
[1:01:14] man jehovah in the temple jehovah read
[1:01:17] in the book
[1:01:19] hallelujah
[1:01:21] my god
[1:01:22] so each age has been given a promise of
[1:01:25] the word
[1:01:26] and the people of that age
[1:01:29] that manifest the promised word
[1:01:32] is the seed of the age
[1:01:34] so all this talk and talk about ice
[1:01:36] bride and when bride because he's taken
[1:01:37] a church this morning hearing about a
[1:01:39] prophet that's not what he's saying here
[1:01:41] he said the people of the age
[1:01:44] that manifest
[1:01:45] the promised word
[1:01:47] is the seed
[1:01:49] so if you want to sit back and be a
[1:01:50] choice member that's your choice but if
[1:01:52] you want to be seen you should see
[1:01:54] something this morning and say you know
[1:01:56] what i want that
[1:01:57] i want to manifest that
[1:01:59] or you can say this way i want that to
[1:02:01] be manifested in me
[1:02:03] or you can say it this way i want the
[1:02:05] word
[1:02:07] to become
[1:02:08] flesh
[1:02:10] in my flesh
[1:02:12] come on now come on now you have to say
[1:02:14] all of it
[1:02:15] you have to say all of it
[1:02:17] you can't just by the word made flesh
[1:02:19] because that's in the bible but when you
[1:02:21] say in my flesh
[1:02:23] like job said
[1:02:24] in my flesh
[1:02:26] i shall see god
[1:02:28] for myself another another
[1:02:31] oh glory to god oh my
[1:02:35] so he said the manifestation of the holy
[1:02:37] spirit
[1:02:38] operating through his children
[1:02:40] is the seed of the kingdom
[1:02:43] of that age
[1:02:45] now watch
[1:02:47] you said
[1:02:48] if
[1:02:50] you said it's fate right
[1:02:52] you said glory to god preacher he said i
[1:02:54] don't believe in all this stuff
[1:02:55] if you got real fate here we go
[1:02:58] it will declare your works
[1:03:01] your works will declare you say this way
[1:03:04] your works will declare what your fate
[1:03:07] is
[1:03:09] so it is coming now beyond confession
[1:03:11] beyond saying i believe
[1:03:13] no
[1:03:14] your works will vindicate or prove
[1:03:17] what you're confessing
[1:03:19] he says your works will declare what
[1:03:21] your faith is
[1:03:22] a boy told me not long ago if god judges
[1:03:25] me according to my faith i am saved but
[1:03:27] if you judge me according to my morals i
[1:03:29] am lost
[1:03:32] you see what you do there
[1:03:33] he's saying he's a believer right
[1:03:35] but he do know all kinds of crazy stuff
[1:03:37] you see if he's faith and believing i
[1:03:39] said
[1:03:40] but if i check my works on my life i
[1:03:42] lost
[1:03:43] listen what the prophet answered him
[1:03:45] he says i said your morals testify of
[1:03:49] your faith
[1:03:52] so in other words that crazy life you're
[1:03:53] living there it shows the faith that you
[1:03:55] think you have you don't have there's a
[1:03:57] lot of unbelief in certain that are
[1:03:59] there
[1:04:00] oh glory to god hallelujah
[1:04:02] so watch
[1:04:04] he said you know you've got to get the
[1:04:06] living word in you
[1:04:07] to have the living god in you
[1:04:10] because the word here is god
[1:04:12] when
[1:04:13] it is made flesh in you
[1:04:16] means spirit
[1:04:18] so when the word is made spirit in you
[1:04:21] that is the word becoming flesh
[1:04:23] because the spirit takes you out of the
[1:04:26] humanistic realm
[1:04:27] into the realm of divine revelation
[1:04:31] oh glory only spirit could do that other
[1:04:33] than that you're operating at the mental
[1:04:35] level so if at the mental level they
[1:04:37] come here believe the word and somebody
[1:04:39] telling something negative about but
[1:04:41] afterwards you get a mental fight
[1:04:43] because you see that's about me
[1:04:44] that's in your head that is in your mind
[1:04:46] but if you have a revelation and you
[1:04:48] hear any word that have nothing to do
[1:04:49] with you you want to know what's the
[1:04:51] objective of somebody tell your negative
[1:04:53] you follow what i'm saying now and
[1:04:55] that's how people can be tossed to and
[1:04:56] fro because they have no anchor they go
[1:04:58] to this church they go to this church
[1:05:00] they go to that group they go to that
[1:05:01] group and they're still not satisfied
[1:05:03] because they never encountered the
[1:05:04] person of christ
[1:05:06] oh glory to god because once you
[1:05:07] encounter him it doesn't matter god
[1:05:09] could put you in rome
[1:05:10] but you could be in the vatican
[1:05:12] that'll change who you are
[1:05:14] that have changed your name on the book
[1:05:16] that's a change that's mighty god who
[1:05:18] you're serving
[1:05:20] oh glory to god hallelujah there could
[1:05:22] be a servant in the papal village
[1:05:25] and so pope francis that they change who
[1:05:27] you are
[1:05:28] and what you call on to give the lord a
[1:05:30] praise this bride is ordained to defeat
[1:05:32] the devil anywhere
[1:05:35] any place
[1:05:37] under any condition why you think god
[1:05:39] choose you in this hour why didn't god
[1:05:41] choose you for this age
[1:05:43] because you know it'd be a messed up
[1:05:44] tied up tangle up
[1:05:47] but he chose you anyhow
[1:05:49] oh my hallelujah
[1:05:51] so here we go
[1:05:52] so you've got to get the living word in
[1:05:54] you
[1:05:55] to have the living god in you because
[1:05:57] the word here is god when it's made
[1:05:59] flesh in you means spirit and life in
[1:06:01] you when it goes
[1:06:03] when it goes into your flesh
[1:06:06] and your faith
[1:06:08] and becomes life
[1:06:10] then you are a living example
[1:06:13] so you move from being a professor to
[1:06:15] being a possessor
[1:06:17] hallelujah you move from professing to
[1:06:20] believe to actually having a possession
[1:06:22] because the word has become life in you
[1:06:25] the world has become in your flesh and
[1:06:27] faith
[1:06:27] not just in your fate alone but in your
[1:06:29] flesh too and your flesh means the word
[1:06:31] is active so as hostility was your
[1:06:33] husband that changes who started was
[1:06:36] your wife that changes
[1:06:38] upset and carrying on that changes
[1:06:40] because now that word is effective in
[1:06:42] your flesh
[1:06:44] so it affects your behavior it affects
[1:06:46] your attitude it affects how you see
[1:06:49] things and how you see others
[1:06:51] oh glory to god you have oats and
[1:06:53] grudges but when that word hits you it
[1:06:55] affects it you in your flesh that you
[1:06:57] know you can't hold that ought if you
[1:06:59] hold it god holds it against you
[1:07:01] oh glory to god you have to forgive your
[1:07:03] brother and as you release him god
[1:07:04] release you
[1:07:06] oh glory to god and faith is based upon
[1:07:08] forgiveness as you release all those you
[1:07:10] have ought against your faith has to go
[1:07:11] higher higher higher and it brings in an
[1:07:13] atmosphere where you can receive your
[1:07:15] healing deliverance and sealant some
[1:07:17] people are not delivered because of the
[1:07:18] condition of the heart
[1:07:20] oh glory to god hallelujah you have to
[1:07:23] have faith
[1:07:24] my god amen
[1:07:26] all right let's continue you say then
[1:07:28] you become when it goes into your flesh
[1:07:30] and your fate and becomes alive then you
[1:07:33] will live an example you're an epistle
[1:07:35] of god read of all men you won't have it
[1:07:37] like christ not the fullness because
[1:07:39] it's divided up until they are pentecos
[1:07:41] so the bride
[1:07:43] will not be a denomination
[1:07:45] so look into a church or a group that
[1:07:46] forget about it it will have to be the
[1:07:48] word manifested to be the bread of
[1:07:50] christ
[1:07:51] so the bride is christ who
[1:07:53] word talked
[1:07:54] no
[1:07:55] word expressed no word explained no word
[1:07:58] revealed no word manifested
[1:08:01] that's the bride
[1:08:03] she's what
[1:08:04] word
[1:08:05] manifested
[1:08:07] oh glo you have my time for talking
[1:08:09] every time
[1:08:10] explanation
[1:08:11] jesus was in the temple age 12
[1:08:14] isn't that right
[1:08:15] and he was confounding those pharisees
[1:08:17] but just would alone he wasn't allowed
[1:08:19] that child could speak so he's about my
[1:08:20] father's business
[1:08:21] and for 18 years he was silent
[1:08:24] no manifestation
[1:08:26] from 12 to 30 18 years of silence and
[1:08:29] he's going to hear them preaching things
[1:08:31] that they don't even know what they're
[1:08:32] talking about he had them in two person
[1:08:34] words they don't know what they're
[1:08:34] talking about and when his time come
[1:08:36] after the holy ghost fell upon him power
[1:08:39] inside of him
[1:08:40] he slap up and tap up the devil and set
[1:08:42] him running
[1:08:43] take him take a holiday take off
[1:08:46] and jesus returning the power of the
[1:08:47] spirit into the tabernacle
[1:08:49] and he took up the scripture from isaiah
[1:08:51] the spirit is upon me
[1:08:53] cool and cucumber
[1:08:55] hallelujah
[1:08:56] precious as ever and he took the book
[1:08:58] test the book sat down and said this day
[1:09:01] the scripture's fulfilled
[1:09:04] decided to argue they start to fuss they
[1:09:07] start to carry on and he'll leave them
[1:09:08] the argument i start to kill the sick
[1:09:11] cast or devils
[1:09:12] oh glory to god you have to manifest the
[1:09:14] works and shut them up
[1:09:16] this bright girl shot the mortal the
[1:09:18] critics
[1:09:19] yes yes yes we silent for years
[1:09:21] but god
[1:09:23] the word
[1:09:24] will become flesh
[1:09:26] and the invisible
[1:09:28] will become visible
[1:09:30] in you
[1:09:31] okay the lord i shall preach back to me
[1:09:33] now
[1:09:34] all glory to god hallelujah
[1:09:37] all glory to god hallelujah hallelujah
[1:09:40] hallelujah
[1:09:44] that woman who was crying at jesus feet
[1:09:47] who stole the party and passed away back
[1:09:49] though
[1:09:50] because you see jesus fit duty
[1:09:52] making the cry and wipe us here and all
[1:09:54] them should shoot and see if you know
[1:09:55] what kind of woman that is and all them
[1:09:57] grumbling drama he's saying a word he's
[1:09:58] silent
[1:10:00] you won't even know what if you're doing
[1:10:01] right or wrong what what's going on
[1:10:03] she's just doing him as service
[1:10:05] and then all of a sudden jesus broke the
[1:10:06] silence say simon i have a word for you
[1:10:09] are you here to talk now
[1:10:10] give them chance to think and talk and

[1:10:57] woman
[1:10:58] she broke out to the humanistic
[1:11:00] and she broke into revelation that the
[1:11:02] same thing happened to women in the
[1:11:03] world that's why she run that's why she
[1:11:06] could shout because she out of the human
[1:11:09] she going back to the same people she
[1:11:10] ducking and hiding from she said come

[1:11:40] because i'm now beginning to see
[1:11:42] how this thing is about to unfold
[1:11:45] i'm now beginning to see how the
[1:11:46] critic's mouth will be shut
[1:11:48] i'm now beginning to see how the bride
[1:11:50] will interpret the word itself
[1:11:52] so when people talking and arguing
[1:11:54] debates and the bride have nothing to
[1:11:55] argue they're just doing my father work
[1:11:58] and i will also give the lord a shout
[1:12:01] hallelujah
[1:12:03] oh glory to god
[1:12:05] what they say you can't do you'll be
[1:12:07] doing.
[1:12:08] [Music]
[1:12:12] you know jesus started with low miracles
[1:12:14] and went up higher higher higher
[1:12:16] first miracle was watching the wine
[1:12:18] he didn't say with the water let me tell
[1:12:20] him why no he was a guest and he went in
[1:12:22] wine right now they come to him he said
[1:12:24] what have they do with that
[1:12:26] and they just say whatever that man said
[1:12:27] do it he said draw waters and pour it
[1:12:29] out
[1:12:30] and then they recognize this is the best
[1:12:32] wine
[1:12:33] jesus turned water to wine he bypassed
[1:12:35] the person of the graves he bypass all
[1:12:36] the procedure all the three for six
[1:12:38] months to have the grapes fermenting he
[1:12:40] bypassed all of that and just flipped
[1:12:41] the water into wine
[1:12:43] so he could bypass all your troubles all
[1:12:44] your trials all your plastic bypass and
[1:12:47] flip your water in
[1:12:50] [Applause]
[1:12:52] i'm not hearing you
[1:12:54] all your intellectual flipping
[1:12:55] gymnastics in your head he can flip that
[1:12:58] and turn it into something in your heart
[1:13:00] turn water into the wine of revelation
[1:13:03] that you'll be inspired
[1:13:05] all glory to god and being inspired
[1:13:07] changes you
[1:13:09] you can't beat a man who's inspired you
[1:13:11] know
[1:13:15] the copy the mechanic was inspired a
[1:13:17] doctor was inspired
[1:13:18] a woman who's inspired a sim stress
[1:13:21] farmer whoever you can't beat a man
[1:13:23] who's inspired he just gets it right
[1:13:26] why he's inspired
[1:13:28] oh glory to god hallelujah praise god

[1:13:33] hallelujah
[1:13:34] like that man it was a drought well i'm

[1:14:17] know the kingdom is preached and every
[1:14:20] man
[1:14:21] pressed your way into it
[1:14:23] oh give the lord a shout
[1:14:25] come on you're gonna die out to yourself
[1:14:28] yes yes yes yes yes
[1:14:30] every evil spirit every unclean spirit
[1:14:32] every wicked spirit
[1:14:34] all glory to god remember god elected
[1:14:36] you before them spirits come on the
[1:14:37] earth
[1:14:39] my god
[1:14:46] there are three elements a man follows
[1:14:48] there are three elements that a man
[1:14:50] follows first is humanistic
[1:14:53] second is divine revelation
[1:14:55] third is vision
[1:14:57] and that's thus here the lord
[1:14:59] so many times we are down here never
[1:15:01] climb into this your dong dear cast your
[1:15:04] hopes to the veil
[1:15:06] and okay
[1:15:07] he says now when you're down here you
[1:15:09] said um
[1:15:10] okay
[1:15:11] mary couldn't understand how she could
[1:15:12] have a baby not knowing no man what mary
[1:15:15] was on
[1:15:16] divine revelation
[1:15:17] she knew what god said she all she had
[1:15:19] one question oh shall these things be
[1:15:21] he said holy ghost all over shadow
[1:15:23] that was finishing me that's what mary
[1:15:24] needed to hear she needs to feel
[1:15:26] pregnant and feel the belly something
[1:15:27] moving no she ran immediately that was
[1:15:30] fate make your door
[1:15:31] fate becomes active and mary ran
[1:15:34] straight into this against i'm gonna
[1:15:35] baby his name before jesus elizabeth
[1:15:38] have john inside her belly already and
[1:15:40] join her move yet and when she said
[1:15:42] jesus jumps at the shop and job
[1:15:44] oh glory to god hallelujah now what if
[1:15:46] mary didn't go she couldn't get any
[1:15:48] testimony john couldn't hear jesus but
[1:15:50] when here john yeah jesus don't know
[1:15:52] already he coming to introduce this man
[1:15:54] that's why he comes six months before
[1:15:56] oh glory to god because you can't
[1:15:58] introduce yourself john had to introduce
[1:16:00] him
[1:16:00] oh glory to god could we give the lord
[1:16:02] some praises
[1:16:04] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:16:06] so the first one is humanistic where we
[1:16:08] are done here we see i'll pray for that
[1:16:10] person i'm hoping that they get well
[1:16:12] next is divine revelation that's when
[1:16:14] something done in your heart anchors it
[1:16:16] and say it's going to happen
[1:16:18] then something is going to happen then
[1:16:20] the third element is vision or the word
[1:16:22] of the lord made manifest
[1:16:24] and that's thus here the lord
[1:16:26] there's no feeling in that
[1:16:28] that is vision and the bride going to
[1:16:31] have to see the lord
[1:16:33] or she keeps still
[1:16:34] so he's actually prophesying the bible
[1:16:37] would break into that tale level
[1:16:39] which is vision which is the prophetic
[1:16:40] vision and that we're still locked in
[1:16:43] write the vision and make it plain
[1:16:44] because you know the vision is is thus
[1:16:46] you the lord
[1:16:47] notice when you have a vision you can
[1:16:49] fit everything into it
[1:16:51] because the vision gives you the whole
[1:16:53] picture
[1:16:54] you can fit every part into it
[1:16:56] oh glory to god isn't that right so
[1:16:59] christ didn't send people to build
[1:17:00] churches and seminaries no he sent under
[1:17:02] preaching gospel and the gospel isn't
[1:17:04] word only but through power and
[1:17:06] manifestation of the holy spirit which
[1:17:08] will produce the signs of mark 16.
[1:17:12] the message will they want to hear that
[1:17:13] they want to hear more mysteries and
[1:17:14] more talk
[1:17:15] and we wrongly wrote past 50 years now
[1:17:17] since god took the prophet off
[1:17:19] but the gospel
[1:17:21] is not word only
[1:17:23] but the gospel is power and
[1:17:25] manifestation of the holy spirit that
[1:17:27] would produce the science of mark 16
[1:17:30] when he said go on the one and preach
[1:17:31] the gospel right the word itself is dead
[1:17:34] here we go until it becomes interaction
[1:17:37] and produces life
[1:17:39] so man of word but he went dead you'd
[1:17:41] have to take quickness power it have to
[1:17:43] take the life of the world jesus himself
[1:17:46] said the word and i speak their spirit
[1:17:47] in their life they'll just take it as
[1:17:49] word only because god said let there be
[1:17:50] nothing happen it could take a hundred
[1:17:52] years a thousand years but then and
[1:17:54] there was light
[1:17:56] oh glory to god don't let the time
[1:17:58] element fool you
[1:17:59] all glory to god wants is the word and
[1:18:01] it's god it has to come to pass
[1:18:04] oh glory to god that's why faith could
[1:18:06] work with patience once it's spoken
[1:18:11] [Music]
[1:18:13] when god told abraham you have a son god
[1:18:14] didn't have a fight you know
[1:18:16] the doctors had a fight
[1:18:18] syria had a fight abram had his
[1:18:21] questions but abraham had a revelation
[1:18:23] because god spoke to him
[1:18:25] so he was not in the humanistic realm he
[1:18:28] couldn't laugh like serious it wasn't
[1:18:29] human instagram but abraham was under
[1:18:31] divine revelation
[1:18:33] oh glory to god and that divine
[1:18:34] revelation gave him a divine expectation
[1:18:37] for the manifestation he had so much
[1:18:39] revelation he had to believe for himself
[1:18:41] and for sarah too
[1:18:43] that her flesh would be changed because
[1:18:45] no old woman having no baby oh glory to
[1:18:48] god so abraham had to believe in god
[1:18:50] transforming power
[1:18:52] and so help me god
[1:18:55] oh glory to god we can produce nothing
[1:18:57] who we are we have to have faith in this
[1:18:59] transforming power
[1:19:01] oh glory to god before you go raptor you
[1:19:03] have to be changed on the inside brother
[1:19:05] the raptor is inside out
[1:19:07] because your flesh be caught up to meet
[1:19:09] him in the air your inside has to be
[1:19:11] caught up
[1:19:12] that's what this gospel is all about
[1:19:15] that's what dynamics is all about
[1:19:17] my goal let's continue
[1:19:19] oh glory i see cancer trembling i see
[1:19:22] tumor trembling i see blindness i see
[1:19:24] death and shaking
[1:19:27] as the sons of god step into the
[1:19:28] anointing and step into the fate that
[1:19:31] was once delivered to the saints you
[1:19:33] talk about the super church you talk
[1:19:34] about the super race you talk with an
[1:19:37] anointing to strike the church of the
[1:19:38] living god
[1:19:43] glory hallelujah
[1:19:48] it has to be the right condition and he
[1:19:50] said chicken could hatch under a dog put
[1:19:52] an egg on that dog is the atmosphere
[1:19:55] it has to have an atmosphere for things
[1:19:57] to break out isn't that right
[1:19:59] hallelujah
[1:20:01] he said did you notice moab on the
[1:20:02] mountain israel holy ruler dung in the
[1:20:05] valley and both of them are seven altars
[1:20:07] seven sacrifices both of them seven
[1:20:09] blocks both of them seven rams speaking
[1:20:11] of the common christ but the brethren
[1:20:13] where balaam failed to see was the signs
[1:20:15] and wonders following the believers down
[1:20:16] here so both had lambs both had rams
[1:20:20] both had seven both have alters one have
[1:20:22] signed one i have none
[1:20:25] and one without science sketches has
[1:20:26] anyone with signs
[1:20:28] listen but
[1:20:30] i have predicted
[1:20:32] they had a submission rock that abrasive
[1:20:34] on the pillar supernatural was with them
[1:20:36] and so it has been all along and
[1:20:37] predicted as janice and jambres which
[1:20:40] stood moses so will this in the last day
[1:20:42] but listen to this prophecy now but i've
[1:20:44] got better hopes for you brethren here
[1:20:46] this morning that you will be men of god
[1:20:48] who will stay with the word of god and
[1:20:50] let everything else fall right to left
[1:20:53] but still right with that word
[1:20:55] don't move
[1:20:57] no matter if you are dormant out there
[1:20:59] be a good doormat
[1:21:01] and there's a part i like it don't try
[1:21:03] to compete with someone else or do this
[1:21:05] just stay right with the word
[1:21:07] stay right there and god will
[1:21:09] positionally place you into this kingdom
[1:21:11] i love that tell my wife we have no
[1:21:14] competition
[1:21:15] you know why we don't compete
[1:21:19] we don't come people know church we
[1:21:21] don't compete with our group we just do
[1:21:23] the best that we can
[1:21:25] in the spirit of excellence because we
[1:21:27] want to move on to perfection
[1:21:29] glory to god hallelujah so i am fighting
[1:21:32] no pastor fighting no church fighting
[1:21:34] not this and fighting all that we have a
[1:21:36] goal to hit
[1:21:40] devil laughing at church wars laughing
[1:21:42] at this past like in this past in the
[1:21:43] church against church they go laughing
[1:21:45] at that because they have nothing to do
[1:21:46] and you have to keep on keep on
[1:21:48] defending them keep on finding the
[1:21:49] flames of of coral and fussing and
[1:21:51] things like that
[1:21:52] and where is the manifestation of god
[1:21:56] coming onto christmas time three wise
[1:21:58] men come down to jerusalem where is he
[1:22:00] bunking the jews

[1:25:16] mechanics but one of them has dynamics
[1:25:18] you see you might know the mechanics but
[1:25:21] they take the dynamics to start off the
[1:25:23] mechanics
[1:25:24] to make them work oh glory to god
[1:25:27] where's the point having an executive
[1:25:28] car
[1:25:29] and you're pre-shining and they're
[1:25:30] shining and polish down or whatnot and
[1:25:32] when you say take me for a spin
[1:25:34] you say it can't start
[1:25:37] every day you're polishing a vacuum in
[1:25:39] there
[1:25:40] you put a new steering wheel you only
[1:25:42] have nothing shiny stuff and things like
[1:25:44] that
[1:25:45] it's well polished down everybody's
[1:25:47] taking pictures and posting by the car
[1:25:50] but the guy is not opposed
[1:25:52] opposite is taking one spot to the next
[1:25:53] part you're you're the nicest guy in the
[1:25:55] whole street and your car can't move
[1:26:04] i have a cannon
[1:26:06] dynamic
[1:26:07] it missed any battery
[1:26:09] so you push you push you can't start
[1:26:11] that
[1:26:13] you need dynamics
[1:26:15] to start it
[1:26:17] and a man looking for a real ride and
[1:26:19] i'm gonna order pick up
[1:26:22] i go over here
[1:26:25] because your nice car

[1:26:31] we are here to take pictures
[1:26:33] we have to get down the road down to the
[1:26:36] resurrection
[1:26:37] and they will take mechanics and
[1:26:38] dynamics to do that
[1:26:40] all glory to god we have this mystery
[1:26:42] that mystery that hidden mystery that
[1:26:44] machine on that machete side that
[1:26:45] machine on top the mastery in between

[1:30:08] doing
[1:30:09] oh hallelujah jesus was doing that you
[1:30:12] doing that too
[1:30:13] yes
[1:30:14] the same works i do
[1:30:16] shall you do also
[1:30:18] could we give the lord some praises
[1:30:21] this is what the devil don't want you to
[1:30:23] see
[1:30:24] come on and preach back to me
[1:30:26] the same works
[1:30:28] the same works
[1:30:30] you will do
[1:30:31] because god said so hallelujah
[1:30:36] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:30:38] glory
[1:30:40] thank you lord
[1:30:41] all right let's head to home stress here
[1:30:43] now the church should be he said okay
[1:30:45] looter
[1:30:46] martin luther had mechanics and dynamics
[1:30:48] john wesley had mechanical dynamics
[1:30:50] pentecost had them what about our day
[1:30:53] this is another time the church should
[1:30:55] be fully grown now ready to meet christ
[1:30:58] with the manifestation of every blessing
[1:31:00] he promised in the bible operating in
[1:31:02] that one great body where he promised he
[1:31:05] would meet them and be worshipped in his
[1:31:07] gracious of his
[1:31:08] oh my hallelujah
[1:31:11] thank you lord it's a word is a
[1:31:12] manifestation of a thought isn't that
[1:31:14] right first he taught it he spoke it
[1:31:16] then the word was made manifest and
[1:31:18] every word in the bible is god torts
[1:31:19] laid in seed form and if receiving that
[1:31:22] human being and spoke by the same
[1:31:24] thought that materialized the bible it
[1:31:26] brings things to pass
[1:31:28] isn't that right
[1:31:29] so therefore here we go are you ready
[1:31:31] he said let there be a world before the
[1:31:33] before it could be a word it had to be a
[1:31:35] thought
[1:31:36] so god and creation created the world by
[1:31:39] his thought first then spoke it
[1:31:42] so the creation was in his thinking
[1:31:46] and to break that to come to life he had
[1:31:48] was to speak it
[1:31:50] so the word become the expression of
[1:31:52] what one is mine
[1:31:54] let there be light
[1:31:55] let there be let there be literally oh
[1:31:57] my hallelujah praise god in him so
[1:32:00] here's bob now and if that same spirit
[1:32:03] that said that there'd be light and
[1:32:04] there was light let there be trees and
[1:32:05] there was trees if that's his mind that
[1:32:07] was in christ being you how much could
[1:32:09] it say let there be no cancer
[1:32:12] and it would be gone
[1:32:15] there's a weak amen boy this thing
[1:32:17] should be
[1:32:18] you should be busting the roof we should
[1:32:19] be repairing this roof next week
[1:32:21] that same spirit that same anointing
[1:32:24] let there be no cancer
[1:32:29] cancer going on
[1:32:31] [Music]
[1:32:32] let the blind eyes be open
[1:32:35] and it would be so
[1:32:37] glory to god and jesus says you shall
[1:32:39] say to this mountain and amen and
[1:32:41] believe in your heart what the things
[1:32:42] you say it shall come to pass
[1:32:45] you say what power has been given to the
[1:32:47] church
[1:32:48] no you can express it by mental
[1:32:50] conception
[1:32:52] that's humanistic
[1:32:54] as mental realm but
[1:32:56] if it becomes a real revelation of god
[1:32:59] then you see it before it happens
[1:33:02] that is divine revelation now
[1:33:04] oh glory to god because you see it
[1:33:06] before it happens
[1:33:08] so you break out of the humanistic realm
[1:33:10] you break out the mental fate and you're
[1:33:12] going to spiritual faith a rock
[1:33:14] revelation not a democrat movie after
[1:33:16] that
[1:33:18] oh glory to god
[1:33:21] like that old bomb the doctors finally
[1:33:23] said leaving me all you go there just no
[1:33:25] he said he said he's nobody i am
[1:33:26] somebody
[1:33:28] said a talk you're on the hospital bed
[1:33:30] he said if i was nobody jesus was going
[1:33:31] to die for me
[1:33:32] because i am somebody
[1:33:34] i'm trying to diss him and make him feel
[1:33:36] like he's a nobody's i am somebody
[1:33:38] because jesus died for me
[1:33:39] oh glory to god you can't do that you
[1:33:41] can't go there
[1:33:42] oh hallelujah isn't that right
[1:33:45] all right so watch if your heart
[1:33:48] and your mind is so in filled with god's
[1:33:51] spirit
[1:33:52] until your thoughts become historic
[1:33:54] there you are when your mind your
[1:33:56] leading your guidance becomes a direct
[1:33:58] place a direct inspiration of the holy
[1:34:01] spirit that's moving in your mortal
[1:34:02] being what kind of people should we be
[1:34:05] if the very holy spirit has you so
[1:34:08] embodied or empowered that you don't use
[1:34:10] your own thoughts you don't use your own
[1:34:11] mind you don't use your own opinion but
[1:34:13] the holy spirit has you so built until
[1:34:15] your thoughts your being is god's spirit
[1:34:18] expressionism through you
[1:34:20] what kind of church are we to be
[1:34:23] what kind of people ought to be to be
[1:34:24] this morning if this random tabernacle
[1:34:26] this morning was so filled with the
[1:34:28] presence of god notice what you're
[1:34:30] talking about filled everything not
[1:34:31] mysteries enough
[1:34:33] if this brand of tabernacle could be so
[1:34:35] clear with the person of god why when
[1:34:36] you didn't even use your own mind didn't
[1:34:38] even use your own thoughts didn't even
[1:34:39] have no alternative of your own just to
[1:34:41] be led by your spirit
[1:34:43] then he said this you know when the
[1:34:44] human element moves out
[1:34:48] and the spirit of god fills that vacancy
[1:34:51] see that is when you are willing to let
[1:34:52] go of your past let go of your fears let
[1:34:55] go of your failures you just let it go
[1:34:58] and let the spirit move in watch this
[1:35:01] and when you empty yourself and and then
[1:35:04] will be when the church is in its power
[1:35:06] of the resurrection of the lord jesus
[1:35:08] will walk in his steps in his power in
[1:35:10] his thoughts in his being in his moving
[1:35:13] you see what i mean then your thoughts
[1:35:15] will become words
[1:35:16] and words will become material that is
[1:35:18] when the church will be in its power
[1:35:20] so that's not human
[1:35:22] when they came in line in church with
[1:35:24] their money and all kind of stuff and
[1:35:25] peter's telling them you didn't lie to a
[1:35:26] man you lied to the holy ghost peter
[1:35:28] wasn't controlling that
[1:35:30] it was the spirit that was there it was
[1:35:32] the holy ghost that was there and that
[1:35:34] is going to return because the holy
[1:35:36] ghost will be back in the church
[1:35:38] in his people
[1:35:39] come on now
[1:35:41] so you cannot point peter and said he
[1:35:43] denied christ therefore he is not
[1:35:45] you don't go there
[1:35:46] because you could see a brother or
[1:35:47] sister and do whatever they did but you
[1:35:49] don't know when god do for them
[1:35:52] you know what a brother did last week
[1:35:53] but you didn't know what god did fame
[1:35:54] last night could somebody say amen
[1:35:57] human know what somebody did last week
[1:36:00] but you don't know what god did for them
[1:36:01] last night
[1:36:05] so they only begin to prophesy
[1:36:08] i believe
[1:36:09] it's on its road
[1:36:11] when the church will be so wrapped in
[1:36:13] christ
[1:36:14] the holy spirit mankind's away from
[1:36:16] themselves till they don't see
[1:36:18] themselves he said they taught but to
[1:36:20] serve god and their thoughts move on and
[1:36:22] they refuse the things of the world they
[1:36:25] move in the spirit live in the spirit
[1:36:27] walk in the spirit so fulfill the claws
[1:36:29] of christ then the love of christ in the
[1:36:32] human heart moving in the holy ghost
[1:36:34] that great wonderful church will go
[1:36:36] forth with power and deity here we go
[1:36:39] because deity will be revealed in the
[1:36:42] human beings by the holy spirit bringing
[1:36:45] to pass the thought of their mind
[1:36:49] now any man could speak a word
[1:36:51] but when the word is confirmed
[1:36:54] then you see god
[1:36:56] you see all these modern line prophets
[1:36:58] just want to fix the prophecy after they
[1:36:59] see it prophesy i lie
[1:37:01] and say could go so go say god showing
[1:37:02] me and it come to me and it never does
[1:37:05] it illusion it's always coming to them
[1:37:07] there's a lying demon coming to all of
[1:37:08] them
[1:37:10] do you feel what i'm saying but when a
[1:37:11] prophet speak he don't speak he came to
[1:37:13] me no and the word of the lord came unto
[1:37:14] elijah
[1:37:16] saying go tell ahab
[1:37:18] specific things and the word of lord
[1:37:20] came under jeremiah say go and do
[1:37:22] specific things
[1:37:24] oh glory to god and the word of lord
[1:37:25] came to us
[1:37:27] by a prophet
[1:37:28] oh glory to god hallelujah
[1:37:31] we have those say the lord because we
[1:37:33] heard from that elijah
[1:37:35] oh give the lord some praises
[1:37:37] [Music]
[1:37:38] [Applause]
[1:37:39] so then christ then
[1:37:41] becomes your makeup
[1:37:43] amen he's in full control then your
[1:37:46] torch will be clean your thoughts your
[1:37:48] heart will be clean isn't that right
[1:37:51] my god hallelujah praise god as a man
[1:37:54] think in his heart so it has to become a
[1:37:56] thought before it can become a word and
[1:37:59] the word express materializes i believe
[1:38:02] in my heart that i am a christian
[1:38:04] okay because i have accepted the lord
[1:38:06] jesus christ if i don't cry if i don't
[1:38:10] move if i don't do a thing in my heart
[1:38:12] first i believe that christ died for me
[1:38:14] in my stead i accept it as a christian i
[1:38:18] believe it as a christian then in my
[1:38:20] heart then i express it in a word i am a
[1:38:23] christian
[1:38:24] you have to say it
[1:38:25] you have to actually speak that i am a
[1:38:27] christian
[1:38:28] if you don't speak that then you do all
[1:38:29] kind of stuff because you're really not
[1:38:31] a christian
[1:38:32] you don't believe you're a christian but
[1:38:34] when you receive the word and you
[1:38:35] receive the lord you start to tell
[1:38:36] people i'm a christian when i go on my
[1:38:38] job i just like to tell people that
[1:38:39] because i tell them that and they will
[1:38:42] hold me accountable this will say and
[1:38:44] you say he's a christian
[1:38:46] so i used to put my testimony up front
[1:38:49] i'm a christian you know that means i'm
[1:38:50] not smoking i'm not drinking i'm not
[1:38:52] partying i'm not lying don't ask me to
[1:38:53] do something i'm a christian so you know
[1:38:55] up front what i am saying and i am
[1:38:59] but when you don't say that people play
[1:39:00] games because it's not people you know
[1:39:02] it's a spirit
[1:39:04] anointing them
[1:39:05] yes to see how much you could compromise
[1:39:07] yes because once you compromise you take
[1:39:09] your covenant off
[1:39:11] and your blessing fall off
[1:39:12] and it's not that god i want the
[1:39:13] blessing you know be covering over you
[1:39:15] he cannot be blessed and can't fall
[1:39:16] through that because you're compromising
[1:39:18] but when you put your testimony out i'm
[1:39:20] a christian your boss through demons
[1:39:22] powers
[1:39:23] oh glory to god you put your testimony
[1:39:26] on the line
[1:39:27] oh glory to god hallelujah
[1:39:29] so he's promised another comforter i'm
[1:39:31] going to finish
[1:39:32] how long are you going to be abide for
[1:39:33] you forever he said what is the word of
[1:39:36] god what is our comfort today is when we
[1:39:39] receive the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:39:42] and the power of the living god lives in
[1:39:44] us and with the word of the god living
[1:39:47] we stand that word is made flesh and
[1:39:49] well among us
[1:39:50] now that same word that was made flesh
[1:39:53] and well among us has become our flesh
[1:39:56] [Music]
[1:39:58] did you hear that
[1:39:59] we read it and the word became flesh
[1:40:01] that same word has become our flesh
[1:40:04] that same word living in you will
[1:40:06] produce the same thing that it did when
[1:40:07] it was made flesh because your flesh
[1:40:09] holds it
[1:40:11] your flesh
[1:40:13] holds it
[1:40:14] oh glory to god hallelujah
[1:40:17] so jesus was god tabernacle
[1:40:19] made flesh on the earth
[1:40:21] and the bible said and the word was
[1:40:24] invisible now listen close the word was
[1:40:26] invisible until it was made flesh
[1:40:29] and then the word become visible
[1:40:31] so what's the problem today
[1:40:33] with all these so-called boosters and
[1:40:35] claimers and whatnot oh my if the word
[1:40:38] become flesh it'll be invisible the
[1:40:40] invisible become visible
[1:40:41] and they say when omnipotent speaks
[1:40:44] the miraculous take place
[1:40:46] so god can be veiled alone only talking
[1:40:48] mysteries
[1:40:52] jesus
[1:40:53] when lazarus was sick he's telling me
[1:40:56] good not great lazarus dead he says
[1:40:58] sleep it i go with him
[1:41:01] what is jesus in
[1:41:02] the realm of vision

[1:41:35] and then the sister said even now
[1:41:39] now if she didn't say even no he
[1:41:41] couldn't go further you know
[1:41:43] even though true men are geared
[1:41:45] even now
[1:41:52] then he had to go i promise the man did

[1:41:56] resurrection and the light

[1:42:21] you laid him nice trouble
[1:42:23] that is trouble
[1:42:25] the human is sexy but lord is thinking
[1:42:28] does not do with it
[1:42:30] with man is impossible
[1:42:33] but really god
[1:42:34] could be given some praises
[1:42:37] things that are impossible with man
[1:42:39] it's possible with god
[1:42:41] where have you laid him
[1:42:43] oh glory to god i can't operate and i
[1:42:45] don't know where he is tell me where he
[1:42:46] is
[1:42:48] he's a roller with his stone
[1:42:50] if you have faith
[1:42:51] that i could change the situation
[1:42:53] whatever is blocking it up loose it
[1:42:57] roll it
[1:42:58] hallelujah your situation might be stink
[1:43:00] on the inside the stone that blocking it
[1:43:02] roll it what can the lord have praise
[1:43:05] off
[1:43:06] roll away that stone
[1:43:08] because deliverance is coming healing
[1:43:10] coming resurrection coming voice of the
[1:43:13] archangel coming roll away that stone of
[1:43:16] unbelief
[1:43:19] glory
[1:43:21] brother branham
[1:43:22] he said and through his sacrificial debt
[1:43:24] at calgary and his resurrection
[1:43:27] positionally places church
[1:43:29] in that realm
[1:43:31] that the same invisible god
[1:43:34] could come
[1:43:35] into the individual
[1:43:37] and make the word
[1:43:39] visible
[1:43:40] so don't tell me it cannot be done
[1:43:42] it can be done
[1:43:44] don't tell me this pastor and this
[1:43:46] church are doing that that's what i'm
[1:43:47] going to do with us
[1:43:48] oh glory to god we see the word
[1:43:50] of how we are to become
[1:43:52] what we have to line up with he said
[1:43:54] i've often wanted to come to a church
[1:43:56] i've longed to see it i guess where i
[1:43:58] could walk into the back door front or
[1:43:59] wherever and look across the audience
[1:44:01] see a perfect church see men and women
[1:44:03] sitting under the power of the holy
[1:44:05] spirit and the spirit of god moving
[1:44:07] perfectly moving this someone had done
[1:44:09] something wrong in the congregation they
[1:44:11] would confess it quickly that is the
[1:44:13] church of the living god oh my poor
[1:44:15] heart it's getting all i've longed to
[1:44:17] stand and see a church like that oh my
[1:44:20] and all that you are all that you ever
[1:44:22] will be is based upon faith in this
[1:44:24] world
[1:44:25] isn't that right
[1:44:26] so hear what that really is you know as
[1:44:28] we close museum coming please a change
[1:44:30] of the heart
[1:44:31] not of this physical thing but the heart
[1:44:33] of your soul
[1:44:34] that something anchors to your torch
[1:44:37] that his way is dull you don't see that
[1:44:38] no more you just see the lord jesus you
[1:44:41] see righteousness you see holiness you
[1:44:44] see purity and love and grace that is
[1:44:47] when you are changed
[1:44:48] and your torch your habits your being
[1:44:51] have been changed from a sinner to a
[1:44:53] christian first thing you know in your
[1:44:56] heart then you express it with your lips
[1:44:58] and then it materializes
[1:45:00] so then your words become weighted words
[1:45:02] you don't have to talk about gossip and
[1:45:03] old talk and lying and hearing back and
[1:45:05] island confusion no you want god taught
[1:45:08] when you speak you're speaking words
[1:45:10] words that could produce life
[1:45:12] now if you think
[1:45:14] of it
[1:45:15] and you imagine you think it and you
[1:45:17] express it and it doesn't materialize
[1:45:19] then you're on the wrong road
[1:45:21] you get it
[1:45:22] you if you imagine you're a christian
[1:45:24] you speak it with your lips but you find
[1:45:25] out that you're not you better get your
[1:45:27] thoughts changed
[1:45:28] get your heart changed because it
[1:45:30] doesn't be a record it doesn't be a
[1:45:32] fruit
[1:45:33] oh my you must say what you think
[1:45:36] not be a hypocrite that is where you're
[1:45:37] getting lined up now you stop being
[1:45:39] hypocritical you stop being dishonest
[1:45:42] whatever you speak is very sincere
[1:45:44] because they're getting now into
[1:45:45] speaking terms with god
[1:45:47] and they're coming to speak in terms
[1:45:49] that you could speak the word
[1:45:51] so you don't speak something that you
[1:45:52] really don't mean in your heart you have
[1:45:54] started practice speaking from your
[1:45:56] heart
[1:45:57] oh glory to god then you let that your
[1:46:00] thoughts be pure your expressions pure
[1:46:03] you live pure you be pure
[1:46:05] all right i'm i'm finishing here now
[1:46:08] christ is the word right
[1:46:10] god dwelt with us in flesh he was the
[1:46:13] word and before it's word it's a thought
[1:46:15] and a thought has to be created
[1:46:17] god taught here we go become creation
[1:46:21] when it was spoke by a word
[1:46:23] and when he presented to you as a
[1:46:25] thought is taught it's revealed to you
[1:46:28] divine revelation
[1:46:29] so you break past humanistic realm you
[1:46:32] break into divine revelation it's
[1:46:33] revealed to you but it's still a thought
[1:46:36] until you speak it
[1:46:38] oh you mean we really have to speak this
[1:46:40] thing yes
[1:46:42] hallelujah i am healed
[1:46:44] i am delivered
[1:46:45] i am free you have to speak it
[1:46:48] yes
[1:46:51] that is why moses will know to pray that
[1:46:53] pill of fire around him he said go hold
[1:46:55] your stick and say and call for flies
[1:46:57] there was no flies and he went out and
[1:46:59] said i said let there be flies
[1:47:01] so even though god no flies is the
[1:47:03] channel to terrorize pharaoh moves at
[1:47:05] the speak fit
[1:47:06] or flight flights they're coming oh
[1:47:08] glory to god to think about it the bride
[1:47:10] must prophesy again so you can express
[1:47:12] it by a mental conception but it becomes
[1:47:15] a real revelation of god that you see it
[1:47:18] before it happened
[1:47:19] and express it in the word form and that
[1:47:21] word takes a whole and become material
[1:47:24] a taught express there are three
[1:47:26] elements that a man follow it's
[1:47:27] humanistic
[1:47:28] second divine revelation to this vision
[1:47:31] you could play something verse even and
[1:47:32] then the third is vision is thus yet
[1:47:34] alone and the bride will love thus says
[1:47:36] the lord
[1:47:37] this service today was thus saith the
[1:47:39] lord
[1:47:42] because it's the word
[1:47:44] it's your word
[1:47:47] and you know i was challenged to preach
[1:47:48] this this morning i can't really say all
[1:47:50] the way the holy spirit you know deal
[1:47:51] with me to bring this message
[1:47:53] but i guess just as i was challenged you
[1:47:55] will be challenged also
[1:47:57] to believe that this word has to come
[1:47:59] into your flesh
[1:48:02] liquor jacob
[1:48:04] jacob was a deceiver
[1:48:06] he was a trickster because he wasn't
[1:48:08] converted
[1:48:09] it was his nature
[1:48:11] but his gene was of god
[1:48:13] his attribute was of god and so much
[1:48:15] that before he was born he said jacob i
[1:48:17] love you so i hid
[1:48:18] because he saw it wasn't jacob
[1:48:20] but yet that same jacob had to hold on
[1:48:23] and wrestle
[1:48:24] until he was changed
[1:48:26] and to show he was changed he was
[1:48:28] walking different
[1:48:30] he's walking with a limp because the
[1:48:32] injured touches time
[1:48:34] he angel if he didn't hold on he was
[1:48:36] going to get that change
[1:48:38] he said i will not let you go till you
[1:48:39] bless me
[1:48:40] something happens on the inside
[1:48:42] friends it's not good to just sit there
