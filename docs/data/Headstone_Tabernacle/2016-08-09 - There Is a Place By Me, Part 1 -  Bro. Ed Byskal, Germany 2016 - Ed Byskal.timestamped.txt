[28:07] very short testimony with you something
[28:09] that I saw where I live in Pennsylvania
[28:12] and made such an impression on
[28:15] me uh there was this uh fellow in the
[28:18] next town I live in a very rural area a
[28:23] lot of
[28:24] Countryside and there's a lot of uh of
[28:27] the pl people that came from Germany the
[28:30] menites and the Amish and so forth and
[28:34] uh it's it's a
[28:36] very uh very Christian area where I live
[28:40] there's over 600 different types of
[28:43] churches and a lot of uh Christians of
[28:47] varying uh
[28:48] types and uh there was this fellow his
[28:51] barn burned
[28:53] down and one afternoon and Into the
[28:57] Night night and I was uh up the road at
[29:01] this company uh I had to pick up some
[29:03] supplies and the shipping guy was
[29:05] telling me how this F's Barn burned down
[29:09] and I could still see smoke so when I
[29:11] left there I drove past where the barn
[29:14] had burned and what I saw absolutely
[29:17] blew my mind there were probably a
[29:21] hundred different men there of all
[29:25] different types different types of Amish
[29:28] and different menites and different
[29:31] Christians like Baptists and so forth
[29:35] they were all came together there were
[29:37] horses and Buggies there there were
[29:39] trucks and cars uh some people came on
[29:43] bicycles and on foot and they all came
[29:46] to help their friend their brother they
[29:49] didn't care what church he went to that
[29:52] didn't matter their friend was in
[29:55] need and they all pitched in and then
[29:58] the old the sisters up there I seen them
[30:00] with their little bonnets they laid out
[30:02] tables and they had food and and drink
[30:05] this is 9:00 in the
[30:08] morning and hundreds of people came to
[30:11] help their friend out I sat in the car
[30:14] and
[30:15] wept I said when is the Bride of Jesus
[30:19] Christ going to be like that when oh God
[30:23] when will we forget about what church we
[30:25] go to and love our brother

[36:17] impact of this Supernatural element
[36:20] about the healing of his wife he just
[36:22] opened his mouth it just came out flew
[36:25] out of him
[36:27] because he was in that
[36:29] channel and this channel is not
[36:31] something we have to work
[36:32] up this channel is very
[36:36] simple very simple sister had you right
[36:39] she didn't have to work up anything it

[36:48] healed
[36:49] me holy spirit will do the work always
[36:52] will do the
[36:53] work and how he prophet prophesied under
[36:57] this impact and how by prayer this
[37:00] Supernatural element this God this wheel
[37:03] in the middle of the wheel
[37:05] how it made a becklen son run in his
[37:10] pajama in his car drove to the church
[37:13] and gave his life back to God what what
[37:16] prayer what prayer to assist
[37:18] God what prayer does that's why I invite
[37:22] especially the ministers in the morning
[37:25] from 8 to 9: : CL in this prayer room
[37:29] let us pray for our young people God
[37:32] hears prayer if he makes one man run
[37:35] because it this prayer was
[37:38] spoken how he will deliver the our our
[37:45] children I feel it's important there's
[37:48] no Revival without
[37:50] prayer and Brother Chan con made it
[37:53] clear said if the word doesn't Unite
[37:56] with the spirit in our lives there's no
[37:57] power no dynamic in our life to live the
[38:00] life of Jesus Christ how we need this
[38:02] holy fire to burn our personal demons
[38:05] out he made it clear it's not enough to
[38:09] know the message we need the same fire
[38:13] and only God can give it to us and it
[38:16] comes sometimes in a way we don't
[38:20] expect second day this morning brother
[38:23] Isaac overit one taken one left we have
[38:27] to know this was new for me I mean I
[38:31] understand astronauts have to be there
[38:33] have to be
[38:35] trained but to hear it so clear we have
[38:38] to have to practice the same condition
[38:42] here on Earth before before we have it
[38:45] up there we have to be in the same
[38:49] condition that means you just obey the
[38:52] word whatever the word says if the word
[38:54] says you love your enemy you just love
[38:56] him because you love Jesus and you love
[38:58] to do what he says you don't think even
[39:00] about it you just love him and God likes
[39:04] it because it's the way he how he shows
[39:06] his
[39:07] children we Al so we are very thankful
[39:10] for this morning message also to brother
[39:12] Isaac brother Isaac God bless you where
[39:14] are you
[39:17] at where is
[39:20] he okay whever is God May bless his
[39:25] ministry that was direct to my heart
[39:29] also we have to
[39:31] practice it's not said we have to work
[39:34] up but you have to do what the voice
[39:37] says what the word says because you love
[39:40] him you can only do it if you love Jesus
[39:43] yourself you cannot you cannot achieve
[39:45] it but if you love him you will just do
[39:48] what he says if he says this do this do
[39:53] this you don't think yourself you just
[39:56] committed you just surrendered this is
[39:59] this is this is all just surrender to
[40:02] him and then he comes and do the work so
[40:06] we have found that pearl of great price
[40:09] that lost coin who is this that's he
[40:14] himself it's he himself he said I am I
[40:18] will be in
[40:19] you it's him personally how do I know
[40:22] who is
[40:24] he he is
[40:26] experienced by his Nature by his
[40:30] attributes you can experience him if you
[40:33] follow his word these attributes will
[40:35] unfold in your life and will you take
[40:38] over it's very easy but by love it comes
[40:40] by
[40:42] love so in this afternoon i' I'm finish

[42:32] the times when he was together with a
[42:34] prophet that God has sent at the end of
[42:37] this Gentile dispensation to prepare a
[42:39] bride to prepare you and to prepare me

[47:38] onor Toco I wonder brother Timothy are
[47:40] you here could you stand
[47:43] please at the back God bless you brother
[47:52] Timothy I mention these uh these IND
[47:56] individuals because uh each one of them
[47:59] have contributed to my
[48:02] life uh some are younger and some are
[48:06] about my age but I've learned some
[48:11] things and our brother Timothy onoko he
[48:14] perhaps doesn't realize but I've
[48:16] observed their lives I had opportunity
[48:19] to observe their
[48:21] lives uh brother Murphy Wong uh he was
[48:24] doing trans ating of the
[48:26] Chinese during a live messages while
[48:30] service was going on in our church in
[48:34] Cloverdale and I would come out after a
[48:38] preaching you'd feel such an unction
[48:41] such an anointing and such a I don't
[48:44] know such a presence of God and I would
[48:46] come in to my little study and that's
[48:51] where we had the computer set up at that
[48:53] time we didn't have another room for
[48:55] brother Murphy to be translating to the
[48:58] Chinese and I would I would see him on
[49:01] his
[49:03] knees and I would see his car in the
[49:06] parking lot when I
[49:09] left and I would see his car when I came
[49:12] back in the
[49:14] morning this not this didn't happen once
[49:18] but this happened several
[49:20] times and I said brother
[49:22] Murphy did you go home last night
[49:26] uh and he just put his head down no no
[49:29] no I I I was very
[49:31] affected by the
[49:34] message sometimes hearing uh the prophet
[49:37] of God or a local
[49:40] Ministry uh I like to see people I learn
[49:44] something from that I
[49:47] say that is uh that means a great deal
[49:51] to me not because uh I had participated
[49:55] in in the meeting but because I see a
[49:58] tenderness towards the spirit of God and
[50:02] uh brother Coen Bruner has asked if I
[50:04] would give some testimony and
[50:07] witness
[50:08] uh perhaps more on Friday Friday evening
[50:12] I would like to speak today if I
[50:15] may
[50:17] um but you learn something as you you
[50:20] pick up things as you journey and God
[50:23] allows certain people to meet your life
[50:26] I want you to listen very very carefully
[50:29] today if you wouldn't mind because we
[50:33] are we are all journeying towards our
[50:37] anticipated
[50:39] destination of a rapture we speak much
[50:43] about the
[50:44] Rapture uh we anticipate the Rapture
[50:48] this is why we're here this is why we
[50:51] this is why we live this is why we uh
[50:55] seek the message this desire to live the
[50:59] message I would like to have you note
[51:03] that in the
[51:05] scriptures Jesus sometimes would speak
[51:07] to the
[51:09] multitudes there were other times when
[51:12] he purposely would take the
[51:16] 12 and the Bible says the 12 and then
[51:19] there are other
[51:21] times and we cannot question why but
[51:24] there were other times
[51:26] he would take three Peter James and John
[51:30] and they were
[51:32] times when perhaps he had something that
[51:35] he was especially wishing to
[51:38] convey it was Peter James and John that
[51:42] went up on Mount Transfiguration the
[51:44] multitude didn't go up the 70 were not
[51:47] invited but the three were invited and
[51:51] Peter speaks of that again how they uh
[51:54] heard and saw in the Holy Mount and that
[51:59] is where also the prophet of God all of
[52:01] these Generations later would get uh the
[52:05] the text for his message hear ye him
[52:08] because that was what the voice said
[52:11] hear ye him but there was not multitudes
[52:15] there not that we are opposed to
[52:18] multitudes we're very happy but
[52:20] sometimes and I'm saying these words
[52:22] with a purpose sometimes God will select
[52:25] someone within the within the multitude
[52:29] and speak to them in a special way and I
[52:32] would ask you to prepare your
[52:34] heart uh and and uh just say God I've
[52:39] come here to hear from you cause cause a
[52:43] man of God cause a minister cause
[52:45] someone to say something that is certain
[52:48] words that I personally need to hear I
[52:52] want to hear your voice I want to hear
[52:55] you you speak and I I believe that that
[52:58] is very
[52:59] important just to be perfectly honest
[53:03] with you uh in in a testimony of things
[53:06] that times that I was with brother
[53:10] brandham I cannot speak of them
[53:13] lightly I cannot speak of them
[53:16] flippantly I cannot just speak of them
[53:18] as something I read in a book is is
[53:22] sometimes the things that you
[53:24] experienced and they are so
[53:27] sacred so
[53:30] sacred not because I make them sacred
[53:33] but we speak about the pillar of fire
[53:36] and I had an occasion to be in the car
[53:41] with the prophet of God on one occasion
[53:44] and I just want to tell you that it
[53:46] takes a special atmosphere in a service
[53:51] for me to even speak about it because it
[53:55] it was just that
[53:58] Holy that sacred and uh I would ask you
[54:02] to be in prayer if you are in prayer and
[54:07] that God may allow
[54:10] that how many here have seen the film
[54:14] deep calls to the
[54:16] Deep may I see your
[54:21] hands you know there are things that are
[54:24] I'm I'm an obser OB ver and I just
[54:26] observe things observe
[54:29] people I've I observed brother brandham
[54:33] we didn't I did not know he was who he
[54:37] was at the first indication at the first
[54:40] time but it didn't take long and he took
[54:44] me to Malachi
[54:46] 4 and uh spoke about the great and
[54:50] terrible day of the Lord but if you see
[54:54] the film what you have the woman is
[54:56] standing on this
[54:58] side and she you'll notice the next time
[55:01] if you have not noticed it you can
[55:03] notice it the next time she reaches out
[55:06] and puts her hand on the corner of the
[55:09] pull
[55:10] pit to steady
[55:12] herself and he is standing here and he
[55:16] said that's all
[55:18] right that won't hurt you that's him not
[55:24] me
[55:25] and friends I can tell you that presence
[55:29] that presence is so sacred and so holy
[55:32] if you were to stand in it you might
[55:34] wonder if you're even going to
[55:36] live that's the kind of presence it is
[55:41] it is just so sacred and so holy I can't
[55:45] that is why the prophet said uh every
[55:48] time he comes he hears those same words
[55:51] he knows the voice fear not
[55:55] fear
[55:56] not that's why those things just think
[55:59] that the Eternal God is saying to a
[56:02] human fear not because these are very
[56:06] precious times and if if we are now in
[56:09] this Gathering such as we are and he
[56:12] comes to you personally you will thank
[56:15] him throughout Eternity for that moment
[56:18] that the that a that a atmosphere was
[56:21] created where God and man could meet
[56:25] together God and a daughter of God can
[56:29] meet together my brother my sister and
[56:32] you young people that are here let me
[56:35] tell you as one that is your senior and
[56:38] your Elder elder brother I will tell you
[56:41] it is the most gracious and the most
[56:43] wonderful gift that God can give to a
[56:47] person I was about 27 when I first uh
[56:51] took brother brandham on uh on his rest
[56:54] on a hunt uh we took I'll tell you more
[56:59] about that later but
[57:02] uh I had so many deep questions
[57:05] spiritual questions I saw the
[57:09] decline of uh the Pentecostal movement
[57:12] and believe me the Pentecostal movement
[57:15] I really questioned whether I would say
[57:16] anything about this you talk about
[57:19] praise and you talk about worship I sat
[57:22] in a service and saw perhaps as many
[57:25] people are are here in a large building
[57:28] in Edmonton
[57:30] Alberta and I was sitting towards the
[57:33] back and uh and someone came to the
[57:37] piano and began to just play lost in the
[57:40] spirit they didn't know nothing about
[57:41] the
[57:42] piano and they would play the piano for
[57:45] maybe a half an hour or an hour and the
[57:48] people would rise and and wave and just
[57:52] like the ocean and and sing and sing in
[57:56] the spirit and we knew it was we knew it
[57:59] was
[58:00] Supernatural absolutely Supernatural
[58:03] they weren't even choruses or songs that
[58:06] were were known but they just sang and
[58:08] it sound so Angelic I wasn't just a
[58:12] child I was I was in my teens at that
[58:15] time I was a teenager if you're a
[58:17] teenager was here I didn't come to
[58:20] church to hear somebody preach we came
[58:23] to church to see what go God was going
[58:25] to do because there were always things
[58:28] that were happening things that were
[58:30] being things that were taking place and
[58:33] that's why we came to church and in this
[58:35] one meeting I will never forget it you
[58:38] might think I'm exaggerating it is
[58:40] absolutely the truth on this side I was
[58:43] sitting on this side and about on this
[58:46] side it was a narrower building than
[58:48] this but a long long building and about
[58:51] half of that audience stood up on this
[58:53] side and they cried out in one voice in
[58:57] One
[58:59] Voice open up ye gates and let the king
[59:03] of glory come in and they sat down in
[59:06] this side rose up and said in one voice
[59:09] who is this king of glory and the other
[59:12] side rose up and said the Lord of hosts
[59:15] he is the king of
[59:18] glory don't tell me it wasn't
[59:21] God don't tell me that that wasn't God
[59:25] that's the only only way that could
[59:26] happen that wasn't orchestrated no one
[59:30] uh no one anticipated it happening and
[59:33] on on my arm the ha hair just stood up
[59:37] on my arm you might be saying how dides
[59:39] that happen I don't know how it happened
[59:41] I was there and that's exactly what
[59:44] happened but I want to tell you
[59:47] friends I don't know any in that in that
[59:51] audience that took the word when it came
[59:55] so they didn't have a word to Anchor
[59:57] them and we have a lot to Rejoice
[1:00:01] about because we have received a message
[1:00:04] but I only tell you this to help you to
[1:00:09] appreciate what the message cost and the
[1:00:13] message did not come easy the message
[1:00:16] came at Great cost and the men whose
[1:00:19] names I just called I have seen God in
[1:00:22] their lives I have seen men of
[1:00:25] sacrifice and you will have
[1:00:28] opportunity the Lord willing to
[1:00:30] see uh a Chinese Bible that has been
[1:00:34] spoken about some have heard about it
[1:00:36] then some have saw it in in Switzerland
[1:00:40] we brought uh perhaps 50 or 60 or 70 in
[1:00:44] Chinese you might say well why would you
[1:00:46] bring Chinese to this somebody knows
[1:00:48] someone who is Chinese and I bought one
[1:00:51] I I bought one and and gave it to one of
[1:00:55] my Chinese friends and I have another
[1:00:57] one that I want to give and do you know
[1:01:00] that China one billion 1 billion 300
[1:01:05] million people and more more than that
[1:01:08] they're
[1:01:09] increasing that's an incredible amount 1
[1:01:12] billion 300 million people and yet they
[1:01:16] did not have an accurate Bible the
[1:01:20] reason why I speak about this Bible H it
[1:01:23] it it
[1:01:25] uh Believers of this message began to
[1:01:30] discover errors in the King James
[1:01:33] version they said the prophet is saying
[1:01:35] this but it's not in our Bible that
[1:01:38] isn't what it says and and for a number
[1:01:41] of years and then it they kept a diary
[1:01:44] of it and it be began to build up and we
[1:01:47] said well how can how can we sit by and
[1:01:51] see this kind of uh uh problem in the
[1:01:55] Chinese Bible and a brother came into my
[1:01:58] office one day and said we don't have a
[1:02:01] King James version of the Bible I
[1:02:04] thought well you must have I went on the
[1:02:06] internet and I saw that there were many
[1:02:09] but there the translations were not only
[1:02:12] very poor they missed many scriptures
[1:02:15] and they had many words that were
[1:02:19] Incorrect and I mentioned brother Murphy
[1:02:22] Wong from beginning
[1:02:25] to the finish of the Bible was 18
[1:02:29] years and that brother started the
[1:02:31] brother sitting right in the back
[1:02:33] started with Genesis
[1:02:35] 1:1 and went through to the amen of
[1:02:39] Revelation it took five years five long
[1:02:43] years and I can tell you friends to have
[1:02:46] a friend that's dedicated that dedicated
[1:02:50] I am impressed with that kind of
[1:02:52] dedication and I say thanks be to
[1:02:55] God that we of the message are able to
[1:02:59] provide the Chinese speaking people with
[1:03:03] an accurate Bible one that the prophet
[1:03:06] of God would not be ashamed of because
[1:03:09] it is the same is what he preached from
[1:03:12] and I say praise be to
[1:03:14] God thank you for your
[1:03:20] time there's also another scripture I'd
[1:03:23] like to leave with you just before we
[1:03:26] read
[1:03:26] scripture and that is Jesus we've we
[1:03:30] hear a great deal about the Holy Ghost
[1:03:32] but Jesus hear his words after that the
[1:03:37] Holy Ghost has come upon you you he said
[1:03:41] one thing you shall be Witnesses unto
[1:03:47] me is that not what he
[1:03:49] said ye shall be Witnesses unto me and
[1:03:54] he
[1:03:58] said both in
[1:04:01] Jerusalem and in
[1:04:03] Judea and in
[1:04:06] Samaria and unto the uttermost part of
[1:04:09] the earth
[1:04:10] period that's the end of his statement
[1:04:14] some went to Jerusalem some perhaps went
[1:04:17] to
[1:04:17] Samaria some went to
[1:04:20] Judea some went to other places and to
[1:04:24] the uttermost part of the earth this to
[1:04:27] me is the gospel that I'm interested in
[1:04:30] taking this message that we have
[1:04:34] received you brothers from various
[1:04:37] places and ministers especially should
[1:04:40] be gripped with a
[1:04:43] passion a passion of the Prophet here he
[1:04:47] flew we didn't have jets in his time and
[1:04:50] he flew with prop uh propeller driven
[1:04:53] planes
[1:04:55] uh and into mosm Beek and into South
[1:04:58] Africa and up into uh Zimbabwe I guess
[1:05:03] and different places I don't know all
[1:05:06] the places way into the far north of
[1:05:09] Canada and we just learned from our
[1:05:11] brother George Smith who was here my
[1:05:13] wife was always wanting to know his
[1:05:16] first visit there and it was
[1:05:18] 1949 in September
[1:05:21] 1949 it wasn't simple it was was N Easy
[1:05:24] driving it was a very primitive at that
[1:05:27] time and uh this was the kind and when
[1:05:30] that Prophet speaks about rugged
[1:05:32] Believers that's what we want to be
[1:05:35] praise be to God we're here to preach a
[1:05:38] rugged gospel Hallelujah and we believe
[1:05:42] it with all of our hearts
[1:05:45] amen if you wish to stand with me I'll
[1:05:49] read some
[1:05:53] scripture
[1:05:55] I'd like to read out
[1:06:00] of just give me a moment
[1:06:16] here I want to read out of Exodus the 3
[1:06:23] chapter
[1:06:27] we'll begin reading at the second
[1:06:34] verse and the angel of the Lord appeared
[1:06:37] unto him in a flame of
[1:06:40] fire out of the midst of a bush and he
[1:06:44] looked and behold the bush burned with
[1:06:46] fire and the Bush was not
[1:06:50] consumed and Moses said I will now turn
[1:06:53] aside and see this great sight why the
[1:06:56] bush is not
[1:06:58] burnt and when the Lord saw that he
[1:07:02] turned aside to
[1:07:04] see God called unto him out of the midst
[1:07:07] of the Bush and said Moses Moses and he
[1:07:11] said here am I and he said draw not nigh
[1:07:16] hither put off thy shoes from off thy
[1:07:19] feet for the place whereon thou standest
[1:07:23] is Holy G ground moreover he said I am
[1:07:27] the god of the thy father the god of
[1:07:30] Abraham the god of Isaac and the god of
[1:07:34] Jacob and Moses hid his face for he was
[1:07:37] afraid to look upon god let's bow our
[1:07:41] heads
[1:07:42] please dear heavenly

[1:10:17] people in Jesus Christ's name amen and
[1:10:21] may everyone say amen amen am amen you
[1:10:24] may be
[1:10:35] seated I want to take uh some moments to
[1:10:39] speak to you
[1:10:41] please on uh there is a place by
[1:10:47] me
[1:10:48] Moses and then we will go from
[1:10:51] Moses uh into the into the
[1:10:56] message but there is a place by me every
[1:10:59] one of us you have gathered this is not
[1:11:03] where you
[1:11:05] live on this
[1:11:07] Hillside in this Campground so you came
[1:11:11] from some place you came from your
[1:11:15] village your town your country you
[1:11:18] perhaps flew took an aircraft as we did
[1:11:22] and others have done so and we moved
[1:11:25] from one place to another place there
[1:11:28] was a purpose and a reason for that and
[1:11:31] now Moses as Moses knew what it was to
[1:11:35] be in the Palaces of of Egypt and to
[1:11:38] walk on those Rich carpet grounds he
[1:11:42] knew what it was as a military hero to
[1:11:45] ride in a chariot and to to come into
[1:11:49] the uh the voices of the thousands of
[1:11:53] people people and he knew what it was to
[1:11:55] receive honor and Glory of man and now
[1:12:00] because of uh a very unfortunate thing
[1:12:03] in his life he murdered a man and you
[1:12:06] perhaps now you want to be serious you
[1:12:08] may not care for him as a as your leader
[1:12:13] but he's the one that God had called and
[1:12:16] God doesn't change his mind do you
[1:12:19] understand can you say Amen to that amen
[1:12:23] and that's that's that's our God that's
[1:12:25] his nature and and Moses had slain a man
[1:12:28] and hid him and ended up being a
[1:12:31] vagabond Prophet out in the wilderness
[1:12:34] and caring for some flocks or whatever
[1:12:38] some cattle and while he's there uh a
[1:12:42] bush is on fire he's attracted to this
[1:12:45] bush and he goes and he's and hears a
[1:12:50] voice out of the Bush the prophet of God
[1:12:52] said what Moses was lacking the the the
[1:12:56] pillar of fire had the pillar of fire
[1:13:00] had what he was lacking and I can tell
[1:13:02] you today whatever we lack or whatever
[1:13:05] we have need of I can tell you that
[1:13:08] there that the pillar of fire is has the
[1:13:12] has the presence of God that you crave
[1:13:14] for has uh whatever it is you desire or
[1:13:17] need the pillar of fire has what the
[1:13:20] body of Christ needs
[1:13:25] and so he's moved from one place to
[1:13:27] another but the voice s speaks to him
[1:13:30] and says remove your shoes or put off
[1:13:34] your shoes from off your feet for the
[1:13:38] place whereon thou standest friends that
[1:13:42] place was not holy Moses didn't take
[1:13:45] anyone else back there there wasn't
[1:13:48] anything sacred about that spot but it
[1:13:51] was sacred at that moment at that time
[1:13:55] because God was going to meet with a man
[1:13:58] at that point and now this is a this is
[1:14:00] a different kind of a place now you have
[1:14:04] come here to this
[1:14:08] Auditorium and this place can become a
[1:14:11] special
[1:14:12] place uh this place can become a special
[1:14:16] place uh I don't think there's anything
[1:14:18] special about the construction of this
[1:14:21] building but a place becomes very very
[1:14:24] special when God meets
[1:14:28] man now I can tell you that I as a young
[1:14:31] man I'd been a minister for 20 for seven
[1:14:34] years been preaching for seven years and
[1:14:38] I saw things within uh within the church
[1:14:42] world at the time I don't mean
[1:14:44] denominational world we did not believe
[1:14:46] in
[1:14:47] denominations we had a background of uh
[1:14:50] of the Scandinavian belief and which is
[1:14:54] uh uh which is one that each church is
[1:14:57] Sovereign and that's what we believed
[1:14:59] back then each church was Sovereign and
[1:15:02] we did not believe in a hierarchy we did
[1:15:05] not believe in general overseers or
[1:15:07] Bishops we believed that the church and
[1:15:10] so it was a it was to me it was the
[1:15:13] highest quality of of Christianity
[1:15:17] available and I was a minister uh uh
[1:15:20] under in within that group of Fellowship
[1:15:23] of churches we had one little church in
[1:15:27] the far north of British Columbia in
[1:15:29] Dawson Creek where my wife who was here
[1:15:32] was born in that City in that
[1:15:35] town and uh that's where the Alaskan
[1:15:38] Highway begins I'm sorry I meant to
[1:15:40] bring I had a large map and I was going
[1:15:43] to put it up so you could see if it's a
[1:15:45] very large map and about 5 foot tall and
[1:15:48] you could see the area because it's
[1:15:51] important to see that uh even when the
[1:15:54] prophet of God um drove all the way up
[1:15:57] there he drove there all the way from
[1:15:59] Jeffersonville and it was it was a long
[1:16:03] long journey and yet he would come up to
[1:16:06] that place and uh I didn't know who he
[1:16:09] was except I had been in his meetings
[1:16:13] and uh I I I had seen a girl which I
[1:16:16] will tell you about at another occasion
[1:16:19] I saw a a blind girl healed and I was in
[1:16:23] about the third row on this side sitting
[1:16:26] on the aisle and uh and the platform was
[1:16:30] higher than this one and brother Brandon
[1:16:33] prayed a prayer I have never heard
[1:16:35] before but he prayed he prayed for her
[1:16:39] and uh nothing and he looked at her and
[1:16:41] nothing changed he prayed the second
[1:16:44] time and the third time and the fourth
[1:16:46] time and the fifth time and the sixth
[1:16:49] time and I was counting I was a 14y
[1:16:53] years old I was counting and I thought
[1:16:56] like all the other ministers when it's
[1:16:59] something that's inside wonderful
[1:17:01] healings take place but when it's
[1:17:03] something that I can see with my own
[1:17:06] eyes nothing's happening and this girl's
[1:17:09] eyes were just white just white balls
[1:17:12] was all that could be seen and then
[1:17:16] uh he just put his arms around her head
[1:17:19] she was about 10 12 years old ringlets
[1:17:23] down to her shoulders and he put his
[1:17:26] arms around her head like this and he
[1:17:30] just held her like that and he said
[1:17:34] Satan an angel from God ministered this
[1:17:38] gift to me and told me that if I could
[1:17:41] get the people to believe nothing would
[1:17:43] stand before my prayers not even cancer
[1:17:47] I adure you in the name of the Living
[1:17:49] God loose her and let her go and that
[1:17:53] time he did not look at her he just
[1:17:54] turned took her by the shoulders and
[1:17:56] turned her this way and I was looking
[1:17:59] straight at her her eyes were straight
[1:18:01] as mine I tell you then the people went
[1:18:04] into wild ecstasy and began to praise
[1:18:07] and thank God and the little girl is
[1:18:09] looking up at the lights because the
[1:18:11] lights were bright and brother brandom
[1:18:13] lifted her up and she's looking at the
[1:18:15] lights and I could even see the tears
[1:18:17] form in her eyes as as she looked at the
[1:18:21] light she was not accustomed to it
[1:18:23] and uh and of course the people were
[1:18:25] filled with Ecstasy but the thing that
[1:18:28] happened something lodged in my heart
[1:18:31] and I thought now I've I've never heard
[1:18:34] I've never seen a man that spoke to
[1:18:37] Angels before here's a man that is I've
[1:18:41] heard now has spoken to Angels here's a
[1:18:43] man that God hears here's a man that the
[1:18:47] supernatural happens and and it was just
[1:18:50] quietly he just prayed a simple prayer
[1:18:53] and it was done I tell you what friends
[1:18:55] the power of God was very very present
[1:18:59] and and that lodged in my heart for
[1:19:01] years so that was still in my heart when
[1:19:05] uh when I A A Rancher friend of mine
[1:19:09] called Bud Southwick whose names now uh
[1:19:12] you have seen many times in the message
[1:19:15] but brother brandom didn't know brother
[1:19:16] Bud Southwick he was a close friend of
[1:19:19] mine because he was just a Rancher and I
[1:19:21] would go up to his place and back and
[1:19:24] forth and he would come and sell some
[1:19:26] cattle and stay in our home and this one
[1:19:29] night he was in our home and another
[1:19:32] another Minister was there who had
[1:19:34] preached in my church and he he uh he
[1:19:37] said this brother Southwick was saying
[1:19:40] brother bud I always call him brother
[1:19:42] Bud he said uh he said uh the the game
[1:19:47] department the uh Department that is in
[1:19:52] charge of harvesting the animals he said
[1:19:56] they're wanting to give me a large
[1:19:57] territory up on the Alaskan Highway and
[1:20:00] I just I didn't even take it serious I
[1:20:02] thought well butd is just becoming
[1:20:04] established as a Rancher he's got a
[1:20:07] maybe 200 head of cattle and horses and
[1:20:10] he's got five little sons and a wife and
[1:20:14] certainly he's not going to go up there
[1:20:16] because he's just starting to get
[1:20:18] himself established and the next thing I
[1:20:21] knew he had he got sold his farm I guess
[1:20:24] it was or sold his Ranch and went way up
[1:20:27] on the Alaskan Highway and I was I was
[1:20:30] literally speechless that he would do
[1:20:33] that and I thought I hope that's not a
[1:20:35] big mistake but we let this this man
[1:20:38] this Minister who who whose name is also
[1:20:41] in brother branham's messages aw
[1:20:44] rasmason was in my home that night and
[1:20:47] that was the only time he was in my home
[1:20:50] and he said you know brother Bisal he
[1:20:51] said you you should write you should
[1:20:54] invite brother brandom he said you know
[1:20:56] he loves to hunt you know and uh I I I I
[1:21:01] thought
[1:21:02] well brother Brandon probably receives a
[1:21:05] 100,000 letters a month he would never
[1:21:09] find my letter anyway but I recall
[1:21:11] sitting down at a big old oak desk and I
[1:21:15] wrote a with a pencil in paper I wrote
[1:21:18] an invitation to brother brandham to
[1:21:20] come and we didn't hear anything I
[1:21:22] didn't get an answer for a year and a
[1:21:24] half and I didn't expect an answer I
[1:21:26] just thought this will get lost in all
[1:21:29] of his mail but instead and during that
[1:21:32] year and a half I resigned the church
[1:21:34] where I was and we moved about and I
[1:21:37] went to the native Indian people of
[1:21:39] Canada and uh settled my family in a in
[1:21:43] a small city called Victoria which is
[1:21:45] our capital of British Columbia and uh
[1:21:49] uh it was it we were only three weeks
[1:21:53] there and I got a letter from Billy Paul
[1:21:56] saying that his father would like to go
[1:21:58] on a hunt and suggested a certain time
[1:22:01] in May and uh uh so I I was so surprised
[1:22:06] and delighted and then brother brandom
[1:22:08] and I made some communication I can't
[1:22:10] remember all the communications but I've
[1:22:12] kept every letter from him and every
[1:22:14] letter from Billy Paul still have it in
[1:22:17] a file in my home and just recently I
[1:22:19] showed it to some of our young men
[1:22:22] because
[1:22:23] uh I I kept them because some of the
[1:22:26] things that the prophet of God just said
[1:22:28] were very very personal very very
[1:22:31] precious he wrote me one letter just one
[1:22:34] week after his mother passed away and
[1:22:37] I've always held that very very dear I
[1:22:39] thought that he would take time to write
[1:22:42] me a letter a personal letter one month
[1:22:45] one week after his mother had passed
[1:22:48] away and you can read in the message how
[1:22:51] he appreciated the people that gathered
[1:22:53] around him and the people that went to
[1:22:56] the hospital and stood with his mother
[1:22:59] and and the brother sthan and different
[1:23:01] ones and he so appreciated and and the
[1:23:03] flowers and he talked about it in one of
[1:23:06] the messages which I didn't pull up just
[1:23:08] now but he was so appreciative and he he
[1:23:12] thanked them so much and then to find
[1:23:14] that he had time to write me a letter I
[1:23:17] was humbled by that I was very humbled
[1:23:20] by that and then one letter he he he
[1:23:25] just said brother Eddie you'll never
[1:23:26] know what your friendship has meant to
[1:23:28] me and I was very humbled I didn't even
[1:23:31] want to show that letter and I I
[1:23:34] hesitated even mentioning it now I don't
[1:23:36] want it to be
[1:23:38] misunderstood but that was
[1:23:41] uh just one of the things that I felt if
[1:23:45] if we were able to give him a rest and
[1:23:48] friends I was like the shunamite
[1:23:51] woman I wish you'd had the
[1:23:55] opportunity I didn't expect anything in
[1:23:59] return but to get his friendship in
[1:24:02] return means more than even this
[1:24:05] Gathering here to
[1:24:07] me just to have that kind of
[1:24:11] Association that kind of friendship and
[1:24:14] to be able to
[1:24:15] observe friends I hope you understand
[1:24:19] this I I got a window into to
[1:24:23] Eternity I watched I watched that man I
[1:24:27] watched him when a wild horse is trying
[1:24:30] to actually kill brother
[1:24:33] Southwick and I said to brother brandham
[1:24:35] he was standing right beside me I said
[1:24:37] brother brandham I said that that horse
[1:24:39] is going to injure going to hurt uh
[1:24:43] brother Southwick and he said yeah he's
[1:24:45] uh he he's mean isn't he I said yes he
[1:24:48] is and he this was the second day and
[1:24:51] brother Sou W who knew horses he was a
[1:24:54] Horseman and he knew and he thought he
[1:24:56] would break his break his will this
[1:24:58] horse would break the will and and he
[1:25:01] was trying to put a pack saddle on him
[1:25:04] and it wasn't possible are you
[1:25:05] interested in this do you want to hear
[1:25:09] this I turned around and I just saw him
[1:25:13] slipping his hat on his head he just had
[1:25:16] a few words with
[1:25:18] Father our father I hope it's your
[1:25:21] father
[1:25:25] and that horse his nature was changed
[1:25:28] from that moment I'm a man of the
[1:25:31] Wilderness I'm telling you the truth
[1:25:34] that animal's nature was
[1:25:36] changed changed became like a kitten we
[1:25:40] packed that horse every day that horse
[1:25:43] treated was treated like every other
[1:25:45] animal and it was just his nature was
[1:25:48] what kind of a God have we got we got a
[1:25:51] God who gives a horse a force nature who
[1:25:54] gives a dog a dog nature gives an animal
[1:25:56] an animal nature gives a human a human
[1:25:59] nature and he knows how to change our
[1:26:02] nature he knows how to make us
[1:26:04] Christlike and friends when I hear about
[1:26:07] us becoming like Christ I realize
[1:26:09] because I've seen it I've seen this
[1:26:11] message I've seen this messenger do that
[1:26:15] and and and animal changed in in an
[1:26:18] instant of time who can do that nobody
[1:26:21] but God who created
[1:26:24] him and I tell you the truth that animal
[1:26:28] changed completely that very day and
[1:26:32] became just mild a wonderful wonderful
[1:26:36] horse for the rest of that Journey which
[1:26:39] was about 10
[1:26:40] days do you believe
[1:26:43] [Applause]
[1:26:48] it I'm talking about a living God I'm
[1:26:51] talking talking about a God I have seen
[1:26:54] change this isn't just words this is
[1:26:57] something that takes place I've seen
[1:27:00] them change humans I've seen them change
[1:27:02] drunkards I've seen them change my
[1:27:07] father
[1:27:09] Hallelujah and I'm ready to give glory
[1:27:12] to God because we don't serve a dead God
[1:27:15] we serve a living God
[1:27:19] hallelujah hallelujah and this message
[1:27:22] is a living message amen do you believe
[1:27:26] what I'm saying I've been asked to give
[1:27:28] a witness and I want to be a true
[1:27:30] witness of a True Vine for Jesus Christ
[1:27:34] is the vine and any time it will Sprout
[1:27:37] another another Branch it'll be a
[1:27:40] Pentecost listen friends this is nothing
[1:27:43] different than happened in Pentecost men
[1:27:45] and women were changed people who
[1:27:48] couldn't write their names were changed
[1:27:51] Hallelujah
[1:27:52] and nothing is nothing is different

[1:28:07] Hallelujah Glory
[1:28:16] Hall
[1:28:19] amen I'm just thinking because some
[1:28:21] things I can say in some things perhaps
[1:28:23] I cannot say I don't want to be
[1:28:27] misunderstood I tell you friends these
[1:28:29] are precious
[1:28:31] moments and you have come here because
[1:28:34] you claim to follow a message that God
[1:28:39] used this vessel and this was a prepared
[1:28:42] vessel and I spoke on the first service
[1:28:45] on of uh a body hast thou prepared me my
[1:28:50] brother my sister I had much more to say
[1:28:52] because we are the body of Jesus Christ
[1:28:57] and we will not reach a Rapture without
[1:29:00] the full preparation we don't have to
[1:29:03] prepare ourselves so much even though
[1:29:05] the bride has prepared herself but but
[1:29:08] God has designed things for
[1:29:11] us and fact is want you to hear me now
[1:29:15] very clear and especially you that are
[1:29:17] young people and I see young men and
[1:29:20] young women
[1:29:23] in this
[1:29:25] message in this message it's more than
[1:29:27] just a phrase we're not in the message
[1:29:30] so much as we need to have the message
[1:29:32] in
[1:29:34] us hallelujah the word of God abiding in
[1:29:40] US
[1:29:42] Amen in Jesus prayer in John 17 he
[1:29:46] speaks of his disciples and those that
[1:29:48] have believed on him and he said thine
[1:29:51] they where and thou gavest me them think
[1:29:56] of that that was something they didn't
[1:29:58] even know that is something that we
[1:30:00] might know mentally but we know in our
[1:30:05] in our very being that we belong to
[1:30:09] Christ and God has given us to this
[1:30:13] message before the foundation of the
[1:30:15] world he gave us to this message you
[1:30:18] might have said you accepted it he
[1:30:21] accepted you he called you he sent a
[1:30:25] word that would fit you and to bring you
[1:30:28] from where you were he wanted you in
[1:30:30] another
[1:30:31] [Applause]
[1:30:33] place Jesus
[1:30:35] walked where they were
[1:30:37] fishing and there were there were men
[1:30:41] who had been born into
[1:30:43] families there was John and Andrew and
[1:30:47] Peter and James and these men that were
[1:30:51] fishermen
[1:30:52] and they were with two of them were with
[1:30:54] their father and that's the place they
[1:30:56] were whether it was a dock at the lake I
[1:30:59] don't know I've been to the I've been to
[1:31:02] that place uh near that place in uh in
[1:31:05] uh Israel and that's where they were but
[1:31:09] somehow now here came the master here
[1:31:12] came the Creator here came the
[1:31:16] Masterpiece
[1:31:18] Hallelujah and he needs him in another
[1:31:20] place not where they're fishermen but he
[1:31:24] needs him in another place he knows what
[1:31:27] he's going to do he knows the words that
[1:31:29] he's going to speak and he's got to have
[1:31:31] some Faithful Men Who will be true
[1:31:34] Witnesses of the Lord Jesus Christ at
[1:31:37] that time and listen to me my friends
[1:31:40] I'm I'm thankful that I have the energy
[1:31:43] and the time and the health that God has
[1:31:45] given to allow me to be one more time
[1:31:48] here and what I give you today or what I
[1:31:51] speak in the Services is a true witness
[1:31:54] of the True Vine for Jesus Christ is the
[1:31:57] vine and he's the one he's the one who
[1:32:00] changes the nature of a horse he's the
[1:32:03] one who saw what was in my heart and I
[1:32:06] thought oh God how can we be in such a
[1:32:09] church how can we have such a message as
[1:32:12] we have not the message of the hour but
[1:32:15] we had a message as well and we were
[1:32:18] spreading the gospel and we were
[1:32:20] preaching we had I know what it is to
[1:32:23] come behind a Pulpit and the Holy Spirit
[1:32:26] come down and to I've collapsed over the
[1:32:29] pulpit and wept till the end of the
[1:32:31] service I know what it is to experience
[1:32:34] those things we've seen those things and
[1:32:37] we've seen lives changed and but that
[1:32:40] wasn't when the word came neither of my
[1:32:43] deacons took
[1:32:44] it my two deacons didn't take it I
[1:32:48] couldn't hardly believe it they were
[1:32:49] like brothers in the flesh
[1:32:52] and that's where we learned what
[1:32:54] separation
[1:32:58] was sometimes very dear
[1:33:00] people family I had one sister and then
[1:33:06] a a a half sister my father remarried
[1:33:09] after my mother
[1:33:12] died as I said the other night I was six
[1:33:15] and a half years old stood at her coffin
[1:33:19] I'm not telling you this to have a tear
[1:33:21] service I'm telling this because it's
[1:33:23] the truth those were not easy days and
[1:33:27] that was not a a
[1:33:31] self-imposed
[1:33:36] sacrifice I'm going to stay with this
[1:33:38] till you understand
[1:33:40] it
[1:33:42] Jesus had a great life of
[1:33:45] sacrifice and he called men and also
[1:33:49] women attended to his needs but he
[1:33:52] called men that were prepared to
[1:33:54] sacrifice and when I read the scripture
[1:33:57] after that the Holy Ghost has come upon
[1:33:59] you after that the Holy Ghost come he
[1:34:02] says one thing you shall be
[1:34:04] Witnesses in Jerusalem in Samaria in
[1:34:09] Judea and into the uttermost part of the
[1:34:12] earth it's not just living a life some
[1:34:14] of you young people may be going to
[1:34:16] further education I'm going to unload my
[1:34:18] burden now is that all right brother
[1:34:20] Coen Bruner
[1:34:22] I'm going to unload my burden it it is
[1:34:24] not the holy spirit will come upon you
[1:34:27] to make you a a better professional
[1:34:29] person or to give you a better job or to
[1:34:33] give you a higher a higher education or
[1:34:37] to give you better skills that's not the
[1:34:40] point the Holy Ghost comes upon us to
[1:34:43] make us
[1:34:44] Witnesses Liv living Witnesses whatever
[1:34:48] form that takes in your life but it will
[1:34:51] call for some sacrifice and I can tell
[1:34:54] you it calls for sacrifice listen to me
[1:34:57] back there it calls for sacrifice and
[1:35:00] some are
[1:35:02] self-imposed people have said no I will
[1:35:05] I'll turn aside from that and I'm going
[1:35:08] to give my life this way now comes an
[1:35:18] opportunity do you know what friends
[1:35:24] you're looking for a
[1:35:26] Rapture and as long as there's one yet
[1:35:29] to left to get one left as long as

[1:36:03] upon it as a great honor that God has
[1:36:06] given us a great honor to take the
[1:36:08] message into a country of 90 million
[1:36:12] that have never been exposed to the
[1:36:14] message and here we are end time

[1:38:34] passion furthermore I'm not ashamed to
[1:38:37] say I'm filled with the Holy Ghost

[1:40:09] testimony of Jesus
[1:40:12] Christ people talk about my age I I
[1:40:15] don't only feel about maybe 50 years old
[1:40:18] and and and what sacrifice what
[1:40:21] sacrifice there is no sacrifice
[1:40:23] everything's an honor everything's a
[1:40:27] privilege you people whether you're from
[1:40:30] Germany whether you're from Africa
[1:40:33] whether you're from another place I
[1:40:35] desire that you'll be there a different
[1:40:38] person burning
[1:40:41] inside like Jeremiah tried to keep it
[1:40:44] silent because it was going to make
[1:40:46] enemies for him it was going to make
[1:40:48] division for him it was going to cause
[1:40:51] people to leave him and he tried to
[1:40:53] close up his mouth but he said it burned
[1:40:56] in his
[1:40:57] bones that's the God we serve Hallelujah
[1:41:02] that's the god of reality the god of
[1:41:04] Elijah the god of elishah the god of
[1:41:08] Jeremiah the god of the prophets that's
[1:41:10] our God he's the god of Abraham the god
[1:41:14] of Isaac and the god of Jacob and the
[1:41:17] first thing he says to Abraham he says
[1:41:20] leave thy Kindred leave thy country
[1:41:24] leave thy I'm not asking you to leave it
[1:41:26] I'm just saying we must be willing to do
[1:41:29] whatever it takes we have one we have
[1:41:32] one call in this age we have one call as
[1:41:37] Believers of the message and that is to
[1:41:40] get the message to every hungry
[1:41:44] person education must not get in the way
[1:41:49] our profession must not get in the way
[1:41:52] use it as a tool to further the gospel
[1:41:56] but whatever you do that's the life I
[1:41:59] believe I believe it with all my
[1:42:02] soul my wife and my daughter are sitting
[1:42:05] there sitting right behind our brother
[1:42:08] and my eldest daughter and they they

[1:47:18] and to move them down to Grand Prairie
[1:47:20] Alberta there about 60 70 miles maybe
[1:47:23] 100 kilomet down the
[1:47:26] road brother Tim you'll forgive me but
[1:47:30] I I feel a need to say
[1:47:33] this and I was
[1:47:36] Desiring I needed somebody because of my
[1:47:39] age because of the future somebody has
[1:47:42] to take this great work and our own
[1:47:45] congregation which is several hundred
[1:47:47] people but they don't realize there's
[1:47:49] more people out outside than there is
[1:47:52] inside there's a bigger congregation
[1:47:54] outside and they need to they need the
[1:47:57] message and they need help and they need
[1:47:59] whether it's song books or whatever
[1:48:02] whatever we just want to be a an aid to
[1:48:05] help
[1:48:09] them we started in a
[1:48:12] house we started with a few
[1:48:16] people and then when there were too many
[1:48:18] in the house we built a log church but
[1:48:22] in the log Church there was a young man
[1:48:24] hello young man he was just out of high
[1:48:28] school big tall fellow about 6'
[1:48:32] five and he was a genius up here he
[1:48:36] could work around with a with a he would
[1:48:40] be a a a computer geek you know he was a
[1:48:44] techy guy and but I I see everything
[1:48:47] Through The Eyes of the message said we
[1:48:50] need that kind of people we need people
[1:48:53] who are really smart people who can do
[1:48:56] things I can never do and I said these
[1:48:59] tapes they're very poor and they need
[1:49:03] and I know brother Brandon was burdened
[1:49:05] about them and they need to be cleaned
[1:49:08] and we need to start to filter them he
[1:49:10] said he stuttered a little bit he said I
[1:49:13] I can do it will we'll get this kind of
[1:49:15] a machine that kind of a machine we'll
[1:49:17] get this scope and we'll I'll listen to
[1:49:20] every tape for four years he listened to
[1:49:23] tapes and as he listened he made a Diary
[1:49:27] of a certain sound that came in at so
[1:49:30] many feet of the tape and a and a kind
[1:49:33] of howling sound or a whistle or
[1:49:36] something and then it would end and he
[1:49:38] would get the the the the the tone of it
[1:49:42] and get the exact uh amount of it and
[1:49:46] then he would get the filters and filter
[1:49:49] that side sound out if it was possible
[1:49:52] it was air conditioning we couldn't do
[1:49:54] it because it went across the whole tape
[1:49:56] but for 4 years he did
[1:49:59] 530
[1:50:01] tapes
[1:50:03] 530 do you know
[1:50:05] why you brothers from
[1:50:09] Africa do you know why do you know what
[1:50:11] motivated me I sat with
[1:50:15] Brothers I sat with
[1:50:19] Brothers
[1:50:22] and they sat across from me and their
[1:50:25] dark eyes looking at my he said we can't
[1:50:29] understand the tapes are so noisy I just
[1:50:33] decided in my heart something has to be
[1:50:36] done we couldn't find a way we didn't
[1:50:39] have the money we didn't have the people
[1:50:42] but if it if you have
[1:50:44] action if you're ready and
[1:50:46] burden God Will Make A Way
[1:50:50] and God Made A Way and many that taped
[1:50:54] you here today were cleaned up in a
[1:50:56] little room by one boy out of high
[1:50:59] school
[1:51:01] Hallelujah does God know how to do
[1:51:03] things he knows exactly how to do
[1:51:08] things and we began we began to make
[1:51:11] libraries and we made libraries I
[1:51:14] thought if I could get some other
[1:51:15] churches we made libraries and we sent
[1:51:18] them out and different people uh brother
[1:51:21] Henry green who's passed away now in
[1:51:24] North Carolina brother Henry green made
[1:51:27] about 16 copies and sent them down into
[1:51:31] uh down into I can't say Trinidad but
[1:51:33] down into that that part of your of the
[1:51:37] Central America and he sent 16 copies of
[1:51:41] the of the libraries down there and then
[1:51:44] one day we got a phone call from Brother
[1:51:46] Joseph Bram and he wanted to purchase
[1:51:49] the equipment and the duplicating
[1:51:51] equipment we had very fine equipment I
[1:51:54] always believed this message calls for
[1:51:57] the
[1:51:58] best and if the best is in Germany we'll
[1:52:01] get it from Germany if it's in the
[1:52:03] United States we'll get in the United
[1:52:05] States this message deserves the best
[1:52:09] and when you see that Chinese Bible it's
[1:52:11] on India paper and it's gold leaf on the
[1:52:14] outside and it's beautiful leather
[1:52:17] because it God's word deserves the
[1:52:21] best we don't waste it but I believe it
[1:52:24] deserves the best and Brother Joseph
[1:52:27] picked up the duplicating equipment and
[1:52:29] carried on we had done 530 and I believe
[1:52:32] he's done all uh uh 1100 of them I don't
[1:52:36] know his his program exactly but I'm so
[1:52:39] glad that there they put on the the vgr
[1:52:43] the V whatever you want to call it
[1:52:46] distribute books all over the
[1:52:48] world tapes all over the world and puts
[1:52:52] it on the
[1:52:53] internet
[1:52:55] Hallelujah and
[1:52:57] furthermore I said this voice this voice
[1:53:00] of this Prophet needs to go on the
[1:53:03] internet and before people were thinking
[1:53:06] about putting voice on the internet we
[1:53:09] went to a large uh University in
[1:53:12] Vancouver has 30,000 students and they
[1:53:15] have gone into business and their
[1:53:17] business is uh is uh being they have
[1:53:20] large workstations or large uh uh
[1:53:25] repositories where they keep libraries
[1:53:27] for for telephone companies and so on
[1:53:31] excuse me I'll get up here where you can
[1:53:32] see me and then uh we we'll put these
[1:53:35] out there and we went and had a meeting
[1:53:37] with them will you put this library on
[1:53:41] on on the internet for us yes they will
[1:53:43] do so they gave us a price we said do it
[1:53:46] and and shortly brother bram's voice was
[1:53:48] on the internet and many others since
[1:53:51] then have had it on the internet I don't
[1:53:54] care what other people do I say do all
[1:53:56] you can put in any language you can
[1:54:00] Hallelujah if somebody steps up here and
[1:54:02] says I can I can I translate into the
[1:54:05] Ethiopian language we'll be right behind
[1:54:08] you we'll say God bless you we don't
[1:54:10] believe in any competition we believe in
[1:54:13] getting this word out can you say Amen
[1:54:16] we don't believe in competition we say
[1:54:18] God bless you
[1:54:20] you do all you can do it as fast as you
[1:54:23] can and do it as good as you
[1:54:29] can
[1:54:36] Hallelujah I don't have to ask you if
[1:54:38] you see what my first love is that's my
[1:54:42] first love because the
[1:54:46] message and the person of Jesus Christ
[1:54:50] to me are
[1:54:53] synonymous do you understand what
[1:54:55] synonymous is the same the same the
[1:55:00] message the life you speak of the life
[1:55:02] of the message the life of the message
[1:55:04] is Jesus Christ revealed in you and to
[1:55:09] you that's the life of the message
[1:55:12] that's what I believe and that's what I
[1:55:14] believe the next person needs they need
[1:55:16] to hear it whether they accept it or
[1:55:19] whether they rejected they still need to
[1:55:21] hear
[1:55:25] it Hallelujah I'm listening to
[1:55:36] you am thank
[1:55:48] you
[1:55:55] you forgive me I'll try to tell you this
[1:56:00] now I pastored in a
[1:56:03] church I was in that
[1:56:06] place I have a lovely wife and three
[1:56:10] daughters and I'd be in the home I'd be
[1:56:13] in that place with them and I was caring
[1:56:17] for I was working
[1:56:20] at a
[1:56:23] job things are coming to me that perhaps
[1:56:26] I shouldn't
[1:56:27] say but I came to work one
[1:56:31] morning in a furniture
[1:56:34] store furniture store I used to own when
[1:56:37] it was just a junk place and I sold it
[1:56:39] to these two men two businessmen
[1:56:42] Luther and we would talk about
[1:56:45] Luther we would talk about the uh what
[1:56:49] history stood
[1:56:50] for and
[1:56:53] now the two of them and myself three are
[1:56:56] standing there first thing in the
[1:56:59] morning and they said we had a visit
[1:57:01] last
[1:57:02] night from the local Catholic
[1:57:07] priest and uh my father spent his
[1:57:12] inheritance which is very
[1:57:15] small but he he PR reprinted tracks
[1:57:20] of converted nuns and converted priests
[1:57:24] and he he put all the pamphlets in a in
[1:57:26] a
[1:57:29] package and they delivered the packages
[1:57:32] he and two or three other people
[1:57:34] delivered the package to
[1:57:36] every household in that City now about
[1:57:41] 10 12,000
[1:57:43] people then they delivered it to the
[1:57:47] countryside to the Farms that put put it
[1:57:49] in the
[1:57:50] mailboxes and they took it to a town
[1:57:52] north which I will mention brother Bram
[1:57:55] spoke under the pillar of fire and he
[1:57:57] mentioned Fort St John was a man was
[1:58:01] dying there with
[1:58:02] cancer and then and they delivered it to
[1:58:05] every home in Fort St John are you
[1:58:07] listening
[1:58:10] friends and they said
[1:58:13] until as long as Ed bcll is in your
[1:58:17] store we have two 2,000 2,000 Catholics
[1:58:22] in this city and they will not buy
[1:58:26] anything from your store they will not
[1:58:28] patronize your store as long as Ed bcll
[1:58:31] is there and the one man spoke up very
[1:58:34] fine man and very good friend of mine he
[1:58:38] said well Ed bcll didn't send those out
[1:58:41] it was his father Fred bisc he said it

[1:58:47] doesn't make any difference as long as
[1:58:48] he is there there there will be no
[1:58:51] Catholic that will purchase from your
[1:58:53] store listen to me friends I'm not
[1:58:56] talking about the Dark Ages I'm talking
[1:58:58] about my life amen I'm talking about my
[1:59:02] food for my table I'm talking about my
[1:59:05] children which my daughters here that's
[1:59:08] what I'm talking about we we're talking
[1:59:10] about a current gospel but there was a
[1:59:13] power
[1:59:14] inside I said I may not agree with how
[1:59:18] my father did it
[1:59:20] but I will not I do not disagree with
[1:59:23] what is written on those tracks and so
[1:59:26] be it you will not have to fire me I
[1:59:28] will willingly leave and I left did I
[1:59:31] have a job no I didn't have a job did I
[1:59:34] have a paycheck no I didn't have a
[1:59:36] paycheck did I have anything did I have
[1:59:39] any reserve no I didn't have any reserve
[1:59:42] it's God's
[1:59:45] business and I knew God didn't want me
[1:59:47] to cower under that under that power I
[1:59:52] said no was a sacrifice That's What I
[1:59:55] Call self-imposed
[2:00:02] sacrifice did I consider a big sacrifice
[2:00:05] no I really
[2:00:08] didn't said it over here is brother Tim
[2:00:11] Dodd he had another kind of
[2:00:15] sacrifice and that was God allowed
[2:00:19] God imposed he's a young
[2:00:23] man his wife is beautiful young
[2:00:26] woman they have eight
[2:00:30] children and he gets up on Sunday
[2:00:32] morning and he's just showering to
[2:00:35] preach and he thought I'll just leave my
[2:00:37] wife to rest for a little bit and she'
[2:00:41] had a couple dizzy
[2:00:44] spells and God had heard when he
[2:00:47] prayed and this time time when he comes
[2:00:51] out of this shower his wife is sitting
[2:00:53] on the edge of the
[2:00:56] bed and Keels over backward and is
[2:01:02] gone that fast is gone and he began to
[2:01:07] pray and God spoke to
[2:01:09] him excuse me brother
[2:01:13] Tim God said not this
[2:01:17] time to have good
[2:01:20] God tell you not this
[2:01:23] time last time he prayed God answered to
[2:01:28] prayer did what he asked him to do this
[2:01:32] time his wife is laying up breath is
[2:01:35] gone and God saying not this
[2:01:40] time that man is sitting right over
[2:01:43] here you'll see him on
[2:01:46] Friday he's the one who went to Uganda
[2:01:50] he's the one who said to brother
[2:01:52] bus why don't you take your honeymoon he
[2:01:54] took their wedding why don't you take
[2:01:56] your honeymoon in Ethiopia and they went
[2:01:58] up to Ethiopia that's how the gospel got
[2:02:01] to
[2:02:03] Ethiopia but if he stayed pastoring his
[2:02:07] church if he stayed there and he could
[2:02:10] have stayed but he
[2:02:13] realized I can't stay without my
[2:02:15] wife I need to have my wife
[2:02:21] as a wife of a
[2:02:25] pastor had to go to church and tell them
[2:02:29] sister Allison's
[2:02:31] gone they were just with
[2:02:36] her young
[2:02:39] ladies that's a god
[2:02:42] imposed
[2:02:44] sacrifice but if it wasn't for that
[2:02:47] sacrifice he wouldn't have gone to
[2:02:49] Uganda if it wasn't for that sacrifice
[2:02:52] he wouldn't be working night and day all
[2:02:57] over the world answering emails people
[2:03:00] that send them emails can you help me
[2:03:02] with this can you help me with that and
[2:03:04] we're there anything that we can do we
[2:03:07] seek to do
[2:03:09] it I just took my phone off just before
[2:03:13] I came to the meeting a brother from
[2:03:15] Mala has written a pastor and he has a a
[2:03:19] major thing he wants me to phone him and
[2:03:21] I'm speaking to another Pastor from
[2:03:26] Boston United States in Massachusetts
[2:03:29] and he's setting up a meeting once a
[2:03:30] meeting and two weeks after we arrive
[2:03:33] home from here I tell you my brother my
[2:03:36] sister I don't know maybe he's in maybe
[2:03:39] it's one in
[2:03:41] Ethiopia I think they need to hear it
[2:03:43] don't you agree with me they have a
[2:03:46] right to hear it don't they they have a
[2:03:48] right to hear it let me see some of you
[2:03:51] still people they have a right to hear
[2:03:53] it do they
[2:03:56] not and so it's up to God and some lived
[2:04:00] and the prophet spoke about in the
[2:04:03] church ages he spoke about some that
[2:04:06] give up their lives by dying because
[2:04:10] they would not
[2:04:13] Bend they would not bow and they would
[2:04:16] not
[2:04:17] burn that's the kind of people of Bride
[2:04:20] of Jesus Christ is That's What I Call
[2:04:22] rugged
[2:04:25] Christianity and the message makes
[2:04:27] rugged Christians not some flimsy little
[2:04:31] here today gone tomorrow up today down

[2:06:51] was comfortable with the congregation I
[2:06:54] had I loved I had I was loved and dearly
[2:06:58] loved to
[2:07:00] deacons and our people and we were at
[2:07:04] each other's home all the
[2:07:06] time but there was something inside that
[2:07:09] was
[2:07:13] gwing something was troubl I was
[2:07:16] troubled deep inside
[2:07:20] and my friends I have to be honest with
[2:07:23] you I've sensed that
[2:07:28] here some of you are got a heavy
[2:07:32] heaviness in your
[2:07:34] heart that heaviness is saying to you in
[2:07:37] a quiet voice something's
[2:07:44] missing something's missing yeah we can
[2:07:48] sing and we can rejoice and we can shout
[2:07:52] hallelujah but something's
[2:07:55] missing amen and we had the best quality
[2:07:58] of of the Gospel it was the people that
[2:08:02] received the
[2:08:03] prophet at that time they are the people
[2:08:06] that received the prophet our church and
[2:08:08] many many others of the same Fellowship
[2:08:11] of churches we received the prophet of
[2:08:13] God we're the ones that sat and filled
[2:08:16] up the
[2:08:17] meeting and drove many
[2:08:20] miles to listen to William
[2:08:23] brandham but when start coming past the
[2:08:25] second poll first poll and second pole
[2:08:29] and people begin to fall
[2:08:31] off and I knew of other great ministers
[2:08:34] I had been in the meetings of Tommy
[2:08:36] osbor and Tommy Hicks and or Roberts and
[2:08:40] then there was uh brother Gardner and
[2:08:44] and all kinds of great Ministries o
[2:08:49] Jaggers and on and on and I sat in
[2:08:53] meetings and heard these men preach some
[2:08:55] of them and it was powerful and Tommy
[2:08:58] Osborne had just come back from
[2:09:00] Argentina and filled up the largest Bull
[2:09:03] stadium in the world
[2:09:05] 500,000 people and showed a film of it
[2:09:09] in Edmonton I've been in those kind of
[2:09:11] meetings but
[2:09:13] friends you can kick me out of here
[2:09:16] tonight or tomorrow if you wish
[2:09:18] something was
[2:09:20] missing something was
[2:09:24] missing and I had a brother-in-law my
[2:09:26] brother-in-law's brother was in
[2:09:29] Cuba during their Civil War when Castor
[2:09:32] was just coming to power I'm not giving
[2:09:35] you history I'm giving you
[2:09:38] gospel and he was a man of very few
[2:09:40] words I remember it like it happened
[2:09:43] earlier today and we're carrying a plank
[2:09:46] between us and he he said did you hear
[2:09:49] what William brandham is teaching
[2:09:52] now I said no I said because my heart
[2:09:56] was so heavy I just was happy to be
[2:09:59] buried far in the north part of
[2:10:02] Canada we didn't care what was happening
[2:10:05] in the outside world I was trying to
[2:10:08] stay
[2:10:09] as pure and as close to God as I could
[2:10:13] but something was missing you know what
[2:10:15] was really
[2:10:16] missing I had some people baptized I
[2:10:19] didn't know exactly how to baptize
[2:10:22] them I'd been baptized in the name of
[2:10:24] father son Holy Ghost the titles my wife
[2:10:27] had been baptized in the
[2:10:29] titles well we didn't know any different
[2:10:32] we didn't have any absolute we didn't
[2:10:34] have any answers and I wasn't sure what
[2:10:37] the godhead
[2:10:38] was one of the brothers that was really
[2:10:41] a father to me he thought it's just
[2:10:45] two and many others thought it was three
[2:10:49] and anyone who thought it was one was
[2:10:50] called Jesus
[2:10:52] only and I didn't
[2:10:54] know I've been preaching seven years my
[2:10:57] friend seven years and I didn't know
[2:11:00] these fundamentals was something
[2:11:03] missing
[2:11:05] yes you know who
[2:11:10] knew he
[2:11:13] knew he
[2:11:14] knew and I so wanted to talk to brother
[2:11:17] brandham and his was the first time we
[2:11:20] went
[2:11:21] out brother caps I know this will mean
[2:11:24] something to you it's our first
[2:11:28] time I want to talk to him so bad I want
[2:11:32] but I didn't want I respected his time
[2:11:35] and respected his rest and I wanted
[2:11:38] above all things to give him a rest to
[2:11:40] his mind I didn't know all the doctrine
[2:11:44] or all the things I didn't know any
[2:11:46] about anything about it and I didn't
[2:11:48] want to get entangled with
[2:11:52] politics not that he would entangle me
[2:11:54] in politics but I just didn't I just
[2:11:57] didn't want to raise any question that
[2:11:59] would cause him any distress just have a
[2:12:02] peaceful hunt
[2:12:04] arrest
[2:12:06] friend you from
[2:12:08] Switzerland you have a beautiful
[2:12:11] country we have a similar
[2:12:16] country hello
[2:12:20] magnificent mountains soaring into the
[2:12:24] hills into the into the
[2:12:27] sky but you know what its beauty is it's
[2:12:31] rugged there's no
[2:12:33] roads there's no
[2:12:35] Villages there's no pasture land there's
[2:12:39] no sheep grazing tame sheep there's no
[2:12:42] there's nothing there it's rugged and
[2:12:44] it's the way God made
[2:12:47] it and the prophet of God loved that
[2:12:50] country and went back there every year
[2:12:52] except his last year
[2:12:55] 65 and so we were in the midst of that
[2:12:58] Country
[2:12:59] Flowers God planted them
[2:13:03] grass
[2:13:05] trees water from the glaciers it was
[2:13:09] just magnificent I've looked at flowers
[2:13:12] and just wept for their beauty CU God
[2:13:16] had it it was God's Garden
[2:13:18] and it was a rugged uninhabited place
[2:13:21] you could go hundreds of kilometers
[2:13:24] North hundreds of kilometers South you'd
[2:13:27] never run into a man or a vehicle there
[2:13:30] was no sounds no horns no Sirens no
[2:13:34] electric lights everything was rugged
[2:13:37] the way God made it and I want to talk
[2:13:40] with brother Bram but he went with the
[2:13:43] brother Southwick and I went with a
[2:13:45] Trapper from our church brother Chris
[2:13:48] Berg a very close friend small
[2:13:53] man and this evening after we have
[2:13:57] finished eating I was going to do
[2:14:02] dishes and the reason we went we didn't
[2:14:04] have many people we just wanted to do it
[2:14:07] ourselves and brother brandom said I
[2:14:10] think I'll just go maybe get a rabbit or
[2:14:14] get because we didn't have any meat said
[2:14:16] maybe just get some meat he said would
[2:14:18] you like to come brother Addie yes I
[2:14:21] said I certainly would like to come then
[2:14:23] brother chrisberg his dear friend said
[2:14:26] yeah he said he was Scandinavian he said
[2:14:30] yeah he said I think I'll go too sure
[2:14:33] brother bam said why don't you come and
[2:14:36] then he said no no I'm going to stay I'm
[2:14:38] going to do the dishes you go brother
[2:14:40] Eddie all right so brother brandham and
[2:14:43] I you know that was all pre-planned I
[2:14:46] didn't know it was pre-planned but but
[2:14:48] that was all pre-planned
[2:14:49] and I and and brother Bram and I are
[2:14:53] walking down this little path and then
[2:14:56] he walks off like this and I just walk
[2:15:00] with him and he sits down on a
[2:15:03] log he sits on this
[2:15:10] log and I'm sitting this way and he's
[2:15:12] sitting this
[2:15:15] way now friends I want you to listen
[2:15:18] real close I don't tell this to
[2:15:22] everybody but this was about the time I
[2:15:25] was going to get moved to another
[2:15:29] place to another place I was in a place
[2:15:33] of
[2:15:34] heaviness I was in the place of deep
[2:15:37] deep spiritual
[2:15:40] concern I just didn't know exactly about
[2:15:43] certain major things and I had grave
[2:15:46] doubts in my heart about brother branam
[2:15:51] because my brother-in-law's brother said
[2:15:54] have you heard what's brother bram's
[2:15:56] preaching now and I said no he said
[2:15:59] something about Cain being the son of
[2:16:01] The Serpent and I said oh no I said
[2:16:05] where'd he get that he said I don't know
[2:16:09] and that was in my
[2:16:11] heart and we're sitting on this
[2:16:15] log and I
[2:16:19] thought I read Genesis 4
[2:16:22] And1 and Adam knew his wife and she
[2:16:25] conceived and bear a son and call his
[2:16:28] name Cain I've gotten a man from the
[2:16:31] Lord and I said that's it if brother
[2:16:34] Bram tries to go around
[2:16:36] that listen friends I want you to
[2:16:39] understand me I said if brother Bram
[2:16:40] tries to go around the word that'll be
[2:16:43] the end of our
[2:16:45] friendship I I I I I I have to stay with
[2:16:49] the word of
[2:16:50] God so brother brandham is sitting there
[2:16:55] and he said U we talked about just a
[2:16:58] couple of things a few
[2:17:00] things and then he said
[2:17:03] uh brother Eddie said I was riding on my
[2:17:06] horse I believe it was this mountain
[2:17:09] here I was I going behind brother
[2:17:12] Southwick and he said uh he came to me
[2:17:16] there
[2:17:18] I had heard those words when I sat on
[2:17:20] the platform in some meetings when
[2:17:23] brother Brandon would just raise his
[2:17:24] finger and say he's here I knew who it
[2:17:27] was that was there I knew that angel of
[2:17:31] the Lord was there the angel of the Lord
[2:17:33] I've heard spoke about in these Services
[2:17:36] I knew that angel of the Lord was there
[2:17:38] and he said and now I just I'm telling
[2:17:40] you my my story and he said he he came
[2:17:43] to be there and when he said that
[2:17:48] I don't mean to have my back to
[2:17:51] you I just I looked straight into his
[2:17:53] face and we're only about that far
[2:17:57] apart and his
[2:17:59] eyes like yours are not uh you know a
[2:18:05] person's eyes are they're kind of
[2:18:07] Crystal or clear they move around and
[2:18:11] from one place to another his eyes were
[2:18:13] just deep
[2:18:15] set and uh it was different weren't and
[2:18:18] they weren't sharp and Intense or
[2:18:20] nothing like that but they were like
[2:18:24] like a 10,000 candle power just a dull
[2:18:29] intense friends now what I tell you is
[2:18:32] absolutely the truth before
[2:18:35] God and I looked at
[2:18:38] him and he's just looking at me like
[2:18:41] this he said he came to me there and I
[2:18:44] believe you have three questions you
[2:18:46] want to ask ask
[2:18:53] me friends I tell you in that presence I
[2:18:58] was naked in that presence there was no
[2:19:02] word for me to speak in that presence I
[2:19:05] didn't wait I didn't move I didn't have
[2:19:08] any happy feeling I didn't I didn't have
[2:19:11] any fearful feeling but I knew I was in
[2:19:14] the presence of an awesome person and
[2:19:17] that's why I
[2:19:18] understood every time I hear the prophet
[2:19:22] saying that won't hurt you that's him
[2:19:26] not me when that Prophet would say I'm
[2:19:30] in Two Worlds at this time saying and
[2:19:34] someone come up and he says the
[2:19:35] congregation you watch their face now it
[2:19:39] it it has changed it's Chang because
[2:19:42] they've come into the presence of the
[2:19:44] Angel of the Lord and it has a physical
[2:19:47] a physical effect upon a person you
[2:19:50] can't come into that presence without
[2:19:53] it's not just something you feel it's
[2:19:56] awesome no one wants to be exposed do
[2:20:00] you hear me
[2:20:01] friends I would like to be across a desk
[2:20:03] from you I'd like to be able to speak
[2:20:06] your language I was
[2:20:08] naked I there wasn't even any word for
[2:20:11] me to say uhh but uh there was nothing
[2:20:14] for me to say he said I believe you you
[2:20:17] have three questions and the first one
[2:20:20] and he took them in the order they were
[2:20:22] in my heart in the order of importance
[2:20:26] he said the first one is on the
[2:20:28] baptism and the second one is on the
[2:20:31] godhead and the third one is on the
[2:20:33] Serpent's Seed and I I raised my finger
[2:20:39] and I said brother brandom but the
[2:20:41] scripture says the scripture says and
[2:20:45] Adam knew his wife and and she conceived
[2:20:48] and she said I've got I've got a man
[2:20:51] from the Lord and his name was Cain and
[2:20:55] brother brandom
[2:20:57] said that's exactly the
[2:21:00] truth I thought how can you be saying
[2:21:02] that that's my defense how can you be
[2:21:05] saying that's exactly the truth he said
[2:21:08] but you need to read the next
[2:21:13] verse I I was a preacher but I didn't
[2:21:16] know what the next verse was was and the
[2:21:18] next verse is and she again bear his
[2:21:21] brother Abel and he said they were twins
[2:21:26] you know what I
[2:21:27] said
[2:21:29] oh that's what I
[2:21:32] said
[2:21:33] oh I didn't know they were twins i'
[2:21:36] never heard they were twins this was
[2:21:38] something completely new this was
[2:21:41] something that came from uh some place
[2:21:44] in outer space they were twins he said
[2:21:46] they've always been twins Isaac and
[2:21:49] ishmail and Jesus and Judas and Christ
[2:21:53] and Antichrist and by the time by the
[2:21:56] time they come about the same time and
[2:21:58] they leave about the same time and I I'd
[2:22:01] never heard such things in my life I
[2:22:03] thought oh they were twins he says every
[2:22:07] Revival Bears twins friends I want to be
[2:22:11] the right kind of twin Hallelujah I want
[2:22:14] to be a born again blood the true son of
[2:22:18] the Living
[2:22:22] God
[2:22:27] hallelujah and that was the first
[2:22:30] time and now I tell you my dear precious
[2:22:35] friends that is
[2:22:38] where my
[2:22:41] understanding of
[2:22:43] him was anchored
[2:22:45] there I gained such a
[2:22:48] Holiness and now you're being so
[2:22:51] nice I will I will relate a few
[2:22:55] wish one that I very seldom
[2:23:01] tell young men are you
[2:23:07] listening we were riding in the
[2:23:10] car and he was
[2:23:13] driving and I was sitting on the pth
[2:23:17] passenger
[2:23:20] side and he had that little white cowboy
[2:23:23] hat
[2:23:24] on kind of put it back he said brother
[2:23:28] Eddie what do you think of this
[2:23:31] ministry do you think it could be that
[2:23:33] of Elijah the prophet as it's foretold
[2:23:36] in the scripture and on down and then he
[2:23:38] went to Revelation and then his voice
[2:23:41] just trailed off and I had listened to
[2:23:44] tapes some of the old real tapes and I
[2:23:47] heard that when he was
[2:23:49] under uh a real heavy
[2:23:53] anointing very heavy in
[2:23:56] visions and I I would hear him say
[2:23:59] uh-huh uh-huh uh you come from a certain
[2:24:04] place you come from the East uhhuh uhhuh
[2:24:07] and your daughter wrote you a letter
[2:24:09] uhuh uhuh and the letters in your person
[2:24:13] his voice would just Trail off and
[2:24:15] that's I had observed that
[2:24:17] you've seen and heard that now I hear
[2:24:20] his voice just Trail off do you believe
[2:24:23] this could be that of Elijah the prophet
[2:24:26] as is foretold in the scripture and then
[2:24:28] his voice began to Trail off and then
[2:24:30] the last word I heard was
[2:24:34] Revelation I felt
[2:24:36] completely completely
[2:24:39] incapable I felt that I was not to
[2:24:43] answer this kind of a
[2:24:45] question you brothers are listening very
[2:24:48] intently and I trust this will mean
[2:24:50] something to
[2:24:51] you and I look down at the glove
[2:24:55] box and I said well brother
[2:24:58] brandham for all I
[2:25:01] know it must
[2:25:03] be because it has every appearance of
[2:25:07] being and I kind of looked at him
[2:25:11] sideways and he put his head back we bit
[2:25:14] like this said off kind of
[2:25:18] wondered I kind of think so
[2:25:21] myself and at that instant at that
[2:25:23] instant
[2:25:25] just you talk about a wind you talk
[2:25:28] about a force nothing you could feel
[2:25:31] there was nothing you could feel there
[2:25:33] was nothing physical you could feel but
[2:25:36] there was a person there was a being
[2:25:38] that sat between he and
[2:25:40] I and he was just forward a wee bit just
[2:25:44] towards the dash I could actually tell
[2:25:47] you exactly how it was and I thought I
[2:25:52] thought if I breathe in or
[2:25:55] exhale I'm going into some other place
[2:25:59] I'm going to die I'm going into another
[2:26:03] another world if I
[2:26:06] breathe and I didn't want to move I was
[2:26:12] frozen I'm talking to you about
[2:26:15] him
[2:26:18] I'm talking to you about the Holiness of
[2:26:20] this one we call a pillar of
[2:26:23] fire and I looked I just looked I cast
[2:26:27] my
[2:26:28] eyes sideways because I was afraid to
[2:26:30] move my head I cast my eyes sideways and
[2:26:34] looked at him and brother bram's beard
[2:26:36] we had about four days of beard and I
[2:26:39] know that when a person is under extreme
[2:26:42] trauma their beard will stick out
[2:26:45] prickly and his his beard was prickly
[2:26:49] sticking out on his
[2:26:50] face and I saw his color had drained
[2:26:54] from his face and I thought he looks
[2:26:58] like he's near
[2:27:00] death brother brand roll his head back
[2:27:03] slowly
[2:27:05] slowly just over to the side the eyes
[2:27:09] were the same as they were when I was on
[2:27:11] the
[2:27:15] log he looked at me he said brother
[2:27:18] Eddie and I was just thinking he looks
[2:27:21] like he's near death he said brother
[2:27:24] Eddie I guess he's come to me 10,000
[2:27:27] times
[2:27:28] 10,000 and that's just every time like I
[2:27:31] could
[2:27:33] die and just at that moment I had been
[2:27:36] hunting for Moose for meat large animal
[2:27:40] they stand about 2 m at the
[2:27:42] shoulders and brother brandham was
[2:27:44] driving and he was just we're going
[2:27:46] around on the gravel Highway going
[2:27:49] around this curve and there's this large
[2:27:51] animal standing in the middle of the
[2:27:53] road and it shocked me I said oh oh
[2:27:56] brother brandom there's a moose I said
[2:27:59] you know just stop I'll get him and his
[2:28:03] voice is still slow and thick and he
[2:28:06] says it's it's all it's all right
[2:28:08] brother Eddie it's all right just get
[2:28:10] your gun and your shells I had my gun in
[2:28:13] my hand he said just get your gun and
[2:28:15] your shells
[2:28:17] it's all right and he just kept driving
[2:28:19] the same speed I said stop brother
[2:28:21] brandom I'll get him now we're just
[2:28:23] maybe a 100 m or less and he said it's
[2:28:28] all right he said something like it's
[2:28:30] yours he's yours he said just have your
[2:28:33] gun and he drove up the closest I've
[2:28:36] ever
[2:28:37] been to a wild
[2:28:41] animal about 90
[2:28:44] M and stops
[2:28:47] and I get out and I have a scope on my
[2:28:51] rifle and I'm looking through the scope
[2:28:53] and all I see is hair I can't even see
[2:28:57] the animal and I have to lift the gun up
[2:29:00] to the sky and see the hump on the
[2:29:03] animal and bring it down it's the only
[2:29:05] time in my life I had that experience
[2:29:08] and I pulled the trigger and I saw the
[2:29:11] bullet actually now some of you people
[2:29:13] may not like this but this we live on
[2:29:14] meat and and the bullet just entered in
[2:29:17] and poof and then I thought oh I don't
[2:29:20] want him to stop I don't want him to
[2:29:22] stop on the highway someone will come
[2:29:24] over the hill and hit him and we'll have
[2:29:27] an accident I I thought and then there's
[2:29:30] a wide area maybe like from here to the
[2:29:33] wall That's all clear just grass and
[2:29:36] then trees starting there and I thought
[2:29:39] I don't want them to fall there some we
[2:29:41] don't have room and somebody will come
[2:29:43] and steal him and take all this meat
[2:29:45] maybe five six seven 700 lbs of meat a
[2:29:48] large animal and and I needed that
[2:29:51] animal for food for my family and and
[2:29:55] and the Moose he just walked down
[2:29:57] stepped off the highway and he started
[2:30:00] to walk slowly slowly and I know he's
[2:30:03] not going to go very far and I don't
[2:30:06] want him I need him hid because I don't
[2:30:09] need him out in this grass somebody will
[2:30:11] steal him and he walks into the trees
[2:30:13] and just as he walks into the trees I
[2:30:15] fire another shot another young brother
[2:30:17] was traveling with us catching a ride he
[2:30:20] fired a shot and a moose stepped over
[2:30:23] two big logs two big logs and was
[2:30:26] completely hidden and fell right there
[2:30:29] you say would God do that
[2:30:31] absolutely my father would do that and
[2:30:35] completely hid that animal and we
[2:30:38] dressed we dressed the animal and God's
[2:30:42] Prophet sat on a tree right beside us
[2:30:45] and he watched me in the other the young
[2:30:46] man and we dressed this animal got it
[2:30:50] all ready got it dressed we finished
[2:30:54] wiped our
[2:30:55] knives walk back to the car brother BR
[2:30:58] walked with
[2:30:59] me we got in a car he sat in his seat
[2:31:03] and I
[2:31:06] sat friends I'm not giv over to special
[2:31:10] things but I was surrounded in an
[2:31:15] atmosphere
[2:31:17] it was it was so
[2:31:20] Divine it even had a color it was like
[2:31:24] emerald
[2:31:26] green there's nothing my eyes were
[2:31:28] registering I said this is the most
[2:31:31] beautiful
[2:31:32] place I thought oh
[2:31:34] God I'd like to just live here
[2:31:38] forever and the prophet laid his head
[2:31:42] back looked at me he said brother Eddie
