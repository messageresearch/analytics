[16:20] that what mean of
[16:22] this all right so Numbers Chapter 13 are
[16:26] want to read from verse
[16:27] 30 and Caleb Ste the people before Moses
[16:31] and said let us go up at once and
[16:33] possess it for we are well able to
[16:36] overcome it but the men that went up
[16:39] with him said we be not able to go up
[16:42] against the people amen for they are
[16:44] stronger than way verse 32 and they
[16:47] brought up an evil report of the land
[16:50] which they had searched unto the
[16:52] children of Israel saying the land
[16:55] through which we have gone to search it
[16:58] is a land that eated up the inhabitants
[17:00] thereof and all the people that saw it
[17:03] in it are men of great stature let's
[17:06] switch to Numbers Chapter 14
[17:10] verse1 and all the congregation lifted
[17:13] up their voice and cried the people wept
[17:17] that night verse 5 then Moses and Aaron
[17:21] fell on their
[17:26] face before all the children of Israel
[17:29] of the congregation of
[17:31] Israel verse
[17:33] 11 and the Lord said unto
[17:36] Moses how long will this people provoke
[17:40] me how long will it be a they believe me
[17:44] for all the signs which I have showed
[17:47] among them verse
[17:50] 23 surely they shall not see the land
[17:54] which I swear unto their fathers neither
[17:57] shall any of them that Pro voke me see
[17:59] it but my servant Caleb because he had
[18:04] another spirit with him Hallelujah and
[18:07] had followed me fully him will I bring
[18:10] into the land where unto he went and his
[18:13] seed shall possess it am verse 27 how
[18:19] long shall I bear with this evil
[18:22] congregation which murmur against me I
[18:24] have heard the murmurings of the
[18:26] children of Israel and their murmur
[18:29] against me say unto them as truly as I
[18:33] live sayeth the Lord as ye have spoken
[18:36] in mine ears so will I do to you your
[18:41] carcass shall fall in this Wilderness
[18:44] and all that were numbered of you
[18:46] according to your whole number from 20
[18:49] years old and upwards which have
[18:51] murmured against me doubtless he shall
[18:54] not come into the land concerning which
[18:56] I swear to make you dwell therein save
[19:00] Caleb the son of jeffon and Joshua the
[19:02] son of nun but your little ones which
[19:07] you said should be a prey them will I
[19:10] bring in and they shall know the land
[19:13] which ye have despised let's go down to
[19:16] verse 36 and the men which Moses sent to
[19:19] search the land who returned and made
[19:22] all the congregation to murmur against
[19:24] him by bringing up a slander upon the
[19:27] land even those men that did bring up
[19:30] the evil report upon the land died by
[19:33] the plague before the Lord and Joshua
[19:37] the son of nun and Caleb the son of
[19:39] jeffon which were of the men that went
[19:41] to search the land live still and Moses
[19:45] told these sayings unto all the children
[19:47] of Israel and the people mourned
[19:50] greatly and they rose up early in the
[19:52] morning and got them up into the top of
[19:54] the mountain saying Lo we be here and we
[19:57] go up unto the place which the Lord had
[19:59] promised for we have
[20:01] sinned and Moses said wherefore now do
[20:05] you transgress the Commandments of the
[20:07] Lord but it is not but it shall not
[20:10] Prosper go not up for the Lord is not
[20:14] among you that ye be not smitten before
[20:17] your enemies for the aites and the
[20:20] Canaanites are there before you and you
[20:23] shall fall by the sword because you are
[20:25] turned away from the Lord therefore the
[20:27] Lord will not be with you but they
[20:31] presumed to go up onto the hilltop
[20:35] nevertheless the Ark of the Covenant of
[20:37] the Lord and Moses departed not out of
[20:39] the camp then the amalekites came down
[20:43] and the Canaanites which dwell in the
[20:45] hill and smok them and discomforted them

[24:42] on the promise of Isaac like Noah 120
[24:46] years believing the promise of rain amen
[24:50] now let's go down into the word but the
[24:53] beat a message called reproach for the
[24:55] cause of the word God has a time and a
[24:59] reason for that time to fulfill all his
[25:02] work amen God knows just exactly what
[25:05] he's going to do we don't we just have
[25:07] to receive it as he give it to us but he
[25:11] knows and there is nothing going to go
[25:15] wrong with what he's planned to
[25:19] do so stop trying to assist
[25:23] God nothing is going to go wrong
[25:28] remember what we said on Thursday night
[25:30] because bam had something in his heart
[25:33] that was corrupt when God tell him don't
[25:37] go he still went back to seek the Lord
[25:39] to see if God will change his mind and
[25:42] when he went back God said
[25:45] go but it came from perfect will to
[25:49] permissive will and we will emphasizing
[25:53] the reveal word will of God Amen yes sir
[25:56] when the word reveal it it is the will
[25:58] of God it's not your dream it's not
[26:02] somebody text you it's the word being
[26:05] revealed and you falling in line to obey
[26:08] the word am because if you watch what
[26:11] God say and how God blessed people and
[26:13] you do that God have to bless you God
[26:16] must bless you because he's the same
[26:19] yesterday today and forever and if you
[26:21] see how God curse people and you do that
[26:23] God will have to curse you because he is
[26:26] just and he is God he to keep his word
[26:29] there is no respector of persons he is
[26:32] God and God
[26:34] Alone Oh give him glory now the
[26:38] scripture we read wasn't about
[26:40] unbelievers or make Believers or they
[26:43] wasn't God's people these were the
[26:45] people that God brought out these were
[26:48] the people that saw Miracles and these
[26:50] were the people that God was about to
[26:54] judge Oh Glory to God hallelujah
[26:59] know this message this morning is not an
[27:01] easy
[27:02] one but this is what I got from the Lord
[27:06] to bring to you he knows and there's
[27:09] nothing going to go wrong with what he
[27:11] plans to do it all has to come about and
[27:13] there sometimes have to have rugged and
[27:15] hartings to bring out the true nature of
[27:17] the object rain is born in ragged
[27:20] dragged thundering Skies God sets a time
[27:24] and has a purpose for everything he does
[27:26] there's nothing happened accidentally I
[27:28] love that to them that love the Lord and
[27:32] called according to his purpose even the
[27:35] bad things and the uncomfortable things
[27:37] working out for good so so get
[27:40] comfortable with being
[27:42] uncomfortable come on now say Amen
[27:44] somebody stop trying to get everything
[27:47] comfortable as you want it get
[27:50] comfortable with being uncomfortable get
[27:53] comfortable being under pressure get
[27:55] comfortable being under tension get
[27:58] comfortable having mind P get
[28:04] comfortable
[28:06] Hallelujah Glory count it not strange
[28:09] you're feeling uncomfortable count it
[28:11] not strange you got a battle to come in
[28:13] this morning come get not strange the
[28:15] devil didn't want you to be here this
[28:17] morning but you have to be here this
[28:19] morning because there's a word from the
[28:22] Lord for
[28:24] you hallelujah
[28:27] hallelujah now
[28:29] watch he said now what the BR I'm
[28:32] talking about came to church the two
[28:35] people carrying on making love in church
[28:37] vulgar and he's begging them to be quiet
[28:40] and the Holy Spirit said they in your
[28:42] hands what will you do with them there
[28:44] was a holy hush everybody was deadly
[28:47] quiet I thought oh God what must I do
[28:50] then I remembered if it happened in the
[28:52] warning of the Holy Spirit two before I
[28:54] said I forgive
[28:56] you amen and and that is what he wanted
[29:00] me to say because after all I've been
[29:04] guilty maybe not of that but I'm guilty
[29:08] and guilty of the least is of the whole
[29:11] so I said I forgive you and their
[29:13] Witnesses sitting here the Holy Spirit
[29:15] fell through amen yes sir now you see I
[29:18] believe that all these things had a
[29:20] meaning amen what would you do with the
[29:24] power why would God give a man power
[29:27] when the man don't have
[29:29] character that doesn't make sense he's
[29:33] going to abuse that power and God hates
[29:37] abuse God don't want no husband abusing
[29:40] no wife God even said if you don't treat
[29:43] your wife right he wouldn't even answer
[29:46] your
[29:47] prayer that's the word and this is how
[29:50] we go back to the Bible this is how we
[29:53] get guidance in how we live not just to
[29:56] sit in church and say Amen you got to
[30:00] live right you got to act right you got

[35:41] Dynamics is promise power is promise not
[35:45] not a one power no it's promise in other
[35:48] words power is Minds it is promise God
[35:52] said so I want to be like Caleb have

[35:59] brought an evil report and God say as I
[36:02] live they're going to fall in the
[36:04] wilderness they're going to perish
[36:07] because I brought them out to give them
[36:09] all these precious promises that by
[36:11] these promises they can be a Divine
[36:14] partaker of the divine nature having
[36:17] escaped the corruption that is in the
[36:19] world to
[36:23] L in other words you said you may be
[36:26] seated you take it today you are saying
[36:30] that you can't live
[36:32] that this is the promised land whenever
[36:36] you say that I don't know about that and
[36:38] no that's saying just like what them
[36:40] evil report the land is a good land
[36:44] these people were so backed in spirit
[36:46] they say God would to God be tied in
[36:49] Egypt my God you bring us out here to
[36:53] perish
[36:54] no you come out here to possess
[36:59] amen
[37:00] hallelujah my so you always have to have
[37:04] this reproach to get a test and every
[37:05] man that comes to Christ must first be
[37:07] child trained for the purpose that God
[37:10] has ordained you for remember if you
[37:12] could just keep quiet amen that way we
[37:15] ball We Carry On we not keeping quiet
[37:19] watch remember if he call you for this
[37:21] there is nothing that can keep it from
[37:24] happening amen are you ready yes there
[37:27] is is not enough Devil's in torment but
[37:30] what God word will be made
[37:32] manifest I'm still reading you are born
[37:35] for a purpose and nobody can take your
[37:40] place oh give the Lord a big Hallelujah
[37:43] now he said you were born for a purpose
[37:47] tell the Devil he's a liar you were born
[37:49] for a purpose that purpose must be
[37:55] fulfilled do you know God raised up
[37:57] pharaoh
[37:58] to bring down
[38:05] Pharaoh so friends you could only
[38:09] understand God by faith and which is by
[38:12] Revelation not by intellect intellect
[38:16] cannot comprehend God Jesus because
[38:19] intellect is limited there are no sense
[38:22] in intellect of man to contact God
[38:24] outside of the sense of faith and faith
[38:27] is a revelation amen so the prophet said
[38:30] that there is no school the Myst of God
[38:32] reveal no theologians no teachings of
[38:34] the Bible among any school they cannot
[38:37] know nothing about it it is impossible
[38:39] for them to know anything about it God
[38:42] here we go has hid the senses of knowing
[38:45] it from the very elected
[38:48] teachers talking about Gifted Man gifted
[38:50] teachers and their senses can't
[38:52] comprehend it so what they pump in the
[38:54] word with is intellect the front lobe
[38:56] back lobe Square lobe wherever lobe you
[38:58] have the G matter that is what they're
[39:01] pedaling intellect because God is not
[39:04] known by intellect are you with me that
[39:07] is why they were ignorant and unlearned
[39:09] Peter was ignorant and unlearned Peter
[39:12] couldn't sign his name Peter couldn't
[39:14] sign a check Peter may not even able to
[39:16] count all the bills but he they had to
[39:19] take note he had been with Jesus that
[39:21] man knew God not about God he can't read
[39:25] about it he can't read so knew about God
[39:29] he knew God because God was veiled in
[39:32] him mid alive as was in
[39:36] Moses god veiled in Peter it wasn't
[39:40] reading about God it was saying Silver
[39:44] and Gold Have I None what do you have I
[39:47] have God in
[39:52] Me what is it what is it God above us
[39:57] fire Cloud God With Us Jesus Christ and
[40:00] then God in you the Holy Ghost itself
[40:03] that's what always God purpose to hide
[40:06] himself in man to wrap himself in Earth
[40:09] vessels oh my you're getting me
[40:12] excited treasure in Earth and vessels

[40:46] what a wret I am but God choose to hide
[40:48] himself you talk about praises and honor
[40:51] and Glory when you understand what
[40:53] manner of love is this that God could
[40:54] choose to wrap himself inside of you

[56:27] hallelujah amen watch and the life of
[56:30] Christ projecting itself through you
[56:32] with
[56:56] men instead of trusting the word I'm not
[56:58] standing by no man people supporting
[57:00] this one and that one I'm standing by
[57:02] the word if any brother standing on the
[57:04] word I'm standing with him I don't even
[57:07] have to meet him Paul was in the Arabian
[57:10] Desert and when he get to Peter they're
[57:11] speaking the same things and when Paul
[57:14] had to bust and straighten out Peter
[57:15] Paul bust and straighten out Peter
[57:18] because Peter was going contrary to the
[57:20] principles of the word so you have to
[57:22] straighten on Peter when Peter had to
[57:24] write he said you had to be watch how
[57:25] Paul WR because Paul is a you know Paul
[57:28] say I'm strong things I can't talk like
[57:31] Paul because Paul had different capacity
[57:32] and so forth everybody have different
[57:34] capacity and position and calling and so
[57:36] on and God have to begin to reveal to
[57:38] the Brethren what their calling is no
[57:39] man can tell me stay there you know that
[57:42] your calling they not my Holy Ghost they
[57:45] might want to be I mean my
[57:47] denominational Pope guide or something
[57:50] like that but I'm not allowing them that
[57:52] for privilege because God already take

[59:10] disconnected from the senses part to
[59:14] really connect to God because your
[59:16] children will mess you up I tell people
[59:18] live for the Lord don't live for your
[59:19] children put God first your turn get old
[59:22] and leave you forget about you live for
[59:24] God put God first God
[59:27] first God
[59:30] first amen if I take on all the issues
[59:34] and pule issues I will will not even
[59:35] preach oh God my heart oh
[59:38] god oh pray for my Saints since you know
[59:43] what it is a stress
[59:46] out if I come here with that what kind
[59:48] of thing is that I can't afford to do
[59:49] that that's right no no no no no it's
[59:52] the word right is right and wrong is
[59:55] wrong God no respect to a person isn't
[59:58] that right you love
[1:00:00] him oh praise the name of the Lord so
[1:00:03] watch by lack of Revelation is why there
[1:00:05] are so many different divisions today
[1:00:08] and so much mockery so much divisions
[1:00:11] Among Us is because the people lack that
[1:00:13] Revelation they lack that Revelation the
[1:00:15] teachers could you imagine the teachers
[1:00:17] lack Revelation they have knowledge but
[1:00:20] not Revelation oh my so here is Lucifer
[1:00:25] again
[1:00:27] limiting the word of God to his
[1:00:29] reasonings that is
[1:00:31] Lucifer now from SMA Church age here we
[1:00:34] go when the church gets away from the
[1:00:37] word it will believe anything that's
[1:00:40] right
[1:00:42] huj now do you
[1:00:46] realize like Eve when Cain was born she
[1:00:49] say I've gotten a man from the Lord now
[1:00:52] listen to this Revelation brother Bram
[1:00:53] is breaking here do you realize that she
[1:00:55] really meant that she taught that she
[1:00:59] had a man from the Lord you see once she
[1:01:01] had been deceived by taking the word of
[1:01:04] Satan instead of the word of God she
[1:01:06] then Tau that whatever she said was
[1:01:13] right and if she said she had a man from
[1:01:16] God then she had a man from God but God
[1:01:20] has set his laws in the universe a good
[1:01:23] seed can only bring forth good fruit a
[1:01:25] evil seed can only bring for evil fruit
[1:01:27] now each seed true different will
[1:01:29] utilize the same Earth nourishment
[1:01:31] moisture Sunshine but it will bring
[1:01:32] forth of its own kind amen now if you
[1:01:35] look at the statement of Eve read close
[1:01:38] you will notice that she had more of an
[1:01:40] understanding than most
[1:01:42] realized she did not attribute the son
[1:01:45] to Satan for that would have made him
[1:01:47] equal with
[1:01:48] God so Eve had deeper thoughts than you
[1:01:51] might might appear only God could create
[1:01:54] the egg in the womb of Mary Satan
[1:01:57] couldn't do that Eve knew that Satan can
[1:01:59] only pervert so he beguiled her with the
[1:02:02] wrong seed it was the serpent seed that
[1:02:04] brought forth Cain it was Adam's seed
[1:02:07] that brought forth Abel and Seth those
[1:02:09] seeds went through the same process but
[1:02:11] the children were different for they
[1:02:13] were different seeds she believed that
[1:02:16] Cain was from God she accepted the
[1:02:19] devil's lie as the truth of God that is
[1:02:22] exactly what we have now churches set
[1:02:25] themselves up as Fountains of the truth
[1:02:28] but the truth is not in them they have
[1:02:30] begotten children swear by them and
[1:02:33] would even kill to uphold their
[1:02:36] error if you think that's an
[1:02:38] exaggeration read 2 Timothy chapter 3 I
[1:02:42] charge thee therefore before God and the
[1:02:45] Lord Jesus who shall judge the quick and
[1:02:47] the dead at is appearing in his kingdom
[1:02:49] preach the word be inant in season out
[1:02:51] of season reprove rebuke exalt with all
[1:02:54] Longs suffering and do
[1:02:56] for the time will come when they will
[1:02:58] not endure song Doctrine but after their
[1:03:01] own lust shall Heap to themselves
[1:03:04] teachers having itching ears and they
[1:03:06] shall turn away their ears from the
[1:03:08] truth and shall turn to fables but watch
[1:03:12] thou in all things and your afflictions
[1:03:14] do the work of an evangelist make full
[1:03:17] proof of thy Ministry when the church
[1:03:20] allow herself to move away from the
[1:03:22] original like Adam and Eve death set in
[1:03:25] there is no strength in her amen she has
[1:03:28] become a
[1:03:31] monstrosity the minute the church moved
[1:03:33] towards form and ceremony and towards
[1:03:36] priesthood by organizing the ministers
[1:03:39] into a group that decided leadership
[1:03:42] apart from the Holy Spirit and his word
[1:03:45] that very moment death entered when she
[1:03:48] started to get sick and she got sick she
[1:03:51] charged she changed to a powerless group
[1:03:53] of people whose only weapon was
[1:03:59] argument when I studying this and I read
[1:04:02] this I said my mind was totally
[1:04:04] blown only weapon AR argument she could
[1:04:09] produce nothing in the spirit for her
[1:04:12] hopes were built on program and not on
[1:04:14] faith in his word they sld program they
[1:04:17] read program they sld perversion they
[1:04:19] read perverted
[1:04:22] children you tamper with God and you
[1:04:25] reap exam L what you injected what would
[1:04:27] happen if you change your truth into a
[1:04:29] lie the answer is you will breed an
[1:04:31] antichrist Godless system of religion
[1:04:33] that is so perverted it will not look
[1:04:35] like or produce that original what he
[1:04:38] original did the only answer that God
[1:04:40] has for a situation like that is the
[1:04:42] Lake of Fire there are those who say
[1:04:44] that God's people are going to come
[1:04:46] together through a collective Revelation
[1:04:48] I want to get to this this is Brother
[1:04:50] Bram at his time there was a saying in
[1:04:56] that time that Elijah Ministry of
[1:04:58] Malachi 4 is a collective Ministry it's
[1:05:00] a body Ministry and he had to refute
[1:05:02] that listen to this there are those who
[1:05:05] say that God's people are going to come
[1:05:06] together through a collective Revelation
[1:05:08] I challenge that statement it
[1:05:11] is uh it's a ball inv valid assumption
[1:05:15] in the face of Revelation 10:7 now I do
[1:05:17] not deny that people will prophesy in
[1:05:19] this last age and their Ministries can
[1:05:21] and will be correct I do not deny that
[1:05:23] there will be prophets even in the days
[1:05:25] of Paul PA there was one akabas a
[1:05:27] prophet who prophesy a famine I agree
[1:05:29] that is so but I deny upon the
[1:05:32] infallible evidence of the word that
[1:05:35] there is more than one major prophet
[1:05:37] messenger who would reveal the Mysteries
[1:05:39] as containing the word and who has the
[1:05:43] ministry to turn the hearts of the
[1:05:44] children to the fathers thus sayeth the
[1:05:47] Lord his unfailing word stands and shall
[1:05:51] stand and be Vindicated there is one
[1:05:53] Prophet Messenger to this age on the
[1:05:55] basis of human behavior alone anyone
[1:05:59] that where there are many people there
[1:06:02] is even divided opinion on lesser points
[1:06:05] of major doctrines that they hold
[1:06:07] together who then will have the power of
[1:06:12] infallibility to be restored in the last
[1:06:14] age for this last age is going to go
[1:06:18] back to manifesting a pure word
[1:06:21] bride so in other words once they are
[1:06:23] men there'll be differences that's a us
[1:06:25] when there are people in family there
[1:06:27] are differences in churches there are
[1:06:29] differences he said who is going to
[1:06:30] bring back that infallible word because
[1:06:32] they're going to have a pure bride are
[1:06:34] you with me amen now watch the second to
[1:06:37] that must be impressed okay
[1:06:40] sorry that means here we go we will have
[1:06:43] the word once again as it was perfectly
[1:06:48] given perfectly understood in the days
[1:06:51] of Paul I will tell you who will have it
[1:06:54] it will be a prophet
[1:06:56] thoroughly
[1:06:57] Vindicated even more thoroughly
[1:07:00] Vindicated than any other prophet in all
[1:07:02] ages from Enoch to this
[1:07:06] day that is the magnitude of vindication
[1:07:10] are you with me because this man will of
[1:07:14] necessity have the Capstone prophetic
[1:07:20] Ministry Hallelujah hallu so do you CAU
[1:07:23] what brother Bram had he had the
[1:07:26] Capstone prophetic Ministry so his
[1:07:29] ministry revealed the Mysteries to bring
[1:07:32] down the Capstone
[1:07:33] itself therefore this Prophet has reveal
[1:07:36] every
[1:07:37] mystery no man can come back to reveal
[1:07:40] no mystery it has already been revealed
[1:07:43] we have to find where it is written
[1:07:46] where it is hidden but it's already in
[1:07:48] the word because Malachi 4 at the
[1:07:51] Capstone
[1:07:54] Ministry oh
[1:07:58] Hallelujah God will show him forth he
[1:08:01] won't need to speak for himself amen God
[1:08:03] will speak for him by the voice of the
[1:08:07] sign the second thought that must be
[1:08:09] impressed on our hearts is that the
[1:08:11] seven Church ages started out with the
[1:08:12] Antichrist Spirit as well as the Holy
[1:08:15] Spirit yes listen to the approach of him
[1:08:18] going to the scriptures 1 John 4:1
[1:08:22] beloved believe not every spirit amen
[1:08:25] but try the spirit you have a
[1:08:30] dream who said that is God people take
[1:08:34] every dream for God they see alligator
[1:08:37] they see a tiger and they see a FL every
[1:08:42] dream sometime you eat corn too late in
[1:08:44] the
[1:08:45] night some you
[1:08:47] ovat and everything get cross up and
[1:08:51] then you get some pictures in your head
[1:08:52] and they come out off your bed with
[1:08:54] that
[1:08:56] even if it's songing good you could
[1:08:59] write it shelf it you know watch it but
[1:09:01] don't come out with it and all you're
[1:09:02] looking for
[1:09:04] it unless God give you a direct Vision
[1:09:07] fear not Joseph to take unto the Mary
[1:09:09] thy
[1:09:11] wife Joseph G in a dream amen a dream
[1:09:15] Hallelujah I know she going through her
[1:09:16] reproach I know she going through her
[1:09:18] thing everybody mocking and laughing but
[1:09:21] that is what the bride have to go
[1:09:23] through but you're pregnant
[1:09:27] but
[1:09:28] Messiah you're going to produce the Life
[1:09:30] of Christ do you believe that all right
[1:09:34] believe not every Spirit but try the
[1:09:36] spirits whether they of God watch watch
[1:09:40] because many false prophets are going
[1:09:42] out into the world not
[1:09:44] little many did you notice it the
[1:09:47] Antichrist spirit is identified with
[1:09:49] false prophets the ages came in with
[1:09:51] false prophets and they go out with
[1:09:52] false prophets now of course there's
[1:09:53] going to be a real false prophet
[1:09:56] in the grand sense of that man mentioned
[1:09:58] in Revelation but as now before this
[1:10:01] Revelation there had to appear many
[1:10:02] false prophets Matthew 24:36 and they
[1:10:05] and if any man shall say unto you Lord
[1:10:07] has Christ believe it not there shall
[1:10:09] arise false Christ false prophets shall
[1:10:11] show great signs and wonders in so much
[1:10:13] if it were possible they shall they see
[1:10:14] the very elect behold I have told you
[1:10:16] before wherefore if they say unto you
[1:10:18] behold he's in the desert go not forth
[1:10:21] behold he's in a secret chamber believe
[1:10:22] it not these false prophets are A Marked
[1:10:26] for us in various other scriptures such
[1:10:28] as 2 Peter 2 1-2 and there were false
[1:10:33] prophet among the people even as there
[1:10:35] shall be false teachers among you who
[1:10:38] priv shall bring in damnable heresies
[1:10:41] even denying the Lord that brought them
[1:10:42] and bring them from themselves Swift
[1:10:44] Destruction for many shall follow their
[1:10:47] piceous ways by reason of whom the way
[1:10:49] of truth shall be evil spoken of 2
[1:10:52] Timothy 4:3 and 4 for the time will come
[1:10:55] when they shall not end your song
[1:10:57] Doctrine but after their own lust shall
[1:10:58] he to themselves teachers having itching
[1:11:00] ears and they shall turn away their ears
[1:11:02] from the truth and shall return to
[1:11:04] fables 2 Timothy 4:1 the spirit speaketh
[1:11:08] expressly that in the latter time shall
[1:11:10] come many shall depart from defate given
[1:11:13] he to seducing spirits and doctrines of
[1:11:15] devils now in every case you will notice
[1:11:18] that a false prophet is one who is
[1:11:20] outside the word just as we showed you
[1:11:23] that Antichrist mean anti word so these
[1:11:26] false prophets come perverting the word
[1:11:28] giving it a meaning that fits their own
[1:11:30] devilish ends have you ever noticed how
[1:11:33] the people who leads others astray bind
[1:11:37] them closely to themselves by fear true
[1:11:40] I want to repeat that have you ever
[1:11:42] noticed how the people who lead others
[1:11:47] astray bind the people to themselves by
[1:11:50] fear yes am that is true they say if the
[1:11:53] people don't do what they say or leave
[1:11:56] then destruction will follow they are
[1:11:58] false prophets amen for a true Prophet
[1:12:01] will always lead one to the word and
[1:12:04] bind the people to Jesus Christ and he
[1:12:07] won't tell the people to fear Him or
[1:12:09] what he says but to fear what the word
[1:12:11] say Amen oh
[1:12:13] hallelujah
[1:12:16] hallelujah so I'm exalting you this
[1:12:18] morning on the word brother bam give me
[1:12:21] a church here we go full of the Holy
[1:12:24] Ghost Hallelujah God will do in one year
[1:12:27] what all the theology fail to do in
[1:12:29] 2,000 years you wait till the anointing
[1:12:32] of the church really strike home that's
[1:12:35] what we looking for that's the Dynamics
[1:12:37] we're talking about we are looking for a
[1:12:39] church full of what full of the Holy
[1:12:41] Ghost full of what the Holy
[1:12:44] Ghost Hall after the doors of the gentil
[1:12:48] is closed God will a church then he do
[1:12:50] filthy be filthy still oh praise God
[1:12:53] notice here we go Moses he was the
[1:12:56] anointed word for that promised word for
[1:12:58] that day isn't that right Noah was the
[1:13:00] anointed word for that day Abraham and
[1:13:02] so forth now watch and Moses stood there
[1:13:06] that anointed word of that day that's
[1:13:08] why he could put his hand in his bosom
[1:13:10] why he was standing in the presence of
[1:13:13] God you see when Samson is under the
[1:13:16] anointing he could do anything when
[1:13:19] Moses under the anointing these guys
[1:13:21] could do anything it wasn't Moses it was

[1:13:48] glory around him every move he made
[1:13:51] represented God are we ready that is
[1:13:55] where the church ought to be standing
[1:13:58] now Hallelujah he said but we are off on
[1:14:00] something denominational something so
[1:14:02] the church now should be representing
[1:14:05] God every move we make supposed to be
[1:14:08] under the glory and direction of the
[1:14:10] spirit direction of the spirit not
[1:14:15] intellect give you scriptures me L by

[1:14:23] brother talk about Moses whether he like
[1:14:25] it or not he said not to be different
[1:14:27] but to be obedient obedience is better
[1:14:30] than sacrifice God had so much complete
[1:14:33] control of them till he was their voice
[1:14:37] and their action I like that God had
[1:14:39] these men so much under their his
[1:14:41] control his control that those men
[1:14:44] became his voice and action it wasn't a
[1:14:48] matter a man studying to bring forth a
[1:14:50] message no it was a matter of the man so
[1:14:53] much in the presence of God that he
[1:14:55] spoke for God they were one with their
[1:14:57] message they were one with God isn't
[1:15:00] that right Hallelujah God had so much
[1:15:03] complete control of them tell he was
[1:15:05] their voice and action here brother give
[1:15:07] me a church that's so completely
[1:15:09] Anointed with God till their very action
[1:15:12] and move is thus sayeth the Lord walk in
[1:15:16] that CH kind of Glory I will show you a
[1:15:18] messiah anointed one standing upon the
[1:15:21] face of the Earth hallelujah oh

[1:15:26] prophesying give me a church full of the
[1:15:28] Holy Ghost he is predicting he is
[1:15:30] prophesying a church Anointed with God
[1:15:33] hallelujah a church Anointed with God
[1:15:36] what is that the promise of the
[1:15:40] father Jesus told a woman well we know
[1:15:43] what we worship the father seek such to
[1:15:46] worship Him in spirit and in truth we
[1:15:48] didn't have the full truth to the ages
[1:15:51] it only now God could get proper worship
[1:15:54] because William Brandon brought the
[1:15:56] fullness of the word back to the people
[1:15:59] with the fullness of the word comes the
[1:16:01] fullness of the spirit so it's only now
[1:16:03] God could release the fullness of his
[1:16:05] spirit so we can't act ignorant we can't
[1:16:07] act like we don't know we have 40 years
[1:16:09] of this messag amen right in the earth
[1:16:12] 40 plus years God filtering taking out
[1:16:15] the MCB believer the unbeliever halfway
[1:16:17] believer whatever because he have to
[1:16:19] work True Believers oh praise God that
[1:16:21] woman of the well was a True Believer
[1:16:23] you know she just didn't know it yet yet
[1:16:25] she was trapped under phariseeism she
[1:16:27] was trapped under her caral life but
[1:16:30] that didn't hinder that seed inside of
[1:16:31] her and some of you might be trapped
[1:16:33] inside of head but that's not going to
[1:16:34] hinder the seed of God inside your life
[1:16:37] that's why God will open his eyes big
[1:16:39] when this one in this condition and that
[1:16:41] condition and that condition is
[1:16:42] religious people open their eye big and
[1:16:44] find fault with this and find fault with
[1:16:45] that but we have all sin and come short
[1:16:48] of the glory of God are you with me oh
[1:16:51] praise the name of the Lord
[1:16:53] hallelujah let's get down a little
[1:16:55] deeper now

[1:17:05] what did Abraham said stagger not the

[1:17:23] doesn't stop it one bit but that's the
[1:17:25] reproach for the word hallelujah so

[1:17:34] that's you bearing a reproach for the
[1:17:36] word hallelujah your wife say where is

[1:17:44] the promise but you are believing a
[1:17:46] promise and you are believing it and

[1:49:56] this the church is supposed to be
[1:49:58] predestined to adoption of children
[1:50:00] where a man a man can God can take a man
[1:50:03] adopt him into the family and give him
[1:50:05] something first try
[1:50:08] that a man came last night pillar fire
[1:50:12] appear over my home angel on one side
[1:50:15] angel on one side and whatnot and

[1:51:20] going quickly but Bram
[1:51:23] they were presuming they were right
[1:51:25] because they had priests and their
[1:51:28] synagogues if it doesn't matter whether
[1:51:32] truth or error whether what we do how we
[1:51:35] live what we preach it doesn't matter
[1:51:37] listen to this why did God let 6,000
[1:51:40] years of suffering and perils and death
[1:51:42] strike the human
[1:51:45] race if he just didn't let Eve get by
[1:51:48] with one little miscued

[1:54:24] pruned it up come Wesley another Branch
[1:54:26] coming on it what did he do organize god
[1:54:28] prun listen that's God's tree but as
[1:54:31] they organized he cut it off who did it

[1:54:51] you have to continue Contin to serve God
[1:54:53] but said this way he said a lot of
[1:54:54] ministers and I'm saying this think that
[1:54:57] they no longer have to serve God they
[1:54:59] get so secure with the congregation they
[1:55:01] feel they could do anything and get away
[1:55:03] with
[1:55:05] it Hallelujah afterwards they feel
[1:55:08] secure there so much people that have
[1:55:09] Deon Elder they feel secure and
[1:55:11] everything else that they start to
[1:55:13] little make little small sin little
[1:55:14] small thing here and afterwards God
[1:55:16] leave them they don't even know the
[1:55:17] church is void of
[1:55:19] God yes it have sermons yes it have
[1:55:22] scriptures yes it have quotes but where
[1:55:25] is the Living God Among the people amen
[1:55:28] amen hallelujah it does not zve it
[1:55:31] doesn't put us on a
[1:55:34] throne each one have to serve God
[1:55:37] daily the elders in here the deacons in
[1:55:41] here the ushers is
[1:55:44] here God hates abuse amen abuse of
[1:55:48] authority abuse of position that is why
[1:55:51] God have to give people character and
[1:55:53] test first before putting them in a
[1:55:59] power humbles people to see what's in
[1:56:02] their heart
[1:56:05] yes so God keep cutting it
[1:56:09] off want to read something here look how
[1:56:12] B bring it who came first John the
[1:56:14] Baptist preaching what repentance who
[1:56:15] come next Jesus Christ and he put Jesus

[1:56:23] next the baptism of the Holy Ghost John
[1:56:26] keep brought what repentance Jesus

[1:56:30] ghost that why if I don't go Holy Ghost
[1:56:32] will not come I have to go for the Holy
[1:56:35] Ghost to come isn't that right so
[1:56:37] therefore after the word is the spirit
[1:56:39] Elohim came down with flesh on him and
[1:56:41] give Abraham a fresh promise I will
[1:56:43] return to thee according to the time of

[1:59:59] only thing they will do is jump in their
[2:00:01] own
[2:00:03] boat them say they have their own boat
[2:00:05] they go jump in it but there was only
[2:00:07] one boat that was God
[2:00:09] constructed I believe I belong to the
[2:00:12] church I do this I do that but there's
[2:00:13] only one group that God constructed and
[2:00:16] that is not a denominational
[2:00:19] construction it's the word Construction
[2:00:22] revelation of his power constructed the
[2:00:24] boat you see God gave a revelation to
[2:00:27] Noah was build the boat of shittim wood
[2:00:30] now shittim word is a soft word an
[2:00:33] absorbent word any intellectual PhD
[2:00:37] person hear that Revelation go say it's
[2:00:39] false because that word go to sink but
[2:00:42] God tell him that word because God have
[2:00:44] a further Revelation to add that
[2:00:47] revelation God going and put Pitch on
[2:00:49] the outside and pitch on the inside to
[2:00:52] seal the boat and that is the word to
[2:00:54] absorb the
[2:00:59] ceiling that is the word to absorb the
[2:01:03] ceiling and the Seven tunders is the
[2:01:06] wood to absorb the spirit the seven
[2:01:10] Thunders is the mechanics and charity is
[2:01:13] the
[2:01:18] Dynamics oh hallelujah hallelujah so may
[2:01:22] be seated so the seven tunders is
[2:01:24] supposed to strip us of
[2:01:26] self strip us to nothing strip us like
[2:01:30] wood that God could send the
[2:01:33] spirit and seal it on the inside and
[2:01:36] seal it on the outside and the devil has
[2:01:39] no part with
[2:01:41] me oh I feel good
[2:01:44] now oh
[2:01:47] Hallelujah that was the further
[2:01:49] Revelation that God was going to break
[2:01:51] to Noah
[2:01:55] God oh man watch God constructed God
[2:02:01] watch so many prophets today telling so
[2:02:04] many different things get the people
[2:02:07] confused don't presume that's right just
[2:02:10] watch for the Vindicated promise let's
[2:02:13] go there you are Pentecostal Mr B
[2:02:15] million miles you went after sensation
[2:02:18] instead of waiting for the word to be
[2:02:20] fulfilled Hallelujah it is always the
[2:02:23] leaders that get the people out of the
[2:02:25] will of God watch it was Kora it was an
[2:02:28] uninspired leader hey Moses think he's
[2:02:31] the holy man didn't God put the spirit
[2:02:33] of Prophecy upon all these people took
[2:02:35] it over Moses and put it here so we just
[2:02:37] listen to this group Moses think he is
[2:02:39] something God told Moses separate
[2:02:41] yourself watch Moses was God leader
[2:02:45] Moses was Vindicated to be that leader
[2:02:48] all that didn't listen to him perish
[2:02:50] Jesus was God's leader
[2:02:52] the Holy Ghost is the leader and all
[2:02:55] that don't obey the Holy Ghost who wrote
[2:02:57] this Bible will perish so you know who
[2:02:59] the leader is right now the Holy Ghost
[2:03:02] not some man from anywhere else it's the
[2:03:04] Holy Ghost he was sent to lead the
[2:03:06] church isn't that right now Jesus said
[2:03:09] wait he said Isaiah 2611 said precept
[2:03:12] must be upon precept isn't that right
[2:03:15] watch They Know listen Peter jumped in
[2:03:17] and said wait a few minutes watch
[2:03:20] skipping fast
[2:03:22] Hallelujah he said Peter had to preach
[2:03:25] Hallelujah the very next day he preached
[2:03:27] on Joel in the upper room when he
[2:03:29] recognize people struggling to hold on
[2:03:32] Peter come next day and preach on Joel
[2:03:34] he said it shall come to pass in the
[2:03:35] last days I'll P my spirit and so forth
[2:03:38] they were waiting they wasn't presuming
[2:03:41] they had anything they were waiting
[2:03:43] until the scripture was made manifest oh
[2:03:46] brother I wish it wasn't this late we
[2:03:48] would like to stay a little bit they
[2:03:50] waited for scripture Authority because
[2:03:53] the scripture said how it will come you
[2:03:55] can't imagine how it going to come the
[2:03:57] scripture talk about the power the
[2:03:59] scripture talk about how it going to
[2:04:00] come they talk about there is my spirit
[2:04:03] flowing freely come on say Amen somebody
[2:04:06] the scripture speaks about it do you
[2:04:08] believe that now watch Moses one time
[2:04:12] presumed without a witness without an
[2:04:15] experience he heard words that he was to
[2:04:18] be deliverer but he didn't have the call
[2:04:21] he didn't have the experience so he
[2:04:23] presumed that he could go and take over
[2:04:25] oh Hallelujah and you know I'm the Moses
[2:04:27] he killed one man and run because he
[2:04:29] presumed that because he is supposed to
[2:04:31] be deliverer because his mother told him
[2:04:34] what God told her he had a second hand
[2:04:36] hearing God never talk to him he didn't
[2:04:38] hear direct from God so Moses went in
[2:04:41] the power of His intellect to try to
[2:04:43] deliver the people and he failed big
[2:04:45] time he fail big time but when that
[2:04:48] Pillar of Fire when that fire in the
[2:04:50] burning bush when that struck Moses
[2:04:53] there was no failing now Moses can say
[2:04:55] ain't no stopping me now I'm going
[2:04:58] straight down to pharoh I'm going to
[2:05:00] tell him let my people go I'm anointed
[2:05:04] I'm Commissioned I heard from God make
