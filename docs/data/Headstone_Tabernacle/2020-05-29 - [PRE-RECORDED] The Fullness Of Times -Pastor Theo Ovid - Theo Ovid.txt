to the Daniels up to 12 Walter Reed 1 to 4 want to look at first Corinthians chapter 10 while I read what 1 to 11 Ephesians chapter 1 when the would belong to his tree - 10 Thank You Volition's Wheaton's in Jesus name - you're welcome we tend to all doors connected to us on the internet welcome Utah Sunday morning worship fellowship unto God Daniel chapter 12 we live us 1 to 4 and at that time shall Michael stand up the Great Prince which standeth for the children of thy people and there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time and at that time thy people shall be delivered every one that shall be found written in the book many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake some to everlasting life and some to shame and everlasting contempt but Dena be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever but Thou O Daniel shut up the words and seal the book even to the time of the end many shall run to and fro knowledge shall be increased we learn from 1st Corinthians chapter 10 when I read from verse 1 moreover brethren I would not that ye should be ignorant how that all our fathers were under the cloud and all passed through the sea were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea did all eat the same spiritual meat did all drink the same spiritual drink for the drunk of that rock that followed him that rock was Christ but with many of them God was not well pleased for they were overthrown in the wilderness now these things were our examples to the intent we should not lust after evil things as they also lusted neither be idolaters as were some of them as it is written the people sat down to eat and drink and rose up the plane neither let us commit fornication as some of them committed and fell in one day three and twenty thousand neither let us tempt Christ some of them also tempted and were destroyed of the Serpent's neither murmur ye as some of them also murmured and were destroyed of the destroyer now all these things happen unto them for example and they are written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world come final scripture Ephesians chapter 3 1 we want to read from verse 3 blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ what blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ according as he had chosen us in him before the foundation of the world I wish it be wholly without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of His grace where any admittance accepted in the beloved in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of His grace wherein he had a bonded towards us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he had purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him may God bless his word you may be seated eleven this morning is always good to come into the house of God it's always good to come and hear the word of God amen our title this morning the title is the fullness of times I said I have the fullness of times a novel inspiration waitin for the manifestation of the sons of God that's the inspiration waitin for the manifestation of the sons of God in this scripture this inspiration is on Romans 8:19 it says for the illness expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the money of the sons of God annalee amplified it says for the even the whole creation all nature waits expectantly and longs endlessly for God's sons to be made known it's waiting for the revealing or the disclosing of the sonship that's not talked sure that is sonship so the creation itself is waiting for the revealing or the unfallen of the Assumption or this is tremendous just imagine the whole creation is groaning for the manifestation of the sons of God when God will pull the veil off of his sons now these are sons of God not humans at best natural people sons of God and sons have got expressed God Myra said he came unto his own his own received him not but as many as received him to them he gave power to become the sons of God not about this not Methodist not Pentecostal not you over witness not Catholic power to become not a church member power to become the sons of God sons of God talk a certain way they act a certain way they dress a certain way they live a certain way sons of God they are different they are sons of God they are not sons of men natural they're sons of God they have God's gene inside of them they have God's Germans hallelujah the other sons of God that got pickles from the earth hallelujah right in the face of the devil God chose you right and set and face you pick you up right in your condition he chose you because who in falling he called who he called sons of God he called him for our purpose he called you unto something he just doesn't call you call you under purpose don't ever let the devil take a lot of your mind you're not cause they exist you're not call them being and you're being and you're going true that's not what the call for your calls are bloodless that purpose must be accomplished hallelujah hallelujah your life is no mishap your life is no mistake what your venture is not by chance because we know if the devil don't know we know something that the devil don't know that the people don't know we know something if your family know we know something P no Romans 8:28 that all things work together for good that we know that if nobody else knows that we know that this happened that happened so what was the big deal who's the big king God is in charge he brought you automatically he set your feet on a rock the state he kept you all these years you've gotta be dead a long time ago you should be up crippled up usually packs immunity in hell a long time although but the bed of Jesus

God's mind which never could take that out never to be raised that out with job which losing jobs losing your roof losing your car whatever doesn't matter what can separate me from the love of blood that's in Christ Jesus [Applause] what a songwriter have a song it wasn't easy but it was witted but and you wasn't easy it wasn't easy for Christ but it was really with it Oh hallelujah for even who creation waits expectantly and longs endlessly for God's sons to be made known God's sons to be made known the creation is groaning for that and God's sons couldn't be made known until we come down to the fullness of time us when the time promised for God's sons to be manifested so you have seven Church ages but coming down long to the fullness of time what promise to release a message that would bring the sons of God into position that he could adopt them and place them on the earth to give their world ever one last death blow smoke in the devil face before we leave here gonna lose in this

the heavyweight championship this is good versus evil light versus darkness sons of God hallelu at the Bride of Christ versus praise for whatever the devil of the offer Oh hallelujah and Daniel said the people that know their God shall be strong and do great exploit he couldn't know God in all the ages in that kind of a way because admission wasn't fully revealed he'll only unfallen part of himself but in this last day the full thing is coming to view the full thing is unfolded now we know who he is now we know his nature now we know is being what he wants accomplish or give the Lord praise his people you don't need somebody spoon feeding you all along you will need that bridge gone you're gonna be strong this is harvest time praise God Feast of Tabernacles please of ingathering this is a harvest of what we live at four but the press wall says all these years 7475 and you're looking towards God the hardness of the seeds that you're sure that your family will be delivered that your loved ones gonna come free this is the time this is the back down this y'all were to be strong this is the Overtoun give God your highest praise [Applause] star this is an hour give got your

please God you have to be loosed you believe that the brain is God what about tears and crying forget your kit is forget crying about it we want to speak and they're gonna happen just as God spoken because quad would can't return void whatever God said it must come to pass what are you waiting for don't be caught like your Pharisees and scribes reading scripture when Jesus come to couldn't handle it yes in the Bible yes in a message and when the season change when the season turned and it was manifestation time they couldn't deal with it they wouldn't sit down their golden coach because they all knew messiahs promise they all use of internal revivalist brothers they all know what revival they all know what the prophets said that there we are manifestations the seven thunders the people fly them everywhere see the seven thunders are being manifested not talked not taught but manifested or glory to God because listen the class is treated as a time and season where everything on the heaven you could cry you got ball but when y'all come y'all come on boy injury when y'all come you're financed no demon power no sin nor sad but stopped you from point 3 from when you're come [Applause] if the devil buying you is one thing but don't bang yourself don't bang yourself who the sauna man set free is free indeed don't burn yourself [Applause] Louis my god is some of you free you could be free but it still bomb like Lazarus he was free he was raised from the dead but he said loose him and let him go want him grave clothes all around him all them get things all around him as I said preach already come on jump in so we can walk they doesn't wrap him up already so he had a culture pencil yeah lie hallelujah but he tied up he lied but he wrapped her someone you you you have I appreciate you this morning praise God I'm content loosed and get water for you call them back you're not a chicken brother looking at chicken boyfriend chicken guilty reduction brother you are eager eager was made the sauce he was mystified [Applause] [Music] America's struggling with with a man in power a position with his the question is correct at the whole office how did he get there God will not have that gold I'll have a bunch of jokers that's why the truth have God's fire all around the troll sheriffs around the throne that's why he said most carry well to just go and sit on that troll or take from that troll [Applause] approaching that troll that's different cleansers the business the seraphs idea to cleanse the worshipper hallelujah commit to being offering to God you want to offer something a God he said before he could even offer it go to a brother make it right no complicate bigger friend or friend I do know what I never want against a brother we doing that ought it's faith virtue knowledge temperance patience drawing this on the top brotherly kindness that's the spirit of forgiveness that's the fullness the seven steps that's as far as you can go because the Spirit is gone himself to come down upon you hallelujah the Spirit of God descending like a dove you can appreciate that God does but you could get up on the seven seven and that seven surface forgiveness that seven surface when you could drop your odds and the whole look rotten excuses and blame somebody and somebody and somebody you're still aiming don't down somewhere inside idea you have to get out to that getting the real spirit of forgiveness look at Jesus he said Father forgive them they know not what they do and they were like crucify him crucify him well he was higher than that here curse them here swear against them he stood us I forgive them they don't you know what they're doing they don't know what they kill him they don't know what they unfolded inside idea say time don't even know if said alone he understood he was going to leave Jesus alone but when he died shed his blood he believes the spirit no we are here and see that yeah hold us back nothing nothing nothing put a stop the sons of God from coming forth in this hour this is what the whole creation is groaning for not have a nice Church and nice just members and so on and she's anti that's not good and for Oh hallelujah whoever to rip the veil of who he is you're gonna see who he is and as your behold even become like Aaron may be seated one second on the room the banner God seeing for seeing Elijah sd1 numbered he had so long you could still hear it so long as everybody has God put boundaries you can pass so don't worry God know what to find everybody has a good one go ahead you know we're supposed to live no and I'm an hour coming how come so he's gonna have a success of Elijah when he did God call this man listen he wasn't a Nocera seminary when he called him he was plowing a field but the yoke of oxen the service taking care of his mother and father God called him to be the successor of Elijah or Elijah perhaps many up at the school thought they were sure to do going to be his successor they weren't aware his role as soon as he was finished but God does the callin God does the chosen God does the electon and God does the settin in order [Music] do you love him God has set in the church some apostles some prophets some teachers some evangelists and pastors God does that himself we cannot make one hair black or white neither can be added wanting to our stature by taking thought God in His infinite grace and by his election and foreknowledge sets these things in order and every wheel was just right I like that I would be a discouragement this morning if I didn't believe in the election and calling of God if I thought that this world was left to the outcome of it by the power of man and by the wisdom of man and by United Nations who never mentioned God's name I'd be a discouraged person but I'm not looking to that for the outcome I look to the pages of this old book here where God wrote it out and everything will come just exactly the way he said it so you're not looking for man for your own come you're not looking for uncle and Aunty and Pantheon this bishop and this ministers Association you don't look if a dad for your outcome you look

preaching cause it has the preach to the eternal lost that is just part of the church ministry Oh hallelujah hasta preach to the journalist are you with me this morning if he doesn't cut the work short for elected sick there is some that's elected seats in life we all know that they got eaten alive and if we don't cut it short for their sake no flesh shall be saved the world met said room every two thousand years we know systems as fall apart in the days of Noah you know these are Christ and so on notice spirit the dynamics of the promised Word to drive to get into the church and drag them to cover yonder and then to the rapture so he prophesied that the Spirit will come to drive us to Calvary where we have a crucifixion with Christ isn't that right praise God now you say wait a minute know what the prophets rebuke those woman and MD is the qalam woman he turns no wait a minute you write in the scriptures know a woman that lives in worldly pleasure can't be the pleasures of God so the woman that lives in worldly pleasure is dead while she's living and that's what the prophet said sin poor the woman that lives in this worldly condition is dead while she's living and if she rejects mercy she can cross a separation line where there is no place for no more and then where is she act with a painted eyes a pot here she crossed the line with nowhere to come back he has got to be listen there's got to be a ministry preach to her but remember it's all over it is done it's just a haunting there will be a ministry that will show great signs of wonders Joey said so there will be no time for redemption it's all over the lamb done took his book his redeemed is over as Jesus first preached I was rejected and then went on haunted dolls that were the air preached to them

is think of it in a minute now what if it is god forbid I got children but it looks pretty close Oh hallelujah Lois ministry all ministry done the same Noah preached exactly went into the ark now when he went in the ark there were seven days nothing happened and the testimony preached to the tomb not by speaking in tongues not by dancing in the spirit not by join in church not at the foot of the Spirit watch but it's the word listen dare it is if the only unlooked he was Messiah he was the Living Word made manifest you said a church they'll go right on just the same but remember all this time noise in the ark the bride commanded no the bride is sealed in with Christ the last member has been redeemed the sixth seal produced itself I mean no radical quick we know that judgment is not right the seventh seal brings up the tree is perfection the ministry comes to perfection when it's reduced Christ again in natural among human beings he did not say the mystic on the perfection when the militia capisce mysteries he said when Christ is represented like we've got to see Christ who's in on all flesh we got to see this would become flesh not talk not doctrine we had that for fifty years it has to be something more than that it has to be a life because that's the tongue that shakes to them or glory the could you imagine you on your job testifying about the love of God what female has come along that you're not compromising your underworld your testimony is true you're saying your testimony oh I'm a Christian so then every Sikh you want to get a drink with us you know I said I'm a

manifestation they don't have to say one word about it you see something happen positionally plays sons of God God gets in his into him to order exactly with the same thing and he just has as much authority his word is just as good as an archangel even better the son was abducted put on a high place set out the changes ropes changes colors the father a ceremony this is my son of henceforth his governor his ruler he's over all my heritage all I have belongs to him oh praise Allah that's the reason the coming of the seals at the finishing of the seventh seal the mystery of God should be finished to know who God is what he is how he lives his nature his being you are supposed to be all the way up there by that time to bring us into the full stature of the sons of God of God yeah you come right back to the mystery of the seventh seal on a little seven scene have seven thunders and he said we supposed to be all the way up there like that time or them thought you supposed to be in there spike that time what time the fullness of time when the fullest sense of tongue is time to see the manifestation of the sons of God we are waiting on it Oh glory to God hallelujah praise be to Jesus hallelujah seven see brother branham know for the endtime message this seal he revealed all the six seals but he don't say nothing about the seventh so the seventh seal is for the anti message first four seasons in history also 450 South on the altar for seal the B system and so on six-year-old quick 7c silence it dosent nothing but a seventh seal but the end time seal when it starts will be a total secret only when it sucks but at the finishing we just read that you supposed to be weight of the road no all faith and virtue and knowledge and tempers after finishing what it is for the top of the pyramid when the pyramid comes to a stop we are at the end time the opening of the seventh seal Oh glory to God so when he made man a god he gave him a domain as a zoo domain goes from sea to sea from shore to shore he had control of it and Jesus came being the one without sin he proved it when the winds blow he said peace be still so it was more than talk he proved it by manifestation isn't that right Danny said if you just see this mum can be moved though don't you shall have what you says so go back to Genesis know the world and nature is groaning moving for what for the manifestation of the sons of God when true sons born sons fill son speak and their word is backed I believe I know I started getting bored of it now see this mountain and brother desire so and so I give it to you in the name of Jesus Christ oh praise God from future Who am I almost done now in Ephesians 1:10 he said you're putting on is called the fullness of time it's called not the seven days called the fullness of time when the fullness of time has come when time has been fulfilled when there is no more time then you go into eternity after the seven churches is over Luther's ages over Methodist is over Pentecostal age is over no you go into what eternity no more severance no more trees no more other than eternity oh my that is where the fullest thing is that give me a church or we said that oh praise God hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord praise God so this commonly stone I want to close up music our please the common of the stone up when the Church of the glory cause it ended the Gentile disposition God ended it up with a comment of that stone so friends the coming of the capstone ends this Gentile dispensed and a capstone is in two parts revolution and manifestation hope we are clueless hallelujah Oh glory to God please God let the worshippers arise and the only way okay jesus said these messages to go to all the world then at the end shall be after this message go to all the world and the only way that God can preach the gospel today is true that lump of clay so God can preach the gospel to mechanical tip he has appreciate two lumps of clay thus men and that's the reason you see people have the right to come and say Lord Jesus if you only hear me no I may not be a preacher I'll talk about it I'll do everything I can you are divine I'm one of the branches and so forth okay that's what as well for them in order to preach the gospel before you can make it a gospel preach you've got to have power and demonstration of the Holy Spirit to prove the gospel the letter killeth and for the spirit make it alive so the gospel is truly the gospel when it is preached and power and demonstration could be your stand and give got some praises as we wish it the Lord I'm balancing earlier since I'm song are we gonna close oh praise the Lord let's all stand and give God some praise wanna give him praise this board or Oh hallelujah 11:30 Oh glory be
