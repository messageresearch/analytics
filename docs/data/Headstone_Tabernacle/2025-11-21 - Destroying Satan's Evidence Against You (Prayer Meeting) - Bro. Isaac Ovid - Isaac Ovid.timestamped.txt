[11:40] hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. And I
[11:45] just can't give up now.
[11:52] I've come too far from where I've
[11:56] started from all.
[12:01] Nobody told me that the road would be
[12:06] easy and I don't believe he's brought me
[12:11] this far to leave me
[12:16] singing. I
[12:19] just can't give up now.
[12:27] I've come too far from where I've
[12:30] started
[12:32] from.
[12:36] Nobody told me that the road will be
[12:42] easy. And I don't believe he's brought
[12:46] me this far to leave me. One more time.
[12:51] Oh, and I don't believe
[12:55] he's brought me this far to lead me.
[13:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:03] Blessed be the name of the Lord. Thank
[13:05] you, Lord. Thank you, brother Anthony.
[13:08] God bless you, church. It's certainly a
[13:11] great privilege to be here tonight for
[13:13] this special prayer meeting service. And
[13:16] tonight, we are going to do something a
[13:18] bit different. um still a time of
[13:21] prayer. So I encourage you um if there's
[13:24] someone you know that's supposed to be
[13:25] here that's not there, send them a
[13:27] reminder. God has something special in
[13:29] store for us tonight. Um shall we bow
[13:33] our heads for a word of prayer as we get
[13:35] ready to get started tonight.
[13:38] Our gracious heavenly father, we thank
[13:40] you for your love, for your grace, for
[13:41] your mercy, and for this 21st day of
[13:45] November. Lord who before we were even
[13:48] here already saw this entire service
[13:52] take place. Father and Lord we have come
[13:55] to a critical junction in time critical
[13:58] point Lord. Many needs many situations.
[14:01] Many people at various types of
[14:04] crossroads in their lives. Many looking
[14:07] for an answer from you. A word in due
[14:09] season Lord. A word of encouragement
[14:11] Lord.
[14:12] a a stepbystep playbook if it were on
[14:15] how to move. If they could just know the
[14:17] next step, the next two steps, the next
[14:19] three steps, Lord, what a difference it
[14:22] would be in their lives, Father. Lord,
[14:25] we have fallen short so many times and
[14:27] fallen short in so many ways, but we
[14:29] thank you that your grace tonight is
[14:31] sufficient, Lord. That you have already
[14:34] provided, Father. And Lord, for this
[14:35] time where we come together to have
[14:37] communion with you and to make our
[14:39] petitions known to you, Father, we don't
[14:41] want to just come because it's a routine
[14:43] or come because it's a ritual or show up
[14:46] because it's just something to do. But
[14:48] Lord, there's a burning desire in our
[14:50] hearts for more of you. Lord, there are
[14:52] many different types of needs in the
[14:54] body of believers here tonight. there
[14:57] Lord those that are dealing with
[14:58] different physical situations, ailments,
[15:01] diseases, sicknesses and Lord through
[15:03] your word Lord you have taught us that
[15:06] not only you are a mighty healer but
[15:08] Lord that healing is a
[15:11] church of the living God over every
[15:14] sickness, every disease, Father. So we
[15:16] come tonight Lord to Lord see we come
[15:20] tonight to cast out devils. We come
[15:22] tonight to see barriers broken and
[15:25] chains and shackles full of lives and
[15:27] homes and marriages. And Lord, we come
[15:30] to wage war tonight on the attacker, on
[15:32] the accuser tonight, Father. Lord, we
[15:35] pray for Lord, those that are looking
[15:36] for peace, that they would find peace.
[15:38] Those that are looking, Lord, to get
[15:40] their joy restored, that they would be
[15:41] restored tonight. Those that are maybe
[15:43] backsliden, maybe struggling, whatever
[15:45] it might be tonight, Father, we come to
[15:47] you, Lord, under great expectation. May
[15:49] you bless the word that we're about to
[15:51] go into, Father. May you bless those
[15:54] that are already here. May you bless
[15:55] those that are yet to join. May you
[15:57] bless those that would, Lord, watch this
[15:59] tape when it's over, Father. And Lord,
[16:01] our lives be changed and may we never be
[16:03] the same again. We commit the service
[16:06] into your hands, Lord. And Father, we
[16:08] pray a special blessing on your people
[16:09] and a special blessing on me even now in
[16:12] the precious name of Jesus Christ. And
[16:13] the church says, "Amen and amen." and
[16:16] certainly welcome one and all one more
[16:18] time and uh I will have church and then
[16:23] we will do uh we'll pray together for
[16:28] different types of situations in the
[16:30] church together. So there are different
[16:32] types of prayer meetings. Tonight will
[16:34] be one where we will agree as a church
[16:37] um on different situations. So we will
[16:39] pray for the young people. We will pray
[16:41] for those that are afflicted. We will
[16:43] pray for the widows. We will pray for
[16:45] those going through financial
[16:46] difficulties. We're going to pray for
[16:48] people are having family situations and
[16:50] we will take it section by section and
[16:52] as a church and we'll deal with each one
[16:55] as they come. And by the grace of God,
[16:58] we're looking to see God move mightily
[17:00] in our homes, move mightily in our
[17:02] situations. Um, brother Random taught us
[17:04] you got to do something for something to
[17:06] happen, you know. So sometimes when you
[17:08] switch up things uh and you move in an
[17:10] unexpected way, you get an unexpected
[17:13] result. So I have a thought for tonight
[17:16] and by the grace of God, I I am praying
[17:18] that this would be an encouragement to
[17:20] us. Uh the title is destroying Satan's
[17:23] evidence against you.
[17:26] Destroying Satan's evidence against you.
[17:31] You know, and I believe that there's
[17:33] something in this for us. um Satan holds
[17:36] evidence against us and you know in the
[17:39] natural if there's a court case you know
[17:41] and you have the players of the court
[17:44] you know in position there's a judge
[17:46] there's a person who is accused there's
[17:49] the prosecutor there's a lawyer and
[17:51] there comes a point in time when
[17:53] evidence need to be presented because if
[17:55] you do not present evidence there is no
[17:58] case you cannot hold someone to account
[18:01] on hears say well she told me and I
[18:04] heard around the corner. That is not a
[18:06] testimony. A testimony hased with
[18:09] evidence and as often the
[18:13] what typically happens is the case has
[18:15] to be thrown out. All right? So in the
[18:18] natural system, you know, certain
[18:21] criminals want to get rid of the
[18:22] evidence because if you know if they get
[18:23] rid of the evidence, then there is no
[18:25] case. But I'm putting it to us tonight
[18:27] that we could destroy Satan's evidence
[18:31] against us. And that is taken in context
[18:34] because the Bible describes Satan as the
[18:36] accuser of the brethren. And if you look
[18:38] into that accuser is really legal
[18:41] prosecution. So and the Bible said he
[18:43] stands day and night accusing the
[18:45] brethren. Which means when you are not
[18:47] praying, there's an accusation against
[18:48] you. When you wake up in the morning,
[18:50] there's an accusation against you. When
[18:51] you go to your job, there's an
[18:53] accusation against you. In the court of
[18:55] heaven, Satan is walking around saying,
[18:57] "Look at what she did. Look at what he
[18:59] said. Look at what he did. Look at what
[19:01] he said. And when you really understand
[19:03] the context of prayer, that prayer is
[19:06] making a plea or a request with the
[19:09] belief, the hope, the expectation that
[19:12] that request will be answered. It paints
[19:14] an entirely different picture of what
[19:16] you're trying to achieve. Can the church
[19:18] say amen? So, let's go. Every believer
[19:21] has an opportunity to be heard. So,
[19:24] we're going to use a number of legal
[19:25] frameworks tonight because there's a
[19:27] legal basis for prayer. Many of us, we
[19:29] pray on emotion. We pray, you know,
[19:32] using the when you understand prayer as
[19:35] a legal right, a legal environment, a
[19:38] legal framework, the picture begins to
[19:41] change. Can the church say amen? So
[19:44] every believer has a right to be heard.
[19:46] So in legal terms, there's something
[19:48] called a hearing where he could hear
[19:50] what's going on. Are we together? We are
[19:52] not talking about the courtroom now of
[19:54] earth, court of heaven. And this is not
[19:57] just a metaphor but in Isaiah 33 and
[20:01] verse 22 it says for the Lord is our
[20:03] judge. The Lord is our lawgiver. The
[20:07] Lord is our king. He will save us. So
[20:09] there are three words in this that
[20:10] begins to paint a picture of the legal
[20:13] framework within which God operates. I
[20:15] want us to remember God doesn't operate
[20:17] with emotion. He doesn't he doesn't
[20:19] operate and wake up and feel something
[20:20] about us. There is a law that he is
[20:22] guided by. There is legal precedent that
[20:25] he is guided by. This is why the prophet
[20:27] would say if God heals someone and on
[20:30] the same basis someone that does that
[20:31] today he has to do it again. He's the
[20:33] same yesterday, today and forever. God
[20:35] honors his law, he honors his word. He
[20:36] honors honors his covenant. But for our
[20:39] Lord is our judge. The Lord is our
[20:41] lawgiver. The Lord is our king. He will
[20:43] save us. We have three words. Judge,
[20:45] lawgiver, king. We're talking about
[20:47] government. We're talking about court
[20:50] throne. And I would have preached a
[20:52] message some time ago as it is in
[20:54] heaven. Thy will be done on earth as it
[20:56] is in heaven. Prayer is not a
[20:58] terrestrial thing. It's not an earthly
[21:00] thing. It is really you reaching into
[21:02] heaven so that the will that is
[21:03] established in heaven could be
[21:05] manifested on earth. Are we together? So
[21:07] once you break into the realm of the
[21:08] heavenlies and your prayer becomes
[21:10] accepted or you in the room or presence
[21:12] of God so that we could have a
[21:14] conversation around what you request. If
[21:16] it is granted and God's will is
[21:18] expressed in heaven, it must be
[21:20] expressed on earth. And if God's will
[21:22] about your healing is expressed in
[21:24] heaven as it is in heaven, it will be
[21:26] reflected here on earth. So your healing
[21:29] has to take place in the heavenly realm
[21:31] to see it on earth. Your presence here
[21:33] is because you are somewhere else. Are
[21:36] we together? So as it is in heaven, we
[21:38] have this earthly reflection of it. So
[21:41] your prayer, we're not trying to get
[21:43] your prayer heard in earth. Cornelius
[21:46] had a memorial for his prayers in
[21:47] heaven. The issue is not about the
[21:49] prayer on earth. The issue is the
[21:51] activity in heaven. Prayers are answered
[21:54] not on earth. Prayers are answered in
[21:56] heaven. Thy will be done in earth as it
[21:58] is in heaven. So before we can even take
[22:01] this further, we have to firstly
[22:03] understand our rights because not
[22:05] everybody could pray.
[22:09] That might sound strange but people
[22:11] could have words but your prayer don't
[22:14] have to be received or accepted. Not
[22:16] everybody can access the throne room
[22:18] because when you really reach into
[22:19] understanding that prayer the word we
[22:21] use as prayer is going before the Lord
[22:24] to make a request because that that that
[22:26] is what that what we're trying to do.
[22:27] You want healing but you can't just go
[22:29] and say Lord I'm looking for healing. Is
[22:31] there a legal basis for your healing? Is
[22:34] there a legal basis? Because when we
[22:36] talk about the enforcement of the Holy
[22:38] Spirit for an enforcer to operate there
[22:40] must be a legal construct for the
[22:42] enforcer to operate. If you're trying to
[22:44] kick someone out of your home, you need
[22:46] to have a document that empowers the
[22:49] baiff to take action. So many of us, we
[22:52] approach God in prayer, but if we don't
[22:54] understand the legal context of prayer,
[22:56] the legal framework in which we operate,
[22:58] then there is no in we words and there's
[23:02] nothing to act upon. But the moment you
[23:04] begin to understand your right, the
[23:06] moment you begin to understand your
[23:07] privilege is the moment you can begin to
[23:09] activate the legal structure that
[23:12] activates enforcement. Are we together?
[23:14] So many of us, we are looking for
[23:15] healing, but we haven't activated our
[23:17] legal right
[23:19] to clean up the home, clean up our
[23:21] environment. I'm getting excited just
[23:23] seeing the unfolding of this. So Hebrews
[23:26] 4:16, we're talking about some of the
[23:28] rights to the throne and the rights as
[23:31] sons and daughters. So that when we
[23:33] pray, we are praying with authority.
[23:35] Many of us be praying Lord bless me and
[23:37] do Lord Jennifer and but there's no
[23:39] legal argument and we'll see why God
[23:42] looks at prayer as a legal argument.
[23:46] Hebrews 4:16 let us therefore come
[23:49] boldly unto the throne of grace that we
[23:52] may obtain mercy and find grace to help
[23:54] in time of need. Now I want us to
[23:57] remember that the topic the subject
[23:59] tonight is destroying Satan's evidence
[24:02] against you. All right. So Hebrews 4:16,
[24:05] let us therefore come boldly. So there's
[24:08] nothing like coming to God weak, coming
[24:10] to God temptative, coming to God with
[24:13] let us therefore come boldly unto the
[24:15] throne of grace. So we see in the throne
[24:18] we seen is a throne of grace that we may
[24:20] obtain mercy and find grace to help in
[24:23] time of need. I know there are many
[24:25] tonight who need help in time of need.
[24:28] There are many who need help and it's a
[24:30] time of need.
[24:32] has a legal permission to approach the
[24:35] throne. This is why I make the statement
[24:37] not everybody could pray because if you
[24:39] don't have access to the throne then you
[24:41] could say whatever you want but if you
[24:43] have access to the throne by right as a
[24:45] believer that puts you in an entirely
[24:48] different position approaching the
[24:50] throne boldly. Now I want to read that
[24:53] same scripture in the amplified.
[24:56] Therefore, let us with privilege, in
[24:59] other words, there is a privilege that
[25:01] comes with your sunship. There's a
[25:02] privilege that comes with you as a
[25:04] daughter of God, with your approach to
[25:05] God. Therefore, let us with privilege
[25:09] approach the throne of grace. That is
[25:11] the throne of God's gracious favor with
[25:15] confidence and without fear. so that we
[25:18] may receive mercy for our failures and
[25:21] find his amazing grace to help in time
[25:25] of need and appropriate blessing coming
[25:28] just at the right moment. That is an
[25:31] encouragement to us. Can the church say
[25:32] amen? So there's a right. So I trying to
[25:35] paint a picture, brother Clarence, of
[25:37] this courtroom, this court scene for
[25:39] which the believer has access to this
[25:41] room by right of being able to boldly
[25:45] access the throne of grace to accept
[25:47] mercy to receive mercy. In Philippians,
[25:50] the Bible says, "For our conversation is
[25:53] in heaven." We're talking about this
[25:55] heavenly conversation from when's all
[25:57] the savior. In the amplified, this same
[26:00] scripture church says, "But we are
[26:03] different because our citizenship is in
[26:05] heaven."
[26:07] That's what that means. Your
[26:08] citizenship. So you are not a citizen of
[26:11] Trinidad. You're not a citizen of
[26:13] America. You're not a citizen of Africa.
[26:15] You're not a citizen of Europe. But for
[26:17] our conversation is in heaven. This is
[26:20] your right of citizenship. So we are
[26:23] talking now going beyond your
[26:24] situations, your failures, your
[26:26] challenges to understand the right, the
[26:29] legal framework of prayer, the legal
[26:32] basis of prayer. Let's go on your right
[26:35] of representation. We have an advocate
[26:38] with the Lord Jesus Christ. All right.
[26:41] So in first John 2 verse one, we have an
[26:45] advocate with the father, Jesus Christ,
[26:47] the righteous. So, it's a context and
[26:49] legally we're building a legal case
[26:51] because we're talking about we're
[26:52] talking about here destroying Satan's
[26:54] evidence against you. So, we're going to
[26:55] come to the case in in a in a short
[26:58] while.
[26:59] The right to use his name. So, within
[27:01] the legal power, the power of attorney
[27:05] gives you the ability to as if you are
[27:08] the person.
[27:10] So when somebody attorney you could go
[27:12] into the bank and withdraw from their
[27:14] account because the bank sees you
[27:16] because of the power of attorney
[27:19] or whatever rights was assigned to the
[27:21] power of attorney to. So somebody could
[27:24] be going overseas or whatever it is and
[27:27] they leave you in charge and they leave
[27:28] a power of attorney that in their
[27:31] absence you can do business on their
[27:33] behalf and nobody could authority your
[27:36] legal authority because you have a power
[27:39] of attorney. In the same context when
[27:42] the Bible says whatsoever you ask in my
[27:45] name that is power of attorney. You
[27:48] begin to understand these principles,
[27:50] your approach to the throne, the
[27:52] boldness with which you could come, the
[27:55] authority of your citizenship, the fact
[27:57] that you have representation, the fact
[27:59] that you have a name within which you
[28:01] could ask with a power of attorney,
[28:04] which means demons have to respect the
[28:05] power of attorney. They don't have to
[28:07] respect you. They need to respect the
[28:08] power of attorney because the power of
[28:10] attorney gives you power of the person
[28:12] who wrote the power of attorney. Are we
[28:13] together? Which means this is the
[28:15] difference brother Brandon say between
[28:17] like power and authority. The policeman
[28:18] can't stop the bus but the uniform that
[28:21] he wears represents the power of the
[28:23] state the power of the country.
[28:26] So the power of attorney now you could
[28:28] now sit in your home and you could pray
[28:30] you could bring a request and demons
[28:32] trembling but they don't want you to
[28:33] know about the power of attorney. They
[28:35] want you to look at your condition, your
[28:37] situation, your mistakes, your faith.
[28:40] Meime
[28:42] is a power of attorney that if you pick
[28:44] up the power of attorney, say in my
[28:46] name, you shall cast out devils. Are we
[28:49] together tonight? Because tonight we're
[28:52] going to cast out some devils. Tonight
[28:53] we're going to shake things up in our
[28:55] homes, shake things up in our situations
[28:57] because we are coming boldly. We
[28:59] understand who we are. We understand the
[29:00] authority that's been given to us. We
[29:02] understand our rights as citizens. We
[29:04] understand the power that comes with the
[29:06] word. We understand that the revealing
[29:07] of the word, the opening of the
[29:08] mysteries, the breaking of the seals,
[29:10] the seven seal and all these things give
[29:12] us divine access not just into the mind
[29:14] of God but the authority of God by power
[29:17] of attorney. Are we together?
[29:20] I want to build a little bit talking
[29:22] about the right to present evidence. Now
[29:25] in a court case there is given an
[29:27] opportunity for you to say something
[29:29] about yourself. So if you are on trial
[29:31] and there is an accuser, he say brother
[29:34] Clarence did this, brother Clarence did
[29:35] this, brother Clarence did this. This is
[29:36] this is the accuser job. He did this.
[29:38] Your lawyer has a right to defend you.
[29:41] The prosecutor has a right to speak. But
[29:43] they also say brother Clarence what you
[29:45] have to say about yourself. And you
[29:47] could choose at that point to stay quiet
[29:50] or you could choose well I want to
[29:52] speak. Listen to
[29:55] this in Isaiah 43 from verse 21.
[30:00] God is speaking. He's saying, "This
[30:02] people have I formed for myself. They
[30:05] shall show forth my praise.
[30:07] Thou hast not called upon me, oh Jacob,
[30:10] for thou has been weary of me, O
[30:12] Israel." So God is saying, "Oh yeah,
[30:14] call me because all I waiting for is to
[30:17] be called." He say, "You haven't called
[30:18] me. Thou has not brought me the small
[30:21] cattle of thy burnt offerings." Talking
[30:23] about your sacrifices, your offering of
[30:25] these things. Neither hast thou honored
[30:27] me with thy
[30:29] I have not caused thee to serve with an
[30:31] offering, nor wearied thee with incense.
[30:34] Thou has brought me no sweet cane with
[30:36] money, neither hast thou filled me with
[30:38] the fat of thy sacrifices, but thou hast
[30:41] made me to serve thy with thy sins. Thou
[30:44] has wearied me with thine iniquities.
[30:46] There's a whole Bible study. I will
[30:48] delay for another time. I want to go
[30:50] deeper because that is a whole teaching
[30:52] there. God goes on, "Even I am he that
[30:56] blotth out thy transgression for mine
[30:59] own sake and will not remember thy
[31:02] sins." This is the verse that I want to
[31:04] get here. Verse 26 of Isaiah 43, it
[31:08] says, "Put me in remembrance.
[31:11] Let us plead together, declare thou that
[31:15] thou mayest be justified." This in
[31:18] scripture is what you have to say about
[31:20] yourself in the amplified. This means
[31:24] remind me of your merits with a thorough
[31:28] report.
[31:30] Let us plead and argue our case
[31:32] together. State your position that you
[31:36] may be proved right. So this squarely
[31:40] puts you into a courtroom where if you
[31:43] understand the law, you have a right
[31:46] with the knowledge of the law to remind
[31:49] God. So this is why through scripture
[31:52] you see people praying Lord you said
[31:56] Lord you promised that is legal
[31:58] framework they are actually tapping into
[32:00] legal precedent because if God said his
[32:03] word is law you said you based on your
[32:07] word I am bringing to your remembrance.
[32:11] So the scripture says in the in the King
[32:13] James put me in. So God is saying
[32:15] reminder of my promise to you. Put me in
[32:19] remembrance. You have a right to come to
[32:22] God to remind God. But Lord, you
[32:24] promised me my children. You promised me
[32:27] my health. You promised me my family.
[32:29] You promised me good success. You
[32:31] promised me adoption. You promised me
[32:33] perfection. I didn't promise myself. I
[32:36] am reminding you. And God is inviting
[32:38] you tonight to remind him. He said, "Put
[32:41] me in remembrance." It is your right to
[32:44] keep reminding God.
[32:46] Not that God forgets, but as a good
[32:49] lawyer, as a good someone who knows the
[32:53] knowledge of the law and the way the law
[32:55] works. He said, "Put me in remembrance.
[32:57] Let us plead together." So God wants a
[33:00] legal back and forth because this law
[33:03] shall not depart from thee. This is
[33:05] scripture. I'm painting the legal
[33:07] framework. This law shall not depart
[33:08] from thee, but meditate on it day and
[33:10] night. God wants you to have good sound
[33:13] knowledge of doctrine, of order, of
[33:16] scripture. Not just of doing things
[33:18] blindly, but doing things with a
[33:20] clinical understanding of the grounds
[33:22] upon which you stand. Because when you
[33:24] have that understanding, then you could
[33:26] summon the enforcer with the legal
[33:28] request of the enforcer. Are we
[33:30] together? Remind me of your merits with
[33:34] a thorough report. for
[33:37] me mean not just partial healing, not
[33:39] just a partial deliverance, but a total
[33:41] deliverance
[33:43] and based on your word of a total
[33:45] deliverance. Why are your people not
[33:47] healed? Why are your people not
[33:48] delivered? So we are bringing it, we are
[33:50] putting it to you under the law. We are
[33:52] bringing it to your remembrance of your
[33:54] word, your promise, your decree
[33:56] concerning this end time people. your
[33:59] promise decree about this end time
[34:01] bride, your word, your power, about my
[34:04] finances, about my family, about my
[34:06] situation, about every single promise. I
[34:09] am bringing it up as evidence. I am
[34:11] presenting my case. The Bible says in
[34:13] the amplified, remind me of your merits
[34:16] with a thorough report. Let us plead and
[34:19] argue our case together. State your
[34:22] position
[34:24] tonight. Can you state it? Can you make
[34:26] clear what you want? Do you know what
[34:27] you want? Can you state it? Can you
[34:29] articulate it? State your position that
[34:31] you may be proved right. Can we Can we
[34:33] go on? Is this We going somewhere? We
[34:37] want to destroy Satan's evidence. We are
[34:39] in a courtroom tonight. The stage is
[34:41] set. The judge is on the throne.
[34:46] The Lord himself is your lawyer.
[34:49] You are the one on trial. You are the
[34:51] one with the request and the accuser who
[34:54] is supposed to be there. Because you
[34:56] can't have a courtroom without a
[34:57] prosecutor. There must be a prosecutor.
[35:00] And the Bible creates provision for the
[35:02] prosecutor by saying the devil is the
[35:04] accuser of the brethren. So we know the
[35:06] prosecutor is not the pastor. The
[35:08] prosecutor is not the deacon. The
[35:10] prosecutor is at another church. The
[35:11] prosecutor is the devil. He is the
[35:13] official sanctioned designated
[35:16] permissioned authorized accuser of the
[35:18] brethren. His whole existence is tied to
[35:21] telling God because he is accusing you
[35:24] before God. Are we together? His job is
[35:28] to go to God and say, "Look what he did.
[35:31] Look what he said. Look why you
[35:33] shouldn't bless him. Look why you
[35:35] shouldn't heal him." Are we together,
[35:38] the
[35:40] So rights now. Daniel 7:22
[35:44] the Bible says until the ancient of days
[35:47] and judgment was given to the saints of
[35:50] the most high and the time came that the
[35:53] saints possessed the kingdom
[35:56] was there judge was given to and
[35:58] judgment given to is mean in favor of in
[36:02] other words the bible is saying that in
[36:04] the amplified until the ancients of days
[36:06] came and judgment was passed in favor in
[36:09] other words judgment is going to come in
[36:14] this thing because we know who is the
[36:16] judge and we know the judge and your
[36:17] lawyer
[36:20] is the same. So the judge in your favor,
[36:23] the lawyer in your favor, but you have a
[36:25] small piece to do because the part of
[36:28] destroying the evidence against you is
[36:30] on you. God not in the evidence
[36:33] destroying business. But there is
[36:35] provision in the word for the
[36:37] destruction of the evidence. Are we
[36:38] together? Because the devil bringing
[36:41] evidence and we want to unlock the key
[36:43] tonight of how you could destroy the
[36:45] evidence so this case could get
[36:46] dismissed tonight. God has to say case
[36:49] dismissed. The the attorney, your
[36:51] attorney is saying he's asking, but the
[36:54] accuser not swinging his hands randomly
[36:57] saying things. He is bringing evidence.
[36:59] But tonight we want to speak to what you
[37:01] need to case. Tonight we come to blow up
[37:04] the devil case against your family, the
[37:06] devil case against your home. The devil
[37:08] must say, "Nah, boy. I thought I had
[37:10] them cornered, but it looked like all
[37:12] the evidence I had just gone." How do we
[37:15] destroy the evidence? Are we Are we
[37:17] together? Right.
[37:19] Hallelujah.
[37:21] So, you are not a victim in the
[37:23] courtroom. You defendant with no
[37:25] defense. You are not at the mercy of the
[37:28] accuser. You have legal rights. You have
[37:30] legal recourse. You have legal access.
[37:33] This has nothing to do with your sins,
[37:35] your mistakes, and your failures. We're
[37:36] going to get to that in a minute. What I
[37:37] want you to understand is the rights.
[37:39] Because if you understand your rights
[37:40] and it can move a certain way, the judge
[37:43] is your father. Your the the attorney is
[37:45] the son. The holy spirit is the
[37:47] counselor or the guide. So the odds are
[37:49] stacked in your favor. The constitution
[37:52] is the word of God.
[37:54] The enforcement are the angels. You have
[37:57] everything you need to win. It's just
[37:59] one thing we need to deal with. The
[38:00] evidence that Satan has against you.
[38:06] Can the church say amen?
[38:09] I want to remind us that the accuser of
[38:11] the brethren the Bible said accuse them
[38:12] before God you sleeping they writing and
[38:15] know look what you do look what she say
[38:19] look where he went
[38:21] every this day and night accusing before
[38:24] God know
[38:26] evidence against us you never think of
[38:28] it that way every day the devil get he
[38:32] say look I got next piece with the file
[38:35] look what you do operating in the file
[38:37] He because that's what a lawyer does. If
[38:39] a prosecutor wants to wants to give to
[38:41] to throw the book at you as they would
[38:43] say, they have to make a good case. The
[38:45] devil are trying to make a weak case and
[38:47] his years experience. You now come to
[38:48] the earth is thousands of years. He
[38:51] willing case he has been prosecuting
[38:54] this one. Prosecuting he prosecute
[38:56] everybody. He's the one pro longest
[38:58] serving prosecutor in the history of
[38:59] civilization. So when he bring a case
[39:01] against you, brother Popwell, he come
[39:03] with one piece of paper.
[39:05] 900 piece of paper.
[39:07] Look what you think. Look what you do.
[39:09] Look what you say. Look how you feel.
[39:10] Look how you lash out. Look how this
[39:11] this and all this evidence night. We
[39:14] coming to blow up the evidence.
[39:17] Because the devil cannot overpower you.
[39:19] He cannot rule you. He cannot override
[39:21] the blood because the blood does destroy
[39:23] evidence.
[39:29] He and evidence could swallow your case.
[39:32] Now, if you don't deal with the
[39:33] evidence, your case in trouble, some of
[39:35] us be trying to pray tonight or pray in
[39:37] a prayer meeting and the devil's while
[39:39] you praying, he pointing to to the
[39:41] evidence.
[39:43] But if you could pray and we could
[39:44] remove the evidence, then your prayer
[39:46] goes straight through with no
[39:47] resistance. There's no rebuttal because
[39:49] the evidence but request this is why he
[39:51] shouldn't get this request. This is why
[39:52] the house is not his own. And you have a
[39:54] piece of evidence. This is why healing
[39:55] is not his own. This is why a
[39:57] breakthrough financially is not his own
[39:58] because I have some evidence to say why
[40:00] he shouldn't get it. I want us to get
[40:02] the picture very very clear because
[40:04] we're going to speak in a bit around how
[40:06] we blow up this evidence.
[40:10] So let's begin to build. Now I trust
[40:12] this is helping us a little bit. So what
[40:15] kind of evidence does the devil hold
[40:16] against us? That now becomes the
[40:18] question because this evidence against
[40:20] us is what's impacting our prayer lives,
[40:23] impacting our spiritual growth, our
[40:25] spiritual progress. You could know all
[40:27] the mysteries but if you not getting
[40:28] your prayer answered your life not
[40:30] changing then you have to look at the
[40:31] evidence because the evidence is what
[40:33] the devil is holding against you.
[40:36] I want to thank brother George Kangali
[40:38] for sharing this quote. But Ram said do
[40:41] you know that even your own behavior can
[40:44] knock somebody else out of getting
[40:47] healed? Your misbehavior
[40:50] of
[40:52] believers can cause this church to
[40:54] bitterly fail.
[40:56] I want to read this quote one more time
[40:57] from the message adoption. Thank you,
[40:58] brother George. Do you know that even
[41:00] your own behavior can knock somebody
[41:03] else out of getting healed? Your
[41:06] misbehavior of unconfessed sins of your
[41:09] believers can cause this church to heal.
[41:12] That's what the prophet said.
[41:15] What evidence you want to talk about
[41:17] that the devil holds against you is
[41:19] unconfessed sin.
[41:21] David in Psalm 66:18 says, "If I regard
[41:25] iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not
[41:28] hear me."
[41:31] In the amplified
[41:34] that says, "If I regard sin and baseness
[41:37] in my heart, that is if I know it is
[41:40] there and do nothing,
[41:42] God will not hear me."
[41:45] So you see the whole aspect of the
[41:47] devil's file that is your issue that you
[41:50] haven't confessed. The moment you
[41:52] confess it and bring it under the blood
[41:54] that blow up that section of the man
[41:56] book all them papers disintegrate
[41:59] because once you holding unconfessed sin
[42:01] in your heart he over you. But the
[42:05] moment you confess your sins put it
[42:07] under the blood that blood wash that
[42:10] situation sea of forgetfulness. When the
[42:12] devil reach in the fire to pull it out,
[42:13] he say I thought I had it. You know,
[42:15] your honor, I'm so sorry. I thought I
[42:17] brought it into the room this morning,
[42:18] but somehow I searching inside of here
[42:20] and I cannot find it and the devil don't
[42:22] even realize that a little while ago you
[42:25] had to put it under the blood. You say,
[42:26] "Lord, forgive me. Lord, I'm so sorry.
[42:29] Lord, I want to confess it." Brother
[42:31] Brandham in a prayer said, "Lord, if
[42:33] there's any sin, this is in the message
[42:36] by faith. Lord, if there's any sin,
[42:39] naked and unconfessed, we would ask
[42:41] thee, oh Lord, that you would apply the
[42:43] blood of thy son Jesus to such a place.
[42:46] for realizing that we in ourselves are
[42:48] insufficient and there it is impossible
[42:52] for us to ever be self- sustaining. But
[42:54] we rely completely upon his precious
[42:57] blood and his grace to apply to our
[42:59] account that we unworthy sinners might
[43:02] come boldly someday into thy presenceing
[43:06] before us this blood of the Lord Jesus.
[43:10] Bring this blood with you which thou in
[43:12] thy times past has recognized it. thy
[43:16] only begotten son and has made the
[43:18] promise that through him if we confess
[43:20] our sins we shall be justified by his
[43:23] grace.
[43:25] So for you in this room tonight and
[43:26] those who would hear this tape, if you
[43:29] have secret sin, unconfessed sin, thing
[43:31] you have been hiding and you tonight,
[43:34] God, tonight bring it up tonight.
[43:37] Confess it tonight. Make it right and
[43:40] you will see that whole
[43:43] we are destroying the evidence tonight.
[43:46] Are we together?
[43:50] Do the unexpected.
[43:52] We look him something tremendous. Don't
[43:56] walk around crippled. Don't walk around
[43:57] with your situation. Bring it under the
[43:59] blood. Expose the devil. Let's expose
[44:01] him tonight.
[44:03] It's better to expose him and see a
[44:05] healing or it's better to ex see a
[44:07] breakthrough. You don't even realize who
[44:10] you holding back yourself. But tonight
[44:12] we exposing the devil tonight. And in so
[44:14] doing is he will lose his power to
[44:17] present anything to you. Because when
[44:19] the devil say but he he fall here and he
[44:21] fall here and God say well and what I
[44:22] don't know that he present it he confess
[44:24] it only the blood I can't see it again
[44:26] you have anything else
[44:28] what what what else you have because he
[44:31] don't confess it listen when you confess
[44:33] it is no surprise God knows all things
[44:36] already but the act of confessing it
[44:38] when you confess it the devil can't
[44:40] present well you know I know something
[44:41] about him I know something well tell me
[44:44] something I don't know because
[44:48] Everybody with me? When you start, in
[44:51] other words, we we we unraveling what
[44:53] the devil trying to hold against you,
[44:54] you know. And the thing is when you
[44:56] don't confess, you hold it is a guilt.
[44:58] It heavy. It weighing you down. You're
[45:01] trying to pray, trying to break through,
[45:02] but this thing pressing you because
[45:05] right, you know you're not operating in
[45:07] your in your zone. You're not you know
[45:08] you're not in your spiritual realm. You
[45:10] know you're doing what you're not
[45:11] supposed to do. But the moment you say,
[45:12] "Lord, this is it. I'm confessing it.
[45:14] I'm putting it behind me. and putting it
[45:16] under the blood. This is it. It is over.
[45:18] The devil lose that aspect.
[45:22] Let's go on the whole next section. We
[45:25] know this scripture, but I'm placing it
[45:27] now in the context of the evidence that
[45:30] the devil could present. When you stand
[45:32] praying, forgive if you have ought
[45:33] against any that your father which also
[45:36] your father also in heaven may forgive
[45:38] you your trespasses. When you hold a
[45:41] ought that devil could use against you.
[45:44] Lord don't don't grant this prayer for
[45:46] this one because this they have they
[45:49] have a ought. So when we talk about you
[45:52] drop your drop your drop your you seen
[45:54] it on a one-dimensional level. Oh go I
[45:57] have to forgive him. I really need to
[45:58] forgive him. You really understand what
[46:00] you do. This is not about what he doing
[46:02] what you do. That same oath you don't
[46:05] drop is sitting on a file in the devil
[46:08] legal library. The devil whoever
[46:10] parallegal pulling that look the one he
[46:13] forgive and as long as we have this on
[46:14] record we know because the Bible say
[46:17] your father because they have legal
[46:20] precedent to present to the Lord and say
[46:21] listen look the ought how you could
[46:23] forgive him and he don't forgive
[46:27] because there's a law we dealing with
[46:28] legal precedent and under the law this
[46:31] is the word the word is God's law when
[46:33] you stand praying forgive if you have
[46:35] ought against any that your father which
[46:37] also which is in heaven may forgive you
[46:38] your trespasses is the devil believes
[46:41] you know an
[46:43] scriptures you don't know he knows he's
[46:46] a prosecutor he's a lawyer so he not
[46:50] coming on whim and fancy and I have an
[46:51] idea and a thought and a thing this I
[46:53] think that no he is taking the same law
[46:55] the same scripture you and I have access
[46:57] to and taking this same scripture and
[47:00] presenting it and say how God can you
[47:02] bless him dropped his
[47:05] so for all of the teaching you have
[47:07] heard of dropping alt that You see
[47:09] onedimensional me and him and she and me
[47:12] in this natural humanistic realm in the
[47:15] spiritual realm as it is in heaven
[47:19] saying look look they are forgiving and
[47:21] when brother Brandham say if he could
[47:23] just leave them to fight the devil have
[47:25] no work to do but if you get them to
[47:27] forgive then you
[47:29] break Satan's power he have no he could
[47:32] no longer bring that as an accusation
[47:34] against you so I challenge you tonight
[47:37] before we get into prayer Drop the art.
[47:39] I don't care what it is. Drop it
[47:40] tonight. Drop it tonight. This is not
[47:43] about you and them anymore. This is
[47:45] about removing the ability of the devil
[47:47] to use this against you. I'll say that
[47:49] again. This is bigger than you and I,
[47:51] friends. This is bigger than the
[47:53] problem, the issue you think you have
[47:54] with somebody and somebody have with
[47:56] you. That is a one that lowlevel
[47:58] transaction we talking about. We're
[47:59] going for bigger things. We want to
[48:01] dismantle the works of darkness. And by
[48:04] you dropping the ord, forgiving your
[48:07] brother, forgiving your sister, you
[48:09] forever break the power of Satan over
[48:11] your home. Satan has permission to come
[48:15] into your home when you have a
[48:19] Can I say that again? The devil has
[48:21] legal right to enter your home when you
[48:23] have a ought.
[48:26] So when you're trying to get a
[48:27] breakthrough and you holding and
[48:28] grudges, you are opening passageways for
[48:31] the devil to walk freely inside your
[48:32] house.
[48:33] But the moment you drop your you are
[48:36] removing the access points. You're
[48:37] giving the devil no space, no room,
[48:40] nothing to move with. Because as the
[48:42] accuser of the brethren, if you give him
[48:44] nothing to accuse you of by dismantling
[48:46] his strategies, your whole life begins
[48:48] to change. So we have established two
[48:52] things. We have already
[48:54] the the the the evidence or destroying
[48:57] the evidence that Satan has against us
[48:59] is firstly get rid of the unconfessing.
[49:02] Get rid and and that also means get
[49:03] ready your pride because people walking
[49:05] around and because they're trying to
[49:07] have a good impression and they don't
[49:08] want nobody to know that how bad things
[49:10] really are and how they mess up and they
[49:12] fall. Everybody in this room fall
[49:13] there's nobody holier than thou. There's
[49:15] nobody better than anybody else. What we
[49:18] dealing with is dismantling Satan's
[49:20] ability to move as if it's his house.
[49:24] And when you serious about change and
[49:26] serious about God and you will create an
[49:29] atmosphere and environment to God to
[49:31] move freely and you say Lord there's
[49:32] something in me that shouldn't be there
[49:33] take it out and if something needs to be
[49:35] exposed expose it tonight I don't care
[49:37] who knows I don't
[49:40] because one God could take you to
[49:43] another level God could restore your
[49:46] name as we said in the last Bible study
[49:48] by the time Mphibicheth was there
[49:49] sitting at the king's table they
[49:51] couldn't see his lameness anymore you
[49:52] walk into the He's at the king's table.
[49:54] Who want to talk about Elimna? People
[49:56] wish the king's the Lord restores you.
[49:59] Who could destroy that? When the Lord
[50:01] promote you, who could who could remove
[50:02] that? The Lord said he will eat at my
[50:04] table continually all the time. First
[50:07] access. Make sure you have a seat before
[50:10] all the fancy guests at the king's
[50:11] table. Not the king's room, the king's
[50:13] table. Not in the banquet hall. The
[50:15] king's table. The same table that King
[50:17] David's sitting on on.
[50:19] Let us shake our pride. shake the issues
[50:22] or to move. We have too much sick people
[50:24] in the room tonight, too much situations
[50:26] in the room tonight that unconfessed sin
[50:32] that ought and grudges holding up the
[50:35] ability of God to enforce legal rights.
[50:37] God wants to heal. He is a healer. The
[50:39] problem is not God.
[50:42] Problem is not God. He's a healer. That
[50:44] we know for sure. But the things that we
[50:46] can do because God not coming to forgive
[50:48] on your behalf. God don't come to
[50:50] confess your sins. You have to confess.
[50:52] You have to make things right. You have
[50:54] to be willing tonight to say, "I'm ready
[50:55] to do what it takes because I'm looking
[50:57] for God to move." Can the church say,
[50:58] "Amen."
[51:03] That same scripture that we know in the
[51:05] amplified
[51:06] says, "Whenever you stand praying, if
[51:08] you have anything against anyone,
[51:10] forgive him. Drop the issue. Let it go.
[51:14] so that your father who is in heaven
[51:15] will also forgive you of your
[51:17] transgressions and wrongdoings against
[51:20] him and others.
[51:22] Let's go the next piece of evidence. So
[51:24] we dealt with two so far. We dealt with
[51:26] unconfessed sins and we dealt with
[51:29] holding also unforgiveness which is the
[51:31] ver
[51:34] you want to pray you asking God Lord I
[51:36] want this I want that and the devil
[51:37] saying well you know you can't grant
[51:38] that Lord because the evidence shows
[51:41] that what he asked he asking out of lust
[51:47] many of us say well God answering my
[51:48] prayer God answering my prayer what YOU
[51:50] ASKING FOR WHY you asking for it because
[51:52] the Bible says you have you ask and
[51:54] receive not because you ask a miss that
[51:57] he may consume it upon your lust. So God
[52:00] is saying here through James that the
[52:03] prayers you're asking for, some of them
[52:04] you're asking for, the reason they're
[52:06] not even answered is because the accuser
[52:08] can stand up and say, "Why you giving
[52:09] him that?" Look what the motive is.
[52:10] Because the devil know a motive.
[52:13] In the amplified, it says you ask God
[52:16] for something and do not receive it
[52:18] because you ask with wrong motives out
[52:21] of selfishness
[52:23] or with an unrighteous agenda so that
[52:27] when you get what you want, you may
[52:29] spend it on your hedonistic desires.
[52:31] That's Bible I read in the amplified of
[52:33] that same scripture.
[52:37] So the third thing with dismantling is
[52:39] the wrong motive. I'm praying and I'm
[52:41] praying and I'm not not getting no
[52:42] answer. What are you praying for? Why
[52:44] are you praying for that thing? Lord, I
[52:46] want a promotion. I want a promotion.
[52:48] And promotion comes from God. But God
[52:49] saying you not ready yet. We got the
[52:51] motive for the promotion. You want to
[52:52] gallery yourself and you say you want to
[52:53] show off. You want to you want to
[52:55] ramage. You want to whatever you want to
[52:56] use as a terminology to describe
[52:59] behavior that doesn't glorify God. God
[53:02] can never honor that. And then people
[53:03] stomp around and throw a tantrums. The
[53:05] same way a child throw a tantrum, adults
[53:07] throw a tantrum as well. God answer me.
[53:10] So I vex and you vex with God
[53:13] and the devil is holy. That has evidence
[53:15] against you because this supposed to be
[53:16] a son. This supposed to be a daughter.
[53:18] But look at their heart's desire. Look
[53:20] at what they're looking for. Look at
[53:21] what they're asking for. Are we
[53:23] together?
[53:25] Three stacks. We breaking up the devil
[53:28] fire. What we doing tonight, church, is
[53:29] going into the legal room of the devil
[53:31] and seeing the files you holding on
[53:33] people and know. And by the time we done
[53:35] clear out here, we leave here tonight
[53:37] with the room clear. Holy devil wake up
[53:39] in the morning if I can use an analogy
[53:40] say who come in here and dismantle my
[53:42] files. I was trying to hold but I can't
[53:45] find the files.
[53:49] The next one this one coming into the
[53:50] home and we dealing with prayer because
[53:52] this is about prayer. We we in the room
[53:55] to God the devil is holding by virtue of
[53:59] what the scripture presents has an
[54:01] impact on our prayer.
[54:07] 1 Peter 3:7, we in the house now.
[54:10] Likewise, ye husbands
[54:13] dwell with them a knowledge, giving
[54:17] honor unto the wife, as unto the weaker
[54:20] vessel, as being heirs to G of life,
[54:24] that your prayers be not hindered.
[54:28] So brother have mystery connect woman
[54:32] the son the wars the plagues the vials
[54:36] but he can't treat the wife he cannot
[54:38] treat his wife right
[54:41] prayers sticking her just stick right in
[54:43] the roof of the house
[54:46] all the books tapes mysteries if you
[54:49] don't treat the wife right
[54:51] your prayers are going nowhere because
[54:53] this here is not a test of mystery and
[54:55] knowledge and years in the message this
[54:57] is why this is foolishness when people
[54:59] say well I the message long and I know
[55:01] this and no life they're mystery the
[55:04] word is a mystery your life not supposed
[55:05] to be a mystery your life SUPPOSED TO BE
[55:06] TRANSPARENT husband love your wife wives
[55:08] honor your husband all this is this is
[55:10] the word in practice in the amplified
[55:14] in the same way you husbands live with
[55:16] your wives in an understanding way with
[55:20] great
[55:23] and with an intelligent regard for the
[55:26] marriage relationship ship as with
[55:28] someone physically weaker since she is a
[55:31] woman. show and respect as a fellow heir
[55:34] of the grace of life so that your
[55:37] prayers will not be hindered or
[55:40] where does that put these super
[55:42] spiritual people who have no testimony
[55:44] with
[55:46] that is taking a whole bazooka and
[55:48] shooting we blowing up the place but we
[55:51] not going to I'm not speaking about
[55:52] anybody here we're going after the files
[55:54] is the files is the is the evidence
[55:56] files we going after tonight so if if if
[56:00] it come to your home It's not you. It's
[56:02] really the files you going for. We
[56:04] trying to bust up the devil files
[56:05] tonight. Destroy the evidence. So to
[56:09] destroy the evidence, make the evidence
[56:10] a lie. You make the evidence a lie by
[56:14] your behavior. Because by changing your
[56:16] behavior, the evidence has to start to
[56:18] match your behavior. But say, "But wait,
[56:19] the way the man behaving here lining up
[56:22] or
[56:24] what is reality? Are we together?"
[56:29] the last piece of evidence that I ever
[56:32] hold in.
[56:34] But let him ask in faith. Now is there
[56:36] is plenty more we could speak on on on
[56:37] this thing, but for the purpose of this
[56:39] because we have a little bit of time
[56:40] left to get into our prayer plan for
[56:44] tonight. But James 1:6, but let him ask
[56:47] in faith nothing wavering.
[56:51] For he that waverth is like a wave of
[56:54] the sea driven with the wind and tossed.
[56:58] I want to read it in the amplified. But
[56:59] he must ask for wisdom in faith without
[57:02] doubting God willingness to help. For
[57:04] the one who doubts is like a billowing
[57:06] surge of the sea that is blown about and
[57:09] tossed by the wind. So I want to speak
[57:12] this because I would have preached the
[57:13] message more than once and I would have
[57:15] preached it by brother Norris finding
[57:16] faith in the midst of the storm. And
[57:18] many people say, "But brother Isaac are
[57:19] going through a real storm of good."
[57:22] And it's as if people would have
[57:24] rejoiced with the message. But when the
[57:25] storm really come to your home, people
[57:27] still shaken up and I saying, "But we
[57:29] can't just preach it and shout about it.
[57:31] You have to live it." Because finding
[57:33] faith in the midst of the storm is not a
[57:35] shout. There's a is not a a feeling good
[57:37] about the mess. In a storm, you could
[57:40] have faith to believe.
[57:43] This is why Jesus could say over and
[57:44] over, "Why you doubt? We have little
[57:46] faith." Because devil thrives on doubt.
[57:52] He's allergic to faith. So he has the
[57:55] right to say but this man have no faith.
[57:56] He pray without faith enough
[57:59] because faith pushes doubt out of the
[58:01] picture. So I want us to stand in faith
[58:05] when we make a request for our loved
[58:07] ones. Make a request for the young
[58:09] people. Make a request for your
[58:10] business, your job, your time it might
[58:12] be that you stand boldly with faith
[58:15] whatever the situation is so that you
[58:16] could see your life change and you
[58:18] transform completely. Are we together?
[58:22] Oh, once you apply these things, I can
[58:25] imagine the picture if I could dramatize
[58:27] the courtroom and you say, "But Lord,
[58:29] here's what now I just confess. I
[58:32] dropped my OS. I standing here with
[58:34] faith. Are you with me? I living right?"
[58:38] And the devil say well here here what
[58:40] now all the case all the evidence I have
[58:42] seem to be gone and now the whole case I
[58:44] apologize for wasting the court time in
[58:46] fact the the devil might get into
[58:48] contempt of court for wasting the court
[58:49] time because by time the Lord case
[58:52] dismissed there's nothing against
[58:54] brother poet there's nothing against
[58:56] sister Bernardet there's nothing against
[58:57] sister Judith brother Clarence Anthony
[59:00] brother Shane brother Joe sister June
[59:02] sister brother George
[59:05] brother Hugh Sister Ingred Brother
[59:08] Kelly, I can't call all the names. I was
[59:10] I was trying but we we we wouldn't we
[59:11] wouldn't finish. But case dismiss, we in
[59:14] the case dismissing business tonight by
[59:18] taking this approach and understanding
[59:20] because the Bible says we are not
[59:21] ignorant of Satan's devices. That
[59:24] statement is powerful to know because
[59:25] being not ignorant of his devices, it
[59:27] means we could upend this plan in war.
[59:29] If you know where your enemy coming
[59:30] with, then you could prepare a counter
[59:33] attack. You could prepare defensive
[59:35] maneuver. Know what you're coming with.
[59:36] If we not ignorant of his devices, why
[59:38] the devil tying you up? The devil only
[59:41] have certain place. His movements are
[59:42] finite, but our God is infinite. His
[59:45] movements are limited, but our God is
[59:47] unlimited.
[59:49] Our God is a creator. The devil is a
[59:51] perverter. So there's no acceptable
[59:54] story in which the devil could ever win.
[59:57] The problem in this story, we have to
[1:00:00] get in line with the will of God. We
[1:00:02] have to get in line with the plan of
[1:00:03] God, the purpose of God and resolve in
[1:00:06] our hearts to be truly Christians and
[1:00:09] live the word in spirit and in truth.
[1:00:12] And in so doing, we will see the
[1:00:13] situation change more than that because
[1:00:16] we're not looking at the present tense
[1:00:17] 16 elements only. We're not just looking
[1:00:19] for healing. We're not just looking for
[1:00:20] a body change, but the we are looking to
[1:00:23] be made whole. We are looking to be
[1:00:25] perfect, adopted
[1:00:27] for a short-term manifestation. will
[1:00:29] give A CHANGE, A COMPLETE
[1:00:31] TRANSFORMATION,
[1:00:33] the fullness of everything.
[1:00:36] Are we together?
[1:00:38] We're not Pentecostals.
[1:00:40] This word has to live. We're looking for
[1:00:42] the manifestation of the sons of God.
[1:00:45] We're looking for a new heaven. We're
[1:00:46] looking.
[1:00:49] Hallelujah.
[1:00:53] Where is the evidence tonight? the judge
[1:00:56] starting to look for evidence because I
[1:00:58] believe tonight the moment you begin to
[1:01:00] confess your sins and begin to make
[1:01:01] things right, use that to blow up the
[1:01:03] devil's fire.
[1:01:06] Are we together?
[1:01:09] I want to close out with just two quotes
[1:01:11] and then we'll pray.
[1:01:14] Visible union of the bride of Christ.
[1:01:16] You're standing completely. You never
[1:01:18] sinned at the first place.
[1:01:20] Hallelujah. God don't even know
[1:01:22] nothingness.
[1:01:24] You never did it. You were accused of it
[1:01:26] by the accuser, but really from the
[1:01:29] beginning you were pred
[1:01:31] story, the story has been written. We
[1:01:34] could smile because you know you did it.
[1:01:37] But just never did it. Hallelujah.
[1:01:41] You were accused of it by the accuser.
[1:01:43] That's his job. But really from the
[1:01:44] beginning, you were predestinated to be
[1:01:46] a son and daughter of God. You're
[1:01:48] standing there washed and your old book
[1:01:51] of divorcement is put away. It's dead.
[1:01:54] absolutely out of existence in the mind
[1:01:57] of God. Hallelujah.
[1:02:00] Bride of Christ washed in the blood of
[1:02:03] Christ. Precious, virtuous, sinless,
[1:02:08] standing with a pure unadulterated bride
[1:02:11] word that he water of his own blood that
[1:02:15] become flesh and manifest
[1:02:18] you which were predestinated in the
[1:02:20] bosom of the father before the
[1:02:22] beginning. the same as he was. He was
[1:02:23] that great attribute of God called
[1:02:28] finished. I trust this will encourage
[1:02:33] it will encourage you. It will build
[1:02:34] your faith to approach the throne of God
[1:02:36] with boldness, with the legal authority
[1:02:39] that you understand that the law, this
[1:02:42] law, this book of the law shall not
[1:02:44] depart from you, but you meditate on it.
[1:02:46] So that as you navigate life, you
[1:02:48] understand that if you are right as a
[1:02:50] citizen of Trinidad and Tobago is to
[1:02:52] enter this country because it's your
[1:02:54] country. Nobody could tell you cannot
[1:02:55] enter. If you go into America, they
[1:02:58] could ask you why you're here. But when
[1:03:00] you coming home, they cannot ask you why
[1:03:02] you're here because you have a legal
[1:03:03] right by virtue.
[1:03:06] That's the law. If somebody asks you why
[1:03:08] you coming, you you you could tell them
[1:03:10] you're asking misspeness. How you going
[1:03:11] to ask me that?
[1:03:13] All right. I have a legal right to be
[1:03:16] here. Nobody can ask you why you going
[1:03:18] into your house. You have a legal right
[1:03:20] to go into your house. Are we together?
[1:03:23] When you go into the bank and the bank,
[1:03:25] it's my account. How you can ask him
[1:03:26] about my account? It's my account. is
[1:03:28] your
[1:03:30] and if my name is in under the law
[1:03:32] because my name is on it, it is mine. I
[1:03:35] will call the police. The police will
[1:03:36] enforce it because it's mine. So this
[1:03:39] legal understanding is the same
[1:03:41] principle that speaks to your family
[1:03:42] being delivered because your family is
[1:03:44] yours. As for me and my house, we will
[1:03:46] serve the Lord. The promise is unto you
[1:03:48] and to your children and to them that
[1:03:50] are far off. That is legal precedent
[1:03:52] with that is enough to take it and say,
[1:03:54] "Look what the law says. Look what the
[1:03:57] law says.
[1:03:59] The promise is unto me and tonight the
[1:04:02] children tonight. Tonight we claiming
[1:04:04] them tonight. We are putting it out
[1:04:06] there that the law gives
[1:04:09] children to be delivered. The law gives
[1:04:11] permission by his stripes we are healed.
[1:04:14] This has already happened. It's already
[1:04:15] taken place. We're not we're not trying
[1:04:18] to make it so the law already speaks to
[1:04:20] the fact it is written. We could find
[1:04:22] the chapter. We could find the book. we
[1:04:24] could find the verse in the law to allow
[1:04:26] us. Shall we pray? Our heavenly father,
[1:04:28] we thank you tonight for your word, for
[1:04:31] your presence, for your grace, for your
[1:04:32] anointing. Your anointing that follows
[1:04:34] the word, the anointing that makes the
[1:04:36] word a reality to us. The anoint
[1:04:39] word and makes it more positive. You
[1:04:41] said that's how you raise a standard by
[1:04:43] taking the same word and make it
[1:04:45] positive. So as a body of believers
[1:04:46] tonight, we unite in faith. You said if
[1:04:49] two shall go come into agreement. If two
[1:04:51] shall agree touch could have what they
[1:04:54] ask for. So tonight Lord Lord for the
[1:04:56] next few minutes we want to be in prayer

[1:09:50] Heavenly Father, we come again, Lord, as
[1:09:52] a church, Lord, in agreement, united,
[1:09:54] Lord, for the young people. Many are
[1:09:57] struggling, but Lord, many are also
[1:09:58] holding on. Lord, many having a hard
[1:10:00] time, but Lord, the devil could have
[1:10:02] most. The Lord, the devil can have many,
[1:10:04] but he cannot have all. And tonight, we
[1:10:06] draw a line in the sand that the devil
[1:10:07] cannot have all. Draw a line in the sand
[1:10:10] and say there will be young people who
[1:10:11] will stand. They will have a testimony.
[1:10:13] They will dress right. They will walk
[1:10:15] right. They will live right. They will
[1:10:16] act right. They will love the word. They
[1:10:18] will love the brethren. They will love
[1:10:19] the fellowship. They want to go to
[1:10:21] heaven. Father, may you strengthen the
[1:10:23] young people. May you give them strength
[1:10:24] to stand in their schools, in their
[1:10:26] primary schools, in their secondary
[1:10:28] schools, in university, on their jobs,
[1:10:30] Lord, in their wherever they may go.
[1:10:32] Father, bless their coming. Bless their
[1:10:34] going. Help them to have a test
[1:10:37] backbone. Lord, the prophet said not to
[1:10:39] be jellyfish, but give them backbone to
[1:10:41] say, I'm a Christian. I'm a daughter of
[1:10:43] God. I'm a son of God. May you give the
[1:10:45] parents wisdom to deal with the young
[1:10:48] people. May you help the young people.
[1:10:50] May you send a revival. your promise to
[1:10:52] send a revival for the young people.
[1:10:53] Your promise to stir young people. May
[1:10:55] you stir, may it start tonight. May you
[1:10:57] start a revival, Lord, in the homes. May
[1:11:00] you start a revival among the young
[1:11:01] people. Many of the Calebs, the older
[1:11:03] ones have been laboring for a long time,
[1:11:05] but Lord, it's time tonight for the
[1:11:07] young people to stand up to rise up to
[1:11:09] take their pos gospel forward to push
[1:11:12] this message forward. the Calebs have
[1:11:15] done. They are fought for five, 10, 15
[1:11:18] years, Lord. But you promise, Lord, that
[1:11:20] the promised land would be the young
[1:11:21] people and the Calebs. So, Father, we
[1:11:23] pray for the strengthening of the young
[1:11:25] people to see, Lord, an anointing drop
[1:11:28] down to lift up the young people, to
[1:11:31] give them a a heart to please you, a
[1:11:33] fervent desire to please you, a cry to
[1:11:36] be in the spirit of desperation,
[1:11:39] Lord. Lord, turn on the humanistic away
[1:11:41] from social media and Tik Tok and
[1:11:43] Facebook and Instagram and parties and
[1:11:45] conversations and movies and TV and all
[1:11:47] these things, Lord, into a realm where
[1:11:50] they see a present tense reality of the
[1:11:51] living God upon the young people. Break
[1:11:55] chains. We come against the demon of
[1:11:57] lust and pornography and filth and the
[1:12:00] worldly music and Lord worldly
[1:12:02] attachments. We come against it tonight
[1:12:04] in the name of Jesus Christ. House of
[1:12:06] hell, give weight in the name of Jesus.
[1:12:08] May you Lord bring liberty to your
[1:12:11] people in the mighty name of Jesus
[1:12:13] Christ. And the church says and the
[1:12:16] church says amen. Amen. Amen. Heavenly
[1:12:19] Father, we come tonight to pray for
[1:12:21] families, Lord. To pray for the families
[1:12:22] in the church, Lord. Husbands, wives,
[1:12:25] children, Lord. Lord, we pray a special
[1:12:27] blessing upon them, Lord. That the angel
[1:12:28] of the Lord would move, Lord. That the
[1:12:31] family altars would be restored, Lord.
[1:12:33] That the prayer time home would be
[1:12:34] restored. that the angel of the Lord
[1:12:36] will feel pleased and walk into homes.
[1:12:39] Father, Lord, may the fathers take their
[1:12:41] place. Take their place. May the
[1:12:44] children take their place. May there be
[1:12:46] a priest established in the homes. May
[1:12:48] the priest step forward as priest in
[1:12:50] their home. Lord, may there be a a a
[1:12:52] spirit of prayer, a prayer before
[1:12:54] breakfast, a prayer before lunch,
[1:12:57] dinner, understanding that the home
[1:13:00] should be like doors and doors, that the
[1:13:01] angel of the Lord could move into every
[1:13:03] room in the home. that the Holy Spirit
[1:13:05] will be welcome to come and commune with
[1:13:07] the families, commune with the homes,
[1:13:09] com commune, Father God. May you
[1:13:12] strengthen families, may you strengthen
[1:13:14] marriages in the church. May you break
[1:13:16] the chains that have separated and
[1:13:18] caused division and confusion and
[1:13:20] animosity and anger and lack of
[1:13:22] communication and all these things.
[1:13:24] Father, we bring it to you. We we lift
[1:13:26] them up to you. We we push it in the
[1:13:28] past, Lord. We draw a line tonight,
[1:13:31] Lord, in the families in the church.
[1:13:33] Before there was church, there was
[1:13:34] family. Before there was organization,
[1:13:36] there was family. Lord, it was a perfect
[1:13:38] family back there to in Eden. And you
[1:13:40] promised to go back to Eden. So, Father,
[1:13:42] may you move upon the church tonight,
[1:13:44] and restore families, restore homes
[1:13:47] tonight in the precious name of Jesus
[1:13:49] Christ. Father, we want to pray for all
[1:13:51] the widows, Lord. Lord, all the widows
[1:13:54] in the church, Father, Lord, the
[1:13:56] struggles, Lord, the Bible speaks about
[1:13:58] it, Lord, that you would strengthen
[1:13:59] them. We want to remember them, that you
[1:14:01] would give them peace. Give them wisdom.
[1:14:03] Give them strength. Give them
[1:14:05] understanding, compassion, give them a
[1:14:07] insight to be able to help others. May

[1:14:44] have an opportunity Lord to live for you
[1:14:46] in spirit and in truth father in the
[1:14:48] mighty name of Jesus Christ. Father God

[1:14:53] officers of the church. Lord, your
[1:14:55] prophet taught us, Lord, that you don't
[1:14:57] make halfway Christians, but a Christian
[1:14:59] could be halfway. You don't make halfway
[1:15:00] preachers, but a preacher could be
[1:15:02] halfway. You don't make halfway deacons,
[1:15:04] but a deacon could be halfway. You don't
[1:15:06] make halfway ushers, but a usher could
[1:15:07] be halfway. You don't make halfway
[1:15:08] musicians, but the musician could be
[1:15:10] halfway. Trustees, whatever it might be,
[1:15:12] helps and governments, Father, Lord, we
[1:15:14] pray for Lord, Lord, the the the
[1:15:16] officers, the helps and the governments.

[1:15:23] in the church. We unite in prayer for
[1:15:25] our pastor in a special way that you
[1:15:27] would touch our pastor as a church.
[1:15:29] Father, we rally around our pastor

[1:15:40] his body, a fresh charge from the
[1:15:42] supernatural.
[1:15:44] Use him, Lord. May you continue to speak
[1:15:46] through him. May the pillar of fire rest
[1:15:48] on his shoulder as you said it would
[1:15:49] through your prophet that the pillar of
[1:15:51] fire will rest upon the shoulder of the
[1:15:52] adopted sons. May the Holy Ghost and
[1:15:55] fire come upon him. May you give him
[1:15:56] wisdom to climb higher Lord into that
[1:15:59] watchtower. Father, watchman, watchman

[1:16:17] lot of road yet ahead. There's a lot of
[1:16:19] journeys to cross. Father, may you give
[1:16:21] them strength for the journey tonight,
[1:16:23] Father. We unite for them in the mighty
[1:16:25] precious name of Jesus Christ. Lord, may
[1:16:27] you bless the elders and ministers that
[1:16:29] support them. Father, may you bring us
[1:16:31] into perfect alignment with your Holy
[1:16:33] Spirit so we could fight back to back as
[1:16:35] your prophet said. Lord, each one
[1:16:37] backing one another up. Father, may you
[1:16:39] strengthen the church in the mighty
[1:16:41] precious name of Jesus Christ. Oh, could
[1:16:44] you praise them? right now. Could you
[1:16:46] thank him right now? Could you lift him
[1:16:48] up right now? Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:16:51] Blessed be the name of the Lord. Oh,
[1:16:54] Father, we praise you. Father, we
[1:16:55] glorify you. Father, we thank you.
[1:16:57] Father, we pray right now for the
[1:16:58] brothers, Lord. Lord, the brothers from
[1:17:00] the youngest to the oldest, Father.
[1:17:02] Lord, the men of war, the men who ought
[1:17:04] to pray and not to faint, the men who
[1:17:06] ought to be a testimony. Father, Lord,
[1:17:09] you call your sons for such a time as
[1:17:11] this. We pray for every brother right
[1:17:13] now. Lord, some are strong, some are
[1:17:15] hanging in there, some are stronger, but
[1:17:17] Lord, we lift them up before you. Lord,
[1:17:19] in such a time as this, with temptations
[1:17:22] everywhere, with all kind of
[1:17:23] distractions everywhere, may you
[1:17:25] strengthen the men of the church. May
[1:17:27] you lift us up where we belong. May you
[1:17:29] help us to rise into the spiritual
[1:17:31] realm. rise above the style, above the
[1:17:33] fashion, above laziness, above
[1:17:36] distraction, above what other men want
[1:17:38] and other men will do, above the
[1:17:40] conversations of the men in our jobs and
[1:17:42] men in our neighborhoods and whatever it
[1:17:44] might be. Father, we are not called to
[1:17:46] be like others. We are called to be like
[1:17:47] you. As we read in the scripture, we are
[1:17:49] citizens of above. Our conversations are
[1:17:52] from heaven. Our dialogue is from
[1:17:54] heaven. Our thinking is from heaven. Our
[1:17:57] mindset is heaven. We are heaven bound.
[1:18:00] Our destination is heaven. Our thoughts
[1:18:02] are on heaven. Our focus is on heaven.
[1:18:05] We are not focused on this carnal world.
[1:18:08] Take their Lord as priests. As priests,
[1:18:11] kings, royal priesthood. May we move
[1:18:14] like royal priests. May we act like
[1:18:17] royal priests. May we live like royal
[1:18:19] priests. May we step up to the plate.
[1:18:22] May we step up to our responsibility
[1:18:24] tonight. Father, precious name of Jesus
[1:18:26] Christ. Heavenly Father, we pray for the
[1:18:28] sisters, Lord, from the youngest to the
[1:18:31] oldest, Lord, who can find a virtuous
[1:18:33] woman who
[1:18:36] heavenly father, we pray, dear, God,
[1:18:37] that you strengthen, Lord, strengthen
[1:18:39] every sister that have a testimony, give
[1:18:42] them grace, give them uncction, give
[1:18:44] them wisdom, give them favor, give them,
[1:18:47] give them understanding, give them
[1:18:49] knowledge, give them a fervent desire,
[1:18:52] Lord. Help them, raise them up
[1:18:55] in the midst of the trial. Strength in
[1:18:57] the midst in the of the storm. Peace in
[1:19:00] the midst of the storm. Peace in the
[1:19:02] midst of the battle. In the mighty name
[1:19:04] of Jesus Christ. Lord, we bring them
[1:19:05] before you. Come on, church. Hallelujah.
[1:19:08] Wor stay together. Let's stay focused.
[1:19:12] Father, Lord, we want to come now for
[1:19:14] everyone who's desiring the baptism of
[1:19:15] the Holy Ghost. Lord, it's the greatest
[1:19:18] desire we could ever have, Lord, to have
[1:19:20] the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Lord,
[1:19:22] there are many who have been holding on.
[1:19:23] They're hanging on. But Lord, as we see
[1:19:25] tonight, we have dismantled the
[1:19:27] evidence. We have destroyed the evidence
[1:19:30] has tried to bring against. And Lord,
[1:19:33] the Holy Ghost is a right. Your prophet
[1:19:34] taught us that you want to give us the
[1:19:36] Holy Ghost more than we want to receive.
[1:19:39] You already s with the Holy Ghost. So we
[1:19:41] want to lift your people up, Father.
[1:19:43] Lord, those with Holy Ghost, Father. Oh
[1:19:46] Lord, that you fill your people tonight.
[1:19:47] Oh, that you poured your Holy Ghost that
[1:19:49] as the season is changing and the season
[1:19:52] has changed, Father, Lord, that the Holy
[1:19:54] Ghost will pour out and baptize into the
[1:19:57] body. Bring into the body. He said, we
[1:20:01] are baptized into the body tonight,
[1:20:03] Father. Lord, may this be the beginning.
[1:20:06] May this be the beginning of the Holy
[1:20:07] Spirit moving in a way that's never
[1:20:09] moved before in the hearts and lives of
[1:20:12] your people in the mighty name of Jesus
[1:20:14] Christ. And Father, tonight we bring the
[1:20:16] backsliders before you. Those that are
[1:20:18] barely hanging on. Those that have
[1:20:20] questions and doubts and confusion and
[1:20:23] just life has beat them and the cares of
[1:20:26] life and the stress of life and the
[1:20:28] pressures of life. Lord, many have lost
[1:20:30] their way. But tonight, Lord, is a night
[1:20:33] of restoration. Tonight is a night of
[1:20:35] deliverance. Tonight is a night of
[1:20:37] breakthrough. Tonight is a night of
[1:20:39] recalibrating purpose.
[1:20:42] beformed by the renewing of our minds.
[1:20:46] Oh, Father God, strengthen your church.
[1:20:48] Strengthen your people, Father. Lift us
[1:20:50] up where we belong. Uh bless the service
[1:20:53] this coming Sunday. Bless the upcoming
[1:20:55] Lord, special meetings we will have,
[1:20:57] Lord, with Brother Andrew Glover. Lord,
[1:20:59] bless the services as we go into the end
[1:21:01] of this year and prepare for the new
[1:21:03] year. We don't know what is about to
[1:21:04] happen, but we know that time is short.
[1:21:06] Father, bless the church. Bless
[1:21:08] strengthen your believers. Bless the
[1:21:10] other churches, Lord. Lord, the other
[1:21:12] fellowships, Lord, that are looking for
[1:21:14] more of you, that are desperate for
[1:21:16] revival, that are looking for the moving
[1:21:18] of the rustle in the malberry tree. You
[1:21:21] said the body of Christ is the sickest
[1:21:22] body on the face of the earth. Father,
[1:21:24] may you bring a unity of the faith. May
[1:21:26] you bring a unity of the spirit before a
[1:21:28] unity of the spirit before a unity of
[1:21:30] the faith. May we be in one mind and one
[1:21:32] accord. There's only one Lord, there's
[1:21:34] one faith, there's one baptism. May you
[1:21:36] bring us together in love. May you Lord
[1:21:39] may may the water Lord pour out so that
[1:21:42] the duck could have fellowship. Father
[1:21:44] may your Holy Spirit move among your
[1:21:46] people. Lord pour out your spirit.
[1:21:49] Deliver your people. Shake and transform
[1:21:52] in the mighty name of Jesus Christ.

[1:22:01] bless you. Father we praise you. Father
[1:22:03] we lift you up. Father we give you
[1:22:04] glory. Father we give you honor. There's
[1:22:06] none like you tonight, Father. From the
[1:22:09] rising of the sun to the going down of
[1:22:10] the same, your name is exalted. Thank
[1:22:12] you, Lord, for what you have done. Thank
[1:22:14] you, Father, for your grace tonight.
[1:22:17] Thank you for the reminders in your
[1:22:18] word. Thank you for the encouragement.
[1:22:20] Thank you for what you have already
[1:22:22] done. Thank you for healing the sick in

[1:22:39] for Lord, all that you have done, all
[1:22:41] that you're doing, what you're about to
[1:22:43] do. Thank you, Father, Lord, because you
[1:22:45] are our all. You are a king. You're a
[1:22:47] Lord. Thank you for the message of the
[1:22:49] hour. Thank you, Lord, for breaking the
[1:22:51] seal. Thank you for opening the word to
[1:22:53] us. Thank you for opening our
[1:22:55] understanding. Thank you for making a
[1:22:57] way. Thank you for calling us, for
[1:22:59] choosing us, for predestinating us.
[1:23:01] Thank you for finding us. You said the
[1:23:03] message would find itself in the hands
[1:23:05] of the the predestinated. Thank you for
[1:23:08] making itself known to us. Thank you for
[1:23:10] revealing yourself to us. Thank you for
[1:23:12] breaking chains and shackles. Thank you
[1:23:15] for calling us to be the final voice to
[1:23:17] the final age. Thank you for the promise
[1:23:19] of the Holy Ghost. Thank you for the
[1:23:21] promise of dynamics. Thank you for the
[1:23:23] promise of charity. Thank you for a
[1:23:25] promise of a perfect church. Thank you

[1:23:36] us up. Thank you in the mighty name of
[1:23:38] Jesus Christ. Heavenly Father, as we
[1:23:41] come to the end of this session tonight,
[1:23:43] Father, may your Holy Spirit be with
[1:23:45] your people. May you bless us, Lord. May
[1:23:47] you bless us tonight. We thank you for
[1:23:49] your uncction and your grace tonight.
[1:23:51] May you bless the service this coming
[1:23:52] Sunday. May you bless what you have
[1:23:54] planned for your people. May you
[1:23:56] strengthen your people. We commit each
[1:23:57] one into your hands in the precious name
[1:23:59] of Jesus Christ. And the church says,
[1:24:02] and the church says, amen and amen. May
[1:24:05] the Lord bless you tonight. Thank you so
[1:24:07] much for coming. May the Lord strengthen
[1:24:10] you. May the Lord keep you. I trust that
[1:24:13] in your homes or wherever you might be,
[1:24:15] you are able to get into the spirit. And
[1:24:17] I encourage you practice the presence of
[1:24:19] God. Make prayer not just a a a thing to
[1:24:23] do, but make it such a relationship and
[1:24:25] understand that when you go to God,
[1:24:26] you're going to God based on the legal
[1:24:28] basis of his word, his promised word.
[1:24:30] That's the foundation. We're not asking
[1:24:32] because we feeling to ask, we ask him
[1:24:33] because he gave us permission to ask.
[1:24:35] And he gave us a legal approach with
[1:24:37] within which we could ask. So, we're not
[1:24:39] asking a miss. We asking with the
[1:24:41] clarity to knowing of what God wants.
[1:24:43] Not my will, but thy will be done. Lord,
[1:24:45] your promise, it's your word. You said
[1:24:47] it. We didn't make it up. It's not our
[1:24:49] idea. isn't our suggestion. You promise
[1:24:51] a manifestation. You promise healing.
[1:24:53] You promise deliverance. You promise my
[1:24:54] family. You promise these things. And we
[1:24:56] are coming to you on that basis. And we
[1:24:58] are we are going to keep destroying the
[1:25:01] moment evidence come up because evidence
[1:25:02] will come up. We will we will make a
[1:25:04] mistake here. We'll make a mistake
[1:25:05] there. But if you understand the formula
[1:25:07] to rush quickly and say, "Lord, I'm
[1:25:09] sorry. Forgive me. I want to make it
[1:25:10] right. I want to drop this ought." You
[1:25:12] you rob somebody the wrong way, you want
[1:25:14] to fix it quickly because you don't want
[1:25:15] the devil holding evidence against you.
[1:25:17] You don't want nothing hindering your
[1:25:18] prayer. You don't want you you have an
[1:25:20] issue with your wife, your husband, make
[1:25:21] it right. You have an issue at home,
[1:25:22] make it right. Fix it. You want nothing
[1:25:24] holding up the blessing. You want to
[1:25:26] make sure the moment a file presents
[1:25:28] itself in the legal office of the devil
[1:25:31] that that file gets destroyed by your
[1:25:33] attitude, by your action, by your
[1:25:35] movement, by your prayer. May the Lord
[1:25:37] richly bless you. Have a wonderful
[1:25:38] evening. Stay in faith. Practice the
[1:25:41] presence of God. The water might be
[1:25:43] rough. The storm might be blazing, but
[1:25:45] we have preached pineing faith in the
[1:25:47] midst of the storm because we didn't
[1:25:48] know storm was coming. Storm coming.
[1:25:50] Storm is coming. But stand still and see
[1:25:53] the salvation of the Lord. May the Lord
[1:25:54] richly bless you. God bless you tonight.
[1:25:56] Thank you.
