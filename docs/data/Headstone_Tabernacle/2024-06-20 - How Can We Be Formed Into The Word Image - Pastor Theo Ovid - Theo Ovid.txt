greetings from the head Tabernacle Trin and my wife sister Amry who is here this morning at this time we want to go into the word I want to uh uh read we spoke on about being predestinated to be formed to the good image on Friday and tonight we want to speak about how can we be formed into so Romans 12 we to read 1 and two and after we go to 2 Corinthians 3:1 17 to8 and then Galatians 4:19 reading Romans 121 I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable sin confed this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God 2 Corinthians chapter 3 verse 17 now the Lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is there is Li but we all but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord Galatians 4:19 Paul speaks my little children of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you let's bow our heads with a prayer heavenly father I thank you to be here this morning and I pray that your spirit would come Among Us and open our understanding and bring clarity about this word image speak to your sons and daughters here heal the sick inid touch the calebs and the elderly and stir up the young people Among [Music] Us in Jesus name I ask amen and amen amen God bless you my SE want to than brother uh precious brother ber giving me this invitation to be here this opportunity to be here okay so I have a title how can we be formed into the word image question Friday night you're predestinated to be formed before I get into it I just want to make a bridge from Friday to today Hebrews 4 Paul speaks there remain therefore AR rest of the people of God for he that enter into his rest had SE some his own works as God did from him then he said these words let us labor therefore to enter into that rest that rest for us is Charity it is L love it's a labor from Faith to enter into charity do you get me now there a struggle it's a labor you are laboring with a faith which is which is with Revelation that is not real to you yet by experience in other words you have revelation we have Revelation but it's not real yet by experience the prophet said what is feet Fe is something that is revealed to you but is not yet but you believe it will be so when God spoke to Abraham Abraham had a revelation but he couldn't show nobody Isaac he didn't have an experience to produce the revelation of what he had so I have an inspiration from Revelation to experience Mary received the word from the angel but it was not real to her in experience without any sensation she ran and give a testimony I'm going to have the Messiah so there is a revelation and there is the experience now brother bam said Paul had an intellectual faith but he didn't have Divine Faith there's quite a difference between intellectual faith and divine Faith Divine faith is divine revelation is When Heaven reveals it in intellectual faith is your knowledge or our understanding and our thoughts about the matter and removing by faith that's intellectual Faith he says what it must be a divine revelation that come out of the heart so the intellectual faith is not good enough but it only brings you to the Holy Spirit but the holy spirit is a personal experience of the bir so the intellectual faith brings you up to the Holy Spirit but the holy spirit is by experience oh give the Lord some Praises so you can understand now how Moses with knowledge or information or Revelation from his mother of his calling when he killed that man in Egypt he run for his life because he only had an intellectual conception but when that same man met the pillar of fire that was an experience that changed what he has for intellectual faith into divine revelation and that transformed that man that change that man so when you move from revelation to experience it changes you oh praise the name of the Lord are you getting it now Satan knew the Bible he knew the word he said but say he was like a walking Bible but Jesus knew where he was standing so Satan CAU the word talk the word preach the word does revelation because if he had a revelation he never touched Jesus he said if th be if th be because he didn't know and Jesus said it's also written get behind me Satan so said Satan knowed by knowledge but Jesus noted by experience he noted by revelation so friends you have got to go beyond text and Beyond the word letter and come to divine revelation that takes you into an experience now Faith claims it now now Fai is Hope could hinder you because you're hoping for it to happen but it says it is mine I claim it I claim my children I claim my healing this morning I claim my Deliverance this morning I claim my breakthrough this morning hope says God said so I'm expecting this somay I'm expecting it someday but Faith you have it right now I'm I'm say reading it's your personal property it's your work it's your personal property that's what faith is is that right so Faith stands up and takes over and rues when Faith speaks everybody keeps still bam he say on record say this with all my heart if any man if any person will take the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise that God has made it will bring it to pass it's the attitude towards what he said so you could understand now like the Bible said all heard Moses his word but most of them the word that they heard will not mixed with faith and because of that it had no effect upon them so you could sit here and just sit here you could sit here and just here with your ear if there a lecture coming to you but if you mix what you are hearing fath it becomes a reality in your spirit because faith is a substance Oh Glory to God is not empty expel is a substance of what you're hoping for hallelujah hallelujah is the money of the bread you have to purchase you're hungry you you don't have bread but somebody give you money you're still hungry you can't eat the money but the money is the purchasing power to get the bread so when they get the money you can sh you can praise God you can smile because you have the purchasing power to get what you want glory to God hallelujah oh oh Hallelujah brother is trying to bring a certain Faith to the people a certain Faith so that they could get some of the promises effective to them so here what he said here now I have seen Saka cancer leave people by the same thing now maybe you won't able to receive it enough just to deliver you all of of a sudden so maybe you might not that great fith to get that breakthrough for the cancer or the tumor or whatever to be so you bring an alternative but I might say tonight I want to talk to you a moment and say this if you can't receive enough Faith to be healed instantly then you take the adopted baby root did you ever hear about adopting a baby if you take a young woman and she's married and she and a husband she is scared she isn't going to have a baby she wants one but she's scared and job said the things that I fear must come upon me you take that same woman and let her adopt a baby and then she'll have one it quiets her if you haven't got enough Faith to receive now as a miracle then take the adopted baby attitude explain what that is say lord it's mine because you promise it I'll go from here tonight praising you just the same as I was well so you may be sick but if you take the adoped baby root thank you Lord for healing me thank you Lord for delivering me I am praising you if you don't praise him you don't believe because Abraham St not at the promise of God to unbelief so God promises is true but says can we walk up there and take a hold of God's promise and say it is truth I claim it I own it it is mine God give it to me do you realize all these words spoken here active words it's not you sitting down in passivity it's you hearing the word and said I claim it I own it God give it to me it's mine I claim it I own it God give it to me it is mine I claim it I own it God give it to me it is mine oh glory to God hallelujah Give the Lord some prais I claim it I own it God give it to me and it is mine I claim my healing I own it God give it to me I'm healing his mind I claim it I claim Joy I claim the Holy Ghost I CLA Riv IA TR give it to me is I my children I C my husband I my wife for it and it is the Lord Glory hallelu Glory wow glory to God hallelujah okay okay let's go here are some comments I want to share with you the season of adoption is coming first for fivefold Ministry adoption Time by Dynamics to the mechanics to go out with the ministry of Jesus Christ these men these adopted men these sons who was going to be adopted would have the Father's Love approval and Confirmation these time tested son would have been formed into the word image capped by the Capstone of Love they would have this ministry of perfection for the Bride of Jesus Christ this ministry would be International because it would be to the body of Christ the manifestation of Dynamics would identify that the season is here so I just want to finish off on Friday a quick recap whatam said the first man he made was in His image and we are returning back to that image our first created image so your purpose that God put you here is to get you back to the image that man fell from because God said let us make man in our image and in our likeness God has purpose and he will not cancel that purpose he has purpose that you are going to get back to that first created image and I say to you that you are predestinated to be formed into this image Oh Glory to God now this is where we stopped on Friday here on Earth here now here we have formed to the this is not church thing now I'm joining the church and shaking p no this is a little more than that here we are formed to the word image to be a partaker of the word to feed on the word by being predestinated since the beginning so God predestinated you on your journey you didn't start the work you didn't call yourself you didn't pull yourself no man can't come my father him so the father has drawn you whe it was in adultery whe it was drinking whether it was smoking he didn't look at what you was doing he called you anyhow who he you who he you he call who he call Justified he call you and justify you oh give the Lord some Praises glory to God hallelujah hallu hallelujah hallelujah glory to God now Jesus he was the word and he knew all things but we bypass that you come like Adam you come like me you come from attribute the flesh to be tempted oh we missed the word that's why we have to be tempted oh let's go again we have never become the word we just become fleshman not the word which makes it clear you will never be the word unless you were a thought at the beginning that proves the predestination of God because the word is a thought expressed so in God's mind in the back part of his mind you are a seed a gene a GM attribute the back part of his mind this was before the beginning Oh Glory to God because in the beginning what's the word but before the beginning what the thought or the attribute Satan he came in the beginning but you you were before the beginning in his mind in his thinking and that is why I talk about because will take Faith to take a hold of it God give it I claim it and it is mine I believe it I receive it that I was in God's thinking if I was a thought I can become the word because the word is a god Express to God so if you have to be formed into the word image means you have to be a thought in God's mind stop looking at your flesh stop looking at your I am preaching to you the it's not what you think it's what said Oh Glory to God hallelujah hallelujah I will say it again it's not what you think it's what God Said and what God you is you hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelu I don't care what your flesh tell you I don't care what the devil tell you God about you that's you that's [Applause] I can give an example Gideon G the mighty man not me I am the I am the this I am the that son I'm talking about and he was that oh that's why I say to you Friday night the devil know how the life you were living before he know what you are he know what you was that is not the devil's problem his problem he don't know what you have to become the devil problem he don't know what you have to become because that what you have to become cannot be canell God can't change it because God my word not when God speak word through you over you about you hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God hallelujah hallelujah is that what you think is that what you feel Oh Glory to God the woman at the well Jesus he needs Pastor Samaria because he had the book he was the book he had her name she didn't know what she was she was prostituting herself she was living with this one and that one he never ask her those questions he asked her one question to see what kind of heart she how honest he was and when he said and he finish it up to God said woman loose you are free Oh Glory to God she saw her name and she ran I said come here she couldn't bother other sister talking about what the Neighbors about her de problem the son of man free it's free indeed set you free you are going to be free this morning I dance I sh God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah good [Applause] [Music] to Hallelujah you see this thing sweet you and my friend in Grenada will say eat it nice this this word is eat nice taste good you say in order to stand Temptation listen to these words now in order to stand temp you had to bypass your theophany we're going to find out why that is you had to come down in flesh to be tempted by sin I'm I'm I'm still reading these are not my thoughts but you byass the and become flesh man to be tempted by sin and when this body receives the spirit of God The Immortal Life inside of you shows this body in subjection won have to say if I could just quit drinking just get into Christ because your body is subject to the spirit and your body becoming subject to the spirit try to live the right kind of life and when you become subject to that spirit it throws your whole being subject to that Spirit are you ready and that spirit is nothing in the world but the seed word made manifest or Quicken Jesus said the words that I speak they are spirit and they are life so Jesus Jesus released the spirit in word form so when you receive the seed God has just turn the switch and that word turn into Spirit that's why Jesus said the kingdom is within you because the word is within you and when the word turn to Spirit you in the Kingdom you're not looking for the kingdom the kingdom is in you give the Lord pra so when people reject the word they reject the spirit so the foolish virgin hallelujah hallelujah they couldn't get the oil they didn't have that word in them to turn into the spirit Oh Glory to God remember we told you the Holy Spirit fell on the Pentecostal they couldn't come to Perfection they couldn't manifest Christ they manifested gifts because the word was lacking and the word comes to the prophet and they reject the prophet now the word is what forms the word image image has to be created from the word itself the PC that so God couldn't adopt them when the prophet came he brought on the age of adoption I'm going to close this part to wrap up this Holy Spirit pick up your pick up and it said this in these last days the true bright Church comes to The Headstone will be a super Church a super as they near the great headstone here we go there will be so much like him there will be in his very image in order to be United with him they will be one what you see now is not going to see them you see people fighting and struggling but the prophet I claim it it is mine the bride will be not maybe will be that's a prophecy hanging over you you believe you the bride do you believe you the bride but you have to be in his very image that means you have to be formed to the word Oh Glory to God here's the secret the word is in the bride and she has the mind of Christ to know what he has done with the word so that that wraps up Friday all right I finish Friday Part all right this is this morning all about the so God tell Samuel one of Jess's son and you know what happened and the tall son came in with that fancy suit and that cologne good Samuel said surely this is he God said hold it so not so far don't just go anint because the man looking good and you know the story for David but we choose by sight I'm reading God choose by character you see God know the inside hallelujah hallelujah do you get it now the character of the church is what Jesus looks for is not right he is looking for a character there we go he chooses a bride to reflect his character here we go he is looking for the day for the bride to be formed form you see this building here one day it was gravel that was building material that was not the building that building material is what was taken and formed this building so what you have got and what we have got by The Prophet's message is building material those virtues fa virtue knowledge right on up that's building material but the same building material have to be formed you don't take a bag of c and it up in the air and say building it doesn't build so have to mix it gravel water you have to labor have to lay the brick Brick by Brick come on to me come you got to labor Oh Glory to goduck Virtue by virtue hallelujah hallelujah is looking for the day prophecy that the bride for the bride to be formed Hebrews it just like he was he's got to be the same flesh Same Spirit and until the church becomes that they not one so therefore how could the Holy Ghost behave in one man and misbehave in another man something is wrong the Holy Ghost canot behave in one and misbehaving the other because the Holy Ghost will conform your nature his nature the Lord hallelujah hallelujah let's go he said I know your tribulation I am not at all unmindful of your suffering what a stumbling block this is so many people they wonder if God really loves them how can God be just and L him if he stands by and watches his people suffer you see they could not figure out God's love are you ready Church they thought that love meant no suffering they thought that love meant a baby with parental care but God said his love was elective love the proof of his love is election no matter what happen his love have proven that God has chosen you to Salvation to the sanctification of the spirit and the belief of Truth he may commit you to death as he did Paul he may commit you to suffering as he did job that is his prerogative he is Sovereign but it is all with a purpose listen to this if he did not have a purpose then he will be the author of [Music] frustration and not peace are you ready his purpose is that after we suffer a while we would be made perfect come on now Hallelujah don't pull back don't pull back after suffer glory to God hallelujah hallelujah be made perfect be established strengthen be settled oh myre 8 speaking about Jesus though he were a son here we go yet he learned he [Music] obedience by the things which he suffered or Prophet or evangelist we talking about Jesus he learned come on now we we wasn't born obedience we wasn't born children of God of God because all have sin so don't play self-righteous all have and come short of the glory but Jesus OB in plain language the very character of Jesus was perfected by suffering and according to Paul he has left his church a measure of suffering that they too by their faith in God while suffering for him would come to a place of perfection then the question was why did he want this answer James 1 2-4 you ready for it my brethren count all joy you quiet the place my brethren counted all joy when you fall into divver temptation knowing this that the TR of your faith at patience patience have a perfect work that you may be perfect and entire wanting nothing why does he do that Romans eight if children ears of God if we claim to be children automatically we are you have inheritance then you have property you have land you have money you have houses something because you a but then the Bible went on it says for I reckon that the suffering of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which be revealed us so what are you going through right now praise God what are The Temptations going right the challeng is going right Nowa what we are preaching this morning it's not worth to be Shake It Off like how Paul shake off the snake sh it off glory to God hallelujah hallelujah they looking for to die but he Shake It Off and people looking for you to die Shake It Off The Devil want to kill you but sh it I shall not die but live to declare the works of the Lord the Lord Hasen me but he had not given me over un Oh Glory to God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah I Reon that the suffering of this present time is not worthy it's not worthy you can't compare it you cannot compare it don't put it on the same scale glory to God hallelujah hallelujah do you understand all the billionaires who have the private jets private boats private plane when they die they not taking none of through them do you understand that this world is temporary 67 years out here not this [Music] world they never pass away the new house going to get old one day the new car have to be sold one we have something the devil didn't give and the devil take Oh Glory to God hallelujah hallu God going to leave you in your Baptist Church but God call you you better praise God praise God hold onto your seat if you don't want to worship God will bring people in here to bless his name and Shout the Praises [Applause] of Hallelujah hall [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Glory Glory Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God be thankful be grateful don't like the pig the pig under the tree and all the apples fall on his head and he not looking upun grun look up and for goodness forth than strength thank you for your pastor than you for the word thank you for the church the Lord has oh Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah glory to [Applause] God millions of people church this morning you are one in a million you are special Oh Glory to Oh Glory you're going to overcome overcome the poor overcome oh blessed be the Lord [Applause] unless we suffer with him we cannot r with him you people sit and say they believe this message they forgot lost his wife they forgot lost his child for to shoot himself and the bullet juston go up he lost the anointing for years nobody he and for five years you have to preach the gospel you have to pray for the sick forget that he suffered he sang the song on the wings of a snow white though I have suffered in so many ways mealing on the wing [Applause] of that is here healing to you to you rejoice in the word rejoice in what he prom say I it it is mine give it to me hallelujah hallelujah glory to God unless we suffer with him we cannot re with him you have to suffer to rain the reason that is this the character simply is never made without [Applause] suffering you like your poor you struggle when you have your children tell yourself you w don't want them suffer like you so you give them and give them and as they give them after they give me give me give me and then they feel entitled and then you have a bunch of entitled Rascals waiting for things to come to and we spoil children if you notice in the Bible oneck on mesck on Noah Joshua he straighten out David and he want to straighten you out oh give the Lord some prais that don't mean you not son he said as many as I love I rebuke and chasing not as many who love me not as many who love the Lord I love correct them straighten them out so you better start to correct and straighten out oh give the Lord some prais is a victory not a gift a man without character can't re because power apart from character is satanic I have met ministers gifted men zero character gifted men but they should be in Parliament and politics politicians they are genuine man but in the pit men I don't even know if they Sav because you're not seeing any Christlike you're seen a Waring Spirit unprincipled spirit and they hate the sovereignity of the local church they hate that because if they pull that off then they can come and take over preach it because God love it because that's how the nian Spirit come in the beginning big churches try to conquer smaller churches and then they take the anointing from the people and put it on a message I call it a message Po and a message po everybody supposed to follow this from rooms and he on in the message come all right so power with character is f to rule and the little temporary suffering that we go through now is not worthy to be compared with the glory that we revealing us when he comes get start isn't it strange that God wants us to develop Christ like character that comes through suffering no sir and we all have trial we are all tried and chasen as here this bum the church that is not suffering and is not being try isn't of God amen so other words it's terrible to have a Santa Claus Church long the reding and not CL listen to The Prophet now this special condition in SM must be applied to every free age there is no age free from it there is no True Believer free from it this is of god this is the will of God and it is needful there we go we need the Lord to teach us the truth that we are to suffer and be Christlike in doing it you're suffering but you tell yourself just because I don't want to [Music] hit only because I'm a church boy that's what we talking about you suffering being Christlike in your situation you know how much time David can kill how much time David can kill s [Applause] God was not testing Sal God was testing David God is Not testing those you to see if you will for to see if you will you will P your try circumstan miss your condition what you will [Applause] do my God your blessing hanging over you God is looking for your reaction to God make me a God is looking for your reaction hallelujah hallelujah the woman about to die a son last meal Elijah come up and say woman bake me a cake first you know what she did she B him and he said the Lord your bar not going to run going there Wasing in the land but for you when all of the bands are empty Joseph [Applause] everywhere but in Joseph in the pyramid have gra Give the Lord some Praises this morning some hallelujah hallelujah there we go how am I going to finish this let's go preach I like that hallelujah hallelujah we can't stop now pull back the we take off from the ground Hallelujah hallu back Hallelujah let's go the cloudy skies and the storms of life and no signs of God disappoint neither are the bright [Music] skies and Still Waters be a sign of his approval his approval of any of us is in the Beloved so did you get that things dark around you you know Bible but Jesus was in the boat and the Bible said the wind were contrary not everything is what did I do did I why am I going through this sometimes the winds are you didn't start it you didn't create it you are in the boat with Jesus but the winds are contrary Jesus is tired Jesus in a deep sleep and disciples singing specials open the St away when they recognize they say go with Jesus Jesus with with with with sleepy eyes watch that St Hallelujah Hallelujah he send peace and blow the storm he said peace be still and the storm roll up the blanket roll up like a baby and Jesus said oh he of little faith and went back to sleep I love him this morning oh glory to God to the black sky Sky doesn't mean God disapproves the bright Sky The Still Waters doesn't mean God approve his love is elective does he love us yes yes he loved us and he brought us to himself and give us of his spirit and how shall I prove my love for him this is the key right here how shall I prove my love to him and I think my church know this thing by Heart by believing what he said and by conducting myself with joy amidst the trial he in his wisdom allows to come to pass amen so that means next service everybody inside of him should be coming here with [Applause] joy everybody because whatever you're going through you're supposed to conduct yourself with joy then you could join with David David said I was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the Lord so the goal of God is a Christlike character producing the fiery fness of naked I came into the world but naked we shall not go we will take our character now what kind of character will you take you will it be his own character that was molded by his suffering of the try of your Fai work at patience there is absolutely no other way to gain patience it has to come by the tri and a Fai that is not tested cannot be trusted so if you claim to have faith was in a prophet to turn our hearts back to the Fai of the father it has to be a tested that becomes an approved F so you sit here saying amen and some say but you're not getting tested here unless you're cross with some brother or sister when you leave back to your home back to the job back by that miserable neighbor and that terrifying boss and that job you want to leave and you leave yet because you get another one you want God to take you out not asking God to take it through take me out take me out

patience and Perfection is patience waiting on God and waiting for God this is the process of character development waiting on God and waiting for now this here is the core code entire message of how

walking in America thundering voices de hell your life light up glory to God from a distance every devil know who you are there's a light over you give the Lord over you fire over you oh glory to God you saw deep call to the Deep when the woman was coming up to and she reached a certain spot she back that's okay just in other words around him the Angels atmosphere atmosphere around the prophet

go words living hallelujah hallelujah he didn't have to talk said the devil he didn't have to say nothing the devil was scared right there he know he had to leave because here come a life not a sermon but a life he said come out of him so listen to this this is where the real Ministry comes in the ministry of Jesus Christ but Ram says the church is weak we are broke up but that is the way it's supposed to be so don't open big we break up we broke up kind he said that's is how it's supposed to broken up but we need there will come a message and listen to these words now we need the ministry of Jesus Christ fit The Headstone y soat man talking about Ephesians 4 you say remember don't try to take the other man office some evangelist some pastors some teachers for the Perfection of the Saints who are the Saints sanify one for the working of the ministry and then brand slip in a mystery for Revelation right here for the working of the ministry the ministry of Jesus Christ so men who claiming to be def fightful Ministry they can't claim that they have to have deep Ministry of Jesus Christ you're hearing about speak from this is Ministry God give me but I have to be placed positionally with the ministry of Jesus Christ to be effective in Ministry so right now I am doing the work of a pastor for almost 40 years whatever waiting to be placed by Dynamics I can't place myself because God steps in the church not man appoint when God man do you understand that when God put you in position and put his stamp upon you your sign just as good as GL God as God who you H is H who you fire is fir are you with me all right am now watch he said billing he said now watch it start with faith and virtue and so right then we are waiting for the headone which is love and he controls and he's the strength of every one of these things all right okay so Peter said here first seven things Faith to love and then the watch and then the love of God the Holy Ghost after adding all these seven things Christ in the person of the Holy Ghost comes upon you in the true baptism of the Holy Ghost and you got all these virtues SE to you when when a man possesses these kind of things then the Holy Ghost comes upon him no matter you might speak with tongue and but until these virtues go into [Music] you and when these virtues grow in watch words now every word is important and you add it to that then you become a living Monument then begin to pray and this is for the five Ministry Build Me Up Oh Lord into this let Christ be my head working on the foundation my faith let virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness and brotherly kindness working me oh lord is my prayer live or die sink or drunk friend or no friend let Christ virtue his knowledge flow out flow out that I might be able to teach those so in other words God have to empower the ministry with virtue and knowledge the flo of the people no we cannot give what we don't have we have to have it to give it not have it just by Revelation but have it by experience expence Oh Glory to God now Jesus said as many have received him the word to them give power to become the sons of God so virtue right after Faith it's a power it's a spirit to make you add the rest of the life Oh Glory to God so watch this let me finish this here for God has set in the church prophets teachers and so on what for for the perfecting are you ready and bringing all these virtues into it for that Perfection of the coming of the Son of God so the fight for Ministry is to bring these virtues into you so you got stay home and be perfected reading book there's got to be a f Minister stand to minister to you because the spirit picks up what you have need hallelujah hallelujah the spirit know exactly what you have need Oh Glory to God and the spirit way to to that is that the man his Minister Spirit dropping down to speak hallelujah hallelujah the prophet says when these things are operated in you then you are sealed Oh Glory to God that is where Visions come it's operating in you so the ceiling is the evidence that the word image is formed the spirit is here to operate it now you can operate it by revelation I let say this way you know husband and wife talking and they quarreling and there's a knock on the door witness God bless just so in other words according to who comes by the door hallelujah hallelujah but it wasn't Hallelujah inside there you see you operating it you play nice guy you play nice girl but when they start to operating you by the spirit it's different for example when the two people was making love in the church said to him if you say blind they'll be blind if it's a de they will die whatever I'm give some Cho watch what he did God talk to him he can you know now here you know ministers would like that option and then come and give a testimony speak the word and they die in church muscles with power see why God not giving them power watch this all the options God gave the prophet he I forgive you because brotherly kindness was operated in him it was living in him give the Lord some praise hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah remember it wasn't always that way it wasn't

ch we almost there all right let's go forming the word image this thing forming I write I read a whole backdrop of stuff like a curtain to come to this spot in order to stand Temptation you have to bypass your tea off and to become fresh to be tempted by sin that's why you are here the fold Ministry Pastor Prophet ET by the ministry of Jesus Christ through the ministry of Jesus Christ will bring the bride to Perfection by horning or shaping the bride into the wood image of Jesus Christ these are my words which blueprint is form in second Peter [Music] 14 and as you start to be formed to the world image the Dominion of sin will release his grip off of you as you start to be shaped the grip that the devil have on you take his hands off because you're being formed you're being shaped because the Bible says that we shall be changed from glory to glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord Oh Glory of God the glory of Fai the glory of virt to back off towards your towards the

love perfect peace perfect Joy all those seven spirits that made up God was Perfection he's talking about Elohim because before he was God he was Elohim and then when the Angels were created then he became God so before the beginning there was seven perfect Spirits the Fountain of God in those Spirits was your thoughts was you the je isn't that right and the prophet said and the only way we can come back to Perfection is to come after to that Perfection which is God oh glory to God patience tested don't you worry Satan will K them for you I I'm adding virtual knowledge I still ain't got the Holy Ghost I had patience I misbehave myself Oh my he said what is it it's a birth listen to these words I've been put into this pointing to the pyramid in other words into this into this this into fa
