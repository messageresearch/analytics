a message what an anointing so i greet you this morning in the precious name of jesus christ it's hugely a great privilege and honor to be in the house of god and i'd like to go straight to the word if you have your bibles would you turn with me to two portions of scripture you want to read from the book of ephesians and we'll read from the book of jude through scriptures this morning thank you musicians thank you brother gideon for the worship this morning amen so ephesians chapter 6 and reading from verse 10. finally my brethren be strong in the lord and in the power of his might so it's not even your might and your strength is not your strength but your strength is in the lord finally my brethren be strong in the lord and in the power of his might put on the whole armor of god that he may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of god that he may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand stand there for having your loins get about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace and above all taking the shield of faith where it he shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of god and reading from jude reading from chapter 1 reading verse 3 jude 1 3 beloved when i give all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the sins can we bow our heads for a word of prayer heavenly father we thank you this morning to be in your house we thank you for your anointing that's already here we thank you for your presence father we thank you for your grace your love your mercy towards us we thank you for your word that is life to us it's it's our breath it's our strength it's our bread it's our water it's our fountain it's our source it's our it's our encouragement it's when we can't go any more we can look to the word and be encouraged father because there's power in the word there's healing in the world your prophet taught us rapture and fate is laying in the word it's in the message lord there's power in a message it's a vindicated messages are vindicated worded it needs no more vindication it's already vindicated it's already real it already pushed back the devil every single time and lord we come this morning to apply the word to our lives may you walk out the pages of the bible may you anoint me your fresh father though my body's under pressure but rather in your presence lord there's no problem there's no challenge there's no obstacle there's no tiredness there's no sickness there is no pain there's no heart ache there's no trial there's no test there's no temptation father it all feed away this morning in your presence and then you speak to your people may you search every heart every life may you minister to every father every mother every daughter every son every brother every system you break the chains and break the yokes and break the bands of wickedness lord as your word taught us through the scripture we wrestle not against flesh and blood but they are principalities and they are powers but your word gave us a solution you will give us a way out your will give us a way to overcome fathom so lord this is a message this morning for the overcomers may you speak to us may you take me out of the way may you speak lip to ear to your children lord not my thoughts not my words lord if it's for five minutes or one hour lord may you deliver your people father we don't want to just have church but we want to have results we don't want to have church we want to have a reality an experience with a supernatural an encounter with the pillar of fire may you touch everyone in our midst and there's a back slide in the house today lord media you know maybe they're backslidden on the outside maybe they're passing on the inside lord that nobody knows there's a problem on the inside we want to turn it over this morning and say lord may you restore your people may you lift your people up lord there are people in the house this morning they have lost their joy but may you restore their joy because the joy of the lord is our strength and we can't fight if we don't have strength to fight law but in the midst of it you said let the weak say that i am strong for father me you strengthen the weary may you lift up the feeble hands lord and lord there are many people came this morning they didn't get to pray this morning it's a shame but lord we thank you for your blood that lord will cover the past and cover our mistakes and our failures so we want to take some time to pray right now we want to take some time to forget about ourselves and concentrate on you and worship you father lord we want to be in the atmosphere because nothing can happen unless we are in the atmosphere so father as a church of the living god we unite in fear this morning father we unite in prayer this morning we unite in conviction this morning lord they are sick in our midst this morning father we want to catch a burden for the sick in the church this morning lord call me you move through the camp may you heal the sisters anyone with female condition high blood pressure whatever it is this morning we want to bring our sisters to you draws in the tabernacle we heard a note of praise from sister janice and she's waiting for more what she got last week was not

corner in the tabernacle lord we pray for the sisters the sisters that are weary the sisters that are tired the sisters that are holding on may you minister to their needs this morning may you

have not been this way before and we need the angel of the covenant we need the angel of the lord to direct every step you've already told us that every place that the souls of our feet trend is ours but lord we want to follow you this morning we want to walk where you walk we want to follow your instructions lord may the men of the church rise up may the sons of god rise up father there's an army this morning rising up to claim the inheritance to claim every promise that was laid down my malachi 4 father may you speak to the brothers may you speak to the young people you promised a visitation a visitation we cannot make it so once more lord a samson cried may we catch a burden all over the tabernacle right now church i want you to begin to pray right now i want you we're going to call on god i want to begin to cry out to god this is a different service this is a different service right now i want you to catch up with them you begin to tell god what you want you begin to cry out to god the holy ghost is already here he has taken over the service whatever your need is you begin to call upon him that's why we came here this morning we came to be in one mind in one accord in one place with one objective that objective is the holy ghost that objective is your freedom that objective is your breakthrough that objective is your deliverance that objective is all once more lord once more lord he is here this morning that's all right he is here this morning you could enter in i know you didn't expect it but god is a god of the unexpected he loves to switch things around if you are sick this morning you don't have to leave sick if you are backslidden this morning you do not have to leave backslidden if you are in sin this morning you could go and sin no more satan the blood of jesus is against you by the power of the resurrected lord jesus christ and the power of the holy ghost i take every spirit under my control for the honor and glory of god sickness you have no place up in this house doubt you have no place up in this house lost you have no place in this house fornication you have no place up in this house adultery you have no place in this house lying you have no place

the house to go free oh i can't hear you lift your voices i can't hear you if your voice is him this morning oh you break past the sound barrier brace past your limitation break past every restriction break past every obstacle he is still a healer he is still a provider he is still a waymaker he is still a restorer there is nothing he cannot fix there is nothing he cannot turn around he is the doctor he is your lawyer he is your banker oh you talk to him right now you talk to him we're gonna preach in a while but you talk to him right now oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah he wants to hear from you you are his children he wants to hear how you doing he wants you to talk to him he wants you to have a relationship with him we are there are sick people in here they spawn him but they are going to be healed but he said we have not because we ask not so we want to ask this morning and brother branham said ask for big things we want to ask for big things has thrown him not ask for small things we want to ask for big things is anything too hard for the lord we want to ask for all young people to be restored it may seem like a big thing it may seem like a hard thing but is anything too hard for the lord blessed be the name of the lord blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah don't stop now this is the atmosphere where something can happen it's in the anointing it's the anointing and makes the difference how long will we be slack consuming his promises it's the anointing that makes the difference he wants to fill you with the holy ghost he wants to heal you he wants to deliver your family young brother young sister he wants to bless you he wants you to be happy he wants you to be successful god wants you to be happy he wants you to be adopted he wants you

it away my child cannot take it away my testing cannot take it away oh blessed be the name of the lord oh just keep worshipping him i'm waiting on him this morning you keep worshipping him this morning oh it's a deliverance service i didn't plan this this morning but the angel of the lord would have been read about the angel of the covenant hacking unto his voice he'll be an enemy unto your enemies no weapon formed against you will prosper once you say enemy he'll back you up oh hallelujah hallelujah this morning depression is the enemy this morning frustration is the enemy this morning being backslidden is the enemy this morning not being sure where you stand that's the enemy you will be sure you will be convinced you will be concerned we will have a revival there will be an outpouring there will be a visitation there will be a visitation young brother young system father mother elder deacon trusty usher i don't care what it is you press into the kingdom the kingdom is preached and has been preached but every man pressed his way into it you press your way this morning you press past your limitation press pass who's next to you press pass what's happening in your life and pull down charity pull down the holy ghost oh hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the lord oh hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah you have something to do god has something to do but you have something to do also it's your land he's given you the land but you must possess it you must take the land and you take the land by prayer you take the land by reading the word you take the land by claiming it you take the land by speaking until you take the land by sin by stripes i'm healed by stripes i'm healed by stripes i'm here by his stripes i'm healed that's how you possess the lamb brother i'm saying when you apply the token it's taking the word to yourself and you begin to speak it i'm going to be filled i'm going to be healed this demon of lust is finished this demon of fear it's over this demon of my past is behind me oh i'm going to forget the things that are possible i'm gonna forget my mistakes i may have fallen short up but there's blood for you this morning there's blood for you this morning and there's power in the blood the blood is protecting you this morning the devil cannot get under the blood he cannot get under there you are protected you are covered by the blood the blood is all over you it's the blood that made a way for you to be in the house of god this morning you couldn't even come if you wanted to you didn't invite yourself you didn't even drive yourself that word seed covered by blood brought you to the house of god you might have a righteous you might have pain in your body but that word seed is a perfect seed that word seed will turn your mortal into immortality that word seed will turn you from a worm into a butterfly that words heat will reverse the effects of aging that word seed will turn back that sickness that word seeds as a christine will make those eyes open up that hallelujah hallelujah get in the spirit now be in the spirit we can minister if you're not in the spirit you're not here to spectate you are here to participate it's a participation we are here for war it's a spiritual war you can't be here just to be a member you've got to be a warrior you cannot be a church member you've got to be a soldier you've got to be in the army because the attack is all around us it could be any day anytime but we are exhorted to put on the whole armor of god put on the whole hour of god so we can withstand every attack there'll be no attack that you cannot overcome there'll be no demon that'll stop you the house of hell will have to give way to the power that's in the bride of jesus christ that's the ministry that's upon yours right now recognize your day recognize your message recognize your ministry recognize your power recognize your word or recognize your messenger hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah forgetting the things that have passed forgetting your mistakes we are pressing this morning hallelujah hallelujah oh my you may be seated oh hallelujah if you can sit you may be seated but don't turn off the anointing don't turn on the fire anything could happen this morning i don't know what's about to happen but i'm totally surrendered this morning because i came this morning because i won my own touch i came this morning because like sister janet said i need more is there anybody in the house you need more you need more than yesterday you need more than words to say you need more than last service you need more than what you had for the last 10 years in church you need a living reality of the living god we don't need more church services we don't need more singing what we need is power what we need is healing what we need is the ministry of the spirit because the word has been preached every service word word word but now i'm on the expectation for the spirit to follow the word hallelujah you may be seated god bless you mr caleb it's good to see you in the house of god hallelujah something called you here you didn't bring yourself here nothing could bring you here but god because the bible says my sheep know my voice you were not here because of brother orville you were not even here because of the message you are here because god called you your relationship has to be with god oh if god didn't call you you would never last if god didn't call you you never make it but because god called you by name every time you fell something raised you black upward because my sheep know my voice when you heard you have no more strength something kept pulling you hallelujah you may be seated hallelujah between sundays on the money the enemy all up in your house and you feel all overwhelmed but the enemy has to come that's his job but there's a power that's in you that's keeping you alive it's all over you it's all over me it's keeping you alive it's keeping me alive it's that seven thunder seven seal message of malachi 4 it'll keep you in your school it'll keep you in your job it'll keep you in your home it'll keep you every day hallelujah hallelujah oh my god hallelujah hallelujah somebody's gonna go free we have not been this way before we don't know what's supposed to happen but i'm ready this morning and if you're not ready put on your seatbelt because the raptor express is about to take off we are about to fly out of here we don't want nothing from this world this world is finished this world is over but as for me and my house we will serve the lord as for me and my house is that your testimony this morning as for me and my house we will serve the lord you may be seated hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah somebody said jesus somebody say hallelujah somebody say thank you lord we should be so happy to wake up in the morning because we have access to the power of god many people want to access all kinds of stuff but you have automatic access to the blood and his grace and predestination that's what you have working for you you are predestinated that's working for you your predestination is working for you your predestination is greater than your failure your predestination is bigger than your sin your predestination is bigger than your present condition your predestination is bigger than what your mama said about you your predestination is bigger than what the devil says about you because your predestination takes you to your guaranteed destination hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah it's because he fought you he could predestinate you because he foreknew you he could call you and because he called you he's obligated to keep you because you belong to him he's obligated to protect you because you belong to him he's obligated to fill you because you belong to him he's obligated to move mountains for you to pass up to open red season for you to pass to open the river jordan for you to pass up he's obligated to take two fishes and five loaves up and feed you he's obligated to put you to walk on water he's obligated because you belong to him you belong to god you may be seated hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah he's able to take your high blood pressure and bring it to regular blood pressure he's the one who made the whole pressure system he's the one who made the heart he's the one who made the lungs there's no doctor that understands it the way he does there's no physician there's no specialist there's no doctor anywhere in the world who could operate up the way he could operate can't is there anybody in the house this morning who wants to trust a living god who sent a message to call you hallelujah with a random if we could get in one mind and one accord that in five minutes in five minutes there'll be not a sick person in our midst that's what i'm trying to see this morning one mind one accord forget about sin there's no place for sin this morning forget about your passive don't even let your mind go to it god call you he is the one who's gonna finish it you may be seated i still don't know what's happening this morning but for a title put on the whole armor of god for a subject earnestly contended for the fate that was past tense restored by malachi 456 inspiration warriors of the fate and i talk about all that i want to follow his message of drive them out because you can drive them out in your own strength you can't drive them out in your own ability you can't drive them up with your idea and your way but the bible says in ephesians finally my brethren after you've listened to everything i've said already paul is saying finally this is the big point everything i said is important but finally i don't want you to forget this thing my brethren be strong in the lord that alone made me feel good because sometimes i don't feel strong in myself i told my wife this morning i said yesterday i felt so sick i said i felt physically down i felt emotionally dumb i fell mentally tom i said the only thing was standing was my testimony i said the only thing i didn't knew was backslide because i felt so low in my body so low in my mind so low emotionally but my testimony was still standing and it's not my testimony it's his testimony because he put the word seed a seed germ a part of himself inside of us to make sure that you are here this morning to make sure that you can worship to make sure that when the word goes forth you hear your name you say that's me you are preaching to me you are talking to me how did the minister know what i was going through it's because the word is your name you may be seated hallelujah hallelujah so we are continuing to drive them out no place for the enemy we are not taking prisoners we are not trying to work a deal out we're not trying to negotiate there's no negotiation there's no compromising there's no let's see what we can work out there's only three words drive them out we are pushing back the attack of the enemy since the prophet left brother branham spoke of all kind of spirits that were operating in his day and operating in his meetings you know the prophet said sometimes he'd love to go by himself because even within the church people would be saying god bless you but he would see the thoughts in their hearts and realize that they were not with him they were saying the words with their mouths but they were not sincere and because he saw that he said he didn't want to see it all the time it was too much for him the hypocrisy was too real the hypocrisy was too troublesome for him so the prophet will pull himself away but there's coming a time when there will be coherence there will be a singularity what your mind and your heart says will be the same thing what your mouth says and what your heart says will be the same thing because nothing will be hidden we are moving into season and time because in the book of acts they thought it was peter that they were talking to but when peter heard what ananias said he said you didn't lie to me you lie to the holy ghost because the holy ghost already went on the inside and see what's going on so we are in another ephesians we are going to have a super church we're going to have a church without sin we're going to have a church where you could have made a mistake but before you even sit down you run to the ella and say pray for me because the holy ghost will be so real it'll call the sin of the church we're gonna have a perfect church up we're gonna have an ephesus church we're gonna have another ephesians we will have a church up that brother branham preached upon i don't care if it's five people if it's 10 people if it's 20 people the numbers are not important to call because one will put the thousands of flights up two will put ten thousand to flight three will put a hundred thousand to flight brother i just need a few more people to shake this island to shape this country to shake this world you may be seated hallelujah give me liberty or give me death i want liberty i want reality i must be free to come to the house of god and worship it cannot be that i leave church on sunday and between sundays by thursday i've lost the victory by friday i'm not feeling myself there must be a time when there's a permanence of character and there's a permanence of state there must come a time when you are so solid in christ as the bible said he had overcome it will i make a pillar in the tabernacle and he will go no more out there's coming a time when you've overcome and you have overcome and then you become like a rocker the wind blows you don't move the storms come you don't move the bible says you're a pillar in the tabernacle pillar in the house unmovable unshakable nothing can move you because you've been grounded and established by word and by experience by revelation and power by blood and fire god help us this morning to make a church that would make a revival that people will fly in to see the seven thunderstorms is being made manifested i'm counting down to the day when the cripples were walking here we won't even have to pray for them but the anointing will be all over the building the place milky white and the fade plants so high that as the word goes forth people catch faith hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah you may be seated called to do anything caleb i haven't seen you in a while but it just takes five minutes in the presence of god to turn over 40 years from moses for 40 years moses had lost his way for 40 years moses was just there he knew the word but he had no burden he was not convinced he was not concerned he knew there was something about his life but he needed an encounter he needed an encounter with something bigger than himself bigger than what his wife could say to him bigger than what his neighbor could say bigger than what the pastor could say and when he saw the burning bush the burning bush the only purpose you maybe seen it that the burning perceived was to attract his attention and god does many things to attract or interrupt you to get your attention and he doesn't need your attention for longer he just needs five minutes he doesn't need it for 82 hours to convince you because his power connects to the seed in you because there's a deep call into the deep up there's a deep to respond so even in moses blackstone condition there was something he was yearning for there was something he was looking for that's why when he saw the fire he said i will turn aside i will go up because i'm looking for something i don't know what i'm looking for but there's a thirst in my soul there's a need you may be seated and the only reason you could be in the house of god this morning it's because there's a thirst there is a need there is a desire there's something in you that's calling for something there's something in you that's needing something and we try to fill it with all kinds of stuff and the devil is good he is very good at trying to fill us up with all kinds of stuff god help us this morning but the reason you are here this morning is because no matter what the stuff is you have tried and how you spend your time you will never go to bed at night satisfied because god put the thirst in there and the music and books and positive self-talk and positive affirmation and saying i'm a believer even saying i'm in the message still doesn't quench the fist because the message coming to church the routine and the ritual that's all up here people program themselves to wake up on a sunday morning to come to church people program themselves they set an alarm in the morning it's a program that they're on but god isn't about programs he's not about routines and he's about rich world he's not about customs he's about whatever he wants to do his sovereignty could meet you on the road to damascus his sovereignty paul is on the road saw to do damage and god could interrupt him on a horse god could be mostly with a fire ambush god can meet elijah in the rustle of the mumberry tree god can meet you anywhere you could be driving down the road you could be on your job but you've got to be listening you've got to be looking for him you've got to be wanting him and you've got to recognize that he's the one that you are missing i pray this help somebody this morning finally my brethren be strong in the lord and in the power of his might his might put on the whole armor of god so it's no good to put on part of the armor and before you could even put on the armor you have to take off whatever you're wearing amen before you could put on his armor you have to take off what you are wearing amen amen there's the same naked in the world become a naked we do not leave and what you wear is your character what you wear is your bias your your feelings your way of doing things your way of resolving conflict your own perspectives your your history some of us will wear this i've done it this way for five years i don't talk to people i don't i don't like to talk to people i don't and that's what we're wearing you can't tell god i would like to talk to people because when god told peter go and talk to this one he couldn't say i like to talk to people so whatever you are wearing you have got to take it off to put on his armor put on the whole hour of god that we may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil the tactics of the devil the recommendations of the devil the bible says we are not ignorant of satan's devices devices we're not ignorant of his attacks in his plans and his strategy and he's very good and the bible goes on before we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places and i share this in nigeria i heard another preacher speak about it and he said nowhere from genesis to revelation do you find demons arguing with one another in fact when jesus was on the earth and he was healing the sick and doing miracles those ignorant pharisees and the people said it's by the power of blg bob that jesus is doing this and jesus said listen a house divided will never stop in other words the devil is smarter than allowing division in his own kingdom so his soldiers marched together so when jesus met the man with legion he asked who you are they say legion they're working in harmony multiple spirits but remember when you cast out one demon he goes to get back up come back with seven more that if you don't clean up the house he's gonna come back with more strength because he knew it took a power to clean him out what about the church of the living god we cannot be divided we cannot be separated it cannot be husband against wife and father against son and church against church and pastor against pastor we have got to stand united as one army because the enemy is united as one army but if we stand shoulder to shoulder that's why with the problem said the fight for ministry will have each one backing one another up because we need each other it's our enemy he's gonna come from every side but if we put shoulder to shoulder and back to back the devil is finished can the church say amen oh hallelujah what are you doing preacher we're gonna expose the devil at every one of his tricks we're gonna expose him because listen the devil could only operate if he is hidden but if you expose him he has to find somewhere else to go anybody with me this morning once he is hidden he could operate but the moment we shine light and open the cover and lift up the bed and find our way here and expose him he cannot stay exposed he has to go and find somewhere else to hide that's why when jesus came to that man who they call legion and he got exposed he said listen send me somewhere send me to the pigs because he can't stay there no more he has been exposed he has been identified and we're gonna shine light in every room of your house because once a light goes on the devil can hide no more and he has got to get out and want to never get out once that snake gets out there's no room for the holy ghost to fill every house to fill every room because fear and doubt cannot live in the same house of unbelief and faith cannot live in the same house light and darkness cannot live in the same house oh blessed be the name of the lord everybody feeling fine i'm just waiting on him this morning i have different notes but he's saying some things this morning to help you today it's exactly two months away from our convention and we have a responsibility we have a responsibility to be prayed up we have a responsibility to be under expectation we have a responsibility to fast and call upon god because there's no shortcut there is no other way to do it there's only one way and that's his way and no revival comes without sacrifice nothing worth having comes without sacrifice and when you can appreciate that and understand that it changes your perspective enough it changes your perspective completely you want success in the natural there is no success without sacrifice you can live any life you want but if you want what people who work hard get there's no shortcut to working hard they're people who work 18 hours a day for five years and when you see them it's like he's successful until you are ready to do the 18 hour days you're not ready yet and if people in the natural could do 18 hour days for a purpose that they have in their heart to achieve what about the spiritual how much praying must we do to have good success how much meditation must we do to have good success how much talking to god must we do to get him to operate on our behalf and to move things on our behalf because whenever you get into his business he starts to take care of your business my god from a message of total deliverance then just like you if you are a christian god don't make any halfway christians god makes complete christians god don't make halfway preachers but the preacher can be halfway and god makes his children christians but sometimes they're halfway christians it's not god's intention for them to be that way it's their own ways god mixed up with the plan of god for their life and that's what makes them the way they are god don't want to be halfway christian or halfway preachers compromising on either side so that compromising that giving back room for the devil to operate that's what we are going at this morning to drive them out completely so brother proclaimed a message let me just touch my text a little bit and see what god will do for the next few minutes proclaim the message of shout message to call the bride to war this message was the places in another ephesians and i connected to another ephesians because brother stephen preached a masterpiece i believe two sundays ago about possessing your inheritance and brother already followed it would drive them out placing us in joshua and we know from the word that joshua and ephesians are parallels of each other so i wanted to pick it up from the ephesian side so this message that brother branham brought was the places in another ephesians or said another way to place us into the land of the inheritance the land of promise the holy ghost land and divide the inheritance to us because each of us have our own inheritance each of us have our own place each of us have our own position and it's only in your place or your position you could properly defend yourself when you are on your territory you have a right to defend yourself when you are on your property you have a right to protect your family when you are on your territory you have a right to do what you have to do because it's yours and this word came to let you know what is yours this world came to let you know that healing is yours this word came to let you know that the holy ghost is yours and once you know it's yours it puts you in a position to fight for what is yours you cannot be in the club and fight for something in the club because the club is not yours you can be your open worldly music and fight for that because that's not yours but when you are in the will of god you can fight recklessly fight because when you are in his will he is obligated to back you up in his will brother branham taught us that jesus is authority was based on his position so when you are in your position the position brings within a certain authority you may see it for a minute the authority that comes with position has nothing to do with your standing the authority that comes with your position has nothing to do with your standing i'll give you an example a police officer could be a corrupt police officer but when he wears the police officer uniform and tells you to stop the fact that he is corrupt doesn't take away the authority he has to tell you to stop because his authority is based on his position the prime minister of the country could be crazy but that doesn't change the fact because he holds the position he has the authority to speak an action is taken when you are in your position it comes with an authority now what the devil wants to do is attack your standing he wants to tell the police officer you made a mistake yesterday so forget the uniform forget the backup because a police officer could pick up his radio and say backup wanted but the devil says don't touch the radio forget your uniform because you made a mistake last week you made a mistake yesterday don't look in the mirror because if you look in the mirror you will see you have on the uniform don't look in the mirror because you will see you resemble the rest of people who make things happen that's what the devil does but if you look in the mirror of the world you could see that maybe you're not where you're supposed to be but your boots are polished you have a gun on your side there's a radio for backup you might be tired but don't let the devil see you make the mistake of touch the radio and sometimes it's better to pick up the radio than to touch the gun because with a gun you could take on one maybe two but three but with the radio jesus said i can call legions to support if i want armies i can call for them but you maybe see them what are you saying by the isaac there's some wounded eagles in here this morning but being wounded has not taken off your uniform you may be wounded this morning but that being wounded because battle has you scarred sometimes you get shot in this arm and this arm don't want to walk sometimes that's called righteous by the way but that's the enemy's job to send a bullet your way but your uniform is still on maybe you lost a helmet maybe you put this morning put black on the whole armor of god so you could stand against every attack of the enemy you may be seated and the bible said i haven't done all but a clearance stand stand haven't done all after you've done all you can still stand when you've tied you know what to say when you're at the end of the rope you ever said that when you're the end of the rope tie your knot and hang on when at the end of the rope tie a knot and hang on after you have done that still stand after you have explored a knock and every door still stand diversity haven't done all to stand stand you know why because backup is on its way you know how many wars people didn't think were going to be one and they say hold the line hold the line there's only three of us remaining it's a thousand hold the line back up it's on the way somebody's saying man i pray that this helps somebody this morning [Music] but every day you are in the word and the word becomes more real to you it brings clarity to your position it brings clarity to your purpose it brings clarity to what you wake up in the morning to do because when you have purpose and clarity it focuses your actions when you don't know what you are supposed to do you do 82 things that are not important an activity doesn't mean you're doing something that's relevant don't even let me go there there are people in jobs doing a lot of stuff that's not relevant just activity put the paper from here to here then move from here to here put it from here to here here to here anything here anything here how was work did they work was good i did a lot of stuff activity not relevant how does it contribute to the profits i don't know does it add revenue i don't know what are you doing for the put it from here to here but from here to here why because my boss told me put it from here to here when i'm done put it from here to here so we just don't want activity we wonder when we walk we're walking with direction and purpose that's when you pray you're not praying rambling you're praying with purpose because you're praying with revelation of what to ask for so the way god taught us to pray say you pray for us our father who art in heaven first you stop with worship hallowed be thy name it's a structure god give you the formula for success our father hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done you haven't asked for anything just yet you are giving him worship honor glory acknowledging the authority you're talking to thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven when you establish his authority and then he said oh give us this deal with daily bread and you begin to get into your request but when you when you approach it in a balanced workforce approach to god it can be your way it must be his way when you approach it right then you could get into a spirit of the lord's day the spirit of this day and ask what you need request what you need and see god make it happen because your approach is right amateurs say amen is this helping anybody this morning and god is more concerned about your attitude than your actions i'll say it again god is more concerned about your attitude than your action are you willing you're doing it but you're not doing it willingly asked you to help them you help them but you help them grudgingly you really want to help them know but you help them because they know you're a christian and they ask you and you're supposed to have a testimony i really want to give it vex so as far as you can say nobody could pin and say he doesn't go the extra mile you know but god is saying you see the way his approach his attitude that's why the bible speaks about david's men his least desire was their command it was the way they approached they had so much respect for the man of god that when he nodded they were ready to move his leases that was a command to them and they did it willingly so when he wanted a drink of water they cut through the philistines because i know he wanted a drink of water and when david saw how willing they were he said he couldn't even drink the water he poured it as a sacrifice to the lord because the attitude of his men so how must our attitude be to the kingdom and to the things of god it's a marvel to me because we're talking about warfare i'm talking about warfare means you're talking about being in the army of the lord and anybody who has exposure with the credit force or army or military there are a lot of rules and standards and regulations and there's a lot of training because there are people you know the people who are in the army who never went to war [Music] and watch now they can march enough they could salute they could do organic but they never went to war but in the army they're focused on the training because you never know when you're called into action but the difference with us is we are in a war so there's no match match match after one you're trained you're giving a gun on your center to go and fight just go and fight fight kill something kill or be killed that's right it's either you let that diabetes get you or you get it yeah yeah it's your choice people say is it my diary cheese and opinion either you claim it or you push it back this morning i'm sending it back every morning you gotta say diabetes you're finished i'd write this you're finished can't say you're finished every day you have the diabetes on the ropes you have people on on the ropes you put it on the ropes you're letting go as the day goes on this headache has got to go by striped i am healed what is that that's warfare that's warfare you maybe see that so you mean you me to tell me there are sick people in here who don't put pressure on your sickness really that's what wolfie is you are cheering it back sitting and you don't claim them every day you're not serious you don't really want him to come back but warfare means the devil must know you serious every day every single day lord i clear my children today satan take your hands of my children every day but when you are convinced and concerned it becomes easy to pray because you know what you're praying for but then i'm taught that they take adopted son to drive with the philistines so after you deal with the hittites they have a rising ammo right the jebusites the king of sites are you ready for philistines you say lord i need this adoption father you have to adopt me whatever it takes i need to make it guide me to data adoption today today every day like that so you want to get the philistines too you want to drive them out too somebody's amen you may be seated so that's how you declare war on the enemy you declare war in your house every day every day say lord i claim my prayer life lord give me a burden for prayer lord give me a burden for praise you in a maxi you're waiting on a taxi but you decline on you declaring war the devil don't even have room to enter your mind because you're always on the offensive there's no need to defend anymore because you just push them you're just throwing grenades he destroyed bombs he won the attack every time the devil sees you saying that there has to be an easier target there has to be somebody easier because but the church is always on the attack but it's always on the attack that's how we must be put on the whole armor of god and drive them out i pray this helps somebody in here because i know many people here apply the token and people don't know what to do but you know what the prophet said he said when you apply the token you take the word to yourself you believe every word you act upon every word you claim every word and when you do that then the devil knows you mean business and god also knows that you mean business so as a church can we pledge to be on the offensive from this day is there anybody here this morning from this day on you would be on the offensive from this day on you'll be in prayer from this day on you'll be in worship and commitment and dedication because that's what it takes to see results in your home in your life in the church on your job you see doors open up for you you don't even expect to open up because you're anointing all over you all around you jesus himself had to pray to keep in that atmosphere because prayer keeps you in an atmosphere it's impossible i said it some weeks ago it's impossible to get there from praying and go and argue with your wife that is too big of a leap it's too big it has a way off it's impossible to go from prayer to go and argue with your boss but when you're in that anointing then you see things differently you reckon the battle not against flesh and blood it's not you and the deacon and the usher and the wife in the hospital but it's principalities and powers and it's a it's it's a spiritual warfare that you are in and you have a destination because all of this is temporary why fight and spend energy on the temporary stuff when there's an eternity to go to with a land that's made of gold with a fountain that he could drink any time it's a body that doesn't get sick that's what we ought to fight for that's what i want to fight for can the church say man could you take some more my my i haven't gotten anywhere with this thought this morning i have four sections and i'm on page six of the first section my my my my my my mind so malachi for came to restore the heart of the children back to the faith of the apostolic fathers and we are contending for one lord one feet one baptism to meet the challenge of the hour because every hour has its own challenge noah had his challenge in his day moses had the challenge in his day joseph had the challenge in his day our day not only has his power and his messenger and his message but there are challenges that we have in our day and you have to be able to meet the challenge not with your own strength but by the whole armor of god um taught us the whole armor of god is what he said is a baptism of the holy ghost that's the whole armor of god so we are here to apply because brethren taught us full obedience to the entire word of god entitles you to the token which is the baptism of the holy ghost which is the full armor of god which is the power of god i'm not talking about the birth now i'm not talking about the pentecostal experience but i'm talking about the fullness of god himself that when they see you they say that's christ that she's that the same god that pushed back to the devil when he was here can the church say amen so this message this morning is an encouragement to you that are in the battle but maybe you're tired maybe you're thinking about giving up maybe you get discouraged but you're in the battle you don't understand why this happened you don't understand why that happened you don't understand why this went wrong you don't understand why they are teased at their updates and they're down there and you've seen so much something you don't even know why you're in the fight but we are fighting anyhow we are fighting for our inheritance we are fighting for our promise we are fighting for our purpose we are fighting the bible said it is a time for war and a time for peace we are not talking about peace this morning we're talking about war because many of us we have been at peace with the devil for a long time we have allowed the devil to do what he wants to do in our houses in our lives and our marriages and in the church but in this day the seventh of this month the seventh of may we declare war against the enemy we are letting the devil know that we are taking back our prayer we are taking back our worship we are taking back a revival we are taking back our position we are claiming our inheritance we will have a church without spot without wrinkle we will have a manifestation of every promise lay down my malachi 4 can the church say amen amen just a few more minutes and i'll close out in the message putting on the whole armor of god with the balance and you know in this warfare between nations there's a great warfare going on and that's the warfare between god and satan and great warfare it was the first warfare and it's still raging but oh i'm so glad it'll soon come to an end then let's all be over satan has his agents out everywhere watching spying out on god's people god moves the enemy is sitting everywhere watching to see what he can do but go and god's got some out too so we find out that these secret agents of the enemy that sits around this is the prophet speaking each nation now he brings a parallel will equip its men with the latest equipment the very latest and they study and they do everything they're trying to counteract the other fellows weapons and get a little more modern weapon a little something with a little more punch to it and if you're watching the world news there's private wars rules of wars it's one minute it's not curious say if america does this they will do this and america sends a ship and many we have a small island far away it doesn't affect us but if you over there you see the big ship coming what do you think you're going to do and north korea say they have the thing is russia say they have the mother of all bombs who say well who's there the father of all bombs and it's a competition and stuff that humans can't even understand because one of these bombs will destroy millions of people that's what the problem is talking about here right they're trying to counteract the other fellows weapons they get a little more modern weapon a little something with a little more punch that's a lot more punch from the bow and arrow to a musketeer from a musketeer modern rifle and from that to an atomic they just keep building and it keeps them busy all the time busy all the time and it's the nation's business if they want to survive they want to equip their soldiers with the best equipment that there is but abraham said well god you know he's infinite see he don't have to think anything better he just got the best to begin with so man went from gun to bow and arrow sword gun cannon dignity he said but god give the best at the beginning he actually gave us nuclear weapons he just got the best to begin with so you can't improve on that nothing to be done about it he just gave us the best and that's his word that's right his word the best that can be given god gives his people the very best that's what he chose with his children the very best i'm so glad of that and we're glad of them now listen here when the brother said now god cannot make a decision today and tomorrow come back and make a better decision because his first decision is perfect he never has to change it so therefore we can rest upon whatever god says so if god's decision will deceive him is perfect to begin with it means that when god called you and equipped you with the best weapon he can't even change his mind about his weapon and he can't even change his mind about the soldier so when god chose you but a caleb he didn't make a mistake he didn't make a mistake with you young people when he called you all to the world and he put you in the house he put you in to give you the opportunity to hear this word he made the best decision he could have ever made and because of that you are going to make it you are going to overcome oh my my my so this is not the time church for us to die already you know i i believe in them but only go ahead leave me here that that that's some of us know i've been if you join me in a long time somebody older caleb listen there's no old lucky 11 no that gray hair is going to reverse i'm not buying that i'm not i'm not accepting it there's no giving up another law when he cares to give up time for the young people to take over you are young people too it's just the process needs to be refinished that seed in you makes you a young people so i'm speaking to the young people and the caleb's no giving up that pain has got to go the joy that that hip and the scope in his step has got to come back i'm speaking it i'm claiming it if this is about the antwerp this is imagine when his body changed at 21 year old you could imagine the kind of competition we would have you imagine when they got to the land and immediately the kind of competition they had dancing on the land rather that's how it's going to be we're gonna have a grand time we're gonna have a wonderful time it's gonna be a jubilee time is there anybody in the house this morning listen it have stress i'd have stress on that people and that's what i say god really knows how much you give everybody because i see people with stress and i think we're real stressed i feel real real stressed and when you watch stress and see what makes somebody say let's say oh gosh you're falling down and say the pipeline back in him and somebody hold front of the house for a long it's like that pipe we could patch that up do like all frustrated but the random picture message why are we so tossed about so easy to get frustrated you know i don't want to call me but some time ago i heard some noise and it was a lizard now the waiting noise came rotary i thought it was a serious criticism but it's stress and stress no if i listen cause that brother brother said what happened when would i come so the reality is the trials and the situation in your life and that's why god couldn't send goliath for david up front he had to go through the line and the beer so based on his experience now dealing with these two elements he now had a resume to present a king soul saying based on my job experience and my qualifications i am the only man who could apply for this job and he was in fact the only applicant so when saul received his resume he said listen this job has benefits you get my daughter you get you see and david there with the qualifications he now feel encouraged because there's no doubt in his mind he walked there with a sling and with a little stick container and say listen i will feed you i'll chop your head off his experience and confidence in the god that delivered him was bigger than what he had in his hands his confidence in god was bigger than what his eyes could see or even the eyes of the hr practitioners who were reviewing his performance can the church say man but when he chopped the head off after israel paused to see if god was really dead then they started shouting and they started rejoicing because they recognized that goliath was finished so your trials and your testings and your lizards and your lions and your bears are all to prepare you for your own experience with goliath because we all have our goliath to deal with but as the pastor always says for every goliath there is a stone with his name on it and our responsibility is to collect goliath's head with the stone that has his name on it that's what overcomers do overcomers find stones to match against goliaths so they could be a goliath in your life right now what we are trying to do this morning is to find all the stones for every goliath because every goliath will be destroyed because david's ministry is on the earth but abraham's message was to bring us back to david's ministry which is not the ministry of man but brother branham said that david is christ and christ being in his bride is david's ministry can the church stay man the musicians are getting ready i'm almost done the past is the impression so all these years we have been under military preparation what is military preparation it's a ministry of the word the ministry of the world you cannot send a man out into battle if he hasn't been trained and there's different kinds of training there's physical training there's mental training there's psychological training there's academic training when you go to these military schools they have you study what julius caesar did what napoleon did what alexander the great did what hitler did all the strategies because when you go into the battlefield you don't know what strategy you have to use and you can't have it in mind only it must be in demonstration you have to shoot if you know order terry and you can't shoot straight the enemy is there pow pow pow pow it's there's the enemy and you're telling them shoot over there and you should leave me here we want to be on the beam we want to be on the target we want you to identify the enemy wherever he is at and be able to place your target and your attack directly on him because once you direct the word which is your weapon to him he has to go the sword of the sword of the spirit which is the word of god can the church say amen my my my you could begin to play something software i'll have to finish this message some of the time but every service what are we doing getting ready for a holy war a spiritual battle a final showdown and we are waiting for dynamics to take us to the final battle god has been waiting for the right season the right time the right people and i say this morning sirs is this the time god had to pull you out from the world you had to be baptized filled with the holy ghost go to a place of trying reach adoption and in silence when your family couldn't understand you when nobody could understand you god has been preparing you so i say again this morning this is not the time for you to die this is not the time for us to run and hide and defend this morning we declare that the time has come to stand and haven't done all to keep on standing don't give up after you have tried talking to your children don't give up stand after you have applied for job after job don't give up stand after your pray for the holy ghost don't give up stand having that all stand after you upside and you cried stand after you have tried him and tried him and you pressed your way and it seems as if nothing is working out still stand having it all to stand stand let everything go wrong but the baron said let everybody else prosper let the others prosper let the men who have a form of godliness deny the power [Music] but if you know where you'll stand you'll stand regardless if the whole world tears you down you'll stand just the same you won't vary from that word because the battle is the lord's battle just keep on standing who was on the lord's side this morning can you lift your hands this morning and give god praise we have a commission from god to make a church that will make a revival another ephesians another book of action to kill kill every villain's time every amalekite you may be seeing it for a minute so i'm going a little bit to be on to drive them out to say listen kill them all so there's drive out because it's your land but our ministry is not just to drive them out it's to kill them all because in every age throughout history and the bible supports it this tribe didn't kill them all this tribe didn't kill them caleb expelled the sons of enoch but it is these spirits throughout all the ages that are still in the church today and that's why brother branham's talking about if we could deserve to withstand the two spirits working within the framework of the church but this is the only age where the egyptians you see today you will see them no more forever this is the only age where satan at the end will be bombed by circumstance bound for a thousand years for years they couldn't find him they would hold him for a season and he would come back out but after this age its thousand years bone eternal finish and we shall remain on the earth the devil has been squatting on this earth for a long time but the brethren taught us that he is a prince of the power of the air that the air is infected the land is infected and that's why it's been a battle since adam fell until now that's why god says a new heaven and a new earth god will send fire to consume this place but this bride will be that elect lady that god will raise up into that holy city new jerusalem that will make the rapture that when that fire consumes the urchin she will walk up on the ashes and she will say this is our earth this is our land and the bible says we shall reign on the earth we're not going to reign in heaven this is our land the devil has taken our land no wonder the trees are groaning no wonder the seas are groaning for the manifestation of the sons of god and listen the trees know we are coming back the earth knows that we are coming back up the earthquakes are happening because we are coming back sons of god daughters of god are coming back into position can the church say amen somebody give god a shout somebody give god a shout out praise somebody give god worship in the house of god so this morning i'm closing out i'm ready to fight for the fate that was delivered to the saints that was restored by malachi 4 this morning i'm ready to fight for our seventh this morning i'm ready to fight not for a church but for a super church this morning i'm ready to fight for a church on fire for god i'm ready to fight for the backsliders for the sake to the defeated for those in bondage for those very making it for every family for every household satan let my people go we are leaving this place we declare war we are bringing every attack up we raise our flag this morning the flag of the king of kings the flag of the lord of lords he is mighty in battle he has never lost a war yet may the lord richly bless you that jesus set me free set me free that jesus set me free tell somebody we'll tell jesus set me free satan jesus set me free jesus set me free jesus set me free [Music] blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah his wonderful name you love the lord this morning as we get ready to pick up this morning's titan offering let's sing that song i'm gonna stay on the battlefield i'm gonna stay on the battlefield [Music] till is heavenly father this morning we bring before you the titan offering not about to be picked up lord lord we thank you for such a powerful
