[5:01] for communion
[5:03] because it the rains were so heavy last
[5:05] Sunday we couldn't have communion so
[5:08] we'll be coming back at five amen so let
[5:11] us go straight to the word
[5:13] Luke chapters chapter 5 18 in Acts
[5:17] chapter 2
[5:18] so let's take Acts chapter 2 verse 37 to
[5:23] 41.
[5:25] this was when the Holy Ghost had fallen
[5:27] and the the manifestation of the spirit
[5:30] was with the apostles the people
[5:32] gathered around what mean is this these
[5:34] are drunk amen then Peter Peter then
[5:37] explained to them what that was all
[5:40] about verse 37 said now when they heard
[5:43] this when they had older Peter had to
[5:45] say when they heard this they were
[5:47] pricked in their hearts
[5:49] and said unto Peter and to the rest of
[5:52] the Apostles men and Brethren what shall
[5:54] we do
[5:55] then Peter said unto them repent and be
[5:58] baptized every one of you in the name of
[6:00] Jesus Christ for the remission of sins
[6:03] and ye shall receive the gift of the
[6:05] Holy Ghost for the promise is unto you
[6:07] and to your children and to all that are
[6:09] far off even as many as the Lord Our God
[6:11] shall call
[6:12] and with many other words did he testify
[6:16] save yourself from this untoward
[6:19] generation then they gladly received his
[6:23] word and were baptized and the same day
[6:26] were added unto them about 3 000 Souls
[6:30] that's what the power of the Holy Ghost
[6:32] does
[6:33] to the church
[6:35] amen and then the Book of Luke chapter
[6:38] 15 verse 7 to 10.
[6:42] 7 and I say unto you that likewise Joy
[6:46] shall be in heaven over one sin that
[6:50] repented
[6:53] amen
[6:54] more than over 99 just persons which
[6:59] need no repentance
[7:01] I don't want women having 10 pieces of
[7:04] silver
[7:05] if he is one
[7:07] thus not light a candle
[7:11] shoot the house and seek the little
[7:14] she'll find it
[7:15] and where she has found it she called
[7:18] her friends and her neighbors together
[7:20] saying Rejoice with me for I have found
[7:24] the peace which I had lost
[7:26] likewise I say unto you there is joy in
[7:30] the presence of the angels of God over
[7:33] one sinner that repented
[7:36] may the Lord add a blessing to the
[7:38] novice word
[7:40] amen
[7:41] [Music]
[7:43] you may be seated
[7:45] praise the Lord
[7:50] amen
[7:51] so what can we say about Wednesday and
[7:53] Friday services
[7:56] amen
[7:58] praise God
[8:00] oh man listening back to the tapes I
[8:04] don't even believe I free those messages
[8:06] but God is good
[8:08] amen we're going to cut that headstone
[8:12] don't make no mistake about there's a
[8:14] bride on the head there's a people in
[8:17] the land that God has ordained to The
[8:19] Headstone and nothing will stop it
[8:22] praise God and thank God I am in that
[8:26] number I am part of that headstone I'm
[8:29] part of that bright age I shall beware
[8:32] praise glory amen no matter what flood
[8:36] the enemy is raising the spirit of God
[8:38] will raise the standard against the
[8:40] enemy today so for a title I pray we
[8:44] don't keep long I'm sure by maybe 12
[8:46] o'clock
[8:47] amen so my title is we must find the
[8:52] lost coin
[8:53] that's all that mattered
[8:55] praise God
[8:58] check this your sound is breaking up
[8:59] amen we must find the lost
[9:03] amen
[9:04] so let us see I want to read from
[9:08] Proverbs chapter 8 verse 13.
[9:11] as a background we read them in Sunday
[9:14] school but for the rest of those that
[9:16] were not here I just want to bring a
[9:18] little background to that amen Proverbs
[9:20] 8 13 to 40 said the fear of the Lord is
[9:23] to meet evil
[9:25] we want we won the Lost coin right
[9:28] amen but we just can't have the Lost
[9:30] coin in our own way we must have the law
[9:33] scoring in his way
[9:36] praise God the Lost coin might be in his
[9:39] way not in our way
[9:43] you believe that
[9:44] Hallelujah we must have that lost coin
[9:47] in God's way not in our way praise God
[9:52] so he says that the fear of the Lord is
[9:54] to make evil
[9:56] right
[9:57] we must get evil and we must hate what
[9:59] Pride praise God proud in heart God
[10:03] hates it God wants a humble heart that
[10:06] is the heart that God can work through
[10:08] God cannot wait to a proud Heart A Heart
[10:11] That resents the word God cannot work
[10:13] through that when they heard what Peter
[10:16] has said the Bible said they were
[10:17] pricked in their heart they said men
[10:20] embedding what shall we do they didn't
[10:23] stay in their own idea they were put in
[10:26] their heart and said what shall we do we
[10:29] must come to that today we must humble
[10:31] ourselves to the word we must come
[10:34] prostrate at his feet with the fear of
[10:37] God in our heart what is the fear of God
[10:39] is to wait evil
[10:42] it
[10:45] the fear of the Lord is to hit evil
[10:48] pride and arrogancy and the evil way and
[10:53] the forward forward mouth do I hate you
[10:56] say counsel is mine and sound wisdom I
[11:00] am understanding I have strength so God
[11:03] is understanding God is wisdom God is
[11:07] understanding and God has strength
[11:09] because there is waiting the power to
[11:12] give you strength that you can stay
[11:14] alive in the world that you can live for
[11:17] what you have lost praise God because
[11:19] until we find the lost coin we cannot
[11:22] call unto the neighbors to come and
[11:24] rejoice with us but we must find the
[11:26] lost coin you with me tonight praise God
[11:30] you may be receive it and Proverbs 11

[13:11] word wise in the spirit oh blessed be
[13:14] the name of the Living God
[13:16] oh glory be to the Lord amen you may be
[13:21] seated
[13:21] amen but Abraham said In the Beginning
[13:24] Church age he said one night I was
[13:27] seeking the Lord
[13:29] I wanted to listen very carefully but
[13:32] rather one night I was seeking the Lord
[13:34] the Holy Spirit told me to pick up my
[13:37] pen and write
[13:39] amen as I grab the pen to write his
[13:42] Spirit gave me a message for the church
[13:45] do you want to hear that message
[13:47] do you want to hear what the spirit told
[13:49] him to write to the church okay brother
[13:52] said I want to bring you to you it has
[13:54] to do with the word and the bride
[13:57] another word in the church not aware in
[14:00] the system it has to do with the word
[14:03] and what the bride so our message is to
[14:06] the word of the word and to the bride
[14:09] here it is in quotes here it is what I
[14:12] am trying to say to you this is God
[14:14] talking to the prophet oh aren't you
[14:16] privilege to hear what God Said direct
[14:19] to God's prophet and it was meant for
[14:22] you
[14:23] you never see that here is what I am
[14:26] trying to say to you the law of
[14:29] reproduction is that a specie must bring
[14:32] forth after his own kind
[14:35] every specie must bring forth after his
[14:37] own kind
[14:38] [Applause]
[14:40] so God brings after his kind
[14:42] Satan brings after his kind the things
[14:45] of the world bring after their kind
[14:48] are you following me now so and we must
[14:50] preach it don't tell me I can't preach
[14:53] it I will preach it I would say the
[14:55] things of God and I will show you the
[14:57] things of the devil because everything
[14:59] brings one after his kind but remember
[15:02] praise God the fruit of the righteous is
[15:05] the Tree of Life
[15:07] so we must bring it now for you to bring
[15:10] up the fruits the fruit of the
[15:12] unrighteous is the way of death
[15:15] you get it now oh glory to be to the
[15:18] Living God Hallelujah the law of
[15:21] reproduction is that each species brings
[15:24] forth after its own can be seated and
[15:27] according to Genesis 1 11 and God said
[15:30] let the Earth bring forth grass this is
[15:33] what God is telling the prophet to write
[15:35] Oh Glory to God and the help she you see
[15:39] even God had to bring back the word to
[15:42] the prophet because whatever he said
[15:44] must be in the world
[15:47] so God is quoting back himself he said
[15:50] and God said let the Earth bring forth
[15:52] grass and help yielding seed and the
[15:55] fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind
[15:57] whose seed is in itself upon the Earth
[16:00] and it was soon whatever life was in the
[16:04] sea came forth into a plant and then
[16:07] into a fruit
[16:11] so whatever you see brings forth a tree
[16:14] then the three now brings for the word
[16:16] fruits so we must produce that thing the
[16:20] structure of a perfect man that is God's
[16:23] tree of life it must bring forth fruits
[16:29] praise him he's not just coming to
[16:32] church this church is not a tree but
[16:34] that is the tree of life that is the
[16:36] tree of God the touch of a perfect man
[16:39] you must be a tree before you can bring
[16:41] forth fruits
[16:42] [Applause]
[16:44] glory to God oh glory be to the Living
[16:47] God and the believer shall be like a
[16:49] tree planted by the rivers of waters for
[16:52] whose leaves are not wider praise God
[16:55] and whatsoever you do it shall prosper
[16:57] you've got to be a tree to bring forth
[17:00] fruits
[17:02] glory to God oh you never see that
[17:06] praise God and the brothers at the very
[17:09] God told the prophet the very same law
[17:11] applies to the church today whatever
[17:13] seeds started the church WIll comfort
[17:16] and be like the Original Seed because it
[17:19] is the same seed in these last days are

[18:07] will be the Super Church oh come on now
[18:09] you will be the Super Church in super
[18:12] ways as she nears him because what you
[18:15] have the world cannot stop it there's
[18:17] going to be power from Heaven not power
[18:19] from the church the power from the body
[18:22] not power from a group but it's going to

[18:41] word that promise is not to be is to my
[18:44] children and my children's children

[19:16] be so much like him that they will even
[19:18] be in his very image it is very image
[19:23] praise God that is why it comes back to
[19:27] charity it comes back to the love of God

[19:33] though I speak with tons of men of an
[19:35] angels without that image of God capping
[19:38] me up filling me up brother I am nothing
[19:41] though I have no need to understand

[19:50] pumping that praise God those vertices
[19:52] in me I am nothing because knowledge
[19:55] shall vanish away but what are they the
[19:57] prophecies they shall fail but whether
[20:00] it's charity charity shall never never
[20:03] fail though you believe that today oh

[20:09] do so much like him that they will even
[20:11] be in his very image praise God you may
[20:14] be seated

[21:35] living
[21:37] fear of life oh glory god they will be
[21:41] the very manifestation of the Living
[21:42] Word of God
[21:43] denominations cannot produce this that's
[21:47] the wrong seed they can't produce his
[21:49] life they can't prove that's why they
[21:51] don't even know what this is but it's in
[21:53] the world but it takes a prophet to
[21:56] bring forth the word to the bread that
[21:58] can receive the word oh and plead the
[22:00] promise plead the promise make that your
[22:03] confession make that your confession
[22:05] today I shall have faith I shall have
[22:08] the faith you sealed in me and your body
[22:10] will obey your confession not by might
[22:12] not by power but God promises it to the
[22:15] bride and God cannot fall on his promise
[22:17] every promise there is yours today oh
[22:21] play The Promise today oh denominations
[22:24] cannot produce this they will produce
[22:27] their own Creed and Dogma mixed with the
[22:30] word the mongolization the mongolizing
[22:33] brings forth a hybrid product Hallelujah
[22:37] but thank God we are in the original sin
[22:41] we can be hybrid that is where we are
[22:44] staying in the world because in the
[22:46] beginning was the word the word was with
[22:49] God the Word was God the word was made
[22:51] flesh praise God and today we are made
[22:54] flesh the word in you is made flesh the
[22:57] world made first today is the Bride of
[22:59] Jesus Christ praise God this word must
[23:02] be living out in you thousands of live
[23:06] voices the Thunder that shakes the devil
[23:09] you may be seated
[23:11] Oh Glory to God Amen I'm continuing with
[23:15] what he was writing to the prophet for
[23:17] the other Prophet to write he said the
[23:19] first son Adam was the spoken word seed
[23:21] of God he was given a break to reproduce
[23:24] himself that is why the bread was given
[23:26] to him the bride was not given to Adam
[23:29] For Pleasure he was given for Adam to
[23:32] reproduce after himself because every
[23:36] seed must breathe out after his kind
[23:39] let this be sink down into your soul
[23:41] today that's why your life is not your
[23:44] own you must produce a Life of Christ
[23:47] praise God and whatever way you want to
[23:51] come you better come by the word young
[23:53] people you better come by the word
[23:55] marriage is an institution of God you
[23:59] don't come in otherwise than God's way
[24:01] because any other way is not God's way
[24:04] because it must produce after its kind
[24:08] I hear me now so the word is not for
[24:11] jokes now the word is the word
[24:15] praise be the name of the Lord amen the
[24:18] bride was given to him to reproduce
[24:20] himself that is why the Bible was given
[24:22] to him to reproduce himself to produce
[24:25] another Son of God
[24:28] that is why he was given to Adam to
[24:31] produce another son like Adam so set was

[52:21] leader Caleb represents those that
[52:23] stayed with the two Joshua oh am I
[52:26] hearing you
[52:27] Caleb represents those that stood
[52:30] through Joshua remember God has started
[52:33] Israel as a virgin with his word but
[52:36] they wanted something different so did
[52:37] the Church of the last day notice how
[52:40] God did not move Israel or let her go
[52:42] into the promised land until it was in
[52:44] his own appointed time
[52:46] none the people might have put pressure
[52:48] on Joshua the leader and said the land
[52:51] is ours let us go and take it Joshua you
[52:55] are all true he said you are all true
[52:58] you must have lost your commission

[53:03] all true you are finished or you have
[53:05] lots of commission you have lost your
[53:06] anointed

[53:15] have lost your commission you don't have
[53:16] the power you used to have you need to

[54:29] God placed the full leadership in
[54:32] Joshua's hand because he has stayed with
[54:35] the word God could trust Joshua but not

[1:13:52] there
[1:13:53] has those days passed are they gone the
[1:13:57] god ran out of inauguration for the
[1:13:59] church
[1:14:01] God hasn't run out
[1:14:03] we don't want it
[1:14:07] the education is there
[1:14:10] people don't want it
[1:14:12] and they didn't catch you
[1:14:15] then now people wake up this thing is
[1:14:18] true
[1:14:18] Antichrist they say it's Antichrist
[1:14:21] injection
[1:14:26] new people start dying they receive the
[1:14:29] Antichrist by force because they don't
[1:14:31] want to die
[1:14:33] praise God did God run out of
[1:14:36] inoculation for his church did he do it
[1:14:40] if he did it woe unto the church
[1:14:43] but on the day of Pentecost while they
[1:14:46] were shouting while they were quiet
[1:14:49] while they were shouting
[1:14:51] warned to the passage that come again
[1:14:53] shouting while they were shouting
[1:14:56] praising God the question came up men
[1:14:59] and breading what shall we do to become
[1:15:02] inoculated the question came
[1:15:06] the question must come from you today
[1:15:09] men embroidery what shall we do
[1:15:15] to become inoculated
[1:15:19] oh church and Dr Simon Peter
[1:15:25] wrote out the prescription and said this
[1:15:29] scription is going to be good for you
[1:15:31] amen and for your children and for every
[1:15:35] generation and as many as the Lord Our
[1:15:37] God shall call you can use this
[1:15:40] prescription repent every
[1:15:44] everything in the name the name of the
[1:15:46] Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of
[1:15:48] your sins and you shall be inoculated
[1:15:51] you shall receive the gift of the Holy
[1:15:54] Spirit which is God's inoculation for
[1:15:57] the promises unto you and to your
[1:15:59] children and to them that are far off
[1:16:01] even as the Lord Our God shall call
[1:16:06] today
[1:16:07] we must get that inoculation
[1:16:11] why is the virgins not there because we
[1:16:14] have lost the Lost coin
[1:16:16] we must find it
[1:16:18] in order for God to come in him
[1:16:22] we must find a
[1:16:24] the Lost coin
[1:16:27] and as we close up
[1:16:30] praise God
[1:16:32] Oh Glory to God we must find that lost
[1:16:36] coin sure
[1:16:39] what is the Lost coin
[1:16:41] the Lost coin was a covenant
[1:16:46] you see that
[1:16:49] between
[1:16:50] the husband and the wife
[1:16:55] they have to be 10 tablets
[1:16:57] she wore it on her head to signify
[1:17:01] ah like the Muslim way the mayafi on the
[1:17:03] head
[1:17:04] let a Muslim woman forget this Veil
[1:17:08] she would run like she's going to die
[1:17:10] the next second
[1:17:13] or let that will be falling
[1:17:15] because you believe that's the husband
[1:17:17] she's wearing covering over her head
[1:17:20] so this woman was required by law to
[1:17:23] wear that
[1:17:24] 10 tablets not nine
[1:17:27] and if the husband came and found one
[1:17:29] lost
[1:17:31] by law
[1:17:33] pack out of my house
[1:17:37] because she would have committed
[1:17:38] adultery
[1:17:41] are you following
[1:17:44] it didn't matter the excuse it didn't
[1:17:46] matter the circumstances that made that
[1:17:48] coin to be lost
[1:17:51] you will be seen as having committed
[1:17:54] what adultery
[1:17:57] and therefore you don't deserve to live
[1:18:00] in a man's place
[1:18:02] so here was the woman the husband had
[1:18:04] traveled
[1:18:07] get it to evening time she found out
[1:18:09] that one of the coins was not there
[1:18:11] she was honest she was chased she was
[1:18:15] pure she was diligent she was sincere
[1:18:18] she was committed to her husband she
[1:18:22] hadn't gone out of the house
[1:18:24] but the coin was lost
[1:18:29] the husband will not take an excuse for
[1:18:32] why the coin was lost
[1:18:35] are you getting me now
[1:18:39] and so once you realize that the coin
[1:18:42] was lost she needed to find that coin
[1:18:47] where I can't find it today if it is
[1:18:49] today owns
[1:18:51] Brian throw the rest I can't find it
[1:18:55] when the husband look by you you let me
[1:18:58] do you know what I was doing today to be
[1:19:00] argument
[1:19:02] you will have your way
[1:19:05] but she needed to find that coin
[1:19:08] because the Covenant the law was that
[1:19:11] without one of those coins you got to go
[1:19:17] amen
[1:19:22] and so she had to go searching
[1:19:25] the second coming of Christ said it was
[1:19:27] getting to evening time he said she
[1:19:29] lighted the candle
[1:19:33] desperation setting
[1:19:35] she pulled down the cobwebs
[1:19:38] it was house cleaning time
[1:19:42] [Applause]
[1:19:45] she had to clean the house in other
[1:19:47] words to find the coin
[1:19:51] because the husband was coming
[1:19:53] well Christ is coming
[1:19:56] the Raptor is coming the bridegroom is
[1:19:58] coming he must find Seven Virtues
[1:20:02] reflecting out
[1:20:06] he's coming the head is coming and when
[1:20:09] it comes fed all the way to broadly
[1:20:12] kindness charity must be there
[1:20:17] if it is not there it's evening time
[1:20:20] it's time to light up the candle it's
[1:20:24] time to have a house cleaning time it's
[1:20:27] time to look for that lost coin because
[1:20:29] when it comes with one coin missing will
[1:20:33] be counted as adulterers we can't go in
[1:20:37] with him
[1:20:38] we can't be in that Kingdom
[1:20:44] we must find a lost coin
[1:20:48] praise God
[1:20:51] amen
[1:20:53] and so when the husband came
[1:20:58] but tell your husband came around said
[1:21:00] the neighbors could see the dust flying
[1:21:06] this woman is a dirty woman who look at
[1:21:09] her cleaning power but they didn't know
[1:21:11] what was going inside
[1:21:13] they were outside that was flying
[1:21:15] through the window through everywhere
[1:21:16] they were complaining and condemning but
[1:21:19] they did not know why the reason why the
[1:21:21] dust was flying out
[1:21:24] so what do you care about somebody
[1:21:25] criticizing you wanting to dress right
[1:21:28] wanting to live right wanting to reject
[1:21:30] the well reject the case of the world
[1:21:32] what do you care you know why you are
[1:21:35] doing that you know that you are having
[1:21:36] a house cleaning don't care what the
[1:21:39] neighbor says because when he comes it
[1:21:42] is you and him not you not here and the
[1:21:45] neighbor not here one criticize it is
[1:21:47] you and Christ the word what do I care
[1:21:50] about what somebody will say what some
[1:21:52] church will say once a minister will say
[1:21:54] once some people will say it is me and
[1:21:57] Christ I am having a house cleaning let
[1:22:00] the dust fly out let the Cowboys praise
[1:22:04] God let the rubbish be packed out in his
[1:22:07] eye a Christ Alone
[1:22:09] [Music]
[1:22:11] I better look for that lost coin I have
[1:22:14] lost a coin I must find that coin
[1:22:17] because when he comes when The Headstone
[1:22:19] comes he must find out all these virtues
[1:22:22] are there then we can cement them with
[1:22:26] Charity I must find the lost corn
[1:22:29] [Music]
[1:22:31] you may be seated
[1:22:34] [Applause]
[1:22:35] praise God
[1:22:37] amen
[1:22:40] Hallelujah
[1:22:42] praise God
[1:22:44] oh bird Abraham let me read and get out
[1:22:47] of here
[1:22:48] praise God
