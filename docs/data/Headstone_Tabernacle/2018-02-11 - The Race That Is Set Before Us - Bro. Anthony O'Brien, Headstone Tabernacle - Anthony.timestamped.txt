[52:37] sealed with seven seals but in the days
[52:40] of these seems to be open the mystery of
[52:42] God will be finished in other words God
[52:44] yeah we would be known to his church his
[52:47] church not in three people but as one
[52:49] person the mystery of God would be
[52:52] reveal and when that was completely
[52:55] revealed then the seven mysteries would
[52:58] be open to the church which he's talked
[53:00] about the seven thunders because in the
[53:02] air the church here we go would be
[53:05] living under the inspiration of the Holy
[53:08] Spirit him moving in and out and showing
[53:12] his signs of being alive and among us
[53:14] living among us there
[53:16] we are worship in the living Christ
[53:18] that's among us
[53:20] so this worship atmosphere is a prophecy
[53:22] that is to come then you will be
[53:25] worshiping the Living Christ you're not
[53:27] worshiping because this song leaders
[53:28] here raise your hands and give Him
[53:30] praise and yet know you're know giving
[53:31] praise I give Him glory that coming from
[53:33] Sonia in Erbil where all this worship
[53:36] them come from but a Branham
[53:38] here you go again he said no watch the
[53:41] revelation at the fifth chapter 8 the 14
[53:44] verse reveals the time for the lamb to
[53:46] be worshipped but in heaven and in earth
[53:49] the seven see book the wooden lamb the
[53:51] kinsman redeemer no dins it verse to the
[53:54] 14th verse angels worship Him
[53:56] elders worship him living creatures
[53:58] worship Him John worship him so much
[54:01] till he said every creature in heaven
[54:02] and in earth underneath heard me saying
[54:05] blessing and glory and power and wisdom
[54:08] and might be to the lamb he said a
[54:10] worship time of the king lamb so that's
[54:13] another prophecy there's coming a
[54:15] worship time for the king lamb and we
[54:17] not wait until them restarting all now
[54:19] because that's what making your God
[54:21] there's gonna be a time of worship not
[54:24] just intellectually hearing a message
[54:26] but getting in the spirit you could
[54:28] always hear about the tape and did your
[54:29] notes but when you come here you're from
[54:31] in the worship the committed expression
[54:33] lost to God you come into creates an
[54:34] atmosphere that is what you come here
[54:37] for
[54:37] oh praise God gave my shell people one
[54:40] time brother man and when Xin xao meet
[54:42] him he didn't have to preach he just
[54:44] walked into the meeting under crippled
[54:46] standard come on the wheelchair the
[54:47] scrip has had to walk the blinds had a
[54:49] seat he said the angel of the Lord was
[54:51] present he said it was the atmosphere he
[54:54] didn't have to say a word he walked into
[54:55] the meeting and just began to be heal
[54:58] the pain begin to see the Clipper began
[55:01] to walk why because at Mercer was there
[55:03] so when you come to church you come to
[55:06] create an atmosphere he has come to sit
[55:08] down and your intellect wondering what
[55:10] the preacher gonna say and who want to
[55:12] speak forget that talking to speak
[55:15] bother to move upon whoever comes behind
[55:17] you because we have an atmosphere you
[55:20] supposed to know that by now or get a
[55:22] lot of shy
[55:23] in the house behind us puppet of an
[55:25] atmosphere anybody come behind here

[56:02] the purpose of that message was to show
[56:04] you that when anybody gets in the
[56:07] presence of God truly they only could
[56:10] see themself as nothing as nobody nobody
[56:14] could come in the presence of God and

[1:02:52] title my title is the race that is set
[1:02:55] before us the race that is set before us
[1:03:01] and we took that straight out of Hebrews
[1:03:03] 12:1 we just read a few moments ago and
[1:03:09] in this scripture Paul speaks about a
[1:03:12] race that is set before us and in other
[1:03:18] words it's a it's a it's a future tense
[1:03:20] it's a future race he's speaking at it
[1:03:23] of it as it's a race that is yet to be
[1:03:25] run a race that is yet to be in Devon
[1:03:29] isn't all right it's all right it's a
[1:03:32] race towards a goal it's a race towards
[1:03:36] a purpose it's a race to what something
[1:03:38] that is set before you isn't that right
[1:03:41] you see something in front of you and it
[1:03:44] is what wakes you up in the morning it
[1:03:46] is what inspires you and we all have a
[1:03:50] race to run this morning we all have
[1:03:53] something to achieve that's why we're
[1:03:55] here this morning there's a purpose
[1:03:57] while we're here this morning there's
[1:03:59] something we're trying to get to a man
[1:04:03] is not a natural race as
[1:04:05] natural men run racists but it is a race
[1:04:07] that spiritually speaking that we have
[1:04:10] to run and endure and go beyond
[1:04:12] ourselves go beyond our human limits go
[1:04:16] beyond our thoughts go beyond our
[1:04:18] feelings and see a vision that is
[1:04:21] greater than you and I a vision that is
[1:04:24] Jesus Christ the same yesterday the same
[1:04:27] today the same forever
[1:04:30] isn't that right so we're just gonna
[1:04:32] talk about this contact scripture before
[1:04:34] we get into it so he says wherefore
[1:04:37] seeing we also are compassed about with
[1:04:41] so great a cloud of witnesses and just
[1:04:46] in that previous scripture there Hebrews
[1:04:47] 11 he was talking about heroes of fate
[1:04:51] that's that cloud of witnesses and all
[1:04:55] those heroes of faith who fought beyond
[1:04:58] measure who fought beyond themselves the
[1:05:02] Bible talks about how Abram offered a
[1:05:04] more excellent sacrifice than Cain his
[1:05:07] fate showed him a vision that was
[1:05:10] greater than what King saw and grow
[1:05:13] except an evil sacrifice Oh Holly and
[1:05:16] we're here to offer a sacrifice of
[1:05:18] praise this morning and a sacrifice of
[1:05:21] worship unto the Lord we know who we
[1:05:26] worship we know what we worship or we
[1:05:30] believe in this morning supid isakova
[1:05:34] name and I believe last week and that
[1:05:36] message talking about worship is now
[1:05:41] hallelujah amen so we know who we
[1:05:45] worship this morning we had a worship
[1:05:47] gone this spirit and in truth isn't that
[1:05:51] right
[1:05:52] Holly and all this great cloud of
[1:05:54] witnesses and the Bible went on
[1:05:56] expressly talking about Abraham how he
[1:05:59] staggered not to unbelief holid but was
[1:06:02] strong in fate giving praise to God
[1:06:05] despite the unbelief despite the
[1:06:08] situation this Mike what he saw he press
[1:06:11] toward the mark
[1:06:13] was prescient - what a cool he had his
[1:06:16] race to run it might have took 25 years
[1:06:18] but I made it over Oh hallelujah
[1:06:22] hallelujah is now right
[1:06:25] he's now right and Joshua and Caleb and
[1:06:29] Kitty on on all these heroes of fate
[1:06:32] this great cloud of witnesses that the
[1:06:35] Bible talks about it's turning over the
[1:06:38] balance of time they are cheering on the
[1:06:41] bride this evening because the Bible
[1:06:43] says here without us
[1:06:44] are not made perfect so even though they
[1:06:48] wander and test chesta to turn afflicted
[1:06:50] and they were tormented and they wonder
[1:06:53] is sheepskins and goatskins and oh they
[1:06:56] were sawn asunder
[1:06:57] there was slim with the edge of the
[1:06:59] sword this gospel this morning it's
[1:07:02] dripping with blood
[1:07:03] those same cloud of witnesses some of
[1:07:07] them will be headed some of them are
[1:07:09] their heads cut off but they were
[1:07:11] fighting for something they believed in
[1:07:13] something
[1:07:14] officinalis greater than human creature
[1:07:18] in me it was greater than their own
[1:07:20] lives they keep the old bodies to be
[1:07:22] punched oh holiday counted as nothing
[1:07:25] ojala but to seek the riches of Christ
[1:07:28] oh that's how I feel this morning I feel
[1:07:32] fully persuaded that no life no
[1:07:36] principality no power or I could ever
[1:07:39] come between me and the love of Almighty
[1:07:42] God God loves you this morning he put
[1:07:45] you in a price for he died for you on
[1:07:48] Calvary's tree I got a right to shout i
[1:07:51] got a right to praise car Oh

[1:09:32] with like actions men who have faults
[1:09:35] men who are failures many watch
[1:09:38] shortcomings everybody wasn't perfect

[1:09:44] they all came praise God just as God's
[1:09:48] ethic that come God put something inside
[1:09:51] of them to press beyond themselves
[1:09:53] hallelujah they're human beings they
[1:09:56] weren't some kind of a immortal angel or
[1:09:59] something they were honey in flesh and
[1:10:01] blood like you and I had struggles like
[1:10:03] you and I had back pain and misery and
[1:10:07] oh hi like the happiness sometimes but

[1:11:49] heart I don't care what your flesh tell

[1:12:10] [Music]
[1:12:16] let's hide every weight don't let

[1:12:23] that so easily beset you
[1:12:26] somebody must you're caught you get
[1:12:28] upset late out of sign holiday
[1:12:32] everything that was so easily moving out
[1:12:34] of your mind
[1:12:35] I let get it very clear this morning a
[1:12:38] picture of what God is trying to present
[1:12:40] to you hallelujah because if you can get
[1:12:43] into that kind of a condition then
[1:12:45] you're ready to run then you're ready to
[1:12:48] run this race that is set before us are
[1:12:51] we going to talk about any man he said
[1:12:54] and let's lay aside every weight that so
[1:12:56] easily be sentence let's run with
[1:12:59] patience the race I love that he prefers
[1:13:03] the race with patients because they that
[1:13:06] wait upon the Lord shall renew their
[1:13:08] strength they shall run and not be weary
[1:13:11] they shall walk and not faint
[1:13:14] but didn't wait upon the Lord or there's
[1:13:17] power in waiting there's power in
[1:13:19] resting on his promises this morning Oh
[1:13:23] make us await on you Lord Jesus
[1:13:26] oh don't you want to be that kind of
[1:13:28] Christian looking unto Jesus the author
[1:13:38] and finisher of our faith who for the
[1:13:42] joy was set before him endured the cross
[1:13:47] the cross set before him a vision
[1:13:51] hallelujah this was his path to fulfill
[1:13:53] to be sacrificed to die to give his life
[1:13:57] his knowledge to see the whole world war
[1:14:00] haunted to see her fallen creation that
[1:14:03] was his commission and Jesus flawlessly
[1:14:05] defeated the devil it is written it is
[1:14:09] written it is also written
[1:14:11] he chopped the devil ribbons he ran his
[1:14:14] race he overcome every tactic every test
[1:14:18] every trial is now hallelujah oh my and
[1:14:27] it sat down at the right hand of the
[1:14:32] throne of God he overcame his race I
[1:14:36] know we've got a race to run
[1:14:38] isn't that right a man and I have a few
[1:14:42] context scriptures but email I get
[1:14:44] teaching time here but I want to just
[1:14:47] talk about a race he's saying a natural
[1:14:50] race is a competition it's a contest
[1:14:54] normally it's a contest of speed who's
[1:14:57] the fastest who can get there first
[1:15:00] who's the fastest person who's the
[1:15:02] fastest cyclist who's the fastest
[1:15:05] motorist or you know car driving or
[1:15:08] whatever type of contest it is most of
[1:15:10] the times is about who can get there
[1:15:12] first but I love what the Bible said in
[1:15:15] eClass Ecclesiastes chapter 9 verse 11
[1:15:19] here it says I returned and saw Under
[1:15:21] the Sun that the race is not to the
[1:15:24] Swift nor the battle to the strong
[1:15:27] neither yet bread to the wise nor yet
[1:15:31] riches to men of understanding so what
[1:15:33] is the Bible trying to say here it's not
[1:15:35] about who get there first or who faster
[1:15:39] on who or who more powerful and who the
[1:15:42] prize in two people to cross the finish
[1:15:44] line the prize is to be able to make it
[1:15:47] over to meet God's requirements to do
[1:15:50] what God said
[1:15:52] it's a spiritual race
[1:15:55] and I love that because it changes the
[1:15:58] tone of the race it's not about trying
[1:16:01] to cut down this brother to reach first
[1:16:03] it's not trying to about cutting down
[1:16:05] this sister to get there first but we
[1:16:09] all better come to the unity of the
[1:16:11] faith we all gotta come to the knowledge
[1:16:15] of the Son of God we all gotta forgive
[1:16:18] we all gotta pray for one another
[1:16:20] because if somebody's stumbling we can
[1:16:24] reach down and help that brother I say
[1:16:26] come on brother even if we go to limp

[1:20:15] [Applause]
[1:20:20] you're gonna write your name in those
[1:20:22] stars my god alright
[1:20:26] anyhow so that's what a race is now
[1:20:31] there's what I broke down to be three
[1:20:35] different phases of the race and the
[1:20:37] first two parts of this race is really
[1:20:40] the preparation phase right so the first
[1:20:45] part of a race is really preparation
[1:20:47] because nobody wakes up in the morning
[1:20:49] and wins the race yeah there's something
[1:20:54] missing in that equation zero doesn't
[1:20:58] equal a hundred remember it's even got
[1:21:04] to do your mats over so you've got to be
[1:21:08] prepared in order to run a race all
[1:21:13] right
[1:21:13] and the first part of preparation I did
[1:21:16] a little research on it I'm not a
[1:21:18] fantastic runner but there's a lot of
[1:21:20] information online so I did some
[1:21:23] research and what they were talking
[1:21:24] about it
[1:21:25] I wonder first part they talked about
[1:21:28] was mental preparation and he said I
[1:21:31] don't read this quick here yep you see
[1:21:35] they say you have to learn to visualize
[1:21:38] learn to visualize it's actually called
[1:21:41] visualization
[1:21:42] he said now all professional athletes do
[1:21:45] it he said you can picture yourself
[1:21:48] performing specific movements perfectly
[1:21:52] in your mind's eye he said you will
[1:21:55] often see skills going through the
[1:21:58] course in their head and as you're
[1:22:00] talking about it I began to realize it's
[1:22:01] true you see them standing there with a
[1:22:03] goggles on chewing gum looking at the
[1:22:06] course trying to get it right in their
[1:22:08] minds first he said you have to get any
[1:22:11] ahead first and visualizing every
[1:22:13] movement that they will make he said you
[1:22:17] can also use this technique in your
[1:22:18] running imagine certain situations like
[1:22:22] your legs getting heavy on how you will
[1:22:24] overcome the problem by running tall
[1:22:27] and keeping your strife short and quick
[1:22:31] or you're running neck-and-neck with
[1:22:33] someone and lengthening by your stride
[1:22:35] you could pull ahead of that person he
[1:22:37] said it's sometimes easier to deal with
[1:22:40] situations if you have experienced them
[1:22:43] once before so what that does is that
[1:22:51] the challenge now becomes easier because
[1:22:55] it's like you experienced it once before
[1:22:58] so it's almost like you're doing it
[1:23:00] twice but the first time you're doing it
[1:23:03] in your mind
[1:23:04] he said now he said running really does
[1:23:08] take place in your mind and he said
[1:23:10] after that it's just time to do it on
[1:23:12] the road so before you can run you have
[1:23:16] to know what you're running for and now
[1:23:20] you have to see yourself victorious
[1:23:23] before you could even get started you
[1:23:30] have to visualize yourself winning
[1:23:32] before you could win you have to see
[1:23:36] yourself overcoming you have to see
[1:23:38] yourself perfected you have to see
[1:23:40] yourself a top 10 you have to see
[1:23:42] yourself making it you have to see
[1:23:44] yourself receiving the Holy Ghost you
[1:23:46] have to see yourself over calling this
[1:23:48] devil and that evam and back never you
[1:23:51] have to see yourself praying and conquer
[1:23:53] in brain and conquer and pray in a
[1:23:56] concrete you ain't even to it yet before
[1:23:59] Jesus was on the cross he was there
[1:24:01] crawling on travail in her tongue and
[1:24:04] Kemeny saying it's called hallelujah let
[1:24:07] his cup pass from me he had to overcome
[1:24:10] first on his knees before he became a
[1:24:12] champion on the cross and that's what
[1:24:15] every believer has to do this morning
[1:24:18] overcome right there I love you and God
[1:24:21] get face-to-face with your reality get
[1:24:24] face-to-face of your own mortality I'm
[1:24:27] saying not my will Lord but I will be
[1:24:30] done to receive God's will for your life
[1:24:34] oh I can't here this morning I can't
[1:24:38] hear this morning
[1:24:44] let the weak say I am strong
[1:24:48] he's now Oh hallelujah I propose 23:7
[1:24:53] says as a man thinketh in his heart so
[1:24:55] is he
[1:24:57] so if you don't think that you can make
[1:24:59] it then you're not gonna make it but if
[1:25:02] you know that your name was written
[1:25:04] hallelujah in a Lamb's Book of Life if
[1:25:07] you know you got over coming in you then
[1:25:09] brother you gonna make it well are you
[1:25:12] gonna overcome if you know if you know
[1:25:15] who you are and who God says you are
[1:25:18] then you can have confidence and -
[1:25:20] forget about what the world says forget
[1:25:23] about what this one's saying on that one
[1:25:25] say what does God say about you this
[1:25:27] morning you are more than conquerors or
[1:25:31] more than able praise call
[1:25:35] [Applause]
[1:25:43] caleb any touchy mountain yet caleb only
[1:25:46] looking at a mountain
[1:25:47] what's fast killer was concerned he
[1:25:50] don't have a horse up there long time
[1:25:52] and these fellas was keeping him back
[1:25:54] but he said these good brothers who lost
[1:25:57] their faith along the journey but I only
[1:26:00] follow the Lord my God hallelujah now
[1:26:03] therefore give me my Mountain
[1:26:06] I want my Mountain you gotta speak for
[1:26:09] yours

[1:26:27] be reckless and faint o give him praise
[1:26:32] give him praise give him praise this
[1:26:35] morning you have to be able to catch a
[1:26:47] vision camera run until you catch the
[1:26:50] vision first get the whole plan in your
[1:26:53] mind see and that's what the vision of
[1:26:58] God requires that's what the vision of
[1:27:00] God helps us to do to see what what God
[1:27:03] has required of us to see what is
[1:27:06] necessary to overcome isn't that right
[1:27:09] how about cocteau says the Lord answered
[1:27:12] me and said write the vision and make it
[1:27:15] plain upon tables that he may run that
[1:27:20] read it the purpose of writing the
[1:27:23] vision the purpose of making it plain
[1:27:25] was that you and I could have something
[1:27:28] to do we cannot run if we cannot read it
[1:27:31] we kind of run if it wasn't made plain
[1:27:33] to us but the gospel has been made plain
[1:27:36] to us in a time when it never was before
[1:27:39] we have a full understanding of who we
[1:27:43] are who God is and who the devil is and
[1:27:47] now that we understand the vision

[1:28:21] appointed time the finishing line is not
[1:28:24] in front of you finish line's down it's
[1:28:29] not a finish way no that's not the
[1:28:32] reason Bible talk about long-suffering

[1:29:33] the enemy will be hissing on every side
[1:29:36] but Christ was on his way to the cross

[1:29:41] every side but he had to make it in

[1:31:59] suffering so we connected to our five
[1:32:00] senses we connected to our feelings and
[1:32:03] we declare this as reality because

[1:36:25] I was thinking about a box I got already
[1:36:28] found match and there was a there was a
[1:36:31] story one time with a boxer I think I
[1:36:32] told it in a young people service and
[1:36:36] one time he was getting ready to fight
[1:36:38] somebody and this guy was a this guy was
[1:36:40] a killer he was killed people in the
[1:36:42] ring he's very good and this guy had to
[1:36:45] go up against him and one day his
[1:36:47] manager called him in and said your next
[1:36:49] matches this guy this guy's a killer
[1:36:53] last report we had was that he hit
[1:36:54] somebody in the head their brain
[1:36:56] dislodged and they felt that in the ring
[1:36:58] so they play back the tape with the last
[1:37:00] match where they killed this guy and the
[1:37:02] manager was trying to discourage him and
[1:37:04] tell him you really should think about
[1:37:06] this before you go in there and the guy
[1:37:09] looked at him looking at the tape and he

[1:58:17] revival until we get men God called men
[1:58:21] not man call men but God call men
[1:58:26] quatrain that's not trained up in the
[1:58:30] schools of theology and of education but
[1:58:33] rugged men of faith that Court has
[1:58:37] brought up in the school of his rugged
[1:58:39] training Oh
[1:58:41] God has his own school a school of
[1:58:44] rugged training Oh hallelujah
[1:58:48] hallelujah it's not an easy road Oh
[1:58:52] hallelujah but its glorius men were not
[1:58:55] afraid to face the fire men who come in
[1:58:59] the presence of God and knows his power
[1:59:02] knows his omnipotence
[1:59:03] and knows his healing power some men
[1:59:07] that's trained to know the Living God
[1:59:09] it's alright to train them by the word
[1:59:12] let let it kill it but the spirit giveth
[1:59:15] life and he said before we can have this
[1:59:17] revival God has called out and trained
[1:59:20] men God trained me to carry this message
[1:59:24] and they don't care what the opposition
[1:59:27] is they are willing to go to the fiery
[1:59:30] furnace in defeat what are the lions
[1:59:33] then or wherever it may be they're ready
[1:59:36] to go because they've been in the
[1:59:38] presence of God and they know that he is
[1:59:41] whether it's the victory or defeat
[1:59:44] they'll stand the same or will you stand
[1:59:47] the same this morning don't you want to
[1:59:50] be God trained when you know him in a
[1:59:57] resurrection of his power the talk skies
[1:59:59] are not sign of his approval the
[2:00:01] sunshine is not sign of his approval but
[2:00:04] his approval is your acceptance in the
[2:00:06] beloved and he could take you to the
[2:00:08] fire he could take it to the test he
[2:00:11] could take you to the sorrow he could
[2:00:13] take you to the pain he could take you
[2:00:15] to those moments of uncertainty but yet
[2:00:18] in my flesh shall I see God you got a
[2:00:21] promise down the road and nothing's
[2:00:24] gonna stir you nothing's gonna take your
[2:00:26] eye off the prize
[2:00:29] [Applause]
[2:00:30] yeah oh that's how we got to be isn't
[2:00:34] there right oh my that's the kind of
[2:00:38] training God does to men and it's very
[2:00:41] strange to think that God would do that
[2:00:43] that got trains men like that but he
[2:00:46] does you know we have an old song we
[2:00:49] sing some through the waters and some
[2:00:52] through the flow some through deep
[2:00:55] trials but all through the blood God
[2:00:58] leads his people through great trials to
[2:01:01] purge them hallelujah cut you to prune
[2:01:06] you eat up bring forth fruit I'll cut
[2:01:09] you to bring forth more fruit I put you
[2:01:11] to bring forth much food Clippy and clip
[2:01:14] it in what's he doing cutting off the
[2:01:16] world offer you cutting off all those
[2:01:18] things that hinder the flow of God in
[2:01:21] your life and you're getting more like
[2:01:24] God and that's like the world you begin
[2:01:27] to resemble that tree that is planted by
[2:01:29] the rivers of water that bringeth forth
[2:01:32] fruit in his season whose leaves also
[2:01:35] shall not wither and whatever you do
[2:01:37] will prosper that's the kind of man God
[2:01:40] loves God told Joshua meditate on the
[2:01:43] world day and night that you might have
[2:01:47] good success or stay in the presence if
[2:01:50] you abide in me and I abide in you you
[2:01:54] can ask whatever you will because you
[2:01:57] have a relationship with the father ask
[2:02:00] anything in my name go to put his hand
[2:02:03] up on you wherever you are turn left
[2:02:06] turn right there's a sister that he's

[2:02:20] church they had back in Ephesus one time
[2:02:25] Paul needed prayin for God sent a man
[2:02:28] named Ananias what if I known I wasn't

[2:02:34] God to help the servant of God come into
[2:02:37] a place where he could empower others
[2:02:40] and minister to others he himself at
[2:02:43] that time needed somebody to pray for
[2:02:46] him and no matter how little you might
[2:02:49] feel your ministry is it plays a very
[2:02:51] important role in the script of God's
[2:02:54] play in the script of God's drama holily
[2:02:58] as small as amen amen
[2:03:00] Ananias his rule was as small as Tywin
[2:03:04] who carried across it was it small roles
[2:03:07] homonyms hurry not much at all about him
[2:03:10] in the Bible but this one role he had
[2:03:12] this one party had to play what's the
[2:03:15] help Jesus carry his cross this little
[2:03:18] man Oh hallelujah hallelujah but he did

[2:05:05] training such men to meet the frontline
[2:05:08] men who are going through and time shook
[2:05:12] from their feet sometimes looked like

[2:08:25] oh my race is not for the Swift nor the
[2:08:33] battle to the strong it's not a based on
[2:08:36] speed based on human merit human ability
[2:08:39] no it's about enduring it's about
[2:08:43] persevering it's about going all the way
[2:08:46] Elijah couldn't stop a gilga
[2:08:48] you couldn't stop at better though the
[2:08:51] Prophet himself said stay here
[2:08:53] pull him steer here this would be good
[2:08:56] for you the Prophet said you had not
[2:08:57] enough schooling yet stay and get a
[2:08:59] little education but he likes I said no
[2:09:02] as long as I saw a lever I will not
[2:09:05] leave thee I see a vision I want
[2:09:08] something I tasted something up over
[2:09:11] yonder and I want what you got I want a
[2:09:14] total portion of that spirit upon me
[2:09:16] because I know I can make it without
[2:09:19] that spirit I'm hungry I'm desperate I'm
[2:09:22] fasting
[2:09:23] I'm crying oh oh
[2:09:26] going beyond himself he lashes on
[2:09:31] miracles and still that wasn't enough he
[2:09:35] wanted a double portion he likes just so
[2:09:38] great things he lights up in with Elijah
[2:09:40] a long journey but a journey wasn't over
[2:09:43] yet this time to cross Jordan and Elijah
[2:09:46] was willing to go over Jordan with
[2:09:48] Elijah
[2:09:49] wherever that prophet go he wasn't gonna
[2:09:52] take his eyes off of the prize he wasn't
[2:09:54] gonna take his eyes off of the trophy
[2:09:56] off of what God had for him he was
[2:09:59] determined he was fully persuaded he was
[2:10:02] just for it he was convinced and that's
[2:10:05] how you have to be every service every
[2:10:08] opportunity every prayer meeting I'm
[2:10:11] convinced I'm persuaded that's a night
[2:10:14] could be my night not the day for me my
[2:10:17] chair I can be filled right now
[2:10:21] hallelujah hallelujah oh my to him that
[2:10:33] overcometh my god is it it with me in my

[2:10:39] gift to you in order to overcome and
[2:10:44] when you overcome Oh hallelujah
[2:10:47] then God will give you a crown it's now
[2:10:48] right Oh grant is hit me might roll in
[2:10:52] there I'd auto race therefore it's not
[2:10:53] about winning Oh hallelujah
[2:10:55] but it's about enduring see some pure
[2:10:57] waters some sort of flood a man and the
[2:10:59] book of Ephesians says till we all come
[2:11:01] to the unity of the faith and a
[2:11:03] knowledge of the Son of God amen until
[2:11:06] we all come into Christ into all measure
[2:11:09] into the measure of the stature in there
[2:11:11] and oh my first conscience 9 says no you
[2:11:15] know that Rhonda Reese first conscience
[2:11:17] 9 says know ye not that they which run
[2:11:19] in a race run all this Paul speaking
[2:11:22] here but one receiveth the prize so run
[2:11:26] that ye may obtain Amen talk about
[2:11:28] natural reefs everyone runs one receives
[2:11:31] a prize but in this race we're running
[2:11:33] we can all receive victory in our
[2:11:36] individual lives in our individual race
[2:11:39] you have to see yourself as an
[2:11:40] individual running towards your mark
[2:11:42] running towards your prize but a high
[2:11:45] calling in Christ Jesus
[2:11:47] running Paul said that ye may obtain and
[2:11:51] every man that striveth for the mastery
[2:11:54] is temperate in all things now they do
[2:11:57] it to obtain a corruptible crown but we
[2:12:00] an incorruptible Oh hallelujah they're
[2:12:04] running for gold and silver that
[2:12:06] perishes but creature is feet tried and
[2:12:09] fire it's both creature and gold that
[2:12:12] perishes no greater and silver and
[2:12:14] things of the world build your hopes on
[2:12:16] things eternal and hold to God's
[2:12:19] unchanging hand hallelujah
[2:12:22] Oh our treasures all built up ojala
[2:12:26] beyond the blue beyond the skies Oh
[2:12:29] hallelujah do you feel that way this
[2:12:31] morning oh my idea for so run not as
[2:12:37] uncertainly so fight I not as one that
[2:12:40] beateth the air Paulson but I keep under
[2:12:44] my body and bring it into subjection
[2:12:45] lest that by any means when i have
[2:12:48] preached to others i myself should be a
[2:12:51] castaway a man it's not right
[2:12:54] freeze the name of the Lord I'm getting
[2:12:56] ready to close Connolly in Philippians 3
[2:12:59] Paul said I'm an and we know Paul ran
[2:13:01] his race it's now right holily he said
[2:13:04] not as though I have already attained a
[2:13:07] man either that we will already prove it
[2:13:09] he said but I follow after if that I may
[2:13:12] apprehend that for which also I am
[2:13:15] apprehended of Christ Jesus and he said
[2:13:18] brethren I count not myself to have
[2:13:20] apprehended but this one thing I do
[2:13:23] forgetting those things which are behind
[2:13:26] and reaching forth unto those things
[2:13:29] which are before forget about your past
[2:13:32] forget about your failures forget about
[2:13:34] your shortcomings
[2:13:35] you can't drive properly if you're
[2:13:38] looking in a ref you mirror look in
[2:13:40] front of you this morning

[2:13:44] your pants legs be patted at the knees I
[2:13:47] catch a vision of heaven and God will
[2:13:50] take you all the one day to the side and
[2:13:53] give you a power Oh
[2:13:56] yeah reach into those things that are
[2:13:59] before Paul said hi press somebody say
[2:14:03] hi
[2:14:04] somebody say hi one more time toward the
[2:14:09] mark for the prize of the high calling
[2:14:12] in Christ Jesus he says I fought a good
[2:14:20] fight
[2:14:21] I've finished of course I've kept my
[2:14:24] faith I went Paul finishes race he
