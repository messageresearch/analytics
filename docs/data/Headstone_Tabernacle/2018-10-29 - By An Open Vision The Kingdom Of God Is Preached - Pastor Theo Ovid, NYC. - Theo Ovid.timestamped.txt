[0:14] god bless you good evening if we may
[0:17] stand up as we start our service tonight
[0:20] are you happy to hear this tonight let
[0:24] us take our Bible just before we start
[0:26] I'd like us to the read through in the
[0:30] book of John the seventeenth chapter and
[0:35] I'd like you to take a time here to read
[0:37] the prayer that Jesus did for you and me
[0:40] tonight this phrase as effect is as
[0:44] effective as it was when Jesus prayed it
[0:47] a Menem and it's in John chapter seven
[0:51] seventeenth sorry and starting from the
[0:55] first verse and Jesus praying say this
[0:59] father the hour is come glorify thy son
[1:04] that thy son also may glorify thee as
[1:07] thou hast given him power over all flesh
[1:11] that he shall give eternal life to as
[1:14] many as thou hast given him and this is
[1:17] life eternal that they made that they
[1:20] might know thee the only true God and
[1:23] Jesus Christ whom thou has sent I have
[1:28] glorified thee on earth on the earth I
[1:30] have finished the work which thou givest
[1:34] me to do and now Oh father glorify thou
[1:39] me with thine own self with the glory
[1:42] which I had with thee before the world
[1:45] was I have manifested thy name unto the
[1:49] men which thou gavest me out of the
[1:53] world then they were and thou givest
[1:57] them me and they have kept thy word now
[2:02] they have known that all things
[2:04] whatsoever thou hast given me
[2:07] ah of thee for I have given unto them
[2:11] the words which thou givest me and they
[2:15] have received them and have known surely
[2:18] that I came out from thee and they have
[2:21] believed that thou didst send me
[2:25] I pray for them I pray not for the world
[2:29] but for them which thou hast given me
[2:33] for their vine and all mine are thine
[2:39] and thine are mine and I am glorified in
[2:42] them and now I am no more in the world
[2:46] but these are in the world and I come to
[2:51] thee Holy Father keep through thine own
[2:55] name for those whom thou hast given me
[2:59] that they may be one as we are while I
[3:04] was with with them in the world I kept
[3:07] them in thy name
[3:08] those that thou givest me I have kept
[3:12] and none of them is lost but the son of
[3:15] prediction that the scripture might be
[3:18] fulfilled and now come I to thee and
[3:22] these things I speak in the world
[3:25] that they might have my joy fulfilled in
[3:30] themselves I have given them thy word
[3:33] and the world hath hated them because
[3:37] they are not of the world even as I am
[3:41] NOT of the world I pray not that thou
[3:45] should take them out of the world but
[3:49] that thou should keep them from the evil
[3:53] they are not of the world even as I am
[3:56] NOT of the world sanctify them through
[4:00] the truth today truth thy Word is truth
[4:04] as thou hast sent me into the world even
[4:08] so have I also sent them into the world
[4:11] and for their sakes i sanctify myself
[4:14] that they also might be sanctified to
[4:17] the truth neither pray I for these alone
[4:21] but for them also which are which shall
[4:25] believe on me through the world that's
[4:28] for you and me that they may all that
[4:33] they all may be one as thou father are
[4:36] in me
[4:37] and I in thee that they also may be one
[4:41] in us that the world may believe that
[4:45] thou hast sent me and the glory which
[4:49] thou gavest me I have given them that
[4:51] they may be one even as we are one I in
[4:55] them and thou in me that they may be one
[4:59] that that may be perfect that they may
[5:01] be made perfect in one and that the
[5:04] world may know that I has sent me and
[5:08] hast loved them as thou hast loved me
[5:12] father I will that they also whom thou
[5:16] hast given me be with me where I am that
[5:19] they may behold my glory which thou has
[5:22] given me for thou loved me before the
[5:26] foundation of the world all righteous
[5:28] father the world hath not known in thee
[5:31] but I have known thee and these have
[5:35] known that thou has sent me and I have
[5:39] declared unto them thy name and we
[5:42] declare it that the love wherewith thou
[5:46] hast loved me may be in them and I in

[49:59] hallelujah how many are happy Holi
[50:05] David said I was glad when they said
[50:09] unto me just a statement when they said
[50:13] unto me it made him happy
[50:16] amen amen how much more happy is when we
[50:19] are in the house amen amen I told the
[50:22] story one time how we had gone to
[50:27] service rather to eat after a service
[50:30] and we were approaching the restaurant
[50:34] and next to the restaurant there was
[50:36] some kind of sports restaurant and there
[50:39] was a game going on and I guess it was a
[50:43] well that was drinking there and so
[50:45] forth then we were just next door to a
[50:47] quiet place but next to a very rowdy and
[50:54] you know I was thinking you know we're
[50:58] having a nice quiet dinner here and what
[51:01] if I went over on the other side and
[51:03] said you know hey you're acting too
[51:07] happy or whatever just calm down
[51:09] are you kidding me I probably wouldn't
[51:12] be here tonight to be speaking to you
[51:14] tonight you know why because they were
[51:17] in their place in their element in their
[51:20] spirit but this is our place we're in
[51:23] the spirit on the Lord's Day
[51:26] amen and nobody should feel funny amen
[51:29] about worshiping the Lord Jesus purpose
[51:34] we here for I'm a man god bless you I
[51:37] want to sing a song that we sing here
[51:41] and I think we've sung it around and in
[51:46] the field it's the life behind the name
[51:49] because that uh now I want to try that
[51:53] you turn around and shake somebody's
[51:55] hand but just make sure you keep your
[51:57] seats
[51:58] hey man because it is karate tonight and
[52:03] but it's the life amen
[52:06] I believe that that's a revelation amen
[52:10] because it's not so much teaching it's
[52:14] not so much how well we can expound on
[52:18] the word and unless the life is in the
[52:23] believer
[52:24] amen our living is in vain that's right
[52:28] so I like this song very much because
[52:31] the devil doesn't like it I like it
[52:34] it's a life behind the name oh it's the
[52:37] life behind a name that makes the
[52:42] turnaround and greet some of I be her
[52:47] that makes up our humble
[52:51] it was God who devised a plan that it
[52:55] all he could live give us the life
[53:03] behind the name
[53:06] yes the light behind the name
[53:11] [Music]
[53:13] it's a life behind the name that makes
[53:18] up
[53:23] [Applause]
[53:24] and all things as a man
[53:31] [Music]
[53:34] hey Angie
[53:43] [Music]
[53:57] [Music]
[54:00] [Applause]
[54:05] like behind the name that makes the
[54:10] demons tremble Maui is behind the name
[54:16] [Music]
[54:19] it
[54:22] [Music]
[54:38] [Applause]
[54:46] [Applause]
[54:58] the preachers time I want to get the
[55:03] preacher up to the platform just as
[55:05] quickly as we can I believe tonight
[55:07] we're first of all I want to welcome you
[55:16] all to the original faith the gospel
[55:18] tabernacle and some of you who are here
[55:21] for the first time well this is where we
[55:24] worship the Lord and we're we're so
[55:29] blessed I mean we are so blessed and we
[55:34] have seen God do wonderful things among
[55:37] us and deal with his people in a very
[55:40] personal way and we have learned to
[55:45] always count our blessings and sometimes
[55:49] that we forget to thank God about the
[55:51] little things there's so many things
[55:53] that God has done for you today actually
[55:55] and you forgot to thank him for because
[55:59] he's always doing things for us amen and
[56:02] so we are always indebted to him so this
[56:06] is why when we get together like this
[56:08] there's no reason why we just cannot
[56:11] fully express how we feel welcome those
[56:17] that are online
[56:18] I understand
[56:20] there are quite a few online brother
[56:24] Theo Ovid is well a world traveler he
[56:28] has many friends and in Africa and
[56:31] throughout they're listening in and I'm
[56:34] sure locally throughout America I just
[56:37] trust and pray that our streaming
[56:40] service will be enough we are we're
[56:44] going to try to change it soon - I guess
[56:48] YouTube I think they have a much broader
[56:51] bandwidth to be able to handle the load
[56:54] so but anyway we're glad to be here and
[56:57] you know I am so thankful that you know
[57:04] today if we were to listen to the
[57:07] weather forecasts we probably wouldn't
[57:11] be here today
[57:13] and they're trained men they looking at
[57:19] their radars and looking at you know and
[57:22] I had invited you know brothers you know
[57:25] and to come and and one of the brothers
[57:29] said you know there's gonna be a
[57:31] nor'easter
[57:33] that's coming your way and I say well
[57:36] that's beyond my ability to control that
[57:39] we're having a meeting that's for sure
[57:41] so that's that's all I know so amen
[57:47] so what happened to the nor'easter you
[57:49] see the devil had a plan and God had a
[57:53] plan that's right and I'm gonna tell you
[57:55] something God's plan always with amen
[57:58] probably because if God is with us who
[58:01] can be against us amen amen
[58:03] so tonight I do not want to delay any
[58:07] further our precious brother I have
[58:10] known him for over nearly 30 years we've
[58:15] traveled together around the world when
[58:17] we were young and I took him out to eat
[58:19] yesterday we were just talking and
[58:21] reminiscing about our our age
[58:31] you see we we stand behind a pulpit and
[58:34] come out like a roaring lion and we wake
[58:38] up with assistance in the morning your
[58:43] back is hurting everything else and you
[58:45] know just to show you you're not getting
[58:48] any younger
[58:49] but one thing under the anointing and
[58:52] inspiration of the Holy Spirit amen he
[58:55] gives us the strength to go on a man and
[58:58] brother Theo was telling me such a I
[59:00] mean I I laugh because it was so
[59:03] humorous that if you ever want to know
[59:07] honestly something straight ask a child
[59:13] ask her grand son granddaughter because
[59:18] he was telling me how his grand child
[59:22] told grandpa you know I'm young you know
[59:27] they'll tell you whether you have of
[59:29] something on your head or something I'll
[59:31] tell you what is that
[59:32] you know so I like the I like how that
[59:36] is you know so but anyway they have
[59:39] nothing to really you know that's just a
[59:42] sincerity of their heart so God richly
[59:44] bless you
[59:45] I believe with all my heart that the
[59:49] time is late meaning not late tonight
[59:53] but late in season and
[59:57] we realize when we think that the world
[1:00:01] our United States cannot get any crazier
[1:00:06] than what it has been we hear the news
[1:00:11] of today
[1:00:12] the world is going insane brother Graham
[1:00:16] said the world will end up insane what
[1:00:19] does that mean that means when you can
[1:00:23] no longer discern when right becomes
[1:00:27] wrong and wrong becomes right
[1:00:30] your insight and the world is headed in
[1:00:34] that direction you know I talk about
[1:00:36] fake news and so forth or whatever you
[1:00:38] don't even know what to believe
[1:00:39] thank god this is why I this is this is
[1:00:43] my news right here
[1:00:46] amen long after this world is gone this
[1:00:49] work this this word will stand forever
[1:00:52] heaven and earth will pass away but this
[1:00:55] word will never pass away and this is
[1:00:58] where I stand tonight just before
[1:01:01] brother overcomes I just wanted to just
[1:01:05] read one quote and then I will have our
[1:01:07] precious brother come because we
[1:01:09] realized that this is a unity meeting
[1:01:13] tonight and I appreciate each and every
[1:01:15] one I I for the sake of time I'm not
[1:01:18] going to try to name everyone but
[1:01:20] they've come from probably if we have
[1:01:23] some time we'll do that we'll do it
[1:01:25] tomorrow
[1:01:25] but we'll save some time tonight what we
[1:01:28] want to tell you welcome warm welcome
[1:01:33] New York welcome I know that New Yorkers
[1:01:37] are are considered well rule that's the
[1:01:41] nature of a New Yorker but when you're
[1:01:44] born again amen you take on another
[1:01:47] nature amen amen and we are brothers and
[1:01:50] sisters no matter what it is that we we
[1:01:53] may disagree but at the end of the day
[1:01:56] what I have found out truly after all
[1:01:59] this time that love and your attitude
[1:02:03] you see brothers and sisters disagree
[1:02:07] flesh brothers and sisters disagree but
[1:02:10] they cannot deny the fact that they are
[1:02:12] brothers and sisters yes you see and so
[1:02:15] much more us we may disagree on this and
[1:02:18] that but it doesn't mean that we should
[1:02:20] just start start killing each other you
[1:02:24] see but there's gonna be a unity of the
[1:02:26] faith I think that with all my heart
[1:02:29] and everybody you know goes around today
[1:02:33] in trying their best because I what I
[1:02:37] like about brother yo but I don't I've
[1:02:40] never seen he's had any kind of agenda
[1:02:43] any secret agenda you know we have
[1:02:46] people that go around
[1:02:47] oh this experience happened to me and
[1:02:50] and this and that and and people just
[1:02:53] follow that experience and follow the
[1:02:57] person who is speaking about that
[1:03:00] experience but we realize that every
[1:03:03] experience that we you and I have passed
[1:03:06] to match up with the word amen amen
[1:03:08] because at the end of the day it is the
[1:03:12] word that's right I'm in our experience
[1:03:15] you see and brother Branham said about
[1:03:18] Paul when he was when he met the pillar
[1:03:21] fire so Paul goes down there first to
[1:03:25] see if his experience matched God's
[1:03:29] Bible see after he experienced the
[1:03:32] pillar fire he wanted to make sure that
[1:03:34] it matched God's Bible Oh wouldn't it be
[1:03:38] wonderful today if people only done that
[1:03:42] again if we made our experience match
[1:03:45] God's Bible if it doesn't then our
[1:03:50] experience is wrong I mean simple as
[1:03:55] that but you don't know how it felt so
[1:03:59] your experience is wrong it is off door
[1:04:03] amen amen
[1:04:04] enjoy the feeling but it's wrong that's
[1:04:07] right you see it doesn't flash in the
[1:04:10] urine thumbing you see and what is a
[1:04:12] urine thumbin it's the work it's the
[1:04:14] message of this hour and this is why
[1:04:16] people just going little have going this
[1:04:19] way and just can you know lost turned
[1:04:22] around and they refuse to turn around
[1:04:24] meanwhile then the navigational systems
[1:04:27] on them you know the turn around turn
[1:04:29] around make up you may go back well if
[1:04:32] you know more than
[1:04:34] a tional system then go ahead but I'm
[1:04:37] I'm trusting in this navigational system
[1:04:39] here amen it will never mislead us see
[1:04:42] amen
[1:04:43] the urine thumbin and if it flashes see
[1:04:45] there Amen we got it but if it doesn't I
[1:04:49] don't care how good it is it seems how
[1:04:53] real it looks like it was right
[1:04:56] if those lights don't flash on that
[1:04:58] Hyrum Thummim it was wrong any matter
[1:05:02] how much experience you've had how real
[1:05:06] it seemed to be how presenting it is how
[1:05:11] educational it is see what a good what a
[1:05:15] great tool it is to win souls if it
[1:05:18] doesn't flesh in the word see it's wrong
[1:05:22] right see it must line up with the word
[1:05:26] and I'm so thankful that the bride is
[1:05:28] lining up the Word of God and that's
[1:05:31] what these this meeting is all about and
[1:05:34] one last quote because I was reading
[1:05:36] this some time ago and it just kind of
[1:05:39] struck me because I feel this is
[1:05:40] appropriate for tonight and then
[1:05:45] oh god perfecting his church now this is
[1:05:49] in Binghamton New York listen this is a
[1:05:55] personal New York you need a shake in
[1:06:02] here I say amen to that hey man
[1:06:07] oh we had chickens sure we need more
[1:06:11] shakes right we need we need to be
[1:06:14] shaken and shaken and take shaking until
[1:06:16] we shake right into the word and God
[1:06:19] will and his purpose in our lives in New
[1:06:23] York I like that you need a shake in
[1:06:25] here I haven't got the ability as a
[1:06:28] minister to do to do it as a preacher I
[1:06:32] know I'm a spare tire but my heavenly
[1:06:35] father see he's big enough to do it and
[1:06:38] I trust it to him that he'll do it and I
[1:06:42] love you and I maybe if I am inker if my
[1:06:47] incorrect way of demonstrating myself or
[1:06:50] giving out to the way I feel maybe it
[1:06:54] isn't it's it's insufficient or it isn't
[1:06:59] influencing you're educated and smart
[1:07:03] people this is why I say is like what's
[1:07:06] your education and your smartness
[1:07:07] because it's just a stumbling block to
[1:07:10] the spirit see but I know what I'm
[1:07:15] talking about
[1:07:16] the Prophet I like this he said I know
[1:07:20] what I'm talking about
[1:07:22] he often said I may not know the Bible
[1:07:25] real well but I know the author and
[1:07:27] that's the most important thing we can
[1:07:29] see but I know what I'm talking about I
[1:07:31] know the love of God I know the power of
[1:07:35] God and I know that he is and maybe he
[1:07:39] will manifest himself in a divine gift
[1:07:42] may the Lord bless you and I say well
[1:07:46] New York we need a shakin
[1:07:48] because brother Brown said that the
[1:07:51] United States we send out the most
[1:07:53] missionaries around the world and quite
[1:07:56] frankly we need them the most
[1:07:58] so I am so happy to receive brother Ovid
[1:08:03] I love him with all my heart and he is a
[1:08:06] person that walks alone when you walk
[1:08:12] with God you're gonna have to walk alone
[1:08:13] many people are not gonna understand you
[1:08:16] when I say alone I'm saying not
[1:08:18] necessarily alone but not with a great
[1:08:21] great fanfare and a great host of people
[1:08:24] and so forth you've got to spend on your
[1:08:27] conviction and you will not have many
[1:08:29] people that will understand you but now
[1:08:32] will the pressures of the outside world
[1:08:35] make you change and if it does you're
[1:08:38] not called to to stand for this work
[1:08:41] you're not and so therefore I'm I am
[1:08:45] proud and I am so blessed to have our
[1:08:48] precious brother Theo Ovid he's very
[1:08:50] busy and he took this time to step to
[1:08:54] New York and to be with us I think he's
[1:08:58] going to another part of Africa then
[1:09:00] South Africa after this I don't know how
[1:09:03] he does it
[1:09:04] amen but god bless him and we're under
[1:09:08] expectation amen how many are under
[1:09:12] expectation I believe that God can do
[1:09:14] playing a man whatever your needs may be
[1:09:18] whatever god I told her the over to just
[1:09:21] have your Liberty
[1:09:22] whatever it is that the Lord laid upon
[1:09:24] your heart we are message believers we
[1:09:27] believe this message amen and people
[1:09:29] want to say what do you believe I
[1:09:31] believe this message yeah that's as
[1:09:32] simple as that so but anyway soon and
[1:09:37] very soon we're going to see the king do
[1:09:39] you believe that I snap to our I receive
[1:09:41] our precious brother soon and very soon

[1:12:23] want to read and the child samuel
[1:12:26] ministered unto the Lord before Eli and
[1:12:29] the words of the Lord was precious in
[1:12:32] those days
[1:12:33] there was no open vision next scripture
[1:12:40] is Matthew chapter 24 we learn from
[1:12:43] verse 11 the fourteenth a many false
[1:12:50] prophets shall arise and deceive many
[1:12:52] and because iniquity shall abound the
[1:12:55] love of many shall wax cool but he did
[1:12:59] endure unto the end the same shall be
[1:13:02] saved and this gospel of the kingdom
[1:13:05] shall be preached in all the world for a
[1:13:09] witness unto all nations and then shall
[1:13:13] the end come
[1:13:14] the last scripture familiar scripture
[1:13:18] Luke 16 verse 16 the law and the
[1:13:22] prophets
[1:13:22] 1 till John since that time the kingdom
[1:13:27] of God is preached and every man press
[1:13:30] it into it may God bless his word you

[1:13:42] we take it approval egde because we
[1:13:47] don't know what's gonna happen next week
[1:13:48] you don't know one off the next year you
[1:13:52] don't even know the next month we know
[1:13:54] that America is sitting on the prophecy
[1:13:58] blues Angelis is on the prophecy yes
[1:14:01] your life also is on the prophecy
[1:14:05] Jerusalem is on the prophecy room is on
[1:14:08] the prophecy even God has to use his
[1:14:11] word to bring his things to pass so when
[1:14:14] the prophecy is spoken it hangs there
[1:14:16] until the time appointed so tonight I
[1:14:20] have a title by an open vision the
[1:14:24] kingdom of God is preached it's the
[1:14:26] title tonight my open vision the kingdom
[1:14:29] of God is preached I have a subject the
[1:14:31] kingdom is not in word but in power and
[1:14:35] Ivan inspirations try even to end
[1:14:39] and be positionally pleased image
[1:14:43] striving to enter in and be positionally
[1:14:46] please now of a context scripture and
[1:14:50] this on st. mark 114 now after that John
[1:14:53] was put in prison Jesus came into
[1:14:54] Galilee preaching the gospel of the
[1:14:57] kingdom of God seeing the time is
[1:15:00] fulfilled the kingdom of God is at hand
[1:15:03] repent II believe the gospel
[1:15:07] another scripture John 18 then Pilate
[1:15:10] entered the judgment hall again and
[1:15:12] called Jesus and said that dog the king
[1:15:14] of the jews and jesus answered him
[1:15:16] saying says doubt this of thyself or did
[1:15:18] others tell thee of me Pilate and said
[1:15:22] am I a Jew that or nation and chief
[1:15:25] priests of deliver thee unto me what has
[1:15:27] thou done jesus answered my kingdom is
[1:15:30] not of this world we are not talking
[1:15:34] about church we are talking about a
[1:15:37] kingdom he said my kingdom not of this
[1:15:39] world if my kingdom were of this world
[1:15:42] then would my servants fight and I would
[1:15:45] be not be delivered to the Jews but now
[1:15:47] is my kingdom not from hence the
[1:15:49] amplified of that is Jesus were saying
[1:15:52] my kingdom or kingship or royal power
[1:15:56] belongs not in this world if my kingdom
[1:15:59] were of this world my followers would
[1:16:02] have been fighting to keep me from being
[1:16:04] handed over the Jews but my kingdom is
[1:16:06] not from here it has no such original
[1:16:09] source I like that it has not arisen for
[1:16:13] source our kingdom is not from here so
[1:16:17] therefore we are not limited by no
[1:16:19] Easter or spawns or anything we are
[1:16:23] limited by what man say we only governed
[1:16:26] by what God said see if the doctor say
[1:16:29] you have two more months to live back
[1:16:30] what the doctor says we still want to
[1:16:32] know what God said about the matter and
[1:16:35] if not situation is so dire and your
[1:16:38] situation so rough that's your situation
[1:16:40] but what is God seeing about your
[1:16:42] surgery
[1:16:43] that is why we're here tonight we go be
[1:16:46] a crisis the churches in crisis the
[1:16:50] world is a crisis be a crisis or glory
[1:16:53] to Gordon I'm in crisis we have to take
[1:16:56] critical action Oh glory to God amen
[1:16:59] hallelujah so the seven seals came to
[1:17:03] restore the prophetic vision but we
[1:17:05] could see something tonight and the
[1:17:07] prophetic vision was an open vision but
[1:17:09] you could see Clara I stole your destiny
[1:17:12] and what God ordained for you isn't that
[1:17:14] right so the brother branham on veal and
[1:17:17] unseal this prophetic vision that went
[1:17:20] through all the world and yet the drop
[1:17:22] the spirit of prophecy behind that
[1:17:24] vision the brick of prophesy yeah I'm
[1:17:26] till this hour because the vision is
[1:17:28] always for an appointed time so until
[1:17:31] that vision come to pass we have to stay
[1:17:33] under the spirit of prophecy to prophesy
[1:17:36] what will come to pass an equality
[1:17:39] remission 10 11
[1:17:41] he said doll must prophesy again and
[1:17:43] that's the bright prophesy again
[1:17:46] technicians and peoples and tongues but
[1:17:51] Jesus gave a prophecy he said this
[1:17:53] gospel of the kingdom must be preached
[1:17:56] not taught preached and then the end
[1:17:59] shall come so we are teaching for 40
[1:18:02] plus years but one day a volatile and I
[1:18:05] feel tonight it's a good night for peace

[1:26:44] understanding that you have to die that
[1:26:48] you have to Jordan without excuses
[1:26:52] without blaming others people people
[1:26:55] like to justify their position I am NOT
[1:26:58] going there because I am NOT
[1:27:01] fellowshiping with this brother because
[1:27:02] we don't believe the same thing that's a
[1:27:04] lie
[1:27:05] you are warmed up you are messed up
[1:27:07] because they say the Bible said if we
[1:27:10] say we have no sin we deceive ourselves
[1:27:13] but if we confess our sins he is willing
[1:27:17] and justifications and to cleanse us of
[1:27:21] all unrighteousness or glory not gonna
[1:27:24] we'll be under the blood of Jesus that
[1:27:26] we have fellowship one with another
[1:27:27] because the same blood for you is for me
[1:27:29] is not just one blood and that's blood
[1:27:32] is for you alone
[1:27:32] it's what we also say if God forgive you
[1:27:35] he could forgive me and if God forgives
[1:27:37] me he can forgive you and if that could
[1:27:40] brother yes cleanses us I'll be our
[1:27:41] fellowship one with another so we have a
[1:27:44] right to fellowship
[1:27:46] oh yeah we can disagree on this and
[1:27:47] disagree on that but we cannot
[1:27:48] fellowship it's too much too much land
[1:27:51] to be taken you're gonna find about that
[1:27:53] tomorrow
[1:27:54] oh please God mr. Maulana oh praise God
[1:28:00] so by the bottom right description we
[1:28:01] went tonight from Samuel and so we'll
[1:28:04] talk about the wood of Louis precious in
[1:28:05] those days and there was no open vision
[1:28:07] Eli a priest
[1:28:09] getting dim-sighted I'm not seeing what
[1:28:11] he's supposed to see I'm gonna to find
[1:28:13] this young man and call him out and give
[1:28:16] him a vision and a vision an open vision
[1:28:18] is the tyreq word of the Lord see that
[1:28:20] makes a difference
[1:28:21] the humming horn you're sleepy at this
[1:28:24] at that ball but sudden attack would
[1:28:26] come to you if your vision shaken up
[1:28:29] right
[1:28:30] you have a purpose no you have an intent
[1:28:32] no you have a vision no you have a
[1:28:34] desire no you have something that needs
[1:28:36] to be accomplished because gonna spoon
[1:28:38] to your heart so far I'm saying what is
[1:28:40] the vision that is the tyreq word of the
[1:28:41] Lord O Lord our God was precious in
[1:28:44] those days so hear him is very
[1:28:46] outstanding when we realized we are
[1:28:48] speaking from the scriptures it said
[1:28:50] there was no provision in those days of
[1:28:52] Samuel where there is no vision the
[1:28:54] people perish we must have a vision must
[1:28:59] you're the seed when churches have a
[1:29:01] vision when countries have a vision when
[1:29:03] President and Prime is a vision you see
[1:29:05] in the country in the churches when a
[1:29:07] family of a vision when a husband of a
[1:29:09] vision you see the effect of that the
[1:29:13] coefficient gives a sense of direction
[1:29:18] we must have a vision and vision comes
[1:29:21] to the prophets and it's the word of the
[1:29:23] Lord spoken to them so if we speak
[1:29:26] according to what the prophets said we
[1:29:27] are speaking a vision you're speaking
[1:29:30] division because God will only walk to
[1:29:32] the vision when God's of wind shall
[1:29:34] conceive he means that the comma bring a
[1:29:37] different interpretation that's what he
[1:29:38] said a virgin shall conceive and when he
[1:29:40] said that the transformation laugh is
[1:29:42] Mary will glory the course of the
[1:29:45] Scriptures is one thing you can get lost
[1:29:46] in translation
[1:29:47] he'll be transmitted right the voice of
[1:29:49] one kind of illness that's the word when
[1:29:52] God translate that has John the Baptist
[1:29:54] behold I send you Elijah that's the word
[1:29:56] translate that that's written bran
[1:29:59] and he shall turn the handsome return
[1:30:00] back to the faith of the Father that's
[1:30:01] the word that's you the children whose
[1:30:05] return literally back to the fate of the
[1:30:08] fathers the Amen praise God said
[1:30:11] whatever I said ah we need the voice of
[1:30:13] God today
[1:30:14] to meet the need of the hour he promises
[1:30:17] to be can rest assure he would keep his
[1:30:18] promise and that's the confidence that
[1:30:20] the believer has in his makeup he
[1:30:22] promised to meet the need and one reason
[1:30:25] that the church is in the condition it
[1:30:27] is in because there are so many voices
[1:30:29] so many other voices that track the
[1:30:32] church from the voice of God that is
[1:30:34] very doubtful that many would hear the
[1:30:36] voice of God do it spoke in your midst
[1:30:38] and perhaps never even understand it
[1:30:40] because it God Himself centered on the
[1:30:42] voices of the day and we noticed there
[1:30:45] are so many voices and if God promised
[1:30:47] he would give us that if other voices
[1:30:48] are contrary to the voice of God then it
[1:30:50] must be the voice of our enemy to
[1:30:53] confuse us and we would not understand
[1:30:55] the voice of God when it's book because
[1:30:58] when you confuse the counterfeit your
[1:31:01] mind still because you're confused you
[1:31:03] see faith is solid faith is revealed
[1:31:06] it is our rock you can't be confused
[1:31:09] that's why the Bible said right to
[1:31:11] vision and make it clean let's heat up
[1:31:15] really run because the vision has to
[1:31:17] bring clarity the quality of the vision
[1:31:21] oh and that's a noisy because this is it
[1:31:27] now what Jesus did to those guys walk
[1:31:30] with them they work with them to talk
[1:31:32] disciples they understood they did not
[1:31:34] understand because it was withholding
[1:31:37] from them so when Jesus resurrection
[1:31:39] ministry came he brings a bring clarity
[1:31:41] to the scriptures of the Old Testament
[1:31:44] he opened the word and openly understand
[1:31:47] it so now they have a vision they have
[1:31:49] clarity then he released them the
[1:31:51] promise out of that vision behold I send
[1:31:52] the promise of my father upon you
[1:31:54] timeliness it in Jerusalem until we do
[1:31:57] and perform on high so now they know and
[1:31:59] in his spirit now he's leaving with them
[1:32:01] he's a bad eye he's gone and they're not
[1:32:03] frustrated and not be pressed in the
[1:32:04] atmosphere why because a vision a
[1:32:07] revelation
[1:32:08] the
[1:32:08] the expectation every Silvester greetin
[1:32:10] atmosphere because they're looking for
[1:32:12] the power that is promised go on and
[1:32:14] bring you all forgive you nothing gonna
[1:32:16] get bring you over here books and tips
[1:32:17] and you're reading reading every day
[1:32:19] reading listening calling pinyon for
[1:32:21] that he bring you all to come into a
[1:32:23] manifestation the word was the word but
[1:32:26] the word became flesh the word was
[1:32:28] invisible until it became flesh when the
[1:32:30] word became flesh then it become visible
[1:32:32] so what want to be visible in you
[1:32:35] tonight
[1:32:36] they say there's so much boy says it get
[1:32:39] ins the voice of the supernatural get
[1:32:43] ins the voice of the supernatural
[1:32:46] this great mighty men or intellectual
[1:32:48] I'm entered in the intellectual
[1:32:50] conditions even sheep nation nations
[1:32:52] they are not overnight people but the
[1:32:54] sick nations and a person will be a bit
[1:32:56] confused there's so much voices but the
[1:32:59] voice of God how will we know is the
[1:33:01] voice of God question how would we know
[1:33:03] because it was then in the vinegar that
[1:33:06] prophet anybody knew brother Branham was
[1:33:08] the voice of God that's easy you could
[1:33:10] read and see the test somebody's a
[1:33:11] manifestation but how would you know
[1:33:13] other day how do we know is the voice of
[1:33:15] God because it would be a manifestation
[1:33:17] of the prophets would so what you after
[1:33:19] here is this is that that the Prophet
[1:33:21] will the madam Speaker that is how you
[1:33:24] know it's the voice of God it will be a
[1:33:26] manifestation of the prophets word and
[1:33:28] watch the true voice of God brings back
[1:33:30] that real living supernatural
[1:33:34] manifestation of the true Word of God
[1:33:37] okay hallelujah so we read the scripture
[1:33:41] mark 1:15 the time is fulfilled jesus
[1:33:44] said and the kingdom of God is at hand
[1:33:45] repent and believe the gospel
[1:33:48] Matthew 24:14 and the gospel of the
[1:33:51] kingdom shall be preached in all the
[1:33:52] world as a witness and then all nations
[1:33:55] and then shall the end come and we know
[1:33:58] that the gospel is not a word only but
[1:34:00] in power and demonstration of the custom
[1:34:02] or glory that got the gospel of the
[1:34:05] kingdom I want to talk a little bit
[1:34:08] about the kingdom kingdom has a king and
[1:34:10] that King owns everything including the
[1:34:13] people themselves in a kingdom the
[1:34:15] people are called subjects or citizens
[1:34:18] that's why he Ephesians to Stella's we
[1:34:21] are therefore no more strangers and
[1:34:22] foreigners but fellow citizens with the
[1:34:25] scenes and the hopes of God amen
[1:34:28] the people are subjects they don't vote
[1:34:30] the king in a hoot amount it is not a
[1:34:33] democracy it is not the people's choice
[1:34:36] the King owns everything and the
[1:34:39] definition of subject is a person who is
[1:34:41] under the Dominion or rule of a
[1:34:43] sovereign king and when you live in a
[1:34:45] kingdom you are under the rule of the
[1:34:47] king glory to God hallelujah leader so
[1:34:52] the Bible's about the king and the
[1:34:54] kingdom and his royal children I could
[1:34:58] hit a shot on that one
[1:34:59] not just the king not just the kingdom
[1:35:02] but his royal children isn't that right
[1:35:07] hallelujah so no you could understand
[1:35:10] his horror that Samuel God and he
[1:35:13] reacted when the King know you can
[1:35:17] understand sound of reaction from you as
[1:35:22] good as your king why are you asking for
[1:35:25] a king give the Lord a shout and God
[1:35:29] dropped them and said Samuel they have
[1:35:31] not rejected you rejected me well Chloe
[1:35:35] look or because they want a man King
[1:35:38] they want human they want
[1:35:41] Oh glory that God must be your king I'm
[1:35:52] a king of a domain the government is the
[1:35:53] territory and that's what make it a
[1:35:55] kingdom a kingdom is the governing impac
[1:35:58] of a king will over territory Kingdom
[1:36:01] must have a king a king is sovereignty
[1:36:04] is absolute hallelujah so the Ten
[1:36:07] Commandments moody says so let it be
[1:36:09] written
[1:36:09] it's fear so let it be done that's what
[1:36:12] their fellows talking when the right
[1:36:14] that's it
[1:36:15] the can change the laws they're absolute
[1:36:17] Oh glory to God our King laws is
[1:36:19] absolute
[1:36:20] Oh My so the word Dominion refers to the
[1:36:24] Kings Authority his domain refers to his
[1:36:26] territory all kingdoms have few things a
[1:36:30] king a territory a constitution which is
[1:36:33] a royal covenant sisindri
[1:36:36] subjects laws privileges code of ethics
[1:36:40] army economic security and social
[1:36:43] culture and protocols all Kingdom have
[1:36:46] that just want to strike two things
[1:36:48] territory sounds 24:1 deal it is the
[1:36:51] Lord and the fullness thereof the world
[1:36:53] and all that dwell therein isn't that
[1:36:55] right
[1:36:56] the Constitution the Bible is the
[1:36:58] confusion of this kingdom or glory
[1:37:00] record isn't that right but the system
[1:37:03] series the people that live under the
[1:37:05] rule of the king or this is the
[1:37:07] background on this channel under
[1:37:09] citizenship is a kingdom it's not a
[1:37:11] right but the privilege the benefits and
[1:37:14] privileges of the kingdom only when you
[1:37:25] access rights to all what the citizen
[1:37:28] gets Oh hallelujah
[1:37:31] so case dear but you have access it
[1:37:33] Cillian is there deliverance is there
[1:37:36] rituals dear revival as dear but you are
[1:37:39] accessing and you accessing it as a
[1:37:41] citizen of God's kingdom and the king is
[1:37:45] obligated to care for and protect and
[1:37:48] their one fear because is a reflection
[1:37:51] of the king himself so that's why the
[1:37:54] King cuz I'll never leave you I'll never
[1:37:55] forsake you but I'll be with you even in
[1:37:58] you know glowing cast your cares upon
[1:38:00] and he cares for years go glory to God
[1:38:03] and the privileges of benefits that the
[1:38:06] King put on his faithful citizens so
[1:38:08] once you are in a kingdom you are
[1:38:10] personally here is personally
[1:38:12] responsible for you and your needs
[1:38:14] that's why the Bible says seek first the
[1:38:16] kingdom of God and all other things
[1:38:18] shall be added unto you because once you
[1:38:21] are in the kingdom he's responsible for
[1:38:23] your need so don't ever take your
[1:38:25] troubling God knock on heaven's door you
[1:38:27] need a healin nothing heaven store
[1:38:30] financially - nothing eventhough you
[1:38:32] need a revival you need something at
[1:38:34] Perkin in your soul Oh glory to God
[1:38:37] hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus please
[1:38:40] God amen hallelujah
[1:38:43] so this kingdom concept oh god some you
[1:38:48] so therefore okay so okay so like in the
[1:38:54] royal family British monarch the
[1:38:56] children are born normal children
[1:38:58] so if Prince somebody or King somebody a
[1:39:02] couple has called them if their child
[1:39:04] come to America they would be talking
[1:39:06] and if they don't know who they are they
[1:39:10] will just grow up anybody else but
[1:39:12] backwards whatever it is so they are
[1:39:17] born as normal children but no re is
[1:39:21] what but for much of history the young
[1:39:23] churn of British monarchs were primary
[1:39:26] raised by nannies almost never mixed
[1:39:28] with commoners and spent most of the
[1:39:30] time being drilled by private tutors
[1:39:32] that would sound familiar in history
[1:39:35] decorum andrius languages they are
[1:39:38] tutored into royalty to think and act
[1:39:42] and dress and live a certain way and
[1:39:45] that is why you come to church that you
[1:39:48] could get pink into royalty that is why
[1:39:52] you come to get the word that you could
[1:39:54] be transformed by the renewing of your
[1:39:56] mind because they wasn't born and
[1:39:58] conscious of the royalty they have to be
[1:40:01] taught into it they have to be grown
[1:40:02] into it and you cannot be groomed into a
[1:40:05] wrong impression of a holy nation a
[1:40:08] peculiar people
[1:40:10] Oh God hallelujah Lord give the Lord a
[1:40:14] shout thank you Lord Jesus hallelujah so
[1:40:18] you did so the royalty did not like
[1:40:20] commoners the call us people commoners
[1:40:22] and you are not commoners you are
[1:40:25] attributes sons of his spirit and what
[1:40:28] butcher until unturned under tutors and
[1:40:30] governors until the time appointed by
[1:40:32] the father so when Jesus rose from the
[1:40:34] dead he opened up the word open the
[1:40:36] understanding that disciples are royalty
[1:40:39] and they are going to receive power
[1:40:41] because the kingdom is not in word but
[1:40:44] in power spray is called but I have good
[1:40:47] news for you tonight the kingdom is
[1:40:49] preached and every man press their way
[1:40:55] into it so if you realize is not about
[1:40:58] church not about church now church is
[1:41:00] over when the kingdom come the church is
[1:41:04] over our Father who art in heaven
[1:41:06] hallowed be thy name
[1:41:07] die please God Hebrews 12:28 wherefore
[1:41:15] we receive a kingdom which cannot be
[1:41:17] moved let us have grace that we miss if
[1:41:19] what acceptable with godly fear oh
[1:41:22] praise God hallelujah so all what I said
[1:41:25] before no he's a backdrop of what I want
[1:41:28] reach Oh hallelujah we talked about King
[1:41:31] we talk what Kingdom we talk what to
[1:41:32] mean we need topper church we only talk
[1:41:38] about kingdom repent for the kingdom of
[1:41:41] God is at hand Jesus taught what my
[1:41:44] kingdom is not of this world or glory of
[1:41:46] God in my kingdom was of this well my
[1:41:49] men would fight for me then the
[1:41:51] scripture when Allah said that the
[1:41:52] kingdom is not in word but in power so
[1:41:56] the kingdom have to come the Bible said
[1:41:59] he came unto his own and his own
[1:42:01] received him not but as many as received
[1:42:03] him to them he gave power to become the
[1:42:07] sons of God did not commit sons of God
[1:42:10] by some codes you have to get sons of
[1:42:12] God by power power has to come but we
[1:42:15] have a promise in acts 1:8 you shall
[1:42:17] receive power after the Holy Ghost comes
[1:42:21] upon you so all of these have scriptures
[1:42:24] all of this is the world do believe it
[1:42:26] tonight
[1:42:27] glory to God from why are people so
[1:42:30] toast about what a Branham the Bible
[1:42:32] said our last days there come a famine
[1:42:34] upon the earth not for bread and water
[1:42:37] alone but for hearing the truth of God
[1:42:40] now we are more books than ever more
[1:42:42] tense than ever more babies than ever
[1:42:44] more reasonable in the famine and that
[1:42:46] famine is on that famine is all tonight
[1:42:49] a real falen
[1:42:51] because it means that the gospel has to
[1:42:54] be tuned in didn't come like a bunny
[1:42:56] radio you get a kindly put them on their
[1:42:59] stations it's not what kind of stations
[1:43:01] you could go in all kind of music all
[1:43:03] kind of things but you have to get the
[1:43:04] right tune the right station right the
[1:43:07] gospel to feed you
[1:43:08] it has to be on the right station
[1:43:09] there'll be a family last days but that
[1:43:12] bride will not be not Fernando that
[1:43:15] Prime is season on the hidden mysteries
[1:43:17] that was revealed by Malachi for
[1:43:19] bringing listen listen all these hidden
[1:43:21] mysteries mysteries that people was a
[1:43:26] fee like auntie mysteries because I
[1:43:29] think they're talking too much about
[1:43:30] this mystery you know I just get
[1:43:34] problems when people talk to some other
[1:43:35] mysteries and their life is a mystery
[1:43:37] because you see Christ is the mystery of
[1:43:39] God revealed because when they convert
[1:43:41] the mysteries have to come into a life
[1:43:43] oh all this God was so mysterious why my
[1:43:47] god listen Brahm say God was so
[1:43:49] mysterious you wanted to read is
[1:43:51] bulletin Oh myself it's not that good
[1:43:54] but won't reveal himself how do i I was
[1:43:58] coughing time-space before there was a
[1:44:00] moon myself too so he's pushing to
[1:44:07] unveil his attributes unveil his torch
[1:44:10] he's so mysterious and when God come
[1:44:12] down now the word became flesh in Jesus
[1:44:16] all the mystery when God translate that
[1:44:19] is a man multiplying by the fish is a
[1:44:23] man walking on water a man's in little
[1:44:26] lady a rice get off a man say Lazarus
[1:44:28] come forth like the mystery of God
[1:44:30] people folded I'm a little beard
[1:44:35] that's what quit mistreated so all these
[1:44:40] mysteries and mysteries and mistreated
[1:44:44] because on the other side we talk about
[1:44:47] vials and trumpets and woes and one
[1:44:48] every Sun and the moon and different
[1:44:50] things on Danielle goes book no we will
[1:44:52] meet up mother
[1:44:53] it'll be translated the word
[1:44:56] so all these mysteries and we're gonna
[1:44:59] get it then I have it every tomorrow
[1:45:00] Barham says up in a prayer he said on
[1:45:03] all these mysteries the purpose of the
[1:45:06] message was to see the plainness of God
[1:45:08] that we might know how to conduct
[1:45:10] ourselves in this world we are living in
[1:45:12] that was the coat but one says that we
[1:45:15] might know the penis of God in other
[1:45:17] words the unfallen mish mysteries ain't
[1:45:20] nothing to get a head like a head bag
[1:45:22] your head because you know a lot of
[1:45:26] stuff then fall any mysteries is that
[1:45:29] you will see the penis of course and
[1:45:32] that will show you how to give yourself
[1:45:35] to come back to behavior
[1:45:38] so therefore adoption is not based upon
[1:45:40] a man Ceylon adoption is never being
[1:45:43] based upon a man's teaching adoption
[1:45:45] gonna be peace upon the man's behavior I
[1:45:48] call it the right kind of a son whatever
[1:45:50] can decide rascal sons political sons
[1:45:53] mean sons angry son bastard sons but you

[1:49:21] Warren Paul what a mom said the Bible
[1:49:24] said they were coming last a famine
[1:49:25] nothing better alone but what we always
[1:49:28] hear when men listen when men are
[1:49:31] putting themselves up like gods and
[1:49:34] wanted to be glorified and people say
[1:49:36] doctor so on so big so and so Paul said
[1:49:39] I have one fear that is except you would
[1:49:41] try to worship me all of the ting that
[1:49:44] I'm preaching I never come to you listen
[1:49:47] within chanting words of man's wisdom
[1:49:48] but in the power of the resurrection of
[1:49:52] Jesus Christ that your hopes be built on
[1:49:54] that so the reason I didn't bring it in
[1:49:57] all this unfolding things he bringing
[1:49:59] them pour reveal it and what he bringing
[1:50:02] it back if it could be in court
[1:50:03] Oh hallelujah praise God but a Branham I

[1:50:09] days I understand every nation against
[1:50:11] nation I understand to be tighter with
[1:50:13] her last days fear first time perplexity
[1:50:16] I understand more about the here in the
[1:50:17] last days I understand they were went
[1:50:19] short I understand that the preachers
[1:50:21] will be false shepherds in the last days
[1:50:23] that will compromise I will not feed the
[1:50:26] people the Word of God but we watch the
[1:50:27] quizon things and said I understand
[1:50:29] there's a voice coming the last days
[1:50:31] crying get the people back to the
[1:50:33] original message
[1:50:34] look the prophet go on are we still
[1:50:36] fighting to get to go back to the
[1:50:37] original message not an interpretation
[1:50:38] of the message they said the spirit the
[1:50:41] bragging of prophet will say the same
[1:50:42] thing so as long as I'm preaching on the
[1:50:44] Prophet said that's the word Oh

[1:51:08] to this part but the churches will be so
[1:51:10] organized and tightened that they will
[1:51:13] fail to hear it because the pastor's

[1:51:21] there and the people can hear the
[1:51:24] Liberty and the gospel of the kingdom to

[1:58:35] listen the Pentecostals should have been
[1:58:37] in one meeting rapture but the
[1:58:39] Pentecostal turn on the word we're gonna
[1:58:41] work on that prefer to reject the
[1:58:42] prophet the word is to pull you into the
[1:58:44] word image because God is spirit is
[1:58:47] using the conductor of the world
[1:58:49] not men what put the word in men and use
[1:58:54] the word in men do you get that the
[1:58:58] Pentecostal happy anointing
[1:59:00] they had strains and one of the miracles
[1:59:02] but they failed and adultery and all
[1:59:04] kind of crazy life of the nagas still a
[1:59:06] sign the wonders
[1:59:08] but God bought the program in the world
[1:59:09] and the world as a producer actor
[1:59:12] interacting with a gift
[1:59:13] Tarak taste of victory what you to pass
[1:59:20] to hell because Emma's on the earth
[1:59:23] that's why you hear the earth you're

[1:59:37] of the bride the bride coming into
[1:59:39] preview we saw the first bride and then
[1:59:41] he saw the church hitches

[1:59:51] nothing you say God but here come the
[1:59:53] bride again the first pregnant last by
[1:59:55] the same right because the early church
[1:59:57] people coalition Ephesians are getting
[2:00:00] optimal if these are the hidden mystery
[2:00:02] because Bible talk of the loud easier
[2:00:05] just allow this year but God put a
[2:00:07] hidden thing that will come back tonight
[2:00:10] visions because bring them ran until now
[2:00:12] right back to the faith to the father's
[2:00:14] so we have to go back and pick up the
[2:00:15] faith and then come back here to go
[2:00:17] forward in the perfection we have to
[2:00:19] pick up the faith not pick up coats feet
[2:00:24] tips the feet that's what we fighting
[2:00:27] for all these years to come back to the
[2:00:29] feet

[2:03:01] are kings and priests offering spiritual
[2:03:03] sacrifices of God the fruits olives

[2:03:07] messiahs little anointed ones or praise
[2:03:10] the name of the Lord
[2:03:12] thank you lord so he was the Messiah
[2:03:14] which he was because he was anointed by
[2:03:16] the Holy Spirit and any church that's
[2:03:18] anointed by the same Holy Spirit is a
[2:03:19] messiah a little smaller God like small
[2:03:22] G and someday when this body is
[2:03:24] resurrected
[2:03:25] I hope beforehand that Court can get a
[2:03:27] hold of a bunch of people that will
[2:03:29] manifest his power in every dimension

[2:04:11] one event when he said no no no
[2:04:16] rhinoceros I was worrying about that man
[2:04:19] myself

[2:04:50] didn't crush his consciousness of his
[2:04:55] kingship

[2:05:33] [Applause]
[2:05:44] you have to be conscious that's why I
[2:05:47] love what God put not just forgiveness

[2:07:00] consciousness and he's the son of a king
[2:07:02] environment does not change who he is
[2:07:04] our environment does not change his
[2:07:06] behavior excuses oh god because of this
[2:07:11] dad
[2:07:12] that's why a coffin dr. Swire coffee
[2:07:16] I wasn't intended to do that you know
[2:07:20] but you see when you do that if doctors
[2:07:22] when I give it to him see that that's
[2:07:25] what we're talking about
[2:07:26] nice the environment that you blame the
[2:07:28] environment that you know I didn't want
[2:07:30] it rich and I didn't I didn't but he
[2:07:32] provoked me shouldn't have done that
[2:07:34] should not have done that but he did it
[2:07:36] honey bitty bites for doing it see but
[2:07:39] we have to go past that now that's right
[2:07:41] one of the child has speaking like a
[2:07:42] child on the strip like a child when I
[2:07:44] become a man I put away childish things
[2:07:47] like a tell the church and I love it God
[2:07:49] didn't make you higher than the animals
[2:07:51] he make you a little lower than the
[2:07:52] Angels you could live better than that
[2:07:54] you could live
[2:07:57] looser than that it makes you understand
[2:07:59] lower than the Angels Oh hallelujah
[2:08:01] Christ Oh glory to God a man supports
[2:08:05] Kingdom oh okay I'm almost you finish it
[2:08:07] finish it very good
[2:08:09] God's kingdom is not of this hood God's
[2:08:12] kingdom is in our hearts and Jesus said
[2:08:14] the kingdom of God cometh ago at the
[2:08:16] kingdom of God is within you I like that
[2:08:17] and you say one time he said when they
[2:08:19] say lo here don't go no no no go go go
[2:08:24] the kid mother is in you nobody fool you
[2:08:28] with the kingdom school kingdom so we
[2:08:29] all come to this church to get the
[2:08:30] kingdom
[2:08:31] good to dismantle his kingdom somebody
[2:08:33] else kingdom lock down one time and CID
[2:08:38] put the five SB keys our hotel have open
[2:08:44] the roof kids Mississippi love oh my I
[2:08:50] was there say oh honey bees but he in
[2:08:56] his bees oh wow is that the kingdom of
[2:09:01] God is within you
[2:09:02] now Christ is ahead of this Messiah
[2:09:05] kingdom and you cannot organize a
[2:09:08] kingdom of which Christ is the head
[2:09:11] you cannot be nominate kingdom which
[2:09:14] Christ because Christ is king and you
[2:09:17] cannot take the intellectuals of man and
[2:09:20] make an organization to which Christ
[2:09:22] will govern therefore any companies
[2:09:24] there we go
[2:09:25] any people any groups of men that tries
[2:09:28] to organize the kingdom of God is going
[2:09:31] contrary to the king if you're going
[2:09:33] contrary to the king it will be against
[2:09:35] the king just digress
[2:09:36] Barham say that's pretty rough if I just
[2:09:40] had a more voice we make it much clearer
[2:09:41] is an antichrist spirit tries to take
[2:09:45] the people and call them from
[2:09:46] organization to organization or when I
[2:09:48] have together which will never was the
[2:09:50] will of God people have always trusted
[2:09:52] me because I struck so hard I
[2:09:55] polarizations it isn't the people indeed
[2:09:58] I'm striking that it's that here we go
[2:10:00] it's that dominating spirit that makes
[2:10:03] the people take we are the people so
[2:10:07] they're conscious no they are so this
[2:10:14] kingdom is the mystical body and you're
[2:10:16] presented God's people is this call Lord
[2:10:19] people and I believe this they are in
[2:10:21] every denomination they could be
[2:10:23] Catholic there could be protests on
[2:10:24] there could be Jewish there could be any
[2:10:26] kind of church but the real church is
[2:10:28] the mystical body of Jesus Christ now
[2:10:30] you cannot organize the mystical body of
[2:10:33] Christ
[2:10:33] Oh hallelujah please God so I'm gonna
[2:10:37] skip down
[2:10:38] or praise God oh yes okay so they become
[2:10:41] full member of the body when they are
[2:10:42] filled with the Holy Ghost because God
[2:10:44] took the spirit of a Christ raised his
[2:10:46] body places on the throne send back the
[2:10:48] Holy Spirit to make up the mystical body

[2:10:53] body which will be United at the
[2:10:54] marriage supper or the coming of the
[2:10:56] Lord
[2:10:56] you cannot organize it it is a mystery
[2:10:59] and from one as he said know watch the
[2:11:01] kingdom of God is the word made power so
[2:11:04] that is why the foolish version will
[2:11:05] never get the oil because they think
[2:11:07] that the wood and the secret is what the
[2:11:11] wood is on the bride it has to be some
[2:11:13] faithful men giving the wood out not
[2:11:15] going into you and then that will turn
[2:11:18] it the power is the kingdom hallelujah
[2:11:21] watch that for the kingdom is preached
[2:11:24] Oh glory to God so first Corinthians
[2:11:28] 4:20 the kingdom of God is the word God
[2:11:30] would made power what is the kingdom of
[2:11:32] God is within you
[2:11:33] the kid knows within you and when the
[2:11:35] word comes in dear what does this would
[2:11:37] begin it turns itself into power oh
[2:11:40] praise God I'm persuaded that many of us
[2:11:43] friends I receive the Holy Ghost but we
[2:11:45] have received enough Holy Ghost stuff
[2:11:46] and to make us stop please we don't want
[2:11:48] to lie we don't want to steal we don't
[2:11:50] want to do anything but God wants to
[2:11:51] fill every fiber of his church he wants
[2:11:54] to fill your tinkin he was to fill your
[2:11:56] mind he want to feel you every bit just
[2:11:58] make you completely totally dead to
[2:12:00] yourself isn't that right who glory to
[2:12:03] God the power of his word what is the
[2:12:05] word what is the kingdom of God we got
[2:12:07] to belong to the kingdom before we can
[2:12:09] be subjects of the king oh God thank you

[2:12:18] first time they will come forth for the
[2:12:21] right age for a resurrection of DOC
[2:12:23] denominationalism
[2:12:23] will be a message and this is a prophecy
[2:12:26] that the full maturity of the wood has
[2:12:29] turned back again to its full power and
[2:12:32] being weaved over the people by the same
[2:12:34] sign that wonders so that means that

[2:12:55] any other headship but the word and the
[2:12:58] head is connected with the body and the
[2:12:59] head is the word and the same word one
[2:13:02] headship so the bride can have no
[2:13:03] headquarters anyway
