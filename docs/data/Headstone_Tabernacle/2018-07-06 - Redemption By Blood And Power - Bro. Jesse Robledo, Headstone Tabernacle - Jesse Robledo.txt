in this evening time you may be seated while I just greet you just a moment I have a habit of forgetting to seat the people and I just start talking but god bless you Trinidad and good evening amen it is indeed a great privilege and an honor to be here this evening to have fellowship with this portion of the bride of Jesus Christ amen God's people have come from the north from the south from the east and the West and the Eagles have flown in from everywhere because there's carcass here you know I trust that you've come hungry amen why come all this way and not eat huh praise God amen we're not here to be spectators we're here to be partakers hallelujah to the land raised this wonderful name so I am delighted to be back in Trinidad this evening and I just want to well I bring greetings from my wife and a church back in New York City the original faith Gospel Tabernacle we are in a little village in Long Island called Valley Stream somebody asked me some time ago well we have you been I said we've been just in the valley just having drinking as much water as we can Valley Stream is good down there Amen so we the Lord has been gracious to us I have no complaints I don't regret a mile amen the Lord is good we say in back in New York god is good all the time and all the time God is good no matter how you say it god is good hallelujah so I want to thank brother obut for this invitation I deem it a great privilege brother ovet it just mentioned we've been friends a long time we were young men when we first started in the field what and I appreciate brother Ovid traveling in the various parts of the world with our with my dear friend and there are some people that I won't get into I won't get into trouble but there are some people you go into filled with and they don't know why they're there and then there are others that go along in the field and they know exactly why they there and brother Theo he's a man of vision brother over is a man of vision a man with what I say there are no hidden agendas what you see is what you get and I like that kind of a man praise this wonderful name you know there's some people you meet in life and especially from certain parts of our country you know they take half an hour and they haven't gotten to the point yet and they're trying to say something to you in New York you know if you have to say it say it right there the first five minutes say it I can take it you know I like brother overt style he just lays it on the line and that's just my way of I like that kind of preacher so god bless you brother over thank you for the invitation and the lovely church that has to work so hard listen I have been on the other side of planning these conventions and things like that and I know how much planning and how much sacrifice people have to sacrifice their time their their finances and things to make this a reality but I just want to let you know that you've done a perfect job in making us feel comfortable thank you a man headstone Tabernacle we certainly appreciate you and greetings to the pastors and the ministers that have come from all over and visiting ministers tonight I greet you in a wonderful name of Jesus Christ and in case you don't know who I am I am brother Jesse Robledo and I am brother Coleman son-in-law the late brother Coleman son-in-law and I'm not ashamed of it amen because he's a great man of God and we'll find out after this message and the weekend that no matter what happens there is nothing more powerful than love nothing is more powerful than love love will defeat any problem any situation it will straighten the crooked ways it will well it's the total answer in just love and if you let the love of God come down I believe he will take care of the rest sometimes we try to do God's job he doesn't want us to do just wants us to let go on that God he'll take care of the rest amen so greetings to everyone online and wherever you come from and I just wanted to thank brother Chandler and brother Solomon for letting God use their gifts in a mighty way may God richly bless you the New Testament brother Chandler in my blood I love that you see because it had to be the death of the testator in order for the New Covenant to be to come into effect and that covenant is an effect tonight hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah he not only forget he's not only forgiven your sins but you've never did it in the first place hallelujah the Old Testament blood could cover a man but it could not destroy I like what brother Branham said but this this blood it not it breaks down the sin and and at the very end you have just little fragments of sin and it goes back to the original owner who made you do it and he has to pay for it amen he has to pay for it glory be to God because sin must be judged a man I didn't do it the devil praise God Oh hallelujah I'm not going to say the devil made me do it but you know we all have our shortcomings and we're not perfect I thank God for the blood of Jesus Christ in this hour amen I believe that's what this meeting is all about a man and brother Solomon amen the robe of perfection thank you brother Solomon God richly bless you my brother I really enjoy that message this this afternoon and I was telling for the obut in the room how impressed I was and the way our brother delivers the message and you know made me kind of feel old when he began to speak about years ago he when he first heard us you know and but it's so good to actually see these brothers and God called men come amen knowing that perhaps our time the Sun is setting you see but God will give us the strength to go on and to possess every promise that is before us amen there's much more land to possess amen so I'm not quitting yet no no no no no I'm not quitting yet I'm not over amen we have much more land to possess but we thank God for the young men praise God that is not ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ amen and we'll call sin sin right right wrong wrong and stand on the truth of this revealed word amen especially in this hour where it has become so confusing to so many but it's very simple this message doesn't change you know men changes people change but God does not change amen and we serve Jesus the same yesterday today and forever so therefore we're going to preach a message tonight that has been spoken about I'm sure by your pastor and brother branham you've heard you've heard the tapes and things these tapes don't get old you know no no no you they say the best wine is the old wine the one that's left in the cellar for a while and is blue blue busy fermenting and it's getting more and more powerful all the time you may have heard that message or read that message before but then you come back to it who was more powerful than it was when you a man first heard it a man that's just the way it is amen to me so therefore I am very passionate and will stand to our feet shortly I am very passionate about this theme of the meeting here to apply the token I hope that we can all get the revelation and understanding of what this means my friends when the token comes into view it was at the evening time in the evening time it was in effect and it didn't last long because after they apply the token Pharaoh not only let them go he kicked them out he had enough with these people called the Israelites so I want to speak on that subject tonight that the devil will will have enough of you where you know he doesn't have to let you go he's gonna say leave my presence hey man glory be to God because we don't know who we are yet but by God's grace we will find out let us stand to our feet amen so if God requires a token surely he's got to make a way for a man the Prophet said in desperation 1963 after the seals the token was the highlight message of his entire ministry so we're not just talking about something that we should make light of and after the seals a message is capped off by one thing the token the holy ghost this is what brother Graham said the holy ghost the token follows the blood all the way from the book of redemption the token Jesus Christ the Holy Spirit is among us we should reverence that so we're here to reverence amen the token the Holy Ghost amen and this is a showdown I truly believe with all my heart because we have heard messages quotes and scriptures and battles and what group were you in what denomination do you belongs what church you belong that means nothing do you have the token that's all that means amen so let us turn the stand as we turn to the book of Exodus and I'm sure you have read this before book of Exodus 12 and verse 11 through 13 and Joshua chapter 2 verses 17 through 21 let's see what the Lord will have us to speak on tonight and we pray that God will have his way my alarm clock is I am on the clock now so I just want to redeem the time Exodus chapter 12 and verse 11 and and thus saith and doth shall you eat with your loins girded your shoes on your feet and your staff in your hand and ye shall eat it in haste it is the Lord's Passover for I will pass through the land of Egypt this night and I will smite all the firstborn and in the land of Egypt both man and beast and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment I am the Lord and the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are and when I see the Blood I will pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when I smite the land of Egypt hallelujah these judgments are strictly for Egypt not for the called out church and we have a covenant that is a token to make sure that it is our place of safety Joshua chapter 2 Joshua chapter 2 let's start with verse 17 and the men said unto her we will be blameless of this dino 'the which thou has made us swear behold when we come into the land thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread on the window which thou did us let us down by and thou shalt bring thy father and thy mother and thy brethren and all thy father's household home unto thee and it shall be that whosoever shall go out of the door of the house into the street his blood shall be upon his head and we will be guiltless and whosoever shall be with thee and the house his blood shall be on our head if any hand be upon him and if thou utter this our business then we will be quit of thine oath which thou have made us to swear and she said according unto your word so be it and she sent them away and they departed as she bound the scarlet line in the window now the scarlet line was the sign that they would be looking for when they returned she couldn't hide it in in the house if she wanted to live she had to display it may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word let us have a word of Prayer our gracious Heavenly Father we are so thankful to be here tonight Lord and feel the anointing of the Holy Spirit Lord in the building and Lord we have been blessed already by brother Peter Chandler's message in brother Solomon's message father setting the tone and tonight I just feel just to speak a little bit on what is fixing to take place and we don't approach this with fear we approach this with faith believing their God that the God who requires the token is also there to provide it as well and father what a time because the token means it's not simply judgment in Egypt it means that we are leaving it means that our days of bondage is over it means that we're going over to the promised land it means also that the Egyptians and taskmasters that Oh for over 400 years have taught us that we're nothing but slaves and mud dobbers we have a greater revelation that we are children of God we are the called of God hallelujah and the Phyllis rather the Egyptians and the enemy we will see them no more amen because we will be driven out dear god and led by a mighty hand father so I pray dear God that you would bless your people tonight bless the word and may the spirit follow the word dear God to anoint it Lord to the hearts of the people we ask it in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen god bless you you may be seated let's give the Lord a hand the phrase [Applause] amen hallelujah so I don't want to be too long with you tonight I know we've had three services today and I just want to get right to the message the title of my message tonight if I would redemption by blood and by power Redemption by blood and by power we know that without blood there is really no redemption amen Redemption means to bring back to original fallen state to restore a person to his original state and you must Redemption brother Graham set is in two parts is a coming out of and a going in two so if when we're talking about an exodus we're talking about it coming out oh and a going in two so therefore God will not pull you out unless he has somewhere to put you in so therefore we are sure a man that God has better places and things for us a Mendez promised but I want to start off with this just to leave a little thought in your mind food for thought as it were and we could just look at it examine it and see how the Lord will well use it on October the 14th in 1962 brother Branham preached a message the statue of a perfect man very powerful message everybody was interested in coming becoming that perfect man that brother Branham was speaking about and yet today what Christian does not want to be perfect everybody wants to be perfect we're striving for perfection and yet I remember when brother Coleman told me years ago that after brother Branham preached that message statue a perfect man there were many that went out and were a little confused as to how to apply the virtues and so therefore brother Coleman said there was preachers that he knows if they were preaching well all you need to take his seven deep breaths now you have faith now you have virtue you see how the intellectual mind will will make something spiritual at a very natural thing and it had nothing to do with anything so but if you notice that three weeks later brother Branham no doubt having heard of this on November the fourth 1962 the Prophet came back and spoke a message on blasphemous names and if you notice on that message brother Branham he begins to really clarify how to add and what it is to add to your faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness and actually it's as clear and yet a revelation is needed you see because the Prophet will make it clear to a certain point but it yes needs to be revealed to the individual so therefore so you'll understand but in this clarification that he come he brought with him sister scheppers dream he brought with him sister scheppers dream and he began to explain certain things about sister scheppers dream and we I'm not going to get into the whole thing but the reason why sister Shepherd was so disturbed after hearing the message statue of a perfect man is that after hearing that she had a question in her heart whether she really had the Holy Ghost so I want to just drop this off here because I cannot tell anybody you have the holy girls this one don't have it but I can tell you one thing that God can only build his structure on the Holy Ghost not a sensation Amen not goosebumps whatever because brother Branham said add to your faith not at faith but add to your faith and he types out the Holy Ghost as being faith the foundation that's the foundation hallelujah because God is not going to build his building on our emotions he's not going to build it on a church he's not going to build it on a man he's gonna build it on himself hallelujah glory be to God so the foundation must be there amen he is not only the cornerstone but the stone which the builders has refused have become the head of the corner glory be to God and that is why I will say this and this is why the problems you have today and we all have today we see people's and works are crumbling and everything but I'm going to tell you something God's work can never crumble Oh God's work works God's building will stand the test of time glory be to God because he builds it upon himself and heaven and earth will pass away but my word the foundation will never pass away lower beats are God's say him as somebody hallelujah there shall be the manifestation of the sons of God a man standing on it earth a man manifesting and displaying all these of virtues praise God but now but that's why brother Branham said we have to be born and positionally born hey man hallelujah born and positionally born glory be to God the Holy Ghost you must be born again we cannot even God can't even build upon us until we are born again glory be to God because it won't hold the weight of the building amen hallelujah praise this wonderful name so amen so we realize that the Holy Ghost is faith on the bottom the foundation so amen so it behooves us to ask well and and and take inventory to see if we do have the same if we have the Holy Ghost and what it takes to hold this building because I've seen so many buildings crash and works crash and well God knows and he will certainly take care of those things so therefore but now let us get into our subject tonight because I want to begin to for the young people especially excuse me I'm a slow starter a man I want to for the young people who have not heard or you probably heard token message I'm sure but I want to get on a level where you would understand I like that because I'm not here to preach great mysteries and whatever everybody ministers according to their measure of faith but as we know that in the natural we realize Israel left the land the promised land Jacob because there was a famine in the land and if you could only understand that all things work together for good to them that love God and to them that are called according to his purpose now Joseph he had a dream he was a spiritual man he was a a prophet quite frankly and God had already revealed to him his destiny he shared with the other brothers who were short-sighted who didn't share that vision so Joseph had to stand alone on this vision and his destiny and he began to share with the brothers a man that one day Wow I dreamt this that you know you're gonna bow before me your sheaves and everything else and and they got mad because I mean who how dare you how dare you you know and sometimes you know you begin to speak spiritual things and it's just all of a sudden people just they get a it's a spirits you know they just dislike you but it's okay because Joseph knew where he stood you see that's fine so now here's here's what I want to say now Joseph in order for him for his destiny to be fulfilled he had to be sold to Egypt [Music] understand that God's in the program this is that there is no oops with God you may think oh my god why am I in this and why and why this and why that go where you're just a few steps closer to where God wants you to be hallelujah glory be to God amen because God had a plan for Joseph a man that he would be a ruler in Egypt amen he will be second-in-command a man he had gone from prison he was going to be placed into power but before he could be placed into power he had to learn Amon how to be a servant he had to learn how to forgive he had to learn how a new you how to have the character of Jesus Christ amen because power amen I am a character without power I mean a power the character is satanic rather so we know God working on your character a man that's a tough part but God is working every day right now he's working on your character glory be to God man Oh hallelujah so we know then he was then sold into Egypt which got him a little closer to Pharaoh he never knew Pharaoh but God had predestinated him before the foundation were to be Pharaohs right-hand man okay so he got a job with the Potiphar who was well he knew Pharaoh he knew who failure was but of course he was interrupted by his wife's should I say weaknesses and Joseph was accused for doing nothing and I've often said Annie if anyone had a reason to kind of figure out try to figure out Laura why it was Joseph because Joseph he tried to do everything well he tried to do everything right but it so happens that everything that he when he would do right evil was always present we all know that but he ended up in jail he was getting a little closer to the throne in that jail you mean to tell me my trial my tribulation I am in trees I'm getting a little closer to the pro yes Laura beats our God because if it had not been a man his time in jail he would have never met that Butler he would have never met the Baker who was in contact with payroll Oh hallelujah God knows how to do it don't try to figure him out a man God has taken you a little step closer praise be to God I'm feeling good now because of what steps of the righteous has ordered of the Lord glory be to God amen amen so therefore of course Joseph told Amen de Bakker please remember a rather the butler please remember me when you go back amen you restore to Pharaoh and remember me he forgot what I'm gonna tell you something it was because I and I believe with all my heart Joseph was not ready he wasn't ready he needed a little more molding down and breaking off b'man he wasn't ready for power he had to wait until God knew that he was ready and when God saw that he was ready here comes the core Joseph Peres wants to see you oh hey man don't worry that call is coming praise God God will say here's my spirit flowing freely over here here's another one over there here's another one over there this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased praise God God has got to see it nobody else hey man hallelujah hey man I love that praise God I love that don't ever think that something has gone wrong in your life if your name isn't a Lamb's Book of Life don't worry he may take you this way he may take you that way you may not understand what is going on in your life but at the end of it all you'll come to the place where he wants you to be hallelujah glory be to God because we are the people of God Amen hallelujah hallelujah so then of course he remembered when Pharaoh had to have the dream that nobody could interpret but of course then he remember oh yeah you know the Baker the Butler said I forgot I forgot a please forgive me but there is a man down no he's not he's not in a for he's down he's down in a dungeon he's closed God put him there to be close to be within the core the range of the core to come a man could you imagine Joseph coming up to the to Pharaoh and telling him exactly amen what was going to take place for the next seven years 14 years and so forth and and Joseph was saying what you need to do is get a man that is wise and follow the Holy Ghost and knows how to do something and Pharaoh is looking at him my god you are that man what are you talking about go find a man I see a man hey man hallelujah I see a man praise God a man he didn't ally you had the job there was the interview you got the job glory be to God but now let's go back a moment because then we realize that that was in the times that was times of Pharaoh and Joseph and thing but they came of time where this Pharaoh knew not Joseph that was where the problem began not for the children of Israel but for Pharaoh I'm gonna put it in place I'm gonna I'm gonna flip the tables over now hey man I mean we can deal with the trials because God has taken through us through all kinds of trials and tribulations he takes care of us but oh when somebody don't know your God he's in trouble if somebody don't know the power of your God he's in trouble hallelujah if somebody know don't know the right hand of Almighty God he's in trouble hey man hallelujah to the lamb glory be to God hey man as Pharaoh was was in trouble from the very beginning amen so now let's look at things I want you to see the patients that we nut must have now we realize that God told Abraham nothing was was by surprise God told Abraham that his seed would be in bondage he said it no surprise it was in the word it wasn't in everybody know it he was in the scripture you see his seed would be in bondage but after 400 years they were come out with a strong and mighty head so it means that the time of bondage had a time limit Oh hallelujah and that time limit had to be fulfilled but when we read here now when Abraham we just read it at Genesis 15 and he said unto Abram know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in the land that is not not there see and shall serve them and they shall afflict them 400 years 400 years he already told Abram was going to happen and also that nation listen here's the other part of the also that nation whom they shall serve I will George and afterwards they shall come out with a great substance but now we read now also in Exodus chapter 12 and verse 40 that it a treasonous wise now the sojourning of the children of Israel who dwelt in Egypt was 430 God told Abraham 400 but the total time of their bondage was 434 God is a is a God of mercy and he's long-suffering so don't ever think that God is late God is on time don't worry about it because until the last predestinated seat of God comes in God will hold that Exodus until the last predestinated seat of God but now listen God was on time but Moses disappeared for 40 years he was running around running away from the Commission listen if God tells you to do something you might as well give up and do it because guess what he's not looking for somebody else he won't find you he will track you down and he won't have you do it because you are his man glory be to God hallelujah God's not saying ok if you don't want to do it I'll find somebody else to do it amen amen he was born to be a prophet [Applause] Amen hallelujah amen glory be to God didn't God tell Jeremiah a man before you were formed in your mother's womb I knew you and ordained you to be a prophet to the nation's a man a man while you were in your mother's womb God had a predestinated seed in your heart to do exactly what you're doing here today and what you're going to do in the future in other words your future in God is already history did you hear what I'm saying amen so now they were sojourning the children of Israel was sojourning in the land of Egypt amen and you can be seated so therefore we see this that they had come down and they in the time of Joseph they settled in the land of Goshen now I want to make a distinction between Goshen and Egypt because Egypt is where Pharaoh was of course and this is where the covenant people was in Goshen the plagues that fell upon Egypt God put a wedge between Egypt and Goshen these are my people but I'm going to judge Egypt in a way that they have never been judged before secondly I want you to notice Pharaoh is the biggest liar you can find how many times did he say he would let them go so now you're dealing with a liar number two he's not gonna let you go easy if you understand that then we are we're on the same wavelength now right now because Pharaoh who did not know Joseph after while begin to teach the children of Israel that they were slaves and they after while believe that they were slave they loved the leeks and gun the onions in the world I don't I don't know i don't like leeks and whatever i can't talk to nobody after that him the leeks and onions in the world i mean it back in egypt but now listen here here is what i want to say to you there was Goshen and then there was a but in the land of Goshen where the promises of God they were a covenant people under what covenant it was a covenant of circumcision they were the children of Abraham and Abraham was given a covenant and he received the sign of circumcision and every child that he had from generation to generation had to be circumcised and God honored them and that identified them as a cold out people or as a separated people and God treated them like that a man so therefore we realize that when the plagues fell nine of the plates the Covenant was in effect nine of the plagues the Covenant God honored to cover but on a tenth flake it was a war between life and death so therefore you had to have a type of life and life always defeats death this is why the life of the Lamb you have to be identified with the land that you slit that you slew now just to make this as easy as I can people can say well I have the blood I killed the lamb I do this I but I don't know it's gonna mess up my house you know I mean I did have a fresh paint job on the outside and I don't want to be all messy okay go right ahead and do it go right ahead and do it but my point is this obedience because they're very specific instructions that night if you wanted to live you had to follow instructions clear instructions and full obedience to the word what entitles you to the token so it doesn't matter if you were in message Church it doesn't matter if you were okay you can show your seal of circumcision and so forth that wasn't in effect that night when I know brother song so it wasn't in effect that night hallelujah well I could show you I have a man I'm very I've been a staunch to ever since I like a man my daddy was a priest and whatever it meant nothing that night Oh hallelujah [Applause] what you see we realized that Israel was pushed into we realize the land of Egypt when they left the land of Canaan it was a it was a national force it was a famine in the land so they had to go in but they did not know Joseph the Pharaoh knew not Joseph but God honored them in the seal of circumcision rather into flesh for 400 years I want to say this for 400 years they cried and cried and cried and meanwhile God was recording every prayer every single prayer that was ever uttered God was recording it because when he come down and told Moses I've heard the cries of my people 430 years worth of cries Pharaoh had taught them already that they were mud dobbers and that's they you know you can't accept the norm what the devil wants you to believe is normal you living as a slave is not normal young people if you live below your privileges this is not normal you've got to understand that greater is He that's in you than he that's in the world and if you act like a slave live like a slave and sleep like a slave after why you're gonna believe that you are a slave and you wake up early in the morning with a routine and you just make Pharaoh cities and so forth and he's happy stay a slave but because this is what they were taught oh but here comes Moses amen now listen God was fixing to redeem his people now the reason I chose this text or this title was redemption by blood and by power there can be no redemption without blood you all know that but the necessity of power was needed because fara was a hardhead God had redeemed his people by telling them and instructing them to slay a lamb and they had to be identified with the lamb a man and put the blood on the doorpost because it was coming in Death Angel now I'm going to say this that you that revelation had to be followed word by word by word by words those instructions you couldn't know you couldn't go out that night and say well death angel I am the Holy Ghost it wouldn't have worked you're as good as a dead man I am the token really okay show me the token I don't I don't want to hear whether oh you have it or so is in your pocket show it to me and when I see the Blood I pass over you or it beats our God there's so many people that talk and talk and talk and talk Oh bless God I have the Holy Ghost I have the Holy Ghost and there is no life let me start preaching here tonight amen there is no life they want to kill you they hate you there all kinds of bitterness in the heart amen they run you down where is the love now is come down to the love we must love one another [Applause] we must act like Christ be like Christ talk like Christ nor because glory be to God hey man no one beats our God hallelujah so therefore now notice I'm gonna I have a few minutes left but I'm trying to keep it short now let's look at the plagues down in a Goshen God had provided a man a prophet for the exodus of his people thank God for the prophet that has covered whenever a prophet comes on the scene especially the prophet of this last days you know that there is an exodus coming and not only that if the things are going to get worse and worse and worse and worse and worse and guess what Satan is gonna make your life miserable he's gonna make your life miserable and he's not gonna let you go Oh devil why are you I thought I was he's not gonna let you go you know why he's a liar [Music] today you shout and glorify God hallelujah and the devil tells you tonight oh I'm gonna let you go and tomorrow he has you again amen oh I overcome this habit a man okay I'll let you go and tomorrow he has you right back where he was because he is a liar and the only thing that will break the devil's power is a power of Almighty God Redemption by power glory be to God amen but don't think it's strange because God has hardened Pharaoh's heart God so desired to have him hardened in such a way that he won't let you go you know why because God has a plan for for Pharaoh he does he does now listen listen if he had let the children of Israel go in the third plague 4th plague whatever okay they would have gone and they would have you know but God wouldn't feel that the job was done he had bigger plans he had bigger plans for Pharaoh and he was gonna entrap him in his own plan he was gonna entrap him in his own hardness of his heart but now let's look let's look at Egypt and let's look at Goshen let's go are you are you with me okay young people are you with me I hope your understanding is because I just want to bring it down to your level so you'll understand so now God has provided our Goshen and as in Egypt as well and the fight is always any man God will protect you and the plagues will not come nigh your dwelling as long as you are in Goshen if you hang around in Egypt well you're on your own the Covenant was in effect in Goshen Amen because when the plagues had come down and Moses had to ask nine times thus saith the Lord let my people go oh but this time he come within his enforcer see Moses words he could speak it but it had to be made manifested to make sure that he Pharaoh knew and of course the Egyptian magicians could imitate us a few but it came a time they couldn't imitate this no impersonation there's coming a time they're not going to look the life cannot be impersonated you either have it or you don't you either have the life or you don't and it is the life behind the name that makes the demons tremble [Applause] glory be to God but now listen you can be seated what was his message thus say the Lord and let my people go and brother and the Bible says that his people see was also considered God's Son son was Israel so Pharaoh was holding his son now that's more personal now uh if your son is bound and being kept captive somewhere as a father oh you're gonna do everything you can as a father and it's a shame that this this man who's doing the kidnapping or holding them back though know the god of Joseph you don't know what I can do hallelujah so therefore the enforcer was with him so young people understand never think that this way is going to be easy it's impossible it's gonna get harder and harder and harder you know why because that God has hardened Pharaoh's heart but you're coming out now you're coming out he's gonna make you make bricks without straw but you're coming out he's gonna put the pressure on you in such a way you don't know where you're coming or going but you're coming out you're coming out hallelujah you're coming out glory be to God you're coming out now listen Gloria so now let's look at the place for nine plagues it was a plague of water it was turned to blood and I would imagine the water utility company down in Egypt they could not figure this out this is beyond our ability to the water failed all of a sudden frogs come down only because Pharaoh hardened his heart frogs come down lice and gnats and flies and livestock Boyle's diseases the CDC was going crazy never seen these cases before no answer why you can't figure out god hail hail come down like never before the weather forecasts in Egypt the forecasters were baffled they'd never seen such hail but in Goshen so here's what I want to say wow the plagues are falling there is no reason you can't praise God if you are in Goshen don't worry about the world you are in Goshen no repeater God hallelujah did you read the paper this is what happened to Joe I read it but Frank Peter God he has kept me there has been no hail there have been no plagues God will take care of his own don't worry about it no way be to God a many many man glory glory no damage to their crops no damage amen to their livestock and everything else because God honored the covenant of circumcision but now let's get down to the tenth plague which I believe this is the reason why we have gathered tonight under the solemn nosov this moment because there is something that is now required of everybody both Goshen and Egypt God the wedge is no longer there because God demanded a token and he made a way and this is all in type you know he made a way for the deliverance of his children and it was through the blood sacrifice of a lamb that was without blemish watch what kind of thing you offer to God it has to be without blemish just don't throw any lamb on there it has to be without blemish it has to be your very best or don't put it don't offer it at all hallow your very best don't offer it at all Amen but you see and it was the you aid it a very specific instruction and had a with fire and bitter herbs and everything else and guess what also he told them to eat it with your shoes on eat it in a hurry you know why I'm gonna tell you why because God knew that this plague Pharaoh wasn't gonna let you go he was gonna run you out of each other but because he couldn't take you no more and you had better be able to run you had better be able to walk eat it in haste glory be to God because let me tell you something between the tenth and the last plague of death and the Exodus there wasn't much time it won't last long but it will be here Oh hallelujah it won't last long amen is a token display nor would be to God the last plague was a man the plague of death and the token is the Holy Ghost today amen now let me just show you something that I brought with me because amen I hope I'm not boring you but you may be seated just a second just want you to understand this now you see this here I I brought this with me I had an actual coin back home of my own but since I moved I have it in a box somewhere and I couldn't find my my coin but this here is a New York City Transit coin it's a token that's what it is okay it's not money it's a token now this the way this worked years ago now you could have had all the money in the world but it wouldn't get you on the train there was a procedure you had to take the money that you had and this was a cost and you had to take it to the token clerk and a token clerk will examine your money make sure it's not counterfeit make sure it's enough and he would in turn give you a token which qualified you to ride the train now this token was a little smaller than a quarter or you know 25 cents and of course bigger than ten cents it was made a certain dimensions where only the Machine only this dimension can fit in the machine and when you drop the token in the slot and it went through his mechanism and so forth and if it fit if you dropped a quarter wouldn't fit it geez get jammed so when it fit and it reached down to trip a switch and then it releases the turns you go through you were through you got over to the other side you couldn't buy a token on the train you had to go to the token booth so so today the blood you see brother branham said today the Holy Spirit the Holy Ghost is the token and you've got to take the blood and present it to the token clerk to make sure you've done it correctly and he in turn gives you the Holy Ghost which in turns gives you the right a meant to ride a train and you wouldn't buy a token unless you are traveling somewhere I know where I'm going hey you there be no need to buy a token unless you're traveling somewhere I'm going home on the morning train Oh hallelujah listen there's going to be a rapture amen and all this forgery and all these different things that we hear today and I am this and I am that and surely if there's going to be a rapture I am gonna be in it amen and everyone else is not listen that is a lie because the only thing that will make it in the rapture amen if you have the token don't tell me you are the token don't tell me you are the Holy Ghost don't tell me Oh bless God I belong to a certain church that qualifies me to get on the train that don't qualifies you to get anywhere but do you have the token you already took aha hey man okay years ago years later I'm just I'm gonna get back to something years later we're not this dystopian was when I was a little kid you know and I have to confess you know confess is confession is good because I can confess to the people that love me and they forgive me half the times I didn't have the money for for token so I would I would jump the turnstile I'm forgiven but it had to be done a certain way the Train had to be there if the Train wasn't there you couldn't jump the turnstile they're gonna catch you you know you time it the train comes into the station that you jump the turnstile you get in then you ride and you feel convicted later but but there won't be no no jumping the turnstile this way they will not be no jumping a term staff and when I was working for IBM years ago and I they change his whole system it was no longer talking it was a what to call Metro pass and you bought a Monthly Pass and it was a little different because you had to have the pass on you at all times if you got on that train you had to have the pass now you could know the conductor or the ticket collector your best friend but when he comes down the aisle he's gonna ask you where's your ticket so you see there is no favoritism or there's no friendship or that he has to do his job I don't care how mad you you you get and said yeah I have it it's in my pocket it doesn't belong in your pocket let me see the ticket well I showed it to you yesterday don't you remember let me see your ticket today and I remember the voice that would boom out through the the train carts and says the ticket you know collect or whatever he would say Oh tickets please tickets please everybody ticket and there were times I didn't have it I left it at home and I'm I'm having my battles I'm thinking whoa what am I gonna tell him guess what I paid every time if you leave your token or if you leave your ticket you will pay so the truth is this it's what I'm saying don't ever leave the house without the total because you will pay you will pay so therefore in the land of Egypt there was great plagues but I'm going to tell you something one powerful plague that had come finally in the land of Egypt is as a judgment and plague of darkness for three days they couldn't even look at one another they couldn't see one another the utility grid went no power but in Goshen there was light in Goshen and don't you ever think I'm just gonna say this you're here tonight because of the grace of Almighty God you may sit there tonight and say well God has not done anything for me that's a devil's lie the point that you're here tonight shows that he's been with you oh but I don't I don't have everything that I want from God God has been with you God promised to provide your needs according to your riches and his riches in glory not your once we want a lot of things and we don't get what we want and we're upset but I'm gonna tell you something our God has been never ever forget to thank God for the little things and everything because it's His grace that you are here and he has kept you this far brother Ovid had talked about we know knowing each other 35 years I'm wondering where did the time go you can't plan that he's been with you and times when you thought you're gonna give up and you God he lifts you up and these are the things you have to thank on tour I'm gonna tell you something I like what brother Branham says about a righteous man can I say it he said a righteous man is not a sinless man but he's a man that knows how to get right with God he knows how to get right with God and David was a man after God's own heart and David murdered and he committed adultery and everything else but he was a man after God's own heart and that's a great mystery you know I'm going to tell you something because there's a lot of people oh if they only would make right with God then it's all over a man you get right with God you want to be you know on speaking terms with God but now listen the token clerk he had to check out the money and so forth amen but now if you look notice here how I don't know if you can see it good for one fair good good for one fair now I think the natural speaks of the spiritual as well now the Holy Ghost you cannot ride Your Mama's experience you cannot ride your papa's experience the Holy Ghost experience is an individual experience your mama has to have it your sister has to have it your brother has to have it Amen your uncle tutu has to have it everyone has to have it Amen because it's good for one fair hey man you can't rest on your mama's goodness or your father's goodness oh my father's our deacon whatever it doesn't matter do you have the token do you have the token and if you haven't taken out of your pocket and show it because it has to be displayed now I'm gonna get to another part here amen the token displaying many you see many people all bless God I have the Holy Ghost amen in church they're happy they go to school if in the pocket ain't nobody know what they are you you you go to work and nobody knows who you are I mean it you go to you go to pray for the food because you don't want to feel out of place you know you want to be accepted that's the natural mind you see that's the natural human spirit you hide the token or you hide whatever I'm gonna tell you something once you get the Holy Ghost I doubt very much if you hide it you want everybody to know hallelujah you're so on fire for God hey man there's not a devil that can keep you silent a man now we're gonna find out amen and here's the question I have and I don't want to you know cause any waves and so forth but I'm gonna tell you something God doesn't give the Holy Ghost to take it from you I'm gonna say it now can I say it God doesn't give you the Holy Ghost to take it from you so many people I've heard over the years I mean Oh bless God I have the Holy Ghost and so and they're nowhere to be found today something is wrong with this picture because my Bible says Amen that you are sealed until the day of your Redemption breathe not the Holy Spirit of God whereby we're sealed until the day of redemption you can see that man thirty years from now he'll still be the same man he still had the same fire he still be the same person he's still serving God glory be to God hallelujah [Applause] amen amen glory beats our God and many people have forgotten the life you know the life the life the life you don't they don't touch that no more they don't even touch the baptism of the Holy Ghost no more they'd rather say you have it already you are it that is the highest form of intellectualism I want you to tell the Death Angel I am it see how far you get listen I'm trying to get I'm trying to be straight up and now Amen that hour is late and we must have the real thing and if this structure was built on the correct foundation that's why brother Branham came back on blasphemous names and made sure that he identified the foundation part as the Holy Ghost because only the Holy Ghost can hold this body work word hallelujah it is the cornerstone and now we are at the headstone and the stone which the builders have refused down here has become the headstone of the corner there is no way to ignore it there is no way you have to have the Holy Ghost Oh hallelujah glory glory glory amen but now listen I have ten minutes are you still with me amen this is to our young people just want to make sure you understand because you know God this was an ordinance that was born in Egypt now this was a feast the Passover because God wanted to do something as a memorial to demonstrate his power and for them to put it in a book that when their children would ask what does this mean and what does that mean or what does this mean let him know what happened in Egypt let him know what a mighty God you serve and guess what down when Joshua just before us he just before he crossed over into the promised land those young people they were not circumcised yet and what happened they kept the Passover there just before crossing over to the promised land they had to circumcise a man the young people because they had not been circumcised in the wilderness and there they had feasts and they talked about amen the mighty God of Israel a man just before they went into the new land to encourage them amen what a mighty God they served lower it beats our God but now you can be seated now let's hurry very specific instructions the sign a man had to be displayed outside that's number one don't tell me you have it oh yeah but you know it's in your pocket whatever it's okay you know no it's not okay this is lifetime heard a lot of messages over time but you see brother Branham said what we need today in Jeffersonville Indiana is thousands that's the funding that shakes the devil and the devil gets so disturbed by having someone manifest that life he shakes he shakes in a way that oh it's a life remember the power of the life Jesus was walking through the tones that you know in the place of God era and there was a drama there screamed out have you come to cast me out before my time doesn't never spoke to him walking but the devil could feel there's some kind of life there oh he felt uncomfortable he for all he was he felt in trouble have you come to cast me out before my time and Jesus didn't even say a word he was just passing through okay going to the swine's you know this wise when they jumped into water and whatever and they got angry with Jesus for doing that but let me tell you another thing the life is very important the genuine huh life of the Holy Spirit Paul rather yeah Paul was in the city casting out Devils and here healing the sick because the life was in him he had the experience of the Holy Ghost the life was in him so he could lay his hands on people who were sick demon-possessed and everything and they came home streaming out they could they were commanded to leave and they left but they were vagabond Jews in the area hmm looked at what power does he have i wonder how how this is done hmm I see first he says he laid his hands and he ended and he cries to somebody we can do that we can do that we could do that so they got together they got together one day okay here's a case we could pray for they got together as it is now double I urge or thee in the name of Jesus who Paul preaches come out of them come out of this person he heard a voice yeah well sitting right there he wasn't moving he had a few questions for those that were trying to crack a say here's the question Jesus I know Paul I know - that man makes me nervous Jesus oh but who are you what made the difference it was a life that was in there you don't have to say anything they will shake glory be to God that Devils will shake and shake and shake hey man they get so uncomfortable listen let me tell you something that devil should be uncomfortable here tonight every last one of the devil should be uncomfortable because he is sitting next to a son of God now are we the sons of God it does not yet up here what we shall be but we know now right now right now well the cancers and tumors and diabetes it doesn't matter they're shaken here tonight if the life is here if the token is here they have no right to stay here praise be to God hallelujah amen Nora be to God now remember after the seven seals brother Branham says I'm gonna close is my time up yeah I have three he had three minutes after the seven seals but the bram says anointed ones at the end time you can sit down a moment it's just just one moment anointed ones at the end time after these seals are open amen then we'll come these guys these guys you know I wanted I was tempted to preach a message who are these guys there's a five whole ministry and then there are these guys who are these guys as sure as the fivefold ministry is keeping the Messiahship strength these guys are doing their best to undo and destroy intellectualism let me tell you something you can't make somebody an apostle you can't make anyone an evangelist whatever a pastor whatever you have God has got to recognize that person God has put in the church some evangelists some prophets some teachers God God God so my warning to you is watch these guys watch watch these guys see an closing now the token for the believer today is the Holy Ghost not a blood a chemistry but the Holy Ghost the Holy Spirit that is a token that God requires of the church today God must see this token he must see it in every one of us now they were fixing to leave I have one minute I'm just gonna stop the clock here just not gonna go further stop I don't want it to ring but now they were fixing to leave an exodus now I'm going to tell you something your battle your trials your tribulation and what you're going through now is are not worthy to be compared not worthy to be compared with the glory and the shouting and devorah that awaits you yes it got harder and harder and harder and harder and harder but there is still not worthy to be compared now let me tell you what God was doing all along to bring them to an expected end now this was planned did you know the devil has a planning God has a plan and one plan is going to work I believe in God's plan I don't know how what you believe one plan is going to work one plan is going to work in one plan only so God had already predestinated for this to come to an expected end he hardened the Pharaoh's heart because he didn't just want them to be in darkness that's they didn't want he didn't want them just to have frogs and so forth you know look you have troubled my people for over 400 years I'm going to punish you I'm gonna make you
