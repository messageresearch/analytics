for the first time today we want you to feel welcome and enjoy the liberty and the presence of almighty God because the Bible says where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty Freedom amen so we want to say uh thank you for coming we have uh a pastor here Pastor James Juma from Zimbabwe could you just stand there brother and your wife we just like to welcome them they've come all the way from Zimbabwe to be with us this morning so so we trust you'll have a real blessing my we have uh this is the last day of the feast but it doesn't mean it's over Hallelujah you believe that there's one more push there's one more go at it brother sister there's one more chance that if you didn't receive your blessing during this meeting but today Jesus stood at the last day of the feast he said If any man thirst any man whosoever will let him come and take off the Waters of Life freely so you welcome today to dash into the promises of almighty God and we want to salute our precious brother Olu what can we say about the message last ton night the pom of Freedom brother Olo We Salute You we bless you man and what a masterpiece that was what a blessing my just to see the the way the Holy Spirit led him to say certain things and and and uh after the meeting certain people begin to just Express how the they they understood this and they understood that and how that meant so much to them and and we so thankful and brother Ola said something striking he says you know when when Adam came on the on the scene he says before that a tree never died he says the enemy was bound because the Son of God Satan was right in the garden of him but he was bound why because there was a man of F ested son and again that comes up back in the end time brother where the enemy will be bound where by the manifestation of the sons of God and they coming back brother they in process there's something happening in the unknown world that the the Devils don't even know what's going to happen brother but there's going to be an activation uh all of a sudden uh like on the day of Pentecost the Bible says suddenly suddenly brother it didn't just they didn't know when it was going to happen but they were ready and I want to tell you today let us be in the right place at the right time so when the ignition happens the activation uh when suddenly the Dynamics come we in the right place to receive the promise of God hallelujah man I like my brother all who was stressing that that we got to get hungry we we sometimes too lazy we slothful we don't pray enough you see God uh when he came down and he met Moses in the burning bush you know what was God's words I heard the cries of my people and I have come down and I remember my promise so there's a lot of promises but the people must start crying for it the people must start getting hungry and thirsty and say Lord that's me every time a promise is mentioned you must say that's me Hallelujah you might be in a state I don't care but you must claim it for yourself and cry out for it well there's one more meeting brother and I believe God is able to meet with us he's able to touch us this morning as we break through those Realms as we break through every spirit and and brother over tonight we do concerned about this flesh it's time we break away from ourselves Hallelujah time we break away from ourselves and break into the spirit of God and once you get away from this man and you come away from the earth that's why God tolds John come up highest John because I want to show you things but you in the flesh as long as you're down here you seen this and you seen that but when you come up higher now you're in the spirit then God can deal and show you things so I say come up higher this is our last meeting and I believe God is going to bless us [Applause] my they just told me our Pastor Brian n is here and his family where you brother Brian Lord oh this side God bless you good to have you with us so it's my honor and privilege as the musicians brother Eddie brother con want to come up with Hallelujah he say man sing South African song so uh we're going to sing that and as he ministers the word of God remember this is going to be the prayer line meeting so let's break away from the Flesh and what's happening around us and we're not tired there's nobody tired here hey there's nobody tired we are tired but we tired of the devil so we say enough is enough Hallelujah this is the last meeting man enough is enough and I'm leaving here free that's what brother allu said freedom of spirit brother the liberty no more burdens the filled with the Holy Ghost filled with the anointing of God uh that's what we going to leave you with praise [Music] God [Music] [Music] [Music] raise those [Music] hand come on let's raise [Music] [Music] your it's my honor and privilege to bring up a special friend all the way from Sierra Leon our Pastor John con God bless [Music] you come on come on [Music] Hallelujah Hallelujah let's raise your [Music] [Music] hand somebody shout hallelujah hallelujah somebody shout hallelujah Glory they be seated for a while Lord have mercy Lord have mercy hosana hosana Oh Glory to God Amen I'm happy this morning and the Holy Spirit also happy this morning South Africa is different Hallelujah I love your Worship Is So Exciting I just can't really say much Hallelujah my expectations are high this morning like it has always been that has no change like brother brother said yesterday it's like there's a cooling down for the holy spirit amen and you don't seem to see the desire anymore like it used to be for the feelings and we feelings and the only thing that settles this issue is the Holy Ghost baptism you can't be a Christian without the Holy Ghost it's simply not possible it's like wanting to live here without a breath of life before I preach I want to activate your faith this morning Hallelujah because God is not dead Hallelujah people are still being sealed Away by the Holy [Applause] Ghost glory to God thank you Jesus s of been greetings to the con vention back home I came with my wife sweet Sarah s please stand up with with all the hard times we've been through in that country war and then lately Eola one demon just held that country in hostage I stood there I say Lord this is just one demon called Eola can bring bring a whole country of subjection no no shaking hands you can't trust nobody if your wife goes to the market and she comes back she has to offload before you can even say thank you imagine coming to church like this you can't greet nobody you can't Embrace nobody how do we even worship scriptures like Mark 16 out because if you fall under the anointing I won't even touch you glory to God hallelujah that was how vicious that demon was but we overcame by the grace of God because God is not dead they reeded that was terrible very very terrible I can't even explain it to you but it was terrible it was terrible you can't eat anything wrong they will send spice into the churches because they were to close the churches up because I said the churches is where people meet and and and and this virus would not let you touch somebody once you touch an infected person it transfers and the less than one hour it is thr with you drains out your whole system destroys your whole immune system Hallelujah but God took us through by [Applause] faith somebody say Amen to that church there was a time a brother in my church is called by the Daniel so many of you a few folks here know about the Daniel so a word of Prophecy came from the state but the Daniel's wife has her brother in the state so the lady is very religious she went to a church and in the church the Pastor said and there's a brother in C Le but Daniel but Daniel of Eola so the news came to church so I said Daniel that's a choice you have to make but I'm the pastor of this church nobody dies in this church of HEB so be seated and I'm I was very grateful that I have God left you know God Lives room for faith God leave rooms is what you can believe I said there's a room we can believe that if it was a prophecy it can fail I'm not defined the man of God but I can make that prophecy fail because I shall not die but I shall live to the clear the works of God and God saw us through be SE so we are still standing strong and this morning there's a knockout for the enemy this morning young people come on this morning don't stay in your P stad because today can be the day God has obained to free you at last you be seated Hallelujah so greeting from the great church in Freetown King brother James James stand up fine young man know if you know but James wonderful young brother you see that and that is his wife sister Rachel bigger than bigger so we thank God that we are privileged to be in this convention this my first time coming to South Africa but it been a blessing having had all the minister speak from Brother Isaac a young man I'm so proud of it's been so such an inspiration to my young people are back home because it had to find a young man that can stand for this message riping young man the young people are so immature but God made no mistake when he called you a young man so your calling is not premature I said your calling is not premature you are called The Right Time by the right message and you are in the right place [Applause] so don't think God called you too early or he called you late you came in your time and in your season and this is your time this is your season if you fli that way then say Amen to that let be seated so I thank you brother the Raymond Thomson for this invitation on the privilege I love you so so much thank you very much and all the song leaders all the all the musicians and also I'm all the Gratitude all the blessings that we've enjoyed so far nice sweet to tell brothers are so sweet thank you for everything may God bless you richly May reward you richly with the remon may God bless your ministry may God crown with the Dynamics this season hallelujah praise God therefore this morning I want to bring a little something to your little thought I was going to speak on thy seed shall possess the Gate of his enemies so brother because I I I want to talk to the mature seed son you're still a seed son but mature situm because there can't be a bath without a mature situm so you are still a seed son not manifested yet hallelujah or in your seed state you've got to be mature before you can be reborn to be reborn with maturity makes you premature so I have a question this morning where is the ripen seed of Malachi 4 you been this message after 51 can't produce mature Seasons we still can't find people with bright character since 1965 what then have we been doing we can still be babies over 52 years in this message you can't still forgive where do we think we're going but there has to be a bride man I don't care who fails what you say there's going to be a bride and this morning I am one of them My Mind Is Made Up I'm going to be a bright [Applause] material I'm going to be SE bless glory to God let me tell you something I told about the old just few days ago I was in Ghana I had friends in Ghana few Brothers there are sick terribly sick and they are ministers so I came to a cry to see if I could see them they would not let me see them so one of them called me that I should pray for him he had like a kidney or liver problem or something he said The only person he could trust to pray for for him was me because he said he does not want people to know that he's sick because in our message in our ranks if they know he's sick of that disease they will say God is judging him they'll try to trace back his life and find something he did wrong some time ago and bring that thing up and connect it to his illness when Eola struck my country they say God was judging me put in the message so when we come to these meetings we looking for the sick to be heal it's not in our heart because in our subconscious we are even trying to see if God is not judging that [Music] man brother I don't want God's judgment I made mistakes but I want his grace I prefer God's grace than God's judgment can somebody shout hallelujah hallu I am not asking for his Justice because I might not pass his justice but Grace can rewrite my life can somebody shout hallelujah so this morning forget about your mistakes your mistakes is not really in the account it is really who you are in Christ what Jesus Christ has done for you you see [Applause] it that's really terrible so a lot of times we come to meetings to do you don't you don't even hear claims claims is of this message everybody is afraid to make a claim we preach the word but no claim because we are afraid we might not measure up to the claims we make but until you say it God can back it up can somebody shout hallelujah hallelujah be seated I want to get the atmosphere set for Revival we preach the Holy Ghost but no claim people are afraid to say I have the Holy Ghost because they think if they say have the Holy Ghost their life canot measure up they afraid to say I am an adopted son of the making they can't say that they afraid to say I am from the god class of of creation they can say that they afraid to say I am the continuation of the creation of God I am not another creation I'm the continuation they cannot say that because they are afraid that their critics might watch them Hallelujah I came I became a Christian God gave me Grace not to fear my mistakes one thing I know I am predestinated my spiritual history shows have always been in God's mind I cannot be lost I told the devil if I have to go in hell I will still love Jesus I will still Praise Jesus so it does it serve your interest to take me down to hell if I am in hell I'll still preach sever Thunders give Faith I'll still preach that's the price Revival Hallelujah so it is not in Satan's interest to take me down to Hell because if I go down there I will convert his entire people oh somebody somebody shout hallelujah glory god T so I have told the devil already I'm not scared so he has a choice to make to either let me go or make me go down there and bring all his people out I will still tell them Jesus died for you you don't belong here because Jesus Christ made s prison and he preached down there can somebody shout hallelujah somebody shake your faith lift up your faith this morning all things are possible to them that believe let be seated so therefore I have a little title this [Applause] morning as your faith is rising up this morning the faith back is coming up let me see that I'm so excited this morning oh t the Holy Ghost is buing inside my [Applause] soul may be seated Hallelujah the devil is already trembling because he knows you know who you are you you coming from so we have a little subject this morning a little title and all Ephesians is here I'm declaring that today for thy seed to possess the Gate of his enemies I want to connect your seat back to an Ephesians because Ephesians is the place of the Overcomer no battle is lost in Ephesus God told Joshua no men no mortal men shall be able to stand before you all the days of your life that was his mandate to Cross Jordan and this morning we have a Divine mandates that no demon no Spirits shall be able to stand before this bride if you feel that way then say Amen this morning mayab me [Applause] seated so let's turn to the scriptures quickly I want to excite myself this morning I just hope you join me this morning glory to God hallelujah and Ephesians is here for thy seed to possess the Gate of his enemies for an inspiration that Ephesians brings us back to the Glorious age of the Overcomer so we don't have no business over here this flesh thing making your efforts TR that's over here over here we have missing limbs dysfunctioning lers and kidneys but over in Ephesus is different praise God hallelujah T 25-18 Galatians 3:16 but Peter read the same scriptures and Genesis 1:6 hallelujah thank you Jesus okay let just s quickly he said and the angel of the Lord called unto Abraham Out of Heaven the second time and said by myself have I sworn say the Lord for because thou has done this thing and has not withheld thy son thy holy son that in blessing I Will Bless thee and the multiplying and multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and as the sun which is upon the seashore and thy seed shall possess the Gate of his enemies that's your promise and in thy seed shall all nations of the earth be blessed that's how you stand this morning the whole creation is waiting for you yeah that's how important you are because thou has obeyed my voice Galatians 316 and now to Abraham and the seed where the promises made he said Not andto seeds as of many many but as of one and to thy seed which is Christ bece praise God hallelujah so what establish the Ephesians inspiration the Holy Ghost the B says Kenya doesn't represent the age of the Millennium we all know that his message it represents the age of the Overcomer the dispensation of overcoming because in Canan they killed and born and took cities see but but but it represent an age a dispensation of overcoming so the bride has an age a dispensation of overcoming and until we into that age that dispens began can't overcome at all hallelujah praise God can somebody say Amen to that church Hallelujah and Mal came back and connected this Joshua that the Book of Joshua as a book of redemption it said it it paraly the book of Ephesians right right and and the book of Ephesians is a book of redemption and the Book of redemption is Jesus Christ so the book of redemption is is not only a book but it is also a land so Ephesians is a book but also a land the land of the Overcomer so it starts both ways can somebody say Amen to that church can somebody say Amen to that church and and and Adam had this book in his hand so Adam in Eden was what was Ephesians there was Adam's Ephesus somebody say Amen to that church now Adam was given a seed of his word I think but the all talk that last night a seed of his word you see this seed of God is what we are trying to bring out not just any seed Mal revealed the entire Bible and he brought out seeds Hallelujah he brought out Church seeds Pentecostal seeds but in his message there is an original seed which he calls the seed of the entire Bible and he says Jesus is the principal theme of the entire Bible if you read the scriptures You Don't See Jesus with it again you see it so Jesus makes the Bible a book of life if you take Jesus Christ out of the Bible it is just a [Applause] book there is no life in it but once Jesus is injected into the Bible it becomes a book of life the Lamb's Book of Life can somebody say Amen to that church so we can't just preach word word word no [Applause] Jesus we've got to connect Jesus the Holy Spirit to the word to make that word life may me see that let me see that so when R came he opened the seals now listen carefully because don't miss this but the Bram went before the beginning no Theologian did that before there was a time before there was an angel before there was let there be he existed as Elohim self existing self knowing Hallelujah but he existed with attributes which are called thoughts [Applause] that was his nature to be a savior not to be a destroyer but to be a savior to be a son to be a father that is God's original attributes he want to be a father to you he want to be a son to you let me see it that is his nature his cor nature Hallelujah and out of that nature comes mercy and Grace and forgiveness H then God expressed those attribute into virtues and Thunders they became the lugus the word and we were are members of his body members of the lcus can somebody say Amen then Elohim not spoke to the logos that let us make man in our image Jesus Christ the logos was the image of God we all know that but that image was not a shadow it was a being a person God's image is not like your image when God speaks of an image he speaks of a being If His Image comes here right now this place could be loosed you see it so Jesus Christ is the image of God is the express image of the invisible God that means when you see Jesus you see God because Jesus reveals God because God is a mystery see it that Elohim spoke to logos let us make man in our image then God created Man In His Image after his own likeness but the prophet said that was a seed of his word a seed is only a potential tree a seed needs growth to becomes a tree when you take a seed in a tree there's no semblance between the two but the seed has transforming power once you s that seed there is a law on that seed to transform itself and becomes a [Applause] tree so when you hold the seed you might not see anything in that seed that looks like a tree until you saw that seed on good ground then there is an invisible law you don't see that law that's hanging over that seed but once you plant that seed that LW takes effects so you activate the law where you plant the seed you don't need to see the law you don't need to feel the law the law is hanging there but you've got to activate the law by sewing the seed let somebody shout hallelujah H yeah may see [Applause] that if you have to wait until you see the law you will sow that seed so sowing the seed is your faith expressed in activating the law that makes that seed bring forth after it can and once you saw that seed you can go and rest the seed has Potentials in itself to bring forth after it kind that's God's law let the house shout hallelujah May [Applause] seated let be seated and what we lack in the church today is sewing because sewing goes with tears sowing goes with labor sowing goes with pain but until we s because showing is how you express your faith in the Lord to bring forth out it kind hallelujah praise God and brother Bram brought out the seed of the original Bible and he took that seat to himself SE the seed of God so when he said he came to put a revelation on Genesis 26 that when God made his Man In His Image he was a seed of his word but the man has potentials to become like God then he gave that seed a commission he said be fruitful and multiply but the Pam said Adam never came to that that means he never came to the fruit of his seed because that was a commission because the fruitfulness of Adam was to reproduce all like Precious Sons that means we were the seed we were the fruit of that seed so if Adam had come to fruitfulness it would have been you and me standing here today oh somebody say that [Applause] church so Adam could not come to his Commission because he himself had to overcome so he failed in his commission but God sent a second [Music] [Applause] Adam his name is [Applause] Jesus and Jesus says without me you can't bear fruit because he is the fruit of your seed that means when your seed brings back after its kind it will produces who Jesus Christ you've got to believe this man seven thought that gives you Faith to believe this don't put your mind there let me see that many of us we are sympathizing we are negotiating god with our spirit see I want to preach this morning please give me time let us just rejoice in the words because the Holy Ghost will surely fall and if you don't have the Holy Ghost you shall be sealed but let's enjoy the word this [Applause] morning see why do I love genes story that's the only place we can go back to our world image Pentecost has can go there yes so the three for mystery of God was to restore us back to Eden say Amen to that say Amen to that and that you your promise and Jesus Christ makes that ple for Revelation because he reveals who God is because God was hid in Christ so you won't even know who God is except you see Jesus then how do you you know who you are you be also hid in God in Christ he said because our life was hid in God through Christ you can't see your life except you see Jesus so Jesus Christ is the center of the revelation of God and you as well let me see so how can you know who you are without Jesus let SE and I I'm not just about about Revelation now but the knowledge of the son a real God Minister want to to the knowledge it's a g knowledge kind not just when you know through your brain it's an experiential knowledge when you know Jesus and the Forgiveness of your sins and you know Jesus in the power of his resurrection that's a different kind of knowledge it's a knowledge that comes to you by experience that makes you know that you know that you know that you know let me see that I was going to church but I never really knew Jesus until 1983 then I knew there is a power that can make you stop adultery make you stop fornication make you stop I knew God in the forgiveness of sin my life changed and that God is not dead is still alive he can still change you Hallelujah let see let me see so we need men today that can preach experience than theology to the many preachers they preach theology what the prophet said they've not partaken yet of the fruit how do you cross over Jordan except some spice come and convince you that the land is goat the land is real then you can give your life for this land but the pr brought the evidence of the new land and we we supposed to leave by the evidence of the new land how can you live in this message without that evidence to be [Applause] SE let me see that the evidence did not just come in Word but the brand demonstrated the evidence that you might know the land is not fake the land is real in that land missing limbs can grow back in that land the dead can come back to life in that land dysfunction levers can be replaced Hallelujah let be [Applause] seated H let [Applause] seated I I I I I want to hear men now that can tell me how it looks like how it feels like together Holy Ghost I want to hear that to provoke my jealousy to provoke my my my desire those are the guys you want to hear now how does it feel like to get the Holy Ghost what do I become if I get the Holy Ghost we need those men for the hour [Applause] amen oh somebody shout hallelujah I said somebody shout hallelujah let me SE and listen what the enemy has done is to silent the voices of men I know there's an arrogant side of it for every genuity there's a fake but the fake must not deter you because you are genuine you come from God you need the Holy Ghost don't let some fake guy persuade you the Holy Ghost is not real no the Holy Ghost is still real somebody shout hallelujah the Holy Ghost is still real let me see Hallam said Adam's theop has always been in Eden so in Eden was his theophany which was leading the animals like the Holy Spirit leads the church to be you see but Genesis 2:7 men was not tuned wasn't activated to eat so God came and gave adam a breath of life because that theop can't come on dry because the dove leads the eagle no Dove no Eagle leading so before the eagle comes the dove must comes first the eagle comes on the do somebody shout hallelujah no Holy Ghost no [Applause] growth you see it I mean let get this clear Hallelujah you see [Music] it so I know his word his word is I I respect the word but it is the element of the word you bring out you preach all this word no Holy Ghost Element no baptism element that word is chaff so it's the content of the man's message the element water blood spirit a whole message has no blood has no water in it has no life [Music] hallu I am preaching today man this is South Africa brother the rmon am i f to preach I'm preaching the words somebody young people coming now this is your season now this is your season now be SE may be SE that may me see [Music] that that's why we we call them six seals they preach the word but no Jesus the elements that make the body no water of the word GL people come to church condemn what wash them out they are so sticky in their wrong ways they come to church for a cleansing but the word has no water the man come to church sleepy come sleepy no refreshing because when you take a bath what happens to you you feel refresh at least the de for that day goes off can somebody shout hallelujah this is what church is made up above when you come to church you come for a washing it takes away the guilt takes the fear and refreshes you for the blood the blood of [Applause] Jesus baby SE Hallelujah hallu you come from work you've been messed up in your office you made many mistakes you feel so clumsy you come to with a heavy Spirit what you need is the water of the word to make you refresh again because that not your stop you can still go on y the blood of Jesus keeps you safe let me seated Hallelujah but the P said the blood does not save you but it must keep you Sav so if the man is saved there's no continuous flow of blood that's dangerous the blood was not meant to save him but it was meant to keep [Applause] him so when the church loses blood people backslide they lose Faith they lose faith in their salvation they lose faith in their Redemption because there is no blood young people I don't care what you have done the blood still speaks I don't care your mistakes the blood still speaks Hallelujah let me seated and the life was only meant to follow the blood the life cannot come if there is no blood because the life rest under the blood and when the blood comes the life gives a token that the blood is here because you feel the spirit let me [Applause] SE let me SE Hall hallu you come for whole service you don't feel the says I'm identify with a group that fills your spirit we have the word of God is made manifest because to be a Christian you need to live in that atmosphere to be kept save you need that atmosphere so in this convention Hallelujah when did just come to a tent convention but to feel the spirit to feel the anointing to F the Holy Ghost shout hallelujah hallu let me seated it's the element of the word hallelujah so the content of a man's message is not how long it is it's the element and the church can only Survive by these three major element because those element to mix the body Hallelujah where is the water where is the blood where is the life that's the lifeline hallelu once that is missing that message is shock that's why we are so excited with this seven seal Lord have mercy Jesus Christ makes up that seven seal that's where you belong that's where your name is that's where you coming from from under the seven seal where there is water where there's blood where there's life under the seven seal you cannot die you can't be a church member you're always on fire Hallelujah you cannot stand you cannot [Applause] rock hallelujah SE when I came into this message that was one thing I had to do because I came from my Pentecostal church so I already know the Holy Ghost if I if it wasn't for that I'll have been lost in this message the first group I entered into said just believe you have the Holy Ghost that the message is the Holy Ghost that's all you need but I have known the Lord by your baptism before I came I know there is something called Holy Ghost I've received it I've tested it you can deceive me on that somebody say Amen to that church so I stood my crowns the first time I came into that church I was leing songs I just broken to tongue man said no no no don't speak in tongues here see that that Pentecost I said well but I thought this message should be had in pente so I was wondering that I had a man called brother kman the first man I heard say God said B of the I that's the group I belong to but thank God I have already known the Lord by way of baptism so you cannot deceive me now let for the devil and that is what I preach and I will not stop preaching it until the Rapture comes there is the Holy Ghost there is a change a transformation somebody shout hallelujah hallelujah there is a miracle signs and wonders that God is alive I will not stop preaching that that is my experience that is in my back [Applause] plate let you see [Applause] it let [Applause] see God made no mistake to bring the prophet after Pentecost has come it his days he said that that was why he had to go to the Pentecostals because they were the only ones that could receive the message because the Holy Ghost was there the method is can't the for the devil they don't believe in angels they don't believe in Holy Spirit they thought the prophet was crazy but the Pentecostals can't believe it because they experience the door was there this message was not meant to fall on dry the element of the baptism must be present and young people don't give up on that I don't care how long it takes don't give up on that because the day you receive it I tell you the whole thing changes the whole story changes the whole Lifestyle Changes ages you live in another world baby ra explains he ask him a question let me explain quickly ask a question about each person's Angel that's with him at path he put some mys there now he say explains how your at the angel which he calls the angel Spirit of the earth it tach that to your breath of life he says when the child is born see the life that child has is blood life hemoglobin life Jam of life but blood life because blood life makes your flesh because it takes blood to make flesh so the life of the flesh is in the blood you understand that quite well good but that life depends on oxygen to survive because if your blood has no oxy it cluts and you die correct I think the scientists are here somebody child is burn he has a blood life which depends on oxygen but it needs a spirit to make breathing impossible so if the Speak doesn't come he might breathe for a while later on die that's right all right because his blood life depends on oxygen that's the air that's not like that's just the air but he has a spirit and angels of the earth that ATS breathing that makes intake and outake of oxygen possible so if that doesn't come it's a still bath the child dies but it says that spirit is a dying Spirit after a while it dies but it's an angel Spirit of the earth is an a spirit given to you to help you breathe Hallelujah so when that Breath of Life lifes you say so your breath actually is a life it's not oxygen breath of life helps you to breathe in oxygen that's the life of your breath but is different from the life of your flesh that's your blood lifeall you must understand this Bic things in the message that's how it works in the spirit it says so that child has to be given a choice then the child makes its decision when the child does that that the angel of the Lord comes down which he said is a spiritual body which he calls the New Path and it says only the redeemed of angels not Sinners so once you make a decision to accept Christ an angel comes down you see but what connects you what activates your s to the angel is a baptism because just the decision is not really enough so there's an Angel by you right now that's close to you because you could not have come this far without that angel you see listen seated but you see our bodies we are dead to that Angel's presence see so natural people they are bright but they they natural they have Angels following them but their bodies are not tuned the body is not quickened to the signals of that angel so your PR when you receive the Holy Ghost as a baptism you become a TW full being you become a candidate of Association so the holy baptism Associates you with that angel you are connected says by that Spirit Holy Ghost he has a contact so without the Holy Ghost he has no contract but not having contract does he mean he's not there but you just don't have the contact so you make a decision the angel is there Sanctified the angel is there when the baptism comes it establishes a contact that angel now becomes real he walks with you he talks with you he gives you messages you are now in association with the Unseen [Applause] War oh somebody shout hallelujah oh somebody shout hallelujah Hallelujah be seated the new birath so the new birath came to you at the time of your choice but if you don't move on to the baptism the angel becomes inactive that's where many Christians are and if the Christian is not in touch with that angel just cut off they can't hear the angel like bam it's cut off the donkey has to help him Master can you see a whole Prophet needs to donkey to tell him there's an angel standing there can somebody shout hallelujah may God Resto back the link may God bring back the Holy Ghost and connect you back to your angel you believe you have an angel do you believe that do you believe that in your heart then shout hallelujah hallelujah let me see it that's why the baptism is so important it doesn't really save you Romans 8:11 says you of the same spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwell in you it quickens it quickens that begins at the baptism a holy ghost man can feel Holy Ghost with his body he understands the Holy Ghost signal the Holy Ghost moves on him he knows when to move when to go back when to speak he feels the signal of the holy spirit because his body is tuned to that angel oh somebody shout hallelujah oh somebody shout hallelujah glory of God Amen this is to Crave your thirst for the Holy Ghost be seated hallu oh somebody say Amen so the Holy Ghost has led you this far and that angel had a purpose he want to bring you to the word that angel that's your spiritual body that's your that's your real seed because the baptism is only a temporal keft when that angel steps and fails you you don't need a baptism no more you now become the person the angel lives inside your body he controls your senses you become an the image of God on the [Applause] earth hallelujah hallelujah let be seated let be seated how understand this so far how many of you understand how many of you understand so far I think I took my time to explain this beated hallelujah praise God so the element of the baptism is so important so as I said Adam's F was always in Eden he the animals but until a breath of life came he can be a living Soul he was not alive to that presence like many of you we are not alive because our senses are dead but we are still sons of gods you come to these meetings you so dead you're so cold no anointing but the Holy Ghost is really here yeah the Holy Ghost is here man the angel is here now Manu you believe that say Amen that is here I didn't come with the angel once we are here the angel comes down because whereever two or three are gathered in My Name Lord am I in the midst of them may see that but this connection has to be made amen it has to be made church until that is made you're going to strug with your Christian life because this body needs a quickening an Awakening hallelujah hallelujah praise God I just feel the blood come of me right now I just feel the Holy Ghost drop down right now hallelujah praise God Amen the connection has to be made me and I'm trusting God today that somebody in these meetings will be connected to that angel where the angel can speak back to you you can speak back to the angel May me seated hallelujah praise God let me SE it amen and when God breath the breath of life into Adam's nost say it was not it was not a moer his body was Quicken he was now in touch with the word image don't forget to be fruitful and the multiply was not given to Adam's 27 man it was given to his Spirit man this body cannot die to replenish me if you take a limb or a hand from Adam's Theon the Theon has the ability to regrow that hand again because it replenishes itself so if you if you have a missing limb right now I can cross over to Ephesians and go to your theophany and bring a limb and fix you there but your the can grow it again because it replenishes itself hallelujah oh somebody shout hallelujah somebody shout [Applause] hallelujah that body cannot St it has the ability to replenish itself to multiply itself glory to God hallelujah that is your the that's the word body hallelujah hallelujah let me SE so once that body was in Adam's flesh this flesh cannot die if a limb goes missing that limb can recate his say backu where Adam lost his his word image he became an ordinary man he begin to sustain wounds Ebola even even a mosquito can bite your flesh you can be sick a small insect that's what supposed to be if zoy life is in you Lord have mercy praise God if zoy life is in you no sickness can overcome your body Hallelujah it can kill cancer it's can kill the poison in your blood zoy life the life of God the life of your theophany it never dies [Applause] yeah let me see and that's why they has to come on Ephesians because our missing limbs our Twisted legs there's a spear part in Ephesians once you C Ephesians you can be replenished that's why this body has to be redeemed it has to come back in condition where it cannot die the Redemption of the bright Body by fire baptism my body is going to be redeemed when this body is redeemed mosquito bite can't make me sick Ebola virus can't kill me no more when the body is redeemed shout hallelujah hallelujah let me seeall [Applause] [Music] [Applause] may be seated everything is for you over in Ephesians it's a promising land that's the good land in Ephesians you can ask what you will that's how good the line is in Ephesians you spoken word don't come back void when you speak it so be it when Joshua cross over he said Son stand still Moon H over angelon it was AOK one land Hallelujah you get D in Ephesians in Ephesians you are an overcomer let me seated but the said your theop your glorified body is so close to you that's how close Ephesians is to you that body is not in this time you can't see it here it is over in another lande and it's a Jordan it's a small River Jordan stand between you and Ephesus hallah if you can just cross over Jordan Lord have mercy your Jordan is your death every man here today has a death to die every Minister has a death to die every young person has a death to die to cross over Jordan may be [Applause] seated be seated so Peter says by these exceeding great and precious promises we become partakers of his divine nature and we escape the corruption because in US is a corrupt nature a lustful nature lost for the things of the world that nature must be changed by a divine nature then you are free from corruption then your mind is set on things above your mind is set on things of the Eternal no more time to [Applause] Lost lust is a root of sin James says that how we all sin because we are carried away by our own lost and we enticed that's how sin comes lust is a craving desire never get satisfied it's a nature so sometimes you can cut the branches of sin but the root so prah said a man who be Sanctified the Holy Ghost he was once a drunker the lost the atmosphere once it smells alcohol the desire you see how long do you manage that once is there because the enemy tempt you on the desire he knows it's in your heart you want to have sex with that lady he knows that already so he sees a lost he sees a desire and he tempt you on that desire so until that is changed by a divine nature you keep struggling oh somebody shout hallelujah but that is going to change this morning church God can change that let me SE it so we try sometime to cut the branches stop smoking stop adultery but the lost the desire for those things that's the challenge we don't go down to the root and the maners to live his life managing lost is more lost conscious so when he comes to church he makes sure they look at women because he suffering yeah [Applause] yeah if the devil knows you you have no lost Jesus said the devil cometh of course he cometh but he has no place in me that's so Satan's coming is not the matterall but if he comes he has no place he has no deposit in me but if he has a deposit in you he come back for his account it comes and write a check because he knows in your heart he has a deposit there but today Christ will change your account and give you a Heavenly account and put new deposit there Holy Ghost deposit word deposit promises deposit sh hallelujah hallelujah let me see it so Bram said desire nothing because desire itself is painful especially when it's not on holy things let we see that say the root the snake if he Sanctified you cut off the branches but the root the thing that makes him do it is still there and what can take it out I'm clarified it's a fire baptism so what the snake understands when he sees fire he comes outside but until he sees fire he cannot leave you but today he will see fire somebody say fire fire Holy Ghost fire fire let seated when the Snak ises [Applause] fire may see it that's why you cannot be converted until the Holy Ghost comes that snake will never respond to word word word word word he wakes up and listen to you and sleeps again let him try more then you are suffer the things you hate and the things you do the things you don't like are the things you do that means you are a prisoner you are not in your freedom God did not design you like that he made a provision for you he sends fire Holy Ghost Fire Holy Holy Ghost Fire when that comes it setes the [Applause] issue see so young people that's a [Music] secret so so what choice do you make rather than having to manage lost Hallelujah managing lost doesn't make it overcome you can reform the human Spirit but you can't transform it the human Spirit has good as evil but Paul says even in the good there's evil there that's why you can't be satisfied with good self because in your best good self there's evil there as well you need a transformation God must change your spirit and give you another Spirit outside your human spirit so I will give you a new heart a new spirit than my spirit if you feel that way then shout hallelujah this [Applause] morning I'm fed up with my human spirit that tells me don't talk to this brother let him be the first to greet you that human [Music] Spirit I'm fed up they rece it and most of us our human Spirits have been so reformed until we miss the Holy Ghost for the human Spirit we are so nice we appear so good we can talk so nice about people behind their back is human hallu come here this brother what what a message at your back he doesn't preach much he he has Revelation he just said what a message it Go toon that mess has no mystery is too shallow he's not deep but he just said what a message ministers we all know that that's politic get out of that stuff man shout hallelujah hallelujah say what you mean and mean what you say work on your hearts Hallelujah may be seated I'm tired of that [Applause] stuff I must come to a spot if I say God bless you is in my heart if I say I love you is in my heart I'm not hypocritical shout hallelujah that's maturity not all this fine fine talk politic talk that politician they say things you want to hear they want your vote once they get your vote they dispense you oh I'm preaching this morning bro can I go on Sir be seated where is that mat seed be seated we've got to die listen it was easier for Samson to fight other people's fight he was good at that but he failed in fighting his own fight most preachers are good at fighting other people's fight they come to church I C your devil but they are fornicators so to fight your own fight is the challenge I told God last week I said God let me don't be like Samson cast out Devils from other people I have my own Devils to fight as well I have my own temperament I have my own situation to [Applause] fight Hallelujah because the battle Sami lost was his own battle and that was dangerous for him is a human spirit is human desires that was what you call on fight many of us that's the what we lose it most times easier to see how the brother went wrong I'm going to straighten him out what is hard to see is how we are wrong so most times we are so occupied fighting other people's fight and we leave our own fight so this season I'm taking on my own fight I have fought for you for too long I have my own fight as well to do my temperament my mood just wake up in the morning you don't feel like talking to people what is wrong well I am [Applause] Moody just come to church I don't feel like greeting anybody today I want to be by myself that's an evil spirit man you got to cast it out this morning man shout hallelujah SE where is that why seed if you think that minister help go help him most times even we ministers want to help other the ministers I will straighten him out but what's your Authority you're not even adopted yet straighten who who is straighten who no fire no power it's like Moses want to go and straighten somebody else out and the Jew man say who are you you think you you you'll kill me like you kill Egyptian get out of here man the man has no [Applause] mandate can somebody shout hallelujah that was a very good Jew man did you know who the hell were you where you coming from you think we don't know your weaknesses you're a killer get off here and Moses [Applause] run that young man made Moses run he made himself an exile be there you see that you see [Applause] that baby seated where is that wiping seed that's your death it smell like Solomon they were wise in other things but the wisdom on their own situation look at most wisdom how could he have allowed himself to be fooled by women see because lust vers his challenge it's because the devil is Tweaky it makes you feel that who you are and what we try to do is to disconnect you you are not that there's a higher self in you to put a fight in you may be seated so most times you begin to compromise with the human Spirit you begin to sympathize with your Humanity with your weaknesses well I am weak I'm human to he is human to forgive his Divine so only God can forgive God understand I'm human and we find C we are negotiating and we broke a deal with our human Spirit then we are B found but I am not going to broke any deal the human Spirit has no Dey in it it has no Divinity it's a fallen angel Spirit what we need is a higher spirit it's called the Holy Ghost somebody say the Holy Ghost G that's the only spirit that can put on the control the human Spirit your brain your in can't do it at all the human spirit will only recognizes the Holy Spirit it can only accept submission to the Holy Spirit where is that riping se struck yesterday where we at now I am not a bishop when God adopts me I am a son in the making I know that Hallelujah my adoption is under making me Hallelujah that's right that's how I feel about myself and that helps me manage my behavior because that's my expectation I didn't leave my University graduate to come and preach to be a church Elder by first option because God leave room for that I would be the fful I would have set my people free it's God's choice to make me otherwise but God gave me a choice that's my first choice there are folks in my church they want to do NS I said look why can't you choose to be a doctor the medical field that's the highest one get the mindset for to for the best in life live the rest with God because we can propose God disposes but we have a choice if God give you a choice it's a choice so if I have to make a choice between an ELD and a f Minister I will choose the F Minister I will set you down for an elder if I have a choice to be rich and to be poor I would choose to be rich if I have a choice to be open the book of life he said there are two section it's your choice he said one section has regular life you can be good nice be a good person go to heaven it's a section but it says that is another section said listen said the same book it's not two books same book one your name never comes out over here you can be good but if you don't repent it comes out now why do you choose to believe your name is in the etal section how about you even Choice there good but God gave a choice between the two sections so I choose to be in the lamb section in that section my name never comes out but you can choose to be a regular church member pay your good tide don't lie don't fornicate and go to heaven still don't need no Holy Ghost no power let me just pay my ti be humble come to church you but your life has no deity no power just a form of godliness but I choose [Music] otherwise I choose the life of the Lamb I want to be like Jesus that's a choice I make is a conscious [Applause] choice you can't force it on me it's a conscious Choice the prophet opened the books and it made me see how the books stand but he gave me my choice well I made a choice I want to be like Jesus I want to have dity in my flesh I want to be God Veil I want to be a child of God that's a choice I make and that is what I'm living [Applause] for they be do this but I'm say this age is the age of choice it's a choosing day we are brought to a junction Ruth made a choice she could have gone back because Naomi gave all the reasons why they should go back said you you can't make it if I should even have a child now how long how long will you wait he gave all the reasons why they should go back but in the face of all those reasons the reasons all sounded logical they sound the true but Ruth said I'm not going what you're talking is reasoning this is intellectual I'm going with you your grave is my grave where you die I will die there was a hard choice to let seated an oper went with reasoning what sounded logical well what now said makes sense so I think it makes sense to go back that's reasoning there was no faith on the inside but rotth saw the reasoning he said you talking intellect you talking your pring I'm going down to Israel they be seated it's a choice you make be seated but but but Peter gave a quote Royal Seed of Abraham Jesus Christ I brought it down that you the Royal SE it's a choice if you sympathize with your human spirit that is no that's not that's that's not it doesn't mean that you can't be the Royal seity you are human make a choice Bram had opened the SE for all of us my brother he told me that I'm the physical manifestation of the AR that was in God is a choice to believe it ra said I'm the literal spoken seed word of God that what he said he lives room for you to believe that he said those who are possessed of the spirit they are a part of those Angelic beings that resisted the devil's lie so the Holy Ghost is in you you are a part it's a choice to believe it but he left room for you to believe it see the rooms are there a man's gift make it room yes the greatest gift is the word the word you believe makes room for you I believe in signs wonders it's not Pentecost I believe in gting our Devils that's the that's my belief I chose to believe that hallelujah hallelujah I choose to be a demon Demon Hunter cast The Devils out I choose to believe [Applause] that is a choice you must make we are all product of the choices we make all things are possible to them that believe but the brandham opened Seven Seals each seal has its own content the choice is yours hallelu I choose the seventh [Applause] one the other six seals are fine there's Redemption going on there even the six seals hold the Redemption of the Earth but I choose the seventh one and that's what I preach I make all my claims on that sale it's a choice others choose to preach the sixu and say servant is closed in the message can you imagine that they deliberately close the seven one when the prophet said it is open they said it is Clos and you think I must follow them to a close seal no to me it is opened and I see Christ in that seal I see my name in that seal my inheritance my possession that's what I see in that seal hallelujah it's a choice you make Ace I'm not finished you be seated be seated I've enjoyed myself on the word be seated may be seated now the Holy Ghost can come be seated so you can make your choice today I choose to be the word image says when this human element all goes out when we are all Lo out we are formed into his very image I choose to become that because the only image that goes in the Rapture is the word image this human spirit is hybrid is a mixed Spirit you can get the Rapture so God put a death on it it has to die make up your mind to kill that Spirit today because it's your a if you doesn't die it will kill you the human Spirit enough of that in the message we all need the Holy Ghost thank you Jesus and when God give you the Holy Ghost your battle begins between the Holy Ghost your new spirit another spirit and your human Spirit as you obey the Holy Spirit you make the human Spirit inactive then you are led by the spirit the Holy Ghost flushes out all the evil people do me they wrong people hurt me they hurt the human Spirit they don't hurt the holy spirit so if I feel Hur my human Spirit the Holy Spirit comes and flush the all out because the Holy Ghost act as a bumper so I don't really feel H heart can only stay in me for for a while for minutes it goes off again try don't understand how Christians can keep CES for weeks for months for years and they claim to have the Holy Ghost it is human to keep grudges but it is divine to let them go but the Holy Ghost must help [Applause] you hallelujah it's now time we connect the seven Revelation to the life the virtues we've got to connect it before child comes on it it canot just be talk talk talk talk I have a revelation you must connect that to the VES or else no charity comes on it you must live out the Vue of your age so if you have a revelation begin to connect it to the virtue of your age because the seven Thunders are connected to the virtues Hallelujah and once you see the season when the people begin to connect their faith with the life then charit is closed Revelation Revelation no life still back bite try to destroy this min's influence with the people I I I never tell my to buy my fight I don't even tell them who's against me James they don't even know against he sitting there he went to London he was shocked to know I have issues he came back I said I will tell you that because I don't want to get you involved in my fight that's that my fight that's my training a brother says I have sex Pi on me it hurts me but that's my training I don't want to draw to that one because you have your own fight too because it's obvious if I tell you you would not have gone to that church because you you want to fight for the pastor you can't fight my fight man see but the all the pastors they pass on their Spirit on the people they go and create the offenses and the troubles they they don't do the fighting they are so lazy the pastor fight over to the people if I'm your pastor you must fight for me when Peter took his sword and caught kayfa servant ear Jesus said no no no no no no no no that's not how to do it that's my fight you fight the Peter Jesus Took back the ear and fix it back oh somebody say Amen somebody say Amen somebody say Amen Let me see but suppose it be any of us here will say good Peter you are a loyalist fight more chop his head off to show how loyal to the ministry I believe Peter was shocked Master you me this guy want to kill you I fought for you you feedback is ears he say yes Peter you don't win Wars when you fight your enemy on the same level the same strategy the same weapons how do you win that war how do you win a war against your enemy on the same ground same instrument same weapons same tactic how do you win that war you must must have a different strategy different weapons so you can't overcome evil with evil because it's the same strategy is the same weapon de for TS it says overcome evil with gold shout hallelujah hallelujah that's why in these meetings we are going to overcome every evil cancer Lia paralysis that is evil we are going to overcome it by the prayer of [Applause] faith let seated let me just round up quickly be seated where is that wiping seed so James was shock no no no no I've made up my mind to go this way and I make sure I won't even mention it even my wife I won't tell her some things that I go through because I know the logic behind it the human sympathy how can they do this to my husband and she leave her own fight and take my fight and most time she can't even win my fight because my fight are much much more harder I say s i fight your fight me because we all have our own fighting to do you be seated don't get yourself entangled fighting other men's fight be seated did that in the past just fought him he's never accused he's never insulted us we just took somebody else's fight to demonstrate our loyalty and we lost the fight we see the guys we are oh it's powerful usth of God all his the off of the Iraq few seconds is become let's go beyond that I'm saying some hard things today but I to say them because we must come to maturity somebody Hallelujah let me see let me tell you something it's only affect by your people this fight we do our fight as ministers is kills them they more confused they are disoriented the young people they don't trust no Minister outside their Pastor the P bring Perfection the only has to make measures elsewhere but they told they told their members to their fight so in this me they won't come something in this meeting must haveed must receive now listen you people you members when you bu those fight you kill yourself because you know why you are double loaded you have your own fight on you and fight is a fight a pastor fight is a gantic fight how can you fight the pastor's [Applause] fight you can't even fight your own small small demons you are fighting the pastor's own shout hallelujah hallu shout hallelujah They Se it it only kills you it only puts so much weight on the people so much weight they come to me this they all suspicious but they just told me that brother has left despiration so what is he doing here and when rmon says he must come and preach I think we have to wait and see where it's going because we have been told that he has left in fact it's not even the message again it's not preaching Pentecost so let's give him some silence see these are spirits I want to handle them today they can leave you right now they are evil spirit they are vicious shout hallelujah hallelujah shout hallelujah hallu they be seated they be seated let me finish if you think your brother is wrong what the scripture says Bible says you go meet him if you want to straighten me out don't use your because you might not know how to do [Applause] it see may see if I'm wrong come and show me help me don't use your pro to straighten me out but in your heart you should destroy my influence make me look as if I don't know nothing you are you you kill your ministry me many pastors have killed their Ministry the Holy Ghost has abandoned them because what they do now they don't read messages they go and SE them to hear what saying so they prepar the to react they they are warriors they become Warriors No mandate no commission you be seated that's not how to do it they be seated I'm finished let be seated listen this can be a group that can change that these your friends in other churches love them I told myself I tell the folks back home I've I've tried all to live a life before you to bring you to a spot where if I am wrong but the James should be strong enough by now to say Pastor stop because you see we could have done that with the cold man we are all trained well enough to have told him brother go this way hallu I'm sure we are all trained well enough Hallelujah but we didn't do that and the same SP goes on a pastor was L here for 20 years is human but he's been used by God to lead you but you come to a spot where you can also help him she said pastor I'm sorry pastor but I think P pastor Pastor I think I think I think you're going to extreme why can't you pray about it please please Pastor I think you need to pray you know we love you I think the way you going is too extreme but we don't do that anything pastor says Pastor say Sho Sho then what has the training become how much has he influenced you he human there are mistakes I make I say say I told her don't support me like a blind wife have enough courage to tell me if I'm wrong because you can do that these members they just follow follow and when I fall they the ones who say Pastor has fallen no but if I fall you fall so don't make me fall stand in the Gap and said pastor you can't go this way I will not let you go this way that makes you a virtuous wife may be seated I said the day you miss to do that I will lose confidence in you you're my wife like told how his wife would stand between him and the public when lied his wife said Daddy you can't do this look at the kids what influence you will leave for Joseph then if they hear you tell a lie you are in the house you not in the house his wife challenge him on there I believe all that help the prophet to make it right hallelujah hallelujah can somebody shch hallelujah hallelujah where is that wiping [Applause] seed how many wives today can tell their husbands the husband I think you are going wrong I think we are going too far I think this issue is going overboard I mean in I mean in in your in your close moments because let me tell you something I told se you know me we have been for six years so you must always tell when I am not myself there are times when I go off gear but if I go off gear don't mind me it's not me because the pastor you married to you know that's not the pastor put me back [Applause] together everybody here has standard chance to go off gear but God gave us helpmates he gave us wife he gave us deacons he gave us Elders to bring us back into gar somebody shout hallelujah where is that wiping seed [Applause] but most of our deons they so immature if the P I'm going to kill and so we are behind you the prophet said one word off you're my enemy draw your sword draw your sword cut him off cut him off so when they come to church they want to watch if their Pastor is talking to you if their doesn't greet they won't even greet you and if anybody does are you so insensitive don't you see the cont today why spirits and we call that Holy Ghost that's not bright character that's demonic this group today T is B we can change we can change that Hallelujah we can change that let's go back and change our churches listen we all have evil things you can talk about but the prophet said you must learn at least to see the nice ones because it is better off it's edifice it's a choice we must make I pray that this group countries you go there this pastor is that Pastor is that Pastor and when they meet it is so at times I'm shocked when they come back together bro hey how are you bro I'm bro your message I just heard what it said few minutes ago so I'm saying Jesus Christ I just had what he said few minute about brother brother is shallow he doesn't much just preach then when he sees him bro your tip was a blessing I watched them I say Jesus Christ is this bright is this bread Christ is coming for we can change that let's come to mat please I came today not to preach shouting message this is the last message let's change that hallu because it kills our ministry it kills our churches it kills our people and the unlanded ones the immature ones who are trying to follow somebody it just kills the praise God but God is looking for a group maybe this can be the group today under 30 or four that can find brotherly kindness that can say with their mouth what's in their hearts amen let me tell you my principle if I tell you something it hurt you no matter how right it is if you say you feel hurt I say I'm sorry I tell my folks because I don't intend doing it to actually hurt you originally maybe I didn't say it well you know I'm not a gramar student maybe sometimes I just miss say the words but if you express your Hur I'm always willing because you know why to show you my original intention was not to hurt you but I won't say no I'm right and sometimes people think you are weak you are too sorry sorry everything sorry everything sorry it's not sorry sorry it's a life you are not my enemy you don't even have to be my enemy but but but young man said if your enemy is plural you have a problem because our enemy singular the devil [Applause] have you SE that many ministers have corrected me I I don't feel obset but I I would tell them what you just don't a man become eny for life because ministers are Beyond correction if you correct them even one to one who are you they go be their P pit on their internet that black brother has no identity do it even know who he is I said so what you've done to me keep it don't BR to nobody else again but it must not be that way is a minister I am too he has a right to say bro I think you're not doing things this way because we are one another's keeper it is iron that sharpens iron somebody say Amen Church iron sharpens [Applause] iron when I first came to Ina I was preaching those years I just preach preach preach I put my first was alive then so I preached the Holy Ghost just dropped down meaning I was stop by I just went on so the anointing died down so after you don't do like that so I up straight he was not even a pastor an assistant what he say was right when you're preaching sometimes lift the Holy Ghost to meet the people you see that that me you have just left the Holy Ghost to minister you have to finish your message I said thank you sir it's not going to be with the Lord but he left that with me but plenty ministers will not take that we ask you what what what your your adversity for me to preach and you telling me what to say who are [Applause] you somebody say Amen to that church I'm looking for a group on this I'm looking for a group amen may this be the group where God can find some mature seeds you we can say I'm sorry please I don't say if I say something you are Hur I'm sorry not if I hurt you the person is already hurt you say if I hurt you I've hurt you by saying this please forgive me I'm sorry and you must find enough Grace to say I forgive you that's how that's how Sate not go back and call your people come come around call the disciples and poison their spirit and set them up against their Pastor go to Convention bro I love you what a message hallelujah what an anointing we can get you for that today before we leave the Holy Ghost put into my heart to go this way the thinking of our church let's start making them mature let's tell them because we saw the mistake in New York let's tell them we can sometimes be wrong there are times when they need our help so we must have groomed them for years and they must know we are living the life before them they must tell when we get off guard they must know this is not the only we knew but that was the we knew you must help because you've been with him for years so you must know when it change and stand by him because suppose we have done that 2011 it might not have sounded well but maybe it could have saved a situation but fear I am part of that fear group as well of course we knew it was wrong but fear so the old man's labor of bringing up a crop wasn't there we we all simply imature we were all unrival Hallelujah and if we don't change that it comes back to our churches pastors are preaching they are P preaching people in their ppit they are jumping when they are busy insting our pastors they're jumping preaching and people are scaming say it's Holy Ghost it's not Holy Ghost lift up your hands M coming forward let us all take up this

were blessed and I believe God has met with you and you're going home a different person because your mercy re wrote your life today and you made the right choice and uh the enemy will come back after these meetings and preach back to you and say nothing happen but you can point him back and say this day the scriptures was fulfilled in my life and I had a change and I had an experience with this so all the ministering Brethren thank you for bringing your people the convention is normally not a convention if there's no people to preach to so we want to say thank you for coming and then we just want to thank all the deacons our Deacon uh man we just want to salute them the great job they did with their wives and uh just helping us that's brother Luke rasetti brother Clyde brother uh and Becky and then uh luuk raset and his wife gabello they did so much behind the scenes and then brother Elijah and his wife sister B we want to say thank you let's just give them a hand they really did a lot of work behind the scenes so we want to appreciate them Sister Abigail were you she she helped so much with the ministers she put a snack bag not a snack pack but she did a job to take care of

know the the three meeting went so well and everyone played their part I want to salute you you're such a great congregation man everyone just played their part they were yet on time and it it made things just go so easy so God made it possible because of your attitude and your respect that you gave and the respect that you showed uh towards the convention and it made it so easy that we could

brother Theo them leaves tomorrow brother Isaac leaves tomorrow brother Conte leaves tomorrow so if you do get a chance to shake the hand or speak just say God bless you and have a safe trip so we're going to stand and I don't know it's so hard to close out a meeting but it comes to an end but we we're going to dismiss from this convention but not from his presence that's the main part so from here we go with his presence and wherever we go to as our brother uh con said let us be aware every second of his presence being with other so that when we make a choice it will be the right choice can we stand our feet brother on pal will you just come and close off us [Music] hello sorry uh I was asking BR PP just to come forward and close so he's pushing me to the front um before uh we give over to Pastor Owen to close can we we all salute Pastor raymon Thompson and his wife sister G for the faith to have they had to host this convention thank you thank you Pastor sister Gail thank you and uh this is a vision achieved amen and he was stressing about the three meetings how we going to do it and so on but God is in control amen and uh what a perfect message it was today to cap off the convention all the pastors here and so on and uh and for us also individually we are all challenged and I believe that we're going to live here being round Stones that's smooth you know stay in the stones in the river they rub against each other when the water flows and they make each other smooth so that water that was flowing the stones are rubbing against each other so we're going to be smooth and all the drop the odds are being dropped and love divine is taking control God bless [Music] [Applause] you and what can we say about the COO of the convention brother Luke he just had everything under control by the way so I think Whoever has a next convention whether it be in South Africa Nigeria own America Trinidad amen our brother luuk red will be the continua amen coo amen and
