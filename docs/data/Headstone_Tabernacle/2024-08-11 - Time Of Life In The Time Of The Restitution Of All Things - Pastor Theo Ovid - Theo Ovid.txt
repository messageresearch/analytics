with prise God bless you and welcome uh if you have your Bibles I'd like you to turn to Genesis Chapter 18 we want to read from verse 10 to 14 acts 3:1 19-21 then you have your SE uh Genesis 18 reading verse 10 and he said I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life and lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son and Sarah heard it in the tent door which was behind him now Abraham and Sarah was old and well stct in age and it ceased to be with SAR after the man of woman therefore s laughed within herself saying after I'm wa old shall I have pleasure my Lord being old also and the Lord said unto Abraham wherefore did Sarah laugh saying shall I of a shorty be a child which I'm old is anything too hard for the Lord are the time appointed I will return to the according to the time of life and Sarah shall have a son acts chapter 3: 19 Peter speaks repent ye therefore and be converted that your sins may be blooded out when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord and He Shall send Jesus Christ which before was preached unto you verse 21 whom the Heaven Must receive until the times of the restitution of all things which God had spoken by the mouth of his holy prophets since the the world be may God bless his word you may be seated praise God it's good to be here this morning and a blessing to be in God's presence thank you musicians we certainly appreciate the time here in worship and singing and music God bless you right let's go so today I have a context scripture and this context scripture is from Matthew chapter 17 verse 10 it says and the disciples asked him talking about Jesus why then say the Scribe that Elias must first come this was the issue Elias Elias Elias and Jesus answered and said to them Elias truly shall first come prophecy and restore all things but I say unto you Elias come already which is John the Baptist so they knew him not but have done unto him whatsoever they listed likewise shall also the son of man suffer of them suffer of them so therefore the prophecy was Elias would come am this Elias which we know is William Marian Branham Prophet Branham he was come to come this Elijah Spirit to restore all things the Bible called the restitution of all things Hallelujah so before time closes out there must be a restoration of all things and when God say all things he mean all things this morning I wanted to share with you a prophecy uh from a message this day this this scripture is fulfilled and um the 25th of January 1965 and this was uh B to the end of the service somebody spoke in tongues and then there was an interpretation and I want to hear I want you to hear the words so at this time I'd ask I the teting to put it on for us by the grace of God praise God hallu [Applause] I want to read out the words first and I want to get the words on the board afterwards so just leave you don't have to pull it back just leave it right there so the words are it's coming it's coming it's coming it's coming the mighty power of the Living God yeah it is coming he has promised through his word to pour His Spirit In The Mighty power he is sending the bride Revival into this great land y he is raising up men Mighty Men for his purpose for his purpose yeah he had anointed them in a mighty way for his bride he has promised unto his people that the Revival is coming the power of the Holy Ghost even as he did in Joel two in the last days in the last days in the last days I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh rejoice in this for thy God shall use his people yes they shall move from the North and the South and the East and the West they shall fight and receive the power of the Living God Rejoice Rejoice for surely the Lord thy God he is Almighty in the midst of his people and greater power greater power greater power will rest upon his anointed ones oh give the Lord some Praises so we want to continue from just where we left off there but Gideon you want to continue right there and you have the words on the screen please when it starts [Applause] yeah h [Music] [Music] [Music] I I I [Music] it's coming it's coming it's coming it's coming the mighty power of the Living God Y is coming he has promised through his word to pour out his spirit in a mighty power and he is sending a great Revival into this great land yay he is rising up men Mighty Men what is purpose what is purpose yay he is anointing them in a mighty way for surely he has promised unto his people that the Revival will come the power of the Holy Ghost even as it says in J 2 in the last days in the last days in the last days I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh rejoice in this for th God shall use these people they shall move from the North and the South and the East and the west and they shall take and receive the power of the Living God Rejoice Rejoice for surely the Lord thy God is Almighty in the midst of his people and great the power greater power great the power will rest upon his anointing blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah Daniel 10:1 in the third year of Cyrus King of Persia a thing was revealed unto Daniel whose name was belti shaza called belti shaza and the thing was true but the time appointed was long and he understood the thing and had understanding of the vision so when there's a prophecy or a word from the Lord you have to seek God or ask God to understand the thing and to get an understanding of the vision so the prophet William Branham he came to bring a prophetic vision for this bride he didn't just come to bring just a way of life because we're living under prophecy and we are living under the closing times of the end of the Gentiles we sit here talking about Jesus and the cross and Calvary but we have to understand clearly why we have that now is because he came unto his own and his own rejected him and turn him down and then God turned to the Gentiles but in the context of how God sees it they were blinded that we might see do you get what I'm saying the Jews were blinded that we get this opportunity to come to Christ as a bride for Jesus Christ oh blessed be the name of the Lord so when God is about to close off this Gentile dispensation that he must do then he must go back to the Jews so under so I want to remind you again the end time is here now brother Bram said say prophesying here now this from God has a provided way now we are moving on into another great age coming for the Rapture of the church and in this we are living in the time of the restoration of the gifts you see how you hear tongues and interpretation here this morning that come back in the church when that come back in the church along with other gifts that will speak tongues and then things will come out I remember years ago early Christian experience went down to a service down San Fernando and somebody service tatan somebody being speaking tongues and the interpretation come and God was exposing sin and telling the ministers about covering up and whatnot and let this man testify and I was shaken like a leaf those days was something else because the spirit was speaking people were was just dropping on this one sometime they drop on on somebody and they're speaking tongues and somebody else quite in next Corner start to interpret the tongues that were spoken and the people couldn't deny it if truth come you can deny it but God going have a perfect Church the promise is the restitution of all things Hallelujah I want you to be convinced of that I want you to understand this is not a as I told someone this is not a Baptist Church this is not live any where you want to live and then drift inside the church this is not that let that stay in the Baptist Church this is the pressing on to become the bright for Jesus Christ Hallelujah and he want a virtuous woman he want a woman that have faith in him he want a woman that trust him he want a woman that trust in herself and as a bullhead woman or a a bulled woman that he can't talk to he must be able to talk to his bride and his bride must be able to respond to the voice of his word oh glory to God he can't have a woman doing she own thing she feels to go here she feels she go there no get rid of that woman praise God you want a bride that will be just like him that love him that would serve him that would worship Him to Big honor and glory to him oh glory to God hallelujah hallelujah that Pillar of Fire that was hanging by night and the cloud by day could you imagine when you look up you see the pillar Fray night could you look up praise God you see the cloud by day how you going in that bar how you going in the RM shop could we Night by they want to take a look up so you say you go back inside you know because there's an eye watching you oh Glory that eye going to be here that eye going to be that's how supposed to have it you know there's an ey watching you somebody is watching you isn't that right praise God so but says now watch watch we are living in the time of the restoration of the gifts it stumbled many fine churches it send nazarin backward it may Fanatics out of a lot of Pentecost but just the same God is moving right on bringing in the rapturing faith for his church so rapturing Faith have to come in he has to bring in the raptoran faith then he says that then he says this so tonight I represent that Faith sir the Fate that was once delivered to the Saints in the way of a Divine gift so he was saying this Divine gift that I have represent the fith because the faith is coming and the absence of the faith that's supposed to be there the gift in me represent that so if the faith is to be restored we have to see the restoration of the gifts back in the church because his gift was representing the faith that was to come oh the Lord I shout so no Minister can lay a set of mysteries on my head and tell me that the FI you have to come better than that oh give the Lord some Praises nobody can bring information and the faith because you're ring a ton of mysteries you can reveal all the ton of mysteries and I'll bring you back to Ians do I know all Mysteries have all knowledge and don't have the faith that comes by love I am nothing okay the Lord I shout in the [Applause] house a ton of people deceiving this message you know they dress longer than yours Bri you are not we not singing message song so we not in the bride we had to sing message song we're not preaching Mysteries not in the bride we not saying the apostles say so we not in the bride what kind of idiotic foolishness is that God have to speak and that is why every church is Sovereign why because it gives the man the opportunity to get access to direct inspiration to speak what God lays upon his [Applause] heart you can make the Bible say anything in but it has to be in continuity yes you could cut a scripture in the middle and make it say something different Judas hung himself go down and do likewise and join that together is that do you get what I'm saying so you can't just say things it has to be the word in continuity so tonight I represent that Fate The Fate that was once delivered to the Saints in the way of a Divine gift restitution that word restitution the act of restoring to the rightful owner something that has been taken away lost or surrendered to a return to or a restoration of a previous state or position that is what restoration is amen and you see God has to speak to us to give us the understanding of where we came from it is very important because if you start with your life as a sinner that is only part of it you have to go before the foundation of the world as God thinking about you because if you take your life as a sinner and stay on that point then you would find yourself unworthy which we are of what God has done for us which he did God cannot cancel what he has already done he slayed the lamb in his mind before the foundation of the world before he was even born he thought of you and he saw you it come like where we are right now since we were weighing K he saw here when I just I do at the altar God saw me having grandchildren I couldn't even see my own children but God could have see that because this this is what has unfolded Oh Glory to God do you understand that when when you going through your trials and testings you seeing right on the ground here but God have a higher picture he's seeing the end of that Hallelujah you don't know why you're going through because you figure you in time and you're struggling and God staying so long to answer and God staying so long to hear but in his his operation that time is nothing in all 70 years is so God doesn't have a fight with time God have no fight with UK and Russia car know you know that have a end game to that Oh Glory to God hallelujah we coming to the end and to me it's almost like if things are lingering lingering just like like a holding it's like you're holding you're holding you're holding something about to break forth you know around the world around the world around the world something is about to break forth you now and I don't want you sit like you're in Dy school that you're ignorant that you're walking in darkness that you're not walking in the light God send light that we can walk in the prophet was sent before that terrible day of the coming of the Lord America is about to be judged and the rest of the world and this is the escape hat that we have this morning the line or the cord the blood cord of the word of God hallelujah Give the Lord some Praises whether you're young whether you're old whether you're small whether you're big all that dwell on the Earth shall worship the Beast except those names written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world if if you have no Revelation the name there you will worship your Beast so it is your responsibility to get that idea or to find out if your name is on that book and if your name is on that book you're going to shout you're going to praise God you thank God every single day because you know your name is on that book Oh Glory to God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God I was thinking about brother mundas and brother Knights and all these brothers who going on there Escape what is yet to come we have to deal with what's coming Oh Glory we have to deal with financial issues we have to deal with the financial wreck that is coming and the crash of the stock market and the crash of the economic system because they got have a new system where you can't buy or sell until you take the mark of the beast Hallelujah for a new system to come the old system have to die a lot of things going to change around you if you don't want to change change will change around you oh give the Lord I shout a lot of people don't want to change but even if they don't change things going to change around you oh can the Lord I shout in the house hallelujah [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hallelujah you may be seated all the time Jezebel foolish go she on to head because she's a manipulator she's a controller but when they went lusting after neighbor garden and want to own it and say they go buy it ner said no my grandfather and great-grandfather this is my family land no I'm not selling it he come and man he he Vex and she more vexed than he su she face no food for him no she she ain't cooking lunch that a Wicked Woman Wicked Woman in church Wicked Woman she tell her husband I go take care of it I go fix that they going to kill but and when they do that God sent Elijah God said that that you're going too far you're doing foolishness but you're cross line with that and not taking that like that God sent Elijah and that is how Elijah prophesy and you see that word that come out that man's mouth it can't return void you see God has have enough of your foolishness you know and when God have enough a word coming a word has come when he had enough oh give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah restitution the act of restoring to the rightful owner something that had been taken away lost or surrendered I read turn to or restoration of previous state or position that what restitution is but you were speaking about the M of the tears and we in Matthew 13 while men slept the enemy came and S tears among the wheat and then the servant say let me just pick them up cut cut all he said no no no no no at least while you got up tears you root up the wheat with them so notice the burden God has for this wheat that he can't even risk just to cut out separate keep them let them come to church together let them Fellowship together let them have 40 years together 50 60 years Harvest coming when you reap you go separate when what time when the reaping time comes Oh you mean there a reaping time to everything yes once a seed is sewn is have a harvest to that you could s Bad Seeds you could see good seeds Hallelujah let them both grow together Jesus words until the Harvest one two in the time of the Harvest I will say to the Reapers Gather ye together first the tears let them get a Revival first the tears bind them in bundles to burn them and then gather my wheat into my band but the B the wheat and the tears which from the first age until now have grown side by side so pressing play whole day is separating whe and tears because they're growing side by side what NAA set out to accomplish has finally come to pass with all the might of organization the false Church turns from any vestage of Truth with political might reinforces itself with backing with State backing and sets out to eradicate Forever The True Believer but just when she's about to accomplish a cowardly plot the wheat is GED into the Gana hear this word no longer will the wheat and tears grow side by side go deeper no longer will the tears receive the blessings of God because of the presence of the wheat we could close here right now we we could we we can go home at this here but we can go home right there do you understand that look at look at lot lot people God called Abraham you know lot tagal you know and the Blessings of Abraham was falling on lot it falls so much that that the men had a fight Abraham who was called and elected said let's not fight we are Brethren with the same message pick pick make a pick move how you want to move and he end up in Sodom

and the wrath of God will be poured out in the Sixth Seal which will end in the utter destruction of the wicked now I said a moment ago that the false Vine came into full fruit in this age her fruit would mature and ripen that is correct this evil spirited Church full of iniquity will be revealed as the mustard seed that grew into a tree where let the Falls of the air at her head will be the Antichrist the Miss of iniquity all this is true if this is true then it must also be true that the true bright church WIll mature when I was a child I speak like a child you can't give no inheritance to no child I understood like a child you can't put no child in no power position but when I became a a man I put that's not automatic you know you you could hold on to your childish things you know you have to put it away you know if you don't put it away you play with it you know like you're playing with them bbing and you're playing with them yoyo and so you playing with that you know until you take it and throw it away when I was a child I spake like a child I understood like a child but when I became a man what kind of man you coming as a perfect man I put away childish things because you're coming into manhood now you're coming into maturity now you're coming where God could give you more responsibility not chicken out go give the Lord some [Applause] Praises it come like you want more money but more money mean a promotion but more a promotion means higher responsibilities and you're ready for that you're ready for no more money if you're ready for the more money you means you're ready to accept more responsibility responsibility and that's that the what people don't want they want to her relax like life is a a by the beach some say they want to be a beach BM whatever that is but to whom much is given much is expected much is required that's why God has give people so little to see what they do with the little they have and they complain about oh God it's so small oh God get small small but are you faithful to what God gave you and if the answer is no he why should he give you more you can't manage $100 you want $1,000 you can't marage $1,000 they want $100,000

Jeremiah said that 7 we yes shall be accomplished oh give the Lord a shout Daniel the Prophet said read the same books we read and he saw the time that was coming he saw the end was at hand and he set

and I go you to catch your but there's a bride on the earth will come to Perfection do you know the spirit would leave while the bride is here let me bug your mind a little bit the spirit will be in the bride not on the earth in the bride not one more person to be saved because the book is now closed then you get the adoption Sons Ministry the Perfection Ministry of Ephesians 4:11 will begin hallu people will challenge me and debate me on that it doesn't change the fact that the ministry that is supposed to be here will be the ministry of Jesus Christ not no man's Ministry not brother Ministry not this brother Ministry all all of us are Ministry we're not talking about that but Abraham got to the ministry of Jesus Christ by way of three PS first pull second pull third pull he had the ministry and there were people that was judged under the ministry of Jesus Christ yes sir there's a sister that he called out and she was so upset said so angry when he finished he wait for him outside she wait for him she big and bad and she was I think a deacon or ELD daughter or something so she said listen don't ever do that again because BR trying to get her to the altar couple years later see she with me in a skirt looking for men on the street and even off smoking and even offer him and all she said AR you ashamed of yourself you know what she said she said that night when you

defeated how long would you take to say this is my land my children are my inheritance I don't have to take things like that I could claim them you hear me preach that but you have to open your mouth and say I claim [Applause] them brother also is the fact that the prophet for the last age must bring bringing forth a message from God that will forrun the second coming of the Lord by his message amen not by his message and a man in Trinidad not by his message and a man in America or or or Europe or anywhere else by his message will the hearts of the children be turned back to the Pentecostal fathers with the restoration of the word will come the restoration of power yes say after me with the restoration of the word rest will come the restoration of power that's God said so God said so so if we talk about the restitution of all things God s a prophet to gather all the word that was scattered Through the Ages the church ages as we say is the unfolding life of the cor tree when you put a seed in the ground it sticks up and it go up up up stronger and stronger leaves and whatnot and then it come get a corn the corn in the Cub the corn on the I forget I can't describe it with the all hating on top of it tle whatever call that that corn is the original seed that was put in the ground reproduced in multiplied form so you put one seed and you get a whole air of corn this is the history of the church ages the original seed and the end seed is the same seed the original bride and the end bride is the same bride he's Alpha and this is Omega he's the first this is the last the same power that was in the early church will be Alpha Church the same power the early church had the bride had the last bride going to have do you see it it's not a difficult message oh give the Lord

under Wesley they were so Sanctified when the power of God hit them so and they fall in church it had deacons with buckets of water to pour on them to wake them up because if didn't wake them up they were going to the Pentecostal age so before they get the Holy Ghost a bucket of water hit in your face so Sanctified the Holy Ghost has coming upon them and if you live Sanctified the Holy Ghost will come upon you do a here shout in the [Music] house Glory [Applause] Glory they live a Sanctified life and that Sanctified life attracted the Holy Ghost but when sour come on the scene 1906 1909 1906

hear a Revival they don't stay home and you know they no no no no no people is make your foot walk it just make people come all the people that don't want to come here don't want to visit what if God break a here now you see what happening all of you holding on to your seat hold your see you know because you might lose it oh give the Lord a shout in the house Hallelujah they're going to come from the East they're going to come from the West they're going to come from the north they're going to come from the south and they're going to fight and bring down the power of God go give the Lord a shout in the [Applause] house this L before service start in the brandom Tabernacle people there waiting 4 hours you know 5 hours you know waiting in the car you know waiting anywhere you know waiting

don't know who praise God so you could get pray I think there's a testimony somebody get some late number or something so and there was one they get called and bar call on the first but tell them you'll be fine it'll be fine it'll be fine it'll be fine and he said I want to start from 50 and he P not 50 it'll be fine it'll be fine glory to God no if you get 50 and you recognize things are going to work out in that kind of way and you're frustrated God you're vexed and why you give the number 54 and I wicked and God seeing your wicked attitude your wicked behavior all you have to do is to trust God you know glory to God hallelujah a certain seat he certain seat for a purpose he could be inspired to do that you know but you want this seat and you want this seat and miss your blessing because go that seat because you have a fire to come right inside of you special shower coming for you praise God want to openly tap just over your head right where you're sitting now inside there nobody can take your place you have to sit down there and let the fire of God hit you oh this message nobody fire of God oh glory to God hallelujah all the know passor word word word word quotes word explaining Bible talking talking but when the day of pentec fully come there was a man bringing a scripture and a text no it didn't say that they were filled so what God did Luther justification Wesley sanctification Pentecost preparing the vessel to receive the spirit because God had to open a spirit door a door of the Holy Ghost no man in that age because the spirit I said before he had open door that was the Holy Spirit to the baptism Holy Ghost God open my Open Door anybody could go through that door the open door but the age of adoption came when God in a prophet because he bring the word to deal with the spirit that came through that open door so the Pentecostal introduced the birth with gifts but they didn't have the word to get listen listen to these words to get the discipline to mature them as Sons so you see when mothers in the natural spoil their sons or spoil their children they have no adoption for that it's a mommy boy you spoil she don't have the authority or the Revelation to bring him into full maturity trials and Tes and does that so when Mother's hand like helicopter parents land on top the on the children land whether his daughter or or son or whatever it is and they screw up their lives how they come to maturity so you can see I write unto you children I write unto you fathers I write unto you sons and so on what God trying to do get us to spiritual maturity that we can handle our trials maturely so when brother maning adoption he said he could he could take your wife he knew that because that was his experience he could cast you in a bed of sickness who doing that God doing that he could turn the whole church against you do you're straight of the church and nobody get nobody have that testimony the whole church but he say he could do that you but guess what if you a son you where you going if the word is being preached you don't know if all the people going against you church members and you are the bride if you are and you the bride you are to understand if people come against you it's church members it might be nice you know some people come um um I want to say anything but this this is constructive criticism you you conr they come to nail you because they're looking to pick fault this is constructive why you saying that this is constructive criticism you know muchis we get build in this building if I take on all the critics here still finish yet please do it so do it so do it so I had to come down and say so if you don't get the clarity and determination to do what God want you to do and how God want you to do it I remember that the time we build in here you know why I'm saying this this morning no I've never seen I saw no church with Upstairs Downstairs none look where we are we Sandy Grandy if we have a wedding or something where you going to have function you to go in the hall some Civic Hall and something like that I knew that that is why the vision was this there were brothers who are upset because they feel if we just do it flat it'll be fine and it'll save us money and everything else but that's their inspiration why they didn't build it but the vision given was to do it this way let the years Roll by and you'll see the effect of what a vision is and I will tell you this if the vision you could do it in your own that might be really a vision that might be just ambition most times a vision is bigger than you a real vision and that should have to be God for that to be done a real vision for the family for the home for your future most times real vision is bigger than you so when you speak it most time people ridicule it because they don't believe it I remember when we were in G there and I tell them we we God spoke to me and tell me we've been standing gr after a while brother Miss bir nobody believe is but God didn't speak to him or the other buddies so I said doesn't matter I say if God said it it will materialize that is my thing if God said it if I trying to say something that's one thing but if God spoke it it must materialize but George was there when I tell the church I said church this is Brother the kindest thing here I said this must be revealed I said this is some Revelation here when the church finds his bloodly love and I stood there and stayed there until it broke and when it broke it broke with Revelation it broke with wine it broke with oil it broke with the ooint of the spirit and there was no doubt it was the Holy Ghost that brought a revelation of Brotherly kindness and it hasn't changed from that time to now we still have access to the spirit slot just above that brotherly kindness window it have a big Skylight of Holy Spirit and you seen the rainbow between L and brly kindness there's a rainbow Mark Holy Spirit we inside of there we have access to what's inside of there the anointing that you feel come from on top of there oh give the Lord a shout that's the holy spirit that is to come into the church and here what he said the Dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the Holy Ghost that we have worked in a small measure we still work in a small measure this morning oh give the Lord some Praises so with the restoration of the word bring the restoration of power so how a church could say they have this and they have that and they have the other and zero power they have power to spray a mus you can get a flick for that you get spirit for that no power whatsoever so what the Bible says restoration of the word means restoration of power because you see the prophet gather all this kind of word to TI back into the word the object to bring down the Holy Ghost then he said the entire Holy Ghost has visited the church to make Luke 1730 to make son of man back again and once son of man come back he's a sore the office of son of man is to bring seed seed for who the Pentecostal rejected it seed for you so he seed you a seed seed coming to seed you are attribute seed and now the word seed coming to connect with you whether a beaten pan whether you're smoking whether adultery whatever the condition is the condition wasn't What mattered What mattered was the seed coming to you and once that seed would connect to you something begin to happen Oh Glory it's a Divine connection something begin to happen word connecting to word Spirit connecting to Spirit Oh Glory to God so now there's a prophecy hanging over you it's coming it's coming it's coming this bride will be Anointed God will anoint his sons God will anoint his ministers Oh Glory to God on behalf of this bride [Applause] all right but Brown I know this nothing in new but I trust that God refresh your heart and mind with the words that spoken this morning because this is what I got to bring this is started just after the turn of the 20th century and it was to be the age in which the true church would return to being the bride she was at Pentecost we know that there must of necessity be a return into Dynamic power the Believers sense this in their spirits and begin crying to God for a new outpouring such as was in the first century what seemed to be the answer came as many begin to speak in tongues manifest gifts of the Spirit it was then believed that this was indeed the long awaited restoration it was not for the latter rain here we go can only come after the former rain which is the spring or teaching rain the lattering then is the Harvest rain how could this be the real thing when the teaching rain had not come the prophet messenger who was to be sent to teach the people and turn the hearts of the children back to the Pentecostal fathers had not yet come thus here we go what was thought to be the restoration and the final quickening unto the Rapture had not come it was a mixture of the unrighteous partaking of spiritual blessing and manifesting in the Holy Ghost as we have kept pointing out to you it is also was devil power as men were under the control of devils yet no one seemed to realize it then to prove it was not real these people even before a second generation appeared organized wrote unscriptural doctrines and built their own fences as every other group ahead of them did showing was the devil making a plan again to flip his burger and make some more denomination and the word continue on so when the Pentecostal rejected the prophet God come to the bride now come to sweep he said the the word will hunt them the word will find them so the word found you in Trinidad however it come to you if a drunk could bring it to you it was the way for it to come to you hallelujah praise God if somebody takes a B book and beat you in the head with it and leave you with it it was supposed to come there that way it doesn't matter how it come it was coming and if God could bring this spoken word to you the way he did what about the power what about the spirit what about the anointing that is to follow this word Oh Glory to God this word have a spirit to follow it oh give the Lord some Praises I I believe that with all my heart glory to [Applause] God I was a dead Catholic Stone dead tell somebody I was an acolyte and when I start to read the Bible the Gideon people came and Dro Bibles in the school and all my partners and what not through the Bibles on the garbage container and threw it away I kept mine I'm to read it and a scripture hit me Matthew 548 be there for perfect and I believe at that time maybe 14 15 that I am to be perfect and then when I finally call one father that's when I tell the priest that go and tell the Father the acolyte you know thinking I say I say the b say call no man father why you call your father father Leo well father give me one clout skate this float float down the the Isles father Leo he he that was the last of me you yeah that was the last yeah because I still call no man father and I I I I trying to apply the word now my God a dead Catholic and then afterwards brother I get in contact this message the first message I listened to I heard somebody invite me to the house listen to this invite me but the prince is deceased now from San Fernando South and he said he put on white cry speak play the whole message and afterward afterward he watch me like me do you believe that prophet he was he was Shar and yes first hu first step I hear eager cry when I come to my mother I tell my mother I said Mommy I want to go to church

forget what voices say God said there's going to be Revival there's going to be Revival God said the power going to strike the church the power going to strike the church God said there'll be a restitution of all things there's going to be a res of all things brother the people of God are being made ready by the word of truth from the messenger to this age in her talking about the bride will be the fullness of Pentecost for the spirit will bring the people right back to where they were at the beginning and that is thus sayth the Lord could we give a lot a shout in the house the spirit will bring the people back to where they were at the beginning and that is thus sayth the Lord so that is why he could say when a church is groaning under the persecution of the outside world that the Holy Ghost is just as real as it was at Pentecost when they are born and positionally born then God sets in the church pastors and teachers and Prophet evangelist that's why you could say that because you see Dynamics is what could produce a 54 Ministry not I have a gift and I here for 40 years not that that not no F Ministry that I here for 40 years but when the dynamic come and positionally place that's a different thing alog together that will be the ministry of Jesus Christ there a man trying something and saying a few words and I hope these few words Bless you that's not that oh give the Lord some Praises glory to God Peter wasn't saying I hope these few words bless you he said this is that that the prophet Joel spake of this is the stone that you Builders refuseed Hallelujah glory to

things T them up oh praise God all right you could take some more all right Maybe Might first time might at 3:00 this evening 12 keep laughing one when I run to 3:00 no laughing already laughing go when Adam sinned by heing his wife reasoning instead of holding to God's word that's what Adam s his wife reason with Satan then produced a product to Adam and Adam turn lose the word so out he lost also his inheritance when he lost his inheritance and right to life remember the day you thereof that day you'll die when he lost his life here we go he also lost his inheritance in life because he had complete Supreme control of the earth he was a god of the earth God the god of the universe everywhere but his son had his Earth under his control he could speak he could name he could say he could sub nature he could do anything he wanted to but when he did that he lost his inheritance watch now the the Bible said in whom we have obtained inheritance this is where your faith get challenged because you might be right now you might be where you're supposed to be in God right now but this is still the truth remember this and I want you to remember this clearly tonight Jesus didn't wait for his disciples to catch the full understanding before giving them the promises during the Journey of him them following him he said the same works I do shall you do also he keep giving them promises that they didn't have the faith yet to handle note when he raised from the dead he opened the word and understand it to them because it bring Clarity because they were participating in his ministry but they was not yet converted they didn't have an inside change they had a holy ghost upon them giving them the authority to cast our devils and do stuff that is a measure of the spirit upon them it wasn't in them he said if I don't go the comforter will not come and he going to be with you even in you so the prophecy for them was this spirit Power was going to be in them not just upon them do you understand that so it could be upon you but not in you but the promise is for it to be in you do you get that now so he had to bring Clarity to the church and to the Believers that this thing we're talking about called the comforter or the Holy Ghost have to come inside of you but you have to wait and carry until you get power from on high oh glory to God I give them the word father they have received Thy word but powerful and high come in oh the Lord I shout Jesus pray that prayer they have received the word but Paul was coming and you have received the words of Malachi 4 you have received the word of the end time message but it's coming it's coming it's coming it's coming oh give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah Give the Lord some Praises it's coming it's coming it's coming Hallelujah the word is spirit Spirit is word the word is life all right but Bram an inheritance somebody has to leave you something to inherit is it you don't have an inheritance if my father or grandfather leave me a land or house that's an inheritance I can say my father left it for me or my grandfather or my great-grandfather this is my inheritance that have a right to it isn't not right so to get inheritance somebody to leave it for you an inheritance what inheritance do we have what inheritance did we have God left me an inheritance now this have nothing to do with whether you deserve it or not so it's not you know I could b a sin I fail I fall I don't deserve that that's not the way to think God left me an inheritance when he put my name on the L Book of Life you say wait a minute brother Jesus did that when he died for you no never Jesus come to purchase that inheritance for me he said watch obtain an inheritance look predestinated us to inheritance all right if God is looking at my heart and say will randam I called you a long time ago before the foundation of the world to preach the gospel I have an inheritance an inheritance of eternal life now God sent Jesus to make that inheritance real to me now once you talk about foundation of the world before sometime it's difficult to even grasp that or conceptualize that because you see in you now you are challenged to believe that you as a SE son existed in God's mind as a thought you have to believe that regardless of how you are now look at you you were in the loins of your is the great-grandfather you were on your way since then you know I'm not talking about your mother and your father you know I'm talking about before that you know was God is see Generations before I think the fourth or fifth and he see it coming down so you couldn't miss being here you are not a mishap and they were supposed to bought you no that that that that's not true you were ordained to be here however you come you have to be here now this egg and sperm thing is a mystery by itself how that does work out but yet you come so then when you multiply that number and see he thinking in God's mind he put you in Adam you are seed of God that come down through generations or whatever it is and here you are and God is telling you that this fall we call fall was given the opportunity to display his attributes and to to to display self but he's bringing right things back to even because God is just he just balanced the scales so this battle that of the devil is about to come to a complete end he come to finish it off so when he come to the Jews his people and they rejected it he said I will take that Gentile bride so he hunted you since that time and now we about to finish it off because we are the seventh age seventh messenger messenger got seven visions and one of them was this woman stepping in America to rule America Before Destruction and we see everything setting up now like a chess game H the queen coming into position right now Hallelujah coming into position and destruction lining up and Russia killing time and Ukraine killing time and Hamas killing time and Israel came in time they're waiting for things to get into position I wonder they wait for the Bri to come into position I didn't hear you I hear you I he we not watching them we are watching the word oh give the Lord a shout the sign for us is not outside the sign for us is inside when you could see what is promised glory to God then you will understand that the next step is for you to break into your time of life because God told God told Abraham I will return unto thee when according to the time of life and Sarah going have a son there's going to be a price Revival there's going to be a seven ton of Revival according to the time of life am miss the restitution of all things there'll be a return of power there'll be a return of the anointing there'll be a return of the gifts in the Church of wisdom of healing of faith of Miracles every gift will be back in the church Glory there will be a super Church there will be a super race Hallelujah bam we are waiting he lost his godship Adam he lost his sunship he lost his domain Satan took it over but brother we are waiting for the manifestations of the sons of God will come back and take it over again waiting for the fullness of time when the pyramid gets to the top

message is to restore back again to bring back that same thing all right so God say I will return unto you according to the time of life that is the promise he made through the prophet I will come back this is not the prophet saying that this is God Amen veiled in a prophet amen in that time Elohim take some dust and step into it and come to Abraham a man Elohim and say I will return unto thee according to the time of life and the prophet stage he could say you can say this me I will ride this Trail once more next 28 days Sarah will come back into her monthly cycle she'll come back into the cycle of Baron next 28 days I know something going to happen to change this woman called SAR but brandham God through a seed of his word and there's only one thing that can Quicken the word and that is the spirit for it is the lifegiver to the word here we go and when the life in the word meets the life in the spirit the life of the spirit it produces whatever the seed is so the word itself have a portion of life but that word has to meet the life of the spirit and that is how it could be transformed he's talk about the body is waiting for the life which is the spirit to confirm it or make it alive no other life will work in her she can come to life any other way so why manufacture why pretend why must we act like we have something when we don't why must we do like we have it when we have it to get because it's coming it's coming it's coming she cannot come to life any other way words you have a big big engine and coming with a motorbike battery to start it stean put a bulb on that and like the home that motorbike that motor bicycle battery cannot start the car he say no other life would work in it therefore the life of Charity the life of Lov which is the Dynamics which is the spirit not Pentecost you shall receive power after what the Pentecostal experience in 906 no after the Holy Ghost which is the person come upon you so this person of Faith virtue knowledge that right on up that person is what you have to receive oh my H nor life will work in her she can't come to life any other way she feels it out there she knows it's going to happen oh praise God so Elohim was veiled in this Prophet isn't that right and that is what and that sample of what was done in this last day was reflected in what happened to Abraham isn't that right that we will return unto thee according to the time of life isn't that right on Elohim you know Elohim is the seven perfect Spirits before the L ghost word so in the beginning was the word logos before the beginning was Elohim Spirit seven perfect Spirits before the beginning then the beginning L word before the beginning spirit in the beginning word word created Lucifer Lucifer was that angel he was not before the beginning he came in the beginning because in the beginning was the word a word is a thought expressed now therefore before the beginning where you and I came from we were taughts in God's mind not yet expressed so God Express us and put us as a seed from the thought attribute In the Flesh that we can tempted here on the earth so we bypass our offy the word that we could come down in flesh that we could face the music and face life that he C Sun then going to school then struggling then Jesus is a carpenter Jesus is a little child Jesus growing up you could go through all aspects of human life but you are Gene and Jour some point in time this word have to hit you meet you connect with you when he connect with the woman of the well he said I just speak to you am he that word who held her name release her from her past release her from her condition and could pass her into the upper room the word said philli come here Peter come here the word calling back attributes he said all the father hath given me shall come all of them that was in God's mind when Jesus walking he was calling them by name oh give the Lord a shout they couldn't miss it if they tried Hallelujah they couldn't miss it if they tried Peter denied Christ but he was the word he had a germ inside of him he had to come to Pentecost I don't care what your struggle is this morning you have to come to your Pentecost you have to come to your time of life there's a time of life in the time of the restitution of all things glory to God give the Lord some Praises Give the Lord some Praises all things has been restored by the message of Malachi 4 the word is fully restored trying to get out of here oh my my my my Glory you'll be seated we have a question for you when Elohim came in flesh and talk to AB and Sarah s laugh in her heart what SAR laugh she I didn't laugh you lying she got get killed but her husband was a covering what if her husband wasn't her covering she did wife respect your husband amen bar say only because of Abraham God and killer we ly in the presence of God do you get that so watch something when he say I will return what form did he come in another man so why these ministers parading a beef all around the world brother George who playing Elohim who playing son man who playing Min man who playing special man Trin man all kind of they have now what wrong with the beef why these flesh pots parading the beef around the world presenting theel as they could do this for the bride when the example was there Elohim veiled in flesh spoke to Abraham I will return unto the according to the time of life and Sarah will have a son that Elohim did not come back in flesh it was the spirit that came back no man hand on that one day when Sarah wake up she said oh my good look at this handsome man AB done change already you know when Abram look at Sarah he said but I didn't recognize your so beautiful woman both of them change Hallelujah Sarah see a cycle and Sarah was able to bring forth Isaac what about this bride one of these days The Headstone the spirit the Capstone the anointing which strike your body like Sarah like Abraham you shall be changed a body change in a moment in a twin of an eye oh give the Lord some Praises so therefore the visitation of another time of life oh let me change those words the time of life is the time for the spirit to be active and present to work in through and by you oh my Hal Hallelujah brother he said I'm going to visit you I personal I'm going to visit you according time of life you're going to have that baby that you're waited for then he said these words here the latter rain is fixing to fall you have held that seed in there long enough now un believing you are looking for a coming son and he is coming that's the real church today you have been looking for him and I'm going to send him to you glory to God him but Abram says Abraham call him Elohim that's the almighty that's a self-existent one he was the word Elohim so Elohim is the word and El is the spirit because the word is also Spirit Hallelujah now you see why I've been so zealous of the kind of seed I've planted for the body the rain is going to fall pretty soon now I mean the real rain so if people feel that they see something by George they see nothing it's coming it's coming it's coming it's coming it's coming still coming Hallelujah give me a church full of the Holy Ghost God will do in one year what all theology failed to do in 2,000 years you wait till the anointing of the church really strikes home to that Faithful Little Remnant then he dropped this bomb after the doors of the Gentile is closed God will anoint the church then oh glory to God so friends wake up inside of here the door is about to be closed maybe GH had to pull the door already I don't know but one of the days it going to be closed what are you going to do about it oh give the Lord a shout in the house after Abraham pleaded for lot if there going to be 50 40 and God said for 10 I I wouldn't judge Sodom they couldn't find 10 and B explained that 10 means Christ in 10 men if he had found Christ spirit and 10 men he couldn't judge s because those men H would be held like a token amen for the whole city so he dispatched the angels to get them lot of and his wife couldn't hold steady and Jesus said remember Lot's wife if you remember Paul if you remember Andrew if you remember philli but one thing I want you remember L's wife she came out but what was in her heart is what throw her down and that's what going to people the own heart see when somebody heart attack this say inside job right the heart on the attack and if your heart is not right expect an attack get your heart right oh praise God hallelujah all right we on page 10 s for the musician continue preaching if musici you wrapping up and but if leave musicians out you just keep pumping so what what I can say musicians be alert just for you all right brother Bram he's talking about he said um Daniel read the same books we read same passages and same messages that we at the end time oh Lord God we're nearing the end all the generation have died what will you do now Lord and he set himself in order to pray and then Bown said oh God if there ever was a time that we ought to be setting ourselves in order to pray it's now it's now I understand there'll come scuffers in the last days I understand Nation shall be nation in last days I understand there'll be tidal waves fearful sights flying sours mysterious sights perplexity of time distress among the Nations I read they were going organization I understand that the preachers will be false shepherds in the last days as much as they don't want to believe that it have that big churches night churches but they Falls that will compromise and will not feed the people the word of God they will use this message as condiments afterwards after they preach their own thoughts you like ketchup mustard and and pepper you open it and you just dwting on it so them have their own message and they they take butter BR thing thing you and the people so deceived they're sitting on accepting that foolishness I a come to hear another man message I a come to hear some CUO Revelation the go and a prophet he says say what he tape say because in the tape is laying Rapture in fith I understand the preacher said we for in the last days compromise go after Creeds but I understand there'll be a voice in the last days crying out in the wilderness calling the people back to original message back to the things of God I understand in the last days there'll come a famine the churches will be so organized so set and everything else in the last days there'll come a famine it will not be for bread and water only but for the hearing the true of God and the people will go from east west north south seeking to hear the true word but the churches will be so organized and tighten up they will fail to hear it hear this BM understand that he sent Elijah before that day comes at the end time he'll have a message that will turn the house of the children back to the fathers turn them back to the original go back to the end and start I understand that that takes place just before the spirit leaves the Gentile Church to return to the Jews do you understand church that the spirit we talking about going to leave the Gentiles yes sir to sign off the Gentiles and go to the Jews yes sir and that is how judgment come in with preaching to Eternal loss people who cannot be saved people who hear the message and play the fool for years that still have to come and hear it when it's out these signs and wonders now they come to church now they justay Hallelujah Glory door shut I always talk about the foolish versions word is spirit Spirit is word so even if they go to BU they didn't have the word in them to turn into spirit because the secret is the word is in the bride the kingdom is the word turn spirit and power in your life so when you come it might be dry it might be hard but you're getting the spirit Prophecy of the word Mary she was hearing prophecy all along but she thought was any virgin she wasn't thinking about herself you know when the angel appeared to Mary he said the Lord is with thee blessed a d among woman she's singled out identified and confirmed that she is the Fulfillment of the prophecy from Isaiah shall con so when the word come the word to come to identify where you fit into the prophecy come back to the Homeland to the beginning back to the Pentecostal experience like it happened at the Pentecost when the part of the Living God changed those thousand of people and set their heart of flame with the fire of God God cut off the Jews purposely and blinded their eyes so we could have a chance to see given us an opportunity and we walk around like we are somebody Paul said take heed how you do that take heed for if God spared not a natural Branch how would he have more Mercy on the wild Branch M come on please page 12 of 17 what talking about the Gentiles there's a lot of time nobody knows when it will be it's a mystery remember in this great time of persecution this is the yet to come there's millions of Gentiles will die in that do you understand this prophecies here just as weighty as Hol receiving the Holy Ghost he said millions of Gentiles will die in that that rejected bride that remnant of the woman seed sleeping virgin she goes right through that Hallelujah then he talk about the magnet the holy ghost that headstone is the Holy Ghost Christ and every one of us that got the magnet ISM of the Holy Spirit when that stone strike the image the church would flee to it the Jews are in the Homeland we in the end of the age ready for the Rapture the Rapture comes the church goes up we are caught up to meet him in the air we all know that the stone that was cut out of the mountain is ready to come at any time when it come what does it do it does away with the Gentile age so we talking about Dynamics right Stone cap Stone super Church were race but do you understand when Dynamics come finish in the GLE age the same rain that Noah is waiting on to float the boat has kill the people in do you get that the the the ark need water to float the rain is coming to lift the boat up Noah to be saved need the water and that same water killing the people judging them in the but says the stone that was cut out of the mountain is ready to come at any time and when it come what does it do it does away with the Gentile age it is all over and God completely quits dealing with them let him that's filthy be filthy still what is the filthy that's the sleeping virgin that comes up for judgment we over here he actually called a sleeping virgins the filthy to restore means to return to the former owner to bring back to the former state of condition we can enforce a claim to be restored oh praise to restore is to bring back to claim a claim can be enforced so therefore you this morning could actually get a claim to be restored Hallelujah to means to bring back it right to his rightful owner and to restore is to bring it back to who really owns it praise God one more thing I'll close this is fast so the Jubilee means when the individual lost the inheritance every seven years had a Sabbath and every seven days had a Sabbath and seven years and seven years there a Sabbath and every seven Sabbath was 49 years and the 5 years was a jubilee and this Jubilee every man that had lost inheritance by some means he was Freeborn true blooded Israelite no matter who held the position it had to go free and what a picture of us tonight today in the church you see a man can do and when you see what God does What man does is failing and will fail and has fail but what God does is eternal and one of these days the kingdom of this world will fall they could hold back he said but when there will come a prophecy Another Year of Jubilee we have had it about this time if you notice Pentecost is fill in America but when you begin to see the Year of Jubilee when we don't have to fuss and strain and pull like that oh praise God I'll close with this final quote and the Bible said in the last days that Satan would go about like a roaring land he is gathering together all his enemies all his friends our enemies and congregating them together heaping them for a big head mark of the beast in the Ecclesiastes friend the Holy Ghost Revelation 156 there's one in white linen waving himself up and down the waters soring by him that they forever and ever when the things happen time shall be no more time shall be no more he swore when we see these nations breaking and things the mystery of God will accomplish and I believe that the age has come now that the miraculous the phenomenal the baptism of the spirit and power and signs and wonders this great outpour of the God's spirit in the last days okay this great pouring out of God's spirit in the last days that's the thing that will bring fate into the people that will take a rapturing fate and take the church into Glory that's the faith what is it this great big O point of the spirit praise God praise God let's get back that prophecy brother SE let's put it back on as we close with this hallelujah praise God I want to hear it again we close up with this one blessed be the name of the Lord thank you Jesus thank you Jesus oh give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah [Music] Jus H he h h [Music] [Music] it's coming it's coming it's coming it's coming the mighty power of the Living God y
