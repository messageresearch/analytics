read from verse 6 for a scripture reading amen certainly a privilege to be here tonight and greet you in the precious name of Jesus Jesus Christ just a one portion of scripture we want to read in here 1 Corinthians 10 and verse 6 and it says now these things were our examples to the intent uh that we should not lust after evil things as they also lusted amen let's bow our heads for word of prayer almighty God we thank you to be in your presence father father Lord we thank you Lord that at your feet we can gather Lord feel your presence and be taught by you tonight and to learn of you Lord

tonight father we just pray that you just come and anoint the scripture in your own wonderful way father Lord we surrender now and pray for a few moments that you just uh anoint us with your presence as we as we Feast on your word uh granted almighty God we pray and ask in Jesus name amen and amen you may have your seats praise God it's certainly a privilege to be here tonight and uh it's always a privilege to be in the house of God uh we see the pages of time moving uh in a very interesting way as the year closes and uh we know that God is still in control uh but prophecy must also be fulfilled amen uh but before the end could come uh this gospel must be preached uh into all the world as a witness and then the end shall come uh so we're not too bothered about the evil signs we know that those things will happen um but we know that God promised to pour out his Spirit upon the church in the last day and that's what we're here for tonight amen I have a title uh for this portion of service tonight and God will help us by the way to unfold this as we go along my thought tonight is examples that's my title tonight examples and the scriptures we read 1 Corinthians 10 and verse 6 and I want to read it in the amplifi just to get a make expanded version of it it says with now these things the warnings and admonitions that took place as examples for us that we should not crave evil things as they did that's the example uh the Amplified version of that scripture we just read and so it's an interesting thought and we just wanted to zoom in on this word examples and an example simply put is a reference point isn't that right it's a it's a point of reference uh when we look at an example of something it helps us to make the picture of what we're trying trying to talk about or what we're trying to convey a little more clearer to the person who's meant to receive the message you know the challenge of sending a message is UN whether the recipient of that message is going to get the message the way that they're meant to get it so sometimes to make that message more clear it's good to have an example uh something you could point at something that you could show that helps convey the message and make it more clear uh it's one way it's one it's good to use words but it's it's also good to have something even tangible in front of you that you could see and point at and say here's an example uh and I genuinely believe tonight that that is what all this word and God sending us a prophet in the last days uh was all about because we are supposed to be living examples of what God Said would hap happen in the last days uh I genu believe that God is going to raise up a group of people that are going to be living examples that are going to be living testimonies that are going to be written Epistles read of all men so that people could take note and the whole purpose of God being able to say here is my beloved Son or here is my beloved daughter in whom I am well pleased hear ye him or hear ye her what is God really saying in other words here is an example of what I was talking about you heard about sons of God being raised up in the last days but God wants to be able to point his finger at somebody in the last days and say here is an example of living right here is an example of somebody who pressed through here is an example of someone who prays here is an example of a Christian Life I believe God tonight is trying to raise up living examples oh Halle in this last days oh hallelujah hallelujah of here's my spirit flowing freely God wants someone so Anointed with the presence of God that they could live their lives and as an example of how it means to live a Christian Life what it means to walk a Christian way what it means to say no to the devil what it means to receive the Holy Ghost what it means to have a life that is so influenced by the scripture what it means to have a life oh somebody help me tonight what it means to have a life that is so influenced by the spirits that you become a living example a written epistle a walking testimony a walking pyramid of here is my spirit flowing freely here's another one over there here's this one over there I can touch him I can place her God wants tonight living examples oh somebody help me praise him oh Hallelujah glory to godall so an example is a reference point it can be used as an illustration Hallelujah that we can use to carry over a teaching or a principle that we are trying to communicate or Express and God has many things that he's been trying to communicate and express to us through his word and you know we have the written word but now what we needed was an expression of that word to make it real to make it alive to have skin on it and that's why the word became flesh and dwelt among us we beheld his glory the glory is of the only begotten of the father because yes the Pharisees and the Sadducees had the written word h but here was the Living Word expressed oh Hallelujah isn't that right walking among them Healing The Sick raising the dead casting out Devils he was living something among them he was an example oh that they could look at and say there goes one oh that the spirit is following oh hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right so it can be used as a benchmark talking about examples right a standard that can be set you could use an example as a standard that's right that's right yeah setting an example in other words so if God give example of how we want to do a certain thing or he wants a certain thing done that becomes the basis by which he will operate the second time because it's based on the example that was shown isn't that right oh the early church that was uh filled with the Holy Ghost Amen in the upper room is an example to us hallelujah because God promised to pour out the spirit again in this end time and we have a book of Acts which is not the Acts of the Apostles in that way but it is the acts of the Holy ghost in the apostles that were positionally placed by fire and that is an example to us tonight of how God wants the church to come back to uh throughout the ages we have fallen away from these great examples and Church begin to organize isn't that right they organize after Wesley they organized after Luther they organized after the Pentecostals raise up but what God wants to come back to what he is longing to come back for is for a church that he has already shown an example of in the book of Acts when this church Rises up there are actually going to be a continuation of the book of Acts in other words what that means is God is going to raise you and I up tonight to be a continuation of the examples that he has set in Scripture of how men were positionally placed by the Holy Ghost and the prophet said when God has set in the church some Apostles some prophets some evangelists some pastors when God releases the baptism of the Holy Ghost when God releases the spirit and positionally places Sons and Daughters of God in these last days they are going to be a continuation they are going to be living examples they are going to be living written Epistles read of all men God wants to make an example out of you here tonight oh can we praise him can we praise him God wants to be able to boast about you tonight and tell the devil look at him look at her nothing against them chose a Perfection upon them it's God in them working there working his way out it was God in you tonight working your way out of every trial working out of your way out of every test working your way out of every storm working your way out of every mind battle something in you just wouldn't give up something in you just wouldn't let go why because you are raised up for such a time as this to be a living example God put something in your all that the devil didn't give and the devil cannot take it away somebody give the Lord a [Applause] shout hallelujah glory to godj so this is the fire us up tonight to let us know that God allowed things to happen all throughout scripture and even in our lives as example to help illustrate the point because it's one thing to see it but it's another thing to experience it to see it tangible to hold it in front of you uh you had to go through stuff God always have his men to go through stuff isn't that right Moses was a great intellectual he was raised up as a prince in the house of Egypt isn't that right he was raised up a certain way but uh God had to beat all that out of him and bring him through God's School of character training only when he experienced God's way could he walk in God's way that's outside of that he was walking in his own way he was walking in Egypt's way he was walking in the way that he was taught by those Egyptian schools but God has his own school tonight God has his own way of doing things God has his own way of making the nails real making the scars real so that when you come through that experience you know where you're standing at you could tell somebody I've been through the fire and I know he is God I've been through the storm and I know he is God because when everything else was Stripped Away God Was Made Real in my prayer he was made real in my testimony oh he's the only thing that I'm chasing after tonight money has failed me popularity has failed me material things has failed me but the word of God can never fail and when everything else Falls away the word of God will still stand it will still be sure oh and we are standing tonight on the word of almighty God he promised to deliver you he promised to restore he promised to make a way he promised to fill you with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and Fire that is not your word that is God's word and we believe God's word tonight oh Hallelujah Hallelujah glory hujus and I can safely say that being 35 years old has changed me in a lot of ways I'm not what I was when I was 25 I'm not what I've seen when I was 15 all the things that God allowed me to go through has broken me in some ways shaped me in others and I know it's his predestination for me and I believe you could have the same testimony tonight that God passed you through different trials and situations and storms to make his presence real to you to make his word real to you because it's one thing to talk about God but it's another thing to experience God and because because your praise becomes different when you come to church and you've been through something and somebody sitting next to you hasn't been through something that's all right they're waiting on their shout you already got yours because you went through the trial you went through the storm you went through the depression you went through the frustration and somehow in the midst of all that mess God proved his love to you God opened up his alabat the box for you God showed you who you are that you are a child of the king and that you are his own and that no weapon formed against you could ever Prosper that's why he allow weapons to come against you but he didn't let him Prosper he allowed you to go through trials some through the waters some through the flood some through great trials oh we cried in the night when nobody was watching we cried in a shower how could this happen to me uh yet through it all I learn to trust in Jesus I learn to trust in God because the tears will bring you closer to the shepherd the tears will bring you closer to the master that's why he allowed you to go through stuff to make your Christian experience real to you and I hallu that you know it's not a game you know that if it wasn't for God your story would have been a different story I could have had a really different story but Jesus came down and he broke past he he bur past all my all my thoughts and he saw my needs and he stretched forth his hand to Calvary and pulled me through the myy clay he pulled me up he put my feet on a rock oh some of us here tonight the only reason we are standing is because he pulled us up his strength was perfect in your weakness he reached down and pulled you up out of the Mary clay and he set your foot upon Rock he is the only reason you could come into this church tonight and raise up your hands and give God a shout of praise that's why the devil can't take my praise oh Hallelujah if you haven't been through nothing it's okay you can keep quiet if you haven't been through a trial it's okay you can keep quiet but if you've been through a storm if you know that God you did you know that you know that he's the same yesterday he's the same DayDay he's the same forever if you know that he's a bread on your table the clothes on your back he is the shoes on my feet he put a song in my heart tonight Hall when you go through that and you know that it's real then the devil cannot take it out of you because it doesn't matter how many storms you go through what God put inside of you as an anchor what God put inside of you is a rock it's a rock solid fate that Crips The Rock which is Jesus Christ that rock is Jesus he is the one that rock is Jesus God's only son be very sure that your Anchor Holds and grips the solid rock amen and amen hallelujah hallelujah glory to God so in life and even in the scriptures there are good examples and there are bad examples we're talking about examples tonight right the broad brush spectrum of it examples are examples it's like good and bad hallelujah it's like it's like leadership leadership most of the times we think of leadership as a good thing leading people in a good way but leadership as a broad brush there's good leaders and there's bad leaders it all depends on which way the tree is leaning isn't that right it's just like parenting parenting as a spectrum is what it is it's parenting but there's good parents and there's bad parents and there's no book like brother always to say book book of parenting where you could say we're doing it by this book there's no school that says this is how you're supposed to do it so if that be the case then as Christian parents and as Christian Le leaders we ought to lean on God for wisdom and understanding because God himself is a leader and God himself is a parent God himself is an example he's someone to follow he's a a point of reference he he gives context to life in a way that we would not usually out of had outside of the scripture uh we would do things according to our own mind that's right according to our own Fashions because who we are is how we lead and our environment is a natural reflection of our leadership the environment we create is a reflection of who we are as individuals it's very important your home it's a reflection of of who you are the things around you the things that are in your charge that are in your care that God put into your hands to take care of our reflection of of who you are isn't that right and God Is A Healer Hallelujah and that is a reflection of who he is in other words he's a he is he can heal because he is a Healer he can love because he is love he can help you because he is our help oh isn't that right oh he is a rock for us he is a fortress for us because that's what he is isn't that right Hallelujah and the proof of scripture throughout the Bible as we see God unfolding himself in different ways and in different attributes only gives a reflection of who he is because in him was these attributes uh locked up all the time he was always that but he just didn't have an opportunity to show what he was so that's why he passed through the Wilderness and he he he threw the uh had down at the bitter Waters in memory and so forth like isn't that right and uh told them to hold up the brass serpent with Moses and and and all these things that happened throughout scripture was to show that he was a provider that he could provide that he could restore because he is a restorer he can restore oh hallelujah hallelujah and God wants a bride on the earth tonight that can reflect the same because you can't give it if you don't have it so God found a way through Jesus Christ to bring Perfection to us so that he can get into us this pyramid so that when this is in you you become the scripture and then you could say like Peter Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have give I unto you because healing was in he could heal the lame man oh Hallelujah because virtue was in him it could flow out of him and touch the lame man and raise him up at his point of need oh God wants to fill you with himself so that all that he is could be inside of you so that when you walk the streets of Trinidad and Tobago all of God would be poured into you tonight that you could be a living expression a living example of God on the earth Healing The Sick raising the dead casting out Devils because if you have the same spirit that Christ had in him when he was on the earth if he heal the sick if you have the same Spirit then you also will heal the sick if he raise the dead then you'll raise the dead because it's the same spirit it's the same life therefore it does the same works oh that he did oh then if he overcame you will overcome somebody give him a shout if he stood the test then you also will stand the test oh and if he came through the Wilderness you're going to come through your Wilderness because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world oh greater more powerful all the examples he show in the Bible of who he was was will be in the church in the last days the same things that he did the same examples he set Hallelujah because he is the example seed son of the scripture isn't that right hallelujah oh glory to God he said I do nothing thank you unless my father show me first isn't that right so they're good examples and they're bad examples isn't that right Hallelujah isn't that right and so God is a leader and one of the ways he leads is by example it's one of the ways that he leads you know gives examples and I like it because now we have a clear picture of what is expected we have a clear picture of what happens when we do right and what happens when we don't isn't that right and as I like to say in life we're always learning something either we're learning what to do do or we are learning what not to do but at every instance you're always learning something that's the way it is and when we see life as this great school or book of training and learning then I think it changes our perspective begin to appreciate all the things that come upon our doorstep because now we're seeing it as learning opportunities for us to embrace and when even when things don't go the way we expected we can ask God how to go about it how to deal with this and now it provides an opportunity for God to show himself as who he is because when we run out he's just getting started oh and when we can figure out he knows exactly what to do next oh because daddy is just that good at getting things done oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Hallelujah Glory so have you spoken to your daddy yet tonight Daddy knows you know my son the the electricity went out last night and he asked for Titi I said okay so had to go and make the Titi with boiling water and everything and all of a sudden a moth came in the room and started flitting about and started running around and making a lot of noise you know um in the roof in the ceiling and he's like Daddy Daddy Daddy Daddy fix the problem daddy there's a moth you know and he's starting to freak out and now regardless of whether I'm afraid or not I am apparently daddy so so it falls in my lot to address the portfolio of Daddy and uh and get a side of a slipper and do the job you know and it had to be Fairless at the job too cuz this thing is moving really fast you know but it's I just watched it because I was amazed to see you know my son's confidence in Daddy he knew that I could do it that's amazing he didn't know my background he didn't know how I grew up if I could use a sling or not amen he just knew daddy could fix a problem and I genuinely feel like that's what real childlike faith is when we know that Daddy is just that good who my daddy he can fix any problem you bring your problems to Daddy and Daddy's got an answer oh and tonight our Daddy has an answer to every problem to every challenge to every mind battle to every sickness to everything that you are facing in life Daddy's got an answer oh have you spoken to your daddy today glory to go he's waiting to hear from you oh pick up that Royal telephone to glory and talk to your daddy tonight amen amen amen he's waiting With Arms Wide Open No Matter What sin it's as far as he EAS is from the see that's how far he has removed our transgressions from us so that we can come back into contact with our father we can speak to our daddy again amen and amen so he uses examples to teach us and he gives us examples to follow to teach us about his word and so forth amen isn't that right uh yeah so we went through all that amen and he unfolds himself in in others and here's the thing he gives us examples in the form of men and women who have have walked the Earth and throughout the scripture we could see these examples uh as we turn the pages I I find that to be one of the most wonderful things about scripture is that you know scripture the Bible is many things is a book of Prophecy it's a book of inspiration and knowledge and wisdom but one of the things that always blows my mind is that uh the Bible itself is a book of stories stories of men just like us women just like us similar challenges like us similar situations some of them having the same mind battles this they felt the same fears that you would have felt had you been in that situation and yet somehow throughout scripture we always see in its unfolding how the mystery of God in these people found its way out isn't that right it found its way out of them that when presented with the challenge of the hour something inside of them held on to a faith something they couldn't see with their eyes they weren't trusting in their own plan or their own idea they were trusting in God's plan they weren't trusting in God's idea about it they had an interest in what God has to say about it they had an interest in God's purpose and program and forsaken all else they pursued after righteousness forsaken all danger and Calamity and and and what would happen to them they threw caution to the wind at times in order to fulfill God's Own word and we could see that that is Faith it's only faith that can do that when your human reasoning fails something else kicks in and says no not this time something else kicks in and says if I perish I perish but I go in to see the king if I die I die oh what kind of Faith would do that it's not the faith of a man that's the faith of God in a woman that's a faith of God in a man who says I'll turn aside to see what the attraction is on the mountain a faith that God put in a man to say I go to tell phoh to let my people go that's God's faith oh hallelujah hallelujah think about yourself tonight what made you come here what made you accept the gospel what made you want to get saved what made you want to get baptized in water that's not the faith of a man that's the faith that God put inside your hearts that God put inside your soul to make you stand up and say yes I believe I believe every word that is written in this scripture I believe the words that are written in this book I believe that there is a God out there somewhere and though I can't see him with my hands the faith inside my soul says that he is real my faith says amen amen to the word amen to his promise amen my faith is anchored am in the Lord my faith brought me to church tonight my faith helps me to walk by it because I don't walk by sight I don't walk by the things that I can see I can't even trust my own eyes but I know if I hold Daddy's Hand tonight he can lead me through the valley he can lead me up the mountain he can lead me in the darkness because when I can't see no more he can see very clearly oh Hallelujah he's a God that sees oh hallel you may not be able to see him tonight but he can see you tonight oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah he sees you tonight and he hears you tonight that's why we should have confidence when we go to God In Prayer cuz we're not praying by what we could see with our eyes but our faith is what gives us eyes to see the possibility of a supernatural God in our lives a supernatural God in our walk a supernatural God intervening when we pray Hallelujah prayer is powerful pray is one of the greatest weapons that God had give to man men ought to pray and not to faint oh H isn't that right and even brother is talking about many examples in scripture about men in the Bible who offered a sacrifice and even our precious brother Isaac over is talking about altars on Sunday appreciate that word amen oh wonderful it was so timely and you know I was thinking about that scripture and I think brother was making an example of lot as well I think he was one that the Bible rarely ever records him offering sacrifice isn't that right and uh one of the other examples in scripture we could look at is also Samson uh Samson lifestyle was a kind of loose one isn't that right uh he wasn't a very prayerful individual a lot of what he did was about his own pride and his own testimony and his own proving himself isn't that right uh uh but it really didn't really glorify God in the truest way and uh when you look at it it's interesting because he has a man with so much promise he is a man with so much ability he is a man with so much physical strength um that seemed very impressive to the Natural Eye uh but because of a life that was UN prayerful uh because of a life that was so loose and unguarded uh all of that promise that was in Samson kind of died away and it's only in the end that God is able to redeem him when he told that boy to lead him to the pillars because he saw a possibility that he could somehow redeem himself after all that he had failed and flopped at uh and we think about that because here is an example of how a life could have been so different uh had he done differently had he surrendered more had he had not trusted his eyes and followed after this woman Delilah uh who entreated him and who deceived him into getting his haircut and losing his Covenant losing his testimony so friends it gives us it behooves us tonight to have wisdom and righteousness as we look through scriptures to see the examples that God give by his word and by the lives of men and women who come through the scriptures from chapter after chapter and book after book we can see how God used individuals and some of the key notes in these examples like surrender and prayer uh and humility and reverence and sacrifice and a clear understanding of God in the in the midst of their lives is what led them to make better choices than those who fell by the way because they couldn't mix the word that they were hearing with faith in order to receive what God was trying to bring them to a land of promise God wants to bring you tonight to a land flowing with milk and honey he wants to bring you into Prosperity Prosperity naturally Prosperity spiritually why because he wants to make you a living example he wants to be able to Point At You just like he point at job and say look at my man on the earth there's not another like him to call the devil and say take a look at this one have you considered my servant job you see he wasn't just any servant it's something special when God pointed you and said here is my servant he is someone who offers sacrifices he is someone who has an altar he is someone who has a prayer life here's someone who has a testimony that he pleased God oh hallelujah hallelujah he does something to show the faith Hallelujah that he professes to have in me Hallelujah there's an action be behind every word that he has that proves that he's there walking the talk amen and it's not just talk but he's walking the talk and tonight God wants men and women on the earth who could walk the talk amen amen can't just be all fluff you got to be able to walk in a holy way you got to be able to talk you got to be able to live it you got to be able to isn't that right preach it not everyone can stand on the pulpit but just says the prophet says you are a preacher uh and we are all preaching something where by the way we walk by the way we live by the way we act by the things that we do it creates an atmosphere around us words that we speak to others and doesn't matter where we are uh when we have the wisdom of God inside of us and it's really expressing itself outwardly um I believe it can change any situation the says a kind answer can turn away wrath I believe D tonight that there is a more excellent way and it's up to us tonight in this last day to find that excellent way and I believe God gives us the tools to find an excellent way and how to conduct our business and how to conduct our Affairs and how to be fathers and how to be mothers and how to be husbands and how to be wives God wants to equip us and I believe that's why he released these seven spirits excuse me into all the Earth seven manifestations of one Holy Spirit he released it in the last days to catch a brine so that we can live these things and be real examples of God on the earth that's the whole purpose you see so it ought not to be complicated amen but it ought to get pler as we see the the day approaching amen so God was so mysterious he wanted to unfold himself in a way that we could understand so he give us examples that we could follow in scripture and look back at what God has done isn't that right and we could use them as lessons isn't that right we needed an example we needed an example of a positionally placed son so what did he do he showed Adam in the Garden of Eden placed in the Garden of Eden here's a perfect example of God's son being placed in position isn't that right Bible said that God planted a garden Eastward called Eden and then he placed the man that he had created in that garden and plac him positionally in there and said Till the soil do the work isn't that right until the time will come for him to to to get a wife afterwards isn't that right and so he was placed positionally into that garden and here was Adam an example of God's original intent for man God used him as an example to show what he wanted for mankind since the very beginning isn't that right he would speak and it would create itself just like that he named the animals he showed and demonstrated before the devil got into the picture uh God allowed him to show and demonstrate his sunship on the earth for a time and a season so that we could have an example of what Eden condition is so that we know that when the prophet came in this last day and said little fishy I give you your life when he came and spoke and said son come out and Shine for 4 days we begin to realize that these examples that the prophet was even living in his time begin to look a little familiar to us it looked like something we've seen before in Scripture it looked like that man Adam when he was here on Earth he dis playay that same kind of a power and God's going to have a bride on the earth who's going to display that same kind of a power oh Hallelujah God had an example and he's going to have it one more time an example on the earth sons of God on the earth with spoken word power oh they're going to speak oh and the word of God will create itself just like that oh Hallelujah isn't that right just like Adam did Hallelujah God's original intent Hallelujah for man's existence on earth a time before sickness a time before disease before pestilence before strife and and enity and all these things uh uh there was a Peaceable picture uh and God allowed that example to flow on for a time and season knowing that all this fall would take place uh but God would bring us back to that picture picture again we have that picture in scripture we have that example in Scripture that gives us faith and it gives us hope to know that that picture will return again that situation that existed in Eden is going to come back again oh Hallelujah and a bride on the Earth is going to break in to the supernatural break in to her Eternal Church age and bring on another Eden bring on another Eden condition where men are going to walk the earth just like Adam did where women are going to walk the earth isn't that right holy and without Plame before him in love oh Hallelujah Hal isn't that right and you're going to be living examples isn't that right my God my God word became flesh in the trip report Prophet said in 1954 said what kind of people should we be now this was Adam talking about Adam and he was living in the spirit isn't that right that's right when he was on Earth he lived every day in the Spirit what a condition always in that realm it's only when sin came into the picture it changed and then he got cut off from that Spirit-filled life but he always had it up to a point in time isn't that right uh and and here's a prophet talking about how we ought to be in this kind of atmosphere amen as we see the day approaching uh paragraph 181 he says what kind of people should we be uh if the very if the very Holy Spirit has you so embodied or empowered that you don't use your own thoughts you don't use your own mind you don't use your own opinions but the Holy Spirit has you so built until your thoughts and your being is God's spirit expressing itself through you he said what kind of a church would we be what kind of a people would we be this morning and we say here tonight if this Bram Tabernacle he said was so filled with the presence of God why where you don't even use your own mind didn't even use your own thoughts didn't have no ultimate of your own but just to be led by the spirit oh that's the kind of church tonight that God's going to have in the last days a spirit-led church a spirit filled Church church do you believe it he said and they that are the sons of God are led by the spirit of God and then when the human element goes out and the spirit of God fills that vacancy where you empty yourself oh Hal you empty yourself you get all the trash out you boil out all the nonsense you get out all the idols all the things that you put before God God when you get that out then the human element goes out and then the spirit of God fills that vacancy how by the baptism of the Holy Ghost the spirit of God is Promised tonight to fill that vacancy in your heart oh God put a vacancy in there nothing in the world can satisfy nothing the world can offer can satisfy the longing in the hearts and The Thirst bursting in the soul for the filling of the spirit to fill that human heart inside of you oh Hallelujah that's what we need tonight that's what puts a fire in the soul that's what makes you get up in the morning it makes you acknowledge God as the first thing of your day a living presence that keeps you in the time of the storm like the prophet said you're not a hybrid plant hybrid plants you have to water it and pet it and and spray it every 2 seconds to keep the bugs off but when you are an original seed when you are an original plant you don't need to be hybrid you don't need to be petted and pugged oh Hal you've got something in you that keeps you in the storm and when the winds blow contrary you are mechanized you are designed for your roots to go deeper deeper in the love of God you get deeper into prayer you get deeper into consecration because you know that's where your strength comes from oh I need somebody tonight to be able to connect with their God on a deeper level and to understand that the fruits on top are own a reflection of the roots [Music] below the only reason you're standing is because of what he put you through made your roots go deeper now you pray more deeper now you seek God more deeper and all of a sudden out of that bears fruits of patience fruits of Love fruits of tenderness fruits of humility fruits of reverence fruits of Godly fear because of what he's putting you through in the roots no wonder God could have confidence hallelujah hallelujah say I will restore all the years that the cankerworm and the caterpillar and the Locust had eaten away from you you see they ate at the top they had a feast all on the top above the ground but the secret is the word is in the bride the secret is what's really going on below the half oh the other half has not yet been told how deep your roots go and that's why God can prophesy over your life because he knows how deep those roots go oh H you can say I will restore to you all the years that the devil had taken from you that the devil had taken from from your family that the devil had taken from your life and your prayer and your consecration I will restore it won't be by your might it won't be by your strength but the power of God unto salvation is going to rip you out of the world and into Glory it takes the power of God to do it and God's power is here tonight to give you the power oh Hallelujah to rise up and claim the all your promises for this last day oh hallelujah hallelujah oh do you believe it [Music] tonight they that wait upon the lordu shall weew their strength I love that scripture now more than ever because it means that when you wait on God there's a promise for you when you wait on him there's a promise for you all the stress and the worry of life that are that drained your spiritual battery that drained your heart and mind and drained your walk and made you weak and made you flimsy oh Hallelujah all of that stressing and worrying why don't you lay it on God tonight because they that wait upon the Lord shall in you there's strength there's a promise in the word for you if you don't mind waiting on your knees until God answer God will answer he's got to answer because you're his child and he's your daddy he's your father tonight and they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall walk and not be weary they shall run and not faint oh we ought to wait men ought to pray and not faint hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah glory to God hallelujah oh my what kind of people would we be this morning oh how if we didn't use our own thoughts see he just be moving in see what let me skip on down he fills the vacancy then will we be the when the church then uh amen then will be when the church when this Holy Spirit fills that vacancy then will be when the church went in its power of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus that church will walk in his steps in his power in his thoughts in his being Amen in his moving you see what I mean congregation says amen he said and then your thoughts will become words and your words will become material what you express will be an expression of what God has built up in you oh a Most Holy fate oh Hal that you could walk like the pyramid and you can begin to express these things and then your words become material oh h no wonder when the church is in his power we'll be able to speak the word and it'll flash like lightning because there's something in you that's reflecting who you are and what you believe isn't that right it's a spiritual house it's not something we could build with our hands it's not something we're doing with our own minds or with our own free will it's not turning over a new Leaf in that sense but it's the spirit of God when you lay down your own will when you put yourself on God's altar oh Hal isn't that right and offer yourself and say Lord live in me then you tear down your curtain of self-will and deny yourself the pleasures of this world for a greater pleasure just like Moses denied the pleasures of Egypt to be identified with modders so do we deny the pleasures of this world and all its skyscrapers and all its modernity that has failed Mankind we seek a kingdom that cannot be moved we are looking for a kingdom tonight that can stand the tests that can stand the storm that can stand the trials of life oh hallelujah it's not a book of positivity hallelujah it's not a book of of doing nice things it's a book of power and authority of the word that comes by the spirit giving life to that word making it live making us examples isn't that right oh my Hallelujah he said I believe it's on the road Prophet there's a prophet that when the church will be so wrapped in Christ Hallelujah the Holy Spirit Hallelujah mankind so away from themselves Hallelujah this is what I want tonight that they don't see themselves Hallelujah they don't uh but to serve God and their thoughts move on isn't that right Hallelujah they refuse the things of the world they just move in the spirit whatever God wants that's what I'll do I'll do nothing except the father show me oh the father work at H too and I work oh that's what God wants you to be just like his example seed son Christ was on the Earth you're going to walk in a holy way when you walk scripture will be fulfilled when you speak scripture will be fulfilled when you keep silence spirit will be fulfilled oh because you will have thus say the Lord or keep still that will be the bride in the last day a written epistle isn't that right Hallelujah move in the spirit Hallelujah live in the spirit walk in the spirit he says and so fulfill the law of Christ and then the law of Christ uh in the human heart moving in the Holy Ghost that great wonderful church will go forth with power and deity because deity will be revealed in human beings by the Holy Ghost bringing to pass the thought that is in their mind oh Hallelujah isn't that right we're going to come back to a time when as the Bible says holy men spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost we're going to have such a church where men will be placed women will be placed and whatever they say God will pack it up oh because he loves you and because you keep his Commandments and because your law abiding is uh in your heart oh H he's going to keep you in all your ways Les you dash your foot against a stone oh the Lord that keep it thee will not Slumber the Lord that keep it thee will neither slumber nor sleep for the The Lord Is Thy keeper The Lord Is Thy shade upon thy right hand and the son shall not SMY by day God love you so much he going to shade you from the Sun oh hallelujah hallelujah oh is that my God tonight oh nor the Moon by night he shall preserve thee from all evil he shall preserve Hallelujah th soul amen hallelujah and amenallah So speaking it was created see that's the atmosphere that Adam lived in that's it that is what's promised to return when we overcome isn't that right he that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I am overcome and set with my father in his throne Hallelujah that word in the prophet identified is Dominion to sit in his throne he said not on the throne but in the throne and Dominion is a territory Hallelujah and God has already outlined all the borders that we are to possess Hallelujah in this Ephesians end time Pride he's already outlined what the borders are spoken word power he's already said missing limbs are going to be restored the gospel is going to be preached the he the sick are going to be healed the lame are going to walk the blind are going to see the gospel preaching his power all of the borders have already been aligned now therefore Joshua Joshua the holy spirit is here tonight to take the people of God over to divide for them an inheritance and to possess the land that they know is their own oh do you know it's your land tonight claim your healing claim your deliverance claim the baptism of the Holy Ghost claim all your family claim your Revival claim your Holy Ghost outpouring let every one plade of grass cry out for their rain in the time and in the season for rain that season is here now of Faith declares it amen and amen oh wonderful oh my time is going let me hurry up you love him tonight amen my that's an example you have examples of Faith isn't that right when you want example of Fai we look to Abraham Abraham because before you was called Abraham he was called Abram called him and said walk before me and be there perfect H don't turn to the left side don't turn to the right but you just walk don't worry about it don't try to figure it out and Abram walked before God he didn't look to the left he didn't look to the right the Bible say he staggered not of the promise of God through unbelief but he was strong in Praise oh is strong in faith giving praise to God oh Hallelujah every day every morning he's going to a land that he knows that God will show him he's not trying to figure it out oh what an example of Faith how we ought to walk tonight oh just like Abraham walked Hallelujah when God called him Abraham and said you be the father of Nations Abraham looked up at God and said how can I be the father of Nations seeing is go tress and God said all right you have talks for me let me bring you outside of the tent let me bring you outside of the tent of your mind trying to figure out what I'm trying to tell you let me show you an example of what I'm trying to show you come outside and look at the Stars this is my example of how the sons of God in the last days are going to be look up at the stars and tell me if you can count them Abraham here's my example so shall I see be in blessing I Will Bless thee in multiply I will multiply to thee as the stars of the heaven you want an example get up and look at the stars oh Hallelujah and see what God has done count your blessings and name them one by one oh Hallelujah my last night the electricity went I got outside to check on things and I looked up and I saw the stars in all its Glory you know you wouldn't usually see that when there's a lot of lights around you in night time but it's only when the lights are out that's when you can see the stars in the heavens and sometimes you have to shut off the artificial lights in your life sometimes you have to turn off the things around you that cloud your vision that don't allow you to see God's glory and it's only when all those artificial lights go out that's when God's true light begins to shine down on your situation oh so tonight turn off those artificial lights turn turn off those things turn off that cell phone lights turn off that laptop lights turn off that TV lights get next to God and see if he don't show you all of his glory God's Great Cathedral of Glory in the stars of the sky oh Abraham's son was up in there and your promise of Deliverance is up there also your promise of breakthrough your promise of restoration the Zodiac God's first Bible he spoke it and it was and anytime God getting ready to do something here he expresses into the Stars don't you worry there will be a bride on the earth it's already spoken it's settled in the heavens forever so what are you worried about oh don't be anxious don't be anxious for tomorrow God's got it in control rest in God's promises rest in God's ability to settle your Affairs to settle your destiny your destiny is set in God oh Hallelujah I don't want to be a big shot I don't want to be a medium shot I just want to be what he wants me to be I'll be satisfied with that I'd rather be a door match in the house of my god oh that be a king in the tent of the wicked one that's what I want I want what he wants I believe there's a people on here tonight who wants what he wants tonight oh Hallelujah my God are you that kind of people tonight amen what an example of faith and he walked with God Prophet said I'm getting ready to close but steep he could come my time is out amen but this was wonderful Sydney appreciate you tonight amen oh my I really enjoyed preaching to you and as we get ready to close Prophet said we're like Abraham uh he said Abraham received the word and anything was contrary to the word he called it as if it wasn't and any trueborn child of God receive God's word he said and I don't care what anybody says what system speaks against that word that word is true anyhow and he said God is obligated to meet you on the basis of his promises outside of them promises he can meet you because you cut yourself off from him and he said that's the reason our world is falling apart in closing that we might say this he says anything that's contrary to it it's a though it wasn't such a madade system he said we never look to that no sir being then baptized into this Kingdom oh how by the baptism of the Holy Ghost you are baptized into this Kingdom isn't that right he said we are now sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus Oh My with our anointed king with us feasting on his kingdom promised word anointed and Vindicated right Among Us amen he says there it is his kingdom promise made right before us nothing can turn you from it no sir amen and amen do you believe it tonight praise God hallelujah hallelujah so we know Jesus was our example yes and then when he poured out his Spirit upon him in the upper room he made made them Witnesses unto him he made them written Epistles he made them examples Place sons and daughters in the kingdom of God Apostles prophets teachers Etc God placed a group Hallelujah into that early church there thank by the baptism of the Holy Ghost is that right that's the example he set to the early church and he said and now today what uh God wants to do the same thing today tonight to make us examples also amen God wants to make examples out of us you believe that amen that's just my notes here but here's a prophet here says in Revelation Jesus Christ let me show you another reason why Satan hates This Book of Revelation he knows that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever Hallelujah he changes not his example amen he knows that a whole lot more than 90% of the theologians the devil he knows that since God is immutable in his nature he's just immutable in his ways he's constantly God isn't that right thus Satan knows assuredly that the original church at Pentecost with the power of God St Mark 16 in action is the true church that Jesus claims as his own and all else is false it has to be oh so we want nothing less tonight than St Mark 16 in action go for Healing The Sick raising the dead casting out Devils that's the example he sets and we are raised up to receive the same holy ghost that Peter received the same holy ghost that Mary received the same holy ghost that James and John you are going to receive it and you are going to do the same works that they did when they were here healing a sick raising the dead casting out Devils freely as you have received freely do you give you could forgive you could repent you could fly away to heaven like they did because you're a living example of what they did with the same spirit in them same works that they did amen he said how can we turn that word to a system what does it do it denies the word you have to reject the truth before you can have an error that's exactly right you play something Me Softly you believe that congregation says amen all right he said well that's the hour we're living in the world is falling apart there hangs in the hangers bombs there hangs the things just to do it exactly weapons of of mass destruction right it's there already the prophet said the church is ready here's a prophecy she's sealed in ready to come Hallelujah there will be a big outpouring of the spirit yes sir oh let me say that again he said the church is ready here's a prophecy she sealed in ready to come there will be a big outpouring of the spirit yes sir to grab that church and take her into the skies exactly because the church the word the bride and Christ and his ministry is in his bride which is his body the celestial body the supernatural body of his here on the spiritual body on Earth his Spirit holy spirit is here living his life right out living his life right out of you here tonight oh Hal until him and the church becomes one in the wedding see they become one and he takes them just a little minority in the last days Hebrews 12:1 says wherefore we sing about we are compassed with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which do so easily beset us and let us run the race with patience the race that is set before us you begin to stand looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that set before him endured the cross despising the shame and was sat down in the right hand of the Throne of God Revelation 3:20 says behold I stand at a door knock If any man open my hear my voice and open the door tonight I will come into to him and I will s with him and he with meu to him that overcometh I will grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame Hallelujah sat down with my
