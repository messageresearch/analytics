[41:59] behold the bridegroom comment
[42:03] lamp trimming time
[42:06] boro branham 58 years ago said
[42:10] many of you people
[42:12] about my age
[42:14] when we use to use
[42:17] the coal oil lamp
[42:20] so it is safe
[42:22] to assume
[42:24] that many of the under 50s
[42:27] will be challenged
[42:29] even to have a clear understanding
[42:34] of lamb trimming
[42:36] today's people
[42:38] are acquainted with the flick of a
[42:40] switch
[42:42] dust dawn motion sensors
[42:46] and many other gadgets
[42:49] the scripture
[42:50] in matthew 25 verse 6 tells us
[42:54] at midnight
[42:59] there was
[43:02] a cry made
[43:06] behold the bridegroom comment
[43:09] go e out to meet him
[43:12] amen
[43:14] god's prophet is a message wrapped here
[43:17] paragraph 141 tells us
[43:21] the first thing comes
[43:23] when he starts descending
[43:26] from heaven
[43:28] there's a shout
[43:30] what is it
[43:32] is a message
[43:34] to get
[43:35] the people together
[43:37] a message come forward first
[43:40] now
[43:42] lamp trimming time
[43:45] rise
[43:46] and trim your lamp
[43:49] what watch was that
[43:51] the seventh
[43:52] not this week's
[43:54] the servant
[43:55] behold the bridegroom comet
[43:59] rise and trim your lamps
[44:02] and they did
[44:04] some of them found that they didn't even
[44:06] have oil in the lab
[44:08] but
[44:10] it's
[44:11] lamp
[44:12] trimming time
[44:15] behold
[44:17] the bridegroom comet
[44:20] and god's prophet is telling us
[44:22] that's what this shout
[44:24] is all about
[44:27] the shout
[44:29] a message to get the people together
[44:33] a message come forth first
[44:36] lamp train
[44:39] a look at the lamp
[44:42] the design we on this side of the wall
[44:46] is
[44:47] acquainted with
[44:50] there is a wick
[44:54] and a wick
[44:56] is made
[44:57] of a special material
[45:02] there is a wick
[45:03] and this wick has the ability
[45:06] to pull the oil
[45:10] there is you can see a jar
[45:13] and in that jar is where the kerosene or
[45:16] the oil will be
[45:19] that's the base of it
[45:22] so the wick
[45:24] literally draws up the oil
[45:27] and then the wick
[45:29] is lighted
[45:31] god's prophet called that week a picture
[45:34] of the true believer
[45:37] the believer is a real wick of god
[45:41] and in this week
[45:43] fire is on one end
[45:45] and the other end has oil
[45:48] hallelujah fire on one end
[45:52] the other end drops in oil
[45:55] and that's what make the fire
[45:58] and god's prophet identified us
[46:02] amen that's a picture
[46:05] of the real elected
[46:08] that's the picture tonight
[46:10] of a virgin
[46:12] with oil in the lab
[46:15] church friends
[46:18] those who are not acquainted with the
[46:19] lamp
[46:20] fire
[46:22] burning out of oil
[46:25] makes carbon
[46:28] so carbon
[46:30] is formed on the top
[46:33] of the wick
[46:34] as fire burns
[46:37] it makes carbon
[46:39] and carbon
[46:41] interferes with the light
[46:44] so so long you have a
[46:47] lamp
[46:48] there's something you need to pay
[46:49] attention to
[46:51] amen many of us as children would have
[46:54] been acquainted that uh you have to
[46:56] clean the shed
[46:58] that's only one part of it
[47:00] but the very wick
[47:02] it is regular use
[47:05] has
[47:06] received carbon
[47:08] and that carbon
[47:10] interferes
[47:12] with
[47:13] your light
[47:15] what happens after a while
[47:18] your wick
[47:19] ends up in a bad shape
[47:22] amen you wick
[47:24] start burning very low
[47:28] your wick
[47:29] will
[47:30] literally block your shield
[47:32] amen so it means one of the things you
[47:36] got to do
[47:37] is to get the carbon off
[47:41] it is a part it's something like i die
[47:44] daily
[47:46] in as much as you
[47:47] serving the lord
[47:49] you do things
[47:51] things happen to you
[47:52] amen yo your weak cannot get cloudy
[47:55] you will kind of get shady so the same
[47:58] way amen the children of yesteryear or
[48:01] the families of yesteryear has to trim
[48:04] the week
[48:06] you got to be doing something
[48:08] you got to be doing something
[48:11] you got to get it
[48:13] trimmed off
[48:14] so it was a lamp like this
[48:17] one of the many variations people would
[48:20] have been acquainted with not a lantern
[48:22] this is more a lamp stationary and it's
[48:25] a lamp like this
[48:27] that granted inspiration to some writers
[48:30] that tell us trim your feeble lamp my
[48:33] brother
[48:34] amen amen those the lamp gives
[48:37] inspiration to a songwriter who tell us
[48:41] be filled with the spirit

[48:46] blessed be the name of the lord
[48:48] blessed be his holy name
[48:50] so songs
[48:53] were inspired by the land
[48:57] it means
[48:59] as a believer
[49:01] the lamp in daily use you recognize
[49:05] you have to attend to it
[49:07] and as a believer
[49:09] you can't go on on what you did
[49:13] you cannot go on on your past
[49:16] you can't go on on your history
[49:18] you cannot go on what you did
[49:21] you have to trim your lamp
[49:24] hallelujah

[1:01:39] so this morning i have a title
[1:01:41] behold i come quickly
[1:01:44] and my reward
[1:01:45] is with me
[1:01:47] and i have an inspiration be ready and
[1:01:50] stay ready oh praise the name be ready
[1:01:54] and stay ready now the scripture we read
[1:01:56] this morning
[1:01:57] uh from revelation 20 to 12 and the
[1:02:00] amplified it says behold
[1:02:01] i am coming soon
[1:02:03] and i will bring my wages and rewards
[1:02:06] with me
[1:02:07] to repay and render to each one just
[1:02:11] what his own actions
[1:02:14] and his own work merit
[1:02:17] oh praise the name of the lord behold i
[1:02:20] come quickly and my reward is with me
[1:02:23] and we know the vision the the the word
[1:02:26] that came to the prophet because that
[1:02:28] was chosen the narrow part
[1:02:30] there was uh the hardaway the walked of
[1:02:34] your own chosen
[1:02:35] doors picked the precise decision
[1:02:38] it is my way because of this momentous
[1:02:41] decision a huge portion of heaven awaits
[1:02:44] thee
[1:02:45] oh praise god now i wonder when i die
[1:02:48] what then i happen to think now heaven
[1:02:50] is not portioned
[1:02:52] off the different portions to us of dear
[1:02:54] heaven is the kingdom of heaven within
[1:02:56] us
[1:02:57] that one waits for what a glorious
[1:03:00] decision thou has made
[1:03:02] this in itself is that which will give
[1:03:05] and may come to pass the tremendous
[1:03:07] victory in the love divine so a lot of
[1:03:09] things are dependent upon decisions
[1:03:12] decisions are fruits of consequences and
[1:03:14] actions every decision that we make have
[1:03:18] have things seen and unseen consequences
[1:03:21] let me say every decision we make have
[1:03:23] seen an unseen consequences
[1:03:26] oh glory to god hallelujah praise god
[1:03:29] hallelujah praise god so i want to
[1:03:32] strike the very team that brother
[1:03:33] solomon brought and it's brought from
[1:03:35] matthew 25 you're going to read the
[1:03:36] scripture shortly but jesus had an
[1:03:39] incredible way of telling parables
[1:03:41] and intelligent parables and stories
[1:03:44] what jesus did he include the people in
[1:03:47] the story themselves that they will see
[1:03:50] themselves that they will see their own
[1:03:52] hearts when he want to talk about
[1:03:54] brotherly kindness and helpfulness he
[1:03:56] said the kingdom of god is like a man
[1:03:59] saw a man beaten on the street and the
[1:04:01] pharisee passing by and this one passing
[1:04:04] by and that one passing by and i'm a man
[1:04:07] who is a samaritan oh praise god no no
[1:04:11] no religious person come and help him
[1:04:13] and put him in an inn and feed him and
[1:04:15] clothe him he said which one is your
[1:04:17] neighbor oh glory to god and he busts
[1:04:19] them like that so jesus will present
[1:04:22] words and make sure they see themselves
[1:04:25] in the story that he is telling
[1:04:28] oh glory to god when david's sin the
[1:04:30] prophet came up to david they say a man
[1:04:32] had one sheep
[1:04:33] and and our next man had so much and he
[1:04:36] leave all that he have and come said
[1:04:38] david said take that deal with that man
[1:04:40] he said the what the man
[1:04:42] that's what parable is about the story
[1:04:44] and inside the story it could reveal
[1:04:47] your own heart
[1:04:48] oh glory to god a woman caught in
[1:04:50] adultery he said which one of you can't
[1:04:52] have i have no sin cast the full stone
[1:04:56] yet tell them
[1:04:58] you just drop a mirror in front of them
[1:05:00] which one of you without sin cast the
[1:05:02] first stone and one by one they start to
[1:05:04] leave so that's the power of parables
[1:05:07] parables are hidden mysteries and
[1:05:08] stories hallelujah parables are keys in
[1:05:12] a story form oh glory to god hallelujah
[1:05:15] praise god so therefore when the parable
[1:05:19] come forth you could look at yourself
[1:05:21] you could look at what it's telling you
[1:05:23] you could look at what the story is
[1:05:25] telling you so don't take jesus parables
[1:05:27] lightly don't take when the word being
[1:05:29] spoken is likely that's the story it's
[1:05:31] more than just a story oh glory to god
[1:05:34] and this parable we are about to read is
[1:05:37] one of the most important ones
[1:05:39] hallelujah in connection with the coming
[1:05:41] of the lord it's from matthew 25 then
[1:05:44] shall the kingdom of heaven
[1:05:47] be likened unto ten virgins
[1:05:49] which took their lamps
[1:05:51] each had their own lamps that's personal
[1:05:54] lamp
[1:05:55] that's your lamp
[1:05:56] hallelujah praise god which took their
[1:05:59] lambs and went for to meet the
[1:06:00] bridegroom five of them were wise
[1:06:04] five were foolish

[1:24:38] and the gentile dispensation the
[1:24:40] covenant of that stone is a capstone to

[1:25:09] let's go from the rapture he said to the
[1:25:11] church the bride the rapture is a
[1:25:13] revelation to her it's revealed to her
[1:25:16] the revelation the true bride of christ
[1:25:19] will be waiting for that revelation of
[1:25:22] the rapture
[1:25:23] what a revelation yes
[1:25:25] and who does give revelation the holy
[1:25:27] ghost alone
[1:25:28] is the revealer
[1:25:29] of the revelation of jesus christ let me
[1:25:31] say it again no no man
[1:25:33] that's why you say if they say low here
[1:25:34] come here come here go here forget them
[1:25:36] they have the clue what are they talking
[1:25:37] about like spiritual man tried to draw
[1:25:39] men but oh glory to god he said behold
[1:25:41] the kingdom is within you and when you
[1:25:43] understand that the bride has the
[1:25:45] ability somebody's out that ability
[1:25:48] the ability to get direct from god
[1:25:50] god put that air inside you know devil
[1:25:52] could take that out you know when god
[1:25:54] talking to you you know when god's
[1:25:56] speaking to you you know when you
[1:25:57] hearing direct from god the bride have
[1:26:00] the ability to hear direct from god god
[1:26:03] put something inside of you to hear his
[1:26:05] word
[1:26:09] i don't care if you backs it in a
[1:26:10] hundred years
[1:26:11] oh glory to god when you hear that voice
[1:26:14] you have to have you can't have in your
[1:26:15] heart
[1:26:16] oh glory to god my sheep hear my voice a
[1:26:19] stranger they will not follow oh the
[1:26:22] only following the word we are word
[1:26:24] sheep oh glory to god not man sheep wear
[1:26:27] sheep not pasta sheep were cheap
[1:26:30] my sheep hear my voice
[1:26:36] it's a revelation
[1:26:37] why revelation is fit you cannot have a
[1:26:40] revelation without being fit fit is a
[1:26:41] revelation because sometimes revealed to
[1:26:44] you faith is a revelation and faith is
[1:26:46] something revealed to you like it was to
[1:26:48] abraham
[1:26:49] that would do what call anything
[1:26:50] contrary to what has been revealed to
[1:26:52] him
[1:26:54] now faith that's what the revelation of
[1:26:56] that's what the church is built upon
[1:26:58] the entire body is built not upon
[1:26:59] knowledge
[1:27:00] knowledge is information which pumping
[1:27:02] heavy now
[1:27:03] but we're not talking about information
[1:27:05] we don't want divine revelation so
[1:27:07] somebody could be sitting in front of
[1:27:08] you next to you and they do have a clue
[1:27:09] what's going on and holy spirit just
[1:27:10] drop down so
[1:27:12] that's it revealed to you
[1:27:13] and you leave there in that in your
[1:27:14] pocket and nobody knows
[1:27:17] nobody knows
[1:27:18] not even the pastor
[1:27:21] you hear what i said
[1:27:23] not even the pastor because this is not
[1:27:26] father pastor son
[1:27:28] this is father and son business
[1:27:30] let might say they're getting good
[1:27:32] because some people feel god having some
[1:27:34] in between somebody and some secretary
[1:27:35] you know god don't need secretary anna
[1:27:38] [Music]
[1:27:41] when eliana was coming to slackness and
[1:27:43] god recognized the whole priesthood
[1:27:44] footed and polluted god called samuel
[1:27:47] you know a young girl called samuel
[1:27:51] [Applause]
[1:27:54] so god can't call her any angel
[1:27:56] oh praise the name of the lord all right
[1:27:58] so i want you to notice a greeting
[1:28:00] taking place here on 11th thessalonians
[1:28:02] 4. for the lord himself shall descend
[1:28:05] from heaven with a shout
[1:28:07] with the voice of the archangel the
[1:28:08] trumper got three things happening here
[1:28:10] a shout
[1:28:12] a voice and a trumpet has to happen
[1:28:15] before jesus appears
[1:28:17] treatings
[1:28:19] three things
[1:28:20] a shout
[1:28:21] a voice and a trumpet has to happen
[1:28:24] before jesus appears right
[1:28:26] he said when he's descending jesus does
[1:28:28] all three of them when he's he's ending
[1:28:31] no no fight for ministry no no prophet
[1:28:34] ministry no no pastor ministry jesus
[1:28:36] himself
[1:28:38] does all three do you believe that
[1:28:40] do you believe that oh glory to god a
[1:28:43] shout

[1:29:20] what's the secret
[1:29:22] the word
[1:29:23] is in the bride what word the word of
[1:29:26] promises because peter said by these
[1:29:28] promises you're going to build a pyramid
[1:29:31] that make you take off like enoch
[1:29:33] because enoch built the pyramid and no
[1:29:35] one was looking for him he was not
[1:29:37] because the cops don't come and take him
[1:29:39] off
[1:29:39] or give the lord a shout
[1:29:41] and the same revelation that enoch got
[1:29:45] to take the pyramid to build the pyramid
[1:29:48] to be translated you are getting the
[1:29:50] same revelation
[1:29:57] all right are you ready
[1:29:59] the first thing happened when he started

[1:30:33] he already revealed himself he's not
[1:30:35] coming to reveal himself anymore in that
[1:30:37] way he is coming

[1:40:56] like a woman

[1:40:59] oh hallelujah praise god
[1:41:02] hallelujah what the foolish vision
[1:41:05] thought
[1:41:06] what
[1:41:08] the foolish virgins thought
[1:41:12] they knew they should be ready
[1:41:14] but they would not
[1:41:18] they thought there would be oil to
[1:41:19] purchase
[1:41:22] they thought it was okay to
[1:41:23] procrastinate
[1:41:27] putting off for tomorrow what you can do
[1:41:28] today
[1:41:30] putting it off in the door
[1:41:35] unwilling to act
[1:41:37] when they know they should
[1:41:40] procrastination is a form of rebellion
[1:41:43] because you don't want to follow
[1:41:45] instructions
[1:41:46] you don't want to be told what to do how
[1:41:49] to do and by what time to do it
[1:41:54] so you want to do it in your own time
[1:41:58] you want to be in charge
[1:42:02] so you're put off
[1:42:03] for tomorrow
[1:42:05] things you should know to do today
[1:42:10] they thought that they were in charge
[1:42:12] in charge of their own time
[1:42:16] they will do it
[1:42:18] when they choose
[1:42:21] they thought dynamics will come sooner
[1:42:24] not so late as midnight
[1:42:26] you see because they didn't know when
[1:42:28] the brand grew coming
[1:42:30] so time started to take its toll
[1:42:33] hallelujah i expected him at three
[1:42:34] o'clock who tell you that
[1:42:36] i get that revolution that's your
[1:42:38] revolution
[1:42:39] he said coming to your club
[1:42:41] your day is sitting waiting to your club
[1:42:43] four o'clock five o'clock your eye
[1:42:45] getting them
[1:42:46] feeling asleep
[1:42:48] they fell asleep at midnight
[1:42:50] the time you least expect
[1:42:53] a friend of the bridegroom say behold he
[1:42:55] coming
[1:42:58] caught
[1:43:00] near to midnight
[1:43:02] caught at a time that was not expected
[1:43:06] hallelujah
[1:43:08] they thought
[1:43:10] that it would come when they thought it
[1:43:12] should come
[1:43:14] they never thought the time would be
[1:43:15] drawn out to midnight
[1:43:18] they never expected the door to be shut
[1:43:21] to them
[1:43:22] they didn't understand
[1:43:24] when the son of man comes as dynamics
[1:43:27] he who is filthy
[1:43:29] be filthy still
[1:43:31] he who is righteous is righteous still
[1:43:34] and who is the filthy
[1:43:35] the foolish virgins prophet call him the
[1:43:38] filthy
[1:43:40] who
[1:43:42] they did not expect and asking the wise
[1:43:44] for oil
[1:43:46] the wise would say not so.
[1:43:49] that is the foolish version
[1:43:51] they say give us of your oil
[1:43:53] you know what i mean i we we know each
[1:43:55] other a long time
[1:43:57] time to share
[1:43:58] they didn't expect the answer
[1:44:01] from the lips of the wise
[1:44:03] the why say not so
[1:44:07] the foolish was shocked to hear those
[1:44:09] words not so
[1:44:13] no one
[1:44:14] no doubt
[1:44:16] the foolish would ask and get whatever
[1:44:17] they wanted
[1:44:19] but this was oil
[1:44:21] at a certain time
[1:44:22] at the time of the bridegroom comet
[1:44:25] the wise was listening to the call
[1:44:28] behold the bridegroom comment
[1:44:30] hallelujah in other words he's right at
[1:44:32] the door you asked me for oil
[1:44:34] not so
[1:44:36] not so
[1:44:38] not so
[1:44:40] was not the response they were expecting
[1:44:43] not so was an astonishing response to
[1:44:46] them when they knew the kindness gave
[1:44:48] them things in the time past
[1:44:52] hallelujah you know the age of kindness
[1:44:55] yeah but not so
[1:45:00] the wise was responding to the cry
[1:45:03] behold the blood will commit
[1:45:05] and i can't afford that what i got to
[1:45:08] run out
[1:45:11] oh give the lord some praises
[1:45:14] the wife said what i have now
[1:45:16] sorry
[1:45:18] not so
[1:45:22] can you
[1:45:24] could you pray for me
[1:45:26] the usual request
[1:45:28] got a rebuke
[1:45:31] go and pray for it for yourself
[1:45:35] go and buy
[1:45:37] go to them that sell
[1:45:39] don't ask me for anything no
[1:45:41] don't beg
[1:45:43] i want to pray for you now
[1:45:45] go and pray for yourself
[1:45:47] go and pay the price
[1:45:49] go to them that sell
[1:45:52] go and buy
[1:45:53] buy implies there's a price to be paid
[1:45:56] sell means that there is available if it
[1:45:59] is available
[1:46:01] did they know it ran out
[1:46:03] they didn't know the the final bucket of
[1:46:05] the holy ghost after a while runs out
[1:46:13] they thought it was still available for
[1:46:15] purchase
[1:46:17] they were not ready to forgive
[1:46:22] they hold oughts for years
[1:46:24] they hold grudge for years they're not
[1:46:26] ready to forgive because they want to
[1:46:28] have access to the holy spirit slot
[1:46:32] hallelujah
[1:46:33] they're not ready
[1:46:35] to break through the skylight of
[1:46:36] brotherly kindness
[1:46:38] to access the holy spirit
[1:46:40] but the bible says
[1:46:42] door was shut
[1:46:44] up
[1:46:49] no ready to forgive
[1:46:51] after all he has a bad behavior nasty
[1:46:54] behavior
[1:46:55] not ready to forgive
[1:46:57] when forgiveness shall be in your spirit
[1:46:59] in your heart and mind
[1:47:01] one disciples ask jesus shall we forgive
[1:47:03] our brother 70 times save me he says 70
[1:47:06] times 7.
[1:47:07] they have jesus seven times a day
[1:47:09] as if you could come to my time somebody
[1:47:11] could offend you a day
[1:47:12] number says congress
[1:47:15] and that was a big number it says
[1:47:16] sometimes that did you say 70 times 7.
[1:47:20] forgive your brother hallelujah
[1:47:23] you know what they said
[1:47:25] open to us that a group revelation
[1:47:32] you could see
[1:47:33] that they were felt entitled
[1:47:37] because they didn't have the oil
[1:47:39] and yet they still had the confidence
[1:47:41] say open to us
[1:47:46] we are brethren
[1:47:48] we believe
[1:47:50] we are virgins
[1:47:52] but god could tell him but you are
[1:47:53] foolish
[1:47:54] [Music]
[1:47:59] and your foolishness
[1:48:01] will have a reward
[1:48:06] you have a choice you always have a
[1:48:08] choice
[1:48:09] hallelujah
[1:48:12] the scripture in
[1:48:14] we read it but in the advertising he
[1:48:16] replied i suddenly clear to you i do not
[1:48:18] know you
[1:48:19] i am not acquainted with you
[1:48:22] oh my
[1:48:24] listen
[1:48:24] they did not expect time
[1:48:27] would run out on them
[1:48:31] they had time to pray
[1:48:32] they had time to seek the lord that time
[1:48:35] they begged god for the holy ghost
[1:48:37] because the bible said he gave the holy
[1:48:38] ghost to them that ask him
[1:48:40] oh glory to god and you can't ask god to
[1:48:42] give you the holy ghost and a filthy
[1:48:43] vessel you better get clean so god give
[1:48:46] them time to ask for holiness
[1:48:48] righteousness cleansing purification
[1:48:50] whatever it is to tarry to wait whatever
[1:48:53] it is to take out
[1:48:58] and as you trim you have to add oil
[1:49:02] hallelujah
[1:49:04] you cannot wait till last minute
[1:49:08] to make up for what you could have had
[1:49:10] or what you should have had
[1:49:12] to give of your best
[1:49:17] let me say it again you cannot
[1:49:20] and should not wait
[1:49:22] for last minute
[1:49:24] because at the last minute what best you
[1:49:25] gonna give god
[1:49:27] when you had all the time to prepare
[1:49:28] your heart and mine
[1:49:30] oh glory to god those three wise men
[1:49:32] they brought gifts
[1:49:34] of gold frankincense and moon they just
[1:49:37] traveled all them two years and when

[1:49:58] service to die was the message
[1:50:00] that three of them was presented by
[1:50:02] presenting these three gifts
[1:50:04] oh hallelujah it took time it took
[1:50:07] meditation it took inspiration it took
[1:50:09] prayer it took sacrifice for them to get
[1:50:11] that long distance to bring that
[1:50:13] offering to god
[1:50:15] amen
[1:50:18] last minute cannot make up for what you
[1:50:20] could have or should have done to give
[1:50:23] of your best
[1:50:25] your best is what he expects from you
[1:50:29] what god tell them they want to offer
[1:50:31] gold kind of beaufort lamb and what kind
[1:50:32] of crooked things and what is it gives a
[1:50:34] governor
[1:50:36] will be bring it give it to them
[1:50:39] they want to give god what we mean
[1:50:41] they want to give god wherever they want
[1:50:42] to give god but god should get your best
[1:50:45] [Applause]
[1:50:47] he wants your heart he wants your mind
[1:50:50] he wants your soul and he wants your
[1:50:52] body because you are the temple of the
[1:50:54] holy ghost bite of jesus christ
[1:50:56] hallelujah
[1:51:00] i know you're not
[1:51:03] and that is a familiar phrase
[1:51:07] i think it's spoken about three times in
[1:51:09] the scriptures if i'm not mistaken
[1:51:11] and i'm going to read one of them
[1:51:12] there's some luke chapter 13
[1:51:14] reading verse 22.
[1:51:16] and he went to the cities and villages
[1:51:18] teaching
[1:51:19] and journeying towards jerusalem
[1:51:21] and he said unto them then said warning
[1:51:23] to them lord are they few that can be
[1:51:26] saved
[1:51:27] and he said unto them strive to enter
[1:51:29] into the straight gate
[1:51:31] for many i say unto you will seek to
[1:51:33] enter in and shall not be able
[1:51:35] when once the master of the house is
[1:51:37] risen up and had shot to the door
[1:51:40] you begin to stand without and to knock
[1:51:42] at the door saying lord lord open unto
[1:51:45] us
[1:51:46] he shall answer and say unto you i know
[1:51:47] you're not
[1:51:49] whence he ah
[1:51:51] then shall he begin to say
[1:51:53] we have eaten and drunk in thy presence
[1:51:56] and i was taught in our streets
[1:51:59] and he shall say i tell you
[1:52:01] i know you not
[1:52:03] whence i
[1:52:04] depart from me all the workers of
[1:52:07] iniquity
[1:52:08] so this was a nice debate they were
[1:52:10] saying but jesus you you spoke to us you
[1:52:12] you eat with us you was on our street
[1:52:14] you talk with us he said i don't know
[1:52:17] hey why because you're a worker of
[1:52:19] iniquity
[1:52:21] watch this
[1:52:22] there shall be weep in the nation of
[1:52:24] teeth when ye shall see abraham and
[1:52:26] isaac and jacob and all the prophets in
[1:52:29] the kingdom of god and you yourselves
[1:52:31] trust out
[1:52:32] and they shall come from the east and
[1:52:34] from the west from the north and from
[1:52:35] the south and shall sit down in the
[1:52:37] kingdom and behold dear which at last
[1:52:40] shall be first and therefore fool shall
[1:52:42] be lost
[1:52:44] i don't know you
[1:52:46] worker of iniquity
[1:52:48] with a brown
[1:52:50] you see people
[1:52:51] a long time ago
[1:52:53] you ought to have come to god and got
[1:52:55] yourself settled down
[1:52:57] to know where you were standing
[1:52:59] the bible said in these last days that
[1:53:01] there will be a famine
[1:53:03] not for bread and alone
[1:53:04] but for the hearing of the word of god
[1:53:07] and they will go from east west north
[1:53:08] and south trying to find it and would
[1:53:10] fail you better get sealed into the
[1:53:13] kingdom of god by the holy ghost why you
[1:53:16] got a chance you talk about the
[1:53:18] confusion time it's coming and the bible
[1:53:20] said they'll be so close that it will
[1:53:22] receive the very elect if it is possible
[1:53:25] is that right no another question i want
[1:53:27] to clear up someone said is it doesn't

[1:53:45] know you

[1:53:50] but they did not do it that's right i
[1:53:52] never knew you they just claimed they

[1:54:01] jesus said many will come and say lord
[1:54:03] have not i he said i didn't know you
[1:54:06] many will confess and say i cast out
[1:54:08] devils in thy name in thy name i
[1:54:09] prophesied preachers and so forth and
[1:54:11] everything he will say depart from me he
[1:54:13] workers of iniquity i didn't even know
[1:54:16] you some people might have went out and
[1:54:18] had some big and a fleshly idea try to
[1:54:20] get popular and some big education could
[1:54:22] speak a few 12 words and make some money
[1:54:24] out of it jesus you workers of iniquity
[1:54:26] i didn't even know you you want to get
[1:54:29] to an iniquity is something that you

[1:54:41] not just all the extra
[1:54:44] all in your lamp
[1:54:45] that means every service every time you
[1:54:48] go along and pray you're hungry oh god
[1:54:50] tell me lamp lord
[1:54:55] he said the early church always do like
[1:54:57] they never had anything
[1:54:58] when they beat them they went in the
[1:55:00] room and instead of taking sick leave
[1:55:02] and taking time out they say lord god
[1:55:03] sending on your power once again
[1:55:05] and they were filled again with the holy
[1:55:07] ghost
[1:55:08] they were refilled with the holy ghost
[1:55:10] oh glo i mean you're trimming that lamp
[1:55:12] you're looking pouring oil as the lamb
[1:55:14] burning you're pouring all because that
[1:55:16] lamp is burning while you're waiting
[1:55:18] while you're waiting the lamb burning

[1:55:50] be born again by the spirit of god
[1:55:52] you've got to receive the holy ghost
[1:55:54] to turn it down just as it was to know
[1:55:56] to turn it down is just the same as the
[1:55:59] term jehovah of the old testament
[1:56:01] dung in that day
[1:56:03] or jesus and tasty
[1:56:05] same penalty always

[1:56:09] oh to this parable
[1:56:11] of the ten five versions and and five
[1:56:14] wise five foolish it have a parable that

[1:56:20] expectation
[1:56:21] being ready and staying ready
[1:56:23] oh hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[1:56:26] lord verse 10 is a powerful voice of
[1:56:29] that scripture while they went to buy
[1:56:33] while they went to pray while they went
[1:56:36] to pay the price while they went to make
[1:56:38] things right the bridegroom came
[1:56:41] and they that were ready
[1:56:43] went in
[1:56:44] with him
[1:56:45] and the door was shut
[1:56:46] that's a whole message inside right
[1:56:48] there
[1:56:49] oh glory to god in other words
[1:56:51] filthy filthy still righteous

[1:57:34] because the door was shut
[1:57:36] they thought they had a crack a chance
