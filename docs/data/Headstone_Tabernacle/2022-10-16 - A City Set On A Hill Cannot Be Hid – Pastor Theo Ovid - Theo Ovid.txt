good to be here in the house thank you sister angry for that song If it hasn't been photography that would be we want to acknowledge that cross that Old Rugged Cross amen sometimes we get so far from the real thing but we thank God for his love and some service and the worship certainly appreciate but Anthony and the message on Wednesday night I believe it was a you could put a bookmark by that message praise the name of the Lord praise God certainly if you have your Bibles I just want to take three portions of scripture Matthew chapter five we want to read verse 13 to 16 John chapter 15 verse 5 to 8. in Matthew Chapter 13 Verse 23. I like to call out the scriptures like now so they could write in mind if you want to write them down the scriptures Matthew chapter 5 I want to read from verse 13. he had a salt of the earth but if the salt have lost itself or where it shall it be sorted it's this dense thought good for nothing but to be cast out and to be trodden on the foot of men you're the light of the world a city that is set on a hill cannot be hid neither do men light a candle and put it under bushel but on the candlestick I'll give it light unto all that are in the house let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven John chapter 15 I want to read from verse 5. from any Scripture I am Divine here are the branches is it about it in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me you can do nothing if a man abideth not in me he's cast for as a branch and is withered and Men gathered him and cast him into the fire and they have burned if you abandon me in my Woods abide in you you shall ask what you will it shall be done unto you hearing is my father glorified that you bear much fruit so shall he be my disciples well our scripture Matthew chapter 13 verse 23 just one verse there was 23. and this is the end of the parable of the soul and the seed Jesus speaks but he that receive that seed into the good ground does he adhere it to word and understand it which also bear with fruit and bringeth forth some 104 some 60 some 30. let's pray one more time father we have read your scriptures and only you could interpret this message and bring this message here today I I pray that you take me out of the way and and put me to speak what you need to be spoken and the things that you don't want me to say just close my mouth Lord granted Father and Jesus am I ask it amen and amen God bless you praise the Lord so great to be here and I think that I want to just bring a slight recap from the Friday prayer meeting in which we talk about homegrown and testing for the supernatural just to follow through what about Anthony shared on Wednesday night and we took the scripture from Luke 2 talking about Simeon the Bible says it was it was behold there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon the same man was just on the Vault waiting for the consolation of Israel and the Holy Ghost was upon him you can underline that path and what the Holy Ghost was upon him I was revealing to him by the holy ghost that was upon him that he should not see death that has seen the Lord's Christ and brother Brian was talking about America people begging for the baptism of the Holy Spirit they are sick and tired of Theology and human psychology they want to feel the touch of the Living God who changes men's lives can make them new creatures in Christ Jesus this is what the Holy Ghost does because Holy Ghost is not from our realm Holy Ghost is Supernatural like but Anthony was speaking about so when God step into your realm and do something for you you have to be a changed person because that's not natural flesh and blood that what Jesus told Peter flesh on the heart to reveal it and to use that right he said the trouble of it is the church is not hungry enough the night for God information but they're not hungry for God and that's hungering until sin is what the Bible said blessed are the day that hunger and Truth after righteousness so we're not talking about coming to church here and Jordan should we're not talking about that we're talking about hungry for God I remember when I was young and I come to the Lord I was hungry for God I fasting and praying and seeking I couldn't help it I don't know if it's food I want I don't know what I was hungry for God I want you to live in reality praise God and that is what changed my life you have to be hungry and if you're not hungry this morning your prayer must be creating me a hungering creating me a testing because it is needed it is necessary the world of all his advertisement out there to attract our attention to take away the hunger from God but God wants you to focus on him that you could hunger after him not after money not after popularity not after woman not after Fame nothing else but him they seek first the kingdom and all other things gonna be added unto you do you believe that that the trouble of it is the church is not hungry enough tonight for God is the reason the holy spirit is not moving in the church tonight so once the hungering start to kicking praise God you will see the operation of the Holy Ghost praise God we're not talking about people coming to examine the message and judge the message from your seat you're not coming here to do that you come here to hang on tears of the righteousness you're looking for a donkey come behind you you don't care who speak it doesn't matter who speak it's not the speaker it's the Holy Ghost the whole Glory that God is Not the Man in the Holy Ghost is that who we have in today is the Holy Ghost and who I want this one to preach and I pray for this one it's not that it's the Holy Ghost once the Holy Ghost here the Holy Ghost want to speak the Holy Ghost got to heal the Holy Ghost gonna deliver the Holy Ghost is going to revive the holy is going to restore the holy is going to pour out or give the Lord a shout in the house glory to God hallelujah praise God praise God hallelujah listen to this it's the attitude of the people that brings the results as you know who the people out here who shout out the people it takes the people to call court on the scene they take the people to call God civil interaction it's the attitude of the people no man can bring a Revival the Revival have to come by the Revival of the come by have to stop what you give yourself a shout give a shout unto the Lord so God put you have a path to play in getting this real turning it's getting this revival moving God ordain you you are no mistake you are no miscarriage praise God hallelujah you are no mishap you do not here by chance you ordained to be here or give the Lord some Praises this morning hallelujah hallelujah the devil's a liar don't let the devil tell you you know you know you know no God need you we need you we need you right where you are we need you shouting we need you praising God we need you to be on fire we need to be under expectation we need to be hungry and our tears of the righteousness [Applause] Glory will be seated is the attitude of the people that brings the results and here we go that's the reason at Pentecost they have to go in an upper room and pray until the Holy Ghost came so Jesus said receiving Holy Ghost because they are taken by faith I get it already because he spoke it up over me he speak the word no he said he's satari in the city of Jerusalem until yeah but do it far from on high not far from below not far from the side not powerful Emmanuel Pulpit far from on high that's our Supernatural power that's a power that man don't have and bend the day of Pentecost was fully come or Glory fully come they were in the spirit they were praising God they were creating an atmosphere Mary was there Andrew was there oh Glory there God Mary Magdalene Mary Mother Jesus all the Mary's was there everybody was there the pastor was there the talenter was there the convocation was there the song leader was there the deacons was there the trustees was there everybody was there they were waiting on a promise the promise of the father man didn't give that promise man can't make that promise God give you a promise regardless of what you have done you'll still have a promise that promise is over you even if you're backslidden it is still over you you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost come upon you once a son always a son the devil can't change you from being a son you might be a better son but just tell a son you are still a sea God wants to baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire oh give the Lord a praise this morning that's the reason you receive it at Pentecost you have to go to the upper room and pray until the Holy Ghost came because they got into one place and one Accord it's the atmosphere that brings the results he said you believe that let every man and woman in this building this morning boy or girl get everything from their minds but the Lord Jesus and believe that he is standing present now and you will see something happening that will cause headlines in the newspaper in the morning that's right it's the atmosphere oh my God that's the recap oh praise God imagine that we just finished the recap there has to recap from the promising or praise God so today have a title a city set on a hill cannot be hid that's Jesus I see these set on a hill cannot be here I have a subject subject is ambition one week I have an inspiration let's have ambition High ambition o praise God let's have ambition hi ambition Angelic beans Associates together he said now if you have got the Holy Spirit In You then you are candidate for Association but the Unseen World and the supernatural no wonder people can't believe in those things they have never come in contact they've got nothing in there to believe with but when the Holy Spirit comes into the heart quickly he becomes a twofold being you become a twofold being one of the earth to die and one of Heaven to live in this body he says subject to debt but in his soul he is passed from Death under life in his body he has his Earthly conduct with his five senses in his Spirit he has a contact with God through the Holy Ghost and the angels of God visit them speaks with them and they are messengers of God sent from God to reveal and to bring Muslim God to the individual could we give the Lord some praises I have two more if I say context scriptures and you'd have to find it one is from Genesis 1 26 and God said let us make man in our image after likeness let him have dominion over the fish of the sea over the fall of the ear and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creepy thing that creeped upon the Earth so description Genesis here is God intent and purpose for man I want you to see the scripture here not just in the scripture but this is God's ambition this is God intent that man must have dominion this is God's desire them this scriptures from God's Own Heart let us make man in our image after likeness and let them have dominion underlying Dominion let them have dominion Romans 6 next context scripture reading from his 11. Paul speaks likewise reckon yourself also to be dead unto sin but alive unto God through Jesus Christ Our Lord let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body that you should obey it in the lust thereof neither yield him your members as instruments of unrighteousness Unto sin but yield yourself unto God as those that are alive from the dead and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God for sin shall never dominion over you so yeah we fell in sin but yeah prophecy that sin Must Have No Dominion over you but you must have dominion over sin this is what God this is God's desire this is God's ambition that people conquer same we will put our foot on that Devil's neck Oh Glory to God isn't that right for sin shall end of dominion over you you are not under the law but on the grace What then shall be sinned because we are not under the law but under grace God forbid know you not that to whom you heal yourself servants to obey his servants the after whom you will be whether sin unto death or obedience unto righteousness but God be thanked that he will be Servants of sin but you have obeyed from the heart that form of Doctrine which was delivered unto you being then made free from sin you become Servants of righteousness this is God's objective that will be free from sin and become Servants of righteousness it's not right I speak to you after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh for as you have yielded your members servants on cleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity even so now yield your members that's our order yield your members civil righteousness and unto Holiness we'll give the Lord some Praises do you love him this morning praise God so therefore in the in the Amplified verse 12 said let not sin therefore rule as King in your mortal short-lived perishable buddies to make you yield Ed cravings and be subject to its lust and pattern oh praise God I wouldn't call anymore I just want to skip that down that day Hallelujah ambition ambition ambition is a strong desire to do and to achieve something not a desire strong desire as somebody says strong desire to achieve or do something it's the desire and determination to achieve success you don't just want to run and erase in other words he always he also entered it no you want to win praise that's the ambition you want to start and the first body you might have number one you get gold you get silver you get bronze but you want to be standing you don't want to until you want to be making it the first three you want to be successful you want to get that medal you want to get that goal you don't just want to come to church and join the rest of church members you want to be part of this Pride Oh Glory to God the church members go to the tribulation the bride go into the Rapture could somebody say Amen this morning are you with me this morning the pass is in the house we'll give the Lord some Praises glory to God the church members go to the tribulation I'm telling you now this is the truth now but the pride goes in the rapture the church members are right the black book if the Lord a shout in the house if the Lord I shout in the house his wife had made herself ready so ambition a desire and determination to achieve success under similar words for that is aspirations intention goal aim objective purpose intent Drive determination Enterprise initiative eagerness scriptures he that come into God must believe that he is and he's a rewarder of them that diligently energetically enthusiastically determination seek him or glory to God him that us get him that knock at him that Seeker come on you can break out [Applause] we have no choice we have got to break out let us break out today let this be the service Oh Glory to God that your breakfast a humanistic realm your break past all them no praise demon praise God you can't raise your hands your care you're casting attention long enough the Mind strain here and strain there let this be the service that get locked in all glory to God because we are not speaking just our own talks the Bible said men move by the Holy Ghost they've got to believe this morning we are being moved by the Holy Ghost Jesus must move by the Holy Ghost he said he had a light of the world I city that has set on a hill cannot be hid you can't hide it or can the Lord and Shout bury the court

my knees Oh Glory to God hallelujah Give the Lord a praise offering glory to God oh letter never bind you to your past the devil have no charge of your present or your future you are determining that this morning as you receive the word as you apply the word we are breaking out because we say so and we've been peaceful and we are acting like it oh glory to God Amen do you believe that so Jesus said you're the salt of the earth if the salt loses saltiness we have the car sees no meat but that you can't make you can cook with that show where the whole bottle you saw Lewis taste you have reason to have somebody called salt to put them through this purify this is preserved and everything else if you put it to preserve and you think it's salty but they it's just like sand he said you

speak to the fathers to the prophets he said in the writing not one or just what title shall ever pass away unto his fulfilled and then it's manifested then it will pass because it's manifested it can't pass them but just the word itself is made flesh jot means small word title means small man not even one punctuation one expression anything will ever feel in the word of God it can fail because

descriptive fulfilled because God know the rest is for some other time leave the rest of it right back leave the rest for the last day Church path leave them to identify this part here I am say I'm gonna identify my path oh give the Lord some praise prophets did not always understand what they were writing or what they were singing or they were the noise I've said it if they understood it but the Bible said they were moved by the Holy Ghost moved he said when the Holy Ghost move you you move so I can't preach but other people preaching because they preaching that I can't preach because

word of God is rolling on hallelujah praise God praise God hallelujah let's continue the prophet writer must be in constant fellowship with the author he must live constantly in the presence of the altar to know what the book is going to be so not because he's a prophet he had to care about the presence and he ought to know he has to say constantly and the fellowship you see sometimes we miss process I think sometimes we talk about David and David is Anointed to be king but watch he says foreign so I'll kill him yeah you can't talk that talk he's not ready yet he's not mature enough yet he ain't qualified here God had to set him up isn't that right he's anointed but not yet appointed not yet ready Oh Glory to God and hear David going to process now when God wanted to bring David from the back to the front he set up a fight between the Philistines on Israel I fight that Israel couldn't deal with couldn't handle because he Goliath stepping forward as their Chief General that had demon that had Spirit saying send me a man to fight David happened to drift by his father moved and sent some rituals and some food for his brothers the brothers will fight for David so David is he nice family issues all family have issues family problems and he come there and they say where where are you doing here they come on to these sheep and they're trying to be lifting him that's what the devil like to do when you see him living forward when you see you have to persevere when you see us some ambition the devil tried to belittle you and smallify you no that's not a word and make it small [Applause] David [Applause] all right [Music] they're gone and he's about to leave as you're about to leave what's your timing David Olivia he's about to leave Goliath open his big mouth and she said me a man to fight me wrong timing wrong timing wrong man to say that too wrong man to hear that when David heard that he said who is this I was leaving but but who is this still is time Define the armies of the Living God the outspoken word book they are message of the hour they are Prophet they are ape and they are all adapt but the bongers ever they can't take back from the enemy what the enemy took from them oh glory to God David said who is that uncircumcised Philistine all you know is word only they've never been on top of the power and demonstration let me give my testimony whenever here come up there and I deal with him and here come a lion and I deal with him I'm just Goliath this morning I'm going to take his head off we're gonna have a Revival we're gonna have a shout yes yes we're gonna have a healing a miracle praise God give the Lord awesome Praises we know the story David slugolia or can the Lord a shout a city set on a hill cannot be heard okay the Lord

the Holy Ghost [Applause] foreign [Applause] this is foreign Lucifer son of the morning Hallelujah all in music and everything else but in his heart he had a desire to be like the most high to be like God and he preached and deceived two turns of the Angels praise God if they take they believe the devil's lie and you can't accept the devil's light until they reject God's truth a lot of people believe in lies now because they reject God's truth they'll be condemned by the lies that they believe God sent a prophet with original word we have no right to take but any man say okay the Lord I shout in the house who he is [Applause] hurry now watch he said when the prophet had his mind set constantly on what God Said not what man thought what the age thought what the church thought what the kingdom taught is what God taught he only expressed God thoughts to word because a word is the thought when it's expressed no the word is a thought expressed so the prophet was waiting for God's thoughts and when God revealed his thoughts to him he expressed it in the word does see at the Lord so when it dropped tongue into the prophet's heart you hear thus say of the Lord hallelujah praise God that's why the defied kingdoms and church Ages which to do in their day was a death penalty you woke up in a king's face and said don't say the Lord the church will put you to death right now for doing it but these prophets were bold why they were moved by the Holy Ghost [Applause] so what's the sense we know the date the Press coming we don't need documents they come in with we know what the order is and we have no power it's basically going to buy food and store it up for the tribulation then we are PPN to be tribulation seeds you have to be moved by the Holy Ghost when there was built in Stephen which Stones demons oh God says Lord don't put this charge on them they have enough charges already not nice not mines Steve was on different Ramones together Steve was in the Supernatural

back in the church we talk about outpouring of the spirit we're talking about things that mankind produce you see man could study and bring this mystery and atmosphere and fullness and unfold that

this a lot of people don't believe Romans 8 20th they know the scriptures they know what it said all things but they don't really believe all things what they really believe is good things work together for good yes yes I want you to think about that now what they really believe is good things work together for good to the middle of the Lord so whenever bad things come oh [Music] yeah another problem but the Bible said all things when Joseph Brothers Shoal him out all right well they put him in a pit on the black he did and whatnot and whatnot poor fella cried he was 17 years old or whatever right according to Egypt Newton new language learning everything else it looked critical crisis you look like oh God my brother name oh God they're so sinful they're wicked men they've only catch them but it was looking for good because God was sending Joseph to Egypt to preserve life he is 17 he's unaware of his Destiny he's unaware of his purpose he's on our way of his calling he's unaware of his Destiny of what God called him to do God disguised it as brothers selling him out God disguised it by using jealousy as a tool as a chariot to get your name in position a city set in a hill cannot be here wherever chosen go God bless them Joseph go excellent you're working as Gardener you get promotion his promotion get him in trouble but is our trouble at Broadway foreign making a move on him and and trying to get to him and he run and everything else we don't end up in prison it's right here God wanted him because in prisoner Baker and a bottle is going to be restored to the king that is how Joseph's getting sometimes you don't know who you know who know who Joseph can't just walk into the king and say make me an assistant it's not working so Joseph don't know how to get to the king he's an outsider but when he went into prison Hallelujah he interpret the dreams Becca you lose your head but I never be restored don't forget me the man walk out and forget because Joseph was not ready yet okay the Lord I shall you can't stay in prison because you Buckle a girl word for you you want your freedom you want the freedom but you're ready yet you need some drying out you need some dying out you need some more Childs you meet some more testing you need some more purification or glory to God help me I feel no feeling preaching Oh Glory no fearing to preach Hallelujah treat people nice treat people well you don't know who connecting with who who gonna help you who gonna make your way for you so now when the Pharaoh are the dreams and tell the white went into prison and they might want to know their dreams that they could fudge that they could give their own thing see I can't remember I didn't say you are wise you know you clearly wise men tell me the dream and tell me the interpretation they're making style what he said listen well he was only here is Mysteries and you guys tell me that mystery because King illusion he had every one of these are here then the butler all of a sudden he remember you see how God has retirement at the right time into prison and a man named Joseph he tell me the dream and he took me interpretation and it was right sent for Joseph Jesus have come to the prison you could imagine when that prison daughter my name Keystone but you sentences recently don't open all of a sudden it wasn't for food it's a completely presence of the king could the king have a mystery that he got self the King has something that the burden upon him and they need a man such as that Oh Glory that you can see the Bride come in their position a city set under him the pride of the answer for the world today Christ The Mystery of God in you the hope of glory hold it stands for Joseph from prison when Julie said give me some time off because of famine he said find a wise man to organize this whole show he said you are a man you know what Joseph come now right may God warn him Hallelujah his family his Brethren have to come down to Egypt because while all other bands are empty only chose if I have green oh give a shout in the house while other s are empty empty Joseph van have green Oh Glory to God I ain't finished yet you know we said warm enough we know the story Brothers come I could use it with maturity he said oh fuss yourself go carry on God send me ahead to preserve life he could have said are you Wicked I'll go beat all it with plenty lashes for the wickedness you do to me 20 years ago oh God 20 years ago no Joseph wasn't in that training he could have said what they did to him he could have said how evil he treated him and how badly but Joseph choose to show the higher purpose and when you look at the whole story from above perspective you will see truly all things foreign [Applause] all things work together for good all right so Lord take me through whatever it is don't let me escape them if they are set for me just give me Grace to go through that here we go we see the believer accepts the word every generation from Noah they believe here we go are you ready the believer don't question the believer believes it the believer believes what the weight not decreed the world not denomination the word not when somebody else says what the word say that is the believer here we go there's a big one Cain God told him why don't you worship like it brother you do all right you'll do well if you do that but no he know too much about it he rejected there's a big one the original Vindicated word and those are people like when the moon says bring what kind of cuckoo Revolution the man make it up a man see it the prophet said you know the prophet is the man that sent from God to bring him manner for the Bride of Jesus Christ but they prefer some other man's word and what the prophet say he rejected what the original Vindicated word here we go as we hit the home stretch here now go tell Elijah as your lord slave it and I'll not leave you he went to the school of the Prophet second stage of the journey he went to Jordan from there stay here while I go to Jordan as Lord liveth I'll not leave you a type of the true church following Jesus Christ I went across Jordan Jordan means debt because Joy what would you have me to do he said a double portion of your spirit be sent upon me he said yeah it's a great thing you ready now God wants us to ask for big things wish I had some kind of technology to find all the temperature like when people were saying amen how much percentage [Music] people like they don't want to say um God wants us to ask for big things man he said God he don't run out of blessings up there you can't ask for too much [Applause] he don't run out the car asks too much when they even start to draw down he said my cup run it over David keep on asking and when was at the dump itself Not only was his cup full his cop ran over he said the water got in the sauce I know Hallelujah went back that's when you cop ran over they're drinking from the saucer hey because your cop ran over Give the Lord some praises oh my God he said you can't ask too much he said could you you can't ask for too much could you imagine a little fish about that long in the middle of the ocean since I better not drink much of this water because it might go dry that's just as unreasonable as it was to to think that God blessings would be ever be exhausted to the Believers all Heaven belongs to you and when he answered the proportion he said he acts are hurting but if you see me when I go you'll have it now the Bible wants us let me say it again the Bible wants us to ask for big things not to be satisfied Lord here I belong to a church no that's enough no that's not enough for me I want to do something else I want greetings well Lord by his grace I claim a million souls for Christ in my own individual Ministry a million even a million Souls of Christ I'm not satisfied with that I want two or three million Souls [Applause] for some people somebody said when you come to the money you don't have money yet the people who have real money for them anytime you continue your money you ain't starting to get money yet are you counting it them guys there's a scripture is a straight scripture a scripture man was about to get fired and he went and tell all the people and only Master he said how much you owe him you're 100 pay 50. yeah 10 55. and Jesus commended the man for his his holy describing for for the kind of wisdom then I'm just the king Kingdom because that man make people pay half that when he leave I get fired he have friends that would deal with him and Jesus was talking about how that man operate and he said the children of this world is wiser than the children of the Kingdom don't act like a fool or give the Lord some praise against the Lord a shout if you're any luck wisdom get wisdom that's God said I want greetings Lord by his grace I claim a million Souls of Christ in my own individual Ministry and millions are better I'm not satisfied with that I want two or three million souls to Christ just go in as long as I got Brett and energy to move I want to keep on moving Oh Glory to God you can never exhaust God's love and mercy to you you say well I hate to bother you so much father that come like somebody calling brother to you and saying everybody I don't need to bother you but the answer to this you can never exhaust God's love and mercy to you you say well I hate the body so much father he wants to be bothered that way your father loves to be bothered you know sometimes you say Lord I actually before I come again I get shy yeah I want to act again because you acted already he said ask it shall be given then he said to him but ask it nothing wrong you have to tell God I know you're not tired I know your hair is not weary so I come to burn your ears again I have a request from a child I have a request from my husband I have a question my job I have a customer business I'll request my finances I have a request if the answer yet I know some answer to come by and stop it I'm knocking Oh Glory to God I have a request for the Holy Ghost I ain't stopping I am asking the Bible said if a man nor they give God gifts to his children how much God will give the Holy Ghost to them that ask but the people don't want to ask how they're gonna get it or you look at it you're not asking for it or you're going to Revival if you're not asking for Revival but I gotta break you if you're not asking for the Breakthrough come on now come on now come on now he wants to be bothered that way he does don't never think that you could ever ask too much of God I believe the scripture said you have not because you asked not and you ask not because you believe not he wants us to ask as I say that I want to say amen after that he wants us to ask and believe that our Joys would be full that's why you ask such a joy might be full when you don't have all you have joy God wanted to have that your joy might be full you must know God as a cancer in God Give the Lord our prayers you must know God as a prayer answering God [Applause] are you finished yet the honey from the honey he wants us to ask and believe that our choice will be full he wants you to ask abundantly shout out abundantly abundantly shuttered abundantly what if everybody begin to pray constantly no pray like you're talking in your cell phone then sometimes see people looking like looking like they're mad okay they have a microphone here thing in the ears and whatnot do like you're talking on yourself you're asking abundantly [Music] she again he again Oh Glory to God you praying once a month have made noticing your application get lost when others going forward forward forward your application behind the woman who already dead baby in Mexico and everybody there and Brahman pray for the sick and the deacons got whole sheep but because she hears the mother baby get raised from the dead and she ain't letting the doctor she like nobody hold up that baby and she fighted she passed me through the leg she fighting and water and baron said well she don't know who I am go down there and prefer well Colombian pray for her she's nothing she's not in that you know she had come to hear no specials you know she have a dead baby you know who understand the specials and have a special a special render special deals in that you know dignity have nothing to do with that I want my baby race on the dead well she was so desperate her faith was so desperate her faith hit him have him hit the prophet and the prophet stopped what he's doing I said let the woman come forward God could take it from the back and bring it to the front because your faith you're hungering your thirsting your desperation Give the Lord some praises all right that woman don't know what happened in Supernatural her faith her faith her desperation with him give the prophet official seen the baby race from the dead he said bring that woman yes of everything that's what faith does that's what desperation does it stops everything on the platform and attends to you oh give the Lord a shout in the house watch this song he wants us to ask and believe that our joy should be full he wants you to act abundantly ask for big things don't limit your faith to some little mustard seed get out there to some other kind of faith move out in big things big things is just as easy to receive as other things we should be shutting down service right now when you hear that you can't wait to pray you can't wait to ask you can't wait to knock on Heaven's Door you can't wait to seek him you know a Revival coming your way you know breaks you coming your way you know God gonna add to you you know God gonna multiply Oh Glory to God not divide not subtract multiply and add I'm almost done all right I want to read this part again big teams is just as easy to receive as little things you just have to believe that's all God expects his children to trust him for everything that they have but we want to trust the hand of man I rather have my horse built on Christ take in my solemn stand upon his grace and mercy than any educated group of people who were former organizations say this is the way Christ said I am the way the truth the light no man cometh to the father except for me God dwells moves Works in mankind God doesn't work through orders he doesn't work through organization he works through individuals God works in man God doesn't do the work today he energizes or projects his Spirit into men to do so I am divine Divine don't bear fruit ye are the branches praise God as David duplessis said to me one at noon if these lazy Pentecostal people would get up and do something instead of trying to take a ringside seat and watch God do it the church will be moving on you see I think that's right get up and move God are you ready God is expecting you you are the branches your hands is his hands your lips is his lips your thoughts is his thoughts as I said last night Nathan said to David do all of this in your heart for God is with you God is with his people in his people God in your hope of glory god is in his people Tabernacle once in this pure unadulterated body of the Lord Jesus by virgin put that blood cell was broke and he made a way you couldn't do it you couldn't Merit it but he merited your rights and called after dwelling in Christ given himself as a ransom for reconciliation to bring man and God together Unite with them again when the Dove and the lamb come together him would kiss our body close any civilized normal mind knows that we are at the end of something civilization can't stand any longer she is just weaving and shaking What's it waiting for it is way past you I want these are Noah long-suffering in leftover for the elect's sake God is waiting to get his church in order he is waiting on you and I God is written watch this he says no you see the great solar system speaks of Christ everything that you see speaks of Christ if you just look at it look at the church today on its condition weak vaccine going back into the world that speaks of Christ exactly what he said he stand the door and knock put outside or organize him out he's trying to cut them down and bring them to a spot here we go where the great Capstone comes the ministry that's in the church and the Capstone will come right straight together like a magnet they will just seal right in together God help us it will be there don't worry it will be there he said it would be there for us to fit ourselves to meet that Cornerstone so we see now that all this preparation is to meet the Cornerstone the Capstone that she stole himself Oh Glory to God almost done you know there's a paradox to do his program he took an old man eight years old Moses never put a sword in his hand or Crooked Stick and sunk Egypt in the bottom of the Dead Sea incredible what God can do he uses a paradox to do it he brings it to a paradox a Crooked Stick of a Shepherd instead of a matching Army a nation rule by the world you'll begin to play something again the only thing God is waiting on now I believe Russia don't mean nothing to God you hear that Russia don't mean nothing to God he wants to get one man he don't have to have big organizations he don't have to have big denominations he wants to get one man that he could wrap his Spirit into him that will tell the rest of it there will be another Paradox until he can get someone completely surrendered that will do that that's the way God does God is waiting to find somebody it's not too unusual to that they can be Anointed with the Holy Ghost to prove that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday to them forever to be a Shining Light to Blind the eyes of the unbeliever and that they would blaspheme and bring Justice upon them oh my I am done friends Jesus said you are City that is set on a hill when God set you on that Hill nobody can take you out
