[22:55] unto the Father which had made us meet
[22:58] to be partakers of the inheritance of
[23:00] the Saints in light who had delivered us
[23:02] from the power of darkness and had
[23:05] translated us into the kingdom of his
[23:08] dear son in whom we have Redemption
[23:11] through his blood even the Forgiveness
[23:13] of sins who is the image of the
[23:16] invisible God the firstborn of every
[23:19] creature for by him were all things
[23:21] created that are in heaven that are in
[23:23] Earth visible and invisible whether they
[23:26] be Thrones or dominions or
[23:27] principalities ities or Powers all
[23:30] things were created by Him and for him
[23:35] and he is before all things and by him
[23:38] all things consist and he is the head of
[23:41] the body the church who is the who is
[23:45] the beginning the firstborn from the
[23:47] dead that in all things he might have
[23:51] the preeminence is May God is bless his
[23:53] word you may be seated oh it's great to
[23:55] be here tonight see all of you out here
[23:57] tonight that's is really
[23:59] wonderful well I have a title tonight
[24:03] preeminence projecting his presence to
[24:07] others that's the title night
[24:10] preeminence projecting his presence to
[24:14] others but
[24:16] BR he said notice God had a three-fold
[24:19] purpose in his great in this great
[24:21] mystery
[24:22] secret this great mystery secret he had
[24:26] before the world began he had a
[24:28] three-fold purpose the first fold of
[24:31] that purpose was God wanted to reveal
[24:34] himself to the people in the memorial I
[24:37] was talking about time was given to us
[24:39] to fulfill purpose but not only us was
[24:42] given to fulfill purpose God himself
[24:44] have a purpose God is Not Without aim
[24:47] God have an objective just as we have
[24:50] time and within that space of time we
[24:52] are called to fulfill purpose God
[24:54] himself have a purpose and the first
[24:57] thing he wanted to get across was to
[24:59] reveal himself to the people because he
[25:03] was too mysterious so the question was
[25:05] how do I reveal myself to these humans
[25:09] to these people on the Earth isn't that
[25:10] right he couldn't do it as great Jehovah
[25:12] God who covered all space Time and
[25:14] Eternity he is too great ever to be
[25:16] revealed to the people because it would
[25:17] be too mysterious how a great being that
[25:21] never did begin and Beyond the cycle of
[25:23] a 100 billions and trillions and
[25:24] trillions of years of light space out
[25:26] into the infinite into eternity a great
[25:29] creator that was and but what he wanted
[25:32] to do he loved fatherhood for he was a
[25:35] father and the only way he could express
[25:37] it was to become a son of man son of man
[25:42] Hallelujah and that's the reason Jesus
[25:44] keeps saying son of man they didn't know
[25:46] what he was talking about but do you get
[25:48] it he wanted to express himself that is
[25:52] what his one of his great threefold
[25:54] purpose was to express himself to
[25:56] identify himself with human beings to
[25:59] reveal himself in Christ secondly here
[26:01] we go to have the
[26:16] [Music]
[26:28] the third is to restore the kingdom that
[26:30] Adam lost Back to Eden so listen what
[26:34] was Jesus manifested for to show God he
[26:38] was God he had to be no man could die no
[26:41] Prophet could die he was God he was the
[26:43] god of the prophets he was the prophets
[26:44] he was the Kings he was the history he
[26:46] was that was to come he what was was
[26:49] that is the same yesterday today and
[26:51] forever he was manifested for that
[26:53] purpose and through that purpose Jesus
[26:57] purpose now amen he will achieve a
[26:59] church yes sir that he the fullness of
[27:02] God might bring to pass every promised
[27:05] word of God in these last days we can't
[27:08] fail we can't afford to fail oh give the
[27:12] Lord a shout because Jesus came to
[27:15] accomplish this purpose so when he says
[27:18] finish something happen it's really
[27:20] finish in truth it has to unfold right
[27:22] now give the Give the Lord some
[27:25] Praises
[27:26] Hallelujah so he said Jesus said he that
[27:29] believeth on me the works that I do
[27:31] shall you do also even more than this
[27:33] shall you do because I go to my father
[27:35] see that was his purpose there was the
[27:39] manifestation and now today he wants to
[27:42] get somebody shout to
[27:44] somebody he wants to get somebody that
[27:46] they could see it and they could let the
[27:50] word come and have the prayer Min in
[27:52] their
[27:53] lives you have to see it first you have
[27:55] to understand it first it's not about
[27:57] you it's about him and in all things he
[28:00] might have the pinen is I say it's not
[28:04] about you it's not about me it's about
[28:06] him oh give the Lord some Praises
[28:10] hallelujah praise God Amen watch oh this
[28:13] is so beautiful when he seen his
[28:17] creation had
[28:18] fallen his own loving character molding
[28:23] himself into the person of Christ
[28:29] God's own character of Love projected
[28:34] himself in the man Christ Paul speaking
[28:37] said think it not rubbery but make
[28:39] himself equal to God rather his own
[28:41] character molded that kind of person no
[28:44] one ever could do it but God this was
[28:47] done so he could pay the penalty of the
[28:50] fall of
[28:51] creation Oh Glory to God in other words
[28:54] the devil had a strapped bong finish but
[28:58] he projected his love and that love as a
[29:01] projection projected Jesus Christ oh God
[29:04] we love him tonight it projected Jesus
[29:07] Christ the Redeemer the Savior oh give
[29:11] the Lord a shout what for for his
[29:13] purpose on the earth God in service to
[29:16] die to pay the price and say Satan I
[29:18] paid for them Hallelujah I paid for them
[29:22] I brought them back to get us back where
[29:25] Back to Eden oh give the Lord a shout
[29:28] but before we go back to Eden he must
[29:30] have the
[29:31] pinenes Oh Glory to God hallelujah
[29:34] something had to be projected out of us
[29:37] oh give the Lord a shout in the
[29:40] house Hallelujah there must be something
[29:43] save his creation nothing could save it
[29:46] because the highest species of his
[29:49] creation had fallen and everything under
[29:51] it fell with it because it fell because
[29:54] remember we say let us make man in our
[29:56] own image so all the giraffes monkeys
[29:58] um dinosaurs everybody was under that so
[30:01] when man fell the boss
[30:03] gone then the animals running Havoc
[30:06] Lions had the bite this on had the r
[30:08] this one carry on and whatnot and the
[30:10] boss gone the boss finish the boss fall
[30:14] so God had to come down to be one of
[30:16] us to get us back oh glory to God that's
[30:20] how the word became flesh that's how the
[30:23] invisible became visible we handled him
[30:26] the word of life Oh Glory to God it's
[30:29] not just a text oh glory to God but it's
[30:32] the word of life he said I come that you
[30:35] might have life and have it more
[30:37] abundantly he told them people he said
[30:40] you you you you search the scriptures
[30:42] but in them you think you have eternal
[30:44] life but they testify of me all you have
[30:47] is text all you have is written word but
[30:49] I am the living bread I am the living
[30:52] word that came down from heaven that a
[30:54] man that eat of me shall not die but
[30:57] live oh come the night Hallelujah come
[30:59] and live my brother come and live my
[31:02] sister this Abundant Life oh give the
[31:04] Lord some Praises
[31:07] Hallelujah the highest speci of his
[31:09] creation had fallen everything under it
[31:11] fell with it because it fell there's
[31:13] only one thing left that did not fail
[31:16] that was God the heavens so something of
[31:19] the heavens had to come down to redeem
[31:21] this creation because there was nothing
[31:24] here that could create it so this
[31:26] creation had to come from above because
[31:28] as far as Earth is concerned Earth is
[31:30] finished like one man say he he don't
[31:33] know what will happen after the third
[31:35] world war but you know what happened in
[31:38] the fourth world war they be fighting
[31:39] with sticks and stones meaning that the
[31:43] third world war would finish everything
[31:45] so he sure for the fourth world war is
[31:47] Sticks and
[31:49] Stones that's all remaining all right so
[31:53] therefore when man fell nobody could
[31:56] help anybody so the word had to come
[31:58] from Heaven that's why Isaiah said a
[32:00] virgin shall conceive because this
[32:02] conception this creation have to come
[32:04] from above all right let's go watch and
[32:08] everything under it fell there's only
[32:10] one thing left that did not fall that
[32:11] was God so something of the heavens had
[32:13] to come down to redeem the creation
[32:16] because there was nothing here that
[32:17] could create it God's Own love for the
[32:21] World created the
[32:24] character expressed in Christ I hope
[32:27] this resonate with you tonight I hope
[32:29] this this just revive your spirit
[32:31] tonight like when you first come to the
[32:33] Lord I hope this that tonight he was
[32:35] God's character he was God's Express
[32:39] image in him was God God in Christ
[32:42] revealing himself to the world and no
[32:46] love could ever be greater than that
[32:47] love such a person could become what he
[32:50] did in order to redeem what has been
[32:52] lost oh praise God here we go projecting
[32:56] himself to make a plan of a Redemption
[32:58] to redeem his Fallen character of ours
[33:01] that was done so that the penalty could
[33:03] be paid because the penalty was debt and
[33:06] one under the sensus of debt could not
[33:07] pay the penalty for the next one under
[33:09] the sensus of debt there had to be
[33:11] somebody come from who was free from
[33:14] debt in order to pay the penalty and
[33:17] none other could come but God because he
[33:20] was the only one that was free from the
[33:22] penalty of debt because the W of sin is
[33:25] Deb that's why Adam died Eve died and
[33:28] all died but Jesus he come from the
[33:32] volume of the book well give the Lord a
[33:35] shout there was no sin in him but he
[33:37] came to pay the penalty therefore let me
[33:40] go let's go his loving character of love
[33:44] it makes it so plain John 3:16 for God
[33:47] this this how oh my this is is like a
[33:49] melody inside here this morning this for
[33:51] God so loved the world that he gave his
[33:54] only begotten son that whosoever
[33:56] believeth in him should not perish but
[33:58] would have eternal life God projecting
[34:01] himself and become a man that he might
[34:04] upon him the form of a creation in other
[34:07] words he changed his tent Hallelujah and
[34:09] he spread it among human beings infant
[34:12] Jehovah crying a Manger could you
[34:14] imagine it it ought to alarm the hearts
[34:16] of the Believers could you imagine
[34:18] Jehovah being a baby in a Manger a
[34:21] stable of man could you imagine that
[34:23] Jehovah playing as a boy could you
[34:25] imagine him as a teenager could you
[34:27] imagine imagine him as a carpenter shop
[34:29] could you imagine him in such complete
[34:31] obedience to God dying on the cross to
[34:33] redeem Fallen creation that's the kind
[34:36] of love God had he had to become that in
[34:39] order to die to hold the sting of death
[34:43] oh give the Lord a shout in the house
[34:46] and then Jesus come and say who do men
[34:47] say I the son of man am and all I'm
[34:50] happy to talk about others what other
[34:51] saying find in the message know people
[34:53] don't want to talk about themselves they
[34:56] don't want to talk about the revelation
[34:58] some say you're this some say that some
[35:00] say other he said who do you say I am
[35:02] and he caught them Fallen three and a
[35:04] half years they still didn't know how
[35:05] books and tapes they still have no
[35:06] revelation of what the prophet brought
[35:08] talking about seeds and Mysteries and
[35:10] have a clue cluel
[35:11] L and all of a sudden Peter broke
[35:13] through one man th the Christ the son of
[35:17] the Living God then Jesus said Flesh and
[35:19] Blood had not revealed
[35:21] revealed not understand reveal it unto
[35:24] you but my father has revealed it unto
[35:26] you here we go and Upon This Rock of
[35:30] Revelation I will
[35:32] build my church so Jesus have a church
[35:36] and the Gates of Hell Lucifer the fallen
[35:38] angels all way kicked out Heaven can't
[35:40] Prevail against it oh give the Lord a
[35:42] shout he's saiding Lucifer all who was
[35:45] with him that were kicked out of heaven
[35:47] that fall on the earth they can't
[35:49] Prevail against that church oh are you
[35:51] ready tonight Hallelujah are you ready
[35:53] hallah he said the only way you are
[35:55] saved is is by knowing him by
[35:58] Revelation his church here we go is
[36:00] himself
[36:03] revealed that's a message church that's
[36:05] a message church that's a tabernacle
[36:07] that nothing talking about
[36:09] you do you get it now now when he said
[36:12] th Peter upon his Ro my church he wasn't
[36:14] talking to other
[36:15] disciples if the other say that what
[36:17] Christ the Christ they repeating what
[36:18] Peter say what Peter got was from
[36:22] Heaven if anybody said that the Christ
[36:24] after that listening to what Peter said
[36:26] they only repeating what Peter say but
[36:28] Peter heard from his theophany he heard
[36:30] from Heaven he heard from his father you
[36:32] understand what I'm saying now he heard
[36:34] from Heaven that is revelation so his
[36:37] church is what himself
[36:39] revealed so the church real church we
[36:42] don't we don't about this Tabernacle and
[36:44] this group and this church and we not
[36:45] talking about that his church this Rock
[36:47] Church is himself reveal so the church
[36:52] is a revelation

[36:59] if you if I take the Presbyterian
[37:01] Doctrine and tie I could tie you
[37:02] Pentecostal till they don't know I can
[37:04] take Baptist Doctrine and show you
[37:05] Pentecostal a million things you know
[37:06] about but that is not

[37:16] not
[37:18] it I know more than you that's not it I
[37:21] have the information your pastor do have
[37:23] because he can he need he need to come

[37:59] negativity that doesn't affect you who
[38:02] fall off who St come into church who
[38:04] backslide that doesn't affect you

[39:07] be
[39:08] seated remember Joshua and Caleb just
[39:10] two people in it's 10 other minister
[39:13] they ruling the show with the Min
[39:15] Association you know it's time holding
[39:18] the crow you
[39:20] know but them guys those guys they were
[39:23] word born so they only speaking back the
[39:25] word not the feeling the word all right
[39:34] but God
[39:36] holds this key to this revelation of
[39:41] Christ
[39:42] himself he said if want to read it
[39:44] Matthew 11:25-26 I thank the father
[39:47] Jesus
[39:48] words God Of Heaven and Earth that thou
[39:51] has hid this from the eyes of the wise
[39:54] and prudent in the message
[39:58] and reveal it unto babes such as would
[40:01] learn Oh Glory to God when you're in the
[40:04] learning mode Hallelujah you could get
[40:07] Revelation oh give the Lord a shout in
[40:09] the
[40:11] house after you know what you know and
[40:14] you can still learn you can get
[40:17] Revelation most times after they learn
[40:19] they forget it become Theologian not
[40:23] Revelation look at those Scholars of
[40:25] that day Jews fine men organization
[40:27] Pharisees Sadducees herodians whatever
[40:29] they might be all their great
[40:31] organization Jesus said you are
[40:34] blind you lead the
[40:37] blind did you hear that blind pastors
[40:40] leading blind people
[40:41] in because he can't see and they blind
[40:44] as ever they can't see too he said you
[40:46] are blind you lead the blind well did
[40:48] Des speak of you you have ears and can't
[40:50] hear eyes you can't see CU Isaiah said
[40:53] this is the spirit therefore the god of
[40:55] Heaven has blinded your eyes you're
[40:57] doing like Eve did accepting the
[40:59] intellectual side and know nothing of
[41:01] the spirit of
[41:04] God that's the message right now blind
[41:09] people have nice specials nice songs and
[41:12] everything else but
[41:16] blind why
[41:19] accepting the intellectual side and know
[41:23] nothing of the spirit of God therefore
[41:27] or won't they all fall in a ditch both
[41:30] the leader and the
[41:32] blind the leader will fall with the
[41:34] blind cuz he's blind too the leader fall
[41:36] that's blind leading the blind they both
[41:38] fall in a ditch then he continues God
[41:40] Alone hold this key he expressed the
[41:43] same thing in the previous scripture and
[41:45] so on like that therefore there is no
[41:47] school no theologians no teachings of
[41:50] the Bible among any school that knows
[41:53] anything about it they cannot know
[41:55] nothing about it it's impossible for
[41:57] them to know anything about it God has
[41:59] hid the senses of knowing it from the
[42:02] very elected
[42:05] teachers so in other words this book
[42:07] cannot be intellectually
[42:11] accessed this have to be accessed by
[42:15] spirit so a man could say the say the
[42:17] same quote read the same quote and he is
[42:19] talking from intellectually another man
[42:21] reading the same quote and he's
[42:22] accessing it by the spirit it is not the
[42:26] same one could go to the books and one
[42:28] could go to the angel oh give the Lord a
[42:30] shout Oh Glory to God Hallelujah
[42:33] Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah the
[42:35] book is there the tapes are there the
[42:38] text is there the scriptures are there
[42:40] but God told John go to the angel and
[42:42] say give me the book when you get the
[42:44] book from the angel oh give the Lord a
[42:46] shout hallelujah hallelujah glory to God
[42:49] the
[42:51] bookall hlj
[42:54] [Music]
[42:58] they cannot know
[43:00] it God has hid the senses of knowing it
[43:05] from the very elected teachers and
[43:07] everything else it's a personal affair
[43:11] with the person that Christ is revealed
[43:13] to them and if you say he's revealed to
[43:16] me and then the life that Christ
[43:17] produced in the Bible that same life is
[43:19] in him does not produce life in you then
[43:20] you get your own
[43:22] Revelation so the Revelation is not just
[43:25] text and talk the Revelation is the life
[43:29] being revealed because remember the
[43:30] church is himself revealed and if you
[43:33] are part of that church you will also
[43:36] reveal Christ because Paul was saying
[43:40] what I'm preaching is to produce Christ
[43:43] in you the hope of glory so what you'll
[43:46] be revealing or what you'll be
[43:48] projecting is Christ in you the hope of
[43:52] glory that mean you have to be
[43:54] disappearing
[43:58] hallah and Christ will be coming
[44:01] forward come on I want to hear say Amen
[44:05] that means they going to be you must
[44:07] decrease come on preach back to me
[44:09] somebody preach back to me somebody you
[44:12] must decrease your flesh man your human
[44:15] Spirit your self must decrease and he
[44:18] must increase and he increasing will be
[44:21] showing the
[44:23] pinenes oh give the Lord a shout glory
[44:26] to God and through you his presence will
[44:28] be projected His Image will be reflected
[44:32] oh help me preach somebody tonight oh
[44:36] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory
[44:39] to God so he said now
[44:42] watch he said if you
[44:46] say he has been revealed to me and then
[44:49] the life that Christ produced in the
[44:51] Bible that same life is in him does not
[44:53] produce itself in you then you got the
[44:56] wrong revelation
[44:57] the life of if the life of Jesus Christ
[45:01] ever puts forth another body of
[45:03] believers they will have books and
[45:05] they'll argue with other
[45:06] churches no have if the Life of Christ
[45:10] ever put out another but Bel body of
[45:13] Believers it will bear the fruit that
[45:15] the first one did they will write a book
[45:18] of Acts behind it not write new
[45:21] textbooks on the message not write new
[45:24] explanation books in the message or new
[45:26] Mysteries being revealed in the message
[45:28] they will write another book of Acts
[45:31] because it will be the same life you
[45:33] can't get away from it it's the Life of
[45:36] Christ in you being injected In You by
[45:40] the Holy Spirit itself living it life
[45:43] through you in other words you're
[45:45] getting
[45:46] inoculated from the virus of the world
[45:49] and when you get it injected inside of
[45:51] you it gets projected out of you oh
[45:54] glory to God there's another life coming
[45:56] inside of it that life going to give a
[45:58] repellent Hallelujah it will give
[46:00] opposition to the things of the world
[46:02] give the Lord a
[46:04] shout blind leaders of the blind notice
[46:07] god holds this key no Theologian can
[46:09] tell you it is not known they it from
[46:13] there if no Theologian can tell you how
[46:16] come a minister could boast I reveal her
[46:18] to you he's a revealer I thought the
[46:22] Holy Ghost alone is the revealer of the
[46:24] revelation of Jesus Christ so tonight
[46:26] tonight I can't reveal nothing to you I
[46:28] preach in the word but the Holy Ghost
[46:30] you in the spirit Holy Ghost could take
[46:32] that up and give you a revelation then

[53:05] church about Dees as a brother who love
[53:09] it to have preeminence among them
[53:14] receive us
[53:16] not the amplifier of that says I have
[53:18] written briefly to the church but Dees
[53:22] who likes to take the lead among them
[53:25] and put himself first does not
[53:27] acknowledge my authority and refuses to
[53:30] accept my suggestions or listen to
[53:34] me that is Pope
[53:40] Dees we have them Min
[53:42] message so we have brother Dees plurals
[53:46] in
[53:47] Trinidad and around the world they like
[53:50] the pre evidences they like to be on
[53:53] stage they like the mic yes hallu you
[53:58] want to be in charge and they have a big
[54:00] fight when people don't
[54:02] bow like
[54:07] modai so let's leave Dees and his drama
[54:11] alone so watch he borns in there he
[54:15] injects his own life and your life is
[54:18] gone and the life of Christ is
[54:21] projecting itself through you with the
[54:26] the people that they see the very life
[54:30] and works and signs and wonders that he
[54:32] did is doing the same thing through
[54:35] you you want to know the BM after that
[54:38] outside of that the rest of it is not
[54:39] even called to at
[54:42] all did you hear that brother George you
[54:45] hear that after that he said he said
[54:46] outside of that the rest of it is not
[54:47] even called to at all listen to this bum
[54:51] by lack of this Revelation is why we
[54:54] have so many different divisions Among
[54:56] Us
[54:57] so Revelations don't cause divisions is
[54:59] the lack of
[55:00] it the lack that God is Sovereign and he
[55:04] can reveal himself to whomsoever he will
[55:06] somebody back sitting a 100 years and
[55:08] God come down and reveal himself to them
[55:09] you can't stop that because you
[55:11] suffering oh give the Lord a shout
[55:14] hallelujah by lack of this Revelation is
[55:17] why we have so many different division
[55:19] among us so much mockery so much
[55:21] division Among Us is because the people
[55:24] lack that Revelation they lack that
[55:26] Revelation the teachers the teachers or
[55:30] the pastors or the well-known elected
[55:32] ministers they lack Revelation that is
[55:34] why you have div Vision they're not
[55:36] seeing the kingdom they seeing their
[55:37] group their Church they the bride and
[55:39] everybody else fals and their own and
[55:41] whatnot amen when God told the prophet
[55:44] pick a pen and WR he said many true
[55:46] ministers not false many true ministers
[55:49] will misunder understand that Prophet I
[55:52] can't said this one false and that's one
[55:53] false and that's one false some could be
[55:55] very true but they under
[55:57] misunderstand and with when you
[55:59] misunderstand you miss the boat you know
[56:02] you not just misunderstand it you know
[56:03] you miss it clean you know God has send
[56:05] no message of perfectionist last day for
[56:07] us to be right in spirit and wrong in
[56:08] Doctrine no we had the right in spirit
[56:10] and right in Doctrine too God has sent
[56:12] no message for us to be false in
[56:14] Doctrine and right in spirit we have a
[56:15] humble Spirit we nice and so on and
[56:17] you're off the word that's not it at all
[56:18] you know because the spirit is the
[56:20] spirit of Truth Give the Lord a shout in
[56:22] the house do you get it now the spirit
[56:24] is not just spirit it's the Spirit of
[56:27] Truth so the spirit of truth will only
[56:29] lead you to truth the spirit of Truth
[56:31] wouldn't give you a lie because it's the
[56:34] spirit of Truth itself and Truth is a
[56:36] person truth is Jesus Christ I am the
[56:38] way I am the truth I am the life oh give
[56:41] the Lord I shout in the house glory to
[56:44] God so truth is not just text truth is a
[56:46] person and Truth have a spirit behind it
[56:50] and just as you have the spirit of truth
[56:51] but I can't it have the spirit of error
[56:53] oh give the Lord a shout so somebody can
[56:56] ministering under the spirit of error
[56:58] speaking lies speaking false doctrine
[57:00] that the Bible talk about they will have
[57:01] itch in ears and turn from truth to
[57:06] fables
[57:09] my the Greek came and act says we would
[57:13] see
[57:14] Jesus but
[57:16] Bram now we find ourselves a finite we
[57:20] can make many mistakes I make more than
[57:23] all because we are finite but he is in F
[57:26] night he cannot make a mistake now I can
[57:29] promise you something and with the very
[57:30] best of my ability I can say I really
[57:32] mean that and then might not be able to
[57:34] fulfill what I promised because
[57:36] circumstances would alter cases but not
[57:37] so with God he cannot make a promise
[57:41] that he cannot fulfill Moses taught the
[57:44] same thing Abraham rather but he tackled
[57:46] on the promise of God through unbelief
[57:48] but was giv God praise to God for he was
[57:50] fully persuaded that what God had
[57:52] promised he was able to perform
[57:54] therefore all the scriptures that God
[57:55] has given to us our promises now we get
[57:59] ourselves worked up here we go in the
[58:01] human element of the time element the
[58:05] only thing we know is inches feets yards
[58:07] miles measurements days weeks hours
[58:08] months years but God is eternal we have
[58:12] limited powers limited intelligence but
[58:15] God is infinite in all things he knows
[58:18] all things he knew all things before the
[58:20] world began he knew this meeting would
[58:21] be here tonight he known all things
[58:24] before there was a world because he
[58:26] could could tell what would be the end
[58:28] time from the beginning and that makes
[58:30] him God sir nothing else no one else no
[58:33] other being no other person could ever
[58:34] do that but God Alone Now we sometime
[58:37] wonder why he's so great and why we
[58:39] don't see him more than we we do now
[58:42] through the blood here we go he sanctify
[58:45] a church that he might continue his work
[58:49] so when God came to pay this price he
[58:51] had an objective that true the blood now
[58:54] cuz we ourselves we can't do anything
[58:56] we finish but through the blood out out
[58:59] blood this is Jesus blood now he can
[59:02] sanctify a church that he might continue
[59:05] the work himself living in that church
[59:08] because God have certain laws and
[59:10] principles certain things Angels cannot
[59:12] do man have to do God have to use man to
[59:15] do a angel can't be a prophet a angel is
[59:18] a servant we are Sons oh give the Lord
[59:21] some Praises so God has to use the human
[59:24] element of the 16 element
[59:26] he had to pick up some flesh to step
[59:28] into it that he could communicate and
[59:30] speak to us and share himself with us oh
[59:34] give the Lord a shout in the house he
[59:36] sanctify a church that he might continue
[59:39] to work his work himself living in that
[59:41] church we are absolutely Unworthy of any
[59:45] blessing right right right right with me
[59:48] tonight Prophet is preaching tonight we
[59:50] are absolutely Unworthy of any blessing
[59:53] there is nothing that we could do to
[59:54] Merit it but by unmerited Grace God give
[59:57] us this privilege to be called his
[59:59] children his sons and his daughters
[1:00:02] sanctifying us as we confess our sins
[1:00:05] you have to confess your sins you have
[1:00:07] to repent and as you repent and you
[1:00:10] confess your sins he come sanctifying
[1:00:12] sanctify them through Thy word Thy word
[1:00:13] is truth oh give the Lord I shout every
[1:00:16] day you have to confess every day you
[1:00:18] have to repent every single day oh glory
[1:00:20] to God you put it all on the altar of
[1:00:22] God and let the blood deal with that
[1:00:25] Hallelujah s def find the world from us
[1:00:27] that he might work his way through Us by
[1:00:31] the Holy Spirit and do his work oh my oh
[1:00:34] my oh my brother Bram then God can
[1:00:37] manifest it in one man Jesus now we
[1:00:40] manifesting it in the entire church
[1:00:42] Universal everywhere God can work
[1:00:45] through every man and every woman that
[1:00:49] will open up their heart and let the
[1:00:51] Lord Jesus come in and work his will
[1:00:55] through them
[1:00:57] that's right but say thank you
[1:00:59] Lord God could work through every man
[1:01:02] and every woman that will open their
[1:01:05] heart and let the Lord Jesus come in and
[1:01:08] work his will through them I don't care
[1:01:10] if you don't even know your ABCs just
[1:01:13] the only thing you have to have is a
[1:01:15] humble submitted heart to God and God
[1:01:18] will work his will through you question
[1:01:22] do you believe that
[1:01:24] tonight do you believe that's the the
[1:01:26] you he talking about is
[1:01:28] you that not 100% some of your mouth
[1:01:30] still closed do you believe that this
[1:01:32] you he's talking about working through
[1:01:34] you is you he's talking about that's
[1:01:37] good that's good that's good let's
[1:01:40] [Music]
[1:01:42] continue
[1:01:44] Jesus he said no man eat it from thee
[1:01:47] and the tree withered away and brother
[1:01:49] brandham say as a man takeen his heart
[1:01:51] so is he he said now what he said wait a
[1:01:54] minute you say Have Faith In God I'm
[1:01:56] skipping now now you can express it by
[1:01:58] mental conception but if it becomes a
[1:02:01] real revelation of God you see it before
[1:02:05] it
[1:02:06] happened so so so so Abraham's
[1:02:09] revelation of Isaac wasn't just a
[1:02:11] thought in his
[1:02:13] mind he actually had
[1:02:16] Isaac he saw Isaac Isaac was the
[1:02:20] substance of his Fai you know he
[1:02:22] couldn't show his own wife it you know
[1:02:24] because it was a revelation from God
[1:02:27] hallelujah so he knew Isaac
[1:02:30] coming he is not going to produce it he
[1:02:33] is not going to get it out Sarah is
[1:02:36] through Sarah that life going to come
[1:02:38] but he had a revelation of it he knew it
[1:02:40] by Revelation Revelation is something
[1:02:42] that you just know you sense you see
[1:02:44] when Moses hide and say God help me help
[1:02:46] me and God rebuke him and say why cry
[1:02:47] speak of me forward then Moses raised up
[1:02:49] his hand mes fully know going stand
[1:02:51] still and see the salvation of God he's
[1:02:53] staring
[1:02:54] now because he catch back out of the
[1:02:57] human he he jump back out of his
[1:02:58] humanistic realm into the realm of faith
[1:03:00] into the arms of God where all things
[1:03:02] are possible where God could lead and
[1:03:04] God could die stretch forth thy
[1:03:07] rut Hallelujah when you open up rest he
[1:03:09] open
[1:03:10] up that never happened before Moses say
[1:03:13] God give me a give me a preview you see
[1:03:16] a preview of what coming give me a
[1:03:18] preview also you the holy St so hold it
[1:03:20] so hold it
[1:03:23] so there are things God will do with you
[1:03:25] that he never did with anybody
[1:03:28] else so you can't look for a
[1:03:31] preview because God dealing with you
[1:03:34] customize your experience for you
[1:03:41] Hallelujah so you say when you you can
[1:03:43] express in my mental conception but if
[1:03:45] it becomes a real revelation of God that
[1:03:47] you see it before it happen and express
[1:03:49] it in word form that word takes a hold
[1:03:53] and becomes material a thought Express
[1:03:57] if your heart and your mind is so
[1:04:00] infilled with God's spirit so he's
[1:04:03] prophesying here he's saying how it's
[1:04:05] going to be he's saying God's intent if
[1:04:07] your mind and heart is so infilled with
[1:04:10] God's spirit until your thoughts become
[1:04:13] his
[1:04:14] thoughts there you are when your mind
[1:04:18] and your leading and your guiding
[1:04:22] becomes a direct place or a direct
[1:04:26] inspiration of the Holy Spirit moving in
[1:04:29] your mortal
[1:04:31] being what kind of people should we be
[1:04:35] if the very Holy Spirit has you so
[1:04:38] embodied or empowered that you don't use
[1:04:41] your own thoughts you don't use your own
[1:04:43] mind you don't use your own opinion but
[1:04:46] the Holy Spirit has you so built until
[1:04:48] your thoughts and your being is God's
[1:04:52] spirit expressing itself through you
[1:04:58] am what kind of church would we be what
[1:05:02] kind of people would we be this morning
[1:05:04] if this brandom Tabernacle this morning
[1:05:06] was so filled with the presence of God
[1:05:09] why when you didn't even use your own
[1:05:11] mind you didn't use your own thoughts
[1:05:13] you didn't even have no alternative of
[1:05:15] your own but just to be led by your
[1:05:17] spirit and this here is where he dropped
[1:05:20] this
[1:05:21] bomb
[1:05:22] then when the human element goes out am
[1:05:27] I told the ministers in the Min
[1:05:28] Association already I said how could you
[1:05:30] get to the Holy Ghost when you haven't
[1:05:31] even got to the Trad
[1:05:33] Spirit a bun of people sitting down in
[1:05:35] the church with a triny spirit pure
[1:05:37] Trinidadian and they know word they know
[1:05:40] mystery they have understanding and they
[1:05:42] have knowledge but their Spirit have
[1:05:45] never been busted over them amen that
[1:05:47] why they fight and like you're American
[1:05:49] and you're American satellite and like
[1:05:52] you're foreign and we don't want no
[1:05:53] foreign thing and and and this local
[1:05:55] what you
[1:05:56] local flesh to prot to perfect local
[1:06:00] bride so that means somebody with a
[1:06:02] foreign flesh C come and Perfect Bride
[1:06:03] since when flesh perfecting right that
[1:06:05] is just Insanity that's just Madness but
[1:06:08] that's the kind of mental thing it had
[1:06:09] in the
[1:06:12] ear so in other words you have to go
[1:06:15] past so Germans have their Spirit ger St
[1:06:18] and what ger had to break out of that to
[1:06:20] get into the Holy Ghost French French
[1:06:22] France had a spirit America have the
[1:06:23] spirit English had a stiff stiff Spirit
[1:06:26] God to bust that out to get to the Holy
[1:06:28] Ghost but now he's talking beyond that
[1:06:30] now the human
[1:06:32] element when the human element goes out
[1:06:36] and the spirit of God fills that
[1:06:40] vacancy is this getting anywhere tonight

[1:07:27] judged I could see how people going to
[1:07:29] be judged in Trinidad and around the
[1:07:31] world when the Holy Spirit begin to play
[1:07:35] Sons and have the
[1:07:42] [Music]
[1:07:55] could see it and that's why I fought for
[1:07:57] two things main things brotherly

[1:11:10] element goes out and the spirit of God
[1:11:13] fills that vacancy where you empty
[1:11:16] yourself then will be when the church is
[1:11:20] in its power of the resurrection of the
[1:11:22] Lord Jesus Will walks in his steps
[1:11:25] in his power in his thoughts in his
[1:11:29] being in his moving see what I mean then
[1:11:32] your thoughts will become words and
[1:11:34] words will become
[1:11:36] material and then that is when the
[1:11:38] church will be in its power then he
[1:11:41] prophesied I believe it's on this road
[1:11:44] when the church will be so wrapped in
[1:11:47] Christ not in argument not in debate not
[1:11:50] in I right you wrong and you right and I
[1:11:52] wrong no not that when the church will
[1:11:54] be so wrapped in Christ the Holy Spirit
[1:11:58] mankind so away from theirselves they
[1:12:00] don't see themselves they have they no
[1:12:03] thoughts but to serve God their thoughts
[1:12:06] move on they refuse the things of the
[1:12:08] world they just move in the spirit live
[1:12:10] in the spirit move in the spirit walk in
[1:12:13] the spirit to fulfill the love of Christ
[1:12:16] then the love of Christ in the human
[1:12:18] heart moving in the Holy Ghost that
[1:12:22] great wonderful church will go forth
[1:12:24] with power and deity because
[1:12:29] deity will be revealed in human beings
[1:12:33] by the Holy Spirit bringing to pass the
[1:12:36] thought of their
[1:12:40] [Music]
[1:12:44] mindu
[1:12:46] Hallelujah that not a know that not a
[1:12:48] good text and a message you know this is
[1:12:51] for Real
[1:12:56] GL he said compassion is doing the will
[1:12:58] of
[1:12:59] God we mix it all today we put the human
[1:13:03] element to it like in love we try to use
[1:13:06] love God's love like we do human love
[1:13:08] you cannot fall in love with God like
[1:13:10] you do your wife you cannot fall in love
[1:13:12] with God like it do your husband or your
[1:13:14] girlfriend or boyfriend it's two
[1:13:15] different loves one is the Greek word
[1:13:17] are different one of them is called
[1:13:18] filio that's the love you have for your
[1:13:20] wife that kind of love would make you
[1:13:22] kill a man over jealousy but agapo love
[1:13:24] which is Godly love instead of killing a
[1:13:26] man you'll pray for his sinful
[1:13:28] soul and we get the human element mixed
[1:13:32] up with the Christian Godly
[1:13:35] element are you ready with me tonight
[1:13:38] then we just got a big mess out of it
[1:13:41] because we only know inches feets miles
[1:13:43] so forth ounces and pounds and so forth
[1:13:45] that's what we know we are time people
[1:13:47] God is eternal he has no inches no miles
[1:13:49] no yesterday no tomorrow it's eternity
[1:13:51] with
[1:13:53] him and we to bring God's infinite mind
[1:13:56] down to our little finite mind we just
[1:13:58] get mixed up so the best thing in doing
[1:14:00] it is reading his word remember in his
[1:14:02] word will not contradict
[1:14:04] itself wow we going real
[1:14:07] good but brandham if you notice it is
[1:14:11] always those who trying to get away from
[1:14:13] it that God
[1:14:14] uses as long as a man wants to do
[1:14:16] something and thinks he's got enough
[1:14:18] ability he can't put over a job over God
[1:14:20] can never use that man look at Moses
[1:14:23] running Paul running all the rest of
[1:14:24] them running
[1:14:25] I said don't seek nothing if God got
[1:14:27] anything for you he'll give it to you
[1:14:29] instead of trying to be
[1:14:31] great what
[1:14:34] punch they they should the great
[1:14:37] ones
[1:14:39] George instead of trying to be great we
[1:14:41] ought to be trying to find how little we
[1:14:43] can get that should be a goal then that
[1:14:46] should be our ambition how small I could
[1:14:48] get
[1:14:51] boy then God can use us notice the
[1:14:55] weakest and the rejected and practically
[1:14:57] every hero God ever had on the front
[1:14:59] line was that type of person a person
[1:15:01] that was rejected a person that thought
[1:15:03] he was insufficient a person that had no
[1:15:05] ability at all then that's a person just
[1:15:07] in good shape so God can start using
[1:15:09] them when they feel like they can't they
[1:15:13] haven't got nothing that's when God can
[1:15:15] take a hold of them and do something
[1:15:18] with them but when we are thinking we
[1:15:20] are able to do it God can't use us
[1:15:24] because because we are wanting to do it
[1:15:27] ourselves now the other side we get
[1:15:29] these feelings and we think that we're
[1:15:30] insufficient and we don't want to do it
[1:15:32] but if we listen to the call of God
[1:15:33] that's the very thing God want to you
[1:15:35] get us into the kind of shape so he can
[1:15:38] oh here we go when we are insufficient
[1:15:41] ourselves here we go then we are subject
[1:15:45] to yield to God's spirit so that's why
[1:15:48] the Arrogant proud boastful character
[1:15:51] they yielding to no Spirit they yielding
[1:15:53] to their brains the head the G
[1:15:56] matter that's what heing too you could
[1:15:59] see it you could pick it up they walk
[1:16:01] with pride they walk with arrogance they
[1:16:03] walk with KN it all and everything else
[1:16:05] there's no yielding there because they
[1:16:07] study so much them spoken with books and
[1:16:08] their Bible and books and thing that
[1:16:10] they they have a frow they head
[1:16:15] high when we are insufficient ourselves
[1:16:17] then we are subject to yield to God's
[1:16:20] spirit as long as we think we can do it
[1:16:22] then we can't do it but when we get to a
[1:16:24] place I'm almost done where we are
[1:16:27] trying to do it we'll fail but if we'll
[1:16:29] yield ourselves to God then God can fail
[1:16:32] there's only one thing God cannot do and
[1:16:34] that is fail so as long as we are trying
[1:16:36] in ourselves and dependent upon our own
[1:16:38] abilities we'll do
[1:16:40] nothing here we go the most the
[1:16:43] important thing one of the important
[1:16:45] things that we must master master
[1:16:48] remember this especially young preachers
[1:16:49] lay members alike there's one thing we
[1:16:52] have got to master if we expect to
[1:16:53] fulfill God's desire in our Liv life is
[1:16:55] we have to master the thought of human
[1:16:58] ability if we get to a spot where we
[1:17:00] think we can do it with our intelligence
[1:17:02] our abilities we have got to master in
[1:17:04] such a way that we can get rid of the
[1:17:06] thing and later sight so that God can
[1:17:08] use us and make a complete surrender we
[1:17:10] cannot use one ability we have got to
[1:17:12] make a surrender to come to God you've
[1:17:16] got to surrender to him soul body Spirit
[1:17:20] everything that you has has to be
[1:17:21] surrender to God in order that he can
[1:17:23] work his will in you and in me I telling
[1:17:25] the choir people who sing and sing I
[1:17:26] don't want your voice I want you to own
[1:17:29] the
[1:17:30] song So when you sing the song the song
[1:17:32] is yours then you become the song you
[1:17:36] sing it and it becomes your song and you
[1:17:39] sing it from your heart if you just sing
[1:17:41] it because you have a nice voice it's
[1:17:43] just the voice going it has no effect
[1:17:46] but when you take the song and make it
[1:17:48] your song this is my
[1:17:51] story this is my song it must be yours
[1:17:54] amen
[1:17:55] Hallelujah and when it becomes yours the
[1:17:57] anointing is with you oh glory to God
[1:18:00] give the Lord some
[1:18:02] Praises same thing with
[1:18:05] preaching when it's revealed to me or I
[1:18:08] get it by inspiration it's m so when I
[1:18:11] come here I have the anointing for it
[1:18:13] because of how I got it if I say it back
[1:18:16] because somebody say it and I say it I
[1:18:17] say let because they say it too and it's
[1:18:19] s good it's the right thing to say but
[1:18:21] it's not mine but when I get it by
[1:18:23] inspiration I own it
[1:18:25] it is M because you reveal it and have
[1:18:29] the authority to speak it oh give the
[1:18:31] Lord some Praises Hallelujah so
[1:18:34] everything that you have has to s be
[1:18:36] surrendered to God in order that he can
[1:18:39] work his will in you and me now that's
[1:18:40] hard I know because we always wanted to
[1:18:43] put our part in something that we know
[1:18:45] you know we want to do it and so on I
[1:18:46] know it should be done this way as long
[1:18:49] as you're doing it that way it's going
[1:18:50] to be wrong God will never use that
[1:18:52] effort maybe with the help of the Lord
[1:18:54] we're going to get into a few minutes
[1:18:55] and so like that he said that's oh skip
[1:18:58] down now when we are expecting saying
[1:19:01] this guy he's a great person there's a
[1:19:03] great person I lean on him that
[1:19:04] displeases God ministers will preach
[1:19:07] that because they want to be the great
[1:19:08] one mighty one you had to hold your
[1:19:10] briefcase for them and open the door for
[1:19:11] them and so on right right this is a
[1:19:13] great person lean on him that displeases
[1:19:16] God when you do that we must lean upon
[1:19:18] God and God Alone we mustn't trust the
[1:19:22] ability of ourselves or any man
[1:19:25] or any what any man we must completely
[1:19:29] yield to God no ability I don't care
[1:19:32] what it is will never be usable in the
[1:19:34] sight of God God had to get all of our
[1:19:36] abilities out of us before he can
[1:19:39] achieve his purpose if he's got
[1:19:41] something for us to do as long as we
[1:19:43] feel that we're doing a pretty good job
[1:19:44] out of it he never able use of God now
[1:19:47] you say you're making an awful broad
[1:19:48] statement in brother Bram that's a broad
[1:19:50] one but just look around and find out
[1:19:51] whether it's right or
[1:19:53] not look around today and our
[1:19:55] achievement look at the churches and the
[1:19:57] nominations worse than ever was in the
[1:19:59] beginning and it's true right now it is
[1:20:02] worse off today it ever was I've been
[1:20:04] this message 975 and right now it's the
[1:20:07] very
[1:20:08] worst that people wouldn't talk to you
[1:20:11] people want way on their own worse and
[1:20:14] they actually think that they're bride
[1:20:16] yes I find it so
[1:20:18] mental they supposed to know it's
[1:20:20] tribulation material they part of
[1:20:22] because that cannot be the bride the
[1:20:25] bride car be in hatred the bride car be
[1:20:27] in jealousy the the bride can be
[1:20:29] insecure who you call insecure bride
[1:20:31] you're still marrying
[1:20:33] me you still marrying me when bam
[1:20:36] dramatized about that bride when the man
[1:20:38] promised to marry her and she washing
[1:20:39] dishes in the back she believe it you
[1:20:40] know she received it you know she start
[1:20:43] to prepare you know they laugh at her
[1:20:44] preparing you know because he said
[1:20:46] coming back same time next year he
[1:20:47] didn't tell nobody else that she alone
[1:20:49] had that Revelation and she was
[1:20:51] preparing and the dress and the thing
[1:20:52] and that day come she preparing herself
[1:20:54] oh no they laughing
[1:20:55] they take put it on Facebook everything
[1:20:56] else but the man did come oh give the
[1:20:59] Lord some
[1:21:00] Praises
[1:21:04] Hallelujah so we have to forget our own
[1:21:06] ability we need a place of yielding to
[1:21:08] the spirit instead of so much depend
[1:21:10] upon schooling and programs history
[1:21:13] proves that God always chooses the
[1:21:16] nobodies to become a somebodies God
[1:21:19] takes that person to be nothing mus come
[1:21:21] up please but talk about Moses he's
[1:21:25] talking about Moses 5 minutes in the
[1:21:27] presence of the burning bush he he
[1:21:29] learned more than 40 years in Egypt 5
[1:21:32] minutes encounter 40 years with books
[1:21:34] and tapes in the message and 5 minutes
[1:21:36] encounter change you change you change
[1:21:40] Ministry everything else here brother
[1:21:45] Abraham when Moses get that experience
[1:21:47] I'm going to Egypt to take over a
[1:21:48] one-man Invasion going against the
[1:21:51] greater in number than all the world
[1:21:53] chariots Horsemen spearmen Bowman of
[1:21:55] Egypt one little old wrinkle up 80-year
[1:21:58] old man with a stick in his hand and the
[1:22:01] white whiskers blowing going down to
[1:22:02] Egypt to take over and the thing of it
[1:22:04] was he did it hear this is the closing
[1:22:08] part he did it because he had been alone
[1:22:13] with
[1:22:14] God when have you heard that
[1:22:17] phrase
[1:22:19] alone with
[1:22:21] God there is where the church needs
[1:22:23] tonight is not some fantastic not some
[1:22:26] new denomination but to be
[1:22:29] alone with God all selfishness all
[1:22:34] malice all fear all unbelief just Fades
[1:22:38] away and God becomes preeminent there it
[1:22:42] is that is what will make a person
[1:22:45] different that is what made Moses
[1:22:48] different that is what will make you
[1:22:51] different I you prepare to go alone
[1:22:55] with God am you begin to play something
[1:22:58] Sly but is talking about the Masterpiece
[1:23:01] The Perfect
[1:23:02] Image the God
[1:23:04] man God and morphe had changed from the
[1:23:07] supernatural to the vision here we go
[1:23:11] and the vision was projected into an
[1:23:14] image and the image was smitten so the
[1:23:17] supernatural could taste the feeling of
[1:23:18] debt God's perfect
[1:23:21] Masterpiece he could not do it in Moses
[1:23:24] he he could not do it in the prophets
[1:23:25] Isaiah who was sord with SED he was s to
[1:23:27] Pieces he couldn't do it in the prophets
[1:23:29] that were stoned he could not do it
[1:23:30] because he couldn't feel it they were
[1:23:33] just a portion of him but in this
[1:23:36] perfect
[1:23:37] Masterpiece he was the fullness of the
[1:23:39] godhead body he not only project Moses
[1:23:42] he could project his entire being into
[1:23:45] this person and taste debt for the whole
[1:23:48] human race God's perfect Masterpiece so
[1:23:52] inspired by seeing it
[1:23:55] all promises was met in him he was the
[1:23:57] Perfection of the Perfection our kinsman
