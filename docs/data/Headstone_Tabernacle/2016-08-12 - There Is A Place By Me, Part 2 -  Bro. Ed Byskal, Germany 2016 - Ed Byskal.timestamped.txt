[29:07] to say a few words to you
[29:10] tonight of something God put on my heart
[29:13] and then we'll take the prayer
[29:16] requests and I want also to testify that
[29:20] I've been very very blessed attending
[29:22] this
[29:23] convention and it's wonderful to be
[29:26] almost once
[29:28] week together in one place one
[29:32] Accord focusing our eyes on the Lord
[29:35] Jesus Christ and his word the Reb word
[29:39] of the hour and just fellowshipping with
[29:42] Brothers and Sisters in Christ it's just
[29:46] a an osis you know of of Peace of joy of
[29:51] faith and I believe God knew we needed
[29:54] that am because we live in very hard
[29:57] times as we all know and and God wants
[30:00] to strengthen us so God gives us always
[30:03] the best so uh I really want to thank
[30:07] brother sigar col brener and his team
[30:10] for following the leadership of the holy
[30:13] spirit
[30:14] amen amen I believe that
[30:22] amen and I really believe as it was
[30:25] already said that it was God who planed
[30:28] it and God who organized it and I really
[30:32] appreciate brother Sigmar Spirit of
[30:35] wanting to draw a bigger
[30:38] Circle amen amen amen praise the
[30:43] Lord
[30:45] amen because it's true that it's quite
[30:48] unique that uh brothers and sisters who
[30:51] may have different understandings of
[30:54] certain points of the message can just
[30:57] stay for days under the same roof and
[31:01] worship together and smile at each other
[31:03] and and hug each other you know it's
[31:06] it's a miracle amen praise the Lord for
[31:14] that amen and I be I believe that God
[31:18] has given us this week his best
[31:21] ministers for this occasion and each one
[31:25] with a different flavor a different
[31:28] inspiration but all of them pointing us
[31:31] to the same Lord Jesus Christ who has
[31:34] been revealed in the last
[31:37] days so personally I was really inspired
[31:41] by everything I saw and heard and I was
[31:45] also deeply moved in my heart a few
[31:48] times I had to help with the
[31:50] translations and the French speaking
[31:52] noticed it sometimes I could hardly
[31:55] translate I was so moved
[31:58] you know uh tears were coming to my eyes
[32:00] when I would hear the word and the
[32:03] testimonies of the reality of God Jesus
[32:06] Christ
[32:07] today no I just love that just love that
[32:11] you know
[32:14] amen
[32:16] amen and um I know some of you we have
[32:19] known each other for a number of years
[32:22] it's so good whether here or elsewhere
[32:25] to be able to see one another and to say
[32:28] God bless you brother God bless you
[32:29] Sister by God's grace we are still on
[32:32] the way amen by God's grace in spite of
[32:36] all the attacks of the devil who are
[32:39] still standing on the word Standing on
[32:42] the Promises we thank God for that
[32:47] amen it is not us holding him it is him
[32:51] holding us he's so good praise the Lord
[32:55] for that and I also share brother
[32:58] sigar's burden for the young
[33:01] people because you young people will
[33:04] love you we appreciate you and you are
[33:07] the future of any church we don't know
[33:11] how long the Lord will car before he
[33:13] comes back but somebody has to fill our
[33:17] shoes somebody has to carry on and take
[33:20] the torch and move on it will be you so
[33:26] I believe in you I believe in the
[33:29] potential that God has put in you and
[33:33] we're just here just not to make
[33:35] decisions for you are just here to
[33:37] encourage you to to pray for you to to
[33:41] help you to coach you we want you to
[33:44] succeed with
[33:48] Christ and all of us myself included we
[33:54] have been following somebody footstep
[33:57] steps I am what I am today at 66 years
[34:01] old because God has put before me men or
[34:06] women of God real Christians who were
[34:10] examples to me in my family in the
[34:14] church in the ministry here and overseas
[34:17] people who have been a a help a blessing
[34:20] an encouragement to me amen and I I
[34:23] thank the Lord so much that we have you
[34:26] know Role Models examples that we can
[34:34] follow amen thank you Lord for
[34:39] that and also want to thank God for
[34:42] putting the right people on my path from
[34:46] my birth until today just to to help me
[34:50] to encourage me and several of these
[34:54] people are right here brother add or
[34:57] different ones are some of them who have
[35:00] really encouraged me and helped me along
[35:03] the way and I want to be grateful for
[35:07] that and I believe that we are living in
[35:11] a tremendous time we all know that it's
[35:14] getting better and better for the bride
[35:17] and worse and worse for the world but
[35:20] one thing that that has struck me years
[35:23] ago that that is coming becoming more
[35:27] and more plain as years go by is that is
[35:31] that I believe that we live right now in
[35:34] the
[35:35] apocalypse you know it's a Greek word
[35:38] meaning Revelation it's a great
[35:41] unveiling
[35:43] time and uh and it's a privilege that
[35:47] you and I have been chosen by God to
[35:50] live in the last days no in the days
[35:55] where everything comes to to a
[35:57] completion to
[36:00] a um to a climax you know it won't go
[36:04] any further the good and the bad just
[36:08] arrive to the top to the climax and you
[36:12] and I we are partakers and Spectators of
[36:16] what's
[36:19] happening and uh different Brothers have
[36:23] mentioned that which I really believe
[36:25] that are our calling is to make the word
[36:30] of God real to the people and I really
[36:35] want that I really love that I really
[36:37] need that I love theology even though I
[36:41] am not a theologian never went to Bible
[36:43] School have no degree but I love to see
[36:47] that word becoming
[36:49] real I want something that is a
[36:53] reality and I believe you and I we have
[36:56] been given the the privilege of uh of
[37:00] having a part in God's word becoming a
[37:03] reality in these last
[37:08] days and um concerning the young people
[37:13] I have gone through that stage I was
[37:16] raised by a believing mother and
[37:19] believing
[37:21] grandparents and U it was a great help
[37:24] to me they believed in God God they
[37:27] trusted God so for a number of years I
[37:30] benefited from their faith their
[37:34] experiences with God but it was a good
[37:38] surrounding but the T the day came when
[37:41] God saw that I needed to make my own
[37:45] experiences with God to have not a
[37:48] secondhand Faith or Revelation but to
[37:51] have a firsthand faith in Revelation
[37:55] amen and and in my life by God's grace
[37:58] it started at a young age I was blessed
[38:01] to hear brother Tim also mentioned how
[38:04] at 5 years old God dealt with him I was
[38:07] a little older I was eight and a half
[38:10] when God started to deal with me in a
[38:12] Pentecostal church and I gave my heart
[38:16] to the Lord I accepted him as my
[38:18] personal Savior and Lord and this is a
[38:21] choice I have never never regretted I
[38:25] had my ups and downs my good days and
[38:27] bad days but that choice I never
[38:31] regretted
[38:33] it and uh to know that there was
[38:36] somebody somewhere who loved me more
[38:38] than anyone else who cared for me who
[38:42] wanted to bless me to strengthen me to
[38:45] guide me I needed that as a little boy I
[38:49] needed a a real father who looked after
[38:53] me and God revealed himself to me inide
[38:56] such a matter in such a
[38:58] way and um and about a year later I was
[39:04] uh in Denmark with my mother and there
[39:07] alone in a room I had a an encounter
[39:10] with God I had I had been a good boy on
[39:14] that day and my mom was disappointed
[39:16] with me and she she went to church by
[39:19] herself I said alone in the room I got
[39:21] on my knees said Lord forgive me help me
[39:24] Lord to be a better boy
[39:27] and every time this is my testimony
[39:30] every time I can humble myself make
[39:33] myself little he comes down and he came
[39:37] down and after me repenting and asking
[39:40] for his help he just fill my heart with
[39:44] his Joy with his peace and when I was
[39:48] watching brother brother Kenny this
[39:50] morning and at about the same age as me
[39:53] and just having so much energy and to
[39:56] praise the Lord and to to testify and
[39:59] everything well it brought me back to
[40:01] that time when I was 9 and a half and
[40:04] the Holy Spirit came down upon me I
[40:07] couldn't worship or praise the Lord in
[40:09] my language French anymore I had no more
[40:13] words but then something Supernatural
[40:16] happened and God gave me other words and
[40:18] other language to continue to praise Him
[40:21] amen and I was so happy just overflowing
[40:25] I was just just jumping from one bed to
[40:28] the other just praising the Lord in
[40:31] unknown tongues Hallelujah so so just
[40:35] looking at my brother he just brought me
[40:37] back to that experience I say Lord um a
[40:41] few more years now but Lord I want to
[40:43] keep that Joy I want to keep that
[40:46] enthusiasm to to serve you to know you
[40:50] to please
[40:52] you and uh about six months later I was
[40:56] not quite 10 years old again had I had
[40:59] had a bad day I even rebelled against
[41:03] God because I was going through
[41:05] hardships and things and but then I had
[41:08] to repent because that was wrong God is
[41:11] never guilty for uh your your troubles
[41:15] and your problems no God is a good god
[41:20] so once again I had to get on my knees
[41:22] say oh God I'm sorry forgive me for my
[41:25] Rebellion
[41:27] Lord you are not at fault you are good
[41:30] you are right you are love and
[41:34] again I guess my repentance pleased God
[41:37] and again something came in me and God
[41:42] started to speak to me inwardly I was
[41:45] just a little boy I just say that not to
[41:48] uh speak about myself or to uh lift up
[41:52] myself but just to encourage the young
[41:54] people don't wait too long long don't
[41:57] wait until you
[41:59] are 30 40 50 60 to think about
[42:03] surrendering your life to the Lord the
[42:05] sooner the better that's what I believe
[42:09] amen the sooner the
[42:11] better it's just to say it's
[42:15] possible it's possible so what what am I
[42:19] doing
[42:20] just trying to tell you follow these
[42:24] footsteps I'm not a perfect example but
[42:27] God has been good to me God has been
[42:29] gracious to me and this is my prayer and
[42:32] my desire for each one of you young
[42:36] people especially and older people too
[42:39] just keep your eyes on the Lord Jesus
[42:42] keep your eyes on the word put him first
[42:45] in your
[42:46] life you know he will be so good so
[42:49] sweet to you you will never regret it so
[42:53] as I was on my knees again just asking
[42:55] God to forgive me for my rebellion and
[42:58] my mistakes and my my bad
[43:03] behavior again he spoke to my heart and
[43:07] these are the words he spoke to me which
[43:10] can be good for all of us he said my son
[43:14] listen to my
[43:18] voice for my word is the truth and then
[43:22] he went on saying that he wanted me to
[43:24] preach his word
[43:27] so like brother Tim said he said I have
[43:29] always known God had called me to preach
[43:31] the word so when it's a calling it comes
[43:34] from him it's not something that we make
[43:37] up so God was so good and in in the
[43:40] early 60s I was just a young boy in my
[43:44] teens I was given a book with a black
[43:48] cover and a big red cross and it was the
[43:51] French translation of a book a man sent
[43:53] from God and there's a Bo boy I read
[43:56] that book you know that book a man sent
[44:00] from God it spoke about the calling and
[44:03] the the life of William Branham a man
[44:06] sent from God In Our Generation and as a
[44:09] boy I read that book along with my
[44:12] Bible and I was so moved to see how the
[44:16] Lord called him out of a poor family and
[44:20] the trials he went through and also the
[44:22] way God used him and and glorified
[44:25] himself through through him I was just
[44:27] so blessed and I said Lord I wish that I
[44:32] could meet this man one day that was my
[44:35] dream because I was so impressed by the
[44:39] dedication the humility and the reality
[44:43] of God in the life and Ministry of this
[44:46] man but at the end of 65 I already in
[44:49] the local paper that the Evangelist
[44:52] William brunham had passed away due to a
[44:55] car accident and I was so sad my dream
[44:59] couldn't be fulfilled but a few years
[45:02] later a minister came to loan
[45:05] Switzerland told us that we lived in the
[45:07] last days and said that God fulfilled
[45:11] his word his promise according to
[45:13] Malachi 4 that he God had sent a prophet
[45:17] with the spirit of Elijah and this man
[45:20] said I have met this man I know him his
[45:23] name is William Maran Bram
[45:26] when I heard that name I said it brought
[45:28] me back to that book a medine from God
[45:31] and I said that evangelist is also God's
[45:34] Prophet oh it
[45:37] really Drew my attention if is really
[45:41] God's end time Prophet what did he say
[45:45] so I'm just saying that to you I was 18
[45:47] so you young people of about 18 years
[45:51] old have an interest for the word be
[45:54] curious look for yourself read for
[45:58] yourself listen for
[46:00] yourself you know everyone needs his own
[46:04] personal
[46:05] experience and I thank God because you
[46:08] know
[46:09] what to make us real Christians it's
[46:12] more than just had knowledge it's much
[46:15] more than Theology and Theory the word
[46:19] must be become flesh in us and it can
[46:22] only become flesh in us when we go
[46:25] through personal
[46:27] experiences just to give you a very
[46:29] simple example to make it very plain
[46:32] parents tell their children please don't
[46:34] touch the stove it's hot you will get
[46:37] burnt some obey listen some
[46:41] don't and maybe some children they just
[46:45] want to try when no nobody's looking so
[46:48] the time when they just put their hand
[46:50] on the hot stove what happens they get
[46:53] burnt immediately
[46:56] they they start screaming and Mom or Dad
[47:00] run to their rescue it's a painful
[47:04] experience but it's very
[47:07] positive because from the that day on
[47:11] they know for sure that the stove is hot
[47:15] that's right nobody can talk them out of
[47:18] it they are
[47:20] convinced so I believe that we need you
[47:24] need I need more more experiences with
[47:27] God the word says one thing the message
[47:30] says one thing that's tremendous but
[47:32] that's not enough we must experience it
[47:37] personally and then the word and us
[47:40] become one and then you are
[47:43] unshakable nobody can make you change
[47:46] your mind you know that you know that
[47:49] you
[47:52] knowen so when I heard that I said man
[47:56] if William Brenham is God's Prophet what
[47:59] message did he
[48:00] bring in those days there was hardly
[48:04] anything translated in the French
[48:06] language so I I was able to get a hold
[48:09] of a few books in English the Seven
[48:12] Seals seven Church AG book and a few
[48:15] others and with the help of a dictionary
[48:17] and just a very small knowledge of the
[48:20] English language I started to read these
[48:24] books that was
[48:26] my choice that was my experience my
[48:29] desire I wanted to know what this man
[48:33] sent from God had spoken to
[48:36] us it was not second hand it was first
[48:40] hand and one thing it produced in my
[48:43] life it shook me
[48:48] up I had been a Christian for 10
[48:53] years had spiritual gifts experienced
[48:56] Divine Healing water baptism in the
[48:59] titles and things like that but when I I
[49:02] was reading these books of this
[49:06] Prophet I realize one thing if Jesus
[49:10] comes today I am not
[49:15] ready it was as though I was standing
[49:19] before my
[49:21] judge like the brothers have expressed
[49:24] when they preached
[49:26] like brother George or brother Kenny or
[49:29] different ones or brother Ed
[49:32] also when we stand before that word
[49:35] which is God we cannot hide anything he
[49:39] knows everything about
[49:41] us maybe nobody knew certain things but
[49:44] God
[49:44] knew and before that word I understood
[49:49] is is no time to play now be
[49:52] serious so young people I want to
[49:54] encourage you
[49:56] let the word of God judge your
[49:59] life don't take it just to increase your
[50:03] your knowledge that's not enough this
[50:06] word is meant to judge
[50:08] you not only outwardly but also
[50:12] inwardly even your thoughts are being
[50:15] judged but what is beautiful about it
[50:19] it's a judgment under grace it was not a
[50:23] judgment to condemn me it was a judgment
[50:26] to help
[50:27] me it was like God saying there's a
[50:30] Rapture in front of you Jesus will come
[50:33] back for a Perfect Bride if you want to
[50:36] go you need to go through a quality
[50:41] check and studying this word this
[50:44] message it was just exposing my life to
[50:47] the word and saying lord judge me judge
[50:50] me give me that quality check Lord I
[50:54] don't want to miss the rapture I want to
[50:56] be a part of that perfect blameless
[51:00] spotless
[51:01] bride so that's that's the way God has
[51:04] dealt with me I just pray can maybe help
[51:07] some of
[51:09] you and then I thought my I need more of
[51:13] that word this I just have two or three
[51:15] books but that's not enough there's a
[51:18] whole message so I decided to quit my
[51:21] job at the bank and go to the United
[51:23] States to get more of the
[51:26] message I I I put aside my my career in
[51:31] the bank in Switzerland and I said no
[51:34] this comes first this is important and I
[51:38] believe we live in a time and day when
[51:42] the word must come first before anything
[51:46] else you study you have plans you have
[51:49] Ambitions you have many things like that
[51:52] but let this word come first in your
[51:54] life
[51:56] I just say that because I can just give
[51:58] God thanks today he has been so good so
[52:01] gracious to me so kind so sweet and I
[52:05] believe that by his grace and I don't
[52:08] say that to be boastful I just say that
[52:10] to glorify God Amen I believe that my
[52:14] life in spite of my failures in spite of
[52:17] my mistakes in spite of my ups and downs
[52:20] My Life as a human being has been a
[52:23] success for God
[52:27] that's my testimony be encouraged God
[52:30] wants your life each one of you
[52:33] especially you young people to be a
[52:35] success for
[52:37] Christ a life worth living on the
[52:41] earth I believe God wants that for each
[52:43] one of us because we are his bride we
[52:46] are precious in His
[52:49] sight he cares for us like for the apple
[52:52] of his
[52:54] eye
[52:57] and personally I'm always looking for
[53:00] reality you know I don't like just to to
[53:04] look at the at a facade I want to know
[53:07] what's behind
[53:09] it to me I'm not satisfied with just a
[53:13] Pious facade a cover up or a form of
[53:17] godliness in my life in the life of my
[53:21] people I want
[53:24] reality and I believe that God has given
[53:27] us this message it's a message like no
[53:29] other message we know that no it's a
[53:32] message that exposes
[53:35] us and there's a scripture I would like
[53:37] to leave with you trust brother sigar
[53:41] not taking too much time but just
[53:42] sharing something on my heart but I stop
[53:46] as soon as possible in Luke 12 1 and two
[53:49] I believe it applies to our time beware
[53:53] ye of the leaven of the phes which is
[53:58] hypocrisy for there's nothing
[54:01] covered that shall not be revealed
[54:05] Apocalypto revealed unveiled neither
[54:09] head that shall not be
[54:13] known I believe you and I will live in
[54:16] the last days but it's a time when God
[54:20] unveils reveals everything I say
[54:24] everything
[54:26] in every domain in in everything there's
[54:29] an unveiling a general worldwide
[54:33] unveiling of everything because the
[54:36] scripture must be fulfilled but to me a
[54:39] beautiful age because when everything is
[54:41] unveiled everything becomes clear
[54:45] there's no guessing about it
[54:47] anymore before I was praying a Triune
[54:51] God the Father the Son and the Holy
[54:53] Ghost I was confused
[54:55] but when through the message God
[54:57] unveiled himself it became
[54:59] clear I'm worshiping and praying to one
[55:03] God who has
[55:06] different offices different functions
[55:10] but it's always one when things become
[55:12] clear you know where you can stand it's
[55:15] so good I don't like to be the something
[55:18] that is foggy hazy you don't know where
[55:21] you are I like it very clear this is
[55:24] what the message has brought to me
[55:26] something making things
[55:34] clear and since the opening of the seeds
[55:37] in 1963 this is what I saw I don't know
[55:41] what you saw but what I
[55:43] saw Jesus Christ unveiled
[55:46] himself but he also unveiled the devil
[55:49] who was hiding under a camouflage now we
[55:53] know how to recogn the devil in whatever
[55:57] form he comes but also since then we can
[56:00] see so many things in the world being
[56:02] unveiled in politics in the finance in
[56:06] everything thank you
[56:10] brother and and I believe this is a
[56:13] great day everything is coming to the
[56:15] open in sports in everything what a
[56:18] great day and God has chosen you and I
[56:22] to live in that day so now
[56:25] this is my heart's desire now that we
[56:28] live in the time of the open book
[56:30] brother braham's life was an open book
[56:33] to us and I pray that my life your life
[56:37] will also be an open book
[56:40] transparency hiding nothing being what
[56:43] we are what God made us good or bad
[56:46] let's be sincere let's be real and I
[56:49] believe that God will
[56:51] just bless us and use us to his glory so
[56:55] I just uh want to give God thanks and
[56:58] praise for being so good to me and uh
[57:02] God is good to you too praise the Lord
[57:04] for that
[57:11] amen and I pray that all of us will be
[57:13] able to pray like the Lord Jesus father
[57:17] I have glorified thee on the earth I
[57:21] have finished the work which thou gavest
[57:24] me me to do like we we've heard this
[57:27] week we all have something to do for the
[57:30] Lord Let's Be Active but let us finish
[57:33] that work and glorify God in everything

[57:39] called for that so tonight we have a few
[57:42] prayer requests very serious prayer

[59:48] to the
[59:50] Lord we have heard so much preach to us
[59:54] about about who we are AOS in the word
[59:58] AOS in
[59:59] Christ so we all believe that with all
[1:00:02] of our heart but now as God has revealed
[1:00:06] to us who we are what position we have
[1:00:09] in the body of
[1:00:11] Christ may God just Quicken these words

[1:20:33] having a rejoicing time and and now
[1:20:36] we're ready for the
[1:20:38] word uh just before we read the
[1:20:41] scripture uh I'm going to have our
[1:20:44] brother Tim
[1:20:45] Dodd uh I thought it would
[1:20:49] be very appropriate for this body of of
[1:20:53] people
[1:20:55] to to hear uh what is just taking place
[1:20:59] in just two places and it'll be very
[1:21:02] very brief I've asked the brothers to
[1:21:04] have it very potent and uh I trust that
[1:21:08] it will be it was just a few slides a
[1:21:10] few pictures I believe that uh you have
[1:21:14] them prepared here before we go any
[1:21:16] further let's bow in
[1:21:19] prayer lovely lovely Heavenly
[1:21:24] Father uh we are so a privilege that we
[1:21:27] can approach you through the name of our
[1:21:30] beloved Savior Jesus Christ Lord our
[1:21:34] lips and our hearts feel unworthy to
[1:21:38] even speak his name he is so dear so
[1:21:42] precious has done so much and now for
[1:21:45] this body of people that are here I pray
[1:21:48] that you will bless them immensely oh
[1:21:51] God uh during the rest of the services
[1:21:54] today tomorrow and in Jesus name we give
[1:21:58] ourselves to you completely amen and
[1:22:02] amen amen amen you may be
[1:22:10] seated I I would like to just simply
[1:22:14] say when the when
[1:22:17] God prepared a
[1:22:20] sacrifice in the form of Jesus
[1:22:23] Christ and the scripture says Jesus uh
[1:22:28] quoted he he spoke the words and he
[1:22:31] quoted the scripture actually it is from
[1:22:33] the Old Testament as well and and he
[1:22:36] said in Hebrews
[1:22:38] wherefor when he cometh into the world
[1:22:41] he saith sacrifice and offering thou
[1:22:45] wouldst not but a body hast thou
[1:22:48] prepared me and I read that scripture I
[1:22:52] believe the first uh
[1:22:54] Service uh but something that I would
[1:22:57] like to convey to you is that the
[1:23:01] preparation of a body there is the body
[1:23:04] of Jesus Christ that was for sacrifice
[1:23:08] and then the body of Jesus Christ which
[1:23:10] is the Bride of Jesus Christ the prophet
[1:23:13] said the life for that body came from
[1:23:16] the side of the Lord Jesus Christ where
[1:23:19] bone of his bone Spirit of his Spirit
[1:23:24] life of his life and I think that we
[1:23:27] would want to rejoice when we see that
[1:23:30] the the heartbeat of this bride is to
[1:23:34] get the last one in the the ultimate is
[1:23:38] actually the ultimate is is in even the
[1:23:41] meaning of a body hast thou prepared me
[1:23:44] and this is this is it just before I inv
[1:23:47] invite uh brother Tim Dodd to show the
[1:23:51] slides that he has prepared prepared and
[1:23:54] to to prepare the body is number one is
[1:23:58] about five items number one to perfect
[1:24:04] and make complete that's his intention
[1:24:08] for you number two formed into what it
[1:24:14] ought to be and the prophet uses that
[1:24:17] phrase what we ought to be that is a
[1:24:21] body hast thou prepared me to what it
[1:24:24] ought to be number three is that having
[1:24:29] special aptitude talents or
[1:24:33] qualities and number four is for a
[1:24:36] certain season of time and the word that
[1:24:39] follows that is now in other words you
[1:24:43] have been prepared for this moment you
[1:24:48] have been given special aptitude special
[1:24:51] talents special characteristics for this
[1:24:55] moment this is not what the disciples uh
[1:24:59] this is not what the disciples had or
[1:25:02] those that were in the Reformation or
[1:25:04] those that were in other ages but God
[1:25:07] prepares this is part of the preparation
[1:25:10] and if you are part of that body then
[1:25:12] you will fully expect to be formed into
[1:25:17] the uh into the type of body that he
[1:25:21] wants us this very moment and the last
[1:25:24] is probably the most wonderful the
[1:25:27] intent of the body all of the
[1:25:30] preparation is that it would be raised
[1:25:33] up and what would be raised up shall be
[1:25:36] taken away and that's what the word
[1:25:40] prepared means isn't that wonderful
[1:25:43] isn't that wonderful the intention of
[1:25:45] God is Not only that we uh have a good
[1:25:49] time is not only that we hear are
[1:25:52] instructed that's not all the intention
[1:25:55] is that this body shall be lifted and
[1:25:58] elevated into Heavenly places that this
[1:26:01] body will be not only raised but taken
[1:26:05] away and that's what it means to say a
[1:26:09] body hast thou prepared me and I trust
[1:26:13] you can say that
[1:26:17] hallelujah
[1:26:20] amen we have two things
[1:26:22] what has happened just while we're
[1:26:24] seated here is taking place in
[1:26:27] Ethiopia and
[1:26:29] secondly what has taking place in China
[1:26:33] brother Tim would you come
[1:26:37] [Applause]
[1:26:51] please
[1:26:56] amen it's good to be gathered together
[1:26:59] with you
[1:26:59] tonight and uh I don't as brother Ed
[1:27:03] said we're going to make this extremely
[1:27:05] brief so don't blink don't fall
[1:27:10] asleep we're going to just make this
[1:27:13] really fast because we want to give
[1:27:15] maximum time to the word amen and uh uh
[1:27:20] as brother Ed said I work with them in
[1:27:23] missions and uh I won't go into the
[1:27:25] details of it other than to say there
[1:27:27] are some outstanding things that are
[1:27:29] happening around the world and I'm just
[1:27:31] going to go right to these slides
[1:27:35] here and talk about just for a moment a
[1:27:38] second book of Acts that is not future
[1:27:40] tense that is present tense that's what
[1:27:43] is happening right now uh brother Bram
[1:27:48] talks about it in the token message and
[1:27:50] he says now he says ' when he said you
[1:27:53] must be born again that don't mean jump
[1:27:55] up and down at the altar that don't mean
[1:27:58] walk back there and shake hands with the
[1:28:00] pastor that don't mean all this
[1:28:02] foolishness that we've seen done it
[1:28:04] don't mean putting your name on the
[1:28:06] church book it means Death to Your First
[1:28:09] being and life to the second being can
[1:28:13] we say Amen to
[1:28:15] that it means that the blood has been
[1:28:17] applied and you're identified by the
[1:28:19] life of Jesus Christ and and if he be
[1:28:22] the vine and we are the branches now let
[1:28:25] me just stop here for a second when
[1:28:27] Jesus in John 15 says I'm the vine
[1:28:30] you're the branches he's speaking to
[1:28:32] those that are the first first book of
[1:28:34] Acts is that right but now there's to be
[1:28:38] a second book of Acts and so he says he
[1:28:41] says uh if he be the vine and we be the
[1:28:44] branches the life that's in the branch
[1:28:46] is also from the vine it'll bear the
[1:28:49] fruit he says if the first first Branch
[1:28:52] come forth that Branch out of the vine
[1:28:55] that wrote a book of Acts behind it if
[1:28:58] that vine puts forth another Branch
[1:29:01] they'll
[1:29:02] write another book of Acts behind it
[1:29:07] because it's the same
[1:29:09] life amen it's not you it's the life
[1:29:13] that's in you that writes the book of
[1:29:15] Acts and what is the book of Acts we
[1:29:17] know the book of Acts has Doctrine it's
[1:29:19] where we get water baptism from but it's
[1:29:22] not Doctrine alone it's the record of
[1:29:23] the acts of the holy spirit in the
[1:29:26] church and the and the book of Acts is
[1:29:30] not just acts chapter 2 where they were
[1:29:33] filled with the Holy Ghost but the Holy
[1:29:35] Ghost put them into
[1:29:39] action the Holy Ghost put them into
[1:29:42] action that what that's what the Holy
[1:29:44] Ghost is about I don't want to get
[1:29:46] preaching here I have to carry on I want
[1:29:49] to just give you a little testimony here
[1:29:50] as we press on because uh bi at bible
[1:29:53] Believers uh you know what is Bible
[1:29:55] Believers Bible Believers is not just
[1:29:58] Cloverdale Bible way it's not just
[1:30:00] brother Ed bcll but it's it's
[1:30:02] like-minded people all around the world
[1:30:06] that support missions needs under the
[1:30:09] guidance of brother bis's Ministry and
[1:30:12] uh we're large we are known in a great
[1:30:15] way for printing books but our object is
[1:30:17] to get the message into the hands of the
[1:30:19] local people that's our our objective is
[1:30:23] to get God's love letter to his bride
[1:30:27] God loves his
[1:30:30] bride we are we bride here God loves his
[1:30:34] [Applause]
[1:30:36] bride and if God loves his love letter
[1:30:39] to his bride then those who carry his
[1:30:41] love letter God will bless amen because
[1:30:45] God's objective is not to um I'm sorry
[1:30:48] I'm getting to preach so uh we get
[1:30:52] uh I want to just give this short little
[1:30:54] testimony because something happened to
[1:30:56] me two years ago uh and that was a real
[1:30:59] surprise to me and I I just thought I'd
[1:31:00] start with this before I go to Ethiopia
[1:31:03] in that uh uh I was in India and a young
[1:31:07] man stepped into the room where before I
[1:31:09] was about to preach and he says do you
[1:31:11] remember me and I looked at him and he
[1:31:13] was about 22 years old and I I said I
[1:31:16] looked at him and as I'm looking at him
[1:31:18] my mind goes back to an instance about
[1:31:21] 10 years earlier when I was in India and
[1:31:24] this young man here came up to me with a
[1:31:27] lot of questions and he he was at the
[1:31:29] end of a service and and he had
[1:31:31] different questions and finally he said
[1:31:33] I want you to prove to me that what you
[1:31:36] preach is the truth because right now
[1:31:38] I'm studying with the Catholic church
[1:31:40] but I'm from a seik family and uh I've
[1:31:43] learned all different religions what
[1:31:45] makes what you're saying the truth and I
[1:31:48] want you to prove it to me and so I
[1:31:50] thought how can I prove it to this man
[1:31:52] saw this young man I think he was about
[1:31:54] 12 years old and I told him I can't
[1:31:57] prove it to
[1:31:59] you I said only God can prove it to
[1:32:04] you I said but what I want you to do I
[1:32:07] says I want you to ask this pastor and I
[1:32:10] was at brother sardar's Church stand up
[1:32:12] brother
[1:32:13] Sardar and I was at this man's church
[1:32:20] and
[1:32:22] and I said you uh you ask this man for
[1:32:26] some books he'll give you some books and
[1:32:28] then you read those books and you ask
[1:32:30] God personally to make it real to you
[1:32:34] and he will vindicate it to you
[1:32:36] personally and so now I'm standing with
[1:32:39] that young man in the room and I'm
[1:32:41] saying are you that young man and he
[1:32:43] says I'm that young man and God had
[1:32:46] miraculously converted him and made her
[1:32:49] made him a preacher of this message that
[1:32:51] has has won many souls to the Lord Jesus
[1:32:57] Christ we have a message with life in it
[1:33:02] and it produces results and that young
[1:33:04] man is standing right there at the back
[1:33:06] he's one of the translators wave your
[1:33:07] hand brother
[1:33:17] malit he went from this to that praise
[1:33:19] the
[1:33:20] Lord
[1:33:24] in the book what is the book of Acts in
[1:33:27] Acts chapter 8 it says the angel of the
[1:33:30] Lord spake unto Philip saying arise and
[1:33:32] go towards the South unto the way that
[1:33:33] goeth from Jerusalem to Gaza which is
[1:33:36] the desert and he arose one man and
[1:33:39] behold a man of Ethiopia a unic of great
[1:33:42] Authority Under Candice Queen of the
[1:33:44] Ethiopians who had charge of all its
[1:33:46] treasure and had come to Jerusalem for
[1:33:49] to worship and I won't read the rest of
[1:33:51] the script scripture but you know the
[1:33:52] story the Ethiopian unic after Philip
[1:33:55] had been called away from a
[1:33:57] Revival Philip had been called away from
[1:34:00] a big Gathering but now to go
[1:34:02] individually to a country to speak to an
[1:34:05] individual that was traveling through
[1:34:08] that was going to a country called
[1:34:09] Ethiopia that's the book of Acts often
[1:34:12] just two
[1:34:14] men standing alone in a field perhaps
[1:34:17] and that's how the work began in
[1:34:20] Ethiopia
[1:34:22] Now by way of background Ethiopia has
[1:34:24] never been colonized so they don't speak
[1:34:26] English they don't speak German they
[1:34:28] don't speak French they don't speak
[1:34:29] Spanish they don't speak any of the
[1:34:31] European languages they speak their own
[1:34:33] languages and the message has never made
[1:34:36] an impact upon that country though over
[1:34:38] the years some have tried to take the
[1:34:40] message into Ethiopia but there had been
[1:34:42] no real results and it's uh uh and it
[1:34:46] had always been something that was upon
[1:34:48] my heart in a general sense of the term
[1:34:50] for some reason I'd never been to
[1:34:52] Ethiopia but for some reason always
[1:34:53] thought about Ethiopia and then all of a
[1:34:56] sudden what after ID moved uh down to
[1:34:58] Cloverdale and begin to work in missions
[1:35:01] in one week three brothers from un
[1:35:04] unconnected to each other from three
[1:35:06] different areas one by phone one by
[1:35:09] email and another walked into my office
[1:35:12] in the same week and said brother Tim
[1:35:15] what are we doing for
[1:35:17] Ethiopia and so I knew God was saying we
[1:35:20] need to do something for Ethiopia and I
[1:35:22] went into brother bis's office and I
[1:35:24] talked to brother bisc about it and I
[1:35:26] said this is what happened and he agreed
[1:35:28] with me that this seemed to be the
[1:35:30] Lord's timing but how to do it was the
[1:35:33] question at this time we had been in
[1:35:36] contact with a young brother from Uganda
[1:35:38] whom you heard about already from
[1:35:40] brother biso and he's a a a very fiery
[1:35:43] young evangelist and very energetic and
[1:35:46] full of life and full of the Holy Spirit
[1:35:49] and uh just as a desire to to do things
[1:35:51] for God and he had contacted me to do
[1:35:55] his wedding and he was getting married
[1:35:57] in January of 2013 and I told him no I
[1:36:00] won't come and do your come to Uganda
[1:36:02] just to do your wedding but I said to
[1:36:05] him our young people from our our school
[1:36:08] are going to Uganda in March so two
[1:36:11] months later I said if you'll postpone
[1:36:13] your wedding for two months I'll come
[1:36:15] with the young people and we'll do your
[1:36:17] wedding while we're doing other Ministry
[1:36:21] and I thought no problem he'll never
[1:36:23] postpone his wedding if I was a young
[1:36:26] man I wouldn't postpone my
[1:36:28] wedding somebody say
[1:36:31] Amen but he phoned me back or he texted
[1:36:34] me back the next week and said brother
[1:36:35] Tim even though it will cost the best
[1:36:38] man being unable to make it I feel God's
[1:36:42] asking me to change my wedding so you
[1:36:44] can do it and so so that had happened
[1:36:48] there and then uh and then I had heard
[1:36:51] from these three brothers and we begin
[1:36:53] to think about Ethiopia and I'm
[1:36:55] wondering how are we going to find out
[1:36:58] what God wants to do in Ethiopia and a
[1:37:00] thought comes to my mind and I contacted
[1:37:03] this young brother and I said to him I
[1:37:05] says what are you doing for a
[1:37:08] honeymoon and of course and many of you
[1:37:10] African Brothers as many of you African
[1:37:12] Brothers know most Africans don't take a
[1:37:14] honeymoon because they can't afford it
[1:37:16] they get married they go home life
[1:37:18] continues on and so he said we don't
[1:37:21] have a honeymoon planned I said well how
[1:37:23] about if I buy you and your wife two
[1:37:25] tickets to Ethiopia and you can go to
[1:37:28] Ethiopia for two weeks on your honeymoon
[1:37:30] knowing in my mind this man had an
[1:37:33] Evangelistic gift and if God's going to
[1:37:35] use him he just may well open the door
[1:37:37] in Ethiopia now I have to jump forward
[1:37:40] they get married they go to Ethiopia
[1:37:42] they're on their honeymoon they pass by
[1:37:44] the the country of Kenya in Kenya he
[1:37:48] meets this man darissa is his name he's
[1:37:51] an Ethiopian he's not just an Ethiopian
[1:37:54] he's the United ntion one of the United
[1:37:57] Nations translators for the Ethiopian
[1:38:00] language into English and God
[1:38:03] sovereignly directs their paths he
[1:38:06] introduces the message to this man he
[1:38:09] receives Christ is baptized in the name
[1:38:11] of the Lord Jesus Christ and immediately
[1:38:13] begins to Embark upon
[1:38:18] translation not only that he had a
[1:38:21] brother in the country of Ethiopia this
[1:38:23] man is a refugee from Ethiopia that's
[1:38:25] living in Kenya he has a brother in
[1:38:27] Ethiopia and he gives brother bsabi his
[1:38:30] contact excuse me I'll call him brother
[1:38:32] bus which is what we call him for short
[1:38:35] he gives brother bus his contact in
[1:38:37] Ethiopia a for his brother so he goes to
[1:38:40] Ethiopia he meets his brother who speaks
[1:38:43] a little bit of English and as he he
[1:38:46] introduces the message to him that man
[1:38:49] also receives the message and his is
[1:38:51] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:38:57] Christ now remember they're on their
[1:39:00] honeymoon they're on their honeymoon you
[1:39:03] European people think about this now all
[1:39:06] of you that are married anyway and uh
[1:39:09] you know they they God is really opening
[1:39:12] doors at this time and and actually is
[1:39:14] continued to do so but as this man is
[1:39:18] baptized and recognizes God just just
[1:39:21] pours out the the revelation of his word
[1:39:24] upon him and he remembers a sister in
[1:39:26] the Pentecostal church that he knows not
[1:39:29] a natural sister but a spiritual sister
[1:39:32] who's hungry for God so he calls her and
[1:39:34] he says you need to meet these people so
[1:39:37] she comes uh this brother's name here is
[1:39:41] uh kumasa which by the way uh there he
[1:39:45] is now sitting on the front row of the
[1:39:46] church there playing his instrument and
[1:39:49] uh he uh calls this other sister sister
[1:39:53] yodit we would say Judith in English but
[1:39:55] her name is sister yodit in Ethiopian
[1:39:58] and says you need to meet these people
[1:40:00] so she comes over to where they're
[1:40:02] staying on their honeymoon and brother
[1:40:05] bus introduces the message to her the
[1:40:07] Holy Spirit quickens it to her she says
[1:40:10] I must be
[1:40:11] baptized while while brother bus is
[1:40:14] witnessing to her his wife excuses
[1:40:16] herself and goes into the washroom and
[1:40:19] and she he is wondering why is she
[1:40:21] taking so long in the bathroom and he
[1:40:24] come to find out later she's in the
[1:40:25] bathroom praying while her husband is
[1:40:28] witnessing to this
[1:40:30] woman I'll tell you what these people
[1:40:32] are real
[1:40:33] Believers and so the this the word
[1:40:35] quickens this woman she says I need to
[1:40:37] be baptized it's about 9:00 at night
[1:40:40] brother bus says I don't know where to
[1:40:41] baptize you she says I'll find a place
[1:40:43] I'll be back he says all right but don't
[1:40:45] come back till
[1:40:48] tomorrow he says just give me a night's
[1:40:50] rest and and so she come back the next
[1:40:52] morning she was there at 9:00 in the
[1:40:54] morning saying I found a place come and
[1:40:56] baptize me and she was baptized in the
[1:40:59] name of the Lord Jesus
[1:41:04] Christ This Woman become instrumental in
[1:41:08] the fact that she speaks very good
[1:41:10] English and and she speaks the local
[1:41:12] language very well and God begin to use
[1:41:15] her in the initial stages of the work
[1:41:17] there like Lydia in Philippi how that
[1:41:21] she became uh useful as a translator and
[1:41:24] interpreter for them into the local
[1:41:27] language so as they would meet people
[1:41:29] and travel and even she opened doors for
[1:41:31] them to go into churches and to preach
[1:41:34] the gospel uh and and she had to be The
[1:41:37] Interpreter because that's all they had
[1:41:38] is The Interpreter just like brother
[1:41:40] brandham in the beginning of his
[1:41:41] ministry that would use a sister as an
[1:41:44] interpreter when there was no other
[1:41:45] resources so she was she was used of God
[1:41:49] to spread the gospel
[1:41:52] amen God taking a hold of her life and
[1:41:55] and moving in a supernatural way let me
[1:41:58] just carry on here I'm going to take up
[1:41:59] too much
[1:42:04] time this is Sister yodit now and
[1:42:06] brother bus is on the right and they
[1:42:09] travel to another town with brother Paul
[1:42:12] and they meet they meet a man on the
[1:42:14] street and they they say to him do you
[1:42:15] know where we can get some food and he
[1:42:17] he tells them where they can get some
[1:42:19] food and uh uh and he they say to him
[1:42:23] well give us your contact information
[1:42:25] and he says well why do you want my
[1:42:26] contact information because we're
[1:42:28] missionaries and we've come here to
[1:42:30] share the Gospel of Jesus Christ and so
[1:42:33] so they connect with this man and it
[1:42:35] turns out that he is a man that has just
[1:42:37] finished his law degree in University
[1:42:40] and has majored in English and so now he
[1:42:44] uh they introduced to him the gospel and
[1:42:47] God strikes him that these people have
[1:42:49] come from a long way always a way to
[1:42:51] tell him the truth and he Embraces the
[1:42:55] end time message and is baptized almost
[1:42:57] immediately in the name of the Lord
[1:42:59] Jesus
[1:43:05] Christ and this is brother mogus or we
[1:43:08] would say Moses but brother mogus there
[1:43:10] in Ethiopia is now the main translator
[1:43:13] in the most popular language in that
[1:43:15] country in all we're actually
[1:43:17] translating already into three languages
[1:43:19] in Ethiopia and we have in total almost
[1:43:23] 20 translations already because these
[1:43:27] people need the word in their
[1:43:32] language here they are now in the new
[1:43:35] church that has just been established
[1:43:36] there in the basement of a building and
[1:43:38] this is actually brother mogus you see
[1:43:40] standing on the left he's interpreting
[1:43:43] uh sister Yodi you can see on the far
[1:43:45] left in the front row brother uh kumasa
[1:43:48] there and several other believers some
[1:43:50] of whom one of whom was baptized even
[1:43:52] while I was there in March of this year
[1:43:54] God is moving there in a supernatural
[1:43:55] way I don't have time to share all the
[1:43:58] stories but I'll just tell you so far
[1:44:00] there's been over 35 people
[1:44:02] baptized I I there's developments
[1:44:10] amen there's developments almost daily
[1:44:13] in that Country open doors people
[1:44:16] wanting to hear the word people being
[1:44:18] receptive to the word in a country where
[1:44:20] the message has never taken a hold God
[1:44:24] is going to find his last predestinated
[1:44:27] seed and when the last one comes in
[1:44:30] we're going
[1:44:31] home amen you heard brother Tim puit say
[1:44:34] it the other day it's it's not totally
[1:44:37] unselfish that we do Mission
[1:44:39] work it's actually selfish we want to go
[1:44:42] home but we're not going home until the
[1:44:44] last one comes in let me put it another
[1:44:47] way you're not going home until the last
[1:44:50] predestinated seed has come
[1:44:54] in the brothers were were doing the
[1:44:58] brothers were doing a
[1:45:00] U uh one of their missionary trips in
[1:45:02] brother buosi now lives in the country
[1:45:05] with his family lovely family and uh
[1:45:08] they've had two children since they've
[1:45:09] been married and uh the uh he and
[1:45:12] another brother were traveling there on
[1:45:14] one trip they were going down the street
[1:45:16] and uh uh one of the street workers um
[1:45:20] begin to call out to them one of the
[1:45:22] women of the street begin to call out to
[1:45:24] them thinking they were businessmen or
[1:45:26] something that she might get some
[1:45:28] business and like Peter and John at the
[1:45:30] gate called Beautiful it was Silver and
[1:45:33] Gold Have I None but what we have we're
[1:45:35] going to give you and they turn to her
[1:45:38] and begin to introduce Jesus Christ to
[1:45:41] this poor street prostitute who it turns
[1:45:44] out was an orphan and had to do what she
[1:45:47] did because she there was no other way
[1:45:49] to put food in her mouth mouth and
[1:45:51] prostitution is legal in Ethiopia but
[1:45:55] God opened this woman's eyes and she
[1:45:57] became miraculously delivered and became
[1:46:02] a Believer baptized in the name of the
[1:46:04] Lord Jesus
[1:46:11] Christ again I can't go into all the I'm
[1:46:14] just going to stop that there one of the
[1:46:15] great tools that we have is something
[1:46:17] that I want to introduce to you uh many
[1:46:19] of you have heard of it I've shown
[1:46:21] number of people around but it's I'm
[1:46:22] always amazed how many people don't know
[1:46:24] about this and that is a Bible app that
[1:46:27] we've developed not for English though
[1:46:30] English is in it but the purpose is to
[1:46:33] put connect the message to the Bible so
[1:46:37] that brother briham becomes the
[1:46:39] commentary to the Bible and to put it in
[1:46:42] as many languages as possible so that
[1:46:45] all of these countries have the message
[1:46:48] in their language I was just talking to
[1:46:52] uh the angolan brothers that were here
[1:46:56] and they have a huge need for message
[1:46:58] books they they estimate that there's
[1:47:01] about a million Believers in their
[1:47:05] country
[1:47:07] hello a million
[1:47:10] Believers how are you going to print
[1:47:12] message books for a million
[1:47:14] Believers if you print a 100 titles
[1:47:17] that's a 100 million
[1:47:19] books
[1:47:21] hello that's amazing an amazing project
[1:47:25] but we have a an Avenue by which we can
[1:47:28] put the message in their hands right on
[1:47:30] the smartphone and that's a Bible app
[1:47:32] that we call message Hub
[1:47:35] mobile it's downloadable for free on the
[1:47:38] Google App Store it's only for Android
[1:47:40] systems and that's this little app right
[1:47:46] here and very it's a very simple app
[1:47:48] that connects the Bible to the message
[1:47:50] message
[1:47:51] and as it loads
[1:47:55] here I feel like I'm doing an apple or
[1:47:59] something presentation where
[1:48:00] everything's locking up on
[1:48:03] me I've never ah there we go okay
[1:48:06] doesn't usually take that long but uh
[1:48:09] there it is now very simply all you do
[1:48:12] is is Select whatever language you want
[1:48:15] here's all the languages we have 17
[1:48:16] different languages on the app right now
[1:48:19] many European languages such as Dutch
[1:48:21] German French uh Spanish um Slovenian
[1:48:25] Slovakian Croatian Polish Russian all uh
[1:48:29] and many other languages from around the
[1:48:31] world we'll select the uh German Bible
[1:48:33] since we're in Germany and pull that up
[1:48:35] here and you see on the side here
[1:48:38] numbers that
[1:48:40] are in Blue on the right hand side and
[1:48:43] those are links to the message from the
[1:48:48] scripture and you see in each number
[1:48:51] it's a it's a certain number 1 1 5 6
[1:48:55] those are how many links to the message
[1:48:58] or how many times in the translated
[1:49:00] messages that brother brandham uses this
[1:49:03] scripture in the English it would be
[1:49:04] more because we have all the messages
[1:49:06] but in the German we only have about a
[1:49:08] 100 or so messages that are translated
[1:49:11] into German that are on the app now if I
[1:49:14] click on this number six here it pulls
[1:49:17] up the six spots where brother Brandon
[1:49:19] mentioned that
[1:49:21] scripture and then if I click any one of
[1:49:23] these quotes it goes right into the
[1:49:26] message and so it's just as simple as
[1:49:29] that and it makes brother brandham the
[1:49:31] commentary to the
[1:49:41] scripture and also in every language it
[1:49:44] brother Murphy you can come forward now
[1:49:46] also in every language uh it's
[1:49:48] searchable in that language so
[1:49:50] automatically these languages who have
[1:49:52] never been able to search the message in
[1:49:55] their language can now search the
[1:49:57] message in their own language and so
[1:50:00] we've had it in English for years some
[1:50:02] of you have had apps in your language
[1:50:04] but now the Indonesians have it in their
[1:50:06] language the Filipinos have it in their
[1:50:08] language some of these nations that have
[1:50:10] never had access to it like this before
[1:50:13] it's glorious what they have and they're
[1:50:14] excited about it and we're excited and
[1:50:17] it puts all the translations right into
[1:50:20] our hands and we and I mention that
[1:50:21] because I say the the brothers from
[1:50:23] Angola you pray for them and and uh
[1:50:27] because they want to load all the
[1:50:29] angolan translations so they can have an
[1:50:32] app and doesn't matter how many millions
[1:50:34] of people they can download all the
[1:50:37] translations instantly to their
[1:50:39] smartphone or their tablet and they have
[1:50:42] them there no printing
[1:50:44] required praise be to
[1:50:49] God
[1:50:53] brother Murphy's on his way here he is
[1:50:56] right
[1:50:58] here brother Murphy's going to speak
[1:51:00] about China
[1:51:04] and and he's going to show us uh a
[1:51:07] little bit about the Chinese Bible and
[1:51:09] how that came about and uh I don't I
[1:51:12] want to say while he's
[1:51:14] coming you know Bible Believers began by
[1:51:17] connecting needs with believers that had
[1:51:20] a burden for Missions and we are very
[1:51:23] very very strong on on being
[1:51:27] accountable we do reports we have some
[1:51:30] Faith challenge reports in the back and
[1:51:33] uh there's probably a few left and if
[1:51:35] you're interested in reading the reports
[1:51:38] of some of these things there's many
[1:51:40] other things that are happening but
[1:51:42] including Ethiopia and China but if you
[1:51:44] want to read some of the reports you get
[1:51:46] one of the faith challenge reports and
[1:51:48] if you want to be a regular
[1:51:50] uh uh partaker and be involved in what
[1:51:54] God's doing on the mission field give us
[1:51:56] your name and address just write it down
[1:51:59] on a piece of paper and give it to
[1:52:01] myself or brother Murphy or brother MIL
[1:52:04] stand up brother mil if you would
[1:52:06] there's brother
[1:52:09] milal give it to one of the three of us
[1:52:12] and we'll make sure that you get a faith
[1:52:13] challenge report Amen brother
[1:52:18] Murphy
[1:52:20] [Applause]
[1:52:27] oh just to try to be as pry as I can I
[1:52:29] had a lot of testimony but I won't share
[1:52:31] to any of them because otherwise going
[1:52:33] to be take too much time actually I had
[1:52:35] about30 slides for all the testimony of
[1:52:38] the Believers what happening in there
[1:52:40] but I only I taken about 10 slide here
[1:52:42] the only thing I shared is about the
[1:52:44] Bible uh to the back there uh the reason
[1:52:47] that we translated the Bible uh because
[1:52:50] that's about a 100 years ago and so they
[1:52:53] had a uh the missionary going to China
[1:52:56] and that husand Taylor or whatever and
[1:52:59] uh then they feel the need of the Bible
[1:53:01] so they translated and uh but uh while
[1:53:05] they translated they become a different
[1:53:07] version of it and the only one version
[1:53:09] last that's called a union version
[1:53:11] that's the 99% of the Christian in China
[1:53:14] and overseas that they were raiding but
[1:53:16] because the based on the uh the wrong uh
[1:53:19] I won't say wrong but it's different um
[1:53:22] manuscript so there's a lot of uh uh
[1:53:25] mistakes and the missing verses there
[1:53:27] and the first thing when we find out
[1:53:29] that uh is about uh
[1:53:32] 1998 uh when we translated brother
[1:53:34] bram's message we find out that the uh
[1:53:37] vers is missing the first one we find
[1:53:40] out is the first John chter 5 and verse
[1:53:42] 7 and uh he said uh there are three be
[1:53:45] record in heaven uh there are father uh
[1:53:48] the Holy Ghost and the word this three
[1:53:51] are one if you go back to your French
[1:53:54] Bible uh Louis Vuitton or Louie Su and
[1:53:58] uh they don't have that verse either and
[1:54:01] I think the many other verses was
[1:54:02] missing as well and when we find it out
[1:54:05] uh because the the task was so great uh
[1:54:08] we uh just uh we dare not even to touch
[1:54:11] it but we start to accumulate to all the
[1:54:15] uh the missing verses we make it a d uh
[1:54:17] diary off it and the mark it down just
[1:54:21] verse after verse and and it until they
[1:54:23] come to a time just become so many
[1:54:26] hundreds if not by thousands and then we
[1:54:29] uh pray the Lord uh uh give us the
[1:54:32] determination you know there's a two way
[1:54:34] to do this one way you just Overlook it
[1:54:37] just said okay I I know English I just
[1:54:39] go ahead that read my English Bible and
[1:54:41] uh uh you know just go along but another
[1:54:44] way is if I have the Bible if I know
[1:54:47] that English if I know the message I
[1:54:49] want to to give everyone that they uh
[1:54:51] doesn't have the privilege to know and
[1:54:54] that's why we determined to retranslate
[1:54:55] this Bible so by God's grace and uh
[1:54:58] after five years of uh hard works that a
[1:55:01] group of Believers will work together
[1:55:04] and we got that the Bible was translated
[1:55:06] and the published I'll just give you a
[1:55:07] few
[1:55:08] example if you can go to the first uh
[1:55:13] slide
[1:55:17] uh is that the scripture
[1:55:20] okay and then Matthew 5:44 it said but I
[1:55:23] say it unto you love your enemies bless
[1:55:26] them that curse you do good to them that
[1:55:28] hate you this verse is
[1:55:31] missing and I pray for them that which
[1:55:33] despise to use you that verse is
[1:55:36] missing and the next one 1811 for the
[1:55:40] son of a man is coming to save that
[1:55:41] which was lost the verses doesn't
[1:55:45] exist and Matthew 2016 so the last shall
[1:55:49] be first and the first last for many be
[1:55:51] called but few
[1:55:54] chosen that was

[2:05:26] of
[2:05:27] scriptures the other day uh as I
[2:05:31] spoke I have to confess to you that I
[2:05:35] read the scripture and the Holy Spirit
[2:05:37] just took it in a completely different
[2:05:40] direction and had me give uh uh two
[2:05:45] testimonies of things that had taken
[2:05:47] place uh when I was with brother Brenham
[2:05:50] and uh I had already con I had already
[2:05:53] promised myself in my heart I won't tell
[2:05:56] those because the atmosphere won't be
[2:05:58] right but the atmosphere became
[2:06:01] perfect and uh God was very gracious to
[2:06:04] us so I I want to just read the
[2:06:06] scripture if you would uh turn to it
[2:06:10] with
[2:06:12] me I have several notes here because I
[2:06:15] just didn't have the time to to get
[2:06:20] everything sorted out but I am going to
[2:06:23] with the Lord's help uh do what brother
[2:06:26] Coen Brunner has asked me to do and to
[2:06:28] be a live
[2:06:29] witness uh but I do want to go to these
[2:06:32] scriptures I'm going to read out of
[2:06:33] Exodus the 3rd chapter and verses just
[2:06:37] two down to
[2:06:39] five and the angel of the Lord appeared
[2:06:42] unto him this was to Moses in a flame of
[2:06:45] fire and in the midst and and out of of
[2:06:48] the midst of the Bush and he looked and
[2:06:51] behold the bush burned with fire and the
[2:06:54] Bush was not consumed and Moses said I
[2:06:57] will now turn aside and see this great
[2:07:00] sight why the bush is not burnt and when
[2:07:04] the Lord saw that he turned aside to see
[2:07:09] God called unto him out of the midst of
[2:07:12] the Bush and said Moses Moses and he
[2:07:15] said here am I and he said
[2:07:19] draw not
[2:07:20] nigh hither put off thy shoes from thy
[2:07:24] feet for the place where on thou
[2:07:27] standest is Holy Ground and then uh the
[2:07:31] scripture tells us that Moses at a later
[2:07:34] time asked God a question and he wanted
[2:07:38] to see his face said you cannot see my
[2:07:41] face but and he said this uh behold I
[2:07:46] send uh an angel before thee to keep
[2:07:50] thee in the way and bring thee into the
[2:07:53] place which I have prepared and the Lord
[2:07:57] said unto him this is Exodus
[2:08:00] 33:21 and behold there is a place by me
[2:08:05] and thou shalt stand upon a rock you may
[2:08:09] be
[2:08:15] seated my precious friends I will speak
[2:08:19] to you out of the depth of sincerity of
[2:08:20] my
[2:08:21] heart as he said to Moses there is a
[2:08:25] place by me and I want to speak about a
[2:08:29] place for a few moments
[2:08:32] tonight it's a very very striking word a
[2:08:36] a place can be a
[2:08:38] locality a place can be your country a
[2:08:42] place can be this building a place can
[2:08:46] be a condition
[2:08:48] someone may be very sick and I'm going
[2:08:51] to give you one or two examples when
[2:08:53] they came before the prophet of God and
[2:08:57] then and listen very close they came
[2:09:01] because they were very sick that was
[2:09:03] their condition that was the place they
[2:09:05] were in and they anticipated that they
[2:09:09] would be healed and pray and and prayed
[2:09:12] for but when the angel of the Lord began
[2:09:16] to speak to them and he spoke to Moses
[2:09:19] out of the burning bush and the prophet
[2:09:22] did declare that what Moses lacked the
[2:09:26] burning bush in the pillar of fire had
[2:09:29] and I want to say to you this evening
[2:09:31] some of you have come from different
[2:09:33] countries whether it be indria India or
[2:09:36] whether it be the Philippines or whether
[2:09:38] it be Angola or whether it be the Congo
[2:09:41] or whether it be from America or whether
[2:09:43] it be from Canada we may not even
[2:09:46] realize the depth of our need we may not
[2:09:49] even realize our real need we may have
[2:09:52] come here and said I anticipate to hear
[2:09:55] certain things the different Brothers I
[2:09:57] certain I have a certain expectation but
[2:10:01] God may have a little slightly different
[2:10:04] expectation for you and you may feel
[2:10:06] that your need is a certain thing and
[2:10:08] I'm going to give you exact examples
[2:10:11] while men I stood in front of the
[2:10:14] prophet of God and came there with a
[2:10:16] specific need they were people that were
[2:10:19] in a certain place and it was a
[2:10:21] desperate place and they wanted to be
[2:10:24] freed they wanted to be delivered but
[2:10:26] God had a different idea because they
[2:10:28] had a greater need and he knew what that
[2:10:31] need was and he declared that need
[2:10:34] through the prophet's mouth and dealt
[2:10:36] with that need first and I want to say
[2:10:39] can we not say Amen to that
[2:10:42] amen God knows exactly what we have need
[2:10:46] of and what what place we're in and he
[2:10:48] said to him when Moses said I wanted to
[2:10:51] see your face that I might see your face
[2:10:54] and
[2:10:55] God God answered him that no man could
[2:10:58] see his face but he said but there is a
[2:11:01] place by me and thou shalt stand upon a
[2:11:05] rock so God had to tell Moses that there
[2:11:09] was a place already prepared for him
[2:11:14] already prepared and I can say to you
[2:11:17] friends I don't know exactly why I know
[2:11:21] why I came here I came here at the
[2:11:23] invitation of brother Coen Bruner and
[2:11:26] and the rest of you have come it's
[2:11:28] impossible for me as a man to know why
[2:11:31] you have come and what your expectation
[2:11:33] is but I know one I know somebody I know
[2:11:37] one who can turn on the light I know a
[2:11:40] man that knows us and knows the inside
[2:11:43] and then knows the deepest deepest
[2:11:46] desire within you and that man can turn
[2:11:49] on the light that is none other than the
[2:11:52] son of man revealed and he is the one
[2:11:55] with the power and the insight to tell
[2:11:58] us exactly and point to our real need
[2:12:01] whatever that might be and also to
[2:12:04] provide that
[2:12:06] need
[2:12:08] [Applause]
[2:12:15] amen I had just mentioned to you
[2:12:19] and I'll just say this as a as a as a
[2:12:21] little starting
[2:12:23] Place Moses had stood
[2:12:26] in very special places he stood in h a a
[2:12:31] a place politically where he would be
[2:12:34] and the prophet said he was a great
[2:12:35] military man he knew what it was to hear
[2:12:39] the voices of the people roaring in
[2:12:42] adoration for his
[2:12:44] accomplishments but to God that was not
[2:12:47] the accomplish lishment and one day
[2:12:50] Moses also stood and looked out a window
[2:12:53] that was a place he looked out the same
[2:12:56] window that Pharaoh looked out but they
[2:12:58] had a different View and a different
[2:13:01] Vision Moses saw people that were the
[2:13:04] elected of God Moses saw people that
[2:13:08] were in slavery Moses saw people that
[2:13:12] were God's people and friends I'm
[2:13:14] standing here this evening and we see
[2:13:17] one another and I don't know how you
[2:13:19] view one another or how you view those
[2:13:21] who Minister but God views them M we
[2:13:25] want to make sure we have God's view of
[2:13:29] things we want to make sure we see one
[2:13:32] another as God sees them we can say We
[2:13:36] Are The Blood Washed uh we are the
[2:13:39] purchase of the blood of Jesus Christ
[2:13:42] and that is true but we need to be able
[2:13:44] to see and appreciate each other in that
[2:13:48] light and I can tell you as a servant of
[2:13:51] Christ that is the that is the level of
[2:13:54] divine love that needs to be within the
[2:13:57] Bride of Jesus Christ and we do not want
[2:13:59] to come to meetings such as this and go
[2:14:02] out from here the same way we shall be
[2:14:05] we shall experience a
[2:14:07] transformation where we actually
[2:14:09] literally feel different about one
[2:14:12] another and the prophet of God I'm going
[2:14:14] to go to beyond the curtain of time
[2:14:17] because I had a personal experience with
[2:14:19] the prophet and I'm going to be closing
[2:14:21] on that I'll be giving some some of the
[2:14:24] testimonies if if uh if the atmosphere
[2:14:26] is right and that's up to you hallu
[2:14:35] amen Moses was born in a home of slaves
[2:14:39] that was a
[2:14:40] place then a basket of bull rushers and
[2:14:44] that was a
[2:14:46] place was it not
[2:14:48] to the Palaces of Egypt and that was a
[2:14:51] place but that wasn't God's place for
[2:14:54] him to the backside of the desert and
[2:14:57] that was a place into a shepherd's tent
[2:15:01] and that was a place and leading the
[2:15:04] children of Israel and that was another
[2:15:06] place and up onto onto the mountain
[2:15:09] where God said you will not go into the
[2:15:12] land and he was he didn't and and even
[2:15:15] God told him don't speak to me anymore
[2:15:17] about this and he listened to the voice
[2:15:20] but he led the people to the land he led
[2:15:23] them to the land and Joshua his servant
[2:15:26] took them on in and gave them their
[2:15:29] inheritance because when God spoke to
[2:15:32] Abraham and said unto you and to your
[2:15:34] seed will I give this land that was a
[2:15:37] place and my brother my sister when God
[2:15:40] has a place in his mind he's got a place
[2:15:43] for the redeemed and Jesus said I go to
[2:15:47] prepare a place for
[2:15:50] you
[2:15:51] Hallelujah and I will come again and
[2:15:54] receive you unto myself and I'd like to
[2:15:57] declare to you my belief and and this is
[2:16:00] my last time speaking so I will just say
[2:16:02] it all I believe that the prophet's
[2:16:05] Ministry is part of that him receiving
[2:16:08] us to himself he's the word he's the
[2:16:13] word he's the revealed word and he
[2:16:15] raises up ministry for the expressed
[2:16:18] purpose he does translations for the
[2:16:20] expressed purpose of letting people know
[2:16:23] what this message is all about and that
[2:16:26] it is none other the mighty angel that
[2:16:29] that descended in Revelation 10:1 is
[2:16:33] none other and exactly what the prophet
[2:16:35] said that's Jesus
[2:16:37] Christ you believe that do we all
[2:16:41] believe that that's none other than
[2:16:43] Jesus Christ and I will take it further
[2:16:46] he's descend ending for one purpose to
[2:16:49] make himself known to his people and
[2:16:52] he's descending to receive a people to
[2:16:56] himself to take you to another place a
[2:17:01] body has the Lord prepared me Hallelujah
[2:17:05] this body of Jesus Christ it is not his
[2:17:08] intent that we just come and have
[2:17:10] meetings and have sing songs and that we
[2:17:14] have conventions it's much greater than
[2:17:16] that
[2:17:19] Hallelujah and the purpose of these
[2:17:21] conventions is to prepare ourselves for
[2:17:24] the place that he is prepared for us
[2:17:27] hallelujah it is prepared and he has
[2:17:30] sent his holy spirit we don't even have
[2:17:32] to beg him he the Holy Spirit has come
[2:17:36] and desires to dwell in us even more
[2:17:39] than you desire
[2:17:40] him hallelujah hallelujah because that
[2:17:44] is the spirit of God that's the spirit
[2:17:47] of Jes Jesus Christ to collect his bride
[2:17:50] and take her to his side and take her to
[2:17:53] the Palace the place he's
[2:18:00] prepared
[2:18:02] amen I believe you believe that with all
[2:18:05] your heart I certainly
[2:18:09] do
[2:18:11] amen and then there's another
[2:18:15] place it says and he came to Nazareth
[2:18:19] this is Luke 4 and two or three of the
[2:18:21] ministers that have preached have
[2:18:23] referred to this scripture and even read
[2:18:26] it but it
[2:18:30] says and he came to
[2:18:33] Nazareth where he had been brought up
[2:18:37] that's in his Earthly life in his
[2:18:38] Earthly visitation of our Lord Jesus
[2:18:41] Christ and as his custom was he went
[2:18:45] into the synagogue on the Sabbath day
[2:18:47] day and stood up for to read and there
[2:18:50] was delivered unto him the book of the
[2:18:53] prophet
[2:18:54] Isaiah there has been delivered unto you
[2:18:57] the book of The Prophet
[2:18:59] Malachi there has been delivered unto
[2:19:02] you the revealed book called The Bible
[2:19:06] the message of the hour and there was
[2:19:08] delivered unto him the book of the
[2:19:10] prophet Isaiah and when he had opened
[2:19:13] the book and when he had opened the book
[2:19:16] and that is in y time and that is for
[2:19:19] you my dear friends when he opened the
[2:19:21] book he found the place when he opened
[2:19:25] the book we found the place Hallelujah
[2:19:28] and he opened the book and he found the
[2:19:30] place the place where it was
[2:19:36] written when he opened the
[2:19:38] book he opened it for
[2:19:41] me and found the place and the prophet
[2:19:45] opened his mouth and spoke of Malachi 4
[2:19:49] 5 and 6 and read it I didn't need a
[2:19:52] bunch of sermons I didn't need a bunch
[2:19:54] of explanation as soon as he read it the
[2:19:57] Holy Spirit was present and I just said
[2:20:00] Within Myself of course amen of
[2:20:04] course this is what's right this is this
[2:20:08] has to be the truth and he spoke a false
[2:20:10] anointed ones and I said of course
[2:20:14] that's what those scriptures how come I
[2:20:16] am so ignorant that I couldn't see that
[2:20:18] before I can tell you friends without
[2:20:21] the Holy Spirit we're nothing but deaf
[2:20:24] and dumb
[2:20:29] mutes the prophet of God your Prophet
[2:20:32] said concerning this microphone he said
[2:20:35] the microphone is
[2:20:38] mute he is mute I'm a mute I I don't
[2:20:42] have anything that I can say until that
[2:20:46] voice he's a vessel he's a vessel for
[2:20:50] the voice and listen to my my friends my
[2:20:54] dear friends I speak and cry out with
[2:20:57] all the strength I have that you are the
[2:21:01] vessel you are the vessel there is no
[2:21:03] vessel like the Bride of Jesus Christ in
[2:21:07] the
[2:21:08] earth who else has this kind of
[2:21:11] indication who else has this kind of
[2:21:16] voice that's why he
[2:21:19] said the world won't see me but you will
[2:21:23] see
[2:21:25] me I will leave but you will see me
[2:21:28] again Hallelujah and you'll
[2:21:31] rejoice when you see
[2:21:36] me and he found a
[2:21:39] place in the
[2:21:41] book and when the book was opened in
[2:21:44] this time listen to me Saints and Young
[2:21:47] people as
[2:21:49] well mothers and fathers and Elders of
[2:21:52] this group that is here you can never
[2:21:56] find that place by
[2:21:58] yourself we are like the unic of
[2:22:01] Ethiopia he was reading in the book of
[2:22:04] the prophet Isaiah he's LED as a as a
[2:22:08] lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep and
[2:22:13] as a sheep is is is led to the slaughter
[2:22:17] and is and and and is before her shears
[2:22:21] and he's rejected and the scripture
[2:22:24] speaks of the terrible rejection of
[2:22:27] Jesus Christ I don't want to take the
[2:22:29] time to read it you know it in Isaiah 53
[2:22:32] and the and uh unic has the
[2:22:36] scripture has the has the scripture like
[2:22:38] you have the
[2:22:40] scripture and he perhaps had had it
[2:22:43] explained to him as well and he perhaps
[2:22:46] loved that portion and I do not know and
[2:22:48] I don't want to speak presumptuously but
[2:22:51] he needed he needed the voice of one who
[2:22:55] had received the spirit of God and know
[2:22:59] and and and knew how to take that same
[2:23:02] and the scripture says and Phillip
[2:23:04] joined himself to his
[2:23:08] Chariot and started at the same
[2:23:11] scripture I tell you my brother my
[2:23:13] sister when the prophet of God came and
[2:23:16] gave
[2:23:17] uh gave us attention gave a gave you
[2:23:21] specific attention to Malachi 4 it's not
[2:23:24] just a
[2:23:25] catchphrase it happens to be where the
[2:23:28] Holy Spirit starts at that scripture and
[2:23:31] reveals Jesus Christ and lets us know
[2:23:35] that there's a vessel that God brought
[2:23:37] on the earth at the specific time it was
[2:23:41] in this season and God prepared also
[2:23:44] that
[2:23:46] vessel
[2:23:52] H you young
[2:23:55] couples that have just been married you
[2:23:58] don't want to have to go through what
[2:24:00] God caused and allowed this Prophet to
[2:24:04] go through to be
[2:24:07] molded he also came into the hospital
[2:24:11] after his wife hope had just passed
[2:24:14] away and Dr s
[2:24:17] dare said
[2:24:20] Billy don't don't go in there now he's
[2:24:23] I'm I'm going in I have to go
[2:24:26] in and then life story when he's telling
[2:24:30] the life story
[2:24:31] friends I just read it yesterday again
[2:24:35] not I wasn't looking for it I wasn't
[2:24:37] studying it but I just came across it
[2:24:40] and it touches me so deeply because on
[2:24:43] in his ministry many years after it
[2:24:45] happened he said says now it's my duty
[2:24:48] tonight to go back over those times when
[2:24:52] he was so wounded and his heart was so
[2:24:55] bleeding and those bloody Footprints of
[2:24:59] his own life and recall for the People
[2:25:03] Like Us could sit here in relative
[2:25:06] relative peace and hear the
[2:25:10] agonizing what was it it was a
[2:25:13] body that God Was preparing
[2:25:17] that would be suitable to handle the
[2:25:20] word of God and to reveal in great
[2:25:23] secrets the messages of the hour and
[2:25:26] take us and point us to Malachi 45 and 6
[2:25:31] and point us to Revelation 3 and let us
[2:25:34] know what the message was to the leodan
[2:25:36] church and to point us to uh point us to
[2:25:39] Revelation 10 and we know Revelation 10
[2:25:43] and 7 that he wants to point us to
[2:25:45] Revelation 101 on and tell us that is
[2:25:48] Christ you'll find him in the first
[2:25:50] chapter of Malachi of of of of uh first
[2:25:55] chapter of Revelation and you find him
[2:25:57] again what's he doing he's pointing us
[2:26:00] he's starting at the same scripture it's
[2:26:02] not a new Bible it's not a new book but
[2:26:05] he's starting at the same scripture and
[2:26:08] revealing Jesus Christ to us I say to
[2:26:11] you did you see him do you see him once
[2:26:16] you see him you could never be the same

[2:26:25] bridegroom I ask you do you love
[2:26:28] him if you s Hallelujah if you see the
[2:26:32] one the prophet is speaking about you

[2:26:38] him and when you love him you be changed
[2:26:41] you'll be
[2:26:43] transformed Hallelujah because we're
[2:26:45] going to a place my brother

[2:27:14] here to stay here we're here
[2:27:17] because we're going to another
[2:27:19] place we're going to a place and I heard

[2:27:50] thought I would never see this in the
[2:27:51] message but maybe you have experienced
[2:27:54] it maybe you have some
[2:27:57] regrets maybe you have some sorrow but
[2:28:00] I'm here tonight to tell you there's
[2:28:02] somebody
[2:28:03] here more than a
[2:28:06] man more than just a
[2:28:09] congregation there's someone here and I
[2:28:12] come to declare tonight hallu I have met
[2:28:16] that person

[2:29:00] you from that place of distress and
[2:29:02] bring you into a peace my peace give I
[2:29:06] unto thee not as the world gives it
[2:29:10] Hallelujah and people of all stripes and
[2:29:13] all denominations quote those scriptures
[2:29:16] and speak about his peace and speak
[2:29:19] about his Joy but I can tell you friends
[2:29:22] there is a place where the fountain runs
[2:29:25] over with joy unspeakable and full of
[2:29:29] glory and peace such as the world knows
[2:29:32] nothing about that peace can you say
[2:29:35] amen
[2:29:38] hallelujah I say he's worthy of Our
[2:29:42] Praise
[2:29:43] [Music]
[2:29:45] Hallelujah
[2:29:48] [Applause]
[2:30:01] the unic was not an insincere
[2:30:05] man and Candace the
[2:30:08] queen he said he was the scripture said
[2:30:11] he was over all of her
[2:30:13] Treasures I've read about Candice and
[2:30:17] that name Candice is not just one
[2:30:20] individual not just one Queen but it was
[2:30:23] a title of great
[2:30:25] queens and Candace was a mighty
[2:30:29] warrior she was also a one that had many
[2:30:32] victories she was a very great Queen in
[2:30:38] Ethiopia tell you
[2:30:40] friends and this man was a great man he
[2:30:44] had a great position he also had a great
[2:30:48] place but he was not
[2:30:51] where the one he was speaking and
[2:30:53] reading of he was not where he wanted to
[2:30:56] place
[2:30:58] him Christ wanted to place him in
[2:31:00] another
[2:31:01] place so much so that the servant
[2:31:04] Phillip that spoke to him once it was
[2:31:07] revealed who that Christ was he departed
[2:31:11] off the
[2:31:13] scene a lot of people perhaps they
[2:31:17] wonder why did God allow William Brandon
[2:31:22] to be taken off the scene at a young
[2:31:25] man and a man that I highly highly
[2:31:28] highly
[2:31:29] respected very dear man and friend to
[2:31:33] me and one that saw that I should be in
[2:31:37] the ministry and he did everything he
[2:31:40] could to open doors but those same doors
[2:31:43] slammed shut as soon as they be became I
[2:31:46] soon as I became identified with the
[2:31:49] prophet in William bram's name because
[2:31:52] it was disdained or it was UN not liked
[2:31:56] and not thought highly and was not
[2:31:59] respected but
[2:32:01] I I saw first that this was a man of God
[2:32:06] I saw secondly that he was a prophet I
[2:32:09] didn't know anything about a messenger I
[2:32:12] didn't know anything about Revelation 10
[2:32:15] I didn't know anything about Revelation
[2:32:17] 3 I didn't know anything about the
[2:32:19] church ages but I can tell you friends
[2:32:22] it was no it was not some
[2:32:25] uh flashing light from Heaven it was
[2:32:29] just an
[2:32:31] illumination and when you have a
[2:32:33] revelation you don't have to be taught a
[2:32:36] revelation if you're taught and
[2:32:38] convinced about a certain thing you can
[2:32:41] be convinced out of it as well but when
[2:32:44] you have a revelation and somebody comes
[2:32:47] to convince you otherwise I'm sorry but
[2:32:49] you just come too late I've already
[2:32:52] experienced it
[2:32:57] Hallelujah you that are seeking the
[2:32:59] baptism of the Holy Ghost I want to tell
[2:33:02] you he desires to give it to you more
[2:33:05] than you already ask for it let me say
[2:33:09] something else to you I had a sister
[2:33:11] come to me and she cried for many many
[2:33:13] months and and and even in De some years
[2:33:17] she would come and and get counsel from
[2:33:20] me and and she wanted I need the Holy
[2:33:23] Ghost I said what will you do when you
[2:33:28] have the Holy
[2:33:30] Ghost said I don't know I said if you
[2:33:34] don't know what you'll do when you have
[2:33:37] the Holy Ghost how can you tell me that
[2:33:39] you don't have it and she didn't know
[2:33:42] that either and I can tell you her
[2:33:45] problem was solved she's in the church
[2:33:47] today she has not come to me for many
[2:33:50] many years concerning the Holy Spirit I
[2:33:53] can tell you friends there are people
[2:33:55] maybe who desire it and simply because
[2:33:57] you have struggles or you have uh uh
[2:34:01] things that you feel are defeats in your
[2:34:03] life and and and and we don't want just
[2:34:06] a catchphrase well you need the Holy
[2:34:08] Ghost I can tell you if you're born
[2:34:11] again you can only be birthed by the
[2:34:13] spirit Jesus said except a man be born
[2:34:18] of the spirit and of water he cannot be
[2:34:21] born again he cannot see the kingdom of
[2:34:24] God I hope you understand what I'm
[2:34:26] saying I'm not saying it's a blanket
[2:34:28] everybody has the Holy Ghost it is an
[2:34:30] experience it is something that you know
[2:34:33] but I cannot point you to the exact
[2:34:36] place perhaps others can I cannot point
[2:34:39] you but I can tell you one thing your
[2:34:41] nature will be transformed when the Holy
[2:34:44] Spirit takes a hold of you you you will
[2:34:47] be
[2:34:48] transformed whether you know it or
[2:34:50] realize it or not but you might awaken
[2:34:52] to it after some time and
[2:34:56] say I couldn't do
[2:34:58] that of myself I could not do that
[2:35:02] someone else has come in and the Master
[2:35:06] of the House has come in and he's begin
[2:35:09] to rearrange
[2:35:12] things I hope you understand I want to
[2:35:16] tell you that are seeking the Holy
[2:35:18] Spirit God desires more to give you the
[2:35:22] Holy Spirit than you could possibly
[2:35:24] desire to have it and he desires to take
[2:35:27] you to a place where you have the
[2:35:30] fullness of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah
[2:35:34] and that you know that you have it and
[2:35:36] that you're born in the seed of God and
[2:35:39] I can tell you also friends I don't try
[2:35:42] to beg people into the kingdom God is
[2:35:45] not going to lose one of
[2:35:48] his I have my faith unshakable
[2:35:52] confidence in the scripture all that the
[2:35:55] father hath given me will
[2:35:58] come you ought to say that in your
[2:36:00] language they will come Hallelujah let
[2:36:04] this congregation say they will
[2:36:08] come and further more Jesus has said Do
[2:36:11] you believe him I will lose none of them
[2:36:16] no man can pluck them out of my hand
[2:36:19] Hallelujah I don't care how many Devils
[2:36:22] of Hell come against you no man can putu
[2:36:25] me out of his hand
[2:36:28] Hallelujah now he needs to be praised
[2:36:31] glory to him he's the mighty conqueror
[2:36:35] he conquered death he conquered every
[2:36:38] doubt he conquered every sickness he
[2:36:41] conquered every disease he's the mighty
[2:36:44] conqueror and and he went into the
[2:36:46] depths of Hell itself he went to our
[2:36:49] hell and he stripped
[2:36:54] Satan and Eve said who is it he said the
[2:36:58] seed of the woman and Daniel said who is
[2:37:03] it
[2:37:05] Hallelujah Ezekiel said who is it said
[2:37:09] the wheel within the wheel that's who it
[2:37:11] was that was
[2:37:13] him and perhaps today we could say who
[2:37:17] is it and he would say I'm Revelation
[2:37:20] 101 I'm the mighty angel that has the
[2:37:23] Covenant over my head
[2:37:28] Hallelujah for those of you that might
[2:37:30] have the Life
[2:37:32] Magazine if you look on the Life
[2:37:36] Magazine where they have the picture of
[2:37:38] the
[2:37:39] cloud how many have that picture out of
[2:37:42] the Life
[2:37:44] Magazine on the backside of the original
[2:37:47] in the Life magazine and we had a
[2:37:50] brother that collected them from many
[2:37:53] many parts of the United States and
[2:37:55] bought them paid up to $25 us for one
[2:37:59] copy and sent boxes of Life magazines to
[2:38:02] us so we could give it to people and
[2:38:05] especially I started giving it to
[2:38:07] ministers but on the backside of that
[2:38:10] picture is a picture of the moon eclipse
[2:38:14] moon eclipse
[2:38:16] and and over it is a
[2:38:18] rainbow the seven colored rainbows over
[2:38:22] the top of the moon eclipse and it says
[2:38:25] this is a very rare picture because it
[2:38:28] is made up of moon beams not sunbeams
[2:38:32] but Moon Beams I thought how rare and
[2:38:36] how wonderful I don't make any doctrine
[2:38:38] of it but I can tell you that the
[2:38:40] Covenant Angel what the prophet said he
[2:38:43] the word Angel it is the mighty the
[2:38:46] angel it is the Lord none other than the
[2:38:48] Lord Jesus Christ and in Revelation 5
[2:38:52] when the book is still closed it talks
[2:38:55] about a strong
[2:38:57] Angel a strong Angel a strong
[2:39:02] messenger when the book was O when the
[2:39:04] book was closed and before that strong
[2:39:07] Angel is done here the book is
[2:39:12] open and the mighty angel in Revelation
[2:39:15] 10 one comes with the book open in his
[2:39:19] hand and I don't want to dwell on that
[2:39:21] but I want to say one thing emphatically
[2:39:24] and I trust all the translators will be
[2:39:26] able to get it exactly as I'm saying it
[2:39:29] that Mighty angel that has the book open
[2:39:33] in his hand this Earthly Angel and he
[2:39:36] said that's a Heavenly Angel but this
[2:39:39] Earthly Angel who introduced we didn't
[2:39:42] know who that was I didn't know who that
[2:39:45] was was but now I know you know how do
[2:39:49] we know because he started at the same
[2:39:52] scripture and declared Jesus Christ to
[2:39:55] us and it was perfect it was no struggle
[2:39:59] we didn't have to be taught we didn't
[2:40:01] need some great uh flash of lightning to
[2:40:05] see that it's it's it's
[2:40:10] him is it
[2:40:14] not
[2:40:22] the Bible
[2:40:23] says in Luke's
[2:40:26] gospel and all bear him witness and
[2:40:30] wandered at the gracious Words which
[2:40:32] proceeded out of his mouth and they
[2:40:37] said this was the scripture and the
[2:40:40] people wondered at the gracious words
[2:40:42] that proceeded out of his mouth and they
[2:40:44] said
[2:40:46] is not this Joseph's
[2:40:51] son see friends people read the same
[2:40:56] scripture they read the same scripture
[2:40:59] they read the same Revelation that you
[2:41:02] read and they have a wrong
[2:41:06] conclusion they said isn't this Joseph's
[2:41:10] son those that heard it and wondered at
[2:41:14] the gracious words which proceeded out
[2:41:16] of his mouth they came up with the wrong
[2:41:19] conclusion and friends that's why I'm
[2:41:23] very pleased to be here amongst a group
[2:41:26] of
[2:41:27] people thanks be to God who prepared a
[2:41:31] vessel for
[2:41:37] us it isn't because we're smart it isn't
[2:41:41] because we came we're specially gifted
[2:41:44] it's because God God loved his people
[2:41:48] and God gave us the right
[2:41:53] conclusion all things are of Christ all
[2:41:56] things are his he gave it to us
[2:42:00] freely

[2:42:33] wonderful
[2:42:34] opportunities that I had been

[2:42:40] testimony of the Angel of the Lord
[2:42:43] coming into the
[2:42:44] car
[2:42:46] and having him speak to me on the log
[2:42:50] and answer the

[2:44:23] young man walked in and walked into this
[2:44:26] service just while I was giving my
[2:44:30] testimony he walked in I said I want to
[2:44:33] say to you when there's an atmosphere

[2:44:58] young man came from I don't know the
[2:45:01] places that he's been in but he's
[2:45:04] probably in some dark dark place and our
[2:45:07] Lord Jesus Christ led him to another
[2:45:13] place and in this place thank you

[2:46:44] so
[2:46:47] Victorious he has done what we could not
[2:46:52] do that father did not
[2:46:55] arrange perhaps had no idea that his son
[2:46:59] was coming from someplace I know not
[2:47:02] where but someplace in Germany coming
[2:47:05] from that place to this
[2:47:09] place so that Jesus Christ could take a
[2:47:12] hold of him and take him to another
[2:47:19] [Applause]
[2:47:29] place just so that you'll
[2:47:32] remember we have there can be a written
[2:47:36] book and every book must have an
[2:47:41] author then there is a sealed book
[2:47:46] then there is a the claimed
[2:47:49] book that's still not
[2:47:52] sufficient then there is the open
[2:47:55] book and it even requires more than that
[2:47:59] it requires that the author reveal the
[2:48:04] book and then you manifest the
[2:48:10] book my life is worthless unless I can
[2:48:14] manifest
[2:48:15] what's been made
[2:48:17] real
[2:48:19] Hallelujah glory to God and when my Lord
[2:48:23] Jesus said you will preach this
[2:48:26] gospel not just here in Jerusalem but in
[2:48:29] Jerusalem and in Samaria and in Judea
[2:48:32] until the uttermost part uttermost part
[2:48:36] of the earth take it back to Malawi or
[2:48:40] Zimbabwe or Angola or Congo or into
[2:48:45] brazaville or wherever it may be we take
[2:48:48] it back to the United Kingdom take it
[2:48:51] back to America but I can tell you
[2:48:54] America doesn't need a new president as
[2:48:57] much as it needs Jesus
[2:49:00] Christ and they have they have passed
[2:49:04] their day of redemption according to the
[2:49:06] prophet as a
[2:49:13] nation I don't know what whether you
[2:49:15] agree with me or
[2:49:18] [Music]
[2:49:19] not this Prophet said if they had
[2:49:23] recognized the
[2:49:25] gift the gift of God as the as the Lord
[2:49:29] Jesus said to the woman at the well and
[2:49:33] how you heard brother George Smith speak
[2:49:35] I believe he said that brother brandham
[2:49:38] referred to that scripture perhaps
[2:49:40] hundreds of times I remember one time
[2:49:43] where he said something on this order
[2:49:46] that the angel had directed him to that
[2:49:50] scripture and that's why almost almost
[2:49:54] every prayer line he's referring to
[2:49:57] Jesus felt directed to go to Samaria and
[2:50:01] there he stopped at a well to rest that
[2:50:04] was another
[2:50:06] place and a woman was coming to that
[2:50:09] place she was coming wherever her home
[2:50:12] was listen to me friends maybe your car
[2:50:15] is parked outside or you have airplane
[2:50:18] tickets in your in your briefcase at the
[2:50:22] room God's not interested in that it's
[2:50:25] not that he's not interested but he's
[2:50:27] interested in something more I will
[2:50:30] collect them together in this place in
[2:50:35] this place that God has laid upon the
[2:50:38] heart of his servant brother colen
[2:50:40] Brunner and he has invited other men to
[2:50:43] come and to preach preach and you
[2:50:45] Brethren that have picked up the word of
[2:50:47] God you're Duty bound to speak what the
[2:50:51] prophet of God has spoken we are Duty
[2:50:53] bound to stay with the message
[2:50:57] Hallelujah all of the message it's not a
[2:50:59] smorgus
[2:51:01] [Applause]
[2:51:05] board it's not walking down the line and
[2:51:08] taking what you like taking another
[2:51:11] piece that you like that's not this
[2:51:13] message that's not this lamb you eat all
[2:51:16] of it you eat the bitter herbs you beat
[2:51:19] all of it Hallelujah this Passover Lamb
[2:51:23] we eat it all say well this isn't
[2:51:25] exactly what I this doesn't tickle me he
[2:51:28] he's not just having you take the good
[2:51:30] parts we're not just taking the steaks
[2:51:34] and the roasts but we take the better
[2:51:36] herbs and there are things about this
[2:51:39] life of Christ that are not that
[2:51:43] Pleasant
[2:51:46] Hallelujah I have your
[2:51:50] attention the prophet of
[2:51:52] God went into little Sharon
[2:51:56] Rose and he said that little baby A
[2:52:01] little girl his wife has just passed
[2:52:04] away and he begs
[2:52:07] God don't take
[2:52:09] her don't take her and he said it was
[2:52:12] like his prayers were bouncing on off of
[2:52:14] the ceiling he said that she bent and
[2:52:17] she was bowed over like a
[2:52:20] banana because she was in such pain and
[2:52:23] she was in such pain I ask you what's
[2:52:27] going through the heart of the
[2:52:30] father what's going through brother
[2:52:32] bram's heart that was a molding process
[2:52:35] brother Ron
[2:52:37] Spencer I heard you speak on at Edmonton
[2:52:41] and I never forgot those words the
[2:52:44] molding process to make it the kind of
[2:52:48] vessel he wants a prepared vessel I'll
[2:52:53] form this vessel I'll make it the kind
[2:52:56] of vessel we may have all kinds of other
[2:52:59] desires but he has a desire I'm going to
[2:53:02] mold this vessel into a member of the B
[2:53:07] bride bride body my
[2:53:11] lover the Lover of My Soul he's lover my
[2:53:15] soul that's the kind of person he is and
[2:53:19] what do you think went through the
[2:53:21] prophet's mind you that are mothers I'll
[2:53:24] tell you he speaks of it he said she was
[2:53:28] in such pain her eyes
[2:53:32] crossed and that touches me very deep
[2:53:35] because the first thing I saw when I was
[2:53:37] sitting 1 2 3 I was sitting like where
[2:53:39] you were
[2:53:42] sitting and the place had had several
[2:53:44] thousand
[2:53:46] people and the girl a mother brought the
[2:53:49] girl up and her eyes I there was no eyes
[2:53:54] there it was just all white but I was
[2:53:58] sitting close enough and I could see
[2:54:00] there was just a little bit of the black
[2:54:02] of the ball of the eye and the prophet
[2:54:06] said when he had seen Sharon Rose his
[2:54:10] little darling daughter in such pain he
[2:54:13] said
[2:54:15] God by God's grace I have never been
[2:54:19] able to see a crosseyed child without
[2:54:22] seeing it
[2:54:24] healed but the mothers and fathers of
[2:54:27] those children did not know what that
[2:54:31] Prophet went through what the vessel
[2:54:34] went through to have that kind of faith
[2:54:37] and that kind of Courage against the
[2:54:39] enemy that would hold those eyes crossed
[2:54:43] like that and he said he had about 400
[2:54:46] cases in some months of crossed eyes and
[2:54:49] he said God healed every one of them but
[2:54:53] not those parents those parents didn't
[2:54:55] know about
[2:54:56] it and maybe you didn't know about it
[2:55:00] and you hear men of God come up and
[2:55:06] Minister friends I'm deeply moved
[2:55:09] because this these are my last words
[2:55:11] maybe the last words I'll ever be able
[2:55:13] to speak in German me I want to tell you
[2:55:16] out of the desperation of my own soul I
[2:55:19] want to
[2:55:20] testify there is a book of Acts being
[2:55:25] written behind this
[2:55:27] bride whether you realize it or not I'm
[2:55:30] declaring it to you this bride there's a
[2:55:33] book of Acts this is a supernatural
[2:55:36] bride your call is Supernatural him
[2:55:39] calling you was Supernatural you young
[2:55:42] men you young ladies listen to this
[2:55:47] voice God's call in your life is Grace
[2:55:52] Grace
[2:55:54] Grace I'm amazed that he loved
[2:55:59] me often we don't know who's sitting
[2:56:02] around us I know something of our
[2:56:05] brother Ron Spencer and brother Tim puit
[2:56:08] because we've known each other for many
[2:56:10] years it's not because we are have some
[2:56:13] special affection

[2:58:00] faith and he said to the doctor he said
[2:58:04] you just don't know who you're talking
[2:58:06] to and he said where's my
[2:58:08] son and they led him to this man in the
[2:58:13] in broken all
[2:58:14] up and the doctors have just declared
[2:58:17] he'll never walk

[3:10:04] few moments to tell
[3:10:11] you
[3:10:13] I I took brother brandom on his hunt on
[3:10:15] a his
[3:10:17] rest in May
[3:10:23] 1961 the last two weeks of
[3:10:27] May I had been in quite a number of
[3:10:29] brother brenham's meetings but in the
[3:10:32] meeting in Dawson Creek which is where
[3:10:35] my wife was
[3:10:37] born a woman is standing over
[3:10:40] here she's a German woman
[3:10:43] woman very well known as very dear
[3:10:46] friends of my father and
[3:10:50] stepmother her name was Sister clun KL u
[3:10:53] n t
[3:10:56] clun she and her
[3:10:59] husband come to our church or they come
[3:11:01] to the church in Fort St John where they
[3:11:05] lived I wish I had my map here but Fort
[3:11:08] St John
[3:11:09] is 42 K 42 miles but maybe 60 kilometers
[3:11:15] north of Dawson Creek on the Alaskan
[3:11:19] Highway and brother Branham is here
[3:11:22] you'll have to listen very close to
[3:11:26] to lay hold of the
[3:11:30] subtle uh movements of the Holy Spirit I
[3:11:34] tell you he's so that's why people
[3:11:36] remain blind to his moving because
[3:11:39] they're they're not keen enough I want
[3:11:42] want you to be Keen now and brother bam
[3:11:45] is standing here and I'm sitting over
[3:11:47] there on the
[3:11:49] platform and I know this woman very well
[3:11:53] and I have big questions in my heart I'm
[3:11:56] sitting on the platform with big
[3:11:58] questions in my heart concerning brother
[3:12:01] brandham because I heard that he taught
[3:12:04] that Cain was the son of the serpent we
[3:12:06] have never heard such
[3:12:08] things it wasn't that I was
[3:12:11] doubting I wasn't disbelieving I
[3:12:14] believed him to be a great man of God in
[3:12:17] fact is it was a meeting like this I was
[3:12:19] so anxious to see what happened and if
[3:12:23] he performed the same
[3:12:26] way and in my Simplicity that's all I
[3:12:29] was wondering but I wasn't even there
[3:12:31] with questions I just was sitting there
[3:12:34] observing what was happening and now
[3:12:37] here's sister clun I know her well very
[3:12:41] good friends of my parents
[3:12:43] and the prophet is about 2 MERS
[3:12:47] away and he he
[3:12:50] says you can hear it on tape it's on the
[3:12:53] Dawson Creek series he said now you're
[3:12:57] not from this place said you you are
[3:13:01] praying for a
[3:13:03] man and that man has is shadowed with
[3:13:08] death he's dying with
[3:13:11] cancer and I believe that man is not
[3:13:14] from the
[3:13:16] city he's from a town just north of here
[3:13:19] called it's like he's reading it he's
[3:13:22] called Fort St
[3:13:24] John and he didn't he didn't say that
[3:13:28] you know he's healed or anything he just
[3:13:30] said go your way and you know whatever
[3:13:33] God bless you and sister Clint moved
[3:13:36] away the next day we're leaving very
[3:13:40] early in the morning brother brandham
[3:13:42] does not know where I'm taking him he he
[3:13:46] knows that we're going on the Alaskan
[3:13:48] Highway but he doesn't know exactly am I
[3:13:51] all
[3:13:54] right thank
[3:13:56] you he doesn't
[3:13:58] know exactly where we're leaving we're
[3:14:01] leaving in this small city so we drive
[3:14:04] out of this city and he's actually
[3:14:06] driving the car and we start up the
[3:14:09] Alaskan Highway he's in his denim
[3:14:12] clothes relaxing clothes he has that
[3:14:15] little uh White cowboy hat on and uh and
[3:14:20] we're just talking and we're relaxing
[3:14:22] now the meetings are over and it was a
[3:14:25] big load off of his shoulders of course
[3:14:28] and I I was happy that we were able just
[3:14:31] to go this was the object of him coming
[3:14:35] that we I we'd be able to take him to my
[3:14:37] good friend brother
[3:14:39] brother his name is Bud Southwick
[3:14:44] and uh I told you the other day he had
[3:14:46] just sold his Ranch and the government
[3:14:49] gave him this territory brother brandham
[3:14:52] was his first
[3:14:53] Hunter on this
[3:14:56] territory and so we're driving and we're
[3:14:59] coming we're coming to the city of Fort
[3:15:02] St John small City maybe 5 6,000 people
[3:15:09] and when the United States Army called
[3:15:11] the US D which is the United States
[3:15:14] Engineers division when they were
[3:15:17] building that Highway it was a war
[3:15:20] project because the Japanese were
[3:15:22] invading and coming up the uan islands
[3:15:25] and had already captured two one of them
[3:15:28] I believe is ATU
[3:15:31] at and they needed to get heavy
[3:15:33] equipment into Alaska or they may lose
[3:15:36] the entire state so the Canadian and
[3:15:40] United States government agreed together
[3:15:44] the United States would build the
[3:15:46] highway and the Canadian government
[3:15:49] would undertake to maintain it
[3:15:53] forever and they still
[3:15:57] do we're driving up the highway and when
[3:15:59] they came when the US Army came to the
[3:16:02] area where Fort St John Fort St John was
[3:16:06] down towards the Peace River maybe 3
[3:16:08] four miles and they just they they
[3:16:10] couldn't wait for anything friend
[3:16:13] you've never seen a highway built like
[3:16:14] this
[3:16:17] one if a truck went over the bank they
[3:16:20] just left it for the most part they just
[3:16:24] time was of the essence and they built
[3:16:27] 1,000 523
[3:16:30] miles who who's got calculus and can
[3:16:33] tell us how many kilometers that is
[3:16:37] 1,500
[3:16:41] miles it's about 2,200 kmet I
[3:16:45] think are you
[3:16:48] listening they built it in s
[3:16:52] months 7 months and pushed trucks
[3:16:56] through in s
[3:16:58] months and I was living on that Highway
[3:17:02] my father was a carpenter they called
[3:17:05] him the holy
[3:17:06] Carpenter because he was a Christian so
[3:17:09] we knew what that was very early my
[3:17:11] daughter and wife perhaps hear that for
[3:17:13] the first time but they called him a
[3:17:16] holy
[3:17:17] Carpenter a as as something against him
[3:17:21] because that's what they figured Jesus
[3:17:23] was was a holy
[3:17:24] Carpenter and that's what we lived
[3:17:27] under but my father would witness
[3:17:29] wherever he could witness and now when
[3:17:33] the US Army put this road through here
[3:17:35] it went right through a right in a farm
[3:17:38] and The Farmhouse just laid about 100
[3:17:42] 200 m to the right a big white house and
[3:17:47] I knew that house i' passed it all my
[3:17:50] childhood every time we drove on the
[3:17:53] highway I I even wondered about that
[3:17:57] house brother Southwick also had been
[3:18:02] born just north of Fort St John and he
[3:18:05] lived off in a Wilderness you talk about
[3:18:08] Wilderness hello you people in Germany
[3:18:11] you don't have Wilderness like this this
[3:18:14] is Wilderness that's void of
[3:18:17] humans you could go from a point of Fort
[3:18:19] St John you could go north for maybe
[3:18:24] over 2,000 kilometers and never say a
[3:18:28] human you could go straight South for
[3:18:30] another 7 800 kilometers I guarantee you
[3:18:34] never see a human this is where we're
[3:18:36] taking brother
[3:18:38] Brenham and what is called the Rocky
[3:18:40] Mountain Trench
[3:18:44] and it's a vast I stood brother brandham
[3:18:47] on a on a curb side of the road and the
[3:18:50] road just fell away I lived as a boy
[3:18:54] about 10 years old at the bottom of that
[3:18:58] mountain and I knew they call it
[3:19:00] Steamboat Mountain because of its shape
[3:19:04] and I stood there I wanted to stop and
[3:19:07] we had the car stop and brother brandham
[3:19:09] got out and we walked to the edge of the
[3:19:12] Mountain edge of the road just a gravel
[3:19:15] road and it just fell away like
[3:19:18] this way down to the bottom and then the
[3:19:22] bush it was a the spruce which is dark
[3:19:27] almost black and just going on and on
[3:19:31] wide valleys miles and miles wide like
[3:19:35] that and at the end of this one Valley
[3:19:40] you can see mountains little row of
[3:19:43] purple mountains about that
[3:19:45] high and I said I don't know for sure
[3:19:48] brother Benham I understand that this
[3:19:50] Valley is 75 miles that' be about 100
[3:19:54] kilometers across just one
[3:19:59] Valley now I want you say why are you
[3:20:01] saying that I'm saying that so that
[3:20:04] you'll understand when the prophet
[3:20:07] speaks about rugged Christians it's
[3:20:09] because he was a rugged prophet
[3:20:12] amen he brought a rugged message and I
[3:20:16] read it today he said after the curtain
[3:20:20] of time and when he went beyond the
[3:20:22] curtain of time you know what the going
[3:20:24] beyond the curtain of time did for him
[3:20:27] made him I'll never
[3:20:30] compromise I'll never compromise with
[3:20:34] this message aren't you
[3:20:37] glad that you had a man who was a rugged
[3:20:40] Prophet that would not compromise on the
[3:20:43] word of God and even though the
[3:20:45] denominations offered him big amounts of
[3:20:48] money and he said that uh they offered
[3:20:52] him huge amounts of money he said you'll
[3:20:55] never worry about money
[3:20:57] again you'll just need to adjust your
[3:20:59] Doctrine a little bit on some minor
[3:21:03] things so he wanted to know what what
[3:21:05] was the minor things what was minor in
[3:21:08] their mind you know what was minor the
[3:21:11] godhead
[3:21:13] and the baptism is that minor to us
[3:21:17] those are major doctrines I say thank
[3:21:20] God we had a rugged
[3:21:23] Man Elijah was a rugged Man they would
[3:21:26] not compromise on the word of God is
[3:21:28] this all
[3:21:32] right and so as we were going past this
[3:21:35] big white house just listen close and
[3:21:38] I'm I'm expecting maybe at any moment I
[3:21:42] won't point to any person but he I was
[3:21:45] expecting he was going to say you
[3:21:49] rascal you're not really believing
[3:21:52] everything I couldn't believe everything
[3:21:54] it wasn't revealed to me yet I didn't
[3:21:57] know but I was
[3:21:58] honest I was absolutely honest he never
[3:22:01] ever said that and as we drive past that
[3:22:04] big white house he said put his head
[3:22:08] back said there was a there was a woman
[3:22:12] was up in the prayer line
[3:22:14] yesterday praying for a man from Fort St
[3:22:17] John oh brother Bram I said that's a
[3:22:20] very good friend of our of our family I
[3:22:24] said her name is Sister clun he's not
[3:22:26] paying any attention he's Sayang and and
[3:22:30] and he slowed down because the speed
[3:22:31] limit was only 30 kilomet and he and now
[3:22:35] we're going past the house slowly and he
[3:22:38] says the man's in that house
[3:22:44] have you ever heard the Devil speak he
[3:22:47] always has a doubt right away I said
[3:22:49] well how do I know he's in that house
[3:22:52] that's a thought that shot through my
[3:22:53] mind how do I know he's in that house we
[3:22:56] get
[3:22:57] 375 about 500 kmet up the highway and
[3:23:01] we're at brother Southwick and this was
[3:23:03] his town or his village and he lived
[3:23:06] about 50 kilometers away that's where
[3:23:09] his Ranch was and I'm I'm anxious to
[3:23:11] tell brother Southwick about this uh
[3:23:15] about talking and calling out and saying
[3:23:18] that the man's in that house and brother
[3:23:20] Southwick says that's right he said I
[3:23:23] know him his name is Ed Thomas and I
[3:23:26] know that he also is dying with cancer I
[3:23:29] said well brother brandham called out
[3:23:31] sister Clint because he knows sister
[3:23:33] Clint I said he called her out and so
[3:23:36] now I had I was on the platform knew the
[3:23:40] woman heard what he said said I didn't
[3:23:42] know anything about Mr Thomas dying with
[3:23:45] cancer now we get up the Alaskan Highway
[3:23:48] and I'm 375 about 500 kilm and I'm
[3:23:52] trying to explain to brother Bud cuz Bud
[3:23:55] was a
[3:23:56] raw he was just a raw Wilderness man he
[3:24:00] doesn't know anything about Genesis or
[3:24:02] Revelation or Matthew Mark or Luke he
[3:24:06] doesn't know anything about the Bible
[3:24:08] but he understands the Wilderness I'm
[3:24:11] going to answer some questions for you
[3:24:12] just now and he says well that's correct
[3:24:16] he said I I I've known Ed Thomas since I
[3:24:18] was a boy about 8 years old and he he
[3:24:21] lives in that house and I also know he's
[3:24:24] dying with cancer so now I had two
[3:24:30] witnesses and I was just wondering you
[3:24:33] know I I I'm I'm God is so tenderly
[3:24:36] saying see it's true see it's true true
[3:24:42] I never got a rebuke I never got anybody
[3:24:45] chastising me he never tried to convince
[3:24:48] me in the scripture this is how it works
[3:24:51] he was just living the
[3:24:54] life and it convinced me and I just saw
[3:24:58] I I saw you know what I saw friends
[3:25:01] precious friends I saw the pages of the
[3:25:05] Bible just come
[3:25:07] alive one page after another
[3:25:10] page this is what they did in the Bible
[3:25:12] this is what Jesus did this is like this
[3:25:16] is like Jesus is here again this is what
[3:25:18] he did he went to places and and he he
[3:25:22] he explained it to the people and this
[3:25:24] is what Jesus did the Bible do you know
[3:25:27] why you're sitting
[3:25:29] here that's what his wife
[3:25:33] does now he's not here physically but
[3:25:37] you are here physically he said and I
[3:25:40] will be in you
[3:25:43] Hallelujah I am the father one and I
[3:25:46] will be in you why is he in us to do the
[3:25:49] same things and we don't have to
[3:25:51] struggle we don't have to strive we
[3:25:53] don't have to try it just comes natural
[3:25:56] when we have the Holy Ghost in us we
[3:25:58] just live that life that's all there is
[3:26:01] to it we can't help
[3:26:02] it I've had people say well I I I I feel
[3:26:06] like giving up I said well if you can
[3:26:08] just go ahead throw in the towel give
[3:26:11] give up and then they say well I can't
[3:26:16] that's
[3:26:17] good that's good you you can't give up I
[3:26:20] can't give up either you can't give
[3:26:23] up so that was one and I put that in my
[3:26:27] heart then we got up now I'm coming to a
[3:26:31] very tender spot so I want you to listen
[3:26:33] close you're very
[3:26:37] nice is it better if I stand on the
[3:26:39] platform is this a
[3:26:45] okay we get up on in This Magnificent
[3:26:49] country which I Can't Describe for you
[3:26:53] but there mostly grass and
[3:26:56] flowers and
[3:26:58] nothing no trace of human no sound of a
[3:27:03] Jet Plane no sound of cars or
[3:27:06] automobiles and we can't even have our
[3:27:08] horses up there we just walk and we sat
[3:27:11] on the
[3:27:13] hillside and brother brandom began to
[3:27:16] describe beyond the curtain of
[3:27:23] time he looked up this Great
[3:27:27] Valley look down the scenery friends is
[3:27:32] beyond
[3:27:34] description and not only the scenery but
[3:27:36] the ruggedness and not only the
[3:27:38] ruggedness the
[3:27:40] serenity la of
[3:27:43] humans humans are the
[3:27:46] pollutant they're trying to and they God
[3:27:50] don't let me get on this but they want
[3:27:51] to environmentally clean up the world
[3:27:53] they can't clean up the world as long as
[3:27:55] man is
[3:27:57] here you
[3:27:59] understand and there's no human it's so
[3:28:03] pure and he said brother
[3:28:06] Eddie now so that you can follow
[3:28:10] this on February
[3:28:14] 1961 the Full Gospel
[3:28:16] businessmen put out their
[3:28:19] pamphlet called Full Full Gospel
[3:28:22] voice and they have Brother brenham's
[3:28:25] picture on the front cover and he's
[3:28:28] holding his Bible you've seen it brother
[3:28:31] caps he's holding his Bible I'll just
[3:28:34] say to you as a as a friend friend to
[3:28:37] friend uh the eyes of brother Branham in
[3:28:41] that picture is the closest to him when
[3:28:46] he's under that anointing and under
[3:28:50] Visions they caught it I I've seen the
[3:28:52] picture was taken right after and that
[3:28:55] and he's smiling and that's not but
[3:28:57] these eyes now are
[3:29:00] completely the reason why friends I talk
[3:29:04] about it is but I was maybe a foot
[3:29:08] away looking in those eyes it wasn't the
[3:29:12] eyes so much it was just the
[3:29:14] whole appearance of him but God was
[3:29:18] looking through those
[3:29:22] eyes I was as a I was as naked I
[3:29:25] couldn't now I understood when brother
[3:29:27] brandham says to people women sometimes
[3:29:31] you sometimes men and he says you
[3:29:35] couldn't hide a thing in your life now
[3:29:38] if you
[3:29:39] tried you could not hide a thing and I
[3:29:43] have said so many times I know exactly
[3:29:45] what that was I knew I was totally
[3:29:48] stripped naked and then I understood the
[3:29:53] Judgment God's not going to have to
[3:29:55] stand there and condemn people you will
[3:29:58] condemn yourself because you will know
[3:30:01] you'll know if if you're a Critic in
[3:30:04] this meeting you'll face that again
[3:30:07] you'll come before an allseeing eye you
[3:30:11] come before a mind that knows the
[3:30:13] beginning and the end and that listen to
[3:30:17] me friends that was displayed in that
[3:30:19] prophet's life I've seen I've seen power
[3:30:24] that was just a silent and power over
[3:30:28] the
[3:30:29] elements power that uh would leave an
[3:30:33] average B just weak but on this occasion
[3:30:39] now brother bman saying and I I'm
[3:30:42] getting such a unveiling I'm seeing now
[3:30:45] what the judgment is like and I'm
[3:30:48] understanding these
[3:30:49] things and
[3:30:52] uh he said
[3:30:54] now brother Edie we're sitting on this
[3:30:58] Hillside and this was in the last two
[3:31:01] weeks of May of
[3:31:02] 1961 and that picture was in February
[3:31:06] now here we are in May and he looks up
[3:31:09] this Valley and down
[3:31:12] said brother Eddie on the other
[3:31:15] side it's just very much like
[3:31:19] this he says and when you cross
[3:31:22] over you'll find some little paths or
[3:31:25] little
[3:31:26] Trails he said you walk down one of
[3:31:28] those one day and you'll find
[3:31:32] me tell you what friends that has meant
[3:31:35] so much to
[3:31:38] me that could not be a lie
[3:31:42] he was telling me the truth you cross
[3:31:45] you go down one of those Pathways and
[3:31:47] you'll find me and so I I look I just
[3:31:51] tonight I've never done it in my
[3:31:54] life just tonight I went in beyond the
[3:31:57] curtain of time and I wanted to see how
[3:32:00] many times he used that
[3:32:02] phrase once in
[3:32:05] 1955 when he speaks on
[3:32:08] MDC Mighty Prince and King
[3:32:11] he used beond the curtain of time
[3:32:14] once the second time was when he has
[3:32:18] brother Neville read what the four
[3:32:21] gospel
[3:32:22] businessmen uh printed in their book of
[3:32:25] brother Bram relating going beyond the
[3:32:28] curtain of time the third time was when
[3:32:31] I didn't know that till this evening the
[3:32:35] third time was I was sitting behind him
[3:32:38] and he told it he didn't tell about it
[3:32:40] but he he just mentioned beyond the
[3:32:42] curtain of time in Dawson Creek and that
[3:32:44] was in May and a few days later we went
[3:32:49] we went hunting and then he he describes
[3:32:54] beyond that and he said brother Eddie I
[3:32:57] was um I was laying in bed and sister
[3:33:02] mey was still
[3:33:03] sleeping and I woke up quite early he
[3:33:06] said I had my hands behind my head like
[3:33:09] this
[3:33:12] he said I said to
[3:33:14] myself well Bill Branham you're getting
[3:33:17] to be an old man now he said he was
[3:33:25] 52 he said if you're going to do
[3:33:28] anything for God you better get
[3:33:31] going I thought oh my you know how how
[3:33:35] that affected me I felt like
[3:33:37] nobody I thought there was no hope for
[3:33:40] me
[3:33:41] if you're going to do anything for
[3:33:43] God he's been here to Africa he's been
[3:33:48] to some many of these
[3:33:50] places and I thought if he was going to
[3:33:52] do anything for
[3:33:54] God and
[3:33:56] he uh then a few moments
[3:34:00] later he said
[3:34:03] uh I was standing I was I was laying in
[3:34:07] bed and uh one came to me and the voice
[3:34:12] said would you like to see what's beyond
[3:34:14] the curtain at
[3:34:16] time and he said oh that would help me
[3:34:19] so
[3:34:20] much he said brother Eddie it was
[3:34:24] just uh instant there's no sensation I
[3:34:28] didn't have any feeling and I was
[3:34:31] standing about 20 ft from my body and I
[3:34:34] was looking at myself and he said and I
[3:34:37] was standing there and then here came
[3:34:40] ladies
[3:34:41] young ladies and he describes them
[3:34:43] you've read it long hair and long dress
[3:34:47] and he says then they embraced him and
[3:34:50] said our brother our precious brother
[3:34:53] and then came the
[3:34:55] man and he describes it exactly as he
[3:34:58] wrote it now I want to tell you then I
[3:35:03] hope I don't get
[3:35:04] misunderstood a few weeks
[3:35:07] later I received that that little
[3:35:09] pamphlet that magazine Full Gospel man's
[3:35:12] voice in the mail from brother brandham
[3:35:16] and he just said on it to brother
[3:35:19] Eddie and uh then he opened it
[3:35:23] up I opened it up and he had an arrow
[3:35:27] from Beyond the curtain of time the the
[3:35:30] the the capital the the title of the and
[3:35:34] it had an arrow down to a
[3:35:39] box I don't know if there's any
[3:35:41] Christian businessmen here but listen
[3:35:43] this is what they said not what he said
[3:35:47] that's what they said in Bible days
[3:35:51] there were prophets and seers of God but
[3:35:55] in all the sacred records there was none
[3:35:58] as great or none greater than that of
[3:36:01] William brandham a prophet and a saer of
[3:36:04] God who in the name of Jesus has raised
[3:36:07] the
[3:36:09] Dead
[3:36:11] I gave that to a Muslim
[3:36:14] man I gave that to a Muslim man just a
[3:36:19] some weeks ago and he asked me he said
[3:36:22] Mr Bisal can you give me some words of
[3:36:24] wisdom about your size about your
[3:36:28] age and he he's such a fine young man he
[3:36:31] was in my home and he said can you give
[3:36:34] me some words of wisdom he said kind of
[3:36:38] what made you what you are and I took I
[3:36:41] took that little pamphlet I have it
[3:36:43] behind glass and I took it
[3:36:46] out and I handed it to him I said I met
[3:36:50] this
[3:36:51] man and from that day my life was
[3:36:55] transformed and I said I said read this
[3:36:58] at the bottom please and he read that
[3:37:02] and he said
[3:37:03] my raise the
[3:37:06] dead and and I haven't spoken to him uh
[3:37:10] send on the subject but I'm just
[3:37:13] expecting that God will move him from
[3:37:17] that
[3:37:18] place am if you're here tonight and you
[3:37:22] have trust in some
[3:37:25] other uh your confidence is in someplace
[3:37:29] else I'm here to tell you that there's
[3:37:32] not only is there one here but he's
[3:37:34] wanting to move
[3:37:36] you if you're
[3:37:38] struggling he B to move you you to
[3:37:42] victory and this is this is a true Rec a
[3:37:46] true record of beyond the curtain at
[3:37:49] time and I want you to read it he pleads
[3:37:52] with the people don't don't miss
[3:37:56] this and only perfect love can enter
[3:38:00] there
[3:38:09] amen
[3:38:14] I'm very conscious of our time and I'm
[3:38:15] going to
[3:38:17] close in just a couple of
[3:38:20] minutes but I want to tell you my wife
[3:38:23] and I just a
[3:38:26] few maybe a few months ago we traveled
[3:38:30] to one of the Native Indian
[3:38:32] Villages that I was going to and also
[3:38:35] had many of those people come to brother
[3:38:37] bram's meeting you will hear the tape
[3:38:39] it's in Port El
[3:38:41] Bernie and there's a young man his name
[3:38:45] is Steven Tate t a
[3:38:47] t and he had epilepsy very very bad he
[3:38:52] was sitting in the meeting in Port El
[3:38:55] Bernie and
[3:38:57] uh they didn't expect that he would live
[3:39:00] maybe Beyond 20 he was 19 I thought he
[3:39:04] was 16 but he was 19 at the time and so
[3:39:09] we were sitting with the former pastor's
[3:39:11] wife my wife and I in her home and we
[3:39:14] were saying what about this one she said
[3:39:16] well they've passed on what about this
[3:39:18] one or they've passed on what about
[3:39:21] sister Tate and Steven Tate is Steven
[3:39:24] Tate still living oh yes yes Stephen
[3:39:26] Tate is in the senior citizen's home and
[3:39:29] you'll go right past it in in in Port El
[3:39:32] Bernie so we stopped there the next
[3:39:35] morning and we walked into the senior
[3:39:37] citizen home older people everywhere
[3:39:40] and uh I said I'd like to see Steven
[3:39:43] Tate and he was sitting right there in a
[3:39:45] wheelchair he said I wasn't supposed to
[3:39:48] be in this wheelchair but he said I I uh
[3:39:50] I I just stumbled and I fell and so they
[3:39:53] put me in this wheelchair I said do you
[3:39:55] remember being in brother brenham's
[3:39:57] meetings in uh in
[3:40:02] 1962 oh yeah he said I remember I
[3:40:06] remember being there I said you had
[3:40:08] epilepsy yeah said I had epilepsy I said
[3:40:13] have you uh have you had any spells have
[3:40:17] you fall under the spell of epilepsy he
[3:40:20] said I never had one since he spoke to
[3:40:27] me I say to you my friends who does
[3:40:31] that who did that Jesus simply the Bible
[3:40:36] says he sent his word and healed them I
[3:40:39] don't know what happened happened all I
[3:40:41] know I'm sitting on the platform and and
[3:40:44] and he calls out Steven Tate but he
[3:40:46] tells he tells also very honestly that
[3:40:50] EP that epep epilepsy spirit is a very
[3:40:53] stubborn Spirit very difficult to handle
[3:40:57] but he said just sends that word and
[3:41:00] then and with this I'm
[3:41:02] closing he stands and I'm sitting there
[3:41:05] my wife was actually playing the piano
[3:41:07] and he turns like this and looks up into
[3:41:10] the Gable of the little Hall of the
[3:41:12] building we were in he
[3:41:15] says now when he was here with
[3:41:19] Abraham he turned his
[3:41:22] back on the
[3:41:24] tent he says I'll turn my
[3:41:27] back now he said and I know every
[3:41:31] detail I know every detail I don't have
[3:41:34] to read this and get refreshed I know
[3:41:36] every detail I know these people
[3:41:39] personally
[3:41:40] and uh he
[3:41:43] said there's a
[3:41:45] man that's
[3:41:47] paralyzed and I said right away I oh
[3:41:50] that's brother Jacob brother
[3:41:53] Jacob's the brother who led me into open
[3:41:56] some doors in the ministry was sitting
[3:41:58] right beside me he had visited him that
[3:42:02] day and and brother Jacob was in that
[3:42:08] City and I when he said his name is Mr
[3:42:13] Jacob no he didn't say his name is Mr
[3:42:15] Jacob he said he's paralyzed and I said
[3:42:18] I knew that he was up in an Indian
[3:42:22] village many many miles by fishboat and
[3:42:26] I had been to that reservation where the
[3:42:28] Native Indians were and he was living in
[3:42:31] a little lean none of you people have
[3:42:35] had to live the way that poor man was
[3:42:38] living and in that State paralyzed so as
[3:42:42] soon as he said there's a man he's
[3:42:45] paralyzed I said oh that's brother Jacob
[3:42:47] and he's up at a hous it the man who's
[3:42:50] sitting right beside me we're all in the
[3:42:52] same
[3:42:55] place we're all born
[3:42:58] again we're all spiritual
[3:43:01] people and this other man and I are both
[3:43:05] preachers I'm a missionary to the Native
[3:43:08] Indians but we both come up with the
[3:43:10] wrong
[3:43:13] conclusion I said I thought he's up at
[3:43:16] that place in a
[3:43:17] haard and the man next to me
[3:43:20] said he's right here in this city
[3:43:23] because I visited him this
[3:43:26] morning and brother brandham has his
[3:43:28] back turned and he says the man is not
[3:43:31] in this
[3:43:33] city and he said the man is in a town
[3:43:37] just east of here called
[3:43:41] nanimo and you can look at it on the map
[3:43:45] that's exactly straight east of Port El
[3:43:48] Bernie on Vancouver Island and then he
[3:43:52] does this and he Wheels around said
[3:43:55] isn't that right Mike and point right to
[3:43:58] the man who is pulling for him to be
[3:44:01] healed I don't know any more than that
[3:44:04] and that except that man Mr Jacobs was
[3:44:08] moved that after
[3:44:10] afternoon from that
[3:44:12] City to a Indian Hospital in Nimo
[3:44:16] British Columbia now friends this isn't
[3:44:20] some hoax this isn't some dreamed up
[3:44:23] thing this is exactly what happened and
[3:44:27] I'm Duty bound to tell you as a living
[3:44:29] witness that's what happened and that's
[3:44:33] the kind of sign that came and that's
[3:44:35] the kind of God that just demonstrates
[3:44:37] himself not for brother
[3:44:40] Jacob's but that I can live this long
[3:44:44] and stand here at brother Cen burner's
[3:44:46] invitation and tell you people that God
[3:44:50] is still exactly the same that God who
[3:44:54] saw where he was moved that God saw you
[3:44:57] come to this meeting that God saw you
[3:45:00] drive or come by airplane or however
[3:45:03] that God knows exactly the condition
[3:45:06] that you're in at this very moment that
[3:45:09] God I'm taking a lot of time but I'm
[3:45:11] ending right now I am so thankful and I
[3:45:14] can tell you if I did not have the
[3:45:17] opportunity to be a living witness of
[3:45:20] what God has done in this day I say we

[3:50:29] embarrassed do not ask these
[3:50:33] people about what I'm going to
[3:50:38] say
[3:50:43] about 12,000 miles from
[3:50:46] here I was sitting in my
[3:50:50] home it was a Saturday
[3:50:55] morning and I was going to in I was in
[3:50:58] my study and I was just going to
[3:51:01] study and a voice a deep
[3:51:07] voice uh a voice that also was a
[3:51:11] Discerning
[3:51:13] voice I knew more than what I'm just
[3:51:15] going to say but it says I had opened up
[3:51:18] my
[3:51:20] computer and I have several emails that
[3:51:22] come during the night and the first one
[3:51:26] was a short
[3:51:29] one and I read about two
[3:51:32] lines and this voice came
[3:51:36] suddenly he said this is a wound wounded
[3:51:40] one and her husband doesn't know she has
[3:51:43] written
[3:51:44] this I would like that woman to
[3:51:50] stand that's the
[3:51:53] woman and just remain standing
[3:51:56] [Applause]

[3:52:01] from United States or someplace in
[3:52:03] Canada I didn't know where it's from and
[3:52:06] I could not tell from the address there
[3:52:08] was no address on it it was just a email
[3:52:12] address but didn't tell me where it's
[3:52:16] from and maybe two three weeks later
[3:52:19] would come another little short one said
[3:52:22] I streamed the service and it was a
[3:52:24] great blessing to
[3:52:25] me it from this
[3:52:30] woman now I was sitting in my office
[3:52:32] that
[3:52:35] place I have never talked to her about
[3:52:38] her her writing that I've never talked
[3:52:41] to her but that is what
[3:52:45] happened and a few weeks
[3:52:49] later I got a long
[3:52:52] email and when I saw it I thought
[3:52:55] oh this is there's a lot of detail here
[3:52:59] a lot of text and I just started to read
[3:53:02] the top two
[3:53:04] lines and the same
[3:53:06] voice and the same at atmosphere said
[3:53:10] these exact words now her husband
[3:53:14] knows and I'd like her husband to
[3:53:20] [Applause]
[3:53:28] stand and brother
[3:53:30] FASA sister Susan I want to express
[3:53:34] myself I may never have a chance to do
[3:53:35] this again I love you
[3:53:41] brother franois I I learned that these
[3:53:44] people were in
[3:53:46] Switzerland brother fris has been Pastor
[3:53:49] there for maybe 40 plus
[3:53:54] years and it was a puzzlement it was a
[3:53:57] puzzlement to
[3:53:59] everyone and then there was brother
[3:54:01] Daniel Ken
[3:54:06] Brer and Brother David
[3:54:09] mayor brother Jean Jock's
[3:54:14] son-in-law and we were in
[3:54:18] a
[3:54:20] uh my wife and I excuse me just a moment
[3:54:23] my wife and I were invited to come to
[3:54:27] Switzerland and we were way far I was on
[3:54:31] my way to
[3:54:32] Ukraine anybody here from the Ukraine
[3:54:34] from
[3:54:37] danet
[3:54:41] denk no one from
[3:54:45] dank and
[3:54:47] ala
[3:54:49] aloua there was a meeting in
[3:54:51] aloa across the Black
[3:54:54] Sea and so we were coming to
[3:54:58] Istanbul and there was 5
[3:55:01] days from that moment to the time the
[3:55:04] meeting was to start and I said well we
[3:55:07] must um
[3:55:09] this is the only chance we'll go to
[3:55:13] Switzerland and we flew back to
[3:55:15] Switzerland and these two people brother
[3:55:19] Jord and sister Angela picked us up at
[3:55:21] the airport we were like lost oldtime
[3:55:24] friends I never saw them they grab our
[3:55:27] suitcase and run off to their car and
[3:55:31] brother George driving the car out of
[3:55:33] Geneva about an hour and a half and into
[3:55:37] the to their house and they pull in
[3:55:39] you know God does strange things
[3:55:42] folks does very strange things and now
[3:55:46] we're from one place to another place
[3:55:48] and all I have is this this
[3:55:53] voice I'm coming to you in a few
[3:55:56] moments and brother Gerard takes our
[3:55:59] suitcases up to the bedroom and says
[3:56:03] just you know have a wash and refresh
[3:56:05] yourself and come down we'll have coffee
[3:56:08] and he closed the door and my wife is
[3:56:11] look standing there our suitcase is
[3:56:14] standing there and I'm standing here now
[3:56:17] I'm being honest with you I looked at my
[3:56:20] wife I said what are we doing
[3:56:27] here 5 days what are we doing here I
[3:56:32] never stay any place in a private home
[3:56:35] for 5
[3:56:37] days and we come to know these people
[3:56:39] didn't we met Jean jaac michelo Brother
[3:56:44] In the Flesh to brother
[3:56:47] Jord and his wife sister
[3:56:50] Marinette and then of course we knew the
[3:56:54] uh brother Fran and sister
[3:56:57] Susan and it was
[3:56:59] awkward and then they thought well maybe
[3:57:02] there's other people I only had that one
[3:57:06] thing this is a wounded one
[3:57:12] you might be here
[3:57:16] tonight and I don't know anything about
[3:57:20] sister
[3:57:21] Angela brother
[3:57:23] Gerard all I know is that someone spoke
[3:57:27] in my study 10 12,000 miles
[3:57:32] away I was in another place now my
[3:57:36] friends whoever that was that SP spoke
[3:57:38] to me I can tell you it's a voice a
[3:57:42] living voice I did not want you to hear
[3:57:45] my testimony and think oh this is like
[3:57:48] 50 60 years ago I'm talking about
[3:57:50] something that is is current something
[3:57:54] that's right now and I'm telling you
[3:57:57] that God is that God never
[3:58:01] sleeps that God never gets
[3:58:03] weary that God knows
[3:58:06] exactly what's in the deepest part of
[3:58:08] your heart that God knows your thoughts
[3:58:12] that God knows everything about your
[3:58:14] being he knows your background he knows
[3:58:18] where you came from and he knows where
[3:58:20] you're sitting at this
[3:58:22] moment he knows you're sitting here
[3:58:24] listening to me and all I can tell you
[3:58:26] is what I say to you is absolutely the
[3:58:29] truth this didn't come out of a book
[3:58:32] this didn't come out of a seminary this
[3:58:35] didn't come from any other special theme
[3:58:37] this is AB absolutely the truth and then
[3:58:40] it goes from one to another to another
[3:58:43] and they decided to have a a gathering
[3:58:47] there was 27 I told them don't tell
[3:58:51] anybody that I'm
[3:58:54] here and they said just our family just
[3:58:57] some of our family and friends and they
[3:59:00] had a dinner at their place and it was
[3:59:02] 27
[3:59:03] persons and
[3:59:05] then they said well maybe I can see
[3:59:09] there was a strain and there was a pull
[3:59:11] and such a desire to maybe get together
[3:59:15] just get together have a
[3:59:17] service and about a year
[3:59:24] later friends I want to tell you I'm a
[3:59:28] mute without this God I have nothing to
[3:59:32] offer nothing to offer these people this
[3:59:35] is not a special gift or a special
[3:59:37] person this is the person Jesus Christ
[3:59:41] we say that he's alive you should not be
[3:59:44] surprised I'm telling you things that
[3:59:46] declare he is
[3:59:51] alive do you believe
[3:59:56] that I'm trying to reach you just for a
[3:59:59] closing
[4:00:00] moment and then they and I I finally
[4:00:05] under a lot of strain and duress and
[4:00:10] brother colen brother I know what that
[4:00:12] strain
[4:00:15] is and that is why brother frosta see
[4:00:19] this isn't even preaching this is that's
[4:00:22] why I stood there and
[4:00:24] said brother F well you're a pastor here
[4:00:27] brother Jean Jack you have a group
[4:00:29] you've been pastoring this group and
[4:00:31] you're I I don't have any right to even
[4:00:34] be here I have no right to be here I
[4:00:37] don't have any position to be here I
[4:00:39] want to be
[4:00:42] honest and ab and about 120
[4:00:47] came I was still at
[4:00:49] home 10 12,000 miles away and God
[4:00:53] directs
[4:00:55] me to a place simply because of
[4:00:58] Geneva and I thought that your Prophet
[4:01:01] spoke on conference with
[4:01:04] God and I just became
[4:01:06] obsessed with
[4:01:09] W with an
[4:01:10] overwhelming you tell these people I
[4:01:14] have called this
[4:01:16] conference they are in a
[4:01:18] crisis and I have called them to this
[4:01:20] place because they're in a crisis
[4:01:24] friends I didn't know I don't know maybe
[4:01:27] you're sitting here and you look
[4:01:29] perfectly
[4:01:32] normal but maybe you're in a
[4:01:36] crisis and I know a god
[4:01:39] it isn't that you call for
[4:01:41] conference your Prophet said God calls a
[4:01:45] conference when there's a
[4:01:49] crisis and I say to the people of this
[4:01:52] audience and the people of this
[4:01:54] convention maybe 90% of the congregation
[4:01:58] just fine I don't know we can be ever so
[4:02:02] happy I don't
[4:02:04] know I know what conferences are
[4:02:08] I know when a person is desperate I know
[4:02:11] when a person needs an answer I was a
[4:02:14] happy young man I could you know I I
[4:02:18] could make humor and nobody would ever
[4:02:22] know what was going on inside ladies he
[4:02:26] knows he knows exactly what goes on
[4:02:29] inside you Brothers he knows exactly
[4:02:33] when you
[4:02:35] say I'm so empty
[4:02:39] is this all there is to
[4:02:41] it is this all there is we can believe
[4:02:44] this and we can you know and be stirred
[4:02:47] up and have our emotions all stirred but
[4:02:50] is this all there is to
[4:02:55] it and it seemed that there was other
[4:02:58] people so we had that
[4:03:01] Gathering brother colen Brunner you have
[4:03:04] a very deep respect for
[4:03:06] me you and your wife came
[4:03:10] and had had such an effect on
[4:03:13] me and then uh young men
[4:03:17] said the people are
[4:03:20] asking are we going to do this again
[4:03:22] next
[4:03:23] year and so that next year and next year
[4:03:26] there was maybe 240 and the next year
[4:03:29] I'm not talking about numbers now I'm
[4:03:30] not interested in numbers I don't care
[4:03:32] if it went down to
[4:03:34] 10 but when there was
[4:03:37] 240 there more wounded
[4:03:40] people more hungry people they weren't
[4:03:44] necessarily all wounded but there are
[4:03:46] many that are
[4:03:49] wounded
[4:03:51] friends I'm just going to stop for a
[4:03:54] moment there were times in my life when
[4:03:58] I just didn't feel right I didn't feel
[4:04:01] physically right but I didn't know what
[4:04:03] was wrong with
[4:04:04] me but I would go to a physical doctor
[4:04:09] and
[4:04:09] say can I just describe something to
[4:04:13] you my doctor
[4:04:16] said uh Mr bisco what can I do for you I
[4:04:19] said I don't know I said that's
[4:04:21] positive I said I don't know what's
[4:04:23] wrong can I describe something to you
[4:04:27] and I described what I was going through
[4:04:30] he knew exactly what I was it took
[4:04:33] somebody and now I can tell you about it
[4:04:37] you might be able to play play the part
[4:04:38] and not you're not acting you're genuine
[4:04:41] you're Believers I was a Believer I
[4:04:44] believed with all my heart and soul I
[4:04:47] believed in the spontaneous things and
[4:04:50] friends take this right please I have
[4:04:53] seen the demonstration of the holy
[4:04:56] spirit in the in the congregation such
[4:05:00] as I have never seen in the message
[4:05:03] yet but I never have had the voice speak
[4:05:08] and say precisely a certain thing and
[4:05:12] then listen to that voice and find out
[4:05:15] it goes from that to another year to
[4:05:18] another year and I feel as though I'm
[4:05:20] just
[4:05:22] writing and there's lots of room for
[4:05:25] misunderstanding and God knew
[4:05:28] that and God help me please to just
[4:05:31] finish this by saying this out of
[4:05:36] that brother home
[4:05:40] Runner that's why we've
[4:05:44] come you were so warm and friendly and
[4:05:48] kind and spiritual and when I got your
[4:05:51] email and said I desire this meeting and
[4:05:55] walls will go down and the Holy Spirit
[4:05:58] will just come and the love of God will
[4:06:02] prevail that was this man's desire and
[4:06:05] that's why I've come
[4:06:19] God bless you brother Tim
[4:06:22] Phil brother Tim I'm so happy that
[4:06:25] you're
[4:06:28] here and if I never live to
[4:06:33] see and I'm so happy that you're
[4:06:36] here
[4:06:39] friends we're not complimenting one
[4:06:42] another these are men of God I want to
[4:06:45] say to this
[4:06:46] congregation and all you pastors that
[4:06:48] are here God knows what he's doing and
[4:06:51] whenever I I struggle today over what I
[4:06:55] would say and how far I shall go and I
[4:06:57] went back I went back brother brandham
[4:07:01] sometimes tells about something that
[4:07:03] happened and he talks about it like it
[4:07:05] happened yesterday and it's maybe 20 and
[4:07:07] 30 years ago God's the same the god that
[4:07:11] spoke 20 30 years ago is the same God
[4:07:14] that speaks 5 minutes ago or five
[4:07:16] minutes ahead he's the same
[4:07:19] God and when I came here to speak to you
[4:07:22] friends I heard one thing this is a
[4:07:25] wounded
[4:07:26] one and her husband doesn't know she's
[4:07:29] written this I go back I'm just one man
