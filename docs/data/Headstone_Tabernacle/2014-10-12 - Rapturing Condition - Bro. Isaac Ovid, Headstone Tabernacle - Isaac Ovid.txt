and the church says and the church says amen and amen and amen you may be seated for a few minutes a few minutes this morning amen so on behalf of our pastor brother oban and his wife sister ann marie i'd like to welcome you this morning and to the house of the lord this morning i'd also like to greet you on behalf of my wife and it's truly an honor to stand before the purchase of the blood of jesus christ i do want to send special greetings to those who are connected live on the internet and wherever this tape may be played amen so before we get started this morning i want to salute by the anthony for the message last week who is this uncircumcised philistine your pre-shipping anthony amen and i want to really salute brother kangale by the george kangli for his words before the prayer meeting on thursday night if you missed it you missed one of the greatest prayer meetings i've ever been in in my life there was such a super anointing and brother branham said one day the right words would be spoken my brother george was speaking the right words on thursday night because the holy spirit just swept right into the building and took complete control so god bless you by the kangaroo and may god continue to inspire you use you and raise you up for the kingdom of god amen and we had a special time in the youth service last night but anthony took care of the youth service and it was really a tremendous blessing so this morning our pastor brother ovid is speaking in pennsylvania to a small group of believers who have been connected to us on the internet from new york indiana and pennsylvania he also spoke last night and a few of our believers went with him so we want to remember them all in prayer they're in service right now and for traveling mercies to their various homes and brotherhood will be back this weekend he said he's going to be preaching next sunday so be on the expectation and remember him in prayer that god would strengthen him and last weekend he was in punjab india and he gave me a brief report to give to the church and initially they had expected about 500 people and about 10 or so ministers to be there but it ended up being about 800 plus people and about 25 ministers came and uh initially some other brothers were supposed to go as well but that didn't work out so it was six services one of the brothers over there he opened up and brother will preach the next five messages so certainly we want to continue to remember him and pray and his five messages were the prophetic vision then he spoke on the word bride then he spoke on the lamb's book then he spoke on the inheritance divided and then he spoke on the final voice and india exploded india is rejoicing india is in revival india is under great expectation india will never be the same again can the church say man amen so when we receive the dvds we will certainly make them available on our website and on our youtube channel and ones are available we're going to notify you via our facebook page so we are in revival this morning amen so i really want to thank beloved for the privilege and opportunity to speak this morning it is by no means an easy task and it is a i can i counted a sacred responsibility especially in such a time as this so before i get to the world just for a few announcements this tuesday we will be by brother mike thompson for service at his house so those in the west you're welcome to join us and uh this wednesday we will be in canopia by brother andy and sister vicky for service at their house so if you're in the central surgeons area you're welcome to join us there as well and service continues on thursday at 8 and sunday at 10 come under expectation amen so are you ready for the word this morning all right let's just stand to our feet this morning and before we read the scripture let's just sing that song we have come into his house we have come into his house to worship him hallelujah we have come into his house gathered in his name to worship foreign let's just sing that one more time with your hands lifted oh we have come into his house gathered in his name to worship him that's the reason we came this morning we have come into his house gavin in his name to worship him oh we have come into his house gathered in his name to worship christ let's just sing it like this so let's forget about ourselves concentrate on him and worship him let's forget about ourselves concentrate on him and worship him let's forget about ourselves concentrate on him and worship christ the lord worship him worship christ the lord give the lord a hand of praise amen hallelujah amen thank you musicians shall we take our bibles this morning we're going to read from three portions of scripture we're going to go to the book of deuteronomy we're going to read from first corinthians and we're going to read from 2nd corinthians this morning and deuteronomy 29 and we're going to read verse 29 this morning deuteronomy 29 29 and the bible says the secret things belong to the lord our god but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children forever that we may do all the words of this law and reading from first corinthians 15 first corinthians 15 51 behold i show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed and reading from second corinthians 13 reading verse 5. second corinthians 13 and reading verse 5. listen carefully examine yourselves whether ye be in the faith prove your own selves knowing not your own selves how that jesus christ is in you except ye be reprobates i don't want to read this same scripture but i want to read it in the amplified just to expand on it a bit and in the amplified it says examine and test and evaluate your own selves to see whether you are holding to your feet and showing the proper fruits of it test and prove yourselves not christ do you not yourselves realize and know thoroughly by and ever increasing experience that jesus christ is in you unless you are counterfeits disapproved on trial and rejected may the lord have a blessing to the reading of his word shall we pray this morning our gracious heavenly father we thank you for lord the presence of the holy spirit that's already here lord and any man can read the scriptures but it takes the holy spirit to bring it alive father may you take me completely out of the way this morning and speak to the purchase of the blood of jesus christ i'm unworthy to stand behind this desk lord father they are your people this morning lord may you speak lip to ear to them father and bring great transformation in the house of god father bless the reading of the word and bless the hearing of it in the precious theme of jesus christ you may be seated in the presence of the lord this morning amen amen can the church say amen so whether branham said it's the atmosphere that brings the results so it's up to you to be in that atmosphere the minister is not supposed to bring the atmosphere because that atmosphere is that revival atmosphere you are supposed to bring that atmosphere kind of church say man because when you want to shape iron you got to put some heat on it because when the heat there then you could take the hammer and hit the iron but if there's no heat that iron can't move no way so we want to put some fire in the service this morning so the iron could be moved and shaped this morning so you love the lord this morning so i have a title this morning rapturing condition rapturing condition my subject reality check are you ready and an inspiration let every man examine himself so it's a message friends to shake the church it's a message to prod the church it's a message to provoke the church and i'm going to build a bit of a background on on december the 24th 1965 but the brandon went on to be with the lord unknown unrecognized and unacknowledged by the world at large outside the ministry of christ the greatest prophet that the world had ever seen had silently slipped away names such as abraham moses noah david daniel and elijah had long been established as necessary actors in god's drama but this time was different this name was not to be written on buildings universities and schools of theology the ministry of this great prophet malachi 4 this great elijah was different amen as god unfolded the story of his life through three polls there was a great purpose for this prophet because this prophet was to deliver a seven seal seven thunder message to prepare and elect omega world bride for the rapture for the wedding supper and for the millennium god has always had an order god will never break his order and the word of the lord has always come to the prophets somebody say amen amos 3 7 says surely the lord god will do nothing but he revealed his secret unto his servants or prophets church kings were made subject to the prophets the high priest was made subject to the prophet the levites were made subject to the prophet those who went to war were made subject to the prophet can the church say man this morning is going to be a little different this morning is going to be a little different in second kings 6 the king of syria the bible says war against israel and he took counsel the bible says and said in such and such a place i'm going to attack the israelites but for some reason where we try to attack elisha the prophet told the king of israel don't go down there because they are waiting for you over there when there's a prophet in the land it's a different situation can the church say man you maybe see that the word of the prophet would stand until the next prophet came along so i ask you a question this morning headstone tabernacle is this age to be any different because according to my bible there is no other major prophet to come there will be no other ministry like the ministry of brother branham there will be no other ministry like that great prophet that great elijah somebody's saying man we're back to school this morning because you got to know your history you got to know who you are you got to know who god is you got to know who the devil is when brother branham spoke it was not a man speaking when brother branham spoke it was the son of man veiled in a son of man can the church say amen oh this is the background i'm going to preach in a little while don't worry in the message laodicean church age no wonder brother branham said yes listen to the authenticated prophet of god who appears in this last age what he sells from god the bride will say the spirit and the prophet and the bride will be saying the same thing and what they say will have already been said in the world can the church say man so this morning we are back to the bible because what is said and why i'm against organized religion he said the holy spirit today the manifestation of the holy spirit is that angel trying to get the people back to the word and back to the word means back to the bible can the church say amen because the bible has always been a sealed book without the message of yahweh the bible is close to you can the church say amen the bible is close to the pentecostals the bible is close to the baptist the bible is closed to the methodist the bible is closed the td checks the bible is closed the very end the bible is close to them the bible is close to those in the message who don't dig deep enough in the prophet's message to pull up the hidden mysteries already revealed by malachi 4. somebody say amen this morning we're in the word this morning amen i always say we're going to have a real church or no church at all but the church must be based on the word somebody's saying man malachi 4 revealed many things he saw the siege that spoke of los angeles sinking isn't that right he spoke all the seeds of things that were to unfold he sold seed to tie up all the loose ends reveal every mystery but there was some special seeds that he sold for the pride body los angeles that's not my seed because i don't want to be here the tribulation that's not my seed i don't want to go to the tribulation but there's some bright seeds that belong to me and those things which are revealed they belong to us and they belong to our children and you can't take it from me i have a revelation this morning and you have a revelation also somebody say man glory to god you may be seated that's why brother branham said in the message spoken word original seed you see now why i've been so zealous of the kind of seed that i planted for the body he's speaking specific to the body because the rain is going to fall pretty soon i mean the real rain can a church say a man and it's got to have sea to fall on he said i hope i live to see it can the church see man so this morning i'm speaking about seeds for the bride body you could have been in any kind of church this morning you could have been in any message this morning but this morning we are speaking about seeds for the bride body it's good to know about the tribulation and the plagues and the wolves and serpent seed it's good and all of that but i have no plans to be in the tribulation can the church say amen i want to be in a rapturing condition there's coming a rapture there's coming a secret movement of the church and the church say man and you better be ready let every man examine himself this morning this morning i won the seeds i want the promises i want the word that the bride must produce i'm not going to be long with you this morning but i want you to shake this morning to get into action hallelujah and this morning those things which are revealed they belong unto us you have got to know it belongs to you you got to know you're not just coming to church you've got to know you're not just in the message you've got to know you're not just trying to be a christian you got to know that you are born to produce something you are born to produce the same life the same signs the same wonders the same miracles i don't care what the devil said to you this morning i don't care how we came at you last night you are born for such a time as this let the church see amen you may be seated friends you're not going to get anything if you're not in the spirit hallelujah the world is in their spirit they're in the spirit of all that's going on the biggest discussion in trinidad is if they're going to cancel carnival headline news to cancel or not to cancel what a predicament what a situation what a crisis imagine that's taking up people's time when there's a tribulation coming when there's judgment coming when there's a rapture coming too many people are sitting out in church and they have lost the burden to realize that we're not going to be here forever and that any day now this thing is going to change before our very eyes people are happy to sit in the message and think because they're in the message it automatically means they are going to the rapture if that's been preached to you that is alive being in the message doesn't put you in the rapture to be in the rapture you must be in a rapturing condition there must be something on the inside inside inside you maybe see them but the brandon said when the rapture takes place it'll be so humble it'll be so simple you're hardly gonna even realize it so i asked a question this morning if this whole church goes into the rapture i think they're going to realize it i'm shaking you this morning so i'm going to challenge you but they brought to the rapture is a small group of people i hate to tell it to you but some people are not gonna make it people are sitting uncomfortable in the message they're not gonna make it because you're not gonna make it if you're not in a rapturing condition hallelujah this is not about the preacher this is not about the church this is not about who your pastor is it's are you ready for the rapture this morning you may be seated your job cannot be more important than preparing for the rapture your school cannot be more important than preparing for the rapture because when the branham said you maybe she said just as in noah's day the earth was destined for the flood just time for destruction what about our day but the branham said the world is headed for funeral service fire is gonna burn this world what will your degree do your degree can protect you from the fire your boyfriend can't protect you from the fire your neighbor can't protect you from the fire your boss cannot protect you from the fire shake yourselves in here this morning and get into rapturing condition you may be seated because if you are not in rapture and condition you are heading straight for the tribulation and for those who hear this message you may be seated for those who are in the church they are who was called a remnant those who were exposed to the truth and did not get into condition and the word says that when the rapture takes place the beast will be so angry he will hunt the remnant you don't think the devil knows your name you don't think the devil knows you're a dress you don't think the devil knows where you work and you want to play church and play games wake up in here this morning hallelujah hallelujah you may be seated for some of you in here there's the final warning but the planets have to reject the word of your day is to cross the line it's to cross the line and when you cross that line there is no coming back god will only give mercy mercy mercy but after a while it switches to judgment but people want to sit in the message talk about my group and my pastor and my church well this morning it's not about the church it's not about the pastor is let every man examine himself you can't blame your husband you cannot blame your wife you cannot blame your children let every man examine himself and see if you measure up to what peter branham said is rapturing condition we're gonna make heaven high and hell hot this is not a pentecostal church this is not a metadata church it's not a catholic church this is the house of god and the angel of the lord the one with the swept back wings he is here this morning you may be seated i don't know how foul getting this message tomorrow how pal gets into this message i have 14 pages joseph 14 year prophecy i don't know i don't know how far i'm gonna go this morning but you wanna break into crying and sighing that's all right because i'm gonna talk about that later on but i challenge you this morning don't you leave this church the same way that you came don't watch this tape and go back and do the same thing that you were doing before it's a time of reckoning it's a time of transformation it's a time of change and this can be your last chance to hear the word of the lord this morning those things which are revealed they belong to us and to our children there's a prophecy over your children this morning i don't care what condition they might be in there's a prophecy over them this morning hallelujah hallelujah so mother father be encouraged be encouraged this morning god knows their name he knows their name this morning he knows where they are right now and at the right season god is going to bring the handcuffs of the spirit and arrest them take them against their will and say listen sister had you right i give you your two boys hallelujah you may be seated this morning so brother bannon revealed that there's a power coming into the church and people always ask the question well where is the power what happened to the power the bottom line is this god is not going to hand his power to children most of the crime that exists today is young children 12 year olds teenagers with guns most of the robberies take place with children between the ages of 12 and 19 because they are children they have not lived long enough to appreciate how hard it is to get certain things and because they don't know the toil and the sweat of acquiring certain things they push themselves to limits and extremes because they don't want to take the sacrifice and the discipline the gun puts power in their hands to do certain things a 16 year old feels powerful when he has a gun in his hand his mother can't talk to him his father can talk to him he goes to school with it he walked a street with it and nobody could talk to him that's power without character amen satanic when we have people in the message who won't shake your hands how could god pour the power out because the power we need is power not just to heal and not just to do this it's power to transform to change this mortal to immortality that's real power that's not a play game power that's real power so god has to wait until some sons and daughters come to maturity because when you are mature you think differently you speak differently you conduct yourself differently if you have a two-year-old child and a two-year-old child breaks something you don't get in a fight and say i'm gonna fight you wanna meet outside and fight no he's two years old he doesn't know what happened amen he's not mature but as he grows older you expect him to get more mature so in the early stages of your christian experiences there were a lot of stuff you broke and god has had to shake you here and tap you here and say don't do that anymore don't do that anymore come on grow up you're not going to be a child all the time you're not going to lack understanding all the time paul said it like this when i was a child i speak as a child i understood as a child but when i became a man i put away the childish things so god had to send some of us through fiery trials interrupt our lives send us into situations to force us to get mature listen it's impossible to get mature in a bed of ease when everything is all right even jesus had to learn obedience by the things he suffered so if jesus had to suffer you think god gonna make it easy for you i like you nice suit no you're gonna have to suffer but at the end of it you're gonna be a mature son you're gonna be a seasoned son you're gonna be a tried son you're gonna be a proven son can the church say man brother kangli that was not in my notes so we are on to page 15 now amen so malachi 4 revealed many things there's a power coming into the church there'll be a manifestation of the sons of god by and through the bride will be fulfilled all there'll be an omega word bride with same signs wonders and miracles like the alpha church once more the world will hear direct from god there will be an ephesians 4 ministry all with the baptism of the holy ghost there will be a perfect church there will be a church with jesus christ walking in it there will be a church where sin cannot stay in it malachi 4 revealed that seven thunders is the prize revival he revealed that rapturing faith is laying in the message he revealed the same jesus who healed the sick raised the dead made the lame walk made the dumb talk walked on water and fed five thousand that same jesus will be veiling a people come on headstone tabernacle i'm not talking about any people i'm talking about you this morning hallelujah the great mystery that's been hit christ in you the hope of glory malachi 4 reveal is going to be a rapture it's going to be a resurrection there's going to be a wedding supper there's destruction coming this world is destined to be destroyed the bible says heaven and earth will pass away but my word will never pass away and what is revealed friends it belongs to us god promised certain things to us and he is obligated to do it or he is going to be called a liar and my god is not a liar whatever he said he is going to do somebody say man you may be seated listen friends the bride will not be deceived cannot be deceived she will not accept a substitute she will not accept a counterfeit she will not accept come the church shake my hands pay a tithe go home that's not it the bride will only accept rapturing condition and you want to tell me i can't shout i can't jump hallelujah i don't even need to have music in my ass to dance anymore i can dance all the time hallelujah why i'm in the spirit of the coming of the lord he's coming for me he is coming for me and his wife had made herself ready i'm getting ready this morning are you ready this morning are you ready this morning let me get back to my notes a bit so how are we feeling this morning everybody with me we're on a journey this morning hallelujah you know what the brandon said when the power come it won't last long but it'll be here he said gonna move overnight you know the rapture could just take place a day from now a week from now you don't even know and all your stress your mortgage is trying to figure out how you're gonna make the next mortgage bill that's not your problem to worry about that'll be the mortgage company because you're not going to be here they could search for you they could hire the beer leaf to find you they could put your name in the newspaper missing missing missing we can't find him anywhere where is he at they don't even know you come from god and you're going back to god you just passing through time to smile at the devil and say satan i'm not going to be deceived i'm not going to miss my inheritance i'm not going to miss my blessing you may be seated man i wonder how enoch felt one day he was just walking in the back and said it just didn't find him anymore brother i want to take that kind of walk where i could just walk and he don't find me anymore and i'll be with god i'll be with abraham i'll be with moses fellowship and how we made it in 2014. you may be seated hallelujah recently the history channel said they believe enoch was from a different planet i said duh you just figured that out he come from god he's going back to god just like you and me i'm not from this planet we are pilgrims passing through time i know who my father is i know where i come from i know where i'm going you may be seated i don't know why the history channel don't come to us the prophet already reveal every mystery they're trying to discover this research this archaeological fine we have the archaeological finds right here with malachi pro already brought every mystery from genesis to revelation we know what happened we know where we come from you may be seated but if branham told us enoch built the pyramids he's still trying to figure out who built the pyramids you are such a blessed people this morning and you want to tell me i can't shout i can worship hallelujah we are back to the bible this morning it is only through the prophetic message of the seventh angel that we could truly go back to the bible why because revelation 10 7 says but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets so the ministry of that elijah malachi seen luke 17 30. revelation 10 7 the seventh angel was to gather all the scattered word and tie up all the loose ends as a seven thunder seven seal message so that an elected bride can come to perfection adoption and go into the rapture that's a mouthful listen to the tape again but behold i show you a mystery this morning we shall not all sleep hallelujah some of us will sleep but we shall not all sleep but abraham he wanted to go to the rapture but he had to fall asleep but we shall not all sleep hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah and those that are asleep they are waiting for us to come into rapturing condition what a jubilee what a blessed peace hallelujah breaking from time into eternity you may be seated the rapture will be a defining moment brother branham said jesus would be the showdown between denomination and creed for he will come to back up his word and take his pride in the rapture in the eternal mind of god as he looks at time time is divided into two categories before the rapture and after the rapture before the rapture is a time of preparation for the rapture there can be no wedding supper unless there's a rapture there could be no tribulation unless there is a rapture so this rapture is a defining moment in time whether it is to one person this morning or a thousand people the message is still the same church get ready for the rapture friends let us not lose the focus of why god sent william mariam branham the purpose of the evening time message is to bring the bride into rapturing condition listen to the prophet in the message of the first seal he said at the end of the pentecostal age we are supposed to receive according to the word as god help me tonight to show you there we are to receive a messenger that will take all those loose ends out there and reveal the whole secret of god for the rapturing of the church so friends we must be in rapturing condition not church condition not message condition but rapturing condition the fact that you are here this morning is evidence that this message gathered you but the question is are you ready and this morning i say let every man examine himself i just want to place three quotes before i hit the next part of my text this morning but i ran him in the first seal seven thunders of revelation may he show the bride how to prepare for the great translation faith and is this the sign of the end server the random said where are we at sis what's all of this about i'm asking the other angels was messengers men of the year but this angel said to the angel of the church of laodicea to the angel of the church of ephesus the messengers of the earth see men messengers prophets and so forth to the church but this one didn't come from earth he come down from heaven because the mystery is all finished and when the mystery is finished the angel said time shall be no more and seven thunders throw their voices out what if it is something to let us know how to enter into the rapturing fate will we run a leap of a wall is there something fixing to happen and these all mod vile bodies are going to be changed can i live to see it oh lord is it so close that i'll see it is this the generation serves my brethren what time is it where are we at that's the prophet crying out last quote in united time and signed by the brandon said god is uniting his bride she is coming together from the east and the west and the north and the south there is a uniting time and that's on right now but the band said what is she uniting for the rapture amen god's getting her ready yes sir uniting what is she uniting with with other churches with other ministers no with the word for all heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall never pass away she is uniting herself with thus saith the lord regardless of what any denomination or anybody else says she is uniting herself she is getting ready why she is the bride that's right can the church say amen give the lord a hand of praise this morning let me coast a little bit is there anybody here this morning wants to go to the rapture anybody want to leave this whole filthy world behind leave the styles leave the hallelujah leave the sickness and the back pain and the problems hallelujah rapturing condition friends we're in a space academy this morning we're getting ready for the rapture friends we are preparing to defy gravity amen the law of gravity says what goes up must come down the law of gravity says there's a magnetic force that pulls objects to the center of the earth the law of gravity says you're not leaving here listen to the bro listen to what brother branham says do you know when you raise your hand you defy every law of science do you know your hands supposed to hang down gravitation holds it to the ground but do you know when you raise your hands up it shows that there's something supernatural in you has made a decision something that's not natural something that's not scientific it's a spirit that's in you has made you break gravitation by a supernatural being hallelujah is that why we say worship we defy gravity when you praise god when you stand to your feet when you lift your hands up you are defying gravity somebody give god worship this morning the law of gravity you may be seen in jehovah jaira but the random said and they raise their hands and stood in their feet defying the law of gravity that there's a life in there so do we defy the law of the world and unbelief so when you begin to worship you begin to defy the law of the world and all the unbelief can the church say man i feel like preaching now but but it was my background is over it's time for us to get to rapturing condition this morning you may be seated so the devil is one of the greatest lawyers one of the greatest lawyers the devil is a great lawyer he knows the law he's a chief prosecutor revelation 12 calls him the accuser of the brethren somebody help me this morning but i'm so happy that we also have a lawyer that has never lost a case every time the devil accuses you somehow the judge says not guilty not guilty not guilty you have defied the law to be here this morning somebody help me preach hallelujah hallelujah somebody's shaming hallelujah my god has never lost a case every time why because it's a higher law there is a higher law to go to the rapture you need to tap into a higher law how do we know there's a higher law easter proved it's a higher law because jesus was supposed to stay at 10. but if you look into the grave if you look into the tumor he is not there he defied that law oh somebody help me preach this morning hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah and the law says because you fell in sin you'll finish but i'm here to tell you there's a higher law this morning the law says because you're fornicated you're over but there's a higher law this morning the law says because your backslid you're over but it's a higher law this morning and this higher law will take me to the rapture this higher law will take me to the resurrection this higher law will take me to the wedding supper hallelujah you may be seated hallelujah the law says you did this the law said you did that the law said you made this make the devil accusing you what you did last night what you did yesterday what he did last month but here comes jesus that's in jesus you may be seated one time they brought a woman to jesus they say jesus this woman was caught in the very act of adultery this was not on a blog this was not on instagram it was not on facebook she was caught in the very act there is no mistake about it we know she did it and the law says we should stone up jesus without saying words at first he's like i know there's a higher law somewhere he turned around to them he said you have no sin cast the first stone that's when you know in in in in the courtroom there's some lawyers who are so good when you see the law passing like whoa i never thought of that and there it is jesus he broke into higher law he says you who have no sin cast the first stone and one by one that higher law began to make all those pharisees say you know what when i look into the mirror and examine myself when i examine myself i don't measure up to take this tone and throw at anybody else i got my own problems i got my own situation i got my own faults i got my own mistakes i messed up all by myself you may be seated as a hidden mystery jesus was teaching them don't judge anybody examine yourself god is the judge i have to jesus looked around and said woman where are then accusers they were not around and jesus said to her neither do i condemn you go and sin no more your case is dismissed your record is clean it's not a sealed record this record has been thrown into the sea of forgetfulness nobody can even unseal this it's thrown away nobody can ever find it i wipe your sin away hallelujah church come up hither there's a higher lord this morning when the doctor says there's no hope for you there's a higher law this morning when the friends give up on you there's a higher law this morning when your marriage is about to break there's a higher law this morning when you feel like giving up there's a higher law this morning when you want to walk out to church there's a higher law this morning you may be stealing when your family thinks you could never change there's a higher law this morning when your friends expect you to give up there's a higher law this morning when you can't pay the bills there's a higher law this morning when you have no food there's a higher law when judgment is about to strike there's a higher law that will take you to the rapture you may be seated i trust this message shakes you this morning wakes you up this morning we're in a space academy this morning brother branham delivered the curriculum and the holy spirit is a tutor the holy spirit will determine who graduates from this class in other words the holy spirit determines who is adopted the holy spirit watches your behavior and conduct the holy spirit wants to see if you would apply the token the holy spirit wants to see if you could die out seven deaths for seven birds we're in a space academy this morning and to enter this academy you need faith and when you're in the academy you begin to add to that fate virtue and knowledge and temperance and patience and godliness and brotherly kindness and then charity seals you and puts you in rapturing conditions this message is so simple what is rapturing conditions let every man examine himself do i look like that do i walk like that do i talk like that and if you don't have this we need to press until we have this but the brandon brought the curriculum we norman what material we're supposed to have preach become the ministers are supposed to rightly divide the word the curriculum and once it's rightly divided now it's up to you to climb because the pastor cannot graduate for you the minister cannot graduate for you i can graduate in your class for you it's either you graduate or you don't graduate the pastor cannot be adopted for you he cannot be perfected for you so you can't just sit into it and say well i like my pastor that's the word you have to climb you have to add to your faith let every man examine himself this morning what did enoch do he showed us in type how god prepares you for the rapture faith virtue knowledge temperance patience colonies broadly kindness that's how enoch went knew what was inside of him so he testified to the world this is how i went out of here and he built the pyramid and left it for the world as a testimony and malachi 4 revealed the revelation in our day how to get out of here by the word again which is the pyramid and god right under the nose of satan and in the face of fourth anointed one in spite of the world and your trials and your tribulations and your testings and your ups and downs he's building another pyramid in your heart this morning and we are getting ready for the rapture we might make mistakes friends because we are humans and this body is human so that's why god put a blood atonement for our mistakes so when he looks down at us he looks through the blood and he sees you perfect he hears the voice of the blood and the blood is speaking for you this morning and god is looking down at you and seeing seven virtues be informed in you i can't no devil stop it friends to go in the rapture you must be in rapturing condition you can be raptured the way you are you've got to be trained but a man i'm in a message perfect faith i'm not going to be too much longer with you so when a man lives by faith and walks by faith i mean substance faith he is isolated from the entire world and becomes a new creature in christ there now you're getting into bright material see you're getting into rapturing condition now that means for every one of us for each one of us not just the pastor deacon's trustees that means with a laity every individual walks in a world with god alone you're baptized into this kingdom and there's nobody in there but you and god amen in the message christ is the mystery of god reveal that's about three quotes now what are you going to do everybody with me this morning now what are you going to do when you get all that group together where the revelation is perfectly in harmony and god expressing it through his word by the same actions the same thing that he did making the word manifest oh if the church only knew its position it will one day then the rapture will go when she knows what it is in the message the rapture but brother branham said but to the church the pride the rapture is a revelation to her it's revealed to us that the revelation the true bride of christ will be waiting for that revelation of the rapture hallelujah friends if you want to go to space if you want to go on a spaceship you got to go through some kind of training the astronauts spend a long time getting prepared to go into space because space is a different atmosphere it's a different environment you can walk the same way in space like you walk on earth because on earth you are subject to gravity but when you go to space your body begins to move a little differently you begin to float you can't just drink out of a cup because if you pour like this the water just going to float in the air so you have to go into a zero gravity chamber and we're gonna get some experience with the atmosphere of what you're gonna go into and if you realize that in this simulation you can't perform in that simulated environment you're not ready for the real thing so this simulated environment is to work the kings out to work the problems out until you get comfortable and only when you pass this simulation you're qualified to go on to the real thing so that's why brahms said it takes love to get you there so in this atmosphere this environment rapture and condition means you could handle whatever condition exists over there so it means in this simulation you've got to learn how to forgive you got to learn how to love you gotta learn to drop your hearts you gotta learn to shake your brother hannah you gotta look anybody with me this morning is this a word or is this not the word this morning you can't be trying to get a rapturing condition and still trying to figure out how close to your knee you want to cut the skirt because that can't work over there in this simulation you got to work all the kings out you can listen to worldly music over there so why are you listening to it in the simulation we're trying to get into rapturing condition you can't have a whirly boyfriend over there so how could you have it in the simulation you can be cursing out the neighbor over there so why are you cursing over here you're going to spend a lot of time in the simulation and after a while if you go into flight school and you just keep feeling the simulation they say you know what next consistency we in space academy we have two disciplines suspension and expulsion some people on suspension right now because they haven't behaved themselves suspended when god discipline you and exposing is when you cross the line and god say you know what this flight is not for you you still want a whole lot and that's why two weeks ago i spoke about the word test because the simulation is where you have the word test because only the word itself can go over there no interpretation could go over there no hybrid could go over there only the pure word could go over there so god will test you and god can't test you god can't tell you the exam in advance and say this is intestinal this is an example again tomorrow look the exam has to come in a way that you need to whoo is this the christ what did the prophet say about this and that should be your mood always i was fellowshipping with one of my friends in nigeria and we were fellowshipping on the wood and he kept asking where did brother branham say it where'd he put it i'm saying i said that's how it's supposed to be and i said to him he yeah he asked me a question he's like i don't know the answer i need to check what brother branham said because i don't want to speculate because i want to pass the word test if i speculate why did god send the prophet the prophet came so that we don't have any speculation in the message i don't know if it is maybe it is maybe this is this is no room for maybe it's a rapture and i'm not trusting my rapture experiencing anybody who are you going to blame when you miss the rapture and you are standing in the tribulation that's why i let every man examine himself i wrote in my notes not only will the beast be looking for the remnants you know the remnant will be looking for the ministers who deceive them amen that's why i challenge you let every man examine himself i'm not taking chances with the rapture you must be in rapturing condition those whirly magazines can't be over there why do you have them here those filthy movies can be over there why do you have them here that hairstyle can't work over there why do you have it here over there you're always in the world you always praising god over here you want to come to church and that's it that's your quarter for the week over there they're always shouting and praising it in case you didn't know it's eternal shouting and worship so you might as well get in the atmosphere now i can't tell you don't work because by the sweat of your brow you're supposed to eat but i challenge young people always you have to make a choice with what job you take because you cannot tell god i missed the rapture because i had to work on sundays and i didn't add the word food value for the spirit to unite with that word in me so i'm missing every other sunday or missing three sundays a month because of work let every man examine himself if your job jeopardizes you go into the rapture you need to change your job if the friends you have are jeopardizing you go into the raptor you need to change your friends because you cannot compromise with going to the rapture though i know mysteries and speak with tongs and have all knowledge and don't have charity i'm nothing there are people who will have knowledge mysteries and feed the poor and still miss the rapture you have to have charity you have to have dynamics you have to have the person of christ the statue of a man of a perfect man must be in you you must be a reflection of jesus christ there is no compromise there's no middle ground you know god says either your heart or your cold either you go to the rapture or you're seeing any tribulation there's no middle ground i'll spew you out of my mouth friends think about it in the message that will come a day people will come to church and they will not have realized that the rapture took place i don't plan to be here i don't know who can be ushering i don't know who what type of service that's going to be but it's going to vary a very depressing service it's not funny it's the reality of the situation because that's what we're heading for but you see the problem today is people don't take god seriously because if you did you will change your behavior because the boss on your job tell you that if you come to work late three times you make sure you're not late if you miss if you come late three times you lose your job you have a certain attitude because you know there's consequences but we think god is just allowing things to happen and watching you in your foolishness when the word has come for us to grow and be formed into the word image how many times do you have to tell you leave the worldly boy leave the world gear leave the worldly music don't cut your hair wear dressed properly you're not supposed to have work clothes and church clothes this length dislike disliked what is that that is rapturing condition this is one for churches the one for work it's two different outfits look in your closet you're shocked friends i'm speaking plainly because we're trying to get a rapturing condition when the prophet says sisters don't cut your ear that's the word there's no compromise when you hear jesus said do you hear justin what you blame me here jesus for you missing rapture is this the word or is this not the word only the truth will set you free you have to stand for the word god will only recognize the word god will only back the word up you know you're close that's supposed to be tight why is it tight we're trying to be in what rapturing condition i don't care what the world says the world by the branham said it's atomic father that's the material that the bomb is going to explode that's a harsh thing to say but is the truth you trying to go to the rapture and you're experimenting with makeup there's no makeup over there you know what brother branham called jezebel the high priest of makeup brother branham called her dog meat because the dogs ate ate her up no dog meat is going to the rapture but isaac all you can say that i'm quoting the prophet don't get upset with me amen and that prophet had jesus christ failed in him so you come against this you come against god i have immunity this morning you're a man of god you're a sister of god what are you doing spending all that time with that boy or girl in the world married unmarried whatever the situation is there's supposed to be a line of separation because you are a levite you are procrastinated you are chosen for a purpose but just as there's a condition for the rapture there's a condition if you want to stay here there are people who want to stay in them it has to be because if you don't want to take action to get your life in order it means you want to stay here you want to go to the three and a half year tribulation period and die and go to white judgment but i have a wedding supper i have a millennium i have a new city i come from god i'm going back to god and if you have not heard this kind of gospel before i hope it shakes your heart to get your life right with god clean up your house let every man examine himself can the church say amen i'm not going to be too much longer with you to go into the raptor friends you must apply the token amen but abandon preach the token and then that evening he preached what what what message desperation friends in the messenger talking but abraham said apply it church you now don't fail don't he says it three times don't don't don't let the sun set don't don't don't don't rest day or night i'm quoting a prophet don't take no chance it won't work children it won't work you must have the token listen to the prophet you say i believe yes i go yeah i believe the message that's all right that's good but you must have the token do you hear branham tabernacle and i say this morning do you hear headstone tabernacle you must have the token displayed without it all you're believing is in vain he said see you've lived a good life you listen to what the word says you go to church you try to live right that's fine but that's not it when i see the blood that's the token in the same message listen to the prophet don't just come this far say i believe the message you obey the messenger come into christ you say what i believe every word brother branham that's good but that's just being able to read and that's a lot of the message people just know the word they're just able to read a spoken one book where is the token what's the token that's a token that's the life of christ but ibrahimo said take the message take it into your heart that you must have the token the very life that was in christ be in you when i see that i will pass amen over you the musicians coming in and get ready i'm going to begin to wind up now the bible says in in the book of ezekiel chapter 9 he said ezekiel 9 verse 1 he's cried also in my ears with a loud voice saying cause them that have charged over the city to draw near even every man with his destroying weapon in his hand and behold six men came from the way of the higher gate which lied toward the northern every manner slaughter weapon in his hand and one man among them was clothed with linen with the writers writers in corn by his side and they went in and stood beside a brazen altar and the glory of the god of israel was gone up from the cherub whereupon he was to the threshold of the house and he called it a man claw with linen which had the righteous ink income by his side listen and the lord said unto him go through the midst of the city through the midst of jerusalem and set a mark upon the forehands of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the midst thereof and to the others he said in mind hearing go after him through the city and smite let not your eyes spear neither have he pity slay utterly old and young amen this is the bible both means and little children and women but come not near any man upon whom is the mark and begin at my sanctuary then they began at the ancient men which were before the house and brother branham he tied this scripture to revelation 7 and he said after these things i saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth holding the four winds of the earth that the wind should not blow on the earth not on the sea nor on any tree and i saw another angel ascending from the east having the seal of the living god and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea saying hurt not the earth neither the sea nor the trees till we have sealed the servants of our god in their foreheads and friends with the branham brought out that world war one was stopped for the ceiling angel to move through the camp and put a mark on those that sigh and cry for the abomination in the city and i wonder this morning if the ceiling angel were to walk through here right now and to look upon those who are sighing and crying is there anybody that would be sealed this morning is there anybody that has such a burden in their heart or have you become so used to the abomination so comfortable with the abomination you have accepted the abomination as normal or does it hurt you when you look around and see the sin and see the evil and see the young people and see the marriages and see the enemies attack and say oh god you made a promise would you move in this house and deliver your people sigh and cry for those who just come to church and go back home sign and cry for those who have no prayer life sigh and cry who for those who are just at ease in zion sigh and cry because they're just happy to be in the message when the angel is saying to the destroying angels who don't touch them until i've sealed all those the ceiling angel is here this morning to seal you into the kingdom of god before the terrible plague strike friends there's judgment coming but the branham said these angels are the ones responsible for the war and all the wars and the weapons of mass destruction that's what they are here for because this world is about to be judged you cannot play church anymore friends you must get into rapturing condition it's a reality check for all of us it's it's a check for me this morning because i must be ready don't take for granted because i'm preaching i'm ready i have to examine myself by the word and say lord i want to keep climbing lord build me up oh lord let virtue live with me let knowledge live in me lord let charity seal me lord take away every part of me lord that is not supposed to be there lord you said grieve not to holy spirit whether we are sealed until the day of our redemption how do you grieve the holy spirit when you hear the word of god and you don't respond to the word you grieve the holy spirit when you take coming to church for granted you come when you want you do what you want you you play games you don't make a stand oh god help us this morning help us this morning in the message leadership and the last few messages that brother branham preached before he left on december 24 are so special to me because that angel was veiled in the prophet and god knew when the prophet was going to go home so i asked myself the question if god knew brother branham is going to go home and i wonder what last secrets he left her us what will brother branham's parting words to us he didn't even know the day or the time he was going to leave but god knew in the message leadership that was preached on december the 7th 1965 just a few days before but the brandon went home but abandoned said here now look at yourself really are you a genuine bible christian full of love of god remember the kangaroo remember the bible said in the last days when this time takes place he said a mocking angel went through the churches went through the cities and sealed only those who sighed and cried for the abomination that was done in the city is that right ezekiel 9. so this morning friends that mock an angel is going through churches going through cities what position are you in this morning in the old testament one time joshua had to go to battle and somebody did something wrong and just called try by tribe he called family by family individual by individual every man had to examine himself to find out where the problem was friends when last have you examined yourself and come to the reality it's not about how much you jump it's not how much you shout it's not even how much you pray it's how much you live this it's how much you sigh and cry and say lord i don't want to go home the seminar that came out tomorrow really doesn't matter tomorrow really doesn't matter what you think is important and the job and the bills and this and that when if the raptor happens two days from now and you rush out of church to go home and you miss the rapture what's the use friends what's the use prince i challenge you you can't blame anybody friends young people i don't care who backslides who walks away this message is for individuals no group no church no pastor holds the monopoly on the rapture the word has been preached to us and it's up to every single one of us to measure up amen you could have knowledge and mr rapture you could speak in tongues and mr rapture you could feed the poor and miss a rapture you could give your body to be burned and missed the rapture you must have charity dynamics the token the literal life seven thundering voices christ in you the hope of glory to go into the rapture i want to end with this prayer you could play softly god doesn't call man to judgment without first warning him as a prophet god doesn't call man to judgment without first warning him amen but ibrahim is praying say i pray god that tonight and i say today if there be some here who doesn't know you who's never made their peace and maybe tonight while we've been speaking a little voice has been speaking down in their heart i feel a warning that i can't be around much longer oh god may they put their house in order right now may everything be set may the coldness maybe they're christians but they just haven't they have lived under this so long and seen so many things that they've lost the value of it the things they take it lightly instead of real deeply and sincerely oh god let us check up tonight granted knowing that these great things are only warning us of the soon rapturing church and if we are laden with sin with unbelief and with slaughterfulness we shall not make that rapture we know it lord so we pray that you will burn into us the holy ghost down into our hearts oh god set our souls on fire with your blessing help us to understand is there anybody feels that way this morning is there anybody signing this morning anybody crying this morning but the brandon said when you come to church you either leave worse than you came or you leave better than you came how are you going to leave this morning how are you going to leave this morning mother father brother sister young person you need the holy ghost you need the token you need to be changed friends it's early the altar is open this morning the
