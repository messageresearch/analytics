[55:33] began to reason those words and began to

[1:22:37] Lord
[1:22:38] there was a student one time in a
[1:22:41] football game
[1:22:42] and some football lover was watching us
[1:22:46] question is as a surprised favorite team
[1:22:49] collected tree goes from the opponent
[1:22:52] and it was so discouraged until he gave
[1:22:58] up hope of their possible recovery from
[1:23:00] such deficit but he noticed that the
[1:23:04] players were not bothered about their
[1:23:06] three goals they have collected they
[1:23:10] kept playing the game anyhow and they
[1:23:12] kept giving it their very best glory
[1:23:17] they were plain as if nothing happened
[1:23:19] if everything was fine they never looked
[1:23:23] at what opponent has already collected
[1:23:24] given to them they were still play they
[1:23:27] kept playing the game as if nothing has
[1:23:30] happened
[1:23:30] the mud was washing on as they pulled
[1:23:34] one back and then they came back and put
[1:23:38] back the second one and then the finally
[1:23:42] they propagated good and they went ahead
[1:23:45] to score the winning goal
[1:23:48] [Applause]
[1:23:53] and I've got a match the man came today
[1:23:57] to one of the players and said what
[1:23:59] actually happened when you call it that
[1:24:01] three goes I thought to be have been
[1:24:03] discouraged and you have been confused
[1:24:05] but you kept play like as if not it
[1:24:08] happened and the man said yes whether it
[1:24:12] goes down but much wasn't over yet the
[1:24:18] game is not over yet
[1:24:20] so we complain because it literally has
[1:24:23] no bloody sign and whistle and I said a
[1:24:28] problem with many is that the blood of
[1:24:30] whistle the final whistle before LFL
[1:24:33] applauses for whistle and I give up and
[1:24:39] I surrender and then the opponent wins
[1:24:42] hallelujah is about a cap that came
[1:24:45] their best even though they went down
[1:24:47] but they never failed now they never
[1:24:50] stayed down and I have good news for you
[1:24:53] today even though you are down even
[1:24:56] though you are down don't stay down the
[1:25:01] but the battle is not over yet

[1:25:41] five minutes to the end of the game I
[1:25:43] was taking it my best

[1:26:39] his own they give up before the battle
[1:26:44] is over
[1:26:46] they give glory to the devil is love

[1:51:55] confession while we hear his wife had
[1:51:59] better self ready why all his ministers
[1:52:02] levering but mom said that every took
[1:52:05] can do in here ought to be repeats every
[1:52:11] little candle in here ought to be leads
[1:52:14] because we are in the coming of the Lord
[1:52:18] [Applause]
[1:52:20] and many many many have the alum smoked
[1:52:23] out and many has the candles all gone
[1:52:27] but he looked at as if chill that light
[1:52:30] little bright she got a revelation that
[1:52:33] our Lord is coming and she lost a coin
[1:52:37] it put our intonation something caught I
[1:52:40] would of her she will relax I will
[1:52:43] explain to him when he comes back he
[1:52:44] does need explanation he wanted coins
[1:52:47] everything must be in place you don't
[1:52:50] need to explain written to the Lord you
[1:52:53] have to fix the coin there hallelujah
[1:52:56] but a Bible said that Lana - bride
[1:52:59] she took her candle I should leave
[1:53:01] realize I bet she took her groom I've
[1:53:05] got to sweep
[1:53:06] and take down the cobwebs I did a
[1:53:09] professor but every little candle in
[1:53:11] here ought to be lit tonight is that the
[1:53:16] Methodists lost their light the bedycasa
[1:53:17] love their light the Baptist was the
[1:53:19] light and every lies Centuri gone
[1:53:22] hallelujah ever lights into the lost but
[1:53:26] as a promise for a bride and if the time
[1:53:28] is shabby lights I thank God does the
[1:53:32] bride with the revelation of the x-ray
[1:53:35] vessel to put iron in a vessel for the
[1:53:39] coming of the Lord hallelujah I want to
[1:53:42] say to you my friends today if you
[1:53:44] haven't received the Holy Ghost make
[1:53:46] sure in this mitches you don't go back
[1:53:48] the same I don't want to keep you too
[1:53:53] long but listen to this one say the
[1:53:56] rapture will be a minority is that right
[1:53:59] the rapture will be a minority because
[1:54:02] he said in the first seal but not
[1:54:05] everybody that claim to have the Holy
[1:54:07] Ghost have the Holy Ghost
[1:54:11] many claim to have the Holy Ghost but I
[1:54:14] don't have what they are claiming they
[1:54:16] have because if they have the Holy Ghost
[1:54:18] I have the Holy Ghost and somebody has
[1:54:21] the Holy Ghost that will agree not I can
[1:54:27] separate us
[1:54:28] nothing can divide us nothing can stop
[1:54:31] us love it and turn us against one
[1:54:33] another because the Holy Ghost that not
[1:54:36] gonna get the Holy Ghost but many dogs
[1:54:41] have one they claim they have and that's
[1:54:43] why that's our opinion minority
[1:54:47] professor that all means that is you
[1:54:49] will make that rupture
[1:54:51] only that is you but make sure brother
[1:54:56] makes your sister you have the Holy
[1:54:59] Ghost let yourself already mature not
[1:55:03] even as you know religious spirits cause
[1:55:06] many up grainy religious
[1:55:08] enlighten religious atmosphere and
[1:55:10] they're very very religious and that
[1:55:12] deceive them
[1:55:13] my religion can never take the place of
[1:55:15] the Holy Ghost treasure can never be the
[1:55:17] Holy Ghost
[1:55:18] is either you have the Holy Ghost and
[1:55:20] the Holy Ghost takes you back to the
[1:55:21] world and you agree with the world and
[1:55:24] if I have the Holy Ghost and you have
[1:55:26] the Holy Ghost they win upon us we are
[1:55:29] one we can not be divided
[1:55:32] we can fight one another with that thick
[1:55:35] one another we can educate one another
[1:55:37] we are brendlin hallelujah but I was
[1:55:42] here but I say it was cut into links I'm

[2:10:17] but I said god bless you the Lord led
[2:10:26] him to the scripture I was reading about
[2:10:30] it five wise vision and the five foolish
[2:10:34] virgins and then I was given my taught
[2:10:37] over this issue
[2:10:39] think about it friends he was named up
[2:10:43] might the Lord shocked me with his
[2:10:44] inspiration the manifestation of the
[2:10:49] Omega bride heroes we have a lot of
[2:10:53] competitions but God knows his own we
[2:11:01] cannot compete for the Holy Spirit but
[2:11:05] we have to be obedient to the word and
[2:11:07] then God we do the rest because this is
[2:11:11] what Malachi 4 said he told us in one of
[2:11:16] his messages and it will not leave my
[2:11:19] heart and I would take it in my bones to
[2:11:22] the grave if I will not see my body
[2:11:25] transformed as I am leaving you say you
[2:11:29] pastors and ministers brothers and
[2:11:32] sisters
[2:11:33] forget about your differences come back
[2:11:37] again to this revered word stay with his
[2:11:42] word and the Holy Spirit I wrote this
[2:11:45] word we come down with the confirmation
[2:11:49] with His Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit
[2:11:53] unites with his word and then he said
[2:11:56] off to the rupture it takes you along so
[2:12:00] you see why we need to have unity the
[2:12:04] unity is not a unity of flesh but is the
[2:12:07] unity of our husband on his word then he
[2:12:14] was sent down His Holy Spirit has he
[2:12:17] done it before he told the disciples
[2:12:19] though he and Terry in Jerusalem and you
[2:12:23] be endued with power from on high
[2:12:26] and that came to pass my brother's my
[2:12:30] sisters this is the last hour this is
[2:12:35] the last moment just any day our lad
[2:12:40] our Lord is coming so make sure you get
[2:12:43] a real thing forget about all the
[2:12:46] babblings and excitements and da dress
[2:12:48] of them as good as they may be make sure
[2:12:52] make sure make sure you are a Christian
[2:13:00] make sure this is what I keep telling my
[2:13:04] children make sure you're a Christian
[2:13:07] not a sing-along those things are good
[2:13:12] because when you become a Christian the
[2:13:15] Bible said all things we pass away and
[2:13:19] behold we come the new things
[2:13:21] your life will be transformed I want to
[2:13:24] see God transform the lives of the young
[2:13:27] people we will know how about the Dickie
[2:13:30] darling and then back and forth and all
[2:13:32] the rest of them on whatever backward
[2:13:35] never a lot of things to distract you

[2:13:42] that distracts you then you have more
[2:13:44] than to attract you that distracts you
