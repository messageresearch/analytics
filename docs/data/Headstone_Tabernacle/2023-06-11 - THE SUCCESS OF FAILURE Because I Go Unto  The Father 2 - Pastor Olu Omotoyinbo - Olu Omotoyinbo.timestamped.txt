[36:02] Hallelujah
[36:04] amen God bless you remember
[36:16] all right today
[36:19] um
[36:20] I'm gonna be speaking on because I'm
[36:23] going to my father and try to finish
[36:24] that up
[36:26] and before I read my scriptures
[36:29] I wanted to just give you a very quick
[36:32] you know
[36:34] um
[36:34] summary of the matter which I did
[36:37] already last week but just a very brief
[36:39] scenario
[36:42] so um
[36:47] brother Branham let us understand that
[36:50] his ministry and we see that was the
[36:55] Holy Spirit in this day in this day and
[36:58] age
[36:59] and the Holy Spirit which when I
[37:02] understand
[37:04] um is the spirit of Jesus Christ
[37:07] and the spirit of Jesus Christ we start
[37:09] hearing about
[37:13] the spirit of God been called the holy
[37:16] spirit in so much the holy spirit in the
[37:19] New Testament but it's all been the
[37:21] spirit of God all throughout the Bible
[37:24] and um
[37:28] whatever God does he does it by his
[37:31] Spirit there is nothing he does that
[37:34] doesn't come by his spirit
[37:36] like I explained
[37:38] I mean a few times already the word of
[37:41] God is the spirit of God in what form
[37:44] God is a spirit and those who worship
[37:47] Him worship Him in spirit and in truth
[37:51] none of us can understand the things of
[37:54] his Spirit as human beings because
[37:56] they're spiritually discerned
[37:58] so God
[38:01] condescends in other words he comes a
[38:03] little lower to become the word so that
[38:06] we human beings who live in the realm of
[38:08] words can understand God but it's the
[38:11] spirit that's because that has become
[38:13] the world so man can understand not so
[38:16] animals can understand him but so the
[38:18] human beings can understand him
[38:21] and so that's what this whole program is
[38:23] about it's about the spirit of God
[38:26] when we speak in the world is the spirit
[38:27] of God Jesus said the words that are
[38:29] speaking to you their spirit and their
[38:32] life
[38:33] when you speak you are actually speaking
[38:36] out a spirit and that's what the Bible
[38:39] says death and life are in the power of
[38:42] the tongue when you are speaking you are
[38:44] either speaking death or you are
[38:46] speaking life and those number what
[38:49] those are the words of God and that's
[38:51] why we need to like learn to speak the
[38:55] word of God not speak our
[38:58] doubts not speak our fear but speak the
[39:02] truth of the word of God because the
[39:04] ones we speak the spirit and the life
[39:07] because God is a spirit and those who
[39:09] worship Him worship Him in spirit and in
[39:12] truth
[39:13] so when God created man that was spirit
[39:17] because God wants man to live in the
[39:19] spirit that's the only way you will make
[39:21] any real concert with God that's the
[39:24] essence of this year and then
[39:27] when you have the word of God like I'll
[39:30] I'll show you again in the message I say
[39:31] but I'll show you again the message
[39:32] today when you have the word of God it's
[39:34] great it's good but then what has to go
[39:37] back and turn back to the spirit again
[39:39] so that there can be a manifestation of
[39:41] all that God said the world will produce
[39:44] because Jesus said I come from God I am
[39:48] the word I come from the father that
[39:51] Spirit the father of spirits I become
[39:54] the world and I go back to God again
[39:56] it's not that he's going to go back and
[39:59] sit beside God no he's going to go back
[40:02] into the fatherhood the spirit form
[40:05] again in other words I come from how our
[40:08] spirit before Abraham was I am spirit
[40:12] I I come from the spirit to the world
[40:15] and I'm going back to street again
[40:18] and when I go back to speed again I will
[40:20] come again to you how as the spirit so
[40:24] that you can go back and pick up the
[40:26] program that was you know truncated by
[40:29] the devil in the Garden of Eden that's
[40:32] the story of redemption that's the whole
[40:34] message I'm preaching to you today amen
[40:37] let's turn to our faith and let's use
[40:39] the scriptures
[40:46] Isaiah 53 verses 1-12
[40:50] in Matthew chapter 1
[40:52] and verse 1 and then it's in John 14
[40:54] verses 6 to 12.
[40:59] thank you
[41:15] Isaiah 53 and it was when recently slice
[41:20] who have believed our report
[41:23] and to whom is the arm of the Lord
[41:25] revealed the arm of the Lord is strength
[41:27] of God in other words the report has
[41:29] strength in it have you believed all the
[41:32] report we've been sharing with you amen
[41:34] and have you been finding some strength
[41:36] not just for your head for strength
[41:40] who has believed our report unto whom is
[41:42] the arm of the Lord revealed for he
[41:44] speaking about the music I grew up
[41:46] before him as a tender plan and as a
[41:49] root of a dry ground he had no form no
[41:53] combeliness
[41:54] and when and and when we shall see him
[41:58] there is no beauty that we should desire
[42:01] him
[42:02] he's despised and rejected of men
[42:05] The Man of Sorrows and acquainted with
[42:07] grief
[42:08] and we hid as it were our faces from him
[42:13] people are embarrassed about Jesus
[42:16] Christ embarrassed about the gospel
[42:18] embarrassed about the message
[42:21] good for you
[42:24] he was despised and we esteemed him not
[42:29] the greatest of all creation the
[42:31] greatest of the greatest despised but
[42:34] didn't say I don't know who you're
[42:35] talking to no it is Nigeria don't even
[42:38] know who I am I didn't do anything he
[42:39] didn't say anything like that when you
[42:41] start sin don't you know who I am you
[42:43] have insecurities
[42:45] that's what it is who are you
[42:51] who are you who
[42:54] [Music]
[42:54] [Applause]
[42:58] but Christian's been going with
[43:00] insecurities those are the those are the
[43:02] those are the crosses say you are that
[43:05] Jesus has broken and delivered or strong
[43:08] amen
[43:12] all right
[43:15] surely was for all surely had borne our
[43:17] griefs
[43:19] because he hung on that calvary's cross
[43:21] and these were the things that he was
[43:23] bearing for you and I so there's no need
[43:25] to Bear any grief anymore
[43:28] no reason at all the problem is we don't
[43:32] believe the word
[43:33] I do that's the problem
[43:37] you don't know what happened to me sad
[43:40] things could happen bad things could
[43:42] happen but in the midst of that he can
[43:45] turn your your sadness into Joy he can
[43:48] give you the all of gladness
[43:50] for the spirit of mourning the Bible
[43:53] says amen
[43:56] amen surely you're born agrees on
[44:00] calvary's mountain and carried our
[44:02] sorrows what is making you sorrowful
[44:04] Jesus already carried it
[44:09] yet we did htme smitten
[44:12] smitten of God and afflicted
[44:16] he was wounded for our transgressions
[44:18] your sin sure you know you can't carry
[44:21] anything no more but people still claim
[44:24] Christ and live in sin sin oppresses
[44:27] them you don't own that sin no more
[44:30] [Applause]
[44:31] sin Shall Have No Dominion over you
[44:35] so if you are doing sin because you it's
[44:37] because you want to
[44:43] he was wonderful at transgressions it
[44:46] said in law that you don't punish for
[44:48] the same offense twice
[44:51] your sin Jesus has already taken the
[44:54] punishment for it
[44:56] legally the devil has no right no moral
[45:01] no spiritual no legal rights to put any
[45:04] sin any sickness any sorrow any sadness
[45:08] any grief any shame on you it doesn't
[45:12] have it he has it because you give it to
[45:15] him
[45:15] [Applause]
[45:22] all right
[45:31] he was running for transgressions he was
[45:33] Bruce for iniquities the chastisement of
[45:36] our peace was upon him
[45:38] and with his tribes we are healed
[45:41] wow
[45:44] all we get like sheep have gone astray
[45:47] we have turned everyone to his own way
[45:49] and the lord has laid on him the
[45:51] iniquity of us all
[45:53] he took them all
[45:55] he was oppressed and he was afflicted
[45:58] yet he opened not his mouth his brother
[46:02] as a lamb to the slaughter
[46:04] you maybe see that
[46:10] this is how he carried your sin you know
[46:13] too many times we say I didn't do that
[46:16] no Jesus didn't do a thing
[46:18] he didn't do any single thing that was
[46:22] put on him but we are so Buddha I want
[46:25] to justify I didn't do it I didn't do it
[46:27] they said it's not me I didn't do that
[46:29] many times it's not necessary
[46:32] brother Branham said many times the man
[46:35] who is making the accusation the person
[46:38] is making the attention is the guilty
[46:39] party
[46:41] so why do you bother yourself but one
[46:44] will be seen as clean I'm right I didn't
[46:46] do it my husband said I did it I didn't
[46:47] do it my wife said I didn't do that did
[46:49] you get it I didn't do it it's not
[46:50] necessary
[46:52] and if it's necessary do it in an
[46:54] atmosphere of Peace strive for the unity
[46:56] of the spirit in the bond of Peace
[47:00] when conflict situations come let it be
[47:02] a branding and let there be peace strive
[47:05] for Unity in the born of peace
[47:14] [Applause]
[47:20] um verse
[47:22] um verse 7.
[47:25] he was oppressed and he was afflicted
[47:27] yet he opened on his mouth
[47:31] defend himself because he has a purpose
[47:33] in taking all the
[47:35] sin and the sorrow and the shame that's
[47:37] the purpose
[47:38] and the purpose the garbage truck don't
[47:41] come when you throw all the garbage in
[47:42] it
[47:44] it's going to be thrown away into the
[47:46] garbage dump
[47:47] it doesn't belong in your home do you
[47:49] keep garbage in your home do you put
[47:51] garbage in the garbage truck and then
[47:53] they bring it back to your home no they
[47:56] bring it back to him he said no I paid
[47:57] for this take it away
[47:59] amen
[48:01] for the devil plays on our ignorance and
[48:03] our laziness many times
[48:06] because the symptoms are there because
[48:09] you still struggle doesn't mean that is
[48:12] not it for
[48:13] the devil will only train your resolve
[48:16] whether you believe or you whether you
[48:19] really believe or you are just hoping so
[48:22] hoping so won't get a thing from God
[48:25] brother Obama always said Do you believe
[48:27] with all your heart do you believe with
[48:29] all your heart do you believe with all
[48:30] your heart you get to believe in all
[48:32] your heart not a single doubt in place
[48:35] amen
[48:42] his brought us a lamb to the slaughter
[48:44] and as the ship before the sheraj is
[48:46] dumb so he opened us his mouth not his
[48:48] mouth he was taken from prison and from
[48:51] judgment
[48:52] taken from prison
[48:55] not just on our palator prison the devil
[48:59] thought I go on more to come down to me
[49:02] in hell in prison
[49:04] I got them now but he was taken from
[49:07] there
[49:08] Undeclared and brought about a new race
[49:11] of human beings a new generation
[49:14] and the Bible said here
[49:17] he was taken
[49:19] from prison and from judgment and who
[49:23] shall declare his generation
[49:27] the generation of Jesus Christ
[49:29] for it was caught out of the land of
[49:31] living for translation of my people was
[49:34] he stricken
[49:36] and in minutes grip with the wicked and
[49:38] with the rich in his death because he
[49:40] had done no violence neither was any
[49:43] decision in his mouth yet he pleased the
[49:44] Lord to bruise him he had put him to
[49:47] grief when thou shall make his soul and
[49:49] offering for sin he shall see his seed
[49:52] he shall prolong his days and the
[49:54] pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in
[49:55] his hand he shall see all the trouble of
[49:58] his soul and shall be satisfied by his
[50:01] knowledge and and shall be satisfied and
[50:05] shall be sorry to abide his knowledge
[50:06] shall my righteous servant justify many
[50:10] and he shall bear their iniquities
[50:14] therefore will I dividing a portion with
[50:17] a great and he shall divide the spar
[50:20] with the strong because he has poured
[50:22] out his soul unto death and he was
[50:25] numbered with the transgressors and he
[50:28] bought the same of many and made
[50:31] intercession for the transgressors
[50:34] amen
[50:36] that's the whole crucifixion Story the
[50:40] death the barrier the the resurrection
[50:44] and Ascension of Jesus Christ right
[50:47] there
[50:48] so Matthew 1 and verse 1 the book of the
[50:52] generation of Jesus Christ the son of
[50:55] David

[51:09] truth and the life no man cometh unto
[51:11] the father but by me

[51:35] long time with you and yet has thou not
[51:38] known me Philip
[51:40] he that has seen me had sinned the
[51:42] father

[54:28] are you upstairs
[54:32] okay all right that was increasing him
[54:35] by the way yeah you're singing good like
[54:37] me
[54:38] [Applause]
[54:43] that was really great singing many
[54:46] people you know brother Markley was a
[54:47] song leader you know I'm only one
[54:50] on nature chart with Linux Church years
[54:53] ago before many of you were born before
[54:55] I think even before maybe only ordnell
[54:57] and Gideon were born at the time so
[54:58] definitely J Hill wasn't born so
[55:01] so
[55:02] um so that was a really good thing and
[55:04] we're singing and invest to the lamb for
[55:06] Redemption
[55:08] amen
[55:10] all right so because I've gone to my
[55:13] father and they the because is the
[55:16] operating water because it shows you
[55:18] something because of something something
[55:20] else follows happened so
[55:23] um so our focus is what happened after
[55:25] he went to his father what's that
[55:28] telling us
[55:30] um
[55:32] um when God
[55:35] created man you and I know that you know
[55:37] the story brother Branham let us know
[55:39] the story and like I see all the time
[55:40] and I'm not seeing that you know you not
[55:43] hear these things from
[55:46] a Pentecostal Church
[55:48] even if they've read the message
[55:51] unless you receive that profit you're
[55:53] not like it you'll be able to you know
[55:55] I'll be very clear understanding of what
[55:57] it is because you still have your own
[55:59] thoughts I don't really think it's right
[56:00] on this and all that but when you're
[56:01] sold out then dementia opens up to you
[56:04] get no problem actually because you are
[56:06] you are you know whatever you know it
[56:08] doesn't got us in any one of us we need
[56:10] him
[56:11] so anyway so God wanted to have a line a
[56:15] Godly line
[56:19] image after our likeness to be like us
[56:23] and represent us on the face then go you
[56:25] know be the lineage of God the
[56:27] generation of God
[56:30] and that was what he did in Adam
[56:33] until the fall and that generation
[56:36] received a curse right there the cost of
[56:39] sin and from the sin came
[56:42] sickness disease and death the sin was
[56:45] spiritual death happened they died on
[56:47] the spot just like God said but it also
[56:50] led to sickness disease and we already
[56:53] explained over and over in the past how
[56:56] the sin led to the disease
[56:59] and then the disease led to the death
[57:02] physical death The Last Enemy
[57:06] so that generation died died right there
[57:10] but then that's how we all still came in
[57:13] the world because at that fall a new
[57:17] bloodline was introduced
[57:20] that's the thing about this happens it's
[57:22] the introduction of another bloodline
[57:27] that's not the generation of God and we
[57:30] were all born in that
[57:32] because it's it's human nature we said
[57:36] in the past the devil made sure that the
[57:38] four that every man born of woman
[57:42] was gonna come with this nature not not
[57:45] escaping it the only way you are going
[57:47] to escape is that you're not going to be
[57:49] born through regular natural birth and
[57:52] that's what Jesus bypassed in the
[57:55] virgin birth
[57:57] no instrumentality of man at all just
[58:02] God God himself doing his thing by
[58:04] passing The Devil's Thinking by passing
[58:07] The Devil's plan by fighting what the
[58:09] devil thought he had cooked and he had
[58:11] got us into a into a rabbit hole
[58:14] from the Fallen Eden God bypassed it
[58:19] wasn't born by anything nothing from
[58:22] Mary nothing from from Joseph nothing
[58:25] from any man Mary was just an incubator
[58:29] Mary did not supply the egg
[58:32] it was the spirit of God that he said
[58:35] that holy sin which shall be born of
[58:38] thee shall be called the son of the most
[58:40] high
[58:43] that was God very God that came from the
[58:46] womb of Mary that's why it was called
[58:47] the seed of the woman amen amen the
[58:50] woman just incubating God Amen
[58:58] and so
[59:00] is 10 another generation
[59:03] a spiritual generation
[59:06] amen the generation of Jesus Christ
[59:09] so you are either here today in the
[59:11] generation of Adam or in the generation
[59:13] of Jesus Christ and thank God the
[59:16] generation of Adam is filled with curses
[59:18] the curse of sin disease death
[59:22] everything in your lineage Every curse
[59:25] you can think of Shame sorrow poverty
[59:28] lack insecurities all those curses just
[59:33] there generational
[59:36] stretch it right back to your father's
[59:38] house right down to your father Adam
[59:43] but then here come Jesus the seat of the
[59:45] woman
[59:47] the opportunity to have another lineage
[59:49] and be a point another generation that
[59:52] traces is its Origins brought back to
[59:55] David
[59:57] to Abraham right straight to the man of
[1:00:00] God
[1:00:01] amen oh my
[1:00:03] glory to God
[1:00:06] amen
[1:00:08] so quickly
[1:00:09] let's trace and compare the junction of
[1:00:13] Adam
[1:00:13] and the generation of Jesus Christ
[1:00:15] [Music]
[1:00:20] repeatedly over and over is like Adam's
[1:00:24] birth in time
[1:00:25] judges 128 and Genesis 2 7 is like
[1:00:29] Adam's birth in time
[1:00:31] and like a child is born that's what it
[1:00:35] was for Adam
[1:00:36] so Adam's in time is recorded in those
[1:00:39] verses
[1:00:42] James 1 26 28 was the Inner Man the soul
[1:00:45] of Adam which was
[1:00:48] a portion of the spirit of God a portion
[1:00:51] of God
[1:00:52] was the soul of Adam
[1:00:54] and in there was where Adam was made a
[1:00:58] spirit man because the spirit of God
[1:01:01] and his Spirit man means he was living
[1:01:04] in the spirit of God
[1:01:09] and then
[1:01:11] the outer man Genesis 2 7
[1:01:14] was
[1:01:16] the Flesh of Adam where he the spirit of
[1:01:20] God on the inside of him walked out
[1:01:22] through his flesh
[1:01:23] so he'll walk in the spirit he lived in
[1:01:26] the spirit and he saw a life in there
[1:01:31] and when he was placed in flesh
[1:01:34] he also that Spirit on him the flesh did
[1:01:38] nothing they fled just just was just
[1:01:41] like a a a
[1:01:44] um an incubator to carry the spirit the
[1:01:48] flesh just followed what the spirit on
[1:01:50] the inside did so he lived in the spirit
[1:01:53] and walked in the spirit
[1:01:56] amen and was the spirit of God
[1:01:59] amen so that lets you and I know
[1:02:03] there's an inner Game of Life and
[1:02:06] there's an outer game of life but you
[1:02:08] know put them together if you want to
[1:02:10] walk with God
[1:02:11] amen everyone who succeed have really
[1:02:14] great success in any area of your life
[1:02:16] at all
[1:02:17] and I I preach because I believe the
[1:02:20] gospel is catered to the total man
[1:02:23] Spirit soul body
[1:02:26] for all of life and godliness if you
[1:02:28] want to be really have great success in
[1:02:31] any area of your life at all in your
[1:02:34] walk with God in your work in the
[1:02:36] natural amen you've got to understand
[1:02:40] where the spirit of God must give you
[1:02:43] victory
[1:02:45] in the in the Game of Life
[1:02:47] because the body in a game and out again
[1:02:49] when I'm saying game I don't mean soccer
[1:02:52] just a language to understand that
[1:02:54] there's an inner thing going on and you
[1:02:57] got to overcome and live uh in Victory
[1:03:00] in there because you must win in the
[1:03:03] inner game first
[1:03:05] or you cannot win in the outer game let
[1:03:07] me put it another way you must win in
[1:03:09] the inner game to stand any chance at
[1:03:12] all or winning in the outer game
[1:03:15] because like I've said to you over and
[1:03:17] over and over so many years by said in
[1:03:19] the last one year and the course of this
[1:03:21] series of messages the inner man is a
[1:03:25] million times more powerful than the
[1:03:27] outer man
[1:03:28] a million times more powerful and that's
[1:03:31] not me saying that
[1:03:32] go and go and do the research
[1:03:36] the inner man this subconscious man is a
[1:03:40] million times more powerful than the
[1:03:43] outside man
[1:03:45] amen
[1:03:47] so to win at all on the external you're
[1:03:50] gonna win in the internal first and
[1:03:54] that's why the Bible encourages us to
[1:03:55] focus on the inner man not on the outer
[1:03:59] man the ottoman has no choice if
[1:04:02] whatever is just follow
[1:04:05] if good is an inner man the ottoman will
[1:04:08] be good if if if God is an inner man the
[1:04:12] ottoman will be bad
[1:04:14] and that's why it tells us to get our
[1:04:17] heart with all diligence

[1:04:34] where is it coming from where is this
[1:04:36] powerful in a man coming from was this
[1:04:39] powerful inner game coming from verse a
[1:04:41] million times more powerful than the
[1:04:43] outer man well you know the story Elohim
[1:04:48] Elohim before The Phoenician of The
[1:04:50] World God a spirit had thoughts on his
[1:04:54] mind
[1:04:55] that lets you understand right away
[1:04:57] those thoughts were spirit
[1:04:59] [Music]
[1:05:00] [Applause]
[1:05:04] and you were in
[1:05:06] the thoughts in his thinking brother
[1:05:09] banam told us that where else you hear
[1:05:11] that from
[1:05:12] where else you hear that from take it to
[1:05:14] the real origins of the foundation of
[1:05:16] Faith your Origins Charles Darwin talks
[1:05:20] about the origin of the species know the
[1:05:24] origin of life itself is not in amoeba
[1:05:27] the origin of life this way back to the
[1:05:31] mind of God before the foundation of the
[1:05:32] world and there you were as a little
[1:05:35] thought in God's mind amen I'm trying to
[1:05:38] show you where where where the inner
[1:05:41] life of power comes from
[1:05:43] amen
[1:05:49] and Elohim like our X-Men over and over
[1:05:51] also
[1:05:52] wanting to do this so that he will have
[1:05:55] sons and daughters who will be like him
[1:05:57] who will represent him on the face of
[1:05:59] the Earth because God is the god of the
[1:06:01] universe
[1:06:03] but he wants his sons and daughters who
[1:06:05] have been his name to be the gods of the
[1:06:07] Earth To Rule and Reign on the earth in
[1:06:11] his favor
[1:06:12] the Christians are so focused on going
[1:06:14] heaven and they are not focused on
[1:06:17] living on the earth here for us you
[1:06:19] can't jump off the Earth on the earth
[1:06:21] yellow on the earth we have got to
[1:06:23] represent Jesus Christ in every single
[1:06:26] way before we go to heaven and even when
[1:06:29] we get heaven we come back on the earth
[1:06:31] and live on this Earth here forever amen
[1:06:34] amen it's going to be a new city a New
[1:06:36] Jerusalem it's gonna be on the earth we
[1:06:38] shall reign on the earth can you say
[1:06:41] Amen
[1:06:45] Hallelujah
[1:06:47] [Music]
[1:06:49] [Applause]
[1:06:52] so Elohim knowing that he's gonna
[1:06:54] Christians and daughters who are going
[1:06:56] to operate in the realm of words
[1:06:59] he started to form himself towards flesh
[1:07:02] in a theophany he became the word
[1:07:06] so he came from Elohim to the theophany
[1:07:08] the world and the thought of you in
[1:07:11] Elohim became a seed in the word and the
[1:07:15] spoken word is the original Sage
[1:07:19] [Applause]
[1:07:20] death and life are in the power of the
[1:07:23] tongue where did the seed come from from
[1:07:26] your words that come from your mouth
[1:07:28] you'll speak the words for death or life
[1:07:30] and out of those out of those words from
[1:07:33] the Seas and from the fruit of death
[1:07:36] and life
[1:07:40] I can I will I do believe how I have no
[1:07:45] idea but I can I will I do believe the
[1:07:49] Bible tells me so the Bible tells me so

[1:09:14] eternity pass
[1:09:16] that's where you come from
[1:09:18] a little thought in Elohim thinking
[1:09:22] and is thinking
[1:09:24] that sounds common to you right now but
[1:09:27] that's the truth that's where you come
[1:09:29] from

[1:09:42] and in the logos Elohim is seven spirits
[1:09:45] and you exceed
[1:09:47] a little thought in his mind and in the
[1:09:49] logos you became a little seed
[1:09:52] and each of the seeds of Elohim
[1:09:56] was had a portion of Elohim in them
[1:10:03] seven spirits because Elohim is seven
[1:10:06] spirits is image and if you're a seed of

[1:14:09] [Music]
[1:14:13] Hallelujah
[1:14:14] [Applause]
[1:14:24] we're talking about the birth of Adam
[1:14:30] so I Elohim
[1:14:34] took these seven spirits
[1:14:37] the Adam seed
[1:14:39] brother said who is in my case like
[1:14:42] maybe seated
[1:14:43] you come like Adam
[1:14:45] you come like me so we come exactly like
[1:14:48] Adam came
[1:14:49] and Adam's seed was in the logos
[1:14:52] seven spirits and he took Adam seed out
[1:14:55] and put in the soul
[1:14:59] seven spirits
[1:15:02] seven spirits in his soul and Adam lived
[1:15:05] in the spirit it was in charge
[1:15:08] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:15:11] amen
[1:15:12] making Adam a son of God
[1:15:16] the god of the the spirit of God
[1:15:20] lived in his soul
[1:15:22] Adam lived in the spirit
[1:15:25] by the battle of the Holy Ghost in type
[1:15:27] birth in him giving him a birth
[1:15:30] into the kingdom of God
[1:15:33] Hallelujah Adam's children his soul was

[1:15:41] Faith virtue knowledge Temperance
[1:15:43] patience godliness brotherly kindness
[1:15:45] the stature of Jesus Christ amen
[1:15:49] and that's what he was that's the spirit
[1:15:51] man of Adam was
[1:15:53] every man is a spiritual being but some
[1:15:56] men have in addition to the spirit the
[1:15:59] soul they have the seed of God in there
[1:16:01] that's Adam's generation
[1:16:08] So Adam was a spirit man with seven
[1:16:12] spirits in his soul farming him
[1:16:13] conforming him into the image of the Son
[1:16:18] of God Amen that he might be conformed
[1:16:22] to the image of a Son of God the son of
[1:16:26] God
[1:16:27] Spirit Son of God Elohim spirit is
[1:16:30] spirit Spirit Son of God with theophany

[1:16:40] body
[1:16:42] the Son of God the theophany
[1:16:44] amen which became Jesus Christ
[1:16:49] suggestions 1 26 28 again I say was the
[1:16:52] birth of Adam in time
[1:16:54] representing the four meaning of the
[1:16:56] word image in him conformed become
[1:16:59] formed god plain on the words that we
[1:17:01] might be conformed to the image of his
[1:17:03] son become that we might be conformed be
[1:17:06] conformed into the image of his son and
[1:17:10] Adam was become formed into the image
[1:17:14] of God's son
[1:17:16] the logos
[1:17:18] the theophany god
[1:17:20] represented on the Earth
[1:17:22] by the man Adam that was his birth that
[1:17:25] was living in that was Adam lived in the
[1:17:27] spirit the spirit of God baptizing his
[1:17:30] soul
[1:17:31] were the seven spirits of God
[1:17:34] seven spirits from the Adam into the
[1:17:36] water image
[1:17:37] a perfect man standing the face of the
[1:17:40] Earth
[1:17:40] with the word image he was fruitful
[1:17:44] he multiplied he could replenish his
[1:17:47] subdued and he was in Absolute Total
[1:17:49] Dominion even in his soul in his inner
[1:17:53] life
[1:17:53] the inner came was one of Dominion
[1:17:58] amen that's why Jesus told them you will
[1:18:00] feel the deadly supporters you garnish
[1:18:03] it on the outside and on the inside you
[1:18:05] are full of potrifying souls
[1:18:12] brother baptism cleans that up
[1:18:15] and fish with a sweet s Maryland
[1:18:17] several of the Holy Ghost from the
[1:18:19] inside
[1:18:24] so the water image
[1:18:25] the Seventh Street in his soul
[1:18:28] the image let's make God in our own
[1:18:31] image that's the word image the image of
[1:18:33] God the word the theophany the seven the
[1:18:36] the the the spirit Son of God the seven
[1:18:39] spirits with the word image
[1:18:42] Adam
[1:18:44] reigned on the Earth
[1:18:46] he was a leader last Sunday God's
[1:18:50] program is to make you a leader
[1:18:52] between in school
[1:18:53] [Applause]
[1:18:57] you may not understand or believe that
[1:18:59] that's fine but that's what the gospel
[1:19:01] is God made man the leader of his
[1:19:04] creation
[1:19:05] yeah
[1:19:06] very well so your very essence of being
[1:19:10] a Christian is to be trained to be a
[1:19:12] leader
[1:19:14] sure you the husband is a leader to his
[1:19:16] family the mother's related to our
[1:19:17] children the big brother is the leader
[1:19:19] to the Young Brother the big sister is a
[1:19:21] leader to the young sister
[1:19:23] that's God's plan
[1:19:26] for leadership this is leadership
[1:19:27] training school that's why we come to
[1:19:29] church
[1:19:29] [Applause]
[1:19:36] amen
[1:19:40] and so Adam with the word imagine him he
[1:19:43] reigned in life in the Inner Man he was
[1:19:45] a leader and brother said that Adam
[1:19:49] in the spirit he let the animals about
[1:19:52] in the spirit he has so much Plan
[1:19:54] Authority he led the animals about
[1:20:00] before he was even put before this what
[1:20:02] image was put into his flesh he has so
[1:20:05] much Plan Authority as a leader on the
[1:20:08] earth to lead even the animals about
[1:20:10] there was no wife nobody else him alone
[1:20:14] amen
[1:20:16] So Adam he won in the inner game
[1:20:20] like I said again you gotta win in the
[1:20:22] inner game is a prerequisite
[1:20:25] to stand a chance at all to winning in
[1:20:27] the outer Game of Life
[1:20:29] is a prerequisite
[1:20:34] and then
[1:20:35] Genesis 2 7.
[1:20:38] all of these here these what he made was
[1:20:41] anointed into his flesh
[1:20:43] so where is this in a game coming from
[1:20:46] from God
[1:20:48] from God the Eternal
[1:20:50] the supernatural the one who created the
[1:20:54] world by his word
[1:20:57] the word who created the one who of whom
[1:20:59] he was said
[1:21:00] and he is before all things and without
[1:21:03] him was not anything made that was made
[1:21:07] the Creator who created the Angels who
[1:21:10] couldn't Lucifer who created everything
[1:21:12] there is
[1:21:15] Hallelujah and even before but before I
[1:21:18] say other question you were there
[1:21:20] you already there stop biting your nails
[1:21:24] whether you button your nails for
[1:21:26] Hallelujah
[1:21:30] [Applause]
[1:21:31] Hallelujah
[1:21:35] amen
[1:21:37] Hallelujah
[1:21:39] so when Adam God placed this word image
[1:21:44] and anointed into his flesh because he's
[1:21:47] going to live in the flesh on the face
[1:21:50] of the Earth
[1:21:53] showing the spirit he contacts the
[1:21:55] spiritual world but in the flesh he's
[1:21:57] gonna live on the face of the Earth he
[1:21:59] needs flesh to live on the face of the
[1:22:00] Earth you can go to walk in your spirit
[1:22:03] you've got to put some flesh on
[1:22:06] spiritual
[1:22:08] gotta balance it up
[1:22:11] let it be the spirit coming out on the
[1:22:14] outside
[1:22:15] amen temper down by the radius that you
[1:22:18] are living in a physical world
[1:22:21] amen
[1:22:23] I don't want to get into that amen
[1:22:27] So Adam was present flesh
[1:22:28] and when it was leading flesh you begin
[1:22:31] to walk in the spirit living the spirit
[1:22:33] walking this way how was he walking the
[1:22:35] spirit the spirit the water image was in
[1:22:37] his flesh so the word image used his
[1:22:39] flesh body to walk
[1:22:41] the spirit who you can see used Adam's
[1:22:45] flesh body
[1:22:46] to walk to walk around
[1:22:50] amen does that make sense
[1:22:52] amen oh my
[1:22:54] God
[1:22:58] how was the what image anointed into his
[1:23:01] flesh how
[1:23:04] we say that all the time
[1:23:06] by the Breath of Life say God
[1:23:10] formed man
[1:23:13] out of the doors of the ground
[1:23:15] and breathed
[1:23:18] into his nostrils the breath of life
[1:23:21] which is the Breath of God which is the
[1:23:25] spirit of God which is not amoya which
[1:23:27] is God's Own Holy Spirit
[1:23:33] with Britain at Birth the fall made that
[1:23:36] but original plan God's breath Breathe
[1:23:39] on Me Breath of God breathe on me that I
[1:23:41] may never die Breathe on Me Breath of
[1:23:43] God Breathe on Me
[1:23:45] [Applause]
[1:23:50] listen Adam said I was one image
[1:23:52] anointing to his flesh by the breath of
[1:23:55] life which is the Breath of God which is
[1:23:58] the spirit of God which represents today
[1:24:00] the true baptism of the holy spirit amen
[1:24:05] anointed the word into his flesh sure
[1:24:08] the word image was on the inside but it
[1:24:11] needs to be on the Flesh on the outside
[1:24:13] for him to become the world made flesh
[1:24:18] the word image on the inside good boy
[1:24:20] needs to come in the flesh
[1:24:23] and the spirit of God that's why even
[1:24:26] out here you have been formed into the
[1:24:28] water image you are going to need the
[1:24:30] spirit of God
[1:24:32] are the true baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:24:34] to anoint the word on the inside of you
[1:24:38] into your flesh and then you become the
[1:24:40] one may flesh your tongue becomes the
[1:24:42] wall your hands becomes the word you
[1:24:44] would lay hands on the sick verse the
[1:24:46] sick cannot stay sick
[1:24:48] your speak demons cannot stay how your
[1:24:51] custard Devils they gotta go they've got
[1:24:54] to go right now we pray sometimes those
[1:24:57] devils are stubborn right now we pray
[1:24:59] amen and your sickness sounds to stay
[1:25:01] there and you think he's not gone those
[1:25:03] devils are stubborn but that time when
[1:25:06] you become the what made flesh you don't
[1:25:08] have to to lay hands on the sick you
[1:25:10] speak the word and the demons scattered
[1:25:14] the scatter and run for their life when
[1:25:18] aware we are on our way
[1:25:21] glory glory to God hallelujah
[1:25:27] amen you maybe see that
[1:25:30] amen
[1:25:31] [Applause]
[1:25:34] so the Breath of God Genesis 2 7
[1:25:37] anointed the spirit of God into Adam's
[1:25:40] flesh and the spirit of God and the
[1:25:43] Flesh of Man became United amen
[1:25:48] God became United
[1:25:50] in a body of Flesh and Adam became the
[1:25:53] word
[1:25:54] made flesh living in the spirit walking
[1:25:58] in the spirit
[1:25:59] Hallelujah
[1:26:04] walk in the spirit just like it they did
[1:26:08] in this just like he did living in the
[1:26:10] spirit walk in the spirit he was foot
[1:26:12] full
[1:26:13] multiplied
[1:26:15] replenished subdue than he was in

[1:29:15] Adam
[1:29:16] and the rain on the Earth
[1:29:19] while the three full mystery God in
[1:29:21] preeminence over Adam by the spirit
[1:29:23] living in him God speak controlling him
[1:29:25] in the inner game in the outer game
[1:29:28] the girl wasn't subjective to God is a
[1:29:30] chin of command the Earth was in
[1:29:31] subjection to him
[1:29:33] because he was written to God the other
[1:29:36] submission to him
[1:29:39] there's always a trade-off
[1:29:43] if you're trying to go higher
[1:29:45] in anything in life actually I'm saying
[1:29:47] anything like there's always a trade-off
[1:29:49] there's a because Factor there
[1:29:55] is a threat of if you are trying to
[1:29:56] achieve anything and you don't you know
[1:29:58] there's nothing you're going to trade
[1:29:59] off
[1:30:01] I think again

[1:30:46] calls success but what God calls success
[1:30:48] is what Bill Gates has
[1:30:50] success on the external and success on
[1:30:52] the inside that gives you peace that

[1:33:15] his work his accountability
[1:33:17] responsibility is his relationship with
[1:33:20] other people of which marriage is only a
[1:33:23] prototype of every human relationship

[1:35:05] dominion over self life before it can be
[1:35:08] given dominion over other things on the
[1:35:11] earth Dominion
[1:35:14] many Christians should change themselves
[1:35:16] in finding success in other areas of
[1:35:19] their lives because they are not
[1:35:20] faithful in the relationship with God
[1:35:21] they haven't walked out figured out this
[1:35:24] I do this I'm going to get the top and
[1:35:25] many are still struggling so many years
[1:35:26] after because they keep going in some
[1:35:28] Corner because the person of the Holy
[1:35:30] Ghost God's spirit living in the spirit

[1:36:04] you will be a blessing your blessing
[1:36:06] will overflow that's the generation of
[1:36:08] Jesus Christ and the path to that is the
[1:36:11] baptism of the Holy Ghost the person is
[1:36:14] your secret of success not your struggle
[1:36:17] not your struggle now you're keeping God

[1:36:55] so here was Adam leaving our God's
[1:36:58] original plan for man living in the
[1:37:00] spirit walking in the spirit and
[1:37:02] experiencing great success
[1:37:04] he had a beautiful home the gun of Eden
[1:37:08] great food to eat
[1:37:12] all he needed to do was maintain a walk
[1:37:14] with God
[1:37:15] that's what you need to do
[1:37:16] [Music]
[1:37:19] even at a great home before he certainly
[1:37:23] about marriage
[1:37:24] that's right
[1:37:26] now we don't need like that these days
[1:37:28] that's fine
[1:37:29] that's fine
[1:37:40] men don't even have plans for the 10th
[1:37:43] or Cottage
[1:37:46] let me leave that alone
[1:37:48] they told me that's a favorite topic on
[1:37:50] the asking thing so
[1:37:53] in the middle of alone we're going to
[1:37:54] have a chairman asking I'm telling you
[1:37:56] are going to park four years into three
[1:37:59] days what a time is gonna be come with
[1:38:01] us we will do you good
[1:38:04] for the Lord has spoken good
[1:38:06] concerning Israel
[1:38:08] oh Hallelujah
[1:38:13] are you seeing the path if Adam did not
[1:38:16] fall that you would have taken
[1:38:18] if you didn't have enough for all
[1:38:19] because Adam was in the time and the
[1:38:22] season was the stand and call you out
[1:38:26] impact eternal life call you out and
[1:38:29] your sin like Adam would have come out
[1:38:32] amen seven perfect spirits
[1:38:34] are not into a body of Flesh and you
[1:38:37] have come here
[1:38:38] adopted a grown-up fully grown up
[1:38:42] Son of God
[1:38:44] like Adam
[1:38:46] we taught her Dominion on the face of
[1:38:48] the year that was God's original plan
[1:38:49] that was a generation God that's a
[1:38:52] generation God wanted
[1:38:54] amen and so Adam lived until the fall
[1:38:57] and therefore this order was reversed
[1:38:59] the devil's plan reverse the other he's
[1:39:01] he's a thief he comes to do nothing but
[1:39:03] to steal kill destroy he has nothing
[1:39:06] original just see the one and then
[1:39:08] change it that's how some people are
[1:39:10] they don't
[1:39:18] some people are like that
[1:39:21] it's not God's spirit God's spirit is
[1:39:23] agreeable
[1:39:26] not because you agree with everything
[1:39:28] somebody said no you look for areas of
[1:39:30] agreement
[1:39:32] River can two work together except they
[1:39:35] agree no but some we share this here
[1:39:39] they look even when you don't agree
[1:39:41] wisdom says that I don't agree with that
[1:39:43] thing I said but how can I come across
[1:39:45] as agreeable
[1:39:48] so that we can reason together let me
[1:39:51] leave that alone I go and then and I
[1:39:52] don't get my message
[1:39:53] [Applause]
[1:39:53] [Music]

[1:40:01] but this was God
[1:40:03] Lucifer refresh the spirit just is
[1:40:06] always a negative just a contrary thing
[1:40:07] just a contrary thing just the
[1:40:09] contrasting if she's got here he does
[1:40:10] your position he can't create anything
[1:40:12] devil can create a bad life for you

[2:48:01] go to move all things from away from you
[2:48:04] to make sure you get what you're
[2:48:06] supposed to get this is a critical
[2:48:08] season this is this is me long for all
[2:48:10] these years we come up to this great
[2:48:12] climax when when God called Israel after
[2:48:15] Egypt it wasn't the Platinum of any
[2:48:16] wilderness
[2:48:18] also bring them to the promised land the
[2:48:20] willingness was just a journey
[2:48:21] the objective was to get them to the
[2:48:23] mountain to worship God nothing was
[2:48:26] supposed to stop no Red Sea no Bandit no
[2:48:28] no Pharaoh no Horseman nothing at all so
[2:48:32] that's why Moses was so anointed to
[2:48:34] bring the people out but those two
[2:48:36] thousand million two million people died
[2:48:37] they died because of unbelief they die
[2:48:40] because when they come so close up they
[2:48:41] decide to go back in negatives and all
[2:48:43] like my atmosphere I recall regards of
[2:48:46] what you've gone through you heard what
[2:48:47] brother will preach the gene that God
[2:48:49] put in you was before the function of
[2:48:51] the world God is not now picking you
[2:48:53] because you have good behavior now today
[2:48:54] and you had bad Beaver last night and
[2:48:56] last week it's not no God choose you you
[2:48:58] know he chooses it before the function
[2:48:59] of the world we are all bad we're all
[2:49:02] born in sin shape iniquity we come under
[2:49:04] the lineage of Adam's generation of Adam
[2:49:06] but not as a new generation the
[2:49:08] generation of Jesus Christ that brought
[2:49:10] this Blood this Blood this blood and
[2:49:12] come back to blood to bring a
[2:49:14] breakthrough for you it's not what you
[2:49:16] do or you don't do it's you accepting
[2:49:18] what the blood has done for you and you
[2:49:20] plugging into the blood and getting
[2:49:21] power from the blood getting life from
[2:49:23] the blood getting strength from the
[2:49:25] blood getting the anointing from the
[2:49:27] blood it's not your power it's not your
[2:49:28] anointing it's his power it's his
[2:49:30] anointed it's not my mind not by power
[2:49:32] it's his spirit
[2:49:33] [Music]
[2:49:37] sideway came before yesterday get back
[2:49:39] up
[2:49:40] go sit down get back up I don't care
[2:49:43] what happened get back up get back on
[2:49:45] track
[2:49:46] get back in step
[2:49:48] that's the burden of God to get back a
[2:49:51] church in order
[2:49:52] so you think if God take on all our
[2:49:54] problems all our lineage and whatever
[2:49:56] grandfather do and great grandfather and
[2:49:57] great grandfather we even know what you
[2:49:59] do
[2:50:00] and we find ourselves in some some kind
[2:50:02] of issue the blood comes the correct all
[2:50:04] of that we're not psychologists to go
[2:50:06] back in the history of your life and
[2:50:08] your past in a generation there's a new
[2:50:10] generation because there's a blood a
[2:50:11] fresh blood the generation of Jesus
[2:50:13] Christ they can't go back to a natural
[2:50:14] lineage they have to go back to the
[2:50:16] brother Jesus Christ that cleanses us
[2:50:18] all from sin Oh Glory according to treat
[2:50:21] people as a forgiven sinner or give the
[2:50:23] Lord some praises
[2:50:24] then the Lord I shout in the house
[2:50:27] not some self-righteous Rascal but they
[2:50:30] treat people as a forgiven sinner
[2:50:32] knowing God has pardon you and I've
[2:50:34] forgiven you and as God give you Grace
[2:50:36] you can extend that Grace to others oh
[2:50:38] could we give the Lord a shouting her
[2:50:43] Hallelujah
[2:50:44] so you don't have that right to look
[2:50:46] into this one so and I won't show and
[2:50:48] you find soul and you saw when you're
[2:50:49] judging all kind of things so don't do
[2:50:51] that
[2:50:52] thank God for the blood that gives you
[2:50:54] opportunity thank you for pardoning me
[2:50:55] thank you for your grace thank you for
[2:50:57] your blood thank you for your mercy and
[2:50:59] I'm praying for my brother and I'm
[2:51:00] praying for my sister you gotta call you
[2:51:02] the judge people in a kind of a way
[2:51:04] where you for myself righteous thrown
[2:51:05] Jesus will beat them fast and say
[2:51:07] Hypocrites your streamers are nothing
[2:51:10] swallow a camel
[2:51:14] your own eye and then you'll see clearly
[2:51:17] to take out the little speck in
[2:51:19] somebody's eye

[2:51:22] attitude not Pride not arrogance not
[2:51:26] because you're no more you're this

[2:51:29] this and that no don't go there once we
[2:51:31] were false once we were Sinners once we
[2:51:34] were slaves but God choose to give us an
[2:51:36] opportunity to go free it's your choice
[2:51:39] God's Not Gonna Force you you could stay
