[0:06] a church that knows nothing about any
[0:20] spiritual gift and just be so in love
[0:23] with each other with Christ I'd rather
[0:26] have that than every spiritual gift
[0:27] operating in the church that nice
[0:30] landlord in a Pentecostal group but I
[0:33] would rather have it where there is
[0:36] gifts they'll fail where there's gifts
[0:39] will bring confusion where there is
[0:41] gifts they can be questioned but where
[0:43] there is love it is perfect that's right
[0:45] and if you had perfect love you'd have
[0:47] perfect gifts that's right so work first
[0:51] with lung that brings fellowship and
[0:54] fellowship brains gifts
