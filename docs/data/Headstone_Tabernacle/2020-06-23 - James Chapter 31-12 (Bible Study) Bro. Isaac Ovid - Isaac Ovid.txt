Lord that Lord these words would have a deep impact on us Lord we would Lord want to change we would want to be transformed may you bless Lord the world as we approach the world and they study tonight in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen and amen amen well it's certainly a great privilege to be here tonight and kind of continue in this vein of having the Bible studies we really found God to have allowed us to be able to reopen services and to see that now we could have Sunday service and still continue this Bible study on a Tuesday as you will referred this Wednesday tomorrow is our last streaming Wednesday from next week Wednesday we'll be back in church as well and on Friday we will have our prayer meetings and I believe that it is very important for us to continue to understand that church is a means to an end it is not the end this whole plan of redemption this whole book that we read this whole mystery of God is about establishing relationship it is about re-establishing that connection that Gore would have with man and we cannot lose the focus of that relationship that God wants to have with us and God is his word he is also spirit and you find out the more you get into contact with this word it's the more that your exceptional gene you know I was in a conversation yesterday and I was hearing some statistics you know some study was done about people who read their Bibles and and the impact of change and it was really found that people who struggled with different things and they did some surveys and they did some testing and different thing and they found that people who struggle with different things that when they read their Bibles three times a week there was very little change in their behavior but those who read their Bibles for four and more times a week there was a change in behavior you know and I have said it before it takes 21 days for a habit to change if you do something two days doesn't bring a change or a change that will resonate but after you do 21 days of a certain thing a new way of behavior forms you know and us trying to sort of speak 10x or do morning I've done before in our daily walk it's a bring forth a change in our lives not just a change in information you know and and I was sharing with some brothers I was in our fellowship last time with some some very good friends and we were talking about it we learn different things and and what resonated with me is that a lot of believers have information they have different courts on different scriptures but that has to translate itself into a change of your life you know so a lot of people grow in knowledge you know they know a message but your behavior change and that is what the dilemmas test of making it to the rapture become better balance it only political of to get you over there that protocol of is not information that is your whole nature what your whole appetite everything has to change you know so our conditioning on our approach that you would is such that it is supposed to bring that change in behavior you know and I said something last Sunday closer to the end of the service because it really impacted me you know sometimes we go over things in Scripture or you would and for some people it is simple there like a baby thing why why we go I knew that already and for others it may be new to them because we are all at different stages you know and I was having a conversation with someone and I said I'm and I hinted it last Sunday that Jesus at age 12 knew more about scripture and you would and anybody else in fact when Mary and Joseph left him in the temple he was confounded he scribes and priests and all of them and when they came back he said I must be about my father's business then we have the 18 year of silence where there's nothing said about him but when Jesus goes into the temple after coming from the tree while attacks in the wilderness the Bible says as was his custom so he was in the temple as was his custom when he went and read the Spirit of the Lord is upon me and so the reality is for 18 years Jesus you would be written would he would made flesh was sitting down in the temple listening to people who had a fraction of the understanding that he had so I want to encourage you tonight I have a fraction of the knowledge that some of us may have so I still want to encourage you this food in here for everybody you know because if Jesus can sit down and listen to different people come and take scriptures and I said it you know I see where guys know what I meant you know but he's there sitting quiet because it's time to speak was not yet so you get out of it what you expect so I want you to set your expectations very high every time you come into encounter with you would set your expectations very high and don't look for what it could do for somebody else that is wonderful but look into the word for how it can help your life because as you board a plane it's a LIF something go wrong Andy Andy gas masks fall for oxygen put on your mask first before trying to help somebody else so there's a balance with that friends you want to amiko or calling and election sure so I have a very simple teaching tonight that we want to look at and we want to begin the book of James I would have read from James for on Sunday but want to spend time and if I want to title this is a study of genes 3 verses 1 to 12 we're gonna study James 3 verses 1 to 12 and we'll take our time because that's why we do a Bible study we take our time and then I have a few quotes from the Prophet as well to kind of bring this into perspective because we know that we all know that we only sees in the age of adoption an adoption speaks about maturity adoption is as a result of child training is as a result of testing is as a lot of things that are in there but what you're speaking about maturity and James who would have written this book that we call James is a very interesting brother he would have been son of Mary and Joseph so technically they would call him a half-brother of Jesus and he's mentioned a few times but when you look at some theologians see at at John 7 verses 2 to 5 it would appear that James as he brought up Jesus generally believed Jesus you know even his brethren didn't really believe but he was also one of the earliest witnesses of the Resurrection and I'm seeing this to bring a perspective to who this James is that we're gonna read from he would stay in Jerusalem and form part of the group of believers who would pray in the upper room and his upper room experience his status sort of change as the church grew and the church and Jerusalem was seen as being administered or run by both Peter and James in so much that when Saul was convicted to Paul and come to meet with Peter James was part of that meeting and when Pizza escaped from prison he would you should they say go and tell James and the Brethren so it would seem that in Peters absent James was the man who would hate you only reigns together of the group there someone calling me pastor in Jerusalem my times when the Jerusalem Council convened James would appear to be the chairman in acts 15 he is called a pillar of the church in Galatians 2:9 he presides over the meeting in with Paul's to the missionary so I put little bit of stretch at all this brother James is James would start off his letter in Geneva 1 a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ he twelve tribes which are scattered abroad so we understand that James ministry as it was was really focused on the Jews as compared to Paul being focus on the Gentiles this is this is stuff that we can't understand James verse one verse two would say my brethren count it all joy when you fall into divers temptations it is how he would speak so so he trial or going true counted joy it's always like a tough seeing you know and we're going to pass him I counted joy when you go to diverse temptation knowing this study trying of your faith worketh patience and let patience have a perfect work that you may be perfect and entire wanting nothing and he would go on and he would bring out things and then but then he comes to where we want to rest tonight on James three and James three becomes unique because it brings the area of focus that we know you know but what I want a really hone honest because this could be a make-or-break for your Christian journey right in this James three is that it could be a make or break in your Christian journey what James addresses hidden James 3-1 to 12 he briefly touches in chapter one so we starting in chapter one and we just gonna take one verse in chapter 1 verse 26 and listen to this scripture so we are James 126 we're gonna get the gh3 know but if you have your Bibles James 1:26 he said if any man among you seem to be religious and Bridal if not his tongue but deceiveth his own heart this man's religion is in vain we did one more time if any man among you seem to be religious some would see spiritual and Bridal if not his tongue but he see with his own heart this man's religion is envy so James in James 1 verse 26 among the preaching of encouragement he drops that in there and say listen if you think you're religious and you cannot control your tongue all of your believing is in vain I strong with a strong teaching a strong teaching so we're gonna bring this warm a little bit tonight and Jim starts also we gonna get to our our text tonight James 3 and verse 1 my brethren be not many masters you have to read it carefully be not many masters in other words don't try to be masters and the chance in his teacher so in other words there should be many teachers knowing that we hiki including himself as a teacher shall receive the greater condemnation so he is building here he's building slowly here so in another translation it says it like this not many of you should become teachers my brothers for you know that we who teach shall be judged with greater strictness my brethren be not many masters knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation but a random said like this don't desire ministry because if you teach in the exam paper after fees is a harder example because you're held more accountable because teaching is only the wood is the expression of the wood it's what will bring understanding to people and I've said it before I'm very cautious whenever I'm placed in a position to see something because if I say the wrong thing God will judge me for saying the wrong thing but at the same time words are so powerful that if I'm saying the right thing you are also judged for hearing you would I'm not taking action with you would everybody with me tonight so James goes on for in many things who's to for in many things we offend all if any man offend not in word the same is a perfect man so let me read it slowly again for in many things we offend all said alternatively is same for we all stumble in many ways and if anyone does not stumble in what he says you talk about words no he is a perfect man If any man offend not in word so if you don't make a mistake in what you see you see him as a perfect man so James is no typing the perfect man to the man who doesn't stumble in what he says everybody with me so he's bringing a clear connection between control of what you see and what a perfect man is again for in many things we offend all or in other words for all I'll stumble in many ways if any man offend not in word so if your words don't affect anybody or you don't stumble in your word the same is a perfect man he makes this connection I want to nail it down a perfect man is equal to not stumbling in you would I'm able also to bridle the whole body so James's a mastery over what you see it's also mastery of you over your whole body alright for we all stumble in many ways and if anyone does not stumble in what he says he's a perfect man also able to bridle his whole body so it places mastery of your tongue or of your words as the highest achievement so in bringing your body under subjection in it in other words and I'ma sharing with others conversation yesterday there are people who go into the mountain and meditate and and and be controlled they don't come and meet people they don't funny kid but that is easier to bring that part in subjection than to bring your tongue into subjection everybody with me so Jesus talked about how hard it is to bring this tongue this mount what we see under control and he starts to not bring examples because he's dealing on something and this is the only place in the entire Bible it's almost like a one message is being preached about this he said Behold we put bits in the horse's mouth that they may obey us and we turn about their whole body and then use it another example in verse four behold also the ships which we know they be great and a driven of fierce winds yet they are turned about with a very small helm whithersoever the governor listed so James is bringing a parallel so you could really see it he said I see a bit a horse is a powerful animal and a small bit in the horse's mouth once that bit is connected to the rope you could just pull back a little bit and although it is only any modes by controlling the amount of this horse he won't force would stop the horse would turn left the horse would turn right and he brings the example um as the biggest ship in the world the greatest ship even if they are driven by fierce winds they are turnabout by a very small helm whithersoever he governor listed so he master of the ship don't have to come out his ship and try to hold his ship and try to move the ship and say let me polish it just by moving the rudder bishop he's able to move the entire ship verse five give him so the tongue is a little member and boasted great things be wall how great a matter a little fire kindred they see us thing there now that verse 5 so alternate tongue is a small member yet it boasts of great things when it goes and it says in another translation it says how great of forest is set ablaze by such a small fire anybody with me so a small of all forest you know some may see bushfire on the road and it's a small little cigarette but small something you might not even know the source that ignited with a small flicker a small fire light of the hole for us Jemison your tongue is just like that when you know control what you see it's like basically sparking a little small fire like a light of a whole forest let's continue and the tongue is a fire this is v6 a world of iniquity so is the tongue among our members that it defile ate the whole body and it set it on fire the cause of Nita and is set on fire of hell so what is he saying here is you could be living in your mind what you consider Christian life I don't drink I don't smoke I don't do this I don't do this you don't do that you don't do any other but your mouth your mouth is potentially more dangerous or is more dangerous now everything else that we just talked about listen the James going on because he ready Nealon there's none are we gonna see a few things in a in a bid for this is verse 7 for every kind of beasts and of birds and of serpents and of things in the sea esteemed and I've been teamed of mankind listen to the Prophet listen to James here and every kind of beast and of birds and of serpents and of things in the sea esteem and has been teamed of mankind who is it but the tongue can no man team it is an unruly evil full of deadly poison it'll make you wonder what we're talking about you know and this is where I come in home I come and warm to us tonight because we dealing with spiritual maturity and immaturity we trying to get at is you have to see you writing and you cannot be seen you wrong things and that your eternal destination is not just based on your actions but your eternal destination is based on what you see that's that's that's a big one that's a big one deal with bless we God even the father and therewith curse we men which are made after the same multitude of God out of the same mouth proceeded blessing and cursing my brethren these things ought not so to be in other words you seen when you look at man out early see him out its blessing coming out and his cursing coming on let's go a little these things ought not so to be but a fountain sent forth at the same place sweet water and bitter now a common woman over here is jettisoned Evinrude found a fig tree my brethren be olive berries either a vine figs so can no fountain boat yield salt water and fresh now in our Christian journey you're pressing you trying you're struggling you're trying to do things you trying to do things you right way many times people bring many aspects of their Christian experience under subjection but they still find themselves seeing you wrong thing No research says that on average in addy the average person speaks seven thousand words a day some people do it in half a day some people do that in a few hours but on average on average people spend about seven thousand words a day some could double that number some could quadruple that number I want us to catch what James is saying here words are very powerful words are powerful it was once spoken that was let there be light and there was light it was words spoken that was moon Sun stars separation that creative power of words is very powerful and in simple subtle ways we sabotage our Christian experience and we also sabotage our lives as I look at the journey through Scripture what God is trying to achieve and I'm trying to recognize that many times and I want you to think about it how many times have we said the wrong things when we should have said something different many people talk about somebody told them you'll never amount to anything some people took that as a reason to act out a certain way some people took it as motivation to maybe break out of that but powerful so powerful our words that your wrong words could drive somebody to commit suicide the Wrightwood could break you out of depression you can be having a bad day and somebody says something to you and all of a sudden you're dead changes but a brand imma talk about somebody came into his car and spoke a blue streak meaning the words that came out was laced with spiritual power let's bring it now to you see because many times we come to church and we have a conversation this is Bible study so we're not reaching Jewish life is the easy part know the city warm life do you work life the school life the conflict but a life because conflict is inevitable it's part of life well you see in the midst of the conflict what your mouth says that is the real issue because even when you're apologized for saying certain things you can on the exerting things you ready because because words can be so powerful you could shut down somebody for years misguided parents have said to children I wish I didn't have you some relationships have reached at that point where somebody would see it another I never loved you would such as you'll never change that is a completely different effect from saying you're gonna make it all things are possible in Scripture we see it's a evil every week see you week let them see that they are strong to reinforce that your emotions how you feel how you approach life can change just based on what you see or what is said to you we use the example of naman a week ago where his Sylvan said something to him and he said it was fortunate that his servants had his best interests at heart because if they didn't have his best interests Heidi could have said well let me go back but V actually said you write things to him in such a way that they were able to critically look in and influence you would influence his behavior influence what he was going to do everybody with me tonight the right words at the right time can be helpful can be healing can be transforming can be transformative everybody with me tonight everybody with me the wrong words can be destructive your wrong words can set you back your wrong words can change your whole outlook on life the whole churn of Israel reach the kiddies Vanya 12 spies go out can come back and say we see Giants we car take it we were not gonna make it or all these things give me one second yeah and you want this book destroy the entire the entire atmosphere of the children of Israel in submaster when Joshua and Caleb team you war place in disarray if words did that you know the people didn't see the Giants they didn't experience it but woods puts fear in their heart think about it how many people thought about you know once at a business and somebody sees a do starting business now when is that this is yours boss and that would just destroy you just like that she would yes then we'll just put your put put you on pause enough you power of words so we're dealing it very very very different levels here if your spiritual side is in natural side there's you looking in a mirror of your life and speaking positive about you because Jesus was going to see if you shall see there is mountain not if you believe in him not if you believe is not about even belief because you expressing it activate something so most of them would a brother came to the Prophet and you see something wrong with your wife something wrong with your life and you purposely went last you buy flowers nice easy when I say tell her you love her and I say hello chocolates and I just see you problem was he tall as a spirit upon her you know where was the spread apana just telling how to write clean god help us tonight could change your home seeing the right thing could change your wall Hosanna your words could escalate situations or deescalate so there were 10 managers in companies if something happened you have to learn how to de-escalate speak to people insecurity conflict people attend somebody companies talk [Music] I have seen situation where people go on on them headstrong well if you buy your own thing and before you know it it won't it turn from would fight to physical fight now because if situation was a new world stage but you weren't a de-escalate the situation wasn't there I want you to challenge yourself how many arguments because we comin home no we not dealing with church life he delivered maturity you know we didn't really live that nobody seeing me LSE the scene if he cannot see the apartment scene are we dealing with you in your house and I want you to replay maybe go as far back but some for some people as yesterday some people it's 10 minutes ago some people is there last year I don't know how fire to be you back the things you could have avoided by saying words that were healing that were transformative that were positive that were encouraging words are powerful Jesus was walking one day he saw a fig tree he only decided but I'm sure toward he will get some food to eat there when he saw that there was no fig he's in no man eat from this hereafter Jesus kept walking the disciple can answer what is happening it was a while after only next day or so that the disciples were running say listen you remember Eitri you spoke to where everything is going dried up to the roots and Jesus said have faith in God for verily I say unto you and whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe God those things which he said shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he said so what you see is directly to connect it to what moves in your life until you see it it's not moving let me say that again what you see is directly connected to what will move in your life now I want to touch on a few scriptures we still building on this Matthew 12:36 but I say unto you listen carefully but every Idol would know this bringing a little closer to home now every idle word that men shall speak they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment let me see it again but I say unto you that every idle word that is singular Matthew 12:36 so on average people speak 7,000 words addy I want to think about it and God is picking on the idle words and saying I want you to explain to me because give an account means you have to explain why he was talking that can I can I can I touch that again but I say unto you that every idle would this is what idle phrase this is not idle conversation so most of us spend a whole hour talking things are not edifying anybody not helping anybody not advancing your life your spiritual walk but advancing your marriage and helping your children that's wastin time because all the wall want our your talk is idle you know what idle means item means not productive not helpful there's no fruit idleness cannot lead to fruit so there's no fruit to come from idleness that every idle would I wanted to think about it because putting things into perspective when it takes 7,000 set up multiply it somebody says 11 was 11 million was a year or something like that and out of that it makes you becomes very careful very careful with the quality of conversations you have and the conversations you have with your children and the idol or any productive and the idle or are they helpful at the idle or are a spiritual are you at me when you're in your job are your conversations idle or they are helpful and the idle or they are productive are the idle or people would say boy when he speaks he's seen thing that encourages he's saying that is helpful he's seen because you could spend your whole time and that's why you could resume where people's heart I can you're gonna get to the scripture you don't have to see words a cut people don't to raise yourself up live a life of encouragement live a life of speaking positive but the Branham said if you have nothing good to see steer quiet if you have nothing positive to see steer quiet if somebody don't have new revelation you have you can just blast them away and you didn't run them down and every I said to you that every idle word that men shall speak they shall give account thereof on the day of judgment and he goes on verse 37 for by thy words thou shalt be justified and by thy words thou shalt be condemned so God has way in your words because it was his word he was his creative word but we are living in the in the fruit of his word can eat us amen let's move on proverbs 18:21 if you take in notes I've been looking for it proverbs 18:21 death and life are in the power of the tongue and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof that's given you references to show that this is the issue throughout scripture to help you begin to God how you speak realize your words are like a currency and you're spending this currency in some way and you have to give an account for what you say to your children you have to give an account to what you say to your family you have to give an account to what you say to people you interact with because they may forget what you said but you have to give an account for every would Traverse 2123 whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue keeping his soul from troubles I see it again whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue keepeth his soul from troubles you know my people's soul in trouble because they say things powerful things oh I want this is sing long any heart Ephesians 4:29 this is going now beyond Idol because idleness was dealt with in Mathew idleness is not productive you we same time it is it really does breathe you be there talking I just talking nonsense no Ephesians 4:29 no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edifying that it may Minister grace unto the hearers let me see it again let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edifying that it may Minister grace unto the hearers you Luke 6:45 a good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringing forth that which is good and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his hat bringing forth that which is evil for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh so after all his son undone you could be behaving good enough he ain't doing nothing wrong enough but the issues of your heart come up in what you see you know better balance said you'd have to kill somebody physical he could kill him by destroying his influence and how you do that by just seen but his ministry he's been in Hsieh all that you know you know is you know you need something deeper yeah he has something yes yes it's just something you know many swords I've been wrecked because people just see things and and people open their mouths and again Liberty to speak I want us to become cautious I'm speaking to the church here but those who are blessed outside it she looks fantastic but let us be a discipline Church that we are very careful with how we use words words are a currency I want you to see word as a currency because every time you speak you are having an impact you could see something tonight listen you know how liberating you would I forgive you are you know how liberating you is I am sorry how powerful those words something you tickets are intimate limiting a long explanation to refill the situation remedies a few simple words can take something that existed for years and brigde penis was associated with that anybody with me tonight he won't ship of your life change trajectory because you see me right thing I'm sorry I forgive you I messed up I didn't mean it that way it's not what I wanted to see and I will work to to bridle my tongue I will work to see it differently I didn't mean to cut it on you can motivate people in different ways you'd have to cut them down to get him to do something anybody with me tonight I'm not gonna be too much longer with you that's a little teaching familiar scripture James same as a perfect man Jim said it was a bright early whole body because he bring his tongue under control mastery of his words mastery of his words and the issue becomes deeper friends because when as seniors or Spearin so as leaders we see things in such a way that younger or the people who are under our influence see that as the behavior we we teach in people you wronged him so there are now second-order consequences because words have meaning words are seeds words have power I have seen I remember was I was younger brother Orbison he went on to be with the Lord I was very house in school every time in secondary school and I met him only ruler husband about Maxie I'm never too welcome to me and see me there but just coughing me my fears kick him in my face he was 40 years older than me and I was there traumatized I've no idea I try to try to figure what he turned the dumber she'd shown off a loop because I couldn't and I realize that there are many things that we have learned from Scripture and the message and stuff like that but in see confronting the issues of life and that's why he babbles he has given us all things with life and godliness your natural life copy one way and it shoots like your spiritual life is this week and people know you're for this your worship I'm telling you no this is not about knowledge of the world you can know the word and see the wrong thing you could know Scripture and say the wrong thing knowing Scripture knowing the word doesn't automatically make you somebody who do use idle words true words for people about people done with your words you embarrass people was it was the objective of trying to hood somebody with with words could be a weapon words could be a weapon a little missing words like an atomic power in wars have been fought over words countries have gone to war over words words use effectively could have stemmed many issues that existed in the world between churches between families between so many situations what could have been decelerated or accelerated because of the bad use of words words deformed allies because it's all seeds anybody with me tonight and the whole ship james using in the nvv energy of a horse which is it it's organic it's alive it's moving it has his own emotions it has his own sentiment it once to go its own way and a small bit rightly manage teams that emotion that energy leave a loss you a runaway you want to know neither horse he will do what he wants but a small bit right in his mouth controlling that mount control the whole animal suddenly an animal that cadets run rampant is brought under subjection because of that control so James is suing now this this this call it this organic side of thing then he goes to thirty inanimate object you see a whole ship doesn't have a life of its own the wind's blowing it whatever weight with but by the control of a small will rod or whatever you call it that you all ship moving the direction of your life of your marriage the direction of your business the direction of your family is controlled by words you have spoken or words you will speak your spiritual progress is determined by what you will see and I will get it because we prophet identified it as well anybody with me tonight even how you pray because how you create is an expression of wood come on now you have to see you write things and you have to stop seeing you wrong things I love reading I love studying I know if you haven't figured up with me and I was reading a book on thinking and they say when you're training at Olympic swimmer there are two approaches to training an Olympic swimmer and this was coming out of a massive study that was done in thinking so they say that when you're training a swimmer high-performing athlete a significant part of the training is focused on telling the swimmer what to do so you improve your stroke this way you put your hand this way you do it this way you breathe in this week that's the significant is all about training of what to do do it this way do it this way but then they said at a certain point you switch the training from what to do to what not to do and they said when you switch and it reads that point of what not to do they begin to talk about this is the mistake to avoid so they said I tell you stop doing that stop doing that stop doing that and in so doing they're cutting away know the weaknesses because you've already who only craft of what to do now we need to remove the things that you may be doing in your life that actually slowing your down in other words these are the things that create friction or resistance in our walk anybody with me so when you're riding if you ever had a bicycle he breaks up a bicycle just closes him and slow the tire down that act of cerini tire down by putting pressure is friction friction so what is slowing down our spiritual lives many times may not be just what we are supposed to be doing but it's things we have to stop doing that's the point I want to make and when you stop saying wrong thing and you stop speaking negativity if you keep speaking negative about your white guru this you I do do this you iCarly's you actually we're doing this whole day there's your story play your song your song is he never do something you will never see her right nothing she will ever do will undermine or overturn or change that perception because you know singing is words and acts like songs are powerful because songs are words in action as well anybody with me but if this same situation you start to see different things you change a whole anointing you change you whole atmosphere you can change you whole inspiration anybody with me try to warm up into something huh Sam's 39 one I said I will take heed of my wheeze listen to dated 30 summers I will take heed of my ways so he know taking consciousness whiz speaking to behavior to conduct I will take heed of my whiz that I sin not with my tongue so he sat a he said to connect his consciousness of his behavior in other words if you know that the situation you're about to face is one that is conflated I will get to the CD wrong you know in in school you have those who stay home back home lucuma back to build a face a woman at home at home at have attended they don't need oh no go ahead go ahead go ahead get a girl again but if you know the situation it's iike some of us we looking for five because we have a point to prove come on now we want to make the point so we took in Warren fire because we want to make the point when David is saying I take heat of my ways and I was I don't want to make that point because if I make that point I don't know how fight will go because in this thing it's an argument I might see something that I could never but I could see sorry you know what the fact that he was left could do damage that could take years to repair anybody with me tonight I'm speaking to young people so how you speak to your parents honor your father and mother that honoring is about respect that uttering is so significant is the only commandment with a blessing that it deals will be long how many lies have been cut short because they never said you right thing their parents how many marriages could have been saved or Hilo in a better place because you write things were not said I wanted to sink I'm gonna go through just three examples really profit and we're gonna bring this teaching to our close tonight and we gonna get into about seeing the right thing we know these stories but this is Bible studies also studies of connecting a message to the scripture as well to the power of what I said well the banner made my new ministry he says though we find later then one day I was going fishing down a deal hollow with some men mr. wood and his brother and they were Jehovah Witnesses and Jess had been converted and baptized into the feet and while we were fishing over against the bank I've told you the story many times dear mr. wood said the banks were that one of our trustees here now said about some old sister that used to feed them a slice of home bread and butter she belong to the Church of good he said Lyle to his brother we ought to go up and tell her that we got saved so they're having a conversation but look at the conversation they have in Twitter Vancity coefficient and one better tell you see Lyle we have to go and tell a woman that we got saved no this gives you a Content good is it this is not idle talk this is talk with substance this is talking meaning and where the madam would follow that by saying you know there's just certain things that we can see that takes a hold with the Holy Spirit my god just certain things that pleased him just right and when we save that thing I want you to notice what you say if we can just find what to see your words judge you your words condemn you or your words will bless you so this teaching tonight is not to cut you down you know this teaching tonight is to change your language change your vocabulary change your phrasing change how you talk to one another change how you approach life change your outlook this you political around the economic remedy for nine children that is not our realm we come from a place with a different language where we come from we move mountains where we come from we talk to lions that's where we come from that language we come from anybody with me tonight so listen to the Prophet you know I want any luck to get my time you know it there's just certain thing that hope this help you so in other words there's a certain thing if you could say it to your wife it's a certain thing you could say to your children this is a certain thing you could say to your husband this is a thing you could see I want to me wrong you know there's there's certain things that we can see and that takes a hold with the Holy Spirit just certain things that pleases him just right and when we say that thing I want you to notice what you say if we can just find what to see it's better you say give me some time to find you right hook I do want to say the wrong thing that is better than to just fly off the handle and say something you will regret your words judge you your words condemn you or your words will bless you and unconsciously I'm going or no banks must have said the right thing for no more than he said that no understand this and up to this point this had nothing to do with a prophet this is a brother talking to a brother ricochet and the Holy Spirit get touched I'm better balanced said for no more than he said that I was sitting in the back of the boot fishing with the fish line for a little bluegill fish to be to put on the line for beats for me and run out a beat and I was catching these little fish on putting them in the bucket for the trapline and when banks said that all of a sudden something struck me so the words that he spoke had an effect even beyond his situation and no hit the Prophet he said something struck me he said the right thing and the Holy Spirit spoke and said does said the Lord you'll find in the next few hours there'll be a resurrection of a little animal so that woods not idle words not random words words about salvation of his soul God was so pleased that he no touch his prophet and say listen he next few hours there'll be a resurrection of a little animal but if Adam said I thought it will be a kitten that I thought my little boy had squeezed too hard and squeezed the breath out of him and I dropped him on the floor before we left I thought that's what it would be but I was surprised in the next morning while we're sitting on the boat I know banks is here I guess Lyle is here if you are raise your hand he comes down with us all the time we know it he caught a fish we know the story with a little long hook he caught a little bluegill fish and it swallowed the hook all the way down and he took a hole at the little fish instead of just taking the hook out it caught so deep I said I'd take any hook OD fish get caught so deep till he pulled his stomach and the intestines and he gives all right out of his mouth and he gets true it into the water just a little fish like we had been fishing with night before and I cut up a hundred of them or more for beat and the little fellow quivered four or five times and tried to work his little mo but he couldn't because he was filled up with a guild and so forth and I said he shot you a little wild a little fella I went ahead fishing thinking nothing about it then God does something so strange all of a sudden I fell they're coming something moved on over the top of them woods the Holy Spirit move down and said stand up said speak to that little fish and it shall have his life again it had been laying there dead for half an hour don't float it back into the weeds I said little fishy I give you a life in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ little fish turn over flipped up and went out to the water just as hard as he could do I stood there not knowing what to do but a bank said is good for us to be here what triggered that he said the right thing now in this same message everybody with me we could take a little more gentle wrap up you know and let's see a mess in my new ministry but if I said now listen don't miss this show you the sovereignty of God he said now while we were talking I said I want to ask you something no this is not with a Branham elysium message he is now at sister happy rides room we know the story so now bring in no you could say any writing tonight you can see the writing tomorrow change your whole life he said I want to ask you something what put those crows out there but the bran and I just testified any hopes that he was eaten there are few people in a holy that's justified of his experience with the squirrels we know the story and he just speaking he said what but no squirrels did there's no squirrels in the woods I had hunted and hunted I'm not the best of hunter but I understand I was a little boy and I had hunted close and they were in the most ridiculous place and in the most ridiculous way I could call them what put them there so you seen them squirrels wasn't any place you normally are it wasn't a ridiculous week and a ridiculous place oh he's seen it had to be something else with him there so he is no testifying he's expressing he's sharing a testimony anybody with me tonight and he said I said I wonder if it is that my ministry fixing to take a change and the God of Abraham is confirming his promise as he did to Abraham when he was on top of the most he's a better man him Ethan talking fellowshiping and he needed a sacrifice for instead of his sons you hover a gyro performed a miracle and placed a lamb a hundred miles back he was a tree to his journey so when I ran I was having a time trying to connect the Ducks together and any ordinary man can walk 25 miles a deed and he lifted up his eyes and saw the mountain far off and went up to the mountain where to the top of the mountain while I ran back in there a sheep why animals could have killed it and then up on top of the monkey where there's no water how did that arounder get a beer so but a brother was seeing what Abraham went through can the truth say man anybody would be tonight to prove to Abraham that he was your over Tyrel so but Abraham saying here am that Abraham offered up instead of Isaac it wasn't common pleas for Iran to be there hallelujah it had to be Jehovah Jireh because it was against the norm for the RAM to be in that place the very God of creation better Bannerman said spoke a lamb into existence no it was no vision he killed a ram and blood came out of the animal it wasn't it was around and I said that same God hallelujah that Jehovah Jireh he's just as much a Hoover Doretta D as he was under monk with Abraham but a Branham clapped his hand three times can still produce an animal to his glory these squirrels was not a vision I sucked them blood came out of them I jest them and eat them there wasn't visions they were squirrels I said that seemed to hover Jireh trying to get his promise over to me in my thickness and dullness of mind he could speak my need into existence the same as he could speak Abraham's need into existence anybody with me tonight listen now where did where where turns he said I know more said that until sister Hattie sitting there crying so but abandoned expressing this and he annoying dropped on in the room and sister haughty here and it is crying he said crying hadn't said a word and she said that's nothing but the truth that's what she said that's nothing but the truth she said the right thing she said just like banks said down there so buddy Branham can Nix what sister Hattie said to when banks and the right thing don't by the riverside anybody with me I heard her voice as it swept from my ears like up into the woods mrs. right sitting back there with her little girl was trying to interpret and I could and that's super annoying thing struck over me said tell Hattie that she's found grace in the sight of God friends that grace she found wasn't even in her behavior that grace she found wasn't based on how much years she in church that grace she found wasn't what her doctrine was that grace you found was none of that that grace was based on the fact that she said the right thing who would have taught said tell her to ask whatever she will then you speak it by this gift into existence whatever she asked it speak it into existence I looked at sister Hattie the first time it was ever performed in a human being I said sister Hattie ask what you will God is going to give it to you hallelujah my you imagine in the presence of the Prophet ask whatever you will what do you want tonight if God with a grand a desire tonight you what do you want tonight God is going to give it to you what do you think of that the congressman says amen does it get into you seven times he had confirmed it by an animal seven is God's complete number he has the first time and a human being he did what he choose some great aristocrat a great foreign minister a poor little with a woman that can hardly write her name God knows what he's doing ask what you will and he said to me brother Branham what do you mean oh yeah it's a happy thing even what do you what do you mean ask anything your heart desires and it shall be produced right here that you will know that the Lord God of heaven answers and his scriptures are true but about him is saying no because he's going to his own experience I wear my first time with the new gift my first anointing I could hardly hear her and she looked around we had been talking about her little crippled sister I said oh no doubt in my heart within a few minutes little eat it will be jumping to the glory of God had he looked around all around and she said brother bill my greatest desire is for the salvation of my two boys what why but everyone said they couldn't have been a greater thing she could have asked for $10,000 she would have got it what if it would have been some millionaire would have acts one another million God known what she was going to ask for sister Hattie at least seven or eight witnesses standing there all you people that was present when that happened raise up your hand everybody in the building was present that happened one two three four five six seven of them Ethan Ethan was present when that happened he said ask what you want to cause God has give it to me to give to you whatever you want she said her boys was beginning to go off on that teenage tantrum and she said the salvation of my two boys and I said by the will of God by the power of God I give you in the name of Jesus Christ your desire and her two boys suck under the power of God and that wall building tremble banks fell into his split Shelly grabbed and Hattie screamed till he could hear her for two blocks and then two boys with tears rolling down their cheeks received exactly what they actual right then Oh hallelujah hmm my my my anybody with me tonight and what what what caused all of that she said right getting ready to close out now nobody random is bringing out and this isn't the message speak to the mountain house in the right thing was his test his test was what he said I'm getting ready to close out he said fred sauceman a friend of mine bosom friend from Canada he said a meeting somewhere was with me a New England campaign just last year and I'm not gonna skip down and when we were standing I stepped to one side and his Spirit of the Lord came upon me and I began to shake and it said the Spirit of the Lord said there's a trap set for you and be careful what you see you see in there a trap is set for you be careful what you see friends Church there are traps that are set every day there are traps that are set for you to see your wrong thing be careful Church take this message to look at your life and see what's coming to you and see the traps that are coming to you and if you take that approach that I'm clear for what I see and he said Fred where you at are you in the meeting that's right and we left there and - but a sudden something streaks and happened and when we got to the meeting that night I said to the audience Oh buddy random to all the people he said remember that's in the Lord there's a trap set for me and all of you pray that I'll know what to do the right I'll know what to do the right thing when this comes to pass and the next night had happened anybody with me tonight the devil sent in two people a young boy and a girl to break up the meeting and that was in not New Hampshire but voom and Freddie you remember the name of the city it was a capital what a moment and we were just across Lake Champlain but the banner was speaking there in the church about the location and when we will not meet this boy the girl looked like some kind of Mongolian girl and the boy they were at least 25 years old a piece but such immoral action ditches he was setting about like this from me and when I started preaching he would just grab her and throw her head back and crime and all this stuff but he balanced said I said young man don't do that you attracting the attention while I'm preaching and he just laughed right out at me so butter madam is now under test he said I taught oh there it is there's the trap right there I went right ahead speaking just the same but I ran i'ma say well I see trap a silly trap and a who else peeking he got so immoral that I could stop again I said don't do that so please if you want to make love to the young lady when you then leave the building this is a religious meeting you shouldn't do that please don't do it while I'm in the while I'm in featured I started again and it just made it worse and then when I turn I said don't and something said to me say what you will and it'll be done I stood there mr. moose a dirty boy and all I'm standing but a fret and many of them standing president the perspiration was just running from me something said see blindness it would be blind see death and they'll pack them out see what you will I couldn't speak I couldn't move and I just left I thought God what must I do and I turned he study on his face while looking at me I thought what must I say then I turned look like before I know what I'd said I said I forgive you of your act and it must have been just the right thing to see it was good trying a reaction on an action that night it was revealed to me that ad said the right thing can the truth salmon so I bring it to you tonight from both the scriptures and to the message we're gonna closer and pray now so I want to kneel down friends we all have and and and we have read it and I say when you see the Bible see all and every is there's no exception I want to nail this down because I would take from you scripture I say unto you that every idle word that men shall speak they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment for by thy words thou shalt be justified and by thy words thou shalt be condemned James brought this tape using examples of a horse and a ship something that was alive and something that was built and gave the example that the tongue is that controlling element that controls all of your life control your tongue you control your destiny control your tongue you control your relationships you control your tongue you control your family life if your tongue defiles your house you're in trouble your tongue can destroy or it can build up you can see the right thing we use the quotes to sure that a little brother just testifying of the goodness of God in his life he's he gonna tell that woman we not the way we used to be we're gonna tell that woman something came over me we're gonna tell a woman is a change in my life and buddy Brennan said that that please only goes so much that it brought an anointing upon the prophet and a word upon the prophet and a fish was given life back triggered by seeing the right thing we saw the prophet testifying of the squirrels being created and he's testifying only anointing that what he saw with his squirrels had to be the same thing like Abraham and the RAM but it didn't make sense that is the what that wasn't normal it has to be Jehovah Jireh and a little humble with a woman a little humble lady said that's nothing but the truth when you say the right thing tonight when you say the right thing tomorrow will you say the right thing when you are in trouble we go when were to Brandon had his test he had an option he could have said anything and God would have honored you word of his prophet because a prophet is a mouthpiece of God go over back him up but gloried also testing him and he said the right thing I want to serve our heads in prayer tonight and with the Branum he was praying in the same message my new ministry and I guess they were praying for one another or people coming up as to the audio or depending he said not every one of you not only ministers but all of you or to pray for these people you don't know what God might do for you while you pray for somebody else what if you'd say the right thing so that one message where the banner must focus on saying the right thing he said here's a woman standing here that's so sick they have to haul her up what if your prayer would be the right thing just like banks said the right thing like Hattie said the right thing what if you would say the right thing your prayer to cause God to come down and do something see this is not just one person this is the Church of the Living God everybody now everybody be in prayer so let's just bow our heads for with a prayer tonight and I want you to catch a burden and I want this to see the right thing but amantha you don't know if the wouldn't you see would be the right thing to touch somebody tonight the Bible said if two shall agree touching anything we could have what we asked for Heavenly Father tonight we come as needy people law just fellowshipping or own your scriptures Lord we took it from James the largest portion of Scripture where you spoke on this subject true you serve on James Lord and we found true Scripture nor where you brought it out how it is so important for us to say the right thing how there's so much power in the tongue that we can see the right thing we could say words that could build up or we could say the wrong thing and say word that will destroy help us tonight father Lord to be the kinds of sons and daughters the kind of believers the kinds of Christians Lord that we would say the right thing Lord not just the right thing to each other or to other people but you would say the right things even to ourselves Lord it's so easy for us to see negative things about ourselves but give us a strength and a bonus father like you taught us that even the weak could see I am strong help us to speak positively I shall be healed by your stripes I'm healed help us to speak that we shall overcome help us the theater our brothers and our sisters you're gonna make it hang in there you are more than a conqueror father good I pray that the Holy Ghost would drop down into every room into every life Lord have a burden Lord for brokenness and broken relationships between parents and children who have not spoken for some time Lord strain relationships Lord of families who they can't even remember what the cause was of the of the destruction in their homes Lord but may you give grace to your children to see

Lord me you continue speak Lord to each of us tonight Lord me you minister to marriages tonight Lord marriages that have been held back by Lord the father the husband seeing the wrong thing the mother

we want we cannot do what we want we cannot act how we want father Mira ships of our lives be brought into subjection into control lorry hand over control the control tower to the Holy Ghost tonight Lord may you come down and touch us Lord as the Prophet said Lord he didn't know how but the word just came what I forgive you because something something stirred in him Lord God he didn't place there

spiritual maturity may we grow from strength to strength to not just bring the members of our body of the subjection but all of us under subjection Lord even to the extend any apostles only did what
