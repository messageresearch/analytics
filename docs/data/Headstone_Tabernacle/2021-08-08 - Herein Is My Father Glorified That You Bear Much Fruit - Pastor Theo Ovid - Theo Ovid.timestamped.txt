[4:21] name we ask it amen and amen god bless
[4:23] you
[4:24] so if you have your bibles this morning
[4:26] i'd like to turn to sin john chapter 15.
[4:28] i want to read from verse one to eat we
[4:31] want to read from sin mark
[4:32] 4 verse 26 to 29
[4:37] and also we want to read in john chapter
[4:39] 12
[4:40] verse 24.
[4:43] uh saint john 15
[4:48] reading from boston i am the true vine
[4:49] my father is a husband man
[4:51] every branch of me that bear it not
[4:53] fruit he take it away
[4:54] every branch that beared fruit he pushes
[4:56] it that it may bring forth more fruit
[4:59] now you are clean through the word which
[5:01] i have spoken unto you
[5:02] abide in me and i knew now we know this
[5:05] is jesus speaking right
[5:07] as the branch cannot bear fruit of
[5:08] itself except abide in the vine
[5:11] no more can ye accept you about in me so
[5:14] this year is the secret
[5:16] you must abide in him i am the vine one
[5:19] you are the branches two he that abides
[5:22] in me and i in him the same bringing
[5:24] forth much fruit
[5:25] so the condition for much fruit is
[5:27] abiding for without me
[5:29] you can do nothing if a man of by not in
[5:32] me is cast forth as a branch
[5:34] and is riddled men gather them and cast
[5:36] them into the fire and they're burned
[5:38] if you abide in me in my words abiding
[5:40] you shall ask what you really shall be
[5:42] done unto you
[5:43] hearing is my father glorified that you
[5:46] bear much fruit
[5:47] so shall you be my disciples and in
[5:49] amplified they have when you bear or
[5:51] produce much fruit
[5:52] my father is honored and glorified and
[5:54] you show
[5:55] and prove yourselves to be true
[5:58] followers of mine
[6:00] said mark 4 reading from verse 26
[6:04] jesus again and he said so is the
[6:07] kingdom of god
[6:09] as if a man should cast seed into the
[6:11] ground
[6:12] and should sleep and rise night and day
[6:15] and the seed should spring and grow up
[6:17] he'd know what not how for the earth
[6:20] bring it forth fruit of itself first
[6:24] the blade then the air
[6:27] after that the full corn in the ear
[6:30] but when the fruit is brought forth
[6:33] immediately
[6:35] he put it in the sickle because the
[6:38] harvest has come
[6:39] our last scripture from saint john
[6:41] chapter 12 verse 24 verily where i sent
[6:43] to you
[6:44] jesus again speaking except a corner
[6:46] wheat fall into the ground
[6:48] and die to abide it alone but if it die
[6:52] it bringeth forth much fruit may god
[6:53] bless his word you may be seated
[6:56] or it's great to be here today and by
[6:58] the scriptures
[6:59] i believe you know where i'm going
[7:00] tonight and
[7:02] the title i have is here it is my father
[7:04] glorified that you bear
[7:06] much fruit herein is my father glorified
[7:09] that you bear much fruit
[7:10] and the subject when the fruit is
[7:13] brought forth
[7:14] the harvest is come an inspiration but
[7:17] if it die
[7:18] it dies the seed it brings forth
[7:21] much fruit so that is conditional
[7:25] if it die if it don't die it abide alone
[7:29] but if it dies the sea that is it
[7:32] bringing forth
[7:33] much fruit so that is conditional on
[7:36] that seed
[7:37] dying out okay so this is a prophecy
[7:41] and this is brother branham i want you
[7:44] to notice
[7:44] a really close something just happened
[7:48] malachi 4 is to bring back
[7:53] back to the original talk about it right
[7:56] now
[7:56] she is spitting from the church from the
[7:59] bloody church body
[8:00] spreading with her master for the same
[8:02] purpose
[8:03] she is the word just as joseph was
[8:06] spitting from his brethren
[8:07] because he was the word and jesus was
[8:10] smitten from his brethren
[8:12] because he was the word the church the
[8:14] bride is smitten
[8:16] from the church because she is the word
[8:20] so the church is the church but the
[8:22] bride
[8:23] is the word there's your stages again
[8:28] one two three see just exactly the word
[8:32] living and in action the bible bride
[8:36] i love that the word living and inaction
[8:39] the bible bride not some man-made bride
[8:43] the bible bride smitten afflicted of god
[8:47] no beauty we should desire her and but
[8:49] yet
[8:50] we did a steamer smitten afflicted of
[8:53] god that's right
[8:54] she stands alone she is smitten from all
[8:56] denominations
[8:57] according to revelation 3 she's smitten
[8:59] out of the louisiana church age
[9:01] she was raised up in this church was
[9:03] raised up
[9:04] in the loud recent church age that's the
[9:06] husk can't you pentecostal see that
[9:08] he said if the stalk had to die if the
[9:12] tassel had to die
[9:13] so must the husk die stands alone like
[9:17] the bridegroom
[9:18] rejected of men despised and rejected of
[9:21] the churches
[9:22] the bride stands that way
[9:26] what is it it's his masterpiece see
[9:29] here we go here the interpretation of
[9:31] that it's the word
[9:33] that he can work through made manifest
[9:37] that is a masterpiece the word that he
[9:41] can work through
[9:42] may manifest so the stalk
[9:46] the tassel the husk never become
[9:49] seed not at the harvest time oh glory to
[9:53] god i love this
[9:54] the seed is back to its original life
[9:58] back to the bible oh glory to god some
[10:01] point in time
[10:02] it has to go right back to the bible at
[10:05] the harvest time
[10:07] the seed is back to its original life
[10:11] back to the bible malachi 4 said it
[10:13] would be that way
[10:14] my you must have all the word isn't that
[10:17] right
[10:18] it must have all the word oh praise the
[10:20] name of the lord
[10:22] oh praise god is that the word he said
[10:24] where are we at
[10:25] there's only one thing the office is
[10:27] here she is dead right
[10:28] she is ready now for the coming and
[10:30] that's the prophecy
[10:32] there's only one thing the harvest is
[10:34] here that's prophecy
[10:35] she is dead right she is ready for the
[10:38] coming
[10:39] so when will we be ready for the coming
[10:41] when we are
[10:43] dead right that means we are really
[10:45] ready
[10:46] for the coming when we are dead right do
[10:48] you believe that this morning
[10:50] oh blessed be the name of the lord so he
[10:52] said now at the harvest time
[10:55] the seed is back to its original
[10:58] condition
[10:59] and must have all the word in order to
[11:02] be
[11:02] the seed now you can't have half a seed
[11:05] it won't grow it's got to be the whole
[11:08] seed
[11:09] it's got to manifest and say i believe
[11:11] in the baptism holy ghost
[11:12] i speak in tongues no that's just part
[11:14] of the seed
[11:15] and now added to that see
[11:19] the life not the gifts
[11:22] the life of the gifts see what i mean we
[11:25] are the end time brethren
[11:26] so the taste in the believer's heart
[11:30] should be for the life
[11:33] the life of the seed that was sown
[11:37] scripture hallelujah we read it
[11:41] and for the he said no watch so is the
[11:43] kingdom of god
[11:45] they saw mark four we read this as if a
[11:46] man should cast seed into the ground
[11:48] and should sleep and rise night and day
[11:50] and the seed would spring forth and grow
[11:51] you know and how all right so to see
[11:54] springfield and grow
[11:56] but what sense does it make for the
[11:59] farmer
[12:00] to go out if the seed just spring and
[12:03] growing
[12:05] he goes out in nothing he has to wait
[12:08] for it to bring forth or unfold
[12:11] for the earth bring forth fruit of
[12:13] itself this is the laws of god now
[12:16] nobody could break it first the blade
[12:19] one
[12:20] then the air two after that the full
[12:23] corn in the
[12:24] air tree but then number four
[12:27] but when the fruit is brought forth
[12:29] immediately
[12:30] he put in the sickle because the harvest
[12:32] has come so god is not going to reap
[12:35] green god is not going to reap stalk
[12:39] and tassel and husk he's going to wait
[12:42] for
[12:42] the fruit and that's what we get into so
[12:45] the blade
[12:46] justification looter the air
[12:48] sanctification wesley
[12:50] the full corn in the air the bathroom
[12:52] only goes to pentecostal but now the
[12:53] fruit
[12:54] which is what the prophet brought the
[12:55] full word to bring forth the fruit
[12:58] word made flesh back in the bible bride
[13:01] oh praise the name of the lord now we
[13:03] type three women
[13:05] we know it praise god sarah
[13:08] hager and mary and mary had the seed
[13:12] and mary was like the husk but the seed
[13:14] was christ inside of there right
[13:16] so three denominational ages or carriers
[13:19] must die and dry up just like the shock
[13:22] and so forth
[13:23] to give room for the seed oh this is
[13:25] real now
[13:26] the seed cannot get ripe until the shock
[13:30] stalk leaves all dry
[13:34] it sucks every bit of the life in them
[13:37] out
[13:38] plus praise god no it is sea time
[13:42] or bright time so this is the word now
[13:44] it is sea time
[13:45] or bright time notice in harvest time
[13:48] you can't change your seed
[13:50] whatever the seed is that is what it
[13:53] will
[13:54] produce oh we're living in dangerous
[13:56] times now you have to know what seed
[13:58] inside of you
[13:59] hallelujah the sharks are dead prophecy
[14:02] the shocks are dried up
[14:03] diversion time not touched it's virgin
[14:07] a virgin would time if you put in the
[14:09] hands of a denomination it won't be a
[14:11] version
[14:11] it will be manhandled time you get it
[14:14] but god
[14:15] church is not touched by the nomination
[14:18] all praise god regardless of what
[14:20] ministers say so-called apostles
[14:21] so-called prophets
[14:22] so-called evangelists so-called pastors
[14:24] whatever they say
[14:26] god's real bright church will not be
[14:27] touched because jesus himself said
[14:29] upon this rock i will build my church
[14:31] not mandolin church
[14:33] but god himself building that church and
[14:35] that church is built by revelation
[14:37] not by group thinking we
[14:40] here do this we do that it's not that
[14:42] he's building a church on he's building
[14:44] his church by revelation
[14:45] oh praise god so he said hallelujah how
[14:48] wonderful i love it
[14:49] i know it's the truth it will not be
[14:51] touched there will be no
[14:53] denominational manhandling
[14:56] in the virgin birth of the bride oh
[14:58] glory to god look at that there's a
[15:00] powerful one
[15:01] there'll be no denominational
[15:03] manhandling
[15:04] in the virgin birth of the bride you
[15:07] mean the bride has to be beaten
[15:09] yes not church joining a message the
[15:12] birth of the bride hallelujah no she is
[15:15] commanded of
[15:16] god to come out of such touched not the
[15:18] unclean thing
[15:19] oh my that's from the seed not here with
[15:21] the church the shock
[15:23] praise god another scripture context
[15:25] trip i had
[15:26] james 5 7-9 be patient there for
[15:29] brethren
[15:30] unto the coming of the lord i think i
[15:32] believe i read this in the prayer
[15:33] meeting friday
[15:34] be patient there for brethren unto the
[15:36] coming of the lord
[15:38] behold the husband man waited
[15:41] for the precious fruit of the earth he's
[15:44] not waiting to look how
[15:46] how bountiful the seeds pop up or the
[15:49] seeds are growing
[15:50] no he is waiting for the fruit of the
[15:53] earth
[15:53] watch and had long
[15:56] patience for it until he received
[16:00] the early and the latter rain now
[16:03] there's a reason i just love
[16:05] how the scripture places this the
[16:07] husband man
[16:09] okay waiting for the precious fruit of
[16:11] the earth
[16:12] he could only wait because he knew that
[16:15] he has planted the seed
[16:17] and every seed has to bring forth after
[16:20] its kind
[16:21] he had patience for it he's unhurried
[16:24] because he know according to nature the
[16:27] life
[16:27] of the seed has to unfold
[16:31] and as the life unfold it reveals itself
[16:35] so if you want to know what kind of tree
[16:36] what kind of tree is that
[16:38] well let it grow what kind of seed is
[16:40] that plant it
[16:42] let the life unfold it have a law
[16:45] of the life being unfolded by stalk
[16:49] by tassel by fruit and when the fruit
[16:52] comes
[16:52] then you know what kind of tree it is
[16:55] and then the verse eight of that
[16:56] scripture says
[16:57] be also patient so the husband is
[17:00] patient
[17:01] and you are exhorted to be patient
[17:04] establish your hearts
[17:05] for the coming of the lord jordan 9 and
[17:08] then
[17:08] an exhortation in verse 9 grudge not
[17:11] against
[17:12] another brethren least she be condemned
[17:15] behold the judge stand it
[17:17] before the door so in harvest time your
[17:19] behavior
[17:20] and your attitude towards one another is
[17:23] a big
[17:24] issue it's a big count let's continue
[17:27] and this is from the associations i
[17:29] believe and i've said a moment ago
[17:31] that the false vine came into full
[17:34] fruition in this age
[17:36] her fruit would mature and ripen
[17:40] that is correct this evil-spirited
[17:43] church
[17:45] full of iniquity will be revealed
[17:48] as the mustard seed that grew into a
[17:50] tree
[17:51] where enlarge the falls of the air and
[17:54] her head
[17:55] will be the antichrist the mystery of
[17:58] iniquity
[17:59] all this is true and if this is true
[18:04] then it must also be true that the
[18:06] bright church will mature
[18:08] hallelujah on that the bright church
[18:11] will mature
[18:13] and her rightness shall be an
[18:16] identification
[18:17] with a lord by means of the word
[18:21] and her head who will come to her is the
[18:23] mystery of godliness
[18:24] which indeed is christ and as the false
[18:28] church with all cunning and diabolical
[18:30] power
[18:31] made up of political force physical
[18:34] force
[18:35] and demons of darkness come against this
[18:38] true vine
[18:39] the true vine here we go the true what
[18:42] true vine with the fullness of the
[18:46] spirit and the word
[18:48] will do the very acts of power that
[18:51] jesus did
[18:52] oh glory to god hallelujah who doing
[18:54] that
[18:55] the true vine what scripture is that i
[18:58] am the true vine
[19:00] my father is the husband man now i
[19:03] notice now and we said it before
[19:06] the devil is not even in the picture
[19:10] it had no lucifer in the picture it had
[19:12] no rome in the picture
[19:14] it have no antichrist in the picture
[19:17] this scripture
[19:18] this has to do direct with the elect
[19:21] with the people that claim to be
[19:23] connected to christ
[19:24] i am the vine the true vine not just
[19:28] mine
[19:29] my father is a husband man so i'm
[19:31] declaring to you
[19:33] who is the husband man i am the true
[19:35] vine
[19:36] any branch in me that don't produce cut
[19:39] off
[19:40] no fruit cut you off oh brother ovid we
[19:44] have to bear fruit
[19:45] exactly oh glory to god hallelujah
[19:49] even didn't bear fruit in the first
[19:50] outer court or in the holy place
[19:53] but when that went into the shekinah
[19:55] glory when that went into the presence
[19:57] of god
[19:58] into that supernatural light it brought
[20:00] forth olives
[20:01] and blossom and almonds hallelujah why
[20:05] it was in the presence of that kind of
[20:07] glory
[20:08] it was identified by god isn't that
[20:10] right so let's read it again
[20:12] the true vine with the fullness of the
[20:15] spirit
[20:16] fullness and the word
[20:19] will do not we'll talk
[20:22] not we'll teach we're talking about the
[20:25] true vine
[20:26] with the fullness of the word charity
[20:30] is the bride's absolute charity is the
[20:33] cap
[20:34] of the pyramid the thing that can fail
[20:37] and to get to dear as a process at a
[20:40] fair virtue
[20:41] under virtual knowledge and the
[20:43] knowledge temperance
[20:45] under temperance patience and godliness
[20:47] and brotherly kindness
[20:48] what we're doing you're going right up
[20:50] to the fullness
[20:52] of the spirit the fullness of the word
[20:55] will do the very acts
[20:56] of power that jesus did then as she
[21:00] nears her headstone becoming
[21:03] like him through the word jesus
[21:07] will come that the bride and groom may
[21:09] be forever
[21:10] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[21:14] but what about the true seed the people
[21:18] of god
[21:19] are being made ready by the word of
[21:23] truth
[21:24] from the messenger to this age in her
[21:28] this bride will be the fullness of
[21:31] pentecost
[21:32] for the spirit will bring the people
[21:35] right back to where they were
[21:37] at the beginning and that is thus saith
[21:39] the lord oh give the lord a shout
[21:41] nobody could cut that off and say we
[21:43] have this pentecostal thing and this
[21:45] penis said no no this is the word you
[21:47] know
[21:48] right back the people of god
[21:51] are being made ready you know i was
[21:53] thinking about this being made ready
[21:54] what's the purpose of if somebody know
[21:57] the exact
[21:58] date of the coming of the lord the
[22:00] pastor revealed the date and the hour
[22:02] and the moment
[22:03] and they have a big revelation we know
[22:04] we know it's coming oh we know we know
[22:07] the date the month
[22:08] the hour the year whatever
[22:11] and they're not ready it's a waste of
[22:14] time
[22:15] so that date is not relevant
[22:18] the very day is not relevant or even
[22:21] important
[22:22] it's about getting ready and when you're
[22:25] ready
[22:26] it doesn't matter which day it is the
[22:28] day does not matter
[22:30] if it's 20 more years 40 more years 100
[22:32] more years
[22:33] two more years six months it doesn't
[22:35] matter because you are ready
[22:36] but the bible said his wife had made
[22:39] herself ready
[22:40] so the key is not the date is that
[22:43] information
[22:44] or even in connection with the minister
[22:46] of this information
[22:47] which is lucifer hallelujah but
[22:50] is really becoming ready back the word
[22:55] oh let's continue it is thus saith the
[22:58] lord but ram
[22:59] for that is what joel 236 26 says
[23:03] then he quote the scripture be glad and
[23:04] he turned his hand rejoice in the lord
[23:06] your god
[23:06] for he had given you the former reign
[23:08] moderately and he will cause prophecy to
[23:11] come down for you
[23:12] the rain the former and the latter in
[23:15] the first month
[23:16] and the floor shall be full of wheat and
[23:18] the fat shall be overflow with wine and
[23:20] oil
[23:20] and i will restore to you the years the
[23:23] locusts have eaten
[23:24] the conqueror on the caterpillar the
[23:25] pamu my great army which i sent among
[23:28] you
[23:28] and you shall eat in plenty and be
[23:31] satisfied
[23:32] and praise the name of the lord your god
[23:35] that i just want to live with you and my
[23:36] people shall never be ashamed now it
[23:38] says god
[23:39] is going to restore the lutheran age did
[23:41] not restore the church
[23:42] it started the reformation the western
[23:44] age did not restore
[23:45] the pentecostal age did not restore but
[23:48] god
[23:49] has to restore for he cannot deny his
[23:52] word
[23:53] this is not the resurrection of the
[23:55] church this is the restoration
[23:57] to restore is to go back to what it was
[23:59] before
[24:00] let me say it again to go to restore is
[24:03] to go back to what you had
[24:07] your former state or condition
[24:10] god prophecy now okay
[24:14] god will take the church right back to
[24:16] pentecost of the beginning
[24:18] oh that is something to shout about man
[24:20] oh god i could hear the believers in the
[24:22] whole shouting
[24:23] god taking you right back to pentecost
[24:25] no minister
[24:26] no force anointed could stop the bride
[24:28] from going right back to pentecost
[24:30] no let no man lie to you and tell you
[24:32] they have no pentecost to go back to
[24:34] this is it here the western ages that we
[24:36] store
[24:37] the pentacles earlier did not restore
[24:39] but god has to restore
[24:41] for you cannot deny his word this is
[24:44] not the resurrection of the church it is
[24:47] the restoration
[24:49] god will take the church right back to
[24:52] pentecost at the beginning
[24:54] notice in 25th it tells why we need
[24:57] restoration
[24:58] the lucas the conquer womb the
[25:00] caterpillar pam
[25:01] are eating all but the root now we are
[25:04] told that all these insects are one and
[25:06] the same in different stages
[25:08] different stages they are the antichrist
[25:12] spirit
[25:13] manifested in organization denomination
[25:17] and false doctrine through the ages
[25:20] and that poor little roots talk is going
[25:23] to be restored
[25:24] god isn't going to plant a new church
[25:27] it's going to bring back
[25:28] his original plantain back to the
[25:31] original seed
[25:32] he is doing it he is starting it by the
[25:35] teaching
[25:36] oh give the lord a shout or the four
[25:38] marine next will come the harvest rain
[25:41] or rapture and fate oh that's a big bomb
[25:45] next will come what harvest rain
[25:48] or rapturing fate he's restoring it what
[25:51] by teaching or for marine
[25:55] next will come the harvest rain or the
[25:58] rapture
[25:58] of rapture and feet so the harvest rain
[26:02] that comes at harvest time together the
[26:05] fruit of god
[26:07] is rapturing fate so now you could see
[26:09] that the bride is really going in the
[26:11] rapture
[26:11] because when the harvest has come he
[26:13] said put quickly the sickle
[26:15] and reap because the fruit has come oh
[26:18] hallelujah
[26:19] so when god's seeing the fruit he's
[26:21] ready to put in the sickle
[26:22] immediately hallelujah and harvest that
[26:24] bride
[26:25] oh glory isn't that wonderful this
[26:27] morning
[26:29] oh no the seed must be planted
[26:33] and then it must have water
[26:36] in order to grow so you know the secret
[26:39] is right
[26:40] the word is in the bribe how the wood
[26:42] get there seas was planted into the
[26:44] bride
[26:45] what kind of seeds promises
[26:48] promises that was brought by 20th
[26:50] century prophet promising the holy ghost
[26:52] promised adoption promise you
[26:53] deliverance promise to heal
[26:55] by these promises we will become
[26:57] partakers of the divine nature
[26:59] not our seeds we suppose you be eunuchs
[27:02] we're not supposed to have our seed of
[27:03] our interpretation
[27:04] or what we think he's saying and we you
[27:06] know it come to me and
[27:08] i see it so i know i don't see it so it
[27:10] has to be what god said
[27:12] this spoken word is original seed
[27:17] say it in your home the spoken word is
[27:20] the original
[27:21] seed what spoken word what the
[27:24] municipality pulpit
[27:25] no not that the spoken word
[27:29] original seed is what came out the mouth
[27:32] of the prophet
[27:34] because the prophet mouth is the mouth
[27:36] of god man
[27:38] channeling by bread alone but by every
[27:40] word that proceeds of the mouth of god
[27:42] and the mouth of god is as prophets and
[27:44] under that mount of god of other men
[27:47] to echo the same prophecy
[27:50] that the prophet spoke that's why he
[27:52] said the spirit the prophet and the
[27:54] bride
[27:54] will say the same thing and what they
[27:57] say will already be said in the word
[27:59] can be no newton it's the same thing all
[28:02] glory to god have no man bringing no
[28:04] extra mystery
[28:05] hallelujah all the mysteries has been
[28:07] unfolded
[28:08] all the mysteries have been revealed as
[28:11] you're being taught
[28:12] under for marine anointing the seed
[28:14] going into you
[28:15] these promises these spoken promises put
[28:18] your seed
[28:19] no interpretation with it so hear this
[28:21] now this seed must be planted that's
[28:22] number one
[28:23] but number two it must have water in
[28:26] order to grow
[28:26] so you can't be in love with the teacher
[28:28] in love with the pastor he love how he
[28:29] does say it and love what he explained
[28:32] thy seed that his word but he'd have to
[28:34] have water for it to grow
[28:36] just as much as you need seed is just as
[28:38] much too much water
[28:39] and see this word and water is
[28:41] inspiration
[28:42] oh glory to god see this word and water
[28:45] is the anointing
[28:46] see this word but water is your watering
[28:49] with your praises
[28:50] so if there's no praises and blessing
[28:52] and worship
[28:53] there is no water to that seed it's just
[28:56] intellect
[28:58] just flesh getting mysteries flesh
[29:00] getting teachings
[29:02] flesh getting revelation or
[29:03] interpretation or knowledge
[29:05] hallelujah that's why john was in the
[29:07] spirit
[29:08] that's how we have to be in the spirit
[29:10] oh hallelujah
[29:12] did you say well brother branham i'm
[29:14] going to express your thought thought
[29:15] here
[29:15] we have had water so baron pick up
[29:17] somebody thinking we have water you say
[29:18] so be it
[29:19] that's correct you have had the water
[29:21] you ever plant cabbage or anything or
[29:22] seeds
[29:23] other like that usually they got water
[29:25] there just pour a little on them right

[31:19] and that's what they have gotten the
[31:20] pentecostals one more pentecostals
[31:22] that's what they're going to get
[31:24] but the word is going to produce sons
[31:26] and daughters of god
[31:27] not message believers not church members

[31:52] word again he said mori
[31:54] which means teaching in other words it
[31:57] will be a teaching ring
[31:58] and a harvest rain we have had
[32:02] the teaching rain and we are ready now
[32:05] for the harvest rain you know the first
[32:08] rain is when you plant the seed
[32:10] and start your crop growing oh here the
[32:12] bomb down
[32:13] but just before it matures
[32:16] then comes another crop irene that is
[32:19] called the harvest rain
[32:21] we know when it is oh my god the spring
[32:24] rain and then about june it makes a crop
[32:27] and the rain we find out was the spirit
[32:31] and people fighting the spirit they want
[32:33] men
[32:35] with words that tickling their ears the
[32:38] bible talking about the last days silly
[32:39] woman
[32:40] leading with lust heaping unto
[32:42] themselves teachers
[32:44] having itchiness they want to know if
[32:46] there's any numerous
[32:47] mystery coming forth hidden mystery
[32:49] underground mystery
[32:51] deep mystery all kind of mystery they
[32:53] want and it keeps the
[32:55] grey matter going hallelujah not the
[32:58] heart matter
[32:59] but the gray matter in the head going so
[33:01] listen friends
[33:02] we have had teaching rain you say but we
[33:04] have to be ready now ready now for the
[33:05] harvest rain
[33:07] hallelujah the first rain is when you
[33:09] plant the seed
[33:11] and starts a crop going but just before
[33:13] it matures
[33:15] hallelujah praise god it has to have a
[33:18] lattering
[33:19] just before it matures because when the
[33:22] fruit is comfort hallelujah the harvest
[33:25] has come
[33:25] and when you have this community habits
[33:27] are written you have to go and reap it
[33:29] you have to put in the sickle quickly oh
[33:32] glory to god and take that bride home
[33:34] take that bride away or are you getting
[33:36] along and to be fruit bearing
[33:38] oh how you don't want to be a tree you
[33:40] want to be a fruit
[33:41] let's continue hallelujah fruit bearing
[33:45] maturing right then first john 2
[33:50] we did from verse 12 to 14 scripture
[33:53] john i write unto you little children
[33:56] because your sins are forgiven you for
[33:59] his name's sake
[34:01] 13 i write unto you fathers because you
[34:03] have known him
[34:04] that is from the beginning i write unto
[34:07] you young men
[34:08] because you have overcome the wicked one
[34:10] i write into your little children
[34:12] because you have known the father
[34:16] verse 14 i've written unto you fathers
[34:18] because you have known him that is from
[34:20] the beginning
[34:21] i've written unto you young men because
[34:23] you are strong
[34:25] and the word of god abides in you and
[34:27] you have overcome
[34:29] the wicked one and the amplified
[34:32] it reads i'm writing to you little
[34:33] children because for his name's sake
[34:36] your sins are forgiven pardon to his
[34:38] name on account of confessing his name
[34:41] i am writing to you fathers because you
[34:43] have come to know
[34:45] recognize be aware of and understand
[34:48] him who existed from the beginning i'm
[34:51] writing to you
[34:52] young men because you have been
[34:53] victorious over the wicked one
[34:56] i write to you boys or lads because you
[34:59] have come to know and recognize and be
[35:01] aware of the father
[35:03] so that children again in verse 13 is
[35:05] not the same children
[35:06] in verse 12. verse 14 i write unto you
[35:09] fathers because you have come to know
[35:11] recognize be conscious of and understand
[35:14] him who existed from the beginning
[35:15] i write to you young men because you are
[35:17] strong and victorious
[35:18] and the word of god is always abiding in
[35:20] you in your hearts
[35:22] and you have been victorious over the
[35:24] wicked one so therefore these
[35:26] oh my these four groups here four groups
[35:30] speaks of spiritual development the
[35:33] first is babes in verse 12
[35:34] newborn infants greek word tanika
[35:38] newborn infants little children they are
[35:41] rejoicing
[35:43] because their sins are forgiven can't do
[35:45] nothing much with that
[35:47] that's one level next level two
[35:50] the children in verse 13 hallelujah
[35:54] they know the father and that knowledge
[35:57] doesn't give them the ability to do
[35:58] anything for god with the knowledge of
[36:00] god and that greek word is paddier
[36:02] which is like a a higher child a bigger
[36:05] child
[36:06] a grown-up child the amplified called
[36:08] lad the third is the young
[36:11] who god said they are strong and
[36:13] overcome the wicked one and the thought
[36:15] is the fathers
[36:16] adopted sons the fathers who know him
[36:19] from the beginning
[36:20] the fathers will come true place of
[36:21] trying tutoring
[36:24] sanctification maturing so god's
[36:27] objective
[36:29] by these four stages of development
[36:32] is to bring us into fatherhood in other
[36:34] words when you are child you can rule
[36:37] but under truthism governors until the
[36:39] time appointed by the father
[36:41] so god's program is always to bring
[36:44] someone into maturity even the plants
[36:48] all around the whole thing is to bring
[36:50] you to your to produce
[36:53] fruit hallelujah to come into your full
[36:56] potential
[36:57] so the fathers who knew him from the
[36:59] beginning and god take them higher
[37:02] not knowing what god is doing but why
[37:04] he's doing it
[37:06] isn't that something else praise the
[37:08] name of the lord
[37:09] so let's look again i said in john 15. i
[37:11] know you will be tired let me read that
[37:12] scripture but this scripture is so
[37:14] important
[37:14] i like how it squeezes out the devil oh
[37:17] the devil is not in the picture at all
[37:19] is you as a believer being committed to
[37:22] see this word
[37:22] revelation of what you're supposed to
[37:24] connect with so is this not no brother
[37:27] no elder no pastor you have no excuse
[37:28] with the scripture
[37:29] none we have no issues all of us we have
[37:33] no
[37:34] excuse before sam john 15.
[37:37] i am the true vine my father is a
[37:39] husband man
[37:40] every branch in me that bear it not
[37:41] fruit he take it away every branch that
[37:44] buried fruit he purchased it
[37:46] to bring forth more fruit so number one
[37:49] is as fruit
[37:50] or i say number one no fruit pudding
[37:54] cut off number two if you bring fruit
[37:57] you can approach it
[37:58] to bring forth more fruit and then we
[38:02] find out
[38:02] that he want much fruit
[38:06] so there is no place for us to be we
[38:08] have arrived
[38:09] we are here we are it we have
[38:13] it it have no it here with that you have
[38:15] to come to much fruit
[38:17] because hearing is my father glorified
[38:19] let us read the whole thing here now
[38:20] now you are clean through the word which
[38:23] has spoken unto you
[38:24] abide in me and i knew as the branch
[38:27] cannot be a fruit of itself except at a
[38:29] bar in the vine
[38:30] no more can he accept you by me so he's
[38:32] telling you straight here you can't go
[38:34] on your own
[38:35] you could say you are the branch and the
[38:36] battle produce the fruit you know the
[38:38] vine to produce the fruit and the
[38:39] brightness branch and you and you are
[38:41] the french
[38:42] yeah go on your own if you go on your
[38:46] own you'll be a dead branch because the
[38:48] life flows
[38:50] from the vine into the branch to produce
[38:53] the fruit
[38:54] oh glory to god are you with me now so
[38:56] he said abide in me and i
[38:57] knew as the branch cannot bear fruit of
[39:00] itself
[39:01] except it abide in the vine no more can
[39:03] he accept you by
[39:05] me he is not talking about abiding in a
[39:07] church
[39:09] he is not talking about abiding in a
[39:11] group or abiding in a camp
[39:14] he's not talking about that people have
[39:15] to come on the camp and come out of the
[39:17] group to abide in him
[39:18] because he grew up binding them and
[39:19] tying him up he's not going to abide in
[39:22] him
[39:22] they have no devil deal abiding in him
[39:26] he said i am divine yeah the branches
[39:29] he that abideth in me and i am him the
[39:31] same bringeth forth
[39:32] much fruit oh glory to god hallelujah
[39:36] for without me you can't do nothing if a
[39:39] man abides not in me
[39:41] he is cast out of the match and is
[39:43] withered
[39:44] and men gather them and cast them into
[39:46] the fire and they are burned
[39:48] if he abideth me hallelujah and my
[39:52] words abide in you you shall ask what
[39:55] you will
[39:56] and it shall be done unto you so that is
[39:59] evidence of abiding
[40:00] a man can't talk he abides and there's
[40:02] no evidence of abiding
[40:04] this is the whole thing about it the
[40:06] evidence is dear
[40:07] if he abided me and my word abide in you
[40:10] you shall ask what you will hearing is
[40:13] my father glorified

[42:12] much fruit jesus already lose the key
[42:16] hallelujah death when i say dead death
[42:18] to self
[42:21] death to the human spirit debt to what
[42:23] we think are what we feel
[42:25] this is not a phrase this is the only
[42:28] way
[42:29] he point them to calvary glory to god
[42:32] the greeks came and said sirs we would
[42:34] see jesus
[42:36] the disciples didn't take them in a
[42:37] corner and show them the private
[42:38] interpretation
[42:39] or the private revelation no they
[42:41] brought them straight to jesus
[42:42] which a true minister will do and when
[42:45] they came to jesus you say i am he
[42:47] look at me i'm the messiah no he said
[42:49] look at calvary
[42:50] because you cannot really see me the way
[42:52] you should see me
[42:54] except you go to calvary that death
[42:56] takes us to the cross
[42:58] where you die your life is crucified
[43:02] hallelujah your human spirit crucified
[43:04] your trade spirit is busted and
[43:06] crucified
[43:08] you're not training that spirit rub down
[43:09] with the word or rub on like a rubbing
[43:11] something
[43:12] and he trained a spirit there no the
[43:14] trainer spirit ripped apart
[43:16] hallelujah to be placed with his spirit
[43:19] that's why he said a new heart i'll give
[43:20] you
[43:21] a new spirit and my spirit coming behind
[43:23] that new spirit
[43:25] that's why he said that claude hearth is
[43:28] desperately wicked
[43:29] who can know it but god let's continue
[43:34] my lord matthew 13.
[43:38] be back to the bible reading from verse
[43:41] 24 jesus speaking
[43:44] my god i'm looking forward for that
[43:46] bible study on tuesday
[43:48] jesus speaking not a problem but he
[43:51] fought unto them saying
[43:52] the kingdom of heaven is like not a man
[43:56] which sowed good seed in his field but
[43:58] while
[43:59] men slept his enemy came
[44:02] and so tears among the wheat went his
[44:05] way
[44:06] and when the blade was sprung up broad
[44:09] fought
[44:09] fruit then appears the tears also
[44:13] so the servant of the house allah came
[44:14] and said sir this that
[44:16] now so good seed and i feel from whence
[44:20] then had it tears
[44:22] and he said to them an enemy had done
[44:23] this the servant said
[44:25] will now then that we go and gaze them
[44:28] up
[44:29] he said nay least while you guard up the
[44:32] tears you root up the wheat
[44:34] with them let boat
[44:37] grow together until the harvest
[44:42] and in the time of harvest i will say it
[44:45] to the reapers
[44:46] gather you together first the tears bind
[44:48] binding and bundles to
[44:50] burn them but carry the wheat into my
[44:52] ban
[44:53] don't touch them when they're going
[44:55] through the process
[44:56] don't touch them when the life is
[44:58] unfolded
[45:00] touch them only when they produce in the
[45:03] time of harvest
[45:04] oh glory to god hallelujah in other
[45:07] words
[45:07] when their fruit is identified
[45:12] then they could bring in the reapers or
[45:14] give the lord some praises
[45:16] so jesus in matthew 13 36
[45:20] he is going to interpret this parable to
[45:22] them
[45:23] because he was only dropping parables
[45:25] dropping mysteries in the
[45:26] form of parables so matthew 13 verse 36
[45:30] jesus
[45:30] then jesus sent the multitude away
[45:34] went into the house and the disciples
[45:36] came unto him saying declare unto us
[45:39] the parable the tears on the field he
[45:41] answered and said unto them
[45:43] he that soweth the good seed is the son
[45:45] of man oh glory to
[45:46] god that is luke 17 30.
[45:50] even though shall the son of man be
[45:51] revealed that is all seven seals
[45:54] like all the sin has been unfolded to
[45:56] this malachi for end time elijah prophet
[45:58] he is the soul of the good seed oh
[46:00] hallelujah
[46:01] we can only take seeds from elijah
[46:04] we can't bring our own seeds if we bring
[46:07] our own seeds
[46:08] we become our own messenger oh glory to
[46:11] god but we going into the barnyard
[46:14] hallelujah of stored up food and
[46:17] breaking it out from the
[46:18] from the storehouse hallelujah and
[46:21] releasing it to you
[46:23] so watch that's where jesus said he
[46:26] answered them
[46:27] he that swear the good seed is the son
[46:28] of man
[46:31] [Laughter]
[46:33] my god listen to jesus word carefully
[46:36] now
[46:37] he that soweth the good seed is the son
[46:38] of man
[46:40] the feel is the world
[46:43] and all of a sudden jesus switched
[46:47] the good seed are the children of the
[46:50] kingdom
[46:52] so he put it from seed to children
[46:56] from seed to people good seed
[46:59] oh does he love to make you shout this
[47:01] morning the good seed
[47:03] at the children of the kingdom and the
[47:05] tears are the children of the wicked one
[47:08] so not just see those people hallelujah
[47:12] the enemy that saw them is the devil the
[47:14] harvest is the end of the world
[47:17] and the reapers are the angels
[47:20] as therefore the tears are gathered and
[47:22] burned in the fire
[47:23] so shall it be in the end of this world
[47:27] so listen friends it doesn't matter what
[47:29] preachers pipe and they fight their own
[47:31] interpretation
[47:32] until the fruit come forth we are we
[47:35] have to wait
[47:36] because the reapers are coming until the
[47:40] fruit is produced
[47:41] and the fruit is not message churches
[47:43] the fruit is not having a picture of the
[47:45] pillar fire over ram head
[47:47] and a cloud in the back of the church
[47:49] and i'm really messing with
[47:50] any bride that's not it that's the
[47:53] interpretation of it that's not it
[47:55] or are we not taking a vaccine to win
[47:57] the bride well take over instead
[48:00] you don't want any vaccine take over
[48:02] that's your choice up to you
[48:04] as if that make your bride and them who
[48:06] they will take the vaccine something
[48:08] wrong with them they're probably taking
[48:09] the market because they're off
[48:10] they're seeing revelation that is
[48:12] nonsense
[48:15] wait let me let me go there i ain't
[48:17] coming favor that
[48:18] okay so but i'm speaking message all to
[48:20] see the discrepancy
[48:22] and i went down and found the word
[48:23] discrepancy and i got the dictionary
[48:26] and looked what the word discrepancy
[48:28] means it means so in discord
[48:30] or being contrary so sowing discord or
[48:34] something else
[48:34] being contrary to what has already
[48:38] been hallelujah notice
[48:41] who he said that the swords were and
[48:43] what the seed was
[48:44] the sower was he the son of god is but
[48:47] abram who went forth to win seed
[48:49] and then he came from behind him which
[48:51] was the devil saw the seed of
[48:52] discrepancy behind
[48:53] so in the right seat friends that has
[48:56] happened to every age
[48:57] what is he saying after the prophet left
[49:01] then come the seed of discrepancy then
[49:03] came men
[49:04] to sow different seeds after the prophet
[49:08] left
[49:09] while the prophet was wrong they
[49:10] couldn't come up with the foolishness
[49:11] but after he left
[49:13] then come the enemy to sow different
[49:15] seeds and that is why we have so much
[49:17] variance today
[49:19] in this message i call it variance now
[49:22] all right okay so now he said the seed
[49:26] of god the word of god
[49:27] jesus said in a certain place the word
[49:29] is a seed
[49:30] word seed i never see the ringword after
[49:33] the sky
[49:34] no so balarama is tying it both together
[49:37] if the christian the children of god
[49:41] the children of the kingdom has become
[49:43] the seed of god
[49:45] then they must be the word of god so
[49:47] this word
[49:49] oh my that be preaching is not dead
[49:52] letter
[49:53] this word has to become flesh so the
[49:56] people
[49:57] the elect the bride become the seed
[49:59] itself
[50:00] that's why the bright seed word bride
[50:02] bible bride
[50:03] is given from church colonel members
[50:06] fleshly carnal
[50:08] church bench warming people killing time
[50:11] for years
[50:12] with a religious spirit on them
[50:16] catholic rebuke correction instruction
[50:18] discipline nothing
[50:19] they just want to take what they want
[50:22] dance
[50:23] sing say amen hallelujah rejoice but
[50:26] when coming to obey
[50:29] that's different that's why he said if
[50:31] it dies
[50:33] it bring it forth much fruit you might
[50:35] be a seed
[50:36] but if it stay by itself it'll by the
[50:38] lord
[50:39] no it takes debt to produce hallelujah
[50:43] isn't that right
[50:44] so watch if the christian the children
[50:47] of god
[50:48] the churn of the kingdom has become the
[50:49] seed of god there must be the word of
[50:51] god
[50:52] the word of god manifested in the age of
[50:56] living in
[50:57] for the promised seed of that age god
[50:59] gave his word at the beginning and each
[51:00] age had its seed
[51:02] it's time it's promises now we live
[51:05] through luther's age wesley age
[51:07] methodist age all along through the ages
[51:09] and the pentecostal age and each age
[51:11] is given a promise of the word and the
[51:14] people of that age here we go
[51:15] that manifest that promised word is
[51:19] the seed of that age not the people of
[51:22] that age that explain
[51:25] but manifest what you mean
[51:29] this word brought by this end time
[51:31] prophet messenger is to be manifested
[51:33] of course when jesus came there was a
[51:36] ton of scriptures
[51:37] jesus couldn't pick up anyone that
[51:38] identified who he was
[51:40] he found the place where it was written
[51:43] the spirit is upon me for he anointed me
[51:46] to do this
[51:46] that that that that he found the exact
[51:49] place
[51:50] then he said this day what you're
[51:51] reading here is fulfilled
[51:53] in your ear there's no longer a
[51:55] scripture it's no longer a text in the
[51:57] book
[51:58] it's no longer isaiah right that what
[52:00] isaiah prophesy is now here
[52:02] in other words this is that that the
[52:04] prophet isaiah spoke of
[52:05] peter said this is that that the prophet
[52:07] joel speak of
[52:08] we have to say this is that that the
[52:10] prophet william random speak of
[52:12] not some other man oh glory to god god
[52:15] sent one messenger to this end time
[52:16] behold i send you elijah the prophet oh
[52:19] glory to god do you believe that to say
[52:21] so the manifestation of the holy spirit
[52:25] operating through his children is though
[52:29] seed of the kingdom at that age he
[52:32] didn't say the manifestation
[52:33] of the holy spirit operating behind the
[52:34] pulpit or behind the pastor or being
[52:36] evangelist or whoever
[52:37] be operated in his children
[52:41] that means they came from child young
[52:44] lad
[52:45] young men into fathers
[52:48] enter spiritual adoption spiritual
[52:50] maturity isn't that right
[52:52] so notice the tears was the one the
[52:54] enemy satan also discovered
[52:56] or the seed of discrepancy he was the
[52:58] one guilty of doing this horrible thing
[53:01] satan saw the sea from the beginning and
[53:04] when god placed his first harvest of
[53:06] human beings upon the earth
[53:07] adam of course had a knowledge of the
[53:09] truth of right and wrong
[53:10] but he never completed us yet so satan
[53:13] is still controlling
[53:14] the ministry of disinformation i think
[53:16] last week i think i said somebody who
[53:18] said don't take that vaccine don't take
[53:20] that vaccine well the person who told
[53:21] that person don't take the vaccine they
[53:23] are now dead
[53:24] they called the trainer and said don't
[53:26] tell me vaccines you know
[53:28] they are not doctor the hell they're
[53:29] scientists they're not involved in the
[53:31] medical protection
[53:32] profession but they're influencing
[53:34] others don't take it you know now they
[53:35] come and die
[53:37] oh hallelujah praise god my lord
[53:40] praise god jeremiah 17 10 i the lord
[53:44] search the heart i try the reins
[53:48] even to give every man according to his
[53:51] ways
[53:53] according to the fruit of his doings
[53:56] according to what the fruit
[53:59] of his doing proverbs 11 30
[54:02] the fruit of the righteous is the tree
[54:04] of life and he that winneth souls is
[54:07] wise
[54:08] the fruit of the righteous is what a
[54:10] tree of life psalms 1
[54:12] blessed is the man that walketh not in
[54:14] the counsel of the ungodly
[54:16] no standing in the way of sinners nor
[54:18] sitting in the seat of this country
[54:19] but his in the light is in the law of
[54:21] the lord and in his law
[54:22] dirty merits a day and night he shall be
[54:27] like a tree planted by the rivers of
[54:30] water
[54:31] that bringeth forth his fruit in his
[54:34] season
[54:35] his leaf also shall not wither and
[54:37] whatsoever he do it shall prosper
[54:40] oh glory to god hallelujah matthew 7
[54:43] verse 17
[54:44] to 20. jesus speaking even so
[54:48] jesus every good tree bringing forth
[54:51] good fruit
[54:54] and the corrupt tree bringing forth evil
[54:56] fruit
[54:57] and yet above now a good tree cannot
[55:01] bring forth evil fruit neither can a
[55:05] corrupt tree
[55:06] bring forth good fruit every tree
[55:09] that bringing forth not good fruit is
[55:11] huge
[55:12] and cast into the fire wherefore by
[55:15] their fruits
[55:17] you shall know them oh glory to god i'll
[55:20] be coming along to that hour now
[55:21] because you see we come to the hour now
[55:23] where people can't change their seed
[55:26] they have the hatred they hold in
[55:28] grudges and oats
[55:30] think about it now coming down to the
[55:31] harvest time
[55:33] sowed on with this thing and always
[55:36] started produce
[55:38] all the pastors that saw their wicked
[55:40] evil seeds in the people
[55:42] against groups against other ministers
[55:43] and whatnot they have a harvest coming
[55:46] it will hit them right back because that
[55:48] is the seed that they saw
[55:50] what was given to them by the prophet is
[55:52] brotherly kindness look it right there
[55:54] the blood for the age spirit of
[55:56] forgiveness that was given
[55:58] say something nice say something good
[56:01] say something loyal if you have nothing
[56:03] good to say shut up
[56:04] it's that simple keep your spirit clean
[56:08] away from evil anger temper
[56:11] oh hallelujah oh blessed be the name of
[56:14] the lord notice
[56:16] the life that comes out the original
[56:19] seed
[56:20] comes through different processes three
[56:23] different processes
[56:25] oh and then turns back to its original
[56:27] condition
[56:28] oh blessed be the name of the lord hear
[56:30] what the prophet said the life
[56:31] that was in the husk in the stalk in the
[56:34] tassel
[56:35] gathers up in the seed and the life that
[56:38] was in the stalk
[56:38] one went to make the other justification
[56:41] made away for signification
[56:43] san signification made away for the
[56:45] baptism of the holy ghost and the
[56:46] baptism of the holy ghost
[56:47] made a way for the holy ghost itself to
[56:51] come down into perfection
[56:52] and back to the word again to manifest
[56:55] itself
[56:57] this part is very important
[57:00] the baptism made a way for the holy
[57:03] ghost
[57:04] to come down in perfection back to the
[57:08] word
[57:08] to manifest itself but the branham
[57:11] continues
[57:12] you notice when the seed goes into the
[57:14] ground it's the original seed
[57:17] when it comes forth it brings forth a
[57:20] life
[57:21] but what does the life do out of the
[57:24] seed of wheat
[57:25] it doesn't produce the same stock of
[57:27] wheat right then
[57:29] or the same grain on wheat it's the life
[57:33] of the wheat so it's cellular about the
[57:35] processes so when the seed goes on the
[57:36] ground it's original
[57:38] you put the seedling on the ground but
[57:40] out become a seed
[57:41] or come a stalk so now all this talk
[57:45] the tassel the leaves become carriers of
[57:48] the life
[57:50] the life of a destination the
[57:52] destination of the life
[57:54] is to reproduce itself in multiplied
[57:57] form
[58:00] so you have one corn seed and you plant
[58:03] that corn seed
[58:04] no you're not expecting one corn seed
[58:06] back when you put that corn seed the
[58:08] life
[58:09] of that corn seed start to unfold itself
[58:12] stalk leaves getting stronger more
[58:15] mature it's getting taller
[58:17] what are they going to do give you a
[58:19] full a of corn
[58:21] with multiple multiplication of itself
[58:24] hallelujah are you with me now all right
[58:27] so then he's showing
[58:29] what this church is all about and when
[58:32] you see it
[58:32] you see the mystery of god being
[58:34] unfolded in such simplicity
[58:36] the church ages is really the unfolding
[58:39] of the life
[58:40] and all these ages have been part of the
[58:42] caries of the life
[58:43] so the sea that we're known into the
[58:44] ground must come back to the original at
[58:46] the end
[58:47] because that's the destination of the
[58:49] life the life have nowhere else to go
[58:52] it can't stop at looter it can't stop
[58:54] it's a pushing then nominate and fall
[58:56] off
[58:56] then i'm on it it fall off it keep
[58:58] pushing because it's going back to the
[58:59] original
[59:00] oh glory to god hallelujah watch notice
[59:04] they were virgins talking about them
[59:09] they did not have the holy spirit so
[59:11] they must be in the bride
[59:13] talking about the foolish virgins they
[59:15] were virgins
[59:17] but foolish they believe their message
[59:19] but they're foolish
[59:20] they have the books on tape but they're
[59:22] foolish they love the pastor but they're
[59:24] foolish
[59:25] they love the church they're foolish
[59:27] they love the singing
[59:28] the songs but they're foolish they love
[59:32] the channel the children the channel the
[59:34] past saying
[59:35] but the foolish because it doesn't
[59:37] matter what channel here
[59:38] or the church or the people in is if
[59:40] they have the holy ghost
[59:42] hallelujah so if they think they have it
[59:45] to have
[59:46] it they still need it to be part of the
[59:48] bride
[59:49] so notice now they were virgins they did
[59:53] not have the holy spirit
[59:55] so they miss being in the bride
[1:00:01] not they they had they didn't take the
[1:00:03] vaccine on anybody
[1:00:05] you say you're talking about now because
[1:00:07] people feel they're on because they're
[1:00:08] taking bacteria
[1:00:10] you know they can say they're not taking
[1:00:11] a vaccine but they can't say i ain't
[1:00:12] taking any covering them
[1:00:14] because it come they have no choice with
[1:00:17] it
[1:00:18] had to deal with it but these here now
[1:00:21] they did not have the holy spirit so
[1:00:23] they miss being in the brine
[1:00:25] while the five wines who had oil became
[1:00:27] part
[1:00:28] of the bride but these people being a
[1:00:31] separated god loving people trying
[1:00:35] to abide in the word according to what
[1:00:38] they knew of it
[1:00:40] and being a help in the work of the lord
[1:00:43] will come up at the end of time they
[1:00:46] will miss the millennium
[1:00:48] which you can begin to see by these
[1:00:51] truths
[1:00:51] is much more important and wonderful
[1:00:54] than we ever taught or believe
[1:00:56] hallelujah
[1:01:00] don't gamble give me all
[1:01:04] in my lamb to keep me burning hallelujah
[1:01:07] give me all in my lamp i pray
[1:01:11] yes give me all in my lamp to keep me
[1:01:14] burning
[1:01:16] keep me burned until the break of day
[1:01:19] what you said because of iniquity the
[1:01:20] love of many gonna wax cool
[1:01:22] and you see this pandemic here something
[1:01:25] that works called something dead
[1:01:28] some drop out not back school you know
[1:01:30] they go on
[1:01:32] they accept hallelujah fall off the
[1:01:35] track
[1:01:36] hallelujah whatabrana
[1:01:40] this is deep i know you heard this
[1:01:42] before
[1:01:43] let's hear it again we would liken the
[1:01:46] church through the ages to the wheat
[1:01:47] plant
[1:01:49] a grain of wheat is planted to the end
[1:01:52] that a single grain of wheat will
[1:01:54] reproduce and multiply itself through
[1:01:56] certain processes
[1:01:57] during a certain period of time the
[1:02:00] singer seed that single seed
[1:02:01] will die but in dying the life that was
[1:02:04] in it
[1:02:05] will come up into the plant which in
[1:02:07] turn will be the bearer
[1:02:09] or the carrier of that life which is to
[1:02:13] come back to originality
[1:02:15] in a multiplied form
[1:02:18] jesus the great royal sea died that much
[1:02:21] this one
[1:02:22] who is the life of the church stand in
[1:02:25] the midst of the church
[1:02:26] for all seven churches giving his life
[1:02:28] to the church
[1:02:30] the carrier or the bearer to the end
[1:02:33] that his very life will be reproduced in
[1:02:36] bodies like unto his in the resurrection
[1:02:39] it is in that resurrection that the
[1:02:41] royal seed will see many royal seeds
[1:02:43] like unto himself and they will be even
[1:02:46] as he is for john said
[1:02:47] we shall be like him this is what john
[1:02:50] the baptist was referring to when he
[1:02:51] said that jesus would gather the wheat
[1:02:53] into the ghana
[1:02:54] that was the resurrection where the
[1:02:56] redeemed who have been elected in the
[1:02:58] eternal life come in
[1:03:00] then the record of this wheat plant
[1:03:05] whose end is to reproduce the original
[1:03:07] seed
[1:03:08] in multiplied form is the book of life
[1:03:12] i repeat the history
[1:03:15] or record of this wheat plant
[1:03:18] is the book of life of which
[1:03:22] a part of the book of life is the record
[1:03:25] of eternal life
[1:03:26] a section of the book of life this
[1:03:29] is convincingly seen by examining the
[1:03:32] wheat plant
[1:03:33] our beer seed is sown sooner blade is
[1:03:36] seen
[1:03:36] that's not the wheat yet it grows into a
[1:03:39] stalk
[1:03:39] that's not the wheat yet life is deer
[1:03:42] but not the wheat
[1:03:44] watch then at the end of the stalk is a
[1:03:48] spike
[1:03:48] send out a tassel still a wheat plant
[1:03:51] but no wheat yet
[1:03:52] so your car said it not in a message you
[1:03:54] can't say it or believe
[1:03:56] but you're heading down towards fruit so
[1:03:58] as we get down to the end of the tape
[1:04:00] you're running like a wrong distance
[1:04:01] at the end of that tape you have to
[1:04:03] produce fruit
[1:04:04] not just fruit more fruit not just more
[1:04:07] fruit
[1:04:07] much fruit because herein is my father
[1:04:10] glorified
[1:04:11] are you with me so then the land the
[1:04:13] plant is pollenized
[1:04:15] we see shaft grow it looks mighty like
[1:04:17] the wheat but it's not seed
[1:04:19] then forms a wheat a husk it is now back
[1:04:22] to what it was originally
[1:04:24] now the ripened wheat is harvested so
[1:04:27] jesus died
[1:04:28] he gave his life that life was to come
[1:04:31] back upon the church
[1:04:33] and bring many sons like unto himself
[1:04:36] into the glory of the resurrection but
[1:04:38] as the weed seed had to have a carrier
[1:04:41] to bring forth multiplied with seed even
[1:04:45] so
[1:04:45] there had to be a church which should be
[1:04:47] a carrier
[1:04:48] of the life of jesus christ as the blade
[1:04:52] stalked tassel and husk
[1:04:55] were carriers for the seed but not the
[1:04:58] seed itself
[1:05:00] so the church cooperate through the ages
[1:05:03] has been a carrier of the true seed do
[1:05:05] not deceit itself
[1:05:07] that is why we can say the book of life
[1:05:10] is the whole wheat plant but there's a
[1:05:13] section of that book
[1:05:14] hallelujah that's the bright section
[1:05:16] that's the eternal section
[1:05:18] oh glory to god he said let's go over
[1:05:20] that again here's the original seed that
[1:05:22] was planted
[1:05:23] it produced a blade that wasn't it it
[1:05:25] produced a stalk
[1:05:26] not that either here come the husk in
[1:05:28] which the wheat is the form
[1:05:29] the tassel appears then pollen falls on
[1:05:32] those pistils
[1:05:33] part of the plant is quickened something
[1:05:35] of the original seed that came through
[1:05:37] the rest of the plant
[1:05:38] turns into seed why didn't the whole
[1:05:40] plant go into seed
[1:05:42] because it was created to that end
[1:05:45] just part of that plant can go back into
[1:05:47] the bean seed
[1:05:48] because just part of that wheat plant is
[1:05:51] eternal life
[1:05:52] wheat so that's the ordination of god so
[1:05:55] there are people that started this
[1:05:56] message in the 70s they're not around
[1:05:58] in the 80s they're not around in the 90s
[1:06:00] they're not wrong but you are here
[1:06:03] oh glory to god you're alive and kicking
[1:06:05] you're one of them who
[1:06:06] who who them who are alive and remain
[1:06:09] the hallelujah
[1:06:10] oh glory to god you should be shouted in
[1:06:13] your house right now
[1:06:14] you are one of them who are living
[1:06:15] remain hallelujah praise god
[1:06:18] thank you jesus so the whole thing is
[1:06:22] original oh my thank you jesus
[1:06:25] so jesus christ died was planted
[1:06:29] he died that the life that was in him
[1:06:33] came up through the wheat plant and is
[1:06:36] reproducing itself
[1:06:38] in molecules of wheat seeds having the
[1:06:40] same life in them
[1:06:42] and being like the original and he had a
[1:06:44] bomb because
[1:06:46] by spirit they are original
[1:06:50] by what by spirit the original
[1:06:53] so what the devil couldn't see the life
[1:06:56] coming forth
[1:06:57] hallelujah all the grant the branches
[1:06:59] grafted in
[1:07:00] that get cut off but their life keep
[1:07:02] going up because it's a promise
[1:07:04] life at the top of the tree oh praise

[1:07:43] vacation brought back the back
[1:07:44] doctrine of holiness what brought back
