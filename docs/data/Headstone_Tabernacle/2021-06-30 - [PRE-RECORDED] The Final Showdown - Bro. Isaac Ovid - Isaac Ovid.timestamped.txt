[25:28] anthony with the worship service
[25:32] so if you have your bibles would you
[25:34] turn with me
[25:35] to three portions of scripture
[25:39] i have quite a bit of reading but i do
[25:41] want to get it all in
[25:43] so that we can deal with the subject
[25:47] at hand i want to start in the new
[25:49] testament then we'll
[25:51] go to the old testament so we're going
[25:53] to read from hebrews
[25:55] chapter 12 and we're also going to be
[25:58] reading from
[26:00] first kings 17 and
[26:04] 18.
[26:07] hebrews 12 and verse 25
[26:12] see that he refused not him that
[26:15] speaketh
[26:16] for if they escape not to refuse him
[26:19] that speak on earth much more shall not
[26:22] we escape
[26:23] if we turn away from him that speaketh
[26:26] from heaven
[26:27] whose voice then shook the earth but now
[26:29] he had promised saying yet
[26:31] once more i shake not the earth only but
[26:34] also heaven
[26:36] and this word yet once more signified
[26:39] the removing of those things that are
[26:42] shaken
[26:43] as of things that are made that those
[26:45] things which
[26:46] cannot be shaken may remain wherefore
[26:50] we're receiving a kingdom which cannot
[26:52] be moved
[26:53] let us have grace whereby we may serve
[26:56] god acceptably with
[26:57] reverence and godly fear for our god
[27:01] is a consuming fire
[27:04] and reading from first kings 17
[27:08] and reading verse 1 first kings 17
[27:12] and reading verse 1 and elijah the
[27:16] tishbite who was of the inhabitants of
[27:18] gilead said unto ahab
[27:21] as the lord god of israel live it
[27:24] before whom i stand there shall not be
[27:27] due
[27:27] nor rain these years but according to my
[27:31] word
[27:32] and reading first kings 18 and reading
[27:35] verse 1.
[27:36] i'm gonna read a bit here i might stop
[27:39] and then have us
[27:40] finish it but let's start and it came to
[27:42] pass after many days that the word of
[27:45] the lord came to elijah in the third
[27:47] year saying go
[27:48] show thyself unto ahab and i will send
[27:51] rain
[27:52] upon the earth and elijah went to show
[27:54] himself unto ahab
[27:56] and there was a sore famine in samaria
[27:58] and ahab called obadiah which was the
[28:01] governor of his house
[28:02] now obadiah feared the lord greatly for
[28:06] it was so when jezebel cut off the
[28:08] prophets of the lord that
[28:09] obadiah took 100 and hid them by 50
[28:13] in a cave and fed them with bread and
[28:15] water
[28:17] and ahab said unto obadiah go into the
[28:19] land unto
[28:20] all foundings of water and unto all
[28:22] brooks per adventist
[28:24] we may find grass to save the horses and
[28:26] mules alive
[28:27] that we lose not all the beasts so they
[28:30] divided the land between them to pass
[28:32] throughout it
[28:33] ahab went one way by himself and obadiah
[28:36] went another way
[28:37] by himself and obadiah was in the way
[28:40] behold elijah met him and he knew him
[28:43] and fell on his face and said add thou
[28:46] that my lord elijah
[28:47] and he answered him i am go tell thy
[28:50] lord behold
[28:51] elijah is here what a way to introduce
[28:53] yourself
[28:54] tell your boss that elijah is here and
[28:57] he said what have i
[28:58] sinned this is over there speaking that
[29:00] darwin has delivered thy servant
[29:02] into the hand of ahab to slay me as the
[29:06] lord thy god live it there is no
[29:08] nation or kingdom whether my lord had
[29:10] not sent to seek thee
[29:12] and when they said he is not there he
[29:14] took an oath of the kingdom and nation
[29:16] that they found did not
[29:17] and now thou sayest go tell thy lord
[29:20] behold elijah is here
[29:21] and it shall come to pass as soon as i
[29:24] am gone from thee that the spirit of the
[29:26] lord shall carry me with her i know not
[29:29] and so when i come and tell ahab that he
[29:32] cannot find thee
[29:33] he will slay me but i serve and fight i
[29:36] save and fear the lord from my youth
[29:39] was it not told my lord what i did when
[29:41] jezebel slew the prophets of the lord
[29:43] how i hid a hundred men of the lord's
[29:45] prophet by 50 in a cave and
[29:47] fed them with bread and water and now
[29:49] thou say yes go tell thy lord behold
[29:52] elijah is here that he may slay me
[29:54] and elijah said as the lord of hosts
[29:56] liveth before whom i stand
[29:58] i will surely show myself unto him today
[30:01] so obadiah went to meet ahab and told
[30:04] him and ahab
[30:05] went to meet elijah and it came to pass
[30:07] when abraham saw
[30:09] elijah and a that ahab said unto him ado
[30:12] he that
[30:13] trouble it israel and he answered i have
[30:15] not troubled israel but dao and thy
[30:17] father's house
[30:19] in that he have forsaken the
[30:20] commandments of the lord
[30:22] and thou hast followed belham now
[30:24] therefore
[30:25] send and gather to me all israel unto
[30:27] mount carmel
[30:28] and the prophets of baal 450 and the
[30:31] prophets of the groves 400 would eat at
[30:34] jezebel's table so he have sent
[30:36] unto all the children of israel and
[30:38] guarded the prophets together
[30:40] unto mount camel and elijah came unto
[30:43] all the people and said how long
[30:45] hold he between two opinions if the lord
[30:48] be god follow
[30:50] him but if baal then follow him and the
[30:52] people answered him not a word may the
[30:54] lord have a blessing to the reading of
[30:56] his word
[30:57] you may be seated amen
[31:01] so i have a title this morning
[31:04] and my title is the final showdown
[31:08] and i have a subject placed by fire
[31:12] into the kingdom that cannot be moved
[31:15] and an inspiration
[31:16] let the god that answer by fire
[31:20] let that god be god everybody feeling
[31:24] fine
[31:25] so today we're going to talk about the
[31:27] fire we're going to talk about the holy
[31:29] ghost we're going to talk about
[31:30] the time of the manifestation of the
[31:32] holy ghost and we're also going to
[31:34] talk about the final showdown because
[31:37] the fire is coming to claim individuals
[31:40] into the kingdom the claiming is not by
[31:42] the church the claiming is not by the
[31:44] group the
[31:45] claiming is not by the pastor the
[31:47] claiming is by
[31:48] fire because the fire of god will place
[31:51] you
[31:51] into a kingdom his kingdom a kingdom
[31:54] that cannot be moved a kingdom
[31:56] that cannot be destroyed a kingdom that
[31:58] always was that always is and
[32:01] always will be a kingdom with a king who
[32:04] is the i am that i
[32:05] am he is the king of kings and the lord
[32:07] of lords and today
[32:08] the holy ghost charity itself is here to
[32:11] place individuals
[32:13] into that kingdom the bible said and we
[32:15] read it everything
[32:16] that can be shaken will be shaken
[32:19] churches
[32:20] will sheikh ministers will shake church
[32:22] members
[32:23] will shake politicians will shake the
[32:25] government
[32:26] will shake the police force will shake
[32:28] the criminals
[32:29] will seek men's heart failing for fear
[32:32] but the false anointed
[32:34] they will shake also your family will
[32:36] shake
[32:37] but not you fear not little flock it is
[32:40] my father's pleasure
[32:42] good pleasure to give unto you something
[32:44] give unto you a kingdom
[32:46] an entire kingdom where he is king and
[32:49] you are priests and you are princes
[32:51] and you are sons of the king so we have
[32:54] a reason this morning to smile
[32:56] we have a reason this morning to be
[32:58] happy don't tell me that i should be
[33:00] sad i may not have money in my pocket
[33:03] right now
[33:03] but my father is the king he is the king
[33:06] of kings
[33:07] he is the lord of lords he is the
[33:10] majesty
[33:11] he is bigger than your problem he is
[33:14] bigger than your triumph
[33:16] he is bigger than your situation he
[33:18] called you for a purpose
[33:20] for such a time as this for a final
[33:23] showdown
[33:24] oh we have waited a long time for this
[33:27] but i hear the clock ticking
[33:29] coming to an end we about to break from
[33:32] time into eternity
[33:34] but before we leave this place up
[33:36] there's going to be one more rider
[33:38] there's going to be one more battle
[33:40] every day is a battle
[33:42] when you wake up in the morning it's a
[33:43] battle when you lift your hand it's a
[33:45] battle
[33:46] brother branham said whenever you lift
[33:48] your hands you are defying gravity
[33:50] it's a battle it's a showdown when you
[33:53] pray it's a battle
[33:55] when you worship it's a battle that's
[33:57] why the bible says
[33:58] bring the sacrifice of praise praise is
[34:01] a sacrifice
[34:03] because it's a sacrifice to worship when
[34:05] you don't feel like worshiping
[34:07] it's a sacrifice to lift your hands up
[34:09] when you feel there's no reason to do so
[34:12] but you bring a sacrifice of praise up
[34:14] into the house of the lord
[34:16] and you offer up incense to him because
[34:19] you acknowledge
[34:20] that we are creatures of eternity we are
[34:23] trapped in time
[34:24] but one of these days time will be no
[34:27] more
[34:28] time will finish can the church say
[34:33] but before we leave this place there's
[34:35] going to be another showdown
[34:37] god loves a showdown the devil made the
[34:40] mistake
[34:41] way back before the beginning way back
[34:44] there
[34:45] he got angels to worship him and there
[34:47] was war in heaven
[34:49] and there was a showdown in heaven it
[34:51] started there
[34:52] but we were represented here with
[34:54] michael so when michael drew his sword
[34:57] sons who rotated off of the presence of
[35:00] god
[35:00] who were gene attributes of god who had
[35:03] the dna from
[35:04] god they were compelled to draw their
[35:07] swords
[35:08] also if there was no question about it
[35:11] it was
[35:11] instinct for us because we are
[35:15] just like god we are just like our
[35:18] father
[35:18] so when michael drew his soul you drew
[35:21] your
[35:22] sword also the devil wants you to forget
[35:25] that you are a warrior he wants you to
[35:27] forget
[35:28] that you are a fighter he wants you to
[35:30] forget that you are a trained soldier
[35:33] this is not new to you this is not
[35:35] strange to you
[35:37] this is what you were doing where was
[35:39] tau
[35:40] when i lay the foundations of the and
[35:42] the morning stars sang
[35:44] together and the children of god shouted
[35:46] for joy
[35:47] this is what we were doing worship is
[35:51] not strange to us
[35:52] up giving god praise is not foreign to
[35:55] us
[35:56] this is what we do this is who we are
[35:59] we are born to worship we are born to
[36:02] give him praise
[36:03] we are born to kick the devil out of our
[36:06] homes
[36:07] out of our families out of our bodies of
[36:10] cancer has got to go diabetes
[36:13] has got to go sickness has got to go
[36:17] why because this is what we do we cast
[36:21] devils out we cast demons out in jesus
[36:25] name come the church amen
[36:40] hallelujah this is the last service for
[36:42] the year
[36:43] the last sunday service so i'm gonna
[36:45] give it all i got
[36:47] i'm gonna give it everything i got i
[36:49] want to let the devil know
[36:50] i don't care how january was how
[36:53] february was
[36:54] how much was how april was
[36:57] but this service is my service
[37:00] he may have had a voice all of this year
[37:03] but today it's my turn to say something
[37:05] the bride will have a voice up the pride
[37:07] will speak up
[37:08] and what we speak will come to pass so

[37:46] i'm not even waiting for 2017
[37:49] your family they're already coming right
[37:52] now
[37:52] they don't even know it but they are
[37:54] being pulled
[37:55] just like lazarus lazarus come forth
[37:59] black slide up come forth sick person
[38:03] comfort you who are depressed come forth
[38:07] god is able
[38:08] [Applause]
[38:12] maybe she did you may be seated if you
[38:14] can
[38:15] i want you to understand the backdrop in
[38:18] first kings 17 elijah said not even dew
[38:22] or rain is going to come unless i called
[38:25] for it
[38:26] and elijah disappeared he went into
[38:29] safety
[38:30] he went into where god led him to be and
[38:32] king ahab
[38:33] looked to the east looked to the west
[38:36] looked to the north
[38:37] looked at the south he couldn't find him
[38:39] he searched
[38:40] he's trying to know who is called who is
[38:42] predestinated
[38:44] but he can't find you because you're
[38:46] under the blood
[38:47] elijah was covered he was protected he
[38:50] was in training
[38:51] he was in preparation but in 18 it
[38:54] switched
[38:54] ahab is going around his business and
[38:57] elijah is ready
[38:58] to display who he is he is ready to come
[39:01] out to hide him
[39:02] you can't hide for long this morning we
[39:04] coming out to hide him
[39:06] the devil beat you up and you went into
[39:08] hiding but not this morning
[39:10] we are getting the permission by the
[39:12] word to come out of hiding
[39:15] you may be seated
[39:16] [Applause]
[39:20] so elijah comes out of hiding
[39:23] because we spoke a couple weeks ago god
[39:26] has never changed his strategy
[39:28] so when god wants to do something he
[39:29] could use hiding he could use a manger
[39:32] he could use the burning bush he could
[39:34] use the walls of jericho he could do
[39:36] whatever you want
[39:37] but when it's time for you to come out
[39:39] it's time for you to come out
[39:40] so elijah taking a stroller he knows
[39:43] ahab is going to be out there
[39:45] he knows over tire is going to be out
[39:47] here he know they are looking for him he
[39:49] said go
[39:50] tell your master that elijah is here
[39:53] he pull out his business card yes this
[39:56] is that elijah
[39:58] that elijah has been searching for he
[40:00] don't need to send you a hunting party
[40:02] he don't need to look no more i've made
[40:04] myself available
[40:05] you may be seated over there saying no
[40:08] no no no no no
[40:11] when i go and tell ahab that you said
[40:14] that you are here
[40:15] but the moment i turn around you will
[40:17] disappear and go i don't know where
[40:20] and he will kill me amen elijah said not
[40:24] this time
[40:26] it's time for a showdown
[40:28] [Applause]
[40:29] the time for hiding is over the time for
[40:32] playing church is over
[40:33] the time for warming a church bench is
[40:35] over the time to say i'm in the message
[40:37] is over
[40:38] the time to be a rumor is over the time
[40:41] to be a name you hear from the distance
[40:42] is over
[40:43] this is going to be a showdown if god is
[40:46] god
[40:46] then serve him let the god and answer by
[40:50] fire
[40:50] let that that's the time we're talking
[40:52] about let the god and answer by
[40:54] fire you maybe see them not answer by
[40:58] convention
[40:59] not answer by the type of service not
[41:01] answered by what is spoken but led to
[41:02] god
[41:03] because the only vindication the only
[41:06] evidence of the showdown
[41:07] is when god himself answers and sends
[41:10] fire into your life
[41:11] that nobody can take away sends fire in
[41:14] your house
[41:15] that the devil can't fight that
[41:17] vindication
[41:18] is not from the minister's association
[41:20] that vindication
[41:22] is not from your family but it's god who
[41:25] sends the fire
[41:26] and this morning we say send the fire
[41:34] can the church say amen oh hallelujah
[41:38] hallelujah but the kangaroo i didn't
[41:41] even check what time i came into the
[41:46] pulpit
[41:51] is a powerful thing you know
[41:54] that's why i love how god operates with
[41:56] the clarions because sometimes you have
[41:57] to force
[41:59] force the issue to get us to move where
[42:00] he wants us to move
[42:02] the prophet relates a story one time i
[42:04] think he saw a turtle and
[42:05] he said take a stick and try to push it
[42:07] and it didn't move
[42:09] tried to throw something and it didn't
[42:10] move but when he lit a fire
[42:14] titans have to do no man told us how to
[42:17] move because
[42:18] fireless caused a response and some of
[42:21] you who don't want to lift your hands up
[42:23] we take sticks and try to push you we
[42:25] take stuff and try to throw it but
[42:27] when the fire comes you can't help
[42:31] yourself we say
[42:32] lord send the fire may he answer by
[42:36] fire this morning all these years in the
[42:38] message what you need is an answer of
[42:40] fire
[42:41] fire in your soul fire in your mind all
[42:44] the things you're struggling to do and
[42:46] you're trying to hold on and you're
[42:48] trying to make it by that fire
[42:51] drop down in there that lust of the eyes
[42:53] the lust of the flesh you
[42:55] trying to be somebody all of that
[42:57] disappears you're gonna fire
[42:58] our god the bible says it's a consuming
[43:01] fire
[43:02] he will destroy everything just let go
[43:05] this morning and let the fire of god
[43:07] take a
[43:08] whole of your life
[43:12] hallelujah a kingdom
[43:15] that cannot be moved
[43:20] a kingdom that cannot
[43:23] be moved cannot be shaken
[43:26] so many times in our lives we try to
[43:28] rely
[43:30] on these props i call it the props
[43:34] in our lives we rely on the prop of our
[43:37] job you know once you have your job you
[43:39] know you can make it
[43:40] rely on the prop of our savings we may
[43:44] lay on the prop of our family and god
[43:47] has a way of removing these
[43:48] props so that we could lie on him
[43:52] and rely on him because he's the only
[43:55] one that cannot be shaken he's the only
[43:57] one that cannot
[43:58] be moved man cannot produce that only
[44:01] god
[44:02] could produce that can the church say
[44:04] amen
[44:06] so the headstone is coming the stone of
[44:09] power is coming to break up
[44:11] every man-made system to break up every
[44:14] conception that you have and but over he
[44:16] was preaching on the inspiration and he
[44:18] was
[44:19] preaching from this quote last week he
[44:21] said i believe that the bride of christ
[44:22] is called
[44:23] i believe she is sealed in the kingdom
[44:25] of god i believe the mechanics is there
[44:27] they are waiting
[44:28] for the dynamic that will take her off
[44:30] the earth into glory in the rapture i
[44:32] believe it
[44:32] with all my heart yes sir he won't know
[44:35] how he's gonna do it but he shall we
[44:37] don't know how he's gonna do it
[44:38] but he shall do it he is the dynamics we
[44:41] just become
[44:42] members of the machine of his body
[44:44] forming
[44:45] ourselves into his image and see him
[44:47] uniting himself with us in his works
[44:49] with his love gifts
[44:51] as he hands them to us just before the
[44:53] wedding supper
[44:54] we are waiting we are watching for that
[44:56] can the church say amen
[44:58] and the dynamics of this church will be
[45:01] a revealing of the holy spirit
[45:03] that we have worked in a small measure
[45:05] while the headstone is coming down to
[45:07] unite with the body
[45:09] but when the head and body unites
[45:11] together the full
[45:12] power somebody say full power the full
[45:16] power of the holy ghost
[45:17] will raise her up chest exactly like
[45:20] that
[45:20] even the dead that's dead in christ for
[45:23] hundreds of years
[45:24] will rise in the beauty of his holiness
[45:27] and take a flight to disguise
[45:28] but the brown said the dynamics is the
[45:30] holy spirit
[45:32] so this final showdown that we are
[45:34] talking about
[45:36] it's not going to be your strength it's
[45:37] not going to be your might
[45:39] but it'll be the dynamics the holy ghost
[45:42] itself from
[45:42] taking control of the mechanics of the
[45:45] body itself
[45:46] and when the two come together and begin
[45:49] to move in harmony
[45:50] they have the devil for all these years
[45:53] every age every generation
[45:55] he felt he made it he beat up elijah
[45:58] he beat up joshua throughout it they
[46:01] dare they fall into the ground
[46:02] but in this time the power that's coming
[46:05] will raise and get out of the graves
[46:08] the power that's coming will cause a
[46:10] rapture to take place up
[46:11] the power that's coming will reach your
[46:13] family that can't understand what's
[46:15] going on
[46:16] but this power could not be stopped up i
[46:19] see a stone
[46:20] cut off without the hands of man and
[46:22] that stone of power
[46:23] is coming can the church say man
[46:26] [Music]
[46:27] may be seated in the very first recorded
[46:31] message
[46:32] that brother branham preached in on
[46:34] april 12 1947
[46:37] listen to brother adam's words in the
[46:39] message faith is the substance so he
[46:41] said i wish to speak to you tonight
[46:43] just for a little bit of time and teach
[46:45] the word of faith
[46:47] that you might know how listen carefully
[46:49] how to approach god
[46:52] there's many of these great and deep
[46:54] subjects that people claim that they
[46:57] know
[46:57] much about and when it comes down to the
[47:00] final showdown
[47:02] they know very little of it now that's
[47:05] true we are going to find out in a few
[47:07] of these things tonight so billy branham
[47:10] saying there are many deep things that
[47:12] you could preach and you could
[47:13] investigate but when it really comes
[47:15] down to it it comes out to the final
[47:17] showdown
[47:18] and very few know about it
[47:21] so we are talking about showdowns this
[47:23] morning a showdown
[47:24] what is it it's a confrontation
[47:27] it's a fight it's a face-off it's a
[47:30] standoff
[47:32] life is a showdown the bible is a book
[47:34] of showdowns
[47:35] but i believe this morning the bride is
[47:38] getting ready for the final
[47:41] showdown
[47:44] we live in a modern age now but years
[47:46] ago in the days of the wild west there
[47:48] used to be showdowns
[47:49] we'll meet you at 12 noon and one man
[47:52] walk up the dusty road and
[47:54] come into a showdown and he stands up on
[47:56] this side and on the other side the
[47:58] other one walks and
[47:59] they would face off it's a showdown and
[48:00] the whole neighborhood is there the
[48:02] whole community
[48:02] and they say draw on whoever draws and
[48:05] shoots first wins the showdown
[48:07] what a way to go but life
[48:11] is about showdowns
[48:14] sometime ago but over preacher message
[48:16] you say you do what you have to do until
[48:18] you find out
[48:19] what you are called to do many of us we
[48:22] don't like
[48:23] showdown we don't like confrontation but
[48:26] also said your passion for victory must
[48:29] be
[48:29] stronger greater than your fear of
[48:32] defeat
[48:35] i'll say those two again you do what you
[48:37] have to do until you find out what you
[48:39] are called to do
[48:41] and your passion for victory must be
[48:44] stronger
[48:45] greater than your fear of defeat
[48:49] you said satan cannot get stronger
[48:53] but you can i love that one satan cannot
[48:57] get stronger but you can
[48:59] so in this battle this showdown that we
[49:01] are talking about it's time that you
[49:03] lift your head up but brother isaac i
[49:06] don't have the best prayer life that has
[49:07] nothing to do with it right now the
[49:09] showdown is coming
[49:10] and you are being called out this
[49:12] morning you're being called out to make
[49:13] an appearance
[49:15] you're being called out to represent the
[49:16] fate that was once delivered to the
[49:19] scenes you're being
[49:20] called out to be identified you could
[49:22] hide no longer in the shadows
[49:24] every individual in the bride is being
[49:27] called out
[49:27] to be identified oh
[49:31] those dark ages when the christians were
[49:33] burnt at the stake and fed the lions
[49:36] it was easy to make your identification
[49:39] known
[49:42] those days were easier you know it might
[49:43] sound rough to go to the lion's den and
[49:46] stuff you know
[49:47] but it's either you were lion food or
[49:49] not lion food
[49:51] it's either you were a real christian or
[49:52] not a christian there were many people
[49:54] i'm sure say you know what
[49:55] i'm good enough i'm good i'll pray in
[49:58] secret
[49:59] you have no identification but in this
[50:01] age it's easy for people to stay
[50:03] hiding like adam did hiding in eden
[50:07] hiding here hiding there hiding in the
[50:09] church hiding in the crowd but
[50:10] we're talking about a showdown where you
[50:12] could be identified by the token itself
[50:15] but the branham said the token must be
[50:17] displayed that the people around you can
[50:19] see it
[50:20] so if you're trying to hide in the
[50:22] church or hiding a message
[50:23] the clock is ticking down let this
[50:25] service put a line in the sand
[50:28] with you hiding who you are hiding where
[50:30] you come from hiding
[50:31] your testimony hiding who you are in god
[50:35] can the church say man the more i study
[50:39] the words the more i realize that god
[50:41] loves showdown some of us we don't like
[50:43] conflict we don't like
[50:44] confrontation we don't like to face of
[50:46] anybody but
[50:47] god is different he delights in the
[50:50] opportunities to prove himself
[50:53] can the church seem when you read
[50:55] genesis there was darkness but there was
[50:57] a showdown and god said
[50:58] let there be light and light and
[51:00] darkness fought and light worn
[51:02] from all back there it's been a showdown
[51:05] can the church say amen when moses went
[51:08] down to egypt
[51:09] and he began to speak he said i'm going
[51:11] to show you a sign and they dropped the
[51:13] road and
[51:13] and the devil responded janice and
[51:16] jambis throw their rats down what was
[51:17] that it was a showdown
[51:19] if moses didn't hear from god he would
[51:21] have said listen i'm going
[51:23] i'll come back the next time when i come
[51:25] back with something different but no
[51:26] it was a showdown it's a battle you
[51:29] think the devil's going to make it easy
[51:31] for you no
[51:32] he's going to fight for every inch of
[51:34] ground but god has never changed his
[51:37] strategy
[51:37] you are going to overcome you are going
[51:40] to make it
[51:41] you are going to have a testimony
[51:44] oh blessed people name of the lord
[51:48] if you have ever seen a boxing match you
[51:50] maybe see that there's a certain energy
[51:52] but the brandon was an amateur boxer
[51:56] can the church say man but the brandon
[51:58] was an amateur boxer there's a certain
[52:00] atmosphere
[52:01] when you're in a boxing match on one
[52:03] side it's one person about to fight and
[52:05] usually on the other side is some kind
[52:07] of champion
[52:08] somebody who's being challenged in other
[52:10] words a showdown
[52:11] has a challenger and the person being
[52:13] challenged
[52:15] and in a boxing match is the defending
[52:17] champion or the person who thinks they
[52:19] are winning or whatever it is and then
[52:21] there's a person coming against it
[52:24] so right now this morning it's what you
[52:25] have been fighting all these years your
[52:27] cancer your tumor your disease your
[52:30] mind battles your fears and all these
[52:33] years it's day in your life but this
[52:34] morning
[52:35] you are getting an encouragement to come
[52:37] to the showdown because when the brandon
[52:39] said you have to say pull back
[52:41] listen god is not coming to just take
[52:43] care of your battle
[52:45] when you're a soldier you know he's
[52:46] coming to give you strength to fight
[52:48] your battle
[52:49] but abram said it like this he said you
[52:51] have to do something but some of it
[52:53] happened
[52:54] that's why if you shall say to this
[52:56] mountain be moved
[52:57] you can't sit there and start waiting on
[52:59] god to come and do something no
[53:01] you gotta say something you gotta speak
[53:03] to your mountain you gotta speak to your
[53:05] house you gotta
[53:06] speak to your family and then watch god
[53:08] come to back it up
[53:10] oh you don't hear me this morning stop
[53:12] being lazy stop sitting back saying i'm
[53:15] waiting for god to
[53:16] deal with it what are you doing speak to
[53:18] the mountain
[53:19] why crime moses speak and move forward
[53:22] you have been given a commission
[53:24] you have been called as a soldier in
[53:26] such a time as this
[53:27] can the church say man oh my
[53:30] my i feel religious this morning on the
[53:33] left corner
[53:34] is the devil and he's jumping up and
[53:36] down he's been winning all kind of
[53:37] battles for all these years
[53:39] he thinks he could win this one there
[53:41] were showdowns and battles and
[53:43] but one time somebody came into the ring
[53:46] who was a little different he wasn't
[53:48] popular he didn't look handsome
[53:50] he didn't speak nice but when he came to
[53:52] the ring
[53:53] the devil thought this was just gonna be
[53:55] like every other battle
[53:56] when the devil fought moses he warned
[53:58] him he got moses
[54:00] to not make it to the promised land he
[54:01] got abraham to lie
[54:03] he got david to do this and to do that
[54:05] but when this one came into the ring
[54:07] and the devil thought he was like
[54:08] everybody else he said this is just like
[54:10] another showdown
[54:11] but here comes a lowly little savior
[54:14] named jesus
[54:15] and he comes walking into the ring and
[54:17] the devil tried to test him
[54:18] he give a little job if thou be
[54:20] [Applause]
[54:22] and jesus said come on now
[54:26] come on now it is written did they ever
[54:28] say well that's a different one
[54:31] he probably again he said it is also
[54:33] written
[54:34] problem again and then jesus walk out
[54:36] the ring
[54:39] the devil doesn't know what's going on
[54:41] the devil doesn't know what's happening
[54:43] this boxer is boxing different
[54:45] [Applause]
[54:48] this box is a little different from
[54:50] everybody else he's trying to police a
[54:51] police file
[54:54] let me understand this one we can't find
[54:56] nothing against him
[54:58] there was no sin in this one he said i
[55:00] gotta find somebody to pin on this one
[55:02] the devils had to use an attack he said
[55:04] call him blc
[55:05] call him this but jesus uttered not a
[55:07] word
[55:08] because he was preparing to give a
[55:10] knuckle blow to the table the devil had
[55:12] never felt before
[55:14] but the problem said when jesus was in
[55:16] the wilderness with the devil
[55:18] satan was electrocuted with some faults
[55:20] that he never forgot
[55:23] but jesus wasn't finished with him yet
[55:25] can the church say amen
[55:27] jesus battled them battle and battle and
[55:30] then on the cross
[55:31] when jesus said it is finished the devil
[55:34] got one of those moves that he didn't
[55:36] understand him
[55:37] it looked as if jesus was knocked out
[55:39] cold
[55:39] [Applause]
[55:41] and the referee started to count one two

[56:21] door and he said i need to get inside of
[56:23] there
[56:23] they say you're not invited no i don't
[56:25] need to be invited and jesus walked in
[56:27] there and took the keys of debt
[56:29] and took the keys of hell
[56:31] [Applause]
[56:33] and he gave those keys to his bride he
[56:35] said don't fear that
[56:37] don't fear hell don't fear the grave you

[1:00:20] and your natural responses will go and
[1:00:22] hide
[1:00:23] and say let me call the pastor let me
[1:00:25] call your assistant pastor let me call
[1:00:26] you elders to pray
[1:00:28] but your instinct as a soldier is you
[1:00:30] supposed to be always ready
[1:00:33] in season out of season friend or no
[1:00:36] friend
[1:00:36] on the job in the home in the school on
[1:00:38] the road
[1:00:39] though ten thousand fall on my right
[1:00:41] side
[1:00:44] the death angel could be walking down
[1:00:45] the road but you know you have the token
[1:00:48] on the inside
[1:00:49] you just display your token say listen
[1:00:51] this is who i am the dead angel has to
[1:00:53] pass you by
[1:00:54] don't you know you are protesting for a
[1:00:57] special mission
[1:00:58] [Applause]
[1:01:04] oh hallelujah so there's been churches
[1:01:07] churches prizes and they have been show
[1:01:08] showdown showdowns battles battles
[1:01:10] showdown but there must come a final
[1:01:12] showdown
[1:01:13] there's got to come a point where you
[1:01:15] break past the sound barrier as it were
[1:01:18] and when you break past the song mary
[1:01:20] there's nothing to hold you back anymore
[1:01:22] by the night
[1:01:23] there's nothing to keep you bound
[1:01:24] anymore there's nothing to keep your
[1:01:26] prayer life down anymore
[1:01:28] there's no devil in hell could hold you
[1:01:30] back once you pass the sound barrier
[1:01:32] but the problem said there's a lot of
[1:01:33] vibrations there's a lot of shakins up
[1:01:36] it feels like the wings want to fall off
[1:01:38] it feels like the engines want to come
[1:01:40] off
[1:01:40] but when you break past that barrier
[1:01:43] that sin barrier
[1:01:44] that dog barrier brother it's unlimited
[1:01:47] the potential that's in the church it's
[1:01:50] unlimited what's locked up inside of you
[1:01:52] [Applause]
[1:01:59] brother branham said in the message
[1:02:00] ministry explained he said what's the
[1:02:02] matter is
[1:02:03] we christians get too weak when it comes
[1:02:06] to the showdown
[1:02:07] [Applause]
[1:02:09] that's the prophet speaking we get too
[1:02:11] weak when it comes to the showdown
[1:02:13] if it's real it's real if it's not it's
[1:02:16] not
[1:02:17] he said and if i didn't believe him with
[1:02:19] all my heart and no it was real i would
[1:02:21] not be here tonight
[1:02:22] but i believe it and not only that i
[1:02:25] know it's real
[1:02:27] and that's why i've always said in my
[1:02:28] heart i want a reality
[1:02:31] i am i'm not just here to have church
[1:02:33] i'm not here just no
[1:02:34] it's got to be more than that there are
[1:02:36] many churches
[1:02:38] there are many groups but i want the
[1:02:39] reality of the living god
[1:02:45] hallelujah that's what i'm looking for
[1:02:48] for god to step into homes and heal
[1:02:50] marriages
[1:02:51] because he is god he is jehovah china he
[1:02:54] is jehovah's shaman
[1:02:55] he is jehovah that's god he promised him
[1:02:59] to take care of you he promised to heal
[1:03:01] you he promised to give you the victory
[1:03:04] you better believe it and stand up and
[1:03:06] claim it it's yours
[1:03:17] there's a difference between showdowns
[1:03:20] and a final showdown
[1:03:24] remember the brandon said if you don't
[1:03:25] testify you gonna backslide
[1:03:30] you know you said that right to some of
[1:03:33] you who
[1:03:33] never tell anybody about jesus
[1:03:40] god is fair you know he's just and he is
[1:03:43] tied
[1:03:44] to his own word
[1:03:48] and he makes no excuses so there's no
[1:03:51] bligh
[1:03:53] there's no free pass with god you have
[1:03:58] to be able to testify
[1:04:00] oh god and the reason i'm saying i
[1:04:02] remember when i was in secondary school
[1:04:04] i got in a showdown
[1:04:06] with somebody in my class about the
[1:04:07] bible
[1:04:09] and he chopped me to shreds
[1:04:13] going back and forth and scripture this
[1:04:15] means this and that means this and this
[1:04:16] and this and after that showdown
[1:04:20] i felt so defeated because i went with a
[1:04:23] motive to convince him
[1:04:26] that this thing was truth but he was
[1:04:29] more trained than i was
[1:04:31] in scripture so he was like what does
[1:04:33] this mean and what this mean and
[1:04:34] and for many people in the message we
[1:04:36] know the message but we don't know the
[1:04:37] bible
[1:04:39] when they pull scriptures is like but
[1:04:42] brother branham said this
[1:04:43] like who is brother branham
[1:04:49] so you got to know the scripture that's
[1:04:50] why even the prophet said
[1:04:52] back to the bible
[1:04:54] [Music]
[1:04:57] because the bible is god's word the
[1:04:59] prophet's mission was to bring a light
[1:05:01] and
[1:05:01] shine under the direction of the holy
[1:05:03] spirit into where is written and to tie
[1:05:05] up the loose ending to connect the
[1:05:07] pieces
[1:05:08] so that we could rightly understand the
[1:05:09] bible because the bible in isolation is
[1:05:11] a closed book
[1:05:12] it's a seal it's sealed to the
[1:05:14] pentecostal it's sealed to the catholics
[1:05:16] it's sealed to them
[1:05:17] they read scriptures and they're only
[1:05:19] seeing shadows
[1:05:20] but when you look into the reveal world
[1:05:22] you are seeing clearly and plainly
[1:05:24] what you are born to do what you are
[1:05:25] called to do
[1:05:26] [Applause]
[1:05:30] but only a showdown could show what's
[1:05:32] inside of you
[1:05:36] let me say that again it's only when the
[1:05:38] showdown comes it proves
[1:05:40] what's inside of you that's why
[1:05:43] there's a test the only way to prove
[1:05:46] that you didn't waste your five years in
[1:05:48] secondary school is to have a test
[1:05:50] [Applause]
[1:05:52] your test is a showdown it's you and the
[1:05:54] paper and the pencil
[1:05:56] and the examiner there and it's like a
[1:05:58] warfare
[1:06:00] and you walk in there you either know
[1:06:02] what you're doing or you're praying to
[1:06:03] god to remember the stuff you heard in
[1:06:05] form one that you never looked at
[1:06:07] again and it's a showdown
[1:06:12] and some people in 10 minutes is over
[1:06:14] because they only know 10 minutes worth
[1:06:16] of stuff
[1:06:17] and for others they don't really wire
[1:06:19] time up and they want to be finishing
[1:06:21] because they have a lot to say
[1:06:23] because they want to make sure they
[1:06:24] overcome in this showdown
[1:06:28] life is about conflict everything has
[1:06:31] conflict a chicken coming out of an egg
[1:06:33] is conflict it's a showdown who is going
[1:06:37] to win is it going to stay
[1:06:38] in its condition and stay in the comfort
[1:06:41] zone of the egg or is it going to break
[1:06:43] out away from
[1:06:44] that mama chicken and break out of the
[1:06:46] egg
[1:06:48] and it wins that show down it steps out
[1:06:50] [Music]
[1:06:51] then it wants to go and explore on its
[1:06:53] own it's a showdown that's life it's a
[1:06:54] showdown
[1:06:56] it's a battle it's a struggle you
[1:06:59] struggle every day to overcome it's
[1:07:01] built
[1:07:01] in all of us to struggle amen just like
[1:07:04] it's built in all of us to be
[1:07:05] creators because it's the genes of our
[1:07:08] fathers
[1:07:09] and it's a struggle because god wants
[1:07:11] you to be a creator and the devil wants
[1:07:13] you to be a copy
[1:07:16] a photocopy of somebody else
[1:07:19] but when you're the individual
[1:07:20] revelation you are born for a time as
[1:07:23] this
[1:07:23] to be just like your father to have
[1:07:26] dominion that
[1:07:27] to mean that adam was given that he
[1:07:29] forfeited
[1:07:31] and you recognize that when you worship
[1:07:32] and you pray and you praise god and you
[1:07:34] press
[1:07:35] and you battle and you contend there's
[1:07:37] something taking place in the inside
[1:07:39] that's
[1:07:40] connecting to who you are
[1:07:42] [Applause]
[1:07:44] i love it but the red hat said about
[1:07:46] twisting he said you can't go back if
[1:07:47] you were not there
[1:07:50] but only because you were there you
[1:07:52] could go back to that
[1:07:53] [Applause]
[1:07:54] where was thou when i laid a foundation
[1:07:56] viewed that's not for everybody
[1:07:58] but if you were there you could go back
[1:08:00] to that
[1:08:02] can the church say amen and something
[1:08:04] has to reveal to you that you were there
[1:08:07] and if you were there and you were a
[1:08:09] warrior there why are you a warrior here
[1:08:13] i just used two words huh if you were
[1:08:16] there you were a warrior you were a
[1:08:17] fighter over there now you're coming and
[1:08:19] you're worried and i'm worried if i'm
[1:08:20] gonna make her wondering how i can pay
[1:08:21] the bills i wonder
[1:08:22] i'm worrying about my child worrying if
[1:08:24] i could make it a worrying if i could
[1:08:26] if i'm going to get the holy ghost i
[1:08:27] don't know and
[1:08:30] but back there you are a warrior just
[1:08:33] like the eagle the eagle
[1:08:34] asked permission for me to seize meat
[1:08:36] and swoops down
[1:08:37] when and find a meat it grabs it because
[1:08:39] it's an eagle it don't ask permission
[1:08:41] from another eagle
[1:08:42] it knows that it has a right
[1:08:46] it's not a chicken it's not a hawk it's
[1:08:48] an eagle
[1:08:50] you don't need permission to go to the
[1:08:52] world and see your name in there
[1:08:54] you need permission to go to god that
[1:08:56] veil was ran from top to bottom that the
[1:08:58] priest
[1:08:59] had put up to but when jesus died it was
[1:09:02] direct access
[1:09:04] you don't need to go to anybody you can
[1:09:06] go straight to god and say lord my
[1:09:08] child is in trouble i need an
[1:09:11] intervention i can't reach somebody in
[1:09:13] another country
[1:09:14] but you are able just like that
[1:09:16] centurion i'm not even
[1:09:17] worthy for you to come under my roof but
[1:09:19] just speak to word
[1:09:22] that's who we are
[1:09:27] listen to the prophet he said the devil
[1:09:28] will make you prove every one of those
[1:09:30] virtues
[1:09:31] think about that the devil will make you
[1:09:34] prove every one of those virtues isn't
[1:09:36] that a showdown
[1:09:37] so if the virtue being tested is
[1:09:39] patience then you have a showdown coming
[1:09:42] a patient showdown
[1:09:46] and if you've been tested in temperance
[1:09:47] by the night you have a temperance
[1:09:49] showdown coming
[1:09:51] and a situation will come to see if you
[1:09:54] could be temperate
[1:09:56] to see if you could be patient so not
[1:09:59] every showdown requires the same
[1:10:01] response
[1:10:03] not every response but machine is
[1:10:04] drawing sword and chop you know
[1:10:07] when joseph had his shoulder and it was
[1:10:08] a potty for wife showdown
[1:10:10] [Music]
[1:10:13] and joseph take them shoes i thought it
[1:10:16] was nike
[1:10:17] and it was adidas i don't know who it
[1:10:19] was and he ran
[1:10:21] for his life so there are some showdowns
[1:10:24] to win you have to run
[1:10:26] there's some showdown stand still and
[1:10:28] see the salvation of god
[1:10:31] that's a different kind of showdown
[1:10:32] joseph couldn't see stand still and see
[1:10:34] this
[1:10:38] different kind of showdown
[1:10:41] but the bible says we are not ignorant
[1:10:43] of satan's devices
[1:10:45] so the devil comes with all kinds of and
[1:10:48] i said to young people many years ago
[1:10:49] you in church you're struggling you're
[1:10:51] holding on you want to be a christian
[1:10:53] you want to live right
[1:10:54] you want to have a testimony in your
[1:10:56] school on your job because you know
[1:10:58] better anybody who comes and walks
[1:11:00] through this you know better when you do
[1:11:02] nonsense it's a choice
[1:11:06] and the sad part is many of us we do the
[1:11:09] blame thing and the blame thing comes
[1:11:11] way back from adam
[1:11:13] it wasn't me was a woman it wasn't me it
[1:11:16] was his serpent
[1:11:19] in fact adam even threw god in him under
[1:11:21] the bus he said the woman you gave me
[1:11:26] so you blame your woman and god forgive
[1:11:27] because i was by myself alone do any
[1:11:29] telling i would not be in this position
[1:11:31] right now
[1:11:33] but god has got a responsibility of
[1:11:36] accepting responsibility for your
[1:11:38] choices that's why we are free moral
[1:11:41] agents so we have a choice
[1:11:43] on if we want to worship so that's when
[1:11:44] elijah reached the point of the showdown
[1:11:47] he said why halt ye between two opinions
[1:11:52] why are you stuck trying to decide if to
[1:11:54] serve the god of ahab
[1:11:56] or if to worship the living god why are
[1:12:00] you halt between two opinions
[1:12:02] to be a real christian or to just be a
[1:12:04] church member
[1:12:06] why are you stuck between two decisions
[1:12:09] to go all the way or just come part of
[1:12:11] the way
[1:12:13] why are you stuck between two decisions
[1:12:17] to dress one way for church you know i'm
[1:12:19] coming
[1:12:21] and dress another way when you want to
[1:12:24] go to your show you want to go to your
[1:12:26] thing or you want to go by your friends
[1:12:27] or whatever
[1:12:28] speak one way in the house of god and
[1:12:31] that's why i say it's easy to be a
[1:12:32] christian in church
[1:12:34] because by nature we could adapt our
[1:12:36] environment
[1:12:37] but when you are out there when nobody
[1:12:39] is looking or when you
[1:12:40] think nobody is looking that's the real
[1:12:42] you that's who the angel of the lord is
[1:12:45] following not following you when you're
[1:12:47] here in the church and you
[1:12:48] looking all churchy but when you wake up
[1:12:51] in the morning and you're in the maxi
[1:12:53] and the music song in good
[1:12:58] i remember one time i was in form 2 or
[1:13:00] so
[1:13:01] and my dad was against us going to
[1:13:03] school
[1:13:04] bazaars and stuff and
[1:13:07] so maybe i went to maybe one or so for a
[1:13:10] short moment and
[1:13:11] he sent us with uh somebody from church
[1:13:14] uh ola young person i was like form one
[1:13:16] from two i can't remember and to my
[1:13:18] shock this older person was dancing to
[1:13:21] the music like just bobbing his head now
[1:13:23] he said his music catchy boy and i was
[1:13:25] just appalled
[1:13:27] because this was supposed to be person
[1:13:28] making sure that i don't do that
[1:13:36] but it's about choices showdown is about
[1:13:38] a choice
[1:13:39] [Music]
[1:13:41] what you see is a choice
[1:13:44] you could say the right thing you could
[1:13:47] and and i know we hear it you know
[1:13:48] but you see what happens the showdown is
[1:13:50] when the heat get turns
[1:13:51] up and the pressure comes a lot of the
[1:13:54] stuff you train and you hear
[1:13:56] suddenly fades away you know
[1:14:01] that's when the pr that that's the show
[1:14:03] on the showdown it's done when it's nice
[1:14:05] and we could
[1:14:06] go through the service now and
[1:14:07] everything is all right but the showdown
[1:14:08] is when you're by yourself and there's
[1:14:10] nobody to check you
[1:14:12] and as i said to them in maryvale two
[1:14:13] weeks ago that still small
[1:14:15] voice that says don't do it but the
[1:14:17] brahmana said when you don't listen
[1:14:19] over and over you become so you lose the
[1:14:22] sensitivity
[1:14:25] and then you get cut off so when you
[1:14:27] make a choice to disrespect your parents
[1:14:29] when you make a choice to
[1:14:31] not come to church after a while it
[1:14:33] becomes
[1:14:34] easier and easier and easier that's why
[1:14:37] the bible says we are in a rebellious
[1:14:41] and time is a spirit
[1:14:45] so we don't want to sit back and act as
[1:14:47] if everything is all right because we
[1:14:49] are in a showdown right now
[1:14:51] but the brandon was preaching the
[1:14:52] greatest battle ever fought and a battle
[1:14:54] was going on right there in the
[1:14:56] tabernacle right there in the church
[1:14:58] so there's a showdown going on right now
[1:15:01] a showdown for your soul
[1:15:03] a showdown for your testimony a showdown
[1:15:06] to see if you're gonna put god first
[1:15:10] what if you're going to be just like
[1:15:11] anybody else you could be 10 years old
[1:15:13] and put god first you could be six years
[1:15:15] old
[1:15:16] and put god first you could be a 100
[1:15:18] years old and put god first it has
[1:15:20] nothing to do with your age
[1:15:22] who your father is who your mother is it
[1:15:24] has to do with if god has spoken to your
[1:15:26] life
[1:15:27] to your heart
[1:15:28] [Music]
[1:15:33] you may be seated i knew when i started
[1:15:36] people
[1:15:36] thought i was going to get focused on
[1:15:38] the final show down to coming up but i
[1:15:39] want to stick here for a little while in
[1:15:41] this showdown here right now
[1:15:44] the showdown with your expectation and
[1:15:45] what you expect and how you expect god
[1:15:47] to move and god saying not yet
[1:15:49] i don't want to give you that because
[1:15:51] you have someone maturing up to do
[1:15:53] you have some much growing up to do
[1:15:55] brother branham said one time he said
[1:15:57] ministers we ever some more growing up
[1:15:59] to do
[1:16:00] because god wants some mature son some
[1:16:02] mature
[1:16:03] daughters who could weather the storm
[1:16:06] who could weather the trials
[1:16:08] who see trials for what they are that
[1:16:10] god will not give you
[1:16:11] more than you could be and what trial is
[1:16:14] more precious than
[1:16:15] gold and god wants to get your character
[1:16:18] so beautiful and so sweet that whenever
[1:16:20] you squeeze your life it's only perfume
[1:16:22] comes out
[1:16:23] because it's just like the rose of
[1:16:24] sharon when they crush the petals and
[1:16:27] calvary
[1:16:27] only the sweet fragrance of the rose of
[1:16:30] sharon could come out because
[1:16:36] so god gave us some sons and daughters
[1:16:38] that in 2017 would say god give us some
[1:16:41] more trials
[1:16:43] give us some more pressure give us some
[1:16:45] more showdowns
[1:16:46] because only the showdown could get us
[1:16:49] to overcome
[1:16:50] how many want to be overcomers how many
[1:16:53] want to face the showdown to overcome
[1:16:55] the showdown
[1:17:02] [Applause]
[1:17:06] only the overcomers the overcomers are
[1:17:09] the ones who overcome the showdown
[1:17:12] the showdown of the lust of the eyes the
[1:17:14] showdown of the lust of the flesh the
[1:17:16] showdown
[1:17:16] of the pride of life the showdowns of
[1:17:19] how you will conduct yourself
[1:17:20] during this christmas season amen
[1:17:25] but two two days ago i believe it was
[1:17:27] there was the earthquake in trinidad
[1:17:30] whole island shook i was there in my
[1:17:32] house and i was actually leaning just
[1:17:33] over the couch at the time
[1:17:35] and i felt the house began to shake
[1:17:38] and i said when i spoke that that
[1:17:40] tuesday evening and still i said for
[1:17:41] that brief moment you recognize how
[1:17:44] small you are in the architecture
[1:17:47] of god
[1:17:50] i looked out to the church there tuesday
[1:17:54] night and
[1:17:55] is one of the largest attendances we had
[1:17:58] on a tuesday night
[1:18:01] in a long time and brother anthony i
[1:18:04] said to them
[1:18:05] i believe in my heart that everybody had
[1:18:08] planned to come
[1:18:09] to service early that morning and it was
[1:18:13] not the earthquake
[1:18:15] that drove everybody to the house of god
[1:18:17] that evening
[1:18:22] but everything that can be shaken
[1:18:26] will be shaken
[1:18:30] people don't understand yet and was so
[1:18:32] powerful
[1:18:33] in his ministry last week when he was
[1:18:34] speaking about judgment
[1:18:37] and the bible said judgment will begin
[1:18:39] where
[1:18:41] in the house of god so don't look at
[1:18:44] judgment out there
[1:18:45] judgment begins in the house of god the
[1:18:48] bible says
[1:18:49] are the ancient men and the men who have
[1:18:53] sat
[1:18:53] in the message for a long time and they
[1:18:55] know better
[1:18:56] because to whom much is given much is
[1:18:59] required
[1:19:01] are the ancient men who have sat with
[1:19:03] the books and the tapes and the quotes
[1:19:05] and
[1:19:05] god is sending judgment because he will
[1:19:08] have no sin in his house
[1:19:11] he will have a church without spot
[1:19:13] without wrinkle
[1:19:15] so this is a showdown this morning to
[1:19:18] have a holy church
[1:19:20] to have a church built on prayer to have
[1:19:22] a church built on respects to have a
[1:19:24] church
[1:19:24] built on forgiveness because god is a
[1:19:26] god of judgment and he's a god of mercy
[1:19:29] [Applause]
[1:19:31] and the two come hand in hand but the
[1:19:34] brown said one day the last song will be
[1:19:36] sung one day the bible be closed for the
[1:19:37] last time and where will
[1:19:39] where will you be that's why the bible
[1:19:41] said seek ye the lord while he may be
[1:19:43] found call
[1:19:44] him while he is near this may be not the
[1:19:47] best type of service you want to hear to
[1:19:49] end the year you want to jump you want
[1:19:51] to shout but
[1:19:52] friends if we don't apply the token we
[1:19:54] miss the whole purpose
[1:19:55] of this message
[1:20:04] the rapture is going to be a small bunch
[1:20:07] of people friends
[1:20:08] it's not the whole message going to make
[1:20:10] it it's not the whole of christianity
[1:20:11] you talk about the rapture
[1:20:12] not because you talk about it means
[1:20:14] you're going to make it
[1:20:17] can the church say amen
[1:20:20] [Music]
[1:20:22] showdowns from the message god's way
[1:20:26] that's been made for us
[1:20:27] but ibrahim said so when it come time
[1:20:29] and the showdown and israel stood there
[1:20:30] by the sea god's path led across the sea
[1:20:33] so god looked down through the pillar of
[1:20:35] fire
[1:20:36] the sea got scared and moved back you
[1:20:39] hear that description
[1:20:40] the sea got scared and moved back and
[1:20:43] israel went across on dry land god's
[1:20:46] path led through it so what do you think
[1:20:48] will happen when you come to your
[1:20:49] shoulder and god wants to step in the
[1:20:51] sea
[1:20:51] your situation will get scared and move
[1:20:53] back we spoke about moses and his
[1:20:56] shoulder he spoke about
[1:20:56] daniel he had his showdown he stole him
[1:20:59] with a straw now about his prayer life
[1:21:02] that's what it was a song about his
[1:21:04] prayer life
[1:21:06] and what did daniel do curl up no he
[1:21:08] prayed
[1:21:10] he had a choice he could have gone and
[1:21:11] prayed under his bed so nobody would see
[1:21:13] it but you know what time
[1:21:15] daniel would pray that anybody could see
[1:21:18] him praying
[1:21:19] you know he had a choice he had a choice
[1:21:22] but a character want to hide you know
[1:21:24] think about it he had a choice
[1:21:28] to go where nobody would see him and
[1:21:29] pray
[1:21:31] but danielle was not afraid
[1:21:34] because he knew where his strength came
[1:21:36] from he knew where his power came from
[1:21:39] so he prayed just the same shame on you
[1:21:42] christians who don't even want to pray
[1:21:43] for your food at lunch in your lunch
[1:21:44] room on your job
[1:21:47] you're an embarrassment to the kingdom
[1:21:49] of god
[1:21:51] and if you are not strong enough to pray
[1:21:55] for your food on your lunch table yes i
[1:21:57] know some of you that that
[1:21:58] is dude
[1:22:02] and if you are ashamed of him what how
[1:22:05] do you want him to defend you
[1:22:07] and the bible says my people shall never
[1:22:09] be ashamed
[1:22:11] can the church say amen
[1:22:12] [Applause]
[1:22:16] real christians or no christians at all
[1:22:19] but ibraheem said uh god don't make
[1:22:21] halfway preachers he don't make half a
[1:22:23] christian but a preacher could be
[1:22:24] halfway a christian could be halfway
[1:22:26] but we want to go all the way we want
[1:22:28] god to do something for us but god
[1:22:30] expects something from us also a
[1:22:33] committed life a surrender life
[1:22:35] chem the church say amen the three
[1:22:38] hebrew boys had their showdown
[1:22:41] and they didn't back down they had a
[1:22:44] choice
[1:22:44] go into the fiery footage they said to
[1:22:46] break beg for mercy but they kept
[1:22:48] walking
[1:22:48] they kept walking they kept walking and
[1:22:51] when they got
[1:22:52] into the fiery furnace there was a
[1:22:53] fought man in the fire
[1:22:55] to meet them in their showdown can the
[1:22:57] church say amen
[1:23:01] and we spoke about elijah elijah said
[1:23:03] call all your prophets
[1:23:05] because the reason god held the rain and
[1:23:07] hell though the jew and reign is because
[1:23:09] the children of god had turned their
[1:23:11] backs on god
[1:23:13] and they were worshiping false idols
[1:23:16] he said call for us showdown call all
[1:23:19] your prophets
[1:23:20] call all your priests call all your
[1:23:22] believers
[1:23:23] let's have a convention set up your
[1:23:25] altar i'll settle my altar
[1:23:28] elijah was not afraid he's standing by
[1:23:30] himself he has no way to support him
[1:23:32] he has no way to encourage him but he
[1:23:34] has a revelation
[1:23:35] he said let it not be about numbers but
[1:23:38] let the god that answer by fire
[1:23:40] let that god be caught and that's what
[1:23:44] i'm saying this morning
[1:23:45] let the god who heals the sick let that
[1:23:48] call be god
[1:23:49] let the god who raises the dead let that
[1:23:51] god be called this morning
[1:23:54] you better have that god as your god
[1:23:56] this morning
[1:23:59] and those priests who were worshiping
[1:24:02] baal and bail him and all and that they
[1:24:04] put the animals there
[1:24:06] and they started dance and they started
[1:24:08] worship
[1:24:09] and elijah was so confident he began to
[1:24:11] tease them he said maybe
[1:24:13] your god is on a vacation maybe your god
[1:24:15] went fishing
[1:24:16] maybe your god went for a walk maybe
[1:24:18] your god went strolling
[1:24:20] and those men understand this but the
[1:24:22] brahmana said they were so sincere
[1:24:25] they believed that they had to cut
[1:24:26] themselves
[1:24:28] because they believed that they were
[1:24:29] right but when elijah's turn come
[1:24:32] now the whole nation is watching it's
[1:24:35] the final showdown in that day
[1:24:38] he said put it there he said pour water
[1:24:42] put some water in it because i want to
[1:24:44] make sure that you see it's really fire
[1:24:46] from god
[1:24:47] there's no flame burning anywhere there
[1:24:49] i didn't start this but let the god
[1:24:51] that answer by fire it's not a man-made
[1:24:54] fire
[1:24:55] it's not a church made fire is isn't a
[1:24:57] group fire
[1:24:58] but it's god answering by fire because
[1:25:01] he sees your life
[1:25:02] he sees your sacrifice he sees your
[1:25:05] testimony
[1:25:06] he sees you staying with his word he see
[1:25:09] you
[1:25:09] applying the token
[1:25:12] and all of a sudden the fire from heaven
[1:25:15] dropped down
[1:25:16] and the people began to repent god give
[1:25:18] us people like that
[1:25:19] who will stand in such a time as this in
[1:25:21] this showdown can the church say amen
[1:25:24] oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:25:28] hallelujah
[1:25:29] the woman with the issue of blood she
[1:25:31] came to her showdown
[1:25:32] the bible said she has spent all that
[1:25:34] she had and i would expect if she had
[1:25:36] more money she would have spent it too
[1:25:38] but she had went from doctor to doctor
[1:25:40] with her condition but she had come to
[1:25:42] her crossroads as it was
[1:25:43] she had come to her showdown she had no
[1:25:46] many
[1:25:47] or no more options and called many times
[1:25:50] to bring us to the spot
[1:25:51] where we have no more options we have no
[1:25:53] more alternatives
[1:25:55] we have no more family to ask i could
[1:25:57] have imagined you would have asked a
[1:25:58] family for money
[1:25:59] ask her friends from money to keep
[1:26:01] peeing the doctor's pills
[1:26:02] she had the issue of blood for years and
[1:26:05] she kept trying to solve it
[1:26:06] but she heard that jesus was in town and
[1:26:10] she heard the testimonies of what jesus
[1:26:12] would do but she came to her crossroads
[1:26:14] and she told herself
[1:26:16] if i could just touch up the hem of his
[1:26:18] garment
[1:26:19] i'm going to be made whole she came to
[1:26:21] her showdown
[1:26:23] and god didn't make it easy for her he
[1:26:25] didn't clear a path for her
[1:26:26] but the currency had to press away past
[1:26:29] those who were just in the church
[1:26:31] she had to press away past those who
[1:26:33] were just warming a bench
[1:26:34] see you had to press away past those who
[1:26:37] just wanted to be in church
[1:26:39] hallelujah and she pressed away and she
[1:26:42] touched
[1:26:42] him of his garment and she made a
[1:26:44] withdrawal
[1:26:45] because she had faith to reach out and
[1:26:48] jesus looked around he said who touched
[1:26:50] me the disciples didn't understand what
[1:26:52] was going on they say but jesus
[1:26:54] everybody touching you he said this is
[1:26:56] different
[1:26:57] this woman made a withdrawal i've felt
[1:27:00] virtue left me
[1:27:02] i felt power left me i felt grace left
[1:27:05] me
[1:27:05] is there somebody here to small him who
[1:27:08] has come to dear showdown
[1:27:10] they have come to their crossroad they
[1:27:12] don't want to go back home

[1:27:18] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:27:24] hallelujah hallelujah the time for
[1:27:27] showdown god give us the courage god

[1:33:24] when are we going to say enough is
[1:33:26] enough i feel like shamgar this morning
[1:33:29] shamga had reached a point where he was
[1:33:31] tired
[1:33:32] of giving up his prayer life giving up
[1:33:35] his labor
[1:33:36] every season after he would plant him
[1:33:39] and he would reap
[1:33:40] and he would put away the harvest to
[1:33:42] fill his times would come
[1:33:43] and they would take it away from him but
[1:33:45] the pranam said you may be seated
[1:33:47] but the president said that
[1:33:51] had reached a point where he couldn't
[1:33:53] take it anymore
[1:33:54] he said shamga looked out but ibrahim
[1:33:57] said it was me about 600 philistines
[1:33:59] coming
[1:33:59] he said shangha stood there the prophet
[1:34:02] said he looked at his wife
[1:34:04] he looked at his daughter he said not
[1:34:06] another season
[1:34:08] am i going to give up my labor to the
[1:34:10] philistines
[1:34:12] brother branham said shanghai was
[1:34:13] dressed like a farmer
[1:34:15] he said he was not a soldier but in his
[1:34:17] heart
[1:34:18] but the branham said he was concerned
[1:34:20] and then he got convinced
[1:34:22] he was convinced that god was with him
[1:34:25] but the problem said he was not a
[1:34:27] soldier he didn't have a sword
[1:34:29] he didn't have a spear he didn't have a
[1:34:31] shield he had an
[1:34:32] ox code you know where the ox goat is
[1:34:35] it's what used to
[1:34:35] go the oxen just to push it forward it
[1:34:38] was not a weapon
[1:34:39] but he reached his point he reached his
[1:34:42] limit
[1:34:43] he couldn't take it no more shambhala
[1:34:45] was tired
[1:34:46] of praying and seeing the devil take his
[1:34:49] joy
[1:34:50] he was tired of coming to church and
[1:34:52] going back home
[1:34:54] and not seen a change in his life he was
[1:34:56] tired
[1:34:57] of seeing his wife cry he was tired
[1:35:00] of seeing his daughter hungry he was
[1:35:02] tired of seeing his little bitty boys
[1:35:05] not have food
[1:35:09] he may be seated hallelujah
[1:35:12] it was not it was not that
[1:35:15] shangha wasn't working it was not
[1:35:18] that shangha was lazy shangha was
[1:35:21] working
[1:35:22] samgye was struggling sangha was praying
[1:35:25] sangha was crying out but when the
[1:35:28] harvest came
[1:35:29] the philistines would come and they
[1:35:31] would take it all away
[1:35:33] and shamga told himself not this time

[1:43:06] your wife your husband your children
[1:43:11] you maybe seen it for a few minutes i
[1:43:13] want to get this in there
[1:43:19] but the branham said shamgar was
[1:43:21] convinced
[1:43:26] it had just become too much for him and
[1:43:29] many times you have to come to the
[1:43:30] spotlight shanghai he
[1:43:32] had become used to giving up his harvest
[1:43:35] but the devil just pushed just once too
[1:43:38] much
[1:43:39] and this time he made up his mind that
[1:43:41] he was not
[1:43:43] giving up again he looked not just at
[1:43:46] himself but he looked at his wife
[1:43:49] but he looked at his child look at his
[1:43:50] family
[1:43:52] i want to challenge you look not just at
[1:43:54] yourself but look at your family
[1:43:56] look at your wife your husband your
[1:43:58] child your brother your sister look at
[1:44:00] the
[1:44:00] person who's next to you right now
[1:44:02] because that's your family
[1:44:04] i'll catch your burden and say lord is
[1:44:07] he not fizzy enough
[1:44:09] i'm tired of seeing sister christine in
[1:44:11] pain doesn't that
[1:44:12] that that that should affect you on a
[1:44:14] deep level i'm tired of seeing my
[1:44:16] brothers and sisters struggling with
[1:44:18] their back their eyes it comes a point
[1:44:21] where you say it's enough is enough
[1:44:24] enough is enough seeing our young people
[1:44:26] struggling listen all young people they
[1:44:27] love god
[1:44:28] they want to serve god and the enemy has
[1:44:31] done a number in their minds in the
[1:44:33] school and on their
[1:44:34] friends and many of you parents you have
[1:44:36] done the best that you could the best
[1:44:37] that
[1:44:38] you know how you have loved them more
[1:44:40] than that you could even put into words
[1:44:42] but still they
[1:44:43] have a hard time and you know this is
[1:44:45] the truth and you pray for them and you
[1:44:46] cry out for them but i want to say
[1:44:48] enough is enough
[1:44:50] this is the season for their restoration
[1:44:52] the philistines have done
[1:44:53] enough and we come to push them back we
[1:44:56] come to serve them notice
[1:44:58] that this is the final showdown
[1:45:04] but the branham said in the message
[1:45:06] convinced and then concerned
[1:45:08] he said if this group of people here
[1:45:10] tonight and i say today could get
[1:45:13] that much convinced he said god gave the
[1:45:16] promises and when god gave the promise
[1:45:18] to abraham
[1:45:18] he said he would have possessed the gate
[1:45:20] of his enemies and so shanghai
[1:45:23] believed that and looked at the odds
[1:45:25] against him
[1:45:27] listen to the prophet and this is what
[1:45:28] i'm looking for today he said god
[1:45:31] only needs one man
[1:45:33] [Music]
[1:45:37] so i'm looking for one person i know i'm
[1:45:39] one this morning but is there anybody
[1:45:41] else this morning
[1:45:42] he said god only needs one man god
[1:45:45] just let just let him get one man
[1:45:48] in his hand the world will think he's
[1:45:51] crazy
[1:45:52] but he will drive home the gospel when
[1:45:54] he's thoroughly convinced
[1:45:56] listen to what he's convinced about that
[1:45:58] jesus christ remains the same yesterday
[1:46:02] today and forever under anything else he
[1:46:05] will stand through
[1:46:06] and go on because he's thoroughly
[1:46:08] convinced
[1:46:09] that god is god and if he ever was god
[1:46:12] he's still god
[1:46:13] and if he isn't the god he was he never
[1:46:16] was god that's right
[1:46:17] he's the infinite god the all-powerful
[1:46:20] this is the prophet
[1:46:21] almighty omnipresent omniscient
[1:46:25] infinite he said oh my he's god
[1:46:28] he's the same god that opened the red
[1:46:30] sea he's the same god that brought
[1:46:32] daniel out of the lion's den
[1:46:34] the same god that brought the hebrew
[1:46:36] children from the fiery furnace up
[1:46:38] he's the same god that raised up jesus
[1:46:41] christ on easter morning
[1:46:42] he's the same god that fell in there
[1:46:45] pentecost
[1:46:46] he's the same god that raised lazarus
[1:46:48] out of the grave
[1:46:49] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:46:52] forever and i'm convinced
[1:46:54] that this is the holy ghost oh my that's
[1:46:57] the prophet's words
[1:46:58] but the prayer goes on he said peter
[1:47:00] said on the day of pentecost
[1:47:02] this is that and if this isn't that
[1:47:05] i'll keep this till that comes up for i
[1:47:07] believe
[1:47:08] this is that i'm convinced that it's the
[1:47:11] gospel
[1:47:12] and the power and the demonstration of
[1:47:15] the resurrection
[1:47:16] of the appearing of the lord jesus
[1:47:18] christ in this last day
[1:47:20] making the church ready to be caught
[1:47:22] away in the pride
[1:47:24] can the church see man
[1:47:28] oh my oh my
[1:47:31] oh my oh my is there anybody convinced
[1:47:35] this morning
[1:47:36] is anybody convinced this morning is
[1:47:39] anybody concerned this morning
[1:47:41] listen to the prophet moses in the same
[1:47:44] message moses
[1:47:45] esteem the reproach of christ listen
[1:47:48] greater riches than the treasures of
[1:47:51] egypt
[1:47:54] i want to say this friends you hunt all
[1:47:57] kinds of stuff in life
[1:47:58] that nice house a nice car the money the
[1:48:00] dist or whatever it is
[1:48:02] but moses esteemed the reproach of
[1:48:04] christ
[1:48:05] greater riches than the treasures of
[1:48:07] egypt
[1:48:08] therefore he forsake a throne he took
[1:48:11] his choice with the poor
[1:48:12] ignorant illiterate slaves why he
[1:48:15] esteemed the riches of christ greater
[1:48:17] treasures
[1:48:18] than to have his glory in the world at
[1:48:20] that time
[1:48:21] [Applause]
[1:48:23] can the church say amen oh have all the
[1:48:26] glory they want but what god wants today
[1:48:29] is men and women
[1:48:30] who isn't interested in great big
[1:48:33] fineries and
[1:48:34] all these other things but somebody
[1:48:36] undertake the simple word of god
[1:48:38] and preach it with all that's in them
[1:48:40] and wait on god for the power of god
[1:48:43] to manifest himself hallelujah we can't
[1:48:47] bring the manifestation on in our time
[1:48:49] but when the time has come
[1:48:50] it's just like elijah tell them i'm here
[1:48:53] and one of these days
[1:48:54] there will be an announcement around the
[1:48:56] world tell them the pride is here
[1:48:58] tell them the pride is here once more
[1:49:01] they are sons and daughters of god
[1:49:03] just like adam dominion on the earth
[1:49:06] once
[1:49:07] more the bees will know it the trees
[1:49:09] will know it
[1:49:10] the sky will know it the seas will know
[1:49:13] it can the church say
[1:49:14] man oh somebody give the lord a shout
[1:49:17] our praise
[1:49:19] hallelujah hallelujah oh
[1:49:22] my my my my my mind
[1:49:25] oh i'm getting ready to close out now
[1:49:28] could you take some more
[1:49:33] hallelujah so brother branham he
[1:49:36] proclaimed a message a shout message
[1:49:39] and that short message was a call to war
[1:49:41] that message was to place us in another
[1:49:43] ephesians
[1:49:44] that in another ephesians where the fate
[1:49:47] will be preached
[1:49:48] and brother stephen was so tremendous a
[1:49:49] couple weeks he was speaking about
[1:49:50] defeat
[1:49:51] not a fate or a belief or a doctrine but
[1:49:54] the
[1:49:55] faith that the early church had because
[1:49:57] malachi 4 come to restore the heart of
[1:49:59] the children
[1:50:00] back to the apostolic faith because it
[1:50:03] takes faith to operate the power
[1:50:05] it takes faith to move the sword so
[1:50:07] every service
[1:50:08] we we're getting prepared by the word we
[1:50:11] get them prepared by the world because
[1:50:12] faith comes by hearing the word
[1:50:14] and when you are convinced and you get
[1:50:16] concerned
[1:50:17] that the time is now and god is able and
[1:50:20] he's still the same yesterday today and
[1:50:22] forever
[1:50:23] then all of a sudden your walk begins to
[1:50:25] change your talk begins to change
[1:50:28] and every attack the devil could put
[1:50:30] might be against your body
[1:50:31] but he could never touch your soul
[1:50:33] there's a seed in your soul
[1:50:35] that the devil cannot touch by the pop
[1:50:37] well he could watch you
[1:50:38] he could bring your headaches and your
[1:50:40] mind battles and mess with your mind and
[1:50:42] your
[1:50:42] memory and your conscience and your
[1:50:43] imagination but your soul
[1:50:46] belongs to god and the devil is mad he's
[1:50:50] upset
[1:50:54] hallelujah so maybe after this year
[1:50:59] you're a little tired a little wary and
[1:51:02] you know there are some people
[1:51:03] they almost want to send themselves off
[1:51:08] maybe a little tired maybe a little
[1:51:10] weary but i want to encourage you this
[1:51:12] morning
[1:51:13] maybe you didn't understand how this
[1:51:14] happened why this happened
[1:51:16] maybe you've seen so much you don't even
[1:51:18] know if you want to fight anymore and
[1:51:19] say lady on people fight
[1:51:24] but today we are all going to fight for
[1:51:26] every inch of ground
[1:51:28] we all want to fight to see these great
[1:51:30] hairs turn back black
[1:51:32] i was saying to my wife just yesterday i
[1:51:33] find my rate of
[1:51:35] gray hair growth is becoming exponential
[1:51:39] it used to be one or two i said tell
[1:51:40] everything last two months i just see
[1:51:42] like a whole
[1:51:42] crop of gray
[1:51:48] but brother barry that grey hair got to
[1:51:49] turn back
[1:51:53] that gray hair got to go can i stand my
[1:51:55] promise
[1:51:56] if my hair grows and it's hard to see
[1:51:58] here is a little lower
[1:51:59] than the size for some reason i don't
[1:52:01] know why one time i told the barber cut
[1:52:03] this to match this
[1:52:12] but it's a showdown amen amen paul's
[1:52:15] today said death where's your sting
[1:52:17] grave where's your victory he looked
[1:52:18] in his face and laughed show down
[1:52:21] because he knew where he was standing
[1:52:24] that's the confidence we must all have
[1:52:26] he could speak that way because he had
[1:52:28] met the pillar of fire
[1:52:31] his approval was not from man his
[1:52:33] approval was not from gamaliel
[1:52:35] his approval was not from jerusalem his
[1:52:37] approval was from the pillar of fire
[1:52:39] the pillar of fire placed him into his
[1:52:42] position
[1:52:42] and that's what we want sons and
[1:52:44] daughters of god
[1:52:45] placed by fire
[1:52:48] whether we have a service or not your
[1:52:50] connection is
[1:52:51] vertical your connection is not
[1:52:54] horizontal
[1:52:55] if british stephen isn't here i can't be
[1:52:57] like oh gosh i wonder what's going on
[1:52:59] no my connection is political
[1:53:02] if nobody else wants to worship my eyes
[1:53:04] are closed
[1:53:05] to everybody else what they are going
[1:53:08] through is that what i'm going through i
[1:53:09] will worship
[1:53:10] nobody well no nobody else standing up
[1:53:13] so i
[1:53:13] what is that yo
[1:53:17] your connection must be vertical when
[1:53:20] god speaks to you you respond
[1:53:23] because god is speaking to you if nobody
[1:53:25] else is hearing him this morning and you
[1:53:27] hear him
[1:53:27] you should be so happy so excited
[1:53:30] to hear the voice of god inside of your
[1:53:32] soul somebody see man
[1:53:40] my could you take some more it's the
[1:53:42] last sunday you know
[1:53:44] no i don't want you to think i'm
[1:53:45] finished now
[1:53:51] [Music]
[1:53:53] you're getting service today and next
[1:53:55] week one time
[1:54:02] from the message putting on the whole
[1:54:03] armor of god remember i said you know in
[1:54:06] this warfare between nations there's a
[1:54:08] great warfare
[1:54:08] going on beyond that so while the bible
[1:54:11] says you'll hear of wars and rumors of
[1:54:13] wars and the end is not yet but the
[1:54:14] banner is now saying let's go
[1:54:16] higher than that there's a great warfare
[1:54:18] going on beyond that
[1:54:20] and that's a great warfare between god
[1:54:22] and satan a great warfare
[1:54:23] that was the first warfare and it's
[1:54:25] still raging but oh
[1:54:27] i'm so glad it'll soon come to an end
[1:54:30] then it'll all be over and listen listen
[1:54:33] carefully young people
[1:54:35] satan has his agents out everywhere
[1:54:40] i want you to get this so this is not
[1:54:41] about you coming to church and going to
[1:54:43] work and going to school
[1:54:44] satan has his agents out everywhere
[1:54:47] watching spying out on god's people
[1:54:50] god's moves the enemy is setting
[1:54:54] everywhere
[1:54:54] watching to see what he can do and god's
[1:54:57] got some out too
[1:54:59] so god's got some agents out of the
[1:55:01] shame so we find out that these secret
[1:55:03] agents of the enemy that sits around now
[1:55:05] listen
[1:55:06] but the brother said each nation now
[1:55:08] will equip its men with the latest
[1:55:10] equipment
[1:55:12] the very latest and they study and they
[1:55:14] do everything
[1:55:15] they're trying to counteract the other
[1:55:18] fellows weapons
[1:55:19] and to get a little more modern weapon a
[1:55:21] little something with a little more
[1:55:23] punch to it
[1:55:24] from the bow and arrow to a musket and
[1:55:26] from a musketeer a modern rifle
[1:55:28] and from that to an atomic they just
[1:55:30] keep on building and it keeps them busy
[1:55:33] all the time and it's the nation's
[1:55:35] business
[1:55:36] if they want to survive they want to
[1:55:38] equip their souls with the best
[1:55:40] equipment that there is
[1:55:42] but the brandon goes and he said well
[1:55:44] god you know he's infinite see
[1:55:46] he don't have to think of anything
[1:55:48] better he's just got the best to begin
[1:55:51] with
[1:55:52] so you can't improve on it nothing's to
[1:55:55] be done
[1:55:55] about it he just gives us the best and
[1:55:58] that's his word
[1:55:59] that's right that's his word the best
[1:56:02] that can be given
[1:56:03] and god gives his people the very best
[1:56:06] that's what he chose for his children
[1:56:08] the very very best i'm so
[1:56:11] glad of that listen to the prophet now
[1:56:14] god
[1:56:15] cannot make a decision today listen
[1:56:17] carefully
[1:56:18] and tomorrow come back and make a better
[1:56:21] decision
[1:56:23] let me say it again god cannot make a
[1:56:25] decision today
[1:56:27] and come back tomorrow and make a better
[1:56:30] decision
[1:56:31] so if god elected you he cannot come
[1:56:34] back
[1:56:35] and make a better decision to pick
[1:56:38] somebody else when god chose you
[1:56:44] he made the best decision he made the
[1:56:46] best choice
[1:56:48] you were his first choice he went at his
[1:56:50] second choice
[1:56:52] and the church say amen listen to the
[1:56:56] prophet see
[1:56:57] because his first decision is perfect he
[1:57:00] never
[1:57:00] has to change it so therefore we can
[1:57:03] rest
[1:57:03] upon whatever god says and if god says
[1:57:07] we're going to get the holy ghost
[1:57:09] that decision is already made there's no
[1:57:11] better decision
[1:57:13] we can rest on that and i'm resting on
[1:57:16] it this morning
[1:57:17] we are going to have a revival we are
[1:57:19] going to have a revival
[1:57:24] oh my my
[1:57:27] oh my oh my everybody feeling fine
[1:57:32] everybody feeling energized you ready
[1:57:34] for another three hours
[1:57:35] oh my
[1:57:40] hallelujah so we are getting ready for
[1:57:44] war
[1:57:44] but i'm saying the message of paradox he
[1:57:46] said any man that believes god
[1:57:49] any man it doesn't even speak about his
[1:57:52] condition
[1:57:53] he said any man that believes god
[1:57:56] and takes him at his word no matter what
[1:58:00] the situation
[1:58:01] is god will perform another paradox
[1:58:04] to keep his word he didn't say how
[1:58:07] you're living
[1:58:07] how you're acting he said if any man
[1:58:09] believe god and take him at his word
[1:58:12] no wonder but the brandon could talk
[1:58:13] about the people will come
[1:58:15] and get healed in the prayer lines who
[1:58:17] were prostitutes
[1:58:18] who were living any way they wanted but
[1:58:20] they believed god
[1:58:22] and they took him at his word and god
[1:58:23] healed them and people sat
[1:58:25] in the tabernacle for 20 years to 10
[1:58:29] years
[1:58:29] for five years believing and got nothing
[1:58:32] because they didn't have the fate
[1:58:34] but this morning we have a faith to see
[1:58:37] god
[1:58:37] do something
[1:58:39] [Applause]
[1:58:41] you may be seated not by legalism
[1:58:44] not by rules and i said to them and
[1:58:46] marava listen this
[1:58:48] gospel this message is not about rules
[1:58:50] [Music]
[1:58:51] do this don't do this do this don't do
[1:58:53] this young people say we have too much
[1:58:54] rules
[1:58:55] it's not about rules it's about love
[1:59:02] so i said to them in marvel my wife
[1:59:04] wasn't in the service but i said if my
[1:59:06] wife tells me
[1:59:06] to put the white clothes here and put
[1:59:09] the color
[1:59:10] here because it's easier to wash
[1:59:13] i could go and tell my friend's boy tony
[1:59:15] boy my wife a real rules
[1:59:18] i have to put it white here and put the
[1:59:20] color
[1:59:21] here but it's not a rule to me is
[1:59:24] love because if she loves it that way
[1:59:27] my love for her to make her happy with
[1:59:29] big all the white hair
[1:59:31] and all the colored hair so i don't see
[1:59:34] it as a ruler
[1:59:36] i love her so if you want the white
[1:59:37] clothes here white clothes
[1:59:40] colored hair colored clothes and
[1:59:42] whatever god wants from me
[1:59:44] if he says do it this way i say yes lord
[1:59:47] here yes lord here is that the rule he
[1:59:50] loves me
[1:59:51] i love him it's a relationship
[1:59:53] [Applause]
[1:59:55] you may be seated
[2:00:02] two weeks ago you know there's a
[2:00:03] facebook status relationship status
[2:00:05] single married it's complicated
[2:00:08] he said your relation with god cannot be
[2:00:10] complicated
[2:00:12] it's either it's real or it's not you
[2:00:14] can't be not sure how things stand
[2:00:16] between you and god
[2:00:17] i really shouldn't be kind of rocking no
[2:00:19] no no no keep that relationship on point
[2:00:21] all the time
[2:00:23] the same he give you gifts you give him
[2:00:25] gifts a sacrifice of praise that's a
[2:00:27] gift to him
[2:00:28] surprise him with a gift of worship
[2:00:31] surprise him
[2:00:32] with spontaneous glory just stand in the
[2:00:35] middle of the day
[2:00:36] lock yourself in the bathroom and say
[2:00:38] lord i want to thank you
[2:00:40] for your grace and your love and your
[2:00:42] mercy
[2:00:46] [Applause]
[2:00:50] can the church say man i'm all over the
[2:00:53] place this morning but i pray this gives
[2:00:55] you some
[2:00:55] substance to fight the battle that when
[2:00:58] nobody else is around that's that's what
[2:01:00] this is about
[2:01:01] that you could stand when nobody else is
[2:01:04] looking
[2:01:05] anywhere under any time under any
[2:01:08] condition
[2:01:09] the earthquake must come on you must
[2:01:10] look around and stand strong
[2:01:12] knowing that the canopy of life you know
[2:01:14] the brandon walked and there was a
[2:01:15] bubble around him
[2:01:17] people would come to him and they would
[2:01:19] stop he said don't be afraid that's just
[2:01:21] the presence of
[2:01:22] god it was something you could feel
[2:01:26] it's something that you just recognized
[2:01:27] you hit something you can't see with the
[2:01:30] eye but he was protected
[2:01:33] i know you know when you give your life
[2:01:35] completely to him and he takes
[2:01:36] the driver's seat because he isn't there
[2:01:39] he has his own security guards
[2:01:41] so when he's in there his security
[2:01:43] guards become your security guard
[2:01:46] can the church say man
[2:01:50] i want you to understand friends if the
[2:01:51] president of the united states is
[2:01:52] driving
[2:01:53] and is his whole motorcade the plane on
[2:01:56] top all the security
[2:01:57] and you just standing by so he said come
[2:01:59] and get a ride with me and you sit in
[2:02:02] that car then all of a sudden
[2:02:06] you are protected you are just as
[2:02:09] protected as the president
[2:02:11] of the united states so when you think
[2:02:13] god plays the holy ghost which is a part
[2:02:15] of himself in you
[2:02:16] isn't he obligated to protect himself
[2:02:19] [Applause]
[2:02:22] that's why he said no weapon formed
[2:02:24] against you can prosper
[2:02:25] because they tried weapons on jesus but
[2:02:27] it couldn't prosper
[2:02:32] they will pick up deadly things they
[2:02:34] wouldn't harm them
[2:02:36] if death couldn't kill him how could it
[2:02:37] affect you it might change your
[2:02:39] location your dwelling place but your
[2:02:41] soul belongs to god
[2:02:44] you are cut from a different cloth your
[2:02:47] dna has
[2:02:48] has has has as resurrection built in
[2:02:50] there
[2:02:51] not everybody has that you know that's
[2:02:54] why you confuse the doctors
[2:02:56] how much testimony you have you don't
[2:02:58] know how you made it through and the
[2:02:59] doctor said this about you that's about
[2:03:01] you we read it every sunday praise after
[2:03:03] praise after praise
[2:03:05] is your dna is different your blood type
[2:03:08] is not a
[2:03:08] or a positive that's not your blood type
[2:03:11] your blood type is the same jeans that
[2:03:13] come from god
[2:03:14] [Applause]
[2:03:17] come the church say amen
[2:03:19] [Applause]
[2:03:22] just a little more i'm just trying to
[2:03:23] find a way to close out here to
[2:03:26] encourage you so we are getting ready
[2:03:28] for war
[2:03:29] for a final showdown a final battle
[2:03:33] abraham is counting on us joshua is
[2:03:36] counting on us
[2:03:37] david is counting on us they did their
[2:03:39] part to the best of their ability but
[2:03:42] they had to pass the but turn on
[2:03:44] to the next group to take it and the
[2:03:46] next man to take it and the next judge
[2:03:48] and the next prophet
[2:03:49] and when jesus came he passed the battle
[2:03:51] on to the church
[2:03:52] all i was in god reported to christ all
[2:03:54] i was in christ before this church
[2:03:56] and then the first church aid come and
[2:03:58] when they were done they passed it on
[2:04:00] and every age was a battle every age had
[2:04:03] a thunder
[2:04:03] every age had a voice every age had a
[2:04:06] message every age had a people every
[2:04:08] each at a time
[2:04:10] but now we are the end of the ages
[2:04:12] there's no more messenger to come
[2:04:15] but there is a people on the land
[2:04:17] there's no more time to come
[2:04:19] because time is no more we are in that
[2:04:21] season now
[2:04:23] where the devil is confused the devil is
[2:04:25] mad he doesn't understand what is going
[2:04:27] on
[2:04:28] but her pride is getting ready you know
[2:04:30] what brother branham said
[2:04:31] the third pull is for the weaker ones
[2:04:33] the ones who don't even have the faith
[2:04:35] can't even muster the fate
[2:04:37] but the brandon also said that when you
[2:04:38] get over there you're going to see
[2:04:39] people there you never thought
[2:04:42] we're going to make it so god picked for
[2:04:44] the clarence
[2:04:45] a bunch of misfits a bunch of
[2:04:48] unqualified people
[2:04:50] just like how we picked peter and james
[2:04:52] and john who were not qualified
[2:04:54] god picked a bunch of unqualified people
[2:04:57] who didn't have the best resumes
[2:05:01] they didn't have the best resumes for
[2:05:02] the kangaroo didn't have the best
[2:05:04] qualifications

[2:05:10] peter was of all kind of he still choose
[2:05:13] him
