[1:02:16] and if ever we need a hard gospel is not
[1:02:20] you know knowledge shall increase and
[1:02:22] people have received things so
[1:02:23] intellectual
[1:02:25] it has got away from this this hot
[1:02:28] gospel this gospel that God operates on
[1:02:31] the Heart and souls of man
[1:02:33] you know he told them in the scriptures
[1:02:35] that
[1:02:38] he told them
[1:02:40] that that
[1:02:41] um he tried them to prove them to see
[1:02:43] what's in their heart
[1:02:49] well no you know the enemy have to fight
[1:02:51] after some kind of technical thing some
[1:02:54] kind of internet thing that is the age

[1:03:03] so I was kind of waiting for them to
[1:03:05] sort it out it's glad I did
[1:03:07] so this morning I have a special
[1:03:11] who wants a message but
[1:03:14] something up on my heart I know that in
[1:03:16] myself I I can't really preach this it
[1:03:19] will take the Holy Spirit to help me
[1:03:20] with this but we would see what the Lord
[1:03:22] will do and let's bow his as we
[1:03:25] understand and approach the word
[1:03:30] almighty God we stand under the shadow
[1:03:32] of your mercy
[1:03:34] and we ask for Mercy that you forgive us
[1:03:37] our sins and our failures and our
[1:03:39] shortcomings and the past Lord and we'll
[1:03:43] break into this new year
[1:03:44] as new Lord children booted by your
[1:03:48] spirit booted into fresh Vision Lord
[1:03:50] that you will become our vision
[1:03:53] and at the end of it all you send a
[1:03:55] prophet to introduce to us Jesus Christ
[1:03:58] not just teachings and doctrines and
[1:04:00] Mysteries and Revelations but to
[1:04:04] introduce to us the Messiah
[1:04:06] father God may you come into your word
[1:04:08] and come on your people as you promise
[1:04:09] you will that you will be amongst them
[1:04:12] and then your Prophet prophesied that we
[1:04:14] worship in the living Christ him moving
[1:04:17] in love Among Us father we invite you to
[1:04:20] come among us today in a special way
[1:04:22] come Among Us in your word and Enlighten
[1:04:24] Us in Jesus I ask it amen and amen
[1:04:27] see if I have your Bibles I'd like to
[1:04:29] turn to three portions of scripture
[1:04:31] Isaiah 34 Verse 8. Isaiah 61 1-2
[1:04:36] Romans 12 we want to read 19 to 21.
[1:04:44] So reading from Isaiah
[1:04:47] 34 8.
[1:04:48] for it is the day of the Lord's
[1:04:51] vengeance
[1:04:53] and the year of recompensers for the
[1:04:55] controversy of Zion
[1:04:58] Isaiah 61.
[1:05:00] the spirit of the Lord God is upon me
[1:05:03] because the Lord had anointed me to
[1:05:06] preach good Titans unto the meek he had
[1:05:09] sent me to bind up the Brokenhearted to
[1:05:11] Proclaim Liberty to the captives and the
[1:05:14] opening of the prison to them that are
[1:05:16] born
[1:05:17] to proclaim the acceptable year of the
[1:05:19] Lord
[1:05:20] and the dear Vengeance of our God
[1:05:23] to comfort all that mourn
[1:05:26] and our last scripture days from Romans
[1:05:28] 12
[1:05:30] and we want to read from verse 19 I'm
[1:05:31] going to read two verses before that
[1:05:33] verse 17.
[1:05:35] going to 90. recompense to no man even
[1:05:38] for evil provided things honest in the
[1:05:41] sight of all men if it would be possible
[1:05:43] as much as light
[1:05:46] in you live peaceably with all men
[1:05:49] here we go 19. daily dearly beloved
[1:05:53] avenge not yourselves but rather give
[1:05:56] please unto wrath for it is written
[1:05:59] vengeance is mine
[1:06:02] I will repeat see it the Lord
[1:06:05] therefore if that enemy hunger feed him
[1:06:10] if he tears give him drink
[1:06:13] for in so doing Thou shalt Heap cause a
[1:06:16] fire on his head
[1:06:18] be not overcome of evil but overcome
[1:06:21] evil with good may God bless his word
[1:06:23] you may be seated
[1:06:29] our title this morning and the title is
[1:06:32] the day of vengeance
[1:06:35] and I have an inspiration
[1:06:37] the ministry of Jesus Christ
[1:06:42] the Bible says vengeance is mine
[1:06:46] I will repeat
[1:06:47] see it the Lord
[1:06:50] the dear vengeance is like a destination
[1:06:54] we're heading down there
[1:06:56] now I want to go over Romans 12 19 in
[1:06:59] the Amplified
[1:07:00] and it says beloved
[1:07:03] never avenge yourselves
[1:07:06] but leave the way open for God's Wrath
[1:07:12] for it is written
[1:07:14] vengeance is mine
[1:07:16] I will repay or requite see as the Lord
[1:07:19] and that scripture is from Deuteronomy
[1:07:22] chapter 32 35 that is where uh Paul pull
[1:07:28] it out from now Deuteronomy 32 35 says
[1:07:32] to me belong at vengeance
[1:07:35] and recompense
[1:07:37] their foot shall slide in due time
[1:07:41] for the day of the Calamity is at hand
[1:07:44] and the things that shall come upon them
[1:07:47] make hist
[1:07:50] the Amplified of that same scripture is
[1:07:52] the vengeance is mine
[1:07:54] and recompense
[1:07:56] in their time when their foot shall
[1:07:59] slide for the day of their disaster is
[1:08:02] at hand and the Doom comes speedily
[1:08:07] so regardless of what people do to you
[1:08:10] how would it hurt you
[1:08:12] abuse you
[1:08:14] maybe rape you whatever
[1:08:17] you go through
[1:08:19] vengeance
[1:08:21] belongs to God
[1:08:23] you and I are not authorized by the word
[1:08:26] to take up Vengeance in our own selves
[1:08:29] or to trigger um righteous indignation
[1:08:33] and you're going and do something and
[1:08:34] hit back
[1:08:35] or to get even
[1:08:37] amen
[1:08:38] praise the name of the Lord the
[1:08:40] dictionary meaning of Vengeance
[1:08:42] punishment
[1:08:43] inflicted in retaliation for an injury
[1:08:47] or offense
[1:08:48] not a word
[1:08:49] retribution
[1:08:52] now God's vengeance is not Revenge
[1:08:56] God's vengeance is his determined
[1:08:59] Justice
[1:09:00] his righteousness
[1:09:02] his holy anger towards sin
[1:09:06] to what's wrong doing that is God's
[1:09:09] Vengeance it is not God taken Revenge it
[1:09:12] is God paying back
[1:09:14] you see I will
[1:09:16] repay
[1:09:18] it's not something
[1:09:21] so let me just go over the scripture
[1:09:22] again
[1:09:23] deadly beloved avenge which is to punish
[1:09:26] or retaliate or execute judgment not
[1:09:29] yourselves but rather give Place unto
[1:09:32] Wrath so when you commit wrongdoings or
[1:09:35] evil I mean see this is important now
[1:09:38] because you will see the power of
[1:09:40] forgiveness and broadly kindness that is
[1:09:43] needed to go to the next level
[1:09:46] that is what you're going to see and
[1:09:48] you're going to see what people have in
[1:09:49] your heart and how it'll be so wrong
[1:09:51] that they're keeping all these grudges
[1:09:52] and thoughts in the heart looking to get
[1:09:54] even and they're in church
[1:09:57] and you will see how they cannot get
[1:09:59] blessed no way having that in their
[1:10:01] heart and in their system so let's go
[1:10:04] down a little deeper a metal teaching a
[1:10:07] little scripture reading but it is
[1:10:09] important and I believe God pushes upon
[1:10:11] me to share this with you today
[1:10:14] beloved avenge which is to punish or
[1:10:16] retaliate or to execute Justice not
[1:10:19] yourselves but rather give please under
[1:10:21] wrath for it is written vengeance is
[1:10:23] mine
[1:10:24] he owns that he will deal with that he
[1:10:28] will handle that he will manage that
[1:10:30] regards a whole lie who cheat who teeth
[1:10:33] who do whatever it is God will deal with
[1:10:35] that he's invented his mind you don't
[1:10:38] own that you don't have the right to
[1:10:40] that let God deal with that let God deal
[1:10:43] with them okay the Lord some Praises I
[1:10:45] don't care what your wife do what your
[1:10:47] husband do what your children do what
[1:10:49] the neighbor do what whoever do it
[1:10:51] doesn't matter let Vengeance belong to
[1:10:53] God or give the Lord some praises
[1:10:56] Hallelujah glory to God
[1:10:59] that scripture in the Amplified that
[1:11:01] verse 19 says beloved never avenge
[1:11:04] yourself but leave the way open so when
[1:11:07] you go and run to do your own thing and
[1:11:08] hit back and cuss back and argue back
[1:11:11] and fight back you're not leaving no
[1:11:12] room for God to do anything
[1:11:14] you doing your own thing and God takes
[1:11:17] his hands off and let you play yourself
[1:11:18] out
[1:11:19] but the scriptures say don't avenge
[1:11:21] yourself because vengeance is mine okay
[1:11:24] the Lord some praises
[1:11:26] Hallelujah
[1:11:29] I will repay
[1:11:30] says the Lord
[1:11:33] the wrath of God is inescapable
[1:11:36] his judgment is terrible
[1:11:38] it is also righteous
[1:11:41] so then it went on to say how to behave
[1:11:43] when evil is done to you how to behave
[1:11:46] when you are wronged how to behave when
[1:11:49] people treat you evil and so on if you
[1:11:52] therefore if thine enemy hunger
[1:11:55] feed him if he tells give him drink Oh
[1:11:59] Glory to God no custom don't say yes
[1:12:02] I'll go put my neck on him because he
[1:12:03] only ground now he is in a weakness now
[1:12:05] a good for him you do wicked he didn't
[1:12:09] say that okay the Lord some Praises this
[1:12:11] is the word now this will make you bust
[1:12:13] out of your human Spirit the human
[1:12:15] element and get in the real Spirit of
[1:12:18] forgiveness to drop everything today it
[1:12:21] has to drop because fire is about to
[1:12:23] fall
[1:12:24] because we are coming unto the day of
[1:12:26] Vengeance of our God hallelujah it's not
[1:12:29] your day it's his day okay the Lord has
[1:12:32] shout is not I saying this I change that
[1:12:35] he said the day of Vengeance of our God
[1:12:38] okay the Lord I shout in the house
[1:12:41] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:12:43] Hallelujah
[1:12:45] verse 21 be an overcome of evil but
[1:12:48] overcome evil with good glory to God so
[1:12:51] God is fear
[1:12:53] God is just and God knows exactly what
[1:12:58] is in people's heart
[1:12:59] hallelujah praise God praise God so to
[1:13:02] even speaking to gossiping whatever come
[1:13:05] towards you your acts of kindness and
[1:13:09] goodness will bring guilt and
[1:13:11] condemnation and torment to the mind of
[1:13:13] your Tormentor when they expected to hit
[1:13:16] back you're not hitting back when you're
[1:13:18] expecting the cost back you're not
[1:13:19] cussing back when you're expecting to
[1:13:21] fight back you're not fighting back
[1:13:22] because right glory to God vengeance is
[1:13:26] mine
[1:13:27] Hallelujah I will repay
[1:13:30] Hallelujah
[1:13:31] glory to God do you get it today
[1:13:34] [Applause]
[1:13:41] so this is not eye for eye
[1:13:44] anger for anger
[1:13:46] but you bless them instead
[1:13:49] Hallelujah therefore if that enemy
[1:13:51] hunger feed him if he does give him to
[1:13:53] drink this verse shows your enemy at
[1:13:56] their weakest point they are in a
[1:13:58] position where you can exact revenge or
[1:14:01] even get even they're hungry they are
[1:14:04] thirsty they have a Calamity but what is
[1:14:06] your response the Bible said don't let
[1:14:09] them die
[1:14:10] feed them give them to drink help them
[1:14:13] okay the Lord I shout
[1:14:16] you could exact Revenge you could get
[1:14:18] back even like I said this is what you
[1:14:21] deserve
[1:14:23] [Applause]
[1:14:24] this is what I want happen to you I want
[1:14:27] to hit back I want to get back because I
[1:14:29] feel so happy on the inside I want to
[1:14:32] see him mash up I want to see her
[1:14:34] destroyed it
[1:14:38] I wonder so you lose your house lose
[1:14:40] your job

[1:14:44] want to see you lose out
[1:14:46] because of what you do to me
[1:14:49] [Music]
[1:14:53] [Applause]
[1:14:56] if
[1:14:58] you were in a position to help them
[1:15:00] your enemy
[1:15:02] commit the rest into the hands of God
[1:15:05] for Glory
[1:15:06] can we go a little further
[1:15:09] proverbs 24. verse 17.
[1:15:14] Rejoice not
[1:15:16] when thy enemy falleth
[1:15:19] and let not thine heart be glad
[1:15:22] when he stumbled
[1:15:25] least the Lord see it
[1:15:28] and it displeased him and he turn away
[1:15:31] his right from him
[1:15:37] somebody do your evil somebody do you
[1:15:40] wrong but hear what the word say
[1:15:42] don't rejoice when the enemy fall
[1:15:45] good for him
[1:15:49] because so it means
[1:15:52] God watching your heart
[1:15:56] forget the enemy that's not the issue
[1:15:58] here you know God watching you
[1:16:01] sorry I don't want to point at anybody
[1:16:02] else I don't want to feel the fingers
[1:16:04] sorry sorry sorry I do that I don't see
[1:16:08] him and say appointed her
[1:16:10] no I'll keep me forgive myself
[1:16:13] don't anybody say they see my finger
[1:16:15] pointed and I pointed at them
[1:16:16] unappointed at anybody sorry
[1:16:20] God watches our heart
[1:16:22] disappointing on us
[1:16:26] to see
[1:16:28] if we are rejoicing
[1:16:30] when things happen to people that have
[1:16:33] wronged you
[1:16:34] or done your evil or lion you or
[1:16:38] mistreat you or whatever it is and when
[1:16:41] you're sick Calamity hit them so and
[1:16:43] you're smiling in the recorder and God
[1:16:45] said is that right
[1:16:48] I don't like that
[1:16:50] you know what I do I cancel my rap to
[1:16:52] watch them
[1:16:56] so when they're supposed to get
[1:16:58] repayment
[1:17:00] your behavior
[1:17:02] fingers they're pointing at George
[1:17:06] sorry
[1:17:07] your attitude
[1:17:09] could make God
[1:17:13] his rack payment
[1:17:15] or discipline
[1:17:17] to your enemy because God see it and he
[1:17:19] displeased with it
[1:17:21] oh praise the name of the Lord
[1:17:23] let me read that and he Amplified
[1:17:25] Rejoice not when your enemy Falls
[1:17:28] and let not your heart be glad
[1:17:31] when he stumbles or is overthrown leaves
[1:17:35] the Lord see it and it be evil in his
[1:17:38] eyes and this please him and he turn
[1:17:40] away his wrath from him to extend extend
[1:17:44] it upon you the woes offender
[1:17:46] so God is looking at your heart
[1:17:49] that the sea the attitude you have to an
[1:17:53] enemy that stumbles or is overthrown
[1:17:56] oh Hallelujah this is coming to real
[1:17:59] Christianity by the gangly this is the
[1:18:02] real thing we come into re this is
[1:18:04] similarly amongst Africa they know they
[1:18:06] don't mystery coming here and you're
[1:18:07] scratching their head to find the thing
[1:18:08] out with mystery there's the real thing
[1:18:09] here now this is Christ The Mystery of
[1:18:11] God being revealed by the word this is
[1:18:13] the word becoming flesh and people could
[1:18:16] taste it see it live it this is what
[1:18:18] we're talking about here now Luke
[1:18:20] chapter 9 verse 51.
[1:18:24] and it came to pass when the time must
[1:18:26] come that he should be received up
[1:18:28] talking about Jesus he steadfast he said
[1:18:30] his face to go to Jerusalem
[1:18:33] sent Messengers before his face and they
[1:18:35] went entered into the village of the
[1:18:37] Samaritans to make ready for him
[1:18:40] listen to this part
[1:18:42] and they did not receive him
[1:18:45] because his face was as though
[1:18:47] he would go to Jerusalem
[1:18:49] so they didn't receive the messengers
[1:18:51] that come to forerun Jesus Come into
[1:18:53] that place
[1:18:54] verse 54.
[1:18:56] and when
[1:18:57] his disciples James and John saw this
[1:19:00] they said Lord
[1:19:02] will build out that we command fire
[1:19:05] to come from heaven and consume them
[1:19:07] even as Elias did they have a scripture
[1:19:11] they say their receiver good could we
[1:19:14] call Fire
[1:19:15] could we say burn them one time
[1:19:19] could it be called judgments on them
[1:19:21] as Elias did
[1:19:23] listen to Jesus response
[1:19:28] but he turned and rebuked them
[1:19:32] this is Jesus response the Vex they
[1:19:35] upset that he's not received and and
[1:19:38] this is the attitude he said like reborn
[1:19:40] them all on fire
[1:19:42] she has rebuked them and said ye know
[1:19:45] not what manner of spirit you have
[1:19:53] the people not involved in that you know
[1:19:55] the people do the rejection the people
[1:19:57] have the behavior this is Jesus and his
[1:19:59] only disciples getting a scriptural
[1:20:01] basis to make an action of judgment that
[1:20:03] they don't have the spirit to deal with
[1:20:06] and can't handle because judgment
[1:20:08] vengeance
[1:20:10] is mine
[1:20:13] but listen to the next verse that that
[1:20:15] Jesus said here still Jesus speaking for
[1:20:18] the son of man is not come to destroy
[1:20:20] men's lives
[1:20:22] but to save them
[1:20:24] and they went to another Village
[1:20:28] so when you are wrong wronged
[1:20:31] two things is at play
[1:20:35] God's reward to your enemy
[1:20:39] or
[1:20:40] God reward to you or God's reward to the
[1:20:43] one that roamed you
[1:20:45] or God's reward to you
[1:20:48] based on your attitude towards your
[1:20:51] brother and sister
[1:20:52] if you rejoice over the fall of your
[1:20:56] brother or sister God cancels his rap
[1:20:58] towards them
[1:21:01] that's why Jesus said bless them that
[1:21:03] kiss you
[1:21:06] your blessing goes up their curves go up
[1:21:08] it bunks and the blessing falls back on
[1:21:10] you they could fall back on them if you
[1:21:12] cast them that costume will explain
[1:21:13] because I spent because falling both
[1:21:15] sides
[1:21:17] them that kills you it's not right
[1:21:20] so I want to say do you see the
[1:21:23] importance of the spirit of forgiveness
[1:21:26] even of Brotherly kindness
[1:21:28] do you see how the blood of the age has
[1:21:31] to be displayed not talked exhorted made
[1:21:34] a sermon made a card and put in a
[1:21:36] bookmark inside your Bible I'm not
[1:21:38] talking about that kind of bodily
[1:21:39] kindness I'm talking about the real deal
[1:21:41] when you stand praying
[1:21:43] forgive
[1:21:45] you stand praying for what in 2023 for
[1:21:47] Dynamics for the Holy Ghost for the
[1:21:50] power of God for your adoption for your
[1:21:52] refilling when you stand praying you're
[1:21:54] still have to forgive
[1:21:57] [Music]
[1:21:58] thank you
[1:22:06] because when you do that the blessings
[1:22:08] of God will fall upon you and then you
[1:22:10] can see the power of Psalms 23 5 don't
[1:22:13] prepare us a table for me in the
[1:22:16] presence of my enemies thou anoint is my
[1:22:19] head with oil my cup run it over so when
[1:22:22] the enemy you feed him you you help him

[1:22:29] your order God make a table in the
[1:22:31] presence of your enemies all what they
[1:22:34] don't want you to have God multiplying
[1:22:36] God adding when they expect God to
[1:22:38] divide and touch it all okay the Lord I
[1:22:41] shout all the evil all the jealousy all

[1:23:26] Hallelujah Proverbs 25 21 and 22.
[1:23:32] says If thy enemy may be hungry
[1:23:36] so therefore this is where the scripture
[1:23:37] comes from in Romans this is Proverbs

[1:23:41] bread to eat
[1:23:43] if we be thirsty give him water to drink

[1:42:56] afterwards next day people decided to
[1:42:58] lose men or whatever something wrong
[1:43:01] that is not what God said he said no man
[1:43:03] shall be able to stand before these are
[1:43:05] my life Victory after Victory and

[1:43:19] gets done you know
[1:43:20] good judgment you know that was the Old
[1:43:22] Testament in the New Testament they say
[1:43:25] they're selling they're bringing money
[1:43:26] to the church and everything else and
[1:43:28] that's very welcome
[1:43:29] and I asked come he dropped down there
[1:43:31] to meet you because he said please see a
[1:43:32] lifetime you know I mean if you buy on
[1:43:35] yourself you make 30 and you're coming
[1:43:37] to three dollars you know
[1:43:45] but you see he was always a liar
[1:43:48] but this is a liar being judged
[1:43:51] because judgment begins up
[1:43:53] the house of God and this is not change
[1:43:55] and that liar who was lying all the time
[1:43:57] didn't understand his physical change is
[1:43:59] coming normal normal drop down dead the
[1:44:01] one I have issue with is the wife
[1:44:03] because the wife living with him
[1:44:05] he knows he's a liar she's sleeping with
[1:44:07] him
[1:44:07] she reckon with him she having breakfast
[1:44:09] with him she know the man she didn't
[1:44:10] remarried and she backing that up

[1:44:27] family our family businesses you know
[1:44:30] it's the wit
[1:44:33] is this all Yes it packs you out too
[1:44:37] afterwards no man joined to them you
[1:44:39] know
[1:44:42] people who want an extension on their
[1:44:43] life they
[1:44:44] stay in far
[1:44:46] because judgments start to strike the
[1:44:48] church God's right God's payment God's
[1:44:52] righteous Justice was being melted out
[1:44:55] and the prophets say it will repeat
[1:44:58] that means God will come again
[1:45:01] in vengeance
[1:45:02] in rat in righteous Justice to deal with
[1:45:06] the issues that has been untouched
[1:45:09] for years
[1:45:10] because God Wrath is not in many years
[1:45:12] people think it canceled not so fast
[1:45:15] Hallelujah he said vengeance is mine I
[1:45:18] will repay
[1:45:20] in time
[1:45:21] and due time
[1:45:22] oh my praise God he said for the better
[1:45:26] shorter than a man can shut himself on
[1:45:27] it a narrower covering narrow down they
[1:45:30] could wrap himself in it for the Lord
[1:45:31] shall rise up as in monk purism he shall
[1:45:33] be wrought as in the valley of gibeon
[1:45:35] that he may do his work his strange work
[1:45:37] and bring the passage active stranger
[1:45:39] now therefore be not Marcus at least
[1:45:42] your bands be made strong if I have
[1:45:45] heard from the Lord God I hosts a
[1:45:47] consumption even determined on the whole
[1:45:49] it that last verse here says now
[1:45:52] therefore do not discovered least the
[1:45:54] bands which bind you be made strong for
[1:45:57] a decree of Destruction have I heard
[1:45:59] from The Lord of hosts upon the whole
[1:46:01] Land of the Dead
[1:46:03] o praise God now
[1:46:06] help me Jesus
[1:46:09] look for
[1:46:11] verse 16 and he came to Nazareth where
[1:46:14] he had been brought up as his customers
[1:46:17] he went in the synagogue on the Sabbath
[1:46:19] day to read
[1:46:21] and there was delivered unto him the
[1:46:22] book of The Prophet his eyes and when he
[1:46:24] had opened the book he found the place
[1:46:26] where it was written and that's where he
[1:46:28] read from this morning Isaiah 61. this
[1:46:30] is Jesus now in verse 18 of Luke chapter
[1:46:33] 4 says the spirit of the Lord is upon me
[1:46:35] because he has anointed me to preach the
[1:46:37] gospel to the poor he sent me to heal
[1:46:39] the brokenhearted to preach the
[1:46:41] Deliverance of the captives to
[1:46:42] recovering of the sight of the blind to
[1:46:44] say that Liberty them that approves to
[1:46:46] preach the acceptably of the Lord then
[1:46:48] he closed the book
[1:46:50] so Jesus didn't continue on to read what
[1:46:54] we read to declare the dear Vengeance of
[1:46:56] our God
[1:46:57] he stopped right at the acceptable year
[1:47:00] because that was the Year of Jubilee
[1:47:02] they have released this was the ministry
[1:47:05] of Jesus Christ being identified by the
[1:47:09] scripture to fulfill that portion here
[1:47:13] at that time
[1:47:15] so then he closed the book
[1:47:18] he give it again to the minister sat
[1:47:20] down on the eyes of all them that were
[1:47:22] in a single synagogue were fasten on him
[1:47:24] and he began to say unto them this day
[1:47:27] is the scripture fulfilled in your ears

[1:48:12] deliver from the earth I'll draw all men
[1:48:13] unto me he is cutting you out now
[1:48:16] cutting you down to his word only
[1:48:18] cutting all the trees and dogmas and
[1:48:21] everything away from you trying to get
[1:48:24] back a bride for the son

[1:48:43] what God Said you want to meet God's
[1:48:45] requirement let's continue
[1:48:47] Butter Brown
[1:48:49] Jesus couldn't take the place you
[1:48:51] remember when he they read the that day
[1:48:54] in the book he read just part of the
[1:48:57] prophecy left the rest of it is for the
[1:49:00] last day
[1:49:01] we are supposed to take that part
[1:49:04] what part
[1:49:05] the day of vengeance
[1:49:08] the bride
[1:49:09] is to take that part
[1:49:12] so you see he has he wants to cut the
[1:49:15] church out just like he did the Sun out
[1:49:17] like he did the bride and the groom to
[1:49:19] be his bride you must be part of him not
[1:49:23] part of a Creed not part of the church
[1:49:25] not part of the nomination but the part
[1:49:28] of him hewed out of any other kind of a
[1:49:32] form
[1:49:33] it won't work
[1:49:35] you got to be hewed from the word

[1:50:01] flesh you are asked to identify yourself
[1:50:04] in him by the same word to be a
[1:50:06] masterpiece for the bride
[1:50:09] so who went into the temple
[1:50:11] Jesus Christ
[1:50:13] who from the scripture Jesus Christ who
[1:50:16] read the word Jesus Christ who stopped
[1:50:18] in the middle of a scripture Jesus
[1:50:21] Christ because he knew that last part
[1:50:23] was for no
[1:50:27] for a bride to pick up
[1:50:29] the day of Vengeance of our God
[1:50:31] Hallelujah now I know some brothers
[1:50:34] fight they fight me when I share that
[1:50:36] the faithful Ministry is not man's
[1:50:38] Ministry
[1:50:39] the faithful Ministry is the ministry of
[1:50:41] Jesus Christ and by God this this proves
[1:50:44] it in a big big way because vengeance is
[1:50:47] mine no man can pick up Vengeance no man
[1:50:51] could pick up that scripture human it
[1:50:53] has to be Jesus Christ back again in our
[1:50:56] faithful Ministry to pick up that part
[1:50:59] of the scripture to declare that the
[1:51:00] offensions of God our God hallelujah
[1:51:03] because God already says vengeance is
[1:51:06] mine so no man in a position to take a
[1:51:09] God's right to display God's Wrath I

[1:51:14] I hear so-called prophets pronounce this
[1:51:16] and pronounce judgment and speaking this

[2:08:50] joined for we access in Jesus name oh my
[2:08:54] hallelujah oh glory to God where many in
[2:08:56] homes just now Hallelujah but
[2:08:59] abandonment is such a perfect man he
[2:09:00] said let's turn to Ephesians 4 I begin
[2:09:03] to read and give some Apostles some
[2:09:05] prophets remember last night don't try
[2:09:07] to take the other man's office some
[2:09:09] evangelists some pastors some teachers
[2:09:11] for the Perfection of God does it read
[2:09:13] like that no the Perfection of what sins
[2:09:16] who are the Saints the sanctify ones the
[2:09:18] one that started from down there
[2:09:19] Perfection of the Saints for the working
[2:09:21] of the ministry then he bought the
[2:09:24] ministry of Jesus Christ
[2:09:25] so that's working of the ministry is
[2:09:27] that we run up and the only place doing
[2:09:28] this and doing that the real work of the
[2:09:30] ministry is whose Ministry is the
[2:09:32] ministry of Jesus Christ so the faithful
[2:09:34] Ministry really is the ministry of Jesus
[2:09:36] Christ in the form of a pastor in the
[2:09:39] form of evangelist in the form of a
[2:09:40] prophet in the form of a teacher in the
[2:09:43] form of an apostle forgive the Lord some
[2:09:45] Praises hallelujah hallelujah so the
[2:09:49] ministry of Jesus Christ can't preach
[2:09:50] foolishness let me search Jesus Christ
[2:09:52] can't preach false Doctrine the
[2:09:53] administer Jesus Christ God be a liar
[2:09:55] glory to God who will just kind of bring
[2:09:58] forth prophecy or give the Lord some
[2:10:00] Praises what our ministry is for till we
[2:10:02] all come to the units of the faith the
[2:10:04] knowledge of the Son of God unto the
[2:10:05] measure the statue of perfect man
[2:10:08] oh my
[2:10:10] God so when Jesus died he means she
[2:10:11] wasn't over how many knows that he went
[2:10:13] on to preach the soul that was in prison
[2:10:15] when the preacher's Souls that could not
[2:10:17] be saved and he said I will repeat again
[2:10:20] people that cannot be saved have to
[2:10:21] listen and hear this message preaching
[2:10:23] his power
[2:10:24] Oh Glory to God hallelujah people that
[2:10:27] sat under the anointed Oh Glory to God
[2:10:29] isn't that right he said Jesus after he
[2:10:32] had finished his ministry preached those
[2:10:33] Souls that were unsavable
[2:10:35] that could never ever be saved now the
[2:10:38] Bible said he went and preached the
[2:10:39] souls that were imprisoned that repented
[2:10:42] not when mercy was given to them the
[2:10:44] spurred Mercy now their Witten judgment
[2:10:46] what a time that must have been
[2:10:48] and Jesus said himself as the father
[2:10:50] sent me so send that you and as the
[2:10:52] father sent him to preach to the living
[2:10:53] to those who had hope and then present
[2:10:56] the same message to those who had no
[2:10:57] hope it seems to fit in at this time
[2:10:59] that will have to be done because the
[2:11:02] spirit of Christ Living in US does not
[2:11:04] change the nature of him it does not
[2:11:06] change God's system he must be the same
[2:11:09] in every generation as my father sent me
[2:11:12] so send that you the Ministries
[2:11:15] must be the same
[2:11:19] he ain't so much in John 14 12 he that
[2:11:21] believeth on me the work that I do shall
[2:11:23] do also see The Works preaching to the
[2:11:26] Lost Healing The Sick identity
[2:11:28] impossibility ever be saved the work
[2:11:31] went on just the same may I put it like
[2:11:33] this this is Brother Branham no this is
[2:11:35] not me may I put it like this
[2:11:38] the ministry of Jesus Christ
[2:11:41] reincarnated in his church in this last
[2:11:44] day
[2:11:46] same Jesus
[2:11:50] same healer
[2:11:52] same baptizer same person
[2:11:55] coming to a gentile bride Oh Glory to
[2:11:58] God hallelujah praise God
[2:12:01] let's go
[2:12:02] now the debtings of yesterday the
[2:12:04] message of Luther the message of Wesley
[2:12:06] the message of Pentecost
[2:12:07] if it can only go through the process of
[2:12:12] God's holy spirit
[2:12:14] and the word of a Vindication it will
[2:12:16] bring forth the reflection of Jesus
[2:12:18] Christ
[2:12:22] bring forth Jesus Christ
[2:12:26] watch
[2:12:28] it's got to be molded into something so
[2:12:31] watch the words now Luther has got to be
[2:12:33] molded into Wesley Wesley has got to be
[2:12:36] molded into Pentecost and the Pentecost
[2:12:38] has got to be molded into Christ
[2:12:40] and that's where the Pentecostal Mission
[2:12:42] because the only stuff that gives
[2:12:43] because Christ after coming by the word
[2:12:45] and the word comes that Prophet they
[2:12:48] reject the prophet they reject the word
[2:12:49] they reject the word there is at the
[2:12:50] image so the Pentecostal never got into
[2:12:53] the image of Jesus Christ
[2:12:55] but the promise for us is the our hearts
[2:12:57] must be turned back
[2:12:59] to the faith of the fathers so we're
[2:13:01] going right back to what they had in
[2:13:03] their Pentecost nothing less nothing
[2:13:05] different no new Holy Ghost
[2:13:08] [Applause]
[2:13:09] no moral mystery conquering that it's
[2:13:12] the same Holy Spirit
[2:13:13] [Applause]
[2:13:15] people don't want to go near it
[2:13:18] but it's good enough for me
[2:13:20] it is part of the all-time religion
[2:13:22] is that the old-time Holy Spirit
[2:13:25] people stop jumping in this message
[2:13:26] people Hallelujah in this message
[2:13:28] they're sitting on hearing hearing
[2:13:30] hearing they're recognizing nothing
[2:13:32] therefore they can act upon what they're
[2:13:34] hearing what can the Lord I shout but if
[2:13:37] you recognize this message yes you hear
[2:13:39] it and recognize it you can act upon it
[2:13:42] National Force
[2:13:44] put Israel in the Homeland National
[2:13:46] Force will put the people in the world
[2:13:49] come to the churches but the power of
[2:13:51] God
[2:13:52] will put the people in The Bride and
[2:13:55] that's what we come to church for to
[2:13:57] connect with the power of God no man to
[2:14:00] question the pride but the power could
[2:14:02] put you in that Pride
[2:14:04] or give the Lord some praises
[2:14:06] oh we love him this morning
[2:14:08] hallelujah hallelujah Glory look
[2:14:11] according in
[2:14:13] thank you Lord
[2:14:15] so watch Pentecost has gotten more into
[2:14:17] Christ it goes to a possess so as the
[2:14:20] gospel going to a process it is
[2:14:22] processing Lucid age justification we

[2:34:12] recorded as a man thinking in his heart
[2:34:14] so is he your voice is louder in heaven
[2:34:17] I mean your thoughts are louder in
[2:34:20] heaven than your voices on Earth
[2:34:21] certainly God knows the thoughts and
[2:34:23] intents of the heart he said to the
[2:34:25] Pharisee you Hypocrites how can you
[2:34:27] speak good things and out of the
[2:34:28] abundance of your heart speak at the
[2:34:29] mouth calling me master good so he sorry
[2:34:32] good Master but they were Hypocrites
[2:34:34] Hallelujah pray don't be a hypocrite
[2:34:36] what will it be on that day when the
[2:34:38] voice Thunders out of many Waters many
[2:34:40] churches forming out Hallelujah let me
[2:34:43] take a wrap up here now wow
[2:34:45] London
[2:34:47] in 1933
[2:34:49] coach spoke to him this is the woman's
[2:34:51] Nation it's a number 13. it appears in
[2:34:53] the 13th chapter of Revelation 13 stars
[2:34:55] 13 stripes everything is 13 everything
[2:34:57] is a woman remember thus he at the Lord
[2:35:00] there will be a woman rule before the
[2:35:02] end time
[2:35:03] she'll either be president vice
[2:35:05] president or it will be the Catholic
[2:35:08] Church as a woman
[2:35:09] I have seen her
[2:35:12] did not guess
[2:35:14] saw it therefore you could speak it a
[2:35:17] great woman the nation bowed to her it
[2:35:20] will be one of the end time thus say the
[2:35:23] Lord write it down find out you young
[2:35:25] people see if it happens if it isn't I'm
[2:35:27] a false prophet Hallelujah
[2:35:30] glory to God hallelujah
[2:35:33] 1962 this is the 4th of February was a
[2:35:36] community service communion actually he
[2:35:39] talked about the stars that was getting
[2:35:40] fights as a line and he said was that's
[2:35:42] gsus Greece and so like that God if ever
[2:35:45] God sends his power to the church it
[2:35:47] will be his grace
[2:35:49] I'm almost finishing
[2:35:51] It Won't Be The Obedience of the people
[2:35:54] so God come in in time and season to
[2:35:57] fulfill his promised word but that
[2:35:59] connects to what God told the prophet
[2:36:00] because then right he said he at that
[2:36:03] time acted at that time to fulfill his
[2:36:05] word
[2:36:06] is that right
[2:36:07] if God ever sent his power to the church
[2:36:09] it'll be his grace it wouldn't be
[2:36:11] Obedience of the people and Isaiah said
[2:36:13] in the 40th chapter to cry to Jerusalem
[2:36:15] that a Warfare is over yet she was
[2:36:17] guilty of adultery
[2:36:19] but it was God's grace that was sending
[2:36:21] it if God here we go Church sends
[2:36:24] anything to us it will be his grace
[2:36:27] not our merits
[2:36:29] Oh Glory to God hallelujah Revelation 6
[2:36:34] 12. and I be held when he had opened the
[2:36:37] six seal low there was a great
[2:36:39] earthquake
[2:36:40] and the sun became black a sakota's ear
[2:36:42] and the moon became his blood
[2:36:45] origin 16 17-21 and the seventh angel
[2:36:48] Port is vile unto the air
[2:36:51] and there came a great voice out of
[2:36:52] Heaven from the throne say it is done
[2:36:55] and there were voices and Thunders and
[2:36:56] lightens and there was a great
[2:36:58] earthquake such as was not since men
[2:37:00] were upon the Earth so mighty and
[2:37:02] earthquake and so great and the great
[2:37:04] city that was divided into three parts
[2:37:06] and the cities of the Nations fell and
[2:37:09] great Babylon came and remembered before
[2:37:10] God to give unto her the cup of the wine
[2:37:13] of the fiestas of Israel
[2:37:15] so called vengeance comes with intensity
[2:37:19] comes with purpose
[2:37:21] comes with anger that is called
[2:37:23] vengeance Hallelujah watch on every
[2:37:27] island fled away
[2:37:28] and the monkeys were not found
[2:37:30] and they fell upon men a Great Hero to
[2:37:32] Heaven every stone about a weight about
[2:37:34] talent and Men blaspheme God because of
[2:37:37] the plague of the hill and the plague

[3:05:44] gonna formalize the dates but we do want
[3:05:47] to have a special youth activity you
[3:05:49] could pencil the date in on the 28th of
[3:05:52] January which is the last Saturday of
[3:05:55] this month we would have a special youth
[3:05:57] activity here at the Tabernacle and also
[3:06:01] you can also pencil in on the 21st of
[3:06:04] January which is next week Saturday we
[3:06:06] want to have our power our time of
[3:06:08] prayer downstairs here at the Tabernacle
[3:06:11] as well and just an announcement about
[3:06:14] Sunday School uh Sunday school will
[3:06:16] resume at a date to be announced later
[3:06:19] in January so stay tuned for that
[3:06:22] parents and in the meantime we really
[3:06:24] encourage the parents to have
[3:06:27] conversations with your children
[3:06:34] a pause with it this again a little bit
[3:06:37] we live in a world where people don't
[3:06:39] have the right conversations in the
[3:06:41] homes enough
[3:06:42] we live it up to school teachers and
[3:06:44] friends and videos and games and the
[3:06:47] internet so we want to encourage you to
[3:06:49] be active in telling them the right
[3:06:51] thing
[3:06:52] telling them about the law telling them
[3:06:54] about the right thing because the
[3:06:55] influence is out there and it's 24 7.
[3:06:58] it's a constant bombarding of this and
[3:07:01] this and this you're known as having a
[3:07:03] conversation with my wife about being
[3:07:04] young in primary school and I get
[3:07:06] nothing back at how peer pressure worked
[3:07:08] and and all these little things and and
[3:07:10] how hard it is now compared to that time
[3:07:13] you know so we want to encourage you
[3:07:15] parents to keep talking to your children
[3:07:17] encourage them to serve God and also put
[3:07:20] some boundaries with social media and
[3:07:22] technology and these things
[3:07:23] you cannot walk blind as if you don't
[3:07:26] know it what is in your house wasn't in
[3:07:28] your house 20 30 40 years ago
[3:07:32] you know when they say shoot the TV no
[3:07:34] TV on your phone
[3:07:37] and we unfortunately we can't shoot the
[3:07:38] phone
[3:07:41] so you have to use now the new methods
[3:07:43] of shooting and protecting and defending
[3:07:46] because he never will do everything he
[3:07:47] could do so be an active participant
[3:07:50] parents in having this conversation with
[3:07:52] your children is really an encouragement
[3:07:53] to this and to keep praying uh in your
[3:07:56] homes establish your own prayer altar
[3:07:59] don't wait just for Zoom prayer meeting
[3:08:01] or service cover time in your home for
[3:08:04] family prayer
[3:08:08] if you're in your house by yourself you
[3:08:10] cover time and set a timetable if you're
[3:08:11] there with your family come together set
[3:08:13] a timetable make it a time of prayer
[3:08:16] I much rather you do five minutes again
[3:08:17] as a family than to do nothing at all
[3:08:20] but put it as a priority put it on your
[3:08:22] calendar put it on your schedule that's
[3:08:25] the discipline that sees your results it
[3:08:28] it all adds up you know that's why you
[3:08:30] could pour the vial of your prayer
[3:08:31] because you're putting something in it
[3:08:32] all the time can the Church Say Amen
[3:08:35] and a reminder just lastly
[3:08:38] we live in a technological world but
[3:08:40] certainly when you come into this
[3:08:42] building coming to the sanctuary coming
[3:08:44] to the house of God remember to either
[3:08:46] switch off your mobile devices or put
[3:08:49] them on silent so there's no
[3:08:51] interruption in the sanctuary so may the
[3:08:54] Lord Richard bless you have a wonderful
[3:08:56] week stay on the firing line and I find
[3:08:59] myself saying this more and more
[3:09:00] maintain your testimony
[3:09:04] maintain your testimony situations come
[3:09:07] to for you to lose your testimony
[3:09:10] but think it through how do I maintain
[3:09:13] my testimony will this response maintain
[3:09:16] my testimony will this conversation
[3:09:17] maintain my testimony and that maintain
[3:09:20] your testimony is based on an assumption
[3:09:22] that you have a testimony so if you
[3:09:25] don't have a testimony then get one and
[3:09:26] then maintain it so may the Lord richly
[3:09:29] bless you with Anthony
[3:09:30] [Music]
