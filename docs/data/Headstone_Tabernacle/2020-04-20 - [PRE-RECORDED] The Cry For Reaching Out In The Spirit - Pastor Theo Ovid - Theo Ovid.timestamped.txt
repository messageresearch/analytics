[22:23] blessed be the name of the Lord
[22:26] so we tangoed for his love and His mercy
[22:28] and I know by know all you must have
[22:31] heard what happened in Paris
[22:33] with all these shootings and the
[22:36] terrorists and so on like that and that
[22:38] is because there was a slight doubt by
[22:43] cyril an interpretation of what god said
[22:47] and then when sara instruct abraham to
[22:52] go at Higa it producer ishmael and these
[22:55] are ishmael children whose father is
[22:57] Ibrahim hallelujah and God said what
[23:01] would happen the last days tisha begins
[23:03] every man and every man shall be again
[23:05] sir this is what you're seeing here this
[23:08] is Scriptures be fulfilled but you know
[23:11] I'm thinking about how it sounds so
[23:12] horrible and terrible and so devastating
[23:15] and everything else and and people just
[23:18] in a kind of horror mode or what
[23:19] happened in France but when you look at
[23:22] it in this spiritual realm and see how
[23:25] demoness
[23:26] and terrorists invade homes lies and
[23:31] families know sometimes season sends
[23:34] suicide bombers right in the church come
[23:38] first short time with the exclusives
[23:40] they blow up and take somebody with them
[23:44] otherwise true people plumb off the
[23:47] beaten path agents of the enemy
[23:51] spiritual warfare we don't look at that
[23:54] we just look at the outside shell but
[23:56] when you look deeply in the spirit realm
[23:58] did recognize we truly wrestle not
[24:00] against flesh and blood but against
[24:03] principalities and powers and spiritual
[24:06] wickedness in high places
[24:07] this is serious friends that devil is
[24:10] not playing he's out to rub he thought
[24:13] out to steal he's out to destroy and
[24:16] some of us walking like nothing is
[24:17] happening walking like if we have not
[24:20] concerned in the world
[24:21] no burden no concern but God want us to
[24:24] have a passion to know his word a
[24:27] passion for his will a passion to
[24:30] understand what is the intelligence and
[24:32] mind of God for his season now because
[24:35] the Bible said they're gonna come
[24:36] perplexities of Nations this disappear
[24:40] this stress of the nations isn't that
[24:42] right they don't know what to do what do

[34:52] chapter four verse one and two second
[34:55] Kings chapter tree this is story of G
[35:00] harem
[35:01] some of eheh partnering with more and
[35:06] more doing against him then he went king
[35:10] of Judah Jehoshaphat as it was and also

[35:20] battle bit more and is a tree cleaners
[35:24] people there isn't that right and when
[35:30] they went out to fight they recognized
[35:32] there is no water for the horse and for
[35:35] the castle that was following them so
[35:38] then they caught the conclusion the king
[35:41] of Israel that maybe the Lord will
[35:43] deliver us tree in 300 more because
[35:48] things not working on for us regard a
[35:50] fight and there's no water so
[35:53] Jehoshaphat said isn't there a prophet
[35:56] of the Lord
[35:58] that will me inquire of him one of the
[36:01] servants eight days Elijah so we
[36:04] continue story from verse 12 and she was
[36:07] the fat said the word of the Lord's with
[36:09] him so the king of Israel and she was a
[36:14] fact and the king of Edom went down to
[36:17] him said they gonna see Elijah now verse
[36:19] 13 and Elijah said unto the king of
[36:22] Israel what have I to do with thee
[36:26] goddess man was evil and on not as bad
[36:29] as he have but evil all the same so
[36:33] Elijah first response was what have I to
[36:37] do with thee get thee to the profits of
[36:40] thy father
[36:42] until the profits of thy mother and the
[36:45] king of Israel at him nay for the Lord
[36:48] had called these three kings together to
[36:50] deliver them into the hands of more

[2:17:30] guard duty and the rebels was across the
[2:17:33] river and this boy walking along here
[2:17:36] kind of DS along with the dreams of his

[2:17:39] he left his post of duty and went on to
[2:17:41] put some violets this ain't a sweet out
[2:17:43] he didn't mean to do wrong
[2:17:45] he went then at that time there was a

[2:18:06] that boy was shot an hour later they
[2:18:09] didn't have no objection to him pickin
[2:18:11] valance it wasn't that he done it what
[2:18:15] he didn't do he didn't stand at this
[2:18:19] post of duty
[2:18:20] he didn't guard the post like he was
[2:18:22] supposed to and he spoiled the whole day
[2:18:26] nothing wrong with picking violence with
[2:18:28] that but not then
[2:18:31] it is war you have a post-it half enemy

[2:18:48] supposed to stand in supposed to duty
[2:18:49] and he got killed
[2:18:51] oh let's do something let's stick with
[2:18:55] all our hearts i when the day of
[2:18:57] judgment come we can say God I did the
[2:19:00] very best I could and you know I did and
[2:19:03] we know that we can do that's all it
[2:19:05] expected I when it get to a place that
[2:19:07] the people that love God will show
[2:19:09] everything that got into the revival
[2:19:11] with prayer seek God's face seek God's
[2:19:14] face call out in the order of the night
[2:19:16] for mercy and get the name but even so
[2:19:18] for I'll tell you we will stop the mode
[2:19:20] of every critic we will not know every
[2:19:22] formal thing that's standing up and
[2:19:24] that's in the camp Oh hallelujah then he
[2:19:28] said the other night I was coming over
[2:19:29] here a few nights ago and the Lord met
[2:19:32] me in the room with a vision the same as
[2:19:34] I see on the platform of the places and
[2:19:35] said here's what the matter with the
[2:19:37] church they've got so much selfishness
[2:19:39] everywhere the Church of the Living God
[2:19:41] has got so much difference so much did
[2:19:44] that till they grieve the Holy Spirit
[2:19:46] away from them and that's what's exactly
[2:19:49] what it is brother sister until we
[2:19:51] humble ourselves and become a like lamb
[2:19:52] so the tough can lead us again Oh
[2:19:55] hallelujah
[2:19:57] he saved the composer writes something
[2:19:59] we find out it is not acted right then
[2:20:02] there's something that happens there's
[2:20:03] something like him when we see he who
[2:20:05] composed it made it up wrote it out and
[2:20:07] the symphony explain it out it's the
[2:20:10] wrong note is something wrong the
[2:20:11] director give the wrong motion he said
[2:20:14] we are way over here in the book now oh
[2:20:16] let me release it and that's the matter
[2:20:19] today my Lutheran veteran my Baptist
[2:20:20] brethren Pentecost our brethren we can't
[2:20:22] live in the light of Luther he was a
[2:20:24] reformer we appreciate his part but we
[2:20:27] play that out we are way over here at
[2:20:30] the back of the book was he's talking
[2:20:32] about the Tundra's he said we are way
[2:20:34] over here in the back of the book we
[2:20:37] and paint up like that and the only way
[2:20:39] watch you are ever going to be able to
[2:20:41] do it my brethren is this region of the
[2:20:45] world or different paths of the world I
[2:20:47] might say there's only one way for the
[2:20:50] director to do is to get in the same
[2:20:51] spirit of the composer hallelujah that's
[2:20:56] when the church is in the symphony in
[2:20:58] the same spirit of the composer and the
[2:21:01] five whole directors or the men's of the
[2:21:02] record could direct with the same tune
[2:21:04] we are not called to write our own
[2:21:06] script but a Branum already wrote the
[2:21:09] music we supposed to direct it and say
