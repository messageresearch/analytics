[26:19] now Judas said unto him not Iscariot
[26:21] Lord how is it that thou would manifest
[26:24] thyself under us
[26:25] anat onto the world and Jesus went
[26:27] explained jesus answered and said unto

[26:32] words and my father will love him and we
[26:35] will come unto Him and make our board
[26:38] with him he that loveth me not keep it
[26:42] not my scenes and the word which he hear
[26:46] is not mine but the fathers which sent
[26:49] me these things have I spoken unto you
[26:51] being present with you but the comforter
[26:54] which is the Holy Ghost whom the father
[26:56] will send in my name he shall teach you
[26:59] all things and bring all things to your
[27:01] remembrance whatsoever I have said unto
[27:03] you we turn to Matthew chapter 21 or
[27:06] honoré from verse 23
[27:15] and when he had come unto the temple the
[27:17] chief priests and the elders of the
[27:18] people came under him as he was teaching
[27:21] and said by what authority does dog by
[27:27] what authority doest all these things
[27:29] and who gives the DISA thority and jesus
[27:33] answered and said unto them i also will
[27:35] ask you one thing which if you tell me
[27:38] iein likewise will tell you by what
[27:41] authority I do these things the baptism
[27:44] of John winds was it from heaven or men
[27:47] and the reason within themselves with
[27:50] themselves saying if we shall see from
[27:52] heaven he will say unto us why did you
[27:54] not then believe him but if we shall see
[27:57] of men we fear the people for all hold
[27:59] John as a prophet and they the answered
[28:03] Jesus and said we cannot tell he said
[28:05] unto them neither would tell I you by
[28:07] what authority I do these things but
[28:09] what Tinky a certain man had two sons
[28:12] and he came to the first and said son go
[28:15] walk today into my van ad and he
[28:17] answered and said I will not but after
[28:20] what he repented and went and he came to
[28:22] the second and said likewise and he said
[28:24] answered and said I go sir and went not
[28:27] whether of them Twain did the will of
[28:30] his father they said unto Him the first
[28:33] and jesus said unto them verily I say
[28:35] unto you that the publicans and the
[28:38] harlots go into the kingdom of God
[28:40] before you for John came unto you in the
[28:44] way of righteousness and you believed
[28:46] him not but the publicans and the
[28:48] harlots believed him and ye when you
[28:52] have seen it repented not afterwards
[28:54] that you might believe him may God bless
[28:56] this wood you may be seated or this is a
[28:57] powerful scriptures tonight or praise
[29:00] the name of the Lord blessed be the name
[29:02] of the Lord you love him and serve Him
[29:05] but the title tonight is if you love me
[29:10] that's what Jesus said right
[29:13] he said it in in in verse fifteen of
[29:16] Saint John 14 if you love me keep my
[29:18] Commandments ahktar dattari from there
[29:20] if you love me not returning one of a
[29:23] parable Savva inspiration the will of
[29:25] the Father and this is brother Branham
[29:27] we're saying here dear Jesus help us
[29:30] tonight in these two words as we wait
[29:32] upon D and we pray that your grace and
[29:34] mercy will be with us Lord and tender
[29:36] hearts move back all the shocks the
[29:38] thorns thistles let the Blessed sunshine
[29:41] of God fall in upon the word Lord and
[29:43] may we have such a great meeting till
[29:46] there not be an unsaved person among us
[29:48] all the children will be in the kingdom
[29:50] of God
[29:51] doors without the baptism of the Spirit
[29:54] May Day receive it father may all the
[29:57] great mysteries that we are supposed to
[30:00] know at this age Lord reveal unveiled to
[30:03] us that we that we will see the
[30:07] plainness of God so that we will know
[30:11] how to behave ourselves and act
[30:14] correcting ourselves and bringing the
[30:17] members of our body into the discipline
[30:21] to the word that we might know how to
[30:23] live in this present day at the
[30:25] approaching of the Lord Jesus so he said
[30:33] that the mystery we supposed to know
[30:38] may it be unveiled and once it's unveil
[30:42] it's to bring the word plane to us that
[30:46] God can be made known to you being me
[30:49] plane to you here what for that we may
[30:52] know how to behave now how to talk how
[30:58] to behave so all the teachings and all
[31:03] the mysteries are not a revelation is to
[31:06] bring you and I into a behavior
[31:09] because talk is talk and the Bible give
[31:13] the parable of these two sons one said I
[31:16] will not and the other one said I will
[31:18] go sir the first son changed his mind
[31:21] and went and do what was supposed to be
[31:23] done the second son said he's willing
[31:25] I'll go so I talked and didn't do it
[31:28] which one did the will of the Father and
[31:30] Jesus busted those hypocrites he busted
[31:34] them and tell them them Hallett's and
[31:36] prostitutes and all kind of people
[31:38] they're gonna get to the kingdom of God
[31:40] before you because it's not a talking
[31:43] thing this is a walking thing he's not
[31:46] walking they're not talking now you have
[31:47] to walk the talk or glory to God you
[31:50] have to walk in this light is that that
[31:52] talking thing is an appointment thing of
[31:54] teaching thing no you've got to come
[31:56] down and to conform yourself to the Word
[31:58] of God if you love me keep my
[32:02] Commandments not talk my Commandments do
[32:07] I ask out in the house do I a man and a
[32:10] house you have to warn to keep his
[32:12] Commandments or you have to want to obey
[32:14] his word that means you content
[32:17] obedience of his word that leader come
[32:20] into obedience to his will and then the
[32:22] blessing of God began to follow you or
[32:25] glory to publicize your walking and
[32:26] God's will hallelujah do believe that
[32:29] let's continue to be born of the Spirit
[32:32] is to believe and behave yourself in the
[32:36] spirit to understand and believe in your
[32:39] heart that Jesus is the Christ and this
[32:42] is this word and no other words can be
[32:44] added to it or taken from it without
[32:46] your name take note of the book of life
[32:48] that's a strong one if you add one
[32:51] printed your tradition take from it he
[32:53] said well Christ Himself said your name
[32:55] shall be robbed of the book of life
[32:57] no gonna skip a little bit you know I'm
[33:00] read it again to be born of the Spirit
[33:02] is to believe and behave yourself in the
[33:06] spirit it's not your doing anything are
[33:08] you doing your thing and you're
[33:09] Christian oh no I believe I'm behaved
[33:14] you believe the words I've got to be him
[33:15] yourself and that will show you a born
[33:18] of the spirits when they could believe
[33:20] and behave yourself in the spirit let's
[33:23] continue Jesus a they must be born again
[33:25] in all to be born again it's letting
[33:27] yourself go and die and the Spirit of
[33:29] Christ coming to you then you are no
[33:31] more yours it is Christ in you the Holy
[33:34] Spirit Paul sighed ideally yet I live
[33:37] you're not i but Christ liveth and me
[33:39] oh praise God now if I told you the
[33:41] spirit of John Dillinger will be me I'll
[33:43] have guns and be an outlaw
[33:45] if I am told you that the spirit of an
[33:46] artist you expect me to paint the
[33:48] picture of an artist if I tell you I'm a
[33:50] Christian and the sweat of Christ is in
[33:52] me then we will do the works of Christ

[33:56] believeth on me the works that I do
[33:58] shall you do also no excuses no excuses

[34:30] heart for a manifested reality you want
[34:33] this word to come alive you want a dead
[34:35] man behind the pulpit you want people to
[34:37] die out you want to be surrendered to
[34:39] the Lord let's have a price that have a
[34:41] cost all glory to God you put your own
[34:45] soul or glory to God when quarter the

[43:51] seated
[43:52] hallelujah it is God in her willing and
[43:57] doing his good pleasure
[43:58] he said never forget that you have only
[44:02] one relationship to God and God has only
[44:06] one relationship to you that is Jesus
[44:10] and Jesus alone says Jesus alone in the
[44:18] mist right let's continue no day is with
[44:21] seven stars in his right hand this Jesus
[44:26] was alone he have seven what stars in
[44:31] his right hand the right hand or arm
[44:32] signifies the power and authority sums

[1:00:13] if I don't Sunday prophet said preaching
[1:00:17] the word is not very big gospel because
[1:00:19] it would is the seed of the gospel
[1:00:21] because the gospel to be preached is to
[1:00:24] be preached with signs and wonders only
[1:00:25] power of God
[1:00:26] so when he said he will be received
[1:00:30] through my sin we see that me that is a
[1:00:33] season to come because I read it there's
[1:00:36] a vindicated servant of God not people
[1:00:39] just practicing and saying and preaching
[1:00:41] like what are we doing here no that's
[1:00:43] when God's indicate and identify his son
[1:00:45] to say my son hear him when God sent a
[1:00:48] vindicated civil out that's different
[1:00:50] you see some just went but God have some
[1:00:53] he will sent it has sent and went is
[1:00:56] that who went is who God sent or glory
[1:00:59] to God and to send him Jesus say how he
[1:01:01] gonna send them as my father sent me
[1:01:03] come on now so send I you and the father
[1:01:07] who sent him went in him then Jesus
[1:01:10] could unveil God then the sent one in
[1:01:13] this last is will be able to take the
[1:01:15] veil off of God well Chloe I'm not just
[1:01:18] a word I'm talking about pull the veil
[1:01:20] off of him you know what I'm waiting on
[1:01:23] I'm greeting me he's a little hears hear
[1:01:25] anything that happen and the Prophet was
[1:01:28] ever to unveil that God
[1:01:29] oh I take every spirit under my control
[1:01:33] for the glory of God boom Devils on the
[1:01:36] run Orca the Lord a shout
[1:01:38] we are going to come back to that
[1:01:40] [Applause]
[1:01:44] hallelujah you can't be a seed and
[1:01:48] disagree with the word because the wood
[1:01:51] is a seed and if you add a word how can
[1:01:53] you disagree with it you be this
[1:01:55] disagreeing with yourself you be
[1:01:58] defeating your own purpose so the brand
[1:02:00] will become the word because the spirit
[1:02:03] have to monk the brain and that fulfills
[1:02:05] religion 2017 the spirit and the bride
[1:02:07] say come because the word and the bride
[1:02:10] the bride becomes the word the spirit
[1:02:12] novel upon the bride when that season
[1:02:16] comes this writ has dried up from all
[1:02:18] the earth the bride alone will have the
[1:02:23] spirit she'll be preaching them and
[1:02:25] there is no more salvation
[1:02:27] she'll be present to eternal loss people
[1:02:29] or glory of God you know there will be a
[1:02:32] space a Jubilee space
[1:02:35] for whosoever will and after that space
[1:02:37] is over it will be judgment not man's
[1:02:42] ministry but Christ's ministry to finish
[1:02:45] Isaiah 61 to declare the day of
[1:02:47] vengeance of our God Christ doing that
[1:02:50] to a bride we can judge who we could win
[1:02:53] a judge with our emotions and our

[1:03:57] spirit upon the lead it not I'm a god of
[1:04:00] the audience I'm a god of my people I
[1:04:02] want to come and I'm on my people I want
[1:04:05] to show them I'm God
[1:04:06] Oh glory to God he promised Abraham my

[1:04:12] isn't that right ho glory to God 2
[1:04:14] million people come on

[1:04:21] back evidence show the people something
[1:04:25] cool and bring back the supernatural
[1:04:27] bring back something that they know the
[1:04:30] time explained gives a lot of show right
[1:04:33] I don't know what I knew what you
[1:04:34] thinking about tonight I know I talked
[1:04:38] my bringing a caution on bring in a
[1:04:40] world of script a know bringing every
[1:04:42] dance that is a land beyond the river
[1:04:44] bring in early dance that he is raised
[1:04:46] from the dead bring in evidence that
[1:04:48] seems Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:04:50] today and forever able to heal you able
[1:04:52] to deliver you able to free you able to
[1:04:55] seal you able to give you a fresh vision
[1:05:03] [Music]
[1:05:10] let's continue no that is why Jesus was
[1:05:14] so perfectly manifested God was so
[1:05:18] perfectly manifested in Jesus because he
[1:05:22] was the word of God he was God's Word
[1:05:26] because the word is the conductor of the
[1:05:29] Spirit the conductor less easy to would
[1:05:34] the capita plug in here and expect going
[1:05:36] to go to yes you have a student
[1:05:37] conductor the wires what you put and run
[1:05:41] is what less you will go through true
[1:05:43] well God wire is the word the
[1:05:48] Pentecostal didn't have the wire so when
[1:05:51] the Holy Ghost fell on them they speak
[1:05:52] in tongues everything else but they
[1:05:53] couldn't conform to the word that's why
[1:05:55] they kind of live all kind of crazy like
[1:05:56] I still have signs and wonders because
[1:05:58] that was gifts so he was a prophet to
[1:06:03] bring the word that we could receive the
[1:06:04] world so God not taught me to use a gift
[1:06:07] you using the word in you so any
[1:06:14] anointed peace at all of them in Matthew
[1:06:16] 10 with temporary power to go and preach
[1:06:18] and cast out Devils that was just
[1:06:19] experience and a blessed me give them
[1:06:22] because they didn't have the real thing
[1:06:23] yet until they went in the upper room
[1:06:28] and God give them permanent power Oh
[1:06:31] glory to God with that temporary power
[1:06:41] they was crucified upside on the face
[1:06:44] across the face their child's the face
[1:06:47] the issues because I had resident
[1:06:50] permanent artesian well power Oh glory
[1:06:54] to God he said he that believeth on me
[1:06:56] as the scripture has said out of his
[1:06:58] belly is gonna being shall flow rivers
[1:07:03] of living water
[1:07:05] that's that courts brother that is life
[1:07:08] that's the fountain of life and God want
[1:07:10] to make sure that that's the reason he
[1:07:13] couldn't produce nothing but just
[1:07:14] exactly God and if God is in you what
[1:07:16] more can you be oh my
[1:07:18] all of God's Son and he said God has
[1:07:22] manifested in them what was it the
[1:07:23] spoken word manifested see now all of
[1:07:26] God's sons must be the same to be born
[1:07:29] of the word and spirit brings us back to
[1:07:32] the spoken word again like John tree to
[1:07:35] be born of the water and spirit what
[1:07:37] does it do it brings you right back here
[1:07:40] we go into the place where you should
[1:07:41] have been at the beginning so Adam was
[1:07:45] supposed to reproduce another son of God
[1:07:46] another part of house another power man
[1:07:49] another attribute son of a spirit or
[1:07:53] glory to God but I don't fell in the
[1:07:54] flesh and will and end up in sex right
[1:07:56] and that's what we were born in sin but
[1:07:58] II chromis to bring us right back to
[1:08:00] that by you must be born again of the
[1:08:03] world and the spirit and we couldn't
[1:08:04] really be effectively born until the
[1:08:06] full work him and the full spirit came
[1:08:08] so you send the Prophet about the
[1:08:10] fullness of the world as you could be
[1:08:12] truly born correctly or glory to God
[1:08:15] that we're gonna be in you you are gonna
[1:08:18] become that word then the spiracle
[1:08:20] activate the worldís in you then that's
[1:08:23] the kingdom in you we brought her life
[1:08:26] Oh hallelujah hallelujah the kingdom in
[1:08:31] you and the younger power because the
[1:08:36] kingdom is power the kingdom is like

[1:13:49] family put your foot on faith on that
[1:13:52] [Applause]
[1:13:58] I'm asleep hallelujah that's the reason
[1:14:10] of Christ's debt is to bring us right
[1:14:12] back two sons of God now this brings you
[1:14:16] right back to the spoken word where we
[1:14:19] are God's would made manifest you see
[1:14:21] Jesus said the same thing he that
[1:14:24] believeth on me who I am I come for the
[1:14:26] purpose I do to bring a man back to
[1:14:29] believe the Word of God and take nothing
[1:14:32] else with it the works that I do he will
[1:14:34] do also
[1:14:35] Amanda take the boot Justices see we
[1:14:38] notice the spoken word when we are God's
[1:14:41] then we are God's Word made manifest
[1:14:43] that listen that is how God wants his
[1:14:48] church is to manifest himself this is
[1:14:53] God's will this is God's desire
[1:14:58] hallelujah now watch how can he
[1:15:01] manifests himself unless his own seed is
[1:15:05] in that person
[1:15:07] how can you use your own thoughts and
[1:15:09] God manifest himself through you how can
[1:15:11] you take your own belief and say well my
[1:15:13] pastor teaches my Creed says and so on
[1:15:15] and whatnot he said then Jesus the data
[1:15:18] via has nothing to you
[1:15:19] the works that Jesus did if a man has
[1:15:23] the seed of God in him and the Spirit of
[1:15:27] God listen
[1:15:29] watering that seed so he's bringing the
[1:15:34] spirit as the water to the seed so if we
[1:15:39] only have seed alone that can work you
[1:15:42] need to get the water to the seed and
[1:15:46] the water is what promised watch what if
[1:15:54] a man has a seed of gone in him with the
[1:15:57] Spirit of God watering that seed the
[1:16:00] same works that Jesus was manifested in
[1:16:02] Jesus him being the original seed of God
[1:16:05] his debt
[1:16:06] brings you back to the original seed of
[1:16:09] God and if that same spirit was within
[1:16:12] him is in you then the same works will
[1:16:15] be manifested so you explain how this
[1:16:19] gonna be he said the reason we are so
[1:16:22] much a crash is because how is it
[1:16:27] scrapheap administers it because they're
[1:16:30] trying to do the works of Christ without
[1:16:33] the life of Christ
[1:16:35] so God connects powered character
[1:16:39] because the pentecostal feel being
[1:16:41] gifted and to this day they are still
[1:16:44] gifted some of the gifts of this didn't
[1:16:46] meant somehow gift of healing they still
[1:16:48] have the gifts some of three thousand to
[1:16:50] twenty thousand to ten thousand big
[1:16:52] churches and they still gifted but he's
[1:16:54] not talking about that still the gifts
[1:16:57] from Pentecostal got a ticket from them
[1:16:58] this method what is talk mafia is the
[1:17:00] character and character is not a gift
[1:17:06] it have different healing different
[1:17:09] resentment if of wisdom and all kind of
[1:17:11] gifts if I preach and all that but this
[1:17:13] is not we're talking about this is not a
[1:17:15] gift this is character characters that
[1:17:19] given to you it's built it to your
[1:17:22] child's intestine your place of trial is
[1:17:28] what guarantees you to have character
[1:17:31] [Applause]
[1:17:33] where is he aiming or not to steal the
[1:17:35] to to know so people with the live in
[1:17:42] church that they give them corrupted
[1:17:44] they want to put up out in the head that
[1:17:46] not given a character they know all the
[1:17:47] world all the Bible all the Greek or the
[1:17:49] Hebrew that's still a given character is
[1:17:51] when they get out the church and your
[1:17:52] face their trials and your face
[1:17:54] intestines and your issues in your
[1:17:55] family and issues in the home that is
[1:17:58] what gonna give the character you're
[1:18:00] getting character sittings outta here
[1:18:02] look at the word they've all get to face
[1:18:04] the devil and if you can't say Amen to
[1:18:09] this this night something wrong with you
[1:18:11] yeah just remember get that cap and wear
[1:18:16] it all the Louie is your one character
[1:18:19] you have to understand you're getting
[1:18:21] equipped because in Boots you get
[1:18:22] insured because in equipment the magic
[1:18:24] isn't badge and everything else to go
[1:18:25] out and fight so don't let the devil
[1:18:28] give you fight inside the Berlin you
[1:18:31] have too much the program's outside take
[1:18:32] a fight inside the church here they'll
[1:18:34] both go get fight with me just fight up
[1:18:36] with the world get the word I'm Ty get
[1:18:39] the word and press let the word the word
[1:18:42] is preached and every man every man
[1:18:46] roster way into it or glory to God
[1:18:50] hallelujah what I did young let's see if
[1:18:55] you could wrap up here
[1:19:03] you see if they want the church start
[1:19:05] with the Word of God you want the life
[1:19:07] of God start with the wood of God except
[1:19:10] the Word of God in its fullness every
[1:19:11] measure of it
[1:19:12] and if that is the fullness of God in
[1:19:14] you then the arena's fallen will produce
[1:19:16] exactly what's in your garden the real
[1:19:19] the seed of God is absorbent for this
[1:19:22] spirit all the nominalism is sticking
[1:19:25] out or unbelief take up then the holy
[1:19:26] spirit comes into the gym of life that's
[1:19:29] Lea in there it produces another seed
[1:19:31] another son of God is born I'm a Branham
[1:19:35] because I was born of Charlie and Ella
[1:19:36] Branham that makes me a brand because I
[1:19:39] am their seed there are two agreements
[1:19:41] there sperm together made a season that
[1:19:43] made me when God and his will becomes
[1:19:46] one when God spirit what is the seed of
[1:19:49] God the Word of God it produces God it
[1:19:51] is not the individual it is called for
[1:19:56] you are dead
[1:19:57] you are not yourself no more you reckon
[1:20:00] ourselves dead hollowed out made them
[1:20:02] for the seat Jim I know some other
[1:20:07] ministers fighting me on this
[1:20:09] minister Jesus Christ tell them did you
[1:20:10] have dementia Jesus Christ nobody I know
[1:20:11] how many miseries guys yet it's promised
[1:20:14] because the five for ministry is not men
[1:20:17] the fivefold ministry is the Ministry of
[1:20:20] Jesus Christ in the form of a pasta form
[1:20:23] of a prophet form of evangelist form of
[1:20:25] a teacher form of a puzzle in other
[1:20:28] words it is Christ's ministry in these
[1:20:30] men it is the full seat Jim in them
[1:20:37] because that's what Peter had and when
[1:20:41] he was speaking to Cornelius house when
[1:20:42] he speak the word he's a one period
[1:20:44] slate these words the Holy Ghost fell
[1:20:47] upon them that heard the word because he
[1:20:49] had the full germ in him all seven
[1:20:52] virtues was in him or glory to God
[1:20:56] hallelujah and he said these things
[1:20:59] ought to be tested and proven to be in
[1:21:01] the man you can't preach it after live
[1:21:07] it I need to prove it you have to test
[1:21:12] it you've seen a piece of wood there and
[1:21:18] you think it's solid wood somebody put
[1:21:19] you on hold you hold your whole thing up
[1:21:21] goes to it still my skin all inside yeah
[1:21:24] but look a nice home say and you put
[1:21:27] your finger would make some take all
[1:21:30] this already just to know you have
[1:21:34] patience or temperance oh gosh how about
[1:21:40] boot is that whole vocal test patient
[1:21:43] may give you a quick yeah oh wait and
[1:21:46] when you're waiting you're still waitin
[1:21:48] anything I started finding waiting too
[1:21:50] long you know something I write because
[1:21:53] faith could work with patience for the
[1:21:55] promise to be confirmed and patients
[1:21:58] must have it's perfect work and it's a
[1:22:00] perfectionist patience with an onboard
[1:22:02] and within for God ha ha ha
[1:22:05] so God has make you wait and in not
[1:22:07] waiting discipline on that happen and
[1:22:10] that happen and that temptation and
[1:22:12] backfires and that tension but you're
[1:22:14] waitin and fate
[1:22:17] what if God told Abraham this I use a
[1:22:20] cup in 25 years unknown it's a hollow oh
[1:22:23] yeah there mumbles for 54 years and come
[1:22:26] back shaky head and see Cody drinkin
[1:22:28] instead of smoke can he put some mints

[1:22:33] church you know this year's the yeah
[1:22:35] this is the year of Jubilee this is 25
[1:22:37] years I'm seeing God couldn't do Burma

[1:22:44] how long 25 years Chuck my promise and
[1:22:48] recite verses i'ma wait until promise of
[1:22:50] the Father how long 14 days is it until
[1:22:54] he didn't tell him when it coming in
[1:22:56] over George but a Bible said when the
[1:22:58] day of Pentecost was fully come so
[1:23:00] there's a day for you it's coming it's
[1:23:05] God in demand
[1:23:06] it's the see Jim like the beginning the
[1:23:08] spoken word is quads with made manifest
[1:23:10] then it isn't a man it's a man that died
[1:23:13] he can't be a hybrid and a son at the
[1:23:16] same time he's either a son of debt or
[1:23:18] son of life so if he's a son of that get
[1:23:21] it over to the devil let him kill it
[1:23:22] give it over to God
[1:23:23] I meant that let him kill the devil
[1:23:25] that's a new running out Hallows yo let
[1:23:28] God planned his own life in you then
[1:23:30] it's not you no more it is God
[1:23:32] oh my so the Holy Spirit come in the
[1:23:35] form of a dove he come not to my
[1:23:37] breeding but to a virgin born and then
[1:23:40] no true this I'm given this life that if
[1:23:43] you by fate will accept will accept the
[1:23:47] father all the prophets all the word I
[1:23:48] will pour my life down upon you and you
[1:23:51] can't do nothing else but producers in
[1:23:52] life the same thing that I do
[1:23:54] what was he made me he made himself a
[1:23:58] man God has with flesh and well amongst
[1:23:59] the world's made flesh dwelt among us
[1:24:01] God spoken would chew a version brought
[1:24:04] forth her body and in that body come
[1:24:06] water and spirit the washed by the water
[1:24:08] of the world and then he went in him and
[1:24:11] dwelt in him and there comes the life of
[1:24:12] God manifest himself to Christ he was
[1:24:14] the Anointed One and then we see he was
[1:24:17] God's women manifest now he died there
[1:24:19] we go in order to pay the debt of your
[1:24:21] high Breeden that's why he died
[1:24:25] because we're hybrid so you have a PD
[1:24:27] debt to correct that all right so what's
[1:24:29] something now my what is it that you
[1:24:32] could die to yourself until you are
[1:24:33] normal yourself but we filled with this
[1:24:35] word believe in his word and then the
[1:24:37] Holy Spirit was in him comes down to
[1:24:39] water that word to make it grow and when
[1:24:42] what and then what is it
[1:24:43] God manifesting continuing the work of
[1:24:47] his full Sun his only-begotten that died
[1:24:50] for a hybrid in life that he might
[1:24:52] reconcile us back to be sons and
[1:24:53] daughters of God and true the church my
[1:24:55] flow there we go
[1:24:56] the same life by the word continuing the
[1:25:00] work being manifested as it was in
[1:25:04] Christ Christ was God would made
[1:25:06] manifest and he died and give his life
[1:25:09] that he might send the spirit and take
[1:25:11] his body up and send the spirit back to
[1:25:13] water and Peter a demon price if we
[1:25:16] believe it on this right then come the
[1:25:18] Holy Spirit upon the same word or glory
[1:25:21] to God then the Bible has got to be in
[1:25:23] you prophecy the Bible has got to be in
