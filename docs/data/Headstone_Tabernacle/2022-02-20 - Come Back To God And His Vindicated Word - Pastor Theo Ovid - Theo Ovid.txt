us this opportunity to access your presence the most important thing lord is to be able to access your presence go beyond the intellectual go beyond the humanistic realm and enter into the realm of revelation father god come on in your word this morning reveal yourself by your word and confirm your word with signs wonders and miracles we ask in jesus name god bless you thanks again for coming we want to open the bible says in john chapter 5 reading from 33 to 47. second peter 1 reading from 17 to 21 blessed be the name of the lord welcome oh blessed be the name of the lord jesus speaking in saint john chapter 5 33 this is in red he sent unto john and he bear witness unto the truth but i receive not the testimony from man but these things i say that you might be saved he was a burning and shining light ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light but i have a greater witness than that of john for the works which the father had given me to finish the same works that i do be a witness of me remember john had no signs and wonders john had just a repentance message but jesus is saying for the works which the father had given me to finish the same works that i do be a witness of me that the father had sent me and the father himself which had sent me had borne witness of me you have neither heard his voice at any time no senior shape and you have not his word abiding in you for whom he had sent him you believe not so jesus is telling them if you have the word in you you will know who god said search the scriptures verse 39 for in them you think you have eternal life but there they will testify of me and he will not come to me that he might have life i receive not honor from men but i know you that you have not the love of god in you i am come in my father's name and you receive me not if another shall come in his own name him you will receive how can he believe which receive honor one of another and seek not the honor that only comes from god only do you not think that i will accuse you to the father there is no there is one that accuses you even moses in whom you trust if you believe moses you would have believed me for he wrote of me in other words if you believe the prophecy of moses he was going to believe me become a fulfillment of the prophetic utterance that was released from moses mouth but but verse 47 but if you believe not his writings how shall you believe my words oh glory to god and let's go to second peter 1 reading from verse 17 for he received from god the father honor and glory when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased and this voice which came from heaven we heard when we were with him in the holy mount these brothers giving testimony we have also a more sure word of prophecy where until you do well that you take heed as unto a light that shines in a dark place until the dead on and the d star arise in your hearts knowing this first no prophecy of scripture is of any private interpretation for the prophecy came not in all time by the will of man but holy men of god speak as they were moved by the holy ghost let us pray father we read your word and we come this morning and ask that you interpreted your hearts lord take me out of the way i'm being calvary's cross and may you be glorified amidst your people in jesus name i ask it amen and amen you may be seated praise god for a few moments the time that we have here i have a title come back to god and his vindicated word not just come back to god come back to god and his vindicated word another inspiration we have a sure word of prophecy praise god amen so we don't believe cuddling divine fables we have a short word of prophecy but that's the way the gospel is today it can only be seen in the way that god presents it to you and if it's presented to you outside of the continuity of the bible then it's not god telling you that you can't make the bible lie it's the infallible word of god it has to agree with the continue of his the rest of his word it just can't say one place and there's something else and do this over hit and scatter he hits the target every time the word does so you have to make it in the continuity of the rest of the world therefore his way has always been in the word to send a prophet before that time before he makes his word vindicated so before god vindicate his word he sends a prophet hallelujah the prophet brings what the prophecy hallelujah and then god come and fulfill the prophecy then the word is indicated so the prophet have to catch the word from god because the word comes from a prophet no prophet no word no word no vindication oh glory to god hallelujah praise god do you believe that are you ready are you ready and the seer was the one who had the interpretation of the written word what does he mean by that the seer the seer is one who could see ahead and come back and foretell so when you see a man speak a prophecy and it come to pass he's a seer he could see ahead of time he could see what's coming and then you know that qualifies the man to interpret the word all glory to god so when he said behold i sent you elijah the prophet it means he said in a seer and when that seer began to speak you know any interpretation of the word come on that seer is from god and that word is vindicated with that's not a theologian studying bible and explaining things that's why he says say what the tapes say because the seer alone has the interpretation of the written word or give the lord a shout so no man can come behind the prophet and try to interpret what the word say you have to say what the tapes say because it's already interpreted by the seer and the sea alone could only interpret the word or give the lord a shout in the house that is why revelation 10 8-11 when the voice told john take the book and eat it he could only prophesy from what he eat from the book and the open book from the mighty angel what's dropping in the hands of that prophet that seven angel messenger so here christ come with the book open every mystery revealed he comes with a book open right and there's a seventh angel waiting to catch it so right in revelation 10 10 1 mighty angel there's no angel from the earth that's the lord from heaven the lord himself descending with a shout he's coming for a bride he come with the book open that book of names your name my name our names that's what the book have in it that's what this message about if they say baptist it is a catholic it is a pentecostal it had your name in it what give the lord i shout glory to god and your name is the word and the word comes to the prophet so when the mighty angel came out with the open book he handed to revelation 10 7. okay the lord i shout let's make him be excited this morning he handed to revelation 10 7. the angel is on the earth glory glory in other words angel from heaven hunt into an angel on earth angel on earth is called the seventh angel or the seven angel messenger and after the angel cut the book the book the angel and look at the book the voice tell john go to the angel that's time i don't want to land on the foot and see and ask for the book and say give me the book don't let the book say any angel him you have to take the book and eat the book and prophesy again and the testimony of jesus is the spirit of prophecy that's what we have this morning that's what we claim this morning that's what we believe this morning that we have the testimony of jesus which is the spirit of prophecy oh give the lord a shout in the house oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah let me be seated enough toast in the toast in the bibles and books and messages from theologians and bright men there may be no prophets in them in the head they made great matter they meant education and intellect and where they intellect they try to stretch and interpret what they think it means i remember doing literature in school and sometimes one in line shakes percy and the amount of bag asked me right something hold them know you know you talk to shakespeare shakespeare shakespeare even know that all i'm thinking inside yeah that to be or not to be in a whole they wanted my two essays on the statement to be or not to be what is to be will be a whole long and i was astonished when you're looking back at past papers of a little one in line and somebody write four or five pages of an essay on one line say and i i also wonder i wonder if shakespeare was thinking about all that thing you're talking about i don't think so now you see me real man hallelujah people love man religion become man invented man make it when you come to this bible and this god no money make that that's why he said have no other gods before me who talking god almighty himself you have no paper god no woman god no man god no car god no money god no french god no stove god no land god no god before me [Applause] all right let's go asia was the one who had the interpretation of the written word saying all these liars that have these false prophets lying how down trump come back in power what kind of lie are they like and listen they have talking to other followers you know just going over the next lie i said the lord told me and i fly up to heaven and i come and see this and i see that they see nothing some demon take them into some channel they come back talking with some devil tell them they are not of god jesus said many false prophets arise and people listen to these men now they may say 80 things from the scriptures but we don't want eighty percent this is not eighty percent bride this is a hundred percent they may prophesy and sometime i hit it might miss like guessing pow pow we not want no guessing and hitting and listen every prophet in the bible was dossier the lord god said lord honor man's interpretation just say lord is the word for the hour oh glory to god that's why you have to know what is being spoken that is not man's intellect and gray matter pumping word oh give the lord a shout in the house so the seer is the only one who has the interpretation of the written word not the seer and the fivefold me see it good not the seer and the fight for ministry no this year alone that's why the fightful ministry have to say what the tapes say because they're not authorized to interpret it they ought to write to reflect it or echo it or speak it back or follow on to on or of it all right let's continue he forced all things to come when he spoke the things that was to come and proved that he was a seer then he knowed they know he had the right interpretation of the scripture because god through him manifested the written scripture for that day don't be stressful wake up that was the plain identification a seer a foreteller a teleport and the only way that they knowed he was getting the right interpretation of the scripture because what he said come to pass then they knowed he was called of god god said that and then they noticed that it did it come right back in continuity with the word for that day now we realize all the mysteries of god is made known to prophets and them alone all all means what all means all there is no mystery that a man has to come outside of the prophet to reveal it he could show what has already been revealed [Applause] but he cannot bring a new mystery another mystery a mystery that was never unfolded by the man that god have sent oh glory to god and jesus told them he said if i come in my father's name oh glory to god jesus said i ain't coming my own name i come in my father's name and you don't want to receive it but another would come in his own name well the lord show me the lord i show you nothing silly and shut up oh give the lord a shout the word come to a prophet the prophet put it on books and tapes and we draw from it we eat from it we feast on it what are you feasting on youtube and all kind of foolishness what are you feasting on facebook and all kind of nice coats and nice scenes and what that died of vindicated wood get back to god come back to the vindicated word of god god has a vindicated word in this day oh glory to god are you with me all right let's continue we realize that all the mysteries of god is made known to prophets and them alone amos 3 7 hallelujah o praise the name of the lord so when the disciples was rocking the boat and jesus was the the voters rocking rather and they wake up jesus said master he said here am i careless not the dope you perish just in deep sleep you said no going on up there you say oh where is your faith or your little faith forgetting he is with us calling jesus on the scene to act people today said if if i could only know for sure that it was him if i could just be sure how could they be sure how was the disciples show of it now listen not because he was an educated man as far as we know he wasn't he only had the wisdom of god but we don't have no record of him ever going to school but some great priest or some great renowned person no we have no record of that how could they rest assured we are sure that there were the christ how could they because here we go they seen the promised word vindicated in other words made manifest make known so when you talk about sons of god bringing up the mysteries making them known you could make known by words and you could make known by manifestation in other words um um you could say well i i i will give you a cake a cake is what i'm going to make that's words when the cake is baked and presented and you cut a slice dining words you know you're tasting the cake as long as you're talking okay talk like a talk and it has to wait till you beat the egg and put the sugar and put whatever ingredients to make up the cake when the cake is baked then you have a cake you know not when it's mixing you know you have the mixer spilling it up no it'll be no nice cake mixture hallelujah you can make cupcakes with her but you want a whole cake oh glory to god will god have a whole word for the bride to be manifested or give the lord a shout and you have to be under expectation for manifestation if i train you to listen to talk you'll come he will talk on sunday and talk on wednesday and more talk and more talk and more talk but when you understand we have to walk the talk and we have to make a change that would make a revival when you understand you have something to do and you have the place to act then it's a different thing altogether it's not about me oh god it's about the prophecy oh give the lord i shout because the prophecy didn't come by gray matter the prophets didn't come by man's intellect the prophecy came by man as they were moved by the holy ghost oh glory to god in the same holy ghost that movement to fulfill the prophecy will the same holy ghost have to mount you to move you into action oh glory to god because the scene the promise was vindicated in other words mean manifest made known the living word i promise was made alive here we go projected right through that body and they knew that was god in him not letter to his actual body that's why the first sign of virtue when the woman pressed her way through all these men and touched jesus and he who touched my clothes so i felt virtue left me he had it that's why he could release it that woman didn't just judge flesh and blood she actually touched an access of power that ministered to her needs okay the lord i shall do you understand what i'm saying without a healing touch she was a dead woman in a short time but she needed something more than the men and women that were standing around jesus it made her desperate oh god have mercy did you get what i'm saying it made her desperate because she had a deep need [Applause] [Music] there are some people as long as you get injured with your bad attitude disrespects whatever you have and you feel it getting through life you don't need to change you know you bully your way you bounce your way through and everything else there's nobody needs a change in them no how about god they're still in the heat up that was god has changed the thing when that man came to jesus and bought my daughter and said come on come on pray for sheena yeah last he get courage he could call you because he said fast he's unstoppable she's all them people had to deal with somebody come and tell me forget their daughter dead how would you feel to be in that position when you now get the courage to break past the church membership and church leadership and in the spiritual environment around you to ask for help the acts of prayer the actual deliverance and when you're about to do it i think there was your daughter dead jesus said i go waker [Applause] i'm not in the realm there man i'm not in the zone that there i am i understand the humanistic rendering i already see a vision she generates already i'm going to wake her up as far as i'm concerned the devil just deceived just interfere with the woman's rest i'm going to i'm going to wicker out of that fleet oh glory to god oh my jesus will he said get them unbelievers out get their make believers out i only want believers around me people are going to believe like me to create an atmosphere for this thing to happen oh glory to god run them out and by your time just finishing it you're eating things walking talking normal normal normal that's what we're getting into a super church our super race as we near the headstone oh give the lord i shout hallelujah oh glory to god could we take some more i see what happened you know people getting stimulated dead grey mata getting stimulated with other words from other men who commented in their own name and they forsaken this god vindicated word that was sent by the prophet malachi 4. people are getting stimulated by tick-tock who want to hear this tick-tock because it's simulated by all kind of foolishness and what's happening on youtube and facebook and this indicator would that used to be wrestling with this will be troubling you when you lie down you should be thinking about it when you wake up you should have a quote in front of you or chloe in a car when you're weak when you're going in a car you read a scripture you read something to stimulate your faith because you want this thing make manifest praise god this is another way joel osteen and td jakes and the whole bunch of tv preachers have nothing to do with them because they're not connected to this they do nothing about this this is only for the elect this mighty angel oh glory that god the one with the sweatback wings the one with the seventh seal come to call a bride before the sex seal of judgment is about to be poured out russia looking to start a war oh give the lord a shout things are turning up you can't sit there like nothing is happening a lot of things are happening ready or not it's coming it's coming it's coming oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory have a bomb for you [Applause] sit down i want to drop it in you know let me say this with humility let me say this with a broken voice but a broken heart too it's evening time the bible said it will be like in the evening time there will be day and there will be neither night nor day and here's how we interpret this the prophet said it will be just here in the word with no manifestation just a gloomy foggy day but in the evening time the light will shine again the prophet came for 50-plus years the only year in the world here in the world hearing the word but the even light or is the same light as the morning light and when that tree put forth another original branch that light will come and ripen the fruit at the top oh give the lord a shout so it's more than here in the world that's foggy day that's dismal day but in the evening time it shall be light oh hallelujah please god let me just stay back again shall be like an even time there will be a day that it won't neither be night nor day the prophet says it will be a day just hearing the word with no manifestation just a gloomy foggy day but the evening time the light will shine again it will be light and in this evening light where we are now living where christ through his ministers has preached the gospel for 2000 years but this is the even lights the evil light was the manifestation of the resurrection oh give the lord i shout it was dark christ died the disciples gone in hiding but that evening time he came among them and broke bread and they knew was the lord he came among them and said peace be unto you it was the evening time oh glory to god was dismal but praise god praise god praise god [Applause] glory glory to god [Applause] jesus met up this blind boy and somebody i said who's sinning mother father who's sin there's a nun he's only in that condition that the works of god can be made manifest so they can't go down that road who's saying who sin people are going to be delivered two people say amen i said people are going to be delivered yes who won't deliver us getting deliverance people are gonna be set free god will add people to this church the rascals inside of here god will bypass them if they don't pull it together you think god waiting on anybody god killed two million people and let their children be born in the wilderness to take the children over to confirm his with abraham thy seed you don't know what generation god talking about [Applause] this is scary you know this is frightening you know god tell abraham your seed you know he didn't say which generation so when the carcass fell in the wilderness god knew every pregnancy evil in hallelujah every pregnancy he said i'll go to confirm a word every pregnancy was an ordained believer coming forth to tread on amorites

predestinated what are you talking about the predestination when they seen the scriptural signs they knowed that word that the works vindicated the word aha we get on something here the predestinations know that the works vindicated the word that the word was right because the people watch they were predestinated to see it and they were right in line to see it and they got it they seen it they couldn't get it nowhere they didn't see it because the people was predestined to eternal life they was going to find it all the father had given me will come all that come to me i'll give

you up get a bomb as you are my sin all my sin not in part but in whole was nailed to the cross and now i can say it is well it is well with my soul oh glory to god hallelujah you take your sin and nail it to the cross [Applause] that is enough to make a baptist shout much as somebody in this message when the lamb took the book and lose his heels oh glory to god he take all your sins not some all and nail it to the cross oh glory to god and and release to you the liberty to set you free and who the son of man set free oh god i feel real pentecostal now who the solomon set free free indeed

more than lovers of god false accusers incontinent despises of those are the good having a form of godliness but were denied a vindicated word and the power there so they're not satisfied with all these prophetic utterance from this end-time message they're not satisfied with that they need some time magazine they need something from the newspaper they need something from america they need something from new york times and whatever times and whatever it is they need some idea from some psychology this is not good enough and here it is we have a short word of prophecy that there's going

that man about a purple honestly kind of glory and every time you go it fresh every time you go it fresh it's the same message it's the same spoken word book but look at it this morning it's fresh it's vindicated word or come back to god come back to this word if i'll pour in it it have life in it [Music] [Applause] [Music] the baptism of the holy ghost deny all of that hallelujah paul told those people that wasn't baptized in jesus name in order to receive the holy ghost the account baptized in jesus name in galatians 1 8 4 angel come from heaven mercy's one from trinidad evangelical come from heaven come america oh glory to god i forgive me you know this one with wings and things you know [Music] that's what we're afraid man if i ever teach any other thing that you have been taught let them be a curse notice it don't have no flaws if there's anything doubt in your mind you're better straightened up no don't wait till then it's too late he blinded israel that he might manifest his word he's doing the same thing to the gentiles notice eve rejected and forfeited her rights after she's seen the word vindicated by god what he done watch from justice to revelation the same thing what israel done what pilot done and the whole thing done always on eve till now the same thing get this bomb they reject the vindicated word and take a dogma instead and that forms debt spiritual debt they're preaching message they're spreading god's and a prophet but what they're really doing they're using the message as props under the shoulder to prop their own anointing and inspiration to prop their own revelation and they're falling back and say look what's in a prophet but here where i get last night what did lord show me and what the lord show you not in the scriptures what the lord show you not in the message it is not vindicated word get back to god god is the word the vindicated word of the hour oh give the lord a shout this word is vindicated rapture vindicated resurrection vindicated oh god revival already vindicated we are preaching a syndicated gospel [Applause] [Music] they reject the vinegar words take dogma and you see you have to take once once the word is removed you got to substitute and the substitute makes it what it is spiritual debt so some member pulpit they are dead angels let me stun you sit down they looking stunned they are standing by the people this morning and they are angels of death killing the people but the spirit have to come a voice have to go out he said once more the world will hear direct from god there'll be one more ride oh glory to god with signs wonders and miracles not with books tips and quotes there'll be one more ride or give the lord a shout it won't be playing tips [Applause] there's a new false doctrine hallelujah it wouldn't be playing tips in church no it could be the manifestation of the prophet's word vindicating it's the voice of god in the last days [Applause] [Music] [Applause] oh glory to god the bride will be given the voice let me say this way this morning the bride has a voice the voice is the vindicated word voice of god the last days [Music] you can take some more bumps you ready what did he ever say that i would as a lamp onto my feet and i light under my part if the lamp have no light they're problems but your wood is a lamp and in the lamp at the light here what the prophecy here now the word is what leads you to light [Applause] no matter how much observatories how many things the wise men why are you out of your mind two years was in traveling the past many nations say where you going we have seen a star in the east and we come to worship him and when they line up in jerusalem no national headquarters they didn't have the answer they went up and down the streets where is he born king of the jews they know nothing about it so they call on the word of the lord that followed that star was leading them to the eternal light guide us to thy perfect light i hear the bomb and the word is what guides you to light and the light is what makes the world vindicated so it's a little bit more than word word word word right you see it though i wanted to be trained to listen because somebody will come in their own name talking woodward woodward wood because you need them to bring more wood we say we don't need you we need okay so for abraham let's look at this now quickly abraham 25 years saying isaac prophecy god says so eyes are coming all so you know that you know people the doctors saying ibram cuckoo um abraham that didn't make no sense 25 years when god came down to vindicate or confirm the word he come and say i will return unto you and i not coming to tell you're coming do you see what i'm saying after 25 years an assurance come to confirm the prophecy is still on in other words this thing is still alive don't think this prophecy dead don't think because it's staying long it's dead i come to tell you this morning when an enemy coming like a flood the spirit raises a standard and take the same prophecy and make it more positive take the same word and make it more positive in other words the prophecy is alive today next 28 days time of life so here abraham angel gone i'm here saying oh god angel god what are you doing [Music] angel not on that abram angel gone prophecy is active his fate is no one anointed because he just got a word from the angel i will return him to dee and god's an angel in this last day a seventh angel messenger and we have a word a show with a prophecy from that angel of our time of life oh give the lord a shout that's why i'm still excited all glory to god when this message hit me when i was 17 years old i was excited god held all hell hallelujah might go like i was speaking tongues i couldn't help the excitement i could only be 64 years old and i'm just as excited as when i started out so don't tell me you're half dead half cold foolishness come on dallas you loud is here get back to god come back to the vindicated world the word is what guides the light and the light is what makes the wood vindicated oh blessed be in the name of the lord in the beginning god said that there'd be light and when the manifested word of god when the word of god was manifested there was light first god spoke it let there be light there's a word it might take a million years but when it's manifested then there's light praise god so man can say whatever you want we don't realize god when it's vindicated when it's manifested when it's confirmed well god said behold i sent you elijah the prophet and that was malachi 4 and william branham stepped right into that scripture that scripture is already fulfilled but there's another part to it and he shall turn the hearts of the children back to the faith [Music] [Applause] so all this word let me say this way all these mysteries histories revelations inspiration have to take us back to the fate where we manifest christ because the works vindicate the word the works will vindicate who you are oh glory to god am i going to be a lawyer here have a clue with lord what law you're talking about hallelujah praise god you had to be able to go any court and speak on the fundings oh my god a man have everything wrong his neck here with two little things you ain't doctor's way i'll make him a doctor he just finds us in the road and he's put a status quo walking like that i'm putting a white coat and he said doctor swanson demand you know front teeth from back teeth and because he went a stethoscope you you see him as a doctor there's only external say where's the qualification that man playing police that paul is uniformly coming and coming can you come to check something identification please all right i'll call him back i know police imposter impersonator after the prophet left i said are people playing prophet imposters and impersonators coming after the vindicated would go forth they can't come before they had to wait till the prophet speak they come and prop themselves up prop themselves up with the message of the hour and preach their own revelation bring the black bag with their own interpretation but tell one of my people oh glory to god the secret is the word is and the pride she are moving from that word she is locked into that word nobody could shake her off that word oh glory to god hallelujah praise god your prophecies will fail your tongue's going to cease that knowledge is going to vanish away but this prayer this vindicated we're going to stay oh glory to god my god we cannot be challenged oh glory to god feel good this morning oh my sister and kyle i say even if i'm not quoting according people don't even know i'm still quoting i tell myself i want to preach the word in such a way that nobody could challenge me and so far i've never seen anybody come and challenge me nobody could come and say brazil you say that what do you mean by what you say it's intermediate problems you have to know what i'm saying i ain't even want to talk thing or nothing i want to tell you where the thing is somebody's talking about thinking that thing right in between the lines i'm between the line they put on kind of false seeds between the lines lying to the people i come here to speak truth because i know the truth will set you free i love freedom there is one thing i love is freedom i want freedom for me and i want freedom for you i don't want freedom for me i'm buying you praise god and the reason a lot of things get by in this church because i make a pledge to god i wouldn't rule these people with rigor with legalism and law and i try to avoid that you know what they will leave here and go by some legalistic preacher and behave their self but they want to misbehave inside of here they will shut them out elsewhere but they want to open them up inside of here but feel free you free and i free to bless you rebuke your amen oh glory to god is not what freedom one way is freedom two ways i said this is not your father's house this is my father's house you can't come with your old ways and bring it inside of here we're going to smoke you out oh give the lord a shout in the house the passage of the house this morning hallelujah oh glory to god amen so in the beginning god said let there be light and when the manifested word of god when the word of god was manifested there was light god spoke it and what what if it didn't manifest then it wasn't like yet but when he spoke it then it was manifested vindicated his word was vindicated light come into existence so when you talk about the manifestation songs of god he's not about people preaching message if that is it we manifested long time last 50 years we manifested when he said he manifested the sons of god he doesn't want to communicate explaining something since i hope these words is helpful to you there are no manifestation i talk i talk talk talkification i don't know anything like talkification why don't manifesting sons of god he said he said um i'm a person of crops burning i send you rain so we had a dry season right now every time fire burning a fire burning here somebody have a whole field like they brought a line down here and manifesting sons of god you need rain i send you rain and neighbor jesus christ and that word go straight to his land create rain and fall right there that's something impossible impossible when moses said let there be frogs it's frogs coming in flies flight is coming you know out of his mug it was coming out you know oh glory to god and wait till them seven thunders order their voices to that group they could slice and cut they could open their mouth whatever they say they could shut the heavens out of the mouth of god hallelujah hallelujah and that's the only way it can be done now is when the word is vindicated god's written word is vindicated then it shows light oh my my my god word vindicated proved that the baptism of the holy ghost is just the same as it ever was on the day of pentecost you have no updated version you know windows is update and all them operating systems update your phone and say they have a update go down updated thing what do you say it is that's it you don't have to improve his sis or operating system oh cliff the lord i shout god i have no updates out there coming a new version version 10.2 then version 10.3 got you have that you know oh no gonna have four sage second age third age half portage fifth age six eight seven eight here come the bride of jesus christ satan look out they come and they come in they're coming oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah praise god let's continue on the omstress now the gospel came nothing more only but true power and manifestation of the word power and manifestation the word vindicated is the gospel [Applause] so the word preach is a seed of the gospel but when the word is vindicated that is the gospel so when he said go into all the world and preach the gospel he is talking about manifest his person manifestation [Applause] foreign he's coming for it a word vindicated bride hallelujah brother brown notice moses david reflected the coming of the perfect bridegroom so was luther wesley and pentecost reflected the coming of the perfect bride now notice these fellows appeared to talk about these fortunately these guys let's call them for now these guys goddang anointed yeah they just yes right now they're false only many rainfall they could be anointed i thought it dries a biscuit because the money coming for on everybody you know oh if you thought it's going coming on you no it'll come at the bright face you saw trying to change the money and they say by a certain time you had to bring in all the old dollars so if they're coming all the way to spend by respecting that that has zero value you can have a million of those dollars it has zero value you were supposed to send it in by time so you have to get the original first which is you the money the currency first so god after anointing bride first should be called aside and anointed hallelujah to show them this is my bride and then the others get anointed afterwards they say are we doing what you're doing too but the seed is all going to make the difference now let me tell you let me comfort you now the rain coming don't worry about that you know worry about the seed they want your planting you know if you don't plant i don't know whether it's come from tea mario and weed something i know where there's come from the land could be dry or clean in land and whatnot yeah planting them things you know just rain fall and they're coming i have no plan anything it will take over your land they have a gift to be there i don't know what the birds bring i don't know but the deer so therefore as a farmer you have to plant your seed you're not controlling the sonoran you can say really i demand you in jesus name they come out tomorrow and sunlight sunshine better don't stay away tonight you know can need a dryness or need this no you can't talk to you something like that it's not going to come out and shine on you just like that ignore you you're not controlling that so all your action as a fisherman to fish as a farmer to plant is in fate when a fisherman put on his line you know he catching you know crab snake while being away king fish shack you don't know where catching there you know by fate you're putting it and you're pulling your feet back when you're taking somebody that big old tire coming up you're going to fish retire you're going to fish a fish you see what i'm talking about now so i am saying your attitude and action has to be one of fate god i trust you this morning i stretch it for my loved ones i stop worrying searching for my family i stopped worrying structure for the future your future is in god okay mission please hallelujah but abraham said he said watch don't you miss this imposters impersonators appeared after the true one went forward first they come to impersonate see they have to he said in the god told him do the work of evangelists in that corner yonder make full proof of your ministry for the time will come and i feel the time is here when they will not end your song doctrine they're bored by the punch they're tired here these promises my god they will have them your song doctrine but after their own lust you see it's what inside of you what you're calling for hallelujah after their own lusts shall heap for themselves teachers have an itching ears oh my so watch when we find out each age when god said a certain thing would happen here come a man along willem branham and manifested that here come that people along and live that talking about us live the prophecy oh wondering stars how long will you wonder you met this baptist presbyterian outsiders whatever you might be wandering stars from church to church from pillar to pillar of television to television world to world why don't you come on he longs to our fellowship with you he's longing for you he wants to transform you by the renewing of your mind not to the church or to denomination but to his word which you are part of that desires in you and he sent his transforming power to bring you out of this deformity of religion that you're in in this deformity chaos we're in god has sent his transforming power his word vindicated proven to bring you out of this religious deformity of ignorance that you're walking in naked blind miserable don't even know it oh blessed be the name of the lord but a random reading saying you know they will come in their name and you will receive them quoting jesus you won't receive me the word vindicated and proven before you as he was right then so he's today don't you miss that people across this nation another will come at church and you believe that because you just do any way i won't vindicate it he's never any time vindicated anything in our church outside of the message i was given looter justification wesley sonification pentecostal restoration of the gift and after that as soon as they make the nomination they died he said i oh praise god i'm almost done here he said but they love their traditions more than they love the vindicated word of god and that's what i discover and you know some time ago i also have problems with brother brown talk about three kind of believers i just couldn't catch the unbeliever i could see they make believers the sneaky one looking for it to make a mistake looking for something happens they never really believed just waiting for something to neg the people like that waiting to grace aha you see you see you see you see you see right you see i had a true believer but the unbeliever smart guy he believed to him about the unwon they're choosing what they believe and their ministers who preaching this message were unbelievable they don't believe the prophet they believe themselves they believe what commented them they believed their vision of the revelation i remember time we wanted to get we wanted to get a picture painted of the cloud so he went to this artist to kill him picture come and when when we go back the picture it was completely completely different she said but they know what we want we want to pick a picture of the club to hang up she said well i pinned my interpretation of it i think we paid peterman get away you know now you give a picture to paint but she actually painted an interpretation her interpretation what have we seen for a while now everybody could hear the same thing but they're not processing the same way all heard the word but it was mixed that wasn't mixed with fate with everybody and god wasn't pleased with everybody so even though we're preaching this and we're hearing everybody the same thing what go into your mind your thoughts i don't know what going through it that is where we divine revelation because when the spirit comes it won't reveal one way his way god's way oh my hallelujah what about him says now lord triest by your spirit if there be any evil among us lord any unbelief of the word any person here father that will not puncture every promise of god with an amen may the holy spirit come down now the white horse rider while his spirit the spirit of christ and the feast of antichrist call his own call him out may they now repent come quickly to you father and be filled with the oil and wine and be changed from the denominational robe of cain's debt unto the snow white robe of eternal life given all by the bridegroom and then they will go out here we go they will go out to the wedding supper someday in the vindicated word of the resurrection oh my hallelujah do you love him this morning notice the vindicated word in his body is the very victory and the reason for his death oh my hallelujah children of disobedience rebelled against abel's revealed revelation vindicated of god that he was righteous there's a few more we're going to close and today the world today is dedicating themselves to the knowledge which came by satan dedicating themselves to what knowledge and man's day is glorified not the word of god but by the knowledge he has that's what man is evident by he no plenty he he he he he know measures a long time man's days glorified by the man his works man's works are exalted above god's word and manifested works the wisdom of satan which he gives the eve at the beginning now listen don't miss this the wisdom of satan is exalted to the throne of worship in man above the vindicated word of god for the hour our churches proves that by schools of learning that they learn more than god's word knows about it they have exalted listen their own knowledge so-called from satan above the vindicated promise of god made clear before them people believe in that denomination more than they believe god and god is the word god is the word and he exalts himself above all that's called god and there's only one god and god is the word he said watch christ's bride fell for it before and took the intellectual knowledge of some seminary preacher instead of believing pure vindicated word the anointed ones jesus said they are teaching for doctrine the interpretation of the scripture of man see not the word of god not his vindicated word i'm going to close with this and this is where i get the title from but abandoned today instead we're going to play something instead of the church doing that we sell out a membership start off bringing them in anything get more than the methodist has got or the baptist has got get more than the oneness has oneness has more than the trinity or the one two-nil so what i don't know it's a bunch of worldlies it's a bunch of nonsense come back to god and his vindicated word that's where i get it from come back to god and then again don't be caught up in facebook youtube what kind of preachers people saying things and the same thing you never hear before and they stimulate you another jewish man they'll be talking jewish thing and they caught them in that with some kind of sticks and water you have kind of jewish jewelry and ritual and whatnot but does not do with what we are talking about here that has nothing to do with promising the bride he said when you see the message the rest is full of material come on man god give you a gift give him a box it wrap about all kind of tinsel and whatnot you're untied a gift you untie the paper you rip off the paper you take off the box all the little stringy thing you take all that and you get to the gift the gift is the main thing let the main thing be the main thing what is the main thing in your life let it be the vindicated word for the hour may the lord bless you
