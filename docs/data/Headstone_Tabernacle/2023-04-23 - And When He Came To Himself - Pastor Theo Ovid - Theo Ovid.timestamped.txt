[57:37] your blood to give us an entrance so we
[57:40] could enter in and be pardoned and be
[57:42] cleansed from our sins and our unbelief
[57:44] but God made you a special work today
[57:47] among your people among your sons and

[57:52] people father that you'd visit them with
[57:54] your presence and visit them with
[57:56] Deliverance visit them with your Greece

[58:09] challenges that lead before them but I

[58:13] special ring and deep with our hearts
[58:15] and our lives we ask in Jesus name

[58:44] portion we're going to get to the whole
[58:45] thing of The Prodigal Son but this is
[58:48] just what he was saying
[58:50] I don't want to take something from
[58:51] there for 17. and when he came to
[58:54] himself he said how many hired Servants
[58:57] of my father have bread enough and
[59:00] despair
[59:01] and I perish with hunger
[59:03] I will arise and go to my father and
[59:05] we'll see unto him father I have sinned

[59:38] and we want to prove himself to you amen
[59:40] so we look forward to see what the Lord
[59:42] will do for us we had a great time in
[59:44] the power of prayer yesterday we are
[59:47] really grateful for the turnout
[59:49] and for you being here to cry out unto
[59:51] God
[59:52] and I trust then that you if you'd have
[59:54] heard it I want to go and listen back to
[59:55] the message on Wednesday night thus said
[59:57] the Lord of hosts consider your ways
[1:00:00] it's a very key message is a very
[1:00:02] important message consider this so let's
[1:00:04] begin this morning I have a title and
[1:00:07] when he came to himself
[1:00:10] that's the title when he came
[1:00:12] to himself
[1:00:14] and I have an inspiration return
[1:00:17] time to come back home
[1:00:19] that's the inspiration return
[1:00:21] time to come back home
[1:00:23] now when Leviticus the 25th chapter
[1:00:27] 1910 verse
[1:00:29] and this is God speaks then shall thou
[1:00:31] call The Trumpet of the Jubilee to sound
[1:00:32] on the 10th day of the seventh month in
[1:00:36] the day of atonement shall he make the
[1:00:37] trumpeter song throughout all your land
[1:00:40] you shall Hollow the 50th year and
[1:00:43] Proclaim Liberty throughout all the land
[1:00:45] the inhabitants thereof it shall be a
[1:00:48] jubilee unto you and you shall return
[1:00:51] every man to his possession
[1:00:53] and shall return every man to his family
[1:00:57] so God
[1:00:58] by presenting the word you know
[1:01:01] sometimes
[1:01:02] your Fallen debt in those days and you
[1:01:05] fall into slavery but God had a
[1:01:08] provision of Grace shout out Grace this
[1:01:10] morning
[1:01:11] that Grace make a provision for a
[1:01:14] jubilee Trumpeter song
[1:01:16] you didn't have to do anything you know
[1:01:18] you're there you go in you're laboring
[1:01:20] you're under pressure you're under
[1:01:22] stress but when that trumpet song and
[1:01:25] you receive that trumpet sound you have
[1:01:28] the Liberty to return to go back to your
[1:01:31] family to go back to your possession
[1:01:34] if they take it for 50 years you have to
[1:01:36] go back to it 40 years 20 years you went
[1:01:39] back
[1:01:39] this is the law of God nobody can change
[1:01:43] that God ordained that in other words
[1:01:45] you can't pay back what you owe but God
[1:01:47] provided this Jubilee here as a means of
[1:01:50] Grace for his people to get back
[1:01:53] where they belong and what they had when
[1:01:57] they were lost oh give the Lord some
[1:01:59] praises
[1:02:00] hallelujah praise God praise God praise
[1:02:03] God be believe that
[1:02:05] so if an individual lost the inheritance
[1:02:07] that was given to them by God there came
[1:02:10] a Year of Jubilee and every seven years
[1:02:13] that arrest a Sabbath every seven years
[1:02:15] had a Sabbath and seven years they had a
[1:02:18] Sabbath and seven Sabbath was 49 years
[1:02:21] and the 50th year was a jubilee so if it
[1:02:24] was caught in slavery and you're young
[1:02:26] and you get old you was 10 and I was 50
[1:02:29] years 60 you could go back with your
[1:02:31] stick if you have a stick but you're
[1:02:32] going back to inheritance you're going
[1:02:35] back to your family and no devil could
[1:02:38] stop that no powers could stop that
[1:02:41] because that is the law that God set up
[1:02:44] oh give the Lord some Praises oh
[1:02:47] hallelujah praise God and in this
[1:02:50] Jubilee every man that has lost his
[1:02:54] inheritance if he was a Freeborn or true
[1:02:56] blooded Israelite no matter who held the
[1:03:00] possession it had to go back to him free
[1:03:03] he didn't have to pay a thing
[1:03:05] no price
[1:03:07] without money
[1:03:08] without price you have to pay nothing
[1:03:11] nothing to that safe Master because
[1:03:14] you're smoking and drinking nothing
[1:03:16] nothing at all you don't owe him nothing
[1:03:19] you have the freedom to go back as a son
[1:03:22] or daughter of the Living God as if you
[1:03:24] never did it as if it never backflated
[1:03:27] as if it never was lost as if you never
[1:03:30] fell away
[1:03:31] a jubilee
[1:03:33] Oh Glory to God Amen praise God he
[1:03:37] didn't have to pay a thing he didn't
[1:03:39] have to do a thing just stop what he was
[1:03:42] doing and go back to his inheritance
[1:03:46] stop what you're doing what Jesus told a
[1:03:49] woman woman go and sin no more or give
[1:03:54] the Lord some Praises this morning oh I
[1:03:57] feel the fire in the building this
[1:04:00] morning prayers they should never shout
[1:04:02] you could shout this morning because God
[1:04:05] gonna give you a jubilee God gonna give
[1:04:08] you a release
[1:04:09] oh praise the name of the Lord
[1:04:14] let's go he had a right to it
[1:04:17] it was his god-given right because he by
[1:04:21] Grace inherited it it would have been
[1:04:24] given to the fathers handed on year
[1:04:25] after year no matter what
[1:04:27] if he lost it it must go free it meant
[1:04:30] Grace is the way provided for each
[1:04:35] individual to return to the rightful
[1:04:38] inheritance
[1:04:42] we're going to get down to that Prodigal
[1:04:44] Son
[1:04:45] because the Prodigal Son asked the
[1:04:47] father
[1:04:48] for his portion
[1:04:51] when the father releases to the son it
[1:04:54] was no longer the father's own you know
[1:04:55] it was the son's own
[1:04:58] he said give me my portion give me my
[1:05:01] inheritance what did Caleb say give me
[1:05:03] my mountain
[1:05:04] you have to come to a spot where you
[1:05:06] want your portion I'm not hearing you
[1:05:09] where you want your inheritance
[1:05:18] okay the Lord some Praises if your
[1:05:21] father leave inheritance to you that is
[1:05:23] yours that is yours if you don't get
[1:05:27] that this morning I'm saying it to you
[1:05:28] that is yours no man have a right to
[1:05:32] hinder you from possessing your
[1:05:35] god-given inheritance
[1:05:39] that's what Jesus died for
[1:05:41] that's what she has made a price for
[1:05:43] oh my God
[1:05:46] so matter what's taking place if he lost
[1:05:48] it it must go free it meant Grace is the
[1:05:53] way provided for each individual to
[1:05:57] return to the rightful inheritance
[1:05:59] what a picture it gave us tonight of the
[1:06:02] church in this last days you see what
[1:06:04] man can do then you see what God does
[1:06:06] What man does is feeling will feel on us
[1:06:10] feel always feel but what God does is
[1:06:13] eternal and must forever remain nothing
[1:06:16] can ever take it away God give it it's
[1:06:20] his free gift and by Sovereign foresight
[1:06:23] saw it and placed it and there is
[1:06:25] nothing can ever move it it's there
[1:06:28] eternally there we go and the Jubilee
[1:06:30] actually was God's manner of expressing
[1:06:34] Grace to his people for restoring or be
[1:06:37] brought back to the rightful position
[1:06:40] we need to go back to the power of God
[1:06:44] although in numbers persecution's always
[1:06:47] shrinking the church
[1:06:53] so when God light fire under your feet
[1:06:55] or under your seat it's good
[1:07:00] don't say Amen
[1:07:01] it's still good
[1:07:03] whether I like it they don't like it
[1:07:04] they're still good persecution always
[1:07:07] threatened the church we have had it too
[1:07:09] easy
[1:07:11] amen
[1:07:13] we get Slot full
[1:07:15] we get to a place where we don't want to
[1:07:17] move on because everything is just
[1:07:20] handed to us
[1:07:23] now we have a bunch of young people now
[1:07:25] under the spirit of entitlement
[1:07:27] they feel somebody owe them this one
[1:07:29] open Society with them the parents told
[1:07:30] them this one over them
[1:07:34] he's a Christian
[1:07:36] curse of entitlement we get thoughtful
[1:07:39] we get to a place where we don't want to
[1:07:42] move on
[1:07:43] because we everything is just handed to
[1:07:45] us it takes sorrow
[1:07:48] and tears and sweat and prayer and faith
[1:07:54] and promise to move forward in the power
[1:07:58] of the Holy Spirit
[1:08:03] I want everybody to say Amen to that
[1:08:06] because that applies that each and every
[1:08:09] one of us and I will say it again in
[1:08:12] case you miss any of these words
[1:08:15] [Music]
[1:08:27] it takes sorrow
[1:08:28] and tears
[1:08:30] and sweat
[1:08:32] and prayer and faith and these things

[1:12:13] gone out of these things and losing our
[1:12:15] inheritance
[1:12:16] oh my
[1:12:18] so now a man and his family could go
[1:12:20] back to the original inheritance if they
[1:12:22] could hear the Jubilee trumpet song and
[1:12:24] know what it meant to them if they heard
[1:12:26] the priests on the trumpet the minister
[1:12:28] the trumpet is the gospel and when they
[1:12:30] hear it and they know what it means they
[1:12:32] know that the inheritance no matter
[1:12:34] where they lost no matter how far went
[1:12:36] or fall back they had a privilege to
[1:12:38] come and receive it again The
[1:12:40] Inheritance the whole family could come
[1:12:42] and receive it tonight
[1:12:44] oh my soul listen praise remember he
[1:12:48] could go free didn't have to pay nothing
[1:12:50] didn't have to do nothing just get up
[1:12:53] and go that's all he had to do go back
[1:12:57] if he knew the song of the trumpet he
[1:13:00] knew that the song on the trumpet see
[1:13:01] for there was for sons of God
[1:13:03] now Jesus ate Saint John eat it if I
[1:13:06] said the son abide forever now a servant
[1:13:08] does not abide
[1:13:10] a servant does not abide remember he's a
[1:13:15] son not a servant he's a son because
[1:13:17] he's born a son he didn't join he's born
[1:13:20] a son Oh Glory to God do you believe
[1:13:22] that
[1:13:23] praise God praise God praise God so all

[1:13:42] I've noticed
[1:13:43] how the Holy Spirit do you know there is
[1:13:46] some things that we have to do

[1:13:56] we are the branches and he's the Vine
[1:13:59] but Divine cut their fruit

[1:15:39] give the Lord some praises
[1:15:42] hallelujah hallelujah let's continue
[1:15:49] what we talk about we are talking about
[1:15:50] demons in the spiritual form in the soul
[1:15:53] they are in the soul
[1:15:55] the same ad as they are in the body
[1:15:58] even cancer has been declared to be a
[1:16:01] fourth dimension disease
[1:16:03] it's an honorary mention
[1:16:05] it's demonology here we go every disease
[1:16:10] is a fourth dimension disease
[1:16:12] the beginning of it
[1:16:17] so the beginning of every disease and
[1:16:19] sickness is a spirit
[1:16:23] Spirit stripping started breakup cells
[1:16:25] they get a tumor then more cells break
[1:16:28] and spread and spread and spread the
[1:16:30] preacher come and curse the spirit out
[1:16:32] of that body
[1:16:33] you get healed
[1:16:36] doctors tried to cut the whole thing out
[1:16:38] with the spirit in it
[1:16:39] you get healed too
[1:16:41] but it stopped
[1:16:43] in the fourth dimension
[1:16:45] we live in three dimensions but there's
[1:16:47] a four dimension x-ray prove that
[1:16:49] television proved that putting a TV
[1:16:52] screen here no one putting on you still
[1:16:53] see pictures but nobody is standing
[1:16:55] inside the TV is light something passing
[1:16:58] that you cannot see that they're picking
[1:17:00] up that is showing to you well that same
[1:17:03] way principle God could praise God to a
[1:17:06] reflector in tight God could drop down
[1:17:09] his thoughts and his words and speak
[1:17:11] directly to you
[1:17:13] from that next dimension
[1:17:16] that your knees could be met and your
[1:17:18] prayer could be answered and you can
[1:17:20] hear direct from God this morning
[1:17:22] [Music]
[1:17:23] [Applause]
[1:17:25] regardless of what I want to speak God
[1:17:27] can speak directly to you
[1:17:29] [Applause]
[1:17:33] let's continue
[1:17:34] no cancer in the body
[1:17:37] or cancer in the soul the demon can come
[1:17:40] and eat a place
[1:17:42] there are many times
[1:17:44] many peoples with good thoughts
[1:17:46] good people who try to rest upon some
[1:17:49] theology
[1:17:50] and they have been taught since a child
[1:17:52] and still find the dung and their being
[1:17:55] done in their soul that they still have
[1:17:58] something that's not right
[1:18:00] many of you here this morning no doubt
[1:18:02] whenever you find Christians gathered
[1:18:04] together you find people who have those
[1:18:05] Spirits in them
[1:18:07] it's undesirable
[1:18:09] they don't want them they say oh if I
[1:18:11] could just quit lying
[1:18:13] if I could only quit lusting if I only
[1:18:16] quit this dark no that is devils
[1:18:19] and they come in the form of religion
[1:18:20] many times
[1:18:22] let's continue someone said the other
[1:18:24] day brother Branham do you think it's
[1:18:26] wrong to do a certain thing I know we
[1:18:28] read this many times and hope this ring
[1:18:30] to you special this morning
[1:18:32] someone asked the other day brother do
[1:18:34] you think it's wrong to do a certain
[1:18:36] thing I said what are you questioning
[1:18:38] about
[1:18:39] if there's a question in your mind
[1:18:42] leave it alone
[1:18:44] don't do it at all
[1:18:47] there just stay with that when you start
[1:18:50] to do anything if there's a question
[1:18:51] what is right or wrong stay away from it
[1:18:54] whether it's the bedroom whether it's
[1:18:56] the drawing room where it is the kitchen
[1:18:58] where it is wherever don't do it once
[1:19:01] there is a question
[1:19:03] could we give the Lord some praises
[1:19:05] don't do it at all then you know you are
[1:19:09] right
[1:19:10] I am positive sure this morning if men
[1:19:13] and women can only get you to the
[1:19:15] position to where their soul and their
[1:19:17] thinking and their attitudes will be
[1:19:19] perfect in the sight of God that would
[1:19:21] be one of the most powerful churches
[1:19:22] that ever existed something transform
[1:19:25] your thinking transform your attitudes
[1:19:27] the people inside of here have different
[1:19:29] thoughts they have different needs they
[1:19:30] have different challenges and a word
[1:19:32] have to come to you now the world have
[1:19:34] to come from God the minister to all
[1:19:36] these different needs here I am not the
[1:19:38] supplier he's a supplier I am not the
[1:19:40] source he is the source I am not the
[1:19:42] father he is the father oh God he is one
[1:19:45] who spoke his word and know exactly how
[1:19:47] we set you how we call you what your
[1:19:50] challenges are what your need is what
[1:19:52] you need this morning he know what you
[1:19:54] have needed
[1:19:55] Oh Glory to God and some point in time

[1:20:09] have to change my work I have to change
[1:20:11] my talk I have to change my operation
[1:20:13] [Applause]
[1:20:20] therefore if a man and woman could ever
[1:20:22] get their thoughts and their testimony
[1:20:24] and their lives so line up with God
[1:20:25] until the channel of the holy spirit
[1:20:28] will be so perfectly one with God what
[1:20:30] will take place if the man and the woman
[1:20:33] could ever get lined up where the
[1:20:35] freedom from the hearts would fade from
[1:20:37] the animals Freedom From The Heart yes
[1:20:40] you need to ask somebody a question and
[1:20:42] they had to think in mind how to answer
[1:20:43] you know Freedom there you know
[1:20:46] nice mental gymnastics going on Saturday
[1:20:48] because you don't want to see it so you
[1:20:50] see it's so take it so how many tickets
[1:20:53] when there's freedom is freedom
[1:20:55] Jesus wasn't asked questions because
[1:20:57] they wanted answers they were asking us
[1:20:59] questions to trap him that way they
[1:21:02] asked should we pay taxes to Caesar they
[1:21:04] may want to answer that you know it's
[1:21:06] the truck that's trying to trap him
[1:21:07] they're not trying for edification the
[1:21:09] question asked Jesus was to trap him oh
[1:21:12] give the Lord a shout there are
[1:21:14] questions they could ask
[1:21:17] when this open asks if what did God say
[1:21:19] it's not because they want to be edified
[1:21:22] Lucifer wasn't like a verification
[1:21:23] looking to be blessed by the word from
[1:21:26] God he wanted to know what the woman
[1:21:28] know that he could get a wrong that the
[1:21:30] twist his word the word
[1:21:32] what he's gonna say so God I tell you
[1:21:35] so God not talking to you
[1:21:38] you better go and check God you know
[1:21:40] he is
[1:21:42] but she said God said we could eat of
[1:21:44] all the trees but if you'd have missed
[1:21:46] the garden we shall not eat before the
[1:21:48] day eat you shall not surely die
[1:21:50] and it's a person that will go tell you
[1:21:52] oh gosh
[1:21:53] that is God's word you know but you you
[1:21:55] shall not surely die
[1:21:57] God only impose that if you only eat
[1:21:59] that tree your eyes shall be open
[1:22:02] your understanding shall be open these
[1:22:05] are the people right now there are
[1:22:06] plenty understanding open knowledge
[1:22:07] shall increase they have too much of
[1:22:08] knowledge now
[1:22:11] by that
[1:22:13] Artificial Intelligence coming on top of
[1:22:15] that now this is lunacy
[1:22:18] but this is it now and all God wants us
[1:22:20] to do is to believe his word
[1:22:22] receive his word isn't that right
[1:22:25] so watch many people come up
[1:22:27] to the altar to be prayed for
[1:22:29] they have intellectual fate they confess
[1:22:32] their sins join a church intellectual
[1:22:34] Faith they believe it in their heart
[1:22:35] their mind they believe it because they
[1:22:37] hate it they believe it because they
[1:22:38] know it's the best policy but that is
[1:22:40] not what God's looking for
[1:22:43] so we can have ten thousand people that
[1:22:44] are here but what kind of fit
[1:22:47] is in those ten thousand let's let's
[1:22:49] back up here now he didn't look at your
[1:22:51] intellectual fate he looks on the heart
[1:22:54] where on the inside when it comes from
[1:22:57] the heart all things are possible then
[1:22:59] oh do you believe that give me a
[1:23:02] preacher are you ready you want to get
[1:23:04] the keynote give me a preacher give me a
[1:23:07] Christian give me a housewife that's a
[1:23:10] Christian give me a farmer a factory
[1:23:12] worker that will put God first in
[1:23:14] everything I will show you a man that
[1:23:17] will be successful in spite of all the
[1:23:19] devil can put on him
[1:23:21] I want to hear a bigger name than that
[1:23:23] this is God telling you that you are
[1:23:26] going to be successful if you prepare to
[1:23:29] put God first in everything
[1:23:31] or give the Lord some praises
[1:23:34] he seeks God's first
[1:23:37] we get in somewhere
[1:23:38] so many people are listening to enticing
[1:23:41] Spirits instead of taking the word of
[1:23:43] God spirits that in the world they are
[1:23:46] demons and they go in places and they
[1:23:49] get among men ministers
[1:23:53] yes entice in spirits they get among
[1:23:57] church members
[1:23:59] that is true but over it yes they get
[1:24:01] amongst good people
[1:24:04] I don't want bad people you know good
[1:24:06] church people good people and they cause
[1:24:08] them to come into an illusion and they
[1:24:11] say things and do things and teach
[1:24:15] things and practice things that is
[1:24:18] contrary to the word of God
[1:24:22] Say Amen
[1:24:23] you're saying Amen to the word I'm not
[1:24:26] trying to present what I'm thinking I'm
[1:24:28] feeling this is prophetic utterance
[1:24:35] so one of intellectual Faith the other
[1:24:37] is a direct revelation of God
[1:24:40] David danced before the Lord his wife
[1:24:42] laughed at him God looking from heaven
[1:24:44] and said David you're a man after my own
[1:24:46] heart his mother was right his life was
[1:24:48] right behind it so just because we can
[1:24:51] be emotional don't mean we are saved
[1:24:53] because we go to church don't mean we
[1:24:55] are saying don't believe those enticing
[1:24:58] Spirits a real spirit of God a real word
[1:25:01] of God is the truth of God which is the
[1:25:04] seed of God produce God in your life to
[1:25:08] be Godly and to be holy and simply
[1:25:12] among a lot of people we find that we're
[1:25:13] emotions and so forth become stackless
[1:25:15] and backbitings and walking on Godly
[1:25:17] things brother that is sulfuric acid in
[1:25:19] the church this one is not right
[1:25:21] somebody's saying that that one is not
[1:25:23] right this one is not right if you chase
[1:25:24] it down nine out of ten times is the
[1:25:26] very person making this still that's not
[1:25:28] right
[1:25:30] God hates this God among brethren
[1:25:35] be reverent
[1:25:36] be holy and love God
[1:25:39] oh praise the name of the Lord glory to
[1:25:43] God
[1:25:44] now we come to Mr Samson
[1:25:48] servant of God
[1:25:51] deceive
[1:25:53] deceived within and without
[1:25:55] he deceived without my Delilah
[1:25:58] but he's deceived within that he's at a
[1:26:01] lie and feel that was all right as long
[1:26:04] as he's going to reveal the strength the
[1:26:05] source of his strength he started to
[1:26:07] play games
[1:26:08] because he knew he was gifted
[1:26:10] Hallelujah but he playing games
[1:26:13] but he's gifted he is playing games he
[1:26:16] know God is with him he's playing game
[1:26:18] because you know you have them Seven
[1:26:20] Locks that keeps the Covenant with God
[1:26:22] but that devil behind the Lila person
[1:26:25] and he understands a war going on
[1:26:27] because he pressing him and pressing him
[1:26:30] to find out a secret now if the devil
[1:26:33] see you as strong and you're pressing on
[1:26:34] you think the devil will say and make a
[1:26:37] special and sing about you that you are
[1:26:38] strong and pressing on no he won't
[1:26:40] inspire you out he want to see a secret
[1:26:42] you want to know why you're praising him
[1:26:44] in the good times and while you praise
[1:26:46] him in the bad times and when things
[1:26:48] don't you're still praising them I went
[1:26:50] things up you're still praising him you
[1:26:52] don't understand why you praising God
[1:26:54] you lose your work you lose your job you
[1:26:57] lose this you lose that but you're still
[1:26:59] giving him praise the Lord Give the Lord
[1:27:02] take it away blessed be the name of the
[1:27:05] lord the devil can't understand why you
[1:27:09] have that Source why you have that
[1:27:11] strength why you have that connection
[1:27:13] they lose husband you lose weight you
[1:27:15] lose this one you lose that one well

[1:27:27] [Applause]
[1:27:31] Glory
[1:27:32] [Music]
[1:27:35] when you're under the spirit of
[1:27:37] deception you are blind
[1:27:41] because being deceived beings they think
[1:27:43] you're right and you're wrong Adam was
[1:27:45] not deceived he was
[1:27:47] she actually thought she was right
[1:27:49] Adam knew he was wrong
[1:27:57] so when Delilah strength
[1:28:03] they say you love me you say every time
[1:28:04] you read chords and things I will be
[1:28:06] weak like a dead Normal Man no he know
[1:28:09] if that anointing come up for him he
[1:28:10] like normally
[1:28:13] that power for granted
[1:28:15] you took that fine entitlement
[1:28:18] and when she was Samson the Philistine
[1:28:20] is a pondy
[1:28:22] the man no he calling for Philistines
[1:28:25] it's not something we have a case we
[1:28:27] have we have some bananas and some
[1:28:29] apples outside for use for the
[1:28:31] it's still his times they jump on him
[1:28:33] after you get time records and he pass
[1:28:35] it
[1:28:36] that like a joke
[1:28:40] but she pleaded
[1:28:42] until he talked about his here
[1:28:45] and if I caught I got to lose it and she
[1:28:46] cut off his hair
[1:28:50] and the Bible says something to shake
[1:28:52] himself like before
[1:28:55] came to himself
[1:28:57] only to realize the power
[1:29:00] it's not dear
[1:29:02] he came to realize he's just like
[1:29:04] everybody else
[1:29:06] what for God
[1:29:09] God for the Covenant
[1:29:11] Give the Lord a shout
[1:29:13] when Samson came to himself he was weak
[1:29:20] and the penalty of breaking God's word
[1:29:23] sent him in the dungeon
[1:29:26] with his eyes dug out
[1:29:28] oh praise God under judgment for years
[1:29:31] but while Samson was in prison
[1:29:34] another shock of hair was growing out
[1:29:37] while Samson was in prison he saw a
[1:29:41] possibility
[1:29:42] so even in prison as a son
[1:29:44] [Applause]
[1:29:47] even in prison as a son even in the bar
[1:29:51] in the rum shop wherever as a son you
[1:29:54] can see a possibility
[1:29:56] Oh Glory to God get the Lord some
[1:29:58] Praises do you see a possibility this
[1:30:01] morning to return to power to return to
[1:30:05] inheritance to return to give God glory
[1:30:08] to return to the honor and glory of God
[1:30:10] do you see a possibility
[1:30:11] [Applause]
[1:30:18] Hallelujah
[1:30:20] something you know the story
[1:30:22] you say lead me to the Post
[1:30:24] a little boy leading him now all the
[1:30:26] time he's doing his own thing as a
[1:30:28] department of young people
[1:30:30] when we like to do our own thing
[1:30:32] you can get blinded doing your own thing
[1:30:34] you know
[1:30:35] you could get in prison doing your own
[1:30:36] thing
[1:30:37] no a little boy is listening
[1:30:39] lead me to the pillars and then Samson
[1:30:42] put his day as hands between the pillars
[1:30:44] and say once more
[1:30:46] I pray God
[1:30:47] once more Lord let me die with the
[1:30:50] Philistines
[1:30:52] is dead than in his life
[1:30:54] he brought honor and Glory
[1:30:56] to God
[1:30:58] Hallelujah
[1:31:00] glory to God enticing spirits
[1:31:03] rejected
[1:31:04] and the prophet prophesied God sendeth
[1:31:06] another church just before the end time
[1:31:08] that the power of the Holy Ghost can
[1:31:10] come into her in the demonstration of
[1:31:13] the spirit not just talk and talk on
[1:31:15] Bible talk and the demonstration of the
[1:31:18] spirit
[1:31:19] that acts 2 4 Acts 2 38 all of it will
[1:31:22] be following right along with the church
[1:31:23] signs and wonders accompany the apostles
[1:31:26] great signs of his resurrection among
[1:31:28] them we while we are in prison surely
[1:31:31] God is growing a crop somewhere
[1:31:34] for the last great kill maybe you my
[1:31:37] Christian friend here this morning may
[1:31:39] it be your strength begin to grow I pray
[1:31:40] that this message this morning and out

[1:31:44] that this message will help bring
[1:31:45] vitamins to your system that will grow
[1:31:48] our spiritual power back into your life
[1:31:50] again oh glory to God glory to God
[1:31:55] so now we're coming on to our scripture
[1:31:56] now
[1:31:58] Luke 15.
[1:31:59] on the Book of Luke
[1:32:01] there are three parables
[1:32:03] this book that we talk about this
[1:32:05] prodigal son the three Parables very
[1:32:08] interesting three Parables that is dear
[1:32:12] the first Parable is that of the lost
[1:32:14] sheep
[1:32:15] the second Parable is that of the Lost
[1:32:17] coin
[1:32:19] the third Parable we call it that of the
[1:32:22] lost son
[1:32:23] let's look at the first Parable before
[1:32:25] we get down to our last one
[1:32:27] the first part of the lost sheep that's
[1:32:29] Luke 15. one to seven
[1:32:33] then Drew near unto him
[1:32:36] all the publicans and sinners for to
[1:32:38] hear him
[1:32:39] and the Pharisees in Christ remember
[1:32:41] saying this man receiveth sinners
[1:32:44] and eat it with them
[1:32:46] so we have a mark against This Man
[1:32:48] Called Jesus because he's a he's sitting
[1:32:50] with Sinners and he eats him with them
[1:32:52] and he speak this Parable unto them sin
[1:32:56] no powers are truths in the form of
[1:32:58] stories
[1:32:59] so Jesus has given him a story
[1:33:01] he said
[1:33:03] what man of you
[1:33:05] having a hundred sheep
[1:33:08] if he lose one of them
[1:33:11] dot not leave the 90 and 9 in the
[1:33:14] wilderness
[1:33:15] and go after that which is lost until
[1:33:19] you find it
[1:33:20] and and when he found it
[1:33:22] he laid it on his shoulders rejoicing
[1:33:26] and when he come at home
[1:33:28] he called her together his friends
[1:33:31] and neighbors seen unto them Rejoice
[1:33:34] with me
[1:33:35] for I have found my sheep which was lost
[1:33:38] I say unto you that likewise Joy shall
[1:33:41] be in heaven
[1:33:42] over one sinner that repented more than
[1:33:45] 90 and 90 just prisons
[1:33:48] which need no repentance
[1:33:51] that's the first Parable that Jesus gave
[1:33:54] Hallelujah note
[1:33:58] the first parable
[1:34:00] the story of the Lost
[1:34:02] has solely to do with the shepherd
[1:34:05] the Sheep is not the important part here
[1:34:09] is the burden is for the shepherd
[1:34:13] the Sheep couldn't do anything
[1:34:15] the shepherd
[1:34:17] or the true Shepherd
[1:34:19] was willing to leave the 99.
[1:34:24] and here it is in the wilderness
[1:34:31] foreign to go after that which is lost
[1:34:35] until
[1:34:36] until then
[1:34:38] until until when until he finds it
[1:34:42] now it's not easy to be left in the
[1:34:44] wilderness
[1:34:46] and you can't see the shepherd
[1:34:51] people say where is Shepherd boy like
[1:34:52] things things different wrong I ain't
[1:34:54] seen this Shepherd
[1:34:57] he said they were left in the wilderness
[1:35:01] what kind of Shepherd is that
[1:35:03] in addition to not seeing the shepherd
[1:35:07] them to see the shepherd coming back
[1:35:09] with this strange sheep
[1:35:11] or this sheep that has gone the street
[1:35:13] to see the Sheep get in our shoulder
[1:35:15] right
[1:35:18] you can imagine us saying I never get a
[1:35:21] I never get Schuler right
[1:35:25] I hear long time in church
[1:35:28] and I never see the shepherd put me on
[1:35:30] your shoulder
[1:35:31] that won't go that's three and now he's
[1:35:33] getting our shoulder right
[1:35:39] isn't that something
[1:35:41] again
[1:35:43] this is solely the work of the shepherd
[1:35:46] returning the Sheep back to the fold
[1:35:49] the Sheep returned
[1:35:52] it was always a sheep
[1:35:54] it was never a goat
[1:35:56] once a sheep
[1:35:59] always a sheep
[1:36:00] once a son
[1:36:03] always the son give the Lord some
[1:36:04] praises
[1:36:06] Hallelujah
[1:36:09] [Applause]
[1:36:10] let's continue in addition

[1:36:15] friends to rejoice
[1:36:17] sheep lost
[1:36:19] sheep phone
[1:36:21] sheep returned then rejoicing
[1:36:25] that's the pattern
[1:36:26] sheep lost
[1:36:28] she found
[1:36:29] sheep returned then let us rejoice
[1:36:33] or give the Lord some praises
[1:36:35] then he said I say unto you likewise Joy
[1:36:38] shall be in heaven over one sin ever
[1:36:41] repented that over 99 just persons which
[1:36:45] need no repentance
[1:36:47] or give the Lord some praises
[1:36:49] you love him this morning
[1:36:51] Hallelujah

[1:37:45] this second Parable was placed in the
[1:37:48] second coming of the Lord

[1:48:13] you take your sons and try them
[1:48:15] because Rascals you know
[1:48:19] only when the father coming home they
[1:48:21] start to do things wrongly yeah

[1:53:56] Seven
[1:54:00] this message don't have that at all
[1:54:05] let's take the parable become the preach
[1:54:07] this morning
[1:54:08] Luke chapter 15 reading from verse 11.
[1:54:11] same chapter Jesus speaks so you know we
[1:54:15] won't have a long service today right
[1:54:17] how are you think
[1:54:19] won't have a long service today
[1:54:22] Luke 15 verse 11 says he said a certain
[1:54:25] man
[1:54:26] had two sons
[1:54:27] not 12 just two
[1:54:30] and the younger of them said to his
[1:54:32] father father
[1:54:33] give me the portion of goods that
[1:54:36] followed to me
[1:54:38] and he divided unto them his living
[1:54:41] there's two sons
[1:54:42] he wanted portion
[1:54:44] as a son every son her portion every son
[1:54:47] of inheritance and Korean sons of God
[1:54:51] and not many days after
[1:54:53] the youngest son gathered all together
[1:54:56] and took his journey into our country
[1:54:58] and their wasted a substance with
[1:55:00] riotous living

[1:55:11] when he spent all their roles are Mighty
[1:55:13] famine in the land nice recession that
[1:55:16] is pressure that is no job no work so
[1:55:18] it's double double trouble for him
[1:55:21] money run out plus farming far country
[1:55:27] he began to be in want
[1:55:29] ing time he was shared by Pizza Chinese

[1:55:44] my God business things good no he didn't
[1:55:47] want
[1:55:51] it
[1:55:55] so you find out man with a big big hose
[1:55:56] with some swine Daniels and you're
[1:55:59] living behind the house people see them
[1:56:02] walking inside this big big Gateway and
[1:56:04] thing like that they might know is is a
[1:56:06] room behind the room the room behind the
[1:56:08] house is where he's living in living
[1:56:10] next to the swine you know
[1:56:15] he's a CEO of swine development
[1:56:23] he went and joined himself to a sit in
[1:56:26] the left country
[1:56:27] and he sent him into his field to feed
[1:56:31] eat
[1:56:36] so he competed with swine for husk
[1:56:39] no man gave unto him
[1:56:41] and then we get to the verse we read
[1:56:43] this morning
[1:56:44] and when
[1:56:45] he came
[1:56:47] to himself
[1:56:48] he said
[1:56:50] I how many I had Servants of my father

[2:17:33] I'm a younger brother
[2:17:38] now with anybody was in the field and he
[2:17:40] came on July to the house and he heard
[2:17:42] music and dancing
[2:17:44] you hit it
[2:17:46] he called one of the servants and asked
[2:17:49] what these things meant
[2:17:51] and he said unto him thy brother is come
[2:17:56] and thy father had killed the fatted
[2:17:59] calf
[2:18:01] because he had received him safe and

[2:18:39] the specialty sang this Sunday before
[2:18:41] that couldn't count
[2:18:43] the Hallelujah may God bless you brother

[2:20:35] attitude to his brother and is a shame
[2:20:37] that God could bless people to get back
[2:20:39] to the hopes of God and people of
[2:20:41] attitudes
[2:20:44] something wrong with you not for them
