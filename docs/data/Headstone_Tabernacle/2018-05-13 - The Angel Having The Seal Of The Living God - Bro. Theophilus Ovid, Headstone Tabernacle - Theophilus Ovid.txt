morning so we want to get into the word you ready for the word this morning okay ZK chapter 9 revelations up to seven we want to go to do two scriptures this morning Ezekiel 9 revelation chapter 7 Thank You musicians easycap chapter 9 reading from verse 1 to 6 revelation 7 read verse 1 to 4 we didn't Ezekiel chapter 9 verse 1 he cried also in mine ears with a loud voice saying caused him to have charged over the city to john near even every man with his destroying weapon in his hand and behold six men came from the way of the higher gate which led towards the north and every man a slaughter weapon in his hand and one man among them was clothed with linen with a writer's inkhorn by his side and they went in and stood beside the brazen altar and the glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the cherub whereupon he was to the threshold of the house and he called to the man clothed with linen which had the writers ink one by his side and the Lord said unto him go to the midst of the city through the midst of Jerusalem and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and cry for all the abominations that be done in the midst thereof and the others he said in my hearing go ye after him through the city and smite let not your eyes spear neither heavy pity slay utterly all and young both maids little children and woman but come not near any man upon whom is the mark and begin at my sanctuary then they began at the ancient men which were before the house Revelation chapter 7 when I read from verse 1 and after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth holding the four winds of the earth that the wind should not blow on the earth nor on the scene on any tree I saw another angel ascending from the east having the seal of the Living God and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea saying hurt not the earth needless sea nor the trees till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads and I heard the number of them which were sealed and they were sealed a hundred and forty-four thousand of all the tribes of the Chilam Balam may God bless his word you may be seated oh praise the name of the Lord oh thank you lord well have a title this morning and the title is the angel having the seal of the Living God that's a title of a subject the seal of God and an inspiration crying and sighin that's my inspiration crying and sigh now we know 1933 God give the Prophet seven visions which he says must come to pass before the coming of the Lord and the fifth vision he said science will progress in such a way until they will make a car that will not have to be guided by a steering wheel and the cars will continue to be shaped like an egg until the consummation the end time I seen American family going on the road in a broad way rising in a car with their backs turn towards where a wheel should be look like they were playing checkers or cards and so on like that and then the six he said I saw a woman stand up beautiful looking just in a high royal purple I got a parenthesis here she was a great ruler in United States and he has perhaps the Catholic Church a woman some woman I know this is a woman's nation this nation is number thirteen and prophecy she's got thirteen stripes thirteen stars she started thirteen colonies thirteen everything is thirteen and it and it appears in the thirteenth chapter of Revelation she's 13 she's a woman's nation and now for the last vision he says now then I turn and I looked and I saw this United States burning like a smaller rocks had been blown up it was burning like a heap of fire in logs or something just set it afire and look as far as I could see she has been blown up and then the vision left me five out of tree has happened or 707 has happened and so on so this was the vision that the prophet have and we hadn't long known to that vision we know what man has built will produce that vision with Atomics and everything else so her message lunacy contempt for defeat he said notice let's get back to kena again let's get back to some faith in the beginning watch those spirits how do you begin to move it's the spirit of anything that does the work of it anyhow so it's not just the thing is the spirit behind this thing there's a spirit in your home there's a spirit in this church there's a spirit of motivate in your life this is a spirit behind the same and that's why you have to get into the right spirit that it could work correctly for you not just teens but the spirit behind it and you have to know what spirit is behind operating behind you could we say Amen the people here we go have got to be in this kind of a spirit to bring the latter days so the latter days is a spirit that's why Jesus said as it was in the days of nor as it was in the days of Sodom so will it be because a spirit atmosphere was there and he is saying to them that spirit must make one to come back hallelujah to bring that prophecy to pass or glory to God listen this bride will not feel this bride will not fall display understand because this bride will have a spirit which is the spirit which is the Holy Spirit this is what what promise I feel confident of these promises that the Prophet spoke we are resting on it Oh glory that God do believe that so the people have to be in this kind of a spirit to bring the latter days the people in the spirit of the latter days the nations are in the spirit of the end time the God atomic weapons hydrogen weapons all kind of things because it's the spirit of the day and the people are in the spirit of the end time and the church is moving together under the power and impact of the holy spirit so what are you saying if outside is moving in their spirit you have to move under the impact of the Holy Ghost you have to move under your anointing or glory lagar some a stop in a minute I believe the people are in the preparation for the last great destruction this world will ever know I believe we are the endtime you can speak to people you could put a Billy Graham in every city in the United States they will drink whiskey they smoke cigarettes laugh at you and everything else they are in the spirit of the last days no hear this God cannot send destruction before the people are in the spirit for destruction God will never destroy anything man destroys himself so the world has got to get in the spirit of the last days before the last days can come and we in the spirit of the last days so the bride before anything could happen the pride of the get in the spirit or do you believe that for glory let God because revelation 7 says stop the winds stop the wars stop everything because I'm a bunch of people to be sealed and that's punch watch was a hundred and forty four thousand Jews that's the scripture but before the Jews are sealed hallelujah there's a pride to be sealed that's you you are the eleventh hour Gentile workers but the promised to receive the same pay that the first church received this is your promise or glory of God and God can't go back to the Jews until you get your promise the customer can go back to the Jews until the Gentiles is over so you cut the B's yield and the fact that the angel from the east have the seal of glory of the Living God it means you don't have to go to no man no man can see you no man can kill you or chlorine according to lore - oh praise could hallelujah go rejoice give a shout unto God [Applause] if you see that no man have the seal of God no man could deceive

is just about burnt out there won't be much more when the last drop is gone from the bucket or the container there'll be no more oil put in lamps they realize that they're in the last days there's not a hope on earth for us outside of Christ I pray tonight Lord that somehow in the psalmist of this moment the solemnity that you would now send the holy spirit that made them raise their hands and see them for my life of sin so here you bring a description in prayer about the Holy Spirit about the almost burnt out and when the last drop is going on the bucket or container there'd be no more oil to put in lungs that's a telling thing that's a powerful thing I wanted to will you just think how much you need the Holy Spirit Matthew 25 verse 1 then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be likened unto ten virgins took their lamps went forward to meet the bridegroom five of them were wise five were foolish there were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps while the bridegroom tarried they all slumbered and slept at a midnight there was a cry made behold abram cometh go out to meet him and all those virgins arose trim their lamps the foolish said to the wise give us of your oil for our lamps are going out but the wise answered saying not so least there'd be not enough for us and you but go ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves viola went to buy the bridegroom came and d-double ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut afterwards key most of the other virgins in Lord Lord open to us but he answered and said verily I say unto you I know you're not watch therefore for you know neither dinner are wherein the Son of Man comment oh my hallelujah all glory to God hallelujah what about them

which is the formal church fo and there's another one which is the saved church si the saved church but in that same church of two types wise visions and foolish virgins Oh hallelujah so it have the former it have the unbeliever is after saved but in the save of five vials five foolish all glory to God five just members five bright members or glory to God five people just come at the church and five people who receive in the word or glory to God are you at me now hallelujah watch said no oh you said I'm Methodist and Baptist so what difference does it make not the constant burden for the

will grieve the Holy Spirit or we you get catania get angry and your vex and so on postage and gone and you will remain a human's purchase the business making a bitterness baby so watch he's talking about watch know there's 144,000 Israel that's waiting for the coming of the Lord and kind of go in until the Gentiles are finished it's got to be finished so we're I'm said I taught to be wonderful he wanted to go to Israel himself he said I my ticket in my hand about 30 minutes before call in the Arabian plane line I was standing out here in Cairo Egypt I taught priests got in tomorrow as the Jews will receive the same thing that there are Pentecost just as sure as anything I thought if I stand here and tell them go pick us out a bunch of men out among you and bring them here then see we still Messiah then they were saying no upon the same grounds of your forefathers rejected the Messiah you receive him you receive the Holy Ghost and then we will evangelize the world something struck me and said do not go now for the hour is not yet the Gentiles isn't fulfilled yet daddy isn't finished oh I thought that was just me so I started again it got so bad and I just couldn't stand it I went out behind a hanger ball my head I said father is that you speaking to me he said do not go to Israel now the hour is not yet I went in and changed my ticket rotated again the other way see cause the always not yet but one of these days the message will go to Israel and God will send them Moses and Elijah in revelation 11 and they will do signs and wonders and over sign why the Gentile is finished the day of grace will leave the Gentile church the Pentecostal age would leave no these wise virgins oil in the Bible similar Holy Spirit we all know that and we are known the sacred oil or symbolize Holy Spirit so they were ready to go in at the wedding supper and we could go back in Ezekiel 9 and so forth now this version is a this was a foolish version this was a wise version and virgin means sanctified and clean if there was some way I could just make the people see it just burns in my soul these churches are clean and holy as this one if all a virgin's they're all virgins just clean the only difference was oil in the lamp the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost if it's in there it produced a very same kind of fire it did on Pentecost but they don't have no fire no oil in the lamp they have chose rituals just just a ritual fine ceremonies not against it Cree's that shake a conscience and songs like angel singing but you could put and you can't put your finger on your life you couldn't do it but that's still wrong it is part of it but not all of it that's the kind of misses the rapture clean people nice people but there's no hunger and there's no science there's no crime there's no holy spirit we read the other night these people will not be an organization there will be Wanderers along the land dwelling in tents poor and humble don't you try to curse them because I'm with them these people believe the same ritual they believe in what did the same God see but they didn't have someone who's following them Israel had a brass serpent smitten rock the chore of the King divine healing prophets they were dear with a blessing the same thing with the sleep and religion and the wise version you were both sanctified people this one had oil this one did not have oil they said we are just as good as you were there's none of us good as far as I'm concerned you're a bunch of holy rollers they had wakened but when they did this one could go in because they had oil in their lamps that was the difference this one could go in there was no ordinary lamp they went back to pray up to receive the Holy Ghost there were matter what pray up to receive the Holy Ghost but while they were gone it was all over yes the sleeping virgin this sleepin virgin now you want to know what would become of her watch they create tribulation they will have to go true no let me get the rest of that they were casting out of darkness where there was weeping and we'll in the national teeth or praise the name of the Lord so watch these two spirits working almost alike right down here now one is the denomination the other one is the Holy Ghost and Jesus said they will be so close that they would receive the very elected as possible these here we go are you ready are you listening these two spirits are marking their people for future judgments so you are being marked by the word to be sealed well yeah do you get that right now this morning and when put that match up
