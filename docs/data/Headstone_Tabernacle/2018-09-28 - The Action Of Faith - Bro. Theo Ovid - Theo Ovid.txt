you dancer come in and if I hear Bibles I give it to the two portions of Scripture tonight Matthew chapter 16 you wanna read from 13 to 19 you also wanna read from James chapter 2 verse 15 to 24 Matthew chapter 16 reading from verse 13 when Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi he asked his eye for saying whom do men say that I the Son of Man and they said some say that our John the Baptist saw me last as Jeremiah's one of the prophets he said unto them but whom say either I am Simon Peter answered and said thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God and jesus answered and said unto him blessed the dog Simon bar Jonah for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven I said to d-dad our Peter and upon this rock I will build my church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it and I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven whatever - I'll loosen it shall be loosed we didn't change dr. - wanna read from verse 15 and if a brother or sister be naked and destitute of daily food one of you say on the name depart in peace be warm and filled notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body what does it profit even so faith if it hath not works is dead being alone ye a man may say thou hast faith and I have works show me thy feet without I works and I will surely my feet by my works go believers that there is one God don't do as well the devil's also believe in tremble but will thou all know will thou know o vain man that faith without works is dead was not Abraham our Father justified by works when he had offered Isaac upon the altar see is the whole feet what would works and by works was feet me perfect and the scripture was fulfilled which saith abraham believed God it was imputed unto him for righteousness and he was called the friend of God you see then how that by works a man is justified I'm not by fetal me let us pray father we have read your word and we thank you for your word we are grateful for the Scriptures his being me to live in Israel and I pray tonight that the word become flesh and dwell among us father me to take the word and maybe like a direct arrow to the house of the people I mean Antonia saw the media a transformational service where their lives be completely transformed by this blessed Word of God and Jesse my ask it amen and amen you may be seated or praise the name of the Lord it's always a blessing and a privilege to be in the house of God that I have a tighter the action of faith praise God figure my hearing here in the world is not right last service we had here in receiving and acting on the world tonight we talked about the action of faith and have an inspiration the call of God I believe each one of you here tonight have a call of God upon your life it's not man that called you is call that culture not your family call you it's a calling of God I want you to dr. unkind side your spirit inside your heart that there's a call of God upon your life he didn't call him when he was good and nice and yours righteous he called me when he was filthy and he was no good it's a call for for just as you are and you came just as you are but he didn't leave you just as you are he began to tidy you up and clean you up because they was born in sin on a common ship iniquity or all filthiness Deanna rotten and so on but he said you are my child and I coming back for you I'm coming I'm coming to redeem you praise God I'm not somebody's just a bless you know but to come to bring you back because you were somewhere before and the scripture clearly states who we for new Accord so if you have to be in God's foreknowledge to get the calling of God let me say it again you have to be you have to be king courts for knowledge to get the calling of God so that is my Jesus had the ability to say Peter come and to come because he knew those guys means us on the book he came to Coleman direc all hallelujah that was Jesus word made flesh call in DC Cyprus but he released his spirit because he has a man standing there in Jerusalem and in Israel and so on like that he could do so much I know more but when his spirit released it released to only hold it seven spirits released for the whole earth the fine every predestinated seed I think the internet have billions of people how much billions not millions billions connects it to the internet that is man science and technology accomplish that but guardo need Internet God need just his spirit once the Spirit began to move it could reach but honestly the Holy Ghost will drop to go across the world overnight overnight the entire world over may with a wonderful glorious baptism of the Holy Ghost overnight I am standing here to you tonight are we a few in them but that has nothing to do with this am nipa tenth power that is a ball to be released you your ordinary but you don't know what about to take place something creates something magnificent something powerful about to break out nothing fit or glory the new man could stop it not your pascai even stop it the most of the Lord had spoken it he spoke to the prophesy will restore that I've done with you you can't stop the restoration that blood prophesy over your life or glory look what I will restore to you the years you can't even stop that God promised a bumper crop go something to bring back the oil in the wine what promise will bring back the figs will produce in its strength that mean you're gonna have production you wouldn't be bearing it on fruitful but you'll have a living fate I'm gonna invert you live in knowledge I live in temperance and live in patience and live in Parliament's and live in brotherly kindness this thing is gonna live whatever I'm said the house of God will live again this bride she will deliver him the devil cutter dog Rome cutter tongue but God said I'm gonna restore your glory to God hallelujah praise God Oh give him some praises tonight do you believe this is a word for you tonight or glory nobody and I want to see the action of it in your spirit in your soul in your hat Peter couldn't help it because inspiration move upon Peter you may be seated praise God or glory to God hallelujah question Jesus that's the question who do men say I am some say there's some say that and it easy to talk about what people say you could Rara and talk whole night about what people talking about but when he asked the disciples who do you say I am they got caught you go all of a sudden they realize they don't know they just know he's a messiah he's a master teacher he's healing the sick this one or whatever whatever but they don't know who that man really is now all of a sudden inspiration move up on Peter anointing move upon Peter fire drop upon Peter because he's a channel to get inspiration because he's a son he's a seed he don't have the Holy Ghost yet but he could get revelation he don't have the Holy Ghost yet but he could be inspired he don't have the Holy Ghost yet but the call of God is upon his life that's why Jesus came to him and Peter shopping at channel toward the Christ the Son of the Living God and Jesus said flesh and blood did not reveal that to you so revelation is supernatural go give the Lord a shout revelation is not natural leverage and supernatural you could study that is not revelation that is trouble you could get information that's in Revelation revelation when the Spirit reveals it I went this web reveals it if conceit confirms it or get the Lord a shout so we're not talking about knowledge we're not talking about intellectual information we're talking about divine revelation that's why the probability's divinely revealed mystery troops not just revealed but divinely revealed not man interpreted not man revealed but divinely revealed when you hear from heaven or glory know God seven thunders will unlock the heaven when they're spoken by revelation revelation to speak this word divine revelation or glory to God please go [Music] I might have three something here for you but I Brandon he's saying here I feel this isn't meant for me I would I feel no you're welcome spirit that you are believer and I want you to come just closer to me I'm not trying to read your mind sir at all you don't believe that do you no cause that would be something that you had on your mind I pray that God will go back and do something that's not even on your mind so you wouldn't know he said no there's something wrong with you no doubt he said you wouldn't have gotten that prayer card you you come here to be prayed for you confess your fate by believing that he would heal you know what I'm trying to do now is speak to you to contact your human spirit your feet you see your feet operate this gift your feet brings it down on me so the Prophet was going down but discernment to activate the faith because the faith is what gonna bring this thing down on him Oh not a one thanks be to Allah Jesus Christ who brought again the Spirit of God and the resurrected Christ who is present tonight to heal all that is in need he is here friends I have no way of bringing him to you only your feet brings him present I want to show you the importance of you having feet sitting there and having the expectation sitting there you're not just going to hear the preacher expand and hear a teacher teach an information you here to be a participant here to get in the spirit we hear they receive from God Peter was one of the disciples but Peter got involved he got caught up somehow he gets in touch channel where the Spirit could drop down upon him and you can set up at the Christ so you could get in that channel because understand this all these diapers were here all of them or call but Peter drop into my channel that the father opened up to him or gets all together sitting in front of you wins but you a new who oh I decided you forget that you are individual revelation doesn't come as a group there's no group revelation or cancel or - oh I want to say that again there is no group it's a personal revelation that Christ has revealed himself to you and Jesus went on further said upon this rock I will build my church before the Democratic show-off the church because he kind of get what's in your heart yo what's in your heart is sealed he cannot go there because only the word could discern the thoughts and intents of that they'd ever kind of discern the intents of your heart or you should be shouting on that one without like that they're rotten listen to see what you're speaking he don't know what's in your heart it's only when you speak he said yeah what'd you say God wasn't given every revelation of the serpent was getting a revelation so when I serpent talk to Eve what did God say oh I don't know he's not talking to me and then he saw it fit to explain and explained and explained and she she still didn't have a revelation because if even a revelation she never explained she will tell that so don't go and ask him yourself because I get it from my husband my husband got the word and when I came for I didn't know nothing about actually my husband reveal that and spoke that and unsold that God said we can eat of every she but not that one so if you want to know what actually go and get the one who revealed that comes in a nut tree go to them that sell go and buy go and get the anointing then you're sitting on just long enough where is the fire where is the oil where is the figs that's what the Prophet came to turn on expect back to the faith because the faith will pull down the power the faith will pull down the fire the faith is not just pork in word for 40 years mechanics only one day we're gonna wake up and said you don't even have to need you know the mechanics one day going to turn a key and when that heat turn you don't have to know knee mechanics we just read in the time and

while were to pray how it overcome blower thirst and power to press but what to get the victory power to do signs and wonders and miracles [Music] [Applause] Laurie what was the word in acts 1:8 you

hallelujah glory to God may be seated when when man fell and Adam you heard it preached over and over when when God lost the whole of Adam Adam losing all of the earth as long as God was in control of Adam I don't get controlling it it's an automatic flow of the current the code was fluent from God to Adam and Adam truly it but once that line was broken and I'm couldn't this dictate to no lion he couldn't speak to no elephant he couldn't all in animals name was it wasn't born with him he was supposed to call them to just as God call Adam he's a lion come and sit down here or suddenly and keep on walking normal normal normal I don't have no power over the lion there's no power the elephant he lost the power and gotta to take back the book and seal it up with seven seals and put seven thunders are all romantic watchin it no man to look upon it the book was sealed the inheritance was sealed the power was sealed and he promised to unseal that power unseal the book that's why we're here tonight because seven seas have been broken and by Holy Ghost hospitals it the church the reproduce looks and intuitive in a prophet in this hour Solomon the Lord the Lord it can sail just gonna be a pride there's gonna be a bride in Trinidad yes we'll be right around the world this won't be a seventh on the revival because I say so no because the prophet prophesied that the bride had another

sleep you're gonna shake off the weary you're gonna shake off the tired they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength even young men shall faint an utterly fall but they that wait upon the Lord mighty that hang on and still there's no wait upon the Lord strength will come back inside on you strength to press strength to push I'm not gonna give up caleb was 80-plus hallelujah he said I

grow all these certain summer autumn winter spring everything passing through but he just did this drawing when I was a child I speak like a child hallelujah because the small plant you can expect that apple tree the small plant to produce any fruit it's too small and they get mature and when you're too small your foot you could produce gotta get big you have to get pacifier you have to get baby stuff but when you become a man that's different no vehicles fruit no go expect something have you [Applause] for mrs. expectancy but a bomb says he said no that's the way tonight many of you here may seem like your your time of deliverance is way away but sometime when it seems the furthest away and the darkest of our that is when you receive help from God there's a whole dishonor in proverb dishonor in proverb which says God help those who help themselves that's an error god help those who can't help themselves if you could help yourself you wouldn't need God's help but God has mercy on those who cannot help themselves God revealed a Simeon that he will not see that until he sees the Lord's Christ it was a divine revelation the dish almond emphasized all anybody forget the drop down and did they want him to sit at home in a rocking chair and he keep going to the temple whether he woke with a crook stick a hawk stick he comedy very Enderby service but he no Messiah have to come to do so he's taken every do know em all you know that only buzzing but can't touch him because he has to see the Christ because he's a revelation he cut produce that to nobody he can put a piece of people sign by God and tell him that this thing is any man any man living on something the action of faith in his hat bring him the service he can forsake the assembling because you don't know when God become suddenly to his temple so he can afford to miss a Wednesday night a Friday night a Sunday is year hallelu is coming because you know one day the court that revealed it would confirm it the court that revealed it will indicated the call that reveal it manifested so you can't stop that brother because he has revelation revelation that water religion is waning what I have no stimulation with it wine has that kind of thing it has Mickey little dizzy it has Mitch a little tipsy it is peculiar happy is making a little excited because it's the wine of Revelation you have something you never don't have go glory to God you're drunk but a new wine Oh give the Lord a shout but a man says Simeon wasn't a shame abyss testimony because the Holy Spirit told him so that's why there's so much a short testimony because there's a short of Revelation because Revelation will give you your testimony oh my what was blind one time Jesus heal a man who is blind and you see an SEC

dissolves materialized cancer begone materialize diabetes disappeared materialize or glory of God hallelujah high blood pressure normalize every Devils being challenged Jesus challenge every mono sickness every man of disease I'm gonna bring him did the same thing no sickness no disease nothing could stand alone we have that prophet and there won't be a prize you prophesied gonna be a super Church he didn't prophesy that the Holy Spirit told him pick up the pen and write that put that dog in the last day is the problem come to the headstone will be a super Church a super is I seen there's the headstone and apparently so much like him there will be in his very image so the image of God will be back on the earth restored first created image these are atoms before we go back to even see unseen atom again but not a fallen one atom again before we go back to Eden Adam again in Satan's Eden and I'm again conquer him again being backed up let us make man and have dominion and Bertram came to reveal what that man consists of and once that man is restored the connection the plugin diploma reconnect back all the wires connect back and there's a main switch that be written on there's a brick and god flip that switch and the power because all the current runway all the Audion lines run right he could flip the switch and then if count for intro yeah is my spirit flowing freely okay the Lord some praise it so no 540 legends the Holy Spirit the would doing some why irony on your life because when we fell all the wiring and plumbing meant of key so we couldn't have that channel of the flow of God and all this gospel to clean and justify and sanctified is the makeup preparation but you could become a channel of God that the spirit could flow through and when God did get a channel he could do so much then Devils can move until they find somebody to move a teeth and spirit upon a man make him a thief murder and spirit come upon a man or cultural spiritual come upon people make them and do a certain thing but when the Spirit of the Lord comes upon my hair I will dance like David dancing I would thin men like something Taconic it and lift it up and put it away where is the Spirit of God was upon Samson the string of gold upon Gideon the spirit upon Jeff died upon Samson upon or upon Moses upon Joshua it was the Spirit of God look Solomon asked for wisdom hope the governor people and gore tell Solomon because you didn't ask for wealth he didn't ask for this and that and I will give you money I will give you wealth because the ask for wisdom and someone
