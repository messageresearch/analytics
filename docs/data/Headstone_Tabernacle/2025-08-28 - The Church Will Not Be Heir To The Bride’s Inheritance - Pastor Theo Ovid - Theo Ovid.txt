Heavenly Father, we thank you for your presence tonight. And I pray that your Holy Spirit would just fill every heart here tonight. Change and transform their walk and talk and they attit towards you, Lord Jesus. Oh God, we love you tonight and we invite you in our presence. We invite you in our midst that you would come Lord and confirm your word with signs and wonders and miracles. Heal the sick and afflicted. Father, may those connected live. May those who would hear the message, may they be inspired to be drawn closer to you. Granted, Father, in Jesus name we ask it. Amen. And amen. May God bless you and welcome. And if you have your Bibles, I like you to turn to Galatians chapter 3. You want to read from 13 to 18 and Galatians chapter 4 verse 27-31. I didn't know I'll be in this tonight, but that's what I got for tonight. And we're going to read from Galatians chapter 3, reading from verse 13. It reads, "Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us. For it is written, cursed is everyone that hangeth on a tree, that the blessings of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ, that we, here we go, might receive the promise of the spirit through faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brethren, I speak after the manner of men, though it be but a man's covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man disanol it or add it there unto. In other words, if man humans make a covenant and confirm it, nobody could acknowledge it or act to it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now to Abraham and to his seed were the promises made. He saith not unto seeds as of many, but as of one, and to thy seed, which is Christ. And this I say that the covenant that was confirmed before of God in Christ the law which was 430 years after cannot disol that it should make the promise of none effect. &gt;&gt; For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more promise. But God giveth to Abraham by promise. &gt;&gt; And let's go over to Galatians chapter 4. We're going to look at verse 27. All right. For it is written, rejoice thou barren that breakkest not, break forth and cry. Thou that travalest not, for the desolate had many more children than she which hath an husband. Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise. But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the spirit, even so it is now. Nevertheless, what saith the scripture? &gt;&gt; Cast out the bond woman and her son, &gt;&gt; for the son of the bond woman shall not be heir with the son of the free woman. &gt;&gt; So then, brethren, we are not children of the bond woman, but of the free. &gt;&gt; May God bless his word. You may be seated. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. We thank God for his word tonight. &gt;&gt; Scriptures and the promises. Now uh Sunday we spoke about now as as that the heir as long as he's a child defth nothing or from a servant though he be lord of all but under two and governors until the time appointed by the father. &gt;&gt; So we see here in this scripture Paul identifying what the heir is to do how the air is to response the respond and what the heir is under. So we find out and we said it that every air must pass through tutors and governors. Now Abraham didn't have one son yet another son through Hagga. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; And that is the church that entwined with the bride. And that is where the two spirits will be so close in the last days. They'll be sitting in the same congregation. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. Never heard that before, right? &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. So every ear must pass through tutors and governance. So all those people that are staying home not going to church and figure this. Some prophets, some teachers, some pastors, some evangelists, some prophets, some teachers, some pastors, some evangelists, not no man said. This is God said that. &gt;&gt; Then he give into the speaking with tongues, interpretation with tongues, knowledge, wisdom, and all kind of miracles. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; But Jesus said, he that receives them that I send receives me. And now them that he sent and then them that received me receive him that sent me. Wish we had time to linger on that. Then he said this word, you can only serve God as you do and believe the servants that God sends. You can only serve God on earth as God's servants that are sent on earth by divine inspiration interpret the word to you. &gt;&gt; That's the way you could only serve God. So God have to send men servants &gt;&gt; and and as they invi divinely interpret the word then they could correctly serve God. &gt;&gt; They that worship him must worship him in spirit &gt;&gt; and in truth. &gt;&gt; So truth have to come forth that you could understand how God ought to be worshiped &gt;&gt; because men does worship and make anything their God. They think they worshiping God. He said in vain do you worship me teaching for doctrines the commandments of men. So you have to hear the word of God from the mouth of God. And God send a prophet that we could get from the mouth. And that's why he said the spirit, the prophet and the bride will say the same thing. And what they say would have already been said in the word. So you have to hear from the mouth of God. Praise God. And the mouth of God is his prophets. Isn't that right? Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. So you can only serve God as you do and believe God's servants that are sent on earth by divine inspiration interpret the word to you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who would President Kennedy be tonight if he wasn't President Kennedy? He was the same man. He if he was a worker that worked in Colgates for $40 a week, he'd come down the street and nobody would pay attention to him, only his own associates. But being he's a president, he deserves respects. And that is because God is God. He deserves respects. &gt;&gt; And you have got to respect him and give fear to him. And that brings respects. And God has demanded that for himself and for all his servants. God demands respects for his servants. And how do we know they are his servants? Because he vindicates these servants by his word. He take these servants and makes them servants of God &gt;&gt; and prove they are servants by making his word work through them servants. &gt;&gt; Then as you respect that servant, you respect God. So when I respect you and you respect me and we respect each other, then we are respecting God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen and amen. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Now today he's alive. Watch. He is still proving himself by his word. He is God. And then this word is allotted here for this day. There's got to be somebody come back. Here we go. That that word can become quickened and make that word live. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the scriptur is laying dormant until somebody step forward &gt;&gt; and that would be quickened &gt;&gt; and that would begin to live. &gt;&gt; So the title tonight is the church will not be heir to the bride's inheritance. &gt;&gt; That's the title. Church will not be heir to the bride's inheritance. &gt;&gt; And now you can see why because the church will be doing their own thing &gt;&gt; and the bride will be under tutors and governance &gt;&gt; until the time appointed by the father. And our type is Queen Esther that was under guidance under the Modai &gt;&gt; that she could get to go in the presence of the king when he didn't call for her. &gt;&gt; But she had faith and confidence because he told her you have to do something. You can't just sit. You can't be in inertia. Praise God. Action is caused. Inertia just happens. And inertia is when you're in the same position all the time. Yeah. Moving. When you continue along a line all the time, you're not moving. But when something and the only way to break that inertia is when something interrupted &gt;&gt; something external &gt;&gt; some force from outside that's why he said the people is not desperate it love should get you desperate if love don't get you desperate conditions will so conditions is the external force to get you out of your lethagi out of your sluggishness out of your laziness out of whatever you in that is what comes from external something happen on the outside that you wasn't catering for &gt;&gt; and it shake you and move you out of the pivot that you're in. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, tomorrow begins our three-day prayer fast as we seek the Lord for a breakthrough and deliverance and healing and everything else. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, let's go. Tonight, the church will not be heir to the bride's inheritance. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; He said the seed of the bond woman Sarah doubted God's word. God was able to keep it. Notice Abraham, do you see what I'm I'll skip. Notice natural. It cannot be neither can the natural be heir with the spiritual. No more can Ishmamail's children be heir with Isaac's children. No more than the carnal can be the air with the spiritual. And I want you to see this tonight. This is something that is really blew up to me. Church natural. Church spiritual. &gt;&gt; There's a church natural and there's a church spiritual. &gt;&gt; And they cannot be hes together. Amen. &gt;&gt; They are two different separate times, two different separate peoples, two different separate covenant. &gt;&gt; And this is the bomb. That is why the rapture is different. &gt;&gt; And will only be for the royal seed of Abraham. &gt;&gt; So now we come to the rapture now &gt;&gt; and the message of when rapture not not so fast. &gt;&gt; Not so fast. It cannot come by the natural carnal seed of the church. &gt;&gt; It will have to be the royal seed of the word of God &gt;&gt; through Abraham. The royal seed. That is why the rapture has to be first. &gt;&gt; So he is putting this rapture as an exclusive bride promise &gt;&gt; an inheritance &gt;&gt; heirs to the rapture. &gt;&gt; Isn't that something else? Amen. &gt;&gt; Then he said, "We are alive and remain shall not hinder them asleep. For the trumpet shall sound, the dead in Christ shall rise. Therefore, they will not be hes together. They will not be in the rapture together." &gt;&gt; This is serious tonight. &gt;&gt; The church natural, the church spiritual, the church carnal, the church spiritual. Now she's this is ahead of bringing it. She is now dry shock. It's the spirit of God passed through her. Yes, &gt;&gt; that is true. So the testimony just like King Saul and brother Isaac preach on it. The rise and fall of King Saul, he have testimony of the witness, testimony of the anointing, testimony of the prophet anointed him. All kind of testimonies. The spirit passed through. &gt;&gt; There's no denial. &gt;&gt; There's no question about the spirit passing through. &gt;&gt; No dispute about that. The spirit of God passed through. He say it's true. And will she will not be air with the vindicated seed word. &gt;&gt; She sure will not be. &gt;&gt; Hear it. She will not be in the rapture. &gt;&gt; That's an absolute term. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So when we talking about son and air, we had to had to see tonight what we are heir to. &gt;&gt; It is your inheritance. &gt;&gt; It is what Jesus died for. &gt;&gt; It is. That's why we in church tonight. This is what we fighting for. Not to go down in a bomb shelter to shelter from the bombs that is coming, but to go in the rapture. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. To get rapturing faith and rapture in grace. Isn't that something? &gt;&gt; What Abraham says she'll not be in the rapture. She'll be a church member. May come up in the second resurrection. Be judged according to what she heard. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Look at those four patriarchs. Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph. Abraham calling Isaac election election. Isaac calling Jacob grace and the perfection. Nothing against him. That was God working its way out. &gt;&gt; And then he titled it what? Luther Wesley Pentecost the capstone. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout tonight. Luther, Wesley, Pentecost, &gt;&gt; the capstone &gt;&gt; and the church and the word become the same thing. &gt;&gt; God working its way out through processes. &gt;&gt; Because when the seed go down in the ground, it doesn't come back out as a seed. &gt;&gt; It come out as a stalk. It going through processes. The life of the seed unfolds through processes. And at the end of the processes it come back to the original seed which has the original life. Oh give the Lord some praises in the house. I am alpha and omega. The alpha and omega is the same. &gt;&gt; The seed in the beginning and the seed in the end is the same. The faith in the beginning and the faith in the ending is the same. Oh give the Lord a shout in the house. And that is why God sent a prophet to turn our hearts back to the original. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So what are you saying belove? &gt;&gt; But Abramham went out in his ministry &gt;&gt; knowing he was going to be rejected. &gt;&gt; So he couldn't God feeling feeling no God they going to love me because &gt;&gt; I'm praying for the sick and they'll be healed. &gt;&gt; I'm opening blind eyes. The deaf is hearing. The dumb is speaking. The dead has been raised up. everybody would love me. &gt;&gt; But a Brandon went through the experience of people saying if you go by that other church, we don't want you. &gt;&gt; He needed sponsorship because he didn't have the money to go here everywhere. And they were trying to manu uh manipulate him from from the sponsorship position. &gt;&gt; One time they tell me you have to go there. He said Lord tell them don't go. They say you have to go because we're paying for you. He said dust say this this whole will crash. Everybody get sick &gt;&gt; because they don't want to be led by the spirit. Amen. &gt;&gt; They want control. &gt;&gt; That is denomination. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The spirit of man behind things. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So this bride wake up now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that that why feel you have to take a seat. You know &gt;&gt; feel you have to go home. You know you have to come tough. &gt;&gt; You have to come a word believer. &gt;&gt; Your feelings got be hurt and somebody hurting you. You get you go get manipulated and lick up. Because the bride in the beginning was the word. &gt;&gt; Then if the bride is taken from the bridegroom, it must be the word also. &gt;&gt; Why must the bridegroom be the word manifested? And I think I preached not years ago. The bridegroom going to be the word manifested, &gt;&gt; not the word talking, not somebody have a spoken book in their hand and somebody playing tape day and night. Word &gt;&gt; manifested. &gt;&gt; But I ask the question, what is the father's business? To fulfill the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; You understand that? &gt;&gt; Jesus understood the father's business. So when he got the spirit upon him, he went and find the scripture &gt;&gt; and said, "This is the father's business. The spirit is upon me. He has anointed me to do this, to do that, to do the other. This is what I'm going to do now." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he said, "This day, what you read here is fulfilled." &gt;&gt; It is quickened to me so I can anoint it to myself. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. And he walk out of there rejected. They put him out, you know, &gt;&gt; they throw him out, you know, they reject the word &gt;&gt; and they will reject the word in the bride. &gt;&gt; Some message ago, I told you the church message people have to reject the bride first before the government come down on them. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Kyifers and all of them, hallelujah, have to reject the Messiah &gt;&gt; before they can bring hurried and sees all the whole bunch of them. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises. No pressure coming in, no pressure coming until the bride become the rejected. &gt;&gt; And to become the rejected, it means you have to become the seed, &gt;&gt; the royal seed. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout. It mean the hot July sun dry ups the shock &gt;&gt; in the message that the seed could get golden brown and dead, right? &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the name of the Lord. Hallelujah. You ready tonight? &gt;&gt; You ready to be bright tonight? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hear the bright tonight. She is smitten from the church. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; From the church body. &gt;&gt; She is smitten with her master. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For the same purpose. &gt;&gt; Because she is the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just as the same as Joseph was smitten from his brethren. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because he was the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus was smitten from his brethren because he was the word. The bride is smitten from the church because she is the word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There is a stages one, two, three. Just exactly &gt;&gt; the word living and in action. &gt;&gt; The Bible bride. &gt;&gt; Not some man-made bride. The Bible bride smitten and afflicted of God. No beauty we should desire. Can't you Pentecostal man see that? If the other was husk and died. If the other stalk had to die. If the tassel had to die, so the husk have to die. Stands alone. &gt;&gt; All of you can't stand alone. You have to stand alone. If you can't stand alone, take the side of the church. &gt;&gt; But the church don't inherit the rapture as inheritance. &gt;&gt; That's only for the bride. &gt;&gt; The bride stands alone like the bridegroom. &gt;&gt; Rejected of man, &gt;&gt; despised and rejected of the churches. &gt;&gt; I wonder if people ready for that. &gt;&gt; Ready for rejection. &gt;&gt; Brotherly kindness. I love you, brother. God bless you. Don't do nothing. You know, &gt;&gt; Jesus was the expression of love. Forgive the prostitute. Forgive the multitude, heal the sick, heal leper, all kind of thing. And they end in the crucify him. &gt;&gt; Week before, hosana, hosana, hosana. &gt;&gt; This is where the bride going to be at. &gt;&gt; The bride stands in that way. What is it? It's his masterpiece. &gt;&gt; Now hear the bum. Hear the bum. It's the word that he can work through, made manifest, rejected. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So we have text and scripture &gt;&gt; but the word have to become you. &gt;&gt; All the scripture Isaiah 61 was laying there all the time you know &gt;&gt; to heal the sick and raise the dead and everything else you know. But when Jesus came &gt;&gt; he was the word &gt;&gt; that God could work through. &gt;&gt; A virgin shall conceive. That was always in the Bible in Isaiah. Nobody can change it. It was always there. But when Mary came, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, &gt;&gt; she was the word &gt;&gt; that he could work through. &gt;&gt; So her birth brought that word to life. &gt;&gt; Now this prophecy, he shall turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the father. You in there. &gt;&gt; Brother man didn't come isolated like isolated behold Elijah. No, he come for a purpose &gt;&gt; to get you. &gt;&gt; God told him, "Go get that bride." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, glory to God. Amen, brother Lindon. &gt;&gt; God told that prophet, "Go get that bride." &gt;&gt; And he can only get that bride by the word &gt;&gt; because it's a word bride. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout in the house. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So, the word that he can work through, made manifest, will be rejected. &gt;&gt; And that ain't happen yet. &gt;&gt; That is about to happen. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Don't look at me like I'm talking about somebody else. I'm talking about you. The word will work through you are not the believer. You know &gt;&gt; the word in you &gt;&gt; is the believer. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Why you think God couldn't trust the Pentecostals? They were gifted men but they didn't have the word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that failed. &gt;&gt; Gifts will fail, &gt;&gt; but the word can't fail. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because the word is what produced character. Because the word is what produced the test. Oh, give the Lord some praises. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They were running with their gifts without the life because the life come by the word and the work came to the prophet &gt;&gt; and they rejected the prophet. &gt;&gt; So they couldn't get the word to produce the character which is the life. So when when God looked down he could only trust William Brandham &gt;&gt; and he give him the king sword. Oh give the Lord a shout. He adopted that son and son that son said other son's coming. &gt;&gt; Oh give the Lord a shout. That son said he was the first one that come to maturity. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. And when everything green, the shock is green and the seed is green. You don't know who is who. But sometime the that grain have to become mature. Oh, glory to God. Mary said, "Be it done unto me according to thy word." But she was only a carrier of the life. &gt;&gt; Jesus was still inside of her. &gt;&gt; Give the Lord a shout. He wasn't mature enough to step out. Glory to God. But one day when he step out, when he step out, Mary become the shock. &gt;&gt; Give the Lord a shout in the house. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. She was the womb that was blocking and covering and protecting the seed. &gt;&gt; That's what the church member there for. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; To test your spirit and to try your heart &gt;&gt; until you become right. &gt;&gt; I don't think I don't think you get that yet. I ain't saying that one again. &gt;&gt; Listen to the TV that one. &gt;&gt; I repeat that one. &gt;&gt; All right. Okay. So, the stalk. Here we go. The tassel and husk never become seed. &gt;&gt; But the life pass through them. &gt;&gt; They have testimonies. &gt;&gt; They have histories. They have types and revelations. Oh, what the Lord do for them and how the Lord used them and and what the Lord all of that. That's fine. &gt;&gt; Amen. But God coming for processes &gt;&gt; because the life pass through it dries up you know &gt;&gt; stalk dry tassel dry leaf dry everything drying you know &gt;&gt; because it come to seed time [Music] &gt;&gt; let's go on at the harvest time &gt;&gt; the seed is back to its original condition &gt;&gt; the bum and must have all the word in order to be seed &gt;&gt; amen I believe in thunders you know what thunders is &gt;&gt; that not that's not the message &gt;&gt; man don't want to say seven give faith &gt;&gt; that's not a New York thing that that in the message &gt;&gt; seven thunders right together &gt;&gt; that that's an American thing that's a New York thing what &gt;&gt; you can find that in the message &gt;&gt; seven thunder wait till them seven thunders utter the voices of that group &gt;&gt; that's in the message &gt;&gt; the bride hand of revival yet it will take them seven thunders &gt;&gt; to give the bride a revive that that you could read at &gt;&gt; Even if a man don't know where the thunder is, he could beat that &gt;&gt; because there's a promise. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout. &gt;&gt; And Abraham's son was a seed of the promise. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So God will separate church and bride by these promises &gt;&gt; because you have to have all the word to be seed. &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on. Come on. Say it again. Say amen. &gt;&gt; You can't take part. You have to have all the word to be deceived. And seven thunders is all the word because the seven t is the capstone revelation of Jesus Christ. The seven ton is what caps the pyramid. The seven ters is the capstone. Oh, give the Lord a shout in the house. Come on, give the Lord some praises. [Applause] Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; At the harvest time, the seed is back to its original condition. &gt;&gt; And must have all the word in order to be seed. &gt;&gt; Can I continue? &gt;&gt; You can't have half a seed. &gt;&gt; It won't grow. &gt;&gt; It's got to be the whole seed. &gt;&gt; And then he go down deeper. It's got to not manifest and say, "I believe in the Bible Holy Ghost. I believe in speaking in tong." That's just part of the seed. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; But in a message they don't even leave that part. &gt;&gt; You understand this part of the Z2? &gt;&gt; We can't say we need message. So we don't need justification. We need message. We don't need sanification. We need message. We don't need the Pentecostal part. &gt;&gt; That's false. &gt;&gt; Because all the parts make up the seed. &gt;&gt; Do you understand now? &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; That's just part of the seed. But now but there is added to that the life &gt;&gt; not the gifts &gt;&gt; the life of the gifts &gt;&gt; we at the end time brethren stalk tassel husk is dead dry now &gt;&gt; yesmen &gt;&gt; and the only thing that happened is to be gathered in the work of the churches all through life here we go that was in the stalk and they had the testimony you could listen it you could read it you could hear it that All true light that was in the stalk, tassel and husk is now gathering in the seed. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Ready for the resurrection. Ready for the harvest. I'm still reading. The alpha has become the omega. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The first come last. The last is first. The seed that went in has come through the process. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And become seed again. That is why there'll be another book of acts. &gt;&gt; That is why there'll be another days of the apostle &gt;&gt; because it's the same seed that was in the beginning is the same seed at the ending. And we will have nothing less than that. Do I hear a shout in the house? Don't tie me down to no message. Nothing. Tie it to the Bible that says if that branch put forth another original branch, we'll have another book of Acts. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout to those. &gt;&gt; Not no message grafted and stuff. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So Luther was the blade &gt;&gt; Abraham. &gt;&gt; Wesley the task Isaac &gt;&gt; Pentecost was the husk to shock Jacob and the fourth was Joseph &gt;&gt; the capstone. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; So the shock comes down to Jacob grace. &gt;&gt; God help me tonight. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So somehow there has to be a transitioning &gt;&gt; out of Jacob grace &gt;&gt; into Joseph perfection &gt;&gt; the capstone word &gt;&gt; the word itself &gt;&gt; you don't want nothing less than being common the word itself &gt;&gt; no excuses &gt;&gt; you could take some more tonight &gt;&gt; of course you could take some more tonight you come here to go home you come here to get something for your soul &gt;&gt; we have more tonight. &gt;&gt; So does the seed. Oh, just like Paul here, did not the seed of the free woman or the bond woman persecute the seed of the free woman? So does the seed of the nomination persecute the genuine grain. So the genuine grain will be under persecution. &gt;&gt; Let me give it how the prophet said it. The bride of the haunted persecuted group. &gt;&gt; Amen. Someone light but that's the word man. Somebody say word. &gt;&gt; Long time I couldn't preach this. It was too heavy. &gt;&gt; What? was heavy for me and all. &gt;&gt; So I touch it. &gt;&gt; The bride will be a haunted persecuted group &gt;&gt; because she's genuine green. &gt;&gt; No bride member looking to torment. No, no church member is them church member. That why said the criticism will be shut. &gt;&gt; The bride criticizing and the critics criticizing. &gt;&gt; Who's the accuser of the brethren? &gt;&gt; Church members. Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible said Lucifer devil devil upon church folks. &gt;&gt; Here we go. So does the seed of denomination persecute the genuine dream. It is always got to be that way. They will not be hes together. &gt;&gt; They are not associated together. They are absolutely two different promises, two different times, two different peoples all together. One is bride and the other is church. &gt;&gt; So let's make it serious tonight. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Just make it serious tonight. No comparison at all. &gt;&gt; Mary was not the seed. She was a carrier of the seed, but she had nurtured and brought forth out of a womb. Just like the shark brought from the womb the real seed. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; Jesus told us in the last day it will be so close it will deceive the very elective possible. But then the seed comes forth from there and the shock the life leaves the shock and the shock is a carrier. &gt;&gt; So do you get it now? &gt;&gt; When the word went down into the ground the seed the life begin to move &gt;&gt; and the stalk was a carrier. The tassel was a carrier. The shock is a carrier. What they carrying? The life where the life getting for the seed &gt;&gt; where the seed going to die &gt;&gt; except a corner weight &gt;&gt; fall into the crown and oh you thought the seed just going rap hold it hold it wait wait wait wait wait you you thought so &gt;&gt; after all this process thing and se what you going do going to kill you &gt;&gt; that see that go and die now &gt;&gt; that your family could get the breakthrough &gt;&gt; that your loved ones can get the breakthrough y stinking rotten flesh fleshly have to die. &gt;&gt; You have to die. God humbled Joseph in that prison. &gt;&gt; Oh, glor God taught Joseph humility. God stripped Joseph. Joseph had to be saved. This big man Joseph with vision and all kind of revelation. God leave him there to hang out until he was ready until the time appointed of the father under tutors and governors under discipline under order. Oh, give the Lord a shout. And all these mysteries and seals is to bring our bodies in order. &gt;&gt; But George, not the kind of message people like to hear. &gt;&gt; They want to hear about conversations in Ukraine and how the gold standard coming back or the US dollar losing power. That guy help me right now. I know. I don't even know what that's supposed to mean. &gt;&gt; India discover a whole ton of gold trying to have tons of gold. How come I never bring gold? &gt;&gt; I better but have to dig in the back of my yard. See if I get gold. But what I'm saying then, we need to know what God promised us. &gt;&gt; We need to conduct the reality that these things have to come alive. &gt;&gt; Somebody with faith anointed to themselves. &gt;&gt; You have to begin to believe with them. When you talk about Bri talking about me then when you talking about Julie he's talking about me then &gt;&gt; I am just as real a manifestation that God promised as brilliant Brandham was as Jesus was. He said you are predestinated seed just like Christ was &gt;&gt; not separate just like Christ was &gt;&gt; you are predestinated seed and if God before you just think about that tonight if God before you forget what your family saying forget what your wife husband saying forget them. If God before you, who can be against you? &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. God for you. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Jesus told us that in the last days it'll be so close. It will see the very less possible. &gt;&gt; But then the seed comes forth from there. &gt;&gt; And the shock, the life leaves the shock. And the shock is a carrier. &gt;&gt; Notice Mary, she was not deceived. She was like a shock, a carrier of part of the word. &gt;&gt; Watch justification was save a man. You believe that? Sure. But it's a carrier of the word. &gt;&gt; Just as I believe in the stalk is part of the wheat. Sure. It's a carrier. It ain't the life. &gt;&gt; Along came sanctification. You believe in sanctification. Then come Pentecost, restoration of the gift, speaking in tongues. They call it initial evidence. When you come and say I and my father are one these are the things then the shock pulls away. But the real genuine bride church will bring forth the entire word of God &gt;&gt; in its fullness &gt;&gt; and in its strength &gt;&gt; for he's the same yesterday, today and forever. &gt;&gt; Oh my hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Notice in the womb of Mary was the seed. &gt;&gt; But when the seed was delivered, he said, I come to do the will of him that sent me. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when brother was talking about Mary and then miss m Miss um Jesus and he come back and and and they found him. They say your father and I he was showing how Mary slip up there &gt;&gt; to say she said in in saying that making a statement she deny his supernatural birth. &gt;&gt; Your father and I was looking all about for you and he straightened that out. &gt;&gt; He said no you not I'm about my &gt;&gt; my father's business &gt;&gt; 12 years old. &gt;&gt; Straight out his mother because I was off the word. Oh, give the Lord some praises. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Notice at the opening of the seven seals, Revelation 10, the full word is to be born into manifestation again &gt;&gt; and vindicated by the spirit of God in the full strength &gt;&gt; as when he was here on earth. &gt;&gt; And the Revelation 10, who came down? &gt;&gt; The Lord himself. &gt;&gt; What did he throw out? Seven thunders out his mouth. What the seven thunders do? Gather the bride together. Not to look for church members. Oh, give the Lord some praises. &gt;&gt; What the seven thunders to do? Give the bride faith. &gt;&gt; What the seven tongs will do? Show her how to prepare. [Music] &gt;&gt; What the seven ts do? Give her a revival. &gt;&gt; Utter his voices. That's the exclusive bride promise. &gt;&gt; Not church members. You're not going to fight that. But this is exclusive bride promise. So when you come here, you come here to hear bright promises. Not bakanal. Bright promises. Not what that church doing. Bright promises. Not who off and who falls. Bright promises. Give the Lord some praises. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm not interested who falls and who off. I want to know if I'm connected to this thing. If this thing is real. If I got the faith to unlock the door because faith is not talk. Faith is the walk. Oh, give the Lord some praises. Glory to God. The works express the faith that is working inside you. &gt;&gt; Here we go. &gt;&gt; The shock has give forth its strength under the seed. &gt;&gt; It went on out. It was a good shock, &gt;&gt; but it serve its time. &gt;&gt; It's the word bride of the word groom. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; The natural seed of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, natural seed Ishmael, seed of Isaac and so forth had to go into the ground &gt;&gt; and this bring out Jesus. &gt;&gt; I mean the shock has to dry &gt;&gt; and the pollen has to dry and everything dies. Well, this blow me out. So that the seed can produce itself. So when you talk about the debt going to hit this message, you see nothing yet. That's the way it has been in every age. &gt;&gt; We see here the true revelation of the true type. There's three woman carriers of the natural seed until the matured into Jesus. He's talking about Hagga, Sarah, Mary, and Jesus. and Sarah, Hagga, Mary were carriers, &gt;&gt; but Jesus was the seed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There are some people who brought you into the message. Nothing wrong in the message. Some don't even believe the message, but they were carriers &gt;&gt; to lead you to the truth &gt;&gt; because you are the seed. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Three women, &gt;&gt; three denominational ages, which must die and dry up just like the shock and so forth to give room for the seed. So the the shock is what hugs the seed, &gt;&gt; protects the seed because the seed is young inside. It's green. &gt;&gt; It can't face the sun. &gt;&gt; The shock is what is doing that. Looks like the green, look like the seed. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; But hear this now. to give room for the seed. The seed cannot get ripe until the shock stalk and leaves are all dry. &gt;&gt; It saps every bit of the life in them out. All of it is that plus &gt;&gt; now it is sea time. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It is bright time. &gt;&gt; The shocks are dead. &gt;&gt; The shocks are dried up. The virgin word time, not touch. It's a virgin. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Not touch. And then he said this. But it will be it it can't be a denomination. It won't be a virgin because it will be manhandled. God's church is not touched by denomination. &gt;&gt; So God will ensure that somehow this bride is not be manhandled. &gt;&gt; God will manhandle them out of the different groups and churches &gt;&gt; that man ain't going to have the hand on them. &gt;&gt; Man go manipulate and control this bride. This are no Nick Nimrod trying to build some tower to go to heaven with his interpretation. This is a revelation that was bought by Malachi 4 as that elaza to go get that bride. &gt;&gt; That's why the Bible say the spirit and the bride say come. Oh give the Lord some praises. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. It's a virgin born word of God made manifest. Jesus Christ is saying yesterday, today and forever. There will be no get this bomb. There will be no denominational manhandling in the virgin birth of the bride. &gt;&gt; She is commanded by God to come out as such. And God will pull them out of every church, every fellowship, every denomination, every interpretation. He said, "The bride will follow the life wherever it goes." &gt;&gt; Glory to God. You hear that? &gt;&gt; The bride will follow the life wherever it goes. &gt;&gt; Because the life is the word. The life is the spirit. The word is the spirit. The word is the oil. The oil is the spirit. Oh, give the Lord a shout in the house. And the extra oil is what taking the bride to the rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This is good. &gt;&gt; Got to burn them. The life that come through Luther is what made Wesley. &gt;&gt; The life that come out of Wesley is what made Pentecost. &gt;&gt; The life that comes out of Pentecost makes the wheat. &gt;&gt; But they are carriers. &gt;&gt; The real life goes through there. The message goes through, but it is heading up to the wheat. &gt;&gt; That's the reason the wheat comes up and brings the whole thing in the rapture. Amen. &gt;&gt; At the top &gt;&gt; the bride itself comes out of each age. But the denominational stalk dies, dries up and dies. Have you noticed this last day? It begin to pull away. Now when the wheat begins to grow, the shock begins to get away from it. &gt;&gt; So you just have to grow and mature &gt;&gt; and the shock will just pull away &gt;&gt; because you are on the word now. &gt;&gt; You're not on gossiping. You're on the word now. &gt;&gt; You're on sanctification. You're on the word now. You're on behavior. Yes. &gt;&gt; It's a powerful quote, but I'm talking about the preacher and he's talking about his behavior and conduct brought him to another office. &gt;&gt; Not the sermon, &gt;&gt; not the teaching, &gt;&gt; but his behavior and conduct. &gt;&gt; Promoted him to another office. &gt;&gt; Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, when the wheat begins to grow, the shock begins to pull away. He said, "Look back at a little weed. Pull it open and look and see. Got a little bud inside of there. It's way back in there. It started growing. Now the shock." Here we go. Has to be there. So you can't fight the shock and say, "God, no. No. Wait. Take it easy. Take your time. Slow down. The shock has to be there to shelter that &gt;&gt; to give it a chance to get out. But when it begins to grow and the message begin to spread, then the shock pulls away &gt;&gt; and the life goes right out of that shock. &gt;&gt; There's what brother Isaac was talking about with the rise and fall of King Saul. &gt;&gt; All the testimonies there, the blessing is there, the witness is there, he prophesy and everything else. But then afterwards, what happened? Under instructions that he might obey, he failed. The life left him. &gt;&gt; Still on the throne, &gt;&gt; but life already gone. &gt;&gt; All right. The life goes right out of that shock and goes right into the wheat. That's the way each age does. All right. We going good. Notice how much more the real thing Mary was like the shock. The shock hugs the seed, protects it, &gt;&gt; nurtures it until it is standing alone mature. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; A heir, a child &gt;&gt; is under tutors and governors &gt;&gt; until it becomes mature. &gt;&gt; So as long as you a babe in Christ, a babe in the faith, God have to put you under tutors and governors until you be mature &gt;&gt; to handle the responsibility that God want to give you &gt;&gt; because God didn't give it a warm bench, church bench. God have responsibility for you. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? So watch now. So this church age of Pentecost matured holding this grain until it's time to open up the shock. Mary was just a incubator. Let's get down. And that's the way with people who profess Christ. Many of them look like Christians, try to act like Christians, but you got to have Christ on the inside of you, &gt;&gt; which is the word made manifest or it will never mature into a real Bible believing Christian. &gt;&gt; Praise God. A egg cannot hatch. It rots on the nest if it's not with the bird. It has to be with the male bird. Like church members, you can baby them, call them, make them deacons, everything else have a nest full of rotten eggs unless they have meeted with the meat. &gt;&gt; Carrier the shock. It neuted it. That's right. Then that is the seed itself has to leave the shock or the shock has to leave the seed to get the seed in the presence of the sun so it can be ripened. The objective of God before you die. &gt;&gt; You can't bury a green seed. &gt;&gt; The seed had to get right. &gt;&gt; For the seed to get right, the shock have to pull back. &gt;&gt; And for the shock to pull back, you have to become immature. Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus had 30 years of hard trials &gt;&gt; and three and a half years of &gt;&gt; harder trials. This is me tonight. This is words. &gt;&gt; This is not this not KFC and burger and thing late in the night. This is words, sir. &gt;&gt; 30 years of hard trials. Three and a half years of &gt;&gt; harder trials. Why? If you bring forth fruit, he does what? &gt;&gt; He purge and prune for it to bring more fruit. &gt;&gt; And he want much fruit. &gt;&gt; So as soon as he start to bear, he said to come with the clipper. Ouch. Yes. He come with the clipper. People don't want to be clipped. &gt;&gt; They don't want to be cut. &gt;&gt; Let me put it back in the message. They don't want to be honed. Amen. &gt;&gt; So somebody who don't want to be under tutors and governors, they don't want a correction. They don't want instructions. They don't want to be honed because God will hone you by the word. &gt;&gt; Because remember after brotherly kindness, I can't go into it tonight. You are called out of brotherly kindness age &gt;&gt; into that Holy Spirit slot &gt;&gt; to be fitted in that slot. &gt;&gt; That slot is the capstone. That slot is the Holy Ghost itself. &gt;&gt; He said on top of that is Christ corporal body. Beneath him is the spirit of Christ to manifest the virtues. &gt;&gt; So the spirit is under Lov corporal body. Under that have the Holy Ghost and then they get brotherly kindness. He has to call you out because he came at the end of the reason age &gt;&gt; to call that bride out into the bride age. So that bride age is the Holy Ghost to call you out of what you're in into the Holy Ghost That means we have to believe in the spirit of man which is Luther and Wesley that come across into the message. Spirit of man into the message to get into the Holy Ghost slot where we be guided by the Holy Ghost itself. &gt;&gt; And the first thing these demons try to do is to cancel sovereignity of the local church &gt;&gt; for the bishop to take over. &gt;&gt; Trying to anull the sovereignity of the local church that the local pastor can't have guidance from God to do what he do. You had to have some headquarters to get direction from. &gt;&gt; But the bride-elect rejects that. &gt;&gt; No headquarters. &gt;&gt; The only headquarters is of heaven. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Christ is the head of the body called the church. Not some man in Jessville, America, South America, wherever they are from, Africa. It doesn't matter from Trinidad. &gt;&gt; Christ is the head of the body &gt;&gt; called the church. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. So the chuck nurture it has to give uh to leave the seed to get the seed in the presence of the sun so it can be ripened. Now when the shock comes forth out of the grain a blade of grain I'll skip that. Now the grain comes forth from that. Now remember there is no more after that shock. All right here we go. Notice he's come back again. Matthew 24:24. There's two spirits in the last days. I want to get to this. We're almost done. &gt;&gt; The church spirit. of the church people &gt;&gt; and the bride spirit of the bride people would be so close till it will deceive the elected if it was possible &gt;&gt; so the church people have a church spirit &gt;&gt; watch that &gt;&gt; the bright people have a bright spirit &gt;&gt; so therefore this this inheritance of divine love this tremendous victory the church can't inherit that &gt;&gt; I'll show you why. &gt;&gt; 2 Timothy 3. This is the church spirit. There's no in the last days perilous of time shall come. This is people with books and tapes. &gt;&gt; This is people in this tabernacle and this fellowship and what this is them here. And the pastor some of them ooling them alone to become more like this. For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient parents, unthankful, unholy. You would think this is unbelievers, right? Without natural affection, truth breakers in church. Force accusers. I'll see it in church. Incontinent in church. Fierce, still in the church. Despisers of those that are good, still in the church. traitors, &gt;&gt; heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God, having a form of godliness &gt;&gt; in the message, &gt;&gt; but denying the power thereof &gt;&gt; from such turn away. For this is the sort that they creep into houses and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away by diverse lust, ever learning, and never be able to come to null of the truth. Now as dance and damage withtood Moses, so these resist the truth, men of corrupt minds, reparate concerning what? The fate, but they shall proceed no further. For their folly shall be manifest unto all men as theirs also was. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Thank you, Jesus. I'm almost done. Music, come up, please. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Somehow I leave out something. This is it. Notice the life that was in the husk, in the stalk, in the tassel. All gathers up in the seed. &gt;&gt; And the life that was in the stalk went on to make the other. Justification made a way for sanification. Sanctification made a way for the bapt Holy Ghost. and the baptism Holy Ghost made a way for the Holy Ghost itself to come right down in perfection back to the word again. &gt;&gt; If this be so, how the message will reject justification when justification is the channel or the carrier or the means by which you get to sanification. How could you reject sanctification when that's the means to get to the Bible Holy Ghost and the Bapt Holy Ghost is the means to get the Lord yourself. He said the dynamics of this church &gt;&gt; will be a refilling &gt;&gt; of the Holy Ghost that they have worked in a small measure. &gt;&gt; So God have to give a measure to work with &gt;&gt; until this thing come down. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We'll be a super race, a super church as we near the headstone. &gt;&gt; So as we near the headstone, some kind of thing will be coming down to get us active, activated, motivated. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You see that? I know I missed something. I had to go right back to it. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. We're going to close. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; My my my [Music] &gt;&gt; glory. You going to play something? Luther went to hospital. The first word to just shall live by faith. Wesley had two words sanification. Second book of grace. Pentecostal has a third word, restoring of the gifts. But the entire seed has to come. &gt;&gt; They're denominated on one word, another word, another word. Listen to this now, saints. There's got to be something that cannot be denominated. &gt;&gt; You know what it is? He say it's the entirety of the life. [Music] &gt;&gt; There have been no unity on doctrine. There's no way we can see eye to eye on everything. &gt;&gt; But you see the life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It thunders. [Music] &gt;&gt; The devil recognizes it. &gt;&gt; Paul, I know the bride. I know. &gt;&gt; He recognizes the life. When Peter Bar says when they were in the upper room and they were staging and whatnot and the angels from hell went down and said, "Listen, they're having a good time up there. Nobody there. is having excitement. That was the interpretation. &gt;&gt; They just excited, emotional, they acting wild, something off for them. They're not in the message. That's fine. But when Peter told that man, "Silver and gold have I none. Such as I have I give it unto you. Rise up and walk." &gt;&gt; But Abbrand said, the devil said, we have to stop that. &gt;&gt; That is not excitement. That's a literal manifestation &gt;&gt; of Jesus Christ again. &gt;&gt; We thought we'd kill him. &gt;&gt; We thought he was finished, &gt;&gt; but we seen his life reproduce again. &gt;&gt; That was a reproduction of the original grain. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout. Brother Bam, he lived a life. God vindicated his ministry, confirmed the word that he spoke and he prophesy that there'll be another reproduction of the original grain. It will be original life because it will be brought by the original seed. In closing, there's got to be something that cannot be eliminated. It's the entirety of the life that's in there has to produce itself again on a bride. &gt;&gt; There cannot be any more churches after this. We are the end, brothers and sisters. We are here. We have arrived. Thanks be to God. May the Lord bless you tonight. Could we just stand and worship the Lord and give the Lord some praises? Father God, bless your people tonight. You'll give us a word for them that they'll recognize that the bride, the the the the elect lady, that seed will not be able to shock, &gt;&gt; but they're going to have an inheritance of the rapture of the millennium of the wedding supper of the new Jerusalem of that city built before Square.
