[27:17] widow in that city and she came unto him
[27:20] saying avenge me a man Visser II and he

[27:26] within himself do I fear not God nor
[27:29] regard man yet because this Widow
[27:32] trouble at me I will avenge her lest by
[27:35] her continual coming she weary me and
[27:39] the Lord said hear what unjust judge see

[27:47] elect which cry day and night unto him
[27:50] though he bear long with him I tell you
[27:54] that he will avenge them speedily
[27:55] nevertheless 1 when the son of man
[27:58] commits she shall he find faith on the
[28:01] earth and from revelations up to 22
[28:04] verse 10 he saith unto me seal not the
[28:08] sayings of the prophecy of this book for
[28:11] the time is at hand
[28:13] he that is unjust let him be unjust
[28:14] still he which is filthy let him be
[28:17] filthy still he that is righteous let
[28:19] him be righteous still he that is holy
[28:21] let him be holy still
[28:23] I me who like come quickly my reward is
[28:26] with me to give every man according as
[28:28] his work shall be
[28:29] I'm Alpha and Omega the beginning and
[28:31] the end the first and the last
[28:33] blessed the data do His commandments
[28:34] that they may have right to the Tree of
[28:37] Life and may enter in through the gates
[28:39] of the city for with out are dogs and
[28:42] sorcerers and whoremongers and murderers
[28:44] and idolaters and whosoever love it
[28:48] and make it a light I Jesus have sent
[28:50] mine angel to testify unto you these
[28:53] things in the churches
[28:55] I'm the root and the offspring of David
[28:57] and the bright and Morning Star and the
[29:00] spirit and the bride say come at him the
[29:03] heareth say come let him that the test
[29:05] come and whosoever will let him take the
[29:08] water of life freely may God bless his
[29:09] word you may be seated or praise the
[29:12] Lord
[29:13] amen you got a beer tonight it's good to
[29:17] be here tonight always good and always a
[29:20] blessing and a privilege to come into
[29:22] the house of God oh my as time on for
[29:27] you would see how God has been gracious
[29:29] to us to give us his opportunity all
[29:32] these years to come into his house to
[29:34] hear his word amen so I'm a titled
[29:38] tonight seal not the sayings of the
[29:40] prophecy that's the title seal not the
[29:43] sayings of the prophecy for a message
[29:46] feet but a Brannon 1953 he was saying
[29:51] listen God bless you I want to tell you
[29:52] one thing I know I'm holding long but I
[29:55] just want this wonderful thing I want
[29:57] you to remember there is something
[29:59] fixing to happen now remember I told you
[30:03] that there was a step up coming in the
[30:07] church now these things that you're now
[30:10] seeing are going to be just little
[30:12] things after a while something is moving
[30:16] so he was prophesying of this to pull of
[30:20] the power he was prophesying
[30:21] and I say this listen by the power of
[30:24] the
[30:25] volition of Jesus Christ whom I he said
[30:31] everyone in our doctrine in our baptism
[30:35] we have come to a place but there is
[30:37] some key that will unlock something here
[30:42] so he knew he has the word doctrine
[30:47] teaching presence signs and wonders but
[30:50] is a key to unlock something here no he
[30:54] saw the book sealed on seven seals and
[30:59] when Daniel saw the scene and when the
[31:02] Tundra's utter the voices he said on
[31:04] right that what was that in the
[31:07] scripture but it'll reveal in the last
[31:09] days we are at the time we are chemists
[31:12] right now so he was seeing that these
[31:15] thunders is connected but crossing over
[31:17] to the other side and we know later on
[31:20] he says open up the seals in the back of
[31:22] the book that we could cross over so he
[31:25] knew that the seven thunders was
[31:27] connected to the key to unlock the power
[31:29] so that's why the Prophet says is this
[31:32] the mystery of the thunders that will
[31:33] bring back a power back to the church
[31:35] and you see now the great need for power
[31:38] in the church not torque power not
[31:42] teachings power not big big evangelists
[31:46] we're talking about power the power of
[31:49] God back in the church because this is
[31:51] what is promised do you believe that do
[31:55] you believe that all glory to God
[31:57] we had Kay wish right now yeah few
[32:00] nights I went across the burn of libbets
[32:01] over the Paducah Kentucky crossed into
[32:04] Evansville but a boss what wasn't me I
[32:06] said it's just kept burning on my heart
[32:08] a message and I know that something God
[32:13] has promised on the opening up of the
[32:17] power and yet I'm waiting no for him so
[32:22] this is real the power have to open up
[32:25] something after turn the key to open up
[32:28] this power then he talked about a vision
[32:31] here he said I walk around cleared my
[32:33] throat and he looked at me this is beau
[32:36] Jesus raise up his hands I
[32:37] feinted didn't come till next morning I
[32:40] have an idea what he looks like
[32:42] I've been feeling for the last months
[32:44] I'll see him again
[32:45] pretty soon that he revealed something
[32:49] that's fixing to come forward
[32:50] oh brother if I have it right God
[32:52] forgive me if I'm wrong but seen it in
[32:54] the scripture
[32:55] seeing that he arose I send it up he
[32:57] received a new name that no man know
[32:59] then I see him coming in his power so
[33:02] everything is tied together it shall be
[33:04] revealed understand this new name new
[33:06] walk new life something of the turn so I
[33:10] want to challenge you tonight that you
[33:12] on the prophecy or glory that God great
[33:16] things are still fixing to happen or
[33:19] going don't be weary or glory to God
[33:22] beyond the expectation that woman having
[33:25] an expectation that one that became
[33:27] before the unjust judge she had an
[33:29] expectation of hearing her case or glory
[33:32] that God she had that expectation and
[33:34] the judge was unjust here fear God he a
[33:37] fear man but wouldn't it coming she keep
[33:40] coming because she wanted to get her
[33:43] expectation fulfill Oh glory to God and
[33:47] God put that parable to set it up to
[33:50] show you the quality of perseverance but
[33:53] you have to have in believe in the
[33:56] prophecy that has to be fulfilled
[33:58] William Brennan is not here he is
[34:01] written on us to call him up or glory
[34:04] that God he can do nothing at this point
[34:06] in time but God is risen in you and I
[34:10] believe that God is waiting on you and I
[34:13] to come into position to come into a
[34:17] place Oh hallelujah so he said now watch
[34:21] me on the verge brother somebody come
[34:23] back from Kenan the grapes are good it

[57:02] on their shoulders matching true they're
[57:04] just singing the Jubilee song they had
[57:07] evidence they could prove it was a good
[57:09] man
[57:09] they brought back and give all a journal
[57:11] grip if they wanted one of the coaster a
[57:14] bunch of grapes no Joshua and Caleb when
[57:17] they heard the murmur of the people call
[57:20] them fellas historic sofas now them able
[57:23] to talk the spirit of negatives and on
[57:26] darkness and doubts over the people
[57:29] there are leaders very so-called 500
[57:34] fools who ever fool inside but they are
[57:38] the elders when they breed their
[57:40] prophecy over the people it was weak at
[57:45] a kit that's anointed upon the people
[57:48] the people didn't go in on these men
[57:50] were supposed to represent the people
[57:52] bring back evidence to the people the
[57:54] people in know what I mean like whenever
[57:56] fellows come back at your hands if you
[57:58] see them sighs I take a picture of it
[58:01] yes look look up it child I had my
[58:03] foolin our take a picture of it
[58:07] this human and I'm zooming out never say
[58:10] die so big
[58:11] never CV so big and never City it so big
[58:14] it was so big it is to make it a bigger

[58:24] pictures at all them I don't have a
[58:27] picture taken them have grapes eaten
[58:30] them partaken of the evidence of the
[58:33] land so when I'm coming looking happy
[58:36] happy if everybody in a dead mood and
[58:38] you know when something going off you
[58:40] know people are not kind of DS so they
[58:44] came back here it can be done it can be
[58:46] done
[58:46] Caleb I'm reading run-ons and I miss of
[58:49] the people and I'm I said yes it can be
[58:52] Joshua stood by him I said certainly it
[58:55] can be God has given it to us 10 minutes
[59:02] us on this side and two on this side
[59:07] which we do who believe them 10 Rascals
[59:11] they supposed to know them is to all how
[59:16] one man one a quorum she can hang all
[59:18] the bodies seem testimony we can take it
[59:20] we can take ice but a branding nice then
[59:26] we can take it here so cool then how do
[59:32] you see spoke up except better for the
[59:34] sea smoky sissies you want to get the
[59:37] seals if you here big eye open big big
[59:40] big like if you you acting for some
[59:41] complex thing you want it you want the
[59:51] plugin able to take that plug when you
[59:53] plug in a socket sue to get that in the
[59:55] city coming true
[59:58] seals but that is what belong to us
[1:00:03] Adam had the book and it was sued I
[1:00:05] don't watch the prophesied to pull you
[1:00:08] out and I'm filled the book rent in the
[1:00:11] hands an original owner so when the book
[1:00:15] come down prophecy had to come back or
[1:00:17] to call you because God bringing it back
[1:00:19] to original so when Jesus came he said
[1:00:22] you had to be born of the word and the
[1:00:23] spirit to bring it back to Adam again
[1:00:25] where we fell from Jesus come to correct
[1:00:28] that and bring it back to word and
[1:00:29] spirit mechanics and dynamics so they
[1:00:32] remember around bought the book he
[1:00:33] brought all the names was in him so when
[1:00:36] he spoke about his Lord all the names I
[1:00:38] know he gonna have a faithful minister
[1:00:40] to call the last set of names book going
[1:00:47] to be in son calling names how the
[1:00:52] spirit and the bride say come
[1:00:57] go glory to God the voice of God will be
[1:01:01] in her isn't that the prophecy the voice
[1:01:05] of God will be in the pride or glory she
[1:01:09] will speak for God Oh hallelujah
[1:01:13] the Spirit will give her a voice or
[1:01:16] glory of God because the Lobos have to
[1:01:18] be a living voice but speak the Living
[1:01:21] Word Oh glory to God not a living word
[1:01:25] therefore the bride of the beginning
[1:01:27] spirit for it to become living world
[1:01:30] why period spit these words the Holy
[1:01:34] Ghost fell upon them that heard the word
[1:01:38] because he was speaking living word
[1:01:41] Norville's word Oh glory to God he was
[1:01:47] in the body life was flowing to the body
[1:01:50] and the prophet prophesied will happen
[1:01:53] again or give the Lord a shout full C
[1:01:57] term being loosed from the body by
[1:02:01] spoken word original seed coming alive
[1:02:06] Oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:02:10] or blow it over a member a family hmmm
[1:02:13] amen
[1:02:14] watch this watch this yeah the disciples
[1:02:18] under-promise receive it Holy Ghost that
[1:02:21] is when the upper one wait and then if I
[1:02:24] FL but notice what happened after if I I
[1:02:26] fell upon them dr. Sen for Peter their
[1:02:31] telco Nina's gone wait in the upper room
[1:02:33] no no no cop Cornelius is ready
[1:02:36] he is ripe no god of agents and the
[1:02:39] earth knowledge God reproduce again in
[1:02:42] the natural ministry come to perfection
[1:02:44] no these guys are channels of
[1:02:46] communication for inspiration to flow
[1:02:49] true there becomes cod cells or glory to
[1:02:52] God cords voice God thunders or chlorine
[1:02:56] ago when God pander to them something
[1:02:58] has to take place because the voice of
[1:03:00] God is a panda so when Peter went to the
[1:03:03] house of Cornelius
[1:03:04] he was pummeling or glory or different
[1:03:06] voices well glory record and corners
[1:03:09] were sealed by the Holy Ghost he was
[1:03:13] filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:03:15] what got away to the upper room for
[1:03:17] Cornelius headed by the word oh go get
[1:03:21] the Lord a show
[1:03:23] okay the Lord a shout we're going to
[1:03:26] call some sons aside I put them into the
[1:03:29] family and Oh glory to God hallelujah we
[1:03:36] on the verge of it friends

[1:03:41] why Joshua and Caleb could be like that
[1:03:44] what a rank of the answer right here
[1:03:46] what was it they were positionally born
[1:03:49] in Christ positionally they had a
[1:03:54] knowledge of the word and the word
[1:03:56] became manifested so then guys was
[1:03:58] completely different from the
[1:04:00] rezidentura guys
[1:04:01] oh good lord have mercy are you with me

[1:05:39] will take more than what they had then
[1:05:41] to go to know but we have to start there

[1:19:24] and there was nothing good mining he was
[1:19:26] really a bad case and Jesus cross on
[1:19:28] that the Ghaderi he was so even not the
[1:19:30] man the man was alright it's not the man
[1:19:33] when you see a person like that don't
[1:19:35] ever think it's the man it's the devil
[1:19:37] that's in the man then the maniac and
[1:19:40] the platform that night was going to
[1:19:41] kill me in Oregon when I 20 count to me
[1:19:43] him spit into my face calling me snake
[1:19:46] in the grass before nearly 10,000 people
[1:19:47] it wasn't a man he's a man that eats and
[1:19:50] drinks and sleeps but who the family
[1:19:52] loves and like you and I am but that was
[1:19:55] the devil in him doing that and you
[1:19:57] never cast a devil out by the wrong
[1:19:59] attitude it takes love to do that
[1:20:02] and love is the most powerful force
[1:20:04] there is in the world when I say here at
[1:20:07] when I say yella hallelujah hallelu of
[1:20:10] is the most powerful force when I say
[1:20:13] here most powerful force or glory to God
[1:20:16] hallelujah Amen now if you notice the
[1:20:21] devil is always heat it is of the devil
[1:20:25] let's go wrong with a binoculars no and
[1:20:28] when people hit someone
[1:20:31] remember it's a terrible devil to
[1:20:33] despise or dislike you mustn't do that
[1:20:37] so when your blood can't take this one
[1:20:39] you need a blood transfusion
[1:20:42] you need to blood of Jesus so dislike
[1:20:45] and hit and you can take this one dies
[1:20:48] issues that you have see any other care
[1:20:51] about your system you mustn't do that
[1:20:54] this is about a brown-nose there's a
[1:20:56] whole lesson this question an answer
[1:20:57] soon that's a question answer is there's
[1:20:59] some stuff inside that is why bring it
[1:21:00] on Jesus and I he said let me continue
[1:21:02] no no remember Jesus said in a sermon
[1:21:04] when you pray our Father
[1:21:06] who art in heaven when he come down he
[1:21:09] said if you don't from your heart
[1:21:10] forgive every man his trespasses neither
[1:21:12] your heavenly Father forgive you your
[1:21:13] trespasses
[1:21:14] you mustn't do that now where the devil
[1:21:16] creates a power of hatred to run out on
[1:21:19] the platform to kill me which he
[1:21:21] physically was more than able many times
[1:21:24] he could have held me up past with two
[1:21:25] fingers like mine a belt because he
[1:21:27] weighed 261 somebody pawns six foot and
[1:21:30] a half seven foot tall great fellow he
[1:21:32] just hit a pitch along the street with
[1:21:33] his fists broken collarbone and jaw
[1:21:35] injured him put him in hospital he hated
[1:21:38] preachers so he ran out there to kill me
[1:21:40] no and so on
[1:21:42] okay we'll continue you know now in that
[1:21:45] man that was of those spirits was cast
[1:21:48] on this finan Ghaderi
[1:21:49] some of those poor people are out there
[1:21:51] remember remember Devil's birthday
[1:21:53] Devils always live and there will be a
[1:21:56] time when Devils will have to die they
[1:21:58] will become totally undeleted but now
[1:22:01] they are live and they work from
[1:22:03] generation to generation upon human
[1:22:06] beings some of them in the form of
[1:22:08] cancer some of them involve epilepsy
[1:22:11] some of them form of tuberculosis they
[1:22:13] get into the flesh but seemingly they
[1:22:15] are powerless until they get into a
[1:22:17] prison or glory of God they have to
[1:22:21] operate you a person which brings us to
[1:22:24] another thought and the Holy Spirit
[1:22:28] covers the earth but is almost helpless
[1:22:31] until it gets into you and to me
[1:22:34] God is dependant on you and I the Holy
[1:22:39] Spirit the earth is full of the Spirit
[1:22:41] of God
[1:22:41] it's poured out but it cannot operate
[1:22:44] until it comes into us we human beings
[1:22:49] are operated or give the Lord a shout Oh
[1:22:53] hallelujah
[1:22:54] solo what but whatever mom says the word
[1:22:58] was invisible until it became flesh then
[1:23:01] they will become visible Oh hallelujah
[1:23:04] so he said it's so powerful he said God
[1:23:07] is depend upon you and I it is full of
[1:23:10] the Spirit of God it's poured out kind
[1:23:12] of operate until it comes into us we
[1:23:14] human beings operate so all these
[1:23:16] mysteries
[1:23:18] all these great revelations well
[1:23:19] Thompson is to get us out of the way
[1:23:21] that the Spirit of God would have
[1:23:24] actually have the preeminence 'as which
[1:23:26] fulfills the second fall of the great
[1:23:28] mystery of God the first followers who
[1:23:30] reveal himself the second part was to
[1:23:33] have the three eminences and the third
[1:23:34] part was to restore back Eden or glory
[1:23:37] look also when God could find a man and
[1:23:40] he said there is my spirit flowing
[1:23:42] freely
[1:23:42] that man is blown out he have no self in
[1:23:46] there you have no pride India he has no
[1:23:48] aim and everything scared out there like
[1:23:50] a flow freely so the devil wants to take
[1:23:56] us over to operate under him so he gets
[1:24:00] in a mild form he starts in sin if he
[1:24:03] can hold them just in a righteous man a
[1:24:05] good man I let him go ahead and try to
[1:24:07] be good like that if he can hold him
[1:24:09] until he is dead that's what he wants to
[1:24:11] do he's got him because no matter how
[1:24:13] righteous you are how good you are home
[1:24:16] all you are how clean you are how honest
[1:24:18] you are you will never get the helm
[1:24:19] until you are born again so the devil
[1:24:23] don't mind holding them holding them
[1:24:24] holding until they did I know they can't
[1:24:27] make it
[1:24:31] nobody path back to a question the
[1:24:33] spirits the window that man - like a
[1:24:34] maniac does the same thing in people
[1:24:36] today is them spirits thousand time
[1:24:38] Towson's and the devil coming with opium

[1:24:42] to do get her to smoke a cigarette
[1:24:44] that gets us started the next thing is a
[1:24:46] stronger end up with marijuana and then
[1:24:49] the real dope habit

[1:24:55] cigarettes that's his little mind form
[1:24:56] he sees you're pretty smart you're going

[1:28:40] tell him I truly enough to dress with
[1:28:41] explaining things just get piece of that
[1:28:43] you know and he said you cause
[1:28:44] impersonations then I started weeping I
[1:28:46] look took the string was trying to treat
[1:28:49] it out he looked at me and I wondered
[1:28:51] what he was going to do he said keep
[1:28:54] your line straight in these kind of
[1:28:55] times so yes so I cut the line right
[1:28:57] through again and just as I did at that
[1:28:59] time he take me up all again and he
[1:29:02] stood me up in the air over agreed order
[1:29:05] to him or tent and I mean an altar call
[1:29:08] and hundreds of people Reeve softly
[1:29:10] sweetly were weeping setting by the
[1:29:12] altar receiving the Lord Jesus and I
[1:29:14] said that looks better and then there
[1:29:16] was a nice smooth spoken gentleman step
[1:29:18] that I said no wild but a brand is
[1:29:20] rested a little bit with line up the
[1:29:22] fair line you all with prayer cards
[1:29:24] beginner at a sitting line to my right
[1:29:26] so I stood looked and I could see to my
[1:29:30] left from where I was standing there was
[1:29:32] a little building sitting there a little
[1:29:34] building built like that and the people
[1:29:36] here look like they went around the tent
[1:29:39] and and then I seen a woman in the
[1:29:42] almond stretcher was lean and a man
[1:29:44] behind her was standing on the crutches
[1:29:45] and they were standing there waiting for
[1:29:48] their turn and there was a lady taking
[1:29:51] down their names and things and then
[1:29:52] there was a canvas stretched that no one
[1:29:54] could get her wrong that tent and I
[1:29:56] wanted to watch this and listen to how
[1:29:57] it is now and watch the difference and I
[1:30:00] heard that always goes every time we
[1:30:03] have a healing service that's what
[1:30:05] happened was that's the wait always song
[1:30:07] did song like like like we in the bush
[1:30:09] when I did it it always been that way
[1:30:11] and I felt it I heard it rather moving I
[1:30:14] looked and there was a soft light moving
[1:30:17] away from me and went down and went into
[1:30:20] that little building so the light went
[1:30:23] into that little building and there was
[1:30:25] something different between the light
[1:30:27] and the angel because he was still there
[1:30:29] with me and the light that went into the
[1:30:31] building and this angel still speaking
[1:30:34] behind me which is a big man
[1:30:35] he said I will meet you India and I said
[1:30:39] I don't understand why I and there he
[1:30:41] said watch I'm this woman when she come
[1:30:43] out of this unbalanced stretcher she was
[1:30:45] pushing the stretch on the other side
[1:30:47] and the lady asked her what happened she
[1:30:49] said I don't know it just happened I've
[1:30:51] been on the stretcher I've been on his
[1:30:53] bed for years and here come the man
[1:30:55] packing his crutches and they asked him
[1:30:57] what he didn't know he was commented a
[1:30:59] platform that testified I don't
[1:31:02] understand it there so they were passed
[1:31:04] into this room this room and were being
[1:31:06] healed and then he's I don't understand
[1:31:09] what's in there and then the Holy Spirit
[1:31:11] the angel begin to put it back in the
[1:31:13] wood for him watch he's always
[1:31:15] scriptural but I'm saying that he said
[1:31:17] did not our Lord see window prayers be
[1:31:20] not as the hypocrites that like to make
[1:31:22] a show he said enter into the secret
[1:31:24] closet and when you have done so closed
[1:31:26] the door then pray to your father that
[1:31:28] season secret and he that season secret
[1:31:30] shall reward thee openly and he said you
[1:31:33] remember that name that you hunt him
[1:31:34] that you dream about
[1:31:35] he said I'll meet you in there and this
[1:31:37] time it will be a public show and then
[1:31:40] the vision left me so that was 1956 but
[1:31:43] on 1963 the 7cu night he was just
[1:31:47] talking back some of it I just want to
[1:31:49] read that back he picked me up he took
[1:31:51] me up set me high I'm a meter was going
[1:31:53] on and looked like a tent or car TV or
[1:31:55] some sort and look and there was a
[1:31:56] little box like place on the side I seen
[1:31:58] the light that was talking above me the
[1:32:01] light that you see and the picture it
[1:32:03] will away from me like that went to the
[1:32:06] tent and said I'll meet you in there and
[1:32:08] this will be the purple and you won't
[1:32:12] tell it to nobody or glory that God has
[1:32:15] a place for him to meet you he's going
[1:32:18] to meet you there

[1:32:23] Lord a shout hallelujah and in Seban

[1:33:05] slightly right straight into the word he
[1:33:08] said notice for the end of time message
[1:33:11] this seal he reveals succeeds it doesn't
[1:33:14] nothing about the seventh but the end
[1:33:16] time seal when it starts it will be a
[1:33:18] secret according to the Bible and

[1:33:23] end of the seven angels message all the

[1:34:19] as his father cause he was placed and
[1:34:21] the son could fire who he wanted to he
[1:34:24] could hire who he wanted to he was in
[1:34:26] full possession of all that the father
[1:34:29] had Oh glory to God amen amen amen
[1:34:34] now you see Jesus here we go I had
[1:34:36] proven to God that he has been the right
[1:34:38] kind of son and God took him up on the
[1:34:41] top of the mountain brought witnesses oh
[1:34:44] dear heavenly witnesses and he witnesses
[1:34:46] and he clawed him at immortality a
[1:34:48] supernatural something taking place his
[1:34:50] garments glisten like the Sun in the
[1:34:52] middle of the day as white as they could
[1:34:53] be
[1:34:53] God placed on him that robe of
[1:34:56] immortality showing that the
[1:34:58] even here we go are you ready God's the
[1:35:02] thing that God will do to his sons here
[1:35:03] on earth someday he will call you a side
[1:35:06] Church if you'll only obey Him and stick
[1:35:10] on the wood and believe it he will place

[1:35:19] the church all the power that Christ had
[1:35:21] in him will be in the church all that
[1:35:24] God was he poured into Jesus all that
[1:35:26] Jesus was important to the church God
[1:35:28] wanted his work done he sent it into his
[1:35:30] son the son wanted work done he said
