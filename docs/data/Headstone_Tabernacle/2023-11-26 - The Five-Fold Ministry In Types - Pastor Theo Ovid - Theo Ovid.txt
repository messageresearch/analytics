hour comeing now is where the true worshippers going to worship the father in spirit and and Truth praise God Amen so this morning looking forward to see what the Lord will do and I'm here this morning not for long just a few comments I want to make before I introduce to you a tape uh a couple years back and the name and the tape is uh the fivefold ministry in type now you know for the last couple of services we have been emphasizing about God have to take the ministry and place the ministry first in position I want to read this from Acts chapter 4 if you have your you want to turn to it act 4:23 and this is after the lame man the CP man walked and whatnot we read this before but I want to read it again I want to bring something to you and being this is 23 they went to their own company reported all of the chief priests and Elders had sent to them and when they heard that they lifted up their voices to God now this is remember the Holy Ghost they say I the Holy Ghost I don't to pray I the Holy Ghost I to cry no they lift up their voices to God with one Accord and said Lord Thou Art God which has made Heaven and Earth and the Sea and all all that is in them okay watch who by the mouth of thy servant David had said why did Heen rage and the people imagine a vain thing the king of the earth stood up and the rulers were gathered together against the God and against his Christ for a truth against thy holy Child Jesus whom thou has anointed both Herod and Pontius Pilate with the Gentiles and the people of Israel were gathered together for to do whatsoever thy hand and th counil determined before to be done now Lord here we go behold your threatenings and Grant unto thy servants that with all boldness they would speak Thy Word by stretching forth thine hand to heal and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy Child Jesus note they say by explanation and interpretation but they were actually declaring they want God to do this by stretching forth his hand to heal and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy Child Jesus and when they had prayed it was this normal small little message pray thing no no no no when they had prayed the place was shaken where they were assembled together and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost it come like filled Holy Ghost again so in other words they refilled with the Holy Ghost and this is where we talk about dynamics of this church would be a refilling of the Holy Ghost which is right here in Acts 4 watch this part now and the multitude of them were one okay the multitude of them believe who of one heart of one Soul neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own but they had all things in common verse 33 here we go and with great power give the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus and great grace was upon them all not great quotes great message great books great tracks great power amen are we are you with me now was gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus and great grace was upon them all neither was the there any among them that lacked for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them and brought the prices of things uh that were sold and laid them at the apostles feet and distribution was made unto every man according as his need and Joseph who by the apostles was named Barnabas which were being interpreted the son of consolation a levite of the House of Cyprus having land sold it brought the money and laid it upon the apostles feet chapter 5 but a certain man named ananas which safarah his wife sold a possession and came back and kept back part of the price his wife also being prevy to it brought a certain part laid it at the apostles feet but Peter said annias why had Satan filled thy heart to lie to the Holy Ghost and to keep back part of the price of the land while it remained was it not thine own and after it was sold was it not thine own power why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart thou has not lied unto men but unto God and Nas hearing these words fell down and give up The Ghost and great fear came on them that heard these things and the young man arose wung him up carried him out and buried him it was about a space of 3 hours after his wife not knowing what was done came in Peter answered her tell me whether he sold the land for so such he said yeah for so such then Peter said unto her how is it that you have agreed together to tempt the spirit of the Lord behold the feet of them which have buried thy husband at the door shall carried he out then fell she down straightway at his feet yielded up The Ghost and the young man came in found the dead carry forth buried her by her husband and great fear Came Upon all the church and upon as many as heard these things question could you imagine God coming down in a fold Ministry in judgment I want you to think about that now now I know it have two extrem you have those who say press place fivefold that is not the word that's not what bam teach or preach they may read the message nothing revealed to them that they off they offer that and have those who say they fight for Ministry that also off too because but the Bible said when God sets in the church God have to set in the church and God can only set that according as by the prophet of Malachi 4 with groaning and travailing when God have said then he placed positionally these gifts in the body do you get it now so it will take the spirit Dynamics to positionally place the sons in position is our no man have this right now but this is promised God veiled not by the over Ministry and by over you know Shing the word not that this is because the faithful Ministry would actually be adopted Sons sons that could unveil God note when Peter saw the man he didn't say oh God how long you're sick no he wasn't questioning how length of sickness he says Silver and Gold Have I None such as I have I give I have the power to release to give to lose to free I have this power because I've been assigned to it by my father oh give the Lord a shout Peter didn't have to pray to God to do that you know he says silver and gold I don't have you up pick up your bed and walk oh give the Lord some praises and I am saying there'll be a gentile bride that will be empowered with the same power there will be what they call the manifestation of the sons of God when you come to church you come to church and sit down on a PE and go back home you come to church to see Sons born into manifestation oh give the Lord a shout in the house do you get it now you come in to see one day Sons going to be born into manifestation oh give the Lord a shout in the house you may be seated listen to this between Malachi and Matthew have about 400 years 400 years between Malachi and Matthew 400 plus years and between that have Pharisees Sadducees e and herodians and a whole bunch of them making Mischief off the Old Testament with the interpretation tall hats long gongs traditions and so on here come John the Baptist voice of one Crown willness rocking the country with a message so different he said repent for the king of God is at hand Oh Glory to God hallelujah he's had to rock them he said you better bring forth fruit meat to repentance you're coming down but you better come with a correct hat don't come here to dip come here to get Chang come here to get transformed Oh Glory to God and then all sudden John said there was one standing among you oh glory to God whose shoes are not worth un loose he going to baptize you with the Holy Ghost on Fire and Jesus waited in the backdrop Jesus said move yet nothing happened yet 12 to 30 12 18 years of silence all of a sudden Jesus get the witness of the spirit to move down to Jordan River all all of a sudden this one getting baptized that one getting baptized and here come Jesus turn and John said you should baptize me but Jesus said that might be so but it behooves us to fulfill all righteousness Oh Glory to God Jesus got baptized don't come the Holy Ghost don't come the dove don't come fire don't come an exper not don't come some mystery not don't come some text not don't come some book the holy ghost in the form of a dove comeing upon that Jesus and he was filled with the Holy Ghost and God said this is my son in whom I'm pleased to dwell in God stepped into that 16 element the word made flesh the word brought [Music] alive amen and that same God would is step into your flesh that same God that word will come alive there's enough devils in hell to stop it let me say it good there isn't enough devils in hell to stop this word from materializing from stopping this word from coming alive Glory let me pres bring his let me present the question to you again could you think about God coming down in a fful Ministry in [Applause] judgment they same brother Peter that deny Christ you know it's same one you know not different one you know you can say this is God veiled this is God stepped into 16 element oh give the Lord a shout as somebody say the 17th element He stepping into the 16th element Oh Glory to God this is God Veil now Hallelujah would God be Veil again yes Peter said to them you a li to a man you light to the Holy Ghost you see the crazy thing about it nobody was forcing them to sell and bring the money you know they could sell and bring whatever they want but say the truth you can't say yourself for that and you bring this here and you're lying yeah but I'm saying that hour will soon be corrected Hall one of the things I've said for years is that this message this Malachi 4 message have never seen judgment that why people getting away with murder get them with all kind of crazy stuff and it seems like the Prosper going normal normal just because it hasn't switched over yet look what God Said in Ezekiel 9 he bring the angels and say slay utterly and then incor Rider said he said but put a mark upon them that s cry slay utterly old woman young woman children any man without that Mark but come not near anybody with the m and begin at My Sanctuary Oh Glory to God judgment begins where in the house of God they have not seen that yet in this message but it is coming as sure as I'm standing before you today it is coming Oh Glory to God it will not be a man's Ministry it would be the ministry of Jesus Christ in the form of a prophet in the form of an apostle in the form of a teacher in the form of a pastor in the form of an evangelist God himself the chief Captain going to be stepping into those five offices not a devil move until we say so okay the Lord I shout in the house Oh [Applause] Glory so this is not a game this is not a play thing no it's not Hallelujah I'll leave the rest for

Saints and thanks for coming out uh being online um think the next two weeks we should be back in church uh by the grace of God and that's that's wonderful scripture this morning 1st Samuel 17 1 read 28- 551 Joshua 1 1:3 and 2 Kings 2 1-6 1st Samuel 17 28- 51 this is David coming to drop vory victuals some some little stuff from his father to his brothers verse 28 and elab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men and iab's anger was kindled against David he said why CEST thou hither and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in Wilderness I Know Thy pride and and the naughtiness of thine heart for thou art come down that thou might see the battle and David said what have I now done is there not a cause and he turned from him towards another and spake after the same manner and the people answered him again after the former Manner and when the words were heard which David spake they rehearsed them before Saul and he sent for him and David said to Saul let no man heart fail because of him thy servant will go and fight this Philistine and Saul said to David Thou Art not able to go against his Philistine to fight with him for thou art but a youth and he a man of war from his Youth and David said unto Saul thy servant kept his father sheep there came a l and a bear and took a lamb out of the flock and I went after him and smote him and delivered it out of his mouth and when he arose against me I caught him by his beard and smote him and slew him thy servants slew both The Lion and the bear and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them seeing he had Define the armies of the Living God David said moreover the Lord had delivered me out of the Paw of the land out of the Paw of the beer he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine and Saul said unto David go and the Lord be with thee Saul armed David with his armor he put a helmet of brass upon his head and he armed him with a coat of male David GED his sword upon his armor he has say to go for he had not proved it and David S the SW I cannot go with these I have not prove them and David put them off him he took his staff in his hand chose him five smooth stones out of a brook he put them in Shepherd's bag which he had even in a script and his sling was in his hand and he drew near to the Philistine and the Philistine came on and Drew near unto David and the man that be the shield went before him and when the Philistine looked about and saw David he disdained him for he was but a youth readyy of a fear countenance and the Philistine said unto David am I a dog that th comest to me with staves and the Philistine cursed David by his gods and the Philistines said to David come to me and I will give thy flesh unto the of the air andto the Beast of the field then said David to the Philistine thou comest to me with sword with spear with a shield but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts the god of the armies of Israel whom thou Hast defined this day will the Lord deliver thee into my hand and I will smite thee and will take thine head from Thee I will give the carcasses of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air andto the wild beast of the earth that all the Earth may know that there is a God in Israel and all this assembly shall know that the Lord saveth not with sword and spear for the battle is the Lords and he will give you unto our hands and came to pass when the Philistines arose and came and Drew near to meet David that David hasted and ran towards the Army to meet the Philistine and David put his hand in his back took Den his Stone slang it SW the Philistine in his forehead and the stone sunk in his forehead and he fell upon the face of the Earth so David prevailed over the pH with a sling and a stone and smote the Philistine and slew him but there was no sword in the hand of David therefore David ran and stood upon the Philistine and took his sword and Drew it out of his sheath therefore and slew him and cut off his head there with when the Philistines saw the champion was dead they fled I like that when the champion was dead they fled and the men of Israel and Judah arose and shouted and pursued the Philistines until until Thou come to the valley unto the gates of ekron and the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way of sham even unto the Gat unto echon and the children of Israel okay I'll stop right there praise the Lord amen so let's go now to Joshua chapter 1 and we're going to read uh verse 1 to3 now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord it came to pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of none Moses Minister saying Moses my servant is dead now dear arise go over this Jordan thou and all this people unto the land which I do give them even to the children of Israel every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that have I given unto you as I said unto Moses our last scripture is from 1st Samuel chapter 2 1-6 and it came to pass when the Lord would take up Elijah into Heaven by a willin that Elijah elah went with Elisha from gigel and Elijah said to Elisha T here I pray the for the Lord that sent me to be Elijah said unto him as the Lord liveth as I so liveth I will not leave thee so they went down to Beal and the sons of the prophets that were at Bethal came forth to Elisha said unto him knowest thou that the Lord will take away thy master from thy head today he said yeah I know it hold ye your peace Elijah said unto him Elisha T here I praise he for the Lord had sent me to Jericho he said as the Lord liveth as I so liveth I will not leave thee so they came to Jericho and the sons of the prophets that were Jericho came to Elisha and said unto him knowest thou that the Lord will take away thy master from thy head today he said answered yeah I know it holy your peace Elijah said unto him T I pray thee here for the Lord have sent me to Jordan he said as the Lord liveth as thy soul liveth I will not leave thee and the two went on may God bless his word you may be seated God B bless you and are we so grateful to be here this morning where is but over going all these [Laughter] scriptures all right so the title this morning the fivefold ministry in types that's the title this morning fivefold Ministry in Types on a subject David's Ministry Joshua's Ministry Elisha's Ministry and I have an inspiration the ministry of Jesus Christ in the adopted sons in the last day have a context scripture acts chap 4 31-33 and it reads and when they had prayed the place was shaken where they were assembled together and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and they spake the word of God with boldness and the multitude of them that believe were of one heart and of one Soul neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed as his own but they all had things in common there's the verse I want to get to and with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus and great grace was upon them all oh blessed be the name of the Lord great power is what the apostles have to give witness of the resurrection of Jesus Christ all let's go brother Brandon let's go back to the real first light the old Pentecostal blessing and the power of the Holy Ghost back in the church they put it all on the preacher today it ain't the preacher here we go the Holy Ghost is just as much to the Ley as it is is to the preacher oh give the Lord a shout feeling good already the Holy Ghost is what just as much to the L as it is to the preacher he ain't got all the religion they got it out here I am one today this is Brother Mana that believes that we ought to get the spirit of God back in the church where we can have the gifts of the Spirit operating with unction and power this is not brother to thing this is brother brandham saying I want I'm one today that believes we ought to get the spirit of God back in the church where we can have the gifts of the Spirit operating with unction and power but today we find men wearing the beginning in the church ages you notice it started at Deeds of the nians after a while it become a Doctrine well what is it we are have taken all the spirit away from the congregation and make Bishops overseers popes you see where I get message pop from because that's what they make when they take the spirit off from the congregation and put it on men message men Pastor men so-called fold men not not God fold men who assume things now they have taken all the spirit away from the congregation and made Bishops overseers popes put it all in the pulpit and the pulpit got intellectual Hallelujah no more Spirit just talk and more talk mystery on top of mystery just intellectual explanation reference from who say and who say and who say and who say out there I come to preach on Time magazine or Music Magazine that's what them say they I'm come to preach from the word of God because the word is Original Seed what word not my word the word from the mouth of the prophets Oh Glory to God Amen so watch they put it all in the pulpit and the pulpit got intellectual and there you got a hybrid church again under intellectuals but say God send us back to the Holy Ghost amongst the people let the unction of the spirit move among the people giving forth messages and power and manifestation if we have to stand on the street corner or get a chicken house or AB band somewhere oh praise the name of the Lord and if Jesus Christ Liv in the apostles and done the signs that he was here on Earth it will do it again if we get zeroed in we have got to get zeroed I don't care what the church says that's why I try to say zero on this promise I want to know what his promised the bride I don't want to know what the devil this doing out here and that doing out here I want to know what what is my promise because I have to deal with depress with Rome with with false prophets with false people you have to deal with all of that oh praise the name of the Lord if the apostles hit the DT we can hit the DT too could somebody say Amen if we will get zeroed with God's word let our experience zero with his word they did it if they did it we can do it too amen oh blessed be the name of the Lord that's so wonderful so the subject we talk about David's Ministry Joshua Ministry and Ministry the 5old ministry in type now David was virtually unknown God told Samuel David and nobody virtually unknown anointed to be king by Samuel under Divine instruction and we know we know the story and I want you to show as this is a type of the F4 Ministry because I keep saying it I know a lot of ministers and brothers disagree what I'm saying but I I keep saying it anyhow because what I believe and this is what I'm seeing in the word and I'll preach it because I see it and I believe it there's a fivefold Ministry yet the reason I'm saying that it will take Dynamics to produce the fold Ministry so right now we are doing the work of apostle doing the work of a prophet doing the work of evangelist doing the work of a teacher doing of a pastor I've been doing this thing for many many years but it takes God to place me in the position that's something different that is something absolutely different it come like if you ask a question brother you do you believe they are false anointed ones not in the way that was prophesied they are Breen who are false they are Breen who are teaching false teachings and false doctrines they are false but they are not anointed false yet when the anointing strike then they become the anointed ones false but for now maybe God could flip them wrong I don't know because when the door for the Gentile was about open about to be open there was a man named Saul that was fighting the church now if we stay back as the church and say Saul false anointed he fighting the message he fighting inspiration we was going to be off because Saul was going to become Paul so that was the beginning so God give Saul that space flip him over he was changed to Paul and we know he wrote the New Testament and something like that that was in the beginning now this is the ending now this is the ending where the door of the gentille is about to be closed and seeds have been sown and you cannot change your seed mid Harvest you cannot in the middle of your being a corn and you say you know what I want to be a peas no too late a little while you'll bear your corn a little while you'll bear your hate or your animosity or your evil or your unforgiveness and a little while you're getting your Harvest you you can't change it even when the Holy Spirit told the prophet pick up a pen and write he said many there the holy spirit said many true ministers will misunderstand that Prophet so I cannot say this one false and that one false no here's why the true anointed have to come forth first and we haven't seen that yet oh glory to God hallelujah we haven't seen that yet because Dynamics will push forward the true anointed and this is where David coming now oh hallelujah oh glory to God I feel inspired now David God get fed up with Saul and God tell Samuel go and anoint me a king of one of Jesse's son we know the story David was not even considered by Jesse he bring out all them stab boys all them regulars and when Samuel said is there any more because what I'm seeing here I have no witness the teaching was good the preaching was perfect the Revelation was very good but the witness of the spirit wasn't there upon that Prophet so you had to say send some more is there anymore they bring David unknown guy seeing about sheep poured the oil upon him all right then David Going Back Into Obscurity yeah yeah about David David see about sheep now David's father inspired to send David with some rituals for his brothers his brothers trying to embarrass him and belittle him and David said isn't there a cause because when David was leaving Goliath made his Ro send me a man we know the story David gave a testimony that none of them had he had given experience that none of them had that is why he didn't care about sword and Spear and armor and Shield or even golad size he said who is that uncircumcised Philistines I'm going to fight item that's the fivefold ministry the fivefold ministry going to take out Goliath Oh Glory to God Hallelujah in this message the fful ministry going to be positionally placed internationally to deal with the intellectual Giants in this message Oh Glory that's David's Ministry that is Christ's Ministry oh blessed be the name of the Lord Brother Bram many meetings many men many ministers come to me and confess that they believe that name of Jesus Christ right to be baptized in but or our organization will put us out you poor excuse he said take all armor off he said give me the power and the strength of the Holy Spirit God send me with a slingshot no matter what it is how little I'm beat the enemy down David said this thing don't look right and he talk about lion and the bear he said that's what the matter today God has got a letter sheep that's going astray the organization has stole them out and brought them into psychology God give us Davids that is where the fight will comeing in God give us what Davids oh hallelujah hallelujah God give us Davids with the word of God and the power of God to direct it where we going to meet these intellectual Giants with all the PHD and lld oh give the Lord a shout from 1965 to now them giants real big they grow well Tall they well big they well organized but God give us some David I telling you Avid Ministry is going to be coming on the scene a fivefold Ministry ordained and anointed and appointed by God who I hear now he said watch he said God give us David's plural with the word not not a David Davids it's not a one man show Davids okay with the word of God and the power of God to direct it when we go to meet these intellectual Giants with all the PHD whatever it might be give me the the word of God and the power of the Holy Ghost and I tell you we can slay every Giant on the field Oh Glory to God hallelujah we not talking about local Giants you know we talking about Giants on the field men who have influencing power over Believers over bride churches because listen these Spirit of man these guys they could control church but they can't control bride because Christ is the head of the body called The Church oh Hallelujah David was the poorest excuse there was on the field to go fight with a giant he didn't have any of these big intellectual degrees he wasn't well trained praise God Saul he was the best he had shoulders above the Army he was the one ought to went and fought him but he was scared and today we know we need a Revival or or we know we need a stirring amongst the people it will not take a doctor of divinity it will take a weakling he say hallelujah that will take take the word of God in the power of the resurrection of Christ and slay the thing it will bring Christ to the country and let them see he can still open the blind eyes he can still heal the sick he can still raise the dead he is God he's a conqueror we need a David untrained in theological schools we need a man who knows nothing about that some little plow boy something somewhere stooped with stooped shoulders not much to look at will come walking down road with the power of God you see a young man a man of God a minister a servant of God walking down with the power of God would embarrass all these intellectual slick talking preachers Hallelujah Bible call them lining way to deceive with the slay of hand that's doing tricks making you see what they want you to see not what God saying you know not the vision you know they want you to see what they want you to see oh praise the name of the Lord but Bram he said now watch no support of denomination no support of ecclesiastical setup but in Simplicity and the power of the holy spirit that fell on Pentecost watch he said you won't be handness up with a bunch of this theologians which your color turn around but brother you'll have something in your hand as long as the spirit of God will get into that word it will conquer and bring back them L sheep that go on astray oh my amen confess our weakness throw off your doctor of divinity throw off your know it all your membership strip yourself before God spiritually speaking and call yourself unworthy then God can go to use in you and don't say it from your mouth bring it from your heart strip yourself unworthy call yourself unworthy now they call yourself the Holy Ghost the Bible say you are the Temple of the Holy Ghost a man come up with a revelation you are the Holy Ghost a li in spirit doctrines of devils and people believe that foolishness literally believe that the word say receive the Holy Ghost they are the Holy Ghost now they even not even crying for the Holy Ghost because they are that deceived my so David that to strip themselves he was among the weakest among the whole crowd think of it tens of thousands of hundreds of thousands of soldiers on the hill all of them train every one of them with the PHD every one of them with Spears they were soldiers each one of them Corporal so and so private so and so privat General so and so Lieutenant so and so I'm still reading great fourar General Saul Bishop your honor sir everyone I'm standing there train men and the enemy standing on a fixel saying you bunch of cards and up in the camp come a little stoop shoulder oh God like a Rudy looking fellow little sling shirt over his back with a raisen pie in his hand from for his brother and that giant come down and make a cry once too often and said you mean to tell me you bunch of trained soldiers would stand there and let that uncircumcised theight the army of the word of the Living God are you afraid of him what was it David was the most unlearned of the bunch no school of fighting nothing like that at all but he trusted God his faith was in God he says Satan has his intellectual Giants you remember they said there were giants in the land in them days Giants he still has them intellectual Giants isn't that right intellectual Giants come around to prove that all the shouting saying amen going to the altar breaking up for your sins that is just emotion that's an intellectual Giant they don't want to worship they don't want to shout they don't want to altar call they want people to just raise their hand and stick their hand down like that but we want the old time singing all time shouting all time preaching oh give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah Glory I can hear shouting Hallelujah hallu that's the intellectual giant walk up dry eye just say join Church well I believe Jesus Christ you know and say well I'm be positionally placed of a knowledge of the word let's continue this is going good this morning praise is go why going go because I'm saying going good no because this is the word watch that's why the all wise God equipped his army with the baptism of the Holy Ghost okay let back up a little bit that's the intellectual J there's no such a thing walk up dry eye and just say well I'll join this church well I believe Jesus Christ Son of God Satan does too no sign that he's saved it takes more than that it takes a new birth it takes a new birth not just saying that here we go it takes something that happens in here that makes you different see that's why here we go the all wise God equipped his army with the baptism of the Holy Ghost he know woo he know these intellectual Giants would stand in this last day he know they with stand and they'll be able to explain by their wisdom he called it powers of Satan Peter said they're like a roaring lion devouring what we will I'm not talking about outside I'm talking about in this message I'm not talking about people outside okay the intellectual Giants they are here in this message Hallelujah and David Ministry go get them David's Ministry going to deal with them Hallelujah and that is a type of Def fiful Ministry Oh Glory to God hallelujah so watch they a in line but R continue deeper he said I'm not going to leave you comfortless I'm coming again I'm going to be with you he equips his army with the baptism of the Holy Ghost go up there every one of you and wait Luke 24:49 behold I send the promise of my father upon you but taring the seity of Jerusalem until you'll be endued power from on high and after this the Holy Ghost has come upon you then you'll be Witnesses of me in Jerusalem Judea Plum on down to the uttermost part of the world so when the Holy Ghost fell and the fire began to fall again they were all filled with the Holy Ghost not taught about the Holy Ghost not understand what is the Holy Ghost they were filled with it whatever it is they will filled with that that is the promise Hallelujah another a bunch of men explaining this and explaining this the object is to get not God with not God above or with but God in Hallelujah and the baptism of holy is what puts God in brother Bram so now God knowing this is good that in the last days will come intellectual Giants there will come everything intellectual all kinds of reasoning God pacting the baptism of the Holy Ghost with what speaking with tongues interpretation of tongues prophecies gifts all kind of things they may seem hard in training but brother on the Battlefront every one of them has got to be used so it can't be the preacher only it cannot be the pulpit only it have to be the tongues interpretation of tongu Prophecy gifts are healing every gift you want your eyes your nose your toes you want all part of your body oh give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah glory to God God equip his soul is exactly what it takes to use one they might say just learn psychology that won't work that's as tin as a brad made up to the shadow of a chicken that star to death that's no good we have to have power of the Holy Ghost coming upon a man with all the nine spiritual gifts dwelling in him you say I just don't like to get out I don't like to pray all night I don't like well then you're going to get killed in the Battlefront you stay there till God equips you with the baptism of the spirit then everything you got need of in this world or the world to come lives right in you that's why Jesus said behold the kingdom is within you oh glory to God and by further Revelation the prophet identified the kingdom is the word made spirit and power in your life he said the words that I speak they are spirit and they are life oh give the Lord some Praises do we have some shouters in the house this morning Hallelujah in your house are you shouting the Praises of God this morning let your neighbor hear you oh glory to God let the devil hear you let the devil hear you what side you're on whose side you're on oh my the all wise God know how to equip his army he equip it with the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's exactly what he said these last days he knew we would have to have it wo are you ready here's why here the bom he knew we would have to have it he knew that people would reason would go to reading this word when it become in print out here what would happen so this wise God know that in his last days the word will get in print where people could read and reason reason and read read and reason that is why I have so much uh h h h what you call disinformation now people want to say things contrary all kind of foolishness on the internet I I was listening hearing some raster Prophet from Jamaica and some top some mountain and a bunch of people up there Mountain they say he was interviewed by BBC and and so on like that and he's talking about so long he's talking about this virus coming years ago and now they're up on the land and and they're waiting for Jack to come and you know quoting scriptures and different things like that and talking about depopulation and all kind of De population I said what does have to anything depopulation that this virus come to depopulate who controlling that somebody say depopulate that depopulate America it sounds so foolish but then that Satan plan Satan plan Satan want bodies to use Satan jealous he do this body he can't come down on the earth he's a dis bodied embodied Spirit Oh Glory looking for bodies to use the Bible said except God shortened the the the time no flesh shall be saved because the super SE running rampant Oh Glory to God the Earth was blacked out the the the Holy Spirit draw it blacked out and brother put a little sliver of light to represent you and I oh we should be praising and thanking God all kind of conspiracy theories all kind of nonsense we not here to preach that we here to preach solid word solid Promises by these promises you can become partaker of his divine nature oh give the Lord some Praises hallelujah praise God praise God praise God so them fighting the vaccine them them up on up the eating J food eating eating ital food oh hallelujah praise God Amen they feeling like the Escape ones on the mountain up there woo so the all wise God knowing how to equip the people with the equip them with the B Holy Ghost that's exactly he knew we would have to have it why he knew that people would reason they would go to reading this word when it come out in print then when it in print you could twist it yes remember Peter and them didn't have it in print you know right Peter and them had Old Testament scripture but the New Testament they were the Living Word what words they spoke common print but they had nothing to print to make a record as such they actually manifested and produce another book of Acts which become our record oh give the Lord some shout book of Peter book of Philippians Book of Romans H book of Corinthians that become the New Testament by men that was living so you are to actually take these men as Living Word speaking the word of God that's why Paul could say if I preach some other gospel than I first preached let me be a cursed oh if an angel come from heaven and preach any other gospel so today there's intellectual GI there's men who are great men great powerful men they could set everything together so intellectual but where is that Revival where is that God that burns on the heart of the human being it takes him Simplicity to bring the power of God that's a good one it takes what Simplicity to to bring the power of God he said it takes the Simplicity of believing God to make his word speak out to show that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever it takes a humble heart dedicated to God to bring Jesus Christ into present tense woo glory to God hallelujah you want to see Jesus it takes a certain heart a humble heart dedicated to God to bring Jesus in the present tense is not by might it does not take knowledge it he said he said it it does not take knowledge it's not by power it's not by might but is by my spirit sayth the Lord I'll unfold this mystery and we will cry to it Grace Grace with shoutings oh blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah so Jesus had proven that he was the right kind of son so God just take Jesus for granted he was he had to prove he was the right kind of a son and they know he was adopted and he said this that's the thing that that God will do for his sons here on Earth someday he will call you a side church if you'll only obey him and stay on the word and believe it he will place into the church he will place where into the church before the coming of Jesus Christ he will place into the church all the powers that Christ had in him will be in the church all that God was he poured into Jesus all that Jesus was he poured into the church God wanted his work done he sent it into son his son wanted the work done he sent it into the church at that day you shall know I in the Father the father in me I in you and you in me at that day because the same power here we go that was in Jehovah God rested in Jesus Christ and the same power that rested in Jesus Christ rest in placed sons in the body of Christ and that is why I saying the true anointed a come forth yet because it take Dynamics to push them forward or let me rephrase that it will take a manifestation to push them forward oh give the Lord some Praises understand this if David had wear uh uh the Army sa and them armor he is just like the wear the armor and defeated wear the Armor All arm all them Spear and shield and helmet and whatnot he got go like that they have all the armor they have all the stuff and they still defeated they can't face coll so David have to show he have something different he has faith in God he said God will deliver you into my hands goad prophesy feed her to the birds and whatever it is and David prophesy right back he back down know he prophesy I'll take your head off today you are M Hallelujah you Ain leaving here alive oh glory to God I dealing with you that's the fight for Ministry David Ministry going to step forward what kind of ministry is that Fearless anointed Hallelujah met God on the back side it takes a manifestation to push David forward how else could David be recognized except God prepared the environment for David to step forward the bear the lion that was backside of the desert experience the anointing upon Him is only his brothers who witness to that all that is in God's private dressing room but you see when God created the environment for David to step forward to Dil Goliath that was public that's a public show that is a public Ministry to identify this is my son he's anointed he is commissioned he is dealing with intellectual Giants on the field oh give the Lord some Praises this is the F for Ministry type h not grumbling be some pulpit and throwing on this brother and throwing on that church not that there no f for Ministry Hallelujah this is what we talking about here David's Ministry oh do you love him this morning glory to God so brother Braham says here watch so watch the same power that rested in Jesus Christ rests in place sons and in the body of Christ placing of a son take him out to a certain place he's explaining it it don't need a deeper explanation than that take him out to a certain place have a ceremony before Angels Place him positionally in the body of Christ then that person has the authority let me say this if you call me a fanatic from this night on that's the very same thing that I'm speaking of will be done there will be a power put into the church and now coming in notice here about no mystery talking mystery revealing mystery unfolding he said there's a power coming into the church and now it's coming in that the Holy Spirit not some man some message man some five-fold man some only man no that the Holy Spirit Will so anoint the people till they will speak the word it will create itself right there we haven't seen Powers yet it is coming into the church now I know it for as a fact Hallelujah see that mean God give him Vision he know as a fact it solidify say unto this mountain don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you said shall come to pass you can have what you said the placing of the church in position where the fullness of the power of the Holy Ghost comes into the church then the critic's mouth will be shut so right now let them talk let them pray let them brag let them boast let them laugh that's okay here's the promise here that the fullness of the power of the Holy Ghost comes into the church then the critic's mouth will be shut there'll be a short time Jesus come right off the Mountain straight to Calvary but it won't last long but it will be here what a prophecy but Anthony he said it won't last long but it will be here so let them laugh let them mock let them scoff let them say be crazy but I know the critic's mouth will be shut you notice when David loose that stone my God them other Philistines they begin to run they fled Oh Glory to God hallelujah David dropped that son and Goliath head and them guys had to take off and when God BEC to anoint that David Ministry the fold Ministry them go Li them Philistine go run Oh Glory to God they going run all over the country they going to be running because go identify David's Ministry F Ministry oh Hallelujah critics more will be shut not now let them criticize they're supposed to criticize Hallelujah but the brandham says there are so many voices in the Earth today that is absolutely hard thing to hear the voice of God because there's you de the voice of the supernatural there are so many intellectual voices great voices of Mighty Men now there are Mighty Men you know mighty men who are intellectual and in the intellectual condition the shaking nations with just the head knowledge Nations shook ministers shook churches shook because nobody knew it like them nobody could explain it like them nobody could show it Reve like them they shaken up Nation without power shaking up Nation without Spirit that's the head of work anointed G matter they are not overnight people but they Shake Nations being in great organization together great campaign flowly and a person would be a bit confused it's enough to confuse them on how these things could go on and prosper and there are voices that are raised up that do these things and it causes the voice of God to be placed way back somewhere and I realize for these guys be effective deceiver they have to disconnect the people from The Prophet clicks pull the plug on the prophet and then it get focus on them oh hallelujah oh my I say this way I have an Android phone Samsung right and that operating system is Android but Samsung have a skin over it that that that is the that the UI their graphical surface over it all the other companies would have Android the source is the Android but they could put things over it so you see now our source is the Bible that is the source code that's the original source that bam could could read a scripture the spirit of the Prophet is subject to the prophets and out of that scripture he could unfold Church order because that is the key that is the source so every time he call a scripture he see a mystery is scripture so a mystery is not just mystery a mystery of scripture a previously divinely hidden truth now divinely revealed but with it leave a supernatural amen atmosphere around it and something like that isn't that right so every word that was revealed he had was to come from the scripture that when the angel came to him to open the seals he compared what the angel was telling him with the scripture I'm not saying there is no angel is have Angels talking to guys but it's what them saying if it's in the scripture so you have to able to match it up so I don't want to hear what Bill Gates saying about depopulation that's not my gospel I don't hear what this one's saying and that one's saying I'm not reading what them saying I want to know what the Bible say in the last day be a super church that's what I know the people that know that God shall do great exploits that's what I know have nothing with depopulation and the vaccine and the vaccine and the vaccine like foolishness like distraction they're so foolish all the time people dying of Corona virus now the vaccine is the issue vaccine is Mark of the Beast and the prophet say right now you're being marked your judgment is later on and that he said that before he had vaccine Hallelujah Ezekiel 9 cry and say seal those who had take the vaccine that the Bible that scripture for that think about it now what the Bible say seal those who s and cry for the Abominations script SE SE those that that that that take the vaccine are you crazy that's why you had to go back to the word you know oh have the word have to be the source when you draw from that that by the word oh my Hallelujah brother talk about this he said and the voice of God so he's prophesying they say how will we know is the voice of God so he's prophesying for our time when we would ask the question how we will know is the voice of God he said because for today then it wasn't a vinting prophet talking about himself all right now today how we know is the voice of God because it will be a manifestation of the prophet's word this is God's prophet and a true voice of God only brings back brings back that real living Supernatural God with a supernatural word with a supernatural manifestation of the true word oh my so I'm going to conclude with David here now David's Ministry is to check the intellectual Giants on the field by and with the power of God that's the five-fold ministry to the bride buddy around the world so them Giants they wouldn't Escape no no no no no they wouldn't Escape God have David in type to show how they will be handled Hallelujah it wouldn't be quotee versus quote it wouldn't be explanation versus explanation it wouldn't be debate versus debate this wouldn't be an online debate and an online question and answer situation this is not that David Ministry is the power of God the spirit of God oh God upon a true fful Ministry to deep with them intellectual Giants with power oh my then we come now to Joshua Ministry W hallelujah oh do you love him this morning glory to God I showing you the five for Ministry and types Joshua now after the of Moses servant of God we read the scripture God tell Joshua Moses is dead arise go over this Jordan down on all this people into the land which God gave to them every place Sol of foot shall Tre upon that you now remember this God not talking a loud speaker they not a loud speaker God talking God shouting Joshua and everybody hearing that that God telling that no God tell that to Joshua the people hear that that that's not the voice for the people that's the voice for Joshua so he had to obey God right there shall not be any man so he described the from the r river river Euphrates and so like that and the Wilderness going on to the Sea shall be a coast there shall not be any man be able to stand before the all days of thy life as I was with Moses so I will be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake thee th God telling Joshua that the people don't know nothing about that the people just watching Joshua they don't know as God was with Moses he is now with Joshua they don't know that they have no revelation of that all they know is this man that was Moses minister is now stepping forward to lead us that's all they know so he's a unknown yet known just as Moses Minister he's no prophet he a no preacher thing he's just Moses Minister he's there with Moses every know Joshua look mes all right he told him M with night so but brah says here this now here we go and there's a great lot of types we could go into we'll bypass some of them for instance like Moses brought the church up to sin to their Theology of last night Moses was not permitted to take the TR over into the promised land because he he had failed so B is preaching and the church organization denomination has failed they will not take the church over God will raise up a new system a inter denominational system by the power of God that will take the church into the promised land organizations and denominations has messed it up each one after their own theology each one after their own thinking but God will take his Holy Spirit and will raise up his Joshua plural that will take the church to the promise with no denominational string tied anywhere but will take over his church he will take his Holy Spirit and raise up his Joshua who is that Ministry fight for Ministry type Oh Glory to God the guys that God going to raise up to take the church over Oh Glory to God hallelujah Moses had failed he was a lawgiver Joshua was called of Grace he took the church on we find that Joshua knowing his commission knowing it lays in his hand God had called him for a duty and he must not you had to walk softly before God you said how the church ought to look this morning to what for what to find the spirit working amongst the people if you want a church home where there's spirit that raised Christ from the dead the holy spirit that will move among the people not just Pulpit Holy Spirit Oh Glory to God hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus watch the spirit I real right okay he said God called ministers he said God called ministers ought not to be stuffed up with theology but but have visited the land to where we are going bringing back evidence of divine love and the power of Jesus Christ to make known to their congregation that there's a lan River now last night preaching going up Jordan and when we get to that River it divides us it separate us on the other side something has to happen oh my now Joshua knowing what command was great and having the Assurance he could be Fearless he could be as we call it Reckless as long as he was pointed the right way notice David Ministry Fearless look at josua Ministry Fearless because he was pointed the right way oh glory to God and so can the Church of the Living God be Reckless and fearless in faith if we areed the right way for he said as I was with Moses I will be with thee I will not fail thee for forsake thee he never forsake Moses he never failed Moses he will not fail Joshua he will not fail us as I was in Malachi 4 so will I will be Ephesians 4 the true five-fold Ministry oh give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah so that was Joshua 1 right Joshua 3 this is this Joshua said unto the people sanctify yourselves for tomorrow the Lord will do wonders among you Joshua spake unto the priest saying take up the Ark of the Covenant Passover before the people and they took up the Ark of the Covenant and went before the people and the Lord said unto Joshua so joshu spoke to the people now God talking to Joshua the Lord said un Joshua this day will I begin to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel Oh Glory Hallelujah my God I feel fire in the camp this day will I begin to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel that they may know that as I was with Moses I will be with thee Oh Glory to God all the time Joshua know it privately but now God going to make it publicly as I was when with Moses I'm going to be redeem the Lord a shout oh a field fire in the building Oh Glory to God hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus notice notice

sight of all Israel and they that they may know that as with Moses I'll be with thee and thou shalt command the priest that bear thee Act of the Covenant saying when ye are come to the brink of the water of Jordan you shall stand still in Jordan and Joshua said unto the children of Israel come hither hear the words of the Lord your God and Joshua said hereby ye shall know that the Living God is Among Us Now Joshua have the anointing Joshua know what God is about to do so Joshua is telling them and hallelujah praise God and joshu said hereby ye shall know that the Living God is Among Us not because we have a book not because of a taste but because something about to happen there's going to be a manifestation that you're going to know that the Lord God is Among Us Oh Glory to God hallelujah Give the Lord a shout Joshua said hereby you shall know that the Living God is among you that he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites the Hittites the hites the perizzites the gites the amorites and the jebusites behold the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord is Earth passed before you in the Jordan and therefore take you 12 men out of the tribe of Israel out of every tribe of man it shall come to pass as soon as the SS of your feet of the priest shall bear the Ark of the Lord the Lord of all the Earth shall rest on the Waters of Jordan that the Waters of the Jordan shall be cut off from the waters that come from from above and they shall stand upon a heap oh so he prophesy Joshua prophesy and said listen when them guys fot touch that water J going to open up oh give the Lord a shout Oh Glory to God you talk about Divine leadership you talk about Divine appointment Oh Glory to God hallelujah Glory brother BR he said I want you know what notice what taking place there was Esau Moab he said no brother the real Church of God has got no forms no Creeds led by the power of God in every individual heart pass by your brethren is Brethren don't fuss at them we are greater than they don't fuss at them just go by he said watch he said many of those people are actually borderline Believers justification left Egypt sanctification praise God he said but the third stage was when they Cross Jordan into the promised land where their inheritance laid what you Lutheran believe in justification and new Methodist nazarin Church of God believe in sanctification killing of the evil that's in you taking out the root of evil belongs right but to you men and women there is something in you calling you out the Deep to the Deep there's a Jordan yet to cross a land beyond the river oh my he said you're going to pass by your brethren that's part of the journey right you're going to pass by your brethren and they near the borderline now if you pass by them don't say nothing to them I've given es of this mountain I've given Moab this country I don't why you fussing at them PR lightting oh God Lord hallelujah the light you get more bites and you get ISO children just move gently you know know where you're going don't take up the habits oh I'm going to skip down leave B alone and them fellas some of that time tell them guys he said if all your deep you have got have been satisfied stay where you are but for me and my house for me there is something more than we have seen there's a land beyond the river somewhere there's still a deep calling to the deep I cannot be satisfied with theology I cannot be satisfied with a good church I cannot be satisfied with a good campaign I cannot be satisfied with with a little healing service there is something beyond that that calling oh my I've given Esau this mountain don't touch him I've got something different for you cross over praise God are you ready let everything go wrong let everybody else Prosper let errors Prosper let the men who have a former godliness deny the power thereof Prosper show you back but if you know where you stand you with stand regardless if the whole world turns you down you will not vary from that word my hallelujah oh thank you Lord Jesus brother Bram praise God this is from Paradox you see what coming down to the Jord me we down here now let's cross over now let's quit playing Let's cross the other side now because it all belongs to us it's all ours them Visions has never failed they can't fail because they come from God I believe it with all that is within me we are not the Haring that would run back into the Wilderness we will cross Jordan the separation God break to us the seals that's on the back of the book in other words break to us them seven Thunders on the back of the book let us enter into that great place now for Joshua to violate to the people The Inheritance that God had left for them now the commission to Joshua was three-fold We Know It crossover fight and conquer and then divide you cannot divide what you have not conquered and you cannot conquer if you don't confront let me say it again you cannot divide what you have not conquered and you cannot conquer what you not beare to confront and it's interesting how God put Jericho just right in front of Joshua the first thing the hardest thing Jericho when you can conquer Jericho you can con conquer anything and God showing not by my not by power but by the captain the captain of the host that follow instructions obedience come on now come on now oh glory to God tested on obedience and then you get the victory under obedience all right but brandham said this now Hallelujah we cannot have a Revival until we got men God called men so you know I blast men I blast number six I hit them hard because I I got terribly uh was a terrible experience in my early years in this message in Trinidad to see men manipulate people's lives I hated it if you spit and know the color is spit you want to tell your house to buy what car to buy where to go go to school not to go to school don't do this all control many of them have destroyed lives and never even repented of it that's right take people out of school affect people careers people's future and life and family and everything else yeah I rejected all of that yeah one time I I go to the same a tailor wearing the same ple pants because I thought that is what you're supposed to wear I didn't buy wool pants and all people buy W until the ants bite holes inside the pants I recognize in Trinidad here you don't need that kind of pants until I change my ta and all when I change back I wasn't wearing any pants like almost and you shall know them good Lord those were the days I was a radical I want to look like them Hallelujah you said we can't have a Revival until we get men God call men one two God trained men that is not trained up in the School of Theology and education but rugged men of fate and God has brought up in the school of his rugged training men who want not afraid to face the fire men who has come into the presence of God that knows his power that knows his omnipotence that knows his healing power some men are trained out to to know the Living God it's all right to train them by the word but the letter kill it but the spirit give it life and before we can have this revival God has to call out men and train men God trained men to carry this message they don't care what the opposition is they're willing to go to the fiery furnace and defeat to the Lions then whatever it may be they're ready to go because because they have been in the presence of God and know that he is whether to Victory or defeat they still stand the same that's the kind of training God does to men it's very strange to think that God would do that that God trains men like that but he does God leads his people to Great trials to purge them to what you know this coron virus is a purging too yeah it bringing out what people believe it bringing out what in people's heart and I recognize people don't believe the message you know they need message but they don't believe what bam says they believe what the pastor telling them and they have checken where is it there's a man on board examining horns they check any the horns Hallelujah God lead his people through great trials to purge them and sometime it takes years to do that not months not weeks years as for myself tonight I believe that right now God is training such men to meet the front line who are going through time shook from their feet sometime look like the whole thing is Fallen yet in the midst of it all they know the Living God and keep their face forward and when usually when God about to do something in the Supernatural Realms he usually gets a man that he could put his trust in and anoints him and sends him out and he is fearless at the job that's the kind of men we need today not polished scholar but men who know God in the power of his resurrection Oh you mean it have a scly knowledge and the power the resurrection knowledge that's right for instance there was a man in the Bible by the name of Moses who had got all his training he knew all theology he knew everything he should know he would have needed an education he could teach the masters of Israel in Israel or Egypt he didn't he didn't need one thing and the Bible tell us that he was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians why he could teach their Scholars he could teach their scientists he had keyed every point when it come to intellectual and yet here we go it take 40 years to beat all of that out of him out there in the Sands and when he got all his intellectual conceptions of God beat out of him out in the Sands the metal was ready to be molded over and that's the way God takes his men beats out all their fears all their intellectuals and when the Great Master Potter puts them on the wheel and begin to mold them over again Workman Worthy is God's man who could train a man more than God himself watch the way he trains him oh my hallelujah praise God hallelujah and we coming to Elisha Hallelujah learning to plug with 12 Uka oxen and if you take your eyes off the plug it Go Go zigzag It Go Go zigzag so he had to keep his eye Focus he had to keep his zero he got look back Hallelujah that when he when Elijah dro the man on him and pull it off so he said wait wait coming back he B the O he B the whole thing he was single focused he said coming after you I felt something I felt a power oh no church hold me how you hold me hallelujah hallelujah I want a manifested reality oh praise God Amen isn't that right amen so you had to train some men afterwards keep them on the Bible on the word lined up with the word say straight in line so God had to school him a little bit for ELA you T here for I'm going over to gigal the Lord has called me oh my hallelujah praise God thank you Jesus he went on the giggle place a Christian confession and baptism he said just now now that's that's that's good enough you me the confession that's good now watch that would have been all right for many Professor but he say stay right here but listen elishah couldn't think that way he he already felt the power of God see that's the problem people don't know God's power they know presence they never encounter Supernatural all the believer is intellectually what they're hearing as the word they're sincere they're believers they believe the word but but they never had a breakthrough experience like how Moses had it oh like how the children of Israel had it like how the people in the early years had it rather so Oh my he said let me tell you something now a man that ever tasted God will not be willing or cannot quench his thirst at a man-made system he can't do it all the theology they had at the school of the prophets could not quench The Thirst of that man of God he had a taste for God and they kept persuading him you should stay here why in 6 weeks oh just he said he said watch do you know your head will be taken away today he said yes I know it but hold your peace in other words save your breath don't try to tell me about it don't try to tell me what I'm doing I know where I'm going what I'm after God give us men like that God train men who knows not to wiggle off of this wiggle off and that I know I am going don't speak to me about it hold your breath don't try to discourage me because it's not going to do any good oh Hallelujah that's the the 54 Ministry in type Hallelujah no intellectual through them out actually the prophet said his not the prophet the spirit that took him he said no man can make them do otherwise no man no part of the planet Earth can make them do otherwise they have dust say the Lord or they keep still and dust say Lord coming from any Pulpit dust say Lord come from the prophet we have to say back what the TP say to bring it as thust say the Lord oh give the Lord a shout the B will have thust say why why because the spirit the prophet and the bride will be saying the same thing and what they say he make sure he made that will already be said in the word oh because that prophet of Malachi 4 is to reveal every mystery all the Mysteries is to be revealed by that Elijah all not not some all and if all has been revealed we don't need another man to come bring in like he could reveal something the prophet did not reveal he's a liar a false teacher a false prophet oh give the Lord some Praises all the mysteries of God would be revealed by that Elijah yes we could come and preach back the Mysteries we could come and unfold back the Mysteries but he has revealed every mystery oh give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah don't try to discourage me cuz it's not going to work Elisha said we are going to Jordan and the two went on God requires a Jordan in every life my Lord wow but said the old Prophet was really trying him out stay here stay there there some people they have a testimony I can give a testimony Saints the prophet told me to stay right here at bet in the last 40 years I am here at betal I am moving no Revelation none no vision that's why they better that's why they giggle that why they Jero that's why they stay there permanently they ding there but not elishah no no no no he caught a vision the vision was driving him so let's go not elishah not that man who had once been touched touched by God felt the power of the anointing upon him he said as the Lord lives as your soul never dies I will not leave you he had a purpose he saw the vision he knew what he was going to take place and they both went on to Jordan Jordan means debt there they stand I love this part The Old Man and the young man it represent Christ and his church and there they stood by the Jordan there she is coming down the judian hills the great riffles roaring like that elishah with his gray hair hanging down his back his dimmed old eyes looking across Jordan and the young man watching every move he made one the young man was waiting for vision to carry the will of God the other was going home my paw just raised when I read that hallelujah praise God the old man going home and the young man waiting for vision to do the will of God and when God Tak Elijah up he came back with a double portion of his Spirit he was ready for the Revival of them notice the man then a plow boy before God made his name Immortal I want you if it could connect with three dots between David Ministry Joshua Ministry and Elisha Ministry Elisha Ministry a plow boy unknown Hallelujah just from plowing the field God tell him that man go replace drop the mantle on him and the mantle Oh Glory that God fell on the day of Pentecost and that mantle that fell on Pentecost going and drop on a 5old Ministry one more time the spirit of Elijah Oh Glory to God will rest upon elishah there a fightful Ministry Oh Glory to God Elijah is a type Elisha is a type of that oh my praise God but bam said this notice the man then just a plow boy before God made his name Immortal all the prophets that stood around watching him had to bow to his feet because he had the power of God upon Him Hallelujah not books not coach not intellect not I get a revelation you know what come to me not that he had the power of God upon him all them Devils couldn't move when but BR was around they couldn't say a peep when he was around Oh Glory to God because they know God was with him oh Hallelujah that he said I take every Spirit under my control for the glory of God which man talking that talk now oh give the Lord a shout there's going to be adopted Sons with the ministry of Jesus Christ in the last days hallelujah then he prophesied after this year then he prophesied there is coming an hour when God Will Make the World bow at the feet of men and women who have plunged through and crossed Jordan did you hear that did you hear that prophecy there is coming an hour when God shall make the world bow at the feet of men and women that has plunged through and cross Jordan and separated them from the things of the world brother and sister tonight whatever you do whatever you think you cross J with God go over and separate and Leave the World Behind let God train you for his own service oh my Hallelujah we are living in a day before this revival and God is searching trying to find Hearts oh my Hallelujah so El likeah mantle is the spirit revelution 22:17 the spirit and the bride seek Come Oh Glory to God when God dro the mantle on the bride the bride will be given a Voice Hallelujah that's why he said the voice of God will be in her he will confound the church by the spirit and the bride he going to confound the world through them because the world is the church world the church message world is no longer speaking for God they speaking their own message they speaking the own Revelation they're making a mockery that we don't need a prophet they need then he get these guys God sent a prophet with all their messages for us to hear these guys with their thoughts and Revelation what about the prophecy that the prophet brought so I brought these three types to show you David's Ministry Joshua Ministry Elisha Ministry David Ministry dealing with the intellectual Joshua Ministry he Cross Jordan Elija Ministry Cross Jordan both debt have to die let's let's listen to what the prophet said about this fight for Ministry now lust for money lust for big things Lust For popularity these things are dead to the believer he said we don't care attend to a cage why should I care live or die sink or drown this is the things that I'm interested in the kingdom of God whether I maintain my home whether I maintain my family whether I maintain whatever it is let me maintain Christ Our Hope and Glory then he said this Build Me Up Oh Lord into this let Christ be my head that's working through me so this is Ministry now okay on my Foundation my faith that's in him let virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness working me oh lord is my prayer I don't care live or die sink or drun denomination or no denomination friend or friend let that work in me let Christ's virtue his knowledge flow out that I might be able to teach those let Christ virtue his knowledge flow out so he's not talking about Revelation here now he's talking about an actual possession and when we talk about virtue we're not talking about the text virtue or reading about virtue or using the word Virtue as virtue we're talking about what left Jesus when the woman with the blood is to touch him he said said I felt virtue left me I a talkinging about you tired Pulpit I talk about that kind of virtue please no we're not talking about that you're weary and you're tired like virtue leave you I'm not talking about that not that kind of virtue you're talking about I'm talking about the virtue that heals The Virtue that delivers the power Oh Glory to God that oozing out leaking out that man of God fivefold Minister it's going to be because they going to be some adopted Sons that's the fold Ministry you know the fold Ministry is really adopted Sons let me say it again the fold Ministry will be adopted Sons because adopted Sons will have the ministry of Jesus Christ Oh Glory to God for God has set in the church right after that he said let that work in me let Christ's virtue his knowledge flow out that I might be able to teach those for God has set in the church Apostles prophets teachers pastors evangelists all for the perfecting and he's detailing it now all for the perfecting you know Min like talk about for the perfecting Church no but here here all for the perfecting and bringing all these virtues into it oh that's different now that is more detailed of the description not just perfecting not just preaching and teaching but bringing the virtues into it how do we do that by a text by by a message we have to have that to impart that we have to have that in us to give out that all for the perfecting and bringing all these virtues into it for the Perfection of the coming of Son of God each one of these stones are a material off of that one this is the material of this each one of those virtues belong to him oh my oh blessed be the name of the Lord oh praise the name of the Lord hallelujah all right are you ready we're done yet we still in GE we still in the cockpit now what Jesus said watch this now the works that I do he's doing them right now but is speaking The Works that I'm doing now Healing The Sick raising the dead Open the Eyes of the blind these Works shall you do also you will do these if you believe in me you will do these works and then are greater than this shall you do for I go to my father little while the world will see me no more but you will see me I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world I would not leave you comfortless now notice here we go the Greater Works was to have the power in the church not only to heal the Sick by prayer or cast out Devils by prayer but to impart eternal life to Believers uhhuh now this takes in a different door all together this is a different door there's not there's a different door let me read it again now the Great Works was to have the power was to have the power in the church not only to heal the Sick by prayer cast out Devils by prayer but to impart eternal life to Believers the Holy Ghost was coming and giv into the hands of the church to impart life oh that's what Calvary meant it took stoop degraded men and women and lifted them into a place is to be Sons and Daughters of God to heal the sick and to impart eternal life by giving the Holy Ghost to obedient Believers men who were once unbelievers be made Believers and impart spiritual eternal life how much greater it is to say this sick woman laying here I can pray a prayer of faith and she'll be healed that's a great thing that's what he's doing then but he said greater than this shall you do I'm going to give you power not only to raise him up for a while but to give him eternal life which will be Eternal forever poor blind wretched people how do you miss that don't you see what the greater thing is the greatest thing that could ever happen was to impart eternal life to people what is eternal life the life that he lived the life that was in him imp part to others can a man do that a Son of God can a Vindicated son a son with the pillar of fire in him an adopted son with the Ministry of Jesus Christ oh give the Lord a praise offering there you are give the Lord a shout hallelujah glory to God hallelujah that's from that dead Calvary we know Paul had the Holy Spirit do you believe that when he was 14 days nights upon the sea without moon and stars right and he went down to the gallery to pray and he came back and told a man be of good courage for the angel of God whose servant I am came to me last night and said f Paul is that right not the Holy Spirit the angel of God sent from God not the Holy Spirit you said the angel now when John the Revelator the book of wrote I sent my angel Jesus did John fell them to worship the angel but the angel said stand up worship God see the true Angel won't stand to be worshiped he said he was of the prophets and his fellow servants that will signify these things therefore therefore Angelic beings is orain Ministers of God to come to the Earth to Bear record of God and they work through mortal beings just as they did through Daniel and back to the ages back there I believe it with all my heart so therefore friends as your brother that's all all I am but God's gift is the spirit of God that came down in the form of an Angel he didn't have wings he looked like a man I heard him when he walked just as that and walked on the floor walked right over just as normal as any man just stand there a man he comes time and time through the room and different places when I am fasting and praying the gift is the spirit of God that come down in the form of an Angel see that's the level the prophet was at when the angel was working with him in the early part of his ministry he said I represent the Faith by way of a Divine gift because the angel didn't come yet because he wasn't adopted yet for the angel to come into him to work with him in that way so he just had a gift he said I represent the Fai because the faith is God veiled oh hallelujah oh my let's continue we get in there we get in there I reckon the sufferings of this present time right now are not worthy to be compared with the glory which are revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creation waited for the manifestation of the sons of God isn't that right wait waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God it is waiting for the church to come into this position waiting God trying to place his church in position to manifest himself you see this is very important this morning because before you the Believers are placed the minister have to be placed let me say it again before the church is placed the fivefold ministry have to be placed because that is God's order that is just God's order so listen to this God trying to place his church in position to manifest himself getting one that he can work through like this and say there is my spirit flowing freely there it is I can work here for his Spirit to flow freely it means that man like a pipe you can blow right through there's no hindrance there's no self there's no Pride there's no personal ambition there's no issues he's like a pipe Spirit can flow freely it could flow there is my spirit flowing freely not coming down pouring out no flowing through him he becomes a Channel of God there's my spirit flowing freely there it is I can work here's I get another one over here Place him I can place him adoption placing manifesting adoption placing manifesting take him out there and put a ceremony on him visit him with an angel Oh Glory to God visit him with what an angel the gift of God the spirit working an angel when he comes to the pulpit the angel standing right there with him not a devil move until he say so oh give the Lord a shout hallelujah oh glory to God look at this Elisha following Elijah stay here stay here stay here notice when he accept the challenge across Jordan no more talk stay anywhere when he Cross Jordan what it is I could do for you he said double portion Hallelujah he said stay focused son if you see me go you can have it so he ain't watching newspaper he ain't watching magazine he not watching this and Facebook and seeing what people say no no no he watching the promise if you see me go you can have it now all the school of the prophets was watching you know they see when he went across with Elijah you know they saw Elijah open up the Jordan you know they know had no boat to come back he went by boat Hallelujah so when Elijah Elisha got the mantle and fit it on woo he thought he had it now he te up his own clothes his own ideas and put on the Rob of Elijah and he said wait a minute it like it more than this yes it more than all these quates yes I get the mantle is the word but where is the fire where is the power he take he where is the Lord God of Elijah and he take the man and struck the Jordan River and the River open up whatever other guys go see they watching from a far when they see elishah walking back with the man you know what they say the spirit of Elijah got rest upon Elisha Hallelujah troubl in the enemy's camp Oh Glory to God a man from obscurity brought to Jordan and come back with power oh Hallelujah so watch uh uh watch he get get one you work through I can place him adoption placing manifesting he said take him out here put a ceremony on him visit with an angel tell him something now if he told the truth if he making up something it won't work see no that won't work we have a lot of that I mean manifestations of sons of God when God manifests himself he sends them out and then he goes forth what he says is truth what he does is the truth what he does what he does he manifests Christ how do you judge him by the way he stays with the word right with the word see that's how you know all men by the way he stays with the word if they speak not according to the word there's no life in them oh my oh my Hallelujah let's go he presents his army in the form of five offices this is God now he presents his army in the form of five offices not playing a tape of brother bam in the church that is not his army he put an army of tape players the fivefold ministry is not people playing tape that is not the word that was never taught by the prophet that's a another teaching all together that that's off all right listen to what the prophet saying here he presents his army in the form of five offices first apostles prophets teachers pastors evangelist that's his army that's his soldiers that's his commanding officers all with the baptism of the Holy Ghost I wonder which one they say I won 24 hours you still be lost that is not that you're talking about here right all this Army here have the baptism of the Holy Ghost waiting out there to meet the enemy on any grounds he comes upon to meet the enemy with the word amen each one backing one another up not chopping one another up backing one up see that what the fivefold is true fivefold because spirit of God cannot behave in one man and misbehave in another man no something is wrong somewhere see each one backing one another up with him the chief Captain here we go here's the part the main part not out here in front not up here above not back behind but in them that's the Army glory to God the Army is God veiled it will become to the unveiling of the Mighty God in a fivefold Ministry God unveils the bride and the bride Church unveiled to the rest of the world oh give the Lord some Praises vindicating what his resurrection by the proof of his words my my my my Hallelujah I'm almost done okay so let's try now the ministry of Jesus Christ put a brand let's turn to Ephesians 4 this some perfect man he gave some Apostles some prophets remember the last night don't try to take another man's office some evangelists some pastors some teachers for the Perfection of the God does it read like that conans said no the Perfection of what the Saints who are the Saints the sanctifying one is that right Perfection of the Saints for the working of the ministry the ministry of Jesus Christ so the like just say perfecting the Saints but but the working part now working of the ministry which Ministry my Ministry no the ministry of Jesus Christ for the edif of the body of Christ amen for the building it up edifying until we come to the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the Assurance to the measure of the Statue of Christ oh my brother Brandon the denle church is in the lodan The End of the loudan Age the Jews are in the Homeland already there and the Gentile apostasy has already taken place we have a president like we have we have a nation is broke up like we have we have atomic bombs hanging in the hangers we have the church that's lukewarm we have a church a people that's draw themselves together we have a Ministry that pattern the ministry of Jesus Christ for to catch the stone when it comes so the ministry of Jesus Christ is not to say we have the ministry of Jesus Christ the ministry of Jesus Christ is to catch the stone when it comes what's left to happen it might be at any minute there is nothing else left we are the end time the church is weak the church is today we are broke up organizational Strife separation of Brotherhood Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Fess all kind of stuff we are broke up that's the way it's supposed to be you hearing that that is the way it's supposed to be it's got to be that way here we go then there will come a message you say oh Hallelujah we know that it's the same Pillar of Fire that L Israel we know that the same Ministry that accompanied Jesus Christ by that pill of fire that had him anointed is accompanying the church today so the church mashup and all these disagreements and all these arguments and bring no one and shake and whatnot that is how it's supposed to be but then they come for a god orain fightful Ministry with the pillar of fire Oh Glory to God with the ministry of Jesus Christ do you see it now hear This Ss that Pro Pro it we don't need that God has proved it we need the ministry of Jesus Christ to fit that headstone coming y that was brought the church into the place he's praying now father we realize that the church has come through the stage of justification come to the stage of sanctification come to the stage of the receiving of the Holy Spirit now the stones are being honed down for the fitting of the ministry of Jesus Christ to blend in to take the church and we get that last week Wednesday that Holy Spirit slot my almost finished but see could come up to the piano when a man in The Foundry is making a bell he has got a certain tone he has to put in it when he is setting this mold and putting his iron puts in so much brass so much steel so much coule why he knows exactly how much to put in and that's what Jesus has done by his bride he had to put in so much Luther so much Methodist so much Presbyterian so much Pentecost in it but what does he comes out with his own reflection what is it just like the pyramid message you see it's heaping right up this come to the minority with the headstone the ministry of Jesus Christ on Earth has to be the same as the ministry he had or he can't come to it just like the head to the feet the head feet is not the head but the head packs the feet the makes the feet tells it where to go wesy was a great light okay justification service time sanctification justification under Luther it had to come to sanctification under Wesley and sanctification service time until we come to the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the baptism of the Holy Ghost serve its time until the Holy Spirit which is only one God Blends into the church and the church into Christ it makes Jesus Christ reflected on the earth what he promised oh my I'm closing what ties all this together just referring and then we're going to close up you could begin to play something softly but even David anointed in the presence of his Brethren private literally and unknown God will Design the environment for David to come forward by his father being inspired to send David food for his brothers just when golad making his [Music] move God take David from the back and brought him to the front five-fold minister in type Hallelujah brought out of obscurity by [Music] manifestation but BR talk about Moses Minister Joshua he knew something had to take place he couldn't tell the people God called me angel spoke to me God tell me this aswi Moses no they had to be a manifestation that clearly identify that just as God was with Moses he was a Joshua [Music] Hallelujah before the people it can't be text it can't be scripture it can't be a message spoken it has to be a manifestation that come forth Elijah was the same thing oh my God hallelujah friends I trust that this would help you to realize it's not a game it's not a a verbal game it's not a messages game it's real but BR to come through all his processes lost his wife he lost his daughter he lost the anointing God squeeze him and press him until he come just like Jesus what about us we have our times ahead of us all this environment we in right now is part of what God set up what he has arranged for us to come through on top this game Let's bow heads Heavenly Father we thank you for your love and your presence and the audience here Lord I'm so privileged to have shared this Lord I'm not talking down to

capped Fill Me Lord with your love your presence and power to be a witness of the life and the resurrection of Jesus Christ poured upon your people father may they understand by Revelation inspiration the need to even pray for the ministry because the ministry must be placed first then they to can be placed for God a church that believe in the Holy Ghost is just as real when they are born and positionally born then God sets in the church pastors and teachers of high for Ministry and under the de of all the gifts returning oh God set the church in order father your Prophet say what we need
