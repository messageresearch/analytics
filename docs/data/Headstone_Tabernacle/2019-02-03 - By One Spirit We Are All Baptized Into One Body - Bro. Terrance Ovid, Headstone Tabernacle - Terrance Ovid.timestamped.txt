[16:29] says this is my covenant which he shall
[16:32] keep between me and you and thy seed
[16:35] after thee every man child among you
[16:38] shall be circumcised and he shall
[16:42] circumcise the flesh of your foreskin
[16:44] and it shall be a token of the Covenant
[16:47] betwixt me and you and he that is eight
[16:51] days old shall be circumcised among you
[16:54] every man child in your generations he
[16:59] that is born in the house or bought with
[17:01] money of any stranger which is not of
[17:04] thy seed he that is born in thy house
[17:08] and he that is brought with bought with
[17:10] I money must means be circumcised and my
[17:14] covenant shall be in your flesh for an
[17:18] everlasting covenant and the
[17:20] uncircumcised man child whose flesh of
[17:23] his foreskin is not circumcised that
[17:25] soul shall be cut off from his people
[17:28] for he hath he has broken my covenant
[17:32] when skipping down to verse 23 of that
[17:35] same chapter and Abraham took Ishmael
[17:40] his son and all that were born in his
[17:44] house and all that were bought with his
[17:46] money every male among the men of
[17:50] Abraham's house and circumcised a flesh
[17:52] of their foreskin and a self-signed a
[17:54] oscarbot had said unto him and Abraham
[17:58] was ninety years old and nine when he
[18:01] was circumcised in the flesh of his
[18:02] foreskin and Ishmael his son was two
[18:05] teen years overall when he was
[18:07] circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin
[18:08] in the selfsame was Abraham circumcised
[18:13] and Ishmael his son and all the men of
[18:15] his house born in the house and bought
[18:18] with money of the stranger was
[18:20] circumcised with him and now wanted to

[18:26] chapter 12 and we wanna just read one
[18:30] who's there who's 13 first Grainger's 12
[18:35] and verse 13 just one verse there that
[18:38] says for by one spirit are we all
[18:41] baptized a man into one body whether we
[18:45] be Jews or Gentiles whether we be bond
[18:48] or free and have been all made to drink
[18:51] into one spirit and got our blessing
[18:55] amen
[18:56] oh please go away man hallelujah glory
[19:01] to God thank you Jesus
[19:03] let's just bow heads over the prayer all
[19:07] Christians have any father Lord we come
[19:09] before you true enough grease on Melissa
[19:10] this afternoon through the speaking
[19:13] blood of the Lord Jesus Christ I've been
[19:15] speaking for seven church ages and
[19:18] speaking on our behalf this evening God
[19:20] your promise that every man child must
[19:23] be circumcised
[19:25] Lord this is the covenant the baptism of
[19:28] the Holy Ghost
[19:29] Lord you circumcised a hundred and
[19:32] twenty believers in the upper woman that
[19:33] they are Pentacles that was the Alpha
[19:36] Church receiving their portion you are
[19:39] the Alpha and you at the Omega here we
[19:41] are the Omega bride of Jesus Christ
[19:43] looking forward portion I was the
[19:44] Commission to get out of here
[19:46] Oh God a pretty angel of God the Holy
[19:48] Ghost Himself will drop down when amidst
[19:50] the smoke this evening Lord and inspired
[19:52] you water to the hearts on your trend
[19:54] I'm going to Accord each one feet Lord
[19:57] to believe Lord that they could be
[19:59] sealed today for we are in our revival
[20:02] we recognize our promise and we come to
[20:05] claim it Lord true father me anoint your
[20:06] word and me and speak to me to your
[20:09] people Lord I surrender myself unto your
[20:11] will received and have your perfect week
[20:13] for asking Jesus Christ's name Amen
[20:15] you may have a seat for thought this
[20:19] afternoon by one Spirit we are all
[20:23] baptized into one body as well Anthony
[20:28] read in John chapter 17 God came and
[20:32] told Abram this is my covenant after
[20:37] Abraham had fresh bread God after you
[20:41] went and took back lot for the kings had
[20:44] communion everything else after God make
[20:47] him partially sacrifice and do all those
[20:49] things in the time pass here is God
[20:52] coming to give him the final
[20:55] confirmation and change in his name
[20:59] is it this is the Covenant every man
[21:04] child in your house got to be
[21:08] circumcised if he is not he's going to
[21:11] perish and that seal of circumcision
[21:14] only represented the baptism of the Holy
[21:19] Ghost but every believer is supposed to
[21:23] have but a balun said that God made a
[21:26] covenant with his people and the
[21:29] Covenant is the baptism of the Holy
[21:32] Ghost which is the seed of Abraham so
[21:36] only until you get the baptism of the
[21:38] Holy Ghost
[21:39] you becomes Abraham's seed but form
[21:44] angel spirits has come known and people
[21:49] don't have a clue as to what is the
[21:52] promise they have knowledge they have
[21:56] wisdom they believe this way and that
[21:58] way but this evening I want you to see
[22:03] the reality of where you come from and
[22:06] where you will
[22:08] you only spray this morning true but you
[22:11] talk about the final battle took place
[22:13] in heaven good to be finished on it so I
[22:16] wanted to take you on a short journey
[22:17] before you get long interview
[22:19] circumcision to see what took place and
[22:23] if profits are going to see with your
[22:25] eyes of supernatural looking you know
[22:28] parabrahman spoke about seeing the white
[22:30] light before the dawn creating the will
[22:33] without going there we're going to see
[22:35] the war in heaven we're going to see
[22:37] what took place so I wanted to fasten
[22:40] your seat belt
[22:41] open your eyes are spiritual looking
[22:44] because we traveling at the fastest
[22:47] speed you could think about that's the
[22:48] speed of thought so we have arrived I
[22:51] can see the Great Spirit of Almighty God
[22:55] rotating through eternity and angels
[23:00] just rotating out of the Spirit of God
[23:04] could you see it if you could see its
[23:07] Amen because you have to see it with his
[23:11] supernatural
[23:11] eyes of looking ethical said he saw a
[23:14] great whirlwind out of the north
[23:16] I wasn't fooling the glory of God he saw
[23:19] everything come out of it when brother
[23:21] branham was seven years old a woman came
[23:24] in the poplar tree and the voice of God
[23:25] speak to Parapan am that was the Spirit
[23:28] of God in the form of a whirlwind so I
[23:30] wanted to see this Great Spirit of God
[23:33] spinning along in eternity and ensures
[23:36] this fly out of him
[23:38] can you see it right if you see it here
[23:43] is but a bun and said you are part of
[23:47] the angelic beings that rotated out of
[23:51] God
[23:52] and resisted the devil's life
[23:54] [Applause]
[23:57] so there is with your representation
[24:01] started as part of the angelic beings
[24:05] that rotated out of God
[24:07] [Applause]
[24:11] so watch there are angels that God
[24:15] created and your angels that rotated out
[24:19] of God so think about millions of angels
[24:23] all looking alike in heaven and some
[24:27] root eat a lot of God and some was
[24:30] created by God I'm going to create one
[24:33] special angel
[24:35] we call him Lucifer he was the son of
[24:38] the morning he was the anointed cherub
[24:41] that covered he was perfect in beauty
[24:45] until iniquity was firm with him
[24:48] now this particular angel didn't know
[24:51] who he was he was God ouch
[24:55] enemy God created his own enemy because
[25:01] God have to display his attributes all
[25:05] these angels only know about worshiping
[25:08] worshiping worshiping God but God is a
[25:10] God who might was Nevada power was about
[25:14] Dominion so he has to have something to
[25:17] express his might his power and his
[25:20] Dominion against so he created this
[25:23] beautiful angel called Lucifer son of
[25:26] the morning the anointed cherub that
[25:28] covered perfect in beauty and
[25:31] he Lucifer don't know who he is and
[25:34] god-given power because God don't want
[25:38] one advantage advantages you want a good
[25:43] adversary to have a good fight that is
[25:45] why you have to face your battles
[25:47] because you have to fight because you as
[25:49] bad of the angelic being that whatever
[25:51] god that resisted the devil's life so
[25:54] let me spirits have coming against you
[25:56] you have to have a good battle god set
[25:58] it up show public record set it up so
[26:04] every son that cometh to God must be
[26:06] tried must be tested I must be proven to
[26:09] be the right people son hallelujah glory
[26:16] to God so God gives Lucifer power he had
[26:23] power of transformation yet power of
[26:28] deception and yet one more power of
[26:33] perversion
[26:36] of deformation so yeah three degrees
[26:43] he was a doctor here a doctorate of
[26:45] deception a doctorate and transformation
[26:49] and a doctorate in deception think of it
[26:53] this man Lucifer
[26:58] but a Balaam said sit and thought he was
[27:01] good so here this he looked at himself
[27:07] and he saw his beauty he look at Michael
[27:12] Michael so simple there is no beauty and
[27:16] hamrick desire just simple and humble
[27:20] and meek and Michael controlling all the
[27:24] Angels they at his disposal and he was a
[27:29] shining angel Lucifer with all his
[27:32] beauty and he is not getting that
[27:36] worship so he decides in himself he will
[27:40] be like God I'll sit in the Mount of the
[27:43] Congress at the north and be worshipped
[27:46] because of my beauty and because of what
[27:49] is in me
[27:52] I wanted to follow carefully because we
[27:54] fight in these Devils from way back then
[27:58] you understand so he decide to walk up
[28:04] and down like when job God acts Satan
[28:08] where was he said walking to and forbid
[28:11] it the same thing Lucy if I was doing a
[28:15] heaven walking up and down with his
[28:18] beauty does in the Angels so angels are
[28:22] looking at this character and someone
[28:25] else in but isn't he beautiful the same
[28:30] suit Satan has created musical
[28:31] instruments in him you know all these
[28:34] things attributes was in him so he keep
[28:38] on doing this for quite a while until he
[28:42] believed he had the majority of the
[28:45] Angels on his side the Bible said put
[28:48] heads of the angels
[28:51] listen carefully so when the time came
[28:57] the tortoise if of the thought he was
[28:59] born what a word is a thought Express so
[29:05] he had to express his thoughts at one
[29:09] time
[29:10] so he made a declaration in heaven I am
[29:13] God I am the Holy Ghost the prophet said
[29:21] the Angels was never given to make a
[29:26] choice the angels in heaven was never
[29:31] ever given the opportunity to make a
[29:34] choice and he said whatever choice they
[29:37] make they cannot change the mind
[29:39] you said we could change our mind change
[29:42] about to have a nice idea and Tennessee
[29:46] but they cannot change the mind whatever
[29:48] decision they make we have to stay with
[29:52] it so when he made that declaration all
[29:57] the angels that believe him immediately
[30:02] was transforming the demons including
[30:05] Satan because of the transform important
[30:08] Satan the balance a marvel not that
[30:10] Satan to transform itself as an angel of
[30:13] light and his ministers as ministers of
[30:15] righteousness so when he spoke that word
[30:18] all these inches I believe him
[30:21] the turning to a demonic form I want you
[30:27] to see yourself in that great
[30:29] congregation as an angel that rotated
[30:32] out of God
[30:34] and next to you stands another angel
[30:38] just like you all of a sudden it turned
[30:41] to a demon what would you do they draw a
[30:44] sword and the war started
[30:48] why 11 so all these prayers I was in
[30:52] these bodies were cast down to the earth
[30:53] and all the demonic bodies was reserved
[30:58] in the chains of darkness for the end
[31:02] time
[31:03] all the bodies that these spirits was in
[31:06] the tented demons that was once angels
[31:08] there were so hideous that had to take
[31:13] them and put them in Chains of darkness
[31:16] but the spirits that inhabited the
[31:18] bodies came down upon the earth these
[31:21] are the spirits that we are fighting the
[31:24] prophets said the Spirit is harmless
[31:26] until they get a body to operate true
[31:30] there was a thousand there was a legion
[31:34] think of it it wipe out a whole shrine a
[31:38] thousand demon in legions and you was
[31:44] there in that battle and God put your
[31:48] tongue in it to finish the battle he
[31:52] said you are the physical manifestation
[31:56] of the attributes that you wasn't God
[32:02] so if you are that physical
[32:06] manifestation of the attributes that you
[32:08] wasn't God then the Spirit of God have
[32:12] to come down and see you with the Holy
[32:15] Ghost to make you a manifested attribute
[32:18] of Almighty God and yes ready battlers
[32:23] yes we're the battlers so these four
[32:28] means of quit coming the message and I
[32:32] tell people I am the only ghost the same
[32:34] declaration that Satan military some say
[32:42] when you believe this message they
[32:45] received the Holy Ghost same lion
[32:48] deceptive spirit remember you have a
[32:52] degree in deception and he deceived the
[32:56] people by the word he deceived Eve by
[32:58] the word he had not a different
[33:03] explanation for God that no think of it
[33:07] and is these Devils you gotta fight so
[33:12] some people think and I have the Holy
[33:14] Ghost I believe in the have the Holy
[33:17] Ghost when they don't have the Holy
[33:18] Ghost and looking for the Holy Ghost but
[33:22] by one spirit we are all baptized into
[33:24] one body Abraham had to circumcise his
[33:29] servants all the people was bought with
[33:32] his money they were a group of people
[33:34] that was covenanted by the seal of
[33:37] circumcision anybody else that was dead
[33:41] in so much so the Bible's like God
[33:46] sought to slay Moses after he
[33:48] commissioned him to go down to Egypt to
[33:51] deliver the children of Israel God
[33:52] looking the Slayer Moses in the in
[33:56] because Moses didn't circumcise his
[33:59] children she was returned forth was
[34:02] Moses forth so when his wife recognized
[34:05] what was taking place she circumcised -
[34:07] a bloody husband you are to me and you
[34:10] as an individual must be circumcised
[34:13] it's absolutely essential and compulsory
[34:17] and necessary that you receive the seal
[34:20] of circumcision of the baptism of the
[34:23] Holy Ghost
[34:24] you can be coming to this church and see
[34:26] a nice church and about your mission no
[34:29] you have to get the seal of circumcision
[34:32] for yourself you got to get desperate to
[34:35] hold on that you wanted your child cry
[34:38] out and report them to baptize you with
[34:40] the Holy Ghost
[34:46] it's a desperate time is that desperate
[34:51] Oh weather Brandon said if you don't
[35:01] have the baptism of the holy lose it
[35:04] means God has not recognized your feet
[35:09] because when God recognized your feet he
[35:13] put fire upon your feet by the baptism
[35:17] of the Holy Ghost is that when I got the
[35:20] Holy Ghost then you make yourself a
[35:22] Christian you could preach 2nd Archangel
[35:32] because cast out Devils we could dance
[35:35] on his perch because prophesy because do
[35:38] all these things and still don't have
[35:39] the Holy Ghost I want you to see the
[35:44] reality of the hour what you have to get
[35:48] jesus said so
[35:53] you have to read between the lines
[35:54] listen Jesus said many will come to me
[36:00] in that deal and say Lord have that I
[36:04] preach in your name I thought I cast out
[36:06] Devils in your name have a tie he
[36:08] listened to him and I said to them
[36:10] depart from me you workers of iniquity I
[36:14] knew you not the Prophet said the word
[36:21] dear is the same word that is written
[36:24] translation and Adam knew his wife Eve
[36:27] and she bought what set it mean he
[36:32] didn't put his Holy Spirit in the person
[36:35] he never had a personal experience in
[36:39] their lives but I was doing these things
[36:43] life it
[36:45] remember the disciples was commissioned
[36:48] to do the same with all the illegals and
[36:51] yes they met a brother doing the same
[36:55] thing and he was with them and they come
[36:59] to Jesus they say master you know with a
[37:03] guy casual devonee not with us
[37:05] we wanted a stop you know he said no
[37:07] leave him if he is not against me is for
[37:10] me
[37:12] and people are sitting down in the
[37:13] message commented church and been fine

[37:40] new season the oil spirit identify as
[37:43] whose a street what was taking place see
[37:46] more prophesy inside what a hundred
[37:48] years after and going to have a great
[37:51] revival but it would be individuals he
[37:56] said that all the men in the power of
[37:58] the Spirit what it is the manifestation
[38:00] of the sons of korah eternal contain as
[38:04] individuals possessing the individual
[38:08] inheritance in the promised land
[38:10] [Applause]

[38:15] fight and pray fight the devil's I want
[38:19] to keep you from getting the Holy Ghost
[38:21] you got to wrestle not let go the angel
[38:25] until he sees you with the seal of the
[38:27] Living Corder
[38:29] [Applause]
[38:37] some people say it's not the baptism of
[38:40] the Holy Ghost is they seed in the soul
[38:44] i seed in the soil
[38:48] it's just a seed it got to be quickened
[38:52] by the Holy Spirit
[38:57] [Music]
[38:58] it got to be quickened by the Holy
[39:01] Spirit
[39:04] this thing is so real friends when you
[39:09] see the reality of the our time is short
[39:12] if you want to be lost focus where time
[39:15] is short
[39:16] it is the acceleration of ripening so
[39:21] God is telling you about that with
[39:22] Seymour what happen Azusa Street to
[39:26] anoint your feet to get desperate like
[39:30] Seymour get desperate because everybody
[39:33] was against them the earth was against
[39:34] them and the odds are against us the
[39:40] odds are against us everybody settle
[39:44] down in the message and the technical in
[39:47] the rapture you're not going nowhere
[39:52] they got to be born again by the baptism
[39:57] of the Holy Ghost and then you grow up
[39:59] for the Holy Ghost itself to come
[40:07] he said the baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[40:09] the seed of God one time he said is the
[40:15] seed of Abraham
[40:22] he prophesied the manifestation of the
[40:26] Holy Ghost operating is his children is
[40:29] the seed of the itch yet the
[40:34] manifestation of the Holy Ghost
[40:37] operating in his children he holy verse
[40:40] but to be operated and you the Holy
[40:43] Ghost got to be moving Alleluia with
[40:47] sighs with my purse with one mass
[40:50] disciple to follow the believer not
[40:53] believer following signs this is the
[41:02] reality but let me tell you this God
[41:07] sent a super saying to this generation
[41:12] but the bernam went to Grass Valley
[41:18] in 1962
[41:22] he had some places lineup to go to and a
[41:26] whole set up ministers come together and
[41:28] it was discussing doctrinal things up
[41:32] where bands who decided to him don't far
[41:34] system please
[41:34] this is a voice spoke to him I see
[41:36] Jessie I see Grass Valley and call
[41:40] butter borders was his mange time and if
[41:44] there's anything in Grass Valley so here
[41:47] it is for ministers in four different
[41:51] changes for different Pentecostal
[41:55] churches in Grass Valley is spring for
[42:01] Evelyn can a son and then when but I
[42:06] borders check it if I know these guys
[42:08] one by one to come then he said sister
[42:11] Adam bite always acts him the Gulen
[42:12] Grass Valley so if you don't Grass
[42:14] Valley to minister he preached five
[42:17] messages the first one was says we will
[42:20] see Jesus when he finished preach that
[42:24] message he had a hidden line is every
[42:28] couple was everybody was his love his
[42:30] message say preach to vichara part one
[42:34] trapa to trap a stream then he preached
[42:37] a super sign
[42:40] he used Isaiah 7:14 to preach the
[42:47] message called super sign if you read
[42:52] Isaiah chapter 7 will realize that Syria
[42:58] and Israel had Confederated to lick
[43:03] Judah they wanted to fight Judah and
[43:06] wipe off Judah a house or the king
[43:10] God said Isaiah said tell him do
[43:13] whatever they I go fight a battle field
[43:15] and Isaiah ax ears ask God for a sign
[43:24] because borders give people signs to
[43:28] confirm what able to do they generally
[43:30] go back this August so ah
[43:33] the King said I am NOT asking God for no
[43:36] sign he believed what would do it
[43:39] he had no sigh you know God said he said
[43:43] that the Lord will give them a sign
[43:45] prophesied a virgin shall conceive it

[43:56] good boy himself Kodama sign
[44:00] yes I'm sure in Grass Valley brother
[44:04] branham give a sign for the world
[44:07] message would I hear what he said he
[44:12] said when that church strike the power
[44:17] of God the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[44:23] outside of the denominational churches I
[44:27] want to say it again maybe a girl get it
[44:33] all the denominations churches was
[44:37] seeking the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[44:39] and was having experiences with the
[44:42] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[44:44] in a measure evenly catholics of the
[44:47] charismatic was having that all that
[44:50] them was having that but the profit is
[44:53] prophesized something different he said
[44:57] when the church strike that power of God
[45:03] the baptism of the holy ghost outside of
[45:07] the dimensional system of churches
[45:10] outside the Catholic Church wherever it
[45:13] is he said when the baptism of the Holy
[45:17] Ghost is may agree to the people he said
[45:22] damn that is predestinated like you are
[45:27] here take care my life see it and walk
[45:31] in it what is it a super sign a super
[45:36] sign
[45:38] [Applause]
[45:46] so God sent a super-sized
[45:50] in 1983 1984 1985 what same as super
[46:01] sign to the message will and they
[46:05] rejected you know what they say they say
[46:10] we're going back to Pentecost but we
[46:14] profess a Pentecostal bajo Comerica
[46:42] Durazo
[46:50] [Applause]
[46:50] [Music]
[46:53] [Applause]
[46:54] [Music]
[46:56] [Applause]
[46:59] [Music]
[46:59] [Applause]
[47:01] [Music]
[47:03] oh my god my god father what's going on
[47:05] here Oh Lord Jesus
[47:07] oh my god
[47:23] hello glory to God thank you Jesus
[47:29] Oh My Lord my God my father hallelujah
[47:38] glory glory glory glory glory hallelujah
[47:41] my Jesus my Jesus hallelujah hallelujah
[47:46] hallelujah hallelujah oh boy yes oh my
[47:51] god hallelu listen to me friends the
[47:57] testimony of Jesus is the spirit of
[48:00] prophecy so all that is about to happen
[48:05] has already been prophesied in the word
[48:07] to happen so but a Branham little that
[48:13] prophesy in that message is super Sayan
[48:16] and then is a message Vijaya he was
[48:21] speaking about the former in and the
[48:25] latter in going to fall and why he was
[48:31] speaking that the spirit of prophecy
[48:34] drop upon him and he said God is going
[48:38] to send the baptism of the Holy Ghost in
[48:40] such a way upon planted word it going to
[48:44] restore and he stopped right here
[48:47] he didn't restore what but is thwarted
[48:50] by tree
[48:55] he bring it more specific the baptism of
[49:01] the Holy Ghost upon planted with cuenca
[49:06] sua who plans in the world the son of
[49:09] man is he saw this was really good seed
[49:12] the seed of the chair the kingdom and
[49:16] the people that manifest the world a
[49:18] voice for the edge which will live and
[49:19] he chanted kingdom for the Aged so you
[49:22] got to manifest the world evolved for
[49:24] your age
[49:24] you've got to receive your Pentecostal
[49:27] outpouring of the baptism of the holy
[49:30] ghost and shia
[49:31] hallelujah glory to God he made it more
[49:41] specific listen in 1982 I stood Umbra
[49:50] nights father's house
[49:53] in the drawing when a bunch of young
[49:56] people and see the power of God come
[50:00] down and slay every one of those young
[50:04] people on the go one sister started sing
[50:11] like an angel
[50:13] her lips was hardly moving
[50:16] she was singing there is a river and
[50:18] aside all these windows were open and
[50:22] half music pipe organ music was just
[50:27] filling the whole house accompanying the
[50:32] sisters sing like an angel on the ground
[50:35] it was such an experience but a night
[50:40] father came and look in his mind was
[50:43] blown his oh my god
[50:44] what dooms is true and you run to
[50:46] Policastro Prakash is an open D cursor
[50:49] under Castro walk up the driveway eat
[50:54] everyone eyes father I said that is the
[50:55] Holy Spirit leave that the people left
[50:57] their homes and came all outside the
[51:02] building all of these steps they want to
[51:04] see what is happening this is Minister
[51:06] 10 we cannot make no noise after 10
[51:11] because they could call the police these
[51:14] children groaning and on the ground we
[51:18] have to enter okay we got to lift them
[51:20] up and put them on chairs Saddam they
[51:22] drunk in the spirit not one of them
[51:26] claimed they receive the baptism of the
[51:28] Holy Ghost but they had an experience
[51:31] with God and the spirit of prophecy came
[51:35] not amongst them but abandom said they
[51:37] spread of prophecy could come on one
[51:39] place in the day and never come back
[51:40] again
[51:42] it comes somebody else and I see that
[51:44] with my own eyes and one of the things
[51:47] that was said to the young people is
[51:49] that do not follow your friends your
[51:54] friends don't know the way I am doing
[51:57] and I will baptize you with the Holy
[51:59] Ghost that was 1982 in 1982 Burakumin
[52:04] prophesy the baptism of the holy ghost
[52:07] beyond poor in 1983 and it did and it's
[52:12] sweet you will it went to Europe to
[52:15] England to Chile all over and the whole
[52:18] message will recheck that super sign but
[52:22] listen that was the birth of the infant
[52:27] China in the message but now after 36
[52:32] years the child has grown up the child
