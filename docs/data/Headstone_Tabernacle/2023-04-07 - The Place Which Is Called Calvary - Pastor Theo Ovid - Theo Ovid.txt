your love and for the most Cedar to extend towards us through the Christ Spirit Calvary and we come to commemorate that day to day I pray that something we said in your word that would move us closer to you father Lord yourself any man come after you let him deny himself take up the cross and follow may we follow today Father in obedience to your word and to your will then Jesus might ask it amen God bless you and thanks so much for coming if every Bible I'd like you to turn to Luke chapter 23 we want to read verse 18. I'm going to say we're going to go down all the way down to 47 just one scripture and they cried out all at once or we will this man speaking about Jesus release on this Barabbas and Barabbas have a reputation already who for certain citizens made in the city for murder was cast into prison pilot therefore willing to release Jesus speak again to them but they cried said crucify him crucify him he said unto them the third time why what evil had he done or these are cinnamon in power talking to him religious people people foreign of death in him I will therefore chastise him and let him go and they were instant with Lord voices required that he might be crucified and the voices of them and of Chief priests prevailed loudmouth win and pilate gives sentence that it should be as they required and he released something to him him then him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison whom they had desired but he delivered Jesus to their will and as they let him away delayed Hoon upon one Simon a cyrenian coming out of the country and on him they lay the cross that he might bear it after Jesus and they followed him a great company of people of women which also be wailed and lamented him but Jesus turned into them said Daughters of Jerusalem weep not for me but weep for yourselves and for your children for behold the days are coming in which they shall see blessed are the Bahrain and the wombs that never bear and the pups which never gives suck they shall then shall they begin to see to the mountains fall on us onto the hills cover us for if they do these things in a green tree what shall be done in a dry and there were two also also two other money factors led with him to be put to death and when they will come to the police which is called Calvary the police dear de crucified him animal factors one on the right hand at the other on the left then said Jesus father forgive them for they know not what they do no this is asking for forgiveness for the people who just shouted crucify him and departed his riemens and cast lots and the people therefore beholden rulers also with them divided them saying he saved others let them save himself if he'd be the Christ the chosen of God soldiers also mocked him coming to him often in vinegar and saying if Dolby the king of the Jews save thyself a superscription was written over him in letters of Greek Latin Hebrew this is the king of the Jews and one of the many factors which were hanged hanged real on him saying Adobe Christ saved thyself on us and the other answer rebuked him seeing thus thou not fear God seen the god in the same condemnation and we indeed justly for we receive the due reward of our Deeds but this man have done nothing amiss and he said unto Jesus Lord remember me when all comments into thy kingdom and Jesus said unto him very nice unto thee today shall thou be with me in Paradise was about the sixth hour there was Darkness over the Earth until the ninth hour and the sun was darkening the veil of the temple was rent in the midst and when Jesus had cried a lord voice he said father in the dining hands I commend my spirit and having set us you give up The Ghost and when the Centurion saw what was done he glorified God saying certainly this was a righteous man that God bless his word you may be seated or praise God so this is the scripture for today and I trust them that this word will edify you and help you strengthen you and get you see a fresh view of Calvary and across from this partner in Greece that has come to that will come to your life who prays the name of the Lord Hallelujah I wonder why we make up people get so hard-hearted as to see such a righteous man bread fed multitude raise the dead yield is sick and to crucify him you know they talk about Joseph hated without a Cause there was no cause to hit him but he hated him all the same and if his Spirit come into you don't you think that you wouldn't be hated you would be rejected like he was because he was rejected of men Express what excuse do you have of your behavior of your attitude of your actions the price of sin was dead God is uncompromising with his word with his cousins and his Blessing if God said he's going to bless you nothing can cancel that his Blessing is determined his Christians is also determined he told his own children the day you eat thereof that day you die like why not even message or not you will die if you eat that word doesn't matter if you're books if you have your Bible you will die some people go to hell you know we don't believe that sometimes but people will go to hell people want hell every day people go to heaven every day Hallelujah because God have to keep his word and God wants to come in obedience to his word we can't be hearers over only we have to be doers now they are hearers and they are heroes and doers because that's why they are they separated it don't be heroes on me but doers of the word it's not something there praise the name of the Lord no the Bible speaks about all things happen for all examples to whom the ends of the world have come people called out and judged how people call out and they miss the mark people will call out being called is not good enough coming out is not good enough believing is not good enough it has to go beyond that you have to want to go beyond where you are it has to be a choice it has to be a decision you have to make the decision it is never a group thing I may say good it's not never a family thing this ever does cause shall you leave your mother and father isn't that right praise God or rather he said he that not or forsake mother father and brother and doesn't follow me it's not worthy of me they come to bring a sword in the family so you can't take a family stand you're foolish to take a family's done you have to take a word stand I don't care what the rest of the family believe you have to stay with the word I don't care about your mama leave your father believe is what does the word say mama father brother Uncle Auntie it doesn't matter there's another family business this is a human God business you call you an individual what they call your family God call you if God call your family is one by money calling them when you're crossing the Jordan is one by one you're Crossing we are going to the Grave you going to the Grave not we are going nowhere every corner other individual oh give the Lord some praises Lori look what some people have no second chance this might be your only chance that thief on the cross had a chance of Glory to God although there is so much dimensions in this script that we just read There were so much things happening present and behind the scene Oh Glory to God that script is so powerful because when Jesus died the veil of the temple was rent people wasn't seeing that you know but a lot of things and different dimensions happen Oh Glory the content praise God hallelujah you don't even know what happened today and Tiffany mentions even while the world is going forward Lord will god notice being served by the quickening power upon your cancer upon your tumor upon your sickness upon your condition the house are hell given way to the name of Jesus Christ glory to God Jesus died on the cross that he can have a triumphant Let the church defeated a church triumphant over sickness over disease over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth [Applause] she just died he could have a cute triumphant triumphant means having Victory you know you ever see pictures of Hitler coming out and he's smiling and coming through at the triumphant France he conquered France he conquered German he conquered this place and that place and his big smile and all his soldiers and Army and whatnot he didn't see his end because everything have a beginning of the end any man could go and die but Jesus rose from the dead that makes a difference the calculator dead man Hallelujah he done dead already you can't kill a dead man he's done dead already you know something dead and he's coming down upon the church as a Capstone Oh Glory to God did you get that did you get that church that resurrected anointing that Superior anoint him that Supreme anoint him coming upon a church no wonder the popular problem said I praise God nothing gonna stop this Pride she will be an invincible Army an army that cannot be defeated not even by the world country churches [Applause] your problems are temporary your situations are temporary your bills are temporary the pressure's around you right now with a temporary see that's temporary don't even consider it don't even consider it or even consider it no consideration the temporary or can the Lord a shout in the house we blame me until Fahrenheit but joy comes in the morning or you're weeping your weeping but they're weeping are forever tears in the favor Oh Glory the court problems not forever troubles is not forever oh God help me Jesus

[Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] yeah if those crimes and Pharisees that said crucify him understood what that meant they never sacrucify him because when he died it means the book was coming back when he died it means the power was coming back when he died it means the sons of God was coming back he was going to triumph over death hell on the grave nobody knew the mystery of what was beyond that debt but when Jesus rose we know there is life there is triumph and power there was Victory power he said before as I live you shall live also or give the Lord a shout God you're great here lion your bossy back lying your back pain line like temporary stuff you think on the other side you're in you're in half blind you're blind you're this that what kind of whole pain you don't have that on the other side or as I kill all of that praise God praise God hallelujah your youth is temporary praise God just don't get old okay the Lord I praise Hallelujah we shall be in a land where we will never grow old praise God that songwriter said never grow old never call to a land where we will never growl or we on our way to that land I pick up a wife on the other hand I pick up three sons on the way to that land I break up daughter-in-laws I pick up grandchildren but we on our way to that land Oh Glory to God be unaware praise God we move from this building to that building the hill but we're on our way to that land praise God we're working on the way to land we retire we're still on our way to the land the devil's a liar we have eight if a man dies shall he live again Jesus answered that question you answer that question the devil only your power until death Beyond Death he had no power he could only beat you up beat you up tap you up and let it die after that no power the power finish that is why when you die out he has got power over you praise God if you die out if you could die to yourself the devil have no power over you whatsoever or give the Lord some praises hallelujah hallelujah praise God let's go the people in the Old Testament were overthrown reason after God did so much for them they begin to do things by rituals I was in a service in Congo and the people at the altar and the pastor called me inside and say you know show me one two brothers you see they coming to church and they are the alternate but they still go to the beach doctor and he don't understand it and I began to understand that some people this Jesus is another God he is an addition to what you already have whatever they have Jesus come to Canada and there's some people Jesus is another God the money is the god the family is the god the guy is the god and it comes with you know and they go wherever she has to give them the ticket I am mine if you bless me but that is not what this Bible is about he is God and God Alone he said I look around and there is none else beside me not only left not only right he is God alone or some desert and if he is who he is he deserves our all not some all that wearing job lost his family he said the Lord give it another word why this happened to me no no no he didn't say that he said the Lord give it the Lord take it away blessed be the name of the Lord that is how you have to talk and everything your day blessing bless God it's your loser blessing bless God this happened bless God that happened bless God what you expected didn't happen all of us have things in our mind and God not working according to your thoughts he said you're passing out my thoughts not what you think not what you feel is what he said and we could trust him he captures your father your mother your brother you can't trust this one and that one but anything he said you could trust you could brush your soul on it you can't lie Oh Glory to God the Biden Isaiah said he was wounded for our transgression and Jesus wasn't even born yet he was wounded for a transgression he was bruised all iniquities this is typement of Peace was upon him and by his choice we are healed it was a prophecy that Christ was going to be crucified they had to do it and certain things people have to do or give the Lord a shout to get the best all the words out to you or give the Lord some praises [Applause] [Music] [Applause] when things happen to you it brings either the best or something under with so all these things happened so examples he said no watch this you know because they could do all the rituals and all the orders and everything else that would require and their heart wasn't right with God so that's why they come obedience is better than sacrifice now we can do many things we can take communion we can be baptized we can come to church have our names in the book and just as respect and reverence as we can be and still be lost respectful nice people and lost we could just rejoice when the spirit will fall in a meeting where the world has been preached our souls will just rejoiced with the word and still be lost the rain falls under Justin the unjust the same Marine that makes the wheat grow makes the weed grow it's the nature of the product it's the nature of what it tells what we are therefore it's the nature that is in us that tells what we are so it's not not we might be so religious till we could turn our hands on Sunday to not wouldn't do a thing on Sunday because today is Sunday we might not even take a stitch on our clothes on Sunday we might not even feel Justified to buy food on Sunday they're not spiritually that's right you switch it just started this Sunday so they'll be even a certainly on Sunday all right watch we might be so religious and so Pious but yet we are not literally born again of the spirit of God we are worshiping in vain now it's pretty stiff but we want to really find it and know the truth because remember we are not going to get a second chance at this it's just this one time so you better be sure you want to be sure everything is fine and we come back to the two teams on the cross two Mali factors the two Crooks the two criminals one says why does save yourself and save us to so he's still looking for a Escape he's still looking for a way out of the justification of his judgment the other one rebuked him on the cross man busting rebuking across he said but you you're a whole Thief like he always camp like you but you you're getting we getting what we deserve what does man do this is just they hanging on the cross there you know one chance to say the right thing one chance you know two words remember me my money when you're coming to your kingdom Oh Glory to God what a chance oh my my whole poetry is in the thinking about it chance to see the writing a chance to let Angels come your way a chance to let the pillar of fire come inside your home a chance I'm taking a chance to say the right thing to act the right way that God could come and step into your situation oh Gloria God to step into your midst to step into your problems the step into your praise God taking a chance Gloria our King may not obtain to tell you like it is we will not bow down and if our God don't deliver us we're still not gonna bow down we still not gonna go back in the world we're gonna stay with the word Oh Glory to God he did sometimes hotter we still not bow and down because he does sentiment hotter it doesn't matter and when they step there the king stepping with them the Fourth Man In The Fire praise God let's go now so therefore it's not religious behavior and I think that the message will has come to that where people go to church traditionally you know they know they know the routine you have a song servicing have a special and music and everything else and and praise God by us here we might jump up a little bit so other places they might just sit down right true but it's traditional nothing different we do every Sunday but I dare you to do something different I dare you to step out of your your your comfort zone step out of what your customers step out praise God you have to do that for something to happen praise God when when they start a cry for Jesus they're crying at him he said woman no weep for me we pray children weep for yourself weep for your children praise God you already overcome when did you overcome in the gardener Gethsemane when he had a prayer meeting when the decider was snoring and sleeping they couldn't watch one hour but he was pushing and persevering if it is possible not go let this cup pass Let Us Go pass but if not possible let thy will be done he was he was in a battle a battle between his will and God's will who give the Lord a shout in the house you have your will God win forces will upon you you don't want to serve God you don't want to serve God you want to save God you want to save God it's your choice your mother here your father Jagged here your grandmother somebody pull inside of here you don't want to come you don't want to come that is your choice God put choices out of you praise God but choices of consequences seen and unseen praise known and unknown Oh Glory to God have consequences that go with choice or give the Lord a shout you have a choice to praise God that's when this evening you have a choice to keep him all quiet and still you have a choice to raise your hands you have a choice that thank God in advance for the victory that is coming your way that's your choice praise God you can wait for victory and then praise God or you have to praise God in advance because you know I've never seen a righteous forsaken or a seed beg bread the devil is a liar you're not going to go into poverty you're not going to lose your house you're not going to lose your life come on Save and somebody look at me started this evening be super Victorious all-powerful prayer answering God yeah praise God praise God praise God everything [Applause] this anointing you feel it's because the calvary when his blood cell was broken when the spirit was in the blood the life was in the blood and when the piercing and that blessed was broken the spirit was released and that anointing went throughout all the Earth to find you in Trinidad to find you in the bush wherever you're from if you're living in a tree you have to find you you live in the set behind God's back you have to find you okay the Lord some Praises you couldn't miss it if a child that's why you're supposed to have a shout this evening that's why you can't sit down dead like on a dawn ill praise God there's no dumb dog in Israel open your mouth and give God a shout them in here they shout inside the house I look at your knee hurting you if you're back pain this morning and praise God hallelujah I don't care praise God or even bring that up Glory [Applause] [Music] [Applause] foreign [Applause] listen to this at Calvary God came down and took the body of his own son in which he had lived and ripped it apart a Calvary his bleeding wounded cut and the spear running there ripped him apart his blood gushed out he said father into their hands I commend my spirit he bowled his head the Earth shook the Lightnings Flash and the Thunder's roared God was writing his Everlasting Covenant God was written his Everlasting Covenant then he took this dead body from the grave on the first day of the week brought it up to heaven Saturday as a high priest as a memorial sitting there perfect forever and he sent the spirit here we go he said the spirit that he tore out of that body right back down on the church and the church are you ready and that church will have to have The Same Spirit that was in that body or it won't the tail with it in the resurrection and if this church isn't perfectly exactly the same spirit that was in the Christ you will never going to rapture so this is I never go now if you listen to Wednesday night service you're here if that same spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwell in you you're going to Quicken your mortal body Oh Glory the quickening power go be on the inside you can miss the Rapture when the rapper is in you you are carrying a Rapture oh give the Lord has shout in the house Oh Glory to God you're carrying your own body change or give the Lord some praises Oh Glory to God hallelujah hallelujah my God this messages are locking the religious mind the messaging because they believe by the brand and the holy rapture All Your Love could be with you is that right as I'm fine Prince to that statement you know when you get insurance again think you see something in big big blacks don't watch that too hard as I'm fine right didn't do something I take magnifying glasses here as you real deal on the day and refined writing if this church isn't perfectly exactly the same spirit that was in Christ you were never going to rupture so therefore the same spirit that was in Christ has to come forward and that coming forward means that the token being displayed not just inside now it had to come on outside people have to say sir we're busy Jesus and you have to be able to show it Dr Jesus is looking for is in you you have to be able to show that is inside of you you know I believe him too you know you see when the Greeks came to disciples and said so we would see Jesus they may bring the Greeks to decide and get them interpretation they bring him check to Jesus and Jesus said except a corner of it falls in the ground and die it abides alone so he's pointing them to where they could see him which was this deer Calvary is a place another place that is called Calvary a lot of people duck that place huh they have other streets that you could go down to so Jonah was called take a take a ship elsewhere you buy a ticket it's expensive to get to him go in the wrong direction and God rocked you in a boat good rocking so hard when they say somebody had to be a sinner when is he Sinners talking about sinners you know them Sinners had to talk about oh God we are sin but this was not a big big sin for this person is me it is right knew it was him and sometimes when God jammed so you know it's you you know you might be confess it but it's you it's usually Troublemaker Jonah

to go to my father the devil can cut you off from your father you are son you are a daughter you have a right Heir you're glory to God [Music] hey Hey listen let me see then this could be red I have so much different inventions in it when Christ died the veil of the temple was rent no the people at Calvary there not seeing that you know that happened to the side the scriptures brain record of all these things taking place the pie priests alone only had access to the inner Veil but when Christ died God busted the veil to show any man woman child boy girl sinner could access this present success this Glory can access that's what carries about well Glory has already broke down that tradition of the elders he busted the traditional of the high priest and all of them what was hidden was no longer hidden he passed the fail from the top to the bottom they give you the believer direct access or Clarity of God and I'm saying today you have direct access the presence direct access the power direct access the healing direct access to Deliverance [Applause] [Music] Direct [Music] [Applause] I need pastors here to come to he's a liar false prophet and a man that presented himself between you and that Calvary their faults presenting his beef to the Branham he said that was the deed of the price was paid same question was started forever it opened up the way into this thing that we're hungry and twisting for it brought a place of satisfaction there's no man that ever visited Calvary and seen it the way it was that can be the same everything that he desired along for is met when he reaches that place an important day an important thing it shook the world it shook the world like it never shot before when Jesus died at Calvary and question on the same question oh Satan was not taught at Calvary prove it was the greatest price was ever paid the only one that could pay it come and doesn't recovery and there that great price was paid is not right he said no watch when the doctor gave a man an Aesthetics it knocks him out before he can do it when he could operation and when God give the operation for the church it got a world of Aesthetics nature had a convulsion no wonder God and human flesh was dying it was the all the world had looked for yet many of them did not know like it is today many look for these things yet they don't recognize them they don't realize the way out they're still trying to seek pleasures and things of the world trying to find their way out when Jesus died country one of a good wrap up here he broke the powers of Satan he opened the prison doors of hell to every man that was shot upon this Earth in prisons fearing that when he died the death would be to him on Calvary opened those cell doors let every captive Go free you don't have to no longer be torn down by sin you don't have to be no longer yield your members to sin drinking smoking gambling telling lies you can be honest just upright and Satan can do nothing about it do I ever tell yourself well I'm a small City other people said into you know God doesn't all let me do not do you know you understand saying he said you can be just upright see like nothing about it because you got a whole other line a lifeline is anchored in the Rock of Ages already on page five there's 11 pages in our Trend learn pages and are struggling to get to this there was never a day like it there will never be one like it it is not necessary no more the price is paid and we are redeemed thanks Peter God we are redeemed there is no way to for you to wonder about it there's no way guessing about it it's all took away and redeemed I like to put it like if uh you pay for a piece of furniture in court so some company and you have the receipt the furniture Rich home yet but you have the purchase in price you have the evidence of purchase the receipt that you have is evidence it was paid for it hasn't been delivered yet so Christ paid for us we have come to all yet but yeah the receipt is there this day what produce a receipt I died for them when they accused come to Point At You he said he said I died for them that's why I died for my blood for that's why I pay the price for that's why I say it's finished I pay the price for their Redemption I pay the price for their sin which is present since Futures in all sin the blood of the torn for that or give the Lord some praises that's why he chose you when when you behave nice when you're a nice big when you're dressed long he throws you before the thunder in the world before the foundation of the world he knew you would take a choice to to dress properly and just modestly he knew you will do that put your name on the book and say Satan that's my daughter you know you could try but you wouldn't get through or give the Lord a shout that's my son you know you could try but you can't get through when that anchor and her soul no devil can't stop it Jesus himself said Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell will never Prevail against it God can't lie if God put a rock Revelation in your soul where's devil was demon could put that out of you or give the Lord a shout no wonder we could stand no wonder we stand in all these years you fall on your get back up know when they get bounce back no wonder where they can front side after your backside or give the Lord some Praises or

you today let me see I could wrap up here now Hallelujah Hallelujah glory to God Hallelujah thank you Lord thank you Lord Oh Glory to God let me go I'm going to finish the price it's definitely question your sins be a Scarlet they are white as snow red like Crimson white like wool you are perfectly sinless no matter what you have done what you do what you are still sinless as long as you accepted Jesus Christ as your savior your sins are forgiven anything that's forgive me is remitted and forgot about now watch he was just one man the perfect man he give his life and he made an example for you now what must we do here we go I'm gonna wrap up now the first thing I want to say is Jesus never lived for himself his life was spent for others and there's a lesson right here you know you see when you live for yourself you only care about you and some people in that selfish mode only care about their family their eyes only see their own interests their own desires what they want what they're lusting after what they desire and what they think they're supposed to have they have no burden and can say but nobody else as long as their desires is fulfilled everything is fine but not Jesus and he said that is perfectly eternal life when you say you go to church you do good things that's fine when you live your life to yourself you haven't eaten a life eternal life is living for others and I know it's not striking yet but one day it will one day truly will because some of our behavior is based upon selfishness plain nasty filthy selfishness is because you into you some people's actions is because of self pure self and I recognize selfish evidence you have not died because self is what you defend and anytime you defend yourself you are still alive and kicking you have a coffee in front of here if you're on service all of a sudden he had come up here you see you dead when you push down your head your foot come up it's this message if you see somebody call from and you touch them so and they talk that person's not dead they're alive and when we die somebody could spit on your coffee it doesn't matter there's a lion here you have no response to that because you are dead that's why everybody said he opened up his mouth they beat him they do whatever they want for Jesus he didn't respond to that oh give the Lord a shout so your self-defense or as well preach your excuses exposes how Alive You Are I did this because that is when I said brother Papa behind his head you're not supposed if he didn't do that I was gonna do this if she didn't say that I wasn't going to say this you saying it because you want to you saying it because you choose to you don't have to but you choose to and I speak my mind I'm not lit for my mouth I see how they get a lead you know foreign watch when you say you go to church and you do good things that's fine but when you live life to yourself you haven't eaten alive eternal life is living for others someone said how can you stand and let anybody call you such bad names question you don't live for yourself you live for others that you might redeem that man you become sons and the trouble of it is the church has forgotten they were Sons you are taking Christ's place you are Sons so don't lift yourself live for others well brother Branham I can live for this brother because he saw is a nice man that's not it live for that man who hates you saw lady amen you know you want to you want to live for the man who can use with bread and who feel let it bring ice cream for you I'm nice and this one nice to treat a nice you know they bring some food you didn't ask them you want to live for that what about this after they say crucify him look what barely kindness is look what love is on top of early kindness Jesus had to say it you know yeah yeah call them bunch of Rascals have to die for them them Sinners down there oh God they're killing me no he didn't say that God you say father forgive them they don't know what they're doing they know not what they do he had to express it manifested clear it before he could give up the ghost well give the Lord a shout broadly kindness have to be expressed spoken manifested Oh Glory to God be caught before we go to the next level because the next level was going to bring forth of Resurrection oh give the Lord a shout at the next level before the voice of the archangel [Applause] watch live for that person who will kill you if they could like my wife had a dream of somebody pet memories is that just part of the dream and I said the only reason they permanent toilet paper because I didn't have nothing else that's the only reason that was the only reason they're gonna put their hand on if they're only I'd find a big Stone a cut class or anything else they might tell that too but that's all they had to leave them alone all right so here we go now he said no I can live for this brother because he sure is a nice man that's not it live for that man who hates you live for that person who will kill you if they could that is what they'd done to him they killed him and he died that he might save them that is eternal life when you get it you and his bosom you are facing heaven then but you sacrifice your own things give them away like the sheep gives it wool you look towards Calvary Matthew 16 4 24 says then Jesus said unto his disciples this is disciples If any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me that is Matthew you know Luke say that same thing I will find print in it and he said unto them all if any man will come after me let them deny himself and take up his cross daily so if you read that first scripture I just say well I become a cross dress it down it's like scripture correct that they're not Ascend the cross a Wednesday cross this is the daily cross hey you want a long dress boy yeah on a Monday or Tuesday Wednesday Tuesday night the long distance on Sunday cross that you playing yourself like what you want to do and God will allow that yeah because they're forcing the way to dress right you know as I say if you want to lose weight go ahead and come down and shave your fat and shave yourself and lose weight enough gonna say oh gosh I can't pull it out without you know no it's your choice if you look at your dad and exercise and whatnot it will go down come in the sweep your house go there coming to work on the job you come do some computer to work Adam you're getting trouble with his speed there was no mandatory so he put man in dust to fill his soul and God as Adam Adam Adam Adam lazy lazy God I pray not God coming and pick up them so yes he put man to work he put us to labor to work they say they don't get moving and think it burns will get stiff I won't think about that you ever see them old people feeling yeah remember a friend of mine next neighbor Johnny Phillip his father was all in the 80s and he always doing something like in fact you guys see all people in a rocking Jesus rocket Road we're eating that we see that in church but them old folks know better than that I keep doing that I keep doing something I keep the bones they keep the brains keep everything alive so you can expect to be in church doing nothing when you're praying you're praying and you're closing of the prayer Lord you're talking long field try to pray more than your talk on Facebook try to pray to pray more now all them stupid videos people telling you and you press and play five minutes ten minutes 15 minutes 20 minutes are all video watching unlimental nonsense on Facebook on YouTube or or on WhatsApp put your deposit in prayer and bring fire inside of here bring fire Sunday morning bring it this Resurrection morning and see where God wouldn't explode with power inside of here let me all people know Jesus it's in John 12 24. very less empty I'm going to close very nice and to you except the corner we phoned you wrong and died about alone if you're diving for much food unless a grain of corn falls in the ground and rot unless a man rocks to his own theology unless you rotten to the Methodist theology right in the Baptist theology written to Pentecost intelligence until you grow up to those things and give yourself into the hands of God then the old man will die new man will be born there is no way around it can't avoid it this is it okay so here what he said you know take that wheat how could one grain of wheat here's what happens one grain Falls in it brings for 100 greens under a good Falls in bring for a thousand greens thousand greens fall in before the Midland green I mean I'm gonna fall in a batch load that's what he meant if I live my life alone and die this way I live my life alone there'll be no food after me but if I fall into the ground under the will of God I will bring forth a new birth and in that new boat will bring forth another new bird so the law of God is a nature you put a seed it goes only wrong and die it's been for the corn stalk and everything else get more fruit That's the Law of nature if we die to ourselves what's going to happen Christ will become the ooze out of your life this husband will see it your children will see it your family will see it you don't tell them come to church they will see something inside of you it has to be inside of you let me wrap up here now you cannot find Christ until you die to yourself and accept him the word and then you'll find life and when you die to yourself with Christ like economy then the word lives in you brings forth the same results it doesn't matter which church you go to and which you to join people leave this church go to that church that is just it and they don't want to die that's the problem there you know it's debt because some people won't have their own way and because they can't have their own way that's a problem they don't rebuke they don't want correction they really want almost like a like a Talus man like you have a lucky charm they won't go to a lucky charm some people with that channel pocket something in the pocket and because they have that in the pocket they believe that they'll be blessed that how they use gospel that's not what God teaches here he wants you your ears your eyes your heart your life he wants you isn't that right I'm gonna close they are fine people good people not all that said Lord Lord but the one that doeth the will of my father not he that stats is he that finishes there are no shortcuts say it after me they are no shortcuts say it again there are no shortcuts one more time there are no shortcuts hear what he says now you must come just the way the scripture said not he that starts is he that finishes there are no shortcuts you are disqualified at the end of the race you must come just the way the scripture says you come that way except you die to yourself and be born of the spirit of God you are lost that is all there are no shortcuts oh my God there's coming an hour you're gonna play something I'm finished when God shall make the world bow at the feet of men and women who have plunged through and cross Jordan and separate them things themselves some of the things of the world God Will Make the World bow I think there was one of the Brothers in the Jewish ages he was preaching or speaking or something like that and somebody didn't want to send have respects and God setting fire under a seat you jump up goats and fire in his pants the world will power the feet of women not just pastors and no men and women who Cross Jordan Lord I want to be a Christian in my heart listen friends I am seeing the power of decisions God can't force you to be saved God can't force you to get baptized God can't force you to save him the same way
