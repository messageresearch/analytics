walking according to the will of God what he wants for lands I'm not walking according to our own will or to our own understanding the Bible says lean not unto your own understanding so we are not here tonight to lean onto our own understanding but we're here to lean on the everlasting arms tonight there's a spirit here tonight that is here to lead us and to guide us into all truth Jesus said a little while and the world will see me no more but he said you are going to see me and he said behold I'm gonna send a comforter he is going to be with you every step of the way he's gonna wear to school with you tonight he's gonna go home with you he's gonna go to work with you he's gonna be on the street on your child wherever you are at the Secret Service agent which is the Holy Spirit has been released upon the urge to guide the sons and the daughters of the Living God tonight back to the cross back to the halle-loo back to the Bible back to the word back to the original tonight that

believe that tonight you walk out of here tonight I'm talking to you tonight you are not just anybody but you are the words that was in the book Holland I was put this season that was for this time Mary was the words in the book a virgin shall conceive but she didn't know it there was no name Mary but it was just words on the book a virgin shall conceive but when Mary was born a prophecy was hanging over her head because she was supposed to fulfill the name Holly the words I was in the book her name was not bearing per se that was a natural name but her name was a name that was written in heaven a virgin shall conceive and when the prophet said that group who will take the word and handycam Oh hallelujah Cooper's here tonight that group is the predestinated that group is the colony the one that did not fall up there in heaven in the original battle is Niraj Holly when Michael spoke and a dragon watch there was an original group up there we did not fall to the devil's lie they did not fall to the devil's deception but they held sure they stand strong to the Word of the Living God I believe tonight I am speaking to that group that group would be destinated I can't hear I can't

their ideas however we are not here to lean on the understanding of man we are here to lean on the understanding of God all of what God said his knowledge his understanding his wisdom he said his ways are higher than your ways and his thoughts are higher than your thoughts or our pots appear in the morning and in that same day or pot perish but when God speaks it is forever when God thinks his thoughts his thoughts Aeterna his everlasting eye when God talked about you tonight he saw you perfect hallelujah I saw you sinless through the blood of Jesus Christ tonight you have every right tonight to go into the Bible and pull out any promise any promise if you need a healing tonight every promise in this book belongs to you tonight every promise in the world belongs to you tonight if

somebody say man Oh hallelujah enemy is not out there the enemy is right here brother branham said my greatest enemy is brother pan if I could get William Branham out it away then car could step in and take every spirits under his control that's what we want tonight sons and daughters of God come on now under the control of the Holy Spirit come on now that call could find a place and he say there's my spirit flowing freely he has another one here I could use him he is another sister there I could use her I could place them positionally into the kingdom according to Ephesians 4 that's what God is looking for tonight normal children but he wants adults in Christ grown up in a knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ firmly rooted and grounded in love or predestinated us unto the adoption of children by himself according to the good pleasure of his will Oh hallelujah whose God's calling in this hour you know more children so tonight's really an inspiration that points us to adoption it's not hallelujah the policing of sons amen and God wants to positionally place us into the body hallelujah for us to be effective in our place we cannot be effective for God until we are in our place where but God has for us hallelujah praise go is not hallelujah hallelujah now we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part will be done away with in other words what we're seeing is God has been longing to come to this perfection and we are striving for we preach about and we pray about that we looking to see call himself as a great burden in his heart like a pregnant mother caught up in reaching to give birth to sons Sons like he had in the beginning sons like Adam had praise you could speak to the mountain who can speak to the birds who could speak to the beasts caught tonight you know hear me tonight God is desperate the Spirit of God searching the earth right now searching for hearts searching for sons searching for taught us searching for somebody he could arrest upon somebody who is willing enough who is willing enough to be led of God to be led by a spirit to heal themselves of God they could gain heavenly knowledge heavenly understanding heavenly wisdom oh I wish I'm not come not from man but with them that collect from God Oh of understanding to know who God is what he is his nature his being all about God that's what we got to be Halloween when we get to that place when we see God plainly hallelujah will begin to live something more hallelujah more I just talk what I just comment to church but a genuine desire to be like Jesus water just come in I'm paying tax and wasting time sitting on a Pew no no you come to get next to yourself we come to get tell spread tonight lord I beseech you show me that glory lord I beseech you show me that power show me that glory that's all you ought to come tonight no no I'm not just lolly in but a bouncer to churches lolly in when you ought to be just words when they ought to be prayed up looking for a messiah knowing that he could come any time you gotta be on that desperation you gotta be on that expectation to receive your portion of the Holy Ghost before those terrible plague strike the devil is running around patient night he is slaughtering and killing young people one by one one by one get let see yourself tonight get just brutal perish the Holy Spirit's wants to play sons into the King know the Holy Spirit's is looking for winning hearts willing lives winning souls willing bodies tonight well heal em self-support Oh hallelujah somebody get me water shout of praise [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah God wants to reproduce himself God wants to reproduce a little more sons like he had in the beginning God ha was having such a glorious time in the beginning when there was a demand there was Eve and a perfect family God wants to come back to that God doesn't want this this polluted this sinful world this world man raping young girls and women can't walk the streets in peace because when the night falls the demons running through the streets doing whatever they want to say whatever they want to that's not the world God wanted oh I'll put sink him in the beginning and spoil the picture of God but what God is about to do tonight no eye has seen no ear hallelujah has heard what God hasn't strong for his sons and daughters tonight God is going to bring back another Ephesians another perfect church on the earth I'm not a royal priesthood a holy nation a peculiar pride a pride like has never been before she's gonna walk like Christ she's gonna talk like Christ she's gonna live this gospel somebody tonight it's gonna live this gospel tonight we appraise go oh I could feel it in my bones [Applause] hallelujah my little chorus pregnant with desire to fill you with the Holy Ghost God wants to fill you but you're not desperate enough why are you not praying enough we got to come to a point we realize we cannot lead ourselves where we need God's knowledge where we need God's guidance where we need God's wisdom to handle every situation to handle every trial because when you do it you make a mess let's see yourself when you try to handle let you make a mess you don't know what to do because you're operating with our knowledge you're operating with our wisdom but when car drops down and then he has a mind for every situation you have to get caught up in God's mind you have to get a desire for God's Spirit for God's program in your family life and your home life for your job for your situation the way you're supposed to go next you've got to get a desperation for that got a what going to lead you what time to proper to go into the forest it's now we know the story I began to walk and he's walking and he's trying to get to a certain place all of a sudden he came back to us what we recognized he said but I've been here before then he continued walking said I'm not lost in all I'll be I'll be all right I'm a guy and he told himself well I'm a guy I'm supposed to know the trees he said it has I've spotted a tree where you touch where the moss grows the most and that's the side where the three hits and that's how you tell where's the north and the south he was a guy who was a tracker he was supposed to know how to guide himself and here it was called aloud a prophet to get into a situation where he could not lead himself is now God allowed a prophet to get lost to show him that you did a god you need somebody to lead you and tonight in this dark age that we live in here in this evening time that we're living in we need a kind you cannot rely on yourself forget about yourself tonight we are nothing tonight we are still tea as rats and ice all your comeliness all your cuddliness all your niceness you never spit on a sidewalk that is filthiness in God's sight what could help us to die church help after time for God to live in you tonight God is looking for somebody who say I abhor myself God wants to bring you to the spot where you can begin to strip all of the world offer you all of your thoughts off of you all the top program all that you want all that you desire you've got to have a desire for God's desire to be made manifest in your life in your home in your walk hallelujah hallelujah I hear me tonight are you hearing me right now you've got to want that when you're worn out then it's starting to get right so God wants mature sons but in order to do that he's got to bring you under subjection to his word and to his will is nothing I'll ever eat again heavily knowledge I love about Isaac Sarah Sunday he said Moses knew a lot of stuff from Egypt from Egypt plan and what Pharaoh taught him and what the best teachers don't in Egypt was teaching he had all the PhDs he had his master's degree he had his bachelor's degree in this and his engineering degree in math and so on but all his knowledge hallelujah could only lead him to to kill one man and run away that's all Moses his intellect could ever bring him to but he had to come to the point God had to bring him to a point in the wilderness and stay out pay about forty years we could burn out all of the intellects burn out all of the self burn out all of boses out of boozes rocket moves the hot-tempered wife is now right hallelujah all right what's more put them in a situation keep him there on that desert keeping their out on the plains say their praise God beat in the intellect out of him and that's what God wants to do tonight God has put you in situations and sometimes we have money hard we twist our return and we want our own where we want to say we want to talk and we want to react and when card is trying to put us through the fire God is trying to put us through a test brothers trying to put those two situations what for to burn the loss out of you to burn what you want hallelujah hallelujah the profits that love loss what must four big things lustful popularity loves to be able to say I did this love to be able to put your name on something but God wants to strip that all away from you and make you say though he slay me yeah I trust him he could take my money you could take my bank accounts but don't he say me yet I'll trust him you could turn the church against you come on now you got to turn your neighbor against you turn your family

is and to know what he is how he lives to know his nature to know his being you're supposed to be all the way up there by that time see to bring us into the full-stop sure what's the purpose the full stature of sons and daughters of God our church that's washed in the blood of Christ that's bought with our money that's paid for by the blood of Jesus Christ so what's been the purpose all the time to bring sons and to bring daughters into full maturity hallelujah hallelujah when God could take a man hallelujah I'll adopt him into the family it's now hop to read it man praise the name of the Lord his prophet said the church is supposed to be predestinated watch on to the adoption of children where a man or God could take a man and adopt him into the family oh it's not what you want to

to be born spiritually into the family of God hello you must be porn I can't another birth from a pause not a natural booth but a supernatural birth Oh Holly on anointing that comes down from heaven to seal you on the inside to put God's Holy Spirit of approval in your soul that you know who you are to know who God is his nature his peer all about God how I experience and by revelation under the corners reveal himself to you that you know in your soul who you're praying to you know who you believe in on - and it doesn't matter what happens tonight doesn't matter but when you go out of here if
