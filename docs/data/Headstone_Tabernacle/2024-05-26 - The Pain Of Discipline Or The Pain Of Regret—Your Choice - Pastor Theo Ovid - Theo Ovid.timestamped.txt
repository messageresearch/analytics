[48:16] people but beyond just young people is
[48:18] really dedicated we taking some
[48:20] inspiration from all things that pertain
[48:23] unto life and godliness that this word
[48:26] this gospel this message that we preach
[48:28] contains all things he has given through
[48:31] his divine power access to all things
[48:34] that pertain un both life and godliness
[48:36] so I greet you in the precious name of
[48:38] Jesus Christ I returned uh home on
[48:40] Friday evening from Lagos Nigeria so I
[48:43] bring greetings from Brother Olu and the
[48:45] local Christian Assembly Lagos they send
[48:47] their greetings they send their love
[48:49] they send their appreciation to you
[48:53] amen I had the opportunity Saturday
[48:56] before to participate in their youth
[48:58] service and then last Sunday I was able
[49:00] to minister uh at brother hu's Church in
[49:04] Lagos and then last Wednesday I was able
[49:07] to minister at brother DA's Church uh in
[49:09] Nigeria as well so we had a tremendous
[49:10] time so greetings from Brother da and
[49:13] his church over there as well they send
[49:15] their love they send their appreciation
[49:18] uh to you the Believers and to the
[49:19] church and it's a great time that we are
[49:22] living in uh I preached a message in
[49:25] brother U's Church uh speaking about the
[49:27] storms of life finding Fai in the midst
[49:30] of your storm and it's a message I
[49:31] preach here in the church about a year
[49:33] or so ago where we looked at Matthew 8
[49:36] and Matthew 14 where we looked at the
[49:39] first time the disciples encountered a
[49:40] storm but the first storm they encounted
[49:43] Jesus was on the boat with them and in
[49:45] the midst of the storm as they were
[49:47] dealing with it they had to make that
[49:49] decision to wake Jesus but there was
[49:51] still this element of comfort because
[49:53] Jesus was on the boat with them so they
[49:55] had the Comfort to well if Jesus is here
[49:58] I don't think this boat is going down
[49:59] because he's on the boat and they were
[50:01] able to wake Jesus and when Jesus woke
[50:03] up he say oh you have little faith and
[50:05] he spoke to the storm he said peace be
[50:07] still and he addressed the storm itself
[50:10] and that led to the disciples saying
[50:12] what manner of man is this that even the
[50:14] wind and the Seas obey him and that was
[50:17] Matthew 8 but the real subject of what I
[50:19] brought was Matthew 14 which was a
[50:21] different situation there was another
[50:23] storm but this time Jesus was not on the
[50:25] boat the were on the boat on their own
[50:28] and many times in life God lets you go
[50:30] through trials and situations where it
[50:31] seems as if he's not there but he's
[50:33] watching and this time the Bible said he
[50:35] was watching from afar walking towards
[50:37] them and he's seeing them in their
[50:39] struggle and the expectation was I could
[50:42] imagine from the last time they say well
[50:44] the last time when Jesus came he spoke
[50:46] to the storm but this time he didn't
[50:47] touch the storm he didn't speak to the
[50:49] storm he didn't speak to the wind he
[50:51] didn't speak to the waves he spoke to
[50:52] them in the middle of their storm and
[50:55] the first thing he said to them was be
[50:56] of of good chair so your boat might be
[50:58] shaking your boat might be rocking your
[51:00] world might be upside down but God is
[51:02] saying to you be of good chair and in
[51:05] that entire lesson in Matthew 14 Jesus
[51:08] never touched the storm he was speaking
[51:10] to the individuals in the middle of your
[51:12] storm so it doesn't matter what storm
[51:14] you're going through this morning maybe
[51:16] in your storm Jesus is on your boat or
[51:18] maybe in your storm he's not on your
[51:20] boat but in either one of those those
[51:22] two storms God is going to make a way
[51:24] for you whether it's dealing with the
[51:26] situation around you or dealing with you
[51:29] in the middle of your situation God is
[51:31] going to get the glory he's going to get
[51:33] the honor and in this life we liveing
[51:36] we'll have our ups and downs we'll have
[51:38] our struggles and our battles we'll have
[51:39] our trials and temptations but some
[51:42] through the water some through the flood
[51:43] some through great child but all come
[51:46] through the blood so we thank God for
[51:48] his grace we thank God for his love we
[51:50] thank God for his unction that we can
[51:53] look at our situation and see God
[51:55] dealing with us in the middle of it
[51:57] because at the end of the day friends
[51:58] it's easy for us to say well God speak
[52:00] to this situation and speak to that
[52:02] situation but at the end of it God
[52:04] really wants to deal with us because the
[52:06] stronger you become is greater is he
[52:08] that's in you that's he that's in the
[52:10] world can the church say Amen so we had
[52:12] a tremendous time in the Lord and then
[52:14] on Wednesday night at brother Dees
[52:16] church I speak about the mystery of your
[52:18] spiritual
[52:20] identity whereby the BAM said if the
[52:23] bride gets to know who she is and when
[52:25] the bride gets to know know who she is
[52:27] then the Rapture is going to go so
[52:28] there's no Rapture without you having a
[52:30] revelation of who you are and who you
[52:32] are is tied to your spiritual identity
[52:35] you cannot walk into this thing you had
[52:37] to have been born into this thing you
[52:39] are not now deciding to come to this
[52:42] thing but because God placed you here
[52:45] and I asked a question to the church I
[52:48] said anybody chose their birthday is
[52:51] anybody in here choose your birthday did
[52:53] anybody choose what day you're going to
[52:55] be born in what family you were going to
[52:57] be born in what country going to be born
[52:59] in you have nothing to do with it when
[53:02] Prince Harry was born he didn't choose
[53:04] the family he was born into he didn't
[53:06] choose the day he was born he was he
[53:08] found himself here in a royal family and
[53:10] we are here this morning and we have
[53:12] found ourselves in a royal family we
[53:15] didn't choose the day we were born we
[53:17] didn't choose the family we were born
[53:18] into we didn't choose the country we
[53:20] were born into but we are here this
[53:22] morning by Divine decree the Lord
[53:25] himself put you in his royal family you
[53:28] are royal seeds of Abraham and because
[53:31] of who you are the purpose of God could
[53:34] never be defeated oh I feel Victorious

[59:16] portion of scripture before I have your
[59:18] seats Hebrews 12 want to read 5 to1
[59:21] Proverbs 3 want to read be 11 to2 and
[59:26] Proverbs
[59:29] 51-14 reading Hebrews
[59:33] 12:5 and he have forgotten the
[59:36] exaltation which speaketh unto you as
[59:37] unto
[59:38] children my son despise not thou the
[59:42] chastening of the Lord nor faint when
[59:44] thou rebuked of him for whom the Lord
[59:47] loveth he chasteneth and scored every
[59:50] son whom he receiveth if he endure
[59:54] chastening God dealing with you as with
[59:56] sons for what son is he whom the father
[1:00:00] chasteneth not but if he be without
[1:00:03] chastisement whereof all are partakers
[1:00:06] then are ye bastards and not Sons
[1:00:09] furthermore we have had fathers of our
[1:00:11] flesh which corrected us and we give
[1:00:14] them reverence shall we not much more
[1:00:17] rather be in subjection unto the father
[1:00:19] of spirits and live for they verily for
[1:00:23] a few days chasen us after their own
[1:00:25] pleasure
[1:00:26] but he for our Prophet that we might be
[1:00:30] partakers of his Holiness now no
[1:00:33] chastening for the presence seeth to be
[1:00:34] joyous but Grievous nevertheless
[1:00:37] afterward it yielded the Peaceable fruit
[1:00:39] of righteousness unto them which are
[1:00:41] exercised thereby proverb chapter 3
[1:00:45] reading verse 11 and 12 my son despise
[1:00:50] not the chasing of the Lord neither be
[1:00:52] wary of his correction for whom the Lord
[1:00:55] loveth he correct it even as a father
[1:00:58] the son in whom he delighted and final
[1:01:00] scripture Proverbs Chapter 5 want to
[1:01:03] read from verse
[1:01:07] 11 and thou mourn at the
[1:01:10] last when thy flesh and thy body are
[1:01:13] consumed so this is a time of debt and
[1:01:17] see how have I hated
[1:01:19] instruction and my heart despised
[1:01:23] reproof and have not obeyed the voice of
[1:01:26] my teachers nor incline my ear to them
[1:01:31] that instructed me I was almost in an
[1:01:34] evil in the midst of the congregation
[1:01:37] and assembly let's pray father God we
[1:01:38] thank you for your word your word is
[1:01:40] life and truth without it we are
[1:01:42] finished we can't go anywhere your word
[1:01:45] only have life come and breathe life to
[1:01:48] us Lord and pour out your spirit and
[1:01:51] bring understanding wisdom and knowledge
[1:01:53] in Jesus name I ask it amen and amen be
[1:01:56] seated praise God hallelujah it's great
[1:01:58] to be here it's great to have brother
[1:01:59] Isaac back from his trip to
[1:02:04] Nigeria and to be a blessing you know
[1:02:10] um you ever statement some people light
[1:02:12] up a room every what some people line up
[1:02:16] a room when they go out of it and some
[1:02:18] people light up a room when they come
[1:02:20] into it but everybody lights up a room
[1:02:23] and it's powerful when you could become
[1:02:25] a blessing
[1:02:27] and for you to become a blessing God has
[1:02:29] to do something for you amen praise
[1:02:32] God so eight years
[1:02:35] ago Pastor
[1:02:37] ULU spoke a message the pain and the
[1:02:40] pleasure is the inside life remember I
[1:02:43] think was first I think it was our first
[1:02:46] convention or so here and he was
[1:02:49] speaking about the natural tendency to
[1:02:53] go for
[1:02:54] pleasure and the AV voice voidance of
[1:02:56] pain that's as human beings we tend to
[1:03:00] go towards the easy route then the easy
[1:03:04] as oppos just more comfortable there's
[1:03:06] no stress in that and that's why young
[1:03:09] people get caught up in gambling and in
[1:03:11] in in playing around and smoking and
[1:03:13] carrying on what up because that cool
[1:03:16] zesting and thing you know carrying on
[1:03:18] and like that so he talking about pain
[1:03:22] and pleasure but when you go for the
[1:03:24] pleasure you got pain
[1:03:27] after when you go for the pleasure you
[1:03:29] get the pain after so so we have choices
[1:03:32] to make and I had another message but
[1:03:35] this is what I had you know I couldn't
[1:03:37] put them together I wanted to do it
[1:03:39] together but it was just too much but I
[1:03:41] have a title this morning the pain of
[1:03:44] discipline or the pain of regret your
[1:03:52] choice you have to choose between these
[1:03:54] two pains
[1:03:58] right we had a powerful youth meeting
[1:04:01] yesterday I wouldn't call it a youth
[1:04:02] meeting I want to switch it to meetings
[1:04:05] of of things pertaining to life and
[1:04:09] godliness put in put into young people
[1:04:12] but anybody could come so what Andrew
[1:04:14] shared something of what uh keeps people
[1:04:18] into poverty partners with poverty
[1:04:20] partners with Rich is very interesting
[1:04:22] uh thought about that part of life and
[1:04:25] and part of this thing about poverty the
[1:04:27] Bible talk about sleep somebody loves
[1:04:31] sleep they tell them go and work they
[1:04:33] say you have a ling know God got go
[1:04:36] outside now they said that sleeping and
[1:04:39] overs sleeping will bring it to
[1:04:41] Poverty so poverty is connected to love
[1:04:44] of sleep because the man who diligent he
[1:04:48] will get
[1:04:49] somewhere but I'm not here to talk about
[1:04:51] that I'm here to speak about the pain of
[1:04:55] discipline
[1:04:56] or the pain of regret your
[1:05:00] choice you have to choose between these
[1:05:02] two
[1:05:04] pains now Matthew 11: 2030 Jesus speaks
[1:05:08] he said come unto me all ye that labor
[1:05:09] and a heavy laden and I will give you
[1:05:11] rest come you're tired you're weary come
[1:05:16] take my yoke upon you and learn of me he
[1:05:20] did not say come and there is no yoke
[1:05:23] right he did not say that he said come I
[1:05:26] have a yoke I have something to put on
[1:05:28] you but I want to let you know I am meek
[1:05:31] and lonely in heart you shall rest find
[1:05:34] rest unto your souls for my yoke the one
[1:05:38] that I have is
[1:05:39] easy and my burden is light as compared
[1:05:44] to what the devil will put on you the
[1:05:46] one the devil put on you it will to be
[1:05:48] heavy but my yoke is easy and my burden
[1:05:51] going to be light choose your yoke
[1:05:56] choose your burden choose your pain
[1:06:00] because it has
[1:06:04] [Applause]
[1:06:06] that paying from discipline leads to
[1:06:09] growth and
[1:06:12] righteousness on
[1:06:15] now there are two kinds of
[1:06:17] pains one that brings
[1:06:20] discipline a one that brings
[1:06:23] regret it can be seen as Godly
[1:06:26] discipline as compared with the
[1:06:29] consequences of
[1:06:32] sin discipline may be painful in the
[1:06:35] moment but it leads to righteousness and
[1:06:39] peace now that scripture we read in
[1:06:41] Hebrews 12 and he Amplified it says for
[1:06:44] the time this amplifi vers 121 says for
[1:06:46] the time being no discipline brings
[1:06:51] Joy
[1:06:53] none whatever we talk to yourself
[1:06:58] easy correct
[1:07:00] yourself correct your easy p a Santa
[1:07:03] Claus Santa Claus hat and a Santa Claus
[1:07:06] beard and talk to you like Santa Claus
[1:07:08] it is still
[1:07:09] discipline it is still correcting it is
[1:07:12] still
[1:07:13] instructing and not everybody likes
[1:07:20] that Hebrews 12:11 for the time
[1:07:23] Amplified for the time being no
[1:07:26] discipline brings Joy but seems
[1:07:28] Grievious and painful all right but
[1:07:33] afterwards it yields a Peaceable fruit
[1:07:36] of righteousness to those who have been
[1:07:39] trained by it a harvest of fruit which
[1:07:42] consist in righteousness in Conformity
[1:07:45] to God's will in purpose thought and
[1:07:48] action resulting in right living and
[1:07:51] right standing with
[1:07:53] God the proverbs we read Proverbs 3 said
[1:07:57] my son and and and as a Young Man
[1:08:00] serving the lord God called me age

[1:08:06] key books it was it kept me as a young

[1:08:33] consider the ant how they does live they
[1:08:35] just toil they're not lazy Pro have all
[1:08:38] of that to correct your behavior and
[1:08:40] attitude you a born diligent you a born
[1:08:44] purposeful and whatnot you have to learn
[1:08:46] that Jesus said learn of me my yoke is
[1:08:50] easy my burden is light you come here to

[1:38:03] just Macon pie just come off in this
[1:38:08] linee but Andy them guys start to eat
[1:38:13] had a h up there sit down the H the
[1:38:19] Rocko and then they start to repent they
[1:38:22] said this not right the city is starving
[1:38:25] we can have all this for
[1:38:29] ourselves they ran back in the city and
[1:38:32] say it's have food it have gold it have
[1:38:36] this what kind of Christians are we we
[1:38:39] sitting down
[1:38:46] dying that come somebody looking for the
[1:38:48] mother to do what the father to do and
[1:38:50] the father de and the mother dead and
[1:38:52] then they recognize they have to do do
[1:38:53] for
[1:38:55] themselves God told Joshua my servant
[1:38:57] Moses is dead take the people over he
[1:39:00] told a man who never did before Joshua
[1:39:02] never did that before take them across
[1:39:04] Jordan and and fight and then divide the
[1:39:07] land God could give us instructions of
[1:39:10] things we never did before what you will
[1:39:12] tell God gu somebody else now well we
[1:39:16] have not gone this way before who else
[1:39:18] God must
[1:39:21] use a lot of job it have presently did
[1:39:25] not exist 20 years
[1:39:32] ago now with this Char have something
[1:39:34] call a prompt
[1:39:35] engineer like somebody who ask
[1:39:38] questions what a title a prompt engineer
[1:39:42] that is insane but they have that so
[1:39:46] there are jobs there are things that
[1:39:48] going to come forward just like they
[1:39:49] have robots right now I think China have
[1:39:52] a whole Army of robots in factories and
[1:39:54] whatnot Robots coming for jobs
[1:39:56] artificial intelligence comeing for jobs
[1:39:58] secretaries are losing their work
[1:39:59] because they could dictate and say what
[1:40:00] to write to who and what and let the fix
[1:40:02] up and just
[1:40:04] sign the world is
[1:40:06] changing and if you don't change it will
[1:40:09] change all around you it's not waiting
[1:40:11] for you to understand the change it is
[1:40:14] changing but it cannot change outside of
[1:40:16] the prophecy so we have a clear
[1:40:19] Advantage because God will not hide from
[1:40:21] us what he's about to do
[1:40:27] so the gospel addresses Global issues
[1:40:30] the gospel addresses what is to be and
[1:40:34] how we have to be prepared for what is
[1:40:36] to be let me let me just continue
[1:40:38] quickly so this scripture here now so so
[1:40:40] so okay so chasing does not mean to
[1:40:42] punish it mean to discipline because the
[1:40:46] subject amendment in is in mind in other
[1:40:49] words God is hoping that people adjust
[1:40:53] yes their behavior and attitude that
[1:40:55] will come back in line that is why
[1:40:58] chasing comes to get you back in order
[1:41:02] all right so fathers of our flesh
[1:41:03] corrected us and we went through that
[1:41:05] right now no chasing for the present
[1:41:07] seem to be joyous but Grievous
[1:41:09] nevertheless it yielded the Peaceable
[1:41:10] fruit of righteousness them that
[1:41:12] exercise by all right let's
[1:41:15] continue now let me just inject here
[1:41:18] just like in school in school you always
[1:41:20] have the miserable student who kicks in
[1:41:22] and carrying on and pelting behind the
[1:41:24] teacher and what not and who Pelt and
[1:41:25] Pelt and whatnot and it have some of
[1:41:28] them who bright and some of them who not
[1:41:29] so bright the bright ones could do that
[1:41:31] and get away because they're still
[1:41:32] learning the work home and they
[1:41:34] interrupting the class but the foolish
[1:41:36] ones who not do not so bright and
[1:41:38] pelting and disrupting class they keep
[1:41:39] them back themselves and there are those
[1:41:41] people that will be disciplined to study
[1:41:43] the exams pass the exams and later on in
[1:41:45] life their Engineers their doctors they
[1:41:47] whatever they career part and the one
[1:41:49] who miss out on that they just fall back
[1:41:52] amen so it proves all over in the
[1:41:54] natural and the spiritual discipline is
[1:41:58] painful but it have a a fruit with it or
[1:42:02] a reward with it it come like how the
[1:42:05] Bible talk about uh children obey
[1:42:07] parents let's take that right now what
[1:42:09] you find them children fighting
[1:42:11] especially now they're fighting against
[1:42:13] parents and so on but there's a blessing
[1:42:14] to obey a parent
[1:42:16] am you see so when you do that even the
[1:42:20] parents not worthy to be obeyed or what
[1:42:22] when you when you get them that respects
[1:42:24] and so on God blesses you for the part
[1:42:26] that you are playing you cannot say well
[1:42:28] the reason I bust his head the reason I
[1:42:31] py stone is because he did no that is
[1:42:34] not it but Andrew talk about a soft
[1:42:36] answer turn with rat that's what the
[1:42:38] Bible say you proven your point by
[1:42:40] opening your mouth loud and shouting and
[1:42:41] like that you you taking the word you
[1:42:43] know a soft answer the wife in a mod or
[1:42:47] the husband in a mode and you want to be
[1:42:49] mod
[1:42:50] too and then two people in the mode and
[1:42:53] you know what happened there's a big big
[1:42:54] mode going on there now but if one
[1:42:57] person pull back soft answer turn away R
[1:43:01] you recognize it cannot continue like
[1:43:03] that if the husband in a funny mode and
[1:43:06] you answer Softly As a wife he feel
[1:43:08] foolish because it would look like if o
[1:43:11] what that called for you're carrying on
[1:43:13] carrying on it's like I see somebody
[1:43:14] kill a cockroach and pow it's a
[1:43:17] cockro not not so not not so think de
[1:43:23] great not
[1:43:25] so so that is how it appears when you
[1:43:29] come with the soft answer and and that
[1:43:31] person will feel foolish with their
[1:43:33] crazy H response
[1:43:37] then next thing is a
[1:43:40] smile I don't know where what people
[1:43:42] have a gift of grump um but a smile is a
[1:43:45] beautiful thing and sometime just you
[1:43:48] walk in an office smiling and you make
[1:43:49] people smile too but you walk with a
[1:43:51] hard face anybody hard face andbody
[1:43:54] joining in the club but you don't want
[1:43:57] to be like that light up the
[1:44:02] [Applause]
[1:44:03] world I remember gotting sick had
[1:44:06] something all over my skin and so on and
[1:44:08] I was walking
[1:44:10] so and it was painful and thing and
[1:44:13] somebody said oh God look at he and he's
[1:44:17] a
[1:44:18] Christian I feel bad
[1:44:24] but I walking so I walking like that
[1:44:27] that's what you talking about you want
[1:44:30] to reflect God's glory you want to
[1:44:33] reflect his presence you want to reflect
[1:44:36] I want to know where do you go to church
[1:44:39] what what do you believe why are you
[1:44:41] glowing like that something is about you
[1:44:44] something about
[1:44:46] you in other words you are distinguished
[1:44:49] from everybody else by what is around
[1:44:51] you and there is something around you
[1:44:53] because angels
[1:44:55] are are working with and for you oh give
[1:45:00] the Lord some
[1:45:01] Praises how how do you think you come
[1:45:03] through all these years you think it was
[1:45:05] your strength and your ability and your
[1:45:07] might it was God overlooking your
[1:45:10] life you're not dead you are in the land
[1:45:14] of the living giv him praise you're not
[1:45:17] dead praise God it
[1:45:19] have okay things might be bad with you
[1:45:22] but it could have been worse
[1:45:24] is not worse give God some
[1:45:26] Praises glory to God Amen all
[1:45:30] right heing is set forth the love of God
[1:45:34] he desired in love to love a family of
[1:45:37] his own a family of sons like himself
[1:45:41] therefore before him lies all mankind as
[1:45:45] one lump of clay out of that same lump
[1:45:49] he will now make vessels unto honor and
[1:45:50] unto dishonor the choosing will be his
[1:45:54] own choosing then those chosen ones born
[1:45:59] of a
[1:46:00] spirit will be
[1:46:03] trained to conform to His
[1:46:06] Image in their
[1:46:08] walk every one of these words are
[1:46:10] weighted words I'm still reading will be
[1:46:15] trained that is to come into discipline

[1:58:06] satanical
[1:58:08] power they will seek to destroy the
[1:58:11] bride of Christ this is
[1:58:14] prophecy she will

[1:58:28] endure the prophecy from the message of
[1:58:30] Grace says what it says the Bible goes
[1:58:33] through persecution not my
[1:58:38] wrath did you get that the prophecy said

[1:58:58] coming upon the Earth for he loved his
[1:58:59] own loveed them until the
[1:59:02] end be zealous and repent now this false
[1:59:05] church had Zeal make no mistake about
[1:59:07] that but God is calling for another
[1:59:11] Zeal are you ready it's a Zeal to cry I
[1:59:14] am
[1:59:15] wrong now who is going to say he's
[1:59:18] wrong all this denomination is based
[1:59:21] upon the claim of to ity and that of God
[1:59:24] they all cannot be right they say they
[1:59:27] are right because they are the ones that
[1:59:28] are saying
[1:59:29] it but saying it doesn't make it so am I
[1:59:33] am the bride I'm the eye in the bride he
[1:59:35] I night
[1:59:36] talk but that will make it
[1:59:40] so you understand what I'm
[1:59:42] saying they are saying they right
[1:59:44] because they are the one seeing it but
[1:59:46] saying it doesn't make it so they need
[1:59:48] the Vindicated thust say the Lord of God
[1:59:51] and they don't have it now let me say
[1:59:54] this here I don't believe that God is
[1:59:56] calling only the forcely to repent in
[1:59:59] this verse he's talking to his elect
[2:00:02] they have some repenting to do
[2:00:07] too the elect have some repenting to do
[2:00:10] too many of his children are in those
[2:00:13] false
[2:00:14] churches they are those who speak to
[2:00:16] Ephesians are awake down the sleepest
[2:00:18] and arise from the dead to be asleep is
[2:00:20] not to be dead they are sleeping among
[2:00:22] the
[2:00:23] dead they're out there in dead you say
[2:00:27] denomination we say message Jes they are
[2:00:29] floating around and God Cries Out wake
[2:00:31] up repent of your Folly all
[2:00:35] right discipline this word discipline
[2:00:38] discipline is training that makes people
[2:00:40] more willing to
[2:00:41] obey or more able to control themselves
[2:00:45] often in the forms of rules and
[2:00:48] punishments if these are broken or the
[2:00:51] behavior produced by this
[2:00:53] training here we go in the Old Testament
[2:00:56] a father owned a great portion of ground
[2:00:58] he had hired
[2:01:00] servants uh and watch over his flock and
[2:01:02] when a child was born into the house the
[2:01:04] father didn't have the time to take care
[2:01:06] of his son the way he should he go and
[2:01:08] hire a tutor or a razor someone to
[2:01:10] educate a child here we go here's where
[2:01:12] I think the Pentecostal Church make
[2:01:13] their mistake when that son was born
[2:01:16] into the family he was a son at Birth
[2:01:20] but his inheritance was was not yet
[2:01:25] determined it depended on his
[2:01:30] character the birth part is not the
[2:01:33] issue the character patters so the son
[2:01:37] inheritance was connected to the
[2:01:39] son's
[2:01:41] character though being a son if he was
[2:01:44] disobedient son he would not inherit
[2:01:45] anything still he's a son but if he was
[2:01:48] an obedient son he was air to all things
[2:01:52] it's your character from then on that
[2:01:54] means the
[2:01:56] difference how do you get character
[2:01:58] you're not born with it cor is not a
[2:02:01] gift character is a victory and a
[2:02:03] victory mean test is given for you to
[2:02:05] overcome the only way you could know
[2:02:07] what in new is take the test how the
[2:02:10] teacher will know how the child is
[2:02:11] learning in in in in school give them a
[2:02:15] test and then you will see who learn
[2:02:17] what how is God going to know what we
[2:02:20] are learning what we are applying what
[2:02:22] we really believe give the test when the
[2:02:25] test come it exposes whether you have
[2:02:27] received it whether you learn it or
[2:02:29] whether you had to go through it again
[2:02:31] and you can't just skip
[2:02:35] grades if you didn't get it right it
[2:02:38] comes back
[2:02:42] again now the father be sure his son get
[2:02:45] the best opportunity that he would have
[2:02:46] he sought out a man that was capable of
[2:02:48] taking care of that son he would get a
[2:02:49] man that was honest and would bring
[2:02:51] correct reports to his boy's
[2:02:54] discipline so if the father asks the boy
[2:02:58] how so he was given the Holy Ghost of
[2:02:59] the tror to raise the church and he is
[2:03:02] the teacher and the Razer of the church
[2:03:04] and he will bring a COR report to the
[2:03:06] father what it becomes what if the boy
[2:03:09] is a rascal sort of boy roaming the
[2:03:11] street smoking cigarette drinking pool
[2:03:13] room rock and roll party and the father
[2:03:15] expecting to hear the news how is my
[2:03:16] child progressing Judah said oh he isn't
[2:03:19] very good now the father must drop his
[2:03:21] countenance what what's the matter with
[2:03:22] my son well he won't listen he's out
[2:03:24] with a bunch run all the time if the
[2:03:26] tutor worried to come before the father
[2:03:29] what does the Holy Ghost through tonight
[2:03:31] when it stands before God the Father to
[2:03:33] bring the condition of the church and he
[2:03:35] has to come and say them your sons that
[2:03:37] receive your spirit be born again is
[2:03:39] fussing and fighting in among one
[2:03:41] another there is no cooperation with
[2:03:43] them at all let's pause right
[2:03:46] here you see one just
[2:03:48] competition no cooperation
[2:03:53] once there is competition there is no
[2:03:57] cooperation why compete when God give
[2:04:01] gifts to men give different stations of
[2:04:03] Life To Men time and chance happen to
[2:04:05] all men so once somebody competing they
[2:04:08] can't cooperate let us do this together
[2:04:10] no why you want this one to be better
[2:04:12] you want that one to be better that's
[2:04:14] churches pastors ministers there's no
[2:04:17] cooperation them at all they won't even
[2:04:19] cooperate enough to have a Revival in
[2:04:20] the city what do you think the blessed
[2:04:21] Holy Ghost feasts when you have to bring
[2:04:23] that message before the
[2:04:26] father now
[2:04:28] remember if God has permitted sickness
[2:04:32] to come on
[2:04:34] you to bring you to
[2:04:38] discipline and you refuse to discipline
[2:04:40] yourself before God and step out the
[2:04:42] line don't come in
[2:04:44] here it might make you
[2:04:46] worse if you are sinful and you have
[2:04:50] unconfessed sin make it right with God
[2:04:53] before you come to God for
[2:04:55] prayer so don't just about pray for me
[2:04:57] pray for me what condition are you in
[2:05:00] wanting that prayer proverbs
