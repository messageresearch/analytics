[11:45] tonight jesus my ask it amen and amen
[11:48] god bless you and welcome tonight thanks
[11:50] for being here among us uh we certainly
[11:52] appreciate
[11:53] you being here
[11:55] and um i'd like to share something with
[11:57] you before we have two testimonies as
[12:00] we'll come up just a few moments but we
[12:02] want to share something with you tonight
[12:03] so
[12:04] god bless you if you have your bibles
[12:06] i'd like you to turn
[12:07] to hebrews chapter 2
[12:12] hebrews chapter 2
[12:14] i trust you are enjoying the lord
[12:16] enjoying the bible study the teaching
[12:19] the services the rhythmic services
[12:21] i trust them that you're receiving and
[12:23] you're applying what you're hearing
[12:25] and hebrews 2 says chapter 2 therefore
[12:28] we ought to give
[12:30] the more earnest heed to the things
[12:32] which we have heard
[12:34] least at any time we should let them
[12:36] slip
[12:37] for if the words spoken by angels were
[12:39] steadfast
[12:40] and every transgression and disobedience
[12:42] receive a just recompense
[12:45] of reward
[12:47] how shall we escape
[12:49] if we neglect
[12:51] so great salvation which at first began
[12:53] to be spoken by the lord
[12:55] and was confirmed unto us by them
[12:58] that heard him god bearing them witness
[13:00] both with signs and wonders and with
[13:02] diverse miracles
[13:04] and gifts
[13:05] of the holy ghost
[13:06] according to his own will
[13:08] for unto the angels had he not put in
[13:10] subjection the world to come wherever we
[13:12] speak
[13:13] but one
[13:15] in a certain place testified saying what
[13:17] is man
[13:18] about mindful of him or the son of man
[13:21] that dog visits in him
[13:23] though marries him to what man a little
[13:26] lower than the angels
[13:28] now crowned him with glory
[13:30] and honor and did set him
[13:32] over the works of thy hands
[13:34] though has put all things in subjection
[13:37] under his feet
[13:40] for in that he put all in subjection
[13:42] under him he left nothing that is not
[13:46] put under him
[13:47] but now we see not yet all things put
[13:50] under him
[13:51] i want to read that very amplified
[13:53] for you have put everything
[13:55] its subjection under his feet to what
[13:57] man
[13:58] now when putting everything in
[13:59] subjection to man he left nothing
[14:01] outside
[14:02] of man's
[14:03] control
[14:05] but at present
[14:07] we do not yet see all things
[14:11] subject to him man
[14:13] this night but we see jesus who was made
[14:16] a little lord of the angels
[14:19] for the suffering of death
[14:22] crowned with glory and honor
[14:24] that he
[14:25] by the grace of god should tease death
[14:27] for every man
[14:29] amplified
[14:30] we are able to see jesus
[14:33] who was ranked
[14:35] lower than the angels for a little while
[14:38] crowned with glory and honor because of
[14:41] his having suffered that in order that
[14:44] by his grace
[14:45] unmerited favor of god to us sinners
[14:48] he might experience debt
[14:50] for every
[14:52] individual person
[14:54] who is ten for it became him
[14:56] for whom are all things and by whom are
[14:59] all things
[15:00] in bringing many sons unto glory
[15:03] to make the captain of the salvation
[15:07] perfect through suffering
[15:09] amplified
[15:11] for it is an act worthy of god
[15:15] and fit into the divine nature that he
[15:18] for whose sake
[15:20] and by whom all things have the
[15:22] existence in bringing many sons into
[15:25] glory should make the pioneer of the
[15:28] salvation perfect
[15:30] should bring to maturity the human
[15:32] experience
[15:34] necessary to be perfectly equipped for
[15:37] his office
[15:38] as a high priest through suffering
[15:41] verse 11 for he
[15:43] both he that sanctified
[15:45] and they who are sanctified are all one
[15:48] for which cause he is not ashamed to
[15:51] call them brethren
[15:53] saying i will declare thy name unto my
[15:54] brethren in the midst of the church will
[15:56] i sing praises unto thee and again i'll
[15:58] put my trust in him and again the whole
[16:01] i and the cherubimist god has given me
[16:04] for as much here we go
[16:06] as the children which is us
[16:09] are partakers of flesh and blood
[16:12] he also likewise
[16:14] took part of the same
[16:16] and true death
[16:18] he might destroy him
[16:20] that had the power of debt
[16:22] that is of the devil
[16:24] the amplified
[16:26] since therefore
[16:28] these his children
[16:30] shear in flesh and blood
[16:33] in physical nature of human beings
[16:36] he himself in a similar manner partook
[16:40] of the same nature
[16:42] that by going through debt
[16:44] he might bring to note and make of no
[16:47] effect him
[16:49] who had power of death that is the devil
[16:51] verse 15 and delivered them who through
[16:54] fear of death
[16:55] were all their lifetime subject
[16:58] abundance
[16:59] for verily
[17:01] glory he took not on him the nature of
[17:03] angels
[17:04] but he took on him
[17:06] the seed of abraham
[17:08] and this verse here in the amplified
[17:10] says
[17:11] for as we all know he christ did not
[17:13] take hold of angels
[17:15] the fallen angels to give them helping
[17:17] and delivering hand but he did take hold
[17:20] of the fallen
[17:22] descendants of abraham
[17:24] to reach out
[17:26] to them
[17:27] a helping and delivering hand
[17:30] to 17.
[17:32] wherefore in all things it behooved him
[17:35] to be made like unto his brethren
[17:38] that he might be a merciful
[17:40] and faithful high priest in things
[17:43] pertaining to god
[17:45] to make reconciliation for the sins of
[17:48] his people
[17:49] humbly fighting 17 says so it is evident
[17:52] that it was essential
[17:54] that he be made like his brethren in
[17:56] every respect
[17:57] in order
[17:59] that he might become a merciful
[18:01] sympathetic
[18:02] and faithful high priest in the things
[18:06] related to god
[18:07] to make atonement
[18:09] and preparation for the sins of people's
[18:11] sins
[18:12] verse 18
[18:15] for in that he himself had suffered
[18:17] being tempted
[18:19] he is able to secure
[18:20] them that attempted
[18:22] the amplified
[18:24] for because he himself in his humanity
[18:27] has suffered in being tempted tested and
[18:30] tried he is able immediately to run
[18:34] to the cry
[18:36] assist relieve those
[18:38] who are being tempted
[18:39] tested and tried
[18:41] who therefore are being exposed to
[18:44] suffering may god bless this world isn't
[18:46] that a wonderful script to reading
[18:47] tonight
[18:48] that christ
[18:49] became one of us
[18:51] that we could become like him
[18:54] so that can't fail
[18:56] so even in your failures
[18:59] in your temptations
[19:01] in your suffering
[19:03] understand the mission that he came with
[19:05] he came to break the power of debt
[19:08] and spread the power of hell
[19:10] to bring liberty to the royal seas of
[19:13] abraham
[19:14] so tonight
[19:16] even though we were born in sin and
[19:18] shape iniquity christ came forward
[19:21] that we could get that big breakthrough
[19:24] you know what he did he called us
[19:25] bretville could we give the lord a hand
[19:27] the praise jesus call us brethren just a
[19:30] little more and we're going to hear from
[19:32] the rhetoric all right brother brown
[19:35] look when elijah was on the hill he said
[19:38] if i be a man of god let the fire fall
[19:40] and heaven will consume you
[19:42] and god be a witness he was a man of god
[19:45] god
[19:47] always be a witness
[19:49] your life will be a witness i don't know
[19:51] what your testimony is but your life
[19:53] speaks so loud your voice can be heard
[19:57] your living
[19:58] your everyday life will testify
[20:01] what you are
[20:03] hallelujah
[20:04] god be a witness yes the holy spirit is
[20:06] a seal and i see you takes both sides of
[20:10] the people
[20:11] do you see you standing here they see
[20:14] you when you go away not only in church
[20:16] but that everyday work you're sealed on
[20:18] both sides inside and outside by the jaw
[20:21] you have by the life that you live you
[20:23] are sealed in and outside and you know
[20:26] you are safe and the world knows you're
[20:28] saved by the life that you live
[20:30] he said brother
[20:31] when the world knows
[20:33] that you have been with jesus
[20:35] when you can live such an uncultivated
[20:37] life in this present world in this
[20:38] darkness that the world knows and can
[20:41] see that you have been with jesus
[20:43] when a rugged old vulgar prostitute on
[20:45] the street can become a lady washed in
[20:48] the blood of the lamb god
[20:50] is bearing witness that he lives
[20:53] take a drunkard who is so low down that
[20:55] he would run around on his wife and
[20:57] would mistreat his children and take the
[20:59] food from their table to spend on a
[21:01] prostitute let him get with jesus once
[21:04] you will see him returning like legion
[21:06] whereas in his right mind and close to
[21:08] his babies under his wife and to his
[21:10] loved ones suddenly
[21:12] almost finished here
[21:14] some time ago
[21:15] he's talking about
[21:17] a little doctor
[21:18] who went to give her testimony and spoke
[21:20] of christianity
[21:22] and he told the story of lady maccabee
[21:23] of oklahoma and america
[21:26] she was so ornery
[21:27] so lowed down till even when they went
[21:29] to kill her they wouldn't even put their
[21:31] hands on her
[21:32] she was so vulgar and vile they had her
[21:34] arrested on a charge smoking a cigar
[21:36] driving a stagecoach broke the laws the
[21:38] records in oklahoma when she passed
[21:40] through the street driving four headed
[21:42] horses she was so violent so dirty until
[21:45] society would even get around when she
[21:47] was that
[21:48] so much until when the executors was
[21:50] going to execute her they wouldn't even
[21:52] hang her
[21:53] just four times feathers on her to kill
[21:55] her
[21:56] and when this little preacher gave her
[21:57] story
[21:58] in such a way
[22:00] till he had the people sitting on the
[22:02] edge of their seats listening what would
[22:04] be next
[22:06] and when he got down to that very vile
[22:08] dirty louder until the lords wouldn't
[22:10] even want to fool with her she was so
[22:12] low the very devil in hell would reject
[22:14] the chocolate snail the way he told the
[22:16] story
[22:17] and when he said gentleman of the
[22:19] religions of the world
[22:21] has your religion cut anything that
[22:23] would clean the hands of lady macabee
[22:25] everybody set still
[22:27] and then he clapped his hands together
[22:29] and jumped in the air he said glory be
[22:31] to god the blood of jesus christ won't
[22:33] only clean her hands but they will clean
[22:35] her heart and make her his bride
[22:38] and then go around begin to sing amazing
[22:40] grace
[22:41] how sweet the song that see the rest
[22:43] like me
[22:45] you say
[22:46] how shall we escape if we dig like such
[22:49] you get to eat
[22:51] you will die
[22:52] you neglected in a corner you would
[22:54] wreck
[22:55] you neglect to melt the cow she will go
[22:57] dry you neglect your teeth you'll have
[23:00] them pulled out certainly you will pay
[23:02] for your neglection oh branham
[23:04] tabernacle are you visitors let me tell
[23:07] you something now
[23:10] you neglect to testify
[23:12] of the glory of god
[23:14] you neglect to give god the praise and
[23:16] the glory you would find yourself
[23:19] cool
[23:21] former
[23:22] and pakistan one of these days
[23:24] you give god praise how shall we escape
[23:28] if we neglect such a great salvation
[23:30] and this is the last thing i have here
[23:32] oh christ
[23:33] when i read here how they wondered about
[23:35] in sheepskins goatskin
[23:37] live in the dens of the earth and caves
[23:40] they wandered about under vile
[23:41] persecution and yet obtained defeat
[23:44] under the ministry of angels how will we
[23:46] escape when the lord jesus give us fine
[23:49] homes and cars and clothes and food and
[23:53] we murmur we sit around we are lazy we
[23:57] never try to get out and do something
[23:58] about it
[23:59] how will we escape god
[24:01] who i pray that you will burn old
[24:03] fashioned conviction into every heart of
[24:05] god in every heart this morning we say
[24:08] tonight lord that people might be up and
[24:10] at it let us work
[24:12] but the daylight is shining because the
[24:14] sun is swiftly sinking
[24:16] and civilization is going and there'll
[24:18] be no more time to blend eternity god
[24:21] grant today
[24:23] that we go with a fresh vision with
[24:25] wisdom
[24:26] with understanding to know
[24:29] how to approach sinners
[24:31] and bring them to christ
[24:33] hear the prayer of your servant lord so
[24:35] he said if we neglect to testify
[24:37] if we neglect to give god praise and
[24:39] glory we find ourselves back sitting
[24:41] someday and i'm so happy
[24:43] that we have
[24:44] a veteran who willing to testify and
[24:46] give a testimony one brother assured me
[24:48] he felt like if he even testified he was
[24:50] going to burst he just had was to say
[24:52] something it was almost as if god opened
[24:54] up a well god open up a channel that he
[24:57] could express
[24:58] the grace of god to his life
[25:00] and i believe that what that's what
[25:02] we're going to see tonight god's grace
[25:04] on people's lives oh god kept them oh
[25:07] god dealt with them and god led them and
[25:09] and we we're going to see that because
[25:11] as the prophet said that
[25:13] when we get on the other side we'll be
[25:15] surprised to know who's there
[25:17] the strugglers the weak ones the ones
[25:19] that jim might even think gonna make it
[25:20] they're gonna make it because of god's
[25:22] grace because of god love jesus didn't
[25:24] come for strong people he came for the
[25:26] weak he came for the downtrodden he came
[25:28] for the accident he came for the sinners
[25:30] he came that's why when he was among
[25:32] them the scribe and pharisees had a
[25:34] problem dealing with that he said this
[25:36] man
[25:38] would find bibles he would be moving
[25:40] with his sinners
[25:41] jesus told them this the well don't need
[25:43] of a physician but the sick they do they
[25:46] need a physician do you need a physician
[25:47] tonight if you're not well in heart and
[25:49] mind and spirit
[25:51] then christ could minister to you by
[25:53] something somebody says testify
[25:56] everybody have a story
[25:58] every one of you have a story story only
[26:01] you can tell
[26:02] it's your story
[26:03] it's not a story how strong you are the
[26:06] story of the grace of god comes into
[26:09] your life i have a story
[26:11] i have a testimony
[26:13] and the key
[26:14] just as you have also and the key to it
[26:17] is is what do you learn from what you go
[26:19] through
[26:20] more than anything else and i hope that
[26:22] it will resonate in your heart are you
[26:25] learning because to grow is to learn
[26:28] we don't want you just come to church we
[26:30] want you to sit back
[26:32] listen
[26:33] learn
[26:34] grow you might want to look back and say
[26:36] you know what i was this way two years
[26:38] ago but i'm changed now i'm being more
[26:40] patient and being more willing to wait
[26:42] upon the lord you hear me share
[26:44] something on you about the beauty of
[26:46] holiness and i send out a text and
[26:48] something like that that you could
[26:49] reflect on the scriptures and they
[26:51] reflect on what god is speaking to your
[26:53] heart that you could begin to think i
[26:54] want to be like him i want to be an
[26:57] under sanctification i want to be where
[26:59] i could guide not just my heart but
[27:01] before you could guard your heart you
[27:03] have to guide your mind
[27:04] because every day you are bombarded by
[27:06] thoughts by words like texts by messages
[27:10] and everything and then if you stay too
[27:12] long
[27:13] holding these things drops into your
[27:15] heart and then give your desire and that
[27:17] desire is what will drive people that
[27:20] lust that desire so by god's grace and
[27:23] god's help i trust then that
[27:25] the word become the legislation of your
[27:27] heart
[27:28] but you see
[27:30] really why god will tell joshua meditate
[27:33] on the word day at night

[27:37] one tablet and you threw it in and you
[27:39] take a pill and you're okay no you fight

[28:56] short testimony of the grace of god in
[28:58] my life are you hearing me okay yes
[29:01] okay
[29:02] um
[29:04] i was 19 years old when
[29:06] the lord called me
[29:08] i come from a very strong a very staunch
[29:11] catholic background
[29:13] um
[29:15] i had my first job at age 19 at inven
[29:18] revenue
[29:19] and i remember very distinct it was a
[29:21] monday at lunch time i was walking
[29:23] through woodford square on my way to
[29:25] lunch and i was thinking i said no one
[29:28] knows anything about god and i wish that
[29:31] i could find somebody who did
[29:35] lo and behold wednesday of that week my
[29:37] supervisor came to me and she said
[29:39] listen i have someone who's going to be
[29:41] your understudy you have to teach this
[29:42] person the ropes and show them
[29:44] everything that you knew i said fine i
[29:46] agree
[29:47] the new recruit stood before me wearing
[29:49] a long sleeve shirt buttoned up to the
[29:51] neck and down to the cuffs of this
[29:54] sleeve down down there at the sleeve
[29:57] i took one look at him and i thought oh
[29:59] my
[30:01] you look like you are something else
[30:04] um before i could say a word he said do
[30:06] you know jesus
[30:08] so i was really taken aback you know so
[30:11] and he repeated do you know jesus
[30:14] i said no i have a nodding acquaintance
[30:17] with him he said a nodding acquaintance
[30:19] that's not good enough
[30:21] i asked who are you
[30:23] and he said i am ricardo bramble
[30:27] minister of god
[30:28] and that's how i met brother ikaru he
[30:31] spoke about god all day long and i
[30:34] listened to him all day long i was so
[30:36] intrigued to learn about the holy ghost
[30:39] and baptism in jesus name serpent seed
[30:42] and lots more
[30:43] i felt i was being given a handbook to
[30:46] the message
[30:48] he told me all about the glory days when
[30:50] brothers would board the bus to san
[30:51] fernando and
[30:53] preach all the way
[30:55] you know they would be preaching to the
[30:57] people i said so how did the people
[30:58] react to this he said well they couldn't
[31:00] do anything else they were a captive
[31:01] audience they couldn't jump up the bus
[31:03] and they had to listen to us preach
[31:05] and he said along the way some of the
[31:07] people are actually clapping and singing
[31:09] and some were upset and say you will
[31:11] find that you know some of them dictate
[31:13] and some did not but they got an
[31:14] opportunity to preach and as he was
[31:16] talking i wish i was there in those days
[31:19] when everything was so you know exciting
[31:21] it seemed to me like it was that way so
[31:23] i said how do you know all this stuff
[31:25] about god and everything and he said
[31:27] well god sent a prophet his name is
[31:29] william marion branham 20th century
[31:31] prophet so i i made a connection i said
[31:34] that is what i wanted to know i wanted
[31:36] to find somebody who knew about god and
[31:38] this is the man william marion branham i
[31:41] said how can i meet him i want to talk
[31:43] to him i still have so many questions i
[31:45] want to ask him he said well he's dead
[31:47] i was so disappointed he said but wait
[31:50] you know he's he he has books and tapes
[31:52] that he's left behind so we can i bring
[31:55] you some books and some tips and i
[31:57] started to read the books and listen to
[31:58] the tips and from that time until now
[32:01] every time i pick up a book
[32:04] i am in floods of tales i cannot read a
[32:06] spoken word book without ending up very
[32:08] emotional i just get so involved in it
[32:11] and the spirit of gorgeous
[32:13] it's just amazing every time
[32:16] i may have read a book years ago and
[32:18] i'll go now and pick it up and it has
[32:20] the same effect on me every time
[32:22] floods of tears
[32:24] um
[32:26] but ricardo never smiled later on he
[32:28] lightened up but at that time he was a
[32:30] very serious person
[32:32] so he would rebuke the ladies in the
[32:35] office about their short skills and
[32:36] their makeup and he would talk to them
[32:38] men about their misbehavior and so on so
[32:41] i asked him one day i said do you know
[32:43] that
[32:44] what you are called at the office you
[32:45] have a name here you know that he said
[32:47] no what do they call me i said they call
[32:49] you fire and brimstone bramble
[32:52] well he started to laugh i never saw him
[32:55] laugh in my life he laughed and laughed
[32:57] and laughed he said that's what they're
[32:58] calling me and say yes they call you
[32:59] fire and brimstone bramble he said well
[33:02] at least they're getting the message
[33:04] and to cut a short long long a story uh
[33:08] a long story short we became great
[33:10] friends
[33:11] and his wife and i we became great
[33:13] friends and they are both deceased now
[33:15] but they played a really major part in
[33:18] initiating me into the message and
[33:21] understanding all about god and
[33:22] everything else i became i got baptized
[33:25] one month later
[33:27] and uh my sister who was supposed to
[33:30] join the nunnery came to my baptism i
[33:33] used to talk to her about the message
[33:35] and about the prophet and so on i didn't
[33:37] even know if she took me on but she came
[33:39] to my baptism
[33:41] and um
[33:42] she
[33:44] was so touched by it
[33:46] something happened she had an epic
[33:49] experience with the presence of god
[33:51] and she immediately changed her mind
[33:53] about becoming a nun and she decided i
[33:55] want to get baptized she said i like
[33:57] what is happening here this has really
[33:59] touched me
[34:00] and um
[34:01] since that time
[34:03] the lord has really dealt with me over
[34:05] the years and i realized that i was full
[34:09] of head knowledge but i had no heart
[34:11] experience and i wanted an experience of
[34:13] the heart with the lord i knew a lot of
[34:15] things i had a lot of knowledge and so
[34:17] on but i didn't have that hard
[34:19] experience so i was looking for that and
[34:21] longing for that throughout the years
[34:24] um
[34:24] over time
[34:26] i got married
[34:27] to my darling husband barry o'brien
[34:30] we met and we got married and my husband
[34:33] or my children often ask me so mommy why
[34:35] did you marry daddy so i said well
[34:38] he has a lovely smile and beautiful
[34:40] teeth and they didn't buy that at all
[34:42] they say come on mommy tell us the truth
[34:44] so i did i said well at the time
[34:46] um in those days
[34:48] young man didn't dress like that he did
[34:50] he had his tie and his shirt and when he
[34:52] was ready for church he had a big bible
[34:54] in his hand in those days brothers
[34:57] flashed their bible like a sword it
[34:59] wasn't a shame to walk around with her
[35:00] bible you know it was a thing i mean you
[35:03] were subject to ridicule just being
[35:05] looked at like that but he didn't care
[35:07] he
[35:08] walked he said i'm dressing for jesus
[35:10] and he would dress in his until and
[35:12] walk with his bible in his hand
[35:14] so um he was he's also a prayer warrior
[35:19] five o'clock in the morning he's up
[35:21] praying and he has been like that all
[35:23] the time so i admire that you know and
[35:25] so
[35:26] that was the person i wanted in my life
[35:29] out of that bond came two beautiful
[35:31] children
[35:32] like
[35:33] anthony
[35:34] and you know in your christian journey
[35:35] god comes and he confirms to you that
[35:37] he's with you
[35:39] he's with you and he's real and that
[35:40] really does a lot for your faith and
[35:42] everything else um
[35:46] that was in the 80s in 1983 i skipped
[35:49] over to 1983
[35:51] um that was the ceiling season when the
[35:53] spirit the holy ghost was falling and
[35:55] people were getting packed out and it
[35:57] was a wonderful marvelous time the young
[36:00] people were being sealed and the older
[36:02] ones were just getting their experiences
[36:03] and wave after wave of the holy spirit
[36:06] was just flowing over the people and so
[36:08] on and um
[36:11] uh
[36:12] we had belmont on fire that year really
[36:15] really the place was on fire everybody
[36:18] knew well you know
[36:19] here it is there's a bunch of people
[36:21] down there just experiencing something
[36:23] really special from god and we created
[36:25] quite a hullabaloo in belmont the church
[36:28] went from house to house after a while
[36:31] having cottage meetings house meetings
[36:33] and our apartment we were newly married
[36:36] so
[36:37] it was our turn
[36:38] to host the cottage meeting so we went
[36:40] to our landlady and we told her um
[36:44] we told her that we were going to have a
[36:46] meeting she said no problem at the time
[36:48] uh
[36:50] life was tough we wanted our rent to be
[36:52] lowered so we could live and eat so we
[36:53] approached her and she wasn't too crazy
[36:55] about that so we went to the rent
[36:57] assessment board and she wasn't happy
[36:58] about that either
[37:00] and um so i don't know how she managed
[37:02] to allow us to have the meeting but we
[37:04] did
[37:05] and as we were there we made a lot of
[37:08] noise the next day she was really upset
[37:10] with us
[37:11] and um
[37:13] this is just a story to let you know
[37:15] that god is god is with you god is with
[37:17] you whether you're me or whoever it is
[37:20] god is in your life and he works on your
[37:22] behalf
[37:23] so
[37:25] this was my first contact with
[37:27] witchcraft i guess you know in different
[37:29] countries which craft raises its head
[37:32] here we have something called the obia
[37:35] in
[37:37] in jamaica he's called a shepherd or a
[37:39] captain
[37:40] in haiti he's called a a huguan or
[37:42] onugan
[37:44] and in louisiana he's called a root
[37:46] worker or the conjure man and in
[37:48] trinidad we have the obia man and our
[37:51] landlady saw it fit to seek some extra
[37:54] help to get these tenants out
[37:56] so my seamstress who knew the obia man
[37:59] very well saw her coming out and she's
[38:01] when she went to him and she said what
[38:03] is that lady doing there what did she
[38:04] want she said she wants to get
[38:06] he wants she wants to get her tenants
[38:08] out of the apartment she said what did
[38:10] you tell her what did you tell the lady
[38:12] he said well i told her
[38:14] i can't do anything to those people you
[38:17] see those people they have something
[38:19] around them
[38:21] something protecting them that i just
[38:23] can't touch them at all
[38:25] and my mind was blown i was like oh my
[38:28] god and you know after that my prayer
[38:31] always included thank you lord for your
[38:33] hedge of protection around me father
[38:37] thank you jesus so he does these things
[38:39] to show you that he's with you you're
[38:41] not alone
[38:43] on this journey of life
[38:46] um
[38:47] i saw that um that showed itself up
[38:49] later as well when my husband was um
[38:52] abducted
[38:53] trying to work do extra work to get
[38:55] extra money to
[38:57] look after the family
[38:59] that's his story really but i'll just
[39:00] tell you my part of the story he was
[39:02] abducted by four young men who looked
[39:04] just like men from church normal looking
[39:06] so he didn't know that they were bandits
[39:08] he said they didn't look like like
[39:09] robbers or anything they abducted him
[39:11] took him away and the first thing he
[39:13] told him was i am a christian and i love
[39:16] the lord
[39:17] he threw out his acts he said i'm a
[39:19] christian and i love the lord and that
[39:20] must have given them a joke because
[39:22] later on
[39:23] when they were going to when they were
[39:24] deciding to kill him or not i don't know
[39:26] what happened one of the guys said don't
[39:30] kill him and that must have been around
[39:32] the time and i got up around four
[39:33] o'clock that morning my husband not at
[39:35] home and i'm wondering where is he and i
[39:37] felt that something was wrong something
[39:40] woke me up to pray and i started to pray
[39:41] pray pray pray i don't know what i was
[39:43] praying for prayed for him pray pray
[39:45] pray but it was just about that time
[39:46] when they were deciding should we kill
[39:48] him or not
[39:49] and one of them said no we're not gonna
[39:51] kill him gonna leave him here we're
[39:53] gonna take the car they wanted the car
[39:55] so they took the car
[39:56] and when he came home and he gave me
[39:57] that testimony i said around what time
[39:59] that would have been that that happened
[40:01] he said around 4ish
[40:03] so so god will wake you up to pray he
[40:05] will do things he will speak into your
[40:07] life you have to listen listen to that
[40:10] it speaks to you all the time
[40:13] um
[40:14] moving on quickly
[40:17] the time i lost my job that was an epic
[40:20] experience to me
[40:22] i was promoted from a teacher out in the
[40:24] classroom
[40:26] early childhood facilitator i had my own
[40:28] office i was in charge of the whole of
[40:29] the east and i felt really fine and
[40:32] important i said wow i've arrived you
[40:34] know this is great
[40:36] and one day i sat down early morning in
[40:39] the office and a voice said to me what
[40:41] if you lose that job
[40:44] and i said wow
[40:45] and the thought would not go away
[40:48] so i said lord i don't care
[40:50] i will serve you whether i had a job or
[40:52] not i will serve you whether i have a
[40:54] house or not i will no matter what
[40:57] happens in my life i will serve you
[40:59] anyhow
[41:00] one week later i applied for no feeling
[41:03] one month later i was told i abandoned
[41:05] my job
[41:06] two months later i lost my job
[41:09] and every door seemed to just shut down
[41:11] i went back to the ministry chatted with
[41:13] them nothing to be done one woman told
[41:15] me she said people who do that don't
[41:17] ever get their job back that is it for
[41:19] you i prayed i prayed i went to a bit of
[41:22] deep depression really depressed all the
[41:25] promises i made to god throughout the
[41:26] winter
[41:28] serious depression and praying praying
[41:30] my husband encouraging me standing by my
[41:32] side telling me you know you must be
[41:34] tested you're a christian you're going
[41:35] to be tested you have to go through your
[41:37] test this is your test
[41:38] at the time i didn't see it as a test i
[41:40] said oh god this is so unfortunate why
[41:42] me
[41:43] and then one day i went to church and
[41:44] brother ovid was preaching and he said
[41:46] he gave his experience of being on the
[41:48] job and
[41:50] uh
[41:51] wanting changes and so on things to
[41:54] happen and
[41:55] he realized that he had the wrong
[41:56] attitude
[41:57] and that that made me realize lord you
[41:59] know i don't have the right attitude i'm
[42:01] complaining i'm carrying on and i went
[42:03] home and i prayed right over i prayed i
[42:05] said lord
[42:06] i'm sorry forgive me i know i have the
[42:08] wrong attitude please forgive me i'm
[42:10] gonna start all over again with this
[42:12] like thank you for this test that you're
[42:13] putting me through i see it as a test
[42:15] loan and i accept it and right after
[42:18] that everything changed
[42:20] everything started to change immediately
[42:23] the ministry called me and they say miss
[42:25] o'brien um we have a letter here for you
[42:28] do you know that three years ago you
[42:29] were given a letter to return to it i

[42:35] over trying this right they said the
[42:37] letter is in your file i said i did not
[42:39] receive it
[42:40] he sent me another turn on the
[42:42] department they worked this out with
[42:43] that all with that out a week a week
[42:46] after that a letter came in the mail

[46:24] they call them in a kind of surprise way
[46:26] but anyhow we're always good to give
[46:28] glory unto god
[46:30] um
[46:31] my journey was
[46:33] quite intriguing
[46:36] um
[46:38] at a young age
[46:39] i wouldn't went to fatima college and um
[46:42] i wasn't successful in my exams and
[46:45] i used to
[46:46] where's about at least 17 18 years old
[46:49] now
[46:50] i used to watch the hills
[46:52] and tom stayed along in woodbrook and
[46:54] watch up to the hills and wonder
[46:56] what is beyond those hills and what is
[46:58] in the sky and
[47:01] where is this god and you know like
[47:04] where would i go in my life not having
[47:07] my subjects and all this thing and just
[47:10] keep thinking thinking and um
[47:13] just so i started to read the whole
[47:16] bible i found
[47:17] and started getting into proverbs and
[47:20] things that had moved me and shaped me
[47:23] and then eventually one day i met a guy
[47:27] who said um as brother robert robert who
[47:30] said um you know god sent up he got a
[47:33] message i say no he's early messages god
[47:35] sent a prophet
[47:37] i say what prophet you say yes look a
[47:39] book here and saturday and so on
[47:42] and i got enthused into it and kept
[47:45] following and kept following that was
[47:47] about 19
[47:50] 1972 and i kept falling and joined many
[47:54] churches was in and out and in an
[47:56] alternative
[47:58] till i reached a high place in a big
[48:00] church so to speak and um
[48:03] but i wasn't satisfied that
[48:06] i knew my life
[48:08] wasn't changed i was i was reformed but
[48:10] i wasn't changed
[48:12] i was reforming rituals and wearing
[48:15] right clothes and no doing don't smoke
[48:17] don't do this to do that but i wasn't
[48:21] i didn't reach the peak that i thought i
[48:23] would have reached
[48:24] and um
[48:26] eventually things happened that
[48:28] i went the wrong way
[48:30] temptation and
[48:32] um
[48:33] the people there weren't able to help me
[48:35] to get out of what i was in
[48:37] and i sit down here listen to all these
[48:40] other
[48:41] preaching and teachings and um
[48:43] not being able to get out i want to get
[48:46] out like i've been in a hole in
[48:48] something and i can't reach the way i
[48:50] want to reach
[48:51] and i decided um this after 20 years
[48:54] following this message you decided um
[48:57] i going back anyway let's see if i'm
[48:58] gonna go let go go find me
[49:01] and i left we went back in the world and
[49:04] did all i shouldn't do
[49:06] but i kept saying god will find me and
[49:08] if i my son like god god will come for
[49:10] me
[49:11] and strange enough in um
[49:13] 1920
[49:16] 12 i believe it was
[49:18] yeah 2012 i got a phone call from a
[49:20] minister
[49:22] brother to you of it say now i'm having
[49:24] three nights meeting and i want you to
[49:26] come three days meeting
[49:28] it was uh i think it was independence i
[49:31] believe it was a friday saturday sunday
[49:34] so i said i'd come
[49:36] the friday i didn't go
[49:38] this saturday i didn't go
[49:40] and saturday night i said listen you
[49:42] thought you might come the coming you
[49:43] better find yourself there you know
[49:45] so
[49:46] i found myself in
[49:48] headstone
[49:50] on that sunday morning
[49:52] and when i came in to hit soon
[49:56] i just felt like something that's
[50:00] like someone
[50:02] something that's
[50:03] in in and we looked me in and said
[50:06] welcome you reach home
[50:08] and i've been there for the past nine
[50:09] years
[50:10] and everything in my life all the wrongs
[50:13] all the
[50:14] questions everything just melt and i
[50:17] believe that
[50:19] i got grounded into
[50:21] a fellowship with the lord jesus christ
[50:25] and um
[50:27] i get rooted but well what i did i did
[50:30] so the very children say it's hard
[50:33] but i don't live with it
[50:34] no problem the grace of god is there to
[50:36] support me
[50:38] and um i'm striving i'm coming along
[50:41] um i know a lot of things i i've been a
[50:44] place where you know i mysteriously sort
[50:47] of speak not not for what not wanting to
[50:50] speak i said i was in a mysterious place
[50:52] and
[50:56] while he was preaching sometimes god had
[50:59] a man backslide of to be phoned
[51:02] and um
[51:03] i i i am i am i am totally convinced i
[51:08] am totally settled i'm looking for the
[51:10] supernatural
[51:12] the one of the scriptures that started
[51:14] me
[51:15] from even before i came into the message
[51:18] was
[51:19] the lord jesus christ said peter said
[51:21] repent be baptized and you shall receive
[51:23] the gift of the holy ghost
[51:25] i was a roman catholic but i can't get
[51:28] this holy ghost at all because every
[51:30] saturday i go confession sunday take
[51:32] communion and money back in sin
[51:35] so i can't get this one he goes to this
[51:37] whole egos is always
[51:39] something that i want to get what is
[51:43] this holy ghost
[51:44] and this after in this point in time
[51:49] i am still striving looking and i know
[51:53] by little things that happen within me
[51:56] and i know that god
[51:58] is just watching over me
[52:00] that i'm in the arms awkward
[52:03] jump high exam blue how many arms are
[52:05] good and god has been blessing providing
[52:08] a given or taken you know life is sweet
[52:11] and um
[52:13] i enjoy
[52:15] the lord jesus christ in every way and
[52:18] like i was telling somebody i do have to
[52:20] go hollywood to see no movie i pick up
[52:22] my bible you read about jacob read about
[52:24] this one read about that one
[52:27] he picked his events in life creed but
[52:29] noah you know yeah and all kinds of
[52:32] things you know men like judah and what
[52:34] they do and what they know and this and
[52:36] that and
[52:37] i say man you know i was in hollywood
[52:39] now all my intrigue is in the bible you
[52:43] know and that's my joy the will of god
[52:46] and um this is not my simple testimony
[52:48] just me punch and shoot
[52:51] so bless hope it will be a blessing i
[52:53] know there too you know but it's the
[52:55] grace of god for my life that knowing i
[52:58] could i used to sit down in bars and see
[53:00] people going to church and tell people
[53:02] i'm going to treat when i did this again
[53:04] you know i just take in the spirit yeah
[53:06] but it is wrong spirit i going back look
[53:08] at the right spirit
[53:10] and you know
[53:12] that's that's all my life
[53:14] so
[53:16] peace and love i enjoy the lord jesus i
[53:18] enjoy the fellowship i enjoy the virgin
[53:21] you have to live you have to prove that
[53:23] your fruit is good and you know be

[53:35] best
[53:37] and make it every day you're conscious
[53:39] that you know what you're called to do
[53:42] and try to speak because i have a lot of
[53:44] words i like to make a lot of joke i
[53:46] always riddle in something within
[53:47] something
[53:49] but i don't like that danielle because i

[54:50] thank you for your mercy
[54:52] praise the lord you know it's very odd
[54:56] um
[54:58] considerable punch i
[55:00] met brother punch
[55:03] i think maybe 20 something years years
[55:06] ago
[55:07] the service i was in in barataria i met
[55:09] for the punch
[55:10] and something struck me about him
[55:13] i
[55:14] i don't know if we even spoke
[55:16] but i i i know him from i think i met
[55:20] him
[55:21] and
[55:22] somehow
[55:24] it's almost like if you be a witness of
[55:26] somebody
[55:27] be a record of somebody
[55:29] and i always wanted to meet him again
[55:33] and i don't know why
[55:35] so it was at the funeral of my
[55:38] daughter-in-law's mother which is such a
[55:40] great sister arlene
[55:42] at that funeral
[55:44] at mrs 2012
[55:46] i saw him in the funeral for the first
[55:48] time after so many years
[55:50] and when i saw him i knew i had us to go
[55:53] and stick to him
[55:55] i just knew that
[55:56] i didn't know he was back sitting i
[55:58] didn't know what was his condition
[56:00] and so on i didn't have any idea of him
[56:02] at all i lost track of him for many many
[56:04] years
[56:06] and
[56:07] when
[56:08] i spoke to him and he came that sunday
[56:11] he never misses he never turned back
[56:14] after that and that is
[56:16] the grease and the mercy and the
[56:18] presence and power of god i certainly
[56:20] appreciate him
[56:21] and i invited him to be one of the
[56:23] trustees in the church
[56:25] and he told me you know
[56:28] previously in some other church
[56:29] distrusting his problems because when he
[56:32] you like to stick with the books and
[56:33] whatnot and
[56:35] one time they give an account they want
[56:36] to do things different i said no no no i
[56:39] said we want accountability we want
[56:41] things to be in order and i trust them i
[56:43] said have to feel free and have the
[56:45] liberty to share with us what we need to
[56:47] do and how to do it and so on like that
[56:49] i said um
[56:50] we we here are different
[56:52] you know and um i am so happy and
[56:54] pleased with him he said my brother ovid
[56:57] he said you don't have to worry you'll
[56:59] take care of things and so far he has i
[57:02] certainly appreciate and assume we
[57:03] should give god a good praise offering
[57:06] for brother like brother punch
[57:08] and um you know who have a heart for the
[57:10] things of god and the people of god and
[57:13] reminds me a bit of like oh but a monday
[57:15] we operate but amanda's always having
[57:17] something to do around the church he's
[57:19] painting he's cleaning he's always doing
[57:21] something you love the law you love
[57:23] god's people love to see things in order
[57:25] and we appreciate that so much and i
[57:27] really appreciate the fine people that
[57:30] god choose the cinemath to give us that
[57:32] kind of support and everything else the
[57:34] church is not a one-man show i don't
[57:36] believe in that i
[57:38] i saw how um churches manage how
[57:41] ministers managed over the years and i
[57:43] told god i would not do that i wouldn't
[57:46] um rule these people with rigor you know
[57:48] i would do completely different and um
[57:51] because they controlled people's lives
[57:53] and and manipulate and
[57:55] work on a psychology and i reject all of
[57:57] that i was prepared to reboot my whole
[58:00] thinking
[58:01] and viewing god's people and how
[58:04] the care of god
[58:05] comes down to god's people
[58:07] and realizing that um
[58:10] that i'm just like you um i see myself
[58:12] called to an office and function in that
[58:14] office
[58:16] and because i function at office i have
[58:17] to do certain things preach and so on
[58:19] like that but it's not as if i am up
[58:21] there somewhere in the sky floating like
[58:23] some angel
[58:24] and you all that don dear you know like
[58:27] needed like me to send manna or anything
[58:29] like that no we are all waiting upon the
[58:32] lord we all have that call of god to
[58:35] come to perfection
[58:37] we all have that call of god to be in
[58:39] the upper room
[58:40] and says don't like to talk about it but
[58:42] when they were in the upper room
[58:45] they were all waiting on the holy ghost
[58:48] they were waiting to be placed
[58:49] positionally by god
[58:51] because remember
[58:52] the holy ghost uh the god was above
[58:55] pillar fire and cloud
[58:56] and eureka had it when the club began to
[58:59] move you have to move when the pillar
[59:01] fire began to move you had to move you
[59:02] guys say well you know i mean i can't
[59:04] feel the move no you know no no you move
[59:06] by the cloud you move by the pillar of
[59:08] fire
[59:09] and that pillar fan club became into a
[59:11] man a pillar of fire took flesh on it
[59:13] and that was jesus christ when he came
[59:15] he said i am with you but the comforter
[59:18] whom the father will send he is going to
[59:20] be in you
[59:21] another comforter you call him another
[59:23] comforter and he call it also the spirit
[59:25] of truth not truth not just truth but
[59:28] the spirit of truth i like what elisa
[59:30] says she had a
[59:31] but she wanted to get this heart
[59:33] experience
[59:34] and that is where the spirit of truth
[59:36] comes not just truth
[59:37] so when brother byron said out of a true
[59:40] seed of the word called to present
[59:41] christ with a beloved bride it means
[59:43] that it had people with false seed but
[59:46] written true seed now you get christ
[59:48] bride being hewn out from the cloth of
[59:50] the world so we are not here just to say
[59:53] we have a church over here in church we
[59:55] are here to actually become the word so
[59:58] that is very important that you seek to
[1:00:01] know what god has said i like just
[1:00:03] identify this way you seek to know the
[1:00:06] prophet's prophecy
[1:00:08] life here people talk about brother
[1:00:09] branham talk about he went up in your
[1:00:11] canyon and they know all his life and
[1:00:13] when he went here and there in chicago
[1:00:15] and this and that
[1:00:16] what i want to know is what did he
[1:00:18] prophesy
[1:00:19] what is to be here
[1:00:21] you see and when you see what is
[1:00:23] prophesied then you could hold on to the
[1:00:26] prophecy
[1:00:27] of the lord god said lord to your life
[1:00:30] so this is what it's all about so i
[1:00:31] really thank god for a punch and i know
[1:00:34] every one of you tonight uh have a
[1:00:37] testimony every one of you tonight have
[1:00:39] something that you could share and that
[1:00:41] is so great i remember
[1:00:43] myself coming to the lord
[1:00:46] and strange enough she called his name
[1:00:47] ricardo brandon carol brambles elisha he
[1:00:50] was about two years
[1:00:52] or three years higher than me and since
[1:00:54] even scholarly princess strong where i
[1:00:55] went to school
[1:00:56] and he gave me a book spoke my book and
[1:00:58] i never take mine to it
[1:01:00] i think i slept on the bed never read it
[1:01:03] and um he was a great testifier and so
[1:01:06] on know he passed
[1:01:08] and um
[1:01:09] one day i was a catholic myself i got
[1:01:12] invited by while berlin brother prince
[1:01:14] long san fernando was obliquely opposite
[1:01:16] our house in salt
[1:01:17] and he invited me to listen to tape i
[1:01:19] believe the tape was
[1:01:21] etude excellence
[1:01:23] and when i listened to that tape
[1:01:25] i mean i was here but around voice
[1:01:27] something struck me
[1:01:29] and he just asked me do you believe that
[1:01:31] that this is god's prophet and i just
[1:01:33] say yes
[1:01:34] i just received it the very first city
[1:01:38] that i heard
[1:01:39] and then he gave me a message a book
[1:01:42] and when he gave me this spoken word
[1:01:43] book i said but i have one like this
[1:01:45] under my bed home
[1:01:47] and when i look was another message i
[1:01:48] was there
[1:01:49] and i remember
[1:01:51] telling my parents that i want to go and
[1:01:53] get baptized i want to go and save the
[1:01:55] lord and my parents i got rebuked
[1:01:57] um then i catholic the whole family is
[1:01:59] catholic i got rebuked
[1:02:01] and i remember that night i cried
[1:02:03] i cried and i said lord
[1:02:06] you will bring me back to this someday
[1:02:08] so i cannot leave it alone i remember
[1:02:10] 1974
[1:02:12] walking in south and under bypass and i
[1:02:14] said god
[1:02:15] i said i don't know you
[1:02:17] please please could you reveal yourself
[1:02:19] to me this coming year i was 1974
[1:02:23] i was 17 years old
[1:02:25] i was a young man hungry and twisted
[1:02:27] after righteousness
[1:02:29] and it was an incredible twist a
[1:02:32] twisting for god and it so happened that
[1:02:35] um all the family of course my older
[1:02:38] brothers and sisters
[1:02:39] went to
[1:02:40] college and then went further education
[1:02:43] and i choose a little different part i
[1:02:45] um
[1:02:46] after getting my subjects i i really
[1:02:48] wanted to be a medical doctor because i
[1:02:50] always felt i wanted to help humanity
[1:02:52] not even knowing that go to
[1:02:54] bring me into the ministry to minister
[1:02:56] to people
[1:02:57] and um of course we didn't have the
[1:02:59] money to pursue um medical stuff
[1:03:03] so what i did i switched to
[1:03:06] what you call um electrical engineering
[1:03:08] technician to do electrical engineering
[1:03:10] thing like that so i went john the
[1:03:11] imported space i was to leave san
[1:03:12] fernando and go to porter spin
[1:03:15] and um it was god's plan
[1:03:17] to get me away from
[1:03:19] family
[1:03:20] so when i went up to porter spain i
[1:03:22] saved my message some maureen i know
[1:03:24] she's deceased now she got baptized and
[1:03:26] stood a lot
[1:03:27] and i went and stayed there i used to
[1:03:29] walk
[1:03:30] from deer to school and i was at maybe
[1:03:32] about a hour and a half
[1:03:34] i'm passing through with foot square
[1:03:36] with a famous square that square where
[1:03:38] everybody preaching everybody saying
[1:03:39] something
[1:03:40] i met a brother named brother phipps
[1:03:42] michael phipps and he was preaching and
[1:03:44] preaching they come and listen to him so
[1:03:46] when i went home or coming back and
[1:03:48] seeing
[1:03:49] and i i had one question
[1:03:51] because i read about
[1:03:54] i read about somebody who said in a life
[1:03:57] past they they um it was in some village
[1:03:59] in india
[1:04:01] and under the under the dead have a goal
[1:04:03] only that boys have gold and when they
[1:04:05] went and checked this place and the
[1:04:06] family never went there before and they
[1:04:08] went to dig they got gold there and so
[1:04:09] on like that tonight that used doesn't
[1:04:11] bother me that maybe there's a life
[1:04:12] beyond this and kind of reincarnation
[1:04:14] stuff
[1:04:15] so i asked him one question about that
[1:04:18] and he just say
[1:04:19] familiar spirits
[1:04:21] and when he said that
[1:04:23] that was the key i understood it right
[1:04:25] away it's not the person coming back
[1:04:27] when the person was there before it's
[1:04:28] familiar spirits of the person and
[1:04:30] that's in the bible but family spirit so
[1:04:32] after that they got baptized and begin
[1:04:34] to serve the lord
[1:04:35] and um
[1:04:37] you know
[1:04:38] it was really something else i had my
[1:04:40] first experience with god
[1:04:42] um in my sister's home i closed it don't
[1:04:44] begin to pray and seek the lord and
[1:04:46] that pillar light flash that that that
[1:04:49] was my first encounter with god when i
[1:04:52] got an encounter with god like a
[1:04:54] presence was it come to my heart and
[1:04:56] life
[1:04:57] and it brought
[1:04:59] discipline
[1:05:00] and i couldn't see a word about it
[1:05:03] i knew i had a gift and i couldn't say a
[1:05:05] word about it and it was like that you
[1:05:08] know and and and god sometimes i might
[1:05:10] fill in the gaps
[1:05:12] for you and and share some more
[1:05:14] and and lord began to lead me then and
[1:05:17] brother coleman came and trained at 1974
[1:05:20] and 75. i wasn't different from before
[1:05:22] but i was then meeting for 75. i heard
[1:05:25] him preach promises preach from the
[1:05:26] prophet's message and prophesy and
[1:05:29] and the church i was in i asked them
[1:05:30] would you really preach what that man
[1:05:32] created for him that man
[1:05:34] brother said i have to check but i
[1:05:35] believe paul i said but
[1:05:37] what he was saying what the brother
[1:05:38] brahman says would you preach what you
[1:05:40] want to preach what he was preaching for
[1:05:41] the bride he said no
[1:05:43] and i left
[1:05:45] seventeen year old with a bag over my
[1:05:47] shoulder student
[1:05:49] and i walked out of a church because i
[1:05:51] wanted
[1:05:52] what that man was preaching i was
[1:05:54] hearing promises for the bride seventh
[1:05:56] understand the bride sometimes they
[1:05:58] bright revival i was hearing things for
[1:06:00] the bride and i believe i am part of
[1:06:02] that bride so i don't want people to
[1:06:04] find me i want to hear brighter promises
[1:06:07] so i went from church to church you know
[1:06:09] and looking to see who is the preaching
[1:06:11] closest to these brother promises
[1:06:13] eventually
[1:06:14] you know i got settled in and then
[1:06:16] afterwards
[1:06:17] the whole ministry of that pastor fall
[1:06:19] apart
[1:06:20] and eventually
[1:06:22] i got to kaiwea
[1:06:23] and um
[1:06:25] michael mcmahon
[1:06:26] he was instrumental in that he was
[1:06:28] starting a group in a country there it
[1:06:30] was gaslamp
[1:06:31] it was
[1:06:33] tauting water from the well
[1:06:35] it was rugged
[1:06:37] and so on i remember by the george
[1:06:39] kangli
[1:06:40] a day
[1:06:41] coming from belmont to taiwa
[1:06:44] and i came and three people was
[1:06:46] upstairs
[1:06:48] in the house
[1:06:50] but george tell me um
[1:06:52] why are you wasting your time coming
[1:06:53] from so far to preach to three people
[1:06:56] and my answer to him was when you repent
[1:06:58] god will forgive you
[1:06:59] well he repented afterwards
[1:07:01] but it wasn't about the three people
[1:07:04] it was about the training and um
[1:07:07] that was a wilderness experience
[1:07:09] that was a dry experience a hard
[1:07:12] experience but it was you can't get fame
[1:07:14] up there you can't get popularity you
[1:07:16] can't get it wasn't anything like that
[1:07:18] at all it was just loving the lord i
[1:07:20] remember
[1:07:21] a service and just recently i spoke
[1:07:23] about the jericho he's in canada
[1:07:25] he came up he came up to preach up there
[1:07:28] and
[1:07:29] and when he was there
[1:07:31] after his service he was amazed a few
[1:07:33] people and everything else and the
[1:07:34] anointing that was jerome and he says
[1:07:36] god gonna bless you
[1:07:38] and he used these words because he who
[1:07:40] is faithful and little shall be faithful
[1:07:42] and much i was reminding him of that and
[1:07:43] i never forgot that
[1:07:45] and that is why you hear me talk about
[1:07:47] being faithful
[1:07:48] faithful
[1:07:49] to little
[1:07:50] and if god bless you
[1:07:52] and you take what god bless you and
[1:07:54] thank him for it and bless him for it he
[1:07:56] could he could actually take care of him
[1:07:59] and we use our prayer meetings all night
[1:08:01] prime meetings and so on one night
[1:08:03] i remember
[1:08:05] i saw a vision first vision like a she
[1:08:08] dropped down
[1:08:09] and i saw the second coming of the lord
[1:08:12] and that was like a vision and i wanted
[1:08:13] to know where i find that
[1:08:15] and i got the book called the second
[1:08:18] coming of the lord preached my brother
[1:08:19] branham and i began to read that book
[1:08:21] when i came to the spot
[1:08:23] where it says when the church finds his
[1:08:25] bloody love
[1:08:26] when the church finds his whole religion
[1:08:27] see when the truth finds peace in christ
[1:08:29] it will cause the other members of the
[1:08:30] body come rejoice with us and when i
[1:08:33] hit there and struck there like an
[1:08:35] anointing came and i said church this
[1:08:37] has to be revealed got a long story
[1:08:39] short in 1981
[1:08:42] a revolutionary kindness truck called a
[1:08:44] group particular group up there and the
[1:08:46] spirit poured out and i never saw that
[1:08:48] before
[1:08:49] i come from catholics so we don't know
[1:08:51] about not pointing a spirit catholic sit
[1:08:52] down on the priests you know you know
[1:08:54] stuff but the spirit poured out and was
[1:08:56] like a shocking thing it's just like a
[1:08:59] gusher
[1:09:01] yes about about 12 people one and then
[1:09:03] we begin to testify and go different
[1:09:06] places and testify about it and when we
[1:09:08] speak the holy spirit will pour up now i
[1:09:11] at that time never really connected
[1:09:13] broadly kindness for the holy spirit
[1:09:15] at that time it was just like many
[1:09:17] churches is brought in love who doesn't
[1:09:19] see and i'm seeing god confirm the word
[1:09:21] by sending on the spirit
[1:09:23] and eventually i traveled to new york
[1:09:26] and then brother mark introduced me to
[1:09:28] barack obama and i said his brother i
[1:09:30] have a testimony of our nation very
[1:09:31] kindness and then
[1:09:33] he said that you know he never heard
[1:09:34] anybody talk about bernie kennedy since
[1:09:36] then even before when he got revelation
[1:09:38] about terrorists and this was seven
[1:09:40] years later
[1:09:41] so then we talk
[1:09:42] and we fellowship and that is how we got
[1:09:44] connected by this revelation of brethren
[1:09:48] about it and like needed to in penn
[1:09:50] harris
[1:09:51] and um what i didn't know later in the
[1:09:53] years
[1:09:54] what brother common told me is that when
[1:09:55] i was walking towards him the holy
[1:09:58] spirit told him join yourself to that
[1:10:00] man so i don't understand that that's
[1:10:02] his testimony and later on in the years
[1:10:04] said holy spirit told him put brother
[1:10:06] over in the convention because i have a
[1:10:08] work for him to do put him and train him
[1:10:10] that's how i end up in you know
[1:10:13] the child with new york and something
[1:10:15] like that went up there by revelation
[1:10:17] with revelation and still blessed by
[1:10:19] revelation up there i saw the good the
[1:10:21] bad and ugly i learned from the good i
[1:10:23] shunned it bad and i didn't mess with
[1:10:24] you
[1:10:25] but that is life
[1:10:27] and uh
[1:10:28] you know and i'm still standing today
[1:10:30] still blessed by the experience
[1:10:33] of things that were shared because
[1:10:35] you see a lot of things are not taught
[1:10:37] a lot of things are caught
[1:10:39] you know we share we talk and you catch
[1:10:42] something not teach teach teach teach
[1:10:44] teach
[1:10:45] so sometimes you just have to be
[1:10:46] ourselves be authentic be original be
[1:10:48] real
[1:10:49] and share our own testament you know
[1:10:52] and over the years i try to
[1:10:54] you know stick close as possible with
[1:10:56] what the prophet says see what the deep
[1:10:58] sea
[1:10:59] and i wanted to be so close that even if
[1:11:01] i am not quoting
[1:11:03] what i'm seeing
[1:11:04] i could find it back in the message
[1:11:07] because i always wanted to be a preacher
[1:11:09] that nobody could challenge
[1:11:11] on the word
[1:11:13] and i have never had a service where
[1:11:14] somebody come and say what do you mean
[1:11:16] when you say so answer because i know
[1:11:18] what you mean i say
[1:11:20] what is to be said and once it is spoken
[1:11:23] you can find it back that's very
[1:11:25] important because you must be able to
[1:11:27] examine
[1:11:28] what is spoken from behind improvement
[1:11:30] so it's not just i'm saying this and you
[1:11:32] believe me and what nothing you know and
[1:11:34] then like you know people like to say um
[1:11:35] problem says how you said um if you get
[1:11:38] the people that believe you're not even
[1:11:39] cancer we sign your way and men take
[1:11:42] that i'm no prophet
[1:11:43] right
[1:11:44] that's how men have all the answers i
[1:11:45] don't
[1:11:46] i will share with you what i
[1:11:48] i know sometimes i tell people that
[1:11:50] above my pay grade let me find help
[1:11:52] somewhere else okay so i don't have all
[1:11:54] the answers and i think two answers are
[1:11:56] back there was a message that was spoken
[1:11:58] through wednesday night and brahman says
[1:12:00] if you find someone who have all the
[1:12:01] answers you know that is something wrong
[1:12:03] with that because god doesn't show his
[1:12:06] servants everything could we give the
[1:12:07] lord a hand to praise god just does not
[1:12:10] show his servants everything so we have
[1:12:12] to work with what god a lot to us
[1:12:15] what god give to us that's what we have
[1:12:17] to work with and i remember
[1:12:19] when we went we were doing enterprise
[1:12:22] and the first time i saw sister ann
[1:12:23] marie
[1:12:25] somebody invited her
[1:12:26] and that is why you should invite people
[1:12:28] to keep on inviting people even
[1:12:30] to the testimony of bible study first
[1:12:32] time i saw anyway it's totally pastor
[1:12:34] there's something about that sister that
[1:12:35] i like
[1:12:36] and um
[1:12:38] i never already talked to her it was
[1:12:40] just something that registers and i want
[1:12:42] you to get this
[1:12:43] it's just something that clicks
[1:12:45] so
[1:12:46] and those days brothers were very
[1:12:48] serious very very sweet
[1:12:51] and i was very serious
[1:12:53] very serious there was no smiles nothing
[1:12:56] like that
[1:12:58] and one day somebody said something and
[1:13:00] i laughed and smiled
[1:13:02] and she reacted and said i never know
[1:13:04] you could smile
[1:13:05] and guess what i've been smiling since
[1:13:11] so
[1:13:12] um
[1:13:12] you know it's quite a great experience
[1:13:14] and you know god bless us with three
[1:13:16] sons and now we have
[1:13:18] um isaac
[1:13:20] gideon and andrew are no you know we
[1:13:22] know we don't have tree anymore we
[1:13:23] multiplied in that time of
[1:13:25] daughter-in-law's grandchildren and so
[1:13:27] on and
[1:13:28] you see the hand of god i
[1:13:32] wish i could talk to more young people
[1:13:34] to tell them
[1:13:35] the joy of serving the lord
[1:13:38] the joy of being tested i remember when
[1:13:41] i was going to john donaldson
[1:13:43] how somebody was blasting me from
[1:13:45] barbarian
[1:13:46] and when i go to testify about brother
[1:13:48] branham i started stutter at the
[1:13:50] woodstock county mother we break the man
[1:13:52] say look look look at him he he falls he
[1:13:54] kind of can't come with his mouth
[1:13:58] like a talk
[1:13:59] and everybody are wrong a whole crowd
[1:14:01] around
[1:14:02] it would have been embarrassing but i
[1:14:04] was prepared
[1:14:06] to have the reproach of the world
[1:14:08] in those days
[1:14:10] you understood what it had was to be
[1:14:13] report of the world because like
[1:14:14] everybody's profit no profit is
[1:14:15] profiting
[1:14:16] in those days once you say profit
[1:14:18] somebody say false prophecy last days
[1:14:20] they have a rise false prophet no
[1:14:22] different ones are prophets and so on
[1:14:23] but in those days you couldn't talk
[1:14:25] prophet talking much but it was
[1:14:27] real
[1:14:28] and um i want to encourage you tonight
[1:14:31] ask god to create a new
[1:14:34] hungering and twisting
[1:14:36] it is something that gives you strength
[1:14:37] it's something that keeps you alive
[1:14:40] i remember only lord who come to me um
[1:14:43] about money woman and popularity treat
[1:14:45] things that is
[1:14:47] wipe out a man and i ask god to protect
[1:14:49] me from these things and when i was
[1:14:51] scared of its popularity i was very
[1:14:53] concerned about it and the lord show me
[1:14:55] how to manage that and you know along
[1:14:56] the way what teach you like i shared
[1:14:58] that already on my job people don't
[1:15:01] respect you for what you get into people
[1:15:03] respect you for what you stand for it
[1:15:05] was an experience i went through to
[1:15:07] learn that because you want to give in
[1:15:09] to people you want to be nice you want
[1:15:11] to be fine you want to represent but
[1:15:14] then
[1:15:14] god doesn't want you to be a discharge
[1:15:17] god doesn't want people to walk over you
[1:15:18] so you have to put down your foot
[1:15:19] sometimes and say no
[1:15:21] that's not i'm not going to do that i'm
[1:15:22] not gonna operate this way and when you
[1:15:24] do that yeah people might pull back but
[1:15:27] at the end of the day you're gonna
[1:15:28] respect what you stand for and that is
[1:15:31] very very important you know like one
[1:15:34] experience a man a boss i had and he was
[1:15:36] kind of smart man my lord show me he
[1:15:39] said when you're looking at a snake
[1:15:41] don't rush it
[1:15:43] watch how that snake is moving
[1:15:45] and then you time it and then you take
[1:15:47] it and cut his head off
[1:15:50] you wouldn't find it in a book but that
[1:15:52] is the experience that i got because the
[1:15:54] man was very crafty he's a boss he's up
[1:15:56] dear but he's very slippery and
[1:15:59] eventually he got nailed you see and
[1:16:01] that never what happened in that whole
[1:16:02] experience never happened before but it
[1:16:04] did just like he said elisha people said
[1:16:05] that um you never you're not going to
[1:16:08] get back at work you're not going to get
[1:16:09] back your job and i had experiences
[1:16:11] where i recognized was bad attitude and
[1:16:13] i had to repent to god and say lord this
[1:16:16] is not it
[1:16:17] and when i repent adjust my attitude
[1:16:20] everything fall in line
[1:16:21] i remember last thing i'll say
[1:16:23] i didn't mean to say no this tonight but
[1:16:25] it was it was really nice being here and
[1:16:27] being able to share
[1:16:28] um
[1:16:29] it when i came to the lord i was going
[1:16:32] in the wrong direction
[1:16:33] with my family i was telling my question
[1:16:35] a prophet and this and that and one day
[1:16:39] my sister said you are so hard
[1:16:41] nobody could talk to you
[1:16:43] and then i said
[1:16:45] i'm so sorry
