turn our hearts back to the feet of the fastest father me annoying the feed that's already in the people annoyed the word in them quicken them to your word today fast may the word become flesh of mullahs that is invisible to become visible granted Lord in GSM we ask it in an email what eternal greet somebody geez [Music] [Music] hallelujah god bless you I bring you greetings from Paris when Allah Martian Paris and Mosul but a shadow they send a love is in the greetings cradle here this morning but their Bibles are acted to intestine jaunt up to 20 we want to reform was 21 and 22 wanna go Luke chapter 24 from 44 to the tree and revelation 5 8 to 14 so you want to read John chapter 20 21 to 22 and when he had so said he he showed unto him his kindness and his side and then will recycles glad when this sword and Lord got 21 and then said Jesus unto them again peace be unto you as my father had sent me so send I you and when he had said this he breathed on them and said unto them receiving the Holy Ghost they want to refer to Luke chapter 24 from verse 44 and he said unto them these are the words which I speak unto you while I was yet with you that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the law of Moses and in the and in the son and the prophets and in the Psalms considered me then open he the understanding that they might understand the scriptures and he said unto them thus it is written and does it behoove Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations beginning at Jerusalem and here witnesses of these things and behold I send the promise of my father upon you but tiring the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high and he led them out as far as the Bethany and he lifted up his hands and blessed them and it came to pass while he blessed them he was parted from them and carried up and heaven and they worshiped him I returned to Jerusalem with great joy and they were continually in the temple praising and blessing and go on revelation chapter 5 when I read from verse 8 and when he had taken the book the four beasts and the fawn twenty elders fell down before the lamb and when every one of them harps and golden vials full of all those which are the prayers of the saints and the summer new song saying thou art willing to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain has redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation and has made us unto our God kings and priests we shall reign on the earth and I be and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand and thousands of told us a lovely loud voice worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing on every creature which is in heaven and on the earth under the earth and such as in the seal all that are in them who did I see in blessing and honor and glory and power be unto him that sitteth upon the throne and unto the lamb for ever and ever and the four beasts said amen and the four and twenty elders fell down and worship Him that liveth for ever and ever let us pray one more time father we thank you for your word we pray a common interpreter to our hearts and may your pour out your spirit and confirm it with which signs wonders and miracles we pray bless those here bless those connected us on the internet may your spirit flow freely and speak every heart we pray in Jesus name we ask it amen and amen you may be seated or pray is gone or blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah oh it's a good thing to be in the house of God it's always a privilege to be in the house of yarn I'll give you health and strength and your heart you are here you want to get the benefit of being here in the service of the Lord amen how many appreciate the service last Sunday not by might nor by power but by my spirit what bless you but Isaac that was some message that was some sermon I tell you my God my mind was totally blown oh my and I so enjoyed it only bought the ticket across there in France so we are not creating a new standard this turn that already exists oh praise God a standard of holiness under the righteousness standard of purity a standard of forgiveness after those seven live invoices the standard of always was and always will be this time that is Jesus Christ Oh hallelujah had it only or low could put this thing together like that oh my the people have been taught that church under standard but brother Branham left the stand the wind but her mom left the earth he didn't it didn't sound I didn't leave it's not right the standard was in the hand of the spirit and the Spirit revealed to whomsoever he will so nobody had a license under what the Spirit can reveal isn't that wonderful so the Spirit could reveal the thunders of whomsoever he will isn't that right blessed be the name of the law so this time that was always here isn't that right in the hand of the Spirit and the Holy Ghost is the standard bearer that was time with any man who stands with the word I love that the Holy Spirit is a standard there was found with any man who stays with the word and this is the balm for me the spirit has no loyalty to man he only has loyalty to though his word oh praise God do you see it now the spirit have no loyalty to any man so why run after our man brings God's care with the world oh praise God hallelujah fight for the word and by the word the word is God hallelujah praise God amen it is so beautifully phrased full obedience to the entire word and Titus you to be accompanied by the standard error Oh glory to God hallelujah love that once a full obedience to the would entitle you to the Holy Ghost and title to the token follow leaders of the entire world and title you should be accompanied by the standard error if the spirit that follows the word or you are free this morning to be what God made you to be isn't that right oh is the spirit that follows the words I so enjoy that message I was tremendously blessed praise God is a message I would want to get on print or put it out that you could read it something that you really consider praise God that God will follow his word you see when I go down deeper you realize he's no respecter of persons either keffiyeh sponsor son pastor daughter elder son or the daughter Deacon Sundin daughter Deacon elder doesn't matter who you think you are what you are sports time that is his word and we have to come up to his word doesn't matter what position somebody hold and that's all they were embarrassed Court is adopting the position ended up in the man so you do get the engineer doctor that is irrelevant what are you as a person praise God what are you as a person not a position I could single that have nothing do with what we're talking about what is up on your voice yet up in you praise God hallelujah praise God when I come to see the dome a service that exactly what we're talking about was it up in you he was you Bri is gonna be call him embarrassed not have a pastor in other father he won that connection between you and him please God kill it supposedly conduit the rescue man and reference a man and bring back men back to God not a system not a turkey but back to God or when you leave here and you make your prayer buttered answer your prayer if it has a deep inside of you there the clients either you have I'm Sinkin who is talking a son is talking once more Lord let me die with the Philistines who is talking my son is talking restore to me the joy of my salvation who is pocket punish talking do I dare a man in the house Oh hallelujah praise God for either God so what is it interested in your pity party got interested in coming to maturity bullets and fire under your seat if you have to because you want to have a perfect Church and even a perfect man not a perfect boy boy came here with nothing the chapel's there's nothing in the maturity you got to come to accept responsibility I will arrive I was here to my father I have sinned I am failed and I coming back oh but somebody say Amen somebody oh this is the world is the moveable not by might not by power but by my spirit and God Almighty Oh hallelujah praise God praise God hallelujah every Kingdom is chicken every Kingdom is shaken Europe shaken America shaken everything is rocking you know the world has actually fallen apart so where you wonder will fall when everything is mashed up all around you all glory to God when we have a word that cannot be moved heaven earth will pass away but this word will never pass away [Applause] [Music] America don't even know what they have my Jesus thank God God's kingdom is not by election my man's election and man vote crowd thank God you have the people's vote to vote you into this position and vote you into that position in the kingdom of God what God have an election but it is election it is tolki it is chosen and they've got chose to deliver you this morning there's not enough Devils last night last year is not enough time to stop you from your delivers a night I believe this morning that somebody wanna be set free praise God nothing gonna stop it this church is that different chose this is the sovereign church we do what we want to do how we want to do it we have no bishop we have nobody to tell us what they do and hope to do it we filled every Bible this morning you're gonna revival this morning we filled our old fashioned sin killing human cases you name it we could have it this morning praise God because we could speak it and see it come to pass so give the Lord a shout in the house [Applause] [Music] let me see fit breathe Galia man Satur fine time in Paris praise the name of the Lord please go will fight in love see that judges are treating to do cause the people over fight and then invite inheritance we have seen the Lord that was a good testimony of the recyclers Christ's resurrection ministries have seen the launches but a bomb left we have seen the Lord see revelation inspirations or we have seen the Lord but that was not seen the Lord is to point us to dynamics in the Upper Room it wasn't Jesus staying with them walking where they have no he raised from the dead he come in our mission to open the understanding and open the word that is all because once your understanding is open and the word is awkward when your wood is open to you you know what you have to present you know I have to go there is no other way to go only one place the place of that position of the upper room and in that upper room they were praising and blessing God knowing again once in a while when you feel like that's not what the Bible says they were praising God continually and you have to learn to do that I miss you're trying circumstance I miss you have headache back pain whatever it is I mean disasters you have to still worship because it's a promise praise God hallelujah hallelujah promise to you amen stop a title this morning living under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit that's my title this morning living under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit you don't want to live in the demon powers you don't want to live under the world you don't want to live under a woman's hands leave you feeling any emotions you don't want to live under that you want to be living under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit another inspiration these are the words that the first thing Jesus told them these are the words he didn't give them more words and new words he getting the same words how little that he had before Halloween bring it back and make it more positive or get a lot of salt in the house oh praise God praise God praise God hallelujah praise be to Jesus oh my I want to tell you though me discouraged this morning the Holy Spirit is with you looking over you isn't that right thank you Jesus all right let's go but the Branham says I want to tie into what I got preached but Isaac reached but Satan mixed up healing his shows and so on its appearance is appealing but the enemy keeps finding a better bait just hit another kid and proven his tactics but but he had a stripper a little more don't worry and so forth right okay but what God doesn't have to do anymore to his God does not the Magus was more prettier he I just wanted make it dim with tinsel and so on no no what happen here he doesn't have to make do anything more to his to make it more appealing the only thing he has to do is the reason of standard of his own words against the enemy and the Bible said when the enemy come like a flood the Spirit of God or a boy raises the standard what does he do he makes the word that you already said more positive [Applause] so that's why Jesus come on tell them these are the words cause a little positive to you because I wonder how give you absolutely a guarantee that this promise of the Father it is guaranteed behold I send the promise of my father upon you it is guaranteed some was a river planet in your spirit in your life then we breathe upon him we see be the Holy Ghost the breath of God was upon them they were living under the Norrington anointing of Provence I'm not you know dynamics I'm going to receive Oh blessed be the name of the Lord praise God praise this wonderful name hallelujah you believe that so what Quran says he takes the word that he already said and make it more positive hallelujah not-not-not new words not new mysteries same ones he was telling them all alone you come to make it more real to him the virus in their lives days people are itching ears that he has new stuff the tickle in theory is that you have a live nothing I know just outta here selected here right and here and here the motor here and what if you good about whether you see but this is not that Jesus was talking to them there wasn't catching a lot of stuff he was telling them because it is enough revolution if you revelation gives you a certain behavior I don't care what country you're from what language you speak revelation comes from God not on what you read and study that's your study but well as revealed or spring stimulation it brings excitement it brings real expectation isn't that right so butter Branham says you know the Bible says when the enemy come on like a flood the Spirit of God would raise up a standard and when God here we go when God gives his church a blessing and they move along with that blessing soon until it become common to the world then they begin to run it down then the Spirit of God comes in and raise up a standard again and there's a brick and for a revival or something the message going slow slow coach look who's everybody's together right and the righteous and into everything and brother but I'm safe I'm gonna bow safe but it will revival be comfortable in the comfort zone and so on but afterwards what want to read the standards a revival breaks out isn't that right and we have a promise you say what we see happen should put every soul in action it should make a church that would make a revival that people be finding from Europe to see what's taking place not here to see they will sit as a place in Arizona called Maricopa Valley a city called Phoenix there is something broke out there that the seven thunders of Revelation 10 does not even road is being manifested in other words that gutta comma our where we could say this is that that the Prophet Balaam random speaker praise God not the bunch of churches all around no not that note this prophecy here these are the words Oh hallelujah these are the words you have to connect with these other words Oh hallelujah praise God praise God so he continued all the angels and gathered illusions and we are here he was about to write those tendencies I don't like them seal them up and at the day of selling of these last seven angels to chage what the mystery of God all about God how God is but one God all these things will be finished at that time the great battles back before had got these loose ends hanging out it ought to be wrapped up together in this age so before the thunders could occur all the loose ends has to be tied up before you could get your portion the loose ends in your life have to be tied up isn't that right so brother sister we are the end times left the Holy Spirit influence us to the Word of God let God do the influencing in our hearts and not be influenced by others but as I said a powerful thing that people could get desensitized to the Holy Spirit for the Holy Spirit what we conviction would spread or bring you wrong you should change the attitudinal ways and I told him in Paris but a brand say I rather somebody wrong and their doctrine I right in the spirit that's somebody right in the doctrine unrolling their spirit when somebody right in their spirit they could be corrected when somebody wrong in their spirit thank you terrible you can tell them my power because they're right in the doctor they may be right go this way this or this but they're roaming your spirit oh how that's a religious spirit that's a demon actually Oh hallelujah praise the name of the Lord so watch let the Holy Spirit influence us to the Word of God and let God do the influence in your hearts and not be influenced by others this ought to put us in action with reverence and humility the tiller fire vindicated among us again in the last days he will pour out his spirit do you believe that do you believe this is your promise I really believe this is your promise so you are promised the spirit upon your life Oh glory to God amen but if I know he's brain Lord consume it right now this is on the indictment while I'm before your throne take every one of these people Lord take the world out of us take me Lord while we are here in your presence just take the world wring your hearts God right now pull the world and the case of the low-low away from us let us be consecrated Christians Oh God to be loving and kind and sweet bearing the fruit of the Spirit won't you Lord we are before your throne sinners left a crimson stain on every one of us but your blood can remitted Lord make it right as though granted while we are waiting upon you take us we are yours consecrated our lives to you in Jesus name granted Lord the each one of us wring my heart out lon I see all my errands you are not here to see somebody else errands you want here to see what problems you have everybody inside of here if you fix up you'll have to come here you're the only sick people come in here people have needs coming here people looking for deliverance they come here people looking to break you and help they come here hallelujah people don't know what to do they come here to praise God you're not coming here because you're right they're coming here because you're wrong I need a preacher you're not coming every committee is nice if anything not nice and you looking aquatic intervene look at my supernatural back through then you're in the right place Oh hallelujah you have come here to find fault no no no you're coming to deliver on Oh blessed be the name of the Lord you don't come in here to see who where what that's none of your business mind your own business the cognitive fight for your portion to fight for your soul or glory to God hallelujah thank you Jesus please God by the band and ring my heart Lord I see on my errands I see my mistakes God from this time I'm trying to live the best that I can oh I want to go I want to consecrate my life on you to you across here this morning after bringing this indictment against Mike Liam and friends over there I have to say these hard things Lord I did it by your inspiration I feel you told me to do it no it's off my shoulders I'm glad it all let them do with it whatever they will father I pray they will accept it I pray with save everyone more major comfort a revival of the just prophecy prophecy and prayer miracle for a revival of the just and a great power come among the churches just before it is going it is not too hard to pray that because you promised death and we are looking Lord for that pearl that we knew will do great things enormous forget the Lord I hope it's not too hard to pray because he promised him and if he promised the clock headlight or get the Lord a shout [Applause] hallelujah do you love that coat neither come by the revival of the jump who is this just a justified good 'nearly you are justified I've been never that sin so we want to say a silly little forget them I'm talking foolishness who got justify who who could condemn who caught this writer is right [Applause] Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah that means for you to be justified you have to get a revelation that your name is on the book that means you have to get a revelation of Elohim is whatever the moon whatever the stop whatever the molecule whatever the beginning before the beginning you were there or give the Lord a shout Oh hallelujah praise God praise God praise God let there be the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory glory glory this morning for the CBS 10 minutes this morning scripture and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanseth emotion and there's a quote woman in the wings of over slow a dog did you know a real Christian doesn't know anything and puter to him David said blessed is the man whom God will not impute sin to when you are washed in the blood of the Lamb not by McAleese but really the blood of the Lamb God does not impute to you anything that is done because you are under the blood and he doesn't see it there is a blood sacrifice the only thing you can see you in is the way he showed you before the foundation of the world when we put your name in the Lamb's Book of Life that is all he can look at because you are redeemed from everything that was ever done you are washed in the blood of the Lamb therefore there is no gall in you there is no unclean habit in you because that the blood of the Lamb have did this and God cannot impute sin to you after you got sin offering land waiting for you Oh hallelujah when you say brother Branham I can what I want too I always do always but when a man can't really see what Jesus under him and turn around and do something contrary to him it shows he never received Christ or give the Lord a shout do you love in this morning o blessed talk about a Stephen hallelujah praise the Living God hallelujah praise God praise Jesus so that is why for the Branham sense what was this John was beaten because Norman was found worthy to take the book done in tears he wasn't happy he was among hallelujah glory glory I know the book and I was in that book hallelujah his name is in that book yo your name is the word hallelujah is you a part of that book so we want that book to be released so that we can go back on it brings got it caught up in that dimension but it's not come back on the earth until that book is unfolded so John is correctly weeping he is crying a man filled with the Holy Ghost he is weeping because no man was from what is a text book but notice discovery read when the lamb put the book oh don't behavior change all in heaven volunteer so therefore your worship will express to me expect us whether you have any revelation so when you see somebody quiet the cow worship they look in the look in the look and they know something is wrong because once you get a revelation that your name is on the book you have to behave the same way drum behave because there is only one lon there's only one spirit there's only one baptism and there was only one behavior when you're living under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit there is only one behavior just like Mary any of the rumors just like people any of Peru [Applause] this is a very important service this was separately from Jacques because he'd get in Revelation to warn me up a room and if you can't worship you have no revelation because God is our coming oh and dry what's the commitment of your head unzip your memory enough intellect what is permanent hacks praise God that's right media Peru it's gotta understand the Lord is good and he is gonna be worship everything worship the elders worship these your pleasure the Bobby's worship or under any other room and they were praising or continually before the dynamic cells there is one of your own porn of the Spirit but before I come you have to break into Revelation fine I [Applause] good reason but over you don't know I feel in heavy what happened with wish if I'm gonna do with your weak about Michael whatever you worship what I'll do with God not you I'm troubled I won't do it worship hallelujah cop in the business I'm doing worship I've nothing to eat between survivorship whatever I'm

right praise be to Jesus now here's where I got to want to get to but this is where the infusion from our Daniel hundred and seven thunders and forbidden and John with the voices and this book was sealed and the back of book was see with seven seals but in the days of these seals to be open the mystery of God would be finished in other words God would be known to his church not in three people but as one person the mystery of God would reveal and when that was completely revealed then the seven mysteries which is the sometimes talked about will be open to the church because in there the church would be living under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit him moving in and out showing him signs of being alive Amala that's a promise to be living under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit and Christ moving in and out he could do a miracle today I feeling today I deliverance today he moved in he move out he restore back side as a day somebody got taught in the ruins today we move in he's

Daniel seven thunders the voices he covered spent the right is it don't write it don't write it John for the same thing it has already been written outside of the Bible had seven seas on the back of the book no man can open those seals that wants them voices so the seals on the back of the book was voices so you couldn't see the voices but the voices were what revealed was inside the book what higher voices rather there so we're on pick seven seas on the back and put it under the seven seed on the inside and make sure they're seven seals not fourteen heels if we didn't do that but before teams use serve on the backside money inside but the voices on the back he call it voices the books were seized with voices seven voices could go no further no man know what it was but the Bible said and told Daniel and John that in the last days these seven voices would be known by the real true church so if that is so then the real true church must have king lamb worship if it's revealed to you

for you probably enjoy watching Ellen boss I'm going back as you know what I here for because that book is so important cross the book that Adam had tagged about that animal loss that's the book what the names are called own sons what would only call by his word so the world was in the book the booze and ham when I'm lost the book the book went back in the hands of regional order and Jesus Christ came back down at the book version and the Papas dear open another book earth is being placed in sons the coil represents sons calling Santa [Applause] so he said as my father and me so that not you the father that was sent him within him oh give the Lord a shout do you see what what about to do to you even what the tabernacle in side by side of you you are born to become a hope for God you become about to come a terrible God you become the Church of God you yourself repeated Christianity versus idolatry but a burnable but idolatry is a strange thing don't do the ages we have had it ever since the beginning of time now the order for this idol worship is the man sets of the idol fixes an idol then he goes in and prepares himself for this great worship now he believes this Idol is made in the image of some God that he doesn't never see he's without form so he believes he's in an image of this idol that he makes it as God now don't let that leave you supportive Ananya is bringing a point he said now the image is in the image image of the mythical God if he believes that is then he goes for the idol must reach himself and believes that the god that's unseen placement comes down into this idol and he believes that he talks to God to decide on that God brings himself into the idol and answers him back now many of you teachers here that took the mythology even those gods their battles were honor reclaim now in other words the God hypnotized themselves from this supernatural standing in the his idol speaks back to the worshiper through the idol and the worshiper in some kind of built up emotional sense disease that the idol speaks to him to his heart and he's forgiven of his sins whatever more which surely shows is the devil is the devil that does it listeners know they'd all just haphazardly do things these worshipers of idols some of them does but there's real true worship most of those things for instance I could tell you stories of how those Devils in those idols perform all kind of things make blood come out of things and everything else they were City stone weeping virgin mary weeping on his demons devils that you worship in making these things happen watch they are Devils were on Samia now if you don't believe there's a real devil then you don't believe there's a god sure you got to believe the contrary there's a real devil and he's a person not a thought not at all he is a person but if the teaching goes on that the devil just are ever taught to get no it isn't the devil is a person the same people believes that the Holy Ghost is gonna could torture get but to believe that the Holy Ghost is a prison it is the person of Christ and spirit for all that we will say in the Holy Ghost they off that is just that is just contrary teaching the Holy Ghost is the person of Christ in spirit form now let's go ahead and food enough now these idolaters must straighten themselves for the idol believe that the God they are worshiping is represented in this Idol no you have no you got that the worshiper is not a hypocrite sisty he is actually getting a hold of something that is in that title because it come back on him he does something and gets it from that idols which is a mixed God not a real one so they will have testimonies of what that either does to them and what they worship and does to them or what the church does for them they have answers they have witness they have confirmations they have all of that what is devil and many parents have you are you ready that never get into those things and the devil get intermittent sometimes and impersonates themselves as God I have seen this in my ministry now this is very deep this is let's skim milk you said stay where the teaching has been taught here here with this word don't you leave it you stay right with the word no matter what comes what goes stay with the world people say come to the altar with lying teachers lying teachers say just open forget everything make a mind blank you become an Elijah you become this idea what a lie that's open up your soul to all kind the devil spirit stick it in don't do that you must remember there is a devil onion person it Christ to the letter almost so just because we can be emotional don't me we received because we go to church domain we are saved aha that's a big one that's a big one when the church doesn't mean people said I see people in this message Christians supposed to call Christians be so badly it's really disappointment really disappointed you want to make these people I saved some of them do you even know they were sinners learn it jump in mobile help some satellite goes it bring them them until the fall they in the pile in the arrogance while it's self-righteousness okay let's go on now because we go to church Tommy we are saved don't believe those intentions spirits a real spirit of God a real Word of God is the truth of God which is the seed of God let's produce God in your life you'll be godly simply holy it's continued among another people we find where emotions and so forth they become Catalans backbiting all kind of ungodly things whether that is toxic acid in the church it is demon powers spirit of men and women who get among one another and try to push off and say this one is not right this is not right that is not right and if you change it down nine times out of ten is the very person making that still that's not right God hates discord among brethren be reverent be holy love God stand by him and as long as you know your life is giving up with the Bible with the purity of heart with your thought love towards your brother trying to your best or bill the kingdom of God doing those things dressing right living right talking right through the right places then you can have all the emotions you want and everybody will believe it and tighten spirits going forth demons under disguises look we in the last days as the end time false spirits come in and begin to tell people this and the other we are broke up into nine hundred different nominations everyone with different view we say they say we believe this period that's what we believe they can't let the Holy Spirit come in they can't have the right of way goal got a bunch of people I can shout then everybody had to shout they got some to speak and tongue then everybody had to speak in tongues they got all like this till they become what absolutely listen contaminated with ten thousand spirits entitles people to do these emotions when there is a no government at all then they go and live any kind of life that is either live and call it Christian oh praise the name of the Lord so I say this because the correctly worship God you have to get rid of the religious spirits and the enticing spirits is that Bush and all a bunch of noise and hallelujah glory with your hands you have to be able to follow through with the word so worship God in spirit and in truth or could we get a lot some praises

to give an update on Felicia's surgery and recovery Felicia had the surgery done and the 25th of me and she went in around 12:30 p.m. and came out by 3:30 p.m. when the doctors cut her they realized that the endometriosis had progressed to stage 4 the final stage it had fused some of her mean organs together her uterus bladder and bowel to name a few and it has covered other organs and is still spreading the vast amount of the endometriosis made it impossible for the doctors to reach the fibroids and sissu sadly the doctors had to close her back up and nothing was done the doctors have confessed that they cannot do anything further for her and that her quality of life would only get worse she was prescribed medication to help with the bleeding from the endometriosis and painkillers since that was the doctor's report however we believe in the Lord's report and as we said healing in the children's bread and valishia is a child of the Most High God Felicia's faith in her healing has skyrocketed and she believes that Almighty God will perform a miracle for her she knows of his wonders and miracles as he had performed a miracle when he popped open her right ear that had 85% hair loss due to nerve damage from a birth defect also opening up her womb so she can have her beautiful daughter Zoe which the doctors confirmed our miracles we know without a shadow of a doubt God
