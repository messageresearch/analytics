[16:23] I was really blessed Sunday I wasn't

[16:27] I was really
[16:29] inspired by it
[16:31] amen praise the name of the Lord
[16:37] Revelation chapter 2 verse 1 under the
[16:39] angel of the Church of Ephesus right
[16:41] these things yet he that hold his Seven
[16:44] Stars in his right hand who walketh in
[16:46] the midst of the seven golden
[16:47] candlesticks I knew I work Sunday labor
[16:50] and thy patience and other not
[16:53] bear them which are evil those Trident
[16:55] which say the apostles and are not and
[16:57] found them liars and as born and as
[17:00] patients and for my namesake as labored
[17:03] and has not fainted
[17:05] nevertheless I have somewhat against
[17:07] thee because I was left I first love
[17:11] remember therefore from Wednesday about
[17:13] falling and repent and do the first work
[17:16] so as I will come unto thee quickly and
[17:18] remove like Candlestick out of his place
[17:21] except our repent
[17:23] and this door has the doll it is the
[17:25] deed of the Nicolaitans which I also
[17:27] hate either that air let him hear what
[17:30] the spirit sees Under the churches to
[17:33] him that overcome it will I give to eat
[17:35] of the Tree of Life which in the midst
[17:38] of the paradise of god let's pray father
[17:40] we thank you for your word may you break
[17:42] the bread of life to us and father may
[17:44] you send us Sarah strong here tonight to
[17:46] drive every soul back to that tree of
[17:48] life where we partake of that tree of
[17:51] life tonight in Jesus and we ask it amen
[17:54] amen before you have a scissors turn
[17:55] around and Shake somebody hand next to
[17:57] you then you could have your seats or
[18:00] praise the name of the Lord
[18:02] praise goes to tonight I have a title
[18:05] he's had air
[18:07] let him hear
[18:09] praise God
[18:12] let him hear of a subject the age of the
[18:15] overcomer
[18:17] another theme the Tree of Life the
[18:20] spirit line
[18:21] I didn't want to put that inspiration
[18:23] just a team this tree of life the spirit
[18:25] line so here we go the title he that has
[18:28] an ear let him hear
[18:29] subject the age of the overcomer and the
[18:32] team is the Tree of Life
[18:35] the spirit line
[18:37] and brother Branham said you have to
[18:39] constantly stay in the spirit of Revival
[18:42] you have to constantly stay in a Revival
[18:44] on your hood but Isaac said Sunday you
[18:46] overcome and keeps life in you
[18:49] if like a tree fall dead and water they
[18:51] come to church and they're just dead and
[18:53] you don't hear any word word word the
[18:56] rotten fasting church that die fast in
[18:58] the church because there's no overcoming
[19:00] you have to start to overcome
[19:02] overcoming keeps life in you brings life
[19:05] into you amen praise God anybody could
[19:08] smoke and drink and fool around but you
[19:10] choose a certain walk this is the way we
[19:13] call it narrow way
[19:16] you choose this and this is what I say
[19:18] as a choice as a young man when a god
[19:20] called me 17. I choose this way I have
[19:23] to get girlfriend and this and that all
[19:25] I was focusing on the Lord and pleasing
[19:27] him amen I've lost this one I lost that
[19:30] one but I was pleasing him because I was
[19:33] called to serve him
[19:34] then the castle of God in the world at
[19:36] the same time they can't be in between
[19:38] you have to make up your mind you have
[19:41] to be clear and clean and that that
[19:43] choice of choosing Christ has brought my
[19:46] life the way it is right now
[19:48] it's a right choice you can't go wrong
[19:50] choosing Christ Oh Glory to God because
[19:53] you're fighting to live and you're
[19:55] living to die
[19:56] Oh Glory to God I said you're fighting
[19:58] to live and you're living to die you
[20:02] still have to meet this living God
[20:04] the one who put you here Oh Glory we see
[20:07] them people walk with them Tall World
[20:09] heels they could almost do like I don't
[20:10] know like what kind of gymnastic is that
[20:12] but they don't see 40 years 50 years
[20:14] from that they have to wear flats
[20:16] Oh Glory to God that's only temporary
[20:18] all these stars is temporary beauty is
[20:21] temporary all praise God all this thing
[20:23] is temporary but here we are get to come
[20:26] to get to receive Eternal things
[20:28] that would last
[20:30] or glory to God you believe that
[20:33] Hallelujah glory to God Amen
[20:37] priests beating Jesus
[20:40] let him hear what the spirit says in the
[20:42] churches they're not overcome it will I
[20:44] give the eat of the tree of life which
[20:46] is the midst of the paradise of God and
[20:48] I love the type and the reference that
[20:49] was brought on Sunday that when you get
[20:51] the subjects as a reward 45 years in
[20:53] school or you're doing exams you have a
[20:55] reward go to rewards with Overcomers and
[20:58] you know the beautiful thing beautiful
[20:59] thing about it every age that Overcomers
[21:01] there wasn't a single age that God would
[21:03] never overcome every single age I've
[21:06] overcome us what about this age what
[21:09] about your age what about your time and
[21:12] we are declaring this is the age of the
[21:14] Overcomer Overcomer it's you the
[21:17] individual
[21:18] and then you have whatever bunch of
[21:20] Overcomers you the individual call to
[21:23] overcome
[21:24] you're the individual culture here it's
[21:27] not the church is you the individual
[21:28] have to have an air to hear that you
[21:31] have to come out your nonsense come with
[21:32] your foolishness Oh Glory to God and
[21:34] receive Christ and walk in the light of
[21:36] the world that you could please God that
[21:39] God proud of you that God want the boast
[21:41] about you glory to God God can turn your
[21:44] whole family against you you're still
[21:45] serve him
[21:46] because Joseph was like that
[21:49] Oh Glory look at his own Brethren
[21:51] rejected him but he was predestinated he
[21:54] was elected he was called he was chosen
[21:57] and I don't care what you go through
[21:58] tonight if God elected you there is
[22:00] enough devils in hell to cancel that
[22:02] election
[22:03] that's why you should be shocking
[22:05] tonight
[22:09] no child no testing could cancel your
[22:12] election and God because who he formed
[22:15] you he called who he called he justified
[22:16] and we Justified he has already
[22:19] glorified
[22:20] amen
[22:23] [Applause]
[22:26] so here's the way you overcome
[22:28] first you have to overcome then you can
[22:30] eat the fruit it's the Overcomer you
[22:33] remember the other night our teaching
[22:34] last night Jonah to get in the spirit
[22:36] before he saw anything
[22:38] how are you going to set scene if he's
[22:40] not a Baptist and go listen to him if he
[22:43] had Presbyterian I'm gonna listen to him
[22:44] if you don't teach just exactly what my
[22:46] church teaches you ain't going to
[22:48] overcome
[22:49] he said because you ain't got in the
[22:51] spirit yet
[22:53] you are all out of order getting this
[22:56] Spirit to the Lord Jesus I love you now
[22:58] reveal to me anything you see fit just
[23:01] bring it to me and then you're getting
[23:04] all right
[23:06] so I can't hear this
[23:07] preacher I can't hear this thing I
[23:11] believe but if you're in the spirit
[23:12] you're just looking for the Lord to
[23:13] speak to you you want a word from the
[23:15] Lord you know God gives that donkey God
[23:17] can use that man then the pulpit
[23:19] praise God I don't care what that man
[23:21] come with tonight because you have a
[23:22] need because you have a daughter of God
[23:24] because you are Son of God God going to
[23:26] anoint that man to speak to your need
[23:30] God going to anoint that man to speak to
[23:32] your condition it will be direct
[23:34] inspiration not some intellectual word
[23:36] word no the spirit line
[23:40] good morning
[23:43] three times in the Bible speaks of the
[23:45] Tree of Life Genesis three times
[23:47] Revelation three times and that's the
[23:49] two books that the devil hates Genesis
[23:52] Revelation two books because Genesis is
[23:55] beginning Revelation tell you his ending
[23:57] he hates those two books then he was
[24:00] saying on my right hand is a tree called
[24:01] the tree of life and the left is the
[24:04] called the tree of knowledge how many
[24:06] knows that the Bible said that there's a
[24:07] tree of life and there's a tree of
[24:09] knowledge and Adam lost his fellowship
[24:11] with God when he took the bite of
[24:14] knowledge but the tree of life was to be
[24:16] handled by faith and faith alone God
[24:19] said so I believe it God said so he's a
[24:21] Healer God said so he's a deliverer God
[24:24] said so he's a way maker I'm not trying
[24:25] to figure out anything I'm trusting The
[24:27] Lord Oh Glory to gods and then you have
[24:30] confidence and all Romans 8 20th and we
[24:33] know that all things work together for
[24:35] good to them that love God to them what
[24:37] he called according to his purpose and
[24:39] you'll trust the Lord and your trust is
[24:41] goodness and your trust is done judgment
[24:44] that he will do right on your behalf
[24:47] [Applause]
[24:55] so when Jesus encountered these scribes
[24:57] and Pharisees and these religious people
[24:59] they say oh far is it man in the
[25:00] wilderness
[25:02] honey send everyone dead
[25:06] oh my father is Mana
[25:12] Mana inbred
[25:15] this is Genesis talking back here now
[25:17] let the Tree of Life in the form of the
[25:19] bread of life speaking to them now I am
[25:21] the living bread
[25:23] if a man eater to me he shall not die
[25:25] oh my the bread of life was from the
[25:28] Tree of Life where they were eaten from
[25:30] the Garden of Eden he was the tree of
[25:32] life now if the tree of life was a
[25:33] person the tree of knowledge is a person
[25:38] it's just two trees
[25:39] is there four trees there's two trees
[25:41] one is a word intellectual line and one
[25:44] of the spirit line
[25:45] and the spirit line is the Tree of Life
[25:48] Oh Glory to God so Jesus said your
[25:51] father's eat man in the wilderness and
[25:53] they are dead but I am the bread of life
[25:54] what bread of life from Eden that a man
[25:57] may eat this bread and shall not die
[26:00] what did the angel said they stopped
[26:02] Adam from that tree they got the tree
[26:04] Lizzy partake and live forever
[26:07] if you eat of that tree of life you'll
[26:09] live forever
[26:10] eternal life so the angel was there to
[26:12] block the tree stopping Adam from taking
[26:14] in the tree because he already broke the
[26:16] Covenant already
[26:17] he broke the word from the Lord already
[26:19] but right now in this hour those same
[26:22] Angels those same set of films they are
[26:24] not guarding the tree they are driving
[26:26] you back to the tree every time you fall
[26:28] down and say get back up you do
[26:30] something wrong repent they keep pushing
[26:32] you oh don't stay there you can live
[26:35] higher than that you're not higher than
[26:37] the animals you are a little lower than
[26:39] the Angels oh come on get there come on
[26:41] I'll get the Lord and Shout
[26:43] [Applause]
[26:52] you are sons of God you are called to a
[26:55] higher level you are called to a higher
[26:58] plane
[27:00] oh man hallelujah praise God praise God
[27:04] praise God
[27:05] so say instead of the Angel oh they're
[27:08] trying to keep him from this tree it is
[27:10] driving them along to the street the
[27:12] angels of the churches to every person
[27:14] bring them back to the name of Jesus
[27:16] Christ who is the tree of life so all
[27:18] God trying to get you back is to the
[27:20] word go trying to get you back to the
[27:22] lies go out and get you back to the tree
[27:24] go attack but get you back to the spirit
[27:26] line because the Bible said knowledge
[27:28] shall increase or Glory because in a way
[27:31] of knowledge and man is being trained to
[27:34] depend upon knowledge and what man
[27:36] knowledge has produced that produce bank
[27:39] card automatic this automatic that
[27:41] computers phones everything else that's
[27:43] the intelligence of man that's not faith
[27:46] in God Amen in God's kingdom you don't
[27:48] even need a cell phone
[27:50] Elijah was hearing what he was talking
[27:53] Oh Glory to God
[27:55] hallelujah hallelujah them talking all
[27:58] their secrets and Elijah in it normal
[27:59] normal
[28:01] and it's enough self that was Wireless
[28:03] long time we had that long time okay the
[28:06] Lord has shouting us
[28:10] automatically
[28:11] [Music]
[28:18] we had automatic stuff long time
[28:21] hallelujah praise God
[28:23] make us a little bit of yacht and big
[28:26] boat or whatnot and Jesus walk on the

[1:01:49] take them among his Brethren said all to
[1:01:51] himself his brothers and then there
[1:01:52] comes as a greeting realize as long as
[1:01:55] they dwelt in the dwelling place and
[1:01:57] kept up that's a good thing to stay in
[1:01:59] the place positionally but they got rid
[1:02:01] of the spirit
[1:02:02] take note of that by the clients
[1:02:05] they know position only where they are
[1:02:07] but the spirit
[1:02:09] the spirit line got dismissed
[1:02:11] so they could know and talk and no one
[1:02:13] talk and talk and know and talk and know
[1:02:15] and no one talk but when the spirit is
[1:02:17] out
[1:02:18] there's just no one talk
[1:02:21] the fundamentals today positionally know
[1:02:23] what they are by intellectual conception
[1:02:26] of the Bible but there is no spirit
[1:02:29] you know why
[1:02:31] they have rejected Joseph
[1:02:34] they turn him out they want nothing to
[1:02:37] do with it it's a bunch of Holy Rollers
[1:02:39] they have ex Community him
[1:02:42] they were out of their Fellowship
[1:02:44] the church feels they don't need the
[1:02:46] Holy Spirit the church they will tell
[1:02:48] you that men can stand up and give you
[1:02:49] such an intellectual talk that could
[1:02:52] almost make you believe it no let's stop
[1:02:54] here a minute didn't Jesus say the two
[1:02:56] clothes so close together the elective
[1:02:58] is possible he said the intellectual
[1:03:00] talks would be so smooth that it would
[1:03:04] deceive the people it is Gospel it is
[1:03:07] man who can handle that word in such a
[1:03:09] way that he could make any intellectual
[1:03:12] person if they are trusting in their
[1:03:15] intellectuals they would condemn the
[1:03:16] Holy Spirit and take the way of man
[1:03:19] Oh Glory to God you see when they
[1:03:22] condemn the holy spirit that the boss

[1:10:15] did you notice Joshua before they
[1:10:17] crossed Jordan he said go to the midst
[1:10:19] of the camp clean your clothes something
[1:10:21] for everyone of you let no man come at
[1:10:22] his wife for within three days you shall
[1:10:24] see the glory of God it's a process of
[1:10:27] getting ready to inherit the promise so
[1:10:30] I want to say promise once is the
[1:10:31] promise of God what is it tell it pull
[1:10:33] like baram says I feel the turtle moving
[1:10:35] now I feel to pray for everybody
[1:10:38] that's a different anointing now oh
[1:10:40] glory to God there's a process in going
[1:10:42] to inherit the promise isn't that right
[1:10:44] and God gave Abraham the promise of the
[1:10:46] land of Palestine to be a possession
[1:10:48] forever sure he's still in the journey
[1:10:50] isn't that right justification
[1:10:52] sanification Wilderness no place of rest
[1:10:55] traveling night and day but then the
[1:10:57] believer comes to Amen to the Holy Ghost
[1:11:00] and that's the promised land Oh Glory to
[1:11:02] God they believe in two Works
[1:11:03] justification signification and put it
[1:11:05] this way justification didn't put Christ
[1:11:07] in suddenly he didn't put him in the
[1:11:08] Holy Ghost himself comes in number three
[1:11:11] puts him inside of you a new heart a new
[1:11:15] spirit then my spirit
[1:11:17] Oh Glory they're gonna say it again a
[1:11:19] new hat a new spirit then my spirit come
[1:11:22] inside of you
[1:11:23] number three puts them inside of there
[1:11:24] but the Believers on Caleb Joshua outfit
[1:11:27] was going into the promised land they
[1:11:28] move over to the land and took the land
[1:11:30] and sat down in the land of their
[1:11:31] possession
[1:11:33] so you want to go from profession to
[1:11:34] possession
[1:11:35] [Music]
[1:11:42] you add a message
[1:11:44] when you see me you see the message
[1:11:47] and a message be become one Oh Glory the
[1:11:50] God hallelujah praise God are you with
[1:11:53] me now
[1:11:54] so watch let's not leave say a button he
[1:11:57] said let's not believe in the Lord Jesus
[1:11:59] being baptized let's not stop because he
[1:12:01] clears my life for sin but now we press
[1:12:03] into a position to a promise for the
[1:12:06] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:12:08] for the promise unto you and to your
[1:12:10] children and them that are far off and
[1:12:13] how Joshua and all those women are
[1:12:16] closing musician can't place and a woman
[1:12:18] hold them the children were born by
[1:12:21] inspiration and how each Man by their
[1:12:23] groanings and travailing they were
[1:12:25] placed positionally by names and so on
[1:12:28] like that he said God how that God has
[1:12:30] set some in the church through their
[1:12:32] labor pains they get tremendous
[1:12:33] sometimes tremendous sometimes so we're
[1:12:35] paying you in we're hurting you what
[1:12:38] pain you talking about sometimes your
[1:12:39] pain is your own pain
[1:12:42] in trouble
[1:12:44] your mouth put you in trouble and you
[1:12:46] get put with your aunt and your uncle
[1:12:47] and your auntie and your neighbor and
[1:12:48] whatnot and this one saying that and you
[1:12:51] you start the fire ninja run and Duncan
[1:12:53] hide
[1:12:54] we're not talking about that you know
[1:12:56] that you
[1:12:57] this is labor pains now you see Jesus
[1:13:00] was led by the Holy Ghost Into the
[1:13:03] Wilderness Jesus Jesus wasn't painful
[1:13:04] since
[1:13:07] God God save me within this because when
[1:13:11] you repeat
[1:13:12] it wasn't that he was led by the Holy
[1:13:15] Ghost to deal with the Devil
[1:13:19] and the devil didn't know who he was
[1:13:20] they were thought was ordinary Joseph's
[1:13:23] son Carpenter Boyner Mary in the same
[1:13:26] house and whatnot I mean and if thou be
[1:13:29] the Son of God contain this bread Stone
[1:13:31] in the bread and Jesus watched his Stone
[1:13:33] and and know the power within him you
[1:13:34] feel the anointing not that he just said
[1:13:37] it back he was tempted
[1:13:41] you know like when you have a good cake
[1:13:43] or bacon somebody said you don't touch
[1:13:44] it
[1:13:46] and all the nose glands activated all he
[1:13:50] smells the right smell just
[1:13:52] I get nothing I said don't even touch
[1:13:54] that
[1:13:57] that like that
[1:13:59] I don't want the sin but it is smelling
[1:14:02] good
[1:14:02] but Jesus was tempted
[1:14:05] and he said it's written so that means
[1:14:07] he put his his desires and his aside to
[1:14:11] to connect with the word That's it man
[1:14:14] shall live by bread alone but but have
[1:14:17] you oh she's hungry
[1:14:21] you know I mean he's hungry
[1:14:26] never say you need bread this one fresh
[1:14:29] fresh
[1:14:31] and he said man shall live by Petaluma
[1:14:33] by every word
[1:14:34] the proceed of saying they ever say aha
[1:14:36] okay and he decided to write down and go
[1:14:39] down to the wood now
[1:14:40] and see what I mean if he shall he shall
[1:14:43] let the angels beat him up if you take a
[1:14:46] jump you want you to come into His Head
[1:14:49] because the jump it means he break a new
[1:14:52] law the word God said thou shall jump
[1:14:54] and I will teach you
[1:14:56] plain Angel to go and jump off Jesus and
[1:14:58] and to do that now he introducing all
[1:15:00] the kingdoms and he said this is mines
[1:15:02] you know you know what I mean another
[1:15:03] man always have a disaster in control to
[1:15:06] be in charge of
[1:15:07] who is who is more important
[1:15:10] you want to be in control he said well
[1:15:12] look at this so she said video screen
[1:15:14] and spread it the curve once all around
[1:15:17] all the world
[1:15:23] kingdoms of this world I mean I in
[1:15:27] charge I had what he did with it but
[1:15:29] by by designation by Adam losing his
[1:15:34] rights I automatically you have to
[1:15:36] assume
[1:15:37] that I am the boss
[1:15:40] and I could kill anybody who I want as
[1:15:42] long as I have this cover in here that I
[1:15:44] under the prince of the power of the air
[1:15:46] that time Jesus seeing Calgary he's in
[1:15:49] the cross my God you see if I only pay
[1:15:52] that price you have no more Authority
[1:15:53] because I got brick to the a barrier and
[1:15:55] come from Heaven to Earth give it to my
[1:15:57] prophet he will give it to my bride and
[1:15:59] she will be like some secret agents in
