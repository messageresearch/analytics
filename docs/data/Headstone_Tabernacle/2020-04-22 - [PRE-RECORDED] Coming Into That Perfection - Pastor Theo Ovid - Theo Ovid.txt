scriptures are Matthew chapter 19 we want to read from verse 16 to 22 and behold one came and said unto him good master what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life and he said unto him why

be where we should be amen and remember as you can make it all to the to the permission don't fail to do so come out to is they right here in a tabernacle so this morning are the title coming into that perfection that's the title come in into that perfection of an inspiration let us go on to perfection and have a team prophecy and process do letter fighting it so much PMP prophecy and process our contact scripture from a Luke 8:14 it reads and that which fell among thorns talk about the see purple a day when they have heard go forth on a choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life and bring no fruit the perfection that's my contact Scripture so this is a certain class because this class Bruin this is not dead we cite people this is people are springing up said hallelujah seen in their read a Bible no one again or read about when apostasy or turn your Bible to open the scriptures these are people that lukewarm sometimes I'll find some them they're not up and down in and out but they're letting shook their Bible like that if I treat specific t'ink ears which is legitimate is that illegal yeah the coyote garbage then I clean the yard and these are supposed to make me dead I'm not going there but kids you have children to care for grandchildren akia for whatever you have tears of legitimate but you see you have to have a passion for God now even though you're taking on the garbage you're taken aback but you're anointed you inspire your heart is hunger in hallelujah you want to worship you want to call upon the name of the Lord please call you're focused and you have a passion for God hallelujah you're not letting the kids take you over it scares riches and pleasures the riches has take people over knock them over flat horizontal clean because when they have riches they do we need God you want that kind of a kind of wonder holes about house you want a helicopter behind the copter doing that plane they want that jet they want anything about to buy it they could buy a paper doctor but anything you want afterwards they wish they could pay for God riches but all these things have a choking effect because then what God put in our hearts is to cry after him so anything stifle in that crime is can't be God you have to be a deep in you piston on hungry whether you are king or whether you are lowly peasant because that didn't stop David from sale has the heart pant after the water broke so my soul test after the Living God stopped you because your dis you at that you can't worship you can't praise God because you get a new dress and you don't want you to shut your ties swing this week show you how to be very careful because your jacket no press this morning and your door the jacket get disturbed you can't be intact you want to be like David when they may see the coming down the road yeah let me get the guns and his hoity-toity wife trying to put pressure on him to behave himself oh you can behave yourself when the king is coming in power oh you should behave yourself when the lamp of the book for you to behave yourself when the deliverance is at son [Applause] hallelujah you may be seated you're crippled your hand crippled your fingers start to move and you're supposed to behave yourself your foot paralyzed and your toes not to move and you expect me just watch the toe moving over it's all moving you've got to be crazy hallelujah the once was blind I'd gone up on one eye and yeah they say oh go man I will plant one eye open come on you had a rejoice brains call you up to thank him in advance so what he's about to do he's about to deliver he's about to set the people free boy yes or yes not less power every service Oh hallelujah hallelujah let me see that those demons will be telling each other time to leave and to leave and to leave and to leave time to leave they have to leave and my name shall pass them out all glory to God those fairies upon your life we serve an unnoticed [Applause] [Music] process prophecy and process with every prophecy there is a process to get to that prophecy Matthew two three and six when Herod the King had heard these things three wise men come in the city instead of all where is he born King of the Jews because we see a star in the east we travel for two years and become the worship we recognize the church is dead we recognize they're not in no atmosphere they recognize nothing honor expectation but we in the spirit because for two years now the journey into dynamics we journey into see Messiah with Julian hallelujah not know what I'm saying [Applause] Sahara shook up but these men did come normal morning Herod the day Herod do you have any tour guides we want to see a tour on the city didn't come to tour they may come two years on Camelback or Hana bandits and robbers and they guided by this star there come two years ago on a tour of Jerusalem they come to see Messiah they come to talk about marriage he never come to discuss some things with no men's association that Denis Tornillo the plan is a pact demoscene nothing because they were seeing there was gonna be worship there were a little joy Revelation chapter 5 they will understand Alam talk the book and the book of redemption will be nuns Holden Berlina Kurt let me stream wise men wise men not foolish than wise men they thought everybody excited like them it's not everybody end tools right down inside pepper where is he [Applause] and then preachers both hoo-hoo-hoo talking about and in and Moses message so when Herod the King got these reports these these shaken nation dynamical effect this thing that a ship the mission slow quick let's go right up to the king you know to the top level when Herod the King have heard these things he was troubled not only and all Jerusalem with him Oh hallelujah oh my you don't wanna see again comin all Jerusalem will be shaken will be shaken what's happened a bride this covenant is that [Applause] Oh hallelujah last week when that which is perfect is come go to a pot pack is accepted on kill you know what I'm seeing part is okay on pill but when that which is perfect is come dropping part the preserving perfection oh how you with me now do you see it when they got it together all the chief priests the scribes and Pharisees the guy together so no doubt they got it together because I hear something he demanded of them where Christ should be born no did this that should be the top of the town they should have know that because it had all the courts that Moses scrolls that all the word that 400 years the talk about Moses head and all this head and the prophecy said but no I'd be man come tell me when he was above new born in Bethlehem of Judea for thus it is written by the process the court in Scripture if I be taught in Hanna Judah I've known the least of the princes of Judah for all talisha come a governor that's a room where people Israel that is the prophecy unless occurred a process and I came to pass in those days that the window the decree is a Luke chapter 205 from Caesar Augustus that all the world shall be taxed and this tax most ways made my Cyrenius government of Syria and all went to be taxed everyone in his own City and Joseph also went up from Galilee out of the city of Nazareth into Judea into the City of David which is called Bethlehem to be taxed with Mary his exposed wife being great with child so the prophecy said Jesus can be born in Bethlehem but Mary is not in Bethlehem how does the prophecy fulfill what is the process that takes it to fulfillment it's one thing to another prophecy but what about the process the process means taxation they talked the process means order have to come down to get Mary to move from that position to your position what about the prophecy over your land [Applause] to every prophecy Daniel there's a process could we give the Lord a shout in the house [Applause] prophecy John 20:21 Jesus and unto them peace be unto you as my father sent me even so send I you when he had said this he breathed on them receiving the Holy Ghost prophecy recvd Holy Ghost somebody wanna test someone he told me receive a little ghost didn't tell em you are evil he goes he didn't receive any who legal but look at the process Luke 24:49 says and behold I send the promise of my father upon you but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from one hang and he let them far as the Bethany lifted up his hands bless them and it came to pass while he blessed them he was parted from them and carried up into heaven and they worship and returned to Jerusalem with great joy and they were continually in the temple praising and blessing God that was the process it can be power coming down and you know part of the process it can be you wanna pass your exams and you're not studying because tutting is part of the process to be successful in your examination it cannot be you looking for a job and you sit at home you are lying to yourself you're not looking for a job stay at home no you can't look over a promotion and you're not trying to improve your skill set there is the process where you go hire a local fella

last one those that fell on get wrong you don't worry about them they break it off they push the note they have something inside of them a sense of purpose sense a destiny definite goal only watch them have problem touching them they a different breed altogether hallelujah they're just different let us take the kingdom by violence by force they have no no no financier they didn't make you know become yes because they will not and keep on knocking they will ask and keep on asking oh come on or give the Lord some praises the people all together that's a good drum tender people they just don't

Paul know this is not I talking bad about Paul this is Paul giving his own testimony this is Paul's testimony copy CML what say I deer for sure run not as uncertainly so fight I not as one a piece of the air but I I pour I keep my body and bring it into subjection this is process now to get to the end product of the Reese to win this race I keep my body and bring it on the subjection least by any means when i have preached to others i myself should be a castaway paul was playing was insane hi brother Paul you remember you respect the Apostle Paul he wasn't talking that he was bringing it on real he was saying you know what if I don't get this right I'll be a castaway so I want to get this thing right now the amplified says now every athlete who goes into training conducts himself temperately and restricts himself in all things they do it they win a reach that was louisa who we do it to receive a crown of eternal blessedness that cannot wither therefore I do not run uncertainly without definite aim I do not balk like one bit in the air I'm striking with an anniversary these are air boxes on you if you don't women there's nobody there so all you doing you doing motions and there's no Vienna media you have no bull to fight yellow mania man you have no yeah haven't got nothing or do you fight not and some of us that we you know fight up with ourselves God comes in your trial because you still caught up in you gotta to get you okay you to send you in a trial you have invited with your own self shipping is a every walk on the porch on it and it chipped on yourself before now nobody took that Lana you're walking so crazy that you're tripping your own self they're coming simple proof for me brother no graduate vividly Paulson dear for these amplified I do not wonder certainly without definite aim I do not box like one beat in the air and strike him with an with with with without an adversary but like a boxer I buff it my body handle it roughly discipline it by hatchet subdue it for fear that after proclaiming the others are gospel and things pertaining to it I myself should become unfit and I have not stand the test be unapproved and rejected as a conquer feet that is not that is not skin look second Timothy two one two five read the Bible in prayer every day a little grew Timothy now therefore my son be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus and the things that other was heard of me among many witnesses the same commit on the faithful men who shall be able to teach us others also doubt therefore and your happiness as a good soldier of Christ listen to us now no man that wore it entangling himself with the affairs of this life that he may purpose that he may please him who has chosen him to be a soldier and if a man also strive for masteries yet here we go he is not crowned except he strived lawfully are you still with me now so it's not just winning the race but it's how now let's take a look at the amplified of these rules take with me your share of hardship and sufferings which you are called to endure as a good first-class soldier of Christ Jesus like that first-class soldiers no soldier when in service get entangled in the enterprise of civilian life our soldiers in Saturday will understand that soldier has not a civilian soldier is a soldier isn't that right his aim is to satisfy and please the ones who enlisted him competitive games he is not lawfully crowned unless he competes lawfully fairly according to the rules lead down are you with me Baram says this Napoleon was defeated because he never played by the rules of the game and remember this that's a good lesson for the Church of the Living God if we don't play the game according to the rules we'll be disqualified at the end you have to keep the rules of the game to win and if the rules of the game in this place is a man to be born again to enter the fellowship of Christ in His Church we might be the greatest nomination on earth if we haven't played the rules we'll be disqualified we have got to come right straight with God oh praise the name of the Lord we got rules it isn't our rules it is his rules and we have got to abide by we are running the race according to his rules you see Napoleon aldo being a great warrior a great conqueror he conquered the people under fear and that's not the rule of the game the rule of the game is a conquer by love they see what happened all these churches where is Ruby dragon fear by the pontiff the bishop there is no other force in all the world as witness love and I'm almost sure as we as people have put too much emphasis upon rules don't mean to be rude and we have made ourselves and put too much stress upon those rules or the final self disqualified now here this bum what if Martin Luther would have played the rules of the game there would never been a Methodist Church what if the Methodists are pleased by the rules of the game they were never never been a pet what are you saying that the church would have been growing into maturity into that perfection into that son of God isn't that right but because the rules were not broken gonna have to get somebody else let's read on what is the messages I've played the rules of the game right they're never in a Pentecostal Church but if we feel the player the rules of the game right gourville disqualifiers and raised up out of these stones children to Abraham so when Luther fell what say you know what somebody else bring Wesley I'm gonna try with them to see how they're gonna run and then when they broke he gripped me Brizzy Pentecostal when they broke he had to bring william branham to bring back the word because when the dynamics when the dynamic struck the Pentecostals it did not prevent the perfection did you hear what I'm saying the spirit fell among the Pentecostals and it couldn't bring them to perfection because it didn't have the word hallelujah they had the gifts they still have them but it didn't go on to perfection and Paul said let us go on to perfection we have got to get there now we have to journey to it we have to get to it we have to see it we have to behold it because the bride is called to it [Applause] so God wants the game played right and we must do it so it doesn't make any difference how much we feel like we are progressing on until we get back to the rule of the game so I know like the rabbit and the whole one on and a whole together wit right that I hold it good rabbit have to come out it is one or the new song in Saturday just weed feel we are reaching the right by the wood because what about Oliver I said this is a brother if God has given you a talent stay with that talent no matter what you try to do if that talent isn't operated no matter how great it is if it isn't operating appointed rules you'll be disqualified so it's a little more than being talented and I want you to see amen to that it's a little more by being that than being gifted little more than that it's not much more than that and that is what you have to be interested in the process what goes with talent what goes with gift or she say this with what God expect to go with talents or what God expect to go with gifts so you said everyone knows in Olympics after the exercise no matter if you're right first in the race if you haven't played by the rule you're disqualified just last week the Olympic Committee I didn't even know they do that they keep blood samples of athletes from all the different years and stuff because of Technology they are accurate way of measuring and knowing if somebody had drugs in their system so they no pull out and disqualify people that took Platt in the Olympics 15 years ago they take back the gold from them that's a quality silver went winner and say you have the goal now and the interview one of em says all the missus been on the podium foot foot for the goal because you see at that time they got silver but no Andalite is shown on the condition back there and reveal the dis person was taken enhancement drugs to give them a more spiritual means only to realize that the inspector the drug inspector examining the process examining the way they run all these are common disqualify them and put the metal under somebody else or could we say Amen somebody this is this is strong this is deep this is real and it's coming near you or give the law some praises people [Applause] so now you will see when people motive an objective what is the real deep desire when that come to the fore they're high you're gonna see the sincere that's why Baram says it take a humble heart dedicated to God to bring Jesus Christ into the present tense God will not use arrogance go and not use pride the Bible talk about the dick come in which I be burned and all the proud and all of you we can say by just double all the proud and all that do wickedly said that table a dreadful they come in but behold I send you Elijah the Prophet before that great and terrible day of the Lord do you love them this morning it's not a mind-blowing thing that they could go back 15 years 10 years check back the blood sample and see exactly what was in that blood and say you know what you don't deserve the goal because you took something and not supposed to take you didn't go to the right process you are disqualified I don't want to do that I want those trouble at the Riverside Oh glory to God hallelujah praise God so therefore you utterly aside the weight under sin that's what easily beset you and you want to run with patience the race that is set before you Oh glory to God you wanna run because this is a race brother this is a real sister some of our staff young runnin and we had no glasses we had black hair no gray hair and we started running a long time ago and we are still runnin Oh hallelujah and we have been called to run with patience [Applause] Oh glory to God hallelujah my patients have a perfect work but Abraham says we find the church here we are tonight in the shadows of the common of the Lord son of God we find a church in an anemic condition we ought to be a great strong mighty wires are the shield of the faith that would shake our nation God give it to us that's how the truth supposed to be strong mighty I'm so far shaken up the nation do believe that 10% say Amen the rest wondering when they will believe that Oh hallelujah but I have overcome all evildoers hallelujah praise good your wandering doesn't bother me at all I just have to wood to pile up on you come on you're gonna make it I'll miss the Kenya here second idea Oh hallelujah you're gonna leave you know come on Jesus he became us sinners that we will become his righteousness in all of us he he became I pick my tea but he became me then I might become him that's what he took my place that I could take his place why I think Jesus went to hell because our Casilla he took our sins upon himself so since end of the hell but health and whole is character [Applause] soon we're like a big store like a big rock sing Jesus dong into hell but when Jesus or flawed character it just Britt that rock the float back up after three days the other come back up you can hold back character that which is good always rises to the top glory to God you can't hold you back my god want to single you out we're gonna find you out Oh hallelujah praise God hallelujah so know you'll understand is no problem with lions then it along with fiery furnace you know it then a problem as long as quasi with you is a liner e-street that's not a problem as long as God with you oh my this this is part hang get you I wanna reach efficient alright Susan prisoner forever now not here at starts is he that finishes there are no shortcuts you're disqualified at the end of the race no shortcuts you must come the way the Scriptures said repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost there is no shortcut shaking hands join in church or denomination you come the way except you die to yourself and be born of the Spirit of God you are lost it's a big one right this young man came to Jesus say good master what I what can I do to inherit eternal life Jesus bullying bullying my curveball Commandments he's a witch because he couldn't know he and his shop he know your catch him on this one the kitchen and the kitchen mother I know what if I catch him on so you see which so when Jesus laid on him he said but from a youth I committed to those things you can smell those things Jesus if you would be perfect that's the question to you this morning the bride has caught the perfection if you want to be perfect go and sell what you have know the emphasis dear I want to bring a certain thought behind that the man had possession it was the imaginary thing enough I imagine we need a lot too and I know it wasn't that I imagined a big house know he had possessions and you have possessions this morning it don't have to be money it don't have to be physical you can have a lot of lust passion anger you could have a lot of stuff in your life and your spirit that belongs to you if you own it it's like it's like your property then you only want to give it up yeah I want to let it go you don't want to pay the price but Jesus introduced [Music] cost factor if you want to be perfect no no if you want to be a church member you don't have to sell nothing you don't just come to church and go home and check people hand and smile you don't have to pick tights offering building fun you don't have to encourage nobody it is still
