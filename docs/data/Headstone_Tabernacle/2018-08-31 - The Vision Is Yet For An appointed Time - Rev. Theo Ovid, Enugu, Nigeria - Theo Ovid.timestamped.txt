[53:03] catch the vision and cope with the word
[53:08] that's the inspiration that I have catch
[53:10] the vision and cope with the word now
[53:16] Jesus he rebuked his own disciples when
[53:21] they didn't have a real positive
[53:23] testimony when he was talking to them
[53:26] after he rose from the dead he actually
[53:29] told them all fools and slow of heart to
[53:32] believe all that the prophets have
[53:34] spoken or not Christ to have suffered
[53:37] these things and to enter into his glory
[53:40] so he was telling them I mean you
[53:42] supposed to know this stuff if I told
[53:45] you I'll be offered I told you all these
[53:47] things but he went on and did something
[53:50] to them and he the Bible says that these
[53:55] are the words this is Luke this is from
[53:59] 2444 which I spoken to you while I was
[54:02] yet with you that all things must be
[54:06] fulfilled which was written in the law
[54:08] of Moses and in the prophets and in the
[54:11] Psalms concerning me then open he their
[54:17] understanding that they might understand
[54:20] the scriptures and said unto them thus
[54:23] it is written and thus it behooves
[54:26] Christ to suffer and to rise from the
[54:29] today on from the dead on the third day
[54:31] and so on and who is 49 his pretend is
[54:35] presented to them so now that he's
[54:38] opened it understand in the description
[54:40] open the word to them he is pretending
[54:43] to them the vision of what they must
[54:45] expect and what they have to look
[54:48] forward to what was the target what was
[54:51] the endgame what was the goal and he
[54:55] said behold I
[54:56] and the promise of my father upon you
[54:59] but tarry in the city of Jerusalem until
[55:02] you be endued with power from on high
[55:06] yellow is a stay there until stay there
[55:10] until this power that I've been loosed
[55:13] by my father because I did a price I
[55:16] paid a price
[55:18] I just come off the cross I am now risen
[55:21] from the dead and know that I have done
[55:24] that nothing could stop the power from
[55:27] being released the power is on its way
[55:30] but be in position to receive it and he
[55:35] Jesus let them us faster Bethany he
[55:38] lifted up his hands and bless them and
[55:40] it came to pass while he blessed them he
[55:43] was parting from them so he was leaving
[55:46] now nobody was crying
[55:48] nobody was depressed nobody was
[55:50] frustrated and Jesus was leaving and
[55:53] they worship him and returned to
[55:56] Jerusalem with great joy he's gone what
[56:05] did they have in there Jesus told him if
[56:07] I don't go the comforter will not come
[56:11] and then knew he was leaving something
[56:14] else is coming well get the Lord a shout
[56:17] in the house
[56:19] Oh hallelujah
[56:24] that is when and they were and they were
[56:27] continually in the temple praising and
[56:30] blessing God because now their mind is
[56:33] open up the understanding is open up the
[56:36] world has been Brook to them
[56:37] praise God not to look for some man that
[56:39] interpret more words to them they don't
[56:42] have to look to some bishop somewhere or
[56:44] some man of God from somewhere or a
[56:47] certain man have to come and be this and
[56:50] this certain man didn't have to look for
[56:51] that no more
[56:52] they got spoken word they got Jesus own
[56:55] words they got the breath of God
[56:58] receiving the Holy Ghost they got the
[57:00] breath of God upon their life no man
[57:02] didn't we get this God spoke it and we
[57:06] are promised we have been promised
[57:08] equality Luke 17 thirdly the son of man
[57:12] would be reveal again that's not a son
[57:15] of man that's the son of man so decent a
[57:19] man was veiled in that prophet DS shadow
[57:22] man was veiled in William Branham so the
[57:26] words coming on that prophets mouth
[57:27] wasn't William branham's words what's
[57:30] the words of the Son of Man and the
[57:33] Solomon who came to Abraham he said I
[57:37] will return unto thee according to the
[57:40] time of life appointed this vision of
[57:46] God this prophetic vision that was
[57:50] released by seven seals and seven
[57:52] thunders there's an appointed time for
[57:55] this vision to be fulfilled but this
[57:57] shall be fulfilled and shall come to
[58:00] pass
[58:00] don't swore by himself that ain't going
[58:04] to come to pass
[58:05] ordinary mothers even
[58:08] or glory to God hallelujah my Kojima be
[58:14] seated
[58:14] Oh hallelujah so when God came down in
[58:19] Genesis 18 Genesis 19 to tell them I
[58:22] will return to be a corner time of life
[58:24] two angels went on to Sodom under
[58:27] investigative judgment isn't that right
[58:29] but one angel stays in the backside of
[58:32] the desert with Abraham another angel
[58:34] said the Lord said shall I hide from
[58:36] Abraham the thing which I about to do so
[58:40] core data print the seals on the
[58:42] backside of the desert to Abraham to
[58:45] reveal to Abraham judgment was next
[58:48] coming to Sodom or glory to God but
[58:51] Abram as the elect have to get the
[58:53] divine revelation and vision as Kings
[58:58] that ought to be or glory to God we
[59:01] believe that and because God brought
[59:04] that upon Abraham Abraham brick in the
[59:07] intercession the brief a lot because
[59:10] luck was a believer accident but a
[59:13] believer formal but a believer lukewarm
[59:16] but a believer it was family
[59:19] Oh glory to cook and you can make
[59:22] revelation 22:17
[59:31] it has to be a scriptural voice so
[59:37] Abraham was anointed with revelation
[59:40] 22:17
[59:41] to go after his brother lot Oh glory to
[59:45] God is not right Oh hallelujah praise

[1:15:31] died since 1965 and we arrested we are
[1:15:37] resting on this coach on these words
[1:15:41] because the spirit the prophet and the
[1:15:45] bride will say the same thing and what
[1:15:49] they say would already be said in the
[1:15:51] world
[1:15:54] [Applause]
[1:16:15] LeBron said it's got to be a promise to
[1:16:19] enter into the rest what to fear that we
[1:16:23] don't have a promise but we have a
[1:16:25] promise the promise is the antenna is
[1:16:27] rest you may be seated
[1:16:32] [Applause]
[1:16:41] so you're even a battle tonight to fight
[1:16:45] to get into his rest because his rest is
[1:16:48] the promise what about him said this
[1:16:50] here he said watch notice let us
[1:16:54] therefore fear lisa promise being left
[1:16:56] us the end in distress so I want you to
[1:16:59] remember that unless we find out unless
[1:17:01] God reveal it to us here we go no matter
[1:17:04] how much you go to church that has
[1:17:06] nothing to do with it God must come by
[1:17:08] revelation and reveal himself to us and
[1:17:12] that takes all the teens of the world
[1:17:15] out that's not good
[1:17:21] I'm not hearing of amens on that that's
[1:17:27] not like 60% something like a 1 I heard
[1:17:31] a read it again maybe younger idea God
[1:17:34] must come by revelation and reveal
[1:17:38] himself to us and that takes all the
[1:17:41] world polity that will out
[1:17:48] because once is being being made plain
[1:17:51] to you you could run if you read it
[1:17:55] don't walk your run with it because I
[1:17:57] run with a message it is clear can you
[1:18:00] see not only coming for your soul or
[1:18:03] your spirit you come in for your very
[1:18:05] body itself you want to be completely
[1:18:07] redeemed Oh hallelujah praise God in an
[1:18:11] but a Branham now remember now remember
[1:18:15] you may be seated
[1:18:16] they were on their road to rest the
[1:18:17] pillar of fire let them and we want to
[1:18:19] find out what is this rest watch so
[1:18:22] first you have to end into the stress
[1:18:24] but it shouldn't come short of it so
[1:18:27] when you know you have a promise don't
[1:18:28] come short of it you want to be faithful
[1:18:31] to the promise of God you want to see it
[1:18:33] manifested in your life not in the
[1:18:36] church but in your life and then you can
[1:18:40] come to church with it in your life you
[1:18:43] understand - revival in your home you
[1:18:46] can't start something in the church what
[1:18:48] you don't have in your home you have to
[1:18:50] get it on the inside inside that way
[1:18:52] just when you're praying go in the
[1:18:54] secret closet and pray dr. heavenly
[1:18:56] father who sees in secret when we want
[1:18:59] you openly or gives a lot of shout

[1:19:20] it look after it right now right now by
[1:19:25] your worship by your shows by the
[1:19:26] Airman's by your hallelujah
[1:19:32] you are creating the atmosphere right
[1:19:35] now
[1:19:35] [Applause]
[1:19:38] maybe season here is the promise here is
[1:19:43] what we got to feel if there's not a
[1:19:46] promise left us but the Prophet said but
[1:19:50] there is a promise and the next thing
[1:19:52] don't come short of it now the thought
[1:19:55] is if we are on our way to the rest what
[1:19:58] is the rest where is it
[1:19:59] it is join in church it'll being
[1:20:01] baptized decision we is it becoming
[1:20:03] remember the greatest church in the city
[1:20:04] we're in better clothes it is education
[1:20:06] is it money so we can quit work and just
[1:20:08] lay down rest the rest of our lives
[1:20:10] that's not it
[1:20:12] listening to what the Bible says it is
[1:20:14] let us therefore fear
[1:20:16] Lisa promise left us that enter into his
[1:20:19] rest that you should come short of it
[1:20:22] for unto us the gospel was preached as
[1:20:25] well under them what is the gospel the
[1:20:27] good news the good news came to them in
[1:20:29] Egypt that quarter-cent the deliverer
[1:20:31] he's going to bring us out and take us
[1:20:33] to the promised land the good news for
[1:20:35] us now is that God sent a deliverer the
[1:20:38] Holy Ghost and we are on the road to the
[1:20:41] promised land and the people has made
[1:20:43] Cui's and denomination but God still
[1:20:46] remains that our rest is the Holy Ghost
[1:20:48] so this rest is the Holy Ghost we are
[1:20:52] pressing towards the Holy Ghost
[1:20:54] that's our promised land is the land of
[1:20:57] the Holy Ghost in that land of power in
[1:21:00] that line of deliverance in that land of
[1:21:02] freedom in that land of miracles in that
[1:21:05] land of anointing and that granule
[1:21:07] contact with the supernatural in that
[1:21:09] land of angels descend an angel walking
[1:21:11] back and forth that's in that
[1:21:14] oh it's a good man oh he is here tonight
[1:21:17] Oh blowing up cotton in Alleluia
[1:21:22] somewhere around says here the word
[1:21:24] preached did not profit them not being
[1:21:26] mixed with fate and then I heard it so
[1:21:29] after was it have to go beyond your
[1:21:30] Shelton priests you have to be praising
[1:21:33] God on a planet to your own heart he
[1:21:35] said no no matter how much the word is
[1:21:36] preached how well you like the way it's
[1:21:38] being preached unless you yourself are
[1:21:40] partaker of that it won't do you one bit
[1:21:43] of good so you gotta say this is mines
[1:21:45] man I'm taking it tonight my taking it
[1:21:48] back home to my wife or glory to God
[1:21:50] husband love your wife that's the word
[1:21:52] or glory they're going you have to
[1:21:54] express it you have to show it you have
[1:21:55] to live it take it back all hallelujah
[1:21:58] praise be to Jesus or glory no God in it
[1:22:02] hallelujah you may be seated so Genesis
[1:22:06] 1 goes to let every seat before and
[1:22:08] after its kind and God could only speak
[1:22:10] that because quad notice it have the
[1:22:12] power to transform itself into whatever
[1:22:15] the seat is isn't that right and but a
[1:22:18] man was talking about transformed to be
[1:22:20] made different to what has been its
[1:22:22] character and everything has to be
[1:22:24] changed and that's the word to be
[1:22:26] transformed isn't that right and God saw
[1:22:29] chaos and darkness and God saw the
[1:22:31] condition but that didn't intimidate God
[1:22:35] darkness and chaos and confusion didn't
[1:22:38] intimidate God all that has to happen is
[1:22:41] the spirit half the moon I wants the
[1:22:44] spirit moves it has to have a voice
[1:22:46] because God have to use the voice of his
[1:22:49] word or glory no God is not just a
[1:22:52] spirit move the screen of the connect
[1:22:54] with the voice the voice have to speak
[1:22:57] and the word becomes that season to
[1:23:00] produce the miracle Oh glory to God so
[1:23:03] God transform chaos into a garden a Eden
[1:23:07] isn't that right everything was perfect
[1:23:09] he commanded each one of those seeds of
[1:23:12] what there would be that they would
[1:23:13] transform themselves into the plant of
[1:23:16] which kind of life that the Word of God
[1:23:19] spoken in them should be it was an oak
[1:23:22] tree it was the bridge were an oak it
[1:23:24] was a path
[1:23:25] what a perm because the Creator just
[1:23:27] sent this word and everything under his
[1:23:30] control now when he put the seed in the
[1:23:32] earth this seed can only come forth with
[1:23:35] the power of life within it and that is
[1:23:38] why God put that seed in you when before
[1:23:41] the foundation of the world you are not
[1:23:43] in charge of that seed that's his seed
[1:23:46] or glory to God let me say it again you
[1:23:50] are not in charge of that see the
[1:23:53] predestinated mission who you are he's
[1:23:55] in charge of that is who he foreknew he
[1:23:58] called you have to knew you before
[1:24:00] that's why he called you because he knew
[1:24:03] the seed where they planted in Nigeria
[1:24:09] your ceiling whatever village whatever
[1:24:14] state he had to find you
[1:24:16] I mean know where you are
[1:24:19] well glory to God that mother Eagle know
[1:24:23] where you are
[1:24:24] he's a seed inside of you oh yes yeah
[1:24:27] fleshly habits yes you have a human
[1:24:29] spirit you didn't even know you had
[1:24:31] acceded when you were smoking and
[1:24:33] drinking but what was looking after you
[1:24:35] all the time because you know one day
[1:24:37] you have to hear that call you have to
[1:24:39] hear that call or glory that God listen
[1:24:43] we were getting soon and we heard a call
[1:24:46] and the people that are dead in the
[1:24:47] grave they don't hear a call one day -
[1:24:50] Oh glory to God God Collier the Baptist
[1:24:53] Church of Methodist Church what corner
[1:24:55] of the University of the drunkenness of
[1:24:58] the adultery of the fornication what to
[1:25:00] call you further and transform you into
[1:25:03] a son and daughter of the Living God
[1:25:06] to reproduce and manifest Jesus Christ
[1:25:10] do you believe it
[1:25:12] amen each one of those seeds let me go
[1:25:16] you may be seizing each one of those
[1:25:19] seeds has the power in itself I love
[1:25:24] this the transform itself into the
[1:25:28] species that I desire it to be that is
[1:25:33] what make me that that's what it must be
[1:25:36] because I have given every seed let me
[1:25:38] go transform in power
[1:25:41] [Applause]
[1:25:45] to make out of itself in its potentials
[1:25:49] no to make out of itself exactly what I
[1:25:53] wanted to be God has never changed
[1:25:57] I'm just the same as he was then God is
[1:26:00] he telling to do something nothing is
[1:26:02] going to stop him and he will do it
[1:26:05] that's why when God finished with his
[1:26:07] works he turned his back and rested
[1:26:10] because you know every secret word of
[1:26:13] this time so part of this guy so
[1:26:18] gorgeous rested and let the magic work
[1:26:26] and bored acting on this drama composer

[1:27:12] you die and there was no gambling house
[1:27:14] there was no drinking homes there was
[1:27:17] this Adam Eve his wife and a gardener

[1:27:49] iniquity understand this if God don't
[1:27:51] hold you you fall let's let's talk so
[1:28:04] don't play more righteous than anyone
[1:28:06] inside of here if God don't hold you
[1:28:10] before that's my damn except I look unto
[1:28:16] the hills from whence cometh my help

[1:29:14] tied up hallelujah we are prejudiced
[1:29:16] tied up under before sometimes it
[1:29:19] industry but the twisting but there is
[1:29:23] coming a power and it's coming a brain
[1:29:26] that can have revelation 22:17

[1:31:05] another season do you understand that
[1:31:08] God's objective was to bring back the
[1:31:13] original man that was supposed to be
[1:31:16] standing in the gadna even as if he
[1:31:19] never did fall that's why God introduced
[1:31:23] justification not just forgiveness but
[1:31:27] justification is you never did it we
[1:31:31] can't even figure that out but God could
[1:31:35] because only he as far as I know have a

[1:35:02] the street so you moving on that street
[1:35:04] or you cut them off here because what
[1:35:06] take you up into a vision and when you
[1:35:08] come down from that vision you are
[1:35:10] invincible because we know the next move
[1:35:12] and that's what quarters to abraham
[1:35:14] shall I hide from Abraham what I'm about
[1:35:16] to do just think you are here and cause
[1:35:19] about the biggest seventh on the revival

[1:35:37] vision hallelujah I had vision that's
[1:35:42] why quad abandon was so caught up his I
[1:35:43] see that right called I see she's sealed
[1:35:46] in this game when he what is he talking
[1:35:48] from he's talking from up dear he see

[1:36:04] live to see it
[1:36:05] he said it's so close I could see it
[1:36:09] missing limbs being restored the prophet
[1:36:12] prophesy missing limbs that's why I'm
[1:36:17] excited because he ever loved to look
[1:36:20] sour to
[1:36:21] [Applause]
[1:36:23] oh there's another negative less than
[1:36:29] negative we could spoon true but we were
[1:36:31] talking about that we talked about
[1:36:32] bridle promises and the vision that have
[1:36:34] to be clear to you because windows guys
[1:36:37] got the vision from Jesus they were
[1:36:39] clean and clear about what they were
[1:36:41] about that's why the Whitney upper room
[1:36:43] and waited in fear it's not that they
[1:36:49] were they was Poland no no no they were
[1:36:51] fearful but they know what they expect
[1:36:53] him power to take away that fear they
[1:36:57] were nervous but power control our
[1:36:59] takeover all of that this power is
[1:37:01] promised I love it I love it I love it
[1:37:03] Oh glory to God in the Upper Room was
[1:37:07] pastor and congregation apostle and
[1:37:10] communication bishop oncologist and
[1:37:12] everybody was of me upper room the heart
[1:37:14] was the hideous room because power is
[1:37:16] from the Father or do you believe that
[1:37:19] tonight Oh glory to God hallelujah amen
[1:37:24] amen amen
[1:37:25] blow it up God so before before the word
[1:37:30] could be manifested a seed has to be
[1:37:32] spoken
[1:37:33] let there be let there be let there be
[1:37:35] that's the word seed and then it's
[1:37:38] manifested is the real seed so gotta to
[1:37:41] speak you first so you are thought by
[1:37:47] past you see often in the world God sent
[1:37:49] a prophet to connect you back with your
[1:37:51] world so when you get a word preached
[1:37:53] you connect with it because the world is
[1:37:55] an expression of you the thought of what
[1:37:58] you are you are become a world
[1:38:00] expression so you have to connect with
[1:38:02] the world or glory to God you can't help
[1:38:04] it it's part of your makeup it's part of
[1:38:08] your call it's part of the gene and your
[1:38:10] soul you can't help it I'm gonna be a
[1:38:13] perfect man yet I'm gonna be a perfect
[1:38:16] man because that is my seed
[1:38:19] [Applause]

[1:38:24] [Applause]
[1:38:27] what if I'm talking about ministers
[1:38:29] could be halfway go to McCaffrey
[1:38:30] preachers but we just could be hovering
[1:38:32] reason they get their own week messed up
[1:38:36] and an interrupted promo but for their
[1:38:38] lives but core don't make a free
[1:38:39] preachers he makes full preachers he put
[1:38:42] something in since the teach preaches
[1:38:44] the preach isn't that right
[1:38:46] but the thing about them we can get
[1:38:48] mixed up and messed up in our own human
[1:38:49] spirit and affect the program of y'all
[1:38:52] because God wants to be conductors of
[1:38:54] the Spirit so we have to become the word
[1:38:56] isn't that right and once you become the
[1:38:59] word then you become a conductor that
[1:39:01] the speakin flow true difference that
[1:39:03] mashing up and doing that other things
[1:39:05] and give us hope for come out of the way
[1:39:07] if I come out of the way tonight who is
[1:39:09] speaking
[1:39:11] you said wherever gift the givers hope
[1:39:13] to come out of the way that the Holy
[1:39:15] Spirit could operate and speak to that
[1:39:17] gift where's a teaching give a prophetic
[1:39:20] if whatever gift it is it's how the cut
[1:39:22] out of the way
[1:39:23] I want man move out what moves in you
[1:39:26] hear from God and you know you hear from
[1:39:28] God or glory to God so sin John 14:12 is
[1:39:32] a seed the same works I do shall you do
[1:39:34] also sin John 15:7 is a seed if you're
[1:39:38] batting me in my ways I bury you you can
[1:39:40] ask what you will send Mac 16 is a seed
[1:39:42] these signs shall follow them that
[1:39:44] believe not maybe not perhaps these
[1:39:47] signs shall follow them not you follow
[1:39:50] signs signs following you wherever you
[1:39:53] go
[1:39:54] the signs are right behind you
[1:39:56] you can't help it because this is the
[1:39:59] word you can't help it because this is
[1:40:02] true
[1:40:04] [Applause]
[1:40:12] so when God made man he'll be Caesar in
[1:40:15] his own image after his kind the robber
[1:40:18] said what is his kind the word so the
[1:40:24] man that God made was would kindly not
[1:40:26] interpretation kind with a kind you see
[1:40:33] man like the follow force installation
[1:40:35] because man making it easy for and easy
[1:40:47] for Abraham to believe to go too eager
[1:40:51] to have a child that they believed all
[1:40:53] wrinkled up Sarah go have it
[1:40:56] so that's right Abram could move like
[1:40:58] that because when God Abraham
[1:41:01] attrition of exact I see seen the baby
[1:41:04] but when you look at Sarah he's your
[1:41:06] Lord now the thing about it quarter
[1:41:14] Abraham is true Sarah so he gotta force
[1:41:16] up you have to treat that woman rate or
[1:41:21] ever she is she I wanna cook that some
[1:41:23] day she wanted food and it doesn't
[1:41:26] matter that is still zero
[1:41:28] it's true that woman he will get that
[1:41:30] promise so ever had to walk right Oh
[1:41:37] liberally and make sure Sarah don't even
[1:41:44] because God didn't talk to Sara poor
[1:41:48] Sara here only watching the mirror and
[1:41:50] say good lord
[1:41:53] but abraham believed God not seeing
[1:41:57] agree here
[1:41:57] not seeing a wrinkle not Sarah grumpy
[1:42:04] and the Bible consider him a hero of it
[1:42:08] father of it and it's so accurate is it
[1:42:12] isn't a valid force even struggle but
[1:42:15] when when the subtle writes his
[1:42:16] testimonial the Bible said he staggered
[1:42:19] not at the promise of God
[1:42:22] she only sang God God sign that that
[1:42:27] that's already the cat question that
[1:42:29] testimonial look who signed it static
[1:42:33] not it's Ricky
[1:42:35] none and tonight we have not stager we
[1:42:41] stand on that rock
