[9:28] Oh Lord, thou has searched me and known
[9:31] me.
[9:32] Thou knowest my downsitting and my
[9:34] uprising.
[9:36] Thou understandeth my thought a far off.
[9:40] Thou compasseth my path and my lion down
[9:43] and quit it with all my ways. For there
[9:46] is not a word on my tongue, but lo, oh
[9:49] Lord, thou knowest it altogether.
[9:52] Thou hast beset me behind and before and
[9:56] lay thy hand upon me. Such knowledge is
[9:58] too wonderful for me. It is high. I
[10:00] cannot attain unto it. Whether shall I
[10:03] go from thy spirit or whether shall I
[10:05] flee from thy presence? If I ascend up
[10:08] in the heaven, thou art there. If I make
[10:10] my bell in hell, behold, thou art there.
[10:13] If I take the wings of the morning and
[10:16] dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea,
[10:19] even there shall thy hand lead me, and
[10:22] thy right hand shall hold me. Amen. May

[27:50] Before I have your seat, I just want to
[27:52] read two script uh scripture here from
[27:54] Joel chapter 3:10.
[27:57] Praise God. It says, "Beat your
[28:00] plowshares into swords
[28:02] and your prudent hooks into spears.
[28:06] &gt;&gt; Let the weak say,
[28:08] &gt;&gt; I am strong."
[28:09] &gt;&gt; You may have your seat.
[28:11] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord.
[28:13] &gt;&gt; So, I've been out to pursue a special
[28:16] mission. I was um in Miami and I am here
[28:20] tonight and um brother G I'm going to
[28:21] share something for you to you tonight.
[28:23] Praise the Lord. We appreciate him and
[28:26] um in a few days time I'll be off to
[28:28] India. So I want to solicit a prayer
[28:31] Friday late Friday night I'll be off to
[28:33] India have some meetings there and um
[28:37] it's quite something what the Lord is
[28:39] doing right now. But I want to exhort
[28:41] you tonight a little word before
[28:43] leaving. Let the weak say
[28:45] &gt;&gt; I am strong. I am strong.
[28:48] &gt;&gt; Something I said to the church in Miami,
[28:51] war is coming.
[28:54] &gt;&gt; Whether you're ready or not,
[28:56] &gt;&gt; war is coming.
[28:59] &gt;&gt; What next? Prepare for war
[29:02] &gt;&gt; because war is coming. Okay. So, I want
[29:04] to read the next scripture from Mark 16.
[29:06] This is Jesus. And when he and then when
[29:08] they had heard that he was alive and had
[29:11] been seen of her, believe not. This is
[29:13] disciples.
[29:14] This is Christians now. This is people
[29:16] in Jesus message with books with tips
[29:20] hearing the Messiah himself. They do
[29:22] believe after he taught them after he
[29:26] shared himself with them right after he
[29:28] appeared in another form and two of them
[29:30] as they walk and went into the country
[29:32] and they went and told it unto the
[29:34] residue neither believed them. This is
[29:36] believers now coming with a true
[29:38] testimony and they still not being
[29:40] believed.
[29:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. They still not been received.
[29:42] Afterward, he appeared to the 11 as they
[29:44] sat at meat and upgraded them or rebuked
[29:47] them or straightened them out
[29:48] &gt;&gt; and they of the and upra them with their
[29:52] unbelief and hardness of heart.
[29:54] &gt;&gt; Saints, we have a lot of repenting to
[29:56] do. you know,
[29:57] &gt;&gt; of unbelief and hardness of heart, you
[29:58] know, and a lot of repenting to do. You
[29:59] know, I myself, I said, "Look, but
[30:01] sometimes, you know, like um I misplaced
[30:04] two pictures, two passport pictures uh
[30:07] to get uh uh uh to apply for the visa
[30:11] for Nigeria." And um just couldn't find
[30:14] it. And I'm praying home, I said, "Lord,
[30:16] you know exactly where this is. I don't
[30:18] have to go and take no more pictures.
[30:19] It's somewhere here in the house. You
[30:21] know exactly where it is." And I keep
[30:23] looking different things. And
[30:24] afterwards, I just felt led to move a
[30:26] certain way. And and there it was. I
[30:28] said, "But God is God and such a lift a
[30:30] band and praise God." Because it was
[30:31] such a thing. And I'm thinking to
[30:34] myself, how much time we neglect asking
[30:36] God and seeking the Lord and and looking
[30:39] intervention and we going in the
[30:40] humanistic realm and fighting up,
[30:42] fighting up. But we have to come to this
[30:43] place where we have absolute trust and
[30:45] confidence that the God we serve, the
[30:48] God you serve, he said, "My people shall
[30:50] never be ashamed and be satisfied and
[30:53] praise the name of the Lord your God."
[30:55] We went through all kind of stuff, but
[30:57] he said something about his people. He
[30:59] said, "My people shall never be
[31:00] ashamed." Oh, praise God. You would get
[31:03] back your strength. You would get back
[31:04] your courage. You would get back your
[31:06] faith. Praise God. Afterwards he
[31:08] appeared unto 11 as they sat at meat and
[31:10] upraided him and their unbelief and
[31:12] hardness of heart. Listen he called it
[31:14] unbelief.
[31:15] &gt;&gt; These are nice precious believers
[31:18] disciples you know he say hardness of
[31:20] heart because they believe not them
[31:23] which seeing him after he was risen.
[31:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:25] &gt;&gt; And he said unto them and with all that
[31:27] he rebuked them but they are the ones he
[31:29] have to use.
[31:30] &gt;&gt; They are the ones God have to use. After
[31:32] all the rebukes don't feel bad that you
[31:35] that that that you're finished. You're
[31:36] not finished at all. You know, God will
[31:38] as many as I love, I rebuke. I don't
[31:41] rebuke them. Do who I don't love. You
[31:42] know what? You see why who I love, I
[31:44] rebuke them and chasen them and
[31:47] straighten them out and upra them and
[31:50] encourage them. Oh, praise the name of
[31:52] the Lord. Hallelujah. Praise God.
[31:54] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[31:56] &gt;&gt; Taking my grandson from school today and
[31:59] there's a little drain to cross to go go
[32:01] to the house. I said, "You could cross
[32:02] that." And he just step over it. I said,
[32:04] "Look at that. You could do it." And he
[32:06] did it. Normally he's lift him up over
[32:07] and thing, but he crossed it this time.
[32:09] And I'm watching him and I'm telling
[32:10] myself, I wonder what God has be seen
[32:12] with us. Boy, when God see us crossing
[32:14] things that we never crossed before,
[32:16] overcoming things we never overcome
[32:17] before. I feel God is feel proud of his
[32:20] sons and daughters. Maybe you never
[32:21] think about that. Praise God. But you
[32:23] see the little effort that you're
[32:24] making. You see the little that you're
[32:26] doing and oh, praise God. When you start
[32:28] to do that, God will feel proud of you.
[32:30] Look at my son. My son coming. You see,
[32:32] because they are small guys. They are
[32:34] big men in small form.
[32:38] &gt;&gt; We see little children but they are
[32:40] really you know mini ones of the big
[32:42] ones.
[32:44] &gt;&gt; They just their time may come yet.
[32:45] They'll play like children act like
[32:47] children but their time is coming
[32:49] &gt;&gt; of maturity
[32:50] &gt;&gt; and I think God looking at us. We once
[32:53] were playing like children carrying
[32:54] foolish like children speaking wrong
[32:56] things and whatn not. When I was a child
[32:58] spake like a child understood like a
[33:00] child but when I became a man I put away
[33:02] childish things. So whenever God when we
[33:04] come to that spot, God feels proud. Look
[33:06] at my son. Look at my daughter. Oh,
[33:09] praise God. They're under pressure.
[33:10] They're under all kind of stress, but
[33:12] they holding on. They hanging inside of
[33:14] there. You think God doesn't see that?
[33:15] You think God doesn't see the intent of
[33:17] your heart and your desire. The devil
[33:19] want to point at your failures. The
[33:20] devil want to point at your
[33:21] shortcomings. The devil want to point at
[33:23] your past, but God is pointing towards
[33:25] your future. Beat the pouches. Oh, glory
[33:28] to God. Hallelujah. beat your pulse into
[33:32] sword. In other words, take your
[33:34] agricultural tool
[33:35] &gt;&gt; and cut it into weapons of warfare
[33:38] because you have to fight for what you
[33:40] know is your own. Okay, the Lord I
[33:42] shout. Don't just sit there and take
[33:44] licks on the enemy. Hallelujah. Let the
[33:48] weak say I am strong. The re, you know
[33:50] words, you're reversing the whole thing
[33:51] on the devil. Letting the devil know
[33:53] you're not going to just take that
[33:55] blows, but you're going to fight back.
[33:57] You're going to come back. You're going
[33:58] to come back better. You're going to
[34:00] come back stronger.
[34:02] [Applause]
[34:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[34:07] &gt;&gt; So he rebuked his disciples. He said
[34:09] unto them, these the same disciples now
[34:11] &gt;&gt; go into all the world and preach the
[34:13] gospel to every creature. Them fellas
[34:14] frighten them fell going and lock
[34:16] yourself up in your room. But he's given
[34:18] them a commission. Go into all the world
[34:20] and preach the gospel to every creature.
[34:23] He that believeth and is baptized shall
[34:25] be saved. He that believeth not shall be
[34:27] damned. And these signs shall follow
[34:30] them that believe in my name. This is
[34:32] Jesus talking now. They don't know
[34:33] prophet or pastor or teacher or
[34:35] evangelist. This is Jesus talking now.
[34:37] In my name, they shall cast out devils.
[34:38] They shall speak with new tongues. They
[34:40] shall take up serpents. And if they
[34:42] drink any deadly thing, it shall not
[34:43] hurt them. They shall lay hands on the
[34:45] sick and they shall recover.
[34:48] &gt;&gt; So then after the Lord has spoken unto
[34:50] them, he will receive up into heaven,
[34:52] sat in the right hand of God, and they
[34:54] went forth and preached everywhere. the
[34:56] Lord working with them and confirming
[34:59] the word with signs following.
[35:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:01] &gt;&gt; This is brother Brandham. He's praying.
[35:03] He's Oh God, how we need in this journey
[35:06] that we're in now to find a place of
[35:08] rest and to feast on the word of God
[35:11] &gt;&gt; so that it will give us strength.
[35:14] &gt;&gt; You can't get strength from movies.
[35:16] &gt;&gt; You can't get strength from comic strip
[35:18] or or or magazines and whatnot. You get
[35:20] strength from the word
[35:21] &gt;&gt; because the word is your source. So it
[35:24] will give us strength night after night.
[35:26] Go to the room and rest and come back
[35:28] next morning and fresh and eat more.
[35:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Why? Here why to eat more. For
[35:33] there's a great journey and a great
[35:35] battle ahead
[35:36] &gt;&gt; for the church.
[35:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:37] &gt;&gt; We're not talking about we talking about
[35:39] Putin and and and and Russia and China.
[35:41] We're not talking about that. We're
[35:42] talking about for the church.
[35:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:47] &gt;&gt; America send the war vessels looking to
[35:49] invade Venezuela or whatever they want
[35:50] to do. what they intend they want to do
[35:52] they have to do they do you know
[35:54] &gt;&gt; it's war it's spirits you know
[35:56] &gt;&gt; understand what is is is is
[35:58] principalities and powers and spirits
[36:00] territorial demons and thing you know
[36:02] fighting for position fighting for
[36:04] territory that what Russia is all about
[36:06] in Ukraine you know
[36:08] &gt;&gt; what about the bride
[36:10] &gt;&gt; we have a territory
[36:12] &gt;&gt; we have a domain
[36:14] &gt;&gt; we have things that God called us unto
[36:17] &gt;&gt; but he says the revelation to you is you
[36:20] have to fight
[36:21] &gt;&gt; for what you know
[36:22] &gt;&gt; is yours
[36:23] &gt;&gt; is your own. You can't possess what is
[36:25] not your own. But if the revelation of
[36:26] the word coming to you show you what is
[36:28] yours, you say that is my devil.
[36:31] &gt;&gt; You can't keep that back from me. I'm
[36:33] going to take back from the devil what
[36:34] he took from me.
[36:37] &gt;&gt; You can't sit down and just take life
[36:39] and say, well, you know, that's how it
[36:40] is. That's how it is. Cut that nonsense
[36:43] out
[36:44] &gt;&gt; and begin to fight.
[36:45] &gt;&gt; Shout out fight.
[36:47] &gt;&gt; Some of you not fighting, but you have
[36:48] to fight. God set it up that way. You'll
[36:51] hear that tonight.
[36:55] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham, there's a great
[36:56] journey and a great battle ahead for the
[36:59] church. I believe that we have been
[37:01] children long enough.
[37:05] &gt;&gt; God is going to turn his church into
[37:08] manhood now.
[37:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. and we played and frolic as
[37:14] children. But now we going to have to
[37:17] put away childish things and take on
[37:19] manhood maturity. I'm still reading.
[37:22] &gt;&gt; This is not a psychology book. This is
[37:23] from a prophet.
[37:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:25] &gt;&gt; I believe was Paul who said when I was a
[37:27] child, speaking as a child because he
[37:29] thought as a child, but it's time we
[37:31] begin to think like men and women now.
[37:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:34] &gt;&gt; For we have got to get down to business.
[37:36] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[37:37] &gt;&gt; Could somebody say amen?
[37:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[37:40] &gt;&gt; So, I pray for these ministers, their
[37:42] churches, their people. God, may their
[37:44] little churches grow until it spreads
[37:46] out and may out of their churches go
[37:48] mighty vanish and missionaries all over
[37:50] the world.
[37:51] &gt;&gt; He's praying for that.
[37:55] &gt;&gt; Let us work, Lord,
[37:58] for we know we have much more time to
[38:00] work.
[38:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:03] &gt;&gt; True.
[38:03] &gt;&gt; Remember, this is the time you had to
[38:05] work.
[38:05] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Whether you have your hair on
[38:07] your head or you're wearing a wig,
[38:08] &gt;&gt; this is the time you have to work.
[38:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:10] &gt;&gt; Whether you have shoes or you have no
[38:12] shoes, you have a hole in your shoes,
[38:13] this is the time to work.
[38:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:16] &gt;&gt; You can't work on the other side. This
[38:18] is the time to love.
[38:19] &gt;&gt; This is time to forgive.
[38:21] &gt;&gt; There's time to drop your odds.
[38:23] &gt;&gt; Here is where you do it.
[38:25] &gt;&gt; It's scary for me, you know, because I'm
[38:27] seeing brother Red came here and talk
[38:29] about debt doesn't change people. Baram
[38:31] said that.
[38:32] &gt;&gt; That is scary. You know I dealt with
[38:35] somebody with oats in their heart and
[38:36] when I went to them to talk to them
[38:37] about giving their life a stroke and
[38:39] everything they said why
[38:42] should I drop it
[38:44] I said I come back said expected to
[38:46] repent and everything else in Jesus name
[38:48] I said again 24 hours and I went back in
[38:50] 24 hours but then they said they ready
[38:52] to to let go so is it that somebody
[38:56] wicked and they go die that way wicked
[38:58] and
[38:59] &gt;&gt; death doesn't change you
[39:01] &gt;&gt; got to change now
[39:02] &gt;&gt; amen
[39:04] If you're mean, you're evil, you're
[39:06] wicked, you're jealous, whatever it is,
[39:07] you will die and you will go to hell
[39:09] with those things because heaven can't
[39:11] hold that.
[39:12] &gt;&gt; True.
[39:12] &gt;&gt; Do you understand that? This is serious
[39:14] enough. This with pastor oid, this have
[39:17] to do with God's requirement.
[39:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Say
[39:20] &gt;&gt; listen to this now. He said, "Lord,
[39:24] let us work, Lord, for we know we
[39:27] haven't much more time to work. We see
[39:29] time closing in. Soon we are looking for
[39:33] the angel that will set his foot on the
[39:35] land and the sea. Raise up his hand and
[39:38] swear by him the list forever and ever
[39:39] that time shall be no more. He said that
[39:41] time the mystery of God shall be
[39:43] finished. We understand now father that
[39:45] God's three-fold mystery has been made
[39:47] known to us. And we understand that we
[39:49] are looking now for those mysterious
[39:51] thunders that came out of heaven in the
[39:53] book of revelation that was seen the
[39:55] book that was sealed in the back of the
[39:56] book. Listen to this. Reveal to us, oh
[40:00] Lord, the things that we need for the
[40:03] battle ahead of us.
[40:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:06] &gt;&gt; Forgive our sins and our many neglectful
[40:09] things, our iniquity. We pray this
[40:12] afternoon that you'll do exceedingly
[40:14] abundantly above all that we could do or
[40:16] think.
[40:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother,
[40:19] &gt;&gt; I'll close with this. My brother, I'm
[40:21] going to pick you a song. Forgive me.
[40:23] Come on. Yet Abraham had a right to the
[40:26] promise.
[40:27] And the promise was his. Watch. He had a
[40:30] right to it. And the promise was his.
[40:33] I'll say to you, you have a right to it.
[40:36] &gt;&gt; And the promise is yours.
[40:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:38] &gt;&gt; Good. Could I hear amen?
[40:39] &gt;&gt; Or you're still in unbelief? Do you hear
[40:41] amen again?
[40:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:43] &gt;&gt; Right. Yet he had to fight
[40:46] &gt;&gt; to possess it.
[40:48] &gt;&gt; There you are, the believer today.
[40:52] Yet we are air to all things. Yet we are
[40:55] air to every spiritual blessing. every
[40:57] physical blessing. Wait, is that a
[41:00] physical blessing too?
[41:00] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[41:01] &gt;&gt; Yes. You don't have to accept sickness
[41:02] like sickness is a bonus.
[41:05] &gt;&gt; It's not an increase in pay with
[41:06] sickness. You don't have to accept sess
[41:07] at all.
[41:09] &gt;&gt; I reject that.
[41:11] &gt;&gt; I have a right to be whole.
[41:13] &gt;&gt; I have a right to be well.
[41:16] &gt;&gt; I don't care if I'm 90 and 90. I have a
[41:17] right to be that's my right.
[41:19] &gt;&gt; Satan have a right to inflict and do all
[41:21] what he have to do. That is his job. My
[41:23] job is to claim healing,
[41:24] &gt;&gt; claim deliverance, claim breakthrough.
[41:28] [Applause]
[41:30] &gt;&gt; So I have a right to every I'm an air to
[41:32] spiritual blessing, physical blessing.
[41:34] Here we go. Every blessing the Bible
[41:36] promises. Yet you have to fight every
[41:38] inch of it.
[41:40] &gt;&gt; Here we go. I hope this anchor tonight.
[41:42] That's the way God got it set up.
[41:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:46] &gt;&gt; So you are crying for it.
[41:49] You're crying. Crying tears. Long tears.
[41:52] Crying is not going to bring it. Faith,
[41:54] faith, walk, action, work. You have to
[41:56] press. You have to labor.
[41:58] &gt;&gt; All right. That's the way God is set up
[42:00] that way. You have to fight. Here we go.
[42:02] To possess what you know is your own.
[42:05] You have to fight to possess it. May the
[42:06] Lord bless you. Praise God. And Jason
[42:08] will come and sing a song and get will
[42:10] come and share something with us
[42:10] tonight.

[43:31] you are great.
[43:33] You do miracles so great.

[44:00] just give the Lord a hand of praise.
[44:03] [Applause]
[44:05] You love him tonight.
[44:07] My my my.
[44:10] Thank you, brother Jason. What an
[44:11] atmosphere we feel in here. You
[44:13] appreciate the pastor tonight.
[44:16] What words, what an inspiration, what an
[44:19] encouragement.
[44:21] Thank you, musicians.
[44:24] Oh my,
[44:26] &gt;&gt; what a mighty God we serve. Amen.
[44:29] &gt;&gt; I sat I sat to the side and I only
[44:31] smile. I say it seems like my notes will
[44:34] leak tonight
[44:37] for a title.
[44:40] My title is while you wait and in
[44:42] inspiration you have work to do. So we
[44:45] have to fight tonight.
[44:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:47] &gt;&gt; You have work to do is the inspiration
[44:50] and the title is while you wait.
[44:52] &gt;&gt; While we wait
[44:54] &gt;&gt; we have work to do.
[44:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:55] &gt;&gt; If you have your Bibles, I'd like you to
[44:58] open two short scriptures.
[45:02] Amen. One from the book of Habacok
[45:06] chapter 2:3
[45:09] and the other one from Psalms 105 verse1
[45:12] 17-19.
[45:27] Amen.
[45:31] Reading from the book of Habac
[45:36] chapter 2:3 and it says, "For the vision
[45:38] is yet for an appointed time,
[45:40] &gt;&gt; but at the end it shall speak
[45:43] &gt;&gt; and not lie, though it tar, wait for it,
[45:46] because it will surely come, it will not
[45:48] tarry." Amen.
[45:50] &gt;&gt; And in the book of Psalms reading
[45:51] chapter 105 from verse 17 to 19, it
[45:55] says, "He sent a man before them, even
[45:58] Joseph,
[46:00] who was sold for a servant, whose feet
[46:03] they hurt with fetterss. He was laid in
[46:05] iron until the time that his word came,
[46:09] the word of the Lord tried him."
[46:12] &gt;&gt; May we just bow our heads as we open in
[46:13] a word of prayer.
[46:15] Oh heavenly father, tonight we pause at
[46:18] this time, Lord, to give you praise, to
[46:20] give you thanks, to give you glory and
[46:21] honor, Lord. Lord, we appreciate this
[46:24] opportunity that we have to to delve
[46:26] into your scriptures, Lord. Lord, any
[46:28] man could read it. I pray that you would
[46:29] open it, Lord. Lord, these inspired
[46:32] words that you would inspire to our
[46:34] hearts, Lord. Open our understanding,
[46:35] Lord. Speak to your people. Take me out
[46:38] of the way, Lord. Lord, I pray that you
[46:39] would bring the message that you want
[46:41] brought tonight, Lord. Lord, I pray that
[46:43] no one will leave here the same way they
[46:45] came. Lord, I pray that those that may
[46:47] interact with this content even
[46:48] afterward, Lord, that the Holy Spirit
[46:50] will drop down wherever they are, Lord,
[46:52] and people will be healed, sealed,
[46:54] delivered, set free, Lord, they'll be
[46:56] inspired, Lord, uplifted, built up,
[46:59] Lord, that they could be drawn closer to
[47:01] you, Lord. Have your perfect will in
[47:03] this service, Lord. Lord, I pray that
[47:05] you would cover us with your love, your
[47:07] protection, your presence will fill
[47:09] upstairs, downstairs, Lord, wherever
[47:11] your your people might be tonight, Lord.
[47:13] Lord, I pray that you have your perfect
[47:15] work in Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen.
[47:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:19] &gt;&gt; You may have your seats at this time.
[47:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. You love him.
[47:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:23] &gt;&gt; Blessed be his holy name. So, we read
[47:25] the scriptures and you know the title.
[47:27] While we wait for an inspiration, you
[47:30] have work to do. So, we in a battle and
[47:32] we've got to fight. while we're waiting.
[47:35] No matter how long the wait is, we have
[47:37] to fight. We have to prepare. We have
[47:39] work to do. Amen.
[47:41] &gt;&gt; And speaking about Joseph
[47:43] and the scripture said
[47:46] his feet were hurt with fetterss. He was
[47:49] laid in iron until the time that his
[47:51] word came. Now, what's important to to
[47:53] see with Joseph is that Joseph was born
[47:56] with a purpose on his life.
[47:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:58] &gt;&gt; It took 30 years to manifest that
[48:00] purpose, but he was born with a purpose
[48:02] on his life. Amen.
[48:03] &gt;&gt; He had to wait 30 years going through
[48:05] tests, going through trials, going
[48:07] through criticism, having fights, h
[48:10] having all kind of things done to him.
[48:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:13] &gt;&gt; But it took him to the point where his
[48:16] purpose was fulfilled.
[48:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:17] &gt;&gt; In doing so, he had to be trained.
[48:20] &gt;&gt; He couldn't wake up, have a dream, and
[48:21] say, you know what? I'm going to rule.
[48:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[48:24] &gt;&gt; I am going to do this because I had a
[48:26] dream and I believe God sent this and
[48:28] this is the direction I should go. No,
[48:30] he had to be trained.
[48:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. He had to be trained and he he he
[48:33] had to get management training.
[48:35] &gt;&gt; He was sent to potty for his house and
[48:38] and and he was led to be leader of his
[48:40] household.
[48:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:42] &gt;&gt; He had to have that leadership quality
[48:44] because God was preparing him to lead
[48:48] &gt;&gt; in Egypt.
[48:49] &gt;&gt; But what his purpose was was really to
[48:51] preserve the life
[48:53] &gt;&gt; of his people.
[48:55] &gt;&gt; And he had to be trained and qualified
[48:57] and in a position that he could do so.
[48:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now along the way and this is
[49:02] where I'llident identify along the way
[49:06] as he waited to come into the fullness
[49:08] of his manifestation or the fullness of
[49:10] his purpose he had to have the right
[49:12] attitude.
[49:13] &gt;&gt; So perhaps at first when his brother
[49:15] sold him into slavery he he threw a pity
[49:17] party. Why me?
[49:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[49:19] &gt;&gt; Why me? Why is this the journey that you
[49:22] want to pass me through?
[49:24] &gt;&gt; He perhaps didn't know the answer. Why
[49:27] would he be the one to victimize him?
[49:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[49:30] &gt;&gt; Why they throw him into prison?
[49:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[49:33] &gt;&gt; Why Patifah's wife of all the people in
[49:35] the household, me, you accuse me, I in
[49:38] prison.
[49:39] &gt;&gt; But God had a purpose for him.
[49:42] &gt;&gt; And is often said, if you fail the test,
[49:43] the test will come again.
[49:45] &gt;&gt; So he chained and he thrown in in a
[49:47] ditch,
[49:49] fell for Satan. Guess what?
[49:52] &gt;&gt; It was coming again.
[49:54] when he testified to the bucklan baker,
[49:57] he wasn't redeemed and pulled out. You
[49:59] know,
[50:00] &gt;&gt; he was left there forsaken again because
[50:03] God knows he want Joseph to be in a
[50:05] perfect standing,
[50:07] &gt;&gt; a perfect position.
[50:09] &gt;&gt; The same way you say Abraham faith,
[50:12] Isaac love,
[50:13] &gt;&gt; jot grace and Joseph perfection. God
[50:16] wanted him to be perfected
[50:19] &gt;&gt; in his context so he could fulfill his
[50:21] purpose the way God wanted it. In doing
[50:24] so, God send test. He tests him with his
[50:27] family.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; His brothers,
[50:30] &gt;&gt; the people close to him.
[50:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[50:32] &gt;&gt; Throw him aside.
[50:33] &gt;&gt; They might have been jealous, might be
[50:35] envious. It didn't matter.
[50:38] &gt;&gt; That was the test that God set out for
[50:40] him
[50:40] &gt;&gt; because God knew he wanted him in that
[50:43] position. He wanted him to get that
[50:45] experience. So don't question your test
[50:47] tonight while you wait. God working on
[50:50] you. While you wait to come into your
[50:53] purpose, God will send test to build you
[50:56] and to build you up into that perfect
[50:58] position, that perfect individual that
[51:00] he want you to be.
[51:02] &gt;&gt; So he sent test after test.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; He tested his attitude. Can you imagine
[51:08] when the butler was restored, you say,
[51:11] "Boy, how ungrateful that fell is."
[51:14] Imagine I come and I tell him his
[51:16] future. I tell him what the vision meant
[51:19] &gt;&gt; and he forget me. Can you imagine if
[51:21] Joseph was was was Triny? Yes.
[51:23] &gt;&gt; Or now he's still in prison. But God
[51:26] needed the right attitude. Why? The
[51:28] right mental attitude
[51:30] &gt;&gt; to any divine promise of God will bring
[51:33] it to pass.
[51:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. So he had to walk with the right
[51:38] attitude. You know what? Perhaps my time
[51:40] is not yet.
[51:41] &gt;&gt; I just have to do what I have to do. My
[51:43] time hasn't come. But I have to operate
[51:45] a particular way. operate the way that
[51:47] God expects because only then he could
[51:50] bless you. If not, you go through the
[51:52] test again.
[51:53] &gt;&gt; Go through the test again because God
[51:55] wants perfection.
[51:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. So when it reached that point that
[52:00] God could use him, guess what? He moved
[52:02] from prison to power.
[52:04] &gt;&gt; When he's the prime minister, he could
[52:06] now fulfill his purpose in the position
[52:09] that God would have assigned at his
[52:12] birth
[52:13] &gt;&gt; after 30 years. During the wait he had
[52:16] to go through Patifa's wife and that
[52:18] scenario going into jail his brothers
[52:22] coming forgiving them when they came all
[52:26] kind of stuff he went through but it was
[52:28] worth it because he fulfilled the
[52:30] purpose that God had for his life.
[52:32] [Applause]
[52:34] &gt;&gt; If I switch gears to Abraham he's known
[52:36] as the father of faith. We could find
[52:38] him in Hebrews 11 as well. And when they
[52:42] talk about him, they say, "You know
[52:43] what? He staggered not through
[52:45] unbelief."
[52:47] &gt;&gt; Now, we know the story.
[52:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:49] &gt;&gt; Abraham was about 80 years old. And God
[52:52] said, "Listen, you'll be the father of
[52:53] many nations." As a matter of fact, he
[52:55] said, "I will return unto you according
[52:58] to the time of life."
[53:00] &gt;&gt; So, you know what he had to to do,
[53:01] right?
[53:02] &gt;&gt; He had to wait.
[53:03] &gt;&gt; He had to wait until God didn't say, "I
[53:06] returning in 9 months. I returning in
[53:09] two years." No. God say you have to wait
[53:12] until. But you know what? While you
[53:13] wait, you have things you have to do.
[53:16] &gt;&gt; While you wait, you have to testify.
[53:19] &gt;&gt; While you wait, you have to prepare
[53:21] yourself.
[53:22] &gt;&gt; Because listen, brother Brandham said,
[53:24] "The longer Abraham waited is actually
[53:27] the bigger the miracle.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; The longer you so or you thought you
[53:31] were go going through something, the
[53:34] longer you go through your test is the
[53:36] bigger the victory." You know
[53:38] &gt;&gt; the longer Abra after year one if it
[53:40] happened after one year that's brilliant
[53:43] &gt;&gt; glorious victorious but you could
[53:45] imagine in the 23rd year
[53:48] &gt;&gt; in the 23rd year imagine the same
[53:51] Abraham when you in your natural element
[53:54] at this time starting to doubt and say
[53:57] well I wonder if God really say he will
[54:00] use me boy I feel is really somebody
[54:04] probably is my cousin I hear it
[54:07] I wonder if is another interpretation. I
[54:10] wonder if the prophet meant this boy. I
[54:12] wonder if it really applies to this
[54:14] time. I wonder if the word is really
[54:17] what it's supposed to be or I need
[54:19] another doctrine to line up with my
[54:21] thoughts. No, he had to be steadfast
[54:25] &gt;&gt; and hold on to the promise of God
[54:27] because if he could stand on the word
[54:30] &gt;&gt; with faith
[54:31] &gt;&gt; if he could have the right attitude,
[54:33] &gt;&gt; if he could testify. So you know what?
[54:36] &gt;&gt; He was criticized.
[54:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; Based on his age,
[54:39] &gt;&gt; based on his wife,
[54:41] &gt;&gt; his wife laughed.
[54:42] &gt;&gt; She made it all kind of suggestions. She
[54:45] made suggestions. It had distractions.
[54:47] It had all kind of obstacles. But he
[54:49] overcame that and said, "Listen, I'm
[54:52] holding on to the promise still. I'm not
[54:54] moving from here. I'm being steadfast.
[54:57] I'm being fixed and focused because I
[55:00] believe he who made the promise is able
[55:03] to fulfill it in my life. It's not from
[55:05] a neighbor. It's not from a friend, but
[55:08] is mine. And every place I put my foot,
[55:12] I am going to possess it tonight." So
[55:14] healing is mine. Sealing is mine.
[55:17] Deliverance is mine. Adoption is mine.
[55:20] The Holy Ghost is mine. Because he
[55:23] promised it. And if he promises, and
[55:25] he's the same yesterday, today, and
[55:27] forever, nothing is going to shift me.
[55:30] Nothing is going to throw me off.
[55:32] Nothing is going to make me lose my
[55:34] focus. My faith is resting on that. I am
[55:37] standing on that because he promised
[55:40] that. And he want that for me.
[55:44] &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, you may be seated.
[55:46] When when you look at the story of Job,
[55:50] &gt;&gt; Job was taken out of his normal living.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; Job was a prosperous man.
[55:55] &gt;&gt; He was going through his natural
[55:57] journey.
[55:58] &gt;&gt; But God said, "Listen,
[56:00] &gt;&gt; have you considered my servant Job?
[56:02] &gt;&gt; Listen, I'm going to fast for forward a
[56:04] little bit.
[56:05] &gt;&gt; When Job waited
[56:07] &gt;&gt; for his change to come, he said, listen,
[56:09] though the skin worms destroy my body,
[56:12] &gt;&gt; I want to have a testimony. I want to
[56:15] vocalize it.
[56:16] &gt;&gt; This is not something just remaining in
[56:18] my heart
[56:19] &gt;&gt; and I'm holding on to it here. I want to
[56:21] let you know in my flesh I will see God.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; I want to let you know I'm aware of the
[56:27] distractions. My friends have their
[56:29] opinions. My good family have their
[56:32] ideas. Even my wife you speak kind of
[56:35] foolish there. Ma'am,
[56:36] &gt;&gt; I love you and know but you're talking
[56:38] foolishness, right? I'm not going to
[56:41] allow that distraction to throw me off.
[56:43] Amen.
[56:43] &gt;&gt; I am not going to lose my focus because
[56:46] I'm fixed on the promise of God that in
[56:48] my flesh I'm going to see him. No matter
[56:51] listen as David say if a thousand fall
[56:54] on one hand and 10,000 on the next hand
[56:57] I shall not be moved. I'm not going to
[56:59] shift away from the promise. I'm going
[57:01] to hold fast to faith and have a
[57:04] testimony no matter what comes my way.
[57:07] Listen, when we look at Mary, the angel
[57:11] visited Mary and say, "Mary, listen. You
[57:14] a special woman. You're highly favored.
[57:17] &gt;&gt; You are a virgin, but we have a special
[57:19] purpose for you.
[57:20] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit is going to overshadow
[57:23] you and you're going to have a son." And
[57:25] she said, "Be it done unto me
[57:27] &gt;&gt; according to your word."
[57:29] &gt;&gt; So, she accepts that this is her
[57:32] portion.
[57:33] &gt;&gt; But she too had work to do. You will
[57:35] observe every corrector I identify here.
[57:38] They had their own work to do. It wasn't
[57:40] your waiting and I sit down and hoping
[57:42] and praying that time pass.
[57:44] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[57:46] &gt;&gt; I sit down and I waiting on the rapture
[57:47] in a corner here that nothing will
[57:49] happen to me because I don't want
[57:51] nothing to happen because I waiting on
[57:54] No, no, no. You have something to do.
[57:56] You have work to do. You have something
[57:58] that's a requirement of God tonight. So
[58:01] Mary said, "Be it done unto me according
[58:04] to thy word." But you know what?
[58:06] &gt;&gt; She had a testimony in her heart.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; So she ran to Elizabeth
[58:10] &gt;&gt; and say, "Listen here. What I don't know
[58:13] about you, but I met an angel." And the
[58:14] angel say she testified because she was
[58:17] so convinced that that was the promise
[58:19] of God. She could testify about it.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; So let me ask you,
[58:23] &gt;&gt; you have promises tonight.
[58:25] &gt;&gt; Who you testifying to?
[58:27] &gt;&gt; Who you telling about it? How excited
[58:29] are you?
[58:30] &gt;&gt; How convinced are you that it's going to
[58:32] come to pass?
[58:34] &gt;&gt; She not just testified, she had the
[58:36] right attitude.
[58:38] &gt;&gt; So, she didn't sit down and say, "You
[58:40] know what? I'm going to the pharmacy to
[58:41] get two pregnancy test. I go buy three
[58:43] just in case cuz I'm not sure what the
[58:44] result will look like." No, she
[58:46] immediately
[58:48] &gt;&gt; because she believed the word she heard
[58:50] was the word of God.
[58:52] &gt;&gt; And if her faith stood on that word,
[58:55] nothing could stop it. Listen, it must
[58:58] come to pass. It must accomplish
[59:01] whatsoever it was sent out to
[59:03] accomplish. It will never return void.
[59:06] As a result, her faith could rest on
[59:09] that.
[59:09] &gt;&gt; So her work was have the right right
[59:12] attitude. When she talked to Joseph,
[59:14] when she talked to Elizabeth, anybody
[59:16] she spoke quick, she said, "Listen, the
[59:18] angel tell me
[59:19] &gt;&gt; this is the word of God.
[59:21] &gt;&gt; And I'm not too bothered by what you
[59:23] think about it. and not too bothered by
[59:25] your opinion. Everything else is a
[59:27] distraction. But I want to stand on
[59:29] faith knowing that he who promised this
[59:33] is able to fulfill it and the
[59:35] manifestation will be the
[59:37] interpretation. I don't need the doctor
[59:39] idea. I don't need to go by the
[59:41] gynecologist tonight to find out if I'm
[59:43] pregnant tonight. No, I believe his word
[59:46] is true.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; It never failed. It's the same
[59:49] yesterday, today, and forever. So I
[59:51] could rest on that knowing that this is
[59:54] my job at the time. Have the right
[59:55] attitude. Have faith believing that his
[59:59] word will come to pass.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; Listen, Paul and Silas, these fellas
[1:00:05] were preaching. They were moving through
[1:00:08] and they met a woman.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; The woman was possessed with a a time
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; and Paul cast the demon out. They say
[1:00:17] the demon left that hour.
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; The hour he left. Hallelujah.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; The profitability index went down
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; because she was earning money for her
[1:00:25] master
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; at that point. Guess what? They report
[1:00:28] them. They put them on Facebook,
[1:00:30] YouTube, Instagram, Tik Tok. They do
[1:00:32] videos about them
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; to the extent that they were arrested.
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; They were beaten. They were thrown into
[1:00:37] prison at the time.
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; But guess what? Even in prison,
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; while waiting to be released
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; while waiting, they start to work.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; The Bible records at midnight They pray,
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; they praise, they worship. It wasn't in
[1:00:54] their heart so soft that nobody could
[1:00:56] hear and boy are so embarrassed. If you
[1:00:59] know I make a little jail and all. No,
[1:01:00] no, no, no, no. Listen. The God I serve
[1:01:04] like like the three Hebrew boys. If they
[1:01:06] don't deliver us, we still bow. No. They
[1:01:09] start to sing.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; They start to worship. They start to
[1:01:13] praise. They start to pray because they
[1:01:16] knew the God they serve. And the God
[1:01:18] they serve is able to deliver them. So
[1:01:21] while in prison at midnight, they say
[1:01:23] they worship so much. They praise so
[1:01:26] much that an earthquake happened.
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; Read the scripture yourself.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; They were not loosed. You know,
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; you didn't see their band just come out
[1:01:35] and a handcuff come out and they were
[1:01:37] were in bondage. Here the Bible account
[1:01:40] is that all the prisoners
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; were set free. You know,
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; all of them became loose.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; All of them were let go. That praise and
[1:01:48] worship was so powerful. Their testimony
[1:01:52] was so powerful that it impacted the
[1:01:54] neighborhood. It impacted the prisoners.
[1:01:57] It impacted the people around them. So
[1:02:00] the same one who you think have an issue
[1:02:01] with with you when you start to praise
[1:02:04] and worship in your circumstance.
[1:02:06] Nothing is going to stop it. The power
[1:02:09] of God is going to move such that you
[1:02:12] can't even determine how far it goes.
[1:02:15] They may not have known the other
[1:02:16] prisoners in there, but just by virtue
[1:02:19] of the environment, the other prisoners
[1:02:21] were set free.
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; They said their bands were loosed, that
[1:02:25] is the reason the prison guards were so
[1:02:27] concerned
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; because the prison guards objective were
[1:02:30] to keep them in prison,
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; keep them bondage.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; So when they had this attitude that
[1:02:36] listen, nothing is going to stop the
[1:02:39] testimony,
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; nothing is going to stop the power of
[1:02:42] God. They were casting out devils and
[1:02:44] preaching in Jesus name. Right? So
[1:02:47] nothing was going to hinder them. They
[1:02:50] were very public and vocal knowing that
[1:02:53] God they serve is able to deliver them.
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; That is how they worked while they
[1:02:58] waited for God to deliver them.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; After that as you know when the prison
[1:03:03] guard was saved they let them go so they
[1:03:06] could continue to preach
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; preach the gospel
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; for the name of Jesus. Amen.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; Listen, Noah, we know the story.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; In Noah's case, it had never rained.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; The kind of faith required
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; to believe that something that never was
[1:03:24] done
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; is is spectacular.
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; Rain had never come on the earth before.
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; When God told Noah, now God didn't tell
[1:03:32] Noah's wife.
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; He didn't tell Noah's sons. And it's
[1:03:36] important. I was discussing this with
[1:03:38] somebody just recently. Noah's sons
[1:03:39] weren't little children. They themselves
[1:03:42] had wives.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; So, this wasn't, "You know what? Let me
[1:03:46] grab up my little boy or my little
[1:03:48] girl."
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; Noah was mature.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; He heard from God.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; And he was so convinced
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; that he started to testify to everybody.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; It will rain.
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; It will rain in the morning, in the noon
[1:04:04] time, in the evening. It didn't matter.
[1:04:06] convention after convention for 120
[1:04:09] years. He believed that rain was coming.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; It was going to rain. So he had a
[1:04:15] legitimate testimony without a sign.
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; He didn't have a a a a pastor or some
[1:04:21] deacon or elder musician, a disciple,
[1:04:23] you know, sometime rain will come. No,
[1:04:26] no, no, no, no, no, no. He just had pure
[1:04:28] unadulterated faith in the word of God
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; and the promise of God. So why he
[1:04:33] waiting on rain? He working.
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; He building. He preaching,
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; testifying. He had the attitude that
[1:04:40] listen, you never see rain. I never see
[1:04:42] rain. So you can't tell me any different
[1:04:44] from what I believe. I believe the
[1:04:46] promise of God. The promise of God is
[1:04:48] that it will rain.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; No matter what you think, what you say,
[1:04:52] what the meteorologist come and say,
[1:04:54] "Well, listen, Noah, we want to have a
[1:04:56] meeting. We want to have a a, you know,
[1:04:59] a general meeting so we could convince
[1:05:01] you that in the history of mankind,
[1:05:03] there was no rain before. So this is
[1:05:04] absurd.
[1:05:06] Hallelujah.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; Even if that was the case of the day,
[1:05:08] Noah wasn't taking that.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; Noah believed the promise of God.
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; And while he was waiting on rainy
[1:05:14] building,
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; so his testimony wasn't just a a verbal
[1:05:17] or vocal one.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; His testimony was live.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; He was listening to the instructions to
[1:05:23] the obedience of the promise and
[1:05:25] building to suit.
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; He was building the ark as directed by
[1:05:30] God.
[1:05:31] So anybody could see this man is not
[1:05:33] just talking the talk. He walking the
[1:05:35] talk. His action supporting it. His work
[1:05:38] supporting it because he believe and
[1:05:40] he's so convinced that he's putting it
[1:05:42] into action. He's putting in the work
[1:05:44] now because he knows he who made the
[1:05:47] promise is able to come and perform it.
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; And we know the end of the story. He had
[1:05:53] and women
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; they had choices
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; to go through that window and escape
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; because daddy this kind of oldfashioned
[1:06:02] oldtime Holy Ghost fililled revival this
[1:06:06] kind of fanatical shouting kind of
[1:06:08] thing. I don't really think this is
[1:06:10] applicable now because the new thing is
[1:06:13] to sit down and relax a little bit. The
[1:06:15] new thing is to stay home and stream.
[1:06:17] No. At the end of the day, Noah had such
[1:06:20] a testimony, such an attitude. He had
[1:06:23] such love for his family that even if
[1:06:26] they tried, he loved them so much that
[1:06:29] he will prevent them from doing so
[1:06:30] because he wanted what's best for them
[1:06:33] like any father should. So no matter
[1:06:35] what the test was, he was determined to
[1:06:38] work not just selfishly for himself, but
[1:06:41] for the well-being and and and the
[1:06:43] prolonged life of his family.
[1:06:47] That is how we ought to be as brothers
[1:06:48] and sisters. Caring one for each other.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; Caring for your sons and your daughters
[1:06:53] enough. Not to force them, but pray for
[1:06:56] them. Not to force them, but to have a
[1:06:58] burden for them. To see them delivered.
[1:07:01] To see them set free. To see them have
[1:07:03] their own experience with the baptism of
[1:07:06] the Holy Ghost. We should have such a
[1:07:08] burden, such a desire knowing that God
[1:07:11] promised it. And he who made the promise
[1:07:15] is able to fulfill it.
[1:07:19] [Applause]
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; In Moses time,
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; God told Moses, he gave him a
[1:07:31] commission. He said, "Listen, I want you
[1:07:33] to go to Egypt because I've heard the
[1:07:35] cries of my people.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; I have heard their distress. I have
[1:07:39] heard the way they operate under the
[1:07:41] taskmaster's whip and I want you to
[1:07:43] bring them out from Egypt. Not to just
[1:07:46] leave them in the middle of nowhere. I
[1:07:48] want you to bring them to this mountain
[1:07:49] here so they could worship.
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; That is what I want.
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; I don't want them come on a joy ride. I
[1:07:56] want them to leave the position they are
[1:07:57] in now to come to a certain mountain to
[1:08:00] a certain place to worship because God
[1:08:04] desires worship. He desires praise. So
[1:08:07] there's always something for you to do.
[1:08:10] There's always something required of us.
[1:08:12] There is always more that we could do.
[1:08:15] So when he gave Moses the instruction,
[1:08:17] listen. He said, "I have seen their
[1:08:19] affliction.
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; So it's not in vain. So he heard your
[1:08:22] cry. He know you want your family
[1:08:25] restored. He know you want a
[1:08:27] breakthrough. He hears. He sees. They
[1:08:30] say, listen, the prayer
[1:08:33] of the righteous avail much.
[1:08:38] He listening. He know the sincere cry.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; He know the burden you have.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; It's in the word. He say, "I've heard
[1:08:46] the cries."
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; Are you crying tonight?
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; Are you burdened tonight?
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; What work you're putting in?
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; You want the result, but what work you
[1:08:56] willing to put in?
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; War is at hand. You're getting ready to
[1:09:00] to fight a battle, but what you're
[1:09:02] putting in, you have to have the right
[1:09:05] attitude. You have to have the right
[1:09:07] mental capacity to know. Listen, healing
[1:09:10] is mine tonight. Listen, not one will be
[1:09:13] left behind. Because when he told Moses,
[1:09:16] "Bring them out." He didn't say, "Bring
[1:09:18] out some." He said, "Bring out my
[1:09:20] people. Bring everybody. Bring the
[1:09:22] animals. Bring it." Listen, the good
[1:09:24] anything you have, anything you love,
[1:09:27] anything that love you associated with
[1:09:30] you, bring it. Bring them to him in
[1:09:32] prayer. Take them to the Lord in prayer.
[1:09:35] Pray for their deliverance. Pray for
[1:09:37] their salvation tonight. Pray for them
[1:09:39] to be set free tonight, knowing that he
[1:09:43] who made the promise is able to deliver
[1:09:46] them tonight.
[1:09:48] [Music]
[1:09:52] [Applause]
[1:09:53] [Music]
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; Moses
[1:09:56] had work to do. While he waited to bring
[1:09:59] them out, he had to be trained. while he
[1:10:03] waited to bring them out, he had to have
[1:10:05] the right attitude.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; No matter what distractions it had,
[1:10:09] Dayton, Koran, whoever else had their
[1:10:12] own thoughts and ideas. Those were just
[1:10:14] distractions. That was not to stop him
[1:10:17] from the promise of God.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; The promise of God was listen, take them
[1:10:22] out from here, bring them over here, and
[1:10:25] don't worry about it. I will take care
[1:10:27] of them. Moses should not have been
[1:10:29] surprised when he saw mountains on both
[1:10:32] sides. He should not have been surprised
[1:10:35] when he saw Pharaoh behind them because
[1:10:37] the promise was bring them from Egypt to
[1:10:40] this mountain to worship and God will
[1:10:43] see you through. I want to tell you God
[1:10:45] will see you through tonight. No matter
[1:10:48] what you've gone through in the past, he
[1:10:50] going to see you through.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; Till the promised land,
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; till perfection,
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; till adoption,
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; till every promise is manifested in your
[1:11:00] life,
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; he is going to see you through
[1:11:04] [Applause]
[1:11:06] [Music]
[1:11:06] [Applause]
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; the 10 virgins. Thank you, Jesus.
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; We know the story.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; Five were wise.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Five were foolish.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; Their mission was to wait on the
[1:11:21] bridegroom.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; They had to wait.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; But you know what? While they waiting,
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; they had something to do.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; Just like you tonight.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; While you waiting on your healing,
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; while you're waiting on your
[1:11:34] deliverance, while you're waiting on
[1:11:36] your children, while you're waiting on
[1:11:38] your condition to change, you have
[1:11:40] something to do.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; So the 10 virgins,
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; they had something to do. Hallelujah.
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; They had two things actually.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; One thing they had to do was wait.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; The next thing they had to do was be
[1:11:53] ready.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; To be ready required that they had their
[1:11:57] lamps filled with oil.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; So waiting is one thing.
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; It come like you're doing a test.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; When you enter the room, you get a mark
[1:12:06] for attendance.
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; But you fail if you don't know the
[1:12:09] content to put on the paper.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; So you could wait all night. If when
[1:12:14] they come you don't have the
[1:12:15] requirements your car pass.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; Imagine you're taking a trip. You at the
[1:12:20] airport 6 hours before.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; You're waiting.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; But when it's time to board, you do have
[1:12:26] a boarding pass.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter if you waited 6 hours
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; or if you was there the day before or if
[1:12:32] you came 5 minutes before. The
[1:12:33] requirement at that time is your
[1:12:36] boarding pass.
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; They want your boarding pass to grant
[1:12:39] you access. So you have something to do.
[1:12:42] Whatever you do, secure your boarding
[1:12:45] pass. Secure your ticket because that's
[1:12:48] the thing to get you out of here. Secure
[1:12:50] the Holy Ghost because that's the thing
[1:12:53] to get you out of here. You could sing
[1:12:55] specials. You could be a deacon. You
[1:12:58] could do what you want. If you don't
[1:13:00] have the requirements, you're going
[1:13:02] nowhere.
[1:13:03] You're not going anywhere.
[1:13:05] [Music]
[1:13:05] [Applause]
[1:13:08] So these virgins now we know the story.
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; A cry went out.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; They say behold the bridegroom cometh.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; The bridegroom wasn't there as yet
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; because they all took a rest.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; They all slumbered and slept. They all
[1:13:23] waited. They all were faithful. They all
[1:13:26] were virgins. They all had lamps.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; But you know what?
[1:13:31] When the critical time came,
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; when the thing that mattered,
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; that's right,
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; was at hand.
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; Half of them had no oil.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; Half had no oil.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; No oil.
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; So you come to clip your wick. You come
[1:13:48] to to to present present a nice facade,
[1:13:52] but you don't have the requirement.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; They had no choice at that point.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; No choice. It's not a brotherly kindness
[1:13:59] affair at that point. It's do you have
[1:14:01] it or do you not have it?
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; Yes or no. It's binary. Zero or one. You
[1:14:06] have it yes or you don't have it. No.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; That's the only thing. It's not what
[1:14:10] church you went to or if yours was early
[1:14:12] or just here on a Wednesday night. It's
[1:14:14] either you have the requirements or you
[1:14:16] don't have the requirements. Simple.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; Everybody can understand that.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; So the wise virgins
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; yes
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; had not just
[1:14:28] the ability to wait
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; the requirements.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; Now I want to strike something quickly.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; We're familiar with the upper room
[1:14:37] experience.
[1:14:38] And it's interesting in the book of Luke
[1:14:42] that Jesus told the disciples and those
[1:14:45] around him. He say listen I love all of
[1:14:47] you but I want you to tar
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; amen. in the city of Jerusalem.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; Essentially, I want you to wait.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; I sending you to wait.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; I'm calling you to wait. I'm not telling
[1:14:59] you when,
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; but I want to assure you the comforter
[1:15:02] will come.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; I want to make a commitment to a promise
[1:15:05] to you that the comforter will come
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; and meet you there.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; Now, that is what I call the large
[1:15:12] print.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; Everybody heard that?
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; Everybody heard to wait.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to release the fine print
[1:15:19] tonight.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; When you say go and tar, what may not
[1:15:25] have been explicitly clear is that
[1:15:27] listen, I want to give you a little time
[1:15:29] to sort out yourself.
[1:15:32] I want you to praise and worship. I want
[1:15:34] you to have the right attitude. I want
[1:15:35] you to forgive. I want you to love. I
[1:15:38] want you to share with your brother and
[1:15:39] sister. I I want you to get rid of that
[1:15:41] pride. I want you to sort out your ego.
[1:15:44] I want you to sort out your position and
[1:15:47] who folks see you as and who you think
[1:15:50] you are. I want you to sort out all that
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; because the comforter is going to fall
[1:15:56] on perfection.
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; That is the fine print.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; So t
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; don't mean to just sit down in the
[1:16:05] corner and say well Jesus say sit down
[1:16:06] in Jerusalem so I cool. No he want you
[1:16:10] and do something.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; You have work to do. There is something
[1:16:14] required of us
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; to sort out ourselves. To clean out our
[1:16:19] lives,
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; to clean up our hearts,
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; to clean up our attitude, to come in the
[1:16:24] right mindset, to come listen with a
[1:16:27] praise on your lips,
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; worshiping God because he's good because
[1:16:32] he's good.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; Because you know he's going to do
[1:16:36] abundantly,
[1:16:38] exceedingly above all you could ask or
[1:16:41] think. So it doesn't matter how you feel
[1:16:43] tonight. It doesn't matter what you went
[1:16:45] through last night or on work today. He
[1:16:49] sent you to tar for a purpose and that
[1:16:53] purpose will be accomplished.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; Hear what the scripture said.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; He said in the book of Acts, he said
[1:17:00] when the day of Pentecost was fully come
[1:17:02] fully come
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; that was the time. That was the critical
[1:17:06] time. So it didn't matter if you was
[1:17:08] there the Sunday before, you know.
[1:17:11] All right.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; You might have been there every day, you
[1:17:13] know, but you decide by you see me I
[1:17:15] tired. I taking a day off. When the day
[1:17:18] of Pentecost will fully come.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; Here what it says. They were all in one
[1:17:23] accord in one place.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; You know what I understand by that? If
[1:17:27] you and I in one accord and we agree and
[1:17:31] we are convinced about the same thing,
[1:17:33] listen, miracles could happen
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; because at that point it's one faith,
[1:17:39] one Lord, one baptism. It's not my idea
[1:17:42] and I have a bigger revelation than you
[1:17:44] and you don't recognize who I am and how
[1:17:47] long I've been here and and and listen,
[1:17:49] I have a position and you don't know. is
[1:17:52] one mind, one accord, one faith, one
[1:17:56] Lord, one baptism at that point. So you
[1:17:59] know what? When the day of Pentecost
[1:18:01] fully come and you realize he don't have
[1:18:03] ego to deal with, he don't have pride to
[1:18:06] deal with anymore. He don't have to give
[1:18:08] you the brotherly kindness test because
[1:18:10] you could forgive. He could now come and
[1:18:12] everybody could be filled.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; Everybody could receive their portion
[1:18:17] because everybody sought the same
[1:18:19] perfection. Everybody sought to to clean
[1:18:22] up their lives and sort out themselves.
[1:18:25] [Applause]
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; You see, I read in Ephesians 4.
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; He sent a five-fold ministry.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; And we know it. Apostles, prophets,
[1:18:35] evangelists, pastors, teachers. But why?
[1:18:38] For the
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; perfecting of the saints.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; For the work of the ministry, for the
[1:18:43] edifying of the body of Christ.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; So, it's not to just be there lingering
[1:18:48] eternally, you know. is for you to
[1:18:50] become perfect. That is why we come to
[1:18:52] church. That is why we read the word.
[1:18:55] That is why we subscribe to the message
[1:18:57] because we know we are imperfect as we
[1:18:59] stand.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; But we want to be more like Christ.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; We want to be drawn closer to him.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; So he sent these ministries to be able
[1:19:08] to perfect us
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; to draw us closer
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; for the for the perfecting of the
[1:19:14] saints.
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; Not the perfecting of just you. for all
[1:19:17] of us
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; for the saints everywhere
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; to be perfect. So why why you think that
[1:19:24] is so he want to perfect the saints.
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; It sound very much like going into the
[1:19:29] upper room.
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; It mean you need to sort out yourself.
[1:19:32] It's not my church versus your your
[1:19:34] church. It's not my doctrine versus
[1:19:36] yours. It's not my revelation versus
[1:19:38] yours. It's not my idea or my belief
[1:19:39] versus yours.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; For the perfecting of the saints. So it
[1:19:43] means he has a requirement like Joseph
[1:19:45] for us to be perfect. He want to be able
[1:19:49] to look and say, "Hey, this is my
[1:19:51] beloved son here." You know,
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; watch him. He just like me. He could
[1:19:55] sign the check. He operates the way I
[1:19:57] operate. I don't have to second guess
[1:19:59] and question because he is a chip off
[1:20:02] the whole block.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; He and I listen that is almost the same
[1:20:05] you're looking at. That is my
[1:20:07] representative man and woman who are
[1:20:10] king. Listen, Jesus Christ on two feet
[1:20:13] again. That is what you're looking for.
[1:20:15] So he sent the five-fold ministry to do
[1:20:18] just that.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; Listen, I can't help but think,
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; hallelujah,
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; brother Brandham would say, he say
[1:20:24] sometimes he'll go in the woods to pray
[1:20:26] and no matter how difficult it comes as
[1:20:29] he pray and he's seeking the will of
[1:20:31] God. He said that's the time when the
[1:20:34] briars will scratch him, the birds
[1:20:37] interfering with him, the mosquitoes
[1:20:40] coming to bite him. He say listen that
[1:20:42] is when he saw the breakthrough coming.
[1:20:45] That is the time to be certain of God.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; That is the time to be sure beyond a
[1:20:52] reasonable doubt that it's about to
[1:20:54] happen.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, they say the
[1:20:56] darkest hour is before the break of day.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; Just before the sun comes out and shines
[1:21:03] is the darkest hour of the night.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; So you tell me you've been going through
[1:21:07] a rough time.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; You say you have had it hard for a long
[1:21:11] time. Well, guess what? Keep fighting
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; because the fact that you're going
[1:21:16] through the trials now mean listen
[1:21:19] victory is just ahead. You know victory
[1:21:21] is right is the next corner. This is not
[1:21:24] the time to give up. This is not the
[1:21:26] time to slow down. Like Abraham 20 years
[1:21:31] 21 22 23. The longer it go the greater
[1:21:36] the victory, the greater the sacrifice,
[1:21:39] the greater the success. So don't
[1:21:41] despair now. This is not the time to
[1:21:44] lose your cool and why I waiting this
[1:21:46] long. You know how long I see this one
[1:21:48] get healed. You know how long I see this
[1:21:50] one get the victory. And I see this one
[1:21:52] get a breakthrough. Listen. Your time
[1:21:54] coming.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; Your time coming. But you go through
[1:21:58] different tests. Some through the water,
[1:22:01] some through the fire. All through the
[1:22:03] blood tonight. So it doesn't matter. You
[1:22:06] have to have the right attitude. You
[1:22:07] have to have the right approach. You
[1:22:09] have to testify. You have to walk
[1:22:12] knowing, believing, in faith that he is
[1:22:15] going to see you through.
[1:22:17] [Applause]
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; You see, he wants a perfect bride.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; He listen, it's not a rag tag team
[1:22:25] you're trying to put put together. You
[1:22:26] know,
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; listen, when he chose disciples, Jesus
[1:22:30] called Peter, come. James, Andrew, John,
[1:22:35] here what? Will you come? But when he
[1:22:38] got them together, he didn't leave them
[1:22:39] the way they were. You know,
[1:22:41] he wor three and a half years. They
[1:22:44] walking with him. They came with
[1:22:46] different skill sets, different
[1:22:48] mindsets, different strengths, different
[1:22:50] weaknesses. And he had to deal with them
[1:22:52] all.
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; Different attitudes, different
[1:22:55] backgrounds
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; and he had to deal with them all. So you
[1:22:58] feel God don't understand you.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; He don't know what he doing. He don't
[1:23:03] see you different from your brother. He
[1:23:05] don't understand that the trial he give
[1:23:07] you is customized to you because he know
[1:23:09] the challenges he have with you. He know
[1:23:12] what he have to break off for you is not
[1:23:13] what you have to break off of somebody
[1:23:14] else.
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; And that was the challenge he had with
[1:23:16] the disciples. But guess what? He didn't
[1:23:19] come for bride material.
[1:23:22] Material is material. He come for the
[1:23:23] bride.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; He didn't come for a church or no. He
[1:23:27] come for you.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; But he can't take you as you are.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; He can't take you the way you are and
[1:23:32] leave you the way you are. Come on.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; He want to make you fit his mold. You
[1:23:37] see that mold there?
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; He want you fit that.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; So he want you add to your faith virtue
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; and knowledge and temperance, patience,
[1:23:46] godliness, brotherly kindness. So
[1:23:48] charity could drop down. Listen, on
[1:23:50] perfection,
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; not you with your arts and you with your
[1:23:54] greed and you with your jealousy and
[1:23:56] envy. No, it wouldn't work.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; The dove can't land on that. The dove
[1:24:01] could only land on the lamb.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; They could only land on perfection.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; And he is determined that he would have
[1:24:09] a bride like Eve. He determined that in
[1:24:12] this end time, in this evil age, he
[1:24:15] coming for a bride that call out, that's
[1:24:17] perfect, that could hold on to his
[1:24:19] promises, that knows his word, and could
[1:24:22] stand on it and beat the devil anytime,
[1:24:25] anywhere, under any condition.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:29] The music musicians could get get ready.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; As we wind down,
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; I just want to read one more quote as we
[1:24:36] close
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; in a message be certain of God.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; Paragraph 45.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; Here's what he says. He said, "Wait."
[1:24:43] When you met his requirement,
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; that brings your faith to a showdown.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; So, you're not just waiting. When you
[1:24:51] met his requirement, sir,
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; you still had to go through the test.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; There's a showdown. It's like you're in
[1:24:57] school. Listen, you might be in form one
[1:24:59] or form five. It doesn't matter. There's
[1:25:01] a test sometime coming. You know it
[1:25:03] coming. You may not know the date
[1:25:04] exactly, but you know the test is coming
[1:25:07] at some point. So, you have work to do
[1:25:10] during the period. What you have to do
[1:25:11] is go to class, read the books, learn
[1:25:15] what you need to learn because you know
[1:25:16] when the test comes, you want to pass
[1:25:18] the test.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; If you don't pass the test, guess what?
[1:25:21] You need to repeat
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; and do it again.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; Different test, customized test, same
[1:25:27] test. It doesn't matter. You have to go
[1:25:28] through the test again.
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; That is the way it works. So think about
[1:25:32] it. You have the books and tapes.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; You have the Bible.
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; You have the promises.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; You have the messages. You have the
[1:25:40] sermons. The test coming. I can't tell
[1:25:43] you the date. I don't know it.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, nobody knows the
[1:25:47] date.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; Nobody knows the hour, but the test
[1:25:49] coming still. And here he said, "Wait,
[1:25:52] when you met his requirement, that
[1:25:54] brings your faith to a showdown."
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you have met God's requirement,
[1:25:58] if the requirement has been made and you
[1:26:01] have fully considered it and you have
[1:26:03] done everything that God required you to
[1:26:05] do, then your faith rest right there
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; that he is be certain of God. You know,
[1:26:11] he loves to test us.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; He loves to see the reaction of your
[1:26:15] faith.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; This is why you have to put in the work.
[1:26:17] The test coming,
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; ready or not, the test coming,
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; war coming, the battle coming, the fight
[1:26:24] coming, ready or not. So you have to
[1:26:27] make sure your faith is in order
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; because he loves to test us. And he
[1:26:31] loves to see the reaction of your faith.
[1:26:34] Did you know that God likes to see how
[1:26:36] you react when you say, "Oh Lord, I
[1:26:38] believe you. Thou art my savior. I
[1:26:40] believe you are the healer. I believe
[1:26:42] you are the one who gives the Holy
[1:26:44] Spirit. and the things that I am
[1:26:46] requiring, you are the God who gives
[1:26:48] that. And then when you confess all your
[1:26:50] sins and promise God that you'll do if
[1:26:53] he let you get well and then because it
[1:26:55] don't happen, you run like a coward
[1:26:56] somewhere.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; When you don't see it happen fast
[1:27:00] enough,
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; when you don't see the result you want
[1:27:03] tomorrow,
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; you run like a coward. Oh gosh, I wonder
[1:27:06] if this thing right boy because I
[1:27:08] holding on for three days.
[1:27:13] He say he like to to test you know. So
[1:27:16] so what is that next week? Where's that
[1:27:18] next month?
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; What is that next year?
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; This is listen this is the word of
[1:27:23] reading. You know
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; this is the words of the prophet. I'm
[1:27:25] not making it up.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; He said listen you'll run off like a
[1:27:29] coward somewhere. God can't use that.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; There's no way for him to use you.
[1:27:34] There's no way for him to answer you
[1:27:35] because he only answers by faith.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; Then all of a sudden you go away and he
[1:27:40] can't answer. But real true faith stands
[1:27:43] there.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; Go play something softly. Being sure
[1:27:46] that God is be certain that he is. And
[1:27:50] if God asked this thing to be done to
[1:27:53] confess your sins and so forth and
[1:27:54] you've done it, faith says that he is.
[1:27:57] It's certain that it's going to happen.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; So the same promise you believe. No
[1:28:02] matter what happens, it's going to
[1:28:04] happen because he promised it. I didn't
[1:28:07] make the promise to you. The pastor
[1:28:09] didn't make the promise to you. God made
[1:28:11] a promise. So he is going to fulfill it.
[1:28:14] Amen.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; It says it's certain that it's going to
[1:28:18] happen. Your request has to be granted.
[1:28:21] It's not optional at that stage. It has
[1:28:23] to be granted. Your loved ones have to
[1:28:26] be saved.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; Your sons and daughters have to be
[1:28:29] delivered.
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; It has to be granted once you have the
[1:28:33] faith and you met his requirements. He
[1:28:35] said if you are sure of God, God is sure
[1:28:38] of his word. He's only waiting to test
[1:28:41] you. God bless you.
[1:28:46] [Music]
