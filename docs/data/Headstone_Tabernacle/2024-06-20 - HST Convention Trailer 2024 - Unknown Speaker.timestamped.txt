[0:25] Christ that we henceforth be no more
[0:27] children tossed to and fro and carried
[0:30] about with every wind of Doctrine by the
[0:32] slight of men and cunning craftiness
[0:35] whereby they lie and wait to deceive but
[0:38] speaking the truth in love may grow up
[0:40] into him in all things which is the head
[0:44] even Christ from whom the whole body
[0:46] fitly joined together and compacted by
[0:49] that which every joint supplieth
[0:51] according to the effectual working in
[0:52] the measure of every part maketh
[0:54] increase of the body unto the edifying
[0:57] of itself in love
[1:00] in his
[1:01] army he presents his Army and the farm
[1:05] of five
[1:07] officers first apostles prophets
[1:11] teachers pastors evangelist that's his
[1:15] army that's his soldiers that's his
[1:17] commanding officers all with the baptism
[1:20] of the Holy Ghost waiting out there to

[1:38] the
[1:40] inem that's the Army
[1:43] vindicating vindicating what his

[1:50] for as many as are led by the spirit of
[1:52] God they are the sons of
[1:55] God they shall run like Mighty Men they
[1:58] shall climb the wall like Men of War and
[2:00] they shall March everyone on his ways
[2:02] and they shall not break their ranks
[2:03] neither shall one thrust another they
[2:05] shall walk everyone in his path and when
[2:07] they fall upon the sword they shall not
[2:09] be wounded do you imagine Peter James
[2:12] and John going before
[2:14] the remember that 120 up there couldn't
[2:17] even sign their own names before I see
[2:20] if they if all of their if their reflex
[2:23] was just right and so forth they had a
[2:25] reflex but it wasn't the intellectual
[2:27] conception or scientific research it
[2:29] would do the power of God when it's
[2:31] stuck them they know nothing to do but
[2:33] act out what the Holy Ghost said do they
[2:36] didn't pay attention to any intellectual
[2:37] what the church said and what the priest
[2:39] said and what this said that said they
[2:40] move by the spirit Fearless
[2:44] man usually ministers when they get into
[2:47] the
[2:48] pulpit they begin to think if I speak on
[2:52] a certain certain
[2:54] thing here is a certain member of my
[2:57] church that's a a good
[3:00] pay in this church they'll leave the
[3:04] church and then you go to looking at the
[3:07] flesh
[3:08] again then God can't lead that
[3:12] Minister you've got to say what the
[3:15] spirit says the same then we are led by
[3:20] the spirit of God
[3:29] oh
