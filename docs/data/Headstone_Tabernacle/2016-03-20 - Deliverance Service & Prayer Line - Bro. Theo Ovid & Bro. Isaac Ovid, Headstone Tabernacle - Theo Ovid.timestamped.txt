[15:46] to be in his presence.

[16:22] and God mercy come to open our eyes and
[16:26] and the grace of God we are where we are
[16:29] what we are how we are things might be
[16:33] bad but could have been worse so we are
[16:36] grateful hallelujah we doesn't have all
[16:38] what we want but he give us what we need

[16:48] this morning. We we we appreciate him
[16:51] this morning. We want to say, Lord, we
[16:53] appreciate you for your goodness, for
[16:55] your grace, for your mercy. You didn't
[16:57] have to wake us up this morning. You
[16:59] didn't have to bring us out this day,
[17:01] but but you did. Hallelujah. Glory.
[17:04] Hallelujah. You give us a roof over our
[17:06] head, a bed to sleep on. You put food on
[17:09] our table. We are grateful this morning.
[17:12] How many want to give God thanks and
[17:14] praise for his goodness and his mercy?
[17:17] You may be seated. Praise God.
[17:21] Hallelujah. Your wife may not be the
[17:23] best coconut country, but she's the lady
[17:25] of your life. Oh, hallelujah. We thank
[17:28] God for your wife. Your husband might
[17:30] the best man to clean around the yard,
[17:32] but he is the man in your life. Thank
[17:34] God for your husband. Thank God for your
[17:36] children. Thank God for your mother,
[17:38] father, brother, whoever wrong you. We
[17:40] are grateful. Praise God. We have one
[17:42] life to live. Oh, glory to God. This is
[17:45] the life God give us. We have one life
[17:48] to live and God put in our heart to
[17:50] praise him and to worship him. Oh, glory
[17:54] to God. And the beautiful thing about
[17:56] praising and worshiping God, God doesn't
[17:59] have to do anything for you, for you to
[18:01] worship him. He just deserves worship.
[18:03] He just deserves honor. He just deserves
[18:05] glory. Whether he heal you or he don't
[18:07] heal you, he still deserves honor. He
[18:09] still deserve praise. Whether you get a
[18:10] new job or you get a raise of pay, he
[18:12] still deserve honor. He still deserve
[18:14] praise. Whether he touch your body,
[18:16] touch your soul, he still deserve honor.
[18:19] He still from eternity to eternity, we
[18:22] be praising him. We have one life to
[18:24] live. And we want to live that life for
[18:26] his honor and his glory. It doesn't make
[18:29] no sense living for the devil. It
[18:31] doesn't make no sense working for the
[18:32] devil because the wages of sin is still
[18:34] there. But the gift of God is still
[18:37] eternal life. There is eternal life in
[18:40] Christ Jesus. You making me feel
[18:42] religious this morning. You're making me
[18:44] feel oldfashioned. Praise God. Sin
[18:47] killing, demon chasing. Oh, hallelujah.
[18:50] Heaven raising glorious gospel of the
[18:54] kingdom. Oh,
[18:56] hallelujah. Praise God. To the world, we
[19:00] preach foolishness. But to you that are
[19:02] saved, it's the power of God. It's the
[19:05] cross of Jesus Christ.
[19:11] Oh,
[19:12] hallelujah. Thank God I'm
[19:15] saved. Thank God for his
[19:18] salvation. Oh,
[19:20] hallelujah. Oh, glory to God. Amen.
[19:23] Amen.
[19:24] Amen. Oh, praise God. Oh, God has
[19:27] blessed our life and God has blessed my
[19:29] life, blessed my family, blessed the
[19:32] church. Oh, praise God. Hallelujah. I
[19:35] want to thank God for you, the church.
[19:37] standing with me. Oh, you're standing
[19:39] with this ministry. I want to bless you
[19:41] this morning and say thank you. Thank
[19:44] you so much. Thank you for your prayer,
[19:45] your support. Praise God. When all hell
[19:48] was against this ministry and the church
[19:51] and my family, you stood with me. God
[19:54] bless you. You didn't stand in vain.
[19:57] Hallelujah. Your faith was not in vain.
[20:00] Oh, glory.
[20:03] Hallelujah. Amen. You may be seated.
[20:07] certainly love and appreciate you. Amen.
[20:12] And what I've been preaching for the
[20:13] past years has been my core belief like
[20:17] core in terms of this is my inner being.
[20:21] Sovereignity of the local church, the
[20:22] freedom of the spirit, the holy ghost,
[20:24] certain things are just in resonate in
[20:27] my system, not the system of man and the
[20:30] power of of bishop and and and mother
[20:33] church and whatn not. All these things
[20:34] that's not part of my system. I have
[20:36] always been a feel that the saints
[20:39] should have that liberty of God. I see
[20:42] legalism over the years trying to
[20:43] conform people and pong them and push
[20:45] them and run with it. But there is
[20:47] nothing when the love of God take your
[20:49] heart and you understand the grace and
[20:52] the mercy and the opportunity that God
[20:54] has given you. Some people take it for
[20:56] granted. They're just carefree with it.
[20:58] But I can't be. Every day I'm grateful.
[21:01] Every day I'm thankful because he
[21:03] doesn't have to give me another day.
[21:04] Just think about Just think about it
[21:06] now. Many people not going to even reach
[21:08] your age, but God give you another day,
[21:11] another year, another time, another
[21:13] season. Praise. I didn't come to say all
[21:15] of that this morning, but such an
[21:16] atmosphere as I don't want to leave, but
[21:18] we leaving today coast. So, you got to
[21:21] pray for us as can I. But we have
[21:23] service on Easter uh Easter morning 8:00
[21:27] and Easter Friday 5:00. So, be there.
[21:30] give support and God going to bless you
[21:32] tremendously. Do remember us in prayer
[21:35] for every coast and also in April when I
[21:37] get back have some meetings in Kentucky
[21:39] uh two churches have some services there
[21:41] also remember us in prayer. So in a
[21:43] great uh great uh expectation for God
[21:46] and God has given me real strength. I
[21:49] know it is strength of the Lord. God
[21:51] have touched my kidneys, touched my
[21:53] body. I can do what I've done for the
[21:56] past 2 years that God didn't help me
[21:59] physically. So I am very very grateful
[22:02] to God. There was such a great need and
[22:05] remember my testimony 2010 when the Lord
[22:07] spoke to my heart and said I'll be back
[22:09] on the fields. I wasn't in the field for
[22:10] many many years. The Lord spoke to me
[22:12] told my wife I said the Lord told me I
[22:14] was back in the fields. There was
[22:15] nobody. There was no calls. There was
[22:17] nothing. And 2012 the calls begin to
[22:19] come in and God fulfill his word. God
[22:21] never speaks something that he can't
[22:22] back up. God can't lie. If God speak it,
[22:25] if it's God, if it's God, he will
[22:27] vindicate
[22:28] [Applause]
[22:29] it. But there's a need. There's a need
[22:32] out there. And and now that God has
[22:34] opened up the word to us in such a
[22:36] positive way. Then you realize that a
[22:39] lot of things is like you say mirrors
[22:41] and shadows. It's just shadows. It's not
[22:44] the real thing. The real thing is Christ
[22:48] and you. Christ in you. That's the real
[22:52] thing. Not the church, not the
[22:54] organization, not the group, not the
[22:56] body a people, but Christ in you the
[22:59] hope of glory. And when you see that,
[23:02] you are individual powerhouse. You you
[23:04] become a source of God's. You see, you
[23:06] you become your own power source. Then
[23:10] afterwards, you have to plug into
[23:11] nobody. You plug into the source
[23:13] himself. The source coming inside of
[23:15] you. Then you become a source of God to
[23:18] go out to the world, to your family, to
[23:20] your loved ones. Isn't that beautiful
[23:21] this morning? Oh, hallelujah. And as
[23:24] you're growing, God, the the the weight
[23:27] of the world falling off of you, the old
[23:30] leaves of your life falling off of you.
[23:33] Depression begin to fall. Frustration
[23:35] begin to fall. You begin to grow in God.
[23:37] You get closer to God. You get more
[23:39] mature. The things that you couldn't
[23:40] overcome, you start to overcome because
[23:42] you recognize those things are petty.
[23:44] Those things, you're called to overcome
[23:46] it. Your struggle is great. It was a
[23:48] great struggle. You struggle whole week
[23:50] to be here, but you thank God your
[23:52] victory. You made it to be here. Oh,
[23:54] glory to God. This is the Sunday we call
[23:56] Palm Sunday. This when Jesus come down a
[23:58] little donkey. Praise God. Right in
[24:00] Jerusalem. He tell them, "Go and tell
[24:02] that man that donkey is for me." Go and
[24:04] tell them the master have need of that
[24:06] donkey. Hallelujah. That man going to
[24:08] release that donkey. Oh, glory to God.
[24:11] And you, God have need of you. Come on
[24:13] now. The devil have to Hey, devil have
[24:16] to let you go. The devil have to loose
[24:18] you because God want to ride you this
[24:21] morning. Oh, don't let me try to preach
[24:23] this morning. The preacher going to come
[24:24] and preach, but God want to ride you.

[24:28] the Lord a shout in the
[24:31] house. My God. My
[24:34] God. Are we ready

[24:40] revival the rest of the
[24:42] evening. Okay. Okay. So, we are sharing
[24:44] the service this morning and uh we would
[24:47] like you to stand and we want to go into
[24:50] the word Luke chapter 14 and Revelation
[24:54] chapter 18 for scripture reading by the
[24:58] grace of God.
[25:13] Luke chapter 14 reading from verse 16.
[25:15] Luke chapter
[25:20] 14. So when I finish Isaac but I'm going
[25:23] to come afterwards and minister to you
[25:25] and we have special service today. Then
[25:27] we have the prayer
[25:29] line reading from verse
[25:32] 16. Then he said, this is and then said
[25:35] he unto him, a certain man made a great
[25:38] supper and bade many, sent his servant
[25:41] at supper time to say to them that were
[25:43] bidden, come for all things are not
[25:45] ready. And they all with one consent
[25:49] began to make excuse. The first said
[25:51] unto him, I have bought a piece of
[25:53] ground and I must needs go and see it. I
[25:56] pray thee have me excused. Another said,
[25:58] I have bought five yolk of oxen and I
[26:00] have to prove them. I pray thee have me
[26:02] excused. Another said, I have married a
[26:05] wife and therefore I cannot come. So the
[26:07] servants came showed his lord these
[26:09] things. Then the master of the house
[26:11] being angry said to his servants, "Go
[26:14] out quickly into the streets and and
[26:16] lanes of the city and bring in hither of
[26:19] the poor and the mean and the halt and
[26:22] the blind." And the servant said, "Lord,
[26:25] it is done as thou hast commanded, and
[26:27] yet there is room." And the Lord said
[26:29] unto the servant, "Go out into the
[26:32] highways, into the
[26:34] byways, go out into the highways and
[26:37] hedges, and compel them to come in, that
[26:41] my house may be filled. For I say unto
[26:44] you, that none of those men which were
[26:47] bidden shall taste of my supper." Amen.
[26:51] Reading from Revelation 18 verse 1:5.
[26:54] And after these things, I saw another
[26:56] angel come down from heaven, having
[26:58] great power, and the earth was lightened
[27:00] with his glory. He cried mightily with a
[27:03] strong voice, saying, "Babylon the great
[27:05] is fallen, is fallen, and has become a
[27:07] habitation of devils, and the hold of
[27:10] every foul spirit, and a cage of every
[27:13] unclean and hateful bird. For all
[27:15] nations have drunk of the wine of the
[27:18] wrath of a fornication, and the kings of
[27:20] the earth have committed fornication
[27:22] with her, and the merchants of the earth
[27:24] are wax rich through the abundance of
[27:26] her delicacies. And I heard another
[27:28] voice from heaven, saying, "Come out
[27:29] from her, my people, that you be be not
[27:32] partakers of her sins, and that he
[27:34] received not of her plagues, for her
[27:36] sins have reached unto heaven, and God
[27:38] had remembered her iniquities." Let's
[27:40] bow our heads with a prayer. Father, we
[27:41] thank you for your word. Bless it.
[27:43] interpret our hearts, confirm your word
[27:46] with signs, wonders, and miracles. And
[27:48] bless your people, your needy children
[27:50] that are here looking for a
[27:51] breakthrough, deliverance, touch,
[27:53] healing from you. Grant it, Father.
[27:55] Honor your word, Lord. In Jesus name we
[27:56] ask it. Amen and amen. You may be
[27:59] seated. Praise God. Blessed be the name
[28:01] of the Lord. Just give God some praises
[28:03] as you are seated.
[28:13] [Music]
[28:17] I have a title this morning. And yet
[28:20] there is room. Amen. That's my title.
[28:23] Amen.
[28:25] I have an inspiration. Come out of
[28:28] Babylon. Come out of confusion. Amen.
[28:31] Because that is what Babylon is. I want
[28:34] to bring back something we said two
[28:36] Sundays are back from the seal of God.
[28:39] But was saying this, the first church
[28:41] started off at the
[28:42] pentecost where the Holy Spirit was
[28:45] poured out on believers. That is where
[28:47] the church started off. Started off
[28:49] where? At Pentecost. We saw the reaction
[28:53] of these believers and how it acted upon
[28:55] them, what they did, and the signs and
[28:58] wonders that followed them. Now after
[29:02] the closing of the church age about 300
[29:04] years they sprung up a heresy among them
[29:06] called the doctrine of the nicolatan. It
[29:09] was a heresy and that word nicolatan
[29:12] means to conquer the ley. It was the
[29:14] introduction of men reign in the church
[29:18] without holy ghost structure of men.
[29:21] Okay we find out it was deeds to begin
[29:23] with the next church age to become a
[29:25] doctrine and then become persecution in
[29:28] the dark age. Then when Martin Luther
[29:31] come out seeing the spirit of God lead
[29:34] him out instead of letting the people
[29:36] stay free he organized the church and
[29:39] the image likened unto the beast. So
[29:41] clearly the prophet revealed what the
[29:43] image of the beast is. Any organized
[29:46] church is image unto the beast because
[29:48] the beast system is the Catholic church
[29:50] which was the first organized church and
[29:52] on her revelation 17 said she had
[29:55] blasphemous names and these names are
[29:57] like Baptist, Methodist, Pentecostal,
[29:58] Jehovah Witness. All these names are
[29:59] names of blasphemy because God didn't
[30:01] make that. God only making sons and
[30:03] daughters. In the last days, God
[30:05] promised sons and daughters. Methodist
[30:06] produced Methodist, Baptist produce
[30:08] Baptist. Pentecostal produce
[30:09] Pentecostal. But God's word produce sons
[30:12] and daughters. Amen. So God promises
[30:14] send Elijah the prophet to turn the
[30:16] hearts of the children back to the faith
[30:17] of the fathers. So God called the mother
[30:19] church a and called it that she
[30:22] had daughters which is Protestant
[30:24] churches. So pot call black
[30:28] because both all are filthy in God's
[30:30] sight and it's a spirit. It's an
[30:32] organizational spirit. And once that
[30:34] take church, once that take over, then
[30:36] the people don't speak as individuals.
[30:38] They speak with a church voice.
[30:42] And that is the B system. When you're
[30:44] speaking with a church voice, when you
[30:47] no longer have the voice of God as an
[30:49] individual by revelation, Peter said,
[30:51] "Thou art the Christ, the son of the
[30:52] living God." Peter didn't speak for
[30:55] nobody.
[30:56] Jesus said, "Flesh and blood hath not
[30:59] revealed this unto you, but my father
[31:01] have revealed it unto you. And I said,
[31:03] thou art beaten, upon this rock, I will
[31:05] build my church, and the gates of hell
[31:10] will never prevail against it."
[31:22] Hallelujah.
[31:24] Amen. Amen. So when Martin Luther come
[31:27] out, seeing the spirit of God lead him
[31:29] out, instead of letting the people stay
[31:30] free, he organized the church, an image
[31:33] unto the beast, a political power
[31:35] lightened unto it. Watch. So then they
[31:38] organized the church and made an image
[31:40] unto the beast, a political organized
[31:44] power purpose to bind the people to to a
[31:48] creed instead of being free to worship
[31:52] and walk in the light. Hallelujah.
[31:55] Watch. Do you realize, Christian
[31:56] friends, that the antichrist, which is
[31:58] the mark of the beast? The antichrist.
[31:59] Anyone knows that the mark is a power?
[32:03] The beast is a power. Here we go. Are
[32:06] you ready? There's a power of the
[32:08] Catholic Church. There's a power of the
[32:10] Methodist Church. There's a power that's
[32:12] that is beast power. The Baptist church
[32:15] the same. All of them, the Pentecost are
[32:16] just as bad. So the prophet prophesied
[32:20] in 1955 around the 50s that there will
[32:23] come a message among the Gentiles that
[32:25] will bring the bride out.
[32:31] So many are being people being marked by
[32:33] the beast system and don't even know it.
[32:36] Listen to what the prophet said. He
[32:37] said, "Well, God bless you from seed of
[32:39] the antichrist." He said, "If you want
[32:41] to see real Christian genuine gifts and
[32:44] not impersonation, if you want to see
[32:45] real solid Christians walking and so
[32:47] salty till the earth is thirsting, we
[32:50] can't go down the street and tell what a
[32:51] Christian is anymore." They go down the
[32:53] street, they act the same, they talk the
[32:55] same all the time, cracking all kind of
[32:57] jokes, everything like that. When God
[32:59] said, "You'll give account for every
[33:01] idle word that you speak." What
[33:02] happened? Because, brother, you are let
[33:05] the devil come in and put it over your
[33:06] eyes. The first thing you know, hear the
[33:09] prophecy. The time will come when God
[33:12] will give a message and you'll be sealed
[33:15] in or out of the kingdom.
[33:20] There is the prophecy. That's right. A
[33:22] message will come that will produce the
[33:24] sealing in oral sealing out. No other
[33:29] thing. Sealing or sealed out. So
[33:33] therefore, when God give that message,
[33:35] you are sealed in or seal out the
[33:37] kingdom of God. Isn't that right? And
[33:38] the seal of God is the Holy Ghost. The
[33:41] mark of the beast is rejecting it. Amen.
[33:43] Or unbelief in the Holy Ghost or turning
[33:45] down the Holy Ghost. That is the mark of
[33:47] the beast. So the Holy Spirit come to
[33:50] seal you into the body of Christ. Not
[33:52] into a church. Hallelujah. That means
[33:56] you could go anywhere and worship. You
[33:58] could go any country and worship. You
[34:01] could go any church and worship. Because
[34:03] you're not sealing the church. Come on
[34:05] now. You are sealing the Christ.
[34:10] Oh, give the Lord a shout.
[34:12] So all this thing you have to come to
[34:14] this church is foolishness. You have to
[34:16] come to that church. That's nonsense.
[34:18] That's Babylon. Come out of her, my
[34:20] people. Oh, give the Lord a shout of
[34:23] praise. Hallelujah. That's confusion.
[34:26] [Applause]
[34:30] My God. I always wondered about that in
[34:33] Revelation 18.
[34:36] I was wondering about that why the
[34:38] message was come out of Babylon. Now I
[34:41] know with all this other confusion there
[34:44] got to come aboard message a genuine
[34:46] echo message to say come out of Babylon.
[34:49] Babylon means confusion. In other words,
[34:52] when you come out there can be no
[34:54] confusion. Nothing messing your mind.
[34:57] You should know where you come from.
[34:59] You're supposed to know where you're
[35:01] going. You're supposed to know who you
[35:03] are, what you're going
[35:06] for. No
[35:08] confusion. Oh, thank God. We out of
[35:12] Babylon. Babylon is fallen. Babylon is
[35:16] fallen. Babylon is fallen. Oh, glory to
[35:20] God. The Holy Ghost is here. Babylon
[35:24] will come down. Every man's system will
[35:30] fall. And let me say it plain. Every man
[35:33] system built in this message of seven
[35:37] seas and seven thunders will fall.
[35:46] The only thing that going to stand is
[35:49] the word of God. Bible said we have
[35:51] received a kingdom that that that cannot
[35:55] be moved because everything that can be
[35:57] shaken will be shaken. Everything that
[36:01] can be shaken will be shaken. But we
[36:04] have received a kingdom that
[36:07] cannot be moved. Oh, hallelujah. When
[36:11] God put you in the kingdom, who could
[36:13] take you out of the kingdom?
[36:17] Who are these intellectual giants trying
[36:19] to put people out?
[36:22] They don't have a heaven. They don't
[36:24] have a hell. They can't keep anybody
[36:27] out. And yet
[36:30] There is room.
[36:35] Oh, glory to God. There is room for your
[36:38] family. Come on, preach back to me.
[36:41] There is room for your loved ones.
[36:42] There's room for the prostitute. There's
[36:45] room on the drunkard, call the lame,
[36:48] call the halt, call the blame. Yet there
[36:52] is room
[36:53] [Applause]
[37:00] Oh, give him praise. Give him worship.
[37:02] Give him glory. Glory to God. Yeah,
[37:05] there is room. You say, "But I'm a
[37:07] sinner." There is room. Lord, I'm back.
[37:10] I'm backing. Yeah, there is room. Lord,
[37:12] I'm struggling. There is room. Don't let
[37:15] the devil tell you otherwise. Yeah,
[37:17] there is room.
[37:28] Don't
[37:30] don't put put nobody out. You you didn't
[37:34] design the kingdom. You you didn't lay
[37:36] the foundation of it thereof. You you
[37:38] you didn't build it. You don't have the
[37:41] key to the door of it. So So you can't
[37:43] put anybody in and neither could you put
[37:46] anybody out. You you can't say this one
[37:48] not going to make it because they did
[37:50] this, that, and the other. You you you
[37:52] can't say this one can't make it because
[37:54] they fell here and they failed here and
[37:57] they did this here. You you can't say
[37:59] that. The the the the master said, "Go
[38:01] and find him. Find him. Find him. Find
[38:06] him. Find him." And the voice said, "It
[38:09] is done." But there is room. Come on
[38:13] now. Help me preach somebody.
[38:21] Glory.
[38:23] Glory. Hallelujah.
[38:25] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Find
[38:30] him. Find him. Find him. And yet there
[38:35] is
[38:40] room. You may be
[38:42] seated. So much room. So much room. He
[38:47] tell them compel them.
[38:49] That's different from asking them to
[38:50] come. You know, that different from
[38:52] inviting them to come, you know, tell
[38:53] them I come to pick you up. I come here
[38:55] to wait on you. I carry a service this
[38:58] morning. I waiting until you come out. I
[39:00] buying a dress for you. I bring in a
[39:02] pants for you. I go buy you a tie. You
[39:05] have to be there this morning. This
[39:07] deliverance day. This is victory day.
[39:10] This is healing day. This is firefalling
[39:13] day.
[39:28] Don't let nobody think you they will
[39:30] kick you out the kingdom. They could put
[39:33] you out the kingdom. Oh, hallelujah. Oh,
[39:36] praise God. Just a little more.
[39:38] Hallelujah. And the preacher going to
[39:39] preach something to you this morning.
[39:42] Hallelujah. Oh, glory to God. I love
[39:45] that parable. I love that story. You
[39:49] know what the master say? None of them
[39:50] who make the excuses. None of them who
[39:52] got invited will be receive taste of his
[39:56] supper. Remind me of the 2 million
[39:59] people that came out. 2 million people
[40:01] didn't go in. They just come out. Don't
[40:04] be like that. Don't be satisfied to come
[40:07] out. I'm not a Baptist. I'm not a par
[40:09] Catholic. I'm not a Pentecostal. You
[40:11] come out, but have you gone in?
[40:15] I'm in the message. I believe William
[40:16] Brown 4. That's good. You come out. But
[40:19] have you gone in? Hallelujah. Because
[40:21] the prophet himself, he brought a
[40:23] message.
[40:26] Amen.
[40:28] To go in.
[40:30] Message the Ephesians. Oh, praise God.
[40:34] All right. Now, let's go. Now, watch.
[40:36] This is from Christ the mission. God
[40:38] revealed. Here we go. God holds the key
[40:41] to the revelation of Christ
[40:44] himself. Schools of theology can never
[40:47] find it. That's right. Jesus said so.
[40:50] Amen. scripture Matthew 11:25 and 27
[40:54] Jesus said, "I thank thee, Father, God
[40:57] of heavens and earth, that thou has hid
[41:00] these things from the eyes of the wise
[41:04] and prudent, and has revealed it to
[41:07] babes such as would learn." Jesus
[41:10] himself said he hide it from them,
[41:15] but revealed it to his elect.
[41:18] [Applause]
[41:20] So watch Isaiah said you have ears you
[41:22] can't hear, eyes you can't see. Cuz
[41:25] Isaiah said in the spirit, God has
[41:27] blinded your eyes. You're doing like Eve
[41:30] accepting the intellectual side and know
[41:33] nothing of the spirit of God. Won't they
[41:37] fall in the ditch? Both the leader and
[41:38] the blind too. The leader will fall with
[41:41] the blind cuz he's blind also. The
[41:43] leader fall, he's blind. leading the
[41:45] blind. They both fall into the ditch.
[41:48] Jesus said, "Let them alone. Let the
[41:51] blind lead the blind." We not
[41:53] responsible for the blind leading blind.
[41:56] We're responsible to bring the word to
[41:57] the elect. Thank God. God open your
[42:00] eyes. That you could hear and see and be
[42:04] free.
[42:05] Oh, hallelujah.
[42:07] God alone holds the key.
[42:10] He expressed the same thing in a
[42:12] previous scripture. Who do men say the
[42:14] son of man I am? And he told Peter thou
[42:16] art when Peter said thou art the Christ
[42:17] blessed thou Simon Jonah flesh and blood
[42:20] hast never revealed it to you but my
[42:21] father which is in heaven has revealed
[42:23] to you. So therefore here we
[42:27] go. There is no school, no
[42:31] theologians, no teaching of the Bible
[42:33] among any school that knows anything
[42:35] about it. They cannot know nothing about
[42:38] it. It's impossible for them to know
[42:40] anything about it. God has hid the
[42:42] senses of knowing it from the very
[42:44] elected teachers. Hallelujah.
[42:47] It's a personal individual affair with
[42:50] the person that Christ has revealed to
[42:53] them. Did you get that? It's not a group
[42:56] thing. It's a personal affair that
[42:59] Christ has revealed himself to you.
[43:02] Hallelujah. Sometime you wonder if
[43:03] people have ever met Christ.
[43:06] Have you met Christ? Have you met the
[43:09] Lord? Has he softened your heart?
[43:13] Speak to your heart.
[43:17] Has you shown him? Has he shown you his
[43:19] cross? Have you fell at his feet and
[43:23] experienced the dripping of his blood
[43:24] from off Calvary? Hallelujah.
[43:27] Hallelujah. Mercy there was great and
[43:29] grace was free. Pardon there was
[43:31] multiply to me. There my burden soul
[43:34] found liberty at Calvary. Had you had a
[43:36] Calvary experience when you could sing
[43:38] at the cross? At the cross where I first
[43:40] saw the light
[43:42] tongue at the cross where my savior
[43:44] died. Hallelujah. There from cleansing
[43:48] from sin I cried. There to my heart was
[43:51] the blood applied singing glory to his
[43:54] name. That is rich Christian experience.
[43:58] Not this intellectual mumbo jumbo
[44:00] sitting in a pew saying you're in the
[44:02] message. No. They got to have a heart
[44:05] shaking, demon chasing, blood covering,
[44:10] Holy Ghost anointing
[44:12] gospel. That's what's lacking.
[44:18] Hallelujah.
[44:20] Thank you, Jesus. Let's go.
[44:24] If you say he's been revealed to me and
[44:26] then the life that Christ produced here
[44:28] in the Bible doesn't produce life in
[44:30] you, you got the wrong revelation. Amen.
[44:33] So they not a talk thing. They not a
[44:35] talk show. You have talk show and comic
[44:37] show. This is not that. This is you have
[44:41] to have backing with your testimony.
[44:44] Isn't that right? Every denomination
[44:46] will bear fruit of itself of its own
[44:48] life.
[44:50] And if here we go that original vine
[44:54] ever put forth another shoot, it will
[44:57] bear grapes like it did the first time.
[44:59] Now this is what I like. the life of
[45:01] Jesus Christ ever puts forth another
[45:03] body of believers, it will bear the
[45:05] fruit of the first one did, they will
[45:08] write a book of acts behind it.
[45:10] Oh, you should give a scream on that one
[45:13] because that is the original church.
[45:15] That is what the prophet was sent to
[45:17] back to. In the book of Acts, who was in
[45:19] charge? Who was the bishop? Who was the
[45:22] pope? Who was the man in charge? Who was
[45:25] the man of the hour? It had none like
[45:28] that. The Holy Ghost sent Peter. So, the
[45:30] Holy Ghost sent Philillip. So, the Holy
[45:32] Ghost sent Paul. So, come on, give the
[45:35] Lord a scream in the
[45:36] [Applause]
[45:44] house. Here we go. So, if the church is
[45:47] to put forth another branch, it will be
[45:51] another book of Acts. It will be the
[45:54] acts of the Holy Ghost moving through
[45:57] the people.
[46:06] God is not known by education. That's
[46:09] right. That's right. You want a bigger
[46:12] bum? I'll keep reading. God, he is not
[46:15] known by how to explain it.
[46:20] Let that soak a little bit. Somebody
[46:22] want to explain the Trump.
[46:24] God is not known by that. Somebody want
[46:26] to explain the the new name. You can
[46:29] explain it. God is not known by
[46:30] explaining it. Explain the millennium.
[46:34] Explain the seven seal. Explain the
[46:37] seven thunders. God is not known by
[46:38] explanation. He is known watch by
[46:41] simplicity
[46:43] and revelation of Jesus Christ to the
[46:47] most illiterate person.
[46:50] You don't need education to get
[46:52] revelation.
[46:54] [Applause]
[47:05] Moses had education, Egyptian education.
[47:09] Moses was qualified. He had his degree
[47:10] and masters in the Egyptian arts. But
[47:13] when he killed the man, he ran with his
[47:16] degree, with his masters. He ran
[47:18] straight out of Egypt and went and
[47:20] established himself with a family
[47:23] relaxing for 40 years.
[47:27] That same man that ran when fire
[47:33] when fire came upon that man he said I
[47:36] can't talk. God say make mouth come
[47:37] continue. Come on now. Give me that.
[47:40] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh you can't I
[47:43] can't do this. I can't press. I can't
[47:45] stand. Let that fire come once. Let that
[47:49] fire come upon your life once. When I
[47:52] get in peer pressure and all them young
[47:54] people trying to push me and all my
[47:56] friends trying to push me and this one
[47:58] trying to pull me. Let that fire come
[48:00] upon you once. Just
[48:07] once you be seated that fire wrecked
[48:10] Moses intellect when God finished with
[48:13] Moses and he meet his wife. He said
[48:14] where you going? He said, "I'm going to
[48:16] take over. I'm going back to Egypt. Not
[48:20] by might nor by power." The man going
[48:21] back to Egypt to take over. That's when
[48:23] a man met God. Nothing blocks him.
[48:26] Nothing stops him. Nothing interrupts
[48:28] him. That man is focused. That man don't
[48:30] care. That man is unstoppable. That man
[48:32] is invincible. That man cannot become
[48:34] con conquered. Oh, glory to God. That
[48:36] man is a oneman invincible. Help me.
[48:39] Sent by God. He is one sent. Some went,
[48:42] but this one was sent. Come on, say
[48:44] amen, somebody. Oh, glory to God. We not
[48:47] bother with who just went. Oh, but when
[48:49] God sent that something else, the whole
[48:51] heaven behind you, all the angels behind
[48:54] you, the fire behind you, the anointing
[48:57] behind you. Oh, glory to God. What a
[48:59] revival we're going to have.
[49:01] [Applause]
[49:06] So God is known by simplicity and a
[49:09] revelation of Jesus Christ to the most
[49:11] illiterate person not your the not your
[49:13] theology is a revelation of Jesus Christ
[49:16] upon this rock I'll build my church nor
[49:18] the rocks accepted nor the things
[49:20] accepted nor the Roman rock protestant
[49:22] rock nor the school nor the nothing but
[49:24] exactly the revelation of Jesus Christ
[49:26] through the new birth
[49:30] I hear ministers preach and you never
[49:32] hear Jesus Christ name once
[49:37] It's astonishing. A whole service and
[49:40] you're not even hearing name Jesus. My
[49:42] God. Every other thing could nobody do
[49:44] that.
[49:46] The Bible is the revelation of Jesus.
[49:49] John, all these mystery John the
[49:51] revelation of Jesus Christ which God
[49:53] give to him.
[49:56] All these symbols have to do with Jesus
[49:58] Christ.
[49:59] He's the mystery behind it. John say
[50:02] white horse rider bow with no arrow red
[50:04] horse pale horse that was John C but
[50:07] behind that had Paul Martin Arenas they
[50:10] couldn't see all of that that was stars
[50:12] in the right hand of God symbolized
[50:14] [Applause]
[50:16] so wherever you see the enemy don't just
[50:18] look at the enemy alone behind that have
[50:21] something hidden there come on now come
[50:24] on now
[50:27] give me a scripture preacher whenever
[50:28] the enemy come like a flood
[50:34] The spirit is always there to raise a
[50:37] standard. So the enemy come like a flood
[50:39] and you're feeling wrong and you're
[50:40] feeling drunk and and you're feeling
[50:42] like you're sinking. But God is here
[50:44] today to raise a standard in your life.
[50:51] Okay, here we go.
[50:55] Amen. So exactly the revelation of Jesus
[50:57] Christ through the new birth he he is
[50:59] born in there and listen he injects his
[51:01] own life your life is gone and the life
[51:04] of Christ is projecting itself through
[51:08] you with the preeminences to the people
[51:11] and they see the very life and works and
[51:16] signs and wonders that he did is doing
[51:20] the same thing through you. Outside of
[51:22] that, the rest of it is not even called
[51:24] to at all. Watch God's great revelation
[51:29] unfolding. By lack of this revelation is
[51:33] why we have so many different divisions
[51:36] among us. So much mockery, so much
[51:39] divisions because the people lack that
[51:42] revelation. They lack that revelation.
[51:45] The teachers, he didn't saying
[51:47] revelation making divisions. He is
[51:49] saying lack of revelation. What
[51:52] revelation? The lack of the revelation
[51:54] of Jesus Christ. Because if you
[51:56] understand it's the revelation of Jesus
[51:58] Christ, then no man will want to rule
[52:00] over no other man. Come on now. The
[52:03] five-fold ministry is not a permanent
[52:05] post. It's till we all come. Come on
[52:08] now. To the unity of the faith, to the
[52:11] knowledge of the son of God, unto a
[52:13] perfect man. Give the Lord some praises.
[52:20] [Applause]
[52:26] You take a little small glass of ocean
[52:29] water. It have the same contents as the
[52:32] whole ocean. You know,
[52:34] so a little piece of God in a son of God
[52:36] is just as God in a son of God, you
[52:38] know. Little piece, small piece, big
[52:40] piece. God have different offices and
[52:42] role. Like Elijah said when he passed
[52:45] through Giggal and Bethl and Jericho, he
[52:46] said, "What do you want?" He said double
[52:48] portion. He says ask a hard thing. My
[52:51] God. He says ask a big thing. That guy
[52:53] had faith. That guy had courage. He
[52:56] pressed after being told stay here. Stay
[52:58] here. You belong here. Put sit down
[53:01] here. He said no. I see something.
[53:08] That's when a man have a revelation. Not
[53:11] even the prophet could stop him. Come on
[53:12] now.
[53:14] You see, Elijah didn't give Elisha
[53:17] revelation. It was the Lord. It was the
[53:20] father.
[53:26] Did you get that? You may be seated.
[53:29] That is the prophet Elijah. The prophet
[53:31] say stay here at Jericho. He said no.
[53:34] Amen.
[53:36] Now our next obedient denominational
[53:40] group thinking believer said to the
[53:42] prophet tell me say some of them stay
[53:43] away the prophet tell them
[53:47] but that man you see you see you see
[53:50] think about it the Lord told Elijah what
[53:52] to do throw the man and pull it off gave
[53:55] him a taste to pull the fire and pull it
[53:57] off because when you pull it off it put
[53:59] a deep to call to a
[54:04] You see, he had to grow into his
[54:06] passion. He had to grow into his desire.
[54:09] He had to grow into power. He had to
[54:11] grow into vision. You don't born big.
[54:14] Come on.
[54:20] So, you have to grow into the mantle.
[54:23] So, first you just drop the mantle, pull
[54:25] it off, and walk away like you ain't do
[54:26] nothing. I
[54:29] a season. Drop it and pull it off. Wait,
[54:33] wait, wait, where you going? Where you
[54:34] going? Afterward, you had a cursing in
[54:37] your life. Like you're saying, you're
[54:38] crazy. Husband can't satisfy that. Man
[54:41] can satisfy that. Woman cast. Wife,
[54:44] husband, children, brother, money,
[54:46] house, car. It's a longing. It's a deep
[54:49] calling to a deep. You don't know you're
[54:51] hungry in the morning. You're hungry not
[54:53] for food.
[55:02] You're thirsting for God. Oh, it's a joy
[55:05] to preach to you cuz the Bible said the
[55:07] love of many going wax cold. But I feel
[55:10] your love waxing warm. Your love for
[55:13] Christ because of iniquity. The love of
[55:15] many service going harder and colder and
[55:18] dry and people just shaking their head.
[55:20] And God don't want to. God want you.
[55:24] Amen. God want you glory. God want
[55:28] Hallelujah.
[55:29] That's what God wants you to
[55:32] [Music]
[55:34] do. And when the joy come back, you
[55:36] know, bring back the joy. David say, I
[55:39] was glad when they said unto me, bring
[55:40] back the joy. The joy of the Lord is my
[55:44] strength.
[55:45] When you have a love for God to serve
[55:47] God, to service people. Oh, glory to
[55:50] God. The love of God breaking upon your
[55:55] soul. It too short to have. It too late
[55:59] to have grudges. Hallelujah. Short to
[56:02] hold enmity against people and despising
[56:05] this one.
[56:07] Why are you saying I
[56:09] believe the kingdom have room
[56:14] for your enemies too?
[56:17] For people you don't like.
[56:20] [Music]
[56:21] [Applause]
[56:24] Look, look, look. The people don't want
[56:26] to say amen on that one.
[56:28] Oh. Oh. Remember the prodical son, the
[56:31] big brother, the big brother thought he
[56:32] alone was getting everything. You know
[56:34] when the younger brother come and the
[56:35] father killed the fatted calf and give
[56:37] him the ring, I give him the robe. He
[56:39] outside. He don't want to come in again
[56:40] fight.
[56:42] Man had no revelation. Pure
[56:44] intellectual. Father tell him but son
[56:46] but but everything I have is yours.
[56:50] Al cow. You getting on so far? Cow.
[56:55] One ring, one robe, and a
[56:59] cocoa. Come on. You could do better than
[57:03] [Applause]
[57:10] that. Well, when I I was washing the car
[57:13] all along and I thought I was going to
[57:15] cook the car myself. I thought I was
[57:16] going to invite my friend. But father
[57:18] said you could have do that already.
[57:19] It's that one car we have. You could
[57:21] pick anyone. Fatted one, medium size
[57:24] one, slim one, thin
[57:26] one. But this my son was lost. Yet there
[57:30] is room. This my son was
[57:34] sick. Oh, tell somebody there is room.
[57:42] [Applause]
[58:01] So I don't care if your daughter wearing
[58:03] mini skirt, there is room. I don't care
[58:06] if your son smoking cigarette, there is
[58:08] room.
[58:13] [Applause]
[58:20] You may be seated
[58:22] here where there is no room. There is no
[58:25] room for you to say you're coming
[58:28] now. You now see the light.
[58:32] No, it have no room for that. It have no
[58:35] room for you to make style on them. So
[58:36] look at you now. Look at you now. Church
[58:38] long time. for 20 years ain't church
[58:40] waiting on you.
[58:43] That's what you have to do. Have no room
[58:45] for that. You have to be like God. Let
[58:48] the let the sun just shine on them. Let
[58:51] your blessing fall upon them. Oh, glory.
[58:54] Let your grace move out towards them.
[58:56] Let your grace reach unto them. Oh,
[58:59] glory to God. They can't stop you. They
[59:01] can't touch you because there is no fear
[59:03] in love. Love without love there is
[59:05] without with fear there is torment. With
[59:07] love, there is no torment. Nothing could
[59:09] hurt you when you're walking in that
[59:11] kind of love. Nothing could touch you.
[59:13] Come on now. It's supernatural. It's
[59:16] heavenly.
[59:21] We forcing we forcing some of you to
[59:23] stretch this morning.
[59:28] Might don't want to say amen, but we
[59:29] forcing you to stretch this morning.
[59:30] Yeah, you got a troublesome son,
[59:32] daughter, cousin, aunt, auntie, mommy,
[59:33] daddy, who houseman, wife, whoever it
[59:35] is, whoever giving trouble, you have to
[59:37] understand there is room.
[59:39] That's why that's why the door is shut
[59:41] yet.
[59:43] That's why the anointing has strike home
[59:45] yet because there is room that marking
[59:49] angel want to put a mark. Come on
[59:53] now. Glory.
[59:56] Right now, some of you being marked by
[59:58] God.
[1:00:02] Your reward comes after. Put a seal. Put
[1:00:05] a
[1:00:06] [Applause]
[1:00:12] mark. Watch. The Holy Ghost alone is the
[1:00:17] only
[1:00:18] revealer of the divine revelation of
[1:00:21] Christ.
[1:00:23] Notice he didn't say the five-fold.
[1:00:25] Hallelujah. Amen. Notice he didn't say
[1:00:28] apostle.
[1:00:30] or prophet or teacher or pastor or
[1:00:34] evangelist. He said the Holy Ghost
[1:00:36] alone.
[1:00:38] Even if the prophet preaches, it will be
[1:00:40] the Holy Ghost alone.
[1:00:45] If the prophet come here and preach this
[1:00:47] morning, it will take the Holy Ghost to
[1:00:50] reveal what is being spoken.
[1:00:54] So do you understand? It's the Holy
[1:00:55] Ghost alone.
[1:00:57] The Holy Ghost alone is the revealer of
[1:01:00] the divine revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:01:02] has been in all ages. Who does the word
[1:01:04] come to the prophet? That is right. And
[1:01:06] the prophet had to be vindicated first.
[1:01:08] Not because he said he was a prophet
[1:01:10] because he was born a prophet. Proved to
[1:01:12] be a prophet. And everything he said was
[1:01:15] exactly on the word and come to pass.
[1:01:17] Then men of old moved by the Holy Ghost.
[1:01:21] Look, John the Baptist would have never
[1:01:23] known Jesus if it hadn't been for the
[1:01:24] Holy Ghost pointing him out upon whom
[1:01:26] you see the dove descending. That's the
[1:01:28] one John could never know it except the
[1:01:32] Holy Ghost. Reveal it to him. Look him
[1:01:34] there. That's the Messiah. Listen close
[1:01:38] now. I want you not to fail to get this.
[1:01:41] No other church, no other sign, no other
[1:01:45] fellowship, no other government, no
[1:01:48] other testimony, no other creed, no
[1:01:50] denomination is accepted outside of
[1:01:52] this.
[1:01:54] God accepts nothing else but Christ in
[1:01:57] you. Amen. The hope of glory. The only
[1:02:01] thing that God recognizes.
[1:02:04] Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. No fellowship,
[1:02:08] no church, no creed, no denomination, no
[1:02:12] nothing. Everything else is dead.
[1:02:16] It is fragments that has to be cut off,
[1:02:20] pruned off,
[1:02:22] that Christ might live with preeminences
[1:02:24] in you. Hallelujah.
[1:02:27] You said it's my organization. That's
[1:02:30] got to be cut off, too. Yes, sir. I got
[1:02:32] so and so in there. This says, "My
[1:02:35] mother will tell me I'm a holy roller."
[1:02:37] That's got to be cut off, too. My
[1:02:38] husband want me to wear these shorts.
[1:02:40] That has got to be cut off, too. It's
[1:02:42] got to be cut off and pruned till it's
[1:02:44] you and Christ
[1:02:47] alone.
[1:02:50] Where does your friend come in now?
[1:02:52] And is that person really your friend?
[1:02:55] Or is it the devil with a mask of a
[1:02:58] friend face?
[1:03:00] That person that influencing your life,
[1:03:02] they influencing your life positively or
[1:03:04] negatively.
[1:03:06] They influencing you the right way or
[1:03:07] the wrong way. Is that really your
[1:03:10] friend? Jesus is a good friend.
[1:03:13] [Applause]
[1:03:16] And and he has love the kind of love
[1:03:19] that he has rebuked. Hallelujah. He say,
[1:03:22] "As many as I love, I rebuke." I'm
[1:03:25] chasen. Be zealous therefore and repent.
[1:03:28] Oh hallelujah. That's the kind of friend
[1:03:30] you want to have. A friend that will
[1:03:31] correct you. A friend that rebuke you. A
[1:03:33] friend that tell you when you're going
[1:03:35] wrong to encourage you in wrong. But say
[1:03:37] no, no, no, no, no, no, no. That's not
[1:03:39] the way we are going. Remember, think of
[1:03:43] it that people born of the spirit in
[1:03:46] this day in this great denominational
[1:03:48] age that we live in. That's why we going
[1:03:50] to be a paradox. You know, got everybody
[1:03:52] connected to this beast system and image
[1:03:54] system. So who are you? Nobody. Your son
[1:03:56] or son? their son. Amen. Amen.
[1:04:01] Remember what Jesus encountered? He he
[1:04:03] encountered Pharisees, Sadducees,
[1:04:04] Herodian, scribes. He encountered all of
[1:04:06] these people. He was a solo. Then John
[1:04:08] the Bapt was solo before him. Talking
[1:04:10] about there's one standing among you.
[1:04:12] Here come Jesus getting the crowd, the
[1:04:13] multitudes. He's be popular, healing the
[1:04:15] sick, raising the dead. He the Pharisees
[1:04:18] and scribes to get fight.
[1:04:21] Then have those who want them to to
[1:04:23] rebel and and fight Rome. And Jesus had
[1:04:26] to tell him, well, listen fellas, my
[1:04:27] kingdom is not of this world. So put on
[1:04:29] your swords and behave yourself. We
[1:04:31] talking talking different.
[1:04:35] Count it with all joy when you enter the
[1:04:36] dantations and trials. Forget Rome. We
[1:04:39] have a next kingdom coming. Isn't that
[1:04:41] right? So Jesus is doing what now? He's
[1:04:43] bringing and introducing a new thought
[1:04:45] into the whole system of things. Cuz
[1:04:47] this is all new. This shaking the
[1:04:49] system. It rocking the fire of the
[1:04:51] Pharisees, rocking the scribes. What he
[1:04:53] introducing? A new birth. You must be
[1:04:55] born again. Hallelujah. Your life have
[1:04:57] to change. You can't continue as you
[1:04:58] are. You hate I I tooth for to truth.
[1:05:01] But I say unto you, love your enemies.
[1:05:04] Start to jam the mind, interfere with
[1:05:06] the thoughts, jam the processes of of of
[1:05:09] of generations of law. He said to
[1:05:12] introduce grace, they find the woman in
[1:05:15] adultery act. And Moses law said stone.
[1:05:19] He said, "Yes, stoner if you have no
[1:05:23] sin." And all them have excuses to go.
[1:05:26] But yet there is room. Jesus said, "Who
[1:05:29] where are thine accusers?" Come on, say,
[1:05:31] "Amen, somebody." He said, "Woman, go
[1:05:33] and sin no more. Just go into the
[1:05:35] kingdom." Come on, give the Lord. Give
[1:05:37] the Lord a shout in the
[1:05:39] [Applause]
[1:05:44] house. So this is Jesus flipping things,
[1:05:48] turning things upside down, shaking up
[1:05:50] the community, shaking up the system.
[1:05:53] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:05:56] One time try to squeeze them and say,
[1:05:57] "My hour is not yet come." They can't
[1:05:59] touch me. They can't touch me.
[1:06:03] They can't touch me because my hour is
[1:06:06] not yet come.
[1:06:13] Glory to
[1:06:14] God. And when you overcome, when you
[1:06:17] overcome, you say, "My come, what more
[1:06:19] shall I say?" Oh, hallelujah.
[1:06:21] Hallelujah. And when your hour come, the
[1:06:23] devil can't stop it. When your hour of
[1:06:25] healing come, your hour of breakthrough
[1:06:27] come, your hour of deliverance come. And
[1:06:28] I believe it's here now today. But I
[1:06:30] believe your hour has come. The devil
[1:06:32] can't stop when your hour has come. Oh,
[1:06:36] let me finish off here now.
[1:06:42] [Applause]
[1:06:44] God vindicating in your life. He said
[1:06:48] something that you cannot do. proven
[1:06:50] himself. It's not you, it's him. You
[1:06:54] become a love slave to him to be bride.
[1:06:59] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Almost done. His
[1:07:02] presence in the
[1:07:03] individual only in an individual.
[1:07:08] Never in a group. An individual.
[1:07:12] Not in a group. Who said that? The
[1:07:15] prophet said that. Who could speak
[1:07:18] contrary to that?
[1:07:19] We challenge that. Not a group.
[1:07:24] Hallelujah. It's with the individual.
[1:07:27] That means no man could stop you from
[1:07:31] receiving your portion
[1:07:35] today. You didn't get that. You did not
[1:07:39] get that. Oh glory. You see brother Bam
[1:07:43] and discernment on the platform. People
[1:07:45] are coming up there. He's praying for
[1:07:46] them. And so all of a sudden pillar of
[1:07:47] fire move. He said that woman across
[1:07:49] there, God, I'm hanging over there, you
[1:07:52] you're sick with so and so. Your name is
[1:07:53] so and so. Jesus Christ just heal you.
[1:07:59] She didn't have a prayer card. She
[1:08:01] didn't have a card to line up with the
[1:08:03] group. She only had faith. Her faith hit
[1:08:07] God. God hit the prophet. The prophet
[1:08:09] has to hit back her. Come on now. Come
[1:08:12] on now. You know what that tells me?
[1:08:16] with your faith it's unstoppable.
[1:08:23] What? What? You may be seated. What
[1:08:24] about the woman with a dead baby in
[1:08:26] Mexico that they wanted to bury a baby?
[1:08:29] She heard about the next child that
[1:08:30] raised from the dead. She said, "No, not
[1:08:32] this baby. She going to the big
[1:08:34] convention." How much? Thousands and
[1:08:35] thousands of people. And she coming
[1:08:37] through with the dead baby. She's coming
[1:08:40] through. She passing through legs. She
[1:08:42] pushing through the ushers. She diving
[1:08:44] on top the deacons. They couldn't hold
[1:08:46] her back. Roxion.
[1:08:51] That's a mother that is desperate. She
[1:08:54] doesn't want the She want the life of
[1:08:55] that child come back.
[1:08:58] The prophet tell somebody she don't know
[1:09:00] who I am. Go and somebody pray for her.
[1:09:03] That wasn't stopping her. She said
[1:09:05] something on that platform there. I have
[1:09:07] to get there. She moving through. Crowd
[1:09:09] didn't matter. Numbers didn't matter.
[1:09:12] Moving through. That's the attitude you
[1:09:14] have to get. You come today to move
[1:09:17] through to get something from the
[1:09:22] Lord. All of a sudden, I'm on the prayer
[1:09:25] line. He see a baby smiling. He said,
[1:09:28] "Wait a minute. That's the woman. Let
[1:09:30] her come." What happened? She touched
[1:09:33] Helen
[1:09:36] and hit the emergency line.
[1:09:42] When you hit the emergency line, a red
[1:09:44] light does that show up in heaven.
[1:09:52] The blue light is when you're taking it
[1:09:54] cool. But when you're desperate is a red
[1:09:57] light, angels assemble. They say, "You
[1:10:00] see that red light? Emergency
[1:10:02] downstairs."
[1:10:07] Oh, hallelujah. Let's activate that red
[1:10:10] light this morning. Glory. Don't give me
[1:10:13] blue. Don't give me blue. Don't give me
[1:10:21] blue. So in not in a group, his
[1:10:25] identification with individual watch.
[1:10:27] Not with the Methodist, not with the
[1:10:29] Baptist, not with the Presbyterian, not
[1:10:32] with the Lutheran, not with the
[1:10:33] Pentecostal, with the individual. I'll
[1:10:36] take one and leave one.
[1:10:39] Hallelujah. Not I'll take one group and
[1:10:41] leave one group. Amen. That's right.
[1:10:43] Amen. There'll be two in a few. I'll
[1:10:46] take one and leave one. It's not a
[1:10:48] group. Not say my church. No, my church
[1:10:52] has nothing to do with it. So when you
[1:10:57] hear people talk about my church, forget
[1:10:58] it. That's saying like my Catholic
[1:11:00] church
[1:11:02] or my Methodist church. What on earth
[1:11:05] does that have to do with God?
[1:11:08] asked a woman, "Do you believe in Jesus
[1:11:09] Christ?" She said, "Have you to know I
[1:11:10] burn three candles at night?"
[1:11:14] He say, "What on earth that have to do
[1:11:16] with anything but Jesus
[1:11:19] Christ?" But the church tell her, "Burn
[1:11:22] three candles. Say to our father and
[1:11:24] three holy Mary and you're good for the
[1:11:27] weak."
[1:11:29] The church says so. As long as the
[1:11:31] church is God, she good. Yeah. But God
[1:11:34] is the word. Sorry.
[1:11:36] Sorry. God is not church. God is the
[1:11:40] word. God is not ironing message. God is
[1:11:43] the word. Hear me. Brandon Tabernacle
[1:11:46] Baram says, "Apply the talk and perish."
[1:11:50] [Applause]
[1:11:53] Here we go. This is the part I want to
[1:11:55] get
[1:11:57] to. Not say my church. My church has
[1:12:01] nothing to do with it. It's an
[1:12:03] individual. one person. Are you ready?
[1:12:07] All hell is against this teaching.
[1:12:11] [Applause]
[1:12:13] Hello mind we preach group. Hello mind
[1:12:16] we preach. We right there all wrong.
[1:12:18] Hello mind that. Satan say come on now.
[1:12:21] You just like the mother church too.
[1:12:23] That's right.
[1:12:25] But when it comes to the individual, oh,
[1:12:28] hell is against that.
[1:12:31] Because when you come as individual, you
[1:12:33] cannot be deceived.
[1:12:35] [Applause]
[1:12:38] Because you are moving by
[1:12:42] revelation. Say revelation.
[1:12:45] Tell somebody, I'm moving by revelation.
[1:12:46] Tell somebody that.
[1:12:53] Hallelujah.
[1:12:56] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:12:58] [Applause]
[1:13:10] them but him. Yes, sir. An individual,
[1:13:13] another group. All hell is against it.
[1:13:16] Yes, sir. But this mystery, his mystery
[1:13:18] is only revealed to his beloved bride.
[1:13:21] I'm closing. Why am I against organ
[1:13:24] religion? That's the reason I spoke
[1:13:25] against the church, the lodge. I call I
[1:13:27] can't call it a church, brother.
[1:13:31] There's only one church and that church
[1:13:34] is the body of Christ. Amen. But these
[1:13:36] lodges that call church, my Bible tells
[1:13:39] me that they are blasphemous names all
[1:13:41] of them.
[1:13:45] All organizations what they are
[1:13:48] blaspheming. Blasphemy is to be contrary
[1:13:51] to or speak against against. When God
[1:13:54] say come be born, they say come join.
[1:13:57] All right. All right. Come and be a
[1:14:00] Jehovah Witness. Come and be a
[1:14:02] Methodist. Come and be a Pentecost. Come
[1:14:03] and join. And Jesus message was you must
[1:14:05] be born again.
[1:14:08] You didn't join your family. The mother
[1:14:10] b you.
[1:14:13] That's why you have the name that you
[1:14:15] have. You didn't come up on them. But
[1:14:17] could I join the Williams family, the
[1:14:20] Jones
[1:14:21] family? Permission, please, to join.
[1:14:26] Nobody did that. You were born.
[1:14:31] Therefore, you can't join God's family.
[1:14:36] Come on
[1:14:38] now. You got to be born of good.
[1:14:43] Born of
[1:14:49] good. Watch this is so powerful. He said
[1:14:53] when the baptism of the spirit is forcly
[1:14:56] took for a wafer in the Catholic church,
[1:14:59] a handshake in the Protestant church, in
[1:15:02] the Catholic church is a wafer. Hold
[1:15:03] that. Protestant church take
[1:15:06] that. Same thing. Mother have wafer.
[1:15:11] Daughter have shake
[1:15:13] hand. Listen to this. When the baptism
[1:15:16] of the spirit is falsely took over for
[1:15:19] wafer in the Catholic church, a
[1:15:20] handshake in the Protestant church,
[1:15:22] emotion in the Pentecostal church
[1:15:24] instead of the person of Christ. Here we
[1:15:28] go. coming in with all that pyramid
[1:15:31] building that we had. Hallelujah. Add to
[1:15:33] your faith virtue and so forth. Amen.
[1:15:36] And godliness and purity and holiness.
[1:15:39] And then you are sealed by the Holy
[1:15:40] Ghost. Hallelujah. So what he is saying,
[1:15:43] getting into the pyramid is getting into
[1:15:45] the church. That's the body of Christ.
[1:15:48] Not this building here. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:15:52] Oh, glory to God. What is it? We in
[1:15:56] Exodus. The first Exodus was a natural
[1:15:58] land to a natural land. The second
[1:16:00] Exodus from a spiritual condition into a
[1:16:02] spiritual baptism of the Holy Ghost. Now
[1:16:04] he's bringing them from a spiritual
[1:16:06] baptism of the Holy Ghost to the land of
[1:16:08] the millennium. Hallelujah. This is the
[1:16:10] last quote I believe. Yes. Last quote
[1:16:12] here. Wow. So we find out our message is
[1:16:15] today. The message we have is come out
[1:16:18] of Babylon and be free. Be filled with
[1:16:20] the spirit. Amen. Your lamb's trimmed
[1:16:22] and clear. Look up your redemption draw
[1:16:24] near. And yet in the midst of all of
[1:16:26] that, we don't have nothing against
[1:16:27] those people, those nominational people.
[1:16:30] They all right. They're fine. They are
[1:16:32] associates in the gospel because Jesus
[1:16:33] said, "No man can come except the father
[1:16:35] draws him." We are only responsible for
[1:16:37] sewing seeds. Some fell by the wayside.
[1:16:40] Some fell on different grounds. We just
[1:16:42] sewing seeds. Amen. May the Lord bless
[1:16:44] you. Let's stand. Hallelujah. As Bante
[1:16:47] will sing a song and you get an
[1:16:49] exportion and then we're going to have
[1:16:51] some time of prayer. Praise the Lord.
[1:16:52] Amen. Oh, blessed be the name of the
[1:16:54] Lord.
[1:16:57] Amen, many men. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:17:00] We appreciate the Lord this morning. We
[1:17:03] appreciate Pastor Top over this morning.
[1:17:06] Yet there is room. Oh, hallelujah. Why
[1:17:10] don't you turn around and greet your
[1:17:11] brother, greet your sister this morning.
[1:17:14] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:17:19] [Music]
[1:17:30] Are you in the church
[1:17:34] triumphant? Oh, are you in the Savior's
[1:17:39] breath? Oh, come and be baptized into
[1:17:45] the body.
[1:17:48] and
[1:17:52] forever. Are you in well? Are you in the
[1:17:57] church triumphant? Oh, and are you in?
[1:18:02] Oh, the Savior's bride. Come and do
[1:18:07] well. Come and be baptized into the body
[1:18:12] into the body and
[1:18:15] forever more
[1:18:18] above. Oh, have you been baptized into
[1:18:24] the body? Baptized with the Holy Ghost.
[1:18:27] Baptized with the Holy Ghost. Oh, there
[1:18:32] is but one way. There is but fun way to
[1:18:36] enter in it just as they did. Just as
[1:18:40] they
[1:18:43] did. Oh you
[1:18:47] highway. Oh the church
[1:18:50] triumpant. Oh and are you in the
[1:18:55] savior's bride. Come and be well. Come
[1:18:59] and be baptized into the Oh, into the
[1:19:05] body and
[1:19:07] forever more. Oh, one more time. Where
[1:19:15] you
[1:19:18] triumphant? Are you in the
[1:19:24] Savior's? Come and be baptized into the
[1:19:31] body and
[1:19:33] forever more of my for the last time.
[1:19:37] Oh, are you in the
[1:19:41] church
[1:19:42] triumphant?
[1:19:45] Oh, in the
[1:19:47] Savior's bride.
[1:19:51] Come and be baptized into the
[1:19:56] body. Oh, and
[1:19:59] forever more
[1:20:03] above. Can we give the Lord a hand of
[1:20:05] praise this morning? You appreciate the
[1:20:08] Lord this morning. You appreciate our
[1:20:10] pastor this morning. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:20:14] You may be seated for a few minutes. I'm
[1:20:18] not going to be long with you at all. We
[1:20:20] do have a prayer line right after this,
[1:20:24] but I do want to make some announcements
[1:20:25] once again. What can we say about our
[1:20:29] pastor? I really want to salute him for
[1:20:32] his burden, for his labor. And what can
[1:20:35] we say about brother Anthony with his
[1:20:37] exaltation last week, lessons from the
[1:20:40] pool of
[1:20:41] Bethesda. Then brother OIT spoke on let
[1:20:43] no man deceive you. And it's been every
[1:20:46] service going higher and higher and
[1:20:48] higher. It's good to be in the house of
[1:20:50] God. In a few hours, as brother said, at
[1:20:53] around 400 p.m. we are supposed to be in
[1:20:55] the airport.
[1:20:57] So, the desk keeps going higher and
[1:20:59] higher and higher and higher. Amen. So,
[1:21:02] but God is good. And uh so for this
[1:21:04] week, we will have service on Tuesday in
[1:21:06] Maraval. So, we encourage you to make uh
[1:21:10] the effort to be there. And then this
[1:21:12] weekend we have service on Friday at
[1:21:14] 5:00 p. p.m. and Sunday morning at 8:00
[1:21:18] a.m. Brother Waldron and his church will
[1:21:19] be here with us as well. So we are in
[1:21:21] expectations with God to do great
[1:21:24] things. And you know on this Palm Sunday
[1:21:27] we remember when Jesus rode into
[1:21:30] Jerusalem the city of
[1:21:32] peace and caused a disturbance.
[1:21:37] You know, he came against what was
[1:21:38] expected and there was ruction. You
[1:21:40] know, people woke up that morning
[1:21:41] thinking it was just like any other
[1:21:44] morning. And then they start to hear all
[1:21:45] kind of noise.
[1:21:47] And I don't know how many people were
[1:21:48] there when it started, but the noise
[1:21:50] just started to build and build until it
[1:21:52] start to pull out palms and I don't know
[1:21:54] if they ever did that before. So, it was
[1:21:56] not just that Jesus came into Jerusalem,
[1:21:58] but people found themselves doing things
[1:22:00] they had never done before. And I feel
[1:22:03] that's the season we are in right now.
[1:22:05] We are doing what we have never done
[1:22:07] before. What happened last week Sunday,
[1:22:10] we never did before. What's happening
[1:22:12] today, we never did before. Why? Because
[1:22:15] Jesus is riding into Jerusalem. Jesus is
[1:22:18] coming to see his people. He has
[1:22:20] something for you this morning. And I
[1:22:23] believe that this service, it's a
[1:22:25] deliverance service. It's a prayer line.
[1:22:27] And I believe the message has already
[1:22:29] gone forth. I don't think I have to
[1:22:31] preach anything to you, but I just want
[1:22:33] to encourage your faith because I
[1:22:35] believe that God is not going to leave
[1:22:37] you empty today. And I believe if you
[1:22:40] came in here this morning with sickness,
[1:22:42] with affliction, with mind problems, you
[1:22:44] came in this morning and you are
[1:22:46] backsliding, you are struggling, there
[1:22:48] is no reason for you to leave the same
[1:22:51] way you came this morning. If you came
[1:22:55] with desperation to receive the baptism
[1:22:58] of the Holy Ghost, there is no reason
[1:23:00] that you cannot leave with the baptism
[1:23:04] of the Holy Ghost. Because in Acts 19,
[1:23:07] when Paul laid hands on them, they
[1:23:09] didn't know about the Holy Ghost. But
[1:23:11] when he laid hands on them, they were
[1:23:13] filled with the Holy Ghost. So, we are
[1:23:16] on the word this morning to lay hands on
[1:23:19] the sick and see them recover. We are in
[1:23:23] the word this morning to lay hands on
[1:23:25] those who want the Holy Ghost and see
[1:23:27] the Holy Ghost pour out. We are on the
[1:23:29] word this morning because the time is
[1:23:32] here for you to receive your promise.
[1:23:34] Can the church say amen?
[1:23:37] So I am so excited this morning. Just
[1:23:40] before we read the scripture, let's just
[1:23:42] sing a song in F. Pass me
[1:23:44] not. Pass me not. Oh gently
[1:23:51] say
[1:23:54] [Music]
[1:23:59] hey my
[1:24:03] [Music]
[1:24:13] heart thorn.
[1:24:24] Oh, do not
[1:24:27] pass me
[1:24:30] by. One more time with your hands lifted
[1:24:32] from your heart now. Make it your prayer
[1:24:34] right now.
[1:24:37] Pass me not, oh
[1:24:41] gentle savior. Today, today is your day
[1:24:45] for deliverance.
[1:24:47] Oh
[1:24:50] yeah. My
[1:24:54] humble
[1:24:56] cry.
[1:24:57] Hallelujah.
[1:25:00] Oh,
[1:25:03] why
[1:25:05] another thou my calling? He's calling
[1:25:08] somebody this morning. He's calling
[1:25:11] somebody this morning.
[1:25:13] Oh, you
[1:25:15] to not
[1:25:17] pass me
[1:25:20] by. Blessed Savior all over the
[1:25:24] building. Let's just sing it now. Oh,
[1:25:28] save
[1:25:31] our
[1:25:33] [Applause]
[1:25:40] sing. I
[1:25:42] [Music]
[1:25:44] humble
[1:25:46] cry.
[1:25:49] Oh, oh,
[1:25:53] I
[1:25:54] love thou art
[1:25:58] calling,
[1:25:59] calling, calling. You're calling me this
[1:26:03] morning
[1:26:05] to not
[1:26:07] pass
[1:26:09] me.
[1:26:11] Do not
[1:26:13] pass me. Won't
[1:26:17] do not
[1:26:19] pass me. Just say that.
[1:26:24] Do not
[1:26:26] pass me. One more time.
[1:26:30] to not pass. That's my prayer today.
[1:26:34] Lord,
[1:26:36] do not
[1:26:38] pass
[1:26:40] me
[1:26:43] by. Can we bow our heads in a word of
[1:26:46] prayer?
[1:26:48] Heavenly Father, as we approach this
[1:26:50] second part of the
[1:26:51] service and prepare for the prayer line,
[1:26:55] Lord, Lord, as I look all through the
[1:26:57] building today, we see people, Lord, who
[1:26:59] have come with
[1:27:01] needs, all kinds of needs, Father. And
[1:27:04] Lord, you are the God who could meet
[1:27:07] needs. Lord, they haven't come to hear
[1:27:10] from me. They haven't come to hear from
[1:27:11] a man, but they come to be ministered to
[1:27:14] by the angel of the Lord, the angel of
[1:27:17] the covenant or Holy Ghost himself,
[1:27:19] Lord. And I believe, Lord, that Lord,
[1:27:22] the atmosphere is right for the
[1:27:23] miraculous to take place today, Lord,
[1:27:26] for the next few minutes, Father, may
[1:27:28] you take my thoughts out completely and
[1:27:30] may you speak lip to ear to your
[1:27:32] children, Lord. They are your people.
[1:27:35] Father, use me as your instrument this
[1:27:37] morning. Anoint the ministers and the
[1:27:39] elders, Father, for the prayer line.
[1:27:41] Anoint the people today, Lord, that
[1:27:44] today would be a day of breakthrough, a
[1:27:46] day of release, a day of deliverance. If
[1:27:49] there's any sinners in the house today,
[1:27:51] may they repent today, Lord, and ask to
[1:27:54] be baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:27:56] Jesus Christ. If there's any backsliders
[1:27:59] in the house this morning, Father God,
[1:28:01] may the Lord, the angel of the Lord,
[1:28:04] convict them today, Lord, that they will
[1:28:07] look no more back, but they would look
[1:28:09] forward unto Calvary. Father, may you
[1:28:11] break every chain, break every shackle,
[1:28:14] house of hell, give way to the name of
[1:28:17] Jesus Christ. We serve notice today for
[1:28:21] every sickness, every disease, mind
[1:28:24] battle, frustration, demons of lust,
[1:28:27] demons of alcohol, demons of whatever it
[1:28:30] is, filth and ungodliness. We serve
[1:28:33] notice this morning in the name of Jesus
[1:28:36] Christ. Satan, you are finished this
[1:28:39] morning among these people. These are
[1:28:41] the sons and daughters of the living
[1:28:43] God. Almighty God, may you move through
[1:28:46] the camp. May you stir every heart. May
[1:28:50] you stir your people this morning. May
[1:28:52] you bless the reading of the word. And
[1:28:54] may you get glory in the precious name
[1:28:56] of Jesus Christ. We pray. And the church
[1:28:59] says, and the church says,
[1:29:03] amen. Thank you musicians. Can we just
[1:29:06] go to two portions of scripture reading
[1:29:08] from the book of St.
[1:29:09] Luke 4 and reading from verse 14 and
[1:29:14] reading from
[1:29:15] Revelation chapter 10 reading one verse
[1:29:18] there verse
[1:29:32] 7 reading St. Luke chapter 4 and reading
[1:29:36] verse 14. And Jesus returned in the
[1:29:40] power of the spirit into Galilee. And
[1:29:42] there went out of fame of him through
[1:29:46] all the region
[1:29:47] roundabout. And he taught in their
[1:29:49] synagogues being glorified of all. And
[1:29:52] he came to Nazareth where he had been
[1:29:54] brought
[1:29:55] up. And as his custom was, he went into
[1:29:59] the synagogue on the Sabbath day and
[1:30:02] stood up for to read. And there was
[1:30:04] delivered unto him the book of the
[1:30:06] prophet Isaiah. And when he had opened
[1:30:08] the book, he found the place where it
[1:30:11] was written, "The spirit of the Lord is
[1:30:13] upon me, because he hath anointed me to
[1:30:16] preach the gospel to the poor. He had
[1:30:19] sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to
[1:30:22] preach deliverance to the captives and
[1:30:24] recovering of sight to the blind, to set
[1:30:27] at liberty them that are bruised, to
[1:30:30] preach the acceptable year of the Lord.
[1:30:34] And I want to go on to two more verses.
[1:30:35] And he closed the book, and he gave it
[1:30:38] again to the minister, and sat down. And
[1:30:40] the eyes of all them that were in the
[1:30:42] synagogue were fastened on him. And he
[1:30:45] began to say unto them, "This day is
[1:30:48] this scripture fulfilled in your ears."
[1:30:52] And reading from the book of Revelation
[1:30:54] chapter 10 and reading 1 verse verse
[1:30:59] 7. But in the days of the voice of the
[1:31:02] seventh angel, when he shall begin to
[1:31:05] sound, the mystery of God should be
[1:31:07] finished as he had declared to his
[1:31:10] servants the prophets. May the Lord add
[1:31:13] a blessing to the reading of his word.
[1:31:15] You may be seated for a few
[1:31:17] minutes just to encourage you before the
[1:31:19] prayer line this morning. So for a title
[1:31:23] this morning, the
[1:31:25] mystery of God and my inspiration this
[1:31:30] day this
[1:31:32] scripture is fulfilled.
[1:31:35] You know brother Oid really blessed me
[1:31:37] and as he was speaking he was speaking
[1:31:39] about Christ and it's all about Christ
[1:31:42] and in the message brother Brandon
[1:31:44] preached Christ is the mystery of God
[1:31:46] revealed he said now God had a purpose
[1:31:49] and a hidden mystery and that's what I
[1:31:51] want to speak on to the church this
[1:31:53] morning the hidden mystery of God that
[1:31:56] he had in his mind before the world ever
[1:31:58] began and how it's unfolding itself
[1:32:02] right down to this present hour that
[1:32:04] we're living Then you'll understand
[1:32:06] clearly then I believe what is being
[1:32:09] done. And brother Brandham goes on to
[1:32:11] say now a scholar could read the Bible
[1:32:13] the word till he can just tie your mind
[1:32:15] up in any way if he wants to do it
[1:32:19] because he is smart brilliant. Get a
[1:32:21] Catholic priest or not so much as that
[1:32:24] as a real good trained theologian in the
[1:32:26] Bible brother a Baptist or a
[1:32:28] Presbyterian or something. He'll make
[1:32:30] you think you don't know nothing when it
[1:32:33] comes to talk. See, because he has known
[1:32:36] him in the flesh, brother Brandham said,
[1:32:37] and he pats his Bible. But the only way
[1:32:40] you are saved is by know him by
[1:32:43] revelation.
[1:32:45] But the Brandham goes on. He said, I can
[1:32:47] take the Presbyterian doctrine and tie
[1:32:50] you Pentecostals till you won't know. I
[1:32:53] can take the Baptist doctrine and show
[1:32:55] you Pentecostals a million things you
[1:32:58] know nothing of. That's right. But
[1:33:00] that's not it. That's not his church.
[1:33:03] That's not his church. His church is
[1:33:05] himself revealed and expressed by the
[1:33:08] word. Now I'm going somewhere. We're
[1:33:12] talking about the mystery of God. Now
[1:33:15] this world is full of mysteries. This
[1:33:17] very world itself is a mystery. To this
[1:33:20] day, scientists are still trying to
[1:33:22] figure out some of the mysteries in this
[1:33:24] world.
[1:33:27] Everything that cannot be explained is a
[1:33:30] mystery. Brother Brandon said, "A
[1:33:32] mystery is something that was previously
[1:33:34] hid but is now divinely revealed." God
[1:33:37] was a mystery, but he wanted to express
[1:33:40] himself. He was bigger than everything,
[1:33:43] powerful than everything. He was
[1:33:45] everything itself, but he had to find a
[1:33:47] way to express the magnitude of this
[1:33:51] mystery. Books can't write enough about
[1:33:54] it. Movies can be made about it. You
[1:33:57] can't build buildings because it's too
[1:33:59] great of a mystery.
[1:34:04] The mystery was so big that God took
[1:34:06] centuries and centuries and piece by
[1:34:09] piece he was trying to get this mystery
[1:34:13] out to people because he didn't want to
[1:34:15] be complicated. He didn't want to be
[1:34:17] misunderstood. He didn't want to be
[1:34:19] unapproachable. He wanted to be
[1:34:21] approached. He wanted anybody to talk to
[1:34:24] him. But when he was all by himself,
[1:34:26] there was nobody to talk to him. So he
[1:34:28] had to find a way to take this
[1:34:31] mystery, the mystery of God, and bring
[1:34:34] it into simplicity. Are you with me this
[1:34:38] [Applause]
[1:34:39] morning? You may be seated.
[1:34:42] Brother Brandham said when David was
[1:34:45] living and when Abraham was living and
[1:34:48] when Moses was living, brother Brandham
[1:34:50] said they had no idea what they were
[1:34:53] living out.
[1:34:57] Let me say that again. God spoke to
[1:34:59] Moses and Moses went and did what he
[1:35:02] did, but he still had no idea what he
[1:35:06] was doing. I got to say that again.
[1:35:09] David as a shepherd. God spoke to him.
[1:35:12] God called him. And when David died, he
[1:35:15] died not even knowing what he was about.
[1:35:20] Because brother Brandham said David was
[1:35:22] just a shadow revealing the mystery. So
[1:35:26] David as a shepherd, he was not just a
[1:35:28] shepherd, but there was a great shepherd
[1:35:30] that was coming. and Moses and David
[1:35:32] rather was that little mystery being
[1:35:34] spoke about just a shepherd attribute of
[1:35:37] God's nature God as a deliverer he
[1:35:41] couldn't just express all of that so he
[1:35:43] found Moses and say Moses you are going
[1:35:46] to express this mystery of deliverance
[1:35:49] that I have David you are going to
[1:35:52] express the shepherd that I am Joshua
[1:35:55] you're going to express the warrior that
[1:35:58] I am somebody preach to me Elijah, you
[1:36:02] will express the prophet that I am. Come
[1:36:04] on
[1:36:06] now. Somebody with me. Daniel, you will
[1:36:10] express the scribe that I am. Paul, you
[1:36:13] will express the apostle that I am. But
[1:36:16] everyone was expressing a part of the
[1:36:20] mystery of
[1:36:23] God. You may be seated.
[1:36:27] So I want to say something.
[1:36:31] Hallelujah. There's a difference when
[1:36:33] it's part of the mystery and it's the
[1:36:36] fullness of the mystery. So up until the
[1:36:39] Old Testament, all of the scriptures
[1:36:42] compounded, it was just part part. But
[1:36:45] when Jesus stepped out, it was not part
[1:36:48] of the mystery because Jesus Christ was
[1:36:52] the mystery of God revealed in his
[1:36:55] fullness.
[1:36:59] You may be seated.
[1:37:05] We are going somewhere this morning.
[1:37:07] So you are here this morning and that's
[1:37:10] why sometimes young people sometimes it
[1:37:14] feels like your life is so confusing and
[1:37:17] it's so mysterious because you haven't
[1:37:19] in seen the fullness of the mystery of
[1:37:22] who you are because brother Brandham
[1:37:24] said the mystery of who you are is also
[1:37:25] a secret because you are part of God
[1:37:28] that mystery gene you also carry that
[1:37:31] mystery gene. So when you were saved,
[1:37:33] that is only part of the mystery. When
[1:37:36] you are here this morning, that's only
[1:37:38] part of the mystery. When you are filled
[1:37:40] with the Holy Ghost, that also is part
[1:37:42] of the mystery. There's coming a time
[1:37:45] when you will manifest the fullness of
[1:37:47] the mystery of who you are. And when
[1:37:49] people see you, it'll be Christ in you,
[1:37:52] the hope of glory, because Christ is the
[1:37:55] mystery of God revealed.
[1:38:01] You may be seated. Oh, somebody say
[1:38:04] amen. So, what are we here to do this
[1:38:07] morning? We are here to give you a
[1:38:09] snapshot into who you really are. We are
[1:38:12] here for revelation because only
[1:38:14] revelation could show you who you are.
[1:38:17] The pastor cannot show you who you are.
[1:38:19] The minister cannot show you who you
[1:38:21] are. But if you get a revelation,
[1:38:23] because a mystery is something that was
[1:38:26] previously hid but now divinely
[1:38:29] revealed. So we are looking for divine
[1:38:32] revelation so that when you walk through
[1:38:34] the prayer line you are just not just
[1:38:37] going through a prayer line but you are
[1:38:39] coming with divine revelation that you
[1:38:41] are an attribute son of God attribute
[1:38:44] daughter of
[1:38:45] God. You may be
[1:38:48] seated. You might be living in sin.
[1:38:51] That's part of the mystery because you
[1:38:54] don't even know fully who you are.
[1:38:55] You're not hearing me this morning. You
[1:38:57] might be going through depression.
[1:38:59] That's only part of the mystery because
[1:39:01] who you really are can't be revealed
[1:39:03] just yet because God doesn't even want
[1:39:05] the devil to know who the bride is
[1:39:08] because she has to be a secret. So all
[1:39:10] your situations, all your past, all your
[1:39:14] mistakes, all of your ups and downs,
[1:39:16] it's all a great mystery that God
[1:39:18] created to allow you to happen.
[1:39:21] Something on the inside that nobody
[1:39:24] could see. Not one of these days uh you
[1:39:26] will be able to say this day this
[1:39:29] scripture is fulfilled.
[1:39:37] [Applause]
[1:39:45] I'm not going to be much longer with
[1:39:47] you.
[1:39:49] Hallelujah.
[1:39:51] When you wake up to go to work, that's a
[1:39:53] part of the mystery. You are living out
[1:39:56] something. When you pay the bills,
[1:39:58] that's just part of the mystery because
[1:40:00] you got to have a roof over your head.
[1:40:02] You got to eat. But that's not who you
[1:40:04] really are. There's a mystery behind
[1:40:06] that flesh, man. There's a mystery
[1:40:08] behind your mind. There's a mystery
[1:40:09] inside of your soul. And that's why when
[1:40:11] the parent said, you are not even the
[1:40:13] believer, but the word in you is the
[1:40:15] believer. So, you didn't come here this
[1:40:18] morning, but the seed in you is fighting
[1:40:20] to express
[1:40:24] himself. David couldn't explain why he
[1:40:27] acted that way. And we preached it a
[1:40:29] while back and after all of his
[1:40:31] mistakes, God still said, "That's a man
[1:40:33] after my own heart." Because David was
[1:40:36] expressing attributes that were part of
[1:40:38] God. So even in your up and down, you
[1:40:41] are expressing attributes that are part
[1:40:43] of God because you are from the same
[1:40:45] genetic structure as your father and no
[1:40:48] devil in hell could stop it. That's why
[1:40:50] we can say this morning, you are going
[1:40:52] to be healed. You are going to get a
[1:40:54] Holy Ghost. You are going to be adopted.
[1:40:56] You are going to be manifested sons of
[1:41:02] God. Hallelujah. I'm not going to be too
[1:41:05] much longer with you. Brother Brandon
[1:41:07] said, "What is it?" The mystery of God.
[1:41:11] Then he says it here, "Is God in you,
[1:41:13] the hope of glory shining forth the
[1:41:16] baptism of the Holy Ghost." He said,
[1:41:18] "When these things take place, time
[1:41:21] shall be no more." So when we hear about
[1:41:23] time shall be no more, God is just
[1:41:25] waiting for the manifestation of the
[1:41:27] sons of God, waiting for this season
[1:41:30] when you will come to full realization
[1:41:32] of who you are.
[1:41:35] Yes, sir. Now, let me drop something in
[1:41:37] there. Jesus is born, he's growing up,
[1:41:43] working with his father. He's with his
[1:41:45] family. They think he's all normal.
[1:41:48] No wonder when Jesus is going around,
[1:41:50] they say, "Is this not Joseph's son?"
[1:41:52] Because they knew Joseph's son. But what
[1:41:55] Jesus was displaying was a little
[1:41:57] different from what Joseph's son was.
[1:42:00] You don't hear me this morning? Jesus
[1:42:02] wasn't in church that day for the first
[1:42:04] time. He was in the synagogue, the Bible
[1:42:06] says, as was his custom. So, he was
[1:42:08] always in church, but they never really
[1:42:10] paid attention to him because he was
[1:42:12] just walking like everybody, shaking
[1:42:14] everybody's hands and doing everything
[1:42:16] else like everybody else. It was his
[1:42:18] custom. He was always in church. But
[1:42:21] that day was
[1:42:23] different. That day was different. And I
[1:42:26] believe this day is different. There's
[1:42:28] somebody this morning who's going to get
[1:42:30] a revelation of who God is, who they
[1:42:33] are, who the devil is, and realize that
[1:42:35] that demon of cancer, that demon of
[1:42:38] arthritis, that demon of female
[1:42:40] condition, that demon of high blood
[1:42:42] pressure, low blood pressure, high
[1:42:45] sugar, low sugar, mind battle, that
[1:42:48] demon has got to go because there's no
[1:42:51] legal right for that demon to be in your
[1:42:53] body. that sin, that condemnation, that
[1:42:57] lust, that unbelief that has got to go
[1:43:00] because you are realizing who you are.
[1:43:03] And when the devil asks you a question,
[1:43:04] you can look the devil in the face and
[1:43:07] say, "This day, this scripture is
[1:43:13] fulfilled." You may be seated.
[1:43:16] Hallelujah. Brother Brandham said it
[1:43:18] like this. He said every scripture in
[1:43:20] the Old Testament was pointing to Jesus
[1:43:23] Christ.
[1:43:25] And I'll give you another example. When
[1:43:26] Isaiah said, "A virgin shall conceive,"
[1:43:29] that was scripture. That was word. It
[1:43:32] was spoken. But it had to wait until the
[1:43:34] body came for that scripture to be
[1:43:36] manifested. So people could look at it
[1:43:38] as scripture. But when God opened the
[1:43:41] book, he wasn't seeing scripture. He was
[1:43:43] seeing names.
[1:43:45] [Music]
[1:43:46] I don't think you got me.
[1:43:48] Brother Brandham said God is coming for
[1:43:50] the book, the book of redemption. He
[1:43:52] said it's a book of names.
[1:43:55] [Applause]
[1:43:56] We see the book as scripture and God is
[1:43:58] seeing the book as names. So when Isaiah
[1:44:01] say a virgin shall conceive, that's in
[1:44:03] your book. In his book, he seeing Mary.
[1:44:06] It's a book of names and he's coming for
[1:44:08] the book of names. When the book said a
[1:44:11] voice of one crying in the wilderness,
[1:44:13] that's in your book. But in his book,
[1:44:15] that's John.
[1:44:18] Brother Brandham said, "When the Bible
[1:44:20] says the people that know their God
[1:44:22] shall do exploits, that's in your book."
[1:44:25] But in his book, he's seeing George
[1:44:27] Kangali. He is seeing Joshua. He is
[1:44:30] seeing Gideon. He is seeing your name.
[1:44:32] And he's coming for your names
[1:44:40] to
[1:44:41] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory to God.
[1:44:45] That's a revelation to you, church. Uh
[1:44:47] it's not just words. It's your name. Uh
[1:44:50] the words in the book. Uh you are not a
[1:44:52] believer. The word in you is a believer.
[1:44:55] You are going to be filled. You are
[1:44:57] going to receive the Holy Ghost. And
[1:44:58] don't care what the devil tells you,
[1:45:00] he's coming for
[1:45:03] you. You may be seated for a moment. You
[1:45:06] may be seated for a moment.
[1:45:09] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:45:12] [Applause]
[1:45:16] Hallelujah.
[1:45:17] For the backsliders in here this
[1:45:19] morning, the book
[1:45:22] said in Joel that in the last day I'll
[1:45:25] poured my spirit upon all flesh.
[1:45:29] That's the words in the book. Peter came
[1:45:32] and say this is that which was spoken by
[1:45:35] the prophet Joel. So Peter was the words
[1:45:38] in the book. I want to make mention of
[1:45:41] something friends. Peter didn't know he
[1:45:44] was the word in the book. When Peter was
[1:45:46] denying Christ, he was still the words
[1:45:49] in the book.
[1:45:52] You don't hear what I'm saying? Peter
[1:45:54] said he made mistakes. Peter say, "I
[1:45:57] don't know this Jesus." But Jesus wasn't
[1:45:59] looking at that. It's the word in the
[1:46:01] book. It was going to take some time for
[1:46:04] Peter to get a revelation, a divine
[1:46:06] revelation of the mystery of who he was.
[1:46:09] But what he did didn't change his name
[1:46:12] in the
[1:46:13] [Applause]
[1:46:15] book. Everybody should be on their feet.
[1:46:18] Everybody should be shouting your
[1:46:20] mistakes, your past, your failures, what
[1:46:24] they say about you doesn't change the
[1:46:26] words in the
[1:46:29] book. Hallelujah. So when my Bible tells
[1:46:33] me there'll be a manifestation of the
[1:46:35] sons of God to God, that's not words. He
[1:46:38] is seeing you coming out of your
[1:46:40] condition, coming out of your
[1:46:42] depression, coming out of the world,
[1:46:44] coming out of sin, coming out of your
[1:46:46] past and being adopted, being perfected.
[1:46:49] Can the church say amen?
[1:46:55] [Applause]
[1:47:03] Hallelujah. You could begin to play
[1:47:05] something softly.
[1:47:08] As the deacons begin to get ready for
[1:47:10] the prayer
[1:47:12] line, I don't think not much more needs
[1:47:15] to be said, friends. God is here.
[1:47:19] But it depends on your attitude this
[1:47:21] morning. Brother said, "The right mental
[1:47:25] attitude towards any divine promise of
[1:47:29] God will bring it to
[1:47:31] pass." What's your attitude this
[1:47:35] morning? Did you just come because it's
[1:47:37] a service or a special service? Or did
[1:47:40] you come because you realize that the
[1:47:42] needs in your life are more than you
[1:47:46] could bear?
[1:47:48] The needs in your life could only be
[1:47:50] fixed by God
[1:47:53] himself. You have to come to that
[1:47:55] awareness. You have to come to that
[1:47:57] conclusion. You have to come to that
[1:47:59] position
[1:48:01] yourself. I'm not talking to groups.
[1:48:05] Brother Oid made it clear. It's to the
[1:48:06] individual. So if your brother doesn't
[1:48:09] want it, your father doesn't want it,
[1:48:11] your wife doesn't want it, you got to
[1:48:14] know why you are coming into the prayer
[1:48:17] line
[1:48:19] today. You have to know what your need
[1:48:22] is. You have to know what you are
[1:48:24] struggling with. And you have to come
[1:48:26] knowing that God is able
[1:48:30] to heal you, to deliver you. He promised
[1:48:34] to restore you. He promised good health.
[1:48:37] He said, "If my people will humble
[1:48:39] themselves and
[1:48:40] pray, seek my face, and turn from their
[1:48:43] wicked ways, they will hear from heaven.
[1:48:46] I will heal their
[1:48:48] land." That scripture is just as real
[1:48:51] today as when it was first written.
[1:48:55] And when God says my people, that's
[1:48:57] words to people who read it on the
[1:48:59] outside, but to God, he is seeing you
[1:49:02] being reconciled to himself. Part of
[1:49:06] this great mystery of God.
[1:49:10] I believe there are sons in here this
[1:49:12] morning. There are daughters in here
[1:49:13] this morning. You have not been living
[1:49:15] right. You come through this line with
[1:49:18] true
[1:49:20] repentance, with a contrite heart, with
[1:49:23] a desire to not go back and do what you
[1:49:26] did
[1:49:27] before. But the Brandon said,
[1:49:28] "Repentance is not just saying, "I'm
[1:49:30] sorry." It's a turn away from what you
[1:49:33] used to do. That desire must be real in
[1:49:37] your heart. He promised to put a mark
[1:49:40] upon all those who sigh and cry for the
[1:49:42] abomination in the city.
[1:49:45] [Music]
[1:49:47] When you come through this line this
[1:49:49] morning, God give us a sigh. Give us a
[1:49:54] cry. Let it not be just for a show. Let
[1:49:58] it not just be just for an occasion, but
[1:50:00] let it be for a reality. God, I cannot
[1:50:03] live anymore without a personal
[1:50:07] experience with the Holy Ghost itself. I
[1:50:10] don't want to face tonight. I don't want
[1:50:12] to face tomorrow. I don't want to face
[1:50:13] my boss. I don't want to face my job. I
[1:50:16] don't want to face my wife. I don't want
[1:50:17] to face my husband. I don't want to face
[1:50:19] life without a personal
[1:50:22] experience with God.
[1:50:25] I'm not talking about coming to church,
[1:50:27] signing up for church. I'm talking about
[1:50:29] being identified by Christ in you. The
[1:50:33] hope of glory, revelation, and
[1:50:35] experience and encounter with God. fire
[1:50:38] in your soul to burn out all the sin, to
[1:50:43] burn out the lust, to burn
[1:50:46] out. David cried out. He said, "Lord,
[1:50:49] restore unto me the joy of my
[1:50:54] salvation. I haven't lost my salvation,
[1:50:56] but God, I lost the
[1:50:59] joy. My prayer life is not what it's
[1:51:01] supposed to
[1:51:03] be. Lord, I've not been spending time on
[1:51:06] you. I've been so caught up in my own
[1:51:08] world and my own things and my own
[1:51:10] desires. I've I've completely lost
[1:51:12] myself. But this morning, God, I'm
[1:51:14] coming back home. It's a homecoming
[1:51:17] service. May we be like a prodigal son
[1:51:20] this morning and come to our senses. The
[1:51:24] Bible said he came to his senses. May
[1:51:27] each one of us, I'm including myself in
[1:51:29] that this morning, friends. God, I want
[1:51:31] to come to my senses. I want a closer
[1:51:34] walk with thee. I want a real walk with
[1:51:36] you. I just want to be a church member,
[1:51:39] but I want an experience in my soul. I
[1:51:41] don't want to know God from hearing what
[1:51:43] other people said, but I want to know
[1:51:45] him for
[1:51:47] myself. For myself.
[1:51:51] Can we bow our heads in a word of
[1:51:52] prayer? As the elders get ready for the
[1:51:56] prayer
[1:51:58] line, can we bow our heads? Hallelujah.
[1:52:02] Heavenly Father, as we approach your
[1:52:04] throne of
[1:52:05] grace, Lord, we pray you
[1:52:08] forgive our
[1:52:10] sins, forgive our past, Lord, where we
[1:52:13] have fallen, where we have made
[1:52:16] mistakes, Lord. The things that we are
[1:52:18] supposed to do that we have not done,
[1:52:20] Lord, we repent. Things that we have
[1:52:22] done that we should not do, Lord, we
[1:52:24] repent this morning. Lord, we lay our
[1:52:28] lives down at your feet. We prostrate
[1:52:31] our lives before your august presence
[1:52:34] this morning. It's only through blood we
[1:52:37] could be here this morning. Only through
[1:52:39] your grace we could be here, Lord. And
[1:52:42] as the church of the living God, we
[1:52:44] submit ourselves to the Holy Ghost right
[1:52:47] now, Lord. You are in charge. We turn it
[1:52:50] over, Lord, completely to you, Lord, for
[1:52:52] what you want to do with each one. Lord,
[1:52:55] it's an open door this morning. The Holy
[1:52:57] Ghost is that open door, God. We all
[1:53:00] come to you this morning. May you heal
[1:53:03] your people. May you touch. May you
[1:53:04] deliver. May you break the chains. Lord,
[1:53:07] those have been struggling for many
[1:53:09] years. As brother Anthony spoke last
[1:53:11] week, for 38 years, he had been coming,
[1:53:14] but the day has come of will thou be
[1:53:17] made whole. We commit the prayer line
[1:53:19] into your hands. We commit the believers
[1:53:22] into your hands. We commit the ministers
[1:53:24] and elders into your hands in the name
[1:53:27] of Jesus Christ and the church says
[1:53:31] amen and amen. Remain seated, remain in
[1:53:34] the spirit and the deacons will usher
[1:53:38] you to the line. Brother
[1:53:49] Anthony
[1:53:54] [Music]

[1:54:15] me. I sing to you.
