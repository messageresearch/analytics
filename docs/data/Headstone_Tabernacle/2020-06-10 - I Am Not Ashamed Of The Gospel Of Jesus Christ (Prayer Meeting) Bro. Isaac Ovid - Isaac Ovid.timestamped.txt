[8:32] you thank you brother Anthony god bless
[8:35] you and good evening friends and
[8:36] certainly a great privilege to be here
[8:40] tonight one more time gathered in his
[8:43] presence God in his will and his purpose
[8:46] because we have to believe it's his
[8:49] purpose for us to be here tonight so
[8:51] that we can continue to grow and to be
[8:54] drawn closer to him and we're certainly
[8:57] grateful for another opportunity for
[8:59] another space of Greece and it is a
[9:02] sacrifice a sacrifice of fries a
[9:04] sacrifice of worship a sacrifice to come
[9:07] together to pray and to be dedicated I'm
[9:11] consecrated to God and so but over Laxmi
[9:16] obviously we spoken of as you know a
[9:18] little bit wasn't feeling too well so I
[9:20] by the grace of God have to step up to
[9:23] the plate so tonight if you have your
[9:26] Bibles I want to touch three portions of
[9:29] Scripture tonight just a word of
[9:32] encouragement as we approach a prime
[9:35] meeting tonight and this season that
[9:37] we're living in and looking at what's
[9:40] transpiring around the world so I want
[9:45] to read from the book of Jael tonight
[9:46] the book of Saint Mark and finally the
[9:50] book of Romans tonight three portions of
[9:53] scripture just to bring a sort of
[9:56] encouragement to us and to strengthen us
[10:00] along the journey so Joelle - a very
[10:02] familiar portion of Scripture and just
[10:05] before I really just bow our heads for
[10:08] word of Prayer Heavenly Father we thank
[10:09] you tonight Lord that we could have this
[10:12] virtual service as it were this Lord
[10:15] this time of coming together on you
[10:18] would again around your scriptures
[10:20] around this prophetic message of this
[10:23] our law that gives us confidence and
[10:25] bonus and safety and security when
[10:28] others have no hope father we stand with
[10:30] hope when others have no assurance we
[10:33] stand with assurance tonight Lord may
[10:34] you take me out of the way Lord may you
[10:37] touch my body as well and anyone else
[10:39] that needs are touched and I
[10:40] remember our past in a special way and
[10:42] all the different situations in the
[10:44] church Lord and the different believers
[10:46] Lord the diverse conditions Lord
[10:50] physical or whatever the situation may
[10:53] be father we bring it under your blood
[10:54] tonight Lord I we thank you for your
[10:56] grace that is sufficient for us Lord we
[10:59] could Lord stand boldly Lord in your
[11:02] presence Lord and lay our lives at your
[11:04] feet Lord looking for a touch from You
[11:06] Lord may you inspire a reading of the
[11:09] word and the opening of our
[11:10] understanding to your scriptures tonight
[11:12] may you encourage us along the way may
[11:14] you bless those that already here
[11:16] tonight those that would join us Lord me
[11:18] you bless those that couldn't make it
[11:20] for some reason and may you be with us
[11:22] tonight in the precious name of Jesus
[11:23] Christ amen and amen so I want to read
[11:26] from Joelle - and from verse 23 be glad
[11:29] then each turn of Zion and rejoice in
[11:32] the Lord your God for he has given you
[11:34] the former in moderately and he will
[11:37] cause to come down for you Doreen the
[11:40] former rain and the latter rain in the
[11:42] first month and the floors shall be full
[11:44] of wheats and the fats shall overflow
[11:47] with wine and oil and I will restore to
[11:50] you the years that the locusts have
[11:52] eaten the canker womb and the
[11:54] caterpillar and the Palmer will my great
[11:56] army which I sent among you and he shall
[11:59] eaten plenty and be satisfied and praise
[12:02] the name of the Lord your God that had
[12:05] dealt one justly with you and my people
[12:08] shall never be ashamed and he shall know
[12:11] that I am in the midst of Israel and
[12:13] that I am the Lord your God and not else
[12:15] I'm my people shall never be ashamed I
[12:18] want us to notice there that both verses
[12:20] 26 and 27 and will be a very same wood
[12:25] structure of my people shall never be
[12:29] ashamed and I want to go now to see in
[12:31] mark it and reading from verse 34 st.
[12:35] mark it and reading from verse 34 and
[12:38] when he had called the people unto Him
[12:41] with his disciples also he said unto
[12:44] them whosoever come after me and this is
[12:47] a real challenge to us as Christians you
[12:50] know many times we want to come
[12:53] our we we want to do things do we we
[12:56] want to do things but here it is Jesus
[12:59] is challenging both the people who were
[13:02] they as well as his disciples so it was
[13:03] not a message that was directed to just
[13:06] a people but along with his disciples
[13:08] he's saying when he had called the
[13:11] people unto Him with his disciples also
[13:13] he said unto them collectively whosoever
[13:16] shall come after me let him deny himself
[13:19] and take up his cross and follow me so
[13:24] firstly we see here there has to be a
[13:26] denial of self to be able to follow
[13:29] there has to be a denial of self and a
[13:32] taking up of a cross there has to be a
[13:35] sacrifice and it is not just denying
[13:38] yourself it is taking up the cross so
[13:40] there's a new burden so there's a
[13:42] sacrifice there's also a burden and now
[13:44] there's a command to follow so that we
[13:46] three things there if you want to come
[13:48] after me and many times I would have
[13:50] said this in a previous meeting that
[13:52] many times we we glaze over these
[13:54] scriptures I mean reading scriptures and
[13:56] we don't really stop to process the
[13:59] words so I want to take it slowly
[14:01] whosoever shall come after me and I
[14:03] believe tonight everyone in this room
[14:05] wants to come after him we are not here
[14:08] coming after man and and if you have
[14:10] been around for some time you know how
[14:12] much we preach against following man so
[14:15] we talked about coming after Jesus and
[14:16] Jesus basically say if you want to come
[14:19] after me there are three things that
[14:22] that you must do you must deny yourself
[14:27] you must take up his cross and you must
[14:30] follow me three different things three
[14:33] different behaviors three different
[14:35] expectations three different challenges
[14:38] and we have to contend with on a daily
[14:41] basis how much have you denied yourself
[14:44] today have you taken up the cross today
[14:48] and did you follow him today but let's
[14:50] go on for whosoever shall save his life
[14:53] shall lose it
[14:54] and many of us we're trying to save our
[14:57] lives you can save our alive with our
[14:58] efforts we're trying to do things that
[15:01] we think will advance us we're trying to
[15:03] do things that we think will help us
[15:07] make progress we're trying to do things
[15:09] that we think will actually help us and
[15:12] go to seeing here in Scripture whosoever
[15:15] will save his life so our efforts to
[15:18] save ourselves we will lose it but
[15:21] whoever shall lose his life for my sake
[15:24] understand again sticking it slowly it's
[15:27] not just lose your life but for his sake
[15:29] because many people lose their way and
[15:31] it's not for his sake but whosoever
[15:33] shall lose his life for my sake and the
[15:35] Gospels the same shall save it and then
[15:40] a great compelling question for what
[15:43] shall it profit a man if he shall gain
[15:45] the whole world and lose his own soul
[15:48] these are deep rooted questions that
[15:51] Jesus is asking because in our doing and
[15:54] in our going and in our coming and in
[15:57] our living it is easy for people to have
[16:00] a desire to gain the whole world or the
[16:04] part of the world that we think is
[16:05] valuable to us and Jesus is challenging
[16:08] us what shall it profit if you give all
[16:11] of your ambitions you go all the targets
[16:13] and don't tell me you don't have goals
[16:15] and ambitions and targets you wake up in
[16:17] the morning with the desire to do
[16:18] something in doing that something that
[16:21] gaining of that activity
[16:22] don't lose your soul and then he puts it
[16:25] another way in other words he's saying
[16:27] in other words or what shall a man give
[16:29] in exchange for his soul and coming to
[16:32] these meetings is us giving something
[16:35] finding out something doing something
[16:37] because we value our soul I truly
[16:40] believe
[16:40] that you would not be in this room
[16:41] tonight if he didn't value your sole
[16:44] value the condition of you soon and then
[16:47] he goes to whosoever therefore shall be
[16:50] ashamed of me
[16:51] enough my words in this adulterous and
[16:54] sinful generation and Jesus is speaking
[16:57] here and and and it's somewhat difficult
[17:00] because when you compare when he was
[17:04] here and when he was speaking and who he
[17:07] was addressing it makes you wonder if he
[17:10] was really addressing the people who
[17:11] were around him because it would seem
[17:13] that this scripture is so appropriate
[17:15] for now whosoever therefore shall be
[17:19] ashamed of me and of my words in this
[17:22] adulterous and sinful generation of him
[17:25] also shall the Son of Man be ashamed
[17:27] when he cometh in the glory of his
[17:30] father with the Holy Angels and I will a
[17:33] scripture reading tonight from Romans 1
[17:36] and just reading one verse verse 16 for
[17:40] I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ
[17:43] for it is the power of God unto
[17:45] salvation to everyone that believeth to
[17:48] the Jew first and also to the Greek we
[17:51] Lord and a blessing so the reading of
[17:53] his word tonight and there's so much
[17:56] here in scripture that we cannot explore
[17:59] it all but I just want to touch some
[18:01] highlight points and if it were to give
[18:03] a thought or text or something to
[18:05] remember this by it will be I am not
[18:08] ashamed of the gospel of Christ I am not
[18:11] ashamed of the gospel of Christ and just
[18:15] to connect the dots we see in Joelle
[18:17] with the restoration he said my people
[18:20] shall never be ashamed and he repeats it
[18:23] again as if the in passing we saw them
[18:25] glaze over this and I would have
[18:27] preached on a similar theme sometime ago
[18:29] about my people who shall never be
[18:30] ashamed but if there's something there
[18:32] that God wants us to catch and then he
[18:35] speaks about who was so ever shall be
[18:37] ashamed of me and of my words so it's
[18:40] true level of embarrassment or Sheen
[18:42] it's ashamed of him and of his words in
[18:45] this sinful and adulterous generation of
[18:48] him also shall the Son of Man be ashamed
[18:51] and then there's great declaration
[18:54] poor mix to the Romans I am not ashamed
[18:56] of the gospel of Christ for it is the
[18:59] power of God unto salvation to everyone
[19:01] that believeth you know and I was
[19:03] looking at what is happening in the
[19:07] world today and it is requesting that
[19:11] you address matters with wisdom but at
[19:15] the same time you cannot abandon certain
[19:17] core truths and core principles because
[19:21] behind every movement behind every
[19:24] message there's a spirit behind
[19:27] everything that's operating as a spirit
[19:29] and there's a spirit of the age so in
[19:31] Noah's day there was a spirit of the age
[19:34] that defined the behaviors that people
[19:37] were living out in the days of lot and
[19:38] Sodom there was a stir of the age that
[19:41] was there when with a Branham came there
[19:43] was a spirit of the age and brother
[19:45] Branham preaching in the u.s. spoke I
[19:48] think in 1956 he said America has
[19:50] rejected this and in rejecting it
[19:53] whether Branham said I don't even want
[19:54] to pray for America no more that America
[19:56] is finished and it was as a result of
[19:59] the spirit of the age and we don't
[20:03] politicize in this ministry we don't get
[20:06] into these things but I want to go a
[20:08] little under the surface here because in
[20:10] seeing different undercurrents of what's
[20:12] happening around the world you were
[20:15] starting to hear me narrative also of
[20:18] things being silently and subtly put
[20:21] into places you know and and and and it
[20:24] is common knowledge it's all over the
[20:25] news they are protests in the u.s. they
[20:27] are protests in Europe they are protests
[20:29] in Africa near protests even in Trinidad
[20:31] you want to class here for different
[20:33] things and different agendas and and and
[20:34] and people have their right you can
[20:37] change anyone's perspective on what they
[20:39] believe in but on a deeper level I
[20:42] suddenly hear certain things and see
[20:44] certain messages beyond the issue of the
[20:47] black lives matter movement and these
[20:49] things to begin to see the narrative
[20:52] begin to expand to black lives matter
[20:55] and I saw a post that spoke about
[20:59] transvestite lives matter and we begin
[21:02] to go into a play area that I say wait a
[21:04] minute
[21:05] is it a paving of a way
[21:07] of different agendas being subtly put in
[21:10] there because there was a time in
[21:12] history most of us younger generation
[21:14] would not remember when women were not
[21:16] allowed to vote
[21:17] so Betty Branham said that changed
[21:19] things and when women began to vote then
[21:22] certain movements were started and and
[21:24] throughout history all these things as a
[21:27] result of the spirit of the age to push
[21:29] what a real agenda is so while people
[21:33] are comfortable with a general theme it
[21:37] is not a general theme that really is
[21:40] the issue it is what is underlying the
[21:43] general theme and it comes back to this
[21:46] adulterous and sinful generation and in
[21:51] this adulterous and sinful generation
[21:52] and I would have mentioned it in maybe
[21:55] this meeting or like I tell you I get
[21:57] blurred now with which meeting I
[21:58] mentioned what but to see how in Russia
[22:00] for example they are comfortable to
[22:03] silence books a brother branham because
[22:07] they find that in that message it's
[22:09] stuff that hits against what they want
[22:12] to become normal or what they want to
[22:14] become acceptable people protest for
[22:17] what they believe in people fight for
[22:19] what they believe in and there's nothing
[22:21] wrong with fighting for what you believe
[22:23] in and it is when the agenda shifts to
[22:28] people not becoming ashamed of what they
[22:31] should be ashamed of and it is when
[22:34] people become the same of what it should
[22:36] not be ashamed of I hope I'm not losing
[22:38] you tonight so I want us to be very
[22:40] careful in our life and in our operation
[22:43] that we don't become a shame of him our
[22:46] God and of his words because when
[22:50] pressure is going to come pressure has
[22:52] to come pressure must come
[22:56] right now black lives matter is the
[22:58] message but that would not always be the
[23:00] message because this will also pass and
[23:02] when this is addressed there will be
[23:04] another matter there will be another
[23:06] issue there will be another agenda that
[23:09] will come up until it reaches a head or
[23:12] a confrontation so where this scripture
[23:15] will have to come into play with are you
[23:17] ashamed of me or of my words ashamed of
[23:22] me is a direct attack against what God
[23:27] represents their people sadly who grew
[23:30] up in this message who don't even
[23:31] believe in God no more there are people
[23:34] who grew up in Bible believing
[23:36] Christians who questioned what should
[23:39] not be questioned but even more subtle
[23:43] because you could say to me but I think
[23:45] I am a believer I believe this message I
[23:47] believe the Prophet I believe the Lord
[23:50] what can you say that you are also not
[23:53] ashamed of his words because his words
[23:56] has never changed his words have never
[23:57] changed his words are the same he said
[24:00] I'm the same yesterday I'm the same
[24:01] today
[24:01] I'm the same forever so the challenge to
[24:04] us tonight is how we give him ground in
[24:08] our daily lives and the way we live and
[24:11] I'm and I'm watching people the
[24:12] enthusiasm and the passion for what you
[24:15] believe and I'm looking to see God's
[24:18] people have a passion to what they
[24:20] believe also I've said it before I've
[24:23] seen many people this year is an
[24:25] election year and I can guarantee you
[24:26] they are people in this room who are
[24:28] excited to go on a political party they
[24:32] excited to fight for the cause of what
[24:34] they believe in because they believe and
[24:36] at the end of the day that is something
[24:39] that is temporary that will lead to
[24:41] failure that can never solve anything
[24:43] because at the end of the day everything
[24:45] on this earth is orchestrated by what
[24:47] God allows years ago when people thought
[24:51] that Hillary would win the election and
[24:52] it they never taught Trump would win but
[24:54] here we have a guy called Trump in the
[24:56] White House and that is what God allowed
[24:59] to happen to allow everything to unfold
[25:02] for us to be a district occur point
[25:05] if somebody else was in the White House
[25:07] this might this whole situation we face
[25:09] no good what I've been refused
[25:10] differently but God who is allowing the
[25:12] chess pieces to move is allowing things
[25:15] to fall into place to bring a
[25:17] confrontation
[25:18] God loves conflict the conflict healing
[25:22] started the conflict started in heaven
[25:23] the Bible said and there was war in
[25:25] heaven so he's looking to start the
[25:28] conflict but the conflict was started
[25:30] and we are still dealing with the
[25:32] conflict and that is why we come to
[25:34] these friend meetings and these services
[25:36] because we didn't start the conflict but
[25:38] we were born into our conflict we were
[25:41] born into a war we didn't ask to be in
[25:44] the war but we were put into the war but
[25:47] being pleased in the war I see was
[25:49] pleased in us of overcoming in this war
[25:51] if we would stand and not be ashamed of
[25:55] the son of man and of his words this
[25:58] same Paul who said I wasn't I am not
[26:02] ashamed of the gospel of Christ but it
[26:04] is the power of God unto salvation that
[26:07] was not always his testimony this is a
[26:10] change man who is speaking this is a
[26:12] transform the man who is speaking a few
[26:15] years before he would write this he was
[26:18] after these same people but he went
[26:20] through a transformation in his life can
[26:23] the church say man that changed the way
[26:25] he spoke and I prayed it to God
[26:28] that in these meetings that in these
[26:30] times in our closet we could go to a
[26:33] chance of mission hallelujah that change
[26:36] how we talk to change how we walk to

[28:37] everybody else does is easy I had a
[28:39] conversation with some resident and I
[28:41] said the problem I have is people like
[28:43] the thing too small and I thought
[28:46] someone was wrong with me until I
[28:48] connected it with brother branham saying
[28:50] we need to ask for big things we asked
[28:54] him for small things we serve a big goal
[28:55] and we asking God for chunky chunky
[28:58] things you have big challenges big
[29:02] problems acts court to solve that and
[29:04] more come on now when we come to these
[29:07] sessions you want to act off any small
[29:10] thing that that you could try to fix
[29:11] yourself bring the big things to God
[29:13] that is what he wants can the church say
[29:16] Amen but Abraham said we have some time
[29:21] tonight right the midis those prophets
[29:25] those daring messengers of God come with
[29:27] out church without denomination without
[29:30] organization without anything they
[29:32] defied king
[29:33] kingdoms churches everything when the
[29:36] priests they was brought before the
[29:38] priests it wasn't ashamed because they
[29:40] had does see the Lord that's how I feel
[29:42] tonight oh come on now we ought to be
[29:46] revolutionaries for the gospel for the
[29:48] kingdom of God listen we are in a
[29:50] minority you know we are in a minority
[29:52] and by the Branham taught us one is a
[29:55] majority in God he doesn't need 5,000
[29:58] people he does need one two three people
[30:00] who could break past the limits who
[30:03] could break past whatever whatever is
[30:05] holding you back tonight
[30:06] can the church see him in and I think of
[30:09] the province of all when they come with
[30:11] that message and it back it embarrass
[30:13] the kings and it made that people feel
[30:15] uncomfortable the priests even when they
[30:17] feel uncomfortable because they were
[30:19] supposed to be leaders religious men and
[30:21] the word comfort in that manner it
[30:23] exposed them and they felt embarrassed
[30:25] or seen hallelujah and many times we see
[30:28] that not too many today that many say
[30:30] I'm a Christian have you received the
[30:32] Holy Ghost since you believe you see
[30:34] they're embarrassed about it
[30:35] friends I want to challenge us to not be
[30:38] ashamed to pre their not be ashamed to
[30:40] worship do not be ashamed to have a
[30:42] testimony and your job have a testimony
[30:45] in your business to have a testimony in
[30:47] your marriage to have a testimony in
[30:49] your family you are not ashamed of this
[30:51] message you are not ashamed of the Son
[30:53] of Man or of his words can the church
[30:55] say man let me try the front a place to
[30:58] wrap up here a little bit I'm ready
[31:00] Branham would have gone through many
[31:02] cases he talked about Noah Noah was not
[31:04] ashamed we talked about the Hebrew boys
[31:06] the Hebrew boys was not ashamed Daniel
[31:09] was not ashamed they were not ashamed
[31:11] for all the ages can the church same and
[31:13] Moses was not ashamed or blessed be the
[31:17] name of the Lord so I would have taught
[31:19] on this before and I just want to run it
[31:20] through a little bit again
[31:22] the very first time that the word shame
[31:27] has found his phone in the book of
[31:29] Genesis and we read it I believe it's
[31:33] the end of Genesis some when there
[31:38] Genesis 1 ye inform God was pleased
[31:43] hallelujah I said that Adam and Eve were
[31:45] naked and they were not achieved can the
[31:48] church say Amen that's the end of
[31:52] Genesis 2 and they were both naked and a
[31:54] man is white and they were not ashamed
[31:58] there was nothing hidden we had nothing
[32:01] to hide
[32:02] they had no secrets there was no barrier
[32:05] between them and God there was nothing
[32:08] to him the perfect communion and this is
[32:10] where we started to bring it into into a
[32:12] prayer and the conversation now so by
[32:15] the end of Genesis 2 after all of God's
[32:17] creation God is now addressing and we
[32:20] know it Moses was the one who's writing
[32:22] but God said it is good it is good it is
[32:24] good it is good and the Bible says it
[32:27] ends Genesis 2 let me Genesis to the
[32:30] very last verse there and they were both
[32:33] naked the man and his wife and they were
[32:35] not ashamed
[32:37] nothing hidden before good and this is
[32:41] not just physical this is he could see
[32:44] through their lives I wanted to just
[32:47] sink a little bit we have nothing to
[32:49] hide
[32:50] they had no secrets there was no barrier
[32:53] between them and God and because of that
[32:57] they were not ashamed
[32:58] there was nothing to him the perfect
[33:00] communion
[33:02] now when you study scripture the Bible
[33:04] makes a point about something is because
[33:06] God wants to draw attention to it so God
[33:10] was pleased the fact that he Lord that
[33:12] there he could have just said they were
[33:14] naked but he made a point about it then
[33:17] they were not ashamed I'm very careful
[33:19] with Scripture
[33:20] they have nothing to be ashamed about
[33:23] and he will find out that the only time
[33:27] she was introduced in Scripture is when
[33:30] man fell the fall of man or the
[33:33] introduction of sin brought with him
[33:36] before sin there was no shame there was
[33:39] nothing like embarrassment it was
[33:41] nothing like disappointment because
[33:43] everything was perfect so when sin came
[33:45] and I hope this helped somebody tonight
[33:47] when sin came it brought a barrier and
[33:50] that shame that came with sin let her
[33:55] hiding it led to guilt it left her
[33:59] denial it left to covering up in letter
[34:04] I can't tell anybody and are preaching
[34:06] this before and it's easy because no
[34:11] over the last three months in particular
[34:13] where we have not had the opportunity to
[34:16] come together it would allow some of us
[34:19] to hide
[34:21] hide hide hide what we're doing hide how
[34:28] we're living the same letter let me just
[34:33] keep on acting it was harder to do it
[34:39] when we had regular service but now it's
[34:41] been a little more easy
[34:46] because it's easy to hide I'm not
[34:49] accusing you of hiding but it's easier
[34:54] to hide the shame would lead us to I
[34:57] hope they don't see me shim hiding sin
[35:05] shame hiding sincheon covering up sin
[35:09] shim because this is what led adam to go
[35:13] hiding that cos go out to see Adam where
[35:15] are you and we have taught is not the
[35:16] physical location but it was sin that
[35:20] brought shame shame brings hiding are
[35:26] you hiding what are you hiding what are
[35:34] you trying to cover up sin brought shame
[35:38] shame brought hiding hiding brought to
[35:40] covering up and you find Adam cutting
[35:42] fig leaves trying to cover up
[35:45] sin shame shame hiding hiding covering
[35:48] them some of us we cover up with just a
[35:51] smile it's a cover-up some of us we
[35:56] cover up with enthusiastic expressions
[36:03] sin bring shame shame brings hiding
[36:06] hiding brings covering up we cover up by
[36:10] overcompensating in different ways it's
[36:12] still covering up because under the
[36:14] cover up is the shame under the shame is
[36:17] a sin anybody with me tonight maybe I'm
[36:21] coming I'm inside a housing coming kind
[36:24] of clothes coming kind of kind of
[36:26] dealing with the ETD
[36:27] in a man a little bit because you could
[36:29] only get free if we can expose the shame
[36:32] and get to these sin and I just the sin
[36:35] issue can the church say Amen because we
[36:38] wanted to put a sin issue to rest not as
[36:40] a cover-up can the church say Amen
[36:43] because Buddha venom taught us when they
[36:44] kill the world and the goat on the sheep
[36:46] it was covering sin but when Jesus died
[36:48] and his blood was shed it was not to
[36:50] cover it was to oh come on now he said
[36:53] it was like bleach oh come on out when
[36:55] you drop it inside of their glory of God
[36:58] it destroys the sinking Whitney and when
[37:01] sin is destroyed she means destroyed and
[37:04] when shame is destroyed there's no
[37:06] cover-up Oh hallelujah I hope you catch
[37:12] this tonight come on young brother come
[37:14] on young sister sin hiding hiding shame
[37:22] covering up while you struggle with how
[37:26] to dress what music to listen to
[37:29] trying to hide what you really believe
[37:32] because you don't want anybody to know
[37:33] that you're really a Christian and you
[37:35] have a testimony so you play this game
[37:37] I'm trying to work on the edge saying
[37:42] things that you shouldn't say doing
[37:43] things you shouldn't do going places you
[37:45] shouldn't go it's a cover-up because you
[37:47] can't be who you really are in God can
[37:51] the church seem and anybody with me
[37:56] and many of us we are facing that semen
[37:58] and I want you to remember now Paula
[38:00] scene I am not ashamed and the Bible and
[38:03] my people shall never be ashamed I
[38:08] remember I was very young and we had a
[38:12] family gathering very um under ten years
[38:15] old
[38:16] better be under ten years old and we had
[38:18] a family gathering and I can't remember
[38:23] in Soto ever and my dad was B was
[38:27] blessing a house or whatever it was and
[38:29] he's singing a song
[38:31] and the whole family's here so I'm
[38:32] watching my cousins and I'm seeing
[38:35] everybody there and my dad is looking at
[38:38] me remember like the sing with me and
[38:40] I'm watching my cousins
[38:42] and many times we struggle with this
[38:45] trying to fit in and and you know is it
[38:48] the cool thing to do or you know you're
[38:51] you're you don't want to stand out too
[38:53] much and but it has to come a point when
[38:58] I'm not telling you run along the
[38:59] highway with with the prophet books on
[39:02] your head and and I think you're running
[39:03] on your street and paint your car in
[39:05] your rainbow colors that I'm talking
[39:07] about and I know that's not what I'm
[39:09] talking about I'm talking about have any
[39:11] confidence to know where you're standing
[39:13] and having an assurance that this gospel
[39:16] is so rooted in your heart that nobody
[39:17] could take it out can the church say
[39:19] Amen but just to help somebody and I do
[39:22] know who I'm speaking to tonight I'm
[39:24] hoping to not be too much longer my
[39:28] people shall never be ashamed
[39:31] ashamed of this gospel ashamed to have a
[39:34] testimony ashamed to testify
[39:36] why don't you testify to people why
[39:42] don't you testify about this gospel why
[39:48] haven't you done more
[39:50] because if you really believe something
[39:54] if you really believe something and
[39:56] believe in something it should become
[40:00] natural for you to tell people about it
[40:03] it isn't it right so what is ruling you
[40:07] back from telling people that you have
[40:10] access to a joy and a peace and a
[40:12] comfort are you ashamed to tell your
[40:16] family then you need to understand why
[40:18] that is why are you ashamed to tell your
[40:19] family I said it in in in a service
[40:26] indigo Martin maybe of a year or two ago
[40:29] I said your life in front of your
[40:33] neighbors your physical neighbors must
[40:36] be in such a minute if you tell them
[40:37] come to serve is the one that come to
[40:39] our service it cannot be that if you
[40:44] invite your neighbor to a service they
[40:46] say to go to church with you to go to
[40:50] your church you you your your your
[40:54] church so it means that you have to live
[40:58] such a life and it's so transparent in
[41:02] terms of what you believe that when
[41:04] people see you and the way you live they
[41:07] are attracted by your life and your
[41:10] being persuaded you ever meet some of
[41:12] you already convinced what's something
[41:14] they will tell you listen you have no
[41:17] other option but to do what I tell you
[41:18] to do you know you meet somebody who is
[41:21] passionate about something about some
[41:22] other product or something you meet a
[41:24] good serious one
[41:26] who really passionate about what is
[41:28] selling listen when they talk to you you
[41:31] will think that is the only thing a
[41:33] traveler because they're passionate
[41:34] about it
[41:37] how passionate about this gospel are you
[41:40] and what is holding you back what are
[41:44] you ashamed of what are you afraid of
[41:46] because shame and fear is also connected
[41:48] we don't have time to go into the oil
[41:50] tonight but she might fear because that
[41:52] she unfairly hiding that's Adam was
[41:54] ashamed and he was afraid he thought
[41:56] that's what he said I was afraid
[41:59] and I hid myself
[42:04] come to church seaman
[42:08] let me go a little deeper Webster's
[42:11] dictionary defines the word Shem as a
[42:14] feeling of disgrace or guilt a feeling
[42:18] of inferiority or unworthiness shame is
[42:21] that negative feeling or emotion we get
[42:24] on the inside of ourselves when we know
[42:27] we're not acting the way we're supposed
[42:30] to act when we know we have done
[42:33] something we have no business doing in
[42:36] the Bible shame is described as that
[42:39] awareness in the innermost part of our
[42:42] being that lets us know when we
[42:44] transgress against God's law we have
[42:47] violated one of his commands shame is
[42:52] that guilty feeling we get on the inside
[42:54] when we know we've offended the very
[42:56] presence of God in our hearts now I know
[42:59] this is not the kind of message people
[43:01] like to get into because it makes us
[43:03] confront who we are and confront who we
[43:06] are in the world because we want to grow
[43:09] friends and I'm challenging us to grow
[43:12] you have to decide you want to grow
[43:16] because if you're not growing you're
[43:17] dying if you're not adding you are dying
[43:22] and as a people as an individual it must
[43:25] really be real to you because you want
[43:28] to be able to stand in front of God I'm
[43:30] not ashamed of this gospel I'm not
[43:33] ashamed of this anima and live on the
[43:35] scripture that my people will never be
[43:37] ashamed you have nothing that you seem
[43:40] about because his blood has washed you
[43:42] clean and you know have a testimony of
[43:44] living clean of staying clean by
[43:47] speaking clean by walking clean and he
[43:49] could walk boldly to the throne of God
[43:52] and when you ask it ask it wondering how
[43:54] will my requests be processed but
[43:57] because he in good standing I want to
[43:59] use that term good standing
[44:02] you know when it goes in the bank to get
[44:04] a loan it wouldn't have your credit in
[44:05] good standing because if you accustomed
[44:08] to to not team your loans on time then
[44:10] you're in bad standing so they want to
[44:13] know if your account in good standing if
[44:15] your accountant with God in good
[44:18] standing not your attendance in this
[44:19] meeting come on now that is from mantasy
[44:24] yes God blesses that but I'm talking
[44:27] about what we cannot see that is the
[44:28] issue that's the real issue what we
[44:30] don't see is your account with God in
[44:34] good standing tonight let me try to
[44:37] really so close tonight shame was the
[44:42] reason the woman and the well went to
[44:46] the well when nobody else was there
[44:53] she did not want to hear the comments of
[44:55] how many men she had been with she was
[45:00] know tired of the whispers
[45:03] she was tired of the silent looks and
[45:07] the shrugs are soulless
[45:09] here she is it was shame
[45:13] it was seem that led David to become a
[45:16] murderer after he had abused his power
[45:19] and slept with another man's wife and in
[45:23] his shame he sent a man to be killed
[45:27] you
[45:34] anybody with me tonight
[45:37] the woman will issue a blood I've
[45:39] preached this before but I just taken a
[45:41] little slower to make sure it resonates
[45:42] in your soul you woman with the issue of
[45:44] blood a situation meant that she could
[45:47] not go to the temple
[45:50] you
[45:53] under Judaic law if you're bleeding you
[45:57] cannot approach a man you can't even
[45:58] touch his sons as a mother so this woman
[46:03] could not even talk to Jesus hallelujah
[46:08] how could she even tell Jesus why she
[46:11] came
[46:16] but Hashim pushed her to decided if I
[46:19] could just touch the hem of His garment
[46:21] I could be mean hall she went beyond
[46:26] Hashim
[46:31] friends don't let the shame of your past
[46:34] of your mistakes and of your failures
[46:38] you let that shame leave me to hide in
[46:41] the wrong place tonight I want to
[46:46] challenge you to great pass the limit
[46:50] don't hide in your home don't hide in
[46:54] solitude don't hide behind your world
[46:56] there people who hide behind their work
[46:58] you know they hide behind housework the
[47:02] I behind here I'd look behind behind
[47:04] computers you hide behind food behind
[47:08] behind in newspaper they hide behind
[47:10] meetings they hide behind headphones and
[47:13] people have led listen to music but I
[47:15] don't want to confront the real issues
[47:17] of life and it might soar as if I need
[47:20] to relax but what are you really hiding
[47:22] I'm not accusing anybody of anything is
[47:25] you have to look at yourself in the wood
[47:27] and you have to answer to God in your
[47:29] time of threat tonight because I'm
[47:32] challenging you tonight to be able to
[47:35] have the testimony that says I am NOT
[47:39] I've sinned can the church semen
[47:44] you
[47:47] friends I want to bring it close to this
[47:51] stop hiding behind fashion education
[47:56] your career Facebook stop hiding in
[48:00] church sub hiding in business or
[48:04] procrastination stop hiding behind lies
[48:07] or diversions stop hiding between being
[48:12] serious or behind the jokes stop hiding
[48:16] behind being brave or being timid stop
[48:19] hiding by being an extrovert or an
[48:21] introvert
[48:26] in closing we do need a place to hide
[48:31] but me to hide in the right place
[48:34] Alleluia
[48:35] and there's only one place that we could
[48:37] hide it offers the protection that we
[48:39] seek where our shame is covered because
[48:44] Jesus didn't come for perfect people he
[48:46] said neither oh well have no need of a
[48:48] physician when I came to heal the
[48:51] brokenhearted I came to take the pieces
[48:54] of your life and all the shame you have
[48:58] carried and the Mystics and the failures
[49:00] and put it together again you know I was
[49:03] I was thinking this woman with the issue
[49:05] of blood she would have felt broken this
[49:09] is this is powerful she would have felt
[49:11] her life was broken but you know when
[49:14] Jesus looked at her he didn't see her
[49:16] broken he saw all of her oh my god I
[49:20] don't care what challenge you going
[49:23] through tonight and who you feel her
[49:25] life could be in different ways and
[49:26] different places and this was going
[49:28] wrong when Gordon looks at you to the
[49:30] blood tonight he sees all of you and his
[49:34] love is what reached from eternity
[49:36] broke truth time knew who you were wrote
[49:40] your name in blood before you were even
[49:42] here and predestined meet you by
