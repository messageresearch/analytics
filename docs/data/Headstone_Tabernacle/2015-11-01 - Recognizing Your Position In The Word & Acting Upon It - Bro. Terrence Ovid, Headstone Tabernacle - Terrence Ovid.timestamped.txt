[9:40] and from 8 to
[9:42] 11 reading from St
[9:44] John 17: 6 to1
[9:49] ver I have manifested thy name unto the
[9:54] men which thou givest me out of of the
[10:01] world thine they
[10:03] were and thou givest them
[10:08] me and they have kept Thy
[10:13] word
[10:15] now they have known that all things
[10:20] whatsoever thou Hast given me are of
[10:26] thee for I have given given unto them
[10:31] The Words which thou givest
[10:34] me and they have received
[10:37] them and have known surely that I came
[10:41] out from thee and they have believe that
[10:46] thou did send
[10:49] me I pray for
[10:52] them I pray not for the
[10:55] world but for them which thou has given

[11:38] me that they may be one as We Are
[11:58] One
[12:02] Revelation chap 10 verse
[12:06] 1-3 and I saw another Mighty Angel come
[12:10] down from heaven clothed with a cloud
[12:13] and a rainbow was upon his head and his
[12:17] face was as it were the
[12:20] Sun and his feet as pillars of
[12:24] fire and he had in his hand a little
[12:28] book open
[12:30] he set his right foot upon the sea and
[12:33] his left foot upon the
[12:35] Earth and cried with a loud voice as
[12:39] when a lion roar it and when he had
[12:42] cried seven tunders uttered their
[12:47] voices L chapter 8
[12:50] 108 and the voice which I heard from
[12:54] Heaven spake unto me again and said go
[12:59] and take the little book which is open
[13:02] in the hands of the Angel which standeth
[13:06] upon the sea and upon the Earth and I
[13:10] went unto the angel and said unto
[13:13] him give me the little book and he said
[13:17] unto me take it and eat it up and it
[13:22] shall make thy belly
[13:24] bitter but it shall be in thy mouth
[13:27] sweet as honey
[13:32] and I took the little book out of the
[13:36] Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in
[13:40] my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I
[13:45] had eaten it my belly was
[13:48] bitter and he said unto
[13:51] me thou must prophesy again before many
[13:56] people and Nations and tongs
[13:59] and Kings may the Lord add a blessing to
[14:02] his word you may be
[14:04] seated and tonight I have a thought for
[14:07] this time of
[14:10] exaltation recognizing your position in
[14:13] the word am and acting upon
[14:16] it this is where the problem lies with
[14:20] Believers they're not acting upon the
[14:22] word because they don't recognize their
[14:25] position but I Brandon preach a message
[14:28] hearing
[14:30] recognizing and acting upon the word of
[14:33] God this morning the Holy
[14:37] Spirit admonish us to put away childish
[14:42] things because children cannot recognize
[14:46] their
[14:47] position in the word that the father
[14:50] want them to
[14:52] recognize God want his children to
[14:56] recognize who he see they are amen and
[15:01] act upon what he said that they are and
[15:05] it's time we become men and women Amen
[15:09] in this message because we can no longer
[15:13] be feeding babies with milk you have to
[15:15] take hard meat and hard corn you got to
[15:20] learn to handle the word of God that God
[15:23] has placed in
[15:26] you Jesus call his disciples
[15:30] they were fishermen they were ignorant
[15:34] they were
[15:35] unlearned and that was the type of
[15:38] people that God
[15:39] called and most of the time the people
[15:42] that God called are insufficient in
[15:45] themselves for the job that they are
[15:47] called for amen amen amen because God
[15:52] love to confront the strong with the
[15:54] weak Hallelujah God loves to take the
[15:57] best things to confound the mighty that
[16:01] is why he said he that exalted himself
[16:03] shall be a based and he that humbled
[16:05] himself themselves shall be exalted but
[16:08] B said God
[16:10] ways and attitude never change amen amen
[16:15] because he's God and he changeth not
[16:18] that's right but the devil like to beat
[16:20] us down in our mind and tell us we are
[16:24] not who we are we are not who God say we
[16:28] are and we look at our weaknesses we
[16:31] look at our failures we look at our
[16:33] shortcomings but we don't look to the
[16:35] God who spoke concering
[16:40] usall listen brother Bram as a young
[16:43] Minister didn't know who he was he was a
[16:45] Baptist Minister he had a gift to seeing
[16:48] vision and see it come to pass the
[16:52] ministers around him knows nothing about
[16:55] the supernatural they said that must be
[16:57] a devil try and get rid of it do let
[16:59] thing affect you he come to a place he
[17:01] having mind battles he's a tormented man
[17:05] that's right because the angel passing
[17:07] as a warwind and passing he decide to go
[17:11] once and for all in the forest and speak
[17:14] to the Lord not coming back said not
[17:15] coming back until he hear from God amen
[17:18] amen it was only on the 7th of May
[17:22] 1946 when the angel spoke to the
[17:25] prophet and tell him who he was his
[17:29] purpose on Earth and you have the gift
[17:31] of healing to take to the world you're
[17:33] going to pray for kings and potentates
[17:36] nothing will stand before his prayer not
[17:38] even cancer if you get the people to
[17:40] believe he will after a while disc earn
[17:43] the thoughts and the intents of the
[17:45] heart hallelujah hallelujah that is the
[17:48] word that was spoken to a man with a
[17:50] seventh grade
[17:52] education insignificant amen amen he
[17:55] said I cannot do it I have no education
[17:57] he said you is the man for the
[18:00] Hallelujah and you is the man for the
[18:02] job you is the woman for the
[18:06] job Hallelujah
[18:09] Glory listen Glory with that revelation
[18:13] of his position but bam confronted the
[18:16] enemy one time because you know
[18:19] why he was
[18:21] given the greatest the most powerful
[18:25] amen
[18:26] weapon that God put in the control of
[18:31] human beings pray
[18:33] Hallelujah so he went forth and a
[18:36] minister used to preach the message and
[18:38] he will come and pray for the sick and
[18:40] they'll be
[18:41] healed so with that as a child with a
[18:46] powerful weapon he had to be trained how
[18:48] to handle it
[18:49] amen so he was only looking for miracles
[18:54] the toughest hardest case so bra will
[18:56] spend half an hour to qu praying for one
[18:59] dumb person or a blind person until they
[19:02] get the sight until they speak because
[19:05] the angel tell him nothing will stand
[19:06] before his prayer amen but he had to be
[19:09] trained so the angel tell him you're
[19:10] looking for super doing it wrong just
[19:12] pray for the second and they'll be
[19:13] healed so he had tell people after pray
[19:16] going be heal different things so God
[19:18] have to train him how to
[19:20] handle this weapon amen and this gift he
[19:24] had to be tray now to become a man amen
[19:28] he was
[19:29] trained and he became the living
[19:32] Tabernacle of the Living God Dwelling
[19:36] Place
[19:39] Hallelujah
[19:41] listen he became the house that almighty
[19:46] God choose to dwell in in this 20th
[19:48] century and you got to become the same
[19:51] because the same yesterday today and
[19:54] forever the most high God doesn't dwell
[19:57] in temples make with
[19:59] amen amen hallelujah
[20:03] hallelujah he doesn't dwell in temples
[20:06] made with hands that's right but a body
[20:09] amen has thou prepared thee praise God
[20:12] praise God thank you Lord thank you Lord
[20:15] God dwell Amen in the body that's right
[20:20] of human beings because God created man
[20:23] in His image and in his likeness the
[20:26] prophet said we bypass our word bodies
[20:30] amen and came in flesh to be tested and
[20:33] tried but he also said we become the
[20:36] word as we receive the word and we must
[20:40] have the Living Word in us to have the
[20:42] Living God in us and we've been feeding
[20:44] on the unfailing body word of the son of
[20:47] man all these years so the Living Word
[20:50] is in
[20:52] us so we have to start to act upon who
[20:55] God say we are amen hallelujah
[20:59] so listen
[21:01] glory the lord
[21:03] himself descended from
[21:06] Heaven according chapter
[21:09] 10 with a little book
[21:11] open where did the Lord
[21:14] went when he came down he put one foot
[21:17] upon the sea and one foot upon the Earth
[21:19] they cried a loud voice
[21:22] listen this seventh
[21:24] Revelation is so simple go the prophet
[21:27] say don't look for no Great Mighty thing
[21:31] yes because it is in Simplicity amen and
[21:34] in Christ The Mystery of God revealed he
[21:37] said God do not give his mystery in
[21:40] full but after it's
[21:42] completed then he show what he did that
[21:46] we can look back and see what it's all
[21:49] about and look forward and see what it's
[21:51] all brought up
[21:53] to so if we look back and see what
[21:57] happened
[21:59] the prophet was standing on the Earth
[22:02] when the mighty angel came down and that
[22:04] angel came in the
[22:07] prophet so that angel which is Christ
[22:09] The Covenant angel with the open book
[22:12] that have our names was calling our
[22:15] names to receive our inheritance from
[22:17] the lamb Book of Life in the prophet
[22:19] what was happening the seven Thunders
[22:21] was uttering their
[22:26] voices because when God
[22:29] himself came
[22:31] down I want you to see the parallel on
[22:34] Mount Si there was Moses there and there
[22:38] was God in the mountain that's right but
[22:40] God was thundering that's right it had
[22:42] lightning it had voices that earthquake
[22:45] the place was shaking and rocking and
[22:47] the people fear they said do not let God
[22:50] speak lest we
[22:55] die and God to the people spoke rightly
[22:58] I will no longer speak to the people
[23:00] like that am I will send them
[23:03] prophets I will send them a still Small
[23:06] Voice amen but it going to be thunder it
[23:09] going to be lightning but it Veil yes as
[23:14] a still Small Voice that's it that's it
[23:18] so what God did Hallelujah to the seven
[23:21] Church ages he had seven
[23:25] voices seven Messengers amen seven
[23:30] manifestations of his one Holy Spirit it
[23:33] was the voice of God in each age through
[23:37] the messenger for the age calling the
[23:39] names for the age to receive their
[23:41] inheritance so it was seven thundering
[23:43] voices that was thundering through the
[23:45] seven Church ages but it was
[23:49] sealed Hallelujah
[23:52] Hallelujah Jesus told his disciples he
[23:55] alone had the father's seal and the
[23:57] Seven Seals in revealing Christ in his
[24:00] Sevenfold personage the prophet say
[24:02] Jesus Christ in Bride form among the
[24:04] Gentiles that what the Myster of the
[24:06] Thunders
[24:07] [Music]
[24:08] was but it was sealed through the seven
[24:11] Church ages through the Seven Seals am
[24:15] promised revealed in the last day by the
[24:17] seventh angel
[24:20] messenger so brother
[24:22] Bram tied up all the locen what they
[24:25] miss back there to The Seven Ages when
[24:28] any was TI up it was time now for the
[24:30] seven angels to come amen so it was six
[24:33] ages and here the seventh age which the
[24:36] prophet the seventh angel and his Angel
[24:39] is Christ because every age had an angel
[24:42] anointed the
[24:43] messenger so when the prophet was open
[24:45] the servant he said each night an angel
[24:48] came to
[24:50] him and reveal what was under the seal
[24:52] because that was the manifestation of
[24:54] the angel that operated in that
[24:57] age
[24:59] but God hid this whole Revelation
[25:02] because if it was revealed the devil
[25:04] could have great done great damage all
[25:06] he had to do was to kill the prophet and
[25:08] God had nobody to speak true he had no
[25:11] Tabernacle to dwell in there was no
[25:13] place for the seventh angel which is
[25:15] Christ to come down in with the book If
[25:17] this m was unfold so it could notf amen
[25:21] listen brother sorry as a
[25:25] man and as all right the pastor of the
[25:29] Bram Tabernacle amen wanted his
[25:33] church to see this mystery amen so here
[25:37] he tell them he said I've been
[25:40] spending each night just on the seven
[25:44] seal so I want you on the thir SE night
[25:47] to write out
[25:49] questions pertaining
[25:52] specifically to the Seven Seals because
[25:55] he won't let me answer any question
[25:59] wrong amen come on this was the
[26:03] prophet method all right of trying to
[26:07] get the Bram Tabernacle to see the
[26:10] mystery that was being unfolded before
[26:13] their presence so he telling himself
[26:16] that they will ask pertinent questions
[26:19] that the angel in him will answer
[26:23] because he won't let me answer no
[26:24] question wrong amen but God cannot let
[26:28] the mystery out amen so what happened
[26:32] nobody ask no pertinent questions amen
[26:35] hallelujah hallelujah there about four
[26:37] or five question about whether is 7,000
[26:40] or 700 I make a mistake they ask
[26:43] question about the serpent they ask all
[26:44] kind of questions and they didn't ask no
[26:47] real questions about the seven SE what
[26:50] was taking place amen amen but one
[26:54] guy make a statement and he said brother
[26:57] Branham
[26:59] if in a question he say if every night
[27:03] an angel come to you therefore by Sunday
[27:08] Jesus going to be here
[27:11] amen but said
[27:13] no he had to hide that because they
[27:17] expecting Jesus in corpor but but Jesus
[27:19] was there this Sunday because the S AG
[27:21] was
[27:23] Christ that's it so the guy pick
[27:26] up what was
[27:28] happening and he spoke it but God had to
[27:32] just cover it over and Veil it he said
[27:34] no don't think so have to talk cover for
[27:36] not to see it but when the Sunday came
[27:40] and he was answering the
[27:42] question they asked a question
[27:45] pertaining to Revelation CH 5 amen that
[27:48] they sang a new song and the person
[27:50] asked them are those the rapt Saints or
[27:53] the redeemed Saints was hting he said no
[27:56] this new and he just went on
[27:58] but then the angel in
[28:00] him he said something wrong that is
[28:03] Christ because he answer the question
[28:06] wrong God is vindicating what the
[28:08] prophet say he would not let them answer
[28:10] no question wrong because it's Christ
[28:12] the word is in the prophet you
[28:15] understand he said something wrong amen
[28:19] he said someone said read over the
[28:21] question and read it over when he said
[28:24] oh my look at here he said they sang a
[28:27] new song thou has redeemed us he said
[28:30] these are the redeemed he said look at
[28:33] that he would not let me answer it wrong
[28:37] I felt like was robbing taking a child
[28:39] toy or something he was so convicted
[28:42] because the angel which is Christ that
[28:45] was in the
[28:46] prophet did not let the prophet answer
[28:49] the question wrong because this is God
[28:51] the
[28:52] Worden now here what
[28:54] happened brother
[28:57] Bram
[28:59] reveal all the Mysteries which is really
[29:00] Christ in the prophet doing that while
[29:02] he was alive and God took the prophet
[29:07] home but R 10
[29:10] said go to the
[29:13] angel and take the book and eat the
[29:18] book that is for every bride member to
[29:24] do if youve been to the angel amen and

[29:51] fulfilled Revelation 11 which is to come

[34:53] whole hurricane feature fli up the whole
[34:56] screen on the computer

[35:05] devil coming to destroy this place this
[35:08] never happened to me before
[35:10] since and I got in a challenging spirit
[35:13] and started to
[35:15] pray and I said
[35:19] Lord have
[35:20] mercy upon these poor people in Mexico
[35:24] you are God you can Cal this St
[35:29] the mileage was 200 M hour the hurricane

[36:12] heart that God has intervened for the
[36:15] people in Mexico with that storm am so
[36:19] when I heard the news I like to praise
[36:21] could and thank him for what he did the
[36:24] hurricane bypassed the two major cities
[36:26] that each one of 200,000 people and went
[36:30] up in the hills they said I think so far
[36:31] it's been about six deaths amen it

[36:40] wherever they are when the anointing
[36:43] comes upon you because you can't do it
[36:45] in
[36:46] yourself but God is your

[58:57] evening for I have received of the
[59:00] Lord that which also I delivered unto
[59:04] you that the Lord Jesus the same night
[59:07] in which he was betrayed took
[59:10] bread and when he had given thanks he
[59:13] broke it and said take eat this is my
[59:17] body which is broken for you this do in
[59:20] remembrance of
[59:23] me after the same manner also he took
[59:25] the cup when he had SED saying this cup
[59:29] is the New Testament in my blood this do
[59:32] ye as often as he drink it in
[59:35] remembrance of
[59:36] me for as often as eat this bread and
[59:40] drink this cup ye do show the Lord's
[59:43] death till he
[59:45] come
[59:46] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[59:49] and drink this cup of the Lord
[59:51] unworthily shall be guilty of the blood
[59:54] of the body and blood of the Lord
[59:57] but let a man examine himself and so let
[1:00:00] him eat of that bread and drink of that
[1:00:03] cup for he that eateth and drinketh
[1:00:06] unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation
[1:00:08] to himself not Discerning the Lord's
[1:00:11] body for this cause many are weak and
[1:00:14] sickly among you and many sleep for if
[1:00:18] we would judge ourselves we should not
[1:00:20] be judged but when we are judged we are
[1:00:23] chastened of the Lord that we should not
[1:00:26] be condemned with the
[1:00:28] world Amen praise God let's just bow our
[1:00:31] heads and close our eyes
[1:00:34] hallelujah hallelujah thank you Jesus
