that you'd get this last day bright you're doing all of that that your blood can make a way for us that we could comment the presents Lord and we can only be in presence because of your blood when we thank you for the blood we talked about the price of a speed that would give us opportunity father now if you put your word Lord hide behind a cross hide me under your blood Lord and speak to your people father made Olivia with life with Olivia which Trank made Olivia with encouragement middle easier with power made Olivia Dean inspired the press there was a mark of the high calling granted Lord in Jesus name I ask it amen god bless you tongues to come in hey bye buzzer I get a T into three portions scripture tonight Luke chapter 11 we want to read from verse 1 to 10 Philippians chapter 3 I want to read from verses 13 to 14 and Ephesians 4 I want to read verse 11 to 13 and the title of the message tonight is perseverance there's one word as we have one would do we have one would run with perseverance reading from a look chapter 11 with one came the pass as he was praying in a certain place when he ceased one of these typos said unto Him Lord teach us to pray as John also taught his disciples and Jesus said unto them when you pray say our Father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done as in heaven so in earth give us this day by day our daily bread forgive us our sins for we also forgive everyone that is indebted unto us and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil and he said unto them which of you have a friend I shall go in unto him at midnight and seein time friend let me tree lose for a friend of mine is in his journey has come to me and I have nothing to set before him and he is from within shall answer troubled me not the door is now shut my children are with me in bed I cannot rise and give thee I send to you though he will not rise and give him because he's his friend but this part is very important he's not going to rise because he's your friend yet because of his importunity one on a line that were an opportunity he would rise and give him as many as he needed and I said to you ask it shall be given you seek ye shall find knock it shall be opened unto you for every one that asketh receiveth he that seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be opened we're gonna stop right there what about the next scripture and this is Paul speaking in Philippians chapter 3 verse 13 brethren I count not myself table apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth underdosing who shall before I press towards the mark of the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus our last scripture from Ephesians of the four was 11 and they gave some apostles and some prophets some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the of the body of Christ till we all come into the unit of fate unity of the faith and of the none of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ may God bless his word you may be seated praise be to Jesus annalee amplified of Philippians of the tree Paul was seeing here in verse 13 I do not consider brethren that I've captured and made it my own yet but one thing I do it is my one aspiration forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead I like that part streaming forward towards lies I had I press on to what the goal to win the supreme and heavenly price to which God in Christ Jesus and calling us upward hallelujah that's how we press in straining not just waiting for something to come here with straining pushing press him he pressed towards the mark of the cycle so the ninety tireless perseverance the subject is the bright slippery cool another an inspiration the high calling in Christ Jesus hallelujah the high callin in Christ Jesus and there's another context if I wanted to use from sin John 15:7 if he abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will and shall be done unto you herein is my father glorified that you bear much fruit so shall ye be my disciples so that much fruit is the target that much fruit is the goal Gordo just wants your beer he want to be a much fruit hallelujah believer no before he got to the much fruit part which is the target which is the goal which adoption which is God's purpose that he wants in your life he doesn't want Baroness he doesn't want never on food for life he wanted to be something he wanted to produce something he wants something from you before we get to the target he said I am the vine same chapter of 50 novel of John all right I am the true vine not vine the True Vine and my father is a husband man hallelujah every branch in me that beareth NOT fruit he taketh away if you know I be a nothing you go cut you off you don't want your unfruitful you can't be on your own hallelujah I have to find out how you could fulfill this will of God how you could connect to the program of God because this is the vision be made clear or being made plain because if you don't know what the goal is you can't press if you don't know what it is you can't go on to it you just making signals but you have to have a sense of direction of where is the goal where's the target what am I not hallelujah because in life if you don't have a target if you're over em you'll just go to life aimlessly just wonder and praise God making circles in the wilderness but when you have a target you holding our friends who connect it with that target you have Scripture committed to that target you're thinking about that target you're pressing towards that goal you're sleeping about it you're thinking about it you're dreaming about it you're talking about it you're eligible about it because in that target you wanna watch oh oh glory know God hallelujah and our target is a high calling not many a call to this thing you not calling everybody else some can be slackers but not you some could like but not you something put water and do that but not you because you have a higher calling or chlorine or go ahead and turn Mack your press on your veer towards this high callin every branch in me that beareth NOT fruit he take it away and every branch in me that beareth fruit he purges it that it may bring forth more fruit or glory Devon or fruit you're not gonna make it and when they started when food these are the purge hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah poor glory does go when you see people when you see people going to stuff to know that they're in something so course at the place them because they have something that they start to produce something on us well I should have gone see something like separation but then here come here come here chop them here chop them here what's the purpose of that let's continue now you were clean to the world which I've spoken unto you abide in me and I in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine so he gives you know that you can be a fruit on your own you can feel led to bear your own fruit you in trouble hallelujah there's only one way to bear fruit you have to abide in me and I in you Oh glory to God you hear what I said this has nothing to do with church [Music] vexed with your husband invented your wife invention and innovation Ebola this unknown to me that thanks for the elderly effects ready pass the effects with the deccan effects with anybody it's something do with that this is ye abide in me and my words abide in you your prayers will be answered nobody got keep you back from that if you abide in me I'm not gonna charge us a you wanna pass that me and I say you want a deacon and me and I say you any message poop on me it has enough of that if you abide in me let's continue abide in me and I am you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can ye except ye abide in me the beautiful thing about it the vine is depend upon the branch to be a fruit so the vine need the branch God need you to be that branch that the life of the vine can flow to the bank because you not being your own life it's not your life it is his life don't have to flow from the vine to you then your family will see it your husband will see you your friends will see it it's not an imaginary life Journal it's a real life that have to express itself it's in the vine but look at the branches and I seen the branch come the life pushing pushing pushing pushing pushing the light trying to get into you you know don't forget in life towards you the life trying to push you have to make room to push or get the Lord I show tonight then he said I am the vine you are the branches he was the baddest than me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit so it more fruit much fruit isn't that right it's continued for without me you can do nothing so this year is not husband enough to help you it's not why I have to give his support it's not the past I have to be there for you without me your noon with me I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me so Christ have to become your rock your song your source your strength your guide hallelujah do you know if you remember talk some time ago a couple of months ago about one of the songwriters who lost his girlfriend and she had died and he got an ex a friend and then she died and what was the song that he wrote anybody remember there was another one I wanted two biggest hymns and Christendom precious Lord is with Dorsey when his wife died and somebody saw and said Oh say Lord say precious Lord right they said precious Lord take my hand lead no dying that jokey Christianity Oh God oh she did oh that is true connection with the father that is true connection with God but a Branham lost his wife he lost his daughter that is genuine experiences you can't imagine that and he is trying to save people and the devil talking them he said lucky wooden man say a prayer your daughter dying he wouldn't heal her and he had to come to this spot way said the Lord give the Lord taketh away the devil messing with his mind for him to give up he didn't say God go answer pray and he said not even in others in yours he not telling you not tell me proper God on soprano he's not gonna answer yours you see where you're getting and he understood years later he was just mean tested [Music] because when I started their fruity [Music] so you give him the spoken word he given miracles he's got to bear fruit the other ministry and Cass no Devils and I'm doing this I represent the faith my way of a divine gift but God the one that he one morning he want to place him to bring forth much fruit because he's glorified and sons producing much fruit so we accept this night to see where we are going that we are not to remain as we are but we have to forget what is behind us and see what we must what what it must capped up what we might attain true and when you see it you could press towards it you don't know what you must have not come to church to make up numbers but just press into the stature of a perfect man which is the bride's earthly gold if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned then he said if he abide in me and my words about you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you herein is my father glorified that you bear much fruit so shall ye be my disciples adoption there in much fruit o glory of God so God I want to be a sucker barely hanging in not producing anything at all shame and embarrassment when you go for affected areas Christi victory Allah he had no fruit only for tree Allah he said you suppose are things like no you come and see a crispy the fig tree next they received refer me roots the key willing me time welljust custody hungry could do some boy thing no fix curse that she is that she should have exactly we could call might make something with some thicken thick soup or something so next day in cyprus exclaimed master the trees china from the roots then jesus said if ye shall say to the mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart now he is pointing into something that they're not ready for yet but they have to press on into he is pointing them to a manifestation of spoken word power that will be resident in the sons of God in the last days the message got no spoken word power that would be resident in the sons of God in the last days God going to be veiled in your heart you would never intellect your head gospel you're gonna have a hot gospel or give the Lord some praises glory love God Alleluia the script to be read the friend came

delay in achieving success or delay in achieving success like I say a blessing to be delayed delayed but not denied because your son got have to have your access to the kingdom even though the engines

passage arrived in time if you stop your re the other take taxi on maximum right a bicycle or something but if you want to drive and you have to get your life now if you pass you tell if you have to go to tell time same time it's over the Louisville tent and afterwards this table for driving a guy who laughing on when it's not a bear fruit who laughing now they laugh at you The words were chosen and life hallelujah so after the Holy Ghost talking about child trained sanctification in behavior conduct maturing right Ninh seasoned and adoption so in other words becoming more mature you handling your problems differently because you're not like a child when you're like a child you speak like a child you act like a child but as they become mature we seen issues that you're mishandled 20 years ago your copies doing the same stripping us now you have to handle it better because you're 20 years older in mine and spirit isn't that right hallelujah praise God so God is wanting his sons to come into this maturity of this wood Abidin and I want to get something because it's coming from my heart from this touch a perfect man I know his things that we heard before I don't want to take too long with you but here we go 72 changes seven steps God building his church is like one person individual so this is what God hid from the devil the seven steps the devil did not know that truly ages God was actually bringing steps that will be in his people as individuals so don't want to stare detail changes I want to bring it on to the individual so all these mysteries here we go that was hidden truly ages is he's in you because the mystery is Christ and every age Christ was the mystery that was hit and revealed you the mystery unfolded and what holy life thundered against the devil in every age because the devil did not could not pursue a canary age even in the Dark Ages when he was killing them thus he was going on you come pentecost up results on william alley and random so the devil lost about their age or chlorine up caught by the oxen item Pagal on anoint him spider-man anoint him by the eagle anoint him you is one buddy I know you that life and remain magneton to pay them you the same he brought his church up the same way he is bringing his people up here Peter said first seven things faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly love hissing of the Holy Ghost and you got all these virtues shielding you so the Pentecostals did not have the true baptism of the Holy Ghost they were still in the womb they were still be lucky because the word produced a bit and the Prophet had the word to produce the Brit so the pelicans I didn't have that bit or glory of God all right and you got all these what you see on you then then God lives in a tabernacle she wore it was come upon you then God lives in a tabernacle called the building the living tabernacle of the living costume Allen please when a man possesses these kind of things then the holy will come upon you now the Holy Ghost came upon Judas Peter all the sciples 82 of them but the deadly virtues in them that Holy Ghost upon them because Christ gave them power to work with him and you can work with Christ with books and tapes and hung out tracts you have to have got the anointing of Christ so he placed and anointed he said Judas ministries was not inferior to anyone else he was anointed with the same only cause Peter was anointed with but there was no virtues inside idea and he was a devil but he was anointed with spirit so he's not talking body anointing or spirit he's talking about the virtues in and the whole in compounds that that's different good we get it all that show that is different so do you see what you're fighting for you fighting for that you're not fighting for some anointing you're fighting for that to come into the measure of the stature of Jesus Christ that is the bright really cool to be a perfect 180 yeah I want to be perfect to go to heaven you you would have want to be perfect no you will be perfect on the earth what yes people look at me like a strange things I don't want to prove it to you membrane automata poofing manna needs God said so I can't explain that my intellect is that under figure at all I am going to be a perfect man on the do it [Music] thank my prophecy perfect man that's what promised I want nothing short of that I want a man hoping for the grace of God Oh perfect man got it yeah when my father glorified perfect man but I do wanna make a perfect man God will be glorified in you perfect man 170 please the reveal is shown on me Oh glory to God that's a parcel ran it pleased God to reveal his son in me perfect man only eight everybody go have that perfection like a preacher only you know the Bible said till we all come in the unity of the faith if there are none of the Son of God unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ or glory of God so you have a goal to get the measure your measure of the stature of the fullness Oh glory to but not your measurement North in your measure of the stature Oh glory to God when a man possesses these virtues then the Holy Ghost comes upon him he said no matter what you might speak in tongues you might be poisonous any gift that God's got you might do that but until here we go but I can't lay these virtues here go into you you are off the real true foundation of feet now these words are deep they are weighted words I like to call it listen this party and when these virtues grow in little different not brilliant Faden in virtue but if there was seven breadsticks and personally I go home seven deep spreads when these virtues grow in you added that then you are a living monument you are a living moving either then he talked about we're not in an imaginary way but we proceed also before a living God and he said I live in future you cannot comment tell me better to you I see did I see I see this in you I see that in you I went to preach that the other night there's a confirmation of what I see about you and I know like like you had opted but you already knew it don't come with that foolishness I have to know what's living in me you can tell me that and I'll be a receiver to accept what you tell me about me and I accepted you know since a sister send an email or citizen a confirmation of my adoption yeah run alternately anything bombed when I bought them from an eye [Music] god I have no comment of general didn't like the cheesy and fundamental that we write them so reason that's imagination a man's man yell Balram speak he would in Italy type that was not option God has given him to protest give him faith to move mountains Porto but as you know I'm a graffiti monk and booth and he said faith can bring miracles and that in my spiritual heart it has some people have ridiculous wager then Pentecostal used to take Peter and all the foot until I moved and I walk there was already a no they might come from some crazy kind of regional meeting understand somebody went a well that never had water in it or the well drops along take a class or what can said this I do in the name of Jesus Christ poor glass of water he where they spring up as a double water all kind Americas with Vlad what are going on a man say he speak to the time as the water come forth and what is the commodified I can explain them things but there's an adoption Paul say do I have faith to move mountains and have not the holy ghost itself coming upon me and that only coming when these virtues are in so when God sees it is that come facility your Bosca is fact it has nothing more to be added oh I feel like preaching right now listen he said when you want to get closer to God what you already seeing you want to grow in God because he's on the seventh step so you're stepping Leroy in future knowledge to get in the era what presence more glory more anointed and when you're soaked into the the brotherly kindness not already for the anointed to cap it off then you're no longer you when you see me you see my father because the vine and the branches blend into one now they vine have a direct connection when the vine likes that the flow if you had job done like like you put a lock on valve lady branch the branch would evolved it when if I look at the Sun in life even a bombs come up you're a piece of hatred a port fight it or just make some big valley odds lock of the anointing day when many many florists prefer to move day and this brother here the next brother this minister customer next minister the viola from there and he preached in looking for the anointing no one noise he don't understand he can look of that that that little thing lock him off you know then you see the church against the next stage then the whole church lock off their mana channel now just he and them alone them all to divine all together enough nothing Florizel there you know just talk just will this interpretation that's just human element human effort human unknowing tell human whatever they have no vine connected to branch for the flow of the Spirit because the up you times yes exactly oh I thought it was repaired Nicki Minaj's and church and pews and everything else oh no no no no no daddy shall I run the preparation that is like when you have a Christmas gift and you have a box and you have nice flowers and written and it and card and thing I learned some time is that what I only care who send this and after insane Oh holy and use a dirty object on quantum level excitement people who won we left we you know kinda simply

else will you build me when heaven is my throne on earth is my footstool what house will you build me where the body has not prepared let's continue ho praise God and then God makes a living man a living image in his touch of God what is he doing he's doing the same thing Jesus did because he's walked and the same things he did because he's not imaginary thing there is a reality here you go but hungry there's a reality proves it you see what I mean you see all these virtues and these materials type them with the church messengers but the church it is now one of these days we're gonna take each one of these words and study them I'm sure the proves that all goes together I want to say tonight it all goes together this is the house of God dwells in not a building with a big Bell on top of

blood back in him he's gonna live again he took it but oh no we have got to put the blood of Jesus in see that brings the fate of Jesus the virtue of Christ the knowledge of Jesus the temperance of Jesus Christ the patience of Jesus Christ regardless of Jesus Christ the burn Kaiser's and I like how he specified like that because you have your own natural body kindness in natural patience in natural you know whatever not sure we not talk about your natural stuff we talking about this is of Jesus Christ see so the blood follows the way all through the book of redemption and when that blood comes the brings life it's not right he said there is a perfect man of God when he possesses these virtues I didn't think I get that there is this is a goal this is a goal there is the perfect man of God so when I say but over he will prove money this is what talking about you know when he possesses these virtues not claim to have them possesses that has having these virtues as a possession not a

you let's continue to take a little more caustic otega money Mike so young I know I know getting warm up hallelujah alright so not claiming you have to have an other possession then God represents his church as a bride and the way he brings each individual to being his son to go in that bride he also bring the broader bride to the ages till he brings this one complete church into here this my feet moves because my head says oh it can't move like my hand because it's my feet which I can't do the things that we did neither can the Methodist because there was something else the feet move because they had Cecil the heads never sees no feet you become an heir become eyes each age God has placed these things into his church and patented by showing that each individual has these possess these qualities and this being when it's completed is the church that go in the rapture and this being when it's completed is the servant of God in the Church of God that's going in a rapture so Minister could talk all he talk preach how much mystery you wanna preach on fall all kind of revelation like crazy except this in him he stayed with the rest of the church any revelation because this being not my feelings this being not my mysteries this being my knowledge not this information I'm unfolding this being when it's completed is the servant of God in the church of god not halfway completed not halfway when it is completed or glory that God is the servant of God in the church of god that's going in a rapture so wrapt is that a mysterious thing it's an inside Oh King you have to have the

you see that is this excited this in you know mastica step you new middle that could stop you nobody can holy backfire rapture or glory to God hallelujah think about it the man brought some friends to drink home I'm carrying home and a 20 foot and he flow and walking and thing and his wife singing sweetly mop up and clean up the place and after all the months you see is he I tell you she's a Christian now if she dropped the boom on them and put some mouth on them and say listen mister man don't let them people come back in my house you see what talking about that been beaten wife and mouth pal punch and wife that had acted for that tenant that stay right Jamie trouble is generally where the rest of the tribulation scenes are pulling them one time tribulation scenes in other words that behavior is the bright material that's why when them guys and a Cosworth engine so long how long event just what's a butt around said that is not night material because bright material go call for vengeance or kill the Lord I shout right material say Father forgive them they know not what they're doing but I know where I'm going Oh hallelujah help me tonight help me be tonight there is no excuse to have awesome grudges in this age of brotherly kindness with all brotherly kindness you're not even in a message without brotherly kindness you have no blood on you this is the blood for the Aged this is the bloggers giving a fifth to advert you see it is based upon forgiveness you came is tackle of that that's a big one tonight but a punch you came suffered a brotherly kindness but it is your spirit of forgiveness and it's be simple forgiveness to even start after forgiveness just hit the old tub or chlorine of dirt hallelujah so when you stand praying for charity the bride's absolute when you stand praying for the goal hallelujah forgive if you have a loan against e Oh another ticket I'm pretty for charity I'm a big lump of Drudge inside your heart and your spirit what I supposed to work rough never you will steal back any tribulation hearing things your hairy pieces some come knockin II adore focus on the target focus on the goal hallelujah to be a statue of a perfect man and yet any massive in priest not connection with that voice but that life is the wrong message this is the message I really for you is I did that come to bill another denomination I came to bring individuals into the touch of a perfect man that is the message of all the mysteries all the hidden mysteries written mysteries unknown mysteries no unknown whatever they call it somebody's top and mysteries too bad till the life is a mystery animal dies the part into mysterious take a tiny part come forward not here after all you're talking mushy let me see moving on with your life now let me see or your life being unfolded there because Peter was very plain and on silver I'm going up I know sir rise up and walking in my Jesus Christ after I sees a bunch of legs again licks alone not pleasure Peter man they get so mad they said that because it devolution on Deficit but his Jesus come back again I took I thought I finish with yet ivory look looking life what about the branch start a manifest the fruit the same fruit that Jesus had and multiply power then was one man no as many men no and the undefined that of the Spirit life's at the floor and when them fellows get a little they gather together again they say Lord God send down your power that we could call back out and be a more fruit and that you be glorified them fellas was taken blows like nothing but it was running and operating for God there were channels of communications reporters entropy and he was not mean courts erroneous house among us he dead the holy God see what he was born in it's one Lord what and once you whole if you had to go to anybody with what's being asked such simplicity he's a major posture of it and God said this being you have to have this being let me drop this bomb on you something you're familiar with always seen it he said the ministry has reached perfection when Christ is made manifest in natural that is the word mean listen the whole structure of your bein is governed and controlled by these things remember we spoke about when these things are upper region and you by the spirit not by repetition not by I know I have to behave myself so I'm on believers abusing myself or when with your cousin and aunt or your sister you carry on like if nobody the wrong sometimes people you behave today I believe seems like what that but when you're among the pigs and so on you show your colors and the mud you know you're in the mud like everybody else proven that these things not really in is the pig nature with a boat I enjoy well-behaved because of environment not because of Nietzsche when you hit the pig run on your head mud run yeah go you could see where your watch good will your water yeah yeah how much church friends because you have the worldly friends you have been natural friends because it's a setup beating them but once they enter chip on your bowtie and you get polish Dominus put some spray and you smelling good and so on like that and you put in your best foot forward god bless you oh yeah see they put their best foot forward we're not talking about that these things have to be operated in you by the spirit all right no less quality but you know he said the whole statue of your pian is governed and controlled by these things but it cannot be completely controlled till it's completely possess these qualities so we talking about not so much how much Holy Ghost you have but how much Holy Ghost have you where you're no surrender that's that's the Abidin you are abiding me in' and i by and by the you know param went in deeper now he's here team is the strongest of this weakest link so it's no strongest weakest thing no matter how much drawn these are built up this is built up its got if there is a weak link the 8 bricks nobody Bonham was referring to the chalkboard join which is that perfect man join if you possess you say you got this distance and don't have districts so you don't have patience at Greeks you have somebody rest but it bricks if you have got temperance control you're flying loose anything a your blood dais skin you running that blood transfusion you need a whole blood you blood little off on your skin there so somebody else I'm the Earl I mean so for me you saw some young you a small people know you're a big pit bull and any husband again bro so he said watch now if you possess this and this and this on doing out this it bricks if you've got this and I've got this you brick right here now you've got this haven't got this every brick now watch no hairy part want to get to now when you surrender your complete pian here we go then the holy spirit just push through you in these virtues so it's not very fluent in you know because the Pentecostal that's why when burns are a vision of the man speaking in tongues and then seem living with somebody else and so on they were being used by the Spirit of God but the lights was contrary so God decide to do something different he put the wooden men and used the wooden man so now we're looking at this know these virtues as a vehicle as a channel of God that God using this vehicle in you so then you becomes a channel of God not you in yourself but true these virtues in you the virtues become the conductor we are say the word as a conductor but the word and sprit is one so quote put the word and you the secret is what the word is in the pride now the word really is that so now was that what you have inside of you see by Molina the Bible is a Soria this physical Bible and the Perman so to get the primitive you the preaching of the word come to you so God put the word gospel spirit spoken word to come into you and God drop the word into your heart then you have the word in your heart that word in hack is also the pyramid in your heart so you already have the pyramid in mechanic's form which is the kingdom he said the kingdom is within you which is the word but the word of the telling the power to be the kingdom in you then there's a manifestation inside of you would mean flesh we attend the spirit taint the spirit and power so faith is in you see then God did not fare over the spirit then he spirit free things out of you hurt you inside of you see got in that fight with you over spirit your food your power knowledge and you see the spirit knowledge spirit all these things aspirational knowledge share that information you know is the knowledge of God by spirit temperance patience godliness and from temperance faith virtue knowledge what God give you temperance is where you are the diode that were to see when they did their own temperance where you have to tie out and exercise temperance control over the tongue and he first troubled people that tongue is trouble you know that from the doctor put a plane in trouble he's a master perfect man he can brighter his tongue see any wrong thing saying what we shouldn't say talking all the time and have a problem keeping silent have a boo listening that you can learn and some people not willing to learn so they're not willing to listen when its begin to listen when you certain listen is when you begin to learn I ain't talking oh yeah I hear ya let's give me put some comfort that you hear hear oh yeah yeah you know they say you know if we give them to them talk so for them to not to know you're suddenly hostile you see here because if they said not till my tongue like a rude see I Here I am I know nothing ball in overtalk emotional I know you know exactly why talking about some all you could see invented that what is any members when you're listening you're not hearing you're listening you want to know because sometimes a person can be seen something I did not seen it correctly you're not seeing it right did not bring any right words across the not have any right way to presented but you want to know what you really want to see I know you're seeing something what you want to see because you want to catch and listening hearing is when you understand you really see it that's my husband and wife are some of the issues sometimes wife seen son - she likes talking in tongues got a husband not hearing at all uni I hear you share the key got here the game to petition of those tones so I'm gonna be husband talk and me why 50 gentle she not here in English yeah here she's not listening because about changes yesterday and she want to know why she behaving so when he said that yesterday but she didn't here like yesterday she was ready born here yeah she wasn't listening so instead of all these interpersonal tungsten wine talk I'm communicating well and why not listen well why not ask am I getting you I remember some time my wife will be Pat for marriage that was good she wanted to know how she coming across she wasn't taking what she's in for granted because sometimes husband neither interpretation because he busy busy year I was another sign talking from from reality from experience but afterwards I learned to busy on this so I could tell you that you need to listen some people here in Leawood and eyeballing me many memories a fall asleep in church already become hallelujah his first reaction when you wake up engine but if you are talking about the parents hallelujah he when he wakes up water his sleep with a hallelujah he hear nothing they look confirmation and nothing you can give the drunk man a gospel in he drunk he can hear it which over the enemies over so when you come you can be I'll be sober here distinctly and clearly that it could be clarified to you division can be care to you oh this is not about church this is about you as an individual commented that perfection let me speak a wrap up here no wow oh my so then you surrender your complete pian then the Holy Spirit just pours through you in these virtues then you are living tabernacle then people look and say that's a man full of virtue knowledge he believes the word temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness full of the Holy Ghost he is walking around what is it the stature that unbelievers can look and say there is a Christian that is a man or woman who knows what they're talking about you never see a kinda sweeter godly a person nice big words kinda that would have it a night way sweeter sweet ah sweet my godly a person you are sealed a scene shows on both sides whether you're going or coming you seem just the same there you are when a man a woman possesses this then the capstone comes down and seals them into the kingdom which is the Holy Ghost and that makes this a complete being a tabernacle of the Living God a walking living example of Christianity their life is dead hidden Christ to God seal there by the Holy Ghost you reckon and self dead you were born of faith and virtue and all these things is added to you till you are perfect limits image of God he said isn't that wonderful and God true that has brought seventy ages to show the seven steps and he brought building his individual into his image he built a complete Church in His image and at the resurrection this complete body will be raised up to live with him forever because it is the bride so he cuts it in every age every age that is to come Oh glory to God so to be persistent is make a goal and to put something over to try to do something you have to be persistent when you are persistent no all Christians here we go almost in oceans now all Christians must be persistent I want to see that to me all Christians must be persistent aha so that means it cannot be set down and Gordo will get out you know go go bless me God will help me you know trust me no no no all questions must be persistent that mean all Christians inaudible because you have to persist or something you have to vent or something to be persistent you have to have a target that way Paul said forgetting these in the past because you can't go back running forward at the same time you can't drive in a rearview mirror you'll get an accident you have to cut off at what is behind you fail you fall you'll slip your best behavior whatever it is that's the past where you going on where you hadn't known because once you have any right direction you could move on all Christian must be persistent there must be Verint and the only way to do this is the first have faith in what you are trying okay we have something here see no don't what perseverance everything is on now praise the Lord amen so watch and if you have no faith you're jumping at it you can't not be Verret but when you already know it's the truth there is nothing to stop you from ready people severan man of all ages that ever be able to do anything had faith in what they were trying to do more perseverant Moses was brilliant okay I'll gonna skip to quickly Crooked Stick was good enough he had me in the presence of God before he ran no presence stick position we're going Moses to Egypt to do what to take over a man with a stick Oh glory to God no matter how many treatment Egypt had it didn't mean nothing to Moses he had been in the presence of God and he was Lucy there and he was going on to take over again shields and trained man by tens of thousands nothing was going to stop him because he heard the voice of God he said check it out must be a scripture voice oh praise God and that's the reason he said with Sampson and that's the reason wasn't the Apostles Jesus chose to Jesus chose them practically every one of them without even enough education to sign their name what's the choice so he's not reading writing arithmetic it wasn't he educated punch and his disciples have degrees it wasn't that listen not one of them with education to sign a name he didn't choose freeze Bible study people he didn't choose to you know jumps between fishermen and herdsmen so he could take that in his hand take nothing and make something out of it now that this is Nietzsche he doesn't take train schools choose colors he takes something that realizes it is nothing and he gets him to it and make something out of it Oh glory to God hallelujah Samson music Tom please when they spray the Lord come upon him if he had nothing when the Sperry came upon him he feared nothing why he was persistent as long as he could feel the NASA I Bollywood forward him so when Sampson put back his head and feel the 7 lakhs he know nothing could stop him he beaten lion he bees in a thousand men with helmets on them he's taken away kids and I'm walking through gates why was upon him you say how much or the church didn't come around how much the church tonight that claims to be born of the Spirit of God stand in the meeting and see this vindication of the resurrected Jesus Christ and claim to be filled with the Holy Ghost and cut sit still and let's sit and push you along like he does hallelujah be persistent press stay with it whoo glory to God and today we claim to have the Holy Ghost and cowardly with it and free to move out we have got to be persistent if we got the genuine Holy Spirit we will be persistent about the clothes as a mission come up the whole arm of God is supernatural what is the arm of God love what is love you say love your love and so on it's supernatural Gordon supernatural you cannot sound a physically proved God no feat finds a source that others don't see so when you need faith finds a source that others don't see and that's the reason all this this is beautiful this is beautiful nothing else can do it nothing else he said no you said you have to see something otherwise scientific what you cannot do it is hid from you so forget about everything else when God has anything is really hidden and that's the reason that you are so hidden if you are Christian for you are dead and your life is hidden God - Jesus Christ see by the Holy Ghost how's it ever gonna find you he can't do it God have you hidden God hates you what a hiding place in the bosom of Jesus Christ no fear Oh glory to God hallelujah so this woman came to Jesus my daughter is texture than ever hallelujah praise God she worship he says it's not fit to take the transparent cast as a dog and she stood there she said you're not of my race your skin different you have a different race she called her she was called a dog but she had feared she was disappointed with all her friends disappointed with her people all kind of things trying to hinder her but everything was trolling away that shows Satan trying to push back genuine faith but he can't do it don't care what anybody else says she was persistent she kept moving on she said truth Lord see it will always admit that the world is right regardless of what your situation is once the word speak to you she would admit that the word is right she said truth Lord but the dogs can eat crumbs from under the master's table she wasn't a hybrid Bunch she was a believer oh she had genuine faith and she was a Gentile it is here what I'm trying to say to you friends we are going to have a prayer line
