promise of light Jesus said lo I will be with you even to the end of the earth I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you but I will be with you in the trial in the testing and the Bible says in him is light it's not right in him there is no darkness at all and when the topless saw it it comprehended it not Oh hallelujah that's why when the devil look at us tonight he cannot understand why you

the countries creeping into the justice system they legalize and all kinds of stuff praise God hallelujah buddy wake up with a whim or fancy pre is going to have a law for it they making provision for it they wanted to be socially acceptable isn't that right but Cod is a call of his word and we are promised that in this hour of toughness we are promised and it's our color evil and a man and formality that is gonna come up pride it's gonna come up anointing of lights to come upon your soul and to come upon the word see that is in your soul tonight that light is gonna come up punish and make it live tonight Oh tonight a few positives because in all of this darkness in all of this season ISM in all of this evil in all of this in this corrupt God is gonna call a price out of all of that God is gonna call you out of all of that God's gonna pull your soul out of the world and plug it into Christ pull your soul out of the attempts of the enemy out of everything that the devil tried to do God's gonna pull your soul out of it no matter how much years of slavery fearow try to inflict upon the people there was always a word stored up there for the children of Israel to pull from the Bible said I heard a cry for my people God chillie heard the cries of Israel honor in the time and season as they were anointing the promised word for their team Oh I want you to catch something now and talk God spoke to Abraham pulling at his children with so children a strange land but in a mighty handy he'll take them out that world was always laying there they may not have been need for it when choose it was around and different things isn't that right but the world was always there and we have a promise of the world tonight coming to a manifestation because that's what the light is when the light of the day is shining upon you it is a manifestation of the word for all day that's what that is is that right and what we're looking for what we honor expectation for is a manifestation of what the Prophet said hallelujah amen what he spoke a promise of dynamics he said this bride hasn't had a revival yet or her but she's pointing to have it those seven unknown thunders will wake up or he will send it he promised it o prophet said so and we're here to believe it tonight we had a pray for it we had a beyond that expectation for it [Music] God will not fail us and he will not forsake us a man so the world was always me Leonie God had already prophesied that over his seed that it shall possess the gate of the enemy isn't that right that a mighty hand you'll bring them out and bring it into their own land and my people shall never be ashamed a man L eaten plenty and they be satisfied and they praise the name of their God from this time forth that's a prophecy hanging over you but now there might have been need for it yet time had to roll along and it makes me think about that scripture praise God when I Jesus told a parable about the sower how the husbandmen went forth and sold seeds and any even one come my light on so other seeds praise Niraj and he said look master look what the evil one has done shall we reap it now and he said no let the two go together until the time of the harvest praise God night and I love sent for the Reapers because by your fruits you will know them you will know the ones that sleep with the word and you'll know the ones that fell away prease gone into their own interpretations but my word I will restore my word I will anoint my word I will bring to pass Oh glory to God are you happy tonight that you stayed with that word aren't you happy tonight that you stayed with the reveal with a monocot for harlot that word cannot fall to the ground every vision of the prophets all came to pass and just as every vision shall come to pass the prophet saw bride walking in her sweetness in humility that vision will come to pass tonight oh that bride will come into view Ohan only on the people that will make up that bride is sitting in this audience here tonight you me hallelujah who stayed with that word you have a promise hallelujah to walk with the Messiah right out of here praise God into glory land the eleven tonight get a lot of shout of praise [Applause] [Music] we man I believe in so now there was a need for a deity time hadn't come in yet the word uncommented season and that's all we're looking for the word to come at a season and now we lower revivals was ready to break forth but a revival don't coming out of Boonen without a sacrifice without a burden for it and now we see cross darkness rolling out in this message and we see after the years of rule by the ones that have sleep with the word and the ones that are falling away hey man ma taught us world is being proven right there on the spot who was really for this gospel and who was on a lot of things it's not right isn't that right who was on other persuasions oh I feel like Paul tonight we are fully persuaded a meant by this word here that what he promised will take place I'm Philippe of Sweden and we can receive the Holy Ghost the same penny to receive holidays in America that different ones who see hallelujah all the brothers all the sisters all 120 was filled with the Holy Ghost amen you can receive it to my sister you can receive it to my brother don't be afraid it's just his presence Oh when you feel it upon your heart reach out and grab it by the Holy Ghost hallelujah grab it by saying Amen because that's your promise Amen hallelujah hallelujah Amen so what we get in the sea now is a word and season it's just like a prophet said you know that world was spinning in chaos he doesn't know he said well we don't know how long that was he said in the beginning there was God said it could be 100 years thousand years he said it was just spinning like that but God spoke a word and said let there be light he said he didn't know long long that took but it didn't matter what mattered was what he said came to pass Amen what matters was when God spoke that like had to come forth didn't matter how long it took didn't matter how long the earth was in darkness they come a point when the word had to come into a manifestation and when it did was be like oh when the word came into a manifestation all the time who was word now well the time was just spoken he spoke it over the darkness and a lady s prophecy nobody knows for how long the prophet said but when it took place when it happened when it materialized God said that is the light hallelujah and everything else was tactless and he separated so when the court spoke to the prophets and set those seven thunders or gonna wake up a bride that word might City for a long time on books and tapes but when that group hallelujah hallelu take the Word of God and hand it there when that materialize that will be the light for this tape get a lot of shadow pray that's what it is man a man in a nutshell it man praise God so we struck it oh I'm so happy to know so that's what the light is it's a manifestation of God for your day isn't that right Peter James and John and then they were living in our revealed light for their day it's not right well Peter walk people in healing a shadow that was a lunch like hallelujah was reflecting and its shadow Halle was anointed his hands was anointed praise corn hallelujah his feet was anointed whatever they said praise God they spoke hallelujah amen and the demons was running what was taking place Amanda liked was being manifested for that thing amen amen we a promise that same evening lunch praise God hallelujah and evening time there shall be light in this tower in this cruel hour and it's ungodly hour there shall be light there'll be healings there'll be manifestations there'll be outpouring of the Holy Ghost missing limbs are very strong the light will be restored in this time in this season many men oh my he's so excited tonight amen amen we see signs of his coming he was last week their healer on the Sun it's not right people are looking at it people made fun of it people I think the same whatever well we know that God is doing something yeah we can't explain all praise God we don't have all the explanations hallelujah but we know God is fixing to move when we see these things approaching look up for every temperature try 9 all rise and shine for thy light has come what is all light hallelujah is it the Sun praise God I don't know but I know this word here says that this sick is gonna be healed the 10 is gonna be raised the cripples are gonna walk the cost was gonna be preaching his power that's what we're looking for in this last day or eyes on the word oh honey are we on trouble alerts praise God because if Elias has already come then we're on of miracles where is the Lord part of Elijah he surely didn't raise a dead if he surely didn't heal the sick then that same spirit that raised Christ from the dead that same spirit that was upon that Elijah its promise to come upon you and manifest the same life same signs same faith let your knowledge temperance ohana ever your same Jesus all over again email your the expectation for a day man Oh hallelujah I always think about slavery the Prophet used to talk about many references about slavery especially wrong Easter time please God he talked about the slave and his slave owners and does that joy of being liberated and I always used to think about that you know just to know that a proclamation of emancipation has gone out and I'd like to think about how those slaves felt when the proclamation was set out they weren't officially free yet there was a day that was set for them to be free isn't that right there was a day in the calendar I was set for them to be free and even though the slave master had his power over them he had a revelation that that power was temporary there's a revelation come on that the slave masters whip was only temporary because they already receive a proclamation of emancipation and tonight's the 700 to Billie trumpet astounding oh and if you want to receive the Holy Ghost the proclamation of emancipation is going out tonight receiving the Holy Ghost the angel of car truck come upon yet hallelujah pixon things are what for for the coming of the Lord oh he's gonna fix your family he's gonna fix your life fix your hearts fix whatever it is to get you ready but a rapture Express lift up your hands oh he's here he's here to meet your need he's here to set the captives free his presence is here to heal every sick today that we afflicted I see no reason why we can't believe God hallelujah there's every reason to have fake there's every reason to pray there's every reason to shout there's every reason to call upon the name of the Lord this is a season now amen oh are we looking for it friends a man Oh hallelujah mine please God I'm just going I'm just going by the spirit tonight a man breeze going on Olivia rise and shine but I let us come by light has come your light has come you have your light you are promised a light the Bible says I've heard the Lord and a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path o in your tablets you are promised a light so don't be afraid tonight step out by faith the light is here to show you how to leave this place oh I'll show you how to leave this world oh honey you keep walking the God and he'll be walking with you and every step you take this one step closer to be in his presence and away from the world and more like Jesus and what do you think is taking place when you pray when you cry out when you reach up a page what are you doing you're walking with cause you'll be coming more like God let's like the world until all of a sudden you one day you'll wake up the Prophet sin and realize that God is in you or how by a manifestation we're not just talking about it but you've got to see living you've got to see reality of calling your life gotta see a Holy Ghost fire come in they're not just talking about it but how do you see the Holy Ghost since you believe as a pillar of fire met you in there have you laid your all on the altar have you turned on that curtain of self-will have you experienced the fire coming to your hatch or then you're only talking about it then you're only playing until the literal fire part comes into your soul it's an experience must match God's word that must match cause Bible and God will know your habits and the devil will know your habits and it will send every demon in your way harder to pull you up that track but you've already caught the offer inside of you oh I don't want to be too much longer yeah man that's what it is means well that's what we that's what we come to church for to get something real all this talk it's got a come down to reality of God in this message of God in the churches I've got enough people I've gotten a young people of calling the elders and the Deacons we got the seat card come back again just like he was in the book of Acts he may isn't that right just like it was back there he's got to be real and living Oh hallelujah harlot a real virtue a real knowledge come to a real Holy Ghost moving among the people where the sick and stay sick sick in that sphere once they come in the demons begin to tremble people to have policy begins to scream holidays begin to straighten out why because it's a presence of the Living cause the same presence of trap darlin Eden and blue the touch and for my notice area that same presence its presence the contents promised to come down in this thing and breathe upon you to lunch and give you an anointing and experience a reality that you'll never be the same can we never walk the same I can we never taught the same at canna we'd have forgiveness we love love we love brotherly kindness we'll have the blood for all age upon our chest will be walking according to that pyramid it's not what you want tonight is that what you need tonight oh I say the always at hand please I'm an ER physician a man of the wood of God today and that will be our light a man have we walk in it Peter and James walked in it why can't we if one man could do it another man could do it if one man could believe God for His healing and receive his healing it ought to give us eight tonight for what part to do tonight's holiday if he could do it back there he could do it tonight if God can deliver back there he can deliver tonight it caught it here back there he can heal tonight if God could steal back there he could see you tonight hallelujah believe in that Paul said all Scripture do for edification a my examples that are gone before us you see what to do and you see what not to do now you see Jonah running from the presence of God a man running away and I matter way he ran God always find him God always found a way to turn it around for the glory of God isn't that nice but I know what does he didn't run like Mary welcomed the angel nope listen highly favored should we see the word forty my god Mary was fearless what a fearless young lady in the face of criticism my god husband-to-be should have this on her for what a second place but Mary stood her ground and said the Holy Ghost spoke to me and told me what was gonna take place doesn't matter where you believe it whether you don't believe it hallelujah Jesus is in me and that's how I feel tonight there'll be a bride on the urge who will confess crisis in me I don't care what do you believe it what do you don't believe it whether the demons go on a rampage we have a revelation that Christ is being formed in us just like he was being formed in Mary oh oh it makes a shout it makes us worship it makes us lift our hands it makes us pray harder it makes us press harder why because we know in who we have believed Peter said we are you see coming advise Peebles is now right we're not preaching stories this is real people real people think about it Mary a young lady young as they come Virgin choose to be married God revealed and she just walked by feet to shelter it just wasn't America chosen the word of the angel interrupted her life it interrupted her plans where she saw herself 15 years down the road or whatever it was interrupted she knew to reproach she had to suffer yet she went willingly priests caught because she knew she believed in a vision that was created on her that she was supreme for the Messiah he promised Messiah for that day oh I feel good tonight appeal aureus to know that we have received a revelation that we are to bring forth Messiah in our team Oh hallelujah brother priests caught it ought to make you jockey jump for joy Amen hallelujah go under Jesus and you'll be sad and it will be joyful fourth season he said but your sorrow will be turned into joy when you begin to see by revelation what he has done in the scripture what he has done in the word he doesn't show it all but he does it then he looks back shows you what he has done and a prophetic ministry looked back and showed us that all down through the ages God is trying to come up to something it wasn't perfection yet but it was pieces of it it was bits of it it was shadows and types coming on to something real coming on to something closer and Paul brought upon the arena's brother Pat Martin brought a part and it keep coming up there hallelujah and begin to build because now if you are a part of this great plan then God has to have a spot for you God have to have a little void or cap for you to step into if you're supposed to be the bride for this thing so what we gonna show what Martin later what Wesley dinner what Luther there and all the performance comment on to something and then my revelation reveal what we have to play in the scripture Oh hallelujah hallelu see praise God your sins forgiven hallelujah splashed in blood hallelujah but more than that he didn't just want to come to save you but it comes to reteam you redeem you my blood redeem with my power to claim you by holy fire isn't that right remember the blood comes to Peter price the blood please but every time for my power now is when not when the Angel of the covenant that's what he come down to claim what he has already bought and paid for it's not honey when he comes to - it's a manifestation of what you claim to believe of what you claim to see hallelujah of what you claim to walk in he comes and confirms that holiday with signs wonders and miracles holiday Accord is real - Helen it's more than just believing then you see God for yourself and not another hallelujah a many many many amen priests gone amen my the eleven tonight Wow I went so far ahead a man of myself amen praise God but um a man but but about him said in many places and we know he said we can't live in the light of a passage isn't that right we can't live in a light of our past Dean holiday won't do us no good he said we can't get warm by a painted fire man sitting in a painted fire and I came across a picture and on my phone I think I shared it a couple of times amen and it was so sad to see the picture of a man just sitting there a man in front of a painted fire looking on and hoping for some warmth hallelujah is now and sadly that's what some people are doing but he's going in the message or in their own Christian lands looking at a past light but what they need is the present tense light today in the churches in your heart in your soul you've got to have that light in your home that presence or all you got to pull your family towards that light rally around that light Cathar on that light hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah to push back the darkness Amen only a little light of God the gospel nights shines forth in your homes and lives amen that's what we want to know amen glory to God hallelujah Leeman and it's light which is a manifestation of the word for this day even that's what the light is for this thing amen that is the light we need in this hour that we are living in amen let's cross darkness over the earth a man we read it here in Isaiah 60 is now a man cross darkness covers here huh Gloucester has come all over the people it's now right cross darkness everywhere but Lord the Lord the Bible said but the Lord shall arise upon thee Oh hallelujah what a glorious promise to know that that light will upon me who is he speaking to speaking to the individual you the individual you see yourself huh you see your name in the book you yes you hallelujah that light will be risen upon you or your family will see your loved one you'll see it your husband you'll see it your wife will see it your children will see it it'll be a light of God upon you praise God call manifesting himself in flesh a man just like he did way back there is not right amen amen hallelujah praise God so it ain't gross darkness it's not right crosstalk is all over a message but God sent a prophet William Branham Malachi for to reveal to us from the written word the review of Malachi 4:2 give us the light for this day a promise of that light you know and the Word of God says I would oh Lord is a lamp unto my feet I like to my path the Word of God is elapsing amen amen is that right we need that lamp today in a present tense lamp a manifested word for this tea amen it is the only thing that can take us out of here Amen isn't that right it'll take those seven hundred dollars the weakest up back back there to wake us up he will send it he promises hallelujah is not a man so that's what that's what it is that's what the Word of God manifested the seven thunders manifested in us will be the like forty a many man week went where we can live out these virtues a man on the street to our friends to our homes to enables a man where we could live crash when we could reflect that rainbow glory of his presence Oh hallelujah his spirit his love his power his forgiveness well his brotherly kindness his patience his temperance when we could live that out hallelujah then that is a light for day then we are walking in a light of all day then no matter how many topless around hallelujah it's like when God looked to his infrared just see darkness all over yeah there's people multitudes of people people walk in the street people hopping on maxi people get on a bus praise God people in pursuing business and pursuing careers but when God look over no representation millions have lost when you were saved millions were lost when you work or when you were chosen oh honey oh my god looked with infrared who can he see when the son of man comment shall he find faith on the earth oh honey but when you look down he see a little light oh there's a little one just like him glory oh the Holy Ghost oh he began to shout or hike or begin the victorious there's another one over there there's another one over there it's now and we know that it always gets darkest before the dawn is now right and that's the very time that those morning stars go to shining it's not much I will know that the age is coming up philadelphia ladies here coming up it's getting dark all the time and at some point a prophet knew that did it be completely blacked out that there be no more light left but five feet he put a sliver of light in their priest called hallelujah just before the end time because there's a promise in the world that they will come another impedance to this Oh hallelujah that cord will sit in the church ohhara when he shuts the door when they're normal to be safe car drop down the power of God in there then let me
