[4:12] [Music]
[6:34] I mean god bless you Saints we welcome
[6:42] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[6:43] tonight we're gonna start off the
[6:48] meeting the Convention was brother
[6:51] Branham with a short video clip of 10
[6:54] minutes preaching to us so we'd like him
[6:57] to open the convention and and when the
[7:07] video clip ends I'd like us all to stand
[7:10] up and welcome the presence of the Holy
[7:13] Spirit amen
[7:15] so the prophets can switch it on there
[7:27] the church today needs power in truth
[7:30] again
[7:31] Oh God raised up his son that this would
[7:34] be taken care of
[7:35] barri said on the wild in the world will
[7:37] see me no more yet he'll see me where
[7:39] I'll be with you even in you we find out
[7:41] at Hebrews 13 that he's the same
[7:43] yesterday today and forever we find out
[7:45] in my love hot for that he promised us a
[7:48] message in the last days that would
[7:49] restore the faith of the people back to
[7:52] the fathers again he promised it in the
[7:55] last days he also promised to John 14:12
[7:58] he that believeth on me the works that I
[8:00] do shall he do also even more than this
[8:03] or greater than this show he do for I go
[8:05] to my father he's speaking one day they
[8:07] said master show us a sign he said a
[8:09] week an adulterous generation seeks
[8:11] after sign that's the generation we're
[8:13] living in today he said it I'll give him
[8:15] aside Orin Jonas was in the Bennett away
[8:18] or three days tonight soul must the Son
[8:20] of Man be in the heart of the earth
[8:21] three days tonight what kind of a sign
[8:23] would a wicked and adulterous generation
[8:24] find out the resurrection sign that's
[8:29] what we're promised today the
[8:31] resurrection sign that he's still alive
[8:34] yesterday today and forever
[8:38] now after 1900 years with the church
[8:44] ages past all the things that he
[8:46] prophesied Lutheran Wesley's we just
[8:49] went through and seen draw it out he cut
[8:51] down and drawed out the Lord darted on
[8:52] the board here Forrest shorten come down
[8:54] himself and confirm the be right after
[8:57] 99 years and we're at the end I'll delay
[9:00] hacia church age he promised in Luke 17
[9:03] 30 that this same son of man it promised
[9:08] them would be revealed in the days like
[9:12] it wasn't Sodom upon the earth did he do
[9:15] it
[9:16] doesn't have to come to that it's
[9:19] impossible I remember he come in three
[9:22] names the son of man
[9:25] the son of God the spirit the son of
[9:29] David or the leader but in between this
[9:31] conjunction at 42 years old words in the
[9:33] day when the Son of man shall be removed
[9:36] repeat himself as well a son of God's
[9:40] name will reveal yourself in a different
[9:43] way now what does that make Malachi 4
[9:46] exactly right
[9:47] they the son of man will reveal himself
[9:49] not in a whole big denominations and
[9:53] things that we've had to the agent but
[9:55] he would manifest himself as son of man
[9:58] again to make manifest Malachi or did
[10:03] that day I was said to you he's the
[10:05] height of the prophecy and he shall turn
[10:07] the hearts of the children back to the
[10:10] faith of the Apostolic fathers away from
[10:12] all this denomination ISM and come back
[10:14] to the original word again throughout
[10:16] that last day pride tree that he posed
[10:19] in the evening time it shall be light up
[10:21] to the misty day it shall be like you'll
[10:24] be a day can be called a date or not see
[10:26] it's picking up the body but the same
[10:29] hand that were sure these d'azur the
[10:32] west again there shall be light in the
[10:35] evening time oh my I feel like singing a
[10:39] song
[10:43] [Music]
[10:54] big story of the night a prisoner to the
[10:57] word will of God because you can move it
[11:00] so God move what your eyes like that
[11:13] Oh Lord your God and your God for every
[11:18] moly
[11:19] and we are so happy to know that you
[11:23] promised that you would have a remnant
[11:24] when you come to the earth regardless of
[11:26] what goals are comes there's going to be
[11:29] people that's going to be ready we know
[11:32] that there is a paddy that man gives to
[11:35] god there's a tithing amongst of people
[11:38] perhaps maybe we'd say 1/10 of all the
[11:41] world's harvest through the ages would
[11:43] be that elected it's Vince Collins law I
[11:47] believe and as a father with an
[11:50] epileptic son years the goals that help
[11:53] thou my unbelief we hear this question
[11:58] asked one day when he returns what he
[12:02] find faith he never questioned whether
[12:06] we find righteousness or whether we find
[12:08] Christians but would he find faith
[12:10] twenty return knowing that it be one
[12:13] thing people let's go on hearing also
[12:18] the Holy Spirit speaking in the last
[12:20] days at how these times would
[12:23] man would have a form of godliness but
[12:26] would deny the power lack of faith we
[12:31] thank the Lord tonight because it in our
[12:34] hearts we feel that we have just a
[12:38] little faith and help us Lord that that
[12:40] faith may be increased tonight until it
[12:43] be so high so lost and complete serenity

[14:23] this hamper the cart gaming instead on
[14:25] played card to them by weight is a most
[14:27] sociable little feller you've ever seen
[14:29] so all we loving we wouldn't get rid of
[14:32] him for nothing
[14:32] I stood there a little bit on so well so
[14:36] don't you think it ever church needs a
[14:38] man like that I couldn't answer then he
[14:44] said in another one place that they had
[14:45] such a lovely place this minister and
[14:47] his wife lovely people went out and deal
[14:50] with the children so much tell he had a
[14:52] Bible School instead they just had so

[15:27] Holy Roller something like that I
[15:29] thought about that his boys come to me
[15:31] said bad Mans all right if they're doing
[15:33] this but I never called you to do that
[15:35] I've told you to take the swords and
[15:37] you're like Josh away and John
[15:41] not to the realm of civil society here
[15:43] subs church organization but challenge
[15:45] the devil painting the forefront
[15:49] make room preach the word and find out
[15:53] who's got the painting I have noticed
[15:59] recently it has been and the meetings
[16:03] where I've been holding all around
[16:05] nationwide and into Cuba and down into
[16:09] the islands every time an interpretation
[16:12] comes it's always if thou will believe
[16:15] my emergency believe it all that was a
[16:19] question Jesus asked will I find fate
[16:22] when our return did stable online
[16:26] churches will I find religion but will I
[16:29] find things not even needed questions
[16:33] theory but he questioned failed because
[16:36] design in the scripture in Malachi for
[16:38] that there is to be an anointing come
[16:40] down and to restore again that original
[16:45] faith and to bring the faith of the
[16:48] people back to the original thinking
[16:50] awesome
[16:51] cause above more than five or you might
[16:54] see that truth
[16:55] I've seen enough
[16:58] [Music]
[17:00] then restored back again that
[17:04] fathers will see the revelation of God
[17:07] in Christ he knew that these great
[17:16] trying times had come to prove all
[17:19] nations and approve all peoples so
[17:23] therefore he knew that the great
[17:25] question later not whether he would rise
[17:28] again by whether even be crucified
[17:32] according to the scriptures but not
[17:36] whether he would have sinned on high and
[17:38] the Holy Spirit would jump but the
[17:41] question was would that be any faith
[17:45] left on earth at his coming and where
[17:49] his faith comes by hearing the Word of
[17:51] God that was his question will there be
[17:58] faith on earth when I come will he find

[1:16:17] being gone for 50 something years but we
[1:16:20] are still pressing on hallelujah I don't
[1:16:25] care what the critics say the prophets
[1:16:28] message is correct
[1:16:30] [Applause]
[1:16:32] it is the sister Lord it is here and a
[1:16:37] man this message is our life I don't
[1:16:44] care what they say about the Prophet I
[1:16:46] don't care what they say about the cloud
[1:16:49] it is not sinful Lord but the prophecy
[1:16:53] to make believer has to be here they are
[1:16:57] fulfilling Malachi 4 we are Eagles
[1:17:01] we are not sparrows the sparrow will go
[1:17:06] to the light and beat the light and beat
[1:17:09] the light and beat the light until they
[1:17:12] beat their brains out and their light
[1:17:14] dead on the ground
[1:17:16] we are not sparrows we are Eagles
[1:17:20] Alleluia amen thank God for this message
[1:17:23] I give God glory and praise to be
[1:17:28] identified with it for some several
[1:17:30] years amen god is great I want to bring
[1:17:34] a message today I'm taking brother
[1:17:37] branham's tight off it's called
[1:17:40] time-tested faith time-tested faith from
[1:17:47] his message in 1958 I believe just after
[1:17:51] he preached time-tested memorials and I
[1:17:54] praise God for brother Branham and I
[1:17:56] would like us to stand to our feet just
[1:17:59] to take a few scriptures and tonight we
[1:18:02] go as the Lord would lead us and I
[1:18:04] shan't keep you long at all I would like
[1:18:07] to I think Habakkuk 2:3 belongs in this
[1:18:11] convention with that beautiful
[1:18:14] inspiration brother Thompson a man shall
[1:18:17] he find faith I believe this belongs
[1:18:20] here and I will read this and a few
[1:18:22] other scriptures just to get us in line
[1:18:24] for the message tonight Habakkuk 2:3 for
[1:18:28] the vision is not yet for an appointed
[1:18:33] time but at the end it shall speak
[1:18:38] and not lie though it Terry wait for it
[1:18:44] because it will surely come it will not
[1:18:49] tarry praise be to God I would like to
[1:18:53] add into that Isaiah 55 and first eleven
[1:18:59] so shall my word be that goeth forth out
[1:19:03] of my mouth it shall not return void
[1:19:07] unto me but it shall accomplish that
[1:19:11] which I please and it shall prosper in
[1:19:15] the thing we're on to I sent it a man
[1:19:20] finally I believe the scripture belongs
[1:19:23] in the message tonight 1 Corinthians 13
[1:19:26] and verse 8 charity never faileth
[1:19:33] hallelujah whether there be prophecies
[1:19:37] they shall fail whether there be tongues
[1:19:40] they shall cease whether there be
[1:19:44] knowledge it shall vanish away a man
[1:19:48] praise God Lord Jesus these few words
[1:19:51] tonight Lord only you can take the lid
[1:19:55] off the word we pray that you would do
[1:19:58] so Lord and get glory to yourself Lord
[1:20:03] as it was on the road to mas when Jesus
[1:20:07] spoke to them and their hearts were
[1:20:09] burning and burning may that come to
[1:20:13] pass throughout this convention that we
[1:20:15] may know it was Jesus talking to us
[1:20:18] along the way bless every heart and my
[1:20:22] objective is to be a simple
[1:20:24] encouragement to the bride that at the
[1:20:27] end we may say I feel encouraged to
[1:20:29] Presta battle granted Lord we give you
[1:20:32] honor and praise in Jesus Christ
[1:20:34] wonderful name amen amen you can be
[1:20:37] seated
[1:20:43] of course Luke is a very central
[1:20:46] Scripture today and for the rest of the
[1:20:49] convention and he goes on to say
[1:20:52] nevertheless when the Son of Man comes
[1:20:55] shall he find faith on the earth and the
[1:20:58] amplified calls that persistence in
[1:21:01] faith amen or perseverance in faith
[1:21:05] praise be to God and so I believe that
[1:21:08] he's looking for faith I believe mama
[1:21:10] Eagle is flying over looking for faith
[1:21:13] hallelujah and he's finding faith amen
[1:21:17] the chickens are not responding but the
[1:21:19] Eagles are responding yes yes amen what
[1:21:24] you're doing I can do that as well
[1:21:26] praise be to God so we give God the
[1:21:29] glory and we give him the honor for all
[1:21:32] that he's done in our life
[1:21:35] yes it's been a long time since brother
[1:21:39] Branham was here 53 something years but
[1:21:43] we give God thanks that we are still
[1:21:45] pressing on the battle we are still
[1:21:48] fighting the good fight of faith nothing
[1:21:50] is going to stop us god bless brother
[1:21:53] thompson for this inspiration it is so
[1:21:56] powerful I thought of putting slides but
[1:21:58] it was just changing and exploding and I
[1:22:01] couldn't really structure it into a
[1:22:04] presentation but I believe it would help
[1:22:06] somebody along their way today that is
[1:22:09] my prayer
[1:22:10] what a blessing brother Thompson has
[1:22:12] been around the world in London who he
[1:22:15] once preached a message called
[1:22:16] be careful Satan and we never forgot
[1:22:19] that inspiration my and we are still
[1:22:22] saying be careful Satan can be your shot
[1:22:25] be careful Satan
[1:22:28] [Music]
[1:22:30] hallelujah time-tested faith now you
[1:22:37] know I realize that this the whole
[1:22:39] inspiration is about the second coming
[1:22:41] of Christ I'm just going to show you
[1:22:43] some interesting parallels with the
[1:22:50] first coming of Christ
[1:22:52] you know since Malachi - Matthew was 400
[1:22:59] years they call it the thank you they
[1:23:03] call it the 400 silent years how many's
[1:23:08] heard of the 400 silent years yeah there
[1:23:14] was no prophet which was just real quiet
[1:23:17] they had a long time to forget the
[1:23:21] prophets to forget the prophecies to be
[1:23:25] under no expectation at all for anything
[1:23:30] we think 53 is long what about 400 400
[1:23:38] silent years now making a parallel with
[1:23:44] his first coming when Jesus came
[1:23:47] what would he find what would he find
[1:23:51] let me tell you God doesn't fail when he
[1:23:55] says something it has to come to pass
[1:23:59] after all that time when he came to the
[1:24:02] Virgin Mary and he told her what the
[1:24:05] agenda was and he took that old prophecy
[1:24:08] and he brought it to life Mary did not
[1:24:13] say what she said according to thy word
[1:24:16] be it unto me and that's what we are
[1:24:20] saying tonight according to my word Lord
[1:24:22] be it unto me
[1:24:24] hallelujah she was completely faith
[1:24:28] it was Mary's belief and there was no
[1:24:32] belief like Mary's belief Christ was
[1:24:36] born few people realized it Mary bought
[1:24:40] the baby into the temple everybody
[1:24:43] forgot
[1:24:44] we'll just baby baby baby baby but there
[1:24:48] was one old man oh when I come well I
[1:24:54] find faith God had revealed to him that
[1:24:58] he would not die but he would see the
[1:25:02] Lord he took that baby in his arms and
[1:25:06] he said O God let me return I can die
[1:25:10] now I have seen my salvation
[1:25:14] hallelujah glory will I find faith is
[1:25:18] that faith it was revealed to him faith
[1:25:22] is a revelation and if that wasn't
[1:25:25] enough there was an old blind lady
[1:25:27] called Anna who came walking up and she
[1:25:31] said Redemption has come to Jerusalem
[1:25:34] hallelujah glory to God thank you Jesus
[1:25:38] you can't get away from it amen after
[1:25:42] 400 years John the Baptist stood there
[1:25:45] and he said behold the lamb of God was
[1:25:49] coming to take the sins of the world
[1:25:52] away behold the lamb of God I am not
[1:25:56] worthy to loosen your shoes I am not
[1:25:58] worthy to baptize you John was in the
[1:26:01] faith and if that was not enough way
[1:26:04] over in the east
[1:26:06] there was a wise man hallelujah
[1:26:10] wise men today we would call them wise
[1:26:14] virgins hallelujah wise men brother when
[1:26:19] they came to Jerusalem they never said
[1:26:22] you know what's going on they said
[1:26:24] listen we have seen his star we have
[1:26:28] seen his star
[1:26:29] and we have come all this way to worship
[1:26:33] Him
[1:26:33] where is he King of the Jews oh you talk
[1:26:37] about a shaking or what a shaking they
[1:26:40] came they oh my god
[1:26:42] judge what a day we're living in now we
[1:26:45] have come all this way to worship the
[1:26:47] Lord I've come from London to
[1:26:50] Johannesburg to worship the Lord who
[1:26:53] feels the same way we have come from a
[1:26:55] long way we come so far so far so far to
[1:27:00] praise the Lord hallelujah I feel so
[1:27:03] good today when he comes will he find
[1:27:05] faith yes hallelujah glory let me read
[1:27:11] some quotes to you hallelujah Simeon was
[1:27:15] a righteous man Anna was a prophetess
[1:27:18] John the Baptist amen
[1:27:21] these people were looking for the coming
[1:27:23] of the Lord amen I want to pick up with
[1:27:26] what brother Thompson said he said this
[1:27:29] is where the shaking comes this is the
[1:27:33] shaking because people think it's
[1:27:36] nothing it's not nothing this is real
[1:27:43] you'll find this beautifully preached in
[1:27:45] Revelation chapter 4 part 1 it says here
[1:27:49] is where the shaking comes he said the
[1:27:53] Holy Spirit comes to those who God has
[1:27:56] called he said there's a great shaking
[1:28:00] amongst the elect great powerful thing
[1:28:05] is going on in Johannesburg here and the
[1:28:09] world knows nothing about it
[1:28:12] but we are shouting we are singing we
[1:28:15] are glorifying God is shaking we are the
[1:28:20] power that's shaking the hour I feel so
[1:28:25] happy that I know that Jesus is here
[1:28:29] Messiah is on the earth
[1:28:32] now hallelujah glory to God hey man it
[1:28:39] was great but they didn't know it and so
[1:28:44] is the gospel today great the gospel is
[1:28:48] shaking like it never shook before it's
[1:28:53] a shaking in the remnant but God is
[1:28:56] fixing them ready God is fixing me he's
[1:29:01] fixing you he's fixing us to be ready
[1:29:04] because the rapture is the reality we
[1:29:07] must have rapturing faith but the
[1:29:09] Prophet said it'll be there it'll be
[1:29:12] there don't worry it'll be there don't
[1:29:14] have to be anxious don't lose sleep
[1:29:16] it'll be there it is that saith the Lord
[1:29:19] hallelujah praise be to God long time
[1:29:24] today I'm just going to give you some
[1:29:27] examples okay of people that were ready
[1:29:30] Amen to give you inspiration it's been a
[1:29:33] long time but there's something moving
[1:29:36] on you anyway
[1:29:38] yeah something in spite of the time gone
[1:29:42] by it doesn't matter it hasn't even
[1:29:44] changed you hallelujah amen in the days
[1:29:49] of brother Branham you shouted amen
[1:29:51] in these days you're still shot
[1:29:55] hallelujah if there's one man who could
[1:29:59] have had a big complaint it was Caleb he
[1:30:05] could have had a big long complaint but
[1:30:09] let me talk about Caleb Caleb a long
[1:30:12] time went by he said listen
[1:30:15] Joshua 14 40 years old was I when Moses
[1:30:21] the servant of the Lord sent me from
[1:30:24] Kadesh Barnea to spy out the land
[1:30:28] I brought him word again it was in my
[1:30:32] heart
[1:30:33] nevertheless my brethren that went up
[1:30:37] with me may the heart of the people melt
[1:30:41] don't worry about these brethren I don't
[1:30:45] care about believe the sign and all this
[1:30:47] stuff I believe God's Word is true God's
[1:30:52] prophet is vindicated from the beginning
[1:30:55] to the end hallelujah glory to God bye
[1:31:00] brethren made my heart melt
[1:31:03] are you ready he says thou knowest the
[1:31:08] thing that the Lord said unto Moses the
[1:31:12] man of God concerning me and V in Kadesh
[1:31:16] Barnea caleb was not playing games he
[1:31:21] was not playing Church Caleb didn't wait
[1:31:23] for somebody else to say hallelujah and
[1:31:25] then he said hallelujah Caleb was
[1:31:29] praising God because he knew what Moses
[1:31:32] told him from the start
[1:31:34] amen amen hallelujah are you ready for a
[1:31:38] powerful quote here it comes let us
[1:31:42] stand like Joshua and Caleb
[1:31:46] this is going to have a spiritual
[1:31:48] background let us stand like Joshua and
[1:31:51] Caleb as we see the Promised Land coming
[1:31:55] in sight its nearing the time to be
[1:31:59] given it's been a long time that it's
[1:32:02] nearing the time
[1:32:03] Joshua means Savior Caleb means true
[1:32:08] believer who stayed with Joshua Joshua
[1:32:13] Holy Ghost Caleb stayed with the Holy
[1:32:17] Ghost I'm glad today I know I must stay
[1:32:21] where the Holy Ghost is being manifested
[1:32:24] this is not fanaticism hallelujah this
[1:32:29] is not fanaticism we know this is not
[1:32:34] fanaticism hallelujah
[1:32:37] this is revival this is the Holy Ghost
[1:32:40] this is Jesus Caleb stayed with Joshua
[1:32:46] Caleb stayed with Joshua I'm gonna stay
[1:32:50] with revival hallelujah I don't care
[1:32:54] what the ten spies do
[1:32:55] I'm won't revival I want my promises
[1:32:58] shout Amen somebody glory
[1:33:03] my mama it's a big question it's a big
[1:33:08] question who you know will he find faith
[1:33:10] after all those years
[1:33:12] Caleb kept the faith the ten spies say
[1:33:16] they began to doubt it was a big thing
[1:33:18] and then even in the days of Caleb you
[1:33:21] know something a lot of people never
[1:33:23] possess then they never in do a place of
[1:33:27] trying
[1:33:28] they never overcame but Caleb he said
[1:33:32] another spirit was with him Caleb
[1:33:36] overcame and when the time come let me
[1:33:39] tell you here what Caleb said he was a
[1:33:41] man he said these 45 years since the
[1:33:45] Lord has spoken to Moses he says Lord
[1:33:48] now I am forced go and 85 years old
[1:33:53] that means he's 85 he's 20 years older
[1:33:56] than me he's 85 do you think he says
[1:34:00] well I better cool down now no Caleb was
[1:34:04] just a strong hallelujah

[1:34:10] strong as he was back there

[1:34:22] and so are you so are you glory to God
[1:34:28] amen amen
[1:34:31] he says since I am now 85 I am strong as
[1:34:36] I was in the day that Moses sent me as
[1:34:39] my strength was then even so my strength
[1:34:43] is now for war both to go out and to

[1:40:26] there by God he placed all those
[1:40:29] materials together and he knew he could
[1:40:33] not build on gravel that's what
[1:40:37] Pentecostals can understand and it was
[1:40:40] some big blows to blow out all the
