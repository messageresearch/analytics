Let's lift our hands and just worship him right now in this place this morning. Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Lord Father. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I'm not afraid. I'm not afraid. Healing rain is falling down. Healing rain is falling down. I'm not afraid. I'm not afraid. Oh, healing rain is falling down. Healing rain is falling down. I'm not afraid. Oh Lord, I'm not afraid. Oh, your healing rain is falling me. Your healing rain is falling down. I'm not afraid. I'm not afraid. One more time. Oh, healing rain is falling. Your healing rain is falling now. I'm not afraid. I'm not afraid. Oh, give him praise this morning. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Let his rain fall upon you this morning and flood our thirsty souls this morning. Oh, hallelujah. Healing rain. Heal us this morning, Lord Jesus. Oh, with an outpouring of your presence and of your spirit this morning. Are you happy to be in God's house today? We happy to be alive, to be found alive in his grace. Amen. He had preserved our soul. Amen. We are grateful this morning to be in the land of the living. God bless you and welcome to the house of the Lord. And if you have your Bibles, let's just turn to Psalms 121. Psalms 121 for a scripture reading. um before we pray and ask God's blessing upon us this morning for the service. Psalms 121 says, "I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills from whence cometh my help. My help cometh from the Lord which made heaven and earth. He will not suffer thy foot to be moved. He that keepeth thee will not slumber. Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep. For the Lord is thy keeper, and the Lord is thy shade upon thy right hand. The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night. The Lord shall preserve thee from all evil. He shall preserve thy soul. The Lord shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth and even forever more. May God add blessing to the ring of his word this morning. We say amen to it this morning. The Lord is thy keeper and he is thy shade. Is he your keeper this morning? Do you know you didn't keep yourself this morning? Do you know you didn't bring yourself to church this morning, but you are answering the call of the supernatural upon your soul? Let everything that had breath answer God this morning with a amen and with a hallelujah. For every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess that he is Lord this morning. So we might as well give him all the glory and we might as well give him all the praise. Oh hallelujah. Because he is coming back for his earth. He is coming back for his people this morning. Let us give him praise and lift our hands in the sanctuary and give him glory and thank him and praise him as we pray and ask God's blessings this morning. Almighty God, we are happy to be in your house this morning. Lord, what can we say today, Lord Jesus? Lord, truly it is your grace and mercy that has brought us through. Lord, when we look back on the long road, Father, and all the things that we've been through, Lord, and all the things that we've seen, Lord, we know that we didn't call ourselves, Lord. It is you that have called us, Lord, Father, to glory and to virtue, Lord. But we thank you for the call of God upon our lives, Father. We come into this house today to praise you, to glorify you, to give you all the praise and all the thanks that is due unto your name, Lord Jesus. Lord, for every mountain you brought us over, and for every valley you brought us through, Lord Jesus, you deserve a shout, a praise from our lips, Lord, a sacrifice of worship in the house of God because you did it all for us this morning. We couldn't do it ourselves, oh God. In every situation, you have proven yourself strong. May you prove yourself strong again this morning, Lord. And may you anoint your people for service, Lord. Anoint our worship. Bless us as we come into this place, Lord. Bless those that might still be on their way even. We pray you bless them as they come in. Father, and may you anoint them and inspire them as they come to worship, to bow before the feet of him that created us and to give you all the glory for what you're about to do in this season, Lord. Your great mighty release of dynamics upon the bride in the last day. Father, may you anoint your servant today, Father, as he steps into the pulpit to minister the word of God. Lord, may he be met with angelic presence, oh God. Father, may the pillar of fire swoop over us this morning in a mighty and supernatural way. Father, may you engulf this place with fire this morning. Engulfed with anointing, Father, may people be healed while the world is going forth. May people be anointed. May chains break off of them. May demons be break broken off of the people, Father, and run and out of the house of God. And may the people be free this morning to praise and worship you, Lord. And may a great thing to take place today, Lord, of turn in our lives. Granted, almighty God, we commit this service into your hands. We commit this day into your hands for your glory in Jesus name.

But you know I'm going to stay on my field. I'm going to stay on the battlefield. I want to stay on my feet. I'm going to stay on till he come. I'm going to stay on the battlefield. I'm going to stay on the battlefield. I'm going to stay on the battlefield till he come. One more time. I'm going to stay. I'm going to stay on field. I'm going to steal. I can feel I'm going to feel it. I'm going to stay. Hallelujah. I'm going to stay on the battlefield. One more time. I'm going to stay on the battlefield. I'm going to stay on the battlefield. I'm going to stay on the battlefield till he comes. I'm going to stay on the battlefield. Oh, I'm going to stay on the battlefield. I'm going to stay on the battlefield. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Let's pray. Father, we thank you for your presence and we put it in our hearts to stay on the battlefield in this life's journey where it's battle every day. We fight to live. We fight to die. We fight to yield, surrender ourselves to you where we love you, Lord. You said your yoke is easy and your burden is light. We thank you for the burden of the word that you place upon us that we could surrender our lives to you. Father, speak to us. take me out of the way and may you be magnified and glorified in our midst in Jesus name I ask it. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Before I ever cease if you have your Bibles let's 2 Kings chapter 4 and Matthew chapter 14. Two portion of scriptures today. 2 Kings chapter 4 reading from verse one of 2 Kings chapter 4. Now they cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets unto Elisha, saying, Thy servant, my husband is dead, and thou knowest that thy servant did fear the Lord, and the creditor is come to take unto him my two sons to be bondsmen. And Elisha said unto her, "What shall I do for thee? Tell me, what has thou in thy house?" She said, "Thy handmade had not anything in the house, save a pot of oil." Then he said, "Go borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy neighbors, even empty vessels. Borrow not a few." And when thou had come in, thou shalt shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons, and thou shalt pour out into all those vessels, and thou shalt set aside that which is full. So she went from him, and shut the door upon her, and upon her sons, who brought the vessels to her, and she poured out. And it came to pass when the vessels were full that she said unto her, "Son, bring me yet a vessel." And he said unto her, "There is not a vessel more." And the oil stayed. Then she came and told the man of God, he said, "Go sell the oil and pay thy debt, and live thou and thy children of the rest." &gt;&gt; I read from Matthew chapter 14. I want to read from verse 23 speaking about Jesus. And when he had sent the multitudes away, this is Matthew 14:23, he went up into a mountain apart to pray. And when the evening was come, he was there alone. But the ship was now in the midst of the sea, tossed with waves, for the wind was contrary. &gt;&gt; And in the fourth watch of the night, Jesus went unto them walking on the sea. When the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, "It is a spirit." And they cried out for fear. But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, "Be of good cheer. It is I. Be not afraid." And Peter answered him and said, "Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water." And he said, "Come." And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the water to go to Jesus. But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid. And beginning to sink, he cried, saying, "Lord, save me." And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand and caught him and said unto him, "Oh thou of little faith, wherefore this thou doubt?" Let's pray. Father, we thank you for your word tonight. May this edify, strengthen, and bless and deliver and fill your people with your presence by your word. May I confirm your word tonight today with signs, wonders, and miracles. I ask in Jesus name. Amen. You may be seated. Praise God. Amen. Praise God. As you sit down, give God some praises. &gt;&gt; Oh, he is worthy. of all your praise. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise will make such a whole difference &gt;&gt; in this hour. Praise God. I miss your trial. I praise him. I miss your testings. Praise him. I missed conditions. You praise him. There's no reason not to praise him. Confuse the devil by praising God. Praise God. Confuse the enemy by praising God. Devil want you to depress and dong out. But God want you lifted up. He said, "If I be lifted up from the earth, I'll draw all men unto me." He wants you to be full of praises. When the lamb took the book, there was not worthy. He said, "Worthy is the lamb that was slain to take the book and to loose the seven seas." God bless you. Welcome this morning. Welcome to the house of praise. The Bible said in the tabernacle of the righteous, they are rejoicing. Praise God. Where is God, there is noise. Wherever he's around you, you have to hear some kind of activity. We don't serve a dead God. We serve a living God. &gt;&gt; I have a title this morning. If you can only get started, &gt;&gt; God will do the rest. &gt;&gt; Praise God. If you could only get started, &gt;&gt; God will do the rest. &gt;&gt; I have an inspiration. A supernatural intervention after getting into action. Oh, praise the name of the Lord. That's my type, my inspiration. A supernatural intervention after getting into action. All right, let's go. God always has a way. &gt;&gt; There's two ways. Our ways or his ways. God has a way for today and he's always made a way for everything. God at the beginning know the end and he laid out the scripture for each age. &gt;&gt; So praise God. So God has a way. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; And when God sends someone on the scene, a prophet, God never changes his system. &gt;&gt; He never changes his ways. He always does it the same way. He has to. He must do it. God interprets his own word. We don't have to interpret it. He interpret it by vindicating it or confirming it. &gt;&gt; Listen to this. So God has made a way for us. &gt;&gt; God loves his children. &gt;&gt; He loves his people. &gt;&gt; He wants to help them. He wants to help you more than you want help. &gt;&gt; If you can just get in that in your heart that God is more willing to help you than you are to help yourself. But he has a way. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises. And that's the only way he will work is through his way. &gt;&gt; So even though he loves you, he want to help you. He can't help you outside the laws of his ways. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises. He loves you. You believe that? &gt;&gt; Just like you love your children, God love you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But he have a way of doing things. He have a way of open up the windows of heaven. He have a way of releasing his blessings. He have a way of do making his deliverance. That is his way. And there's only two ways, our ways and his way. But he said, "My thoughts are not your thoughts. And my ways are not your ways. I as the heaven is above." Praise God. So are my ways above your ways. Oh, give the Lord some praises. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's go. You must come to his terms, &gt;&gt; not your terms, &gt;&gt; his terms. You want it a certain way, but he gives it to you his way. like Neon dipping in the waters of Jordan. He said the waters up in the country was much cleaner and better. Neon had leprosy, private leprosy. Only the people around Neon know he have leprosy. He have his army clone around him. He's respected and respectable. But in the night time is a problem. &gt;&gt; When he take out his armor and he see all this leprosy condition upon him. &gt;&gt; His servant told him to send for that prophet. The prophet tell him go and dip seven times in the Jordan River. But that man want to pray dip in a swimming pool. He want to bathe in an island pool. He want to bathe by by clear waters. Hallelujah. Similar to begging. If the man say Jordan River is Jordan River. It might look dirty but it's Jordan River. That is God's provision. That is God's way. And when he dipped seven times, he was made whole. Do you want to be whole today? Oh, glory to God. You got to come God's way, not your way. You have to come by God thoughts, not your thoughts. Oh, give the Lord some praises. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So when Neon obeyed God, &gt;&gt; he was healed. &gt;&gt; His leprosy left. &gt;&gt; And if we obey God's provided way, &gt;&gt; leprosy would leave. &gt;&gt; Sickness will leave. &gt;&gt; Everything will leave. But we have got to come his way for this day. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, we see that God doesn't change his systems of doing things. He always does it the same. We are constantly changing because we are finite. &gt;&gt; We make all kind of mistakes. We can improve and get better. But God is infinite. But God is infinite. His first at the time. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises. &gt;&gt; God cannot get smarter. &gt;&gt; He's the source of all wisdom. &gt;&gt; He is all power. He is omnipotent, omniprescient, omniscient, and infinite. Therefore, when he says anything, you could hang your soul on it &gt;&gt; because it is true. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, you are not to focus on yourself. Don't let the camera focus on you. You know, right now in the age of selfie, everybody clicking. &gt;&gt; We have too much of that. &gt;&gt; You're looking at you. You're looking at yourself. You're looking at your family. But we have to focus on Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Because this gospel is not about it's about him. &gt;&gt; He is the team of this gospel. He's the team of the Bible. And that is what we must see because we are all at the same level. Born in sin, shaping inquity, coming in the world speaking lies. All of us need a redeemer, a savior, a deliverer, a healer, a baptizer. We all needy. But he stands as king of kings &gt;&gt; and lord of lords today. Oh, praise the Lord. Hallelujah. So watch this. He said, "The works that I do shall do also." Then if you get your camera in focus to a place to where God can see you, where God can use you, you got to see that God knows that you are a sinner, that you have confessed your sins and God put your iniquity upon him and upon himself and become a man. He crossed his strain. He come down from being God to be a man that he might die in yourstead. Do you understand that? the cost of that &gt;&gt; he left his glory take on a ro of flesh &gt;&gt; to come to pay for a price that we had go was responsible for &gt;&gt; and he couldn't die as a spirit he couldn't die as god he had to die as a man so he come to pay the price and say you you had to take your hands off now I died for them I paid for them they are going to be delivered they are going to be free they are mine you are purchased by the blood of Jesus not you're righteous you stop sminking you stop drinking stop smoking you are purchased by the blood of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the power of God is what made blood that he might take away your sinful blood by sexual desire and make you a free man and woman. There you are. &gt;&gt; So you have to focus away from yourself and focus on Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then you're going to hear all your sins are forgiven. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. Like the woman caught in the act of adultery, she didn't ask for pardon. She didn't ask for forgiveness. But Jesus said, "Where are thine accusers?" Then he said, "Go and sin no more." &gt;&gt; Praise God. Praise God. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; I want to read a scripture from St. John chapter 5. I'll read it quickly from verse one. And after this, there was a feast of the Jews. Jesus went to Jerusalem. And there was a place in a market pool called Betiza. And in there lay great multitude of important folk, blind, hauled, withered, waiting for the movement of the water. For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and trouble the water. &gt;&gt; Wasn't the water now and trouble the water, &gt;&gt; wasn't? &gt;&gt; So everybody knew at this season the angel will come and trouble the water. &gt;&gt; And whosoever first after troubling in the water stepped in was made whole. &gt;&gt; Whatever disease they had and a certain man, I like that. I put no name on that man. &gt;&gt; That man could be you. That man could be me. But a certain man was there which had an infirmity 30 and 8 years and Jesus saw him lie and knew how long time in that case &gt;&gt; the case that you have how long you in it. &gt;&gt; He said unto him thou be made whole? Question. &gt;&gt; The important man answered sir I have no man when the water is troubled to put me into the pool while I am coming another step down before me. And Jesus said unto him, "Rise, take up thy bed, and walk." &gt;&gt; And immediately the man was made whole. &gt;&gt; Now, before Jesus came on the scene, this supernatural occurrence in the pool by the angel stirring the water made a provision for healing for the people &gt;&gt; until Jesus came. &gt;&gt; God always have a supernatural element &gt;&gt; to make provisions for his people. healing, &gt;&gt; restoration, forgiveness and deliverance. &gt;&gt; There is always the supernatural. &gt;&gt; And even at that time before Jesus spoke to that man, there was something supernatural happening. &gt;&gt; That man had persistence. That man had courage. That man come for 38 years. And every time he come, somebody coming in front of him. &gt;&gt; Nobody helping him. He said, "I have no man coming because I know supernatural going to move &gt;&gt; and I'm holding on for the supernatural. I am waiting for the supernatural because God is supernatural. God is not just talk. God is supernatural. He has work in a supernatural way. Oh, give the Lord some praises. Do you get what I'm saying now? God is supernatural. Oh, give the Lord some praises. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When Jesus was walking underwater &gt;&gt; and his disciples saw him and they got afraid and say the spirit, &gt;&gt; he said fear not. Amen. &gt;&gt; Be not afraid. &gt;&gt; So they accept that the master walking there. Peter went a little further. He throwing another gate. He said, "Lord, if that is you talking there, bid me to come. Let me walk too." A man who is a smoker, a drinker, or whatever it is, a man without the Holy Ghost. He said, "Bid me to come. If you speak me to come, I could walk just like you walk." Oh, give the Lord a shout. Do you have the courage this morning to believe you could walk just like he walked? And Jesus said, "Come." And you know what Peter did? He got into action. He stepped out the boat. That's the problem with a lot of us. We're not willing to step out the boat. We could talk about how Peter sink, but Peter step out the boat and he walked on the water just like Jesus did. Oh, give the Lord some praises. You could overcome just like Jesus did. You could get power just like Jesus did. You could get the victory just like Jesus did. You could walk like he walked. You could talk like he talked. Oh, glory to God. The same works I do shall you do also. That's what Jesus said. &gt;&gt; Ordinary man, &gt;&gt; normal man, &gt;&gt; working man stepped out of the boat, &gt;&gt; got into action and he walked on the water. &gt;&gt; That means we could break dimensions. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We could confence. &gt;&gt; How you explaining that? A man walking on the water. That is not deic. You know, he was literally walking on the water, you know, because we could conquer elements. Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; This man, this important man. Jesus said, "Rise up, take a bed and walk." And immediately man is made whole. &gt;&gt; Took up his bed and walked. &gt;&gt; And the same day was the Sabbath. &gt;&gt; Watch this. Watch how religious spirits behave and act. This man who was sick was healed completely. &gt;&gt; They know he come in there a long time. The man walking out with his bed. I like that. You know, pick up your bed. Don't leave your bed there and walk away and leave somebody else to pick it up for you. Pick up your bed and walk. &gt;&gt; The man pick up his bed, it was walking. &gt;&gt; The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, it is the Sabbath day. &gt;&gt; It is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed. He answered and said unto them, he that made me whole. &gt;&gt; The same said unto me, take up thy bed &gt;&gt; and walk. &gt;&gt; They asked him, "What man is that which said unto thee, take up thy bed and walk?" So they don't know who it is. &gt;&gt; They don't know when it happened. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. And he that was healed was not who it was. He didn't know who it was. For Jesus had conveyed himself away a multitude been in that place. Afterwards Jesus findeth him in the temple &gt;&gt; said unto him, "Behold, thou art made whole." &gt;&gt; Sin no more, &gt;&gt; least a worse thing &gt;&gt; come unto thee. &gt;&gt; Maybe this morning somebody will be made whole. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the name of the Lord. And the man departed told the Jews it was Jesus. So now he knew who it was. &gt;&gt; So he could identify who it was. He said it's Jesus which had made him whole. Therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus and sought to slay him because he had done this on the Sabbath day. Imagine that. Then study the man the man delivered the man get a breakthrough. But because he didn't the Sabbath day they wanted to kill Jesus. And Jesus said my father worked his and I work. Therefore the Jews more sought the more to kill him because he not only had broken the Sabbath he also said that God was his father making them equal with God. So once you say God is your father that's a problem because that's mean you are son and a father and a son reflects the father. &gt;&gt; Oh glory to God is a dangerous thing to claim that God is your father because when you claim God is your father you are claiming to be a son of God. Oh give the Lord a shout. And a son of God walks like God, talks like God, lives like God, acts like God, do what God does because you are son of the father. Oh, give the Lord a shout. This is completely different from a church member. A church member goes to church and go back home. Oh, glory to God. A church member just have church in mind, but a son of God, which you are, a daughter of God, which you are. Oh, you are offspring of the almighty. Oh, glory to God. You are benefited from his loins. Oh give the Lord a shout in the house. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then Jesus said unto him, verily I say unto you, the son can do nothing himself, but what he see the father do, &gt;&gt; so do for the things whatsoever he doeth there he the son does likewise. For here he is, for the father loveth the son and showeth him all things that himself do it and he will show him greater works than these that he may marvel. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. &gt;&gt; So therefore there was always looking to see this supernatural moving of the waters and when they saw listen and there had to be something supernatural happening and as soon as the supernatural happened they made a rush for it. &gt;&gt; Look at the church today. Here we go. Are you ready? &gt;&gt; God wants us to watch for the supernatural. &gt;&gt; When his word is made manifest and vindicated, &gt;&gt; God want us to what? Watch for the supernatural. &gt;&gt; When his word is manifested and vindicated, now we run away from it because it's not connected with organization. &gt;&gt; And that's what people say is it's not God. So something God do something in this church and nobody here want to identify with it because it's not in their church. You think God have time with church? God not in time, you know. &gt;&gt; God not in space time, you know. God outside of that, you know. God does what he want to do. You know, when God came out on the pillar of fire on the mountain and tell Moses, I have come down to deliver my people and you are going. And Moses had all the excuses. He's still going. &gt;&gt; 40 years relaxing. You're still going. I come down to set my people free. And I call you to do the job. And I believe there are people here called for a job. And you're not going to escape. Oh, glory to God. He will come down to deliver you, to get the job done. You have a job to do. God raised you up to do it. Glory to God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. But the thing about it, you got to get started. Something got to start this thing rolling. Something got to started this moving. Oh, glory. Are you going to get started this morning? God want you to get started. And if you only get started, God will do the rest. Oh, give the Lord some praises. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. All of Israel know God is able. All of Israel know God have power. But but Goliath challenging Israel for 40 days and 40 nights and not a man move. &gt;&gt; Polishing sword and polishing boots, polishing metal and polishing ranks. &gt;&gt; But nobody here facing Golth. Here come a little fell named David. Oh, glory to God. Who conquered a bear and lion. Here come a fell not qualified to be in the army. Here come a different kind of a man. Praise God. And if he can only get started, God will do the rest. And D and when Goliath saw David, Goliath prophesied, I will feed him to the birds. And David prophesied, I'll cut your head off. Prophecy versus prophecy. Oh, we coming along the line now. Give the Lord a shout. There's a prophecy of a bride revival. There's a prophecy of a super church. There's a prophecy of a super race. Which devil will stop that? Oh, give the Lord some praises. The Bible said David ran to meet Goliath. Oh, come on now, Gideon. That's when a man not afraid. That's when a man anointed. That's when a man of commission. That's when a man getting started. And David took his sling and begin to swing. Oh, glory to God. He was swinging. He was getting started. And God directed the stone. And once you prepare to get start, get started. Something supernatural is on its way. Oh, praise the Lord for some praise this morning. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. &gt;&gt; Today, the Holy Spirit, the supernatural power of God is on the earth and in people run from it. &gt;&gt; Instead of getting into it, the word made flesh, vindicated and everything else. And he did and promised if it isn't connected with our groups we have nothing to do with it. &gt;&gt; My this man wasn't able to walk this man wasn't able to run but God came and healed this man this man. &gt;&gt; All right. Now here this part I want to get to now watch now how that God All right. The priest had got to a place and got away from the supernatural part of God and have been teaching the doctrine of their own theories &gt;&gt; of what they taught. So the priests or the ministers or the pastors of that day got away from the supernatural part. &gt;&gt; But God has always had a witness here on the earth. &gt;&gt; And brother Abraham said they said my calling is to get a gift that came from God for an inspiration for the people. &gt;&gt; I am just a little bitty part of it. It was given to me in order that it be demonstrated before the church that everybody might catch the vision of the supernatural part that God lives and reigns in his church today. &gt;&gt; So the gift given to him was to demonstrate the supernatural part to inspire everybody that God is not dead. He's alive. He could discern you. He could discern your thoughts. He could discern desires in your heart. He could tell you what you tell anybody. Oh, give the Lord a shout. He could declare himself to you and you will know our truth is that had to be God. &gt;&gt; He said he's a little bitty part of it. Amen. &gt;&gt; So the church ministers, he said, instead of the has preaching the doctrine of men instead of the doctrine of God and have left out the supernatural part of God's word and explain it away that the days of miracle is passed and has gotten down to a place where there's a very little small remnant left that believe in God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That believe in God. &gt;&gt; The supernatural. That woman, she was in debt. Her husband died and she wanted a breakthrough. She wanted a financial breakthrough. And he said, "Young man of God, I need help. My creditors on me on on on the trail." And he said, "Listen, go and borrow vessels. Get empty vessels. Get them. Get them. Get them. Don't borrow a few, you know, borrow as much as you could borrow." But you know what he asked her? What do you have in your house? Oh, glory to God. What do you have in your hand? Remember when the multitude was there to be fed and she said, "What do you have?" I have to have something to work with. I want to have something to work with. You can't give me nothing. You have to put something to work with. We say we have a little boy with five loaves and two fishes. That's good enough. Bring it to me. In that boy hands is five loaves and two fishes. In Jesus hand, it feeding 5,000 and have baskets to remain. Oh, give the Lord some praises. Oh, glory to God. If we could only get started. If you could only get our hands on this thing. If you could only get this wheel turning. If you're going to get a revival going or give the Lord a shout in the house. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Note when Jesus asked, "What do you have?" And they said, "Oh, a boy here with five loaves and two fishes." Somebody said, "What are these among so many?" You see that mouth champion? &gt;&gt; You hear that, Trinidadian? What are these among so many? You hear that? You hear that testimony? What are these among so many? Jesus said, "Bring it to me." &gt;&gt; And he blessed it. Oh, give the Lord some praise. Don't get me get me excited now. He blessed it. Yes. Oh, God. Why didn't bring a bakery? Why didn't bring a sack of flour? Why didn't bring all the bakers in the country to feed all these people? He didn't talk that talk. He took the five loaves. He took the two fleshes. He blessed them. He said, "Break it &gt;&gt; and share it." &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. The brothers in front felt privileged. Hallelujah. Glory. They're in the VIP section. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They're in front. &gt;&gt; They say, "Oh, God." He usher in the right place, you know. &gt;&gt; Man, get the first. You can imagine how good that brother felt. &gt;&gt; The the first brother felt fish and bread and looking back at you. You sure could multip if anybody's getting you know as far as he concerned. He eat. Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Eye closed. He look everybody got everything left and he breaking and sharing. Breaking. Listen, the people didn't even recognize it was a miracle. It was breaking, sharing, breaking, sharing, breaking, sharing, breaking, sharing, breaking, sharing. More you break, the more you share. More you share, your more you break. Oh, give the Lord a shout in the house. &gt;&gt; What do you have in your hand? What do you have in your house? When everything finished, 10 people scratch it. Wait a minute. &gt;&gt; How this match adding up? &gt;&gt; This match not matching. &gt;&gt; Five loaves, two fishes, 5,000 people fed. &gt;&gt; And look how much baskets remain. &gt;&gt; Something This had to be a miracle. That's what we're talking about. We getting started this morning. I want to get you started this morning. Then something supernatural going to break in your life, break in your home, break in your marriage, break in your Oh, glory to God. Give the Lord some praises. Even your finances. Oh, give the Lord a shout. That woman did not know the full revelation of what Elisha told her to do. &gt;&gt; He said, "Woman, go and borrow vessels &gt;&gt; because he hear she have a a little bit of oil." He said, "Borrow, borrow, borrow, borrow and close the door." &gt;&gt; Now, people like to mind your business. What are you doing there? &gt;&gt; Mind your oy. Mind your own business. Close the door. &gt;&gt; Get your sons to bring them bottles and start to fill it. &gt;&gt; She full one and she keep from that one bottle she had. She full this, but she full. I like to ask me neighbor I see kind of foolishness. You and your stinking rotten flesh. The prophet said go and borrow &gt;&gt; not a few. &gt;&gt; Go from the first house, second house, last house, your bottle and listen. Stack it high. &gt;&gt; And one by one tell the son said there is no more. &gt;&gt; Then Elijah said go and sell that. &gt;&gt; Pay your debts &gt;&gt; and the rest you live off of that. God concerned about your finances too. I hear you. I hear you. Give me a shout on that. God concern about your bills, your debts, your creditors, your payments. Or give the Lord a shout. He carth for you through sunshine and shadows. &gt;&gt; All right. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That started &gt;&gt; when God want to get started. He find a man name Abraham &gt;&gt; and Abraham the Bible believe God &gt;&gt; a old man. God said I bless you and bless you and God talk so much a blessing. Talk to Abraham get a little irritated cuz he old. Say old have no children. Say he said give God back check. Oh you say blessing me and this and that and I go childless. say you're playing rude. Come on, let me talk to you. When your mouth loud like that and you're talking like that, I will I will tell you like it is. He said, "Come the stars." &gt;&gt; When he runs on numbers, he say God says, "So shall I see it be &gt;&gt; you have a son." &gt;&gt; True Sarah. So don't even think about divorcing Sarah cuz through Sarah, you have that son. You had to treat her right. Treat her nice like she could stay. &gt;&gt; She went run away. And Abraham, the Bible said, believe God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And God count his revelation, his faith as righteousness. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And Isaac was natural seed. But the faith of Abraham, this is so fresh, was a supernatural faith that brought a supernatural seed. Isaac was natural seed. Isaac died. All them died. But Jesus Christ, Abraham's seed, supernatural faith produced a supernatural seed. a supernatural son that not only died but he rose from the dead and is alive this morning to confirm his word this morning with signs and wonders and miracles. Do I hear a shout in the house this morning? &gt;&gt; So Abraham, it wasn't just faith for a natural son. He said it was a supernatural fate that had a supernatural seed that produced a supernatural resurrection. &gt;&gt; Okay, we're going good. Our 15 pages is now on page six. So, we're going really good. &gt;&gt; Now, when they had to apply the blood under the judgment of death in Egypt, they use a weed called hup, which was a common weed. The prophet said the hissup speaks that of common weeds that you could get it anywhere. You pick it up, dip it in the blood and apply the blood because God said when I see the blood, I'll pass over you. &gt;&gt; What do I say? When I see a fancy car in front of your house, I'll pass over you. &gt;&gt; Or when I see a window painting white, he want to see blood. &gt;&gt; God have a way and we have our way. &gt;&gt; And God's way was I must see the blood. People passing about, oh God, look at the blood and look at the color of all you get free paint. You have free red. Without the blood, you died. &gt;&gt; So you have to follow through with what is instructed to you &gt;&gt; because God is outside of this dimension. &gt;&gt; And he honors his word. &gt;&gt; So when God said, "When I see the blood, I'm going to pass over you." You can't say, "Well, I put molasses. I'm going to put some kind of thing. I go put coke. I go put red solo." No. When I see the blood, I'm going to pass over you. That blood must come from a lamb that was slain. Oh, give the Lord a shout. In other words, you have to come into obedience to what God have said. Oh, give the Lord a praise. It's not just coming to church and saying amen, hallelujah, and shouting and jumping. It's whether or not you're coming into obedience to what God have said. &gt;&gt; But the part I want to get here is that the hissup was common weeds. Hup means your fate. Somebody tries to have supernatural faith, that's the reason you miss your healing. Faith is a common thing. You have faith to come to church. You got faith to walk out of here. You have faith to start your car. You got faith to eat your dinner. That's the way it is. Common faith. And to apply the blood was was was that was going anywhere in Egypt. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. So this book of redemption talking about root have four stations, four junctions in Ruth and Boaz. And we know root deciding where you go I'll go where die I die and so on like that. And then but here what I want to get to and root now was deciding perfectly that justification and whatn not. Now notice root deciding she had to make a decision whether she was going to decide to go over there or not. She had to make a decision and that's the way every believer has to do. You've got to leave your own haunts. You've got to leave your old life. You've got to leave the old things of the world. That to leave the old haunts of life. It's what you have done. You become a Christian. You left the pool room. You left the nightclubs. You had to come over into a bunch of people that look like they have spasms. They quivered and shook and cried and shook the head and jump up and down. It was like a crazy bunch to you. But you know, you had to make a decision whether you would go or not. And you know that when you did, your own people was going to make fun of you, the ones you left behind. Isn't that right? Now, Ruth had the same thing. That would be the Moabites would say to her, she cross over into the Israel to a bunch of fanatics. She had to make a decision. She had to decide and finally she made a decision. She come across to the new land. That is justification. Decision. Justification. Now watch. Now watch. Now what? Ruth making a decision on type of the gentile church. She cross over. The next thing she had to do. She had to work. She become a legalist. She had to work out her own salvation with fear and trembling. She went out into the field and put her clothes upon her and went out into the field and gleaned behind the maidens in order to get sustaining food for the day. &gt;&gt; Is that right? So she worked her way through the stage of legalism. And that stage of legalism is sanctification. &gt;&gt; I find the church um how you say it um young people say right you're biting teeth. I forget what they call it. You're pulling teeth that when you give them instruction what like you're pulling teeth. you give me pain. In other words, you want to do your own thing. You don't want to get this part here, this part of sanctification. You don't want to let your hair grow and cover your knees and and and take all the makeup off and whatever. You don't want to do that. But this is part of it. &gt;&gt; This is part of it. You coming in order and you'll get it just now. You have to do something to honor God. Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't be when you you want to smoke, you smoke or want to drink, you drink, you want to party, your party and whatnot, and then you want you want God to bless you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It can't work that way. &gt;&gt; That's exactly what the church did. Luther did by faith. Watch. And what? I've got to quit. You've got something to do. &gt;&gt; That's what I get into now. I've got to quit. I've got to let my hair grow out, said the woman. Watch. They had to quit wearing the paints on their faces. They had to wear the skirts and so on like that. They had to do something. That's what she did. The state of justification, the state of sanctification. And afterwards, after what she rested. &gt;&gt; And afterward she rested. Is that right? And now here is the rest is the Holy Spirit the Sabbath day. Amen. So when root was resting it was a type of the church resting in the promises and then afterwards root was rewarded and that's what the church did. It entered into justification under Luther. It went in sanification under Wesley. So listen in this message it cannot be we in the message. No the message consists of justification sanification bapt Holy Ghost and the token &gt;&gt; or the Holy Ghost itself the person. That is what this message is all about. Because when God restoring, God restored the whole thing. &gt;&gt; I'll restore what the canker worm, caterpillar, palm, and locust. Four stages. It took God to restore to bring back the church in position. &gt;&gt; So you cannot leave out any. &gt;&gt; Now they want to leave out the battle holy ghost, but they can't leave out the battle holy ghost. And you can't leave out sanification. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Sanvic when you get busted, when you get rebuked, when you get corrected, when you get instructed, when you get praise God, the word come to advise you as to how to behave because the mysteries come to reveal how to behave yourself. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout. Not how to join church. Everybody joining church, we not talking about that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What the Bible said, he came unto his own, his own receive him not, but as many as receive him, to them give power &gt;&gt; to become. In other words, to be transformed into &gt;&gt; to become the sons of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God saw Adam placed positionally in the garden of Eden. And that man fell &gt;&gt; with no rum, wine, women or whiskey. No booze, no ganja. And that man that God placed in the garden of Eden fell. God said, "I'm not going to have that no more." &gt;&gt; That was a man perfect man standing there and he fell. God said, "I'm going to let him go through the process." And that process is where you get transformed &gt;&gt; by the trial of your faith. So we can't back down now and say too hot. No, we are prepared for it. God made us ready for it. God called some special forces to be in this last day. God could have put you in lutter day and Wesley and all them day with the big bonnet and everything else and horse and buggy and you taking four hours to get to service. God could have put you back inside of there. But God put you here because you belong to God's special forces in the last days that could deal with that devil anywhere, anytime, any place, under any condition. We were raised up for that purpose. Do you are you with me? &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; All right. Scripture Ecclesiastes 11:4. &gt;&gt; He that observeth the wind shall not sow, and he that regardeth the clouds shall not reap. Let me read it again. Ecclesiastes 11:4. He that observeth the wind shall not sow. He that regarded the clouds shall not reap. It means that you don't have to wait for optimal conditions to act. &gt;&gt; The pathway to hell is paved with good intentions. &gt;&gt; I intend to be saved. I intend to serve God. &gt;&gt; I intend to press. I intend. Intend. Intent. That's only intention. &gt;&gt; But you have to act. &gt;&gt; The action is what made the difference. &gt;&gt; Oh, not the intention. intention in your head, in your mind, but you have to act. And a lot of people, they are unwilling to act. And we get on to them lepers who say, "If we stay here, we will die. If we go out to the enemy, we will die." Basically, go out. Yes, we are staying here and die. We know here already. We know this is death already. Everybody starving in the in in in the village &gt;&gt; in the city. &gt;&gt; Why stay here and die? &gt;&gt; You got to do something. I ain't going to let no pastor man kill me. I ain't going to let no elder man kill me. No deacon man kill more. No church kill me. Hallelujah. I'm going to live. Jesus said, "I come that you might have life and have it more abundantly. Therefore, I'm going to press. I'm going to stay on the battlefield. I'm going to fight the fight of faith." Oh, give the Lord some praises. Glory to God. Hallelujah. I'm not going to accept my sickness. I'm going to claim my healing. I'm not going to accept depression, accept frustration, accept no joy. I'm going to claim all what God promised, all what Jesus died for. Hallelujah. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; So this scripture, he that observe the wind shall not sow is that you're not using your eyes. You're not trying to go by optimum condition to do anything. You're doing it because you need to be done. You're doing it because you need to get started. You're doing it because you need to do something different because what you have been doing, you have seen the results. Have you considered your results over the years &gt;&gt; and you're still continuing the same mindset? You're not even seeking advice or counsel. &gt;&gt; You're just going doing your own thing. Just whatever you feel to do and you're doing and you're doing and you're not weighing out. That's why you have to say it take introspection look into you &gt;&gt; it easy outside outside busy busy busy busy busy stop pause silah meditate &gt;&gt; sila is to take a pause &gt;&gt; think on these things try to get the mirror that's why this social media and all these phone and everything that people are so busy and caught up and caught up they have no time to get even get conviction &gt;&gt; because they're so busy that they got allowing the spirit to bring them a conviction. I bring a guidance, a leading. Not so. Don't go that way. Don't say that. Watch your tongue. Watch your mouth. Listen to this now. But I'm speaking about is the crowds get tremendous. We can we can't put them in buildings. He say sometimes as much as 500,000. That's half a million people in one single gathering. He said, "You have got the seasons where is where is not not raining and pouring down rain and those poor people. I've seen women sit out here with their hair just stringing down fine dress people and sat in that rain all day long. Just sat there and it just pouring and thundering and lighting and storms blow and them weaving back and forth against one another and waiting to come to be prayed for." Get it? Get it back. Now you know God honors faith like that. So what we end up now is a bunch of people that are entitled. They feel it is a right. &gt;&gt; You know long time they didn't have cell phone they had what they call pages. Think about P now that looks so cuckoo and and so far long time when you see somebody on cell phone is a big long thing you know like antenna you know a big clumsy looking thing. When you see somebody with a cell phone or whatever that was in the ears because young people now know what we talking about. You need to go to pay uh phone boot &gt;&gt; and put a coin &gt;&gt; that you swing in your hand. &gt;&gt; They don't know that no old phone boot gone. You see what I'm talking about now? So when somebody have a cell phone time that person have money now even a dog have a cell phone every everybody have cell phone. You get what I'm saying now? &gt;&gt; You have Bible on cell phone, camera on cell phone, news on cell phone, TV on cell phone, everything on cell phone. Devil making sure people occupying busy busy busy talking to wife and what kind of talk is there? &gt;&gt; Half talk have your eyes down cell phone. &gt;&gt; So if you don't make time for God, it ain't coming. If you don't spell it out, pen it out. Say, you know what? This is my allotted time to do this. I'm going to take off my phone. I'm going to take off my tablet. I'm going to do this. If you don't do that, it not coming. You know, &gt;&gt; one thing, Satan is a interesting character. You know, you always give people options. You know, &gt;&gt; yeah. What? Football, take cricket, cricket, basketball, basketball, ski, ski, tennis. Yeah. Tennis, &gt;&gt; swimming. If you have things swimming, the back wrestling, running. So, sports, sports, and on top of that, they bring the joke cuz the comedians, this comedian, that comedian, just laughing, holy, holy, holy, holy. You're laughing like drugs, you know. You're laughing your sorrows away. You're laughing your money problem away. Just laughing like life is a joke until you wake up, get wake up, call. It's not a joke. It is dead serious. The devil after your soul. &gt;&gt; It's not a joke. He's after your soul. &gt;&gt; Not after money. Your soul. &gt;&gt; You know, God honors faith like that. And this is the part I want to get to. You have got to do something to for God to honor. &gt;&gt; You show him. The people that's got everything handed to them easy. They don't usually they don't do nothing for it. The gift is free. But it seems that if you are born with a silver spoon, you ever heard that? They don't appreciate it. But you got to do something. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Praise God. Praise God. &gt;&gt; He said, "There's probably many a man sitting here tonight. If he's done something that God told him to do long time ago, he'll be preaching the gospel somewhere." Do something. &gt;&gt; Don't just stand still. If you're not a preacher, testify. Do something somewhere. Don't stand still. If you're washing the dishes, why testify to the neighbor? Get out and pass tracks. Do something. Don't stand still. what is in your hand. &gt;&gt; Get doing something. Oh, praise the name of the Lord. Hallelujah. Paul said, I know I could preach the gospel. That's my duty. I'm a preacher. He's a preacher, but the devil is a preacher. That's our duty to be preachers. Well, that's just what we supposed to do. But let me do something beyond that. &gt;&gt; I've got a right to take up money, but I'm going to make tents just to show I can sacrifice. You talk about Paul &gt;&gt; and he said it's an honorable marriage is honorable among all. The ben is undefiled. It's good for man to be married. I've got a right to be married. How? Now I could be married. I've got a legal right to be married, but I just won't get married. Paul, I want to do another sacrifice to the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Every man has to know his calling. Let him some as unox for the word of God's sakes. We want to do something. Here we go, saints. Beyond our duty. &gt;&gt; And if you are already born again of the spirit of God and say, "That's my duty to go to church. I guess I'll have to go." Well, I want to do more than that. I want to win some souls for Christ. I want to do something. I want to visit the sick and do something for him. It's my duty to preach at funerals. It's my duty to preach the gospel. If my duty to pray for the sick, let me do something else. Let me get out and do something else where God will honor me by it. Oh, give the Lord some praises. You know about Cornelius in Acts 10. He was a just man. He was a devout. He was a helpful man. He was a sharing man. He was a giving man. He give arms. He kept helping people and God recognized that. He was doing something that God could honor and God honored that man faith. God honored that man giving by sending Peter to speak to them and while Peter was speaking the Holy Ghost fell and they were filled with the Holy Ghost and they got baptized in Jesus name. Oh God that mean we could do something that God could honor. Oh give the Lord some praises. Glory to God. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Let me give you one more. The woman had a daughter vector with the devil. Them Pharisees and scribes can't cast out no devils. They want to know the devil's business. Them is part of the devil family too. Them part devil business. Them can't cast out nothing. Woman stand there. Lord have mercy upon me daughter of the devil. She aren't disciples. Help me. Help me. Help me. They don't know what to do with the woman. They don't know how to dismiss the woman. The woman standing there. Does she come to Jesus? You worship. Hallelujah. Glory. Hallelujah. Jesus a look at her. He say it's not fit to take the children's bread and cast it a dog. You see that now? Express God on news day, Facebook, Tik Tok, Instagram &gt;&gt; pictures going viral. The preacher called me a dog. What kind of church is that? The last service I went to never going back church again. &gt;&gt; The woman stood her ground. She know the scribe help. She stood her grounds. &gt;&gt; She call her a dog. It's not fitted to the train. And she accept that &gt;&gt; her spirit &gt;&gt; accept that. Receive that. And because she accept and receive it, she begin to see what the dog see. &gt;&gt; She said, "But Lord, even the dog take crumbs on the master table." &gt;&gt; That woman got into a channel, &gt;&gt; a natural woman saying the right thing. Jesus said it this way, "For this, &gt;&gt; your daughter is delivered." &gt;&gt; So you understand what happened there? She said the right thing. She got started. And when she said the right thing, fire went up to heaven and power went back down and that demon had to bust off her daughter. Oh, give the Lord a shout. How do you not know your attitude this morning? Fire striking your house. Give the Lord a shout. Something supernatural is about to break. If we could get started. Oh, get the Hallelujah. My my my my now when Jesus but I'm saying something here important if you notice considering the five fishes in order to do something Jesus taking something to do something with &gt;&gt; you get &gt;&gt; in order to bring faith in this building tonight for healing Jesus has to take something to do something with. So the first thing he has to get get somebody here that's got faith to be healed &gt;&gt; and that will strike the audience. &gt;&gt; So you were showing Jesus needed to get bread to multiply it. &gt;&gt; You need something to start it. &gt;&gt; If you could get started. &gt;&gt; You can't sit and steer. &gt;&gt; You have to want the woman said if I could just touch the hem of his garment. Do &gt;&gt; you have no scripture for that? But she told herself that and God set it up that Jesus is around with a ton of people around him and she had to press away &gt;&gt; and she pressed until she touched and she was healed because she said it to herself if I could just touch. I ain't taking it for granted. I go dead because the doctor says so. I got dead because they have no cure for me. They have no pills for me. No, I'm going to get touched. So, she was pressing for the supernatural. She was pressing beyond what her husband told her about that small church, that noisy church. She was pressing beyond that what they told her and she got delivered. Oh, give the Lord some praises. I want when you come into this building, you come to press. You come for a touch. You come for your breakthrough. You come for a breakthrough for your family. You're not taking this is how it's supposed to be. Come family. You're not taking this is how it's supposed to be. Come home. Come to church. Go home. Ordinary. Same way. No. Jesus, he taking what faith the blind man had or what faith the woman had that was deaf and started with that building faith. See what I mean? He takes something to do something with. &gt;&gt; Let's go. If you have to do something that you can't do in Jesus name, let it alone. &gt;&gt; Somebody say take a little drink. You can't do that in Jesus name. So let it alone. &gt;&gt; Somebody say play a little cars. You can't do that in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Let it alone. You can't tell smarty dirty jokes at your bridge party. You can't tell that in Jesus name. You can't wear shorts in Jesus name. So let it alone. Whatever you do in word or deed, do all in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Oh my. Hallelujah. So brother I'm talking about he there was sitting there a number of other day with he came a whirlwind told us brother bankswood and them he said we take up this rock and threw it up in the air said thus say the lord you will see right away and I pick up a rock up on the top of the mountain and threw it up in the air and coming down it started the whirlwind the suction of it. Then he said these words, you have to do something to cause something to follow it. &gt;&gt; And that is where I get the inspiration from. If you could and you if you get s you have to do something for something to follow it. Jesus took a piece of bread and broke it and then multiplied from that piece of bread. He took water and poured into a picture. Elijah took salt and put it in a cruise. Remember when they asked Jesus that the wine run out? What did Jesus do? He said, "Draw me some pictures of water." And when he draw the water water and he poured that water bypassed the processes of grapes and pressing and and fermenting bypass all of that and the water was turned into wine. But he take something to have make something and he took you. You had that something. What is he going to make? Oh, give the Lord some praises. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, he has to say something to do something. &gt;&gt; You have to find you. Oh, praise God. So, Bam said this, "And picking up this rock thrown in the air coming down started the whirlwind." &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God. Praise God. If you could only get started. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God will do the rest. &gt;&gt; Praise be to Jesus. &gt;&gt; My God. A quote. Someone want leave it out here. Hallelu. That's a direct quot. If we could only get started. The mechanics is here and so is the dynamics. &gt;&gt; If you could only get started, God will do the rest. Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Musician said, "Get ready. Get ready. Get ready. Get ready." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. You don't even not know how it's going to finish so fast, right? &gt;&gt; I got started already. You know, &gt;&gt; God have to do the rest. All right. 2 Kings chapter 7 verse three. You want to read that scripture? 2 Kings 7:3. And there were four lepous men at the entering in the of the gate, and they said one to another, why sit we here until we die? If we say we will enter into the city, then is famine in the city. We shall die there. &gt;&gt; If we sit still here, we will die also. &gt;&gt; Now therefore, come, let us fall unto the host of the Syrians. If they save us alive, we shall live. &gt;&gt; If they kill us, we shall die. So this is death everywhere. &gt;&gt; Death to go in the city because So this is death everywhere. &gt;&gt; Famine. Death to stay outside &gt;&gt; because outside is is dead. Death to go to the enemy. &gt;&gt; And these guys, listen to their testimony. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Verse five. And they arose in the twilight to go into the camp of the Syrians. And when they were come to the uttermost part of the camp of the Syria, behold, there was no man there. &gt;&gt; For the Lord had made the host of the Syrian. You see that supernatural part? &gt;&gt; They made a choice. &gt;&gt; They made a decision to act &gt;&gt; from the most dingiest faith, the lowest level of faith. This faith is based upon reasoning. If we stay here, we will die. If we go here, we will die. It's best we go this way. There's the enemy outside. Let's go this way. &gt;&gt; They might feed us. They might kill us. &gt;&gt; We stand a better chance &gt;&gt; because these people have no food. &gt;&gt; They have no buffet. &gt;&gt; They have no meat, no drinks, no macaroni pie. Don't go. Don't imagination go nowhere. &gt;&gt; They have no food back there. &gt;&gt; I We will die there. We going to the enemy. And when they make their move, they got started. &gt;&gt; Oh, if what but what what if they didn't get started? They made a move, they got started. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And the Bible said, "For the Lord had made a host of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots and a noise of horses and a noise of a great host. And they said one to another, lo, the king of Israel had hired against us the king of the Hittites, and the king of Egyptians had come upon us." Wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight &gt;&gt; and left their tents and their horses and the camp it was they fled for their life. And when the lepers came to the uttermost part of the camp they went from one tent did eat and drink carried silver and gold and rainmen and went and hid it. And again they enter another tent. Hallelujah. Food another tent. Hallelujah. Silver and gold. Where you want better than that? Okay, give the Lord I shout not only silver and bowl you know but food on top of that. Hallelujah. Afterwards they say it's not right. We can't have all this thing here and for ourselves. Let us go back to the city and tell them there's money. There's bounty out here. Oh, give the Lord some praises. What a shout. What a praise. If you could get started, church, let's get started. Let's get started this morning. Let's get started with forgiveness.

And if there's a request this morning that you want to show by raise of hand as we approach the throne of grace this morning, shall we bow our heads? Oh gracious heavenly father, we thank you Lord that it just takes a start for you to move on the scene. Just the request is an activation Lord. You said Lord I stand at the door and knock and if any man just open it. Just takes that opening and you could walk in and fix any situation. You could walk into any room and solve every problem. Lord, we have stood behind this sacred desk so many times and seen prayer requests become notes of praise, Lord, because that's just who you are. You are a God that's interested, as the pastor preached, in every aspect of our life. Be it our physical, be it our financial, our mental, our spiritual, there's not an area, Lord, that is not of interest to you. And we come this morning with Lord various prayer requests Lord for our sister Gloria Timothy Lord for a total healing Lord down with the virus.

And for the husband of Sister Joanne Williams, Lord, suffering with kidneys and gallbladder and how the doctors want to remove the gallbladder and and and and and try to treat the kidney and he can't sleep and he can't eat, Lord. How the enemy has attacked, Lord, Father, but Lord, healing is a children's bread, Father. You are still the great physician. There's no situation that you cannot deal with. There's no problem you cannot solve, Father. Lord, when the doctors are scratching their heads, Father, you know exactly what to do, Father. So, Father, we give you permission as the great physician, Lord. Father, we welcome your intervention. We welcome a second opinion, Lord, a real opinion on the matter, Father. Lord, that you would step into this situation with healing on your wings, Father, Lord, to touch and may this request come back as a note of praise, Father. And for every hand that was raised here in the sanctuary downstairs on the internet, those who may even watch the tape, may the angel of the Lord uh who is able to answer every request, every desire, every plea, every supplication, may you minister to the ears of salvation.

We are so happy to have you here with us. Amen. So, just for a few announcements, uh there'll be a brief meeting of all the Sunday school teachers immediately after service in the Sunday school area. Service continues this afternoon at 3 p.m. for the Lord's Supper. for that service this coming week. Uh we know brother Norris is having special meetings on Wednesday night, Thursday night, and Friday night. I want to encourage you to remember those services in prayer at Hope uh Christian Assembly, Princess Town, Hope Road, uh 7:15 p.m. on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. By the grace of God, we will send out the links so you could be able to connect. There will be no service here this coming Wednesday. And by the grace of God, we sent out the flyer to the church. Brother Daniel Hernandez from Little Flock Tabernacle will be ministering on Wednesday night. Brother Yoel Peters from Bethlehem Tabernacle will be ministering on Thursday night. And by the grace of God, I'll be ministering on Friday night. We would have announced if you're interested in going down, please let Adrien and brother Andy know so we could have a count to be able to communicate to brother Norris for those who'd like to be there physically. And if you can't be there physically, you're invited to certainly connect online to the services. The services are dedicated to the young people. All are welcome, but it's dedicated to young people. So, make sure and get the young people connected. If they can make it to the services, we encourage you to do so, but certainly get them connected to the services. I know God will bless in a special way. Do remember brother Norris in prayer, the church there in prayer, all those that will be ministering in prayer as well. By the grace of God, you love him. Can we give the Lord a hand of praise? So once again, there'll be no service this coming Wednesday uh here at Tesl Tabernacle. There'll be no services this coming Friday cuz we'll be in Princess Town. And our next service will be this coming Sunday uh at 10 a.m. Uh a few other announcements. we would have uh communicated that on August the 31st we would have a special service which is the last Sunday of this month. It's also independence holiday so the Monday will be a public holiday as well and a couple things will be happening on that day. We will be praying for the students that are going back out to school. We know that there's an extra week that has been granted to extend their holiday but we will still stick to that date. I see some of the young people smiling. that one week and people like, well, I don't want to go to school. So, even though there's one more week for holidays, we will still stick to that date to pray for the young people that are going back out to school uh in September, as well as celebrate those that are graduating from uh the Sunday school program. In addition on that day um Rodovid would like to also announce that we'll have a special thanksgiving meal for the entire church. There's no cost to you the believers. It's just to for us to celebrate and thank God for his grace and his mercy. So that day would be a day just to come and relax in the presence of God. We have a church. We have a prayer for all those going out to school. We celebrate those are who are graduating from Sunday school and we celebrate with a meal as a church and we have a precious time in the Lord. Sunday is the Lord's day. So we come when we come to church you shouldn't be thinking of heading back home and leave Monday for Monday. When Monday reach we leave with Monday but when Sunday is here we want to celebrate the presence of the Lord each other's company and as much as we can in his presence. Can we give the Lord a hand of praise? All right. So, last and certainly not least, uh after service, after the evening service will be brother Michael Blackman's group, which is group five is Canada to serve. And next Sunday, Lord willing, we'll be group four, which is brother Malan Alexander's group. So, may the Lord richly bless you, ushers, deacons in such a special way. And yes, I praise you. I lift you up and I magnify your name. I love you, Lord, today because you care for me in such a special way. And yes, I praise you and I magnify your name.
