to welcome you to our sunday morning service uh god bless you and welcome so this morning we want to go into the scriptures uh this is something that i have in my heart and i trust the lord would uh really bring it out today um wondering from colossians chapter one reading from verse 14 to 28. when the reforms in john 12 was 20-24 and job 42 5 and 6. reading from colossians chapter 1 verse 4 14 in whom we have redemption to his blood even the forgiveness of sins who is the image of the invisible god the firstborn of every creature for by him were all things created that in heaven that are in earth visible and invisible whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things were created by him and for him and he's before all things and by him all things consist and he's the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence for it please the father that in him should all fullness dwell and having made peace through the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things unto himself but he might say whether there be things in earth or things in heaven and you that were sometimes alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works yet no had he reconciled in the body of his flesh to death to present you holy and unbelievable and unreproveable in his sight if he continued in defeat grounded and settled and be not move away from the hope of the gospel which you have heard and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven whereof i paul are made a minister who now rejoice in my sufferings for you and up that which is behind of the affliction of christ in my flesh for his body's sake which is the church whereof i am made a minister according to the dispensation of god which is given to me for you to fulfill the word of god even the mystery which has been hid from ages and from generations but now is made manifest to his saints to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory whom we preach warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we represent every man perfect in christ jesus our second scripture is from sin john chapter 12 reading from verse 20. and there were certain greeks among them that came to worship at the feast the same came therefore to philip which was of bethesda of galileans decide him saying sir we would see jesus philip come in and tell us andrew and again andrew and philip tell jesus and jesus answered saying the all is come that the son of man should be glorified verily verily i say unto you except the corner wheat fall into the ground and die it's about the lawn but if it die it bringing forth much fruit our last scripture is from job chapter 42 read in verse 5 and 6. have heard of thee by the hearing of the air but now my eyes see it thee wherefore i uphold myself and repent and dust and ashes let's let's pray one more time father we have read your word we pray the power of your spirit will come and move in your word and move into the hearts of your people no man could give revelation the holy ghost alone is the divine revealer of the revelation of jesus christ may the spirit come down upon the people's minds hearts lives in their homes and reveal your word to them in jesus name i ask it amen amen god bless you may be seated where you are praise god so this morning i have a title the second full of god's threefold mystery that's the title that i have this morning the second full of god's threefold mystery i have a subject the death of a corner of wheat and have an inspiration the spirit of truth and that inspiration the spirit of truth that is some of the text jesus in john 16 13 how be it when he prophecy he the spirit of truth is come he would guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come and i have one other context scripture my song strange but since i'm from saint john chapter 21 don't if you'll get into it but is 18 and 19. and this is jesus speaking to peter saying very very nice unto thee when thou was young though goodness thyself and walkers withered are with buddhists but when thou art behold thou shalt stretch for thy hands and another shall goody and carry thee with the doubt what is not this speak he signifying by what debt he should glorify god and when he had spoken this he said unto him follow me and in the amplified it's written this way i assure you most suddenly i tell you when you were young you good at yourself and put on your own belt or girdle and you walked about wherever you pleased to go but when you grow old you were stretched out your hands and someone else will put a girl around you and carry you where you do not wish to go he said this to indicate what kind of debt peter would glorify god and after this he said unto him follow me so this morning we truly want to follow jesus because this is what this gospel is all about is all about jesus christ to the end as we read in colossians praise the lord that he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminences all things he might have the preeminences okay so let's go the first fall of this threefold revelation of god is god wanting to reveal himself that is the first foe it's very simple it's one two three a first full a second full and a third full of this great mystery that go at hand in his mind god was so mysterious the challenge for this mysterious god how to reveal himself and which he did in christ jesus and the book of daniel when daniel was trying to understand the mystery of god god told daniel in daniel 12 8-9 and i heard and i understood not what then said i oh my lord what shall be the end of these things and he said go thy way daniel for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end so there was a specific time that god allocated for the unsealing of the book and the unsealing of the words of the book march 18 1963 to march 24 1963 the opening of this seven seals as shown to the 20th century prophet william branham a prophet according to malachi 4. so all this book was open because this mighty angel of revelation 10 came down and brought this open book to this prophet and sent out a message that we now have on books and tapes and after the prophet left the scene because time must unfold a bright history many men stepped into the void or gap left by the departure of that prophet some positive some negative this void or gap or space or or that that that that place that empty place after the prophet left is to be filled by the manifestation of the sons of god in their season and that time so we said some men step in there positive some men step into the negative paul in acts 20 27-31 said for i have not shunned to declare unto you all the gospel the counsel of god and he gave a warning take he therefore unto yourselves unto all the flock over which the holy ghost had made you overseers to feed the church of god which had purchased with his own blood for i know this paul was a prophet and he is prophesying and i know this that after mighty parting shall grievous wolves enter in among you not sparing the flock also of your own self shall menarize speaking perverse things to draw away disciples after them not disciples to follow christ now this is disciples to follow them verse 31 paul speaking therefore watch and remember that by the space of three years i cease not to warn everyone night and day with tears so paul was warning the church about these men and here's the prophet now he said oh you people don't miss this these impostors impersonators appeared after the true one had went for it first so these guys don't come out when the true one is there they come out after they come to impersonate the devil cannot create anything he's a pervert of the original what is sin russians perverted what's adultery the right act perfected what is a lie the truth represented a perversion a perversion of the original word look at balaam a version of the original word look at zedekiah a perversion of the original word now all these are prophets we're talking about now all these are men so-called men of god now the bible said that these guys would come out after and pervert the original word vindicated and prove to be the truth oh hallelujah do the work of an evangelist still reading from the prophet in that corner yonder make full proof of your ministry for the time will come prophecy when they will not end your song doctrine but after their own lusts shall heap for themselves teachers having itchiness then go ahead and do anything you want to it's all right we got the signs and wonders and shall turn from the truth and be brought into fables or dogmas so this is the word from this prophet these guys and i'll refer to them now going forward as these guys these guys who come out after the original to pervert the original word vindicated and that is why he said the spirit the prophet and the bride will be saying the same thing and what they say will have already been said in the word now what dogma was a dogma he said a dogma is a fixed especially religious belief or set of beliefs that people are expected to accept without any doubts so our minds speak it and they expect people to receive it just like that but don't know doubts because he said you meet an angel he hears something he feels something he had a dream but paul said after my departure false brethren variant of the truth false teachers false ministers lying in wait to deceive and that's what ephesians 4 says these men lying in wait to deceive okay no so that's on the negative side on the positive side the prophet says i said talk about jacob and he saw one fight in the other one is natural one is spiritual he said these men if they pick it up and go out with it they can make more sense to it oh praise god people love that part make more sense to it give an explanation a revelation an interpretation make more sense but he didn't finish there he said these men if they pick it up and go out with it they can make more sense to it see to bring it to a place you would i just want to lay this seed this is the prophet now i just want to lay this seed then hope they make it come to life so it's not men's own seed it's the seed of the son of man that the son of man come to show and he is saying i hope they make it come to life what is the it there that it is the seed that he came to lay oh glory to god because one son of man come he's the sower and the son of man come to sow seed so once he come to sow seed it has to be the same seed from the barnyard of the son of man oh glory to god we can't plant our own seed get our own seed i have a perverted seed a mystery of the seed no it's the same seed oh glory to god hallelujah from the son of man oh praise god hallelujah union court the other statement is used you know and you know in legalese and in legal terminology they try to cover all the grounds so there is no room for ambiguity because if there's a little loophole somebody could slip through and get through and get get off the case and so on so they make sure it will so in legal terminology is something else you know they make sure every gun is covered so they say do you swear to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth you know and i always wonder about that i don't have a detail of why they present it like that i just have a view of it in other words do you tell the fair to tell the truth in other words you're not going to lie right all right you're not going to lie so that's the first part then are you going to tell the whole truth all of it or are you going to flavor it nothing but the truth so it covers all area don't lie tell the whole and don't flavor it okay now the bible talk about the spirit of truth that going to lead you into all truth not just truth but the spirit of truth and the spirit of truth is the person even the holy ghost so it's not just words it's not just words it's the spirit of truth all praise god but if sam said that he's our truth from the inward parts in a man of these three which is to tell the whole the truth the whole truth nothing but the truth to me i say to me the most dangerous one is the second one dealing with the whole truth when you don't get the whole truth listen carefully you can be deceived not by what is said but by what is not said you can be deceived by what is left out amen example a minister will not tell his congregation that he is it i am it i am the best i know more than the rest i am the gods man for the hour no he wouldn't do that just like brahms said nobody will come and say i am jesus and they will just laugh at him see so what he does he will blast other ministers show them inferior to his congregation and then the congregation on their own deducts and concludes he is the only man god can use causing the people to believe a lie oh my and that tizen always won about this sleeve of hands and that is what the magicians use and is the terminology that the use called not distraction but misdirection that's the word that they use a misdirection so they talk and the hands moving sometimes they have a verbal something sometimes they have a smoke and because of a human you look and you see the explosion and they put that as a distraction or to send your mind think a different way that they could do this stuff at the side so you see a ball here all of a sudden i could disappear and the zone is empty a sleigh of hands and that misdirection is sometimes defined as the intentional deflection of attention for the purpose of disguise let me say it again this misdirection is the intentional deflection of attention for the purpose of disguise more precisely successful misdirection might manipulate not only people's perception but their memory of what happened or their reasoning about how the effect was done remind me years ago had something called subliminal seduction in which they had those reel to reel those big real tapes for cinema and somebody get that right idea to put a picture of a coke in between the pictures and it moving so fast that the mind can't see it but it's hidden at the subconscious level all of a sudden people want to drink coke coke coke coke i believe the stop it now is illegal now but all of these is things that they use to play this what they call mind game so it's not just distraction but a misdirection this is distraction is when your audience is too preoccupied to pay attention which is not what you want you want the attention and misdirection specifically means drawing the attention to whatever there is nothing suspicious happening oh blessed be the name of the lord glory hallelujah it come like you don't need the baptism of the holy ghost man might say that why because the seed is in the soul and that's the real thing further because the prophet said you can have the baptism 24 hours a day and still be lost what is left out is where is that baptism if it's on the flesh or if it's on the spirit because peter his seed was in his soul and peter didn't say my seed and my soul i don't need to go in the upper room so be careful not just what you hear but what is being left out what is not being said because peter went up to receive the holy ghost psychology ministers of destruction and misdirection oh my hallelujah come like today some people believe the vaccine is the mark of the beast all right now what it also make them believe without saying it that those who take it have the mark of the beast therefore obviously they have the seal of god but that's not the scriptures there's logic that all those who take the vaccine off they don't have the revelation they they they they catch it they catch a vision two years they are dead and this and that and the enemy is always outside the enemy is always external is rome is the illuminati trilateral council is geopolitical issues that the church is not touching always something on the outside is this pastor is this minister is the devil [Music] enemy is always external my god so the prophet said the new birth is a revelation and because the mr god reveal but he also said the new birth is an experience so if we leave out both and don't bring the balance you lean on one side or the other see so watch flesh and blood has not revealed unto you jesus said upon this rock i'll build my church no christ in you makes him the center of life of the revelation see christ's life in you makes him the center of the revelation christ in the bible makes the bible the complete revelation of christ christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing see what god trying to do what is the new word then you say well brother branham what is the new book it is the revelation of jesus christ personally to you amen not your joint church you shook hand you done something different you said a creed you promised to live by a root of colds but christ the bible he's the word that was revealed to you and no matter what anybody says what take place it is christ pastor priest whatever it might be it is christ in you that is the revelation that the church is built on what revelation christ in you so the new birth is christ is a revelation god has revealed to you this great mystery and that's the new bird now where are you gonna go when you get all that group together where the revelation is perfectly in harmony and god expressing it through his word by the same actions the same thing that he did making the word manifest that's a new book as a revelation oh blessed be the name of the lord now he said the new book is an experience the new book is an experience it's the gift of god it's the seal of faith the holy spirit is a seal ephesians 4 30 grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby you are sealed until the day of your redemption god made the promise to abraham abraham believed god i was justified by faith god given the sign of circumcision as a seal so he does today we believe him then if you say you believe and do not receive the holy spirit then you do not believe course god promised to give you the holy spirit when you did believe no in believing you do not receive the holy spirit when you believe because paul asks in acts 19 have you received the holy ghost since you believe it is the gift of god and when the spirit of god comes into a man it quickens him then he becomes a new creature he receives believes in the immortal god he believes he does all things his heart is tuned with god how wonderful and no matter here we go how much that we try to think we are right insane a creed joining a church you are still what you are until you are actually born again of the spirit of god it doesn't change you your creed joining changing your ideas your good intentions although as good as might seem it's still not right there is something got to happen the word is h-a-p-e-n happen something got to happen the new word is an experience something that takes place so it's not that that brings the new birth oh gloria so it's now the church the different churches they say well you accept this or you believe this it's all right but it isn't oh blessed be the name of it isn't o praise the name of the lord you have to get an experience so the question is which one comes first revelation or experience so jesus after he rules from the dead got his disciples together in private ministry unlock the word to them openly understanding to them and then what happened praise god they were directed to the upper room the worship and the praise god to be under expectation for manifestation after all that word all the mysteries of the old testament being unsealed to them didn't walk up and say we are believers we are message people we right under jesus we under the messiah no he said the promise of my father you have to go in the upper room for that you have to go for dynamics you have to go for the quickening power you have to go for the life that was released at the calvary that day at calvary oh hallelujah in his spirit seven perfect spirits going through all the earth oh hunting those seeds isn't that wonderful today oh blessed be the name of the lord second thessalonians 2 9 11 says even him whose coming is after the working of satan with all power and signs and lying wonders and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish because they receive not the love of the truth that they might be saved for discourse god shall send them strong delusion that they should believe a lie strong delusion and this reminds me of all these false ministers false prophets that prophesy the former guy in america would come back into power and be re-elected and they don't want to accept that he was not re-elected so they have to believe the election was stolen something wrong with the machine something wrong with this somebody changing numbers they have to believe and they're going down the road like that now they cannot believe that spirit that line anointing that fallen 400 prophets fall on all of them to prophesy the same light and they're going down like that and as they go along that different mysteries open up to them because they are giving over to a strong delusion same thing in this message after people reject truth they begin to get revelations angels of light satan disguise bringing information not revelation information completely off the word of god strong delusion oh glory to god my kind of vision and he said what must i do he went into a vision he said go out up i see israel scattered like sheep having no shepherd and that district presbyter walked out and smacked him in the mouth and said where the word of god the spirit of god go when it went out to me and you know what god said he let a devil go down get among them because they were off the word to begin with so when groups passed as ministers churches of the word they are open territory for the devil to come down among them the bible said if they wouldn't believe the word he would give that he would give them a strong delusion to believe a lie and would be dying by it if the people were talking about the baptism of the holy ghost the way they're talking about the vaccine all also the churches fill up with the holy ghost also revival fire burning but the vaccine issue is a destruction and a misdirection of the of the i ain't called the preaching coroner virus i had called to preach on vaccine i ain't called dynamically you know i call the bridge gospel which is the good news oh glory to god hallelujah remember i think it was jeremiah when got a drama 70 years and i come and talked about two years and god tells you tell me tell that man if this number he'll die this year i've taken him out this year for causing the people to believe a lie god tell them plainly whenever they go there i appoint nebuchadnezzar to rule the whole it anybody that stay back and say they ain't going i will punish them i will send plagues i will send pestilence i will i'll do he said all what will happen in other words it was god's will for them to go down to babylon and be under the captivity of nebuchadnezzar that was god's kind of program you tell them up front let your children get married take his wife take husband plant land buy land pray for the government hallelujah because 70 years you're down there oh don't fool yourself and be deceived as two more years is 70 years down there oh hallelujah but the word of the lord can't fail because it was 70 years i daniel saw by books when the time was at hand and daniel began to get desperate because he recognized something about the break please no distraction no misdirection oh no lying we have to come back to the prophet's prophecy oh glory to god just what the prophet said isn't that right hallelujah praise god hallelujah praise be to jesus amen so listen when the word is refused then they are turned to dear desires did you hear that be careful since this is perfectional this is a razor edge it has to be the word or nothing i don't care if the man looking like an angel he pushed it like an angel it has to be the word then the prophet talked about read let's reach thessalonians and he read it and turning down rejecting the truth they would be given over to a reprobate mind and would believe a lie and be damned by it and i begin to see the danger of ministers pastors presenting things to the people that are not true and causing god's people to believe a lie that is problems with god in the amplified talk about the coming of the lawless one second thessalonians too the antichrist is through the activity and working of satan and will be attended by great power with all sorts of pretended miracles and signs and delusive marvels all of them lying wonders and by unlimited seduction to evil and with all wicked deception for those who are perishing go into perdition because they did not welcome the truth but refused to love it that they might be saved therefore god sends upon them a misleading influence a working of error and a strong delusion to make them believe what is false oh blessed be the name of the lord now satan is going to incarnate himself from antichrist to false prophet but in the age here we go after the church goes home after he becomes a beast he becomes the devil incarnate now remember before fire fell in sodom lot came out lot wasn't ruling out umbrella and fire falling you know trying to get out on the fire you know god brought out luck before the first dropper rain fell noah was in the act before russia built the bombs the bride in glory or give the lord some praises hallelujah in the age after the church goes home he becomes a beast he becomes the devil incarnate the red dragon himself can't you see what i mean he is incarnate in his people then he's got his people boned by his power talking about satan here this amazing statement here the false prophet has prophesied them right into it give them over to a strong delusion to believe a lie and be damned by it and he added here denying the word with the form of godliness wow god works his place in a trinity justification sanctification and incarnate himself in his people with the baptism of the holy ghost oh give the lord a shout hallelujah how does god encounter himself in his people justification sanctification and incarnate himself in his people with the baptism of the holy ghost oh glory to god the holy ghost put him in oh hallelujah glory to god the same thing the devil just in time after christ satan incarnates himself when jesus incarnates himself and his people the very life that was in christ is in that person what would you do if you took the life out of a great vine and puts it in a pumpkin vine it wouldn't be a pumpkins no more it will be a grape what if you took the life out of a peach tree and put it you know it wouldn't be appears no it'll be a peaches the life tells what it is and when you hear people say they've got the holy ghost and deny this word there is something wrong and jesus said if a man has my spirit in him he will do my works you want to read that sin john 14 12. do you love him today oh blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah praise god thank you lord so the prophet was given a seed he said the seed of the entire bible is what was given to sow for this dynamic bride revival the entire seed he call it one place the wheat word and i will call you the wheat word bride in other words a bride that has the original seed which is the spoken word now if i bring you words from confucius from lapsam rampa from from from buddha or what not maybe it's nice words and principles but that is not what god said some from socrates that is philosophers but when we hear thus here the lord that comes out god's mouth that is what the seed is the son of man is the soul of the good seed that's why the prophecy say what the tapes say because the spirits speak it expressly on the tapes and on the books that we could have dossier the lord in this very er listen to this prophecy like israel back in the homeland they don't know what got them back there she was automatically put back there why national force put her in her place i'm going to say something national force will put israel in the homeland national force will put the church in the world comes the churches but the power of god will put the people in the bride not you not taking vaccine put your name right that's foolishness this is the word here the power of god not even the ministers could put them in the bride not even the faithful ministry could put them in the bride it will take the power of god because god have an objective to unfold himself to reveal himself he reveals that with christ jesus he had the the preeminences in christ jesus no christ jesus have to have prejudices in a body called the bride and then the third mystery is to take it back to eden or give the lord a shout so if god don't have the preeminences how could we go back to eden let me say it again without the preeminences how are we going back to eden because we have to go to either two preeminences which is the second fold of god's threefold mystery oh my he said the power of god will put the people in the brain in a sense fight any power of god the word talk and more talk mysteries are more teaching and more teaching but they don't want to connect with the power of god doesn't that sound familiar in the last days heady high-minded lovers of pleasures what what what denying the power thereof from such turn away these are the sort that lead silly women lead with diverse loss captives you don't want the power power of god so he said now the word the world forces this way and the world forces that way but god forces upward the spirit of god which is the word of god my word is spirit and life will put the bride in a place cause she will recognize her position in the world then she's in christ will put her in a place no national force will do it now here we go he promised to send you heavenly light to ripen the word seed that would be sown for this day wait a minute brother over there's a word seed to be sown not my seed i supposed to be a eunuch i supposed to be bringing seed from the storehouse word seed to be sown and that word seed must be a revelation of the entire bible and that is why he said if that be so then the seven thunders kept the pyramid so the seven thunders has to be the capstone revelation of jesus christ the seed to make it possible for the bride for god to have the preeminences on the bride oh blessed be the name of the lord do you see it so therefore the seed has to be the seed of the entire bible who knew the bible was a pyramid nobody knew that there was a hidden mystery the prophet took the seven virtues of second peter one four through seven put a pyramid and show it inside of there and say that's god or give the lord a shout nobody could do that we know about this bible but when he put the pyramid and said that is what christ is and that is the mystery that going to be in you what's the mystery christ in you the hope of glory or glory to god warning every man to be perfect in christ jesus oh hallelujah that's not for ministers only there's nothing ministers of fear there's another platinum one card a special card that the minister have because he's behind the pulpit that is there's god in his people his object is to restore his people oh glory to god give the lord a shout oh blessed be the name of the lord so he promised to send heavenly light to do what right the word seed that would be sown for this day and one time he said intellectually hearing a message your fate isn't right you have to lay in presence until it be done so he was prophesying it will take presents to write from seed hallelujah is wanting to get seed but the seed have to be right because you can't bury a green seed because the lord has shout you can't put in the ground green seed the seed has to be ripe mature hallelujah glory to god gold and brown hallelujah by the hot july sun oh get the lord i shall feel inspired this morning oh glory to god before you could go down you have to be ripened hallelujah so he promised to send you heavenly light to write in the word seed that would be sown for this day the seed is here oh give the lord a shout on that one i can hear by the turn shouting the seed is the bible jesus said so so we have no ambiguity about that what the seed is and there's only three bibles right oh glory to god i can't preach zodiac oh glory to god but god preached this one here oh glory and this perimeter is a bible too so once it gets inside of you you have the seed where's the secret the word is in the bride what what is that the seed where that come from son of man he alone is his soul oh glory to god hallelujah paul say one water one sow one water but god give the increase oh glory to god are you with me the seed is the bible why jesus said so the word is the seed that i saw so now before you can have any crop no matter if you sow the seed you've got to have light to ripen that seed or it will rot it won't do no good it will perish but if it's got seed in the ground the right ground with the right kind of sunlight it's got a right gun and he promised in the last days in the evening time the sun will come out the son would come out to righten that seed the seed is being preached all glory to god give the lord shall fear now the seed is being preached say with the tapes say the seed is being preached echo what the prophet said the seed is being preached and the son of god is ripening that seed by vindicating it and making it push out before you proving that's right do you get it oh my and there's the quote i believe the church is beginning to hear the message beginning to understand it but friend listen we have got to lay in the presence of the sun we have got to be ripened presence of the sun is connected to rightening so they have to be presence in the church not the presence of the preacher not the presence of five whole not the presence of the minister the presence of the sun that son is esso and that's jesus he said that when you when the thunders began the manifest he said then you're worshiping the living christ him moving in and out among you oh that's that's not me that's not some man that's that's that's a living christ him moving in and out bringing what presence among the people how god could be presence among the people and there's no worship how god can be present among the people and there's no atmosphere oh glory how god could be present among the people and there was no shout holy the god when jesus was coming on the on the donkey they started they say stop them stop them stop them he said if i stop them the rocks will cry out oh glory to god and when the lamb took the book nobody could tell john behave himself keep quiet john take it easy raise a little hand here raise a little hand there john say all in heaven all under the hood john was breaking through dimensions good i blessed god said blessing and honor straight might and power because the lamb was taking the book and praise god people see the name see what name you see the name in some copy book not the lamb's book when you see your name in the lamb book god raise you above prime ministers presidents kings potentials you are one in a million and you can shout and praise god millions were lost when you were called oh hallelujah and i must not shout you'll have to be crazy oh hallelujah praise god god rich in mercy reach done and pick me up turn me around hallelujah put a song in my show to give them praises hallelujah you are one in a million you have a right to praise them this morning oh look at them they'll deceive people all around the world deceive believe in all kind of foolishness now hallelujah oh my hallelujah praise god thank you lord jesus he said we're hearing the message that god has given us seeing the signs he showed us proving it by the bible but how the church needs needs to lay in his presence till it tenders up tend us up how people so hateful so angry so messed up leave a second fellowship with minister chase god go to church and what the they can't fellowship one another because they messed up and god put the blood of brotherly kindness and put holy spirit right on top of it i love him i love him i love him they cannot pan past that they can't jump over that they carpet knowledge look knowledge quite darkly third step knowledge hallelujah knowledge where they see it is that you die out and produce temperance die out and produce godliness die out because god gave you virtue faith virtue knowledge god has to give that hallelujah but then the seeds have to go in the ground to produce temperance go ahead and give you a temperature you have to die out and give back temperance you had our patience godliness and god is slapping brotherly kindness and you're the you ought to forgive your brother and drop your oaths with the spirit of forgiveness oh my hallelujah oh let's continue here now he said now watch until so the church needs to lay in his presence till it turns up i want to appreciate his comment for giving me an encouragement considering challenging them to challenging all to pray every day at least for one hour it could be one hour straight it could be two half hour period if we go for for 15 minutes that's just the minimum you could go more than that the minimum instead of going in your bathroom with your phone stay out leave the phone out and leave the tablet out and pray praise god pray everywhere lift up holy hands praying pray keep praying oh hallelujah i hope you're applying it you know immediately just don't immediately start to pray make at the end of the day and know you have always on the inside you can't you watch me one hour every single day you're pumping hallelujah you want god to be on your side you want god to be working with you you want god to be directing and guiding you praise god i certainly appreciate all of you making the effort to apply what you're hearing amen so watch out the holy ghost will always point to the word if it points to a creed or denomination it is not the holy ghost it is very simple he said we have this woman to know if a man points into his group or his gift or his ministry we have deserved to know that is wrong he could be a very skillful teacher preacher whatever it is once it's not pointing to christ wrong so watch if it points to a predomination it is not the holy ghost he couldn't do that it points away from his word or when he died to confirm that word and make that word a positive amen so he died watch so he could come himself into the word he is the quickening life that makes the world live again that was his purpose of dying that he could still project himself to his church and make every word through every age act just exactly the way it's supposed to be at he is the dynamics of the mechanics oh glory to god he is the dynamics who i thought man was dynamic mr dynamics no he christ is the dynamics of the mechanics the mechanics of the church what is it apostles prophets teachers and he's the dynamics that works that so he's saying the fifo ministry will be a channel that god going to use to demonstrate his dynamics isn't that something else not fifo ministry is nano press and play on a tape is not what he said he said this here he is the dynamics of the mechanics the mechanics of the church what is it apostles prophet teachers and so forth okay and it's worked by a certain dynamic he is the fire that fires off the gas he's the fire that's in the combustion chamber amen and when the world is poured over that combustion chamber he's the one that sets our fire he's the one that confirms it he's the power of the resurrection oh blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah we see nations breaking israel awakening the signs that this bible foretold for this day we see the mechanical takes things taking place now here we go the spirit the dynamics of that promised word these things you cannot see it different than this the spirit no identifying with spirit the dynamics of the promised world so you have to get out what promise what is it with promise and you know the spirit of that that is that we're talking about you know watch to get into his church where's the purpose to show off no to drive them to calvary under onto the rapture and there we are so the destination is the rapture but we have a stop at calvary before we continue there's got to be the death of a corner wheat hallelujah let me say it again destination rapture but you have a stop that stop is at the cross that's stopping at calvary don't be distracted by ministers of destruction and misdirection they don't know what to preach right now so the enemy is always outside somebody sent me some notes from a minister are you telling people who to hate telling the people who to come against who is the enemy some other truth some some other people and this is where it's so easy to identify the external enemy some people enter me as a husband in the house some people end the music white neighbor family pastor someone else that's something some is always somebody outside room room is the enemy the enemy church room the illuminati biting usa the government depresses the enemy they come in for we really that the enemy seriously my so number one god has to give you a revelation that you are a corn of wheat you are not shocked you are actually god's corn of wheat word wheat wheat wood and when the greeks the scripture you read when they came to jesus the question was sir we will see jesus they didn't access disciples they didn't have to see jesus five-fold ministry it's what jesus wanted to see they came to a member of at that time potential fightful they were just jesus disciples at that time they said we want to see jesus and those disciples correct disciples of this didn't take them in a corner and say here what let me explain them to you because you see we know him long time you know you know um you know i mean we are we are very close you know so um come and have a seat now take a seat now you want anything to drink let me explain my way to you no no these disciples correctly brought these guys to jesus savior said jesus when jesus saw them he said except a corner wait fall into the ground and die it abides alone now the reason i'm speaking about you getting a revelation of you being that corner wheat because when the holy spirit told the prophet pick up on the right he said out of a group of the true seed of the word god will present christ our beloved bride christ will get a beloved bride out of a group of the true seed of the word now the only reason he will say true seed of the word is because there are doors that will be not true seed of the word so first we have to come to true seed because remember the foolish versions are free tinkers the foolish versions are from the same cloth but when the seamstress put the cut to the pattern the pattern is the pyramid what remains is the remnant it's the same cloth but the cloth cut to pattern and that pattern is a pyramid it could be a pyramid bride oh blessed be the name of the lord so who is the greatest enemy rome the devil the vaccine who's the enemy you know he's so funny all the time people die in the corner virus they say we need a vaccine again when the vaccine comes vaccine come now they say the vaccine is a problem no no is the vaccine the problem it's not it no longer who's the enemy there could be lies by omissions as we say deceived by what is left out deceived by what you don't know deceived because you chose to be ignorant lazy by not studying the word yourself just trusting the man behind the pulpit instead of examining things by the word when jesus came on earth it's like a sunday school teaching this morning the three wise man bought three gifts identifying him goal frankincense and my not two three each walking with the revelation that god give them nobody looking over and say hey your goal i should have been gold you know no that's not how it worked there were three wise men each had their revelation of what they wanted to bring to the messiah first one laid on goal second one laid on frankincense the last one padang and it was taught us that those three gifts identify goal as god frankincense a service and more for debt and given a message god in service to die i want you to see jesus today a little different not just jesus walk through galilee but understand his purpose was to die and that debt was to pay the price of our redemption that we could get access to eden and return back to where we fell from there's only one way to do that was to pay the price the cost of adam failing and falling that was the objective so all jesus ministry turning water into wine feeding the multitude they were like side shows calling this one calling that one all those were just side stuff his main purpose was to go to calvary his main purpose was to go to the cross and that's why he said my hour is now come my soul is heavy hallelujah he cannot dock it he cannot avoid it he gone into the garden of gethsemane there is where the land and the tribe of judah prevailed if it is possible that this could pass but here am i i have to do it i must do it if i don't the spirit will not be released oh glory to god because the life is in the blood all glory and the blood cell has to be broken so when he died the spirit was released that is why we are here today that is why we are in church that is why in your home hearing the word because the spirit released from you you didn't find him oh glory to god he found you give the lord a shout you did not find him he found you he said you have not chosen me but i have chosen you i know being you that you bring for fruit paul ii corinthians 4 7-12 he said we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of god and not of us we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed always bearing about in the body the dying of the lord jesus that the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our body for we which live are always delivered unto debt for jesus sake that the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh so then here we go debt worker in us but life in you death work it in us fight for ministry but life in you the bride you were saying that clearly it takes debt to work in us for life to work in you as we die life could flow as we die word could turn to spirit as we die why periods pick these words the holy ghost fell among them that heard the word this is the prophet you find christ only in debt not in a manger not in a confession to believe a certain creed fables you don't find christ dear oh my you see he pointing them to the presence of christ he said except economy falls and abides alone abides alone he says watch it will bring forth watch i'll just read a little bit here he said no except economy falls it that buys a loan now if he did not die would have to abide alone himself if he did not die talk about christ but him being the corner we that fell into the ground and then if it falls into the ground he said it would bring forth an abundance if it falls into the ground and dies first it has to be a germanic seed or bring forth nothing but it has to be have life in it here we go before it can fall into the ground and he had eternal life in him because he was immanuel and he had to give his own life in order to bring forth life again now like the wheat you say how could one grain of wheat here's what happens one grain falls it brings forth a hundred grains a hundred grain falls it brings out a thousand grains a thousand grain falls it brings what million green a million grit falls in a badge load and on and on till it feeds the whole world that is what he meant if i live my life alone and die this way i just live my life alone well then there'll be no food after me but if i fall into the ground under the will of god i'll bring forth a new birth this is jesus now if i fall in the ground under the will of god i'll bring forth a new bird and in that new bird it will bring forth another new bird and another bird until the whole world will be missionaried this gospel must be preached in all the world for witness unto me these signs shall fund them believe so if we in ourselves then in our ministry in our torch in our life if we abide as we are we can do no good that is today that is right now he's not talking about sinners he's not talking about people on the outside he's talking about truth folks he's talking about ministers he's talking about me he's talking about you he's talking about all of us if we ourselves then in our ministry in our thoughts in our life if we abide as we are we can do no good we have got to also die at the altar or we would live alone we would live to some denomination or some creed we would lift to some organization but if we die to ourselves then the holy spirit will be spread forth everywhere by our lips hallelujah glory to god what was peter peter was in the body he didn't want to go to the gentile house of cornelius but god sent him there god sent for peter to go to paulinha's house to show him something that god don't respect her persons and peter was just testifying and why peter speak these words why we can't hear that again only talk and talk and more talk why peter yet speak these words the holy ghost fell upon them the explanation behind that peter was in the body and he had the germ inside of him full germ that it could be released out of his lips and he's promised the sons of god in last days i will have the germ of god you have to send for them to release jim fulgum how you can have full german you don't have all them seven voters inside is the whole pyramid had to be inside to reproduce christ again fulgym oh hallelujah if we die to ourselves then the holy spirit will be spread forward everywhere by our lips we have got to die that is thus saith the lord we have got to die so many today so it is now we must realize we have got to die in order to bring forth new life praise god what a message certainly appreciate what brother isaac brought a new thing a new season a new time is upon us in order to bring forth he said if you want to see me you must die this is brother branham bringing it out what jesus was telling them they came to me jesus you said i am jesus oh a seat it's so nice you want to see me here am i no they couldn't see him that way if you want to see me go to calvary if you want to see me you got to die to how you feel how you think your dreams your stories you have to die if you want to see me die to yourself and then you will bring forth a new life now if you want to see him if you ever expect to see him you will never see him by joining the church some book of laws and you keep some creed that you serve is so dangerous when these ministers present to the people that because they are in that group that they are the bride that's a lionel that's a huge lion that is not true hallelujah you have to meet god's requirement to be part of this body you have to be magnetized to the headstone oh my brother branham you will see him when you die when you come to calvary and are crucified to yourself then you will see jesus first before he said anything he pointed them to the place to find him like all gentiles all people you find jesus at the cross where you are crucified with him today we try to find him in everything we try to find him in church building try to find him any nomination try to find him say in some creed we try to find him by keeping certain days by obeying certain rituals but we cannot find till we come to calvary until we are crucified fall to the dust of the earth die to ourselves and reborn again then we fight jesus so many try to hold their own maintain their own ideas i've got my way of it i believe this but you cannot find christ until you die to yourself and accept him the word then you find life oh my so when a man gave you a green glasses you must see everything green you clear paper glasses everything purple take off that paper glasses and get that clear one all i want to see is the word hallelujah praise the name of the lord you love him let's go there he was christ he was the word god word made manifest and he died in order to pay the debt of our high breeding now there it is what is it that you could die to yourself until you are no more yourself and be filled with his word believe in his word and then the holy spirit was in him comes down to water that word to make it grow and then what is it god manifesting continuing the work of his first son his only begotten see then he died for our hybrid life that he might reconcile us back to be sons and daughters of god and true the church might flow the same life by the word continuing the work being manifested as it was in christ christ was god's word made manifest and he died give his life that he might send the spirit that's the purpose take his body up send the spirit back to water pay the redeeming price if we will believe it that is right there if you would believe it he said believe it on me the works that i do then come the holy spirit upon the same word you say where do you throw it upon the bible then the bible has got to be in you oh glory to god the bible has got to be in you which will be full truth or all truth oh glory to god in seed form in word form watch the word is a seed as long as it's laying here it won't do no good but when it comes in here when it comes into the heart then it begins to manifest by the holy spirit the works of god then visions come here we go powers come here we go humility comes all you'll know it all it's gone you become nothing christ becomes alive you die he lives there it is cause he die i live when i die he lives again so when i die he promised me to life and i died all to myself so in order i can have his life how do we do it by taking his word his seat put a seat in here by fate and believe it and it produces exactly what the bible said all you know it all is gone you know some people ask them a question they have all the answers i say i don't know i don't have all the answers you have to know when you have your answers and when you drop the answers you bluff your way through say anything to to give an answer you don't know you don't know i don't know certain days i don't know i really don't know all you know it all is gone so you're not trying to know it all humility comes powers comes vision comes do you love him no oh my they were good people they were fine people but not all that say lord lord but the one that do it the will of my father not here that starts is he that finishes there are no shortcuts you are disqualified at the end of the race that is scary though that is really really scary to be disqualified at the end of the race no shortcuts you must come the way of the scripture said repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost there is no shortcut shaken hand joining church or the nomination you come that way except here we go are you ready so this has nothing to do with i believe there's seven thunders i believe in union mystery i believe this mystery that mystery i believe all seven series i believe abraham tabernacle i believe voice of god i believe where they believe i believe this church i believe brother that's not it you know except you die to yourself and be born of the spirit of god you are lost that's all there are no shortcuts church do you get it you're in your home right now listening are you do you get it that there are no shortcuts don't look for shortcuts cuts tonight they're all there today and they're going on tomorrow they want to preach pentecostal people letting them do that hallelujah all i've got to do is to get down there and don't think nothing at all and say hallelujah hallelujah i got elijah's garment i'm going out tomorrow to castle devils he says he said there is no shortcuts you come the way of calvary you come the way of the brass altar you come the way of the prison serpent you die you actually die you say oh god why can't i see it right you die literally die to yourself why this is not the emphasis why are they both i ain't taking a vaccine as if that's a testimony or somebody get covered and they're dead so they're good they come true that means you have to seal it up any people not even christian come to cover it they know testimony these are people unbelievers got sick and they come true and the final that's a witness don't be caught up in mind games don't be fooled i want you to stay focused as the prophet told branham tabernacle do you get it except the token be displayed you cut out the token not applied you know displayed not applied to get the display yet applied first but he's talking about a reproducing of the original life oh hallelujah you actually die he's oh god why can't i say it right literally die to yourself you die to the things of the world and are born on you know the things of the world there's no shortcuts see people are told out on the west coast oh we got immortal baptism we baptize you in water you turn right back to a young man right there a young woman they got elijah garment they got manifested sons of god brother god is getting manifest zones right now manifesting telling them about this tonight you are sinner tomorrow your manifestation of god nonsense he said nonsense where you get that in the word babies are not born men they are born babies and grow to men so he was saying all of this come to the growth process oh my hallelujah so friends again no more misdirection no more distraction it's not the past is the issue the l is the issue the church is the issue look again what the real issue is job righteous man he's one of the characters i want to look at quickly job a righteous man when god began to put the heat on joe because there were issues that job wasn't even aware of but isaac brought out in that bible study about job at the end then he was a more righteous man because he came through process and one of the things that was interesting though is how job under the heat tell god why don't you check them fellas outside why doesn't he send a man outside why are you checking why you interfere with me and i believe you why are you in the fair with me and i'm a righteous man why am i going through the stuff i'm going through and i'm serving you with all my heart i'm doing what is right it's not fear job started hated he was born and better this and you know the story okay but in job 42 job said and this is the amplified i have heard of you only by the hearing of the ear but now my spiritual eye sees you therefore i loathe my words and abhor myself and repent in dust and ashes and job that would abhor is to regard with disgust and hatred hallelujah oh glory to god thank you jesus job came to the where spot abhorred himself an abhorrence of good self he wasn't talking about adulterous job fornicating job stealing job kidnapper job he wasn't talking about that kind of behavior because that is not really christian behavior so he wasn't talking about bad self it came to the point where he was so stripped that he recognized his good self neither died he hated his good self oh blessed be the name of the lord blessed could we see ourselves coming to that spot how could the self-righteous in church the self-righteous in the message come to job 42 to say i hate myself when people think because their dress is longer than somebody else they're a little near the kingdom somebody just covered their knees but their own dog to their uncle and they feel everybody supposed to wear their owner the uncle hallelujah when the judge utters by dear measuring word my god isn't tristan or god tell them stop listening to your prophets your your prophet is not god professional you call them your prophets prophesying lies hallelujah so here we go now job came to that spot because there was issues that god had to sort job out with to make him a more righteous man and the other character that i saw was in jonah jonah chapter four this please jonah exceedingly he was very angry very angry about after bringing a message for the people to repent the people repent and join us still upset because he have an issue with with how god has operated he tell god he prayed unto the lord and said i prayed your lord was not this my saying when i was yet in my country therefore i fled before unto tashish for i knew that what a gracious god merciful slaughter anger of great kindness and repentancy of the evil therefore now o lord take i beseech my life from me for it is better for me to die than to live all because a bunch of people he didn't repent and he could fight he didn't want them forgive him he didn't want them to repent he know god is merciful he know god is so that way he head down the dashes fled to touches because he's no doubt gracious god merciful he's totally anger so god you know that you have a messenger boy and you come to see the message and you're hoping they repent you're hoping they make things right so long you have it for them you want to see them fall you want to see them mash up my god therefore take my life take my life for it's better for me to die than to live then said god lord does though does though well to be angry oh my hallelujah i'm going to the street no job you know it's interesting when she was in the daily wheel the belly the fish job when joe recognized is another job jonah rather said when jonah recognized his first she cried lord god he looked to his temple and he cried out for deliverance the fish spit him out right in front where he's supposed to be the nervous but you know his heart still have a condition in it you know he still have a heart that them people shouldn't repent god shouldn't forgive them you still have a heart you know god the baptist the heart is desperately wicked who can know it but god who could really know the heart but god people sitting down saying amen glory hallelujah and god alone know what's sitting inside that heart there god come and cleanse come and purge okay so let's strike the message now sorry oh thank you lord so god loved fatherhood he wanted to express himself and it was the father who became son son of man rabbi jesus keeps saying son of man he wanted to express himself that what he was one of his great truthful purposes was to express himself identify himself as human beings to reveal himself in christ secondly here we go and this is what we're emphasizing this morning to have the preeminences in his body of believers shout out home in your house wherever you are body of believers to have the preeminences in the fightful ministry no not only the minister supposed to have the preeminences god have there but in the body of believer that is his bride that he might live in people now he could do that in adam and eve but sin separated him right so god's purpose why didn't he just keep adam and eve like that then he would never be able to express his fullness his full attribute see so he was that he wanted to be a savior he wanted to be a healer and so on like that right we understand that no he said no when i see god's great purpose revealing himself and having first revealed himself in christ the fullness of the goddess bodily and then to bring the fullness of the goddess bodily into a people that he could have the preeminences the oversight the leading and from here brother branham dropped into a channel to go back to this message he preached i preached on one night a prisoner of jesus christ paul a prisoner when god gets you to be his prisoner then you can't do nothing but what the spirit says do paul with all of his great intellect he was taught by gamaliel to be a great priest or rabbi someday and he had high ambitions he was intellectually a great man great authority great man in the nation but he had to sacrifice every bit of it to become part of the word to express jesus christ he had a notion to go over some place some virgin would call him and he was forbidden by the spirit here we go to do his own will if people have spiritual can pick that up he was forbidden to do his own will he said the spirit forbid me he was the prisoner of christ now i believe the prophet dropped that prison of christ to give a little insight as to what this preeminences would look like when it is in effect then he said this here if god can get him prisoners like that that is when he can express the preeminences you see he's got the man or the person he knows nothing about christ i don't know if you'll remember when i read it when i read about sin john 15 7 if he abided me and my words in you sitting on 15 every tree that every branch of me that doesn't bring food food got cut off and if you bring forth food he pruned it to bring forth more fruit here and is my father glorified bring forth much fruit and i keep saying the devil is not in the picture so what we're talking about here this second full of god threefold mystery let me say it a good the devil is not in the picture rome is not in the picture the illuminati trilateral council the vaccine is not in the picture here this is what god promised to do have the preeminences no destruction if god can get in prisons like that so number one first to express himself completely god in christ so he had to come back in this age to express by all the word all the mysteries all what was lost since in genesis the serpent gardener eden right on up all the mysteries the fullness of the word to be revealed he called it the time and after the prophet died we had to endure all these years making a bright history and we call it the time of the revelation of these things being made known so there's a time of revelation and there's a time of manifestation okay so number one he first had to express himself completely god in christ second to have the preeminences by this in his church which is his body the bride so he could have the preeminences to express himself and thirdly to restore the kingdom to his right position that fell by sin by adam oh hallelujah are you with me this morning so what's his purpose now express himself in a son that in him might dwell the fullness of the goddess bodily then i've got colossians laying here now through his life through this life of this son his cross the blood it says here of his cross he might reconcile to himself a body a bride which is second eve and give it in type like he did moses on all of them the same thing he did in adam and eve given in type christ and the bride oh blessed be the name of the lord so what happened in the pre-figure now he opened adam's side and took part of his flesh which was adam to make eve the brain has to be the word for he is the word she cannot stand on a creed she cannot stand on denomination here we go she cannot stand on good behavior she has to stand alone on the word because she is part of it and she was taken from christ and to be sure that the whole rapture now here we go rapture the rapture luther was apart he was apart the prophet was apart just in the revelation that they were making up the body feet toes arms and so forth until the head which you will get in a few minutes that makes the entire rapture it's the body of the word which is christ so the prophet went down to the prophets to the churches all of that making up the rapture that is the body being formed so luther pat makes up already wesley pat mega were ready penny already it's no the weak word bride that's the final part then he said this year outside of that you are lost i don't care how good you are what your relationships what your fellowship is what your organization is you are lost outside of that word being in you not where you go to church not where you go to church not who your pastor is it got to be the word living because enoch walked with god and was not for god took him he had to take his wife he walked with god i don't know about his wife but he walked with god and his mechanics became dynamics and he was taken from the earth oh blessed be in the lord watch if you abide in me i would abide in you then you can ask what you will and you and the word are the same he has the preeminences oh gloria god hallelujah i want you to see that this morning look where you put the preeminence is if you abandon me my word are bad in you then you ask what you will because you and the world are the same he has the preeminences he's got the rulership you are prisoner to him the world is dead are you getting that insight now or what this preambus looked like so what put up on a rapture and there's no pre-eminences get up on the rapture and the bright hair hit the tapstone yet we don't want to rapture no press come down press up and stay right there press hard to chill until the bride come into action press how to wait like sun stancil press have to wait it's not press coming down i'll be looking for power per second for nothing they will come in to see how much books and tips we have in them then that's how it was in the book of acts and tight but ram says when this had a shout out and sucker like junk man they wouldn't move is it the dancing this is emotional these pentecostals they speak it in tongues and they stuck it in a like junk man you see definitely that you know you know when he divorced had to do something when peter said self and gold have i none such as i had given to you stand up rise up and walk and they might stop and walked he said he devils get up and say now we had to stop this that way to stop here something books and tips he instantly needs regular choices right now oh hallelujah so what all them churches who close already bright think about it now had churches all around the world lose them who don't have no service because our virus god set it up that way you think god didn't know that was coming the first prophet couldn't then prophesy couldn't probably say nothing considering this but this was always coming all this is rehearsal what are we doing we're not backing now we're still drawing sword we're still pumping this word because this word can fail glory to god hallelujah i like how dennis i read my books what the prophet jeremiah said hallelujah that guy was going back and he quotes from jeremiah i said 70 years i recognized two more years left for drama to start hallelujah o pray is gone so i hope this morning that you have been edified and this is helping you praise god as a taste of what this preeminences is looking like okay abiding amen the life listen we are not born surrendered we are not born yielded that's why he said make yourself a christian let your clothes be back in that knee and then always get done in prayer make yourself a christian holly you're not born a christian as many as receive him that them give a power to become is that instant it's up to you he says god will make halfway preachers but preachers could be halfway that's why if we stand alone we we die we just we alone but accept a corner falling along and die we have no further to go we'll just be grinding and going and and hitting other churches hitting other ministers as if that given us power and it's easy to do that the external enemy is the easy one blame blame blame excuses but it's also a sign of immaturity because maturity is when you accept responsibility for your actions your words your attitudes deal with it is all about you now we could do this layer of hand stuff you know as i said see imagine my ball here all of a sudden you see it here and you disappear and you see the ball appear here and all you do is little things you know and when you're looking so because you just pass it past so quick there's no magic it's tricks oh hallelujah so we're not here for tricks you are prisoner to him the will is dead praise god so let's continue unto that purple okay so g what was jesus manifested for one to show god he was god he had to be no man could die no prophet could die he was god he was god of the prophets he was the prophet he was the kings he was the history he was he that was to come he that was and he that is he that is and he is to be in this day the same yesterdays and favor he was manifested for that purpose and though that purpose and through that purpose you achieve a church that he the fullness of god might bring to pass every promised word of god in his last name when he gets the preeminences did you hear that let me say it again and through that purpose he achieved a church that he the fullness of god might bring to pass every promised word of god in these last days when he gets the preeminences in the church the position his place in the church jesus said he that believes on me the work that you shall do also even more than this shall you do for i go to my father see that was the purpose when he get what the preeminences that he could do the same work same manifestation so you see jesus so seen it he was so perfectly born for the day until god expressed every move that he made he was god's revelation god revealed now he's sanctified with his spirit and blood a church that he might make every promise in this last day be revealed now you see that word reveal if you don't watch it it might just think that it's just unfolding word but reveal these two things it can reveal by word or revelation or it could be revealed by manifestation isn't that right because god is the word but the word become flesh and that become flesh was jesus christ all right so watch he said notice he would go back and pick up all these other fellows that left off here in his last days and by his holy spirit reveal all the mystery of the seven seals see he's expressing himself for that purpose why he died that's the second fall of the truthful manifestation oh my hallelujah so we're gonna stretch here now listen close no other church no other sign let me back up a little bit he said listen close close now i do not want you to fail to get this brother branham there's some crazy mission of god reveal no other church no other sign no other fellowship no other government no other testimony no other creed no denomination is accepted outside of this god accepts nothing else but christ in you the hope of glory this is heavy the only thing that god recognizes no fellowship will i in this church in this group no church no creed no denomination everything else is dead it is fragments that has to be cut off pruned away from the thing that christ might live with the preeminences in you hallelujah because the preeminences means that we are formed into the word image because every virtue gives them more room to have the preeminences he said to take the blood of a man out and you're bringing the blood of jesus in and it brings in what the fate of jesus the virtue of jesus knowledge of jesus temperance of jesus patience of jesus brother kindness godliness brotherly christ of jesus and charity which is jesus the love of god isn't that right oh glory to god so once we begin to see the second fall of god's threefold mystery in effect then we know we're on our way to eden because eden means the third full but the second fold must be manifest which is christ having the premises so first god have the prior medicine in christ isn't that right christ have the preeminence and the bride hallelujah to bring her back into our ethnic condition which is adoption before going back to eden because adam had the command let us make man and let us have dominion adam had dominion over everything is on the earth isn't that right adam was a god man of the earth before we go back to eden that god man anointing that dominion anointing have to come back upon the sons of adam oh glory to god hallelujah of upon adam's fallen race it must come back because we have the evidence of the book restored the book the devil couldn't get his hands on which is the book of authority or the title leader of the earth of the inheritance satan couldn't get it so he is squatting on this earth isn't that something else oh blessed be the name of the lord o glory to god so the holy ghost is god the holy ghost is what is god god's life in you peter was believing unto eating a life but when the holy ghost came down in the upper room he had eternal life he had resident power not temporary power isn't that right oh blessed be the name of the lord glory to god hallelujah god want to reveal himself isn't that right he did that by the word by seven seals and by the spirit elohim spirit and elohim spirit oh glory to god to go after logos word logos word is a seed full seed full bible and you the brain and the bride have to receive these virtues by voices seven voices to seven ages god put the thunders inside of there that we could be forming to the word image a image have to be formed in you and i if you read the bible i believe revelation 13 life was given to the image and to the beast and if the beasts have an image and life have to come into the image to empower the image the bright have an image the image is christ hallelujah the word the pyramid and life have to come in that image which is charity life isn't that right glory to god so he said that the word living is the bride's identification that's the bright identical to church not who your pastor is but the word living that's the bride identification praise the name of the lord so this this preeminences will display the token of god hallelujah all of this connected together the token the preeminences the works the fruit the life is all coming together all right let's hit the stretch here now but when christ jesus was being formed in mary that is when the persecution set in that is when her persecution started and it's the same thing so look at the prophet now he's going into the word now this is not devil thing and everything this is christ being formed in mary so he's switching out the galatians when christ the hope of glory is formed in you then you're going deeper christ is being formed in you when when you are dying and christ is coming to life watch the persecution setting watch trouble saturn every hand watch the devil go on a rampage when christ is being formed in you or give the lord a shout and the mystery is christ in you the hope of glory so wait a minute you mean christ have to come into life yes because the wood is a seed lifeless inside of there he described the uproam experience as dry seeds hauled themselves up into the upper room waiting for water waiting for the rain waiting for their seed to come to life and when the day of pentecost was fully come we know the story let's continue here when christ was being formed in mary quickly come the king's commandment all the people just as she was about to become in full baby ready to be delivered right there come the great persecution no here we go the baby has been formed a long time in the womb but this is coming the last days when the completeness when the fullness of the godhead when the fullness of christ is to be manifested among his people he said so stop rewind did he say that when the fullness of the godhead when the fullness of christ is to be manifested among his people he said so he promised it by the word when that fullness prophecy you see there is an unusual thing begin to happen that he promised that's the reason our social lives and things can't understand it it is foolishness to them now watch they're forming a conquest of churches prophecy just the time when the church is begin to get to its feet where the supernatural is beginning to work now they all went into the group and now they're going to try to stop this stuff so he's showing you the power behind the conquest churches will be activated when the church begin to get to it feet where the supernatural begins to work because when god was raising up ramses god was raising up his moses what could we give the lord my praises so why are they raising up welcomes our churches to come against the bride go raise them a bride that's gonna be a super church come on now a super race come on now actually near the headstone oh blessed be the name of the lord the prophet but in obedience this little faith woman that lives by faith the bride talking about you out there you hear the person here there off somewhere he said watch whatever it is believes the word of god obedient waiting in love for the promise of the age to be confirmed she is watching fit the bride she is part of that word and she is watching for her life to manifest that word brethren can't you see that i hope that didn't go over you the body right buddy is waiting for which is the word waiting for this life which is the spirit to confirm or make it alive that is what she's waiting for mission comma please that is what she's waiting for know that life will work in her she can't come to life any other way yet she feels it out there she knows it's going to happen and this happens then she wakes up oh blessed beating of the lord now the spirits speak expressly that in a lot of time they will depart from the fate and would give heed to seducing spirits you know what that uses a seducing spirit in the church that is clergy so this this this word here is is ministry people ministers he's a seducing spirit in the church that is clergy seducing clergy spirit identified working of devils hypocrisies in the church high-minded heavy high-minded wisdom you see smart intelligent having a form of godliness just go and say well we are christians you know we go to church having a form of godliness denying the revelations the power and the working of the spirit from such generally notice he said for this is the sort that will go from house to house with leads silly women that don't mean holy ghost woman silly woman led away with divers loss divers lost they just like to get in every little things that they could get into what kind of societies whatever they want to isn't that right he said men of reprobate mind concerning truth what is truth the word which is christ oh my i think this is the last school that i have here you have a lovely audience hallelujah praise the lord hallelujah praise god what is the greatest enemy room the vaccine illuminati the government god spoke to paul he said paul my strength has been perfect in your weakness then paul said when i am weak then i'm strong yes well i will glory in my infirmities of my weakness and so forth i'm thanking god that i got all of it out of me and when i get everything out of me then god can come in as long as i got some of myself there then god can't get in he said we drive him away from the poorest of us to the riches of us from the least to the greatest we keep god out of our lives because of our own selves let me say it again from the poorest of us the richest of us from the least to the greatest we keep god out of our lives because of our own selves i've often said the greatest enemy i've got in william branham so who's the greatest enemy room no the greatest enemy i got is william branham he's the one that gets in god's way he's the one that gets lazy he's the one that gets to a place sometimes where he thinks he can do something about it when he does shows god right outer picture but when i could get rid of that guy when i could get to a place that he is out of the way then god can come over and do things that william branham knows nothing about that's when god can use you and when he can use any of you that's when he can use any of you he can use anybody when he can get out of the way as long as we get ourselves in the way then he got because hallelujah [Music] glory yes lord [Music] hallelujah yes there's power oh glory to god heavenly father i pray jesus that your power would oh god flow out to the audience heal those that are sick raise them up lord by revelation and inspiration to know that they are called lord to have that you might have the preeminences in

all glory to god the life of the messiah manifested making a bride ready our church help us dear god as we face lord this this this test in time and jesus when he was confronted with it he said if
