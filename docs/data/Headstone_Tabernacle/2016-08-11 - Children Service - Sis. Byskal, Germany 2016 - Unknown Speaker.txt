I'm amazed about your love and as we go in the first part of the service I think we all agree this is a great privilege and honor for us to hear our sister bisc share her testimony of how she met the prophet and what the prophet told her and now we can see what God has done in her life and how God blessed them together and we're under expectation and as we invite her to come with her daughter she will share her testimony and we thank God for that it's all about God's love for us and that's why we sing the song I'm amazed about your love I am amazed that you love me I'm amazed by your grace through your precious love I found pardon and my sins they're washed they're all washed away all of my sins are washed away I'm amazed I'm amazed Jesus that you love me I'm amazed how you care Through Your Precious Blood I found pardon and all of my sins are washed they're all washed away all of my sins there was a you may be seated sister bll God bless you thank you I was asked to speak to the children today so anything any of my comments are going to be direct to them and the adults can listen in so the little children I'm so happy to see them all I just uh love them I adore them um I have 26 or 27 great grandchildren the oldest is 15 so you know how I love the little children so I just want to give you a little bit of my background and I've already already been instructed to speak slowly for the sake of the uh translators at the back and um so I'll give you a little bit of my background uh I was born in a very small town in Northern British Columbia Canada and in the wilderness practically and I was about 700 kilomet from the nearest small City by Gravel Road and um my father was a businessman and I was growing up with everything I needed he was well to do he had a large department store and uh uh I had everything I wanted and I wanted nothing and um when I was about four years old I heard the name of Jesus for the first time my parents were not Christians and the first song I remember was the great physician and when I heard that name the sweetest name on Mortal tongue I never forgot it Jesus Precious Jesus I was so little but I I remember it Jesus Precious Jesus and right across from my father's store was a little gospel church and because I was the youngest in the family and my brother and sister were much older than I I was allowed to pretty much do what I wanted and I started to go to Sunday school when I was about six and from then on I I joined myself to that pastor's children and I I learned the scriptures I learned the Sunday school songs there I I lived in that church pretty much with that family back and forth and from a very small child I learned every gospel song I could every little Sunday school song I could and to this day I remember the Psalms that I memorized and I want to say to you little children learn as much scripture as you can as soon as you can it will hold you through life I remember standing in the church as just a very young girl and saying Thy word have I hid in my heart that I might not sin against thee I didn't really know what it meant but it held me through my young years and the word the scripture let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in my thy sight oh Lord my strength and my redeemer I those words still echo in my heart and mind to this day let thy words be a meditation in my heart and may they be pleasing to thee Oh Lord and I say to the parents even though my parents didn't teach me any of that yet I loved the word of God and it held me and one day when I was 13 years old in 1949 it was the fall of the year in September a man came to hunt and he came through Dawson Creek at the in in invitation of some of the farmers and ranchers I don't know how he got there it was a long distance I don't know maybe he came partway by plane uh the roads were were terrible uh but he he came through and he was asked to speak one night at the little Gospel Church I'd never heard his name there were only about 50 people in the church and of course I was there sitting in the back row and when he finished speaking I moved out the back double doors and uh I people hung their clothes there in the little part of the church at the back and as the doors opened I I stood behind the door out of the way as people began to move out and I wanted to stay out of the way and so I got right behind the door and I just stood there and then this man walked out with the crowd he was shaking hands it was brother Bram I didn't know who he was and as he moved out with the crowd he stopped looked behind the door saw me standing there took my hand and it was a scripture he said to me and he said little sister God bless you if you will commit your way unto the Lord he'll give you the desires of your heart at that moment I something just enfolded me in the sweetest presence I knew that I had been touched by something Supernatural a voice from from the eternities and I wept I stood there behind the door weeping brother Brandon moved on out I didn't know who he was what it was I just knew that I had been enfolded in something from eternity that I had never experienced in my life and I stood there weeping while everybody left and went out and I've never forgotten that moment and I I am so thankful for that encounter and as I grew up I wanted nothing of the world I had every opportunity that I could have possibly been given um I had I had many friends in school they did things that I didn't want to be a part of of course there was a a young boy that came to the church every once in a while because he was in this home and that home and had no home actually and that was brother Ed and I I liked him and somebody said to me the pastor's daughter actually I was 10 years old and one day she said to me Ruth do you like Eddie he likes you and I wasn't the least bit interested in any boy at that time my whole life was was cats kittens dogs horses you know anything to do with the farm and he wasn't interested in any any girls either so but that was from that moment on our lives did become entwined through because of the gospel and our interest in things relating to spiritual things and I became very interested in in skating I I would skate in Winter carnivals and uh because we lived in the north uh it was cold so six month of winter I spent on the ice and uh one day the Pastor said to me Ruth is this something that a Christian girl should be doing and just that one word caused me to drop it right there I never went back to that entertainment again from that moment something in my heart it was I don't understand it I never struggled with those things again it just it dropped I had no interest in those things and even the the movies or anything like that I just I had no interest in it it just seemed like my interest was towards God and I I look back at that moment when brother brandham said if you'll commit your way unto the Lord he'll give you the desires of your heart and as the years went on I realized my desire was for the Lord that's what I desired it wasn't the desires for things or it was for him my desire was for for him and I had a a stubborn streak but my stubborn streak was no one is going to make me do something that is going to displease the Lord and I I'm very thankful for that and um when brother Bram began to have a contact with my husband uh that brought me into contact with him as well um and he would come up north to go hunting at various times and um one time in the spring he had come up and was hunting with my husband husband and uh he had they had gotten a a bear on one hunt and they were coming back to Dawson Creek and I was staying with my sister and uh our girls were young I think Linda was about N9 or 10 the oldest girl and we were waiting for them to come and uh they arrived and dropped the the bear hide off at my sister's house and then as we stood just at the side of the street the girls began to sing for him and they could sing some of the Native Canadian Indian songs so I believe they sang couple of songs in the native Indian language and uh I think he took off his hat he said um now we've uh had the song service and now we'll take up the offering and he reached in his pocket and put a few coins in there and gave them to the girls and he said you know now you can buy yourself some ice cream or chocolate bars or something we've had the song service now here's the offering and they remember that very clearly um not long after that um we were living in southern British Columbia in Victoria we were getting ready for brother brandham to come to port alurn and Victoria for meetings and by this time um my husband was not welcome in the undenominational churches so as we prepared for the meetings we were doing it by our ourselves all the advertising all the preparation of whatever building we were going to have and uh just before that my father who was about 64 years old had a very severe heart attack in Dawson Creek and um the main artery of his heart ruptured out and his doctor called my husband and said I think you'd better send Ruth up he's not going to live through this and so I I went up to Dawson Creek it's about um a th000 kilometers I'd say and I was allowed to stand by his bed for 10 minutes the day not speak to him but just stand there and I was there for a few days then I had to go back to Victoria because of the preparation for the meetings and I was terribly burdened for him heavy-hearted and then we began to prepare for the meetings and besides bearing the load of the advertising the the building and all those things my heart was so heavy I wanted while we waited for brother brandom to come and he came and he was in a motel and I wanted so desperately to speak to him ask him tell him about my father ask him if he would pray but there was no opportunity he he was waiting on God in the motel and then he'd come to the meeting and I was playing the piano and and then he'd leave the the platform and go back to the motel and it was just every day like that and I was just longing and and then we went to Victoria and carried on with the meetings there and and there was no help from anyone none of the churches in fact for Victoria the Anglican Church of Canada gave us one of their organists who came came forward and played the organ for the meetings if you can imagine not even a Christian or a Believer she came forward to play the organ and um so then after those meetings were over and uh we were at the motel outside and brother brandom was talking to my husband and just saying the departing words it's been wonderful to be here we're thankful for what the Lord has done and maybe we'll see you again and we're just they were just saying a few parting words I was standing about this far to there quietly just under the lights of the motel and brother brandom turned to me and said by the way sister bisc your father will be all right and there was no big shouting clapping jumping just that Serene peace and from that moment my father who was his life hanging on a thread improved and for the next 20 years there was not an indication that there had ever been anything wrong with his heart he he had a an examination every year and the attending specialist said if I had not been the attending doctor I could never tell that you had ever had anything wrong with your heart and when he passed away at 84 years old 20 years later he simply passed away from old age and not only that he died a Believer and from that moment from that moment my family who had never gone to church my mother was saved and baptized at 82 my sister was saved and baptized at about 50 my brother was saved at 90 years old never go had a chance to be baptized but was saved and my whole family family one at a time by God's grace somehow came in so never never give up on your family just hold them before the Lord even if they're not anywhere around you they can be hundreds of kilometers away just hold them before the Lord and God's promise and he'll work it out he'll bring them so I'm I'm thankful for that I wanted to say about my contact with brother Bram is just a natural way just um I think you can call it just his natural Association uh once or twice we were down in Jeffersonville just maybe a for a day or two visit um like brother George was talking this morning about the natural man uh we were we visited once and and uh the girls and I were riding in the back of his car he had taken us out for lunch and um the windows were down and the wind was blowing and he said oh quickly roll up the windows we don't want to the wind to blow the ladies hair so he was mindful of all these little things you know maybe he wouldn't think a man would be and uh then we he took us for lunch to a to a restaurant and we're walking down the street he's got two of the girls by the hand and he's just talking to them and asking their name and um one of them is Joanne the youngest girl and he says what is your name she's 5 years old and she says uh Joanne he said oh that's a good strong name he said let me see I think you're going to be a singer and sure enough we always said she had lungs like leather but in recently in the last uh two two or three years she had an incurable disease and never spoke of it we never spoke of it it was a it's a disease that gradually hardens the lining of the lungs and other parts of of the body are affected and then in February she got um respiratory pneumonia she had a weakened condition anyway and I will just make this very short she ended up in in the emergency of the hospital hanging on a thread and we were away and one night we were trying we were trying to get uh plane tickets to rush home because we knew that that she was very very low and uh in the night I was praying and I reminded the Lord I said Lord your Prophet said Joanne I believe you're going to be a singer and I'm holding you to that promise she cannot sing unless her lungs are perfect and we came home and within a few few days God provided miraculously the top specialist I would say in Canada who came to the Forefront overnight actually called her at 9:30 one night and said Joan this is Dr stoer you don't sound good and I will meet you at the hospital in the morning Joanne couldn't even breathe she said how did you call me why are you calling me did my father call you H how are you calling me anyway by next morning Joanne had a team of four Specialists tending to her and I we just firmly believe that that whole thing happened for the sake of that doctor and her salvation and we know that it will it will turn out that way so we're very thankful for that and I think there's so much more that I could probably say if I could remember it right now um for you young girls young men I would just say to you what what those words that brother brandom spoke to me commit your way unto the Lord and he he will give you the desires of your heart you know it pays it pays to commit everything to the Lord commit your way to him follow him turn from the world it's not there's nothing out there for you not a thing and U even the little children read your Bible and pray the Bible is the most precious book when I was a young child I used to sing I have a wonderful treasure the gift of God without measure we will travel together my Bible and I I love it I love my Bible and if you have a chance just read read it read the read the Proverbs read a chapter of proverbs every day such instruction in that wonderful instruction for young men young ladies for everybody everything you need is in that scripture and in the in the message it will be good for you yeah so that's all I have to [Applause] say sister bisc we thank you so much said you risk to come up here and it's a great honor and a privilege for us said you made it to the platform and it was the love set in sister bis's heart to talk to the children let me have a just just one short prayer Father in Heaven our hearts is going to Sister bis and her husband father and

individual father Lord God that will change the direction of his or her life may you grant it Lord may you hide me behind the cross may you bless these few words Lord and may you get all the glory Lord for your kingdom in Jesus name we ask and pray amen and amen amen one scripture reading this afternoon if you have your Bibles children amen it's good to come to service with your swords with your Bible and I'll be reading from theonomy chapter 29 verse 29 that is the fifth book in the Bible chapter 29 verse 29 amen and God says the secret things belong unto the Lord Our God but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children forever that we may do all the words of this law may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated so good afternoon children young people God bless you it's a special privilege to speak to you this afternoon amen and before amen I'll I'll mention my title I will address the first question of the little children because I know when my children when they were smaller and when we were driving up to church I cannot remember they ever asked me Daddy what is your title they never asked me Daddy what scripture you're going to read but they said Daddy how long are you going to preach so let me answer that question for you little children amen I'm only going to speak 20 minutes amen but 20 minutes is enough for God to touch your heart hey because one day when brother Brenham was here there was a dead a little fish amen that was dead on the lake amen and in about 28 minutes or so that dead fish turned back to life so 20 minutes is enough that God can bless and touch your heart this afternoon amen so just relax in the spirit I'm just going to direct amen these few words to the children the young people and parents amen you can say Amen you can amen pray for the children amen as you feel that but am I'm just going to speak to the children amen something that the King of Kings told me to do amen because amen the King of Kings has a secret message that is revealed and belongs to the children amen thus sayth the Bible amen the secret things belong unto God but once they are revealed they belong to us and to our children that we may fulfill every word in this Bible amen so as a title for a few moments I'm going to speak children on The Secret Message of the king and our King is Jehovah he's the king of kings amen he's the greatest King there is amen he's the only King and he has a secret message for you children amen glory to God Amen it's a secret message that has been revealed and that is now belonging to you children and I Pray by the end of these few words that you can say this message that I heard about in these meetings is my message it's not just the message amen for for brother Brenham it's not the message just for my parents it's not the message for my older brother or sister but it is my message amen it is the most important message that you will ever hear children and it is a message that the devil knows nothing about but the King of Kings has it for you it's a message that was hidden before the foundation of the world and it's a message of Grace and it's a secret message it expresses and reveals the hidden and the secret desires of the king of kings the only thing that our King of Kings wants is expressed in that secret message the only desire he had was he wanted a family Jehovah wanted fellowship with his family and he wanted some more Sons and Daughters of God into his image that was the desire of the king of kings he now the enemy Satan did not like that desire because the devil has enough problem with God alone so the devil is afraid what if there will be more Sons and Daughters of God coming on the scene but God said that is my desire amen I want a family I want sons and daughters of God just like me just in my image amen so it had to become a secret message because the enemy the devil would do everything he can to destroy that purpose to destroy that message but I have good news for you the devil failed and the devil will not stop that secret message from coming to your heart and accomplishing its purpose amen say Amen somebody amen amen glory to God Amen so all God wanted was to reproduce his original life in some Sons and Daughters of God that was his desire that was his purpose that was his plan and that's why God spoke it in Genesis 1: 126 he said let us make man into our own image and let them have dominion and once it was spoken it has to come to pass but it was a secret the devil heard that read that scripture and says how will it ever happen but it was a secret message message that God Amen had for his people including his little children amen so that message amen that secret message let me tell you young people it is stop secret many people wish they could be here and hear the message many people wish they could hear amen and then the message from our King of Kings but it was a top secrets but thank God he gave us a prophet to reveal it and now once it's revealed it belongs to you children amen so that message that secret mission and message was so important to him so precious amen that he hided it in Simplicity brother Brenham said he said when God revealed that secret message to brother Brenham he said oh you don't know what this message means to me and I just pray it touches your heart this afternoon in the same way that you can begin to declare this is my secret message that has been revealed but it is mine amen because we see that amen that message it was amen put in secret John heard the message but God said John don't write it Daniel heard the message God told Daniel don't write it but God knew there would be a prophet in the last days that would reveal every mystery and it would reveal and live out that secret message amen hallelujah God would reveal it through a humble prophet and he would reveal and hide it into nobodies like you and I a secret message for simple people like you and I to run with that message cuz see young people children God has put us in a race and brother bam talks about that race and he said one day there was a contest and he said all that he they gathered some young children and he said what they had to do they were given a word and they had to run from that let's say from there to there and before they started running they got a word and the only thing that mattered when they made it to the other Aon site the only question that was asked it was do you remember and do you have the password and brother Ram tells many children ran and there was a boy he was running and he came the first but he arrived and the referee asked do you remember the pause word do you remember the message I've given you and the boy had forgotten it and the referee said I'm sorry and there was another boy he had a hard time to run he was falling up up and down once in a while he didn't take the shortest way to run from here to there but when he made it and the referee said what is the password he had the right word for his day so the question is not going to be have we run the fastest children the question will not be have you never fallen have you never have you had your UPS or Downs the question will not be did you take the shortest way but the question will be have you heard and recognized and acted upon my secret message blessed be the name of the Lord the Bible says Jesus said when I come back will I find fate that's the only thing that God is looking for that's the only question he's going to ask you when I come back will I find faith will I find back that original fate that I sent a prophet forth to restore will I find back that perfect Fai that Jesus had and I don't know about you but I'm saying yes Lord you will find that fate because that original faith is my message and I just pray that you can have the same testimony glory to God because God needs you children young children young people God needs you to fulfill his desire when the devil tells you you're not important when the devil tells you this is only for my parents and for my church that devil is a liar because God needs each one of you little children to fulfill his desire he chose you to complete that mission and fulfill the desires of his heart amen but he put it in a secret message to make sure that nobody could do damage to it and he wrote The Message in a secret language and he gave it to Adam in the Garden of Eden and every evening Jehovah would come down in the evening and he would come and fellowship with Adam he had given Adam that secret message he had given him the book and every evening they would have fellowship and God would just unfold that secret message to Adam and as Jehovah and Adam were fellowshipping they were fellowshipping in a secret language they were fellowshipping in the original language now some of you may think that the oldest language in the world is Latin or maybe it's Greek or maybe it's Hebrew or maybe it's Egyptian amen there's lots of debates on the internet who what is the oldest language I'm going to tell you what is the oldest language the oldest original language there is is the spoken word of God because the first language that was ever recorded is in Genesis 1 and God said let there be amen and that was the language that Adam spoke and that was the the language that Jehovah spoke and what a fellowship they had what a communion they had as they spoke on that fellow in that language and God was just they were just fellowshipping on that secret message amen glory to God this language is so special it is so secret it is so original that the devil will never know it but here is the good thing the only thing the devil can do with that language is obey it the devil will never speak that language he will never understand that language but when we speak that that language the devil has no choice but he has to obey and God has that secret language for you children amen but we see in the Bible amen how amen Adam amen he lost that secret language he lost that secret message because he doubted they in one word just one word from the password was missing but that did not change God's original desire that did not change God's thoughts about you and I God said my desire is I will have a family I will have sons and daughters in my image I will have little children that look just like me I will have teenagers that speak just like me blessed be the name of the Lord and when Adam lost that secret message the devil was standing there and he wanted to take it he said maybe I can get it now but before the Satan could get the secret message God took it back because that secret message does not belong to the devil but belongs to God's children God took it back sealed it up in a little book and kept it at his right hand because that was his desire that was the greatest the the greatest desire and dreams and wishes and plans that God had that was so precious to him that he said I'll I'll hold it in my right hand till there's going to come a time when I'm going to reveal it back to my people amen glory to God Amen so he sealed it in a in a little book sealed with Seven Seals amen and you can am we heard in Revelations 5 when John was looking he saw god with that little book with that secret message and John was weeping he said oh if I could only hear and and and read that secret message again if I could only get to that secret message again but the Bible says nobody was worthy to take the book even to look upon it you see how precious this is amen hallelujah but when John said aen he said amen when John was there crying all of a sudden he heard somebody saying weep not John the lion of the tribe of Judah has prevailed Hallelujah and out of Eternity stepped a bleedy bloody lamb that said I am worthy to take that book to lose to make it open again and to go and reveal it to my people and you and mean we can read in the book of Revelations that John when he could see that secret message again he was so happy he was so filled with joy cuz he said this is my secret message John did not care about anybody else but he said this is my secret message amen glory to God Amen so we thank God that God did not change his thoughts but out of Eternity Ste the bleedy bloody Lamb of God Amen and that was worthy to open the book amen and to bring it down to the Earth to continue the secret mission to bring God's people into Sons and Daughters of God into his own image amen and God revealed it to a humble Prophet amen and that Mighty angel came down in secret and hided himself in a prophet to reveal that secret message and when a prophet was called home as we heard this morning when the prophet was called of the scene that Mighty Angel stayed behind amen because that secret message was had to fulfill its purpose amen the Bible says in Exodus behold I've sent my angel before you to keep you in the way just obey his voice and he will bring you in the place that I've predestinated you to to go to so when a prophet left that angel stayed behind amen that Prophet amen the angel in a prophet had revealed again that secret message now we could say that secret things that belonged to God one time were revealed and now they belong to us but that angel stayed behind to make sure that message would become plain to you that secret message that was revealed now that angel stayed behind to make sure it would unfold and it would become so plain to you that you would say this is mine because see it was a secret message and it was hidden in the Bible but that's why when we read the Bible we read it through the message of Malachi 4 because everybody can read the Bible but to find that secret language you read it through the message of Malachi 4 Hallelujah and then you can read between the lines because that Mighty Angel the spirit of Truth is here to make sure that you connect to that secret message amen so that's why we thank God for that angel that's aiming at is on the Earth right now and all we have to do is stay connected to that angel because that angel has one mission to bring you in the place that God wants you to be in amen that angel is there Amen to watch over you and to connect you to that secret message blessed be the name of the Lord amen that angel is a spirit of truth that is unfolding and decoding the message if you like and making it more positive because we can testify every time we read the message every time we read the Bible it becomes more positive to me it becomes more positive to you am this is not a dead word this is a Living Word glory to God Amen so that message as the angel is making it plain and more positive to you it's that same message but he wants it so clear to you children because you need to run with that message and you need to know what is that secret secret message and the only thing you need to know it is a message of love it is a message of Grace it is a message that God wants you children to be like him not everybody knows that not everybody can even believe that but I thank God for some children for some young people for some believers that not only hear that message but that recognize it and are going to act upon it amen Ain going to say Lord reveal that secret message in its fullness to me Lord let me stay the Bible talks about a secret place of Thunder let me stay in that secret place and as I pray and read my Bible and read the message may you reveal to me the purpose of my life and may I then commit my ways unto that secret message just as sister bisc did commit my ways unto the Lord and he shall bring to pass the desires of your heart amen because the promise amen there's a promise over you children that you will know you will know him that is from the beginning you will have have perfect fellowship with Jehovah like Adam had with Jehovah that is not history it is more present tense that we can even pinch ourself the same language the same way that Adam fellowship with Jehovah that's how God wants to speak to your children in the same Simplicity we saw it manifested in Malachi 4 we heard a testimony about it that is the same way that God wants to reveal that secret message to you and to make it a reality amen and as you amen as you receive that secret message and as God unfolds it to you that original language will become your language I will forget about flamish I will forget about French I will forget about my human language I will forget about my human thoughts I will forget about my ODS I will forget about my funny feelings but I will connect back to that original language and I will speak just like Jesus spoke so I promise you 20 minutes children my time is up but I pray that some little child in here may speak like Jesus did one day when he was the age of 12 you know what Jesus said I must be concerned about that secret message because I must fulfill that secret message musicians you can come forward I must complete and fulfill God's original desire I must be about my father's business Jesus said I must run with this message I must contend for that message it is not just the message of my parents it's not just the message of my grandparents it's not just the message of my church but it's mine it is my love letter it is my secret message from my king of kings amen and when I come to the other side of the race and the question is asked will I find fate I pray that we can stand there and said Lord according to thy words it has been unto my life so God bless you children just remember the king of Kings has a secret message that has been revealed through a humble prophet and it belongs to you don't let nobody take it away from you don't let nobody say that it is not your message don't let nobody distract you on that race it doesn't matter how fast you run does not matter whether we fall and rise again we all do but what matters have you heard have you recognized and have you acted upon my secret message shall we stand to our feet and may we pray be like Jesus said those words I must be about that secret message because that secret message that is me you may not see it yet but every word in that secret message m is going to become me and that little boy that brother Bram spoke about was looking in the mirror one time and he said I see a boy and when he when I raise my hand that boy raises his hand when I raise both hands that boy raises both hands amen and then that the boy got a revelation and he said that boy is actually me I pray children may God show you that that secret message the word hallelujah is you may God bless you mine mine mine Jesus Is Mine Jesus spoke those words when he was in the temple he said I must be about my father's business I just pray children that when you leave from here you say the same and you say Jesus is mine this secret message has been revealed and it belongs to me it's not just for my parents it was good for them it was good for my grandparents it's still good for for them but it is also good for me is that how you feel this afternoon may God bless you amen God be with you children amen God
