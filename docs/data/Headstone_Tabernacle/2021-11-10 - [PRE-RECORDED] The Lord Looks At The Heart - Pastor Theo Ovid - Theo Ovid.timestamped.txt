[18:32] so good to be here we have some guests
[18:34] among us we announced them right after
[18:36] the service but this time you want to go
[18:38] straight to the scriptures
[18:39] you want to look at first samuel chapter
[18:41] 16.
[18:42] i want to read from verse 1 to 13.
[18:45] i want to read one verse in proverbs 23
[18:47] you want to read verse 7
[18:49] and acts chapter 13
[18:51] i want to read verse 21
[18:54] to 22.
[19:02] the title of the message this morning is
[19:04] that the lord looks at the heart
[19:07] that's the title this morning the lord
[19:08] looks at the heart
[19:12] this is for samuel 16
[19:15] god speaking to his prophet samuel
[19:18] and the lord said unto samuel how long
[19:19] will god mourn for soul
[19:21] cena rejected him
[19:23] from reigning over israel
[19:26] fill that horn with oil and go i will
[19:28] assembly to jesse the bethlehemite for i
[19:30] have provided me a king
[19:33] among his sons
[19:35] samuel said how can i go it's all here
[19:37] he will kill me
[19:39] and the lord said take a heifer with
[19:40] thee and say i am come
[19:42] to sacrifice to the lord and call jesse
[19:44] to the sacrifice and i will surely what
[19:47] thou shalt do and thou shalt anoint unto
[19:50] me him whom i shall name unto thee and
[19:53] samuel did that which the lord spake and
[19:55] came to bethlehem and the elders of the
[19:57] town trembled at his coming and said
[19:59] comes out peaceably and he said
[20:01] peaceably i am come to sacrifice unto
[20:03] the lord
[20:04] sanctify yourself and come with me to
[20:05] the sacrifice and he sanctified jesse
[20:07] and his sons and called them to the
[20:09] sacrifice he gave him the pass when they
[20:11] would come
[20:12] he looked on ilya and said surely the
[20:15] lord's anointed this before him
[20:17] and the lord said unto samuel look not
[20:20] on his countenance
[20:22] nor on the height of his stature
[20:24] because i have refused him
[20:26] for the lord see it not as man see it
[20:30] for man look at the outward appearance
[20:33] but the lord looked on the heart
[20:36] and then jesse
[20:37] called abinad and made him pass before
[20:40] samuel and the lord and and he said
[20:43] neither had the lord chosen this then
[20:45] jesse made sharma to pass by he said
[20:47] neither had the lord chosen this again
[20:49] jesse made seven of his sons to pass
[20:51] before samuel and samuel said unto jesse
[20:54] the lord had not chosen these
[20:56] samuel said unto jesse i did
[20:59] i hear all my children
[21:01] he said there is remaining yet the
[21:02] youngest
[21:03] and behold he keep it the sheep and
[21:05] samuel said on the jersey side and fetch
[21:07] him for we will not sit down
[21:09] jerry come here
[21:10] and he sent and brought him and he was a
[21:13] ruddy and little a beautiful countenance
[21:16] and goodly to look at
[21:17] and the lord said arise
[21:20] anoint him
[21:21] for this is he
[21:23] then samuel took the horn of oil
[21:25] and anointed him in the midst of his
[21:27] brethren
[21:28] and the spirit of the lord came upon
[21:30] david from that day forward
[21:32] so samuel rose up
[21:34] and went to rana
[21:36] on a look at proverbs
[21:37] chapter 23 verse 7 say far as he tinket
[21:40] in his heart
[21:41] so is he eat and drinks that he to thee
[21:44] but with his heart is not with thee
[21:47] last scripture reading from acts chapter
[21:49] 13 verse 21
[21:51] and afterwards
[21:53] talking about israel they desire the
[21:55] king
[21:56] and god give unto them saul the son of
[21:58] sis a man
[22:00] of the tribe of benjamin by the space of
[22:02] 40 years
[22:03] and when he had removed him
[22:06] he raised up unto them david to be the
[22:09] king
[22:10] to whom also he gave testimony and said
[22:12] i have found david
[22:14] the son of jesse
[22:16] a man
[22:17] after
[22:19] my own heart
[22:20] which shall fulfill
[22:22] all my will let's pray father we thank
[22:24] you for your written word and only you
[22:26] could bring the context and the
[22:27] inspiration behind this tonight
[22:29] this morning and i pray you just speak
[22:31] to us and and take me
[22:33] behind the cross and hide and be in
[22:35] calvary's cross and speak to your people
[22:38] this morning in jesus name i ask it amen
[22:40] you may be seasoned
[22:47] it's such a blessing to be here
[22:50] to be alive
[22:52] to be in health to be in good strength
[22:56] that you could raise your hand and
[22:57] worship the lord
[22:58] you didn't come here to me to see me you
[23:01] come here into presence
[23:03] and if you come in the presence you want
[23:04] to commit respect you want to commit
[23:05] honor you want to come at thanksgiving
[23:07] you want to commit gratefulness in your
[23:09] heart
[23:10] for the privilege to be here
[23:12] how much people who have gone to hell
[23:15] all the people who lose on that chance
[23:16] right now this morning would have wished
[23:18] to take up your seat this morning
[23:20] they don't even stand a chance some
[23:22] people out in the hospital they kind of
[23:23] talk
[23:24] the chance has gone they missed the turn
[23:27] and they don't have a chance to reboot
[23:29] and come back to say i'm sorry
[23:31] forgive me i want to serve you no chance
[23:34] they're gone and we have a
[23:36] responsibility to be a witness of jesus
[23:38] christ
[23:39] we have a real responsibility to testify
[23:41] about the lord
[23:42] because ready or not you have to meet
[23:44] him
[23:45] let me say it again ready or not you
[23:47] have to meet him
[23:49] the voice of god will call all the dead
[23:52] not just christians you know every band
[23:54] that dead have to be called
[23:55] to account for what they did in this
[23:57] body
[23:58] oh hallelujah you better find out why
[23:59] they alter why your maker put you on
[24:01] this earth
[24:02] there's a reason why i call you there's
[24:04] a reason why you're here this morning
[24:07] okay so the title is the lord looked on
[24:08] the heart
[24:09] and i want to share some things with you
[24:12] that i feel i want you and the church to
[24:14] know
[24:15] by the grace of
[24:16] god
[24:18] there's a pressure on the people today
[24:22] and that pressure
[24:23] has no limitation
[24:26] or any denominational line
[24:29] it has no age line
[24:31] it has no respect of prisoners
[24:35] it's on young
[24:37] it's on all
[24:38] it's on good
[24:40] it's on bad
[24:42] it's on everybody
[24:44] p r e h s u r e
[24:46] pressure
[24:49] no limitations
[24:51] we're living in an erotic age nervous
[24:53] tension everybody's racing here going
[24:54] here going nowhere
[24:57] it's just a kind of age
[24:59] and i see people speeding over take me
[25:00] and boom boom boom and then here come
[25:02] the traffic
[25:06] and the speed in which you overtake you
[25:08] swear to god them they reach and come
[25:10] back already
[25:11] and you see them two cars ahead right
[25:13] there they say what is the first
[25:18] and i know this church will be plagued
[25:20] with it as everywhere is plagiated
[25:23] the tabernacle is plagued with it the
[25:25] whole world
[25:26] it's a day of pressure
[25:28] hurry hurry hurry get up and wait
[25:31] nervous tension
[25:32] the wife says something i look on cherry
[25:34] you want to fly off
[25:36] temper
[25:37] husband says something you pat your foot
[25:39] and tell him to get out get in the room
[25:42] no husband i don't wanna always with you
[25:44] go out here wife i'm so nervous what's
[25:46] the matter it's a tension buildup
[25:49] it will make the poor act that way and
[25:52] together this tension
[25:53] and the results of it results of it is
[25:56] doing something wrong
[25:58] and acting out of place
[26:01] that's what pressure make people do
[26:03] pressure this pressure
[26:05] is the atmosphere
[26:07] it's a spirit as the atmosphere is
[26:08] something that pressing people
[26:10] make the husband fly loose with the
[26:12] white flying loose and and act the wrong
[26:14] way and say the wrong thing
[26:16] let's continue
[26:17] praise the lord
[26:21] that's right no it will make the poor
[26:22] act that way it will make the middle
[26:24] class act that way it will make the rich
[26:26] act that way it will make the wrong act
[26:29] that way it will make the pretty good
[26:30] act that way
[26:31] it make the good act that way because
[26:34] it's that tension
[26:35] is a steam built up
[26:37] and it got the blood somewhere
[26:39] so you blow the boiler up you have to
[26:42] let off this scene no everybody is
[26:43] guilty of it
[26:45] i am guilty
[26:47] you all are guilty we all do things
[26:50] under pressure that we wouldn't do
[26:52] otherwise
[26:54] so there's an excess of pressure built
[26:56] up today
[26:57] isn't that right and i believe he said
[26:59] is the enemy coming down
[27:01] i believe it's the devil
[27:05] so it's the devil's job to put pressure
[27:07] on you that you act the wrong way
[27:08] because he don't want you
[27:10] act the right way
[27:11] and think the right thoughts and speak
[27:13] the right words he doesn't want that he
[27:15] wants you to be constantly under
[27:16] pressure
[27:17] so when you're thinking this come true
[27:19] from something else and it's something
[27:21] else and you're frustrated and when you
[27:23] when you see it frustrating so he loves
[27:24] that
[27:25] he smile whenever then we'll come out
[27:27] your mouth i'm so frustrated
[27:30] devil get your pat on your shoulder and
[27:31] rub your hair down
[27:33] he said come on now you you know you are
[27:35] frustrated and you're not even a little
[27:37] depressed too
[27:38] because that's the next thing tonight
[27:40] because when you're depressed you're
[27:41] falling a hole you don't want to see
[27:42] nobody you don't want to talk to nobody
[27:44] you don't want to get off your bed
[27:45] because you're depressed that all that
[27:46] satan you know
[27:49] [Applause]
[27:51] all that is lucifer you know loose on
[27:53] the earth
[27:54] all lucifer people expose him this
[27:56] morning
[27:57] you're fed up you're frustrated and no
[28:00] no no don't get fed up no you're getting
[28:02] a word this morning
[28:03] oh glory to god
[28:05] what if the woman the whale was fed up
[28:07] she didn't even know what kind of hat
[28:08] she had
[28:09] oh glory to god her life was messed up
[28:12] she had four men they wanted to live in
[28:14] it wasn't hers but god saw something
[28:16] inside that woman
[28:17] that he could send jesus after her
[28:20] that jesus could wait on her because god
[28:23] doesn't look as man look
[28:25] god is look at the heart he does look
[28:27] completely different so don't come with
[28:29] your own thinking this morning
[28:31] oh give the lord a shout
[28:33] oh give the lord some praises this
[28:35] morning i don't care what your neighbors
[28:37] say about you i don't care what your
[28:39] wife say about you i don't care what
[28:41] your husband say about you it is what
[28:43] god
[28:44] [Applause]
[28:46] say about you
[28:47] [Applause]
[28:52] the devil would go about like a roaring
[28:54] lion in the last days he would get you
[28:56] under pressure hurrying over something
[29:00] and you will make decisions that you
[29:02] would make if you sat down and think it
[29:04] over
[29:08] how much marriages would a hole today if
[29:11] people had to think over the choice of
[29:13] their wife and pray about it
[29:17] how much relationships would have been
[29:18] so different if they had sought the lord
[29:22] and get a clear answer from god
[29:26] but the pressure
[29:28] the pressure
[29:31] let me say that one again
[29:33] making decisions that you wouldn't make
[29:37] if you sit down
[29:39] and think it over
[29:41] but god has the answer
[29:43] and that is what we want to take the
[29:44] answer
[29:46] now when the old testament there was a
[29:48] time when a man could build pressure up
[29:49] there and there was a time when he done
[29:51] something wrong
[29:54] under pressure
[29:56] and if he said innocent blood and he was
[29:58] on the run
[29:59] as soon as that man was killed he
[30:01] wronged he did the man he did wrong to
[30:04] some of the people would haunt him and
[30:05] if they found him they would kill him
[30:08] because in those days was tooth for toot
[30:12] eye for eye
[30:14] life for life
[30:16] and there was the place where the man
[30:17] couldn't stop here to run
[30:20] if he done something accidentally of
[30:21] course people wouldn't believe it
[30:24] i was there and i would do something any
[30:27] man fell on a knife and
[30:28] nobody believed in them
[30:30] something accidentally
[30:32] the relatives of this man or woman
[30:33] whoever it was would start hunting him
[30:35] if i took for two that's the way they
[30:37] lived
[30:38] and he couldn't stop nowhere he was a
[30:39] fugitive
[30:40] he didn't know what to do he was on the
[30:43] run and the very time of the day i think
[30:45] that's called so much pressure we are on
[30:46] the run
[30:47] that's the matter with the world knowing
[30:50] the commons alone is at hand the
[30:52] pressure is building up they're on the
[30:53] run roadhouse gambling luxury sin
[30:56] immoral decay they give vent listen to
[30:59] the television dirty jokes they unvent
[31:02] they only run they want to face up the
[31:04] wall in a parameter and they're clicking
[31:06] on some comedian cracking jokes and you
[31:08] laughing laughing afterwards you can
[31:09] laugh
[31:11] you laughing as long as the comedian
[31:13] giving talk you laugh and after that
[31:14] you're still in trouble
[31:16] hallelujah they know something is
[31:18] fiction to take place the world speaks
[31:20] of it something is fixing to take place
[31:22] so in the old testament god seeing in
[31:25] some of this trouble was accidentally
[31:28] done so if you're innocent and not
[31:29] guilty god makes a way for you if a man
[31:32] killed a man just deliberately and
[31:34] premeditated he was lost he could not
[31:36] come into this place but if he did
[31:38] accidentally he didn't mean to do it
[31:40] there was a city of refuge
[31:43] god himself set that up
[31:45] a city of refuge that you could run and
[31:48] be safe
[31:50] could we give the lord a shout
[31:52] hallelujah
[31:54] and one of those places was rama gilead
[31:56] four places joshua places cities of
[31:59] refuge now the people could come into
[32:01] the city of refuge if they accidentally
[32:03] did something wrong he didn't mean to he
[32:06] would come to the city of refuge go to
[32:07] the gate the people asking why are you
[32:09] coming that was his idea of coming and
[32:12] then his case was pleaded and his case
[32:14] was pleaded at the gate and the man won
[32:15] to be innocent he did not willfully and
[32:17] the man was taken to the city as a place
[32:20] of refuge then the enemy could not get
[32:22] him
[32:24] and when god set up a place that you
[32:26] could hide no enemy could get you
[32:29] i'm not talking about your thoughts i'm
[32:31] not talking about your ideas i'm talking
[32:33] about what god set up
[32:35] he has set up a way of escape he has set
[32:38] up a place of refuge where you could
[32:40] find shelter
[32:42] oh glory to god amen do you believe that
[32:51] if he done something wrong and was
[32:53] guilty his enemy have a right to come
[32:56] and they say if he was whole under the
[32:58] horns of the altars and he made a
[32:59] privilege and a right to drag him from
[33:00] the earth and kill him
[33:02] because he was guilty
[33:04] premeditated
[33:06] course
[33:07] he said and then when once he got in the
[33:09] city he could let off the pressure
[33:11] he was safe he was all right of course
[33:13] there was a provided place for him god
[33:16] provided way for the innocent man not to
[33:17] be slain but to be exempted from this
[33:20] lane because he accidentally did it he
[33:22] didn't mean to do it now if he meant to
[33:25] do it that's different now there are two
[33:27] classes in the world today
[33:29] there are men and women of the world
[33:30] today
[33:31] that really
[33:33] don't want to do the things they're
[33:35] doing
[33:38] and jude identifies some of that he said
[33:41] and of some
[33:43] have compassion
[33:45] making a difference
[33:47] that people who are in weakness we can
[33:49] reflect we can this week and that and
[33:52] they're struggling and they definitely
[33:53] give them a hard time they are different
[33:55] from people who are just brute beasts
[33:58] and don't care
[34:00] so jude said and of some
[34:03] have compassion
[34:04] so let's continue now
[34:06] men and women today who really don't
[34:08] don't want to do what they're doing they
[34:10] don't want to sin i feel sorry for them
[34:13] they don't want to do anything wrong but
[34:14] they do it
[34:16] they are drove to it no there's a place
[34:18] for that person
[34:20] that wants to do right
[34:23] let me say it again there's a place
[34:25] for that person
[34:27] that wants to do right
[34:30] hallelujah
[34:31] there's a place to let off the pressure
[34:34] but there's some that doesn't even care
[34:36] that's different
[34:37] they don't care what they do they're
[34:38] okay who see who know they don't care
[34:41] we're not talking about them
[34:42] we're talking about you
[34:45] who want to do right
[34:47] and jew the book of jude
[34:49] uh jude and brother joe share this with
[34:52] me that the four groups of rhinos that
[34:53] are here groups you're talking about
[34:55] you talk about uh
[34:57] uh those that are sanctified and
[34:59] preserved in jesus christ he said i i
[35:01] beloved i give diligence the right unto
[35:03] you
[35:04] of the common salvation it was needful
[35:06] for me to write unto you and exhort you
[35:09] that you should earnestly contend for
[35:11] the faith which was more delivered to
[35:12] the saints in other words you lost it
[35:14] you don't have it fight for it
[35:16] you once had it it was once or wrong
[35:18] that's why you could say how could
[35:20] somebody be adopted and there's no
[35:22] apostolic church identified we have to
[35:24] go back to the apostolic church in other
[35:26] words we have to go back to our church
[35:28] with the faith restored could we say
[35:31] i'll shout on that
[35:33] the bible prophesied this faith gonna be
[35:35] here
[35:36] not talk faith not preach faith the real
[35:38] faith what they had
[35:40] in other words there's gonna be an
[35:42] apostolic church
[35:43] with jesus christ walking in it
[35:45] the shout of the king
[35:48] will be in the camp
[35:50] oh glory to god do you believe that
[35:53] how many believe that
[35:54] glory to god so jude was telling them
[35:56] fight for the faith
[35:58] content for the faith
[36:00] then he said
[36:01] for they are certain men crept in
[36:03] unawares they sneak in who were before
[36:06] of all ordained his condemnation on
[36:09] godly men turning the grace of god into
[36:11] laziestness and denying the only lord
[36:14] jesus
[36:15] i will therefore put your remembrance
[36:18] though you once knew this how the lord

[1:06:18] some
[1:06:19] have compassion
[1:06:21] making a difference
[1:06:23] and others save with fear pull them over
[1:06:25] the fire heating even the garments
[1:06:28] spotted by the flesh
[1:06:30] now unto him that is able to keep you
[1:06:31] from falling oh god this song so sweet

[1:07:26] is after you then there's a way of
[1:07:28] escape
[1:07:29] and that escape is jesus christ is a
[1:07:31] place where you could let off steam
[1:07:33] another thing when you're coming to this
[1:07:35] place while you are there you can't hang
[1:07:37] around everyday crime i'd like to get
[1:07:38] out i'll let it get out i'll let you
[1:07:40] have to be satisfied to be in that place
[1:07:43] of refuge
[1:07:44] you can't just want to get out i want a
[1:07:46] party i want to go out i want to smoke
[1:07:48] no no you have to be thankful and be
[1:07:50] grateful to god
[1:07:51] that you put a hedge around you
[1:07:54] [Applause]
[1:07:56] glory to god
[1:07:58] hallelujah
[1:08:00] do you believe that
[1:08:01] no matter what take place christ is our
[1:08:03] refuge and when we come to him we can
[1:08:05] let off the pressure
[1:08:06] you can quit worrying about
[1:08:08] well if i die what is going to happen to
[1:08:10] me
[1:08:13] if you're thinking about that
[1:08:15] pressure
[1:08:18] what's going to happen to the wife
[1:08:20] what's going to happen to the husband
[1:08:22] oh good
[1:08:24] what's going on to the children just
[1:08:26] come into christ
[1:08:28] and let off the pressure
[1:08:31] you give us all things somebody might
[1:08:33] give you a million dollars
[1:08:36] it will build pressure
[1:08:40] you didn't think about that
[1:08:42] i know you can do with a million or you
[1:08:44] might have
[1:08:45] but guess what that million will bring
[1:08:47] some pressure
[1:08:48] you might join a church it will be a
[1:08:50] pressure
[1:08:51] because the methodists tell you they're
[1:08:53] right baptist is wrong they often say
[1:08:55] they're wrong you're right it brings a
[1:08:56] pressure cause you don't know where
[1:08:58] you're standing
[1:08:59] but when you're coming to christ
[1:09:01] it's settled down
[1:09:04] he's our refuge
[1:09:06] you are in this refuge
[1:09:08] you got a right to anything that's in
[1:09:10] the refuge
[1:09:11] and christ is our refuge
[1:09:14] when in sickness total pressure let off
[1:09:16] pressure
[1:09:17] let off pressure in the seat of refuge
[1:09:18] he took upon your worry you don't have
[1:09:21] to you don't have to have it cast your
[1:09:23] cares on him for he cared about you
[1:09:25] cared for you don't you worry about your
[1:09:27] cares that's his business
[1:09:29] oh glory to god
[1:09:31] hallelujah
[1:09:33] could we go a little further
[1:09:35] all right let's continue
[1:09:38] he's talking about her sister in the
[1:09:39] church
[1:09:41] i want you to listen carefully
[1:09:44] they go to church this woman she went
[1:09:46] into the church she done a very good job
[1:09:48] she was a piano player
[1:09:50] after a while she began to notice the
[1:09:52] woman in our neighborhood begin to dress
[1:09:54] immodestly
[1:09:55] how they get out and mow their layers
[1:09:56] with their little clothes on
[1:09:59] i hope there's none of them here tonight
[1:10:01] so disgrace to you sister god be
[1:10:03] merciful to your sinful soul
[1:10:06] what else could do that but an evil
[1:10:08] spirit full of lust
[1:10:11] you don't want to think that but that's
[1:10:13] exactly the only person that ever
[1:10:15] stripped their clothes off in the bag
[1:10:16] was a maniac
[1:10:17] put on clothes that and act like a lady
[1:10:21] now the first thing you know she taught
[1:10:23] you go get by with that
[1:10:25] because the rest of the woman in church
[1:10:27] was doing the same thing that's what i
[1:10:28] said don't judge people in church by
[1:10:30] other people in the church
[1:10:31] judge yourself by the word
[1:10:33] because that brother could be whatever
[1:10:35] condition you don't know but he doing it
[1:10:37] she doing it don't you do it
[1:10:40] listen
[1:10:41] she thought she would do it so she
[1:10:43] started to doing it
[1:10:44] that letter they began to smoke
[1:10:46] cigarettes so she thought she'd smoke
[1:10:47] cigarettes
[1:10:49] she continued playing there was nothing
[1:10:51] said too much about it around the church
[1:10:54] now remember i keep telling you the
[1:10:55] reason that a lot of things carrying a
[1:10:57] message because they haven't seen
[1:10:58] judgment yet
[1:11:00] i've got this scripture for that
[1:11:01] and that's eccles ecclesiastes 8. listen
[1:11:04] to this because sentenced
[1:11:07] against an evil work
[1:11:09] is not executed speedily
[1:11:12] therefore the heart of the sons of men
[1:11:14] is fully setting them to do evil
[1:11:21] do you see god have a time to do things
[1:11:24] he said the the cup of the amorous is
[1:11:26] not full the cup of iniquity
[1:11:28] when it's full then god sent judgment
[1:11:31] when is building up he just let it run
[1:11:33] so people do their own thing
[1:11:35] when the children of israel came out two
[1:11:37] million people you know rejoice him oh
[1:11:40] good without out pharaoh
[1:11:44] god so all in perishing
[1:11:46] except joshua killed him
[1:11:50] god knew
[1:11:51] they would fail
[1:11:53] but he pulled them out
[1:11:55] but in them had another generation as a
[1:11:57] seed
[1:12:00] in a in them had another generation
[1:12:03] that was going to be born
[1:12:04] that was going to go into the promised
[1:12:06] land because god has to keep his word he
[1:12:08] has to pull him and bring them into the
[1:12:09] land and this land that we have is the
[1:12:11] land of ephesians
[1:12:13] that the church must cross over into and
[1:12:15] the seven thunders is prophesied to
[1:12:17] bring us into that land
[1:12:18] where there is a perfect church where
[1:12:20] you are predestinating the uh adoption
[1:12:23] and that ephesians husbands love their
[1:12:24] wives and ephesians children obey their
[1:12:26] parents and ephesians is a fightful
[1:12:28] ministry in ephesians there's one lord
[1:12:30] one faith one baptism and ephesians we
[1:12:32] are no longer strangers but we are
[1:12:34] fellow citizens of the household of god
[1:12:37] oh glory to god in ephesians christ the
[1:12:39] head of the church
[1:12:40] all glory to god the mystery to connect
[1:12:42] the body together heading about that all
[1:12:44] that is in ephesians that's the land we
[1:12:46] have to go into not corrections not
[1:12:48] galatians ephesians that's the place
[1:12:50] that the faith is restored back to
[1:12:52] that's another ephesus that's the alpha
[1:12:54] bride oh glory to god that we the omega
[1:12:57] have to go back to and pick up what they
[1:12:59] had
[1:13:00] oh glory before going to the rapture we
[1:13:02] have to pick up what they had he sent a
[1:13:04] prophet to turn our ass back to the
[1:13:05] faith of the fathers but back to church
[1:13:07] back to the fate
[1:13:08] let me say that again not back to church
[1:13:11] back to the feet
[1:13:13] oh glory to god hallelujah
[1:13:16] do you believe that
[1:13:17] do you see your heart being turned back
[1:13:19] to the faith
[1:13:20] i want you to see your heart being
[1:13:22] turned back
[1:13:23] [Music]
[1:13:23] [Applause]
[1:13:29] back to the fate of the fathers when
[1:13:30] peter was in prison and the believers
[1:13:31] were praying the doors open up
[1:13:34] angel of god came and opened and locked
[1:13:35] pete and released peter from that that
[1:13:37] is back to the fate
[1:13:39] oh god person can hold you back to the
[1:13:41] fate you have to come out and no you
[1:13:43] can't stay in the prison of sickness
[1:13:45] come on now you can't stay in the prison
[1:13:46] of sickness
[1:13:48] back to the fate of you coming under
[1:13:49] sickness coming under blindness coming
[1:13:52] out you're being restored that's what
[1:13:53] we're talking about back to the faith
[1:13:55] [Music]
[1:13:58] glory
[1:14:09] they will join church today
[1:14:10] live any kind of life or anything but i
[1:14:12] tell you one thing you can't be born
[1:14:15] again and live any kind of a life
[1:14:18] you would live for jesus christ when you
[1:14:20] are born again
[1:14:21] you would act like a man you will
[1:14:23] conduct yourself as a real christian if
[1:14:25] you are born again
[1:14:26] of the spirit of god so let's continue
[1:14:29] there's a purpose i'm reading this i
[1:14:30] want you to stick with me right with me
[1:14:32] so this woman finally she fell in love
[1:14:34] with a man and neighbor
[1:14:37] run off marry this man
[1:14:39] continue playing piano in the church
[1:14:42] after a while she left him and marry
[1:14:43] another one
[1:14:44] she taught us do she do all right
[1:14:46] finally she ended up with a common law
[1:14:48] wise
[1:14:49] what was it
[1:14:50] her soul told her in the beginning don't
[1:14:52] do that
[1:14:54] but she reasoned now if the rest of the
[1:14:56] woman can do this why can't i do it
[1:14:58] but don in her soul
[1:15:00] was a spirit that said don't do that
[1:15:02] keep away from that that's not right
[1:15:05] she fought against that
[1:15:08] cast that aside
[1:15:10] went to reasoning
[1:15:12] watch
[1:15:13] don't reason just believe god's word
[1:15:15] don't try to reason out
[1:15:18] just what god said is the truth
[1:15:20] and believe that to be the truth
[1:15:23] and don't go to your reasoning go to
[1:15:25] your experience to christ in the heart
[1:15:28] and compare it with god's word
[1:15:30] so she went on and after a while she was
[1:15:32] called or the pastor of a church was
[1:15:33] called to her bedside to pray for her
[1:15:36] she was laying there smoking cigarettes
[1:15:38] everything
[1:15:39] living in the house a common-law wife he
[1:15:41] said sister is everything all right with
[1:15:43] your soul to die
[1:15:46] she said everything is at peace
[1:15:49] no she believed it
[1:15:51] she had went listen
[1:15:53] she had went so long with her intellect
[1:15:56] until she had grieved
[1:15:58] the holy spirit
[1:15:59] from her
[1:16:01] it was it no more spoke to her
[1:16:04] she didn't know what was right
[1:16:06] she had reasoned it out
[1:16:08] she had a mental conception that if she
[1:16:11] went to church and did what was right
[1:16:13] she would go to heaven
[1:16:15] then went on down to the very oh of debt
[1:16:19] now this is the part i want to get to
[1:16:22] when her reasoning power and the prophet
[1:16:24] breaking yellow
[1:16:25] when you die
[1:16:27] your brain breaks up of course
[1:16:31] when the spirit
[1:16:33] leaves you and then what's left
[1:16:35] here's your soul
[1:16:37] that you neglected back there
[1:16:39] which comes to you then
[1:16:42] when you're dying
[1:16:43] and this mental reasoning breaks up
[1:16:47] you don't reason no more
[1:16:49] it's your soul
[1:16:51] that has been in your heart
[1:16:54] that you grieved away
[1:16:56] and it caught up with her
[1:16:58] and when she ditched you scream my god i
[1:17:00] am lost
[1:17:02] let me say this way to you
[1:17:04] so
[1:17:05] you are a triune being
[1:17:07] you have a body
[1:17:08] you have a spirit you have a soul
[1:17:11] that human spirit is given to you inside
[1:17:13] a deer is where you get reasoning
[1:17:15] memory
[1:17:16] conscience imagination so when somebody
[1:17:19] dies the human spirit breaks up
[1:17:24] in that human spirit is where you have
[1:17:25] your cxe your gc your degree your big
[1:17:28] house your big car
[1:17:29] you're a ceo you're a doctor you're a
[1:17:31] lawyer you're a pilot you're an engineer
[1:17:33] you're an aeronaut astronaut whatever it
[1:17:36] is all that position of power your
[1:17:37] president your prime minister all that
[1:17:39] is existing at the spirit level driving
[1:17:41] on mercedes-benz driving are rolls royce
[1:17:43] whatever all that is in that space there
[1:17:47] what people think they are how high they
[1:17:49] are how powerful they are how great they
[1:17:51] are how mighty they are how powerful the
[1:17:52] family is that's dear but in debt that
[1:17:55] spirit breaks up and your soul comes up
[1:17:57] and the soul is who you really are
[1:17:59] [Music]
[1:18:00] [Applause]
[1:18:01] so this woman
[1:18:02] intellectually she believes she's right
[1:18:05] when it breaks up her soul comes up she
[1:18:06] said my god i'm lost it's too late then
[1:18:15] the soul that has been grieved away
[1:18:18] don't let that be your state
[1:18:21] you mind god
[1:18:23] be born of the spirit of god
[1:18:25] quit reasoning things and believe what
[1:18:28] god said to be the truth
[1:18:30] be filled with god's spirit and then god
[1:18:32] would lead you and the holy spirit would
[1:18:34] lead you in the path of righteousness
[1:18:38] oh glory to god so you really want to be
[1:18:40] led by your the spirit
[1:18:42] not just coming to church for a blessing
[1:18:46] because you'll find yourself lost
[1:18:50] people are going to hell you know
[1:18:52] hell is not preaching this message but
[1:18:53] people go to hell
[1:18:55] [Music]
[1:19:03] what about says here
[1:19:08] someone come together and say brother
[1:19:09] branham do you think it's wrong to do a
[1:19:10] certain thing
[1:19:12] i said why do you question about
[1:19:14] if there's a question in your mind
[1:19:16] leave it alone
[1:19:19] don't do it at all then you know you're
[1:19:22] right
[1:19:25] should i do this should i do that should
[1:19:27] i do this what's the question and forget
[1:19:28] it
[1:19:29] kill it then don't do it
[1:19:31] and you're right
[1:19:34] now i am positive sure this morning
[1:19:38] if men and women
[1:19:40] could only get into the position
[1:19:43] of where their soul
[1:19:46] their thinking
[1:19:48] their attitude will be perfect in the
[1:19:51] sight of god
[1:19:53] that would be one of the most powerful
[1:19:55] churches
[1:19:56] that ever existed
[1:19:59] that means this little group of you
[1:20:00] people here tonight this could be one of
[1:20:01] the most powerful church
[1:20:03] that ever existed
[1:20:05] if we could get the soul
[1:20:08] thinking
[1:20:10] attitude
[1:20:12] perfect in the sight of god
[1:20:15] [Music]
[1:20:18] so lying is a deceitful and a hard thing
[1:20:23] so
[1:20:25] oh
[1:20:27] it's an evil thing i'd rather have a
[1:20:29] drunkard with me anything
[1:20:33] so you know liar lying at the bottom
[1:20:35] that way everybody said no liars in the
[1:20:36] kick number
[1:20:37] save your line stop the line
[1:20:40] get prayed for getting spirited liner
[1:20:42] for you
[1:20:47] all right
[1:20:48] but no matter how sinful you are
[1:20:51] you are still a fallen son of god
[1:20:55] the most sinful person you see today god
[1:20:58] didn't intend you to be sinful
[1:21:00] he wanted you to be a son or daughter of
[1:21:02] his
[1:21:03] you made up
[1:21:05] you are made in his own makeup but sin
[1:21:08] has caused you to do that and no matter
[1:21:10] how much you try to impersonate try to
[1:21:12] make a lie seem right they got a
[1:21:14] scientific instrument that proves it's
[1:21:16] still registered negative
[1:21:18] because there's a subconscious
[1:21:21] done in a human being and that
[1:21:23] subconscious knows what's the truth
[1:21:27] no matter what you are saying out here
[1:21:29] the subconscious know it's a lie
[1:21:32] and it registers of the subconscious
[1:21:38] therefore
[1:21:39] if a man or woman could ever get their
[1:21:42] thoughts
[1:21:43] and their testimony
[1:21:45] and their lives so line up with god
[1:21:49] until
[1:21:50] the channel of the holy spirit will be
[1:21:53] so perfectly one with god what would
[1:21:55] take place
[1:21:56] if a man and woman could ever get lined
[1:21:59] up with the freedom from their heart
[1:22:01] with faith from the innermost
[1:22:03] faith from where
[1:22:05] the innermost
[1:22:07] the bible say i desire truth from the
[1:22:09] inward parts
[1:22:11] so god don't want to say god bless you
[1:22:13] and you don't mean it
[1:22:14] you're saying that because believers
[1:22:16] don't say them words
[1:22:18] but you really hate the person you don't
[1:22:20] like the person but you say that to give
[1:22:22] them a water hole
[1:22:29] let's continue are you with me
[1:22:31] anybody sleeping
[1:22:32] get some toothpick and put over your
[1:22:34] eyes and hold it up like this
[1:22:38] people come to the altar to be prayed
[1:22:39] for
[1:22:40] they have intellectual faith aha
[1:22:43] they confess their sins join a church by
[1:22:45] intellectual fate they believe it in
[1:22:47] their mind they believe it because they
[1:22:49] heard it they believe it because they
[1:22:50] know it's the best policy but not what
[1:22:53] god looks at he don't look at your
[1:22:55] intellectual faith
[1:22:58] this one is a big one
[1:23:00] god looks at the
[1:23:03] the heart
[1:23:07] he looks on the heart
[1:23:10] where on the inside when it comes from
[1:23:12] the heart then all things are possible
[1:23:14] then
[1:23:15] oh so you mean really god want to really
[1:23:18] get what's inside of here
[1:23:20] yes it's better you say you're a crook
[1:23:22] and you're a liar and what not that god
[1:23:24] will respect that and love that
[1:23:26] god coming from inside of here then
[1:23:27] there's all kind of corruption inside of
[1:23:29] here and you're making hypocrisy
[1:23:32] i don't want to meet god as a hypocrite
[1:23:35] when the angel asks jacob what is your
[1:23:37] name i'm jacob i'm a deceiver i'm a con
[1:23:39] man i'm a trickster he could tell the
[1:23:42] angel the truth
[1:23:44] the woman of the world she said i have
[1:23:45] none he said you spoke the truth because
[1:23:47] you had four and the one you're living
[1:23:48] with is not yours
[1:23:51] that is what the pharisees and
[1:23:52] strategies did not have
[1:23:54] they didn't have the right kind of a
[1:23:56] heart
[1:23:57] and god is looking at the heart outside
[1:23:59] they're looking very religious and
[1:24:01] looking pious but in the heart crucify
[1:24:03] him crucify you see what come under the
[1:24:05] heart
[1:24:06] when jesus started walking crucify him
[1:24:08] crucify him and the ability
[1:24:11] their books their tapes crucify him
[1:24:13] crucify the manifestation of god for the

[1:28:12] oh get the lord some praises
[1:28:14] [Applause]
[1:28:20] he looks on the inside
[1:28:22] when your confession meets up with your
[1:28:24] life
[1:28:25] that's beautiful
[1:28:27] when your words meet up with your life
[1:28:30] you see you have to profess things first
[1:28:32] your faith follow and god back that up
[1:28:34] but one day you're expected to meet
[1:28:36] your subconscious and conscious line up
[1:28:38] everything line up perfect
[1:28:40] oh glory to god then god faith could
[1:28:41] drop down behind that and give you the
[1:28:43] answer that you need
[1:28:45] let's continue
[1:28:46] when your confession
[1:28:48] says one thing and your life leaves
[1:28:51] another thing that's wrong somewhere
[1:28:53] that's because you got an intellectual
[1:28:54] faith and not a faith from your heart
[1:28:57] and that shows that on the outside there
[1:29:00] is a knowledge of god but inside is a
[1:29:03] demon doubting
[1:29:05] i believe in ivan healing but it's not
[1:29:08] for me you see
[1:29:09] i believe god could heal me you know but
[1:29:11] you know i mean you know my family have
[1:29:13] that anytime especially family have that
[1:29:17] you have some condition you know i mean
[1:29:19] i believe god could heal me you know but
[1:29:20] you see my family my grandfather my
[1:29:22] great grandfather he had it
[1:29:25] anything he talked about he had it and
[1:29:26] she had it and they had it and all of
[1:29:28] them had it it's because you and your
[1:29:29] subconscious saying you know well i have
[1:29:30] to have it too
[1:29:32] you are disconnect from your family
[1:29:34] lineage and your condition in your
[1:29:35] family life
[1:29:37] diabetes the great grandfather the
[1:29:38] grandmother if that is come to the line
[1:29:40] who's it yours
[1:29:42] since when diabetes yours
[1:29:44] god donate that to you that's a gift
[1:29:48] so i'm saying if you're you have it that
[1:29:50] don't mean you have to claim it
[1:29:52] you're claiming have to be for healing
[1:29:54] you're claiming not to be deliverance
[1:29:57] you got claimed because grandpappy had
[1:29:58] it and grandfather had it and great
[1:30:00] grandfather you have it too and it's
[1:30:01] yours it's all that we own your family
[1:30:03] so
[1:30:04] kill that
[1:30:06] kill now tell yourself just change it
[1:30:08] with me
[1:30:09] and from this generation it's changing
[1:30:11] all together prophesy over that

[1:30:16] 120 over 80 are thinking about it
[1:30:20] perfect pressure
[1:30:24] sometimes i think about it i see 157 or
[1:30:26] something
[1:30:29] my feet growing
[1:30:32] oh hallelujah
[1:30:34] but i believe in that i'll come back to
[1:30:36] normal

[1:30:39] i refuse to believe otherwise
[1:30:41] oh glory to god hallelujah you know what
[1:30:44] i'm enjoying i'm doing something about
[1:30:46] it
[1:30:46] i ain't just hoping i'm trusting no no

[1:31:39] shall possess the devil heard that
[1:31:41] possess the case of the enemy the devil
[1:31:43] can identify the seas of abraham but
[1:31:46] here we are in the last days
[1:31:48] we are stepping forward as royalties of
[1:31:50] abraham
[1:31:52] to possess the case of the enemy to
[1:31:53] possess sickness to possess whatever
[1:31:56] [Music]
[1:31:59] to take the kids away
[1:32:01] [Applause]
[1:32:04] when your confession say is intellectual
[1:32:05] faith all right let's continue
[1:32:09] but
[1:32:10] this is in the trip report and now
[1:32:12] first is a thought he spoke a word and
[1:32:15] when jesus came out of the hill he said
[1:32:16] no man eater from these spoke a word
[1:32:18] went on and then watch
[1:32:20] god's mind that mind that in the
[1:32:22] beginning was what was the thought
[1:32:24] before it was expressed as a word
[1:32:26] what
[1:32:27] and every word in the bible is god's
[1:32:29] thoughts lean in seed form let me say it
[1:32:30] again every word
[1:32:33] in the bible
[1:32:35] is god's thoughts lean in seed form
[1:32:40] every word
[1:32:42] that means god can interpret any
[1:32:44] scripture in your life
[1:32:47] let me say it again this is important
[1:32:49] listen you could god could give you a
[1:32:51] scripture and interpret that scripture
[1:32:53] in your life personally to you that have
[1:32:55] nothing to do with anybody else
[1:32:56] [Applause]
[1:32:59] [Music]
[1:33:01] god could give you i am the lord thy god
[1:33:03] that he lady i heal you
[1:33:06] that is your word and you run with it
[1:33:08] and you heal all together just by your
[1:33:10] word from the lord god give you that
[1:33:11] scripture and you're healed
[1:33:14] [Music]
[1:33:14] [Applause]
[1:33:16] [Music]
[1:33:18] you can give your scripture i will not
[1:33:19] give you comfortness
[1:33:21] and give you a comfort in your heart and
[1:33:23] your spirit
[1:33:24] and you're comforted by the word of god
[1:33:26] let's continue every word in the bible
[1:33:29] is god's thoughts lean in seed form
[1:33:31] and if
[1:33:33] received into the human being and spoke
[1:33:37] by the same thought that materialized
[1:33:39] the bible it brings the things to pass
[1:33:41] you see what i mean
[1:33:43] how powerful could the church be
[1:33:46] the bible said let this mind that was in
[1:33:49] christ being you
[1:33:51] allow it to be in you
[1:33:53] let it work through you
[1:33:55] claim it ask for it you want it
[1:33:58] you don't want your mind you want his
[1:33:59] mind and the bible give it permission to
[1:34:02] have it by the bible saying let this
[1:34:04] mind i was in christ
[1:34:06] oh glory to god i expect more amens than
[1:34:09] that
[1:34:10] it's saying let this mind i was in
[1:34:12] christ be in you
[1:34:13] you have a right to have the mind of
[1:34:15] christ
[1:34:17] nothing wrong for that nothing wrong in
[1:34:19] asking for that i want your mind in this
[1:34:22] matter i want your mind in the situation
[1:34:24] i want your mind
[1:34:26] [Applause]
[1:34:29] [Music]
[1:34:34] does a man think it oh good
[1:34:37] prophet
[1:34:39] as a man think it in his heart so is he
[1:34:41] so your thoughts become expression
[1:34:45] your thinking
[1:34:47] so your thinking literally have to do
[1:34:49] with the environment of your life
[1:34:54] and as a gardener tends to garden and
[1:34:56] clean up weeds and and award weeds is so
[1:34:59] you have to hold the weeds in your mind
[1:35:02] if you don't tend that garden the devil
[1:35:04] will put seeds you'll get all kind of
[1:35:05] crop inside your mind and you'll read a
[1:35:07] harvest of what's in your mind in your
[1:35:10] spirit you're going to speak it you're
[1:35:11] going to materialize you'll get the
[1:35:12] fruit of it
[1:35:14] but as a man taking his heart always
[1:35:16] here
[1:35:17] oh glory to god if you have evil
[1:35:19] thoughts either thing in your mind and
[1:35:21] you're taking old stuff you'll read the
[1:35:23] harvest of that
[1:35:25] because your mind
[1:35:27] like a garden not being clean not being
[1:35:29] cleansed not being
[1:35:31] channeled that's why the bible said be
[1:35:32] transformed
[1:35:34] by the renewing of your mind
[1:35:36] oh glory to god that you might prove
[1:35:38] what is that good and acceptable will of
[1:35:40] god your mind have to be renewed if you
[1:35:43] could get a changed mind you could get a
[1:35:44] changed life if they could get a changed
[1:35:46] mind you could get a change walk if they
[1:35:48] get a changed mind you can get a change
[1:35:50] talk but some people don't want to
[1:35:52] change their mind because they love all
[1:35:54] they think they love what they say they
[1:35:56] love what they do they can't be taught
[1:35:59] it can't be spoken to
[1:36:01] hallelujah praise god
[1:36:04] hallelujah
[1:36:06] jesus they have faith in god for very
[1:36:08] nice unto you if you shall say to this
[1:36:10] monk then be moved cast into the sea
[1:36:12] don't doubt in your heart in your heart
[1:36:14] don't doubt that the doubt
[1:36:15] don't doubt where nothing ahead in your
[1:36:17] heart
[1:36:18] you can have what you say
[1:36:20] is that right
[1:36:21] not
[1:36:22] me you shall have it
[1:36:25] what power has been given to the church
[1:36:28] no here we go i know this morning that i
[1:36:30] was teaching there's a special service
[1:36:31] this morning
[1:36:33] i know it but i come to bring it
[1:36:35] now you can express this by mental
[1:36:38] conception
[1:36:41] by speaking the word and seeing this and
[1:36:42] seeing this
[1:36:44] but mental
[1:36:45] but if here we go kindly it becomes a
[1:36:49] real revelation of god
[1:36:52] you see it before it happens
[1:36:58] brother branham described abraham coming
[1:37:00] to the fullness of believing
[1:37:04] so after 25 years of testifying above
[1:37:06] her son
[1:37:08] elohim came known to tell abram i
[1:37:11] will return unto zee
[1:37:14] according to the time of life
[1:37:16] in other words your 25 years of testing
[1:37:19] is run out
[1:37:20] i come to give some encouragement
[1:37:22] i have come to give you my religion
[1:37:24] right now i come to tell you the time is
[1:37:26] upon you
[1:37:27] it's a time of life
[1:37:28] so abraham was comforted
[1:37:31] just like when jesus opened the
[1:37:33] understanding to his disciples
[1:37:34] opened the word his disciples and
[1:37:37] comforted them with the word and said
[1:37:38] receiving the holy ghost and then tell
[1:37:41] selem sorry in the city of jerusalem and
[1:37:44] till you be entered pour from on high as
[1:37:46] just as jesus released that to them they
[1:37:49] went up with joy
[1:37:50] the same jesus was taken up
[1:37:53] but they were happy they were not sad
[1:37:56] now because their thoughts have been
[1:37:57] cleared up
[1:37:59] their revelation has been sealed in
[1:38:00] their heart they know what they was
[1:38:03] going to receive
[1:38:04] so they had no doubt in the upper room
[1:38:07] they were expecting the power from on
[1:38:09] high not a man shaking their hand power
[1:38:11] from on high they were under tremendous
[1:38:13] expectation
[1:38:15] all glory to god
[1:38:16] and when the day of pentecost was fully
[1:38:19] come
[1:38:20] they were in one mind they were in one
[1:38:21] accord they were in one channel
[1:38:24] everybody in the same position
[1:38:26] oh god said so god said so they're
[1:38:28] encouraging one another
[1:38:30] with what the lord said
[1:38:32] oh give the lord some praises
[1:38:35] fire came upon every one of them
[1:38:37] everyone received their portion and i
[1:38:40] want every one of you today to receive
[1:38:41] your portion
[1:38:42] oh glory to god hallelujah
[1:38:45] hallelujah
[1:38:46] [Applause]
[1:38:47] so watch if it becomes a real revelation
[1:38:50] then you see it before it happened
[1:38:52] and express it in word form
[1:38:54] that word takes a whole and make it
[1:38:56] becomes material
[1:38:58] express
[1:38:59] and when your heart listen and your mind
[1:39:02] is so filled with god's spirit
[1:39:05] till your thoughts become his thoughts
[1:39:08] when your mind and your leading and your
[1:39:10] guiding becomes a direct place or a
[1:39:13] direct inspiration of the holy spirit
[1:39:15] that is moving in your mortal being what
[1:39:18] kind of people ought we to be
[1:39:20] this is not coming the church and
[1:39:21] bowling about jacob and moses and israel
[1:39:24] no this is life now
[1:39:25] because all those guys is only typing
[1:39:27] out a portion of life
[1:39:29] a portion of god's life
[1:39:30] david was a testimony of god's life as a
[1:39:33] psalmist oh glory lord god all them
[1:39:36] brothers that they're part to play
[1:39:37] abraham fate isaac love jacob grace to
[1:39:41] the perfection they always demonstrate
[1:39:44] in life
[1:39:45] through words
[1:39:46] through history through testimony
[1:39:49] through books through witness but
[1:39:51] there's only stress in life so when
[1:39:53] jesus came he said i come that you might
[1:39:56] have life
[1:39:57] and have it more abundantly he come to
[1:40:00] bring life to them he know they was in
[1:40:02] danger they were dying
[1:40:04] hallelujah kept in a prison
[1:40:07] all glory to god and when he died he set
[1:40:10] every captive free
[1:40:12] that was bonds that he couldn't release
[1:40:14] he released abraham he released isaac
[1:40:17] all of them was underground undercover
[1:40:19] but he set them free
[1:40:21] bring them up into the sixth dimension
[1:40:23] oh give the lord a shout
[1:40:25] he made our way
[1:40:26] glory to god
[1:40:28] now when we die we know where we going
[1:40:32] [Applause]
[1:40:37] glory to god hallelujah you might be
[1:40:39] seated
[1:40:40] three steps down three steps up
[1:40:42] hallelujah
[1:40:44] glory to god
[1:40:46] the reason of the lost
[1:40:48] demons
[1:40:50] devil himself
[1:40:51] above that the reason of the blessed
[1:40:54] angels and god himself
[1:40:56] and you on earth in between
[1:40:58] oh glory to god force is pulling down
[1:41:00] and forcible enough

[1:53:28] see abraham let's see a lot walking
[1:53:30] white behind me between me
[1:53:32] and mrs lut
[1:53:35] you see what was in our heart
[1:53:39] you know what overture misses that
[1:53:41] her heart
[1:53:44] she know judgement going on strike
[1:53:46] she saw angelic activity to tell her it
[1:53:49] is that serious
[1:53:51] but yet in her heart she wanted one more
[1:53:53] look
[1:53:54] but hold up hold the container here
[1:53:57] undyne putting special colors in it
[1:54:00] she wanted to see one more look at the
[1:54:01] hot pants on a mini skirt and
[1:54:03] whatever it is the tattoos
[1:54:06] the neighbor outside ringing those mud
[1:54:09] air is all about
[1:54:10] she wanted one last look
[1:54:13] when she looked
[1:54:14] i like your daughters you know
[1:54:16] she turned mommy turned into a pillar of
[1:54:18] sword
[1:54:18] and the daughters was wise enough to
[1:54:20] know don't even look at that just keep
[1:54:21] walking
[1:54:23] then we're looking left or right mommy
[1:54:25] gone
[1:54:28] mommy gone
[1:54:30] mommy gone mommy reap what she saw mommy
[1:54:32] gone my heart over throw her
[1:54:34] lot in his children got out
[1:54:37] and jesus said remember lot's wife
[1:54:41] [Applause]
[1:54:43] this is not a game
[1:54:44] and this service is not a play service
[1:54:47] remember lot's wife
[1:54:50] oh glory to god hallelujah
[1:55:02] and the reason lot got that deliverance
[1:55:05] the only reason that got that
[1:55:06] breakthrough
[1:55:07] is because abraham
[1:55:10] was interceding before god
[1:55:13] not because god comforted latino because
[1:55:15] abraham
[1:55:16] because of who he was
[1:55:20] god said shall i hide from abraham
[1:55:22] what i'm about to do because i cannot
[1:55:24] hide
[1:55:26] i cannot hide
[1:55:28] what i'm about to do from my elect
[1:55:31] that's why you should not forsake the
[1:55:32] assembling of yourself together because
[1:55:35] revelation gonna break from here
[1:55:37] that god will reveal his will
[1:55:39] and his mind
[1:55:40] all glory to god hallelujah
[1:55:43] when god removes saul he said i've found
[1:55:46] a man
[1:55:47] after my own heart
[1:55:49] that will do my will
[1:55:52] [Applause]
[1:55:57] so it's not a matter of man after my um
[1:56:00] a heart
[1:56:02] to do
[1:56:04] his will
[1:56:06] do you have the kind of heart
[1:56:08] that you're willing to do god's will
[1:56:11] whatever god tell you to do you want to
[1:56:14] do it
[1:56:15] you're interested into it
[1:56:17] you want you out of the way
[1:56:19] a shy that's you
[1:56:21] that's not god
[1:56:23] i never do that before that's you that's
[1:56:25] not god
[1:56:26] what you want is his will
[1:56:30] [Music]
[1:56:32] as soon as samuel anointed david
[1:56:35] the bible said the spirit of god
[1:56:39] came upon him
[1:56:41] he was anointed in the presence of his
[1:56:43] brethren
[1:56:46] all of them were witnesses
[1:56:48] of the oil upon
[1:56:50] david
[1:56:51] and david went back to his sheep
[1:56:54] anointed
[1:56:55] with god
[1:56:57] anointed with the spirit
[1:57:00] oh glory to god
[1:57:02] he wasn't in yet
[1:57:04] but he was anointed to be king
[1:57:07] and the bible said god has made us
[1:57:10] kings and priests
[1:57:12] [Music]
[1:57:13] and we shall reign on the earth
[1:57:16] and you want to tell me i can preach i
[1:57:18] can shout at this this morning when i
[1:57:21] know
[1:57:22] that he has made us thus
[1:57:25] it is his will it is his purpose it is
[1:57:28] his mind
[1:57:31] that we be kings and priests
[1:57:32] [Applause]
[1:57:35] all the potentials lock up inside of you
[1:57:38] my god
[1:57:40] [Applause]
[1:57:47] prophecy
[1:57:51] afraid to check where i reach
[1:58:01] i believe it's on its road
[1:58:04] when the church will be so wrapped in
[1:58:07] christ
[1:58:09] the holy spirit
[1:58:11] mankind show away from themselves that
[1:58:13] they don't see themselves
[1:58:16] but to serve god
[1:58:18] their thoughts move on
[1:58:20] they refuse the things of the world
[1:58:22] they just move in the spirit
[1:58:24] live in the spirit
[1:58:26] walk in the spirit
[1:58:28] so fulfill the law of christ then the
[1:58:30] love of christ in the human heart
[1:58:33] moving in the holy ghost that great
[1:58:36] wonderful church will go forth with
[1:58:38] power and deity because deity will be
[1:58:42] revealed in human beings
[1:58:44] by by by the holy spirit bringing to
[1:58:48] pass the thought of their mind
[1:58:51] and the prophet said the ministry
[1:58:53] has reached its perfection
[1:58:56] when christ is revealed again
[1:58:59] among human beings
[1:59:01] in the natural
[1:59:04] [Applause]
[1:59:05] in other words the word has to become
[1:59:08] flesh again
[1:59:09] [Applause]
[1:59:11] and when the word becomes flesh
[1:59:14] the invisible becomes visible
[1:59:17] god help me this morning
[1:59:20] [Applause]
[1:59:25] let me say it again
[1:59:27] [Music]
[1:59:28] god was invisible until the word becomes
[1:59:31] flesh
[1:59:32] and when the word become flesh the
[1:59:34] invisible becomes visible
[1:59:36] god becomes material
[1:59:38] so god wants to get dead man he want to
[1:59:40] get man out of the way
[1:59:42] oh glory to god
[1:59:44] and god will remove all fleshly souls of
[1:59:47] the kingdom you're going to bomb them
[1:59:49] off
[1:59:50] knock them off
[1:59:52] he's going to take them off
[1:59:53] and you're going to raise up some davids
[2:00:00] my lord this is too much today
[2:00:11] when you come so dead to the things of
[2:00:13] the world
[2:00:14] that christ is first
[2:00:16] christ is all
[2:00:18] then your entire makeup is of the spirit
[2:00:21] of the lord jesus
[2:00:22] he has full control
[2:00:24] that's when your thoughts will be clean
[2:00:27] your torch will be pure
[2:00:29] your heart some people say well religion
[2:00:31] comes from the heart
[2:00:34] he said there is no mental faculties
[2:00:37] called heart you can't think with your
[2:00:38] heart babies as a man taking his heart
[2:00:41] and he said jesus
[2:00:42] wasn't speaking of the physical being
[2:00:45] he was speaking of the supernatural
[2:00:46] being
[2:00:48] we are truthful being soul body spirit
[2:00:50] we know that this what is flesh is we
[2:00:52] realize that it's here we know what the
[2:00:54] spirit it is the spirit control
[2:00:58] the flesh
[2:00:59] but what is the soul
[2:01:01] he said the soul
[2:01:03] is the nature of the spirit
[2:01:09] so born again means you need a change
[2:01:14] a new life
[2:01:16] oh hallelujah
[2:01:19] if you notice here we go
[2:01:21] the subconscious
[2:01:22] is where you live
[2:01:27] not at the conscious level
[2:01:29] your real you is
[2:01:31] subconscious
[2:01:33] that's where you live that's the reason
[2:01:34] people say it's hard for them to have
[2:01:35] faith yes i got faith but don yeah it's
[2:01:38] saying not for you
[2:01:39] well this fellow say i believe god heals
[2:01:42] and subconsciously but it's not for you
[2:01:44] you see are you sure you're not going
[2:01:47] anywhere you're running a circle because
[2:01:48] the mind saying something but the spirit
[2:01:51] says something else the nine saying i
[2:01:53] believe but the hearts saying have
[2:01:55] affect to go next week
[2:01:59] so there's a problem going on
[2:02:01] you know this is right but this is of
[2:02:02] the mental here they already had a gc
[2:02:04] and you see xc and the doctor degree
[2:02:06] everything right here so
[2:02:09] then earlier you know
[2:02:11] god put something inside of here to
[2:02:12] taste
[2:02:14] for god
[2:02:15] some people replace that taste for god
[2:02:17] with women with money with popularity
[2:02:19] with basketball football cricket with
[2:02:22] with love for this and love for that
[2:02:23] they love animals
[2:02:25] they put it to us for god they love to
[2:02:27] climb they climb in mount everest to
[2:02:28] climb in here
[2:02:30] some politics politician god for
[2:02:31] parachuting and jumping from the sky all
[2:02:33] about
[2:02:34] they give them a trailer
[2:02:38] some people like stephen so they're
[2:02:39] going to stay in the city
[2:02:41] some people like to see they can't wait
[2:02:42] every day
[2:02:44] they feel like they really fish or
[2:02:45] something
[2:02:48] but they're not in church but sunday
[2:02:49] morning there by the sea
[2:02:52] the devil twists their minds
[2:02:55] god god put that twist inside idea let
[2:02:57] me continue
[2:02:59] you say watch
[2:03:01] they don't think of something they're
[2:03:02] thinking about healing it's not their
[2:03:04] intellect here working it is
[2:03:06] subconscious working your subconscious
[2:03:08] is your soul
[2:03:11] so the subconscious is the real you
[2:03:15] so watch when it lines up like i say i
[2:03:17] make a reference you and your wife
[2:03:19] having a quarrel inside
[2:03:21] and you know
[2:03:23] it's not going very nice and somebody
[2:03:24] knock on the door
[2:03:25] or ring the doorbell
[2:03:27] and you open it on your smile god bless
[2:03:31] no
[2:03:31] what going on there now is that not the
[2:03:33] real thing you know
[2:03:34] there's a piece of acting going on
[2:03:36] there's a hollywood there's a there's a
[2:03:37] movie going on right now
[2:03:39] so when the calling going on instead of
[2:03:42] getting that right and and and correct
[2:03:44] and everything else we go outside and
[2:03:46] say we can like
[2:03:48] olive oil is well
[2:03:51] but all not very well
[2:03:52] the emotion all is well but he had said
[2:03:54] god i just get thundering saturday boy
[2:03:56] and when you smile here's no you're
[2:03:58] going back to the battlefield
[2:04:00] right back to where left off but the
[2:04:02] subconscious is your soul
[2:04:04] hallelujah
[2:04:06] [Music]
[2:04:13] the soul attracts
[2:04:15] what it secretly harbors
[2:04:18] that is why but imam says what your fear
[2:04:21] happened
[2:04:22] and what you believe happen
[2:04:24] see if the soul have the fear
[2:04:26] it attracts that life
[2:04:27] life wakes up that if the soul have the
[2:04:30] faith it just push away everything else
[2:04:33] it's from the soul
[2:04:35] from the subconscious level
[2:04:38] the mind have to change
[2:04:40] your thinking have to change
[2:04:42] you have to want to get out of moxie
[2:04:43] mode
[2:04:44] mode
[2:04:45] and and the excuse mode you have to want
[2:04:48] to come up with that and stop looking
[2:04:49] that you don't have the resources you
[2:04:50] don't have this stop looking at what you
[2:04:52] don't have
[2:04:54] question what do you have
[2:04:58] five thousand people to feed five loaves
[2:05:00] two fishes what do you have
[2:05:02] jesus took the five loaves two fishes
[2:05:03] bless it share it
[2:05:05] stop looking at what you don't have
[2:05:07] say lord give me fresh eyes to view
[2:05:10] what's around me what i have
[2:05:13] [Applause]
[2:05:15] think
[2:05:16] differently
[2:05:17] you just we shouldn't please i want to
[2:05:18] kind of wrap up here
[2:05:22] so what you say happens
[2:05:24] what you believe happens
[2:05:27] every
[2:05:28] thought soul
[2:05:31] that goes into the mind will have a root
[2:05:33] would have a fruit
[2:05:35] i will i can i do believe
[2:05:37] do you not believe
[2:05:39] you have to believe isn't that right
[2:05:41] glory to god
[2:05:43] so therefore truly circumstances doesn't
[2:05:46] make the man
[2:05:48] it shows what the man is
[2:05:51] people have so much excuses about life
[2:05:53] this is why i saw my grandfather my
[2:05:55] grandmother the neighbor teachers didn't
[2:05:57] like me in school that why i didn't
[2:05:58] learn
[2:05:59] no no no that's an excuse you didn't
[2:06:02] want to learn
[2:06:05] just as a weak man
[2:06:07] where training could become strong
[2:06:10] but discipline could exercise and get
[2:06:12] muscles and everything else just so a
[2:06:14] weak mind could be trained
[2:06:16] to become strong
[2:06:18] the birds may rest on your head and
[2:06:20] bring thoughts but don't let them unless
[2:06:22] there
[2:06:23] don't be so weak for them to build a
[2:06:24] badness in your head
[2:06:26] with a certain negative thoughts that
[2:06:28] you can't override and
[2:06:30] that's why hollywood is so dangerous
[2:06:32] even for the children
[2:06:33] you have to be careful with hollywood
[2:06:35] because what can i say tannics and all
[2:06:36] kind of people writing movies
[2:06:38] and hollywood is a channel to get
[2:06:40] thoughts in people's mind
[2:06:41] and so are the songs and people have
[2:06:43] these things stick up in the air listen
[2:06:45] to songs all day
[2:06:47] and they have messages in the songs it
[2:06:49] have seats going through the songs the
[2:06:51] devil using any means necessary when you
[2:06:54] come to churches or two hours what time
[2:06:56] is that when you leave here they develop
[2:06:58] in your night and day
[2:07:00] 24 7. you're not getting this all the
[2:07:02] time you know that's why you have the
[2:07:04] resources on the internet to go into the
[2:07:05] channel and look back on youtube at the
[2:07:06] messages
[2:07:07] to listen back to things they didn't
[2:07:09] hear
[2:07:10] talk back over that your mind be
[2:07:12] saturated with the word of god
[2:07:14] then when they're saturated like that
[2:07:15] the devil have no room to move
[2:07:17] because you're a genuine believer
[2:07:22] glory to god
[2:07:24] so your mind could be cultivated
[2:07:29] columbus i believe he could sail the
[2:07:30] world and he did it
[2:07:32] everybody who had great achievement
[2:07:35] they believed it could be done
[2:07:37] the wright brothers believed they could
[2:07:38] fly
[2:07:39] they're tired of your horse and buggy
[2:07:41] and of course when they try to fly the
[2:07:42] first thing crash it always does
[2:07:45] your first attempt at righteousness will
[2:07:46] crash but it always does but that does
[2:07:48] stop you from pressing on
[2:07:50] you keep on pressing on
[2:07:52] when the wright brothers tried to fly
[2:07:54] people laugh at them
[2:07:56] but guess what we have airplanes now
[2:07:58] because somebody believed it could be
[2:07:59] done
[2:08:00] hallelujah
[2:08:02] in that flambo and limelight and
[2:08:04] somebody believe they get electric light
[2:08:06] and they press until they get that
[2:08:09] all leukemia and typhoid fever all the
[2:08:11] doctors that believe they could cut a
[2:08:13] cure for that they did it
[2:08:15] because they believe it
[2:08:16] before it happened they believe it
[2:08:18] [Music]
[2:08:20] let me say that before it happened they
[2:08:21] believe it could be done
[2:08:25] like i understand they got a cure for
[2:08:26] ebola
[2:08:27] somebody have to believe it could be
[2:08:29] done
[2:08:30] somebody believe they could go beyond
[2:08:31] plane and go up past the atmosphere into
[2:08:34] the astronaut age and they got out of
[2:08:37] people i believe we could go beyond
[2:08:38] churchianity be done beyond methodist
[2:08:40] and baptism pentecostal beyond that
[2:08:44] into the realm of the manifestations of
[2:08:46] the sons of god you have to want that

[2:10:22] here
[2:10:23] both hear the same word
[2:10:25] the bible said israel heard the word
[2:10:28] but the word wasn't mixed with faith
[2:10:34] so everybody could be hearing it but
[2:10:35] it's those who have faith to mix that
[2:10:37] word
[2:10:38] to bring it alive
[2:10:41] hallelujah
[2:10:44] that subconscious or just going quickly

[2:11:36] of something here and i could hardly
[2:11:38] drop off here now on my way watch watch
[2:11:41] the biggest part of our fate is mental
[2:11:43] fate
[2:11:44] by hearing the word it brings us to a
[2:11:46] mental recognition of god
[2:11:48] but if it ever strikes from by the holy
[2:11:50] spirit it becomes a a spiritual faith
[2:11:54] hallelujah do you believe that
[2:11:56] glory to god in the beginning was the
[2:11:57] word
[2:11:58] so watch when the holy spirit comes down
[2:12:00] then the word itself is pouring into our
[2:12:02] faith our mental fate become the spirit
[2:12:04] of revelation and that become the rock
[2:12:07] so you're not coming to church because
[2:12:08] your father coming on your mother coming
[2:12:09] because you have a revelation now that's
[2:12:11] why you're coming you're worshiping
[2:12:13] because you have a revelation you're not
[2:12:15] looking to see who is in the hand who is
[2:12:16] in the hand or she is raised behind too
[2:12:18] no no you're raising your hand because
[2:12:20] you want to raise your hand you stand up
[2:12:21] because you want to stand up it has
[2:12:23] nothing to do with the person in front
[2:12:24] of you at the side of you you have your
[2:12:26] revelation
[2:12:28] oh glory to god hallelujah
[2:12:31] do you believe that
[2:12:33] says the holy spirit made the ephesus
[2:12:34] church
[2:12:35] but the smyrna church the holy spirit
[2:12:37] gives the pokemon church all is the holy
[2:12:39] spirit it's been the holy spirit in this
[2:12:41] age and watch from your faith and then
[2:12:44] when the capstone comes the holy spirit
[2:12:47] seizes together so watch number one
[2:12:49] number one coming from your mental fate
[2:12:52] tongue comes the holy spirit into your
[2:12:54] mental faith and makes it a spiritual
[2:12:56] fate
[2:12:57] hallelujah
[2:12:59] then the spiritual faith only recognizes
[2:13:01] the word amen hallelujah do you believe
[2:13:04] that
[2:13:05] praise the name of the lord
[2:13:07] the spiritual faith only recognizes the
[2:13:09] word
[2:13:10] praise god i know i had something here
[2:13:12] to share with you oh glory to god
[2:13:14] hallelujah
[2:13:16] praise god praise god
[2:13:21] hebrews 10 26 says if we sin willfully
[2:13:24] after we have received the knowledge of
[2:13:26] truth there remain no more sacrifice for
[2:13:29] sin now the power i want to get here is
[2:13:31] the knowledge of the truth
[2:13:33] so the knowledge of the truth is not the
[2:13:35] truth yet
[2:13:36] until you get the spirit of the truth
[2:13:39] [Music]
[2:13:41] i want to get that in
[2:13:42] today you have to get the knowledge of
[2:13:45] the truth
[2:13:47] seven seal knowledge
[2:13:49] seven thunder knowledge
[2:13:50] mystery knowledge
[2:13:52] knowledge of the bible
[2:13:53] it's not of the truth but when the
[2:13:55] spirit of truth comes that is the true
[2:13:57] knowledge
[2:14:01] because the knowledge could just opt to
[2:14:02] be all intellectual
[2:14:04] but when the spirit of truth come you
[2:14:06] have revelation you have an experience
[2:14:09] not just truth but the spirit of truth
[2:14:12] and jesus said when he the spirit of
[2:14:14] jesus come he would lead you and guide
[2:14:16] you into all truth
[2:14:18] which is a continuation of the knowledge
[2:14:19] of truth
[2:14:20] oh get the lord
[2:14:22] give the lord a shout
[2:14:24] hallelujah because now you are empowered
[2:14:27] by the spirit of truth
[2:14:29] to guide you
[2:14:31] into all truth
[2:14:32] no longer intellectual thing it's a
[2:14:35] personal revelation of god
[2:14:37] oh hallelujah praise god
[2:14:40] thank you lord thank you lord
[2:14:42] deuteronomy 29 29 the secret things
[2:14:44] belong unto the lord our god but those
[2:14:46] things that are revealed belonging to us
[2:14:48] and to our children forever that we
[2:14:50] might do all the works of the lord
[2:14:52] oh glory to god do you believe that
[2:14:55] hallelujah so from your faith up to the
[2:14:57] holy spirit look at here faith
[2:15:00] up to the holy spirit
[2:15:01] that seals you in with christ
[2:15:03] then you become one
[2:15:05] watch then that's a sealed unit of the
[2:15:07] lord god
[2:15:08] then they are vindicated and placed
[2:15:11] when that time comes they become
[2:15:12] vindicated sons
[2:15:14] and daughters of god
[2:15:16] right now you are sons and daughters but
[2:15:17] when that time comes you become a
[2:15:18] vindicated son vindicate the daughter of
[2:15:21] god the same devil that was busted back
[2:15:23] there he will get busted again this time

[2:15:48] or wrong him he didn't have one of these
[2:15:50] big intellectual degrees well trained
[2:15:52] saul was the best he could have had high
[2:15:55] header shoulders above the rest of the
[2:15:56] army so was a tall guy and today we know
[2:15:59] we need a revival we know we need a

[2:16:02] take a doctor with divinity it will take
[2:16:04] weakness it will take it will take a
[2:16:06] weak person that will take the word of
[2:16:08] god in the power of the resurrection he
[2:16:10] said it will take we need a david
[2:16:12] untrained in theological schools we need
[2:16:14] a man who knows nothing about that some
[2:16:17] little boy somewhere somewhere
[2:16:19] stupid shoulders nothing much to look at
[2:16:21] but will come along with the power of
[2:16:23] god
[2:16:24] god is not in big words god isn't on his
[2:16:26] heart he said i am the high and lofty
[2:16:28] one that dwell with him i have a humble
[2:16:30] heart out of a contrite spirit it takes

[2:16:52] degrees by what your education is not
[2:16:54] right by your dress
[2:16:57] by your unique ability and gifts
[2:16:59] but god has the ability to see
[2:17:01] inside the person's heart
[2:17:03] so when elijah came in front of samuel
[2:17:06] the prophet
[2:17:07] and he said surely that is god anointed
[2:17:10] god said no no no not too fast
[2:17:13] not so fast
[2:17:15] don't look at the outward appearance
[2:17:17] because i'm looking at the heart
[2:17:20] that gave samuel a bit of discernment
[2:17:22] to see for the quickening power to give
[2:17:24] witness
[2:17:25] of the man that was passing before him
[2:17:28] and brother after brother pass
[2:17:30] until samuel said isn't there any more

[2:17:37] he oh my he said i don't see us
[2:17:40] he doesn't see us human see oh david was
[2:17:43] god's choice
[2:17:45] hallelujah
[2:17:46] and david
[2:17:47] develop a heart after god
[2:17:50] he says the heart pant after the water
[2:17:52] brook
[2:17:53] so my soul tastes after the living god
