[50:50] Christ and the church says amen and amen
[50:54] you may be seated for a few minutes
[50:57] amen welcome to the house of the Lord
[51:00] this morning it's certainly great to be
[51:03] in the house of the Lord
[51:04] how many appreciate a message last week
[51:07] from our pastor what a masterpiece
[51:10] what an anointing our burden is busy
[51:13] appreciate your pastor
[51:15] a many many many many men four Watchmen
[51:20] in the tower a man with a burden to see
[51:25] lives change transform to see God do
[51:29] something real in your soul and for a
[51:32] burden for the upcoming convention we
[51:34] under great expectation for God to do
[51:36] something tremendous and I've been going
[51:39] through my own experience as it were in
[51:42] the word where and some time ago I said
[51:46] I want you to speak on on a topic on the
[51:49] way brother Branham lived because I
[51:52] found that message believers take what
[51:58] they want from the message and the
[52:00] Missis the way that brother Branham
[52:03] lived because it's the life behind the
[52:08] name that makes the demons tremble you
[52:10] could read you could talk you could know
[52:13] doctrine you could exegete the
[52:15] scriptures you could cut the Bible you
[52:19] could be able to put quotes together in
[52:22] such a sequence that it will take your
[52:24] head to another dimension but if there's
[52:26] no life behind that you're wasting time
[52:30] and but the branham's message was love
[52:33] it was it was loved I've reached out to
[52:35] the sinner it was love that went out to
[52:39] the loss it was love that would minister
[52:41] to the young people there was a burden
[52:43] to see lives change and transform them
[52:46] beloved send me some quotes this morning
[52:49] and I believe it probably came her
[52:50] brother kindly at first but I just want
[52:52] to touch in it and then say a few things
[52:54] to key in before I get to the message
[52:56] this morning from the message to you and
[52:58] welcome Christ but the Branham was
[53:01] seeing now some time ago I tell you what
[53:02] you know what my theology is and where
[53:05] Branham says his theology is redeeming
[53:07] love that's his theology and that's my
[53:11] theology this morning redeeming love he
[53:13] said when you got love one for another
[53:15] see no matter what these other things
[53:18] are how many gifts we got how much this
[53:21] we got or how much that if we haven't
[53:24] got love one for another we are lost
[53:27] now that's an absolute statement there's
[53:30] no room for interpretation there's no
[53:31] room for you to get your own perspective
[53:34] on what that statement means doesn't
[53:36] matter who you are the Prophet said if
[53:38] we haven't got love one for another we
[53:40] are lost that's all and as if the
[53:43] sentence before ended with we are lost
[53:45] he confirmed the gravity of the
[53:47] statement by saying that's all
[53:49] in other words end all the other
[53:51] arguments if you don't have love you're
[53:53] missing the whole picture now where the
[53:56] random goes on to make clear what he's
[53:58] referring to he says I went to a fellow
[54:00] now brethren I'm using Church names here
[54:03] this morning I don't mean harm by it but
[54:05] I went to a fella that belong to the
[54:07] Assemblies of God he didn't know me it's
[54:10] been years ago I walked up to him and I
[54:12] said howdy-do sir he said howdy-do I
[54:14] said I understand you're a preacher he
[54:17] said I am and just before the a great
[54:20] man in the Assemblies of God he wanted
[54:22] me to join the Assemblies of God he said
[54:24] come join because we had a biggest
[54:26] Pentecostal organization in the world I
[54:28] said that may be so my brother but I
[54:31] like to stand between all of you and say
[54:34] we are brothers see I said I may be way
[54:38] off the road on some of mine you may be
[54:41] true but let's be brothers anyhow see
[54:44] let's be brothers and he said oh he said
[54:47] all right we got the church so I just
[54:49] happened to investigate I went up to a
[54:51] fellow I just taken the negative side on
[54:54] both sides to test out so brother
[54:56] Branham is testing I went up to her
[54:58] brother this brother I said hey I'm here
[55:00] you belong to the Assemblies of God a
[55:02] minister he said I am he said what are
[55:04] you I said I'm a Baptist and he said
[55:07] well have you received the Holy Ghost I
[55:08] said yes
[55:09] I said I received the Holy Ghost he said
[55:12] you speak in tongues I said yeah yeah he
[55:14] spoke in tongues he said brother you
[55:15] have caught it hallelujah praise the
[55:17] Lord that's it and I said well yeah I
[55:20] said I received the Holy Ghost and spoke
[55:22] in tongues and for the evidence a bit
[55:24] and I said he said or you'll come out of
[55:26] that old stiff formal Baptist Church
[55:28] then hallelujah and he spoke in tongues
[55:30] a few times I said yeah I received the
[55:33] Holy Ghost was baptized in Jesus
[55:34] Christ's name he said you what I said I
[55:38] received the Holy Ghost and I was
[55:40] baptized
[55:41] Jesus Christ name he said you don't get
[55:42] the Holy Ghost like that I said you told
[55:46] me a little too late' I've done done it
[55:51] he said I just just done done that he
[55:55] said oh you can't get that like jacked
[55:57] he said you believe that kind of heresy
[55:59] see I said I wouldn't call it heresy I
[56:03] said it teaches it in the Bible he said
[56:05] get out of my house I don't want nothing
[56:08] to do with you I said okay the Lord be
[56:10] with you brother and walked out when I
[56:13] ran and went on he said not long ago an
[56:15] old Baptist preacher out there that was
[56:18] my first trip to Phoenix Curtis I went
[56:20] to see this old boy walked into him and
[56:22] I said how do you do sir he said how do
[56:24] you do he said I heard you're a Baptist
[56:26] preacher way back over there at the time
[56:28] when that little old boy back there in
[56:30] that place was healed without long
[56:32] troubled black where that cubicle of
[56:34] places back there forgot a name of the
[56:36] place and so I just said I hear you're
[56:38] Baptist picture he said yeah I said have
[56:40] you received the Holy Ghost he said well
[56:42] what are you Pentecost I said yeah I'm
[56:44] Pentecost I was a Baptist to the other
[56:47] one but I was a Pentecostal this one I
[56:50] said yeah I said I'm Pentecost I said
[56:53] you got the Holy Ghost
[56:54] every time speaking in tongues he said
[56:56] uh-huh he said well he said I tell you
[56:57] brother he said that's all right he said
[56:59] but you know I never did just somehow I
[57:01] just never could see it just like that
[57:03] he said and I said oh you haven't got
[57:06] nothing then that's all there is to it
[57:08] you ain't got a thing less you do that's
[57:10] all he walked over to me took a whole of
[57:12] my hand looked me right in the eye and
[57:15] put his arm around me said but we are
[57:17] brothers aren't we we are going to
[57:20] heaven aren't we brother and I said yes
[57:22] and brother happened to be I'm on your
[57:24] side now I said that man proved listen
[57:28] listen to the Prophet that man proved by
[57:31] that that he did have the Holy Ghost and
[57:34] the other proved he didn't have the Holy
[57:37] Ghost that's right see exactly that man
[57:39] had theology but as soon as I told him
[57:42] something to cross up his theology then
[57:45] he flew to pieces because he didn't have
[57:47] nothing else but theology I crossed this
[57:51] other man's theology and he said cries
[57:54] and he had Christ to hold him there oh
[57:56] my cam the church say Amen
[57:59] so this Court fits him perfectly because
[58:02] I was sharing with brother Ovid you know
[58:05] if if you get an invitation onto
[58:07] something and what I love about the
[58:09] Prophet but a man went everywhere
[58:11] because he believed in Brotherhood he
[58:14] believed in fellowship he believed in
[58:16] communion it's impossible if my brother
[58:20] Gideon and I don't see eye to eye so we
[58:23] should stop being brothers that cannot
[58:26] be right because we don't see this court
[58:29] the same way does it mean he's not my
[58:31] brother all of a sudden I can visit him
[58:34] he can visit me does is just is that
[58:37] Christianity is that what this message
[58:40] came for that because the scripture came
[58:43] and he looked at it one way and I was
[58:45] like no I didn't mean that
[58:46] maybe call didn't show me yet maybe God
[58:48] didn't show him yet but we are still
[58:50] brothers so I'm under great expectation
[58:56] because but the Branham said one day the
[58:57] rain will fall and the water level will
[59:00] rise and the ducks that have been kept
[59:03] apart will begin to swim together and I
[59:08] believe that something is about to
[59:11] happen now
[59:13] brother Branham preached many things he
[59:17] said but there's some real sees with a
[59:19] bride now remember the Branham cut down
[59:21] to dealing with the Branham tabernacle
[59:24] and bringing the message he preached a
[59:26] powerful message called the token and in
[59:29] that message he preached at the evening
[59:31] time message
[59:35] the whole message to be wrapped up into
[59:38] one message the evening time message is
[59:42] to apply the token so I'm calling for
[59:47] Trinidad this morning let everybody know
[59:51] that there is one theme of this message
[59:54] and there's one inspiration for our
[59:57] upcoming convention it has nothing to do
[1:00:00] with how you process your scripture or
[1:00:02] your quote God's prophet to which we
[1:00:06] identified stood and declare the evening
[1:00:09] time message is to apply the token he
[1:00:12] sent up tie it on your house apply it in
[1:00:15] your life you may be seated
[1:00:18] but the random said he said and he
[1:00:21] called out to the Branham tabernacle he
[1:00:23] said all your believing is in vain if
[1:00:26] you don't have the token all your common
[1:00:29] is in vain if you don't have to token
[1:00:31] this token is the most important thing
[1:00:34] to get make sure on your resume that
[1:00:42] your years of service is trumped by the
[1:00:46] token how many books you read has to be
[1:00:49] trumped by the token because God isn't
[1:00:52] interested in the books you read he's
[1:00:54] interested in when I see the Blood I
[1:00:56] will pass over you
[1:01:00] can the church cement hallelujah so I'm
[1:01:07] seeing all of that to say that this
[1:01:09] upcoming convention all are welcome
[1:01:12] all are welcome doesn't matter your
[1:01:16] doctrine your belief if you believe that
[1:01:18] we are going to the rapture you are
[1:01:20] welcome if you believe that Jesus died
[1:01:23] to save and redeem and restore and
[1:01:26] restore Church then you are welcome if
[1:01:29] you believe God sent a prophet to turn
[1:01:31] our hearts back to the faith of the
[1:01:33] fathers you are welcome if you believe
[1:01:36] it's going to be a revival then you are
[1:01:38] welcome if you believe that young people
[1:01:40] are going to be delivered then you are
[1:01:42] welcome if you believe that God promised
[1:01:45] that the sick will be healed then you
[1:01:47] are welcome if you believe in the
[1:01:48] old-fashioned sim killing I blew
[1:01:51] Holocaust survivor then you are welcome
[1:01:54] if you believe it lift in your hands if
[1:01:57] you believe in keeping your hands
[1:01:58] swinging you are also welcome but
[1:02:00] whatever you do do something and apply
[1:02:03] the token apply it in your house apply
[1:02:07] it over your family because when I see
[1:02:10] the blood I'll pass over you hallelujah
[1:02:15] hallelujah let's say be the name of Lord
[1:02:19] feels good in here this morning oh it's
[1:02:24] your fashion gospel if it was good for
[1:02:27] Paul and Silas then he was good enough
[1:02:29] for me
[1:02:30] if it was good for brother branham it's
[1:02:32] good enough for me if it was good for
[1:02:34] Luther it's good enough for me if it was
[1:02:37] good for Wesley it's good enough for me
[1:02:39] everyone's good for brother Coleman it's
[1:02:41] good enough for me I don't care who it
[1:02:43] is if it's good for them it's good for
[1:02:46] me because it's the same car it's the
[1:02:49] same power it is good for the pastor
[1:02:51] it's good for me
[1:02:53] oh god help me oh he could still take
[1:02:57] the prostitute and give her the Holy
[1:02:59] Ghost he can still take the drunkard oh
[1:03:02] come on now come on now
[1:03:05] oh I see the chains breakin it's the
[1:03:11] same blood I'm not better than nobody
[1:03:15] you may be seated
[1:03:16] in fact I want to apply to be the worst
[1:03:19] I don't want any better than nobody I
[1:03:23] want to be last place because in your
[1:03:26] last place it means the grease I want us
[1:03:28] to reach down there because His grace is
[1:03:30] not too short so if I can make it then
[1:03:33] anybody can make it oh come on
[1:03:35] somebody help somebody help me this
[1:03:37] mornin what sin you talking about he is
[1:03:40] telling the same cleansing business
[1:03:43] they're still blood blood for your home
[1:03:45] blood for your family blood for your
[1:03:48] situation
[1:03:49] Oh somebody say Amen so catch a burden
[1:03:57] friends it really starts with a burden
[1:04:02] and before you could put on the oxygen
[1:04:05] mask they see on somebody else in an
[1:04:08] airplane if you've ever been on a plane
[1:04:10] or seen the demonstration of the safety
[1:04:12] rules they show you the exits they show
[1:04:17] you how to put on your seatbelt they
[1:04:20] show you how to pack your bags because
[1:04:23] nobody expects a problem and sometimes
[1:04:27] many people sit down and maybe they
[1:04:30] overlook the warnings they overlook the
[1:04:32] training but invariably there are times
[1:04:35] when stuff happens that you did not
[1:04:37] expect and that's where the training
[1:04:39] comes in but you always tell you if the
[1:04:43] gas masks fall make sure and put it on
[1:04:46] yourself first before you put it on
[1:04:50] anybody else it's alright to try to help
[1:04:54] people and many times our efforts to
[1:04:58] help people is covering up a deeper
[1:05:00] problem that we actually have because
[1:05:02] many of us we don't want to confront our
[1:05:05] own issues I just
[1:05:06] we don't want to confront our own
[1:05:08] promise and it's easy to say well
[1:05:10] brother you need to fix that tie because
[1:05:13] that's not how we wear it up in here and
[1:05:16] it's easy to spend time because the more
[1:05:19] energy you spend focus on other people
[1:05:21] it takes away your focus on yourself but
[1:05:26] after the display of the criticism and
[1:05:28] the observation and and the casual
[1:05:31] conversation about the issues when you
[1:05:33] go back home and look in the mirror you
[1:05:34] still have to confront the reality of
[1:05:36] who you are and if you look in the
[1:05:39] mirror and you don't see Jesus looking
[1:05:41] back at you then you need to go deeper
[1:05:45] on the inside because our Commission is
[1:05:49] when we look at in a mirror Jesus should
[1:05:52] be looking back at us because we ought
[1:05:56] to be a reflection of his majesty a
[1:05:59] reflection of his glory a reflection of
[1:06:02] His Holiness a reflection of his decency
[1:06:06] a reflection of his life friends I am
[1:06:12] under expectation because I was human
[1:06:16] beloved I was speaking to someone and
[1:06:18] his feeling about the spiritual realm
[1:06:21] and and we preach it but he said it in
[1:06:23] such a powerful way
[1:06:24] he said when man was given Dominion this
[1:06:29] was the jurisdiction of man and because
[1:06:32] it's man's jurisdiction whatever happens
[1:06:35] here is actually authorized by man so
[1:06:38] Jesus says I stand at the door and knock
[1:06:41] If any man open then I'll come in now if
[1:06:47] you don't open he can't move if you
[1:06:50] can't oh if you don't open he cannot act
[1:06:52] I want you to get this he is limited by
[1:06:56] your access
[1:06:58] so the brothers said to me said prayer
[1:07:01] is unlocking the access to God to be
[1:07:05] able to operate and I loved it you say
[1:07:08] when you begin to pray and if we get to
[1:07:10] talk to God he's had to open the windows
[1:07:13] and open the doors and you give God
[1:07:16] permission to come into your situation
[1:07:18] Oh somebody help me this morning no
[1:07:22] wonder Jesus had to pray because as a
[1:07:24] man on this earth he had to give the
[1:07:27] access forgot to operate in this realm
[1:07:31] because this belongs to us he has no
[1:07:40] hands but your hands he has the eyes
[1:07:42] with your eyes and the same way that in
[1:07:45] the spiritual realm prayer unlocks the
[1:07:48] ability of God operate is the same way
[1:07:51] the opposite of that any activity or
[1:07:54] action that is contrary to opening for
[1:07:57] God is witchcraft and you allow darkness
[1:08:02] into your life Jack this into your house
[1:08:05] I was speaking to my wife this morning
[1:08:07] and I said you know it's real but the
[1:08:09] Branham for witches 99% of the message
[1:08:13] they want to hear about this but we
[1:08:18] can't have to fight witches because
[1:08:21] there's spiritual warfare people want to
[1:08:24] think it's business as usual
[1:08:26] but as we near the headstone and the
[1:08:29] anointing rises it'll bring all kinds of
[1:08:32] spirits not only that when the power
[1:08:34] comes it'll open and uncover everything
[1:08:37] that's happening in here so be careful
[1:08:41] in this season because the season is
[1:08:42] changing because this this is the blood
[1:08:45] season is a token season and you better
[1:08:48] be in the act of safety and the AK is
[1:08:51] not Church the act is Jesus Christ
[1:08:54] [Applause]
[1:08:56] and the church seamen are you ready for
[1:09:00] the word this morning you love the Lord
[1:09:03] this morning are you on the expectation
[1:09:05] but what go to loo now next Sunday is
[1:09:08] our last Sunday before the convention we
[1:09:11] will just have one service next one the
[1:09:14] Lord willing so we encourage you make
[1:09:18] every effort to come out as is the last
[1:09:21] Sunday service there will be no midweek
[1:09:23] services next week it'll just be the
[1:09:24] convention remember friends it's seven
[1:09:27] services and seven is God's number for
[1:09:30] completion seven services that's how he
[1:09:33] has lead it on the heart of the pastor
[1:09:35] and I believe it's critical for you to
[1:09:38] make them all make every effort for God
[1:09:42] to really do something in your life you
[1:09:46] know I was hearing a number of
[1:09:47] testimonies over the last few days and
[1:09:50] many times I realized that it's easy for
[1:09:52] us to be ungrateful because many times
[1:09:56] we don't see because we don't see the
[1:09:59] spirit realm we don't understand what's
[1:10:00] happening how many times you could have
[1:10:04] gotten in an accident and an angel was
[1:10:07] there protecting you but because you
[1:10:09] didn't see it you thinking it's your own
[1:10:12] driving ability and you just happen to
[1:10:15] and you have no idea sometimes you you
[1:10:17] you you leave earlier you leave later
[1:10:19] and you don't know God did detained you
[1:10:21] because something was happening that he
[1:10:22] didn't want you involved with and behind
[1:10:24] around daniel is praying and write down
[1:10:27] his bring the angel of fighting he
[1:10:29] doesn't know what's going on in the
[1:10:31] spirit realm but he is just praying and
[1:10:33] you have no idea right now the activity
[1:10:37] that's around this tabernacle of angels
[1:10:40] that I'm fighting because there's a
[1:10:41] prize in your heart there's a seed in
[1:10:44] your soul that there angels are seen to
[1:10:47] protect you because I've seen us got to
[1:10:49] come to pass that scene as a destination
[1:10:52] for the Holy Ghost
[1:10:53] young brother young sister and every
[1:10:58] obstacle every activity every action
[1:11:02] that is fighting your destiny is demonic
[1:11:07] you have to name it as it is whether
[1:11:09] it's friends whether its family whether
[1:11:11] it's work commitments whatever it is if
[1:11:15] it is not bringing you closer to the
[1:11:17] kingdom of God it's taking you from the
[1:11:20] kingdom we need to name it can the
[1:11:27] church say man everybody feeling fine
[1:11:30] how many only expectations for God to
[1:11:33] deliver their families how many on
[1:11:39] expectation to receive the baptism of
[1:11:41] the Holy Ghost on fire
[1:11:42] [Applause]
[1:11:43] [Music]
[1:11:44] now friends I want to challenge you this
[1:11:47] morning you know there's a statement you
[1:11:53] could bring the horse to the water but
[1:11:55] you cannot make the horse drink I don't
[1:12:02] believe in forcing anybody they have
[1:12:05] places that for that but God is love it
[1:12:13] has to be in your heart that you want to
[1:12:15] change it cannot be because of your
[1:12:19] parents it cannot even me because of the
[1:12:21] past it has to be because of your
[1:12:23] relationship with God that you want to
[1:12:27] be a real Christian and a better
[1:12:30] Christian because if you are not
[1:12:32] becoming a better Christian than you are
[1:12:34] backsliding there's only two movements
[1:12:35] this backslide or moving forward because
[1:12:38] standing stationary is not an option
[1:12:40] that doesn't exist every service you
[1:12:43] come to you either moving follow you
[1:12:44] moving backward so I pray this morning
[1:12:48] we can move forward where we have never
[1:12:49] gone before because that's where we need
[1:12:53] to go can I say ma'am
[1:12:54] so shall we stand as we approach the
[1:12:58] scripture there just sing one song
[1:13:00] before we read the scripture Jehovah

[1:14:26] [Music]
[1:14:33] thank yous issues shall we turn to
[1:14:36] Joelle chapter two cinmarc eat and
[1:14:40] Romans chapter one Joelle to st. mark

[1:15:08] the floor shall be full of wheat and the
[1:15:10] fat shall overflow with wine and oil and
[1:15:13] I will restore to you the years that the
[1:15:15] locusts have eaten the cankerworm and
[1:15:18] the caterpillar and the Palmer were my
[1:15:20] great army which I sent among you and he
[1:15:23] shall eat and plenty and be satisfied
[1:15:25] and praise the name of the Lord your God
[1:15:27] that had dealt wondrously with you and
[1:15:30] my people shall never be ashamed and he
[1:15:33] shall know that I am in the midst of
[1:15:35] Israel and that I am the Lord your God
[1:15:37] and none else and my people shall never
[1:15:40] be ashamed and it shall come to pass
[1:15:42] afterward that I will pour out my spirit
[1:15:44] upon all flesh and your sons and your
[1:15:47] daughters shall prophesy your old men
[1:15:49] shall dream dreams your young men shall
[1:15:52] see visions and also upon the servants
[1:15:55] and upon the hand maids and those days
[1:15:57] will I pour out my spirit and readin st.
[1:16:01] mark 8 and verse 34 cinmarc
[1:16:05] 8 and verse 34 and when he called the
[1:16:08] people unto him with his disciples also
[1:16:10] he said unto them whosoever will come
[1:16:14] after me let him deny himself and take
[1:16:17] up his cross and follow me deny himself
[1:16:23] take up his cross and follow me for
[1:16:28] whosoever will save his life shall lose
[1:16:31] it but whosoever shall lose his life for
[1:16:34] my sake and the Gospels the same shall
[1:16:37] save it for what shall it profit a man
[1:16:41] if he shall gain the whole world and
[1:16:43] lose his own soul or what shall a man
[1:16:45] give in exchange for his soul whosoever
[1:16:50] therefore shall be ashamed of me and of
[1:16:52] my words in this adulterous and sinful
[1:16:55] generation of him also shall the Son of
[1:16:58] Man be ashamed when he cometh in the
[1:17:01] glory of his father with the Holy Angels
[1:17:03] and our last scripture one verse reading
[1:17:06] Romans 1 and verse 16 for I am not
[1:17:10] ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it
[1:17:13] is the power of God unto salvation to
[1:17:17] everyone that believeth to the Jew first
[1:17:19] and also to the Greek middle Lord had a
[1:17:22] blessing to the reading of his word you
[1:17:26] may be seated so for a title this
[1:17:29] morning I want to take it from that
[1:17:31] scripture I be read in Joel and whenever
[1:17:35] the Bible repeats a statement its
[1:17:38] emphasis so we see in Joel 2 verse 26
[1:17:43] and he shall eat and plenty and be
[1:17:45] satisfied and praise the name of the
[1:17:47] Lord your God that he'll dealt
[1:17:48] wondrously with you and my people shall
[1:17:51] never be ashamed and then it goes on and
[1:17:54] he shall know that I'm in the midst of
[1:17:56] Israel and I'm the Lord your God and an
[1:17:57] else and my people shall never be
[1:17:59] ashamed so for a title this morning my
[1:18:03] people shall never be ashamed and as a
[1:18:06] subject the unfolding of the bride and
[1:18:09] an inspiration the mystery of who you
[1:18:13] can the church say Amen and this
[1:18:17] inspiration of my people shall never be
[1:18:20] ashamed started for me when I was look
[1:18:23] the message to token and I was realizing
[1:18:26] that the token has to be applied before
[1:18:31] it could be displayed
[1:18:33] because whether Branham said the token
[1:18:36] must be on display so it cannot be
[1:18:38] hidden something it must be a public
[1:18:41] something and then I was looking nana
[1:18:44] say I was looking at the young people
[1:18:47] and the situations and the problem and a
[1:18:49] challenge and it really bothers me it
[1:18:53] really troubles me when I see young
[1:18:56] people come to church and similarly all
[1:18:59] the ones and you see a certain pattern
[1:19:03] of behavior and for all intents and
[1:19:05] purposes they all look as Christians act
[1:19:09] as Christians and I mean we do have the
[1:19:11] Prophet telling us there are three kinds
[1:19:12] of believers so there's a certain
[1:19:14] perspective there but then there's
[1:19:18] something that happens in the daily
[1:19:19] lives that creates somewhat of a
[1:19:22] disconnect between the behavior on a
[1:19:24] Sunday and the behavior on a Tuesday
[1:19:26] morning or Wednesday evening or Friday
[1:19:31] morning we have young people who dress
[1:19:34] as Christians on a Sunday but in the
[1:19:36] middle of the week they don't look like
[1:19:37] they're Christians we have husbands that
[1:19:41] speak to their wives a certain way in a
[1:19:43] Sunday but in the middle of their week
[1:19:44] they don't sound like Christians we have
[1:19:47] wives who honor their husbands in a
[1:19:49] Sunday but in the middle of the week
[1:19:50] they don't act like they should and I'm
[1:19:54] wondering what causes this why this
[1:19:56] behavior I'm wondering what insanity
[1:20:03] will get ahold of someone's mind that
[1:20:05] the God are provided for you to eat you
[1:20:08] are ashamed to bless the food in your
[1:20:10] workplace I'm wondering why our young
[1:20:15] sisters are ashamed to wear their
[1:20:17] dresses long and they allow words like
[1:20:21] peer pressure
[1:20:22] the foolishness of this world to deter
[1:20:24] them from having a testimony and I'm and
[1:20:28] I'm thinking back to my own childhood
[1:20:31] and I share this in the youth meeting in
[1:20:34] Ghana not growing up there was no
[1:20:36] television in the house and I remember
[1:20:39] going to school I believe was like form
[1:20:41] one form to I actually felt bad that I
[1:20:45] didn't have a TV and because my mind
[1:20:48] works a certain way and I learn a
[1:20:50] certain way and I could remember things
[1:20:51] that way I I don't even think I told my
[1:20:53] dad this so it's a confession this
[1:20:55] morning in school
[1:21:00] the young people would come and they
[1:21:02] would talk about the short night before
[1:21:04] but I had no idea what they were talking
[1:21:07] about so in my own simple way for the
[1:21:10] first few days I listened and listened
[1:21:13] until I learned all the characters I
[1:21:16] knew who Bobby was who Jenny was what
[1:21:20] tom was so by the 7 8 D I'm in the
[1:21:23] conversation as if I had seen it and I'm
[1:21:26] be able to put together and what you
[1:21:29] heard what Johnny said Johnny is a mean
[1:21:31] character he had to be in it I don't
[1:21:33] know what Johnny said and then somebody
[1:21:35] would see what and tell you Johnny
[1:21:37] something else and you would never think
[1:21:42] that I didn't see the show because I was
[1:21:46] ashamed that I didn't have a TV because
[1:21:49] growing up in the message until you get
[1:21:52] a revelation and an experience it's just
[1:21:55] rules and knowledge and words and talk
[1:21:57] because it hasn't registered it hasn't
[1:22:01] dropped from an intellectual
[1:22:02] consciousness to the heart experience
[1:22:05] that compels you to act and behave a
[1:22:07] certain way
[1:22:08] somebody preached back to me but there's
[1:22:12] still something holding you there's
[1:22:14] still something pulling you but is what
[1:22:16] psychologists call a cognitive
[1:22:17] dissonance the gap between your reality
[1:22:20] and what is really true so shame is a
[1:22:27] real thing it's a real thing but then
[1:22:30] the Bible speaks and absolute tells we
[1:22:32] spoke of what the Prophet said before
[1:22:34] there's no love you don't have nothing
[1:22:36] that's all it's an absolute statement
[1:22:38] but then the Bible tells me this morning
[1:22:41] that my people shall never
[1:22:44] be ashamed that's an absolute term so
[1:22:48] there will come a point in your
[1:22:50] Christian walk where there's no shame
[1:22:52] with how you dress there's no shame with
[1:22:54] how you worship there's no shame with
[1:22:57] how you praise us no shame when you have
[1:23:00] to say I believe the Prophet I believe
[1:23:04] this message I don't have to be ashamed
[1:23:06] to say it
[1:23:07] you can make me feel funny because
[1:23:10] something has happened on the inside and
[1:23:12] now my people shall never be ashamed as
[1:23:16] a young lady I can let my hair grow out
[1:23:21] you may be seated under here dresser
[1:23:25] tells you that you need to cut the ends
[1:23:29] way to grow out you don't need to be
[1:23:36] ashamed to say listen I don't want it
[1:23:41] because I'm not ashamed of this gospel
[1:23:44] I'm not ashamed that this son of man or
[1:23:46] his words he may be seated
[1:23:49] we have young people struggling with an
[1:23:52] identity crisis and identity crisis it
[1:23:56] has you up trying on makeup even if you
[1:24:00] don't make it out of the house with it
[1:24:01] you still try it on to see how you would
[1:24:03] look it troubles me you know Facebook
[1:24:07] Instagram these things have all these
[1:24:10] it's it's it's too much but demons all
[1:24:17] these filters young people no whatsoever
[1:24:21] all our nose then you're in trouble
[1:24:23] but these filters that make you look
[1:24:25] like you have on makeup I said why would
[1:24:28] a Christian by a bubble even message
[1:24:32] believing Christian use a filter that
[1:24:35] makes you look like you have makeup
[1:24:37] makes you look like you cut your hair
[1:24:40] because whatever you feel into becomes
[1:24:43] your life
[1:24:44] and your actions don't only affect you
[1:24:47] it affects anybody else who's watching
[1:24:49] bigger but the grand said there's
[1:24:51] somebody watching you but going forward
[1:24:56] it has to be I am not ashamed of the son
[1:25:01] of man nor of his words of every word it
[1:25:08] becomes your words because when his
[1:25:11] words become your words and you are
[1:25:13] fully identified just as when you were
[1:25:16] identified with the lamb that the
[1:25:17] sacrifice it was it was you should have
[1:25:19] been dead but the lamb took your place
[1:25:21] do you have to identify with the
[1:25:23] sacrifice it should have been you there
[1:25:25] the slimiest identify with this word and
[1:25:29] deny yourself deny your family didn't
[1:25:39] and your family should be easy because
[1:25:42] in an yourself is the hardest let me say
[1:25:46] that again denying your friend should be
[1:25:48] easy because in an yourself is the
[1:25:50] hardest thing to deny your perception of
[1:25:53] things how how things are posed to be
[1:25:55] that's for you I'm going to break that
[1:25:58] deny yourself not for me not for the
[1:26:01] pasta not for the message was for Christ
[1:26:06] that's the Bible can we have change this
[1:26:10] morning my people shall never be ashamed
[1:26:17] and the message of she me I want to
[1:26:20] touch I want to take my time a little
[1:26:22] bit today there is a Lord's D behold a
[1:26:32] cool lazy Lord's Day get comfortable and
[1:26:36] why I I posted on Facebook this morning
[1:26:40] friends when the Prophet said watch
[1:26:43] Russia he wasn't talking about he woke
[1:26:45] up
[1:26:52] people have such temporary attention
[1:26:58] spans in church but every game they can
[1:27:01] tell every minute the hour but I see it
[1:27:03] telling minute the hour when you will
[1:27:05] receive the Holy Ghost people are the
[1:27:08] middle of the hour of every score every
[1:27:10] move because that's how the world has
[1:27:12] been created as a whole so it's spirits
[1:27:16] behind it you know so I remember drove
[1:27:18] it in the officer said listen it's not
[1:27:20] the people it's the people are never the
[1:27:22] problem it's a spirits because when you
[1:27:27] open your door to the spirits in until
[1:27:29] that's where this passed out and the
[1:27:32] Prophet with love would look beyond the
[1:27:34] man look being under woman and see the
[1:27:36] spirit upon them and have compassion for
[1:27:39] them that's why the word goes forth to
[1:27:42] bring liberty in your soul that a spirit
[1:27:45] that are operating could be exposed
[1:27:47] because we wanted everliving expose he
[1:27:49] can't operate anymore so the word comes
[1:27:53] from the sacred desk to expose every
[1:27:56] unclean spirit every unclean thoughts
[1:27:59] every unclean desire and that's why when
[1:28:02] the word goes forth and power fire come
[1:28:05] behind it then if you will go free it
[1:28:07] may not be obviously visible but demons
[1:28:10] in this program have to let you go
[1:28:12] because the word is powerful Jesus use
[1:28:16] just the word and he beat the devil it
[1:28:18] is written it is written it is also
[1:28:21] written and this morning but the words
[1:28:23] of the Prophet it is written it is
[1:28:25] written it is also written you shall be
[1:28:28] delivered you shall these hill you shall
[1:28:31] be set free
[1:28:32] [Applause]
[1:28:32] [Music]
[1:28:35] you may be seated and the Prophet tied
[1:28:38] my people shall never be ashamed to
[1:28:40] restoration so the story goes pouring
[1:28:43] out heat add it all in at one powerful
[1:28:45] scripture of ivory sauce here the Lord
[1:28:48] and my people shall never be ashamed
[1:28:50] oh you'll not be ashamed of what you

[1:35:40] your thoughts neither are my waves of
[1:35:43] yours for the heavens are higher than
[1:35:45] the earth so are my thoughts above your
[1:35:47] thoughts you the fundamental difference
[1:35:50] between the ways of man and the ways of
[1:35:52] God is this man judges you by your
[1:35:56] resume and your resume is only a
[1:36:00] declaration of your past your resume
[1:36:04] speaks of your past achievements your
[1:36:07] past accomplishments what exams you
[1:36:10] wrote what you did before but how in the
[1:36:13] world could somebody be able to
[1:36:16] understand your future from your past in
[1:36:18] God's economy your past is irrelevant
[1:36:23] that's how we could use Paul
[1:36:30] [Applause]
[1:36:32] Paul's resume would not have made the
[1:36:35] discipleship list Rahab the prostitute
[1:36:43] her as you may god had to turn it over
[1:36:46] for him to use her Oh God
[1:36:50] David the adulterer gotta turn it over
[1:36:57] you don't hear me you don't hear me this
[1:37:01] morning you don't hear me this morning
[1:37:03] but when you read the book of Hebrews
[1:37:05] like meet Noah like I shop God resumes
[1:37:11] God's document is written by fate
[1:37:15] [Applause]
[1:37:24] [Music]
[1:37:26] you may be seated
[1:37:29] [Music]
[1:37:35] [Music]
[1:37:37] the devil is limited in the ingredients
[1:37:42] that he could use because he only has
[1:37:44] access to your past
[1:37:49] [Applause]
[1:37:56] I'll say it again the devil is limited
[1:37:59] by the ingredients he has to work with
[1:38:02] when he gets up in the morning to try to
[1:38:05] figure you out
[1:38:06] he could only rely on your past he has
[1:38:13] no idea about your future and that's why
[1:38:17] he could never win because he holds your
[1:38:20] future or you know hear me this morning
[1:38:23] that's why your daughter has got to come
[1:38:26] your son has got to come because the
[1:38:29] devil could only talk about their past
[1:38:31] but God he sneaks up destiny he speaks
[1:38:35] of pre-tests and my people shall never
[1:38:41] be ashamed this is the gospel friends
[1:38:50] the gospel is the good news the good
[1:38:54] news set you free from your past and to
[1:38:59] walk in the trust of uncertainty because
[1:39:07] if God tells you every step will be then
[1:39:09] there's no need to trust him so there's
[1:39:12] a trust of uncertainty because the boat
[1:39:15] will get shaky but it's for a purpose I
[1:39:21] heard a preacher speaking about many
[1:39:24] time you made me see that I'm taking my
[1:39:26] time take off
[1:39:39] speaking about Jesus is walking
[1:39:42] underwater and many time we talk about
[1:39:45] Peter come out to walk in the water but
[1:39:47] I never saw it quite that way
[1:39:50] about stepping out the boat we talk
[1:39:55] about Peter walking on the water and he
[1:39:57] stumbles and he's a man of feet but
[1:40:00] stepping all the boards are the easy
[1:40:01] thing in him no no but I'm thinking if I
[1:40:07] was there and I was a Peter Peter Peter
[1:40:09] Peter get Peter : : : stepping out the
[1:40:22] boat it's not an easy thing but the
[1:40:27] brand I preached a message called the
[1:40:28] oddball because that was Peters example
[1:40:34] of being an oddball nobody else left on
[1:40:36] the board except Peter and and all of
[1:40:40] this just pushing me because I have a
[1:40:42] burden especially for the young people
[1:40:45] because I have a higher expectation of
[1:40:47] the Caleb's
[1:40:53] please don't disappoint me but my heart
[1:40:58] bleeds for the young people not just for
[1:41:01] their going through but I look at my own
[1:41:03] life experience and what I went through
[1:41:07] and I said to my dad and i'ma go so many
[1:41:10] things we here are easier said than done
[1:41:15] brig free step out clean myth walk on
[1:41:18] land walk in the land wherever you put
[1:41:23] your foot is yours and it sounds
[1:41:24] wonderful and it feels exciting it
[1:41:29] sounds good
[1:41:30] and then when Tuesday comes and
[1:41:39] you see the solanum on I am very
[1:41:42] comfortable with this piece right here
[1:41:44] this piece called the comfort zone I'm
[1:41:47] very comfortable but to step out the
[1:41:52] boot or to take more land to witness
[1:41:56] somebody to take more land to reach out
[1:42:00] to somebody to take more land to call
[1:42:03] somebody and say you're gonna make it
[1:42:07] to take more land to enter into
[1:42:10] someone's suffering to take more land
[1:42:15] and try to understand the troubles that
[1:42:19] lead to songs like nobody knows the
[1:42:21] troubles I see so to enter into the
[1:42:24] suffering that someone may be going
[1:42:26] through that is different from yours
[1:42:30] no wonder the Bible says confess your
[1:42:33] faults one to another because it levels
[1:42:35] this playing field of the struggle and
[1:42:39] the pain and what we're going through
[1:42:40] because it brings this unity of we are
[1:42:42] in this thing together to make it my
[1:42:46] mind is blown I was sharing a few days
[1:42:50] ago with some friends at how Jesus was
[1:42:54] so much and I could use this term
[1:42:56] carefully one of the boys that it took
[1:42:58] Judas to identify him
[1:43:02] he walked no different on the disciples
[1:43:05] he was regular but yet received some
[1:43:09] people said they look so so holy immune
[1:43:18] the Brees broilers there and this is
[1:43:22] it's it's encouraging to see people who
[1:43:25] are solid but Jesus wept at the grave of
[1:43:33] Lazarus
[1:43:34] because as a brother or as a sister we
[1:43:38] will all have our up-and-down moment and
[1:43:41] it's okay to tell Jesus it's okay to
[1:43:44] tell somebody it's okay to say I need
[1:43:46] prayer my people shall never be ashamed
[1:43:49] so there should be no shame in saying
[1:43:53] pray for me there are people when we
[1:43:59] call an altar quality regime to come
[1:44:03] because they don't want anybody to know
[1:44:05] that they really need prayer I'll tell
[1:44:08] you I need prayer my people shall never
[1:44:21] be ashamed I pray this will help
[1:44:23] somebody today
[1:44:24] and number the bottom goes on and this
[1:44:27] young people I really want you to be
[1:44:30] careful with this now but the banner
[1:44:32] said whosoever is ashamed of me and my
[1:44:34] word I'll be ashamed of him so in the
[1:44:42] midst of your sin and your feeling is
[1:44:44] when you don't know he could be he could
[1:44:46] have no shame about you because you
[1:44:49] belong to him he died for you but now
[1:44:52] you committed his glorious gospel and
[1:44:55] you want to be ashamed to have a
[1:44:57] testimony a shame to sing imagine that
[1:45:03] people do want to sing in church well
[1:45:05] give me expurgated say outside i
[1:45:10] remember and i could relate to my one
[1:45:14] i'm just gonna give my testimony because
[1:45:16] many of you are better than me
[1:45:18] but I was young I remember as young and
[1:45:21] parents have this way they tell their
[1:45:24] kids do something you know and they have
[1:45:26] all confidence in memorize young way
[1:45:28] that was like speak Spanish or a single
[1:45:32] song and and yep I mean you're small
[1:45:34] young man you like what so we had a
[1:45:37] family gathering with the obits Saturday
[1:45:41] family many many years ago maybe seven
[1:45:45] eight years old
[1:45:46] and I think my dad was doing a little
[1:45:49] gathering and he's like let's sing this
[1:45:52] song and I'm there looking at my other
[1:45:55] little cousins and nobody else singing
[1:45:57] at my dad's like sing with me because
[1:45:58] he's like the only one sitting and I'm
[1:46:00] like there quietly and I think back to
[1:46:03] what happens in your job and the
[1:46:06] workplace in your family because friends
[1:46:08] what's happening in here is not the test
[1:46:11] this is not the test the test is when
[1:46:15] you are alone when there's no D Colonel
[1:46:19] Eleanor parson or sister and pasta
[1:46:21] what is your testimony when nobody else
[1:46:25] is watching you that's when you ought to
[1:46:28] be testifying through your life of His
[1:46:32] goodness somebody say Amen so let me
[1:46:39] skip a few things I want to strike a
[1:46:43] point here
[1:46:50] glory in a message of shame but their
[1:46:55] banner said Jesus said now if you are
[1:46:57] looking for my watch I gave my watch
[1:46:59] everybody jesus said now if you're
[1:47:01] ashamed of me then I'll be ashamed of
[1:47:03] you why would he be ashamed of you
[1:47:04] because you are claiming to be his when
[1:47:07] you won't follow him and that's the way
[1:47:10] that's so-called Christianity today if
[1:47:12] you name it a name of a denomination
[1:47:14] alright they accept the Fatherhood of a
[1:47:16] denomination but when it comes to
[1:47:18] accepting the Fatherhood of the Word of
[1:47:20] God Christ no they're embarrassed they
[1:47:24] don't want to say yes I've spoken
[1:47:25] tongues yes I've seen visions yes I
[1:47:27] believe in divine healing yes I praise
[1:47:29] the Lord yes I'm free from all
[1:47:31] organization I'm not going to any of
[1:47:34] that I'm a servant of Christ oh my that
[1:47:36] just tear them to pieces but it's a
[1:47:39] reality to a man or woman boy or girl
[1:47:42] who really is a genuine Christian when
[1:47:45] God made the promise of the baptism of
[1:47:48] the Holy Ghost and you receive it
[1:47:51] there's something that settles within
[1:47:53] you that there is nothing takes its
[1:47:56] place when a man ever meets God not in
[1:47:59] some emotional work up some enthusiasm
[1:48:04] or some religious doctrine some
[1:48:06] catechism or creed or dogma that he is
[1:48:09] accepted for a comfort for himself
[1:48:11] that's a prophet but when he really
[1:48:13] comes to the place like Moses did on the
[1:48:16] backside of the desert woke up face to
[1:48:18] face with Almighty God and you see the
[1:48:20] voice speaking to you exactly with the
[1:48:23] word and the promise of the hour there's
[1:48:25] something it does to you see you're not
[1:48:28] ashamed of it
[1:48:29] it does something to you can the church
[1:48:32] say man and by the madam give some
[1:48:44] examples that there was a man a very
[1:48:49] scientific age by the name of Noah
[1:48:51] he was mishima of course would gordon
[1:48:55] met him and he talked to him he knowed
[1:48:58] it was God he said it is gonna rain it
[1:49:00] never had rain but he believed there was
[1:49:02] going to rain and the
[1:49:04] fee that he had he wasn't ashamed to
[1:49:06] exercise it it took him a 120 years to
[1:49:10] build an ark when the world was against
[1:49:12] him he wasn't ashamed of God's would in
[1:49:14] his day God saved him and his household
[1:49:17] four-hit how foolish it might have
[1:49:20] seemed to other people but to him he
[1:49:23] meant God no matter how scientific the
[1:49:26] other was that was contrary it couldn't
[1:49:29] happen it couldn't happen he had met God
[1:49:31] and that's what it is when you know
[1:49:33] you're talking to him you were thinking
[1:49:36] was a foolish thing when somebody and by
[1:49:39] the Balan goes on he said well Nora
[1:49:41] wasn't ashamed
[1:49:42] it seemed foolish to the rest of the
[1:49:44] world but not to him Moses when he was
[1:49:46] before hero he was ashamed to tell
[1:49:48] Pharaoh that these certain things would
[1:49:50] happen because he had met God and by the
[1:49:52] Branham cause sure a number of examples
[1:49:54] of Elijah how he was not ashamed he
[1:49:58] talks about Daniel how Daniel was a
[1:50:00] prayer a prayer warrior and they put a
[1:50:03] law that that you shouldn't bring I
[1:50:06] wanted to put a law too dear that you
[1:50:08] shouldn't bring I'll leave that for a
[1:50:17] month but Danny wasn't having it and
[1:50:22] Daniel could have gone in secret and hid
[1:50:25] but Daniel opened the window and prayed
[1:50:30] as normal because he was not ashamed and
[1:50:34] because he was gonna shame they put him
[1:50:37] in the lion's den and still he wasn't
[1:50:39] ashamed man and when the lion saw him
[1:50:41] because he wasn't ashamed of God where
[1:50:44] was I - I'm up in that lion had to
[1:50:45] understand who he was in the room with
[1:50:47] come the church Sam and the three boys
[1:50:50] they were not a sheep when everybody
[1:50:52] else was bowing down did he clear it we
[1:50:56] are not going to bow
[1:50:58] and in start to speak our God is able to
[1:51:00] deliver us and that's why gonna speaking
[1:51:03] brother young sister you're not going to
[1:51:05] bow down and your God is able to deliver
[1:51:08] and they went on they were so convinced
[1:51:12] they were so convincing even if he
[1:51:14] doesn't deliver that shows they have no
[1:51:21] agenda it's wanting to say I will ready
[1:51:26] I'll go a fiery furnace because gold
[1:51:28] will in the world and fellas when
[1:51:30] they're not quite sure if they're gonna
[1:51:31] help anybody catch that it's one thing
[1:51:38] if you're know for sure for sure that
[1:51:40] you're gonna get a help any fire but
[1:51:41] every guys walked it wasn't sure it they
[1:51:45] say oh I got it they will deliver but
[1:51:46] even if you don't he'll ever we still go
[1:51:49] in him and as if fire it's not hot
[1:51:53] enough to burn you the King say put it
[1:51:55] seven times later and as they're walking
[1:51:58] the Bible says the men that were with
[1:52:00] them them fellows get burned the robes
[1:52:04] and were tying their hands that was
[1:52:06] keeping them from being able to worship
[1:52:07] those robes got booked 50 feet of me
[1:52:10] fiery furnace nobody was there forty
[1:52:14] feet nobody was there thirty feet nobody
[1:52:16] was there ten feet nobody was there
[1:52:19] Easter we spoke about it because but the
[1:52:21] Branham said when that declaration was
[1:52:24] mean and we are not going to bow down
[1:52:26] now we are not ashamed and we gonna have
[1:52:28] a test of money but the Branham said
[1:52:31] Gabriel around to the true room and said
[1:52:33] you see what's going on can I go down
[1:52:37] and take care of this situation and
[1:52:39] court said no I'll take care of it
[1:52:42] myself
[1:52:43] but the Branham said Michael ran to the
[1:52:47] throne room and said can I go and court
[1:52:51] said no don't worry about it but the
[1:52:54] parent said wormwood Rhianna that was
[1:52:57] the angel who sent the water for the
[1:52:59] flood and when the Branham said God told
[1:53:02] woman you were faithful with how you
[1:53:04] handle the flood but this situation is
[1:53:07] not one for an angel
[1:53:10] this is a situation for a man and with
[1:53:12] the Branham said he's summon the east
[1:53:15] wind
[1:53:15] he's summon the north wind he's summoned
[1:53:18] the south wind
[1:53:19] oh and he choked on a thunderbolt and
[1:53:23] when those boys stepped in there was a
[1:53:26] fourth man in the fire and my people
[1:53:31] shall you may be seated
[1:53:41] God was so pleased at their testimony he
[1:53:46] didn't even send an angel he came
[1:53:50] himself because if you stand for him
[1:53:53] he'll stand for you young brother young
[1:53:59] sister there's no reason to compromise
[1:54:05] your testimony for anybody
[1:54:08] I don't care where's your job your boss
[1:54:12] your family your principles stand for
[1:54:16] God he'll stand for you I said to them
[1:54:20] in a retreat in Ghana
[1:54:21] I don't care if it's a hundred or as you
[1:54:22] means lineup if you stand for him the
[1:54:26] employer doesn't even know what's
[1:54:27] directed him you don't know why he
[1:54:29] pulled his file you don't know why he
[1:54:32] opened this file you don't know why this
[1:54:34] person he just connected with the person
[1:54:39] you may be seated in the world they do
[1:54:42] all kinds of stuff to get promoted
[1:54:44] we know the Bible's a promotion to come
[1:54:47] from the East promotion will come from
[1:54:50] me it comes from the we have a Bible
[1:54:55] believing Church so what are you worried
[1:54:59] about David went through the same thing
[1:55:02] you know many are they increase the
[1:55:04] trouble me many I didn't rise up against
[1:55:07] me
[1:55:09] that was the despondent posture did
[1:55:11] something clicked but Thou O Lord
[1:55:16] [Applause]
[1:55:20] and it's okay to go through these
[1:55:22] mountains and valleys because with a

[1:59:06] [Applause]
[1:59:11] Oh blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:59:18] everybody feelin fine you ain't tryin to
[1:59:21] win but the random goes I said Sampson
[1:59:27] wasn't ashamed so that was all in the
[1:59:30] general no let's just go to the specific
[1:59:33] a little bit the first time the word
[1:59:36] shame is found anybody knows in the book
[1:59:41] of Genesis chapter 2 in fact it's the
[1:59:45] last verse in Genesis 2 speaks of the
[1:59:50] man or woman was there and they were
[1:59:51] naked and not to shame that's whole
[1:59:53] chapter 2 ends for the whole of chapter
[1:59:56] 1 and chapter 2 there's no reference of
[1:59:58] discipline disciplined enters the drama
[2:00:01] at the beginning of chapter 3
[2:00:03] so throughout Genesis 1 it's the
[2:00:06] unfolding of creation and as a
[2:00:09] punctuation to every day God says it was
[2:00:13] good it was so good that God felt
[2:00:16] pleased he didn't feel any shame because
[2:00:22] he was happy with what was unfolding and
[2:00:25] when Genesis 1 is complete in left man
[2:00:28] as a spirit man but by Genesis 2 this
[2:00:32] spirit man is now given a body of flesh
[2:00:35] dust man as it were and then surgery
[2:00:39] takes place and God pulls a rib out and
[2:00:43] out of this man comes a woman and the
[2:00:45] Bible said they were naked and they were
[2:00:48] not ashamed
[2:00:52] now this nakedness is not just physical
[2:00:56] this nakedness is meaning there's
[2:01:00] nothing hidden so it's not just physical
[2:01:05] there is there's nothing to hide it in
[2:01:07] other words
[2:01:08] Adam and Eve had no secrets there was no
[2:01:12] barrier between them and God he had
[2:01:16] access to see through their mind their
[2:01:18] heart their desires they were naked and
[2:01:20] they were not ashamed there was nothing
[2:01:22] to him a perfect
[2:01:27] when the Bible makes a point about
[2:01:30] something it is to draw reference to
[2:01:33] something specific so I wonder why would
[2:01:35] chapter 2 end they were naked and they
[2:01:37] were not ashamed God was pleased to say
[2:01:41] there was nothing for them to be ashamed
[2:01:44] about
[2:01:44] but when sin came sin brought sickness
[2:01:49] sin brought pain sin brought sadness and
[2:01:54] sin also brought Shem bear with me
[2:01:59] not me too much longer when sin came it
[2:02:11] brought a barrier and that barrier of
[2:02:15] Shem left her hiding shame led to guilt
[2:02:24] Jim led to denial shame it was shame
[2:02:29] that led to covering up it was shame
[2:02:33] that led to I can't tell anybody it was
[2:02:36] shame and led to let me just keep on
[2:02:39] acting as if everything is all right it
[2:02:42] was shame that letter I hope he doesn't
[2:02:46] call me shame that led to I hope she
[2:02:49] doesn't see me shame and let I hope he
[2:02:51] doesn't maybe check my fond shame and
[2:02:56] there are so many reasons that
[2:03:05] but the Branham said the word ashame
[2:03:07] could be translated as embarrassed you
[2:03:11] faced with something that you
[2:03:12] embarrassed about and there different
[2:03:14] kinds of shame the shame of sin the
[2:03:17] shame of failure the shame of your past
[2:03:19] the shame of being barren the shame of
[2:03:23] being in church and maybe not having a
[2:03:25] real testimony to the shame of not
[2:03:27] feeling successful and maybe you feel
[2:03:30] pressured because other people are and
[2:03:32] you think you're not and you feel
[2:03:33] ashamed
[2:03:34] shion of your financial situation shame
[2:03:37] of and there's so many reasons that
[2:03:39] because none of this existed before
[2:03:43] sinking
[2:03:44] there was no constructing Adams
[2:03:47] situation about poverty in wealth and
[2:03:49] health and sickness these things not
[2:03:52] exist these are all the byproducts of
[2:03:54] man's fall from his position in God
[2:03:58] Webster dictionary defines the term
[2:04:01] shame as a feeling of disgrace or guilt
[2:04:04] a feeling of inferiority or unworthiness
[2:04:07] shame is that negative feeling or
[2:04:09] emotion we kept me inside of ourselves
[2:04:12] when we know we're not acting the way
[2:04:14] we're supposed to act when we know we
[2:04:18] have done something we had no business
[2:04:19] doing so we spent half of the service
[2:04:23] dealing with one aspect of the shame to
[2:04:27] give you the faith to press forward but
[2:04:29] now on an individual level we want to
[2:04:32] expose and pull the shame out of the
[2:04:37] equation that somebody could be
[2:04:38] delivered to be because that shame and
[2:04:44] guilt is hindering your blessing
[2:04:47] but the Branham said unconfessed sin
[2:04:51] hinders the blessings of God on your
[2:04:53] life and they're people who the reason
[2:04:57] it's unconfessed is because of shame is
[2:05:07] described as that awareness in the
[2:05:09] innermost part of our being and lets us
[2:05:11] know that we have transgressed against
[2:05:13] God's law or we have violated one of
[2:05:17] God's commands shame is that guilty
[2:05:19] feeling we get on the inside when we
[2:05:21] know we have offended the very presence
[2:05:23] of God in our hearts God doesn't want us
[2:05:27] walking around as Christians feeling
[2:05:30] ashamed because the word is my people
[2:05:32] shall never be ashamed
[2:05:34] [Music]
[2:05:36] so there's blood for whatever situation
[2:05:40] that has caused that shame but if they
[2:05:46] are shame there it has to be dealt with
[2:05:48] to remove the shame to remove the guilt
[2:05:51] to apply the blood over the situation so
[2:05:54] that you could be free to worship and
[2:05:56] not sit condemned wondering if your
[2:05:58] sacrifice would be accepted by God
[2:06:01] because there was something bothering
[2:06:03] you in your soul
[2:06:05] can we go a little deeper shame was one
[2:06:09] of the reasons the woman at the well
[2:06:11] went when nobody else was there she
[2:06:16] didn't want to hear the comments of how
[2:06:18] many men she had been with she had
[2:06:21] become tired of the whispers so she went
[2:06:24] when nobody else was there and it was in
[2:06:28] the middle of a shame that Jesus met her
[2:06:35] Cerreta Clark a deal with her when
[2:06:37] nobody else was around it was shame and
[2:06:43] let david to become a murderer he had
[2:06:45] abused his power to sleep with another
[2:06:48] man's wife and to cover it up because of
[2:06:50] shame he sent a man to his bed the woman
[2:06:54] really is your blood her situation man
[2:06:57] she could not go to the temple she could
[2:06:59] not cook she could not touch my husband
[2:07:02] she could not touch her children it was
[2:07:04] shame and let her quietly she couldn't
[2:07:07] even touch Jesus because when a woman is
[2:07:11] bleeding under Julia claw she should not
[2:07:14] touch him should not cook so she told
[2:07:20] herself if I could just touch her shame
[2:07:26] push her to decide if I could just like
[2:07:31] the woman at the well King David and the
[2:07:34] woman with the issue of blood I was
[2:07:36] shamed many times can lead us to higher
[2:07:38] in the wrong places
[2:07:41] shame leads us to be isolated because we
[2:07:44] don't know what we could tell anybody we
[2:07:47] don't want nobody to know we don't want
[2:07:49] we hide in our homes or away from our
[2:07:53] homes we hide in our bedrooms we hide in
[2:07:56] our offices we hire in office work house
[2:08:00] work yard work we hide behind computers
[2:08:04] and phones and newspapers and magazines
[2:08:08] behind behind headphones Netflix TV
[2:08:15] sports world cup we hide behind fashion
[2:08:20] education careers
[2:08:22] Facebook and we hide in church we hide
[2:08:26] in prisoners and procrastination we hide
[2:08:30] allies and diversionary conversation we
[2:08:34] hide behind laughter and humor and jokes
[2:08:37] and solidness we hide behind bravado and
[2:08:40] being a man and being macho and timidity
[2:08:43] and shyness
[2:08:45] we hide in extraversion and introversion
[2:08:57] today we want to remove that shame
[2:09:02] because when Jesus came he came to take
[2:09:05] away the shame of sin the shame of
[2:09:08] failure shame of mistakes the shame of
[2:09:11] this struggle in your marriage in your
[2:09:13] life in your whatever it is I remember
[2:09:20] schoolteacher years ago he said that's
[2:09:22] big shame and they're small Jim I've sat
[2:09:27] in classroom with students who were
[2:09:29] ashamed to say I didn't understand that
[2:09:30] and the teacher said that small Jim
[2:09:34] small shame is in class because you
[2:09:38] don't want teacher ask anyway understand
[2:09:40] and if we say yes and you know you will
[2:09:42] get it but because of shame you know was
[2:09:45] a circle he repeated one more time and
[2:09:48] because you're ashamed there's big shame
[2:09:51] coming you going the exam people come
[2:09:54] and other people who really understand
[2:09:56] drinking people hang up you there and
[2:09:59] the favored example is this know how
[2:10:01] much more time you have if you don't
[2:10:03] know the answer the answer is not coming
[2:10:06] I still work and stop lying and not
[2:10:14] still working even that is shame P
[2:10:16] artists to say I don't know I've done I
[2:10:18] have no more answers with I think my dad
[2:10:22] to me one time i schooled principal or
[2:10:24] somebody a reverend came to the school
[2:10:25] you say lord bring back to their memory
[2:10:28] everything they studied and those who
[2:10:30] haven't studied lord help them shame
[2:10:44] it's better to say I need help I'm in
[2:10:47] trouble
[2:10:48] I don't know it's okay because if I
[2:10:56] don't know admitting you don't know is
[2:10:58] the first step for you reaching out to
[2:10:59] get to help everybody busy anybody have
[2:11:04] stuff to do doctors listen to carefully
[2:11:08] doctors don't walk around the street how
[2:11:10] you feeling how you feeling how you
[2:11:12] feeling how you feeling but it's when
[2:11:18] you're in pain you find yourself by the
[2:11:22] doctor it is extremely difficult for the
[2:11:25] pastor to call everybody how are you
[2:11:27] doing you pray you read Bible you're on
[2:11:30] fire you living right how's it testimony
[2:11:33] house you live in great you're on fire
[2:11:35] and how many people to testify to this
[2:11:42] week it's extremely difficult but if you
[2:11:45] are struggling
[2:11:46] don't let him hold you back from seeing
[2:11:50] beloved this is what is going on can you
[2:11:54] talk to me or send somebody to talk to
[2:11:55] me and God has blessed us but if you
[2:11:58] feel you don't want to call him you call
[2:12:00] me if you know commit you corporatist
[2:12:02] even because we work together for the
[2:12:07] benefits of the scenes so you can get
[2:12:11] the help you need because we have to
[2:12:13] make it together there is no joy in
[2:12:19] making it if I'm there at the finish
[2:12:22] line and I look back and there's nobody
[2:12:24] with me the race is not for the Swift
[2:12:29] but we have to endure until the end
[2:12:36] could you to join me for one minute I
[2:12:39] want to demonstrate something but now
[2:12:51] you see when you fighting a battle like
[2:12:53] this with your hands locked brother
[2:12:56] Jorge join me please whether Alexis lock
[2:13:03] your hands I lock it tight now if he
[2:13:10] stands alone I could push him over but
[2:13:14] because his hand is locked it becomes
[2:13:17] very difficult because pushing him look
[2:13:20] what happens on the other side I start
[2:13:25] to pull those are nice if I come and
[2:13:27] push with a George on this side it
[2:13:28] affects him too as a body of Christ our
[2:13:33] unity is our strength and the devil's
[2:13:37] job is to try to break this but the
[2:13:40] banner what connects us is love and if
[2:13:44] the planner is love and we create no
[2:13:47] room for the devil
[2:13:52] then the devil has no room now listen we
[2:13:55] sing the song Satan will be bound a
[2:13:58] thousand years he'll be bound by
[2:14:01] circumstance circumstance means there's
[2:14:03] no room for him to operate because if
[2:14:06] the devil can find no space in him no
[2:14:09] space in heaven no space in him no space
[2:14:12] in him no space the devil has nobody to
[2:14:15] use and as a church divided we fall
[2:14:21] but united no devil could break down the
[2:14:25] barrier break down the wall so I'm
[2:14:28] calling for the church and I'm speaking
[2:14:31] in his local church foster unite in
[2:14:33] prayer unite and fit unite with one
[2:14:36] another and my people shall never meet a
[2:14:41] Lord bless you Thank You brothers no
[2:14:48] room for the devil no room for jealousy
[2:14:51] no room for envy no room for animosity
[2:14:55] your pain is my pain your victory is my
[2:14:58] victory oh come on now he cares for us
[2:15:03] He loves us and we have to love one
[2:15:07] another give the Lord a hand oh praise
[2:15:10] [Music]
[2:15:10] [Applause]
[2:15:13] I pray somebody got help this morning so
[2:15:24] shame leads us to hide the issue is not
[2:15:27] so much to hiding it's where me I don't
[2:15:32] hide in solitude don't hide in pain
[2:15:37] bring it under the blood the blood will
[2:15:41] hang it better than anything else
[2:15:43] Christian and when it comes under the
[2:15:46] blood it's permanently hidden because
[2:15:48] the only record that matters is his
[2:15:51] record oh come on now the only record
[2:15:55] he's the only one I want to please once
[2:16:01] he approves I'm fine you know it would
[2:16:04] have Stefan look at me upset all service
[2:16:06] and I try to adjust what I'm seeing I'm
[2:16:08] not picking on her Stefan jess is an
[2:16:10] example he's not looking at me upset I
[2:16:12] can't use him as my validation my job
[2:16:19] this morning my assignment this morning
[2:16:22] is to please him and for people who are
[2:16:25] hiding in problem in pain in doubt and
[2:16:29] feel whatever it is for the shame of
[2:16:32] hiding to be moved that you could go
[2:16:34] free that the upcoming convention you
[2:16:36] can come with such a joy because you
[2:16:39] could say take the whole world to give
[2:16:41] me Jesus forget anything enough pasta I
[2:16:44] leave it behind I press towards the mark
[2:16:48] for the price this is powerful the woman
[2:17:06] and the well she couldn't go where
[2:17:09] others were going but look at what
[2:17:11] happens when Jesus starts you do they
[2:17:16] say how many go call your husband
[2:17:20] something she was supposed to be ashamed
[2:17:22] about she said well I have none
[2:17:24] I just say well that's true okay I've
[2:17:27] had what four or five and I wonder what
[2:17:28] I said when she was delivered
[2:17:31] she ran I tell everybody come see a man
[2:17:34] who told me all about my problems see
[2:17:40] him Gordon no more scheming no more
[2:17:45] embarrassment enough nobody could bring
[2:17:47] up a pass anymore because she is not
[2:17:49] free of it she know about testimony I
[2:17:53] used to have Eichmann put up free all of
[2:18:02] a sudden what was negative becomes a
[2:18:06] positive because it's a line of
[2:18:08] bloodline that separates a class so
[2:18:11] anything over that line don't ask me
[2:18:14] about it it's underneath the blood oh
[2:18:17] come on
[2:18:19] somebody preached back to me that's why
[2:18:22] the Bible says who the son of man set
[2:18:24] free I'm almost finished
[2:18:48] do over the issue of blood Yeshua Jesus
[2:18:51] has this issue with you hiding stuff now
[2:18:55] God knows everything so when this woman
[2:18:57] touched him he could have discerned
[2:19:00] hila she went away in hiding because she
[2:19:03] came in secret he could have allowed her
[2:19:08] to go back in secret you know how nice
[2:19:10] his story would have been she touched
[2:19:12] him slip back out was healed and we
[2:19:16] would never know about it
[2:19:19] but as if she doesn't make out he said
[2:19:24] who Dutchman come way way higher in you
[2:19:34] Cassius when I went to our first issue
[2:19:36] in Sonora and we are know who touched me
[2:19:41] even Peter and even make or gorilla
[2:19:44] whatever Jesus
[2:19:45] everybody here he said what this is
[2:19:48] different
[2:19:48] this woman came in higher than she came
[2:19:51] in shame she came in secret and she make
[2:19:53] our withdrawal and extraordinary
[2:19:55] withdraw because I felt she left me this
[2:19:58] is a real blessing she actually make a
[2:20:00] withdrawal the account Cielo hit he
[2:20:03] liked impact because her need was so
[2:20:05] great she activated principles and laws
[2:20:08] chemistry and biology and because she
[2:20:12] will heal so it mean the hospital in
[2:20:14] heaven went into action angels was it
[2:20:19] was a new womb a new condition things

[2:22:17] people there sitting on for years and
[2:22:19] moving because people just have feet

[2:25:42] let me never be ashamed deliver me in
[2:25:45] thy righteousness he is here this
[2:25:54] morning musicians
[2:26:08] frenzy the hour is late and we speak
[2:26:16] about it about the door is about to
[2:26:20] close and I heard a gentleman general
[2:26:26] and Experion that he had and maybe
[2:26:32] you've had to take a plane at some point
[2:26:35] and with a plane there's a time to check
[2:26:38] in and there's a time to board and
[2:26:43] typically when boarding is about a
[2:26:46] wrapped-up if there anyone who has been
[2:26:49] checked in who he's on the plane it's
[2:26:52] not to make a call so calling anthony
[2:26:58] o'brien to flight 201 to wherever and
[2:27:03] the gentleman said that he was somehow
[2:27:06] caught up somewhere in the airport and
[2:27:08] he really miscalculated how far he was
[2:27:12] from the gate and he heard the name he
[2:27:15] heard his name called and he started to
[2:27:18] move as quickly as you could to the gate
[2:27:23] he said but when he got to the gate they
[2:27:26] told him he asked where's flight 201
[2:27:31] they're like that's a plane right there
[2:27:34] yeah well I'm on a plane he said but we
[2:27:36] just closed the door
[2:27:38] he said but the plane is right there he
[2:27:41] said that's that's that that's nothing
[2:27:42] to do with it we already called the last
[2:27:45] call and the door is shut and here he is
[2:27:49] standing watching the plane it hasn't
[2:27:52] even left yet it's still there but the
[2:27:57] door is shut and he cannot go on
[2:28:00] [Music]
[2:28:03] and he is a preacher and he was saying
[2:28:06] he stood there and it hit him the
[2:28:09] reality of this store being shot because
[2:28:15] he said people would be witnesses of
[2:28:18] this door being shorter but the Branham
[2:28:21] said they're commenting when there'll be
[2:28:23] young people at the altar and they'll be
[2:28:26] praying for salvation praying for
[2:28:28] deliverance but never really crossed the
[2:28:31] line
[2:28:32] you know what it is to be at the altar
[2:28:35] praying and there's no hope you had the
[2:28:39] altar looking for help but there's no
[2:28:43] God available to help you the Bible said
[2:28:47] I'd like to seek it alone while he may
[2:28:49] be found this conditional calling upon
[2:28:52] him while he is near and I asked myself
[2:28:55] the question are you ready do you really
[2:29:02] want to be a Christian are you really
[2:29:05] ready to give up the cares of this life
[2:29:09] give up your ambitions give up your
[2:29:12] desires give up what your plans are
[2:29:16] because his plans are different from
[2:29:18] your plans his hopes are different from
[2:29:23] your hopes his expectations are
[2:29:26] different from your expectations young
[2:29:29] woman you don't need make-up if the
[2:29:32] people in the world need it that's them
[2:29:34] you are too beautiful to need make-up
[2:29:40] you don't need to be like them you need
[2:29:44] to walk like them you're manually to act
[2:29:47] like the men of this world you are sons
[2:29:50] and daughters of the Living God and
[2:29:52] don't let nobody tell you otherwise he
[2:29:55] said my people will never be ashamed
[2:29:58] never never never be ashamed to say I
[2:30:06] believe this gospel
[2:30:08] I believe in holiness Hollywood has made
[2:30:12] fornication acceptable homosexuality
[2:30:17] acceptable it's a worldwide agenda in
[2:30:20] some parts of the world you can't even
[2:30:23] see these things anymore
[2:30:26] because the word tells us that Satan is
[2:30:30] the god of this evil age so he is
[2:30:34] running things in the government in the
[2:30:36] media running things on social media
[2:30:39] running things to distract you and to
[2:30:42] make you insensitive insensitive till it
[2:30:47] becomes normal till you accept it can
[2:30:51] you say hey this is this is normal but
[2:30:55] God cannot change sin is still sin
[2:31:00] heaven is still heaven heaven still L
[2:31:03] right is still right wrong is still
[2:31:06] wrong the government cannot legislate
[2:31:09] righteousness no movement I'm not
[2:31:15] ashamed in the dark ages you had a
[2:31:20] choice do you believe in Jesus and you
[2:31:25] had a choice you could have been Ashima
[2:31:26] see no I don't and they would leave here
[2:31:27] alone but if you stood and say yes I
[2:31:30] believe you know it was lying you knew
[2:31:33] it was crucifixion you knew it was some
[2:31:36] type of persecution and they died a
[2:31:39] glorious death because they were not
[2:31:42] ashamed but we live in a different day
[2:31:46] it's not physical that it's spiritual
[2:31:49] death and people are dead dying or badly
[2:31:52] wounded in the message because they have
[2:31:55] compromised and what God taught us
[2:31:57] through the scriptures and through the
[2:31:59] Prophet what I'm calling for us to
[2:32:02] return to the old landmark
[2:32:04] to return to what our forefathers built
[2:32:07] to return to the alpha church that was
[2:32:09] established on the day of Pentecost when
[2:32:12] the Holy Spirit moved through the camp
[2:32:16] may God remove the shame here we go
[2:32:20] remove the pinion in the church we go
[2:32:22] remove the sadness McGaw remove all of
[2:32:25] your thoughts of your past and and may
[2:32:28] you walk from this day on like you've
[2:32:30] never walked before knowing that God is
[2:32:33] going to give you to a Holy Ghost forget
[2:32:35] that worldly boyfriend forget that
[2:32:37] worldly girlfriend you know what brother
[2:32:39] Branham said under no circumstances
[2:32:43] should I believe I marry an unbeliever
[2:32:48] no circumstances
[2:33:01] god help us as you go through the word
[2:33:06] and you see where the standard is and
[2:33:10] where we have drifted may God bring us
[2:33:13] back to real sincerity but Aaron said
