[48:36] pastor this evening
[48:38] amen and before he comes i just want to
[48:41] greet the church so if you have your
[48:43] bibles just one verse
[48:45] in first thessalonians chapter 5
[48:48] just one verse of scripture we're going
[48:51] to read
[48:53] just so i can greet you and and the
[48:55] pastor will
[48:56] preach tonight so first thessalonians 5
[49:01] and reading from verse
[49:06] verse 18.
[49:10] first thessalonians 5 and verse 18.
[49:16] and the bible says in everything give
[49:18] thanks
[49:20] for this is the will of god in christ
[49:24] jesus concerning you
[49:26] i want to read it one more time in
[49:27] everything give thanks
[49:29] for this is the will of god in christ
[49:32] jesus concerning you may the lord
[49:34] add a blessing to the reading of his
[49:36] word you may be seated
[49:38] and certainly i want to give thanks
[49:41] tonight
[49:43] to be in the land of the living i want
[49:45] to give thanks tonight
[49:47] that we could give god worship i want to
[49:50] give thanks tonight that he is god and
[49:52] he chose me and he chose you i want to
[49:55] give thanks tonight
[49:56] that i may have fallen down but he kept
[49:59] me back up
[50:01] i want to give thanks tonight that even
[50:02] though we had our ups and downs we have
[50:04] made it to this point tonight
[50:06] and i was saying that you know there's
[50:08] so many reasons to be thankful and many
[50:10] of us don't understand how
[50:11] important it is to give thanks and many
[50:14] don't even realize that it is the will
[50:16] of god
[50:17] it is in his will so many times you talk
[50:20] about the
[50:20] will of god and the will of god and the
[50:23] purpose of god and the plan of god and
[50:25] we talk about adoption
[50:26] and we talk about perfection and that is
[50:28] all part of it yes but it's also a will
[50:30] of god
[50:31] that we be thankful so as a christian we
[50:34] identified it in bible studies a few
[50:36] weeks ago we cannot be complaining
[50:38] as a christian complaining cannot be
[50:40] part of your vocabulary
[50:41] it can be part of your daily walk god
[50:44] doesn't have complainers in the kingdom
[50:46] what he has are people that are thankful
[50:48] because as bad as things may ever get
[50:50] there's still a reason in there
[50:52] to give god thanks oh hallelujah
[50:55] so i asked i said what can i encourage
[50:58] the people with
[50:59] at the end of this year that has been
[51:01] like no other year
[51:02] is you have a reason to give god thanks
[51:04] through it all
[51:05] you could thank him through the trials
[51:08] you could thank him
[51:09] through the ups and downs you could
[51:11] thank him can the church say amen
[51:14] oh i believe one of the challenges is we
[51:17] don't thank god enough
[51:18] we don't find enough reasons to thank
[51:20] god i was speaking about over a few days
[51:22] ago
[51:23] the fact that you woke up this morning
[51:24] is a reason to thank god
[51:26] i can't understand christians who don't
[51:28] have a reason to worship and to thank
[51:30] and to praise god
[51:31] because every if you look at everything
[51:34] that happened to you
[51:35] there's a reason in there for you to
[51:37] thank god there's a reason we need to
[51:39] thank god
[51:40] for sending a message to catch your
[51:42] attention oh hallelujah
[51:44] you didn't find this message this
[51:46] message from you that's a reason to
[51:48] thank god
[51:48] you didn't oh come on now you may be
[51:51] seated
[51:52] just a few words before the pastor comes
[51:54] but i feel so thankful
[51:56] that he chose me he didn't have to do it
[51:58] but he did
[51:59] i'm one in a million and that's a reason
[52:01] to thank god
[52:03] oh hallelujah oh before you complain
[52:06] thank god before you get into an
[52:08] argument thank god
[52:10] before you go and bad talk somebody
[52:12] thank god
[52:13] and watch your situation change oh
[52:16] can the church say amen oh
[52:19] hallelujah you maybe see that you know
[52:22] we sing that song count your blessings
[52:24] one by one
[52:25] count your blessings name them one by
[52:27] one and there's a reason to name them
[52:29] one by one
[52:30] because if you look at the negativity
[52:32] and you look at all that went wrong and
[52:34] and this didn't work out and that didn't
[52:36] work out you could spend your time
[52:38] in that realm but if you want to spend
[52:40] your time in all of the reasons
[52:42] that you have to thank god for he didn't
[52:44] have to do it but he did he sent a
[52:46] prophet
[52:47] he sent paul he sent iranians he sent
[52:50] martin
[52:50] he sent columba when the devil tried to
[52:52] bring a negative talk you just begin to
[52:54] thank god
[52:55] he sent a prophet he sent a message oh
[52:57] come on now
[52:58] he tied at the cross for you he sent his
[53:01] son all of that is a reason to thank god
[53:03] can the church say amen
[53:05] oh and we can thank him for the promise
[53:08] the promise of healing
[53:09] the promise of revival the promise of
[53:11] deliverance the promise of adoption
[53:13] the promise of the baptism of the holy
[53:15] ghost can the church say amen
[53:18] you may be seated i'm almost finished
[53:21] i'm just a thing that even jesus
[53:23] when he was on the earth they brought
[53:25] five loaves
[53:26] and two fishes to him and my bible tells
[53:29] me i don't know about your bible
[53:31] but my bible says that when he had given
[53:33] thanks
[53:36] the moment he gave thanks it didn't even
[53:39] say he prayed it just said when he gave
[53:40] thanks
[53:41] he said go share it so as thanks is
[53:44] connected to power
[53:45] or you didn't realize this huh the
[53:47] moment you be that's why when the
[53:49] prophet
[53:49] was praying for people to say thank god
[53:51] for your healing he didn't even tell him
[53:53] go pray for your healing because he says
[53:55] go your way you're healed he said just
[53:56] leave your thank him just thank god for
[53:59] your healing
[54:00] walk the street and say i thank you for
[54:01] your healing i thank you for healing
[54:03] i thank you for my children being
[54:05] delivered and there's a prophecy over
[54:07] you
[54:07] that this gospel is to you and to your
[54:09] children and to them that are foul
[54:11] it's time to thank god for the
[54:13] deliverance of your family
[54:15] it's time to thank god for your healing
[54:17] can the church say amen
[54:20] listen when jesus went at the grave of
[54:23] lazarus
[54:25] the bible tells me that then they took
[54:28] away the stone from the place where the
[54:29] dead was laid
[54:30] and jesus lifted up his eyes and said
[54:32] father i thank thee so the first thing
[54:35] that jesus did before doing anything in
[54:37] that situation
[54:38] was a father i thank thee that thou has
[54:41] hurt me
[54:42] when how thankful are you every day
[54:45] there's a reason to thank god
[54:46] oh hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the
[54:49] name of the lord
[54:50] i'm almost done in the message
[54:53] expectation
[54:54] brother said i'm expecting great things
[54:56] are you expecting great things
[54:58] are you expecting greater than what you
[55:00] have seen are you expecting greater than
[55:02] what you have heard
[55:03] are you expecting greater than what you
[55:04] have experienced by the brahms and i'm
[55:06] expecting great things
[55:08] and that expectancy will get that unity
[55:12] among the people
[55:13] so expectation will bring unity
[55:16] people will be reunited because they're
[55:18] expecting something from god
[55:20] they'll be united not to hear man but to
[55:23] get an experience with god
[55:25] and listen to the prophet that's what
[55:26] happened on the day of pentecost
[55:29] what brought the holy ghost in the first
[55:31] place they went up there and stayed 10
[55:33] days
[55:34] and nights until they were all in one
[55:36] place
[55:37] and with one accord blessing god for
[55:39] something
[55:40] that they did not have
[55:42] [Music]
[55:43] listen to the prophet now they were
[55:45] blessing god for something
[55:46] that they did not have is that right
[55:48] they were thanking god i'm reading the
[55:50] prophet
[55:51] they were thanking god for the holy
[55:52] ghost the holy ghost had not even come
[55:55] yet
[55:56] but they had it in seed form so they
[55:58] hadn't got it yet
[56:00] they hadn't received it yet but the
[56:02] thanks that they were giving
[56:03] was in anticipation of what was going to
[56:05] happen what are you expecting tonight
[56:07] what are you expecting this year what
[56:09] are you expecting for your house
[56:11] what are you expecting for your family
[56:13] whatever that expectation is
[56:15] i encourage you beginners thank god
[56:17] don't wait for 2021
[56:19] beginners thank god right now can the
[56:20] church say amen
[56:22] i'm almost done in god revealing himself
[56:25] to his people
[56:26] the word is a seed is that right that a
[56:29] sower sword in the ground
[56:31] and every seed will bring forth of its
[56:33] kind
[56:34] if you need salvation the seed is here
[56:36] if you need
[56:37] healing here's a seed in the word the
[56:39] word of god is a seed put it in your
[56:41] heart
[56:42] don't dig it up every morning to see if
[56:44] it's sprouted put it in there and leave
[56:46] it there
[56:47] it's god's business to bring for the
[56:49] harvest
[56:50] let me say it one more time it's god's
[56:52] business to bring forth the harvest
[56:54] you just leave it there water it by
[56:57] faith
[56:57] and praise every day thanking god for it
[57:01] oh um come on now come on now come on
[57:03] now oh
[57:04] i'm about done just three scriptures
[57:07] psalms 100 verse 4
[57:08] the bible says enter into his gates with
[57:11] thanksgiving
[57:12] so when you come into the house of the
[57:14] lord this will be thanksgiving all over
[57:16] you
[57:16] this will be thanksgiving all over you
[57:19] people ought to recognize that you have
[57:21] a reason to thank god
[57:22] and enter his courts with praise the
[57:24] psalmist david repeats it
[57:26] he said be thankful unto him and bless
[57:29] his name
[57:30] so the thankfulness was connected to
[57:32] blessing his name
[57:33] for the lord is good isn't he good for
[57:36] the lord is good
[57:37] his mercy is everlasting and his truth
[57:41] endure it to all generations
[57:44] just two more scriptures and i'm done in
[57:46] philippians 4
[57:48] 6 listen to the listen to paul's letter
[57:51] here
[57:51] be careful for nothing don't be anxious
[57:54] for nothing
[57:55] all the things you're trying to put in
[57:56] place don't be anxious for it
[57:59] but in everything by prayer and
[58:01] supplication listen
[58:02] with thanksgiving so if you're praying
[58:05] and you
[58:06] have supplication and there's no
[58:08] thanksgiving
[58:09] then this scripture cannot be completed
[58:11] come on now somebody help me
[58:13] with prayer and supplication with
[58:16] thanksgiving
[58:17] let your requests be made known unto god
[58:20] hallelujah and the peace of god which
[58:23] pass it all understanding
[58:25] shall keep your hearts and minds through
[58:27] christ jesus
[58:28] my last scripture first chronicles 16 34
[58:31] all give thanks unto the lord for he is
[58:34] good
[58:35] for his mercy endure it forever and
[58:37] that's my testimony at the end of 2020
[58:41] in a year that the ecclesiastical realm
[58:43] didn't know what to do with it the
[58:45] political realm didn't know what to do
[58:46] with it the doctors are struggling with
[58:48] what to do with it the world is crippled
[58:50] trying to figure out
[58:52] what to do with it we can give thanks
[58:54] unto the lord
[58:55] for he is good his mercy endure it
[58:58] forever
[58:58] he has never let his sheep beg bread he
[59:01] has never
[59:02] forsaken his righteous and those every
[59:05] sea that is predestinated
[59:07] will come to life and it is god's
[59:09] business i love that quote
[59:11] it is god's business to bring forth the
[59:13] harvest

[1:06:40] hebrews 11 we won from verse 22 to 40.

[1:06:56] grateful to god
[1:06:58] of what it did for us because we
[1:07:00] survived
[1:07:02] we came through holding on and pressing
[1:07:04] on in the feet
[1:07:05] so let's look at matthew 16 familiar
[1:07:07] scripture
[1:07:08] uh when jesus came this was sitting into
[1:07:10] the coast of caesarea philippi
[1:07:13] his disciples saying whom do men say i
[1:07:15] the son of man am that they said
[1:07:17] some said our john the baptist jeremiah
[1:07:20] one of the prophets
[1:07:22] he said unto them but whom say he that i
[1:07:24] am simon peter answered and said
[1:07:26] thou art the christ the son of the
[1:07:27] living god and jesus responds jesus
[1:07:30] answered and said unto him blessed are
[1:07:31] the dull
[1:07:32] sovereign but jonah for flesh and blood
[1:07:34] had not revealed it unto thee
[1:07:36] but my father which is in heaven and i
[1:07:38] see unto
[1:07:39] that i say also unto thee that peter
[1:07:42] and upon this rock i will build my
[1:07:45] church and the gates of hell
[1:07:47] shall not prevail against it and from
[1:07:49] hebrews chapter 11 familiar scripture
[1:07:51] we want to take it from verse 22 by
[1:07:53] faith joseph when he died
[1:07:56] make mention of the departing of the
[1:07:58] children of the of israel
[1:08:00] and give commandment concerning his
[1:08:02] bones
[1:08:03] i hate moses when he was born was hit
[1:08:06] three months of his parents because they
[1:08:07] saw
[1:08:08] he was a proper child and they were not
[1:08:10] afraid of the king's commandment
[1:08:11] but if it moses when he was come to
[1:08:13] years refused to be called the son of
[1:08:15] feral daughter
[1:08:16] choosing rather to suffer affliction
[1:08:19] with the people of god and to enjoy
[1:08:20] pleasures of sin
[1:08:22] for season 26 esteeming to report christ
[1:08:26] greater riches
[1:08:27] than the treasures in egypt for he had
[1:08:29] respect
[1:08:30] unto the recompense of the reward by
[1:08:32] faith of egypt not fearing a wrath of
[1:08:34] the king
[1:08:35] for he endured asean him who
[1:08:38] is invisible through fate he kept the
[1:08:41] passover and the sprinkling of blood
[1:08:43] least he that destroyed the first one
[1:08:46] should touch them

[1:22:22] therefore the god of heaven has blinded
[1:22:24] your eyes
[1:22:25] you're doing like eve did accepting the
[1:22:27] intellectual side
[1:22:29] and know nothing of the spirit of god
[1:22:31] and all brother ulysses message brothers
[1:22:33] tremendously god tell eve and adam adam
[1:22:37] you can eat of all the trees that tree
[1:22:38] limits don't touch
[1:22:40] waiting satan do you get to come satan
[1:22:42] you know
[1:22:43] she said thank you lord for all these
[1:22:45] other trees hallelujah
[1:22:49] you have a million trees million fruit
[1:22:53] and that one tree that god said
[1:22:54] restrictions
[1:22:56] that would satan come and say why would
[1:22:58] he restrict you from that tree
[1:23:00] afterwards all the other trees look very
[1:23:02] unimportant
[1:23:05] all the other trees you get discontented
[1:23:08] it's true he said but god know
[1:23:10] that if you eat of this tree you shall
[1:23:12] be like god you shall have
[1:23:14] knowledge you shall know
[1:23:17] and all god wanted the heart is faith to
[1:23:20] trust
[1:23:22] because when you have faith you don't
[1:23:24] need the information
[1:23:30] when when joshua wanted to cross the
[1:23:31] jordan he needed a bridge
[1:23:35] he's a bridge across to jordan so from
[1:23:38] an
[1:23:38] intellectual standpoint you need an
[1:23:40] engineer you need somebody in the bridge
[1:23:42] building business
[1:23:43] but god does work in a different kind of
[1:23:45] a way god does wall up waters and make a
[1:23:47] way
[1:23:49] you you follow what i'm saying so
[1:23:51] sometimes god answer
[1:23:52] to what you're looking as a problem
[1:23:54] comes different from what your
[1:23:56] expectation is
[1:23:57] because you're using your head and not
[1:23:59] your heart
[1:24:01] that's why it's by faith moses by faith
[1:24:03] samson
[1:24:04] by faith all these people they're
[1:24:06] looking at the head they're looking at
[1:24:08] what god said
[1:24:09] oh give the lord a shout and i'm telling
[1:24:13] you what god said tonight
[1:24:14] he said upon this rock i will build
[1:24:19] my church and the gates of hell
[1:24:23] muster some pastor or some minister the
[1:24:25] case of hell
[1:24:26] must say some message pope the gates of
[1:24:28] hell shall not prevail
[1:24:30] against it when you fight with the devil
[1:24:32] who is man
[1:24:33] oh give the lord some praises come on
[1:24:35] now give me this
[1:24:37] give us some praises when you're doing
[1:24:40] battle with satan who's man
[1:24:42] man just fade away oh glory to god
[1:24:46] hallelujah
[1:24:48] my lord god alone holds the key
[1:24:51] and brother brown this is from christ's
[1:24:52] bishop god revealed he said he's never
[1:24:54] revealed this to you
[1:24:55] my father which is heaven upon this
[1:24:57] revelation here alone
[1:24:59] i'll build my church and the gates of
[1:25:01] hell will never prevail against it you
[1:25:03] see
[1:25:04] watch therefore there is no school no
[1:25:06] theologians
[1:25:07] theologians no teachings of the bible
[1:25:09] among any school that knows anything
[1:25:11] about it they cannot
[1:25:13] know nothing about it it is impossible
[1:25:16] for them to know anything about it
[1:25:17] god has hid the senses of knowing it
[1:25:21] from the very elected teachers it's a
[1:25:25] personal individual affair with the
[1:25:27] person
[1:25:28] that christ is revealed to them and if
[1:25:31] you said his reveal to me
[1:25:33] and then the life of christ produced in
[1:25:34] the bible that same life is in him
[1:25:36] doesn't produce itself and you
[1:25:37] you got the wrong revelation it's a
[1:25:40] question do you have divine revelation
[1:25:43] not understanding not to read something
[1:25:46] but
[1:25:46] have god spoke to you have you got
[1:25:48] revelation like peter i
[1:25:49] said upon this rock i built my church
[1:25:51] peter was a sinful man
[1:25:53] but he got revelation from god he didn't
[1:25:55] read it he was unlearned
[1:25:57] but something revealed to him that means
[1:25:59] god could drop revelation into
[1:26:01] illiterate you don't have to read and
[1:26:02] write
[1:26:03] and god could give you divine revelation
[1:26:05] and that revelation is the rock
[1:26:08] the devil can't take out the devil
[1:26:10] didn't put it he can't take it out
[1:26:12] he can't extract it out that rock
[1:26:15] is what caused those brothers to move
[1:26:17] how they move that
[1:26:19] rock is what called moses to reject
[1:26:21] egypt and all the money and all the
[1:26:23] women
[1:26:24] and all the throne and be identified
[1:26:26] with the mud doubles
[1:26:28] that rock is what help her that
[1:26:31] rock is make them walk amen wandering
[1:26:34] the wilderness
[1:26:35] and in caves and dents it was a
[1:26:37] revelation
[1:26:38] that they didn't belong here they were
[1:26:40] seeking a city whose maker and believer
[1:26:42] is god
[1:26:43] you're fighting to live and you're
[1:26:45] living to die
[1:26:47] what you're holding on to now oh give
[1:26:50] the lord some praises
[1:26:52] let me say it again you're fighting to
[1:26:54] live and you're living to die
[1:26:57] oh glory to god you know all these
[1:26:58] leaders and people they don't think the
[1:27:00] day is coming
[1:27:02] but the day of the lord is coming oh
[1:27:04] glory to god the day
[1:27:06] is coming hallelujah so what god is not
[1:27:10] known by education
[1:27:12] he is not known by how to explain it
[1:27:18] how to explain the mysteries how to
[1:27:20] break the histories how to include
[1:27:22] how to explain the prophet ministry how
[1:27:24] to explain the message that's not how
[1:27:26] god is known
[1:27:27] you say god is known by simplicity and
[1:27:30] the revelation of jesus christ
[1:27:32] in the most illiterate person
[1:27:35] simplicity and revelation oh glory to
[1:27:38] god so who could tell me i don't have a
[1:27:40] revelation
[1:27:41] you're nuts you're crazy you're you're
[1:27:42] what what what you

[1:30:47] hinder you
[1:30:48] nobody was affected christianity that's
[1:30:50] foolishness that's your emotions i was
[1:30:53] devil trapped evil with
[1:30:54] her emotions she said i said get behind
[1:30:56] me satan waited my husband come back
[1:30:58] home
[1:30:58] but he gets into emotions and once you
[1:31:00] get into emotions you get messed up
[1:31:02] but once you get anchored with the word
[1:31:04] no emotion shaken you offer that
[1:31:06] you come here to praise god tonight
[1:31:08] because you know god is able
[1:31:10] to do more abundantly than you can ever
[1:31:12] ask or think
[1:31:14] but i have something to praise god
[1:31:16] gloria god
[1:31:17] amen exact praise god we have something
[1:31:19] to praise god about tonight
[1:31:21] kept us all these years call me when i
[1:31:24] was 17 years old
[1:31:26] i have something to praise god about oh
[1:31:28] god and hallelujah
[1:31:30] [Applause]
[1:31:34] [Music]
[1:31:34] [Applause]
[1:31:36] he said watch by lack of this revelation
[1:31:39] is why we have so much divisions among
[1:31:41] us
[1:31:41] so much mockery so much divisions among
[1:31:44] us is because the people lack that
[1:31:46] revelation
[1:31:46] they lack the revelation the teachers
[1:31:49] very same teachers in this message lack
[1:31:50] revelation
[1:31:51] that would only have bunch of argument
[1:31:53] do revelation have to produce jesus
[1:31:54] christ
[1:31:55] when you come to equal sign up don't
[1:31:57] flip it so flip it so
[1:31:58] hot it's so boiling so bake it so at the
[1:32:00] end of it you have to see jesus
[1:32:02] if you can't love your brother
[1:32:04] afterwards what do you want if you're
[1:32:06] god
[1:32:06] you're going to love god you can't see
[1:32:08] and your brother right around your face
[1:32:09] you can't love him
[1:32:11] i ain't talking about who friendly to
[1:32:12] you you know you have to love the
[1:32:13] unlovable too
[1:32:14] that's all they predict because we were
[1:32:16] unlovable you know we were stinking
[1:32:18] written but god expresses love and send
[1:32:21] grace to us
[1:32:23] so if god had sent grace to you you have
[1:32:26] to know how to extend grace to others
[1:32:28] hallelujah praise god amen so the gates
[1:32:32] of hell he said watch
[1:32:33] babraham said the gates of hell would be
[1:32:34] against it but it could not prevail
[1:32:37] so there are things and forces against
[1:32:38] you but you have to understand tonight
[1:32:41] it can prevail either kevin was back
[1:32:43] sitting halfway back to know you by
[1:32:45] saying right now
[1:32:46] it can't reveal because god is not
[1:32:48] watching who backs it no way backstage
[1:32:49] we were all backstage we all born in
[1:32:51] sinnership inequity
[1:32:52] but our names was on the book that's why
[1:32:54] he called us oh glory to god here check
[1:32:57] your files and say oh god
[1:33:00] you think i should call god not asking
[1:33:02] the angel
[1:33:04] you think she's got he called you first
[1:33:06] put your name first then come down here
[1:33:08] and let you walk around satan's eden and
[1:33:10] satan feel you are one of his own
[1:33:13] oh glory to god but god put something
[1:33:15] inside of you
[1:33:16] and something inside of you is what
[1:33:17] pulling you that's when the word comes
[1:33:19] something pulling inside of you
[1:33:21] because you have to come and perform
[1:33:23] into the world image you bypass your
[1:33:25] theory
[1:33:26] to be tempted and tested you bypass your
[1:33:28] word body
[1:33:29] in order to come from thought to flesh
[1:33:32] to face what we're facing right now
[1:33:34] oh glory to god every man who claimed to
[1:33:37] be superman have to take a seat
[1:33:38] because the rhinovirus had them sitting
[1:33:40] down oh give the lord a praise offering
[1:33:43] they have no power they have been
[1:33:45] exposed
[1:33:46] all them lying prophets all them lying
[1:33:48] preachers
[1:33:49] all them lying teachers they are exposed
[1:33:52] but if william branham was in the earth
[1:33:54] [Music]
[1:33:56] different story altogether because
[1:33:58] everybody knew that was god called man
[1:34:01] god sent prophet but that prophet
[1:34:04] prophesied
[1:34:05] there will be another people in the land
[1:34:09] under their messenger will be the final
[1:34:12] voice
[1:34:13] to the final age oh glory to god
[1:34:17] hallelujah do you believe that tonight
[1:34:19] hallelujah praise be to jesus my
[1:34:23] lord thank you lord praise god
[1:34:26] so the church of the living god
[1:34:28] barramundi hear me is
[1:34:29] built not upon the experience of
[1:34:32] seminary
[1:34:33] or upon a bunch of men creeds it is
[1:34:36] built
[1:34:37] upon the spiritual revelation of god's
[1:34:39] word
[1:34:40] the spiritual revealed truth from god's
[1:34:42] word
[1:34:43] i can't give you revelation
[1:34:48] no man can it take the spirit
[1:34:51] to take the word that being spoken and
[1:34:53] reveal it to you
[1:34:55] and then that's the rock that the devil
[1:34:57] can't touch
[1:34:58] oh my hallelujah praise god so when king
[1:35:02] and evil was offered to worship
[1:35:04] both was sincere one was chosen the
[1:35:06] other one was condemned
[1:35:07] because one had listen the spiritual
[1:35:10] revelation of the will of god
[1:35:13] that's what they had oh my
[1:35:16] hallelujah oh my do you believe that
[1:35:20] so god vindicated one and god rejected
[1:35:22] the other one
[1:35:23] because and bhutan was in the same
[1:35:25] church both of them was worshiping
[1:35:27] but one had spiritual revelation this is
[1:35:30] past is important
[1:35:31] not of information but of the will of
[1:35:34] god
[1:35:35] because that is what faith is you're
[1:35:36] going to read it because once it's
[1:35:38] revealed to you it shows you what to do
[1:35:41] faith is not information to stick in
[1:35:43] your head and you talk it back
[1:35:45] faith have action to it when god tell
[1:35:47] noah listen flood come in you know
[1:35:50] what's the revelation build a ark on dry
[1:35:52] ground with no rain
[1:35:56] so the action of faith was displayed by
[1:35:59] noah doing something that looked almost
[1:36:00] crazy
[1:36:02] how that boat's supposed to float
[1:36:03] there's no water for it and more believe
[1:36:06] god
[1:36:07] that is what we're talking about that's
[1:36:09] what revelation is
[1:36:11] when abraham got revelation you have a
[1:36:13] son here just say our son
[1:36:15] don't talk to nobody you know because it
[1:36:17] will be old
[1:36:19] that's not how abram moved ibrahim said
[1:36:21] they get booty
[1:36:22] he must have to make crib abram getting
[1:36:24] doctor visit to see what his body
[1:36:26] feeling and whatnot the doctor said get
[1:36:27] out of the
[1:36:28] old man but abraham believed god not
[1:36:30] that doctor
[1:36:31] he said believe eric sarah sarah's
[1:36:33] wrinkle face
[1:36:35] but he believed god because god is
[1:36:37] faithful that promise
[1:36:39] oh glory to god i believe god tonight
[1:36:42] that something supernatural going to
[1:36:43] happen in your life
[1:36:45] to change your thinking
[1:36:49] because some of you you're thinking have
[1:36:51] to change
[1:36:53] [Music]
[1:36:55] you think defeat you'll lift defeat
[1:36:58] hallelujah take negative you live
[1:37:00] negative
[1:37:01] glory to god you take back sitting you
[1:37:03] live backstage
[1:37:04] you have to change your thinking
[1:37:10] that the gates of hell cannot prevail
[1:37:14] oh hallelujah change your thinking
[1:37:17] you're under covenant change your
[1:37:18] thinking
[1:37:19] oh glory to god you're on the covenant
[1:37:21] change your thinking
[1:37:23] why would god fight for people that was
[1:37:25] going to backslide and die in
[1:37:26] the wilderness a million two million
[1:37:30] people
[1:37:32] and god knew they was going to make it
[1:37:34] when they danced in the bank and they
[1:37:35] shouted and singing specials
[1:37:37] they wasn't going to make it because of
[1:37:39] unbelief because they believed 10
[1:37:41] ministers
[1:37:44] who who paint the picture in your own
[1:37:47] mind
[1:37:48] that they are like grasshoppers nobody
[1:37:50] even painted for them
[1:37:52] they said in our own eyes we were as
[1:37:55] grasshoppers
[1:37:56] and shorty caleb he had to go and stand
[1:37:59] up on a box
[1:38:00] but he was a short man he stopped by the
[1:38:02] box
[1:38:03] and said we are able to take that land
[1:38:07] and people say look at shorty and all
[1:38:10] these ministers talking we can't take it
[1:38:12] a paradox god gets so fed up at them
[1:38:17] but they see god know that he had to

[1:38:49] know holy ghost
[1:38:51] holy ghost oh glory to god we won't be

[1:38:57] hallelujah but abraham said both these
[1:38:59] are in life worshiping the same god
[1:39:01] one who rejected the other receive and
[1:39:03] the only way the one that was received
[1:39:06] could have done anything different from
[1:39:07] his brother it was revealed to him
[1:39:09] could do anything different
[1:39:12] from his brother because it was revealed
[1:39:16] to him for the bible said by faith evil
[1:39:19] offered to god
[1:39:20] a more extreme sacrifice than of cain
[1:39:22] which god testified that he was
[1:39:24] righteous
[1:39:25] and jesus said blessed are dull
[1:39:26] something about jonah for flesh and
[1:39:28] blood

[1:42:42] nature put that inside of that when the
[1:42:44] chick inside the egg read a certain
[1:42:45] stage he's got to bust some pips
[1:42:47] that hit the eggshell because god put it

[1:51:27] give them the spirit who cry out for it
[1:51:31] so the people in the message not cry for

[1:52:20] you see the bible promise it then stay
[1:52:22] right there and crowd about it
[1:52:24] well that's the way we are supposed to
[1:52:26] do
[1:52:27] okay yeah almost there

[1:52:32] wants it he just cry and cry and cry

[1:52:39] screaming hollering nice whole babies as
[1:52:40] beers
[1:52:43] another christian baby you speak to
[1:52:46] reason cry

[1:53:21] materially spiritually financially every
[1:53:24] way possible
[1:53:25] that's how god want to bless you oh
[1:53:28] glory to god
[1:53:29] so hear this part that's the way
[1:53:33] god provided for his people god's
[1:53:35] provided way
[1:53:36] always is to take his word and hold
[1:53:40] on to it until it's vindicated to you
[1:53:43] do you follow me god a provided way is
[1:53:46] to hold on to the promise
[1:53:48] until it makes manifest to you now
[1:53:50] remember i'm on record
[1:53:52] just because you believe it's there that
[1:53:53] don't make it happen
[1:53:56] that's a big one how does it get to this
[1:53:59] just believe
[1:54:00] you believe it's dear that don't make it
[1:54:02] so it will happen

[1:54:05] mean you have a revival
[1:54:07] oh glory to god you've got to want a
[1:54:09] revival you've got to want your son

[1:54:14] [Applause]
[1:54:17] you have got to come upon the basical
[1:54:19] promise and then upon your mental
[1:54:21] attitude towards
[1:54:22] it his word is always what he wants to
[1:54:24] see vindicated
[1:54:25] it will only be vindicated upon certain
[1:54:27] conditions and when you meet those
[1:54:28] conditions
[1:54:29] you will see people can take the word

[1:55:37] closing could begin to pray something
[1:55:41] whosoever hear these sayings of mine and
[1:55:43] with them i will liken him onto a wise
[1:55:45] man who built his house upon a rock
[1:55:47] and the rain descended and the floods
[1:55:50] came and the winds blew and beat up on
[1:55:51] the house
[1:55:52] and it fell not because it was founded
[1:55:55] upon a rock and everyone
[1:55:56] that hear it these scenes of mine and
[1:55:59] doing them not shall be likened to a
[1:56:00] foolish man
[1:56:01] which built his house upon the sun and
[1:56:03] the rain descended and the floods came
[1:56:05] and the winds blew and beat up on the
[1:56:07] rock
[1:56:07] upon the house and great was the fall of
[1:56:09] it and it came to pass when jesus had
[1:56:11] entered these scenes
[1:56:12] the people were astonishing his doctrine
[1:56:14] for he taught them as one of an
[1:56:16] authority
[1:56:17] are not as described so friends in
[1:56:19] closing
[1:56:22] the houses were built and everybody
[1:56:24] shouted and rejoicing because the rings
[1:56:26] that come yet
[1:56:28] the storms can come here just think
[1:56:32] these storms come in and it will test
[1:56:34] what you built upon
[1:56:36] but jesus said somebody said jesus said
[1:56:39] jesus said upon this rock
[1:56:41] i will build my church and the gates of
[1:56:44] hell shall never prevail against it
