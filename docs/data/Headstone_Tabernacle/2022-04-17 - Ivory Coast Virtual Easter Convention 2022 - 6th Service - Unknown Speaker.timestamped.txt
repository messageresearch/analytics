[44:02] much for your blessing
[44:03] uh the blessing that you always after
[44:05] the bread of christ and like i always
[44:07] say i consider one of the highlights
[44:10] and the privilege of my life should be
[44:11] i'll share with you brothers and be
[44:13] fellow libras with you in the lord's
[44:15] vineyard
[44:16] thank you so very much and god richly
[44:18] bless you
[44:21] uh this time i would ask that if you are
[44:23] not standing to please let's stand to
[44:26] our feet as we try to go into the
[44:28] scriptures
[44:29] um
[44:30] and try to read from the word of god
[44:34] i'm reading from three parts of
[44:35] scripture said matthew 24
[44:37] acts 1
[44:39] and revelation 1.
[44:40] say matthew 24 i read from verse 1
[44:43] through verse 3.
[44:44] acts 1 i read verses 6 and 7 and
[44:46] revelation chapter 1 i read verses 1-3
[44:51] say matthew 24 and verses 1-3 read on
[44:54] these wise
[44:55] and jesus went out and departed from the
[44:58] temple
[44:59] and his disciples came to him for to
[45:01] show him the buildings of the temple
[45:04] and jesus said unto them
[45:06] see you not all these things
[45:08] verily i see unto you that shall not be
[45:10] left here one stone upon another that
[45:13] shall not be thrown down
[45:16] and as you set upon the man of olives
[45:18] the disciples came unto him privately
[45:21] saying
[45:22] tell us
[45:23] when shall these things be
[45:27] and what shall be the sign
[45:29] of thy coming
[45:30] and of the end of the world like brother
[45:31] branham said there are three questions
[45:33] there and brother brahma explained
[45:34] verses one and two took place
[45:37] on tuesday morning april the 4th
[45:40] 80 30
[45:41] and that was
[45:43] in the morning the first two verses and
[45:46] because mount the man of olives is a
[45:48] little
[45:48] uh uh uh distance from where they were
[45:51] in the morning he told us that in the
[45:54] evening was when the conversation
[45:56] picked up picked back up again so
[45:59] verse three was in the evening of april
[46:02] the fourth eighty thirty and he said
[46:04] there were three questions here as you
[46:05] can see number one when shall these
[46:08] things be
[46:10] number two what shall be the sign of thy
[46:12] coming and number three
[46:15] what's the sign of the end of the world
[46:17] or when is the end of the world
[46:21] my second scripture acts chapter one
[46:23] verse six and verse seven
[46:26] when the therefore would come together
[46:28] they asked of him saying lord
[46:31] will that at this time restore again the
[46:33] kingdom to israel
[46:36] and he said unto them it is not for you
[46:37] to know the times or the seasons which
[46:40] the father had put in his own power
[46:44] very similar
[46:45] you know to
[46:47] the question
[46:48] said matthew 24 because they wanted to
[46:50] know
[46:51] whether he was going to restore the
[46:53] kingdom to israel at this time
[46:55] the kingdom of god on the face of the
[46:56] earth that's what they were looking for
[46:58] in other words the end of the wall and
[47:00] the setting of god's kingdom and he told
[47:02] them
[47:03] it's not for you to know the times or
[47:05] the seasons
[47:07] that's all in the father's hands and he
[47:08] said matthew 24 they wanted to know the
[47:10] time the sign
[47:12] of his coming and he said the time the
[47:15] hour no man knows not even the son
[47:18] only the father knows
[47:20] and revelation 1 verses 1 to 3
[47:24] reading reads on these wise
[47:26] the revelation of jesus christ which god
[47:27] gave unto him to show unto his servants
[47:30] things which must shortly come to pass
[47:32] and he sent and signified it by his
[47:35] angel unto his servant john
[47:38] who bear record of the word of god and
[47:40] of the testimony of jesus christ
[47:42] and of all things that he saw
[47:45] blessed is either readeth
[47:48] and they that hear the words of this
[47:50] prophecy
[47:51] and keep those things which are written
[47:55] may the lord is a blessing to reading of
[47:56] his holy words you may please be seated
[47:59] so for a little title my title uh this
[48:02] morning is the appearing of the lord
[48:06] a sign of his coming
[48:08] the appearing of the lord a sign
[48:12] of his coming
[48:14] now revelation 22 and verse 20
[48:18] jesus said surely i come quickly that's
[48:21] the last promise in the bible and the
[48:23] very next verse john cried out even so
[48:26] come lord jesus
[48:28] that's the last prayer in the bible
[48:31] now this
[48:33] promise
[48:35] surely i come quickly is like the
[48:37] central theme of the bible the coming of
[48:39] the lord
[48:41] and right from genesis all the way to
[48:43] revelation
[48:44] that's the constant theme of the bible
[48:47] in genesis chapter 3 after adam and eve
[48:50] had seen the fall had taken place and
[48:52] god was you know
[48:54] redesigning the order
[48:56] he spoke in genesis 3 15 about the
[48:58] coming of the seed of the woman which is
[49:01] the coming of the lord and all through
[49:03] the bible we see the coming of lord
[49:05] spoken about
[49:06] but here jesus is coming after he had
[49:08] come the first time he had risen and
[49:11] resurrected he's talking about is coming
[49:15] which is his
[49:17] second coming
[49:18] and he said i come quickly so we find
[49:22] out
[49:22] this coming is going to be a quick walk
[49:25] it's going to be a short quick walk
[49:30] now
[49:30] speaking about the coming of the lord
[49:34] bible readers unlike brother branham
[49:35] taught us
[49:37] he comes three times
[49:40] and also he comes in the name of three
[49:42] sons number one
[49:45] he came
[49:46] to israel as a little babe in the manger
[49:49] that was his first comment
[49:51] second coming
[49:52] he comes
[49:54] to gather his bride of all seven church
[49:57] ages when he comes down for the
[49:59] resurrection
[50:00] the rapture on the going home and number
[50:03] three he comes
[50:05] with his bride
[50:07] in the millennium
[50:08] to reign for a thousand years
[50:12] first time he comes he comes became a
[50:14] son of man
[50:15] second time son of god and in the
[50:18] millennium he'll be the
[50:20] son of david
[50:22] but what concerns us in this uh topic
[50:26] today is the coming of the lord his
[50:29] secret
[50:30] second coming
[50:32] where he said surely i come quickly
[50:35] that's what concerns us here and
[50:39] we message folks no from what brother
[50:41] bannon taught us that we have been in
[50:44] this secret second coming since the
[50:47] seventh seal in the book of redemption
[50:50] brought him back down to earth we have
[50:52] been in this secret second coming it's
[50:54] been going on but how many people know
[50:56] it
[50:57] but thank god
[50:59] we know it
[51:01] the predestination of god has opened our
[51:04] hearts and our understanding to know
[51:06] that we are right now
[51:09] in the coming of the lord
[51:11] now
[51:12] speaking about this coming
[51:18] we are told that there
[51:20] were his first coming was prophesied a
[51:23] lot in the bible
[51:25] but there was more spoken about his
[51:28] second coming
[51:30] most scriptures that pertain and relate
[51:32] to his second coming in the bible than
[51:34] is first coming and these disciples his
[51:37] disciples had known he was talking about
[51:39] going away coming back going away coming
[51:41] back so they wanted to know some more
[51:43] they wanted to some bit of detail and so
[51:47] the conversation we had in luke 24 that
[51:50] we just read
[51:51] was centered around his second coming
[51:54] and they asked him those three questions
[51:56] tell us
[51:57] these things you are saying when are
[51:58] they gonna happen
[52:00] number two
[52:01] tell us the sign of your coming when
[52:04] you're gonna come let's what's the sign
[52:05] number three
[52:07] tell us
[52:08] when the end of the world is gonna be
[52:11] and he didn't answer them
[52:13] specifically like that he just gave them
[52:16] general signs but if you want to watch
[52:18] like brother venom explain he narrowed
[52:21] it all down to
[52:22] the revelation of the seven seals
[52:29] the
[52:30] answer to each of those questions he
[52:33] narrowed it all down to the revelation
[52:36] of the seven seals
[52:38] because the venom completes in matthew
[52:40] 24
[52:41] with the revelation of the seven seals
[52:44] in in the uh on the sixth seal
[52:47] and let us understand when jesus was
[52:49] answering them he was in other words
[52:52] telling them that the answers to these
[52:55] questions
[52:56] are hidden unveiled
[52:58] in the seven seals and specifically
[53:00] about his second coming when he compared
[53:04] the uh um the seals and revision on
[53:07] matthew 24. his second coming we found
[53:11] out is hitting under the seventh seal
[53:13] and it was veiled with a silence in
[53:16] other words silence a secret
[53:19] is secret of god not only to god alone
[53:23] the secret nature revelation
[53:26] and the secret of god can only be
[53:28] revealed
[53:29] to and by a prophet because amos 3 7
[53:32] says the lord god will do nothing
[53:35] until and unless he reverses secrets to
[53:38] his servants
[53:39] the prophets
[53:41] so this secret second coming
[53:44] this is veiled under the seventh seal
[53:48] and is
[53:50] uh uh uh a secret
[53:53] that would only be revealed unfolded
[53:56] veil unveiled unfolded by
[53:58] a prophet
[54:00] now in saint matthew 24 if you uh uh if
[54:03] you want to mark it
[54:04] he had
[54:06] verse four and five saint matthew
[54:08] represented the first seal verse six
[54:11] represented second seal verse seven and
[54:14] verse eight the thought still and on
[54:16] down like that and verses nine to 13
[54:18] represent the fifth seal verses 29 to 31
[54:21] the sixth seal and verse seven i mean uh
[54:24] the seventh sail
[54:26] verse 32 on down but of that day an hour
[54:29] north no man he failed he's coming
[54:32] underneath
[54:34] the silence
[54:36] amen
[54:37] so
[54:40] after he died
[54:42] and rose
[54:44] again and he came back to disciples in
[54:46] the book of acts when he was going back
[54:49] in the
[54:50] ascension
[54:52] they asked him again in acts chapter one
[54:55] they asked him again
[54:59] will you at this time restore the
[55:01] kingdom back to jerusalem to israel in
[55:04] other words this present system is even
[55:07] when is it going to end and are you now
[55:10] going to restore the kingdom back to
[55:12] jerusalem in other words it was
[55:15] very similar question to what they asked
[55:18] enemy said matthew 24
[55:20] and jesus simply told them
[55:22] is not for you to know the times or the
[55:25] seasons which the father has kept in his
[55:27] own hand
[55:29] that's god's secret god alone knows it
[55:32] and he will reveal it when he will
[55:35] reveal it to whomsoever
[55:37] he will but for you go and tarry in the
[55:40] city of jerusalem
[55:42] until you begin deal with power from on
[55:45] high
[55:46] so he covered it up
[55:49] and pushed this coming is a future
[55:52] revelation
[55:53] of the coming of the lord which the
[55:55] father alone knows nobody knows it's not
[55:58] even the son has
[56:00] knows about his own place in it in a
[56:03] very very definite way
[56:07] and so
[56:08] going on down in the scriptures we find
[56:10] revelation chapter one
[56:13] while john was on the isle of patmos for
[56:16] the testimony of jesus christ
[56:19] there came
[56:20] john broke into a vision the lord met
[56:23] him
[56:24] and
[56:25] he gave him the revelation of jesus
[56:28] christ and the bible says like we just
[56:30] read the revelation of jesus christ
[56:34] which god gave to him to tell his
[56:37] servants things which must shortly come
[56:40] to pass
[56:41] and jesus christ sent it through his
[56:45] prophet
[56:47] to his servant
[56:48] john
[56:50] because it's a secret
[56:52] the coming of the lord is a secret
[56:54] and god's secrets are only revealed to
[56:58] and made known to prophets who will
[57:00] speak them to us
[57:02] and that's why he said these things here
[57:05] this revelation of jesus christ which
[57:07] god gave to him the secret that god
[57:10] revealed and gave to the son the son is
[57:14] revealing it now through this series
[57:16] here to
[57:18] on the isle of patmos to john through
[57:20] the prophet
[57:22] to john
[57:24] and so
[57:26] john wrote it all out
[57:28] in symbols
[57:29] and
[57:31] but until that prophet comes on the
[57:33] scene the things are not going to be
[57:35] made really clear we can we can
[57:38] you know group at it and try to make a a
[57:42] sense of all that it is but in terms of
[57:45] real clarity to know what it is to be
[57:49] definite have clarity on the scriptures
[57:51] until that prophet comes on the scene
[57:54] who will take this revelation of jesus
[57:56] christ and revel it to john
[57:59] which is the bride
[58:01] and so remained
[58:02] all down through the
[58:05] church ages
[58:08] until
[58:09] he came to our day and age
[58:12] amen
[58:13] now if you notice
[58:14] revelation 1
[58:18] the religion of jesus christ which is
[58:20] the entire book of revelation
[58:23] you notice a few things there
[58:26] if you look if you go into revelation
[58:28] you see it's broken up into three
[58:31] distinct paths
[58:32] number one the seven church ages number
[58:35] two
[58:36] the opening of the seals
[58:39] and number three
[58:41] the tribulation period and in the end of
[58:43] the world up the way into the new city
[58:46] so number one
[58:48] the church ages number two the seven
[58:50] seals number three three tribulation all
[58:52] the way into the new city the end of the
[58:55] world so
[58:57] this was the
[58:59] in symbol form the answers to the
[59:02] questions that were
[59:05] asked by the disciples of jesus
[59:07] in samadhi 24 in acts chapter 1
[59:11] they wanted to know when shall these
[59:13] things be what shall be the sign of thy
[59:15] coming what shall be the time or the end
[59:17] of the war and the sign of it
[59:19] and so when jesus
[59:22] the father gave the revelation of the
[59:24] coming of the lord to the son
[59:27] he gave the revelation
[59:29] to john through a prophet waiting for
[59:32] the time when that will be really made
[59:35] real
[59:36] on the face of the earth waiting for
[59:38] that prophet to step to come on the
[59:40] scene
[59:40] for it to be unveiled to john the bride
[59:44] and so
[59:47] we understand through there
[59:49] that the revelation of jesus christ
[59:52] has been waiting
[59:54] for that prophet to come on the sin
[59:58] amen
[59:59] so
[1:00:00] uh um um
[1:00:05] in our day and age
[1:00:08] okay down through
[1:00:10] they
[1:00:11] they ignored at a trying to grasp at it
[1:00:14] like
[1:00:15] to to try to understand what is all
[1:00:18] about there because the secret
[1:00:20] is the secret that god
[1:00:23] gave to jesus christ to give to his
[1:00:25] prophet to give to john
[1:00:28] the living element of the bride
[1:00:30] and so
[1:00:32] that i remain
[1:00:33] until
[1:00:34] the end time here when jesus himself
[1:00:38] came down
[1:00:40] and sat at the end of the church ages
[1:00:44] and sat at the top
[1:00:46] of the at the head of the christian
[1:00:48] church
[1:00:50] to
[1:00:52] unveil these things
[1:00:54] to a prophet on the face of the earth at
[1:00:57] the time the prophet william branham
[1:01:00] the prophet elijah the great elijah
[1:01:02] prophet of malachi 4 for the time was
[1:01:05] not at hand
[1:01:07] the time was not at any time to come for
[1:01:10] these things the revelation of jesus
[1:01:12] christ to be unfolded of the
[1:01:15] seven church ages of the seven seals and
[1:01:18] the rapture and the going home and the
[1:01:20] end of the world the time had come for
[1:01:23] this
[1:01:24] truth to be unveiled
[1:01:26] to anoint our understanding with these
[1:01:29] things what the disciples of all were
[1:01:33] longing to look into
[1:01:35] but they could not because the time
[1:01:37] wasn't at hand here like revelation 1
[1:01:39] says for the time is at hand and here we
[1:01:43] are
[1:01:44] jesus christ come down
[1:01:46] and set himself at the head of the
[1:01:47] christian church
[1:01:49] and begin to give this revelation out
[1:01:51] to his prophet who gave it to john
[1:01:55] hallelujah
[1:01:57] so
[1:01:58] the prophet malachi 4
[1:02:00] william branham
[1:02:04] raised up
[1:02:06] and jesus christ unveiled revelation
[1:02:10] after revelation after revelation to him
[1:02:13] answering these questions
[1:02:16] when shall these things be what's the
[1:02:18] sign of the coming of the lord
[1:02:20] and what's the all about the end of the
[1:02:22] world
[1:02:23] and malachi 4
[1:02:25] he
[1:02:27] unveiled the revelation to
[1:02:29] the bride
[1:02:31] oh how blessed and how privileged we are
[1:02:34] to know these things
[1:02:36] because
[1:02:37] the prophet preached on the seven seals
[1:02:40] and he preached on the seven church ages
[1:02:42] to explain all about when these things
[1:02:46] took place and what still to take place
[1:02:48] to explain how the seven church ages
[1:02:52] is part and parcel of the coming of the
[1:02:54] lord because when the disciples as when
[1:02:56] are you coming they had no idea there
[1:02:59] were seven church ages still coming on
[1:03:02] they had no idea there were those of
[1:03:05] their brothers and sisters who were not
[1:03:07] yet you know manifested on the face of
[1:03:09] the earth and they had to wait for them
[1:03:12] for them to even understand at all about
[1:03:14] the coming of the lord because the lord
[1:03:16] was going to come to gather all
[1:03:18] literature not just they
[1:03:20] at that time alone those happens alone
[1:03:21] but every one of his children all the
[1:03:24] way back to adam to take them back with
[1:03:27] him so the
[1:03:28] prophet preached
[1:03:31] the seven church ages
[1:03:35] unveiled all about the seven church ages
[1:03:37] and
[1:03:38] taught us how the seven church ages
[1:03:41] is totally
[1:03:43] sync with the coming of the lord because
[1:03:47] out of the seven churches
[1:03:49] a bride out of each age is gonna form
[1:03:52] that bride that's gonna go in the
[1:03:54] rapture in the skies whether as living
[1:03:57] saints or sleeping saints but they're
[1:03:59] gonna be spread around through the edges
[1:04:00] so he preached
[1:04:02] on the church ages and he preached also
[1:04:04] on the coming of the lord
[1:04:07] the seven seals
[1:04:09] which is the book of the revelation of
[1:04:11] jesus christ
[1:04:12] and in there he unveiled the secret the
[1:04:16] revelation of the mystery of the coming
[1:04:19] of the lord and then in there he also
[1:04:21] preached the thought part of the
[1:04:22] question they asked jesus christ about
[1:04:25] the end of the world and all the things
[1:04:27] that's going to be in the end of the
[1:04:29] world right down into the time that the
[1:04:33] kingdom of god is going to be set up on
[1:04:35] the face of this earth what those
[1:04:37] disciples were asking jesus in the book
[1:04:39] of acts and also in matthew
[1:04:41] so malachi 4 william branham with this
[1:04:45] ministry
[1:04:46] took the revelation of jesus christ on
[1:04:48] the three parts of that revelation
[1:04:50] seven church ages seven seals the
[1:04:53] revelation of the end of the world what
[1:04:56] it's gonna be like how he's gonna come
[1:04:58] malachi for the prophet william branham
[1:05:00] he unveiled and reveal all of those
[1:05:02] things to this living element of the
[1:05:05] bride oh hallelujah
[1:05:08] so william branham
[1:05:10] he preached
[1:05:12] the revelation of jesus christ like i
[1:05:14] said already the revelation of jesus
[1:05:16] christ
[1:05:18] the book of revelation
[1:05:20] you can
[1:05:21] class it in three distinct portions
[1:05:25] seven church ages
[1:05:27] revelation two and three
[1:05:29] then you have
[1:05:31] the seven seals
[1:05:33] tied up with the rapture
[1:05:34] in revelation 4 5 6 7
[1:05:38] 8
[1:05:40] and then you have
[1:05:41] um
[1:05:43] the tribulation period
[1:05:45] and the judgments and the new jerusalem
[1:05:48] and the water in judgment and all of
[1:05:50] that the end of the world you have those
[1:05:52] three distinct groups there but if you
[1:05:55] look in the book of revelation
[1:05:57] it's not it's not like uh uh the the the
[1:06:01] chapters are not you know uh
[1:06:04] line up in order you know
[1:06:07] step by step like after this will be
[1:06:10] this it's here a little very little
[1:06:13] so
[1:06:14] if you notice
[1:06:15] seven church ages
[1:06:17] at the end of it
[1:06:20] revelation two and three the seven
[1:06:21] church ages revelation four chapter one
[1:06:25] the black goes in the rapture
[1:06:27] come up either
[1:06:30] i will show you come up either so that's
[1:06:32] the rapture
[1:06:33] and then
[1:06:34] chapter five we see you know heaven and
[1:06:36] then chapter six the seals are revealed
[1:06:38] and all that
[1:06:39] so the question comes
[1:06:42] how come the bride is going to the
[1:06:43] rapture and then all these things are
[1:06:46] still on the face of the earth how come
[1:06:47] the sales are revealed after the price
[1:06:49] gone the rapture how come revelation 10
[1:06:52] you know elijah's mystery is there when
[1:06:55] the bride is going to rapture how come
[1:06:57] revelation 10 and john is prophesying
[1:06:59] again after i supposed to go in the
[1:07:01] rapture here's the secret here here's
[1:07:03] the revelation here
[1:07:04] because it's not written you know
[1:07:06] scripture by scripture line after line
[1:07:08] no it's it's there here a little there
[1:07:11] is and the revelation is this here
[1:07:13] revelation 3 verses 14 through 22 that's
[1:07:16] the seven churches that's the messenger
[1:07:18] of louisiana that's william branham's
[1:07:20] ministry that's it right there
[1:07:23] unto the angel of church the ladies here
[1:07:24] right
[1:07:26] and that's his mission right there and
[1:07:27] here's the revelation there
[1:07:29] you go in revelation and take every
[1:07:32] scripture every promise that this
[1:07:35] messenger was supposed to reveal you put
[1:07:37] it right under revelation 3 14-22 in
[1:07:40] other words you put under there
[1:07:42] revelation 5. you put on there there
[1:07:45] revision six seven and eight you put
[1:07:47] under there revelation uh uh uh attend
[1:07:50] you put under there first thessalonians
[1:07:52] 4 16 you put under the everything that
[1:07:54] has to do with the coming of the lord
[1:07:56] you put it right there
[1:07:57] and when you do that all you'll have
[1:07:59] left
[1:08:01] from revelation 4 to 19
[1:08:03] are the things that are going to happen
[1:08:04] interpretation period
[1:08:06] you have chapter 11 chapter 12 chapter
[1:08:09] 13 all the way down there when you by by
[1:08:13] revelation put all of the scriptures
[1:08:16] that have to do with this messenger's
[1:08:18] ministry into revelation 3 14 to 22 all
[1:08:22] you have left is everything that's going
[1:08:24] to take place in the tribulation period
[1:08:27] because the bride goes in the rapture
[1:08:29] revelation 4 and verse 1
[1:08:32] and then the tribulation period and the
[1:08:34] end of the war
[1:08:35] takes
[1:08:36] place glory to god
[1:08:40] so
[1:08:40] malachi 4
[1:08:44] he taught us this he showed us the
[1:08:46] scriptures
[1:08:47] he unveiled
[1:08:49] the coming of the lord he unveiled and
[1:08:51] showed us the the the connection between
[1:08:54] the seven church ages and the coming of
[1:08:57] the lord
[1:09:00] they're not it is jonathan because
[1:09:03] there will be no coming of allah if
[1:09:04] there were no seven churches because
[1:09:06] through the seven churches god's spirit
[1:09:09] walking through the church ages the son
[1:09:12] of god
[1:09:14] god sevenfold spirit being
[1:09:17] spread out through the church ages right
[1:09:20] until this age and malacca for came and
[1:09:23] together brought all those spirits
[1:09:26] together the seven manifestations of
[1:09:28] god's holy spirit
[1:09:30] in this age here to unveil and reveal
[1:09:33] these things
[1:09:34] so the seven churches apparent parcel of
[1:09:36] it because they're without us cannot be
[1:09:38] made perfect and malaca had to come to
[1:09:41] reveal the things that were left off
[1:09:44] so that they also can be part of this
[1:09:46] rapture in the skies because they're
[1:09:48] gone but they have to go in the rapture
[1:09:50] in the skies and unless malakai
[1:09:52] with this world the mystery of the or
[1:09:55] the revelation of the mystery of the
[1:09:57] coming of the lord
[1:09:58] there is no way they are going to be
[1:10:00] there
[1:10:01] so
[1:10:03] malachi 4
[1:10:05] revealed
[1:10:07] this revelation
[1:10:09] and here we are
[1:10:11] in the coming of the lord
[1:10:13] that's the theme of the whole bible
[1:10:15] and that's the theme of that prophet's
[1:10:16] message he was sent with the message to
[1:10:18] get a bride together
[1:10:21] to prepare a bride
[1:10:23] for the coming of the lord and that's
[1:10:25] the most important thing you can do
[1:10:26] friends
[1:10:27] to be prepared for the coming of the
[1:10:29] most important thing you can do minister
[1:10:31] brother to prepare your people for the
[1:10:34] coming of the lord nothing else even
[1:10:36] comes close in terms of importance to be
[1:10:39] prepared for the coming of the lord
[1:10:47] in
[1:10:48] letting us understand from the preaching
[1:10:50] of the seals
[1:10:52] and his message
[1:10:54] he let us understand the coming of the
[1:10:56] lord is in the threefold manner
[1:11:01] the lord himself shall stand from heaven
[1:11:03] from first corinthians 14 i'm in first
[1:11:05] corinthians 4 i'm sorry the lord himself
[1:11:07] shall stand from heaven with a shout
[1:11:10] with a voice of the archangel with a
[1:11:11] trump of god and the dead in christ
[1:11:14] shall rise first and let us see
[1:11:17] that the coming of the lord is a shout a
[1:11:19] voice and a trump
[1:11:22] and he also said this coming of the lord
[1:11:26] shared voice trump has an appearing path
[1:11:29] and a calming path
[1:11:32] and let us understand the common path is
[1:11:35] the trump of god
[1:11:38] that's what the bible says
[1:11:40] that's what he taught us
[1:11:42] that's what bible readers know the
[1:11:44] coming of the lord is the trumpet of the
[1:11:46] lord shall sound and time shall be no
[1:11:47] more that's the coming of the lord
[1:11:49] but before the coming there's a shout
[1:11:52] there's the voice of the archangel so
[1:11:54] those represent the appearing part
[1:11:57] now let me read you a quote from brother
[1:11:59] branham here um
[1:12:01] on
[1:12:02] on that
[1:12:06] um excuse me
[1:12:17] all right
[1:12:22] uh
[1:12:38] um
[1:12:40] excuse me um
[1:12:43] all right
[1:12:45] on anytime evangelism brother branham
[1:12:46] said here
[1:12:48] 62
[1:12:52] same thing today
[1:12:55] same thing today
[1:13:03] when you see his work
[1:13:05] now we have already seen and are
[1:13:07] witnessing the appearing of the lord
[1:13:09] now remember
[1:13:11] appearing
[1:13:12] and coming
[1:13:13] is two different words
[1:13:16] to appear and then
[1:13:19] to come
[1:13:23] when i'm coming to your house
[1:13:25] and i appear
[1:13:26] in the distance i haven't come yet but i
[1:13:29] appear and i'm walking towards your
[1:13:31] house
[1:13:32] and that's what he's saying here
[1:13:34] appearing and coming is two different
[1:13:37] words to appear
[1:13:38] and then to come now is the appearance
[1:13:41] listen close now is the appearing
[1:13:44] he's already appeared in these last days
[1:13:47] right here with us
[1:13:49] in the last few years
[1:13:51] now this appearing
[1:13:53] it's a sign of his coming and that's
[1:13:56] where i got my title from the appearing
[1:13:58] of the lord a sign of his coming
[1:14:02] now
[1:14:04] it's a sign of his coming this appearing
[1:14:06] of the lord is a sign of his coming
[1:14:08] do you understand what we're saying here
[1:14:10] they were asking jesus tell us what is
[1:14:13] the sign of your coming
[1:14:16] when shall these things be
[1:14:18] those things were things that were going
[1:14:21] to be explained by the events in the
[1:14:23] seven church ages
[1:14:25] and malachi 4 jesus fell in him
[1:14:28] began to unveil the answers to these
[1:14:31] questions when shall these things be
[1:14:33] what shall be the sign of thy coming
[1:14:36] and here is malacca for here
[1:14:38] letting us know the sign of his coming
[1:14:45] the appearing
[1:14:47] is a sign of his coming
[1:14:49] and he went back he is appearing in his
[1:14:52] church
[1:14:53] in the form of the holy spirit
[1:14:56] showing that it's him
[1:14:58] because people cannot do these things
[1:15:00] that you see the holy spirit doing
[1:15:02] so that's the appearing of the lord now
[1:15:05] remember it spoke both places
[1:15:07] appearing
[1:15:08] and coming this coming of the lord has
[1:15:11] an appearing path as a common path
[1:15:14] the coming path is the trump of god
[1:15:16] every bible reader knows that so
[1:15:19] malakai he's been appearing with us in
[1:15:22] these last few years he's appearing in
[1:15:23] his church
[1:15:25] in other words
[1:15:26] the shout
[1:15:27] the voice
[1:15:29] that's the appearing part
[1:15:31] of the coming of the lord
[1:15:33] hallelujah
[1:15:35] and he said jesus he does all three
[1:15:39] jesus does the shout he does the voice
[1:15:42] he draws the trumpet he does the trump
[1:15:43] of god and in there he's appearing
[1:15:46] before he comes
[1:15:48] at the trump of god so he's been
[1:15:50] appearing with us all these years
[1:15:51] malacca for said
[1:15:53] in the church because all these things
[1:15:55] that you see doing been done man cannot
[1:15:59] do it it's going to take the holy spirit
[1:16:01] himself doing these works here in the
[1:16:04] appearing of the lord a sign of his
[1:16:06] coming that's that's what that's what
[1:16:09] the bible says the things that those
[1:16:11] saints have all long to look into have
[1:16:14] been given to us right now
[1:16:20] they long to look at what they long for
[1:16:22] to see angels long to look at these
[1:16:25] things and here we have it right
[1:16:28] revealed and given to us
[1:16:33] so here we are
[1:16:35] in the appearing of the lord
[1:16:37] in the coming of the lord appearing a
[1:16:39] sign of his coming in other words is it
[1:16:42] yes yes he has appeared he has appeared
[1:16:45] is not in some you know mythical space
[1:16:48] somewhere he's up here we see him coming
[1:16:51] we see him coming
[1:16:52] before he comes come the trump of god
[1:16:56] too late for anything to happen in terms
[1:16:59] of repentance and all that when he comes
[1:17:01] so the appearing he appears
[1:17:04] in the shout in the voice
[1:17:07] hallelujah
[1:17:10] so malachi 4 william branham
[1:17:13] was sent here by god
[1:17:15] to do the appearing of the lord
[1:17:19] the voice
[1:17:21] of the archangel that do the appearing
[1:17:23] of the lord
[1:17:26] how so that you take notice
[1:17:28] this is jesus coming this is jesus
[1:17:31] christ
[1:17:33] and that prophet of malachi 4
[1:17:37] he had a ministry that totally
[1:17:40] identified
[1:17:42] totally reflected and identified that
[1:17:45] the lord is coming
[1:17:47] the lord appeared
[1:17:48] in his ministry
[1:17:51] by diverse signs and wonders and
[1:17:53] miracles
[1:17:54] and we had to take note
[1:17:56] that this was jesus appearing
[1:17:59] and doing his wonders among us
[1:18:02] and
[1:18:04] while the prophet
[1:18:06] did the appearing of the lord
[1:18:08] he gave her the message
[1:18:10] a message of the seven seals and the
[1:18:12] seven funders to call out and prepare a
[1:18:15] bride
[1:18:17] for the coming of the lord
[1:18:20] he's coming that's in the trump
[1:18:22] but before the time he appears
[1:18:25] to call out a bride and prepare her
[1:18:28] for the coming of the lord so that when
[1:18:29] the lord comes there'll be a bride ready
[1:18:32] to meet him
[1:18:33] surely i come quickly even so come lord
[1:18:36] jesus
[1:18:38] but he sends a prophet for us in the
[1:18:41] appearing part of the coming of the lord
[1:18:44] to prepare a bride
[1:18:46] call out and prepare your bride
[1:18:49] for the coming of the lord so that when
[1:18:50] the lord comes there's a bride ready
[1:18:52] when the son of man cometh shall he find
[1:18:55] faith on the earth yes lord because the
[1:18:57] prophet has come with a message of the
[1:18:59] seven seals and the seven thunderers to
[1:19:01] call out a bride and put the word of god
[1:19:05] in her
[1:19:06] amen to prepare her
[1:19:08] for the coming of the lord
[1:19:11] and here we are
[1:19:13] a portion of that group
[1:19:16] now
[1:19:17] revelation 10
[1:19:19] speaks about the coming of the lord
[1:19:23] in revelation 10 7
[1:19:25] the prophet was there in the days of the
[1:19:27] voice of the seventh angel when it shall
[1:19:29] begin a sound the mystery of god should
[1:19:31] be finished
[1:19:33] and they there you have it
[1:19:35] malacca for his ministry to unveil every
[1:19:39] mystery
[1:19:40] the greater mysteries the lesser
[1:19:42] mysteries
[1:19:44] unveil them and the mysteries of the
[1:19:46] seven churches the mystery of the son of
[1:19:48] god in the seven churches unveil and
[1:19:50] reveal them to you and i
[1:19:52] the mystery of the coming of the lord
[1:19:54] unveiled them to you and i
[1:19:57] and after he finished his ministry
[1:19:59] after i finished the ministry he was
[1:20:01] gone
[1:20:03] he was gone
[1:20:05] and then
[1:20:06] revelation 10 8
[1:20:08] the lord is still standing because he
[1:20:10] said jesus does all three of them you
[1:20:12] know the quote in the rapture
[1:20:15] jesus three things must happen before
[1:20:18] the lord himself comes
[1:20:20] shout voice trump shout a message
[1:20:23] together people together
[1:20:25] voice
[1:20:26] a voice of the resurrection to wake up
[1:20:28] the sleeping dead
[1:20:30] and
[1:20:32] the trump of god
[1:20:35] the trump always a trumpet called israel
[1:20:37] to the fist a trumpet to call the bride
[1:20:41] to the lamb supper in the skies those
[1:20:44] three things must take place for the
[1:20:46] lord to
[1:20:47] come
[1:20:48] and so
[1:20:49] malachi 4
[1:20:52] gave her the short message left on books
[1:20:54] and tips and he was gone
[1:20:55] and then the lord himself is still there
[1:20:58] jesus does all three simply means jesus
[1:21:00] doesn't shout does the voice does it
[1:21:02] trump and the shout will change to the
[1:21:05] voice the voice will change the trump
[1:21:07] because jesus is one single person he
[1:21:10] just changed the times and the seasons
[1:21:11] and he moves from the shout to the voice
[1:21:13] to the trump
[1:21:15] i left a revolution for us in there
[1:21:17] hallelujah
[1:21:19] so after the prophet is gone here is
[1:21:23] uh uh the bride
[1:21:25] january the prophet went december 1965
[1:21:29] january 1966 we walked into the shout
[1:21:33] the sharpness the shot of the king is in
[1:21:35] the camp we're walking to the shout
[1:21:37] because he had faithfully given out the
[1:21:39] short message
[1:21:41] which was all of these revelations
[1:21:43] contained in the revelation of jesus
[1:21:45] christ
[1:21:47] all the mysteries
[1:21:48] lit
[1:21:50] ladies in the seven church ages and the
[1:21:53] seven seals and the mysteries concerning
[1:21:56] the end of the world
[1:21:57] unveil them to us
[1:21:59] what the disciples wanted to know we
[1:22:00] have been privileged to have them unveil
[1:22:03] to us right straight from the man of god
[1:22:04] to jesus christ to the prophet to john
[1:22:07] the bride
[1:22:11] on january 96 the bride walked into the
[1:22:13] shout out message
[1:22:14] and god began to call out
[1:22:16] a five-fold ministry from around the
[1:22:19] world not one certain man around the
[1:22:21] world god began to call them out many of
[1:22:24] us weren't even born then
[1:22:26] what would have happened if he came
[1:22:28] when the disciples were asking him
[1:22:30] no he couldn't do it because he had to
[1:22:32] wait for because we were predestinated
[1:22:34] on the lamb's book of life and had to
[1:22:36] wait until the end here to where the
[1:22:40] prophet can put it all together go into
[1:22:43] the man of god and title together for us
[1:22:45] the revelation of jesus christ to let us
[1:22:47] see what has been going on
[1:22:50] what is what was and what is to come
[1:22:53] things which must shortly
[1:22:55] come to pass things that are to be
[1:22:59] and so
[1:23:02] here we are
[1:23:06] a ministry began to call out the bread
[1:23:07] began to take that prophet's message
[1:23:10] the shackles began to preach it recycled
[1:23:13] it back immediately began to enter into
[1:23:15] malacca for his labors his tears his
[1:23:18] labors the word that he preached nothing
[1:23:21] added nothing taken away from it
[1:23:23] rapturing grace faith less on the tapes
[1:23:27] give it
[1:23:28] exactly like he said it
[1:23:30] and and pushing that word out
[1:23:32] began to look for the bride and the bra
[1:23:34] began to come who were not even born
[1:23:36] when malachi 4 was here a ministry after
[1:23:39] the prophet began to around the world
[1:23:43] began to go out with the prophet's
[1:23:45] message faithful men who have been
[1:23:47] taught who know the importance of saying
[1:23:50] only what the messenger said because
[1:23:51] that's the man of god that's the
[1:23:53] revelation of jesus christ and in doing
[1:23:56] that and saying that they are preaching
[1:23:58] and finding that bride
[1:24:01] going into that brat with a shout
[1:24:03] message of malachi 4 and in doing that
[1:24:06] putting jesus christ
[1:24:08] the revealed word from malachi first
[1:24:10] message into that bride
[1:24:14] into that bride
[1:24:16] and as that what goes in that bride
[1:24:18] is jesus christ coming in
[1:24:21] is the coming of the lord come in of the
[1:24:24] lord jesus christ going into that breath
[1:24:26] coming into that bride as this men
[1:24:28] faithfully taught
[1:24:32] swept across the world god began to call
[1:24:35] his ministry here and there and they
[1:24:38] take that prophet's message to go search
[1:24:40] out for the bride to go search for the
[1:24:42] bride from denominations wine or
[1:24:45] prostitution drunken
[1:24:47] bars wherever you were if you were
[1:24:49] predestinated that what found you
[1:24:52] somewhere and here you are today
[1:24:54] a ministry took that what and somebody
[1:24:57] might have given you a book booklet or
[1:24:58] whatever but god was searching for you
[1:25:01] and here you are today and without
[1:25:04] warning you that was jesus christ coming
[1:25:07] into you with his word
[1:25:12] let me read you a quote here
[1:25:16] brother branham said
[1:25:19] um
[1:25:25] excuse me
[1:25:26] on god's provided please worship
[1:25:29] then notice
[1:25:30] not only does he come in by the holy
[1:25:33] spirit
[1:25:34] with the learning of his word
[1:25:37] he
[1:25:38] manifests that word
[1:25:41] malacath was gone
[1:25:43] the appearing part he's gone here we are
[1:25:46] because
[1:25:47] he's gone with a shout here we are the
[1:25:50] appearing part because until the trump
[1:25:52] of god comes we're still in the
[1:25:54] appearing part
[1:25:57] and here we are malachi for sure is the
[1:25:59] example how the appearing is is a
[1:26:02] mystery in mechanics and dynamics
[1:26:04] together the fullness of the world with
[1:26:07] the fullness of a spirit on it a
[1:26:10] manifestation an explosion that would
[1:26:13] literally be the life and mystery of
[1:26:15] jesus christ in human flesh on the face
[1:26:18] of the earth
[1:26:19] each man in his ministry each man is
[1:26:21] placed
[1:26:23] demonstrating and revealing
[1:26:26] the appearing of the lord before their
[1:26:29] generation
[1:26:31] hallelujah
[1:26:33] so he said here
[1:26:36] notice
[1:26:37] these men coming in to you and teaching
[1:26:41] you setting you in church
[1:26:43] you come in the message you send the
[1:26:45] church for tutoring for child training
[1:26:47] for behavior for character formation
[1:26:50] amen to take the word of god to correct
[1:26:54] yourself to to to to reset the purpose
[1:26:57] of the mysteries to take the word and
[1:26:59] correct ourselves and and and correct
[1:27:02] ourselves for behavior for character for
[1:27:05] maturity that jesus christ coming in is
[1:27:09] the come in of the lord
[1:27:12] coming into you with this fullness of
[1:27:14] the word from malachi 4
[1:27:16] and if he comes in with what you are
[1:27:20] learning jesus christ jesus cried out
[1:27:22] say matthew 11 28
[1:27:24] come and land of me
[1:27:26] for a make and lull in heart
[1:27:29] and you shall find rest unto your souls
[1:27:31] so he comes in first by the learning
[1:27:34] of his word and malachi 4 told us here
[1:27:38] he not only comes in with the laying of
[1:27:40] his word he manifests that word so every
[1:27:44] single promise every single
[1:27:47] uh uh promise that has been preached
[1:27:49] into you from elijah's message must be
[1:27:52] manifested and that will also be the
[1:27:55] appearing of the lord
[1:27:58] so we got a job we got a job to do
[1:28:01] and we are doing the job
[1:28:03] so it's not just to believe the world
[1:28:06] there's the promise of dynamics
[1:28:09] that's gonna
[1:28:10] fire up the what on the inside of us
[1:28:13] that we are receiving from elijah's
[1:28:14] message and that's going to be a
[1:28:16] manifestation of this world and the
[1:28:18] spirit together the mechanics and
[1:28:20] dynamics together and that will be a
[1:28:22] manifestation of the life of jesus
[1:28:24] christ and we have that ministry coming
[1:28:26] that's going to be exactly like the life
[1:28:29] of jesus christ
[1:28:30] oh glory to god amen
[1:28:34] amen amen amen
[1:28:36] oh my
[1:28:38] and one by one
[1:28:41] the dynamics is going to fall upon this
[1:28:44] bride one by one
[1:28:47] right now
[1:28:49] the ministry
[1:28:50] going with the world and and calling out
[1:28:54] a bride going with the world and
[1:28:56] nurturing tutoring feeding
[1:29:00] your souls on the word of the living god
[1:29:02] and that's how jesus comes in you are
[1:29:04] facing on the world
[1:29:07] go to the angel you recognize the angel
[1:29:09] is still on the other jesus christ he
[1:29:11] was veiled in malachi 4 that's jesus
[1:29:13] christ using man
[1:29:15] to call you out and go to the india
[1:29:18] you're not going to man you are going to
[1:29:19] jesus christ with the world from malacca
[1:29:23] for not any man's works not tainted not
[1:29:26] added anything to it anything from but
[1:29:28] the what pure was america for and you
[1:29:30] take that word and eat it
[1:29:34] and as you eat that world is coming in
[1:29:37] with the learning of his world but when
[1:29:39] he comes in learning of his world
[1:29:41] that's not all he has got to manifest
[1:29:44] that was that's going to be a
[1:29:45] manifestation so that it will be
[1:29:46] mechanics and dynamics together and
[1:29:49] mechanics and director will be word plus
[1:29:51] spirit and that will be the total
[1:29:54] complete reflection of jesus christ and
[1:29:56] that will be
[1:29:57] appearing
[1:29:59] the lord appearing in you he appeared in
[1:30:01] malacca for he's appearing in his bride
[1:30:04] a sign of his coming
[1:30:06] hallelujah
[1:30:08] glory to god amen and many many men
[1:30:13] and
[1:30:14] one by one
[1:30:16] the dynamics will strike
[1:30:19] and one by one
[1:30:22] jesus christ
[1:30:24] in the bride
[1:30:26] with his word in the bride which is his
[1:30:28] voice in the bride because the prophet
[1:30:30] said the voice of god will be in her
[1:30:33] and she will be anointed by the holy
[1:30:37] spirit the word of god the voiced word
[1:30:40] of god in her soul will be anointed and
[1:30:43] out of that world will block will
[1:30:46] explode every promise that world will
[1:30:48] expand and explode back in the spirit
[1:30:51] and you are going to see
[1:30:53] sons of god in manifestation
[1:30:56] the appearing of the lord god jesus
[1:30:59] christ appearing
[1:31:01] in his sons and daughters
[1:31:03] a sign of his coming they appearing a
[1:31:06] sign of his coming so one of those
[1:31:08] disciples asked jesus in matthew 24 they
[1:31:10] were longing to look at this day
[1:31:13] to be under this promise that the
[1:31:16] appearing of the lord will be the sign
[1:31:18] of his covenant was a sign
[1:31:20] a sign a ministry a people with jesus
[1:31:24] christ veil right on the inside of them
[1:31:26] is what fooling them the word anointed
[1:31:29] by the dynamics the holy spirit and that
[1:31:31] what will be and not into their flesh
[1:31:33] they become the word made flesh demons
[1:31:35] will scream in their presence
[1:31:37] all around them there will be the glory
[1:31:38] of god demons screaming that presence
[1:31:41] glory
[1:31:43] and you'll see jesus christ again
[1:31:45] in his people in his church in his bride
[1:31:49] the appearing of the lord before he
[1:31:52] comes and one by one
[1:31:54] god's sons and daughters
[1:31:57] will come to this
[1:31:59] manifestation which is adoption time
[1:32:04] and jesus christ will be in them
[1:32:06] and add three more words to them
[1:32:09] hear ye him
[1:32:11] the water god in them becomes the voice
[1:32:15] of god on their lips to speak three more
[1:32:18] words
[1:32:22] let me read you a quote here from
[1:32:23] brother branham
[1:32:26] about this process the word of god
[1:32:29] coming into the bride
[1:32:31] from the lorries and church age
[1:32:32] the grammarized book
[1:32:34] a momentary conservation of church
[1:32:36] history
[1:32:37] will prove how accurate this thought is
[1:32:40] in the dark ages the word was almost
[1:32:42] entirely lost to the people
[1:32:44] but god sent luther with the word
[1:32:48] are you hearing me
[1:32:50] the lutheran spoke for god at that
[1:32:52] time saint luther was what ruler
[1:32:54] preached the word the word came into
[1:32:56] them they spoke for god the water got in
[1:32:59] their souls became the voice of god on
[1:33:01] their lips
[1:33:05] the literal spoke for god at the time
[1:33:08] but they organized and again the pure
[1:33:11] word was lost for organization tends
[1:33:14] toward dogma and crete and not simple
[1:33:17] word
[1:33:19] they could no longer speak for god
[1:33:22] because they injected their own thoughts
[1:33:24] and their ideas organization
[1:33:26] and that word that they received had
[1:33:28] become tempted so their voice could no
[1:33:30] longer be the voice of god
[1:33:34] they could no longer speak for god
[1:33:36] then god sent wesley and he was the
[1:33:38] voice with the lord in his day
[1:33:42] so when you have the word for your day
[1:33:44] you become the force of god
[1:33:46] when the dynamic strikes you and it's
[1:33:48] pure world comes out pure voice of god
[1:33:54] and in this edge here dynamic extracts
[1:33:56] the fullness of the water that we are
[1:33:58] received from elijah
[1:34:00] the fullness of the spirit which is
[1:34:02] dynamic strikes it and it comes out of
[1:34:04] our mouth the voice of god three more
[1:34:08] words here
[1:34:09] ye
[1:34:10] him
[1:34:14] then god sent wesley and he was the
[1:34:15] voice of the word in his day the people
[1:34:18] who took his revelation from god became
[1:34:20] the living epistles ran and mourned of
[1:34:22] all men for their generation they became
[1:34:25] the world made flesh and when they spoke
[1:34:28] it was the word speaking
[1:34:31] when the method is filled god raised up
[1:34:33] others
[1:34:34] and so it has gone on through the years
[1:34:37] until in this last day
[1:34:40] there is again another people in the
[1:34:42] land
[1:34:43] who under the messenger that's us on the
[1:34:46] malacca four because he had preached
[1:34:48] this world and
[1:34:50] it it was faithful pricked the world and
[1:34:53] and a father mission ordained of god
[1:34:57] around the world took the same words
[1:34:59] from the prophet
[1:35:00] and circled it recycle it back to you
[1:35:02] and i to call us out to
[1:35:05] to teach us in church to to to correct
[1:35:08] us to train us to rebuke us to to just
[1:35:11] dress us in the wedding comment of the
[1:35:13] lord jesus christ is pure and
[1:35:15] adulterated world the fullness of the
[1:35:17] world through seven church ages
[1:35:19] and then
[1:35:23] until in this last day there is again
[1:35:25] another people in the land who under
[1:35:28] their messenger will be the final voice
[1:35:31] to the final age because the word of god
[1:35:33] you receive when the anointing strikes
[1:35:36] you the dynamics for your day and age
[1:35:38] strikes you that what in your soul
[1:35:41] becomes the voice of god on your lips
[1:35:45] yes sir
[1:35:47] the church is no longer the mouthpiece
[1:35:49] of god
[1:35:51] so the word you receive it and then you
[1:35:52] speak it you are the mappings of god but
[1:35:55] because the church are so backsliding
[1:35:58] and you and i know that
[1:36:00] the church is no longer the mouthpiece
[1:36:01] of god
[1:36:03] it is it's all it's it's it's it is its
[1:36:05] own mouthpiece
[1:36:07] so
[1:36:08] god is turning on her in other words god
[1:36:10] is against her
[1:36:12] he will confront her through the prophet
[1:36:16] and the bride
[1:36:17] for the voice of god
[1:36:19] will be in the bride
[1:36:23] through the prophet malachi 4 and the
[1:36:25] bride he has confronted them to the
[1:36:27] prophet malaca for nice bright time to
[1:36:30] confound the people
[1:36:33] through the bride
[1:36:35] because just like he
[1:36:36] was a son of the coming of the lord so
[1:36:39] he's this bride a son of the coming of
[1:36:42] lord how by a mystery that's just
[1:36:44] exactly like the life of jesus christ in
[1:36:46] mechanics and dynamics together
[1:36:51] the prophet
[1:36:52] and the bride for the voice of god will
[1:36:54] be in her
[1:36:56] the what a god in her soul anointed by
[1:36:58] the spirit
[1:36:59] becomes the voice of god on her lips
[1:37:02] to do
[1:37:03] spock in what power
[1:37:05] the the the the the what and the spirit
[1:37:08] going for together
[1:37:09] a spoken word power the fullness of the
[1:37:12] anointing and authority in the church of
[1:37:13] the living god that's our promise
[1:37:16] that's our promise
[1:37:18] now we pray for the sick but then we are
[1:37:20] going to speak the word and command the
[1:37:22] demons
[1:37:23] we are not going to pray for this we are
[1:37:24] going to speak the word
[1:37:26] and command the demons because he is
[1:37:29] going to give you three more words
[1:37:31] hear him your voice becomes the voice of
[1:37:33] god
[1:37:34] yes sir
[1:37:36] the church is no longer the mouth of god
[1:37:38] the my peace of god is his own
[1:37:39] mouthpiece so god is turning on her he
[1:37:42] will confront her through the prophet
[1:37:44] and the bride for the voice of god will
[1:37:46] be in her yes it is for his sick
[1:37:50] excuse me yes it is the voice of god is
[1:37:52] in her
[1:37:53] yes it is for he says in the last
[1:37:55] chapter of revelation verse 17
[1:37:57] the spirit
[1:37:58] and the bride say
[1:38:00] come the spirit will anoint the bride
[1:38:04] the ward in her soul and out of her lips
[1:38:07] will come the voice of god
[1:38:10] so the voice of god is in the bride
[1:38:13] amen the word of god in the bread is the
[1:38:16] voice of god
[1:38:20] yes
[1:38:21] once more
[1:38:23] the wall will hear direct from god
[1:38:26] as at pentecost but of course that what
[1:38:29] bro will be reputated as in the first
[1:38:31] age oh god still has a voice for the
[1:38:35] people of the world even as he has given
[1:38:37] a voice to the bride
[1:38:40] these voices in the bride
[1:38:42] it come from elijah's world because
[1:38:44] jesus does all three the water god in
[1:38:46] your soul is the voice of god in your
[1:38:49] soul
[1:38:50] and it's the appearing part
[1:38:52] of the coming of the lord
[1:38:55] that voice is in the bride as we have
[1:38:58] said
[1:38:59] i will talk more about that later
[1:39:02] and we are talking more about that
[1:39:04] today
[1:39:05] thank you jesus
[1:39:08] and when the last name on the book last
[1:39:12] name previous name in this edge here
[1:39:14] as you said the dynamics
[1:39:16] to our mechanics
[1:39:19] then the voice of god in the bride
[1:39:23] jesus will be in that bride speaking his
[1:39:26] words
[1:39:28] and then
[1:39:30] it will come right back to
[1:39:32] like it was in saint john 11 again when
[1:39:34] lazarus died
[1:39:36] and jesus
[1:39:39] was told him your friend lazarus is dead
[1:39:42] i didn't go
[1:39:43] four days passed before he went there
[1:39:46] but while he was going his apples were
[1:39:48] saying he said our friend lazarus sleeps
[1:39:52] let us go and wake him up
[1:39:56] that's the voice of god to wake up
[1:39:59] and he went down his disciples
[1:40:01] with his disciples he wanted to wake him
[1:40:03] up and in this day and age here jesus
[1:40:05] will be in these disciples this end time
[1:40:08] bride anointed
[1:40:12] adopted
[1:40:15] the what may flesh jesus in this bride
[1:40:17] will speak the word and up will come
[1:40:20] lazarus again from the grave
[1:40:22] up they'll come from the grave
[1:40:25] all the saints of old
[1:40:28] the voice of god in the bride
[1:40:31] a voice of the resurrection
[1:40:33] to wake
[1:40:34] up the sleeping saints
[1:40:38] the same way
[1:40:40] jesus
[1:40:42] the second adam
[1:40:43] the first adam
[1:40:46] was to call
[1:40:48] them from the ground from the from the
[1:40:51] dust of the earth but before he got to
[1:40:52] his ministry
[1:40:54] he fell by sin but this second adam
[1:40:56] jesus christ did not fail
[1:40:59] and he in his bride or this end time
[1:41:02] here will be there to speak
[1:41:05] his voice a voice of the resurrection to
[1:41:08] raise up
[1:41:09] the dead in christ from the graves
[1:41:12] and that's gonna be how is it gonna be
[1:41:15] the power of god
[1:41:17] striking the glories of god striking the
[1:41:21] bride
[1:41:22] wave after wave after wave after wave
[1:41:26] of the power of god will sweep over your
[1:41:28] soul
[1:41:29] and up from the grave they'll come that
[1:41:31] power will be so great
[1:41:33] the graves will not be able to stay
[1:41:35] closed up they'll come from there like
[1:41:37] brother branham said when jesus was at
[1:41:39] the grave of lazarus if he not called
[1:41:41] lazarus all the graves would have opened
[1:41:43] but right now that voice will call out
[1:41:47] and up they'll come
[1:41:50] a voice
[1:41:52] of the resurrection
[1:41:54] oh hallelujah
[1:41:56] the voice in the living bride
[1:42:00] wakes up
[1:42:01] the sleeping
[1:42:03] dead bride
[1:42:05] by his voice
[1:42:07] a voice
[1:42:08] of the resurrection how
[1:42:10] wave after wave after wave after wave of
[1:42:13] the glories of god till the graves
[1:42:15] cannot stay closed and up they will come
[1:42:19] what the first adam failed to do
[1:42:21] the second adam filled in his bride
[1:42:23] by the fullness of the spirit upon the
[1:42:26] fullness of the world

[1:45:34] amen
[1:45:37] now
[1:45:40] jesus he does all three the shout
[1:45:43] becoming the voice the voice becoming
[1:45:46] the trump
[1:45:48] the voice becomes the trump a voice of
[1:45:51] the resurrection because the bible says
[1:45:53] at the last trump
[1:45:55] the dead in christ shall rise and but
[1:45:56] brother braham said the voice of the
[1:45:58] archangel raised up the dead in christ
[1:46:00] so you know right away there's a
[1:46:01] revelation there oh but the boundary
[1:46:03] found saying something different from
[1:46:04] the bible
[1:46:06] that the voice of the archangel raised
[1:46:08] up the dead and the bible says the trump
[1:46:11] of god amber by himself quoted that but
[1:46:13] many times the trump of god that's when
[1:46:15] the dead in christ will rise up so you
[1:46:17] know right away there's a revelation
[1:46:18] there
[1:46:19] how they how the trump and the voice and
[1:46:22] the shout how they are
[1:46:25] you know connected together because
[1:46:27] jesus he does all three the shout
[1:46:29] becomes the voice the voice becomes the
[1:46:31] trump
[1:46:32] and when the last name on the book is
[1:46:35] adopted the voice of god in heaven the
[1:46:37] word of god
[1:46:39] jesus veils in her like a one with his
[1:46:41] apples to the grave of lazarus he goes
[1:46:44] with his disciples to every grave around
[1:46:46] the world where his seed his sons and
[1:46:49] daughters all the way back to adam ah
[1:46:51] and the voice of god jesus christ in
[1:46:54] them by his voice this trumpeting voice
[1:46:58] a voice of the resurrection will wake up
[1:47:01] the dead in christ
[1:47:03] and for about 30 40 days
[1:47:06] there'll be a rendezvous
[1:47:08] on this side here before we go in the
[1:47:10] rapture in the skies
[1:47:12] now
[1:47:14] we're moving to malaca
[1:47:17] explaining when when shall these things
[1:47:19] be
[1:47:20] and on the sign of thy coming
[1:47:22] we have seen the sign the appearing a
[1:47:25] sign of his coming we have seen the sign
[1:47:27] of the resurrected saints is saying that
[1:47:29] the rapture is at hand
[1:47:32] now
[1:47:34] says shout voice trump
[1:47:36] now
[1:47:39] let me read you this here from broken
[1:47:41] systems
[1:47:42] 6407 26
[1:47:45] praying that god will richly bless each
[1:47:47] of you program 158 that is grace and
[1:47:50] mercy will be with you through the
[1:47:52] coming week
[1:47:53] and if anything should happen that one
[1:47:55] of you may sleep beyond the veil now
[1:47:57] just remember there's only a few hours
[1:47:59] of sleep
[1:48:01] and rest until we meet
[1:48:03] remember that
[1:48:04] they which are alive and remain shall
[1:48:06] not hinder those which are sleeping
[1:48:09] for the trumpet of god shall sound
[1:48:12] thus first thessalonians 4 16
[1:48:15] that last trumpet thus first corinthians
[1:48:19] 15 51 and 52
[1:48:23] and then he ties it to the seventh
[1:48:25] trumpet that last trumpet
[1:48:27] for the sixth one has just sounded
[1:48:29] hitland-ikeman
[1:48:31] in other words he's talking about the
[1:48:33] trump of god he's talking about the last
[1:48:35] trumpet he's talking about the seventh
[1:48:37] trumpet all the trump same thing but
[1:48:40] they have different portions of what
[1:48:42] they are going to do malacca revealed
[1:48:44] these things to bring us on into the
[1:48:47] rapture and
[1:48:49] and and to the end of the world
[1:48:53] to bring on the tribulation period
[1:48:56] so
[1:49:00] and the sixth one i just sounded and
[1:49:02] that last trumpet like the last seal
[1:49:05] will be the coming of the lord it shall
[1:49:07] sound and the dead in christ shall rise
[1:49:09] first just resting till that time
[1:49:13] in other words
[1:49:14] this trump of god is the same as the
[1:49:16] last trumpet is same as the seventh
[1:49:18] trumpet
[1:49:20] malacca for let us understand what each
[1:49:23] portion of that trumpet will do same
[1:49:25] trumpet but directed to do different
[1:49:28] things
[1:49:30] the trump of god
[1:49:31] that's when a voice of the resurrection
[1:49:34] works of the dead in christ
[1:49:36] and they're still here
[1:49:38] they're still here for 30 40 days
[1:49:40] and then the trumpet sounds we're going
[1:49:42] to rupture in the skies that's the last
[1:49:45] trump
[1:49:46] for the last trump we shall be changed
[1:49:49] in a moment in a twin of an eye we're
[1:49:51] going the rapture in the skies
[1:49:55] and then the seventh trumpet
[1:49:57] will be
[1:49:59] moist and elijah jesus christ coming to
[1:50:01] morris and elijah the gospel passing
[1:50:04] from the gentiles back to the jews just
[1:50:06] the reverse of where the gospel passed
[1:50:08] from the jews to the gentiles in the
[1:50:11] house of cornelius same way the gospel
[1:50:13] same message seven seals seven thunders

[1:50:52] field called the bloods of the air to a
[1:50:54] feast
[1:50:56] on the face of the earth while the bride
