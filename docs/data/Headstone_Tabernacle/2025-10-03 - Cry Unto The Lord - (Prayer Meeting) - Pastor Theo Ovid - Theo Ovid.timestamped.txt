[0:00] God bless you all tonight. Amen. We want
[0:03] to
[0:04] uh welcome everyone in the precious name
[0:06] of Jesus Christ. And amen. We thank God
[0:09] for his presence tonight. Let's just bow
[0:11] our heads as we want to start in a word
[0:13] of prayer. We want to enter into his
[0:16] presence tonight. Let's close our eyes
[0:17] and worship him and pray together as we
[0:20] welcome the Holy Spirit. Almighty God,
[0:23] we thank you for your grace towards our
[0:26] lives. Where would we be without you
[0:28] tonight, Lord? We are humbled by you,
[0:32] Father. Hallowed be thy name tonight.
[0:35] Lord, we pray your presence would come
[0:36] in a special way. And may we anoint each
[0:38] heart and life here tonight as
[0:39] represented, Lord, in this virtual
[0:42] setting. Pray that each one, Father, as
[0:45] they would find their corner,
[0:47] Lord, may you anoint them, inspire them
[0:49] there in that secret place tonight. We
[0:52] want to hide ourselves in the cliff of
[0:53] the rock tonight. To hide ourselves in
[0:56] your presence, Lord. In your presence
[0:58] where there's strength and joy and
[1:00] peace, Lord. Where there's revival every
[1:03] weary soul. Tonight, we pray come in a
[1:06] mighty way and bless the time of prayer.
[1:07] Bless the time of worship. Bless the
[1:10] time of the word being shared with us,
[1:11] Lord, as your servant as you would yield
[1:13] himself to be used of you to speak
[1:15] something to us tonight that we could
[1:17] grasp tonight, Lord, in faith and
[1:20] believing and use it tonight, Lord, as a
[1:23] weapon against the enemy and use it to
[1:26] access, Lord, all of the promises that
[1:28] you have in store for us, Lord. We
[1:31] commit this time of prayer into your
[1:32] hands. We thank you for it, the
[1:33] privilege to come to you in prayer. We
[1:35] pray you bless it especially tonight in
[1:38] Jesus Christ's precious name we pray and
[1:40] ask it. Amen and amen. Praise God. Why
[1:43] don't you just give him glory tonight?
[1:45] Just give him praise. Thank you Jesus.
[1:48] Thank you father. Glory to God.
[1:49] Hallelujah.
[1:51] Thank you Jesus. Thank you father. Glory
[1:54] to God.

[11:06] Oh,

[11:14] Oh, your presence. In your presence,
[11:21] oh that's right.
[11:25] Your presence.
[11:30] Oh my God.

[11:39] That's where I
[11:42] wor seeking your face
[11:47] and trudging your grace
[11:51] [Music]
[11:53] in the cl of the round
[11:56] [Music]
[12:01] in your presence. Oh God.
[12:07] Amen. Amen. Thank you for Anthony and
[12:10] God bless you church. We are grateful
[12:12] for each one of you here tonight. Let us
[12:14] bow our heads for a word of prayer.
[12:16] Heavenly Father, we thank you for this
[12:18] great privilege that we have that we
[12:20] could call upon your name in such a time
[12:23] as this. Lord, you knew that we would be
[12:26] in this digital age. You knew you'll be
[12:28] be the age of this connectivity and this
[12:31] internet and this church without walls
[12:36] breaking all barriers and boundaries. I
[12:39] could see how the prophecy could come
[12:42] forth. The Holy Spirit will go across
[12:43] the world overnight.
[12:46] There is nothing. There's no barrier.
[12:49] There's no hindrance. And tonight
[12:51] there's no hindrance to your spirit, to
[12:53] the faith, to whatever you want done, to
[12:57] impossibilities, what we call
[12:58] impossibilities become impossible.
[13:01] Father, may you come and work among us
[13:02] tonight. Work in every home, work in
[13:04] every heart, work in every life. And as
[13:07] we approach your word, may you bless it
[13:08] in Jesus name I ask it. Amen and amen.
[13:11] God bless you and welcome. I believe is
[13:14] in Matthew 17 verse 11 Jesus said Elias
[13:20] truly shall first come and restore all
[13:22] things. And he was talking about that
[13:24] Elijah spirit present future. Elias
[13:28] truly shall first come and restore all
[13:31] things. So William Brandon, brother
[13:33] Brandham, he came with that restoration
[13:36] anointing. That anointing to restore the
[13:39] hearts of return back to the feet of the
[13:41] fathers is an anointing to restore. And
[13:46] that is why we hit that scripture on
[13:48] Wednesday night where God said, "I will
[13:51] restore all the years that the locust
[13:54] and the caterpillar paw had eaten." Now
[13:56] the backdrop of that scripture is what
[13:59] we will read tonight from Joel chapter
[14:00] one.
[14:02] And in in this Joel chapter 1, God is
[14:04] talking about the wine is beheld,
[14:07] the corn, the field is is wasted. And we
[14:11] want to read from verse 10 to 14 of Joel
[14:13] chapter 1. If you have your Bibles and
[14:16] we're going to read Psalms 142 and see
[14:19] what the Lord will do from there. The
[14:21] title of tonight is cry unto the Lord.
[14:23] That's from the scripture itself we
[14:24] about to read. Joel chapter 1, reading
[14:27] from verse 10. God speaks. This is
[14:30] through the eyes of God. The field is
[14:34] wasted.
[14:35] The land mourneth. For the corn is
[14:38] wasted. The new wine is dried up. The
[14:41] oil languisheth.
[14:43] Be ashamed. Oh ye husband men. How old
[14:46] eve wine vine dressers for the wheat and
[14:50] for the valley because the harvest of
[14:52] the field perish. The vine is dried up.
[14:56] The fig tree languisheth. The
[14:57] pomegranate tree. The palm tree also the
[15:00] apple tree. Even all the trees of the
[15:02] field are withered.
[15:04] The reason because joy is withered away
[15:09] from the sons of men.
[15:12] Verse 13, he said, "Good yourselves and
[15:15] lament ye priests. How ye ministers of
[15:19] the altar, come lie all night in
[15:23] sackloord, ye ministers of my God. For
[15:27] the meat offering and the drink offering
[15:30] is withholden from the house of your
[15:32] God.
[15:34] Sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly,
[15:38] gather the elders and all the
[15:41] inhabitants of the land into the house
[15:44] of the Lord your God and cry unto the
[15:48] Lord. That's where I get this title
[15:49] from. And cry unto the Lord. And this is
[15:54] David in Psalms 142.
[15:56] David
[15:58] speaks in verse one. If you want to turn
[16:01] your Bible, say Psalms 142.
[16:03] He said, "I cried unto the Lord with my
[16:05] voice."
[16:07] Note,
[16:09] it's an expression
[16:11] of not you sending a prayer request,
[16:14] not you trying to get people to pray for
[16:16] you, but you with your own voice crying
[16:22] unto God. David was very specific. I
[16:26] cried unto the Lord with my voice.
[16:29] With my voice unto the Lord did I make
[16:32] my supplication.
[16:34] I poured out my complaint before him. I
[16:38] showed before him my trouble.
[16:42] When my spirit was overwhelmed within
[16:45] me,
[16:47] then thou kneest my path. So instead of
[16:50] getting depressed, frustrated, fed up,
[16:53] David is expressing to God his troubles.
[16:58] He is describing how he feel overwhelmed
[17:02] within himself and he is declaring
[17:05] things to God. Thou nearest my part in
[17:08] the way wherein I walked have the
[17:09] privilege laid us near for me. I looked
[17:12] on my right hand and beheld
[17:15] there was no man that would know me.
[17:19] Refuge failed me. No man cared for my
[17:25] soul. And this here paints a picture of
[17:29] somebody's looking for help, looking for
[17:31] a neighbor, looking for a prop, looking
[17:33] for some kind of comfort. And when David
[17:35] look around, he's recognized he's alone.
[17:38] No man cared for my soul. Verse 5, I
[17:42] cried unto thee, O Lord, I said. This is
[17:48] David, thou art my refuge. Look before,
[17:52] refuge failed me. But he said, I said,
[17:55] thou art my refuge and my portion in the
[17:58] land of the living. Attend unto my cry,
[18:02] for I am brought very low. Deliver me
[18:06] from my persecutors, for they are
[18:08] stronger than I. This is a honest
[18:11] confession. This is a very honest
[18:14] prayer. David continues in verse 7,
[18:19] "Bring my soul out of prison that I
[18:23] might praise thy name,
[18:26] not bring my soul out that I can do what
[18:29] I've been doing contrary or slack or
[18:31] whatever." He said, "Bring my soul out
[18:35] of prison that I may praise thy name.
[18:38] The righteous shall compass me about for
[18:42] thou shalt deal bountifully with me.
[18:46] Amen. What a scripture tonight. David
[18:49] crying out unto God. And sometimes it is
[18:53] sad but sometime it take distresses for
[18:56] us to cry out. We could be grunting and
[18:59] groaning but not really talking to God
[19:01] and crying onto God. But Aan prayed this
[19:04] prayer. He said, "God created my
[19:05] revival.
[19:07] Let me be the revival. Let each one of
[19:11] us be the revival. A revival in me. Now,
[19:15] tonight, you're in the right place in
[19:17] your home. You're in the right place to
[19:19] see what you need to do in your home.
[19:21] You don't need to come to church for
[19:23] this because he said no minister could
[19:27] bring a revival. The revival has to
[19:29] start in your home. So, this prayer is
[19:33] applicable to all of us. Let me be the
[19:35] revival. Let each one of us be the
[19:38] revival, the revival in me.
[19:41] Excuse me.
[19:43] Make me, Lord, to hunger. Make me to
[19:46] thirst.
[19:48] Create in me, Lord, that which is needed
[19:50] in me. Let me from this hour on be thine
[19:57] more consecrated servant, a better
[20:00] servant, more blessed of you, more able,
[20:04] more humbler, more kinder, more willing
[20:08] to work, more looking to the things that
[20:11] are positive, getting the things that
[20:13] are past and the negatives. Let me press
[20:18] towards the mark of the high calling of
[20:22] Christ. Amen.
[20:24] Tonight I want to challenge you.
[20:27] Become the change you want to see in
[20:29] others.
[20:31] Wives complain about husbands. Husband
[20:34] complain about wives. Parents complain
[20:37] about children. Children complain about
[20:38] parents. Vice versa. But just think
[20:42] tonight,
[20:44] could you become the change you want to
[20:45] see in others?
[20:47] You want to see your husband humble, but
[20:49] you are proud.
[20:51] You want to see your wife humble, but
[20:53] you are proud.
[20:56] Why not become humble? Just what you
[20:58] want to see, why not live out? You want
[21:01] people to smile with you. Why don't you
[21:04] smile with others? You want people to
[21:07] whatever you want, become that. Look
[21:11] what Paul said to Timothy in 1 Timothy
[21:13] 4:12.
[21:15] Timothy was a young man
[21:18] and you know youth have its pros and
[21:20] cons. And I was sharing with my son
[21:23] Gideon the challenge I had as a young
[21:25] minister dealing with older folks
[21:28] dealing with brethren who's older than
[21:29] me who are gray hair who may know more
[21:32] about me. But I had a calling upon my
[21:34] life and the challenge was how to deal
[21:37] with that how to manage that. But in 1
[21:40] Timothy 4:12,
[21:42] Paul speaking, "Let no man despise thy
[21:45] youth,
[21:47] but here we go. Be thou an example of
[21:51] the believers
[21:52] in word, in conversation,
[21:56] in charity,
[21:58] in spirit,
[22:00] in faith, in purity." So Paul give this
[22:04] young minister, young believer, young
[22:08] brother a view
[22:12] in order that no man despises youth.
[22:14] Somebody could say well young young but
[22:18] no when you become an example you become
[22:22] as we say the change you want to see in
[22:26] others. In other words you set yourself
[22:27] as a standard. Jesus even brought it in
[22:30] a deeper way. In Mark 5:16, he said,
[22:35] "Let your light not just shine,
[22:39] but so shine before men that they may
[22:43] see your good works." So the truth be
[22:46] told, Christians not supposed to have
[22:49] bad works. Christians not supposed to
[22:51] have a bad report.
[22:54] They're not supposed to write up
[22:55] Christians. They're lazy. They're slful.
[22:58] They work sloppy. That ought not to be a
[23:01] Christian testimony. That is not a
[23:02] Christian testimony. Actually, let your
[23:05] light
[23:07] so shine before men. And this is before
[23:11] men. It's not church men. It's not in
[23:12] your home church men. It's not your
[23:14] believers men or brethren men. Before
[23:16] men, all men that they may see what?
[23:20] Your good works and glorify your father
[23:24] which is in heaven. All right.
[23:27] Bring it.
[23:29] &gt;&gt; The cry unto the Lord
[23:31] is a earnest desperate call for help.
[23:36] We find out that when in time of this
[23:39] great distress, we almost we always talk
[23:41] about Ziglag when David uh lost his
[23:45] wives and they got in captivity and the
[23:47] men wanted to stone David and beat up
[23:49] David and David went and cry out unto
[23:51] God and ask God a question. Should I sit
[23:54] here and mope and depress? Should I have
[23:55] a depression party? Should I get
[23:57] everybody to be sympathized with me and
[23:59] say, "Oh, God, we fighting." We say,
[24:00] "Oh, Lord, look what happened." And all
[24:02] the negative talk and you know when you
[24:04] start this negative thing, you attract
[24:06] negative people. You get support in that
[24:08] negativity. David asks a question. The
[24:11] question was, "Should I pursue? Should I
[24:13] go and fight or should I let it just
[24:15] go?" And God told him, "Pursue." Pursue
[24:18] can't mean continual depression cuz
[24:20] pursue can't mean you have no action.
[24:22] Pursue means just that. And David ruled
[24:25] all night through the story and all was
[24:28] restored. So David under that
[24:30] restoration anointing because to me this
[24:32] is what has opened up to us right now in
[24:35] this church in what we are seeing in the
[24:37] vision that God is presenting a
[24:39] restoration anointing is upon coming
[24:41] upon to reconcile people to bring people
[24:44] right back to where they're supposed to
[24:45] be. I'll restore say the Lord. So to cry
[24:48] unto the Lord is a desperate call for
[24:51] help, a call for God's mercy, a call for
[24:55] God's intervention, a call in a time of
[24:58] distress, a urgent call, a call coming
[25:02] from a place of desperation.
[25:05] And it's amazing what the prophet said,
[25:08] you can't get desperate until God speaks
[25:10] to you.
[25:12] soul is getting to be attuned by the
[25:16] spirit to hear the voice of God speaking
[25:18] to you. Brother Brandon almost done when
[25:24] atomic bombs people are scared in the
[25:26] Pentagon. They don't know what to do and
[25:29] mystic signs in the skies are flying
[25:31] sources and everything else. God
[25:32] predicted it time it's time for Elijah
[25:35] to rise on the scene. Then he prophesied
[25:38] this. Let the people
[25:41] Let that little flop, that little
[25:44] remnant that God gave him, talking about
[25:47] Elijah, let that little remnant go to
[25:50] calling out to God. And watch what
[25:52] happens. There'll be a national
[25:53] showdown. There'll be a power that they
[25:57] have never seen before. The trouble of
[25:59] it is this time it's going to be too
[26:02] late for them. Then the doors will be
[26:05] closed. So remember, we are the end
[26:08] time. Pray. Just think about it,
[26:11] friends. If the people of Israel wasn't
[26:14] pressed so hard that they begin to cry
[26:16] unto God, it was a lamentation amongst
[26:18] them that God could say, "I've heard the
[26:21] cries of my people."
[26:24] Listen to this. That first branch
[26:28] that came forth was a Pentecostal branch
[26:31] filled with Pentecostal power. so
[26:35] impacted by the Holy Spirit till they
[26:38] staggered under the impact of the power
[26:40] of God. That remind me when Bang got the
[26:43] vision of the seven angels. He said the
[26:45] power of God pack him in a corner of the
[26:47] room. He was numb for days, not hours,
[26:51] not minutes, for days. He said, "You
[26:55] know the blessings of the Lord, but you
[26:57] don't know the power of God." When the
[27:01] power of God hit John, he fell as one
[27:02] dead. Hit Daniel, fell as one dead. It
[27:05] has an effect. This is not a game. These
[27:08] that who could talk the longest mystery
[27:10] and more mystery. This is a real God
[27:13] encounter. When God hit Moses, Moses had
[27:17] to God had to tell Moses the place to
[27:19] stand in his holy ground. So he says
[27:22] here that they were filled with
[27:24] Pentecostal power. So impacted by the
[27:27] Holy Spirit till they stand under the
[27:29] impact of the power of God. Listen. They
[27:32] went forth and saw visions,
[27:34] performed miracles, opened the eyes of
[27:37] the blind, healed the sick. Joy was in
[27:40] the camp. They prayed in one accord, all
[27:43] of them together until the building
[27:45] shook where they assembled together.
[27:48] Show me a church doing that today. Even
[27:52] the Pentecostal so-cal is getting so
[27:54] dry. They have ceremonial prayer. What
[27:58] we need is a prayer meeting that will
[28:00] shake the shingles off the top of the
[28:02] house and bring God back into the church
[28:04] again. It wasn't so from the beginning.
[28:07] All these creeds and cold formal
[28:09] ritualistics, all these different
[28:10] things, it wasn't so from the beginning.
[28:12] Jesus set up a church and said these
[28:15] signs shall follow them that believe.
[28:18] That was the beginning. That is what
[28:20] happened in the beginning. If he was
[28:22] here on earth today, he would not
[28:25] endorse our creeds and our things that
[28:28] we are doing. He would say it wasn't so
[28:32] from the beginning.
[28:35] Amen. Oh, blessed be the name of the
[28:38] Lord. What we need today
[28:41] is a coming together and a prayer
[28:43] meeting and to stay there until God
[28:48] sends the adoption of the Holy Spirit
[28:53] brings the Holy Ghost down and places in
[28:57] the church apostles, prophets, teachers,
[29:01] evangelists, pastors. Now I know people
[29:04] fight that quote and I know and I'm now
[29:06] getting to realize how much unbelief in
[29:08] this message. He said when a church is
[29:09] believing that the Holy Ghost is just as
[29:11] real
[29:13] and when they are born and positionally
[29:15] born then God sets in the church. It
[29:18] takes the Holy Ghost to set the
[29:21] ministries. Let a man claim whatever you
[29:24] want to claim. I claim to be a teacher.
[29:25] I claim to be evangelist. I claim to be
[29:27] a prophet. I claim to be apostle. Man
[29:29] could talk whatever they talk. It's what
[29:30] God come down and vindicate.
[29:34] But I'll say something.
[29:37] He say that's what we need. That's what
[29:39] the church need. It will stay with the
[29:41] word. No, don't compromise. Don't flirt
[29:43] with the world. A church that will have
[29:45] nothing to do with sin. That will turn
[29:47] its back on sin. That will walk into
[29:49] into the holiness and beauty of God.
[29:50] Living for God. Live or die.
[29:54] About to close here.
[29:56] I'm wondering if we are really tied to
[29:58] the absolute that we claim to or if we
[30:01] are just trusting our church, our
[30:03] affiliation. As the world changes, it
[30:06] changes with that. There's one star that
[30:08] could never change. This word cannot
[30:12] change. His Bible cannot change. And if
[30:15] a man is born of the spirit of God with
[30:17] Christ in him, he punctuates every
[30:19] promise with a amen. He says a prayer
[30:23] meeting is what we need. We must be
[30:25] Christians. A Christian must use this
[30:28] same absolute to ask God. Listen, Jesus
[30:32] said, "If you abide in me, my words
[30:34] abide in you." And then he's talking
[30:36] about to ask for God to work upon the
[30:39] heart of a judge or that parole board
[30:42] and get that lucky fellow out of debt
[30:44] cell. If we have asked with faith
[30:47] believing, he says, "We will get it."
[30:50] and my faith here we go that I have in
[30:53] God I'm speaking that is why I'm here
[30:56] tonight that is why I cancel out
[30:58] something else and got in here I got to
[31:01] drive hundreds of miles tonight back to
[31:04] Tucson Arizona because I come listen to
[31:08] put my faith with yours that's a man
[31:11] it's a soul laying yonder it is someone
[31:14] in need and if we Christians have got to
[31:16] wake up to reality to a genuine faith
[31:19] tie to the word of God. Here it is. And
[31:22] plead that promise. Oh my. If you abide
[31:25] in me and my word abide in you, you can
[31:28] get what you want. He said, but if you
[31:30] can tie your faith, so he's talking some
[31:33] deeper things now.
[31:36] If you can tie your faith into such a
[31:38] place that you know and stay there and
[31:43] pray until God answers back and you know
[31:47] you got it in your heart, something's
[31:49] going to happen.
[31:51] I've seen the dead rays from the funeral
[31:53] home. I've seen the blind eyes come
[31:56] open, deaf ears have stopped. I have
[31:59] seen cancer ridden cases with sacoma
[32:02] cancer, leprosy, healed by the power of
[32:06] almighty God because they had faith to
[32:10] believe that that's God who made the
[32:13] promise would be able to keep his
[32:15] promise. That's real genuine faith like
[32:17] Abraham
[32:19] tie to there. Stay there and pray. Not
[32:22] just get out and say, "God, deliver a
[32:24] little poor fellow and send him home."
[32:26] We all like that. But let's stay there
[32:29] until something happened. When something
[32:32] happened, then that assurance could fall
[32:35] among this little handful of people
[32:37] sitting in this auditorium here tonight
[32:39] and could fall among us right here.
[32:41] Enough faith and power of God. If we
[32:44] could just pray through till we strike
[32:46] that home line, till the absolute comes
[32:48] down, that same pillar father was here
[32:50] in Tucson.
[32:52] Then if you could pray through until
[32:54] they get an answer back, you got the
[32:56] assurance back. The very God, here we
[32:59] go. I'm closing the final quote. The
[33:02] very God that could take a hooknose Jew
[33:06] like Paul angry going down there to put
[33:09] all the Christian to death under capital
[33:11] punishment and could change him and make
[33:14] him to a lovely Christian. That same God
[33:18] lives tonight. Change law to grace.
[33:21] anything he has a notion to do going to
[33:24] call me a holy ruler anyhow so I might
[33:26] as well get started right now then Mark
[33:29] 11:22 if you pray true verily I say unto
[33:31] you have faith in God I say unto you if
[33:34] you say to this mountain be moved when
[33:36] the absolute is come to you then you are
[33:40] anointed with that spirit here we go
[33:42] that comes beyond all scientific control
[33:48] out yonder before there was a atom or
[33:50] molecule the one that spoke it into
[33:52] existence. Say to this mountain, be
[33:55] moved and to doubt in your heart. So
[33:58] what brother Baron has presented to us
[34:00] is that there's a quality of faith that
[34:04] is tied to you my words tonight
[34:06] unlimited power. Oh, give the Lord some
[34:09] praises tonight. There is a quality of
[34:12] faith that is tied to unlimited power
[34:16] that you could see beyond your sickness,
[34:18] beyond your cancer, beyond your disease,
[34:21] beyond whatever ailing your family, you
[34:23] could go beyond that and see that God is
[34:26] God tonight and he is more than able and
[34:29] all things are possible to them that
[34:31] believe. Whether is financial issues,
[34:34] family issues, marital issues, personal
[34:37] issues, all things are possible to them
[34:40] that believe. Let's bow our heads for a
[34:41] word of prayer. Heavenly Father, I thank
[34:43] you tonight, oh God, for this privilege
[34:45] and opportunity that you have given unto
[34:47] us to share these words to your people
[34:50] and may they be inspired with them to
[34:52] cry unto you, Lord. Lord, you don't go
[34:55] around the bush and go around and around
[34:57] in circles. You were very specific. You
[35:00] say, "Gather the elders, call a fast, go
[35:03] call a solemn assembly." Why? Because
[35:06] you we need action. We need to get a
[35:08] result. We need to see something change.
[35:10] We We are needy. We We ask for your
[35:13] intervention. We ask for your mercy. We
[35:15] ask that you come and miraculously and
[35:17] and send on your miracle working power
[35:19] upon the sick and afflicted in our
[35:20] midst. We ask that your virtue will flow
[35:22] out at night. We ask you the power would
[35:24] hit the children, the young people that
[35:26] are at the edge, Lord, and knowing that
[35:28] you have such a powerful influence and
[35:30] is ease in the scripture. In
[35:32] resurrection season, Peter decided to go
[35:34] back fishing. after three and a half
[35:36] years following Messiah that that just
[35:39] because Jesus was not visibly looking at
[35:42] them talking to them among them they
[35:44] decide to go back to what they was in
[35:45] the beginning and this is human this is
[35:48] natural father and Lord I pray that your
[35:50] presence become so real that there'll be
[35:52] no turning back there'll be no going
[35:53] back there'll be no going back fishing
[35:55] father in that context but lord will be
[35:57] a seeking after and a thirst after oh
[36:00] god if it's ever a time to say creating
[36:02] me a thirst creating me a hunger is now
[36:05] because the devil is pelting everything,
[36:07] Lord, to stifle that thirst and to kill
[36:09] that hungering after righteousness. But
[36:11] Lord, you said, "Blessed are they that
[36:13] hunger and thirst after righteousness,
[36:14] for they shall be filled." So we know
[36:16] tonight that those that are hungering
[36:17] here or those that will begin to hunger,
[36:20] Lord, we know there's a blessing upon
[36:21] their lives that they're going to be
[36:23] filled with the Holy Ghost. Oh God, may
[36:25] it start tonight. If they don't have
[36:26] that hungering, may you create it. If
[36:28] they do have that thirsting, may they
[36:30] create it. You said he, oh God, if any
[36:32] man thirst, let him count to me and
[36:33] drink. Oh God, may there be thirsty
[36:35] souls here tonight. Cleanse us, Lord,
[36:37] from the crown of our head to the sos of
[36:39] our feet. Cleanse our heart. Cleanse our
[36:41] mind. Cleanse our thinking. Change our
[36:44] attitude. Change our thinking. Change
[36:46] our ways, Lord, that we be harmony with
[36:49] your will, harmony in your word. You
[36:51] said, "Cry out, Lord." The people of
[36:52] Israel, they cried out, they could
[36:54] answer. You send them Moses. In every
[36:56] season, in every age, when they cried
[36:58] out, something broke forth. Something
[37:00] happened. And that prophet prophesied,
[37:02] we read it. Wait that little group that
[37:04] God gives that Elijah. Wait till they go
[37:07] to calling upon God. It will be a
[37:09] national showdown. Oh God, that is what
[37:11] is needed. Lord, the message world is
[37:13] comfortable. They at ease in Zan. They
[37:15] going through the motions. But Lord,
[37:17] there got to be a spirit, an anointing
[37:19] to to send a revival, a thirst, to send
[37:22] an atmosphere, to create an atmosphere
[37:23] that in the homes, the mothers will be
[37:25] in deep prayer, the fathers will be in
[37:28] deep prayer, not just saying words, but
[37:30] calling upon God and and crying out unto
[37:33] God and and hungering after God, knowing
[37:36] that we have busted through Laia and we
[37:38] have busted through all the hindrances
[37:39] of of the the sins of this age. Oh God,
[37:42] bless the people tonight as they get on
[37:44] in prayer. May your holy spirit come
[37:46] down upon them in a special way. Give
[37:48] them the uncction that this prayer
[37:50] tonight, this prayer meeting tonight be
[37:52] a special prayer meeting. May you
[37:53] release the uncction upon them that they
[37:55] will have that ability to pray with the
[37:58] uncction of the Holy Ghost upon them.
[37:59] Come upon their lips, come upon their
[38:01] hearts, come upon their mind, come upon
[38:03] the words, Lord. Put your thoughts in
[38:05] their heart and your words upon their
[38:07] lips as they pray and cry out unto thee.
[38:09] In Jesus name I ask it. Amen and amen.
[38:12] Praise the Lord. God bless you. Oh,
[38:14] hallelujah. As they get on in prayer,
[38:15] may the Holy Spirit be with you in a
[38:17] special way. Blessed be the name of the
[38:19] Lord. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Hallelujah.
[38:22] Hallelujah.
