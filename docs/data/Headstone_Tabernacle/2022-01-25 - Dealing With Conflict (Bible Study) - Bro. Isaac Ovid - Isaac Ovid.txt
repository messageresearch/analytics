bustle of the week there are so many ways we could be spending our time there are so many things we could choose to do but we choose you tonight we choose your word tonight we choose your will tonight

souls of their feet if there's someone tonight lord needing an encouragement a word from you may you speak to them tonight father take me out of the way lord i submit my thoughts my ideas to you lord for that you could speak lip to hear use me as your instrument that's just a microphone to speak to your children lord as we approach your scripture may you open our understanding to your word and may you be with each one tonight we commit this bible study to your hands in the precious name of jesus christ amen and amen and amen it's certainly a great privilege to be here tonight for bible study and um i really want to firstly salute brother ovid for the masterpiece of a message on sunday last my i don't even have the words to describe it and there was a such a super anointing that dropped down that i know was felt both in the tabernacle as well as those who were connected on the internet and truly it was not brought over that that that's how i'll say it it was not brought over it was a lord speaking through his servant to us and it was such a fitting timely message that i trust that if you um have not seen it that you certainly go check it out and for those who have it is certainly worth um watching again you know so i want to encourage you tonight for a few minutes as we continue to travel along the right road um in this journey in this 2022 um we would have had one bible study thus far this is our second um for the year and uh you know life has its way with so much that's coming to us you know as i was driving home from work today you know i was saying that you know if somebody were to stop me now for wood you know i've i've found myself more and more realizing that you know and we've said it it's about the right balance you know you you want to have the balance in your life the right balance with this time that we're living in the consciousness of the pandemic and and the stream it could place on you and sometimes it just gets you tired it gets you wary if you just get caught up in it even if you're not into it it's just a a atmosphere that you're in you know and it's so important and um you know i was thinking you know i said you know after elijah had his mount carmel you know experience you know he found himself there in a valley almost of depression as it were you know found himself there struggling you know and and the reality is you know sometimes we don't talk about it much but we get tired you know and sometimes we don't we don't want to admit it but sometimes we just get tired and it's important to know where your anchor holds when you get tired you know it's important to know what keeps you standing when when you may not have all of this strength to fight you know and and and in part i want to touch on that just uh just a little bit for a few minutes tonight i have a thought and i'm trusting god tonight to help bring it out in the right kind of a way that it could help us and if it is not focused at us specifically maybe can help someone who is in contact with us you know sometimes we come to church and and the word that comes to us and sometimes it is because we are so selfish that we hear something and we tell ourselves you know that's that's not for me and we miss the point that sometimes god is equipping us to deal with somebody that we will interact with somebody who comes into contact with us you know so i have learned more and more to not take things lightly you know and i want to encourage you tonight i sort of have two parts to this bible study and one part of it may be for you and if it's not for you it may be somebody you'll interact with a bit and then there's another part that i want to kind of touch on for everyone that i believe by the grace of god will be a blessing it's been a burden on my heart um for some time i shared it brother with what i wanted to kind of touch on and i don't know if i'll get into all of it tonight i told them this evening i don't intend to be too long and sometimes i say that and i go longer than i intend and um so i need to stop stop saying and just get to do it you know by the grace of god so i have a small thought tonight and it's not something that i have heard expressed much or talked about but it's something we all deal with so the tortoise is dealing with conflict dealing with conflict and conflict is inevitable you put two people in a room and it is actually impossible to get them to agree on every single thing that's the nature of life sometimes it's as a result of our upbringing it's our exposure what we have gone through sometimes as a result of trauma sometimes it's a result of maybe successes we would have had or feel as we would have had but we end up taking certain positions about certain things and maybe the position we take is not wrong but just because we take a position on something it is in conflict with someone else's position and as a result there's conflict sometimes you walk into a room and you realize that somebody in your room just just don't take to you and for some reason you have to contend with that you have to deal with that and it is not that you chose a part a path of conflict but you just have to deal with conflict there's conflict in families there's conflict that's inevitable in a family so it is not that you're not supposed to have conflict what we want to speak about a little bit tonight is how to deal with conflict there's conflict in marriages and if that is not dealt with in the right way it could lead to big problems there's conflict between siblings brothers and sisters sisters and sisters brothers and brothers and if it's not dealt with the right way we could end up with big problems there's conflict between parents and children children and parents and if it's not dealt with the right way as spiritual as we may be as educated as we may be as talented as experienced as mature as we think we are conflict that is handled in a wrong way leads to great issues countries have gone to war over matters that could have been discussed some conflicts took place because of issues in the translation of language and the list goes on and on but the reality is conflict we will always have sometimes we shake when we go into family gatherings when the whole family come together because whenever especially when they're from a big family you have all these ideas and opinions and perspectives and god help you if you start to talk about the government and politics and the socio-economic situation and no matter what it is you get this flurry of of of of energy and and argument and debate and some people live for that wait you know to get in a room where they can say well you right here what happened here and going on and no it's not so it's not so and i hear from somebody else and no you're wrong no that is not and and they live in that and and conflict could be subtle it could be expressed it could be external it could also be internal so tonight i want to deal with it from two perspectives i want to touch on the internal conflict i also want to deal with some external conflicts now normally when i am looking at breaking stuff like this out i always like to deal with the external first and leave the internal last because i always say the greatest enemy is is yourself it's it's actually easier to deal with with with other people but you see but that that enemy within is the big one to you to deal with you know and and to not do it a disservice by the grace of god i want to reverse the script a little bit and deal with the internal conflict a little bit first but not maybe how you might think it might be i want to deal with it because conflict is not just about argument conflict is about a clash a class of ideas a clash of principles sometimes you don't know where you're standing so you're you're undecided and even being undecided itself is a form of conflict sometimes you don't know where you stand and you trying to reconcile where you stand even where you stand with god and because of that there is conflict some of us find ourselves in conflict with god we're not even dealing with church we find ourselves in conflict with god anybody with me tonight so i want to start a little bit by before getting into into into conflicting family and this kind of stuff i want to talk a little bit about conflict the conflict within and if most of us would care to admit it we would always have to deal with this conflict within and how do we find back the anchor or the balance or recalibrate or the north star or wherever you want to see it and i can find almost no better example for for this part of it than the psalmist david and as i would have said david is unique i'm hard-pressed when i look at bible characters i always say it's very difficult to identify who my favorite bible character is it really doesn't sound right to say you have a favorite but david has an unfair advantage only because he is one of the only characters in scripture that we see so much of his life for most other characters it's a sliver it's a portion of a period in their lives but in the case of david we see the young david as a boy we see the teenager we see the young king we see the david on the run we see the old david you see david on the death bed we see the tapestry of his life before us and i would have preached when i spoke on david a man after god's own heart that almost every emotion that somebody could experience david felt it not just felt it he expressed it so he would go through and we would have read it where you read in psalms 3 for example where david would scream out oh lord how are they increase that trouble me many are there that rise up against me many there be with say of my soul there is no help for him in god but thou o lord had a shield for me every time i read these scriptures it's an encouragement to me but though oh lord and and and i love the use as i was thinking about the study of the word but because david always creates this contrast of his situation but he always find the butt to separate how he feels from the path where god gets involved and it's such an encouragement because he said lord how did i increase and go and receive but and he puts a line in his hand and he says but no matter how i feel but now oh lord at a shield from me my glory and the lifter up of my head i cried unto the lord with my voice and he heard me out of his holy hill i laid me down and slept i awaked for the lord sustained me this is the same man who earlier in this chapter talking about how many increases that trouble in him but now he is declaring for himself i will not be afraid of ten thousands of people that have set themselves against me route about somehow through his expression of what he was going through he found his butt movement he found his anchor movement he found where he could make a left turn around along the road he was going to because he could have kept going down the road of the self-pity the road of the negativity the road of the challenges the road of the overwhelming stress and we get overwhelmed i told somebody recently i feel overwhelmed and i and i not shamed to say it because life sometimes gets us overwhelmed but we have to find the butt moment but thou o lord and david is the example because david through scripture the bible said he encouraged himself and i was saying to myself and you have to forgive me sometimes before i preach to you or share something with you i'm preaching to myself so i have the experience if you meet mr mind driving and you see me talking and nobody around no worries is you are talking to just in advance you know what i and i was saying to myself coming out of my car because i can remember how this sequence took place i see how blessed we are to be able to gather on a tuesday evening to get a word of encouragement david didn't have that in him david had to find his butt moment he has to find his his own way and the bible said he encouraged himself in the lord right now we shall be so grateful that we can have the opportunity to gather like this but there will come a time friends when we have to encourage ourselves in the lord when there'll be no opportunity like this to be encouraged but you need to know what bank account you're drawing your strength from and understand that your signature is good as your father's or anybody with me tonight that whatever you have need of you could tap into and you can encourage yourself no matter what you're going through so this is the david and the reconciliation of david but this david doesn't sound overly overwhelmed david this david he is overwhelmed but there's a level of overwhelmness and in part the conflict of understatement is about that being overwhelmed psalms 8 we see a different contrast of david oh lord our good o lord our lord how excellent is thy name in all the years who has set thy glory above the heavens out of the mouth of babes and sucklings had our ordained strength because of thine enemies that thou might is still the enemy and the avenger when i consider thy heavens the work of thy fingers the moon and the stars which thou has ordained what is mindful of him and the son of man that thou visited him but thou has made him a little lower than the angels and has crowned him with glory and honor and when i look at this picture of david you see almost the other side of david the david is on fire for god and that's wonderful but for a few moments i want to go into one psalm that sees another picture of david and as i was going through this study i was like wow i pray this will be an encouragement to you tonight and like i said this is the part where say if it's not for you maybe it'll help you encourage somebody else so i want to look at psalm 13 and we'll take it a bit slowly we'll see how far how much we do into this and then determine by the grace of globally time where we'll go next psalms 13 verse 1 you can find it with me and listen to the conflict remember we talk about dealing with conflict right this is the internal conflict and david is saying how long will thou forget me oh lord forever anybody ever felt forgotten anybody ever felt like you're waiting on a promise you're looking for something and you're wondering lord even there is there hope for me is there a way i feel forgotten i see i see other people getting blessed to see things happening but it's as if god forget me not only was david accepting a level of forgetting but he was asking how long and he almost come to a conclusion forever like there's no end it is forgetting now this is david expressing how he's feeling huh many times you talk to people and they feel like listen i don't know how long i could keep going you know but here they're saying lord how long will thou forget me oh lord forever how long will thou hide thy face from me anybody ever feel like they're praying and they're carrying and they're holding on and they're looking for a change and sometimes sometimes sometimes it feels like there's there's no answer and you can almost feel like i wonder if god even looking in my direction i wonder if if i waste some time because david was expressing sometimes what we may not even care to express ourselves david was feeling and expressing his feeling how long will thou hide thy face in other words david is saying lord are not seeing your face lord oh i want to see him look upon his face and and the the other part because david's expression would would would reflect that he was longing to connect but it as if god wasn't doing his part i want us to catch this so the conflict david is feeling i don't want to miss this it's a simple short chapter but it's deep in its meaning because many times when people give up it's because they feel like they say this thing not working i don't know how long i could and i want you to understand that you are not alone sometimes and feeling like is there a way out is there hope for me is god gonna answer my prayer is this is this worth it how long will thou hide thy face for me so david wasn't seeing it in a positive perspective that maybe maybe god has taken me through something david processed the silence of god as god hiding his face from him and one of the challenges with us is sometimes we have expectations of god and god's plan for us is different from our expectations and we process god's wisdom in a negative light all of us have gone through experiences in the last two years that could sometimes if we're out of the spirit we could wonder oh lord how long how long will you forget me forever how long will you hide your face from here praying for a change of job i'm praying for a situation in my home i'm praying for the conflict in my job to be resolved but how long will you hide your face from me because i want to get a response from you but it seems as if i getting no response like i said maybe it's not for you but maybe in having a conversation with a brother a sister a son a mother a father somebody else you could show them in scripture how to deal with when things aren't answered and things are unresolved and there's no closure to issues that you want closed listen to verse two how long shall i take counsel in my soul this is that counsel in your soul as you and yourself in other words david is saying are trying to resolve it inside for a long time i really need your help to resolve what's inside this is this is deep nowhere david is not dealing with his wife his brother his sister the priest the prophet the generals this is david himself saying this is me dealing with me how long shall i take counsel in my soul me trying to resolve my personal issues he said having sorrow in my heart daily this is the picture of somebody who has a burden as a situation maybe have nobody to talk to and they find themselves just taking counsel in their soul maybe you don't want to talk to nobody but it's there there's a sorrow in your heart daily and you're asking god a question lord how long will you forget me is it forever is there an end to it how long will you hide your face from me how long shall i take counsel in my soul having sorrow in my heart daily and david goes on how long shall my enemy be exalted over me this is one of the few places in scripture with this repetition and it speaks of the agony how long how long how long how long we don't know the mind of god in this we don't know what god is trying to unveil and david here but we know his perspective his feeling his emotion and for many of us who we sometimes don't want to wait on the will of god and way through the plan of god we end up in a state of thee how long verse 3 consider and hear me o lord my god consider and hear me oh lord my god lighten mine eyes lighten mine eyes is a powerful statement it means to lift the weight over my eyes meaning my eyes not seeing my eyes are darkened my eyes are dimmed over i need a new perspective anybody tonight need a new perspective so david went that entire verse one and two is addressing what god can do and and this here is a real example of a journey of prayer and a finding back yourself in conflict it would almost appear in verse one that god is a problem i want us to understand how david himself because i always say david found a way to talk himself out of the situations and it's very it's a very teaching moment for us he starts off it's almost like he is almost accusing god how long will don't forget me oh lord meaning it's not an easy problem here right now you know lord is you you forgetting me how long will you do that he's almost pointing his finger at god in in in chapter one verse one in verse one all right how long will you hide your face from me almost as if to say if you were showing me your face my situation would be different so i am not the problem you are the problem i want us to catch this picture and how the reconciliation needs to take place of this conflict so here is internal conflict david is calling god to task how long will you forget me how long will you hide from me then he starts to move from god being the issue to himself being the issue how long shall i take counsel in my soul having sorrow in my heart how long shall my enemy be exalted over me then he starts to switch and this is important friends consider and hear me oh lord my god he makes a change and he confronts it lighten my eyes you know what you know what you know what tonight perhaps perhaps perhaps i'm not seeing things the right way i need a new perspective because if i don't see things different less i sleep the sleep of death so you're saying to god lighten mine eyes anybody catching this it's a simple chapter here in psalms and this is the psalmist david and the only man in scripture called a man after god's own heart saying let me recalibrate my perspective lighten my eyes maybe i have one shades maybe i have on darkers maybe you're allowing stuff to cloud with judgment because i'm not seeing things slightly but lord if you don't lighten my eyes and help me see this differently i'm gonna die when i saw this it confronted to me a whole issue for all of us as believers sometimes we need a new perspective sometimes we need to look at situations again sometimes we have looked at things for so long we haven't realized that our eyes have gotten dim and dark and we are not seeing what god wants us to see but david snapped himself in time to say lord lighten mine eyes lest i sleep the sleep of death lest my enemy that's a continuation she said unless i get a new perspective i'm going to die lest i see the sleep of death lester my enemies say i have previewed against him so in other words if i don't get a new perspective if my eyes don't get lightened tonight away from the negativity and the darkness and looking at the wrong things and seeing you wrong things and having a wrong perspective or wrong focus around image in my mind because your eyes you want into your soul if you stop seeing the right thing you can never find yourself anybody with me tonight lest my enemies say i have prevailed against him without a vision the people perishing this is it here david said i'm not seeing if if you don't light my eyes i'll die without a vision without vision without seeing that i'm a child of the king without seeing that is a possibility without seeing the opportunity that the realm of the spirit can give me to tap into the heavenlies i'll sleep to sleep of death lest my enemies say i have revealed against him and those that trouble me rejoice when i am moved i trust his encouragement to him because david start to pull himself out this here is almost the one defining chapter in the book of psalms where david could be almost described as being the most depressed he was ever was when you read if you read that first two verses alone and you walked away you would say this is a depressed man he was depressed but david is clawing himself out climbing pulling himself out of that condition and by verse 5 he throws in the but but i have trusted in thy mercy i have seen few people who could find i said finding the butt in your life but lord you took me through but when i had no food you put food on my table but when i didn't know how i was gonna pay this bill you make a way but when i couldn't see my way out and this but also when you read it it's also in past tension but i have trusted in thy mercy so he began to reconnect and that's why it's so important friends to have an experience or foundation something that angers you that you could reconnect up but i have trusted in my mercy and then he says my heart now we speak in future so he went he connected he passed i hope you see any subtle teachings here this is a lesson and you say but i have trusted in in my mercy great is thy faithfulness if i didn't trust any mercy i wasn't here as bad as i think things might be i'll look back and see i could not be here tonight if it wasn't for you and it's because i have trusted in thy mercy and now he speaks he he don't need to go back no more because he found back his anchor if you're falling down you want to find a place to stop falling to climb back up but he said my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation so he already see this situation resolved because he said my heart already rejoices in thy salvation meaning i know there's a way out of this and then he now declares to everybody so in other words if you had seen david 10 minutes before and say call the doctor and they come back 10 minutes later you see it don't call the doctor because here you have david saying i will sing unto the lord because he had dealt bountifully with me how do you move from how long will thou forget me oh lord so i will sing unto the lord because he half past tense dealt bountifully with me so i want to encourage you tonight and this here is a lesson of so many proportions it is dealing with this is david and he actually resolved his internal conflict and the reality is i want us to look at this from a simple perspective if you had approached brother david when he was in verse one of his life in this chapter you would say boy david in a real bad mood you can't talk to him they even want to hear nobody right now david just in a state brother david watch now leave him alone now let's do it because david right now he and the david in verse 6 he is a whole different version of he's a whole different synonym by the time he reached verse six he is singing you know he not he he actually singing you know people for each other rejoicing in them all right do we have these spiritual maturity friends to help ourselves move from verse 1.6 do we have enough enough built in in our internal combustion chambers to move ourselves from verse one to verse six it's just you and god making me move you reconciling because i don't know in chapter 13 what was the issue some scholars speculate because we know science is not chronologically written some speculate is what's with absalom okay but we don't know but what we know it whatever it was almost brought david to our halt and the reality is friends life will many times bring us to our halt with bad news with disappointment with rejection with issues with resentment with betrayal all of these are forms of conflict and we must learn how to deal with it we must become stronger at dealing with it and we must be able to come out of it as quickly as possible to see the situation because our emotions can get better of us and when we allow our emotions to take over we make decisions we regret we do things we regret we see things we regret we act in ways that we regret because we are not where we're supposed to be in god the david in verse one and two may have said things he didn't want to say anybody with me tonight we're dealing with dealing with conflict sir but this is not i know it's not if it's all kind of thing we can deal with there but but i first want to deal with us because if we could resolve the us then everything else had to get easier you know many times the arguments and the fussing and the debates in our homes with our families with our loved ones with situations we have been arguments and it's because it's not right with us and because we had a bad game we take it out on somebody because we get bad news we take it out on somebody we say what we shouldn't say and i want us to practice that recalibration and if it's one thing i want to take out of this is what stuck the most to me is lighten mine eyes because i recognize the devil's job is to get you to take your eyes off of god is to get you to see your flesh your mistakes your situations your problems if the devil can get a look at your credit card statement and your bank loan and what's not working out and keep your focus there i'm not on god's provision you're finishing them the devil job is to remind you lord help us tonight i trust this is an encouragement to us in some way tonight so i want to now step a little bit into a little thought a little bit about dealing with conflict and by no means is this something that i think could be exhausted in our session because conflict between family is real it could affect so much it could extend for years conflict and marriage you know but over a few weeks ago was speaking about tools and tips and different things and he talked about making your house a home and i was driving meditating and i would come back to what he said and say conflict can make your home a house [Laughter] conflict can reverse the situation you know you know conflict if if if if you know when you go home it's an argument waiting for you somebody's life slower sometimes you take extra gas you know you make a grocery stop because you know what waiting for you when you get home you know and if it's an unresolved issue you know it is something that could that could you know it make it a house make it a house you know so but we have to learn to deal with conflict and we have to understand that if conflict does exist what is the christian way and not christianizing jewish christianity the christ-like way because to be christians to be like christ how does christ want us to deal with conflict we may not agree on if it's to cook chicken not to cook before and and and and and you'll be surprised sometimes you see menu is a conflict sometimes is is where to buy something is here you buy the wrong thing sometimes it's simple things and people that talk for a day or two days or evening or you know and it seeps in their christian journey so you're driving to church you're on your way to church you know but nobody talking because everybody mad everybody vexed and you come to church and you worship hallelujah and when you're in church nobody no is conflict within the conflict you left it right in the car and the moment you go back in the car you pick it up right where you left it to continue to be conflicted anyway all right so it is real it is life and and that is family but there's conflict on the job there are people what monday morning is like the worst it's done apart from all the memes about monday morning work and stuff but if there's conflict in your job and you know there's somebody ought to get you and you're always arguing and the environment is toxic there's a lot to deal with it's real what is also sad there's conflicting church yeah so it's one thing you say well it's that marriage conflict family conflict me about conflict the work business conflict you have a competitive but it's conflicting church and we can't spend the time to go into it but the reality is when there's confliction with this brother not seen i tied with his brother and this brother take my seat and this sister take my spot and this one was clapping too loud and i if i could tell you the list that has reached me on the memo who has shake your hand who shake your hand too hard who i mean if it's one and and the list goes on it's thing that people make the issue the issue with you wanted a song who who wants to sing i'm special and they're getting special and for five years the effects they missed 90 percent of the content of the service because they're still sitting on because they didn't get to sing the special that they wanted to sing and because of that brother so and so who they told they wanted singing special didn't tell the pastor and did him and his conflict no some of us may smile and laugh but this is real you know and then you want to get any scriptures but if you have an ought and you want to and recognize when you're ready unwind the ought well well brother it was 10 years ago i did bring my guitar and it asks a player song and they didn't let me play it and since then i was looking at you funny and i never really let it go and it might sound trivial but the reality is that thought that's mine and grow and nourish them get food eliza and manure and get bigger and bigger and grow and grow and grow until when they come to the altar to pray they came praying because this get a story from 10 years ago you know well let me sing yeah you didn't make my usher you take me from being asha you move a seat your movie fan you found one by somebody else and and this is in the church dealing with conflict but matthew 5 9 says blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of god and i can't remember i remember sometime i don't even but overdealt with it all but we talk about being a peacemaker and how important it is to be a peacemaker you you ever meet somebody and they say but that person real argument everybody just like to argue in school there was a debate society even if they have a good point or you you right they still want to find you one thing to say but you know it's so and so on so on so and so there are people who just like friction like every place quiet they're uncomfortable but the christian nature jesus is saying blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of god are you a peacemaker in your job you know it's the opposite of a peacemaker i remember in school i show you all the way to this somebody says something to somebody and there's always always somebody in the corner you taking that you see you take in that group dicey people they have nothing to do with the situation you know but something happened oh no no no no you taking that and when somebody hear that enough that they rather people who can't fight get gassed up battery pack get turned on and they go on your beat up on them because somebody in the corner the classroom say you take taking that nah he can't talk to me so you see so so in life you have people who thrive they have they get up they they get excited when they see conflict i remember in school you always doing a fight breakout in school fight fight fight why why people was he why people don't say peace peace peace our nature we glorify this kind of foolishness but christ sent us blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of god can you you youth here tonight be called a peacemaker in your family is it your nature to try to pacify to resolve conflict to close off argument to say no let me leave it here don't let it go any further don't let's advance it it's not worth it do you know how many people have lost their lives for simple small arguments that just went so far out of proportion i remember being in secondary school and two fellows got into an argument over who had 50 cent for somebody and that led to a young man dying because it escalated and escalated escalate over 50 cents and you ask yourself was he worth of a life wasn't there anybody around who could say okay that's enough don't take it further don't take it further but now we are challenged as believers because when a husband and wife is arguing and it's escalating both are guilty of not being peacemakers eh and all you really take is one person of the two to be the peacemaker you know because the bible says soft answer that stood away right so the reality is the concept of being a peacemaker among your siblings among friends among believers among your coworkers has a lot to do with with you and your response and the way you treat treated situations even when you're right and have a right to do something you have to discern is it worth it is it worth it picking the fight is it worth it having an argument about something that's not worth fighting for because if you see there are bigger issues to be dealt with somebody's you have to pick your battles friends anybody with me tonight so i want to encourage you from the words of the lord jesus himself if you take the approach this could be a conflict but i am going to be the peacemaker in this i'm not trying to advance the conflict there's always multiple ways to deal with situations and the moment conflict starts most people can't remain logical and uncontrollable your emotion gets warmed up and then god help us some of us we start to pull back the parts well it was five years ago what was the last time you and before you know it your whole history your whole biology your whole resume come out and another emotion you see things that you don't want to say and you can't take these words back isn't it better to just be a peacemaker let's go on a trust is helping you in some way you know this is a cause of practical teaching tonight romans 12 18 this is paul listen to this one if it be possible as much as light in you in other words if it is possible and as much as it's within you live peaceably with all men not only your friends or no this is romans 12 18 if you take any notes romans 12 18 if it be possible as much as light in you in other words as much as is within your power live peacefully with all all all is all i always say with the bible all is all as much as possible meaning it is our duty it is our responsibility to find a peaceful way to resolve situations this was an encouragement to me proverbs 16 7. proverbs 16 7 and this is this is a scripture that i want to this is this is just an encouragement to me when a man's ways please the lord he make it even his enemies to be at peace with him that to me is such a scripture to live by in other words you could please god so much that god gets involved in dealing with conflict by making your enemies to have peace with you and don't tell me you don't have enemies in them because even if sam is david say don't be prs a table for me right in front of my enemies while my enemies watching you taking all the food and laying it out in their view there will always be somebody who don't like you after you live to the best of your effort there's somebody who just said take to you and it's not our job to convince everybody to be with us that's that's not it we're living for christ everybody didn't like jesus in fact they persecute him they call him walk in the names if they will do that to the perfect man who walked the earth you with your imperfection trying to please everybody with the hope that you could convince everybody that you are the best thing since life's read you have to accept the reality that somebody would say bye yeah that church money people get a church man all kind of thing they want to say there's nothing you could do about that but if it is possible as much as light in you live peacefully with all men and your goal is to please you lord so much that he make even your enemies to be at peace with you notice the scripture didn't say he will make your enemies your friend and him these status remains an amazing except they're peaceful so i want us to appreciate the reality of life god and say i will turn all your enemies into your friends he says when a man wins please the lord he will make even his enemies to be at peace with him so underscore the fact that there will always be disagreement there will always be conflict there will always be situations but there's a way that we can live through this conflict through situations through things we cannot understand and with god's help we will overcome it anybody with me ephesians 4 a short teaching tonight i hope this is helping us in some way ephesians 4 verse 1 to 3 this is paul i here for the prisoner of the lord beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation where it you are called in other words besieged means to beg so he's begging you that you work you walk worthy in other words that your life your talk your the way you're moved the way you speak the way you live is worthy of the vocation you're called to an office and there's an expectation of that office there's an expectation of your attitude the way you use your words your whatever wherever you're called and he qualifies that worthiness of the vocation with all loneliness and meekness with long suffering forbearing one another in love that's like tolerating one another in love endeavoring endeavouring is the active process of working to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace nowhere in here speaks about you trying to find conflict with people conflict with brethren conflict with anybody at all it is all about loneliness and meekness and long-suffering for bearing one another endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace is this helping anybody tonight i'm not going to be too much longer trust this is helping you in some way let's go now we're going gonna take a few from the book of proverbs you know robert has been speaking a lot about wisdom knowledge and understanding and i know we did a bible study in that some months ago proverbs 17 14. proverbs 17 14 and this will help us in family it will help us in business and help us in life proverbs 17 14. if you have it let's go the beginning of strife is as when one lettered out water therefore leave off contention before it be meddled with i want to read it in the amplified so the beginning of a strife is like letting out water as a small break in a dam first it trickles and then it gushes this is the amplifier i'm reading therefore abandon the quarrel before it breaks out and tempers explode in other words nip it to the bottom so if you're taking notes and you want to change your environment in your home change your mind behind your family change by within your job just just try jesus try the scripture all right before it gets bigger treat it when it's small in other words the wisdom of sorrow by saying the beginning of a strife in other words every stripe have a beginning that we're saying here the beginning of a strife every strike have a beginning every arguments that are smaller no i see people argue about food and wood kitchens before simple thing you know who moved my food in the kitchen he work off his kitchen who moved my food nobody answer who move up and before you know it is big argument thing could be flying in the office uber and it was a cleaner the gesture fitting nobody are moving you know and it's you and an accusation and before it's a whole issue but every stripe every stripe you know the beginning of a stripe is as when one letter of water it started with a trickle and it could turn into a dam and before it break out and explode so solomon is saying here before the argument the next time you have a conversation think is is this going to be a strife because let me cut it here let's go proverbs 18 verse 13. proverbs 18 verse 13. he that answered a matter before he heard it it is folly and shame on to him so how much times we just end up arguing and then after you hold out you recognize you know what when we really understand situation we really didn't need to really argue you know because i didn't really um really understand i didn't really hear the problem so the whole argument all your blood pressure went up your throat red you're you're you have to drink water you think i mean when anyone finish with wine dung and you come down and the battery is so bad can i wait a minute you know it was i misunderstood what he probably wants to know do you know the phone is embarrassing your friend is embarrassing after you are you on your sweatshirt nothing about that you throw a whole time trauma with a non-issue and it's simple ways you know like sometimes somebody might misplace something in your house and i say karen you move whatever it is you move my tie no you move [Music] there's only two of us in the house anytime you know it's i don't take a movie time so it'd have to be you movie time i'll give you an example and when and when he when he marked bus the tie still in the car you know did nobody move it and after you get your energy up on up on it you reckon where it's not all that was unnecessary you know if you're gone check where the tie was in the first place and see where you left it right where you left it you wouldn't even be having this but when you retrace sometimes i sure you have been an argument i recognize you know i didn't have to argue or i didn't have all the information oh if i didn't really pause to really analyze it before i take a position to take up a fighting stance i could avoid this whole argument so the bible says he who answers before he hears the facts it is fully unashamed to him is he amplified let's go proverbs 18 verse 17. and on this one i really so so i want to read it first proverbs 18 and verse 17. he that is first in his own cause seemed just but his neighbor commit and search at him in other words in the amplified the first one to plead his case seems right until another comes and cross examines him friends all that's in the bible in him so how much time you get in the argument with only one side of the story that is what this is here you're ready to fight you're ready to fight you're ready to fight you're huffing on your husband you're all up in because you're here one side and you even wait to hear the other side of the story because if you take time to listen now you can properly wait first before you take an opposition and the bible is saying the first person to come to you with a matter does seem right because the story coming to you first some children know that manipulation game so well they run to daddy or mummy because the first person because daddy won't be here in this world johnny taught this talking to me and you that's the first time you hear it you're ready to respond without even asking johnny well johnny what happened you done blazing suzanne left right and center or blazing johnny or every it's mayhem but you only have one side of your story so even the bible given you how to be just and mature in these matters now you know so and i really admire and i was going to say it one thing i see with brad robert many times he will listen to something and before you take a positional act you want to know the other side of the story you say i'll get back to you i'll get back to you because you want to know the other side before you take a position everybody just run in one side you could end up into so much problems and sometimes people miscommunicate things or they give you partial information so they child and say well daddy johnny hit me and that's the only part here and they're going and beat johnny when johnny finally come down you say well johnny well well what happened well david hitman's listening but you never david never seen hit first in him he does bring the part of it that is appropriate for what he needs let's go proverbs 18 19. and this is deeper because i find sometimes when we act impulsively in our emotion in our feelings we sometimes don't understand what i call these second order consequences you ripple effect of our behaviors and solomon is saying here this is a cautionary warning a brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city and their contentions are like the bars of a castle so in other words when you end up in a conflict with a brother conflict with a sister sometimes it's harder to patch it back up and the work to patch it back up or to win back the relationship solomon could be as hard as a strong city because you have done unnecessary damage to a relationship because you created a conflict or pursued a conflict that either did not need to happen or any emotions you said or did the wrong thing let us let us think on these things friends proverbs 23 i'm almost done proverbs 20 verse 3. it is an honor for a man to cease from strife but every fool will be meddling i'll say it one more time and really amplify it it is an honor for a man to cease from strife but every fool will be meddling and strike whenever you see strife is conflict right it is an honor for a man to cease from strife but every fool will be meddling so solomon is actually honorable for you to avoid conflict but hand always in the middle of backhand as you see here in trinidad they're the oils in the middle of something and something's not part of you know something is is known you know they say known to the police the people with conflict known to be in conflict they're always in an argument listen to the amplified it is an honor for a man to keep away from strife by handling situations with thoughtful foresight but any fool will start or quarrel without regard for the consequences anybody with me just a few more we're done dealing with conflict through the scriptures see the position so when you see a believer always ranting and raving and is this and is he government and is he disc and is he king and is he boss and is he man is that a christian behavior is is this an alignment is this an alignment with what you think christ wants to see our behaviors and i'm fighting for the lord you're fighting for which lord matthew 5. we're going into new testament now before we get ready to close out is this helping anybody tonight to reframe how you talk how you approach situations thinking before you act we know you know they tell us in promise you don't think before you speak thank you for your act but the impulsiveness now look at his spiritual sense of it now because conflict now let's take it in matthew 5 verse 23 therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar and there are the pointer there rememberist that thy brother had ought against thee now listen carefully here this is not even you have ought against them therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar and their remembrance that thy brother have ought against thee and that thought also just means an issue an unresolved issue with thee leave there thy gift before the altar because god had taken it god don't want that kind of offering in other words don't come and bring it with conflict and you know you have conflict he said leave there that i give before the altar so you say well well i hear all a thing with conflict and god is saying resolve your issues before you're coming i'm bringing you alter in other words i don't want you trying to pray and offer your offering and you know you have matters you need to close off and you left stuff in a way that shouldn't have been left your settings make it right leave there thy gift before the altar and go thy way first be reconciled to thy brother in other words close the gap on the conflict and then come and offer thy gift because your gift is a requirement of the gardener but there's a way there's an approach oh hallelujah there's an approach to god and as part of the approach to god is an approach that is a life of peacefulness a life without unresolved issues a life that if you know it is a matter to be reserved treat it in a certain way you're not treating any viking vaccine there's a way to choose with it i just want to read that in the amplified quickly so if you are presenting your offering at the altar and while there you remember that your brother has something such as a grievance or legitimate complaint against you so maybe you did something so sometimes we use the word ought and don't understand what an ought really means remember that your brother is something sort of a grievance or somebody complaining about you have an issue with you and you know maybe you hurt somebody a certain way or maybe they misunderstand you or maybe you had an argument leave your offering there you also go first make listen listen to the words make peace with your brother and then come and present your offering i challenge you tonight let us look at our relationships as we look at our conversations let me look at our attitudes people must see christ living in us this is the message you know i don't care how much books do you have how much tips you have if you can't live peacefully if you can't live a life that is the virtue of god that we can see sweetness and humility that's the thunder the devil is not a book it's not a tape there's not no hindi message is the lie that's lived that confuses the devil because you go contrary to the expectation you're supposed to fly off your hand though but you didn't do it and they can't understand why because you're so grounded in the revelation of the mystery of god and these scriptures are real to you that when you could say something look at jesus they were taking him to calvary and he said that a word he didn't say a word they beat him when he uttered not a word for some of us i have taken that we're quick to respond we we we in a minute but look at jesus let's go almost done a few more minutes now matthew 18. and this is now carving now closer to home become another closer to home closer to personal one-on-one issues now and i want us to appreciate the fact that in scripture god given us every way to deal with every situation and that's why i say the bible is the best book on marriage the best book on living a holy life the best book on business the best book on anything you need to know is in the scriptures because god gave us all things the bible says pertaining to life and godliness so you want to run a successful business it's in the scripture you want to accelerate in your career it's in the scripture you want to have good family relation it's in the scripture you want to save money it's in the scripture you want to live healthy it's in the scripture no if you follow the formula the formula works so listen to the formula and when you understand this formula you will recognize because of the way god is when you operate outside of his formula you're running into problems so listen to how god says moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee so your brother offend you do something this is sin whatever it is go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone first step of the formula so you have an offense somebody here yeah i say well you know what i do now facebook whatsapp stories haters will always be there no loyalty and before you know it it taken two minutes to figure out well so and sort of a beef with so and so or you're going to tell all your friends boy yeah see what he do and this way do me up to no you haven't spoken to the brother yet listen to listen to the scripture if thy brother shall trespass against thee go and tell him is fall between thee and him alone the issue doesn't that there are nobody else how come tom and jenny and sister jane and sister i don't call it nobody else is the judy and i who are calling names no nobody how come they're all aware of the trespass and the person who is involved in trespassing you you haven't even had a conversation with them yet hey brother i don't know if you realize but you certainly kind of offend me i just want to kind of make sure that you understand that i already want to be at peace and i will tell you what you did you you know true language not you going until 50 brothers hey when you see that that is that and that what he that is immature behavior that is prime minister thing let me leave that in private school saying here you better say if i brought offend you is between you and them if that feels if he shall hear thee listen thou has gained my brother you know as powerful it is if you go to somebody's listen i didn't appreciate how you said that you know about me and stuff and maybe you misunderstood maybe i am missing and said but let me just clear it up okay great it over no problem god bless you and and that dead right there dead right there the bible said you have gained a brother because most of us the opposite is you blast them up you light them up first response even in the working world friends if hr getting involved in something there's something called progressive discipline there's a viewable warning there's written warning there's suspension people you don't have two minutes we're terminating too fast enough we turn it in too fast so even god has a process he said listen go one on one is you one on one if that brother sister hears you you're closing matter perfect you have gained a brother the matter is always dead we're 16 but if he will not hear thee so that i will you tried you you're following the process you know what matters went to court and fell apart in court because the process wasn't followed so you want to know do you process this due process if step one don't work if he will not hear thee then take the iphone go to whatsapp and send to facebook message and light up it that is not what i'm reading here if he was not heavy then take with the one or two more one or two not three we are read three yet we are reached we have five yet where it's 10 yet where is 15 people in the lupine what's going on here yet if he will not hear thee then take with me one or two more that in the amount of two or three witnesses every word may be established so now there's a paper trail in the heavenlies of use following the process boy i see but a mic and that brother had a little issue but i might talk to the brother you better hear listen so about a mic call but are you i'm an isaac and he went and talked to him that's what he just writing on and if they reason with him to show him that that approach he took wasn't right and after by the michael brother human rights i talked to him he barely said when he was 17. if he shall neglect to hear them tell it unto the church but if he neglect to hear the church now the church don't get involved so you see god actually say it's a system to deal with issues so if one and one they can't resolve it if bringing a two witnesses carries over if the church is now saying my brother this is not the be this is not the conduct if the church if he neglected here he should let him be unto thee as a heathen and republican last scripture i believe close last scripture i believe here james 4 1. we close up with this from whence come wars and fightings among you so this is now what justin believer is they're from whence come wars and fightings among you come there not hence even of your lust that war in your members ye lust and have not ye kill and desire to have and cannot obtain fight and war yet you have not because you ask not he asked and received not because he asked abyss that you may consume it upon your lust so i want to read that those three verses in the amplified so you get a little more clarity on what the bible is saying here what leads to the unending quarrels and conflicts among you do they not come from your hedonistic desires that wage war in your bodily members fighting for control over you and now he goes into what he's referring to you are jealous and covet what others have and your lust goes unfulfilled so you murder you are envious and cannot obtain the object of your envy so you fight and battle you do not have because you do not ask it of god you ask god for something and do not receive it because you ask with wrong motives out of selfishness or with an unrighteous agenda so that when you get what you want you may spend it on your hedonistic desires so this is how i like to know this understanding of what causes conflict well i don't like you because really actually deep down you don't like you have a car a new car and you again you can help you may not want to admit it but the bible says jealousy is coveted these are the issues that at war so what's really happening is your internal conflict and i'm closing with this became an external conflict you couldn't resolve that's what the bible say you know what leads so this is what a tying now that first part so if david couldn't resolve his internal issues it manifested if you can resolve your issues you take it out on your chairing dignity in your family take it out on your co-workers you take it out on the church and suddenly the pastor and it should and it's really your internal issues your unresolved issues that is your internal conflict that became an external issue and manifested many times people beat up people and recognize well it's really not the person they beat up they had the issue with you know but it was pent up energy and and issues that it was just it's like a pressure cooker explode it was just the last show you were trying to go into a taxi and you stopped the taxi and said when you're 20 and you get so back you're not going to manually in the taxi and it's not really you've actually taxi manual but this whole week you feel like people jumping in front of the line and this is just the last man to jump before the line so your internal conflict about line jumping now manifest itself in one man unconscious and you now in the politician trying to explain if you knew this man i didn't know the man and then when you really resolve it you recognize is the whole week back up on you and you lose control so here it is saying what leads to the quarrels and the conflicts do not come from your desires that wage war in your members so the root cause of the conflicts don't be identified enough because if you can't wait for something and it's really impatience is what is on the inside then the impatience manifests itself and when you reach home and the food already at the economy where they put it ready why do food already and and a situation that could have just be well hey you didn't the pressure cooker wasn't working or this wasn't okay you had to take time to hear that yes you know so your internal issues now become an external issue and before you know it the port gone flying you fool's gone flying no you really have no food anybody with me but here we see that connection between the internal conflict becoming a similar conflict i am done for tonight i trust that in some ways something was said tonight that you could really look at your internal conflict and relook at your external issues because they are real and we have to be victorious there is a right way there is a better way there is a perfect way shall we pray heavenly father we thank you tonight for this session lord through your scriptures as we look at this theme of conflict and lord when we reflect and truly reflect we can realize how many situations we could have avoided how many things could have been different have we taken a different approach had we stopped to listen to think to reflect to pray to ponder to wear the sides of a situation before getting involved how we allowed our internal conflicts to become external our own internal resolve unresolved issues manifesting themselves lord we are so grateful that you lean in your word that lord blessed are the peacemakers this is something you want to see he said with all that is within us if it's within our possibility and our strength live peacefully with all men you tell us if we have unresolved conflict we can't even present our gift at the altar oh god help us to become united not because of rotor because of letter lord because of love your love for peace your love for purity your love for us to live a certain kind of way in a world that's dark and violent and evil where people say what they want whether they have the liberty to to to declare how they think things should be we are challenged to speak the way you would speak say the things that you would see help us to be subject to your holy spirit father lord that we could be reflections of your majesty of your glory as a prophet said ambassadors be gods advertisement boards help us father that we not lose our tempers and get caught up in emotions and lash out unnecessarily but lord we work towards peace and not having conflict may you strengthen marriages in this room may you strengthen the bonds of family in this room the bond between parents and children children and parents the bond between siblings lord may you strengthen the believers lord may you root out conflict may you root out all 10 grudges may you help us on our jobs lord in this world we live in where we meet people with different principles and different values and different compasses and different moral values and these things father a lot is still walk in that world that where your bible said lord if we walk in your way father you can make it possible that even our enemies will be at peace with us father it's all there in scripture we have no excuse we have no excuse to lose our temple we have no excuse to be irrational we have no excuse to fly off the handle that's not the behavior he said we're supposed to be so sweet so humble so meek so gentle that the dog the holy spirit could just land there and abide may the holy spirit abide with us because we create an environment and an atmosphere and your holy spirit would be pleased may you bless your people tonight may you bless the service tomorrow night may you bless the special service this

children's bread is already paid for we make a withdrawal tonight from what has already been paid for the check has already been signed we are writing what we need on the check tonight and we need healing we need a touch in our bodies we need all for what we need our families and our loved ones father we bless i pray or bless your people we thank you for our passing and special way the ministry

bless you tonight we love you thank you for being a wonderful audience and may god bless you
