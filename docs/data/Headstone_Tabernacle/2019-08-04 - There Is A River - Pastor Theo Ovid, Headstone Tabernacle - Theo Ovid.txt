straightest welcome this morning feel the anointing the finished presence this evening we have communion just want you to remember me in prayer tomorrow leave for Nigeria Benin before we do scriptures we had a real tremendous time in prayer meetin I wish all of you could have been there for the prayer meetin I just want to bring a few things back from the permiten that we had on friday with a powerful atmosphere and you who are praying you are who is holding up the church holding up this inspiration the one that are praying I'm sweating it out and so my god and the script reread was some second Kingstree 15 to 17 where Elijah was upset and the Oxford minstrel at the play and the minister I believe in the hand of the Lord came upon him and the spirit the music was able to bring him in an atmosphere so it's not just playing but the right kind of a plan in and that would bring atmosphere upon the Prophet or let's say this we bring it in the spirit so we appreciate by the Stephen this morning without song service right kind of singing atmosphere and this is brother Brenner he said they'll Heavenly Father we're happy tonight for the privilege of standing on this church and praying for the people we are tankful for your word Lord and I pray that you would send a revival that we are asking for and know Lord I'm asking you something personally myself please Heavenly Father put in the people's heart an expectation let them never forget that all down to the nights if we shall continue in meetin me remember tonight the expectant we come every night's scene well it never happened last night but it'll be expect me tomorrow night I'll be tomorrow night and I'll be the one I'll be the one that receive the Holy Ghost I'll be the first one at the altar to repent of my sins I'll be the first one that God sanctifies and takes all the world out of me Lord I'm a shame on my life I'm a shame of the way I've been doing I want you to take it away from me give me something so great Lord that I don't want to go back to that hog wallow again as the Bible said as the soul returned to of wallow and the doctors from it we can see Lord that many of our pinnacles of people are acting the same way come out of the world and going right back in it again God please let me not think Lord I'm trying to call them but merely trying to put the scripture in front of them that they're enough to walk over it Lord and push it aside to go any further and I pray the Lord every every person and myself all of us will take inventory of our lives and compare it with God's requirement granted father forgive us of our sins forgive us of our mistakes and our errors let the blood of Jesus sanctify the little church tonight or God may every person here get a touch of the Holy Spirit right away granted father let it come please do Lord starter revival right here in this city granted Lord make this church an example an example Church and let the people come from different paths and look in here and see the way their conduct is and hold it shut back from the things of the world and back into the real genuine Pentecostal path the genuine Pentecostal experience walking with you blameless granted Lord then other choices we'll see under it say well if that brother can have his church like that and all them people can be together and their hearts can be one then they cut the a mode for everyone and look how much difference there is in them Lord that they will hunger and kiss you said you are the salt of the earth God bring back the sour in the soil quickly or glory to God hallelujah praise God at a people might walk in the door and see the power of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus moving on people showing himself alive Oh glory to God hallelujah I'm almost finished here he's saying traveling I think is a great thing that I've seen missing in the church today one of the greatest hindrances in a church today that keep the revival back is the lack of godly love but Christ expressed when he was here on earth it is easy for you to love someone that loves us but what Jesus didn't have that kind of a love he had God's love and God love his enemies for God so loved the world when the world was unlovable God still loved the world Oprah is a different even in the expression of the words of filial and on a Kapo of divine love and if there's anything I believe listen listen visitors this look like simple there's no more big heart mystery that I just scratch ahead if there's anything that I believe that would start a revival Los Angeles would be a time that we could bring them all over different barriers and come together as Christians and love that's the pentecostal the Baptist the Presbyterian and all together we would Express to the world that we have love one for another and jesus prayed that prayer that we might have love one for another as he had loved us Oh glory to God amen hallelujah glory to God you believe that today let me close what I said no one could love like him you can't manufacture that kind of a love it's the gift of God that comes by the Holy Spirit the only way you will ever be able to have that love do I speak with tongues of men and angels I hope that kind of love oh my man please God oh I love him this morning you say what we need tonight is the water of God the vision absolutely interpreted God's will to a dying Persian people what did he like I said he said to look for Winn don't look for rain just dig ditches just in our world don't let his senses fool you blow but I don't mess with them senses because if you're looking for water expect rain or you expect when he said oh look for that just dig ditches and you go get water just take just take just take you you take the more to your gun just take don't use your eyes to lose your feelings don't lose your emotions they stink just make way for water or glory to God amen hallelujah praise God so this one could be Stan [Music] Villas with your paw [Music] of me welcome home [Music] the [Music] one more time welcome welcome welcome [Music] me [Music] [Music] god bless you and welcome this morning wanna turn to three portions of scriptures Ezekiel chapter 47 wanna read from 1 to 9 sons 46 ants in John chapter 7 1 every 37 to 39 Ezekiel 47 from verse 1 afterward he brought me again to the door of the house and behold waters issued out from under the treasure of the house eastward for the front for front of the house stood towards the east and the waters came down from under the right side of the house the south side of the altar then brought he out me out of the way of the gate not what and led me about the way without unto the utter gate by the way they look at eastward and behold their Ronald waters on the right side I went a man that had the line in his hand when fought eastward he measured a thousand cubits and he brought me through the waters and the waters were to the uncles again he measured a thousand he brought me through the waters the waters will to the knees again he measured a Towson and he brought me to the waters or to the loins and afterwards he measured a thousand it was a river that I could not pass over for the waters were risen waters to swim in a river that could not be passed over and he said unto me son of man has Duff seen this then he brought me and caused me to return to the brink of the river now when I had returned be whole at the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and the other density under me these waters shoot out towards the east country and go down to into the desert I'm going to the sea which bein brought forth into the sea the waters shall be healed and I shall come to pass that everything that liveth which move it whithersoever the river shall come shall live and there shall be a great multitude of fish because these waters come thither for they shall be healed and everything shot that live with it whether the river comment let's go for sounds 46 we didn't come for this one God is our refuge and strength a very present help in trouble therefore will be not Revere though the earth be removed though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea though the waters thereof roar and be troubled but a mountains shake with the swelling thereof Silla there is a river the streams whereof shall make glad the City of God the holy place of the Tabernacles of the Most High God is in the midst of her she shall not be moved God shall help her and that right early the hidden range the kingdoms were moved he uttered his voice that it melted the Lord of Hosts is with us the God of Jacob is our refuge come behold the works of the Lord what desolations he had made on the earth he maketh Wars to cease unto the end of the earth he breaketh the bow cutter dispensed under he Bernhard the chart in the fire be still I know that I am God I will be exalted among the hidden I will be exalted in the earth the Lord of Hosts is with us the core of Jacob is our refuge our last capture is from sin John chapter 7 reading from verse 37 familiar Scripture in the last day that great day of the feast Jesus stood and cried saying if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink he that believe on me as the scripture hath said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water but this spake he of the Spirit which did that believe on him should receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet given because that Jesus was not yet glorified let us pray one more time father we have read your word and God I need you to come and interpret these words to the people this morning take me out of the way Lord made a pillar far rest on my shoulder and me you speak lit the air speak out to your people by direct inspiration and revelation in Jesus name I ask it amen and amen before you have your sea just turn around and shake somebody's ass this morning maybe seats it's our title this morning there is a river does it have anyone have a question for you how you teach them are you tasty and can you swim and where are you planted hallelujah it's amazing what you know what why there was such a contrast in the scripture when he says here in sums 46 therefore shall be not fear though the earth be removed and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea though the waters roar and be troubled though the mountains shake with this well it means in the shaking times you have to know that there is a river that makes glad the City of God hallelujah praise God that's not a normal River you know that River began healing him that River have live in waters in it Oh glory to God that river is Living Waters you know anything that River touch will come alive what a river touch is gonna be here may that River begin to flow this morning I mean everybody thought your life this morning maybe you don't walk on here the same when you came this morning all glory to God amen let's read it but I said missing me and I really appreciate it when you see a servant of God get so sincere till he's on his face with his hands in the air praying to God and blushing because of the iniquity of the people then you're going to see a revival start a man cannot lay in the presence of God a church cannot stay in the presence of God under repentance unless the Holy Spirit come down and give unction and power to start a move of God among those people he said it's gotta be so the Holy Spirit has to start a move of God not a man move not a move of man but a move of God how many wonders see that how many want to see a move of God or glory to God Holly is a show me a man show me another Calvin knocks Feeny Sankey any one of those that feels the burden of the people that will lay on their face and cry and pray before God send us another judgment of the Baptist Church who prayed all night for the iniquity of the people until his eyes will be swell shut next morning from reaping til his wife would lead him to the table to feed him as breakfast out of a spoon show me a John Wesley again a fireman snatch from the fire I will show you a revival all glory to God hallelujah no a river is not a dead thing a river is not a lake a river is not a dead thing oh boy a river is a life a river have a beginning and I really have an outlet to go somewhere I River have a source and after Scott somewhere and what we read in Ezekiel it started from under the altar it's talking from right under cider there they'd have to start somewhere this revolve gonna have to start from somewhere and it going somewhere river goes towards the ocean or glory of God there's a lot of shock hallelujah praise God believer praise God this is the Prophet he said no I presume being that this is a Pentecostal sponsor that most in here pinnacles were people and there's way I trow my luck because I never did join any Pentecostal church no sitting nomination they can have whatever they want to but you'd order lines go don't take lightly God don't like lines built in his church reminds me of a fellow one time had some ducks he cut their wings so they couldn't fly out of the pen he had some ducks on one side and ducks on the other and water begin to come in and the first thing you know that water got higher and higher and the Ducks got together and that's what we need today let the waters go to risin and then the dogs get together you will see that we in the same water denominational buyers can be floated out just let the waters get deep enough or glory of God and I am puffy saying this morning okay or glory of God a waters gonna come so much that then just go have fellowship hallelujah praise God Oh hallelujah glory remember the Thompson you may be seated what are you saying preacher we gotta go deeper first it was water but we only receive Angell's hallelujah some people just have their paws in it yes depend on wet in the foot and then when they check again and I take our next measurement it was up to the knees or glory to God we're in the water just up to your knees when the next measurement was up to the waist Oh hallelujah but there is one more step there is one more praise God when that river began to flow he said it was so much water he had the water for swimming you couldn't wait through that one you couldn't walk through that one you couldn't get your toe in that one you have to swim in that one can you swim this morning because we coin million people or give the Lord a shout the waters gonna get high hallelujah glory to God is not normal waters this waters of healing it enough deliverance in it it's how great you in it boy you have the tree in it this is special waters our Lord is in the midst of ha ha going to help ha we are talking about the bride we are talking about you or plural of God hallelujah or praise God praise God hallelujah hallelujah so how deep do you wanna go uncle needy whiz deep I want what is this women ankle-deep is telling me what they know what they see here means good as ever cuz only what only hits in your uncle let's continue but a mom says when God gets a who loved a man the first thing he does in a church is to bring it from worldliness the holiness it bring is from death to life it's born again it's ideas are new what we need is a revival like that oh we had a tip of the spirit we had spiritual blessings and spiritual appraises but we don't need that no more we need a revival of the Spirit of the Living God in the hearts of the people we don't need so much tips of the spirit or spiritual awakened we need a revival a revival of what we got why are you preaching that because our people will judge with anger with temper with odds with heads with malice but even thinking and attitude bad spirited people but they commented church if your door say Amen I still talking about you you know [Music] let me sell again if you don't think a man is still you are talking to you know I hacked up to totally cap it is how I talk to the ceiling this is for you and who the cap fit where's it or give the Lord a shout in the house my god shame and somebody say Amen somebody we're gonna get a clean out all right let's continue we don't need much of tips of the spirit or spiritual awakened we need a revival we fight what we've got not a spiritual awakening sometimes that brings mixed multitude but we need a revival that will sift down shake out and cut out all the things hallelujah stand in puerto rico few weeks ago i when i see the great sea and a great storm the waves were higher than this tabernacle and i said you know what it hasn't got one more drop of water in it when it's perfectly calm but what does the chain in under jump in what does it mean a troll or the trash out upon the bank that is what the church needs it is a revival not a revival of specialist not a resigner singing not a revivalist inspiration not that but the revival avoids the rush of the church specials good inspiration could but this is something other than that [Applause] or glory to God hallelujah we don't wanna underwater revival that's what Luther had or glory to God we don't want no knee-high revival that's what Wesley had we don't wanna waste revival that's what the Pentecostal had we won water to swimmin that's what the prophet had or get the Lord a show and what a church means is a revival to shake from it all the wilderness on the things of the world and bring my purity and holiness of God in the hearts of its believers humility as a powerful word humility when I say that word call humility everybody somebody what is some big somebody with humbling itself humble what with what what name that see but when man shoots himself they don't get a revival once in a while on their spirit okay when they don't get a revival once in a while on their spirit they become so Colonel I'm so indifferent till they get self-styled starchy and self-righteous let me say it again so you get good now I'm hitting you good you know so you understand what we see in here good that when that revival spirit is no longer there people go to church by the natural they couldn't change but they can huh they could a church but the statue they could achieve but the self righteous teachers everybody some stay home right now watching us and they judging us they're not even in the word don't forsake the assembly yourself together but they're judging us I can't judge them because I see the new house but they're looking in my bedroom here or get the Lord I shall do what I said yes I'm talking to you I'm talking directly to you yeah I'm looking at them straight straight from the internet world or give the Lord a praise hallelujah praise God you think is bothering anybody my headquarters and sauces I'm caught I don't care what people think I want people feel

God hallelujah hallelujah glory amen we doing good hallelujah hallelujah all right I'm sorry don't you change bomb says be what full of strange things which we mean that eraser die if I'm not from that works perfectly for god I wish it could have been said that this addition age was the restoration instead of Reformation he said um I kind of see that the word does not call it restoration but certainly caused it Reformation had it been restoration the age would have been another Pentecost of each but it was not the best that could be said striking that which remains is ready to die there was something missing yes certainly was this age was justification but it had missed sanctification and the baptism already goes that is what God's original plan was that was what that is what they had a Pentagon they were justified they were sanctified they were filled with holy goes why listen to me the reason for being justified and sanctified is to the end that she might be baptized with the Holy Ghost that is the reason there is a church it is a temple of God sing with God even the Holy Ghost the same spirit I was in Jesus while he was on earth causing him to do the mighty works which he did back in the church at Pentecost so that they did the work that he did this aged did not have those works they had the written word but not the revealed word this was the Reformation was going to be start of it he was going to according to promise take the Tisch back from the depths of Satan in the dark ages after the depths of God that had a Pentecost and which was a few years before now be careful get this it says in this second verse and I read if I have not found thy works perfect for God do you know what the mean of not perfect radiance it is unfulfilled so he put his magnifying glass not perfect it means unfulfilled this age was an unfulfilled age it was just started to get him back and that is why I said the biota calling Reformation not restoration is a static in the doctrine of justification with men salvation was all of God now Luther preaches sovereignty of God and election he knew it was all Greece he separated a church from the rule by a classical Nawrocki he taught on either he cast all confessions to the pre he's amongst the people was wonderful God had 1,500 years before luta you're gonna start things your age receipt are all unfulfilled I'm leaving that talita he knows the end from the beginning luta was his messenger it didn't look like it as we examined the floors so luta had flow and if you want to see floors you can see plenty with lutein and because he with me and everybody else do is what you want to look at are you i first continued on but it was a man called Jonah he had flaws in his life too he was a prophet door you might not want to see sue on the basis of how he acted but God knows them that are his and he has his way just as David Jonah he had his way with Luton that day and he will have his way until the consummation or Co became the Lord's Grace offering now let's look at the next step logically we think is the actual foreman and harvesting of the green the completed cycles but not sue there's another stage and that stage is when the husk or chaff is formed to cover the seed and that is exactly what happened a spiritual cycle at the turn of the 20th century in the start of the larissa age there was a widespread belief that the Holy Ghost was fallen exactly as I did at Pentecost people were talking in tongues and claiming to be baptized it already goes with evidence of speaking in tongues but I've walked to the grain fields many a times and here in summer block the heads of wheat rubbed them in my hand they get some green and to my surprise there wasn't any corner within that chef's dough indeed it looked as if weak whatever this is a perfect picture of this so-called Pentecostal move now here we go just want to get to and this is a proven fact is found in these people organized on a doctrine and bound themselves he that is were here people go off when they pinned on their doctrine and say you have to be fit like this I mean nail it down like a thesis I hung it up and unless you leave it like that you're not brothers Pharisees are the things are resisting here it is just found boss auditing so then he was a he was recognizes as far as they concerned and people had a busted out from them and he had a whole following I went him cumbersome he bust them to eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no life so they I'm getting licked solar room because God want the would
