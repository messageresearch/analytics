[29:33] wrong if the devil is not doing a good
[29:35] job God he always has been doing a great
[29:38] job all these years and God has always
[29:39] been doing a great job himself because

[30:08] start Hallelujah tell my wife something
[30:11] you know that's something I read about
[30:14] people love mediocrity because it makes
[30:17] them feel comfortable it doesn't
[30:20] challenge them to exceed and Excel so
[30:23] when you hear the call to Perfection it
[30:26] means you can stay where you are

[30:30] you bigger than you something that you
[30:33] could Aspire onto and that's what where
[30:37] standards come and and Perfection and
[30:39] pressing on and overcoming and and and
[30:42] getting out your comfort zone people
[30:44] like to stay in their comfort zone and
[30:46] that is where you are in the humanistic
[30:48] realm where you know there's no pressure

[36:10] God just a note if you have your cell
[36:12] phone just make
[36:13] sure it's
[36:17] off Ecclesiastes chapter
[36:21] 3 verse one to everything there's a
[36:23] season and a time to every purpose under
[36:26] the heaven Hallelujah time to be born
[36:29] time to die time to plant time to pluck
[36:32] up that which is planted A Time to Kill
[36:34] a time to heal a time to break down a
[36:38] time to build up a time to weep and a
[36:41] time to laugh amen a time to mourn and a
[36:44] time to dance Ezekiel chapter 9 reading
[36:48] from verse 6 from verse
[36:54] one he cried also in my ears the Lord
[36:58] voice saying cause them to draw charge
[37:00] over the city to draw near every man
[37:03] with his destroying weapon in his hand
[37:06] and behold six men came from the way of
[37:07] the higher gate which lied towards the
[37:10] North and every man slowed a weapon in
[37:13] his hand one man among them was clothed
[37:15] with linen with a wrers ink on by his
[37:18] side and they went in and Stood Beside
[37:20] the Brazen Altar and the glory of the
[37:22] god of Israel was going up from the
[37:23] Cherub whereupon he was to the threshold
[37:25] of the house and he called to the the
[37:27] man clothed with linen which had the
[37:29] writer's incor by his side and the Lord
[37:32] said unto him go through the midst of
[37:34] the city through the midst of
[37:37] Jerusalem and set a mark upon the
[37:40] foreheads of the men that sigh and that
[37:42] cry for all the Abomination that be done
[37:45] in the midst thereof and the others he
[37:48] said in mine hearing go ye after him
[37:52] through the city and smite let not your
[37:54] eyes spear neither have you pity slay
[37:57] utterly old young both mids little
[37:59] children and woman and come not near any
[38:02] man upon whom is the mark and begin at
[38:06] My Sanctuary then they began at the
[38:10] ancient men which were before the
[38:12] house Revelation chap 10 reading from
[38:15] verse one and I
[38:17] saw another Mighty Angel come down from
[38:21] heaven clo with a cloud and a rainbow
[38:24] was upon his head his face as it were
[38:27] the son his feet as pillars of fire he
[38:30] had in his hand a little book open he
[38:33] set his right foot upon the sea his left
[38:35] foot on the earth cry with a loud voice
[38:38] as when a lion roar it when he had cried
[38:41] seven Thunders uttered the voices and
[38:43] when the seven Thunders UT the voices I
[38:45] was about to write and I Heard a Voice
[38:47] from Heaven saying unto me seal up those
[38:49] things which the seven Thunders uted and
[38:50] write them not and the angel which I saw
[38:54] stand upon the sea and upon the Earth
[38:56] lifted up his hand to heaven and swear
[38:58] by him who live forever and ever who
[39:00] created heaven and the things that
[39:02] therein are and the earth and the things
[39:04] that are therein are and the see and the
[39:06] things which are therein that there
[39:07] should be time no longer but in the days
[39:10] of the voice of the seventh angel when
[39:12] he shall begin to song The Mystery of
[39:14] God should be finished as he had
[39:16] declared to his servants the prophets
[39:18] let's pray father we thank you for your
[39:19] word inspired to our hearts you know
[39:21] what you put upon my spirit and in my
[39:23] heart today speak to our hearts in Jesus
[39:25] name we ask it amen you may be seated
[39:32] hallelujah hallelujah
[39:38] bless praise
[39:40] God other title it been song very
[39:44] strange but this is what come to my
[39:47] heart tonight and the title is changing
[39:52] of
[39:54] time changing of
[39:58] time and I have an
[40:00] inspiration time of
[40:03] sealing time of
[40:06] judgment another context scripture from
[40:09] Daniel 12:8 and9 when the Lord was
[40:12] opening up the end time to
[40:15] Daniel Daniel said I heard but I
[40:19] understood not then said I oh my Lord
[40:24] what shall be the end of these things
[40:28] and he said go thy Way Daniel for the
[40:31] words are closed up and
[40:36] sealed till the time of the End Amen the
[40:42] words are sealed till the time of the
[40:51] end watch that word time of the end but
[40:57] when that Mighty angel came down and
[40:59] swore he said time no longer amen time
[41:03] of the end and the end of time is not
[41:06] the same thing it come like if you're
[41:09] preparing for Christmas and you have a
[41:10] turkey and you have a a chicken and you
[41:12] have it and you want to kill it or
[41:13] whatnot you get it and you put it in the
[41:16] cage that's the time of the end but when
[41:18] you cut his head off that's the end of
[41:20] time for that turkey or that chicken so
[41:24] the time of the end look like a span of
[41:27] time and in that span of time a lot of
[41:30] things have to
[41:32] unfold people would mock it people would
[41:34] laugh at it because they said how long
[41:36] is this time of the end and time of the
[41:38] end but it's the
[41:40] time of the
[41:42] end I don't know how much you have
[41:44] stores with timers in it and that came
[41:47] to me very
[41:48] simply there's a switch for timer and
[41:51] switch for the clock the clock is the
[41:54] time if you're not cooking you just seen
[41:57] the time there but if you're going to do
[42:00] something and you need to put that timer
[42:02] on when you switch it time begins to
[42:05] count it's a countdown where there's
[42:09] something baking in the oven it's a
[42:10] countdown and that is what I saying
[42:14] tonight a changing of time it's as if
[42:18] God pressed the Tim up and they going to
[42:21] come down now and when God press that
[42:24] timer Nothing Stops it amen not to
[42:27] changes it Hallelujah glory to God so we
[42:33] about to moveing a changing of time I
[42:36] have another context scripture from
[42:37] Revelation chapter 7 after these things
[42:39] I saw four Angels standing on the four
[42:42] corners of the Earth holding the Four
[42:44] Winds of the earth that the wind should
[42:46] not blow on the earth nor the sea nor on
[42:48] any
[42:50] tree we know what that was four angels
[42:53] that was interpreted to us came and
[42:55] stopped World War I that's World War II
[42:58] and it was pressing towards a World War
[43:00] II but it had to stop because the Angels
[43:03] were T to stop the Ws amen isn't that
[43:06] right but I saw another
[43:09] Angel ascending from the East having the
[43:13] seed of the Living God and he cried with
[43:16] a loud voice to the four angels to whom
[43:18] it was given to H the earth and the Sea
[43:19] saying hurt not the Earth neither the
[43:21] sea nor the trees till we have sealed
[43:24] the Servants of our God in their
[43:25] foreheads amen
[43:27] Hallelujah and I heard the number of
[43:30] them that were sealed now that was the
[43:33] Jews
[43:34] 144,000 but before they are sealed
[43:38] there's a gentile bride to be sealed
[43:41] amen you can't go in without being
[43:48] sealed hallelujah oh hallelujah
[43:51] hallelujah we can't make it without
[43:54] being sealed Hallelujah the Jews were
[43:57] blinded that we can
[44:00] see they were blinded that we
[44:03] could be covered with the robe of God's
[44:11] Grace So before God go back to the Jews
[44:14] you have to finish with the Gentiles and
[44:17] to finish the Gentiles it has to be the
[44:19] finishing of the seventh seal that's
[44:24] right you may be seated HJ the sick seal
[44:28] is Judgment every age was bted under a
[44:31] seal that's right as it was Hallelujah
[44:34] you are under a seal where you must be
[44:37] sealed Hallelujah the six seal is
[44:40] judgment to be cast onto the Earth amen
[44:44] and in Ezekiel chapter 9 Angels came
[44:47] with a commission to destroy young and
[44:50] old woman children but amidst those
[44:54] angels there was a man Hallelujah with
[44:57] with a inkor writer to put a mark to put
[45:01] a seal to put something upon those that
[45:06] sing and crying and burning and groaning
[45:11] not the sleeping not the am man you're
[45:15] tired and you're weary and you want to
[45:16] give up you can't afford to be tired we
[45:20] to close to the Finishing
[45:22] Line come on say Amen
[45:25] somebody Hallelujah
[45:28] Daniel seeking the Lord from off the
[45:32] words of Jeremiah the prophet amen God
[45:35] sent an angel dispatched to Daniel begin
[45:39] to reveal Mysteries to him and Daniel
[45:42] couldn't catch it because it wasn't the
[45:45] season and time he said go th Way Daniel
[45:48] the book is sealed that's right till the
[45:50] time of the end so anytime that book
[45:53] begin to unfold it's the time of the end
[45:57] going towards the end of time because
[46:00] when that seal breaks the angel come and
[46:02] said time shall be no more time itself
[46:05] is going to end we are breaking into
[46:08] eternity do you know you don't belong
[46:11] here oh glory to
[46:14] God listen time is only a break of
[46:19] Eternity we come from God and we're
[46:22] going back to God you with him before
[46:25] the foundation of the world
[46:27] you come from eternity this world is not
[46:31] your
[46:37] own may
[46:39] see you're fighting to live right and
[46:42] you're living to die putting the energy
[46:45] into what what you putting the energy
[46:47] and effort into what would it count oh
[46:52] hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the
[46:54] Lord hallelujah watch notice from the
[46:57] seven
[46:58] seal here we go for the end time
[47:03] message this
[47:06] seal after he read all the six seals and
[47:10] says nothing about the sevenant the end
[47:13] time seal which is the seventh when it
[47:19] starts when it starts it will be a total
[47:24] secret when it starts amen amen
[47:27] hallelujah in other words nobody could
[47:30] pin down it start here it start here
[47:31] when it starts is a
[47:33] secret but he speaks about the
[47:36] finishing of that seventh seal so it's
[47:39] going to
[47:40] start and it's going to finish because
[47:43] Ezekiel eastes tell us to everything
[47:46] under Heaven There is a
[47:49] season and there is a time to everything
[47:53] under Heaven a time to plant a time to
[47:56] to pluck up that which is planted a time
[47:59] to SW a time to reap I would say that a
[48:02] time to seal and a time to
[48:05] [Applause]
[48:06] judge Oh
[48:08] Glory when God was about to judge Sodom
[48:12] he couldn't hold back unfolding the
[48:15] revelation of what he was going to do
[48:18] because Abraham represented the bride
[48:21] elect of that day so God said shall I
[48:24] hide from Abraham what I'm about to do
[48:27] he couldn't hold back those seals from
[48:29] Abraham so God be to break the seals to
[48:33] Abraham that Sodom was

[56:24] heart you may be SE you could choose to
[56:27] forgive or you could choose to hate you
[56:29] could choose to drop your stuff or you
[56:31] could choose to hold your hearts you
[56:33] could choose to break out and give God a
[56:36] shout in the house or you could D mop in
[56:39] your circumstance that's up to
[56:43] [Applause]
[56:52] you Hallelujah
[56:58] Hallelujah from SS in prison he says see
[57:01] the names are on the book of life he had
[57:04] to stand there because it was God's
[57:06] purpose to redeem them their names were
[57:09] put on the Lamb's Book of Life before
[57:13] the foundation of the world and the lamb
[57:16] who was slain which was Jesus had to
[57:18] stay and make
[57:20] intercession isn't that right because
[57:23] what the church was predestinated to be
[57:25] without spot or wrinkle she is going to
[57:27] be there and the lamb died for that
[57:30] purpose and then when the last name on
[57:33] that book was redeemed the lamb came
[57:36] forth and took the book so we always say
[57:38] it like that you're going to buy
[57:39] furniture you make your payment in
[57:41] courts you pay for the furniture but you
[57:43] have to go and pick it up you have the
[57:46] receipt but this is what Redemption is
[57:48] like the lamb already paid the price he
[57:51] just said pick it up
[57:55] yet don't think you got that you pay for
[57:58] the furniture but it's still in the
[57:59] store you have the receipt you have the
[58:02] title you have the evidence of
[58:07] purchase and his blood was the evidence
[58:09] of
[58:10] purchase so therefore everybody supposed
[58:12] to loose their faith because you didn't
[58:14] redeem yourself you can a clean thing a
[58:17] unclean come from a unan a clean come
[58:19] from unclean we came from unclean it
[58:22] took his blood to clean us
[58:24] up we were born in
[58:28] sin so you can't sit here like some
[58:31] self-righteous somebody we were
[58:34] born in sin and all have sin not some
[58:40] and come short of the glory so don't sit
[58:43] there like you are Pope
[58:45] Francis thinking he is above everybody
[58:48] else don't sit there like that
[58:51] Hallelujah you are saved by the grace
[58:54] and by the blood but your name was in
[58:57] the

[1:02:27] word to reconnect you so in every age
[1:02:29] there was a word to make the connection
[1:02:32] and the devil couldn't understand that
[1:02:33] Myster how the gospel could be preached
[1:02:36] and you get connected with the word a
[1:02:38] word in season a word in due season
[1:02:42] every age had a message every age had a
[1:02:44] word every age had a messenger every age
[1:02:47] had a people to receive that word and
[1:02:50] when they got that word they became
[1:02:52] manifested word manifested Sons how the
[1:02:56] sons of God but in that this last day we
[1:02:59] get all the word of all the ages because
[1:03:03] this age is to produce the manifestation
[1:03:06] of the sons of
[1:03:08] [Applause]

[1:04:51] is closed this angel came in with a
[1:04:53] mighty book with a book open Hallelujah

[1:14:58] time first God had to put a Mark that
[1:15:02] Mark is signing you off for a
[1:15:07] manifestation you hear what I said you
[1:15:10] are being marked to be properly
[1:15:14] sealed and people are being marked to be

[1:15:20] where the Bible said him that is filthy
[1:15:22] is filthy still him that is righteous is
[1:15:24] righteous still him that is Holy Holy
[1:15:26] still there come an hour when you cannot

[1:15:47] changed that time everything is
[1:15:50] set judgment is set that Prophet went up
[1:15:54] in the spirit
[1:15:55] went into vision and saw Los Angeles
[1:15:59] sink he saw it that's what make a
[1:16:02] prophets prophesy they have to see it
[1:16:05] God show them by Vision as far as God is
[1:16:08] concerned it is sunk
[1:16:10] already because he has the future as the
[1:16:16] past in our Dimension we have past
[1:16:20] present and future but in God's
[1:16:22] Dimension all is present
[1:16:25] your present is present your past is
[1:16:27] also present your future is always
[1:16:29] present that he can predestinate and
[1:16:31] make all things to work together for
[1:16:34] good to them that love
[1:16:38] [Applause]
[1:16:46] God so God is not worried when Moses ran
[1:16:49] away from Egypt go I f up boy God take
[1:16:54] my surprised I thought he was going to
[1:16:56] stand
[1:16:57] up no God expect the man to run to be
[1:17:02] stripped of himself and of his crown and
[1:17:06] of his who ear and Moses and all the
[1:17:08] breeze he getting from all them feathers
[1:17:11] him all the grapes and apples to
[1:17:13] presented to him he tried something and
[1:17:16] failed and God listen wanted him to fail
[1:17:20] Amen to let him know it going to not be
[1:17:22] his strength or might or power
[1:17:25] Hallelujah that's why sometime God allow

[1:28:31] bride body called The
[1:28:33] Church hallelujah praise God are you
[1:28:36] with me oh glory to God watch Revelation

[1:28:45] great thing to happen everything runs
[1:28:47] out in this time it's the end of the
[1:28:49] seventh seal and here what he compare it
[1:28:52] to but this is what they do with firew
[1:28:54] Works watch it's like fin a rocket in
[1:28:57] the air that rocket explodes and goes up
[1:29:00] it explodes again it puts out five stars
[1:29:03] and one of those five stars explodes and
[1:29:05] blows out five star from it and then
[1:29:06] them stars explode and keep exploding
[1:29:08] it's almost like a timer you he they
[1:29:10] start to make the noise already Rockets
[1:29:12] going up in the air and it exploded and
[1:29:14] people woo
[1:29:16] lights it's a new year happy New Year
[1:29:20] that's how the seventh going to be it
[1:29:22] starts off it begin to explode five
[1:29:25] stars and each star put out five stars
[1:29:27] and it's start to do like that as the
[1:29:29] spirit of God go across the world and
[1:29:32] pick up every predestinated
[1:29:34] seed
[1:29:35] Hallelujah glory to God Amen let's

[1:29:41] speaks the word I've got many things to
[1:29:43] tell you you cannot understand it now
[1:29:45] and when he comes he'll guide you to it
[1:29:47] and that's the reason the coming of the
[1:29:48] seals at the finishing of the seventh
[1:29:51] seal the mystery of God should be f
[1:29:54] finish to know who God is what he is how
[1:29:57] he lives his nature his being you're
[1:30:00] supposed to be all the way up there by
[1:30:02] that time to bring us into the full
[1:30:04] stature of the sons of God as Daniel
[1:30:07] heard the seven Thunders and forbidden
[1:30:09] John heard the voices this book was
[1:30:11] sealed and the back of the book was
[1:30:13] sealed with Seven Seals but in the days
[1:30:15] of these seals to be open the mystery of
[1:30:17] God will be finish in other words God
[1:30:20] would be known to his church not in
[1:30:22] three people but as one person the
[1:30:24] mystery of God will be revealed and
[1:30:27] listen and when that was completely
[1:30:29] revealed then the seven Mysteries would
[1:30:32] open to the church because in there the
[1:30:34] church would be living under the
[1:30:36] inspiration of the Holy Spirit him
[1:30:38] moving in and out showing him signs of
[1:30:41] being alive living among us and then we

[1:45:30] would be hard as rock as they Ponder
[1:45:32] what was said and come to the
[1:45:34] realization that they have to make
[1:45:36] things right Lord if there's someone
[1:45:38] here tonight father who has been down
[1:45:40] depressed just holding on May they be
[1:45:43] encouraged in such a way that they know
[1:45:45] there's more for them than against them
[1:45:47] and he who started the work is more than
[1:45:49] able to bring it to completion father
[1:45:52] Lord we thank thank you that we are sons
[1:45:54] of God Daughters of God from that God
[1:45:57] class father we are different from Lord
[1:45:59] the world and the things of the world
[1:46:01] because we are not from here we come
[1:46:03] from God and we're going back to God
[1:46:05] lord and as we leave this house but not
[1:46:07] leave your presence father may you burn
[1:46:10] within our souls Lord a deep and
[1:46:13] desperate desire to please you lord your
[1:46:15] Prophet taught us that a man could only
[1:46:17] get desperate when God speaks to Him
[1:46:20] Father May the words that were said
[1:46:22] tonight father continue to stir in us
[1:46:24] and bring such a desperation for the
[1:46:26] baptism of the Holy Ghost Lord that Lord
[1:46:29] the minister would not be able to
[1:46:31] minister on Sunday Lord but Lord the
[1:46:33] Holy Ghost would be all over their
[1:46:35] building father put such a Zeal a
