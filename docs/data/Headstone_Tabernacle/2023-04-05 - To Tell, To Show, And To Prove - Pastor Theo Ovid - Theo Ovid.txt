[Music] with a prayer Heavenly Father we thank you forgotten to get guiding us together and I pray that it will be a form of just coming and doing this Wednesday and Sunday but I pray that it'll be a Consciousness and awareness that we are here to worship the Living God we're here to acknowledge your presence father I want to thank you to be here oh God even tonight bless your word bless your people as we approach you and wait upon you in Jesus amen I want to thank you all for your prayer I wasn't feeling well over this weekend and um I'll still be here on Sunday to take the Sunday morning and evening service but of course Knows Best of course knows all things so tonight we're here by the grace of God and if you have your Bibles return to two portion of scripture one from Isaiah 53 and when we want to read the whole chapter 1 to 12 and Rule to Romans 8 11 to 14. really appreciate brother Isaac sign a gap the cries of the Watchmen amen that's what I like to see soldiers there's two people three people three persons and you could stand there and Minister the word of God whatever condition it is and but again I still can't get over that what's your excuse that could ring over and over to every situation what is your excuse it all depends right all right so reading Isaiah 53 who had believer report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant as the root of the out of dry ground he had no form no communist when we shall see him there's no beauty that we should desire him what's your excuse he is despise what is your excuse rejected of men amount of Sorrows what is your excuse me with grief and we hid as it were or thesis on him he was his spy he's going to be esteem him not surely you're born all griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did as Steam him straight and smitten smitten of God and Afflicted but he was wounded for our transgression he was bruised for our iniquities and the chastisement of our peace was upon him I would have strikes we are healed all we like sheep have gone on a street we have turned everyone to his own way and the Lord that lead on him the iniquity of us all he was oppressed he was afflicted what's your excuse yeah he opened up his mouth he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter as a sheep before he shares his dumb so you open up his mouth he was taken from prison and from judgment who had declared his generation for he was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of all my people's body straightened now we are reading this but this was prophecy at that time in Isaiah 53. verse 9 and he made his grave with the wicked and with the rich in his debt because he had done no violence you know it wasn't any seat in his mouth yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him what's our excuse he had put him to grief when thou shall make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hands he shall see all the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many for he shall bear the iniquities therefore will I divide him a portion with the greed he shall divide the spoil with the strong because he had poured out his soul unto death and he was numbered by the transgressors and he beared the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressions Romans 8 verse 11-14 but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you if he that raised it up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwell into you so that gives all the answers right there therefore brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh for if we live after the flesh you shall die but if you true the spirit of ye to the spirit do mortified the Deeds of the body you shall live for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God let's pray one more time father we thank you for your word read the scriptures Lord may you come and breathe life into it and open up the word to us tonight oh praise the name of the Lord it's good to be in the house of God I always say that it's a privilege to be here and I believe that and Sunday was something just uh understanding that we can't take things for granted we could want to be here and things didn't work on for us to be here so it's a privilege when we get common house of God raise our hands they've got praise amen you don't know when God will call somebody's number and you have the answer to that call who praise the name of the Lord so tonight I have a title to tell to show and to prove that's what I would like to tell to show and to prove Hallelujah let's go so you know but around described this week as the greatest week and it is he said um because Easter he said notice the very okay I'll skip that there when he proved by his promise this great conquering power he had on Easter prove he could conquer the cell in the grave you see many men have died so the debt is not as as powerful as the actual Resurrection many men have died great men and so on but but Easter proved something his resurrection proves something that we have and you will see tonight access the stuff that others don't have access to because of this Resurrection Hallelujah and he called us not just to tell but to show unto proof that he's raised from the dead that is the real gospel we tell there's only one thought but we have to prove we have to show and prove that is the real essence of the Gospel we miss the market we don't get there our objective is to get there now we can prove what we're talking about that's what brother Brahman did he proved what he's talking about he can approve in India everywhere he go he can approved what he is talking about it wasn't it's more an explanation it was a literal manifestation a Vindication of a Son of God placed here by Power by your spirit working in and through him oh praise the Lord tonight and buy untrue the bride who will be fulfilled all how high and true Oh Glory desired message myself buy unto the bride will be fulfill Hall o glory to God if you are not the bride nothing fulfilling through you nothing working through you you'll have to look for nothing but if you're under expectation to be part of this bright body you have to believe tonight that is going to work through you and by you okay the Lord some Praises if you believe you are part of this bright body you are the second there and actually believe it's gonna work by you and through you oh give the Lord a shout tonight that's why I'm here tonight to let you know these things buying through the brine oh praise the name of the Lord so he's the proof he can conquer death hell on the grave nobody can ever testimony for that before man died joburg he shall live again there was no witness coming back to have a testimony of what happened beyond the grave but he's to prove that isn't that right and I think that God Hasting the day okay I'll skip a little bit he proved by his promise all right he said I am he oh God that was dead and is alive again and a life forever more and have the keys of death hell and the grief I am that man not Buddha not Krishna no other man I am that man praise God I am that man not Kung Fu well I foreign [Applause] challenge you tonight I have the keys of death and Hell Oh Glory to God no wonder why the songwriter said death had no power over the blood wash ones oh give the Lord some Praises glory to God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Glory my God what a statement for anyone to make not only did he make it but he had proved that he what he had claimed to have and I think God he's in the day when we as Christians who believe the Bible can prove what we are talking about oh praise God I love this tonight I love the another track and there are no book and play no tape and play no code that's not that you know this is proven what you have praise God hallelujah put up or shut up or give the Lord a praise offering Give the Lord a shout in the house put up or shut up that overcoming you know rag Jam in time shut the mouth of the critics take a whole rug and push it anymore they can't say nothing because of manifestation will be the interpretation we'll give the Lord some Praises I'm excited about this message I'm excited about God's and a prophet not just a voice and a prophet but the prophecy or give the Lord a shout in the house I had to say course in a prophet God said a prophet what did he prophesy what did he say would be here what must be identify how could we say this is that that the prophet William Branham speak of we'll get along of the children back to the faith of the fathers good Lord hallelujah way feeling good tonight you should have see me Sunday morning could he raise my voice oh I speaking of Whispers designs devil is a liar you're always a liar every time you open this monk praise God I will stand and take up my watch and see what the Lord will speak to me and what I will answer oh glory to God I will stand on my tower I will stand on my poster Duty and do what has to be done Oh Glory there's a bride in Trinidad you better believe that praise God there's a bride on the earth there's nothing right when we as Christians who believe the Bible this Bible can prove what we're talking about I like that believe the Bible Bible believing Christians people know everybody messes but they know the Bible see there are no fundamental scriptures to identify because this Bible is all absolute not the message you know the Bible the Bible is the absolute that's that's that that's correct you know the Bible is the Absolution don't let nobody lie to you the Bible is the absolute that's why they have the reveal word they have to reveal the word the angel come to reveal the word that's why when the prophet hear from the angel you have to go back in the Bible to see if the angel talk about the Bible say because the angel is saying where that box is yeah the center Asia go away look at the Lord some Praises we have an absolute it's the scriptures Oh Glory the God he was here before William Branham was born it was here before Paul and I realized it was here it's the spirit of God wrote that word and the word itself is God tonight and the secret is the world is end up give the Lord some Praises tonight the bird is in that bread is rocking in that bride hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Moses ran away but the word was in Moses more no hardest problems but it was but Moses Noah all of them part of God Pastor God's Gene path of God's thoughts is that right all right now what she has done oh here it is that's what makes as I said a while ago the salt of the earth the citizen said the world is looking for this salt and when we can prove by our lives and by the Bible that our lives are vindicating the word living today that's the day we're looking for could you imagine the world become flesh in you you start to live the word and people reading spoken books and they're not reading you no all they have is text and Jesus caught them with that he caught them with Moses texts and the prophecy of the Prophet Moses and when he started to live it they had problems Moses the old man you said before Iman was I am you had to drop some Mysteries upon them living Mysteries with no explanation he says he's a flesh Prophet that nothing is a spirit that quickness just intellectually there's dry scribe and Pharisees quoting scriptures and texts and quotes and playing tapes but when that Living Word say which one among you without sin cast the first stone they all walk aways and nearly I condemn thee what was that the Living Word Healing The Living Word delivering the Living Word baptizing The Living Word Redeeming the Living Word setting people free to reliving word breaking the bands of wickedness The Living Word open up the prison bars you're going to see The Living Word all over again that word will become flesh one more time in Trinidad and the invisible will become visible in Trinidad okay the Lord some Praises Oh Glory to God other savior Trinidad has evidence Church all right here we go now rumors eight right but a brown if this spirit that raise up Jesus Christ be in you it will also Quicken your mortal bodies so when we talk about rapture this is no guesting is there no flukes who says right here if this spirit the same spirit so he's not talking about Luther and Wesleyan and Pentecostals no same note same mother birth the same the person of Christ his spirit seven parts the same dwelling you that Spirit In You would Quicken your mortal body so when we talk about the Raptor is internal it is watch this now if this Spirit would raise up Jesus Christ being you will also Quicken your mortal bodies not only did he prove to him to us that he was your Redeemer and up over death hell in the grave but he has also are you ready give us the access to The Same Spirit season access denied but you sons and daughters have solid access to the same spirit that we ourselves yeah he's going deeper can have the assurance that we too are quickened by that spirit for the spirit that raised up Jesus on the dead dwells in your body so he's not talking about you know I wonder if somebody say maybe then we think a company tell me but over here adopted but he didn't do it yet what kind of nonsense is that that is foolishness that is total ignorance that is intellectual stupidity hear what he's saying here now he says we ourselves I know somebody's saying yeah but over I see a light over you therefore you adopted I know that you talk in your talk I didn't see it you see that go tell you that he said you will have the assurance that you are quickened by that spirit you having the Assurance Blessed assurance Jesus is mine it will also Quicken your mortal body now here we go the word Quicken means not what they say in Trinidad you gotta take what they would explain it the word quick means to be made alive after death not jumping jumping jumping you're quick and quicker than that you're dead it's like a lost equipment not that kind of quicker means that we made a life after that after it is dead it's to be quickened so do you see how we have to die in other words if Christ didn't go down to the Grave if Christ didn't die there's no Resurrection it took debt to produce a resurrection it took the death of a corner wheat to produce a Resurrection Life unfold into Luther and Wesley there's a history of the seven churches is the history of the sea life that unfolded after death after the seed went down into the ground the life unfolded produced a stalk and a tassel and everything else and a shock and then the seed it come down to you then you have to take your seed and die and that's what it says about there is no Sunday without Friday Oh Glory to God there is no Sunday without Friday Friday mid Sunday Possible Oh Glory to God in our Sunday broke the wanderings of what happened on Saturday Oh Glory to God hallelujah praise God Friday didn't know he died but they wondered what happened on Saturday but Sunday morning and so all of that I am he that was dead and alive ever more go tell my disciples I am in a message don't tell them the Thunders are dead the Thunder's still alive Oh Glory the body is on New York Times from Christ's own mouth okay the Lord I shout praise God praise God oh give the Lord our son we are leaving them you know this is the seventh on the church okay there's Christ Ministry we have following John you know be following Jesus because billion prime numbers called to introduce the Messiah and the Messiah came down in Revelation 10 1 with the book open and seven thunderstorming voices out that's what made you different from every other group in a message oh every other brother every believer everybody else in the message because seven Tenants come together to break together they're sure about how to prepare and to tell them by faith for translation oh faith for body change oh give the Lord some Praises hate to be quickened by that same spirit that means Christ on the Dead spirit if the Lord I shout do you understand now why the prophet said this being when it's completed is the servant of God in the Church of God that's going in Rapture do you understand why he said that [Applause] [Music] Glory so brother Branham was fighting to get that same spirit back in the church they're going to bring Luther with a part portion Wesley on top of that then the Pentecost with the bird and then he'll bring the word because I take the word to be the channel of D spirit so you have to go and find the wood from Seven Ages that the seven spirits of God that was working through Seven Ages could come back in the church as seven voices thunders of God turning and sweetness and Holiness and Purity undefined lies walking around without our blemished that's the turn I will shake the devil and Shake him in every age it will give them good times in this age he could shake him and rock him in this age the sick is going to be healed the Bible is gonna see the death is gonna hear the death is going to be raised up by a living Christ in the church in the bright Church of Jesus Christ [Applause] [Music] thickened hello what about him Jesus said go therefore and teach All Nations and prove to them by demonstrating the power of God to them these signs shall follow them that believe them who promise and say they believe he give us a definite different understanding of it Prophet tip and the world what the prophet do and say God sent a prophet to look nice at the light over your head Jesus said not Prophet said not brother to you're saying this is a change now these signs shall follow them not Precision of them who's them you're part of them he's talking about them that believe I believe us thanks Bill you have to believe that if you I believe I can follow you foreign [Applause] [Music] would follow them I believe it would be a proof of the testimony now we can say We Believe but until we have proven sane that he said will be upon us then we are just confessing to be Believers but not the possession of the levers so he is he says have confession and possession if these signs are following you you're still pressing to possession you have to have you must confess before you possess okay do you get that tonight you have to tell before you could show and after you show you a good proof all right let's go praise God so Paul he said ordain the gifts in the church First Corinthians 15 he set the church the gifts of speaking in tongues Miracles all these other gifts were set in the church and Jesus said he repeated it again going into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature how far all the world who too every creature they never receive it yet and these signs shall follow them I believe how long these signs shall follow them in all the world in every creature these sides have followed them in my name they shall cast out Devils speak with new tongues and they shall take up deadly thing or serpent deadly thing will not harm them they will lay hands and sick and they shall recover this was his last commission to the church no devil can't say your calorie secondary and and like somebody in the prayer will the devil in charge of it the Devil he's a boss all the time before Jesus come and receive nobody could identify devils and demons and whatnot there's no people in policy they know people sick and whatnot but there was no identification because this manifestation was not known before so when Jesus came Jesus shook the world the religious world because he was exposing the spirits that they couldn't design and couldn't deal with and that is why the woman with the daughter of X with the devil no she can't go these current Pharisees with them things people are not stupid you want to play in foolish and because she he born and said she morning grandmother went in that church they fight describe and Pharisees there's nothing demon cast no business that many ceremonial business they must elect a business the law business so she came worship and Jesus and whatnot my daughter affected the devil and whatnot and Jesus stand up there and say it's not fit to take the children's bread and give it to dogs you want to say but nobody else can help you know I am moving but even the doors get their crumbs she said for this sin your daughter that devil that my god of Power Hit That Woman daughter inside that house there all that devil blast all this other day that shows you could say the right thing just like what Gideon said you could say the right thing you could have the right attitude it's something that that's your choice God can force you have to say the right thing God can't force you to do the right thing for you go to my weight cutting machine come on come on man no no you can pray High Lord you have to do something yourself if you do exercise and you do the right diet and you do the right thing praise God that you you in trouble no Angela coming and sweep your house because you're lazy to do it come on please brother Branham he says no watch that was his last commission to the church Paul is in ordaining these gifts into the church 30 years later in Galatians 1 8 he said if an angel from heaven preaches to you any other gospel then which had already been received already been preached let him be a curse for the brown I believe that Pentecost began without an ending I believe it's to be in every creature all times at all places that Pentecost would always remain the Pentecostal blessing should be upon the people we shall take that as an absolute we shall take that as a fact we shall take that but no compromise the Pentecostal blessing is promised it should be here it's all people it's all times we have access to it oh get the Lord Our Praise offering the devil cannot get the Holy Ghost but you can get the Lord some praises he don't have the seed he is not a seed you have the seed there may be corruption around it there may be all kind of issues about it that doesn't change who you are that's why Jacob although he was a rascal although he was a trickster and whatever it is he fought for the birthright there was something inside of him that long for the birthright he so despised it but Jacob loved it and God said he saw a hate and Jacob I love oh give the Lord a shout in the house God love you tonight that is why you're here praise God praise God you're struggling but he ain't give up praise God Hallelujah the main thing and if you give up you finish you're done praise God don't you ever give up you keep fighting anyhow you keep pressing on your own you say God Will Make A Way somehow Oh Glory to God if I live a holy life shun the wrong and do the right God will make a way for me oh God I don't know how but he will make a way Oh Glory to God hallelujah hallelujah praise the name of the Lord Brother Branham please God praise God I am wondering today it's what is happening are we really getting the people to God are we just letting them to church we must get them to Christ where there is this quickening power not just Christ you know we are against Christ the Mysteries we are together with Christ The Hidden Mysteries right under Christ deceiver Mysteries we talk about the Christ that has quickening power because the great thing power is what you'd have to deal with your children be quick then power is what happened with your wife the quickness power is whatever deal with your husband if pregnant power is what you deal with on your job the quickening power deal with your Blues [Applause] [Music] when they drink it in the water they're drinking it's spirits there we have sent it here with all the blues they say pass me a cold bottle of water you know no they want spirits they want rum they want whiskey they want something I get them a chance they had bad well when God knows Spirits you need but not that kind of spirit you need Holy Spirit we just drink Spirit you know oh if you drink of this water you shall bang you shall never taste again is that water to drink you know it's a spiritual drinking and when you drink that Spirit they charge you it's Quicken you it's anoints you it refreshes you it's a refreshing from God it's a refreshing you're getting tonight that's a spirit quick and power the anointing they would like to talk about it but it has to have it coming to Christ [Applause] so when people are supposed to be getting the spirit they write their notes like the devil you know not devil making them right notes you know but the devil fighting them from getting in the spirit because in the spirit is where you can get Revelation and Revelation is prevailing power you think the devil don't understand that once you get in the spiritual Revelation you need Blues are depression and whatnot go another girl for that spirit in that Spirit you can't get no Revelation you'll be person you need angel cake you need something to help you out of that praise God when the prophet gets back he said bring me a Minstrel where you want that menstrual for to get him out of that blue sting or that vexation business how we could prophesy when you're not in the spirit he can't hear from God all to the spirit you can't hear from God all to the spirit the devil sight in the spirit but we gonna fight right back oh give the Lord a shout he fighting but we're gonna fight right back there is a church with a spirit line in it that's what Abel caught a revelation a spirit line Revelation and he hold to that line foreign not everybody like me God make one one on my kind when you make my money that that brand he started wandering it's what's happening are we really getting the people to God are we just getting them to church we must get them to Christ wear this quick and power it's good to go to church sure it's as fast we can go but it's not far enough when you come to church that's good but go on to Christ from the church because we must receive this quick and Power I hear somebody Mysteries Christ is the mystery in you hope of glory but you see this here must you see the quickening power if we ever expect to be in that General Resurrection let them drop the Mysteries behind that one but your blast the Ministries that see that people say I don't like Mysteries you know because you see what happened their life is a mystery the preaching mystery but the mystery is really light that's your life all right let's go he said no no watch because it's the only thing that will ever bring us from the dead if this Same Spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwell in you it would also quickly make bring to life your mortal body what is a promise to us and this is where I get the inspiration from here now notice the very essence of this Resurrection is to tell and to show and to prove that Jesus has raised from the dead not Harmony message not God's in a prophet not a half books is to tell it's to show it is to prove that Jesus Christ is raised from the dead look at those disciples those disciples from a man who not working with them preaching Jesus and they asked Jesus if we should suit them trying to form a denomination you know they try to form a business group they're trying to form a group of people that you know he's not with us therefore we should stop him die people you message you know I'm not with them so they're trying to stop me are you saying nothing I wanted to invite you know I ain't looking at that you know me already I ain't saying that they say who should I just talk about you nobody shall not stop me just the devil same devil if I tell me fighting all of them brothers over there all them choices over there is one devil we fight them but they're showing you the spirit and his disciples they want to stop that Manchester City man alone not because you're not part of our organization that you will cut him off leave the man alone he'll be talking about Christ and he preaching the gospel leave them he doing some good thing was getting jealous then I fight double the one who greater who are more Revelation who's stronger more Holy Ghost you know that argument no Holy Ghost dispute no Holy Ghost because once the Holy Ghost comes in the church they don't mind this I am that no no no God set in the church and what God sat in the church room and on set no man could change Philip go here this one go dear this one do this here I know Bishop the answer to no headquarters the answer to okay the Lord some Praises that coming back you know because there's going to be another book of Acts who said that God said that this prophesied nobody gonna stop that there's gonna be another book of Acts I'm excited about this message oh glory to God around says 1975 I was like I know getting started this thing no coming is that the jump up now oh glory to God equipment power he is not dead he's raised from the dead oh God I ain't gonna die or nothing happened David said I shall not die but live to declare the works of the Lord the Lord are chasing me sore but he had not given me over unto death or plan to me the gates of righteousness or I shall enter into the gates Oh Glory to God oh the voice of rejoicing I like that one is in the Tabernacles of the righteous yeah Glory another one [Music] notice the very essence of this Resurrection is a tell and to show and to prove that Jesus has raised from the dead he is not dead he's living he lives here he lives in us I'll be with you even in you a little while the world sees me no more yet he shall see me for I will be with you even in you unto the end of the world now as Christians we all claim he's alive we have been quickened from life from Death To Life by his spirit and if he hasn't been quickened then we are not made alive now we're going to break this subject he said oh we are quickly and we can be sure this is the truth now this is your own life this is my life if this isn't the truth I'm fixing to say I'm one of the most foolish people in the world I've given my life for something of nothing to it but if it's the truth I owe everything that I am I owe everything that I could be to the cause of which we are standing for and I think here we go here the

wait David said I was glad David didn't lose enthusiasm bye oh gosh I forget you no service tonight we're remembering all the time this supposed to be your food this supposed to be at Anchor Point I was glad when they said unto me let us go there is a one thing of desired all my life that I shall be dwell and the host of the Lord all the days of my life on the inquire of his temper that's David and God called him a man after his own heart man that loved God do you love God even focus on New York because you just caught upon yourself I know that's the day that it was sealed forever in the sight of God we notice that the same spirit that raised Christ from the grave is dwelling on us how could that be the spirit of Reason Jesus and the dead has dwell in us no no no is the spirit that quickens it is not the word that quickens so four hours of word word where's the spirit behind them for us a special or song especially after the service come bring this is not equipment I just I'm just making a point I'm not saying anything against that you know just making a point could we do that too but I'm saying but Abraham say is the spirit that quickens not the word as good as the word is let me continue it is the spirit of quickness it's not the word of quickness it is a spirit of quickness the word or gives the word life or give it wings to fly or give it access it is the spirit that does that and I have John 6 63 Jesus speaks it is the spirit that quick net the flesh Prophet had nothing the words that I speak unto you their spirit and their life that means this word could turn anytime do you get that the word is the word but the word is also Spirit but to take the spirit to quickly so when the word turned the spirit is equipped in power and when the word turning you is the kingdom in you in other words the word made manifest in you is the kingdom in you behold the kingdom is within you oh give the Lord some praises let's go now the wheat alone is just wheat but when the quick in life gets into it into the wheat then it gives it life and we which were once dead made in the image of God and yet dead incident trespasses there is some way God has to get this quickening life into your mortal bodies into not upon not I feel the anointed we're talking about this have to come in at that day you shall know I since John 14 20.

didn't say that program said that I am talking about your body they took coaches off a Paul's body and people were raised and people got healed from the quickening power that came over Paul's body oh

my Lord my God you know what they're showing these words are alive these are Spirit given words that's why he says say what a tip say Oh Glory these are Spirit given words and the spirit itself is right in the word glory to God under control and listen there's a higher power that is working the spirit of God that is working working on this word you think God don't know what he said to that Prophet you think God wouldn't honor what he said to that Prophet God's in a genuine 20th century Prophet with Spirits spoken with her bride he must know what he said through that prophet we are just echoing what the prophet said he said take the book and eat it we eat it and we prophesying from it oh give the Lord a shout Same Spirit the spirit the prophet and the bride say the same thing the pride of The Voice not just the prophet of the voice the Bride of a voice oh can the Lord and Shout the Bride of the voice the voice of God will be in her Oh Glory to God Amen [Music] [Applause] man trying to out the bride's voice praise God intellectual idiots intellectual Minds Hallelujah the Bride of a voice say the spirit the prophet and the bride say the same thing he said God give the bride a voice that's in the word he give her our voice and the spirit and the Brain say okay the Lord a shout not the prophet said not the tape say the spirit not Pentecost The Same Spirit okay the Lord I shall remember the punch The Same Spirit comes back Oh Glory to caught the voice of God will be in her once more the world will hear direct from God as the elephant brother Branham they're going to hear once again direct from God God will speak in power there are fire upon the shoulders of the man of God pick it from out of the fire my Lord [Applause] Hallelujah [Applause] I myself did no more juice on this thing here just 11 pages now running is true that's all I preaching I know on page four they don't steal food you know they reheated this expressions fresh carcass all right there's some way you do what I'm saying God had to get this quick in life into your mortal bodies I am talking about your body he's going deeper going deeper than that Jesus was the word you believe that don't you he called John 1 in the beginning of the word was with God what was God would mean flesh into our mouths no here we go this is deep as the promised Messiah Jesus he Jesus Quicken every word that was prophesied that he would do he written it heal the sick show he born of aversion all of that is true he was the word manifest on Earth but he could not do this as a man it taking the spirit of God dwelling in him to Quicken these promises to him so Jesus himself had to Quicken the promises to him that's why the scripture when the woman brought the I think the alabaster box then he understood [Music] that the anointing was for his burial the word was coming to him I quickened to him where the season is changing now so the woman come to bring that because you're moving the next Channel praise God for me Oh Glory hey I feel the anointed on that he could not do this as a man taking the spirit of God dwell into him to Quicken these promises to him I hope we get this real clear now prophet Jesus is drilling it down Jesus being a man himself the body all right flesh Jesus but it took the spirit in him the spirit then he quoted Jesus it's not me to do the works it's my father that dwelleth in me he's the one that does the work See Jesus himself was the word but to take a spirit [Applause] foreign has to become the word that the spirit could monk the bride and give the bride a voice because the bride with the spirit upon her would be the word manifested what did Jesus do after you overcome the devil and he found a place where it's written what what the scripture say the scriptures have said it the spirit is upon me who is he who is upon me who is the me the word do you understand that he couldn't come without his Spirit upon him the spirit had to be upon him because that is what Messiah is the anointed one Oh Glory to God so you'll be in the word is not enough you have to become anointed word that makes you a messiah or a messiah oh give the Lord a shout a little Messiah because you are now anointed [Music] do you get that tonight all right Jesus he was predestinated wow by default knowledge of God how God plan was to be he was in a redeemer and this Redeemer could only be a son so that was God's promise all the way from the Garden of Eden that Jesus would be here here he was as a man born of a vision but it taken the King the god to greaten that word to him so even Jesus had to get the quick in power quickening the wood to him and he was the word Quicken the word Quicken for that hour so watch so oh we have the word but the word must be quickened for the hour do you get it now the time had come when he wanted to be a redeemer the Lord failed other things that failed nobody takes a redeemer and he was the promised Redeemer he was quickened by the word and watch but Abraham says no you are right now you it was so we just talk about Jesus right predestinian seed right let's talk about you speak in the word now you are a predestinancy just like Christ was and when not if when the rain falls on the seed the life produces itself when the Holy Spirit Falls now I want you to see the Holy Spirit as the spirit itself The Same Spirit that fell under the Pentecost that Spirit not pentecosting no not 1906 the Holy Spirit you shall receive power when after the Holy Ghost come upon you Oh Glory to God and the Holy Ghost couldn't come until the world was restored that's why he sent a prophet to carry all the scattered word that tied back into the world to bring down the Holy Ghost the objective was always to bring down the pectin power it's the flesh Prophet that nothing oh give the Lord a shout in the house the objective was to bring Spirit to you [Applause] how could Spirit come to us and there isn't that channel of the World open up because the word is a conductor of the spirit so what are the common lady plummeting us that's why they would have to be in the bride when the spirit hit the bright soul is magnetism of the Holy Ghost that's the big magnet coming to pick up what's inside of you all right let me see if we can finish off your musicians how do I close off here foreign these seeds so watch the predestinated the changes Ministry the anointing not in them yet it was upon them so the healing said cast no Devils they say Lord devil subject to us he said no Rejoice because Devil's subject to you we tried to call your name in heaven but he can't tell them yeah to get so I'm feeling good and special because they are wrong Jesus and they partake in Jesus ministry and sharing with the ministry including Judas right so therefore he said they hold himself in the upper room of course Jesus Jesus missed that whole and this is the word sees word and the Word was laying on there without life in it in them all of a sudden they come a song from Heaven as the waters begin to gush down and it actually filled all the house where they were sitting and the seeds begin to grow they begin to manifest itself the word of God being manifested so therefore the seed in them no life they have the word in them secret is the word is in Peter the word is in Mary the word is in the Mary Magdalene the word is no one of them are dead but they would they're fighting in the upper room they're scared they close the door they're written or behold wait tearing the Jerusalem until powerful man high their scriptures we start my lips I'm not a tongue I'll speak to the people there are scriptures they shall come to pass afterwards I'll Port my spirit upon All Flesh there are scriptures waiting to be manifested Jesus openly understands the scriptures he opened the word to them and they laying with these scriptures praising God continually creating an atmosphere for the holy ghosts are coming upon them and when the day of Pentecost was fully Come Oh Glory to God it was in one mind and one Accord and suddenly they come outside from Heaven fill all the house when they were sitting the first thing Peter step on and said this is that that the prophet Joel he identified the anoint and the power the Dynamics back in the scriptures this is that that the prophet johans speak of it's fulfilled now oh we have it we can prove it we could tell it rise up and walk foreign [Applause] they were telling it these people are not drunk as you suppose they were telling it Satan didn't move but when Peter began to show it and begin to manifest it and the purpose of the work they say we have to stop this thing we're not here to tell we have to show and to prove he's the same yesterday to Dance Forever he has raised from the dead I'm gonna close up here tonight oh hallelujah hallelujah praise God praise God praise God let me skip it we become Sons and Daughters of God to that same Spirit by the full knowledge of God look at the Millions on Earth that didn't receive it when Jesus was here how thankful we should be this morning to know that we have the direct evidence and the Bible proves that we have included in that great Resurrection morning coming that great Easter we have the earnest of it right now in all Mortal bodies watch yeah this mystery here this secretary the predestinence the ones are at the first of course to be quickened when the Holy Spirit comes to claim its own before everybody gets anointed the true anointed comes forth first then before dollars get the same anointing Africa but the true ones will be quick and full there will be a bad Revival that is spread to the rest don't want to call it the foolish win Revival but they seem anointing see but the quickening power comes to the predestinated face oh are you with me my Lord praise God you remember he said watch watch he said uh you was thinking you were part of him therefore he could tell all right therefore he could tell the end from the beginning because he's Eternal and you being a Son of God or daughter of God then you were in his thinking at the beginning and when the Holy Spirit comes and you're on Earth walking around here as a sinner we don't in your life there is something you don't know what's taking place but you're hungry I hear the Presbyterian brother where the puppy is talking about it back there he was a Free Will Baptist and my fellow brother there's something in you something that you you never put in there it was something that you couldn't desire to be in there it is something that's contrary to your own nature it's to foreknowledge of God taking place God's word praise God so what Abraham says now here's the predestined plan in plain view just as other sees the word of God is a seed and must have grown prepared beforehand if you sow a seed and throw it out there birds will take it so God watch so the ground has to be made ready first so God in Sovereign Grace prepares the heart first he prepared you when before the foundation of the world to receive him in this age he foreknew You by his foreknowledge and ordained you to eternal life he knew you therefore he prepared you he knew you therefore he oh God this is sweet tonight what that's the reason you staggered out of these things and stagger into what you have no it was God leading you to the place where you're deemed for you to be [Applause] glory to God hallelujah and that's the reason the seed of faith when you're preaching Faith see the resilience of the Lord and see what take place all the gifts of the Bible where can people working themselves up oh Hallelujah I believe it and come up and find yourself disappointed the ground has to be fordained before and then your strikes hallelujah praise God he said no watch and as Pentecostal people today let me say this that we are standing in this last day where God promises Potter his Spirit Upon My Flesh and his sons and daughters should prophesy for he said these signs shall follow them I believe it's the hour that what makes the creation in you praise God why you talk about any church is the atmosphere I'm going to skip it here atmosphere praise God the atmosphere so God in every age ordain Institution for that age a message for that age that day could have laws and anything as they want to but when that overcomes the holy spirit of God which was at the beginning taught out and spoken for that age that Spirit hunts that egg and when he hears the message did nothing wouldn't stop him again God put something inside of you praise God I'm not even talking about the message message text I'm talking about the spirit message that coming behind the message I'm talking about the message in the message the spirit will go out and when that Spirit go out they go hunt the seas in this message that has the word in them and pull them out and bring them out no man ain't gonna stop them no passing will stop them the spirit will speak to them the bride will hear direct from God the spirit will speak to them there will be a Revival there will be a gathering oh praise God all them all them Church ministers all them Petty ministers all them humanist second in realm he said the Bible will never be manhandled God will rock the bride out from under them shake the bride from under them Rock the world there'll be a short quick message that gonna shake the whole nation what you think that messages Dynamics and mechanics together oh praise the name of the Lord hallelujah praise God praise God praise God praise God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah praise God praise God hallelujah I'm gonna close he said the same thing when we preach in the word of God it's Vindicated on previous God's word for this hour there is something within the believer I don't care how loyalist father was to the church how loyalist mother was his grandparents in the church is teaching contrary but if the church is teaching contrary to this hour of the baptism of the Holy Ghost message yeah we call it that's the message you know the Bible mentioned there is something in him that screams out with ladybaniard either his father is a Certain Shade in their Spirit realm that the Holy Ghost gonna blast out nothing will stop it that way the woman away to run which the water part and say come see a man she couldn't care what them virgins think she was free the son of man set you free she was free to run and praise God who want to lift the nose up by the business she was running straight to the upper room Give the Lord some Praises straight to be part of this bright call in his last day hallelujah hallelujah no the holy spirit is here on Earth here we go looking for those individuals that God has ordain the life in this age and as soon as it finds it it does just like it did on Jesus Christ the great super Son of God who redeemed us all it comes down and takes the place and Abode into the human life notice it brought the quickness power that quick then power has come upon Jesus Quicken him to manifest every promise of her for that day so does the holy spirit that come upon us in this day it's not Holy Spirit you are not the devil mocking the holy spirit it's the real true Holy Spirit it will manifest the promise of the hour Oh Glory to God this is your home stretch here when it fell upon Luther it man him with the promise of that hour when he fell upon Wesley it manifests the promise of that hour when he fell in this day it reminded of the promise of the hour whenever Moses it manifests the promise of the Allah it's the Holy Spirit coming out to Quicken and make our life those he will fordained of God to be in the rapture Oh Glory to God hallelujah hallelujah my God my God we find out in each age when God said a certain thing would happen here come that man along and manifested that that is William Branham and then here come the people along and live that that was God himself living in the people because it was an answering of his word now God only provided we only provided wait a day is his son through his word for his age quickened by the spirit of Life praise him praise him in the Lord he said that's what the matter is just today we are full of theology without any Dynamics in it in other words we have got to have the spark to the gasoline or the gasoline is no more it could be water no matter how well we are taught all his great teachers teach us get the Precision place you and the teaching teaching teaching teaching teaching Mighty management teachers no matter what we are taught however we believe how much the Bible we say which is true we believe it's true it's got to be the Dynamics that's got to be there the spark to set up with a fire and they started rolling we've got to have that if you don't the church sits still the car sits still you sit still but no matter how much you say I sympathize I believe every word you've got to have something to spark that off to make that 100 octane gold of iron and the Big Church of God go to moving on it's got to take the Dynamics with the mechanics nothing wrong with the mechanics but lucky Dynamics and I think that is what the matter with the church today we are lacking begin to play something we are lacking that dynamical power to press this word and make it live for this day Martin Luther had a mechanism dynamics of his day John Wesley had them of History what about our day this is another time the church should be fully grown now ready to go and meet Christ with the manifestation of Every Blessing he promised in the Bible where we are we are ready for that did you hear what he said with the manifestation with with the books from voice of God with the pilot books or who have written in tablet form or whatever it is this is the prophecy the church should be fully grown now that's been right up the brotherly kindness ready to go to meet Christ Holy Spirit charity with the manifestation of every blessing that he
