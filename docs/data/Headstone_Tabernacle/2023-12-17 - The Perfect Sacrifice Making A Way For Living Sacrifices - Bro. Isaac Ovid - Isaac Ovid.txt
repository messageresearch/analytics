your house Lord to be in your presence Lord how good you are to us Lord if we had a thousand tongues it would not be enough to express our gratitude to you lord your love has found us Lord Your Love reaches us your love connects to us and Lord we could only be here because of your love because of your grace because of your mercy father so we thank you this morning Lord that we could be gathered in your house of worship and praise for you to Lord have communion with us have fellowship with us for Lord for you to speak to our hearts and Lord for Lord for us to be drawn closer to you father Lord as we come to the end of this year Lord to see how time is unfolding and to see how all these things are taking place Lord how grateful we are to have had a prophet in this day to point us to what we we should expect father that we would not walk around blind we would not walk around ignorant we would not walk around confused we would not walk around frustrated but we could walk around with boldness and confidence father knowing that your prophetic utterance has made a way for us to stand in your presence Lord and the blood that was shed for us makes it possible for you to see us through this Blood despite our mistakes despite our sins our failures our fallings Lord you put things and place father to reconcile man to yourself father so lord it's not our strength it's not our ability it's nothing we could ever do it's nothing we could ever earn it's nothing we could ever deserve father but Lord It's just by your grace Lord your grace and your mercy has seen us through father so we pray a special blessing on your people this morning we pray a special blessing on your church this morning we pray a plal blessing on the musicians and the singers and the worshippers those that are in the house those that are connected online wherever they may be this morning and Lord let the shout of the king be in the camp may you break chains may you break shackles may you restore hearts and Minds may you heal the sick in our midst may you restore backsliders father if there's someone here today who doesn't know you in the power of your Resurrection Lord may they come to Know You by a supernatural experience if there's someone Desiring the baptism of the Holy Ghost and Fire may this be there day there's someone with hidden Sin unconfessed Sin Lord may they come today and repent and be reconciled back to you may you take me out of the way and may you speak to your people today we ask in the precious name of Jesus Christ and the church says amen it's certainly great to be in the house of the Lord this morning certainly want to welcome one and all and if you have your Bibles would you turn with me to two portions of scripture I certainly appreciate the songs uh the songs service this morning with Anthony what an anointing what a presence so I want to read two portions of scripture reading first Peter 2 and want to read from Romans 12 and brother ID actually read from this first Peter scripture I believe last week so we are connecting to the Turning of the corner that the spirit has led us to along this journey amen So reading 1 Peter chapter 2 I'm reading from verse one wherefore laying aside all malice and all Gile and hypocrisies and envies and all evil speakings as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word that ye may grow thereby if so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious to whom coming as unto a living living Stone disallowed indeed of men but chosen of God and precious ye also as Lively stones have built up a spiritual house and holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ so ye also as Lively stones have built up a spiritual house and holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ wherefore also it is contained in the scripture behold I lay in Zion a Chief Cornerstone elect precious and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded unto you therefore which believe he is precious but unto them which be disobedient the stone which the builders disallow that same the same is made a head of the corner and a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense even to them which stumble at the word being disobedient where unto also they were appointed but ye we are a chosen generation a royal priesthood and holy nation A peculiar people that he should show forth the Praises of him who had called you out of Darkness into His Marvelous Light which in time pass were not a people but and now the people of God which had not obtained Mercy but now have obtained mercy and reading Romans 12 reading from verse one I be te ye therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that he present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated this morning in the presence of the Lord It's it's certainly a great privilege to be here one more time in the house of God can the church say Amen can we give the Lord a hand of Praise this morning amen amen amen and what a time we are living in as we come to the end of this year and people are in the spirit of all kind of things there's a spirit of War there's a spirit of of argument there's a spirit of of of depression and frustration there's a spirit of of spiritual wickedness there's a spirit of Christmas there's a spirit of closing out the year there's a spirit of party there's a spirit of relaxation there's all kind of spirits going on but we are in the spirit of the coming of the lord we are under expectation for something to take place to change this Mortal into immortality something to change our walk change our talk change our hope change our expectation to give us a new joy to give us a new peace and we are pressing on with all that we know we are here for the battle we are here to put our shoulders to the wheel to make a church that would make a Revival we are here toing bring down charity we are here to call for fire we are here to do all that we can do for the kingdom of God we are here to put our Mark upon this Earth whether God takes us in the Rapture or he calls us home before the rapture we want the world to know that we were here we want the devil to know that we passed through we want the world to know that we came from God and we went back to God and we come from God and we going back to God and no devil no demon no depression no frustration no sickness nothing past nothing present nothing nobody could say nothing anybody could do could separate us from the love of God is that how you feel this morning so I'm excited that we are coming to a deeper realization of who we are and more importantly who's we are because we don't belong to ourselves we belong to God he paid the price he purchased the price he paid the price uh Hallelujah so the devil can't buy you because you're already paid for the devil can't hold you because you are being held in the hands of the Lord not by your strength but by his grace and by his Mercy we fall every day but the Bible said I Die daily every day we get back up uh every day we come and we're pressing every day we are worshiping every day we are praising God through the mistakes through the child we lift their head up because there's a eagle to Eagle call saying come on baby eagle Hallelujah come on fly higher lift up your head where you belong so we come to give God praise and worship we come to create the right atmosphere because we know we can't get anything unless we're in the right atmosphere this is not a Kingdom Hall it's not a lecture hall it's not a intellectual Revelation kind of thing no it's the spirit of God trying to connect with the word we have all the word from all these years the prophet of Malachi 4 reveal every mystery tied up every loose end there's no new mystery there's no loose end that we need to fix he already did it because if he didn't do it he didn't fulfill his Great Commission but he tied up every m he tied up the Loose Ends so we can see plainly this morning that we are born for such a time as this and we are going to Perfection we are going to adoption and healing is hanging over your head adoption is hanging over your head Perfection wherever you walk Perfection is going to wherever you walk Dynamics has to follow you because you are the mechanics to attract the Dynamics you are the word made flesh Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord can the church say Amen but Anthony I'm just testing the temperature just want to make sure they're not caught up in a Wonder piece of pork and they're not caught up in the in the season so much that they missed this great moving this rustle in the mulberries tree this still Small Voice that once to attract your attention in the middle of your life's journey this voice saying come up come up hither this voice saying look up your Redemption joid n this voice saying you are a creature of Eternity trapped in time this voice that saying you your sickness is temporary this voice that saying your family is going to be delivered this voice that saying you going to have a Revival that voice that's saying you're going to get the Holy Ghost that voice that's speaking that say you are going to understand can the church say Amen oh blessed be the name of the Lord so I'm not going to be too long with you this morning just a little encouragement for a title this morning the perfect sacrifice making a way for living sacrifices Hallelujah you heard that the perfect sacrifice making a way for living sacrifices there's been burning in my heart that God is calling us to be living sacrifices can the church say Amen you know in the Old Testaments brother Clark every single sacrifice had to be a dead sacrifice you killed kill the lamb Hallelujah you kill everything so it was offered up to God as a dead sacrifice but God was never happy with dead sacrifices it was a temporary solution God has always wanted a Living Sacrifice Hallelujah a sacrifice at moving a sacrifice at giving him praise Hallelujah that's why I say oh my we bring a sacrifice of praise Hallelujah a dead sacrifice can't bring a sacrifice of praise but a living sacrif ice can bring praises and it cost you something you don't feel like worshiping but your sacrifice and your worship you don't feel like praising but you make a sacrifice and you praise Him anyhow oh can somebody help me this morning let me kind of lay a little Foundation we read the scripture Paul is speaking in Romans 12 he said I beseech you beseech is not encourage beseech is not tell the word beseech means to almost beg forcefully beg and Paul is not speaking to anybody he's speaking to Brethren he say I beseech you therefore for Brethren so he wasn't talking to the world he wasn't talking to the man on the street he wasn't talking to the person who randomly come to church no he is talking to Believers he is saying my brothers he's saying House of God he's saying headstone Tabernacle with everything I know he said I beseech you therefore therefore means based on what was said before so through the whole of Romans there's now therefore no condemnation all of that that he said before what shall separate us from the love of God all that I said before Oh can the church help me this morning in the letter of Romans Paul preached many things he said now therefore having said all these things I beseech you Brethren by the mercies of God it will not be your strength it will not be your ability but by the mercies of God I beseech you I beg you I pleading with you I come this morning at the end of the year to plead with the [Applause] church that you present it's a presentation are you ready to make a presentation this morning he said I beseech you there for Brethren by the mercies of God that he present now there are many things we supposed to present we we supposed to present our Praises we are supposed to present our worship we are supposed to present our all after you bring your worship anybody hear me this morning after you present your praise after you profess to be a Christian after you read the books after you listen to the tapes after you prayed in your prayer closet I want something more from you many people could talk this thing but I want after you say you're a Believer after you know there's no condemnation after you know that all oh come on now the whole creation groaning and after all of [Applause] that I want to beg you this morning can I beg you this morning can I urge you this morning can I ple with you this morning that you make another presentation we come in here worshiping this morning but I want you to present more than worship he said I want you to present your bodies present your fingers present your hands present your arms present your feet present your lips present your eyes present your ears present your heart oh where oh how on somebody help me this morning I want you to bring it as a presentation to God a Living Sacrifice that God could inspect that he could inspect because you know in the Old Testament the sacrifice Sister Williams had to be inspected you can't just sacrifice anything you can't just say this is good no the priest had to check it he had to make sure that the presentation was what it was at without blemish without fault without mistake anybody with me this [Applause] morning by the mercies of God that you present your bodies your body that body that you have to dress you have to present it a certain way a Living Sacrifice Living Sacrifice not a dead sacrifice a daily sacrifice in Old Testament every day they had the evening sacrifice every day they had to bring a sacrifice every day they had to repent every day they had to say Lord I'm coming back to you because I did something wrong and I need something more but by the mercies of God the whole season shift from the old dispensation and new to say you are now a Living Sacrifice every day your life is a sweet smelling fragrance to [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] God not just your worship I want to nail this down because people come to the church and they worshiping and they say hallelujah but the body is going where they shouldn't go the body is doing what it shouldn't do the body's listening to what it shouldn't listen and the body saying things it shouldn't say that body getting you in trouble that body have you frustrated that body have some gossiping tied up in that body oh you don't hear me this morning that body have kind of the problem is not me the problem is you the problem is me and you the oh come on now the seed in you is a perfect seed but we got to bring this body under [Applause] subjection can the church say [Applause] Amen present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy you mean you could walk holy you mean he could dress holy you mean he could speak holy you mean he could have holy thoughts you mean he could speak holy words you mean you can give a holy response when somebody says the wrong thing to you Hallelujah acceptable unto God you know God could reject it you know God could reject your offering right which is your reasonable service so I want to take a journey through scripture this morning and talk about this thing called sacrifice perfect sacrifice living sacrifice sacrifice in general and this sacrifice is a big word it is impossible possible to achieve anything in life without sacrifice and we make sacrifices whether we think about it or not whatever you do there's something means sacrifice to do it when you buy something you are sacrificing not buying something else when you go somewhere you're sacrificing the where else you could have gone so in the message show us the father brother brandom said I know you're sitting here and it's your vacation time let me call it Christmas time and you're sacrificing your time of being out somewhere else to come in church so just coming to church is a sacrifice you know just praising God is is a sacrifice anybody with me this morning when you sing is a sacrifice When you pray is a sacrifice you're sacrificing doing something else to do something that you consider maybe more valuable but sacrifice is part of life life for us to eat something needs to be sacrificed because we can't eat living things so the chicken is sacrificed it's killed it's dead so we could eat so sacrifice and death and life are inria con connected you can't separate the too and sacrifice that it was part of God because the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world so sacrifice was part of God's plan even before the world was created God already was sacrificing so if God was prepared to make a sacrifice what about you and I are you prepared to make sacrifices to get what you want are you pre because a sacrifice means a loss it means to give up something for you to excel in school you have to sacrifice playing on the field you have to sacrifice going where you want to go you have to sacrifice doing all kind of other thing because you want to go after something you can't go in the Olympics race and not sacrifice and spend time with the discipline Paul speaks of striving for the Mastery he is temperate in all things in other words he's disciplined because he's sacrificing unhealthy food because you want to be healthy everybody with me this morning people make sacrifices for their family people make sacrifices for their careers people make sacrifices for their health I'm not eating that I'm not eating that because I want to make a sacrifice because I want to be healthy people make sacrifices for their education many of the older ones the grandparents or the parents may say I never went to University but I sacrifice so that my child could do what I couldn't do you know many parents sacrifice what they ate to make sure the children are some me to eat to go to school and the same children that are sacrificed for come back ungrateful and say I want that and you you how painful it becomes when you bear the cost of sacrifice people make sacrifices for the Hobbies people tell I can't come why because they want to do something that they consider more important people make sacrifices with their financial goals I'm not going to spend on that or spend n that or spend on that because I want to achieve this are trying to save for a house or and not buying all that KFC or buying all that thing or whatever it is they're making a sacrifice and they make a choice to make a sacrifice people make sacrifices for their personal grow growth they go to work workshops and seminars and all these things and people want to come to the house of God without making a sacrifice sacrifices could be good and sacrifices could be bad because some people go after so much things they end up sacrificing their families sacrificing their marriages sacrifice people who are addicted to drugs they end up sacrificing all kind of good things to go after drugs sacrifice and they don't count the cost of it but a real sacrifice is not a sacrifice if it doesn't involve giving up something of value a true sacrifice a true sacrifice cost so God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son it was a cost it was a price to pay it is not a sacrifice if there's no personal inconvenience when you have to hold it to the hor of the Altar and cry and pray and sigh is that a a comfortable thing but you you want something from God so you're willing to do what it takes Lord whatever it takes I'm willing to sacrifice it can the church say Amen I'm willing to lose friends I'm willing to sacrifice friends because I want something more I want to sacrifice what happened on a job I want to sacrifice the promotion because I want something more can the church say amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah and throughout scripture you see over and over the whole Bible is a book of sacrifice because the whole mystery of what brings us here is Christ himself had to die which was a perfect sacrifice so we could have access so from Genesis to Revelation you'll find sacrifice all through the scripture can the church say Amen oh it was a sacrifice for Abraham to leave his family and his home to obey that called to seek a city whose Bill land maker is God it was a sacrifice for those at the beginning of this message when it was just a few books and tapes you hear the old stories of what people had to go through for this message this message is dripping in blood this whole gospel is

in Jericho to hide those Israelite spies she didn't know what was going to happen she didn't know what was going to happen if she was caught it was a risky thing a sacrifice could be a costly thing

time you worship every time oh come on [Applause] [Music] [Applause] now you think it was easy for Paul we read the letters of Paul Paul after he was Shipwrecked he was beaten but George he was in prison is one thing to be beaten or no it's a whole next thing to be Shipwrecked it's a whole next thing to be in prison and listen Paul just considered that sacrifice that's right he say I'm a prisoner of Jesus Hallelujah they think they locked me up in a Roman prison but I know I've been locked up a long time you can't lock up what already locked up oh you don't hear me this morning I'm a prisoner of Jesus [Music] Christ Paul you're under arrest he said I was arrested a long time ago I was arrested by love I was arrested by Grace I was arrested by Mercy and I don't want to be free from it I want to stay arrested I want to stay locked up in his love I want to stay locked up in his grace I want to stay locked up in his Mercy because I'm locked up in his grace because I'm locked up in his Mercy because I'm locked up in his favor the devil can't get to me [Applause] death where is thy string grave where is thy Victory I'm locked up in the resurrection power I'm locked up in the Holy Ghost this [Applause] [Music] morning sacrifice it was a sacrifice for Cornelius the Bible said he gave arms he gave generously and he prayed regularly and there's a memorial in heaven for his sacrifice Abraham's blessing was tied to his willingness to sacrifice and his sacrifices when God saw Abraham was willing to kill his only son God said because of this thing here right now I'm going to unlock blessings for you can the church say Amen you you with me this morning Hallelujah David sacrifice offering peace offerings and burnt offerings what about that woman who washed Jesus feet with that Alabaster jaar expensive perfume and when people first they say what a waste you know how expensive that thing is and that that that song I wish I could sing it you don't know the cost of my praise you don't know the cost of My Worship that woman wasn't counting the cost of it because she was watching deity In the Flesh it was a sacrifice for Israel it was a sacrifice for Daniel to abstain from the King's food this thing goes deeper friends we didn't know the difference between Cain and Abel until it came to the sacrifice they would have been growing up in the house but George normal normal but when the time came Genesis 4:3 and in the process of time it came to pass that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the Lord so it's not that he didn't bring an offering he brought an offering of the fruit of the ground and Abel also brought of the first flings of his flock and of the fat thereof and the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offerings you see people come to God and want to give God what they want and they give God what is left but Lord I give you this I give sometime I come to church I give a little offering I give some tithes I do this and and and God is saying well I see that offering or no but that meet the requirement you need to do better than that and the thing of it in scripture God told Kade if you lift the standard of your sacrifice and do what Abel did I will treat you and bless you amen hallelujah and this is God this is not a preacher talking to K this is not an evangelist or this is God himself saying listen I have a blessing for you you know but the quality of your sacrifice has to be different it didn't meet the standard and I want to get this a tracing this all the way to living sacrifices because some of us think we are living sacrifices or we hoping to be living sacrifices but God is saying is a he said it has to be acceptable offering spiritual sacrifices that are acceptable unto God and the acceptable nature of the offering or the sacrifice is not by our standard amen God has to accept it he has to say this is good I like this worship he has to say I like your worship I like your praise I like your dedication you could please the brother next to you and a sister next to you and they could say well I think brother so and so going to make it or no I think sister so and so had to make it the way she living and God is saying what is that verse five but unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect think about it friends think about it Church all that God has done for us and God is expecting us to give us our whole lives you realize that nothing you own is your own can I say that again can I help us to understand this thing your house is not your house know well well but but my name and indeed is not your house it's his house your car is not your car I don't care if your name on it in full your middle name and all it's not your car it's his car he provided a car for you he provided a house for you but you're renting you're borrowing it doesn't matter it's not yours it's [Music] his Hallelujah and that's where we get mixed up as believer because in a simple thing because Paul's message about Living Sacrifice is a real thing we want to give God what's left we want to take care of all of our business and then whatever left over we say well God well you could hold that to know and God is saying but you your hands that you have to work if I didn't give you your hands your all your thing you think you doing you can do you know if God give you the mind to wake up in the morning and go and do your job you know you have no job if you're losing your mind in the morning you have no no job in is he who give it in mind to work is he who put you up is he who wake up in the morning if God a wake up in morning and you do as if it's yours your praise don't belong to you belongs to God your life don't belong to you you belongs to God all that you are belongs to God you are God that's why brother over say this is not his church this is God's house this clothes I have on belongs to him my phone belongs to him and when you live that way your life begin to be different because if it's his car where you carrying his car uhuh if it's his house what you bringing it his house because your house not your own it belongs to God if you belong to him why you taking your body why you doing your body that oh come on somebody preach back to me this sacrifice you talking about now is not you trying to sacrifice to God God sacrifice to pay for you you don't belong to yourself you're not your own he already paid for you he has a receipt that say I buy you you know because you should have been dead but I paid for you so you could have life and have it more abundantly your sin required debt but I took your place and I paid the price and I died for you so the life you live is not your own life the life you live is not your [Applause] [Music] life and if that could be a revelation for you you will never have a problem to give God praise because praise has nothing to do with your failes and your sin it has to do because of you are paid for with a price you belong to him and there's nothing we could ever do to repay him there's nothing we could ever do we should have been [Applause] dead but the perfect sacrifice came to make way for living sacrifices if you are confused with coming to church you miss the whole picture you could never have a revelation of God and decide well I don't need to go to church Hallelujah because you don't belong to yourself you belong to God you can never have a problem paying TI never because your salary is not yours it belongs to God and God say you know what you keep 90% hallelujah hallelujah this the only deal you could ever have where God says my no no but I given your 90% of it hallelujah oh you don't hear me this morning your car is not yours your house is not yours your land is not yours your money is not yours your mouth is not yours your hand is not yours your children are not yours you are a trustee for your children your children belong to [Applause] [Music] [Applause] God does your sacrifice do you live a sacrificial life Lord I'm dedicating my life to you I'm surrendering my life to you but say get p and blue in the face you much people come to church and you see them on the street and he like but how you dress so if Sister Bern we don't have the strength to come back in the Pulpit we quitting because we trying to get you to understand that your life is not your own and the best thing you can do is serve god with your all with your everything with your life with your substance with your language with what you do with how you move with how you live so he can get the praise and the honor and the glory [Music] God isn't asking you to go and kill a lamb every day and do a burnt offering every day and have the evening sacrifice every day that died when Jesus died but he said praise me continually worship me continually give me honor continually and know you're going to make mistakes but raise him anyhow in your morning prayer in your evening prayer in your morning devotion in your even devotion Living Sacrifice I don't know if this helping somebody this morning and I want you to reframe it because God looked at Cain and he said to his offering he had no respect he had not respect and you know what the Bible says and Cain was very rot that's angry and his countenance fell and I always say this imagine God talking to him like Jesus and a Rich Young Ruler you know what it is to talk to Jesus and ask Jesus a question and Jesus answer you back and then you leave sorrowful by faith in Hebrews the Bible said Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice let it be said of you and I brother sister that we offer to God a more excellent sacrifice not just I raise my hand because everybody raising hand no it's a it's a heart you're lifting your hand because you know that you were supposed to be dead thaty doctors I see sister Nicholas here S have a testimony of being on the doctor's bed you go through and talk to people of what they went through and say well I was ready to go but Mercy held me I'm here standing today because of Mercy you know much time really the doctors don't know what to do the doctors give up and people standing in the house of God because God wasn't finished with them yet we have no time for excuses no time to be sad no time to be depressed well I know what going on no worship God praise God thank God because his Mercy is [Music] [Applause] Everlasting by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice I wanted to be thinking Lord I want to do more for you I want to be named as offering a more excellent sacrifice the song leader don't have to say sing the song to say let's get in the atmosphere no you are coming in the atmosphere because you want your praise your offering your your sacrifice to be called a more excellent sacrifice you're not bringing it to the pastor you're not bringing it to the minister you're not bringing it to the church you're bringing it to God Lord let me be counted among Abel who brought a more excellent [Music] [Applause] sacrifice and all through the Old Testament all of the sacrifices were just speaking of the perfect sacrifice to come because the lamb we know was already sling before the foundation of the world so they were unfolding and they didn't even know what they were unfolding so Abel killed a lamb and God was pleased you see this man have a revelation it hasn't happened yet but he his attributes his DNA he he he tapping into his father here boy because he doing something that is about to be unfolded woo and through scripture After the flood Noah offer burnt offerings of clean animals Abraham there right to kill his his son his only son as a type of God trying to kill his only begotten son at that time he say hold your hand and God off offered a substitute as a type of the substitute that would be offered until that time came for that only son to be killed can the church say Amen the Passover Co and kill and lamb put it on the L on the doorpost when I see the blood I'll pass over you as a type as a sign as a shadow as a preparation of what to come that when you apply the token and I see that token on display I'll pass over you because judgment is about to flash through the [Applause] land each man living my Revelation not even knowing how his story fit into the great picture the great plan of God can the church say amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah and we know about a day of atonement when the high priest would offer sin offering for himself and the people hallelujah what a moment it was brother a poell when he had the bells that were ringing so the people know he still alive and I don't know at what point but the Geor they learn to tie him with a rope Hallelujah so that if they don't hear the bells they know to pull the man out they know that the man was dead on the inside and the offering was not accepted and every year they had to do this over and over and over praying Lord will you forgive us we are broken people we are needy people we need something and they went through that process day of atonement daily offering birth offering consecration of the Alters hallu even Elijah when he was there when not Mount Carmel Showdown Hallelujah before he went to pull out the great big bazooka brother Clarence Hallelujah after he tease them and say well maybe you're God on vacation maybe you're God on in in down down the island somewhere and they Elijah offered to God he repaired The Altar and he offered a sacrifice he said why limp ye between two opinions why you want to be in the world and you want to be a believer don't you know who you are choose you this day who you will serve and Elijah offered a sacrifice unto the Lord hallelujah let the God and answer by fire let that God be God and the fire of God dropped down and consumed the sacrifice may the Lord consume our sacrifice today Hezekiah during that time of the Passover celebration to renew the Covenant of God he he he he ordered sacrifices once more renewing their Covenant Hallelujah after returning from Exile Ezra led the children of Israel to offer sacrifice once more for the atonement of their sins the prophet Isaiah he foret told of the coming of the suffering servant nobody know what he was talking about and we'll read it who would be the sacrificial offering for the sins of the people throughout scripture Nehemiah for the dedication and the rejoicing of the dedication of the rebuilt wall he offered Thanksgiving sacrifices Lord I bringing a sacrifice just to thank you I am bringing a sacrifice to get something I

ask for healing yet but I thank you that you are a Healer I thank you a strong tower I thank you a sword and a mightly buck I thank you you're my shield you are my Mountain you are great reward you are Jehovah Gyra and even Jesus in teaching us how to pray he start by acknowledging the Majesty of God our Father who art in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven before he asks for anything some of us our prayer start with Lord give me give me give me give me give me give me give me give [Applause] me Lord I Comming into tonight because you

sounds good but push it further down inside the prayer Our Father who art in heaven Hallowed be thy name there's no name like your name your name is Holy your name is mighty at the sound of your name demons tremble at the sound of your name the graves tremble at the sound of your name the Earth shakes at the sound of your name can the church say Amen Our Father Who Art in Heaven you are higher and lifted up the Earth is the low come on now somebody help me this [Applause] morning all of that is part of your sacrifice you have to have the right approach to God God wants to bless you but you have to have your right approach to [Applause] God that would youil Jesus taught them how to pray Our Father you're not here on Earth Who Art in Heaven you're not on our level you are above us Hallowed be

manner our daily message this morning listen I'm not speaking to you this morning you know God wants you to hear some from him ignore me I'm a nobody I just want to be a microphone for God to speak I have nothing I have no message this morning I just want to be a mouthpiece with urance let God speak to your heart this morning to change your life so that you could be a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable [Music] service sacrifices for different reasons Hallelujah in 2 Samuel 24 David offered sacrifice to the Lord at the threshing floor to stop the plague Hallelujah Daniel engag in prayer and fasting as a form of spiritual sacrifice so when you're fasting that's a sacrifice in the old days but George sister June in the old days people used to pray and fast every week it was a normal thing was a normal thing every weekall now to remind people have to remind people you to we have pray and FAS and I forget you forget it means you lost the value of the thing you know because think that really why you didn't forget your last flight why you didn't forget you supposed to go on vacation why didn't forget to go and collect your paycheck you didn't forget that somebody tell you they had the money for you for the longest while until you come tomorrow and you they come 7:00 in the morning and you wake up at 9:00 I forget that that don't happen know 6:30 you they bouncing you eat your doubles and thing and you they waiting I'm not a morning personl all of a sudden you're a morning person because you want it your boss still you have a big a big special gift for you comes 3:00 in the morning people let do all kind of thing for what they think is important and they sacrifice people listen I people set two threee alarm and thing because they going to New York and they flying to here or there and they don't want to miss the flight they set up four alarm 301 302 303 304 to just make sure they have they don't want to miss this flight they late for everything else you know they never on time but the day the airport pulling the luggage and brother before they B plan the accent change because in the spirit of this thing they going away they even but Andrew they even reach back to tr on the plane can I have a soda they reach the St yes you know they 2 minutes from piao but they so one the thing and the want this sacrifice get up early I and the close early pack the bag because it it is important to them and when it comes to the things of God it's like a crank it's like a in the old days you're turning the ice cream and turning turning turning wake up wake up wake up wake up in the morning wake up time to go wake up yeah up yet wake up you have to recalibrate that's why the Bible says be transformed by the renewing of your mind your thinking has to change about these things of God can the church say Amen is this helping anybody this morning could you take some [Applause] more Daniel fasting and praying I believe it was brother yadel spoke about the Widow's might when he preached the last time here and and it's really interesting because Jesus I want you to appreciate Jesus went to the temple many times but there only a few stories captured about Jesus in the temple read it in the Bible and of all the places brother George that Jesus decided to stand up to watch and monitor was the offering basket and he was watching what people put in in that is how we could understand this Widow who come and say but this woman amen Amen on that day he didn't choose to stand by the altar to see who was praying you he was searching Hearts he say that widow woman put more than all them who have because she put something that cost her anybody with me this morning so over the Old Testament we know that all through the Old Testament was small small pieces of what would be gathered up in that perfect sacrifice they had burnt offerings they had sin offerings trespass offerings peace offerings grain offerings drink offerings first fruit offerings these were all different offerings Hallelujah and he couldn't just sacrifice any in anywhere we talk about acceptable sacrifice we see it in the New Testament and we see God rejecting Cain's sacrifice so when you had to bring a sacrif with the Cur for your your sins amen amen the lamb that was presented was presented and it had to be inspected for a few things it had to be without blemish that's right without any physical defects so in other words you couldn't just say well let me just grab a lamb and carry it for the high priest you had to check and make sure you was getting the right kind of lamb as a type of the perfect lamb that had to be killed in your place anybody with me so that's why the B will always say Don't just come to church now pray up the service before you come to the service and when it come into the service Pray Again in other words don't just grab a lamb I I going to church and know no no no you're checking to make sure your lamb in order you checking your life in order first you're checking your attitude in order you're checking your you're doing a self inspection before the word gets to in oh God somebody help you before the word gets to inspect you because after you inspected your lamb the priest had to inspect the lamb because the priest will be just as guilty if he offered a lamb that was not properly inspected and wasn't qualified to be offered up to represent you so it's double inspection anybody with me this morning and we know Jesus perfectly typed out that when he came he was sinless Without Blame Lamb of God perfect pure innocent the lamb had to be a male in some instances the lamb in Exodus 13:2 it said the lamb needed to be the firstborn so it wasn't like just grab something and let we go to church we this this kind of half attitude thing it needs to be important to you so you realize the gravity of the situation the lamb had to be offered willingly as a sacrifice that why the Bible say when you give don't give grudgingly I give I already given only because it's pressure but I already want to give it the lamb have to be offered willingly Hallelujah and the blood had to be used for the atonement the lamb serving as a substitute to take the place of The Sinner and the lamb to be accepted by God and that man who was being represented by the lamb had to lay his hand on the lamb to feel the life leave the lamb so he could feel the impact of what was supposed to be his life leaving can the church say amen and in so doing he would experience some level of Contrition some level of remorse some level of repentance and recogn but wait a minute this thing that now dead was supposed to be me boy Lord have mercy Lord I Thank you for your forgiveness don't want to ever take it for granted and yet still that man had to go and sin again and had to go and repent again and atone again because brother Bram taught us that that life on that lamb couldn't be trans transferred to that sinner but when Jesus died it made it possible for their life to be transferred to us in the form of the Holy Ghost so we could go and sin no more that a work of transformation could begin in our heart as a birth that will take us all the way from Faith to charity to the fullness of the Holy Ghost The Life of Christ itself seven Living Voices one perfect Holy Spirit can the church say Amen thank you Lord thank you Lord but I want to could could it take some more I know I'm say I may not be too long with I think I may have misspoke a little bit Hallelujah cuz the think the think eating nice huj maybe you're not enjoying it as much as me but I enjoying this thing because I was supposed to be dead Lord broke up all over the place but God's mercy kept me amen s storel God Mercy kept you you God Mercy called you you could be young you could be 10 years old or 90 years old in the house this morning God's mercy kept you and we have a reason to thank [Music] God so we talk a lot about sacrifices brother Andrew and the sacrific and the perfect sacrifice but the reality is Sister pier in the Old Testament you couldn't just offer a sacrifice it took a priest you had to go to the priest to offer the sacrifice on your behalf you couldn't just sacrif you priest had a role to Play Hallelujah but in the New Testament we hear that you you you are priest not just priest you're a royal priesthood Hallelujah and God had dropped that to Moses nobody understood what he's talking about when he said you'll be a kingdom of priests and that just laid dant for hundreds of years a kingdom of priest because the tribe of Judah the scepter was placed there in the tribe of Judah leadership and rulership and Authority was in the tribe of Judah the kings came out to the tribe of of Judah and the priest came out of the tribe of levite but when Jesus came the lion who was the lamb who was the king who was the priest who was the perfect lamb he United the lines of kingship and priesthood and made it possible for a new order called the king priests or the royal priesthood a group of people brother Andrew who would be both Kings and Priests Royal Authority and priesthood anointing that you could offer spiritual sacrifices not just offer sacrifices but yourself being a sacrifice also [Applause] woo you understand how the requirement change because those priests in those days couldn't be living sacrifices they couldn't offer themselves they could offer the lamb they could offer the turtle dove they could off offer up the ram they could offer up these things but you are different class of priests you a royal priesthood you could offer things but you could also offer yourself he said present your bodies also and that was say after you offer your praise and your offering and your tith and you're singing and your song he said come and offer yourself offer your body as a Living Sacrifice oh can the church say Amen only a king priest could do that only royal priesthood could do that only a holy people could do that that give the Lord a shout of Praise [Applause] [Music] somebody thank you Lord so to understand what God blended into this royal priesthood Hallelujah to be a priest you couldn't come from the tribe of Simeon or the tribe of God or the tribe of Ruben or the tribe of napali or the you couldn't come from the air you have to come from the TR Lite descendants of Aaron who was the first high priest Hallelujah but the georia couldn't walk into the priesthood you couldn't apply for the priesthood you couldn't submit your resume for the priesthood if the blood of Aaron wasn't in your oh come on now in your genealogy it was never ever going to be [Applause] qualified that's why the Bible can say which in times past will not a people but are now people because that royal king priest made it possible for a spiritual blood transfusion to make you eligible to join the [Applause] priesthood anybody with [Music] me you have a privilege the other tribes don't have you know the tribe of Reuben don't have this the tribe of oh come on now the tribe of Judah don't have this but you are royal [Applause] priesthood now spiritual descendants of Aaron than you Lord God by specific declaration in Exodus and numers said the levitical priesthood will come on Aon Hallelujah but what else is about these priests because it says you are a royal priesthood so can I talk about you Hallelujah can I talk about the priesthood that you belong to brother Andrew can I talk about the priesthood you belong to brother Ashby can I talk about the pries said you belong to brother Ian paulu a priest had to be consecrated Exodus 29 the priest underwent a rigorous process of consecration to wash away the dirt the grime the the elements anoint with holy oil and wearing sacred garments so we thank God for Grace you know because some of us we miss this memo somewhere and the garments that we wearing is not it shouldn't mean any Priest cover I hope this thing sinking a little bit you know because as a priest is supposed to be consecrated by the way you wash yourself you wash away things of the world you you go to school but you wash yourself after consecrate yourself separate yourself from the world the way you're dress so I want you the way you dress was important as a priest you would have been identified when you walk among the people through the different tribes they can identify what there goes a priest because the priest as he approached the tent as he approached they could see you they to wonder I wonder where the priest is anybody see the priest the priest was easy to identify because the priest dressed a certain way he didn't dress like the other tribes when the priest came you know it was the priest coming and that's why young people used supped to be different from the world why you so because you're going to a graduation you going dress like that I coming for well it's for school so so so you so you're no longer a priest so because it's a school thing and a work event you're no longer so you you hang up your pries thing for what a day or evening or three hours you can't just give up the pring you're born into the tribe of your it too late to change the ironic spiritual Blood Brother Steven that run running through your vein you're too late you're not in Ruben you're not in Judah you're in the tribe of levite I hope they sink so I hope this puts an end in 2023 to for non Priestly garments because you're a royal priesthood and this applies to everything including your WhatsApp profile and your Facebook profil and your Instagram profile Hallelujah with I can't tell it between you and the person next to you and the person in your school because you looking just like them I can't tell you a priest hallu and your school friends can't tell you even going to a church far less to be a priest Hallelujah because you trying to fit in like them so much because you don't have a revelation of who you are and you don't have a deeper understanding of the priesthood that you belong to because only as a priest you could offer sacrifice and outside of being a priest you could never offer the sacrifice so when you do that and you break the Priestly Covenant God can receive the sacrifice so you come to church we bring a sacrifice of praise and that's why you will say the offering come up like a stench not a sweet fragrance but that praise come up as a it it make God upset because it's a traditionall Jesus told that it's a tradition well I come to the church cuz every Sunday is church but God can't receive it because you have broken the Priestly Covenant of the royal priesthood that you belong to is this helping anybody this morning this may to be the kind of jump and Shout for Joy service but I trust that in some way something being said that helps you a priest was required to be holy Hallelujah maintain a high degree of Holiness and Purity they avoided Conta attack with certain unclean things and practices what practices are you avoiding because you are a priest do are there even things you avoid and this is not just for young people this is for everybody are you avoiding gossiping CU that's a thing to avoid it and backbiting and Malice and hate and you're supposed to avoid oughts and grudges and these things you know I people like to dig in the thing but they want to get incid a thing to do thing with it I see you look at him so you Vex with him you you know the question that comes after that why Vex with him and before you know it is a whole kind of is a spirit operating there but a priest wants to maintain a level of Holiness a level of Purity you want to avoid issues avoid things that pull you down take you out of the spirit you want to practice the presence of God you want to stay in the spirit you don't want anything that throws you out of that realm you want to live in there but the B said I wish I could have this all the time that's what the prophet said I wish I could have it all the time I don't want to come out of his presence the S is David say cast me not away from thy presence oh God I want to be in your presence all the time this is like a teaching service this morning to kind of close the I hope this helping you Amen brother Stephen Paul wonderful a priest that have a upright character moral Integrity uprightness they were held to a higher standard of conduct what Judah could get away with what Reuben can get away with what God can get away with what Naval can get away with as a priest you can get away with that because you held a higher standard you are called to intercede for yourself for your family for your house and you have to walk a certain way live a certain way act a certain way priests were expected to have a deep knowledge of the law of the word so they could rightly divide the word and even though Joshua wasn't a priest he told Joshua go to Joshua meditate on the word day and night and Joshua was not a priest how much more we as a royal priesthood should spend time studying the word so like Jesus we can say it is written it is written is also written you have to be able to speak the word to your situations and Priests were dedicated this morning I already feeling this thing or know you're dedicated you're showing up because you know you're called to this thing you're feeling down much time over come and you feeling sick much time say I don't know if I can make it to pre today you know and then I look and he's in the Pulpit there time like Dad why you didn't tell me he wasn't feeling well you say I'm the pastor dedicated to the responsibility you're a father you have to be dedicated to being a good father your mother dedicated to being a good mother I have feeling to be father today I feeling to be mother how feeling no you head of your home you're high priest of your home you lead home a certain way you can't just lose your cool because you the priest in your house as a young person you are priest also we are royal priesthood can the church say Amen could you take some more but the Clarence they keep coming all hold but Clarence accountable I will stop and clar stop priest were intercessors you have to have a prayer life you are priest and you can't remember when you really pray you don't have a routine of prayer you don't have a discipline of prayer you don't have a time when you decide well in the morning in the middle of the day in the evening the night time before I go to sleep I want to speak to the Lord that's what is expected of a priest priests were on a rotating schedule to ensure that the temple was maintained today they they had to be available to report for Duty priest had to be faithful and throughout all the Old Testament as we are saying all this was imperfect operations because none of these priests with the Terran could have been perfect they all had their imperfections their sacrifices although it helped cover the sin it couldn't remove the sin it was a imperfect sacrifice performed by imperfect priests under an imperfect system but God is a perfect God so when he walked the Earth he said be therefore perfect as your father in Heaven is perfect so God has got a Perfection so all of the imperfection that existed in the Old Testament was temporary leading to a season of perfection when the perfect lamb would walk the earth to do the perfect sacrifice for people who would be brought to Perfection by A Perfect atonment anybody with me this morning so we can have a perfect praise a perfect worship Hallelujah somebody give the Lord a praise hallah and although they had the word brother Terence throughout the years when Jesus came the perfect Lamb of God they didn't recognize him throughout scripture when Isaiah was here Isaiah described it young people take note in Isaiah 537 the Bible says here he was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he was brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before her sharers is dumb so he open up his mouth he was taken from prison and from judgment and who shall declare his generation eration for he was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people was he stricken all as the new brother cents and while the mystery of Christ is unfolding nobody within the spiritual High class of the day say my with but this is the Fulfillment of this thing Isaiah 53:10 yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him he had put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand all of this Isaiah said brother Shan that those in that day could have looked and seen even after Jesus death the same but this thing lining up with scripture so it goes to show people could have books and tapes and messages and fail to see what's unfolding before them before their very eyes Isaiah 53:12 therefore will I divide him a portion with the great and he shall divide a spoil with the strong because he had poured out his soul unto death and he was numbered with the transgressors and he bear the sin of many and many intercession for the transgressors all that is in Isaiah anybody who was a spiritual student could say but wait a minute if I go back to that thing but everything I see in here looking like this thing and yet still they rejected the perfect lamb through the book of Psalms all the way back to the time of David brother Anthony Psalms 22:16 and 18 for dogs have compassed me the Assembly of the wicked have enclosed me they pierce my hands and my feet so nobody say but all remember David talk about piercing hands and feet I may tell all my bones they look and stay upon me they part my garments among them Hallelujah and cast lots upon my vest can the church say amen and from the moment John the Baptist saw him what did John say Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world in the message he identified Masterpiece of God brother brandham said here he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquity he was a lamb the Lamb of God the perfect sacrifice there never been nobody lived like him never has been nobody since live like him he was the perfect Masterpiece matched God's word exactly God in the beginning give his word a portion of this part for that time for that part for that part there's where men are so deceived and confused today they're trying to build on something that happened 40 50 years ago that was give for that age what good would it had done Moses come with Enoch's message what good would it have done Moses to come with Noah's message what good would it come Jesus with Moses message see and what good would have done Wesley to come with Luther's message what good would it have done the Pentecost to come with Wesley message see what I mean it's all looted here in the Bible and we've got to know the age and the hour and what's for us and there is where we are failing today we are reading everything else but the Bible this is the day that we should be living this is the day that God has placed us here let's look in the word that's how they fail to see Jesus those Pharisees and Sadducees herodians the different organizations of the day had it fixed and so perfectly fixed there was no way of Escape they taught in other words they had it all figured out but when he come he was different from all of them through it he was little humble fellow born in a manger which supposed to be an illegitimate child and all these things but yet he come exactly the way the scripture said he would come and there was a accustomed to what Moses said and Moses spoke of him and he said well if you would have known Moses you would have known me so in other words he didn't really know Moses in other words you ready to know this Prophet message because if you know this Prophet message you would know what should be said and done in this time and this season can the church say Amen you have Moses books but you don't know what to do with it you reading Moses course but you don't know how to live it and if you know Moses you would have known me can the Church Say Amen Moses spake of me and still they could see it just so twisted up in their Traditions until they couldn't see it but you see he didn't come to reflect them organization of that day he didn't come to reflect sectarian religion he came to reflect the father and the father was the word but the said now I feel religious he come to reflect the father's word God said he would be there and there he was the perfect Masterpiece of God's Great handiwork Oh my he was the perfect reflection of him he reflected everything that God had spoke of he reflected what Adam said about him he reflected about all the prophets said all the Patriarchs said everything he said he was a fulfillment of the word all types was fulfilled in him yeah he became Jehovah of the Old Testament he was the Old Testament Jehovah the word then which was the pillar of fire was made manifest and dwelt Among Us Jehovah of the Old Testament became Jesus of the New Testament uh he was a perfect reflection of God oh if the church today could just reflect that first church when the Holy Ghost fell on the day of Pentecost if the Christian today would reflect can the church say Amen in the church ages the Ephesian Church age brother Clarence how we doing good all right God's intention for his creation man is to express his words Hallelujah so God's intention for you and I is to express his words so when you walk it's supposed to be an expression of his word when you go to work it's an expression of your his word when you come to church you are expressing his word and in Genesis Adam was given the word to live by a life lived by the word would be the word expressed can the church say Amen that is true is it not I'm reading the prophet's word but did Adam live by that word no because he was to live by every word and he failed to take heed to every word then there arose Moses what a great and mighty man he was yet he also failed to live by every word and that Prophet the type of the great prophet to come failed in Anger to obey the word and there was also David the great king of Israel a man after God's Own Heart he failed by adultery when he was tempted but eventually in the fullness of time there came one the head even Jesus who also must be tempted to see if he would live by every word that proceeded out of the mouth of God then was Satan foiled then was Satan finished for here was one who lived by it is written and the Masterpiece of God overcame by reflecting God's word then was that manifested perfect one given to the Cross as the perfect Lamb of God for the perfect sacrifice can the church sayen and on the tree he received the wounds unto death that we by him and because of him might eat of the tree of life oh can the church say Amen because he died we could eat from the Tree of Life aren't you happy this morning to know that because of him because he was wounded because he died we could eat of the tree of life and then that life freely given would enable us to overcome that life of the popwell not my life not my works not my ability but that life his life freely given would allow you and I to overcome the lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh the pride of life his life his holy life the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost [Music] itself listen to the words of this Vindicated Prophet would any able us to overcome and express the word of God so Hallelujah so you are already an expression of the word but through the life of God you will continue to express the very word oh every promise every word that was spoken all that was in the Old Testament Jehovah of the old became Jesus of the new and all of the prophecies that came then was to be wrapped up in an elect lady called The Bride of Jesus Christ and through his life we become a very expression of the word the prophet goes on and now to these sons of God who by him overcome and are given the privilege of the paradise of God and the constant Fellowship of Jesus Christ what a promise to be in constant fellowship with the Lord Jesus Christ there will never be any more separation from him whether he goes his bride will go what is his he shares with his beloved on a joint air relationship the secret things will be revealed the dark things will be made plain we shall know as we are known and we shall be like him this is the heritage of the Overcomer who has overcome by the blood of the lamb and the word of testimony to Jesus Christ he is talking about living sacrifices now how we long for that day I'm almost finished when the Crooked roads will all all be straightened woo Hallelujah when the Crooked RADS will all be straightened and we will be with him time Without End May that day hasten it to parents and may we hasten to obey his wordu and thereby prove hallelujah our worthiness to share his glory you appreciate the Lord this morning just a few minutes more the musician could begin to get ready so that perfect lamb was selected presented at the altar that lamb took our place that blood was made available to us so that we could have access to his divine presence access to his holy ghost access to a new life what was not transferable from those Lambs in the Old Testament that were killed and it couldn't be transferred the blood that was shed in the Old Testament with a pup well could only cover sins but this Blood by this man Christ Jesus wasn't coming to just cover sins it was coming to eradicate sin to destroy sin completely oh Hallelujah we didn't need to go from covering to covering and wait for another day of atonement and another evening sacrifice and another burnt offering but by one sacrifice he had perfected forever Glory [Applause] Hallelujah no longer covering your sin but washing your sin away destroying your sin but you drop you you you drop it into bleach it destroys it completely that's how this Blood operates you get dipped in the blood covered by his blood he sees you through the blood and he sees you as a Victorious son daughter of God can the church Give the Lord a hand of [Music] [Applause] Praise And every type of offering that was offered in the Old Testament Jesus fulfilled every kind of offering sin offering he became the offering for sin burnt offering he became the burnt offering the Passover Lamb brother Clarence which is started there in Egypt he was the Passover Lamb the atonement offering on the day of atonement he was the atonement offering the consecration offering uh he was the consecration offering uh the Thanksgiving offering Jesus was the Thanksgiving offering the meal offering the very bread of life offer thems oh come on now somebody help me preach the fellowship offering uh he was The Fellowship offering because by him we could be reconciled with perfect fellowship with [Applause] God hallelujah hallelujah in so much that by the time Jesus has left the scene you hear Paul speaking Purge out therefore the old 11av in First Corinthians that you may be a new lump as he and Le for even Christ Our Passover is sacrificed for us in other words Paul has to keep reminding them of who they are and and the old sacrifice not going to work no more and it's not necessary no more because this sacrifice already take place in Ephesians 2:52 and walk in love as Christ also had loved us and had given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling Savor so when your life is rotten and messed up that blood that was sacrificed for you and I offers a Savor that covers your filth that covers your wretchedness so it doesn't come up to God that way can the church say Amen Hebrews 10 10 by the which will we are Sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all 10:12 but this man this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever sat down on the right hand of God for by one offering he had perfected forever them that are Sanctified brother Brandon in the message the church and its condition a few years ago he said I'm going now in a few days to celebrate the falling of the Holy Ghost In America 50 years ago this year at the old Aza Street meeting Pentecostal meeting in Los Angeles where they had their first falling of the Holy Spirit when the people got together listen to this when Christ come down among those people they were just as gentle just as peaceful and to just think this was the Pentecostal birth this was just the open door age with Kang this was just a foraste of the real holy ghost that was to come that was to follow the perfect word the fullness of the word restored as a conductor for the whole Holy Spirit to move through they had just a taste of it amen just some gifts their lives would not transformed with a pop well because the fullness of the word wasn't revealed to bring a full transformation but God was showing that this Spirit thing is still real and the promise of the Holy Ghost that fell in the day of Pentecost was just as real today as it was then and through an Open Door age those in that day fell the power and listen to what the prophet saidu they live Godly lives he said they live sacrificial lives Hallelujah sacrificial lives talking about living sacrifices that when sacrificing your life you're giving up you don't care about the world no more you're giving you don't care what nobody say you don't care what your family say well you're boring and you don't want to enjoy the Christmas season I I will sacrifice that no problem I'm willing to pay that price because he died for me I'm willing to pay whatever price it takes because I want to be a Living Sacrifice I want a fragrance to come out from my life oh I want when I pass you know I'm a sacrifice of the Lord they were willing to give in listen to The Prophet they were willing to be led by the Holy Ghost they didn't care what the people said they were oldfashioned friends I'm happy to be called old fashioned sister Anna you must want to be called old fashioned it's not a embarrassment know Sister Naomi sister josha looking for all you it must be a compliment when they say but you old fashioned why you looking so old fashion say I come from the old time religion

old time singing them new singing them song they have can't take me to Heaven I want to make sure I go to heaven so if the price are going to heaven is calling me old fashion I'm willing to take that sacrifice I'm willing to endure the peer pressure but you don't wear makeup no I don't wear makeup God make me looking good already I don't need that if you need that that's you anybody help me this morning I want to be Anointed with the spirit of God I don't need to wear no tight clothes no worldly style and fashion you can't make me look better than God already made me somebody help me preach if if you insecure with how you look that's your business but I know I'm fearful and wonderfully made I don't need no validation anybody with me in the house this [Applause] morning if you study the history of all them makeup and thing you'll be embarrassed you know if you go the history of where all them eye thing and your eye long long and your hating and all that kind of foolishness you'll be embarrassed you know because everything have a history everything have a beginning everything have a foundation Hallelujah but but a punch I want to start here today there's but say a next service but say he had to talk to we had time for today for this one out that's our whole next service that Jezebel spirit imagine I hear a Pentecostal preacher preaching The Jezebel spirit in a Pentecost church and I looking at conation I say well you have your work cut out for you you now start working but we who are believers who have seen this glorious light of this message and I'm the privileged to be called to such a time as this don't lower your standard Young Brother don't lower your standard young sister you are a royal priest you are a royal priest you are are King priest you are high [Music] calling you are called for greatness can the church say Amen you may see that thing brother said it sometime ago when they had the last big thing in for the Queen of England or whatever and you watch how all the prince of Denmark and the princess of this place and the prince of this place not one person dress IM modestly all the royalty dressed with class and dignity you can't embarrass them their pocket so deep deep deep they could go past the ground they could buy what they want they could buy the best style and fashion but they choose to dress like a queen they choose it's their choice they're not being forced to do it they willingly dress a certain way because they understand that they are royalty but if you understand this morning that you are royal priesthood you should be so happy to look like a Christian talk like a Christian speak like a [Applause] Christian you may be seated you ever hear the queen or the king of England cuss out somebody Hallelujah it almost sounds impossible to hear because the concept the way it's portrayed they they are above that you never see was he it's Prince William is next in line after Charles right William you see you ever see William playing Carnival somewhere what's his wife is William and Kate Kate playing with tribe and and Kate on who Zuma but punch what's you know Zuma you think Kate will leave the palace in England to come and and dance on the street of Trinidad it sounds farfetched because she understands that she's next in line for the throne and because of this there are people around her who say when you you eat put the fork this way and and the knife this way because because of who you are you represent a kingdom and that's a natural Kingdom and this morning you represent a kingdom that cannot be moved that cannot be shaken and you want to be embarrassed to dress like a king embarrassed to dress like a queen get out of here with that foolishness I come from God I'm going back to God thank God for a perfect sacrifice that will make way for living sacrifices holy and acceptable unto the [Applause] lordu I'm finishing Hallelujah but the public say m Hallelujah but I think the message got home friends all the imperfect sacrifices were brought together in that perfect sacrif rice and on Calvary that was the final atonement and the veil was Ren from top to bottom that separated the people the people from accessing what is behind the veil because God knew that there was a people coming who would not need no high priest on the earth that Christ will become the high priest of our [Music] [Applause] confession you could be going to play something softly I'm finished wonderful praise godu so I'll close by just reading back the first scripture we read wherefore laying aside all malice let it die with you in 2023 brother sister and all gu guile means all deception all the pretending all the show and you know you I I'm talking to all of you especially the younger people you're dress looking they looking like you're in church today but on Instagram and Tik Tok and Facebook and think he's a whole next person laying aside all G and hypocrisies because that's hypocrisy Hallelujah and envies and all evil speakings as newborn babies desire the sincere milk of the word it must be a desire to you just like a baby is crying on for milk that you may grow thereby in other words this gospel to you must be like milk to a baby that's what he's saying all a baby wants is milk a baby don't want steak and salmon and chicken and rice the baby just want milk so as a newborn babe with that cry saying I want something to live on I want something I want something I want something I want something as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word you can't go and put a set of thing in milk any good mother with say I want to be as natural as possible I want to breastfeed I want to get the nearest thing as possible I don't want no chemicals inside of there I don't want nothing to stun the child grow I don't want anything will make your child sick I want the best that what sincere milk of the word pure [Music] milk if so be ye tasted that the Lord is gracious in other words if you taste that the Lord is gracious in your life this is how we should live is this your testimony this morning to whom coming as unto a living Stone disallowed indeed of men but chosen of God and precious in other words young people this Stone this living Stone Mando don't want it your school teacher will not want it disallowed indeed of men men will not allow it one day we will not be allowed to preach Hallelujah in schools today they have the same sex thing all in these school books to normalize Sodom and Gomorrah yes and if you tell them you want to pray or teach your Bible or teach something else they don't want it but bam said years ago America rejected God hallelujah but ye in verse 5 also as Lively Stones so here we have God animating what is not normally animated cuz a sacrifice is normally dead but he said Living Sacrifice and he said Lively Stone a stone ready to be alive and a sacrifice should be alive but you call Living Sacrifice and Lively Stone I built up a spiritual house and holy priesthood Hallelujah to do what to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ young people you are called to offer spiritual sacrifice don't take your voice and use it to sing worldly songs sing songs unto the Lord don't take your voice to say the words is saying out there say the things that will be pleasing to God and make sure you are offering your spiritual sacrifice I'm done I'm just closing outall Hallelujah wherefore also it is contained in the scripture behold I lay in Zion a Chief Cornerstone elect precious and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded friends your belief on this gospel you will not be confused you will not be confounded you will not be you you you wouldn't be uncertain of where you stand unto you therefore which believe he is precious is he precious to you this morning oh Lord you are so precious to me unto you that believe he is precious but unto them which be disobedient the stone which the builders disallowed the same is made head of the corner in other words every knee will bow every tongue will confess that Jesus is Lord friends the world could reject him because they are for ordained to reject him but you rejecting him is a whole different story friends he goes into verse 8 and a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense in other words plenty people come to church and they say well boy Isaac just just just say things to get upset I really have to stop that and is a stumbling it's an offense you feel offended yes it's an offense you shouldn't have no minis skirt in your closet burn it if that offend you this is the scripture that gives me the covering but the parents and a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense the worldly music that doesn't belong to you burn it God will make you break your phone so you can't listen to it thank you find that kind of rough but say he could break your foot and put in a wheelchair he say love Spirit conditions will don't wait till the conditions have to force you to come back to the house of [Music] God if love don't get you to turn your heart around God will send conditions that's why so many people find God in the hospital and they find God on their dead bed and they find God in these places because it takes the corrective love of God to drive them back to say My Father who art in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come hallu thank you Lord thank you friends don't wait till back against a wall and the doctors say they don't know what to do for you to acknowledge that he is your Redeemer he is your savior and he paid the price that you could have life and have it more abundantly and have an opportunity to walk without sin and have Divine access to the Rapture the Resurrection the new city the wedding supper and a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense even to them which stumble at the word that people this morning oh gosh just just preach my happy friends the word is to bring you with joy but it is corrective for you to line up and see when you look in the mirror you see Jesus looking back at you I want to be made whole I want to be a Living Sacrifice I Want My Sacrifice to be accepted I don't want God to say I don't want that sacrifice I don't want God to say I have no respect for brother Isaac sacrifice I want to make sure I bring a sacrifice that is accepted acceptable unto the Lord after all these years for God to say depart from me you workers of iniquity I never knew you that's what the Bible says you know many will come in there say Lord Lord I've done all of this for you and God say depart from me in other words I don't accept your [Music] offering it doesn't qualify because you mix it with your own thing so much it didn't make the sweet enough of a fragrance for me hallu and Stone of stumbling and a rocket offense even to them which stumble at the word being disobedient where unto also they were appointed in other words just like dayon and Kora they are those who are appointed unto Disobedience they will never see this gospel they will never receive this message you can bring it the church all the time but they are predestinated to destruction and that's why you should be so happy that you are predestinated unto adoption you are predestinated to the Holy Ghost you are predestinated to make it and then Paul says but ye are Peter rather says but ye are chosen generation Hallelujah chosen above every other people chosen above other families chosen go can to call anybody 1.5 million people in this country and God chose you and [Music] I billions in in this
