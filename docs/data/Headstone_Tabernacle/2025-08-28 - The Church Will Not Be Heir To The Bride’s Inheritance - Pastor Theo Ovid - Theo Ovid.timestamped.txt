[37:37] Lord Jesus. Oh God, we love you tonight

[37:59] May God bless you and welcome. And if
[38:01] you have your Bibles, I like you to turn
[38:02] to Galatians chapter 3. You want to read
[38:05] from 13 to 18 and Galatians chapter 4
[38:09] verse 27-31.
[38:13] I didn't know I'll be in this tonight,
[38:14] but that's what I got for tonight. And
[38:17] we're going to read from Galatians
[38:19] chapter 3, reading from verse 13. It
[38:22] reads, "Christ has redeemed us from the
[38:24] curse of the law,
[38:26] being made a curse for us. For it is
[38:29] written, cursed is everyone that hangeth
[38:31] on a tree, that the blessings of Abraham
[38:35] might come on the Gentiles through Jesus
[38:37] Christ, that we, here we go, might
[38:41] receive the promise of the spirit
[38:43] through faith.
[38:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:45] &gt;&gt; Brethren, I speak after the manner of
[38:47] men, though it be but a man's covenant,
[38:51] yet if it be confirmed, no man disanol
[38:55] it or add it there unto. In other words,
[38:57] if man humans make a covenant and
[39:00] confirm it, nobody could acknowledge it
[39:01] or act to it.
[39:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:03] &gt;&gt; Now to Abraham and to his seed were the
[39:06] promises made. He saith not unto seeds
[39:09] as of many, but as of one, and to thy
[39:12] seed, which is Christ. And this I say
[39:16] that the covenant that was confirmed
[39:18] before of God in Christ the law which
[39:20] was 430 years after cannot disol that it
[39:25] should make the promise of none effect.
[39:27] &gt;&gt; For if the inheritance be of the law, it
[39:29] is no more promise. But God giveth to
[39:32] Abraham by promise.
[39:35] &gt;&gt; And let's go over to Galatians chapter
[39:37] 4. We're going to look at verse 27.
[39:41] All right. For it is written, rejoice
[39:44] thou barren that breakkest not, break
[39:46] forth and cry. Thou that travalest not,
[39:49] for the desolate had many more children
[39:52] than she which hath an husband. Now we,
[39:55] brethren, as Isaac was, are the children
[39:57] of promise. But as then he that was born
[40:02] after the flesh persecuted him that was
[40:06] born after the spirit, even so it is
[40:09] now.
[40:10] Nevertheless, what saith the scripture?
[40:13] &gt;&gt; Cast out the bond woman and her son,
[40:16] &gt;&gt; for the son of the bond woman shall not
[40:18] be heir with the son of the free woman.
[40:21] &gt;&gt; So then, brethren, we are not children
[40:22] of the bond woman, but of the free.
[40:24] &gt;&gt; May God bless his word. You may be
[40:26] seated.
[40:27] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. We
[40:28] thank God for his word tonight.
[40:30] &gt;&gt; Scriptures and the promises. Now uh
[40:32] Sunday we spoke about now as as that the
[40:36] heir as long as he's a child defth
[40:39] nothing or from a servant though he be
[40:41] lord of all but under two and governors
[40:44] until the time appointed by the father.
[40:46] &gt;&gt; So we see here in this scripture Paul
[40:49] identifying what the heir is to do how
[40:51] the air is to response the respond and
[40:54] what the heir is under. So we find out
[40:56] and we said it that every air must pass
[40:59] through tutors and governors. Now
[41:02] Abraham didn't have one son yet another
[41:04] son through Hagga. Isn't that right?
[41:07] &gt;&gt; And that is the church that entwined
[41:10] with the bride. And that is where the
[41:12] two spirits will be so close in the last
[41:14] days. They'll be sitting in the same
[41:15] congregation.
[41:17] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. Never heard
[41:18] that before, right?
[41:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. So every
[41:21] ear must pass through tutors and
[41:24] governance. So all those people that are
[41:26] staying home not going to church and
[41:28] figure this. Some prophets, some
[41:30] teachers, some pastors, some
[41:32] evangelists, some prophets, some
[41:35] teachers, some pastors, some
[41:37] evangelists, not no man said. This is
[41:39] God said that.
[41:41] &gt;&gt; Then he give into the speaking with
[41:42] tongues, interpretation with tongues,
[41:44] knowledge, wisdom, and all kind of
[41:46] miracles.
[41:47] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right?
[41:49] &gt;&gt; But Jesus said, he that receives them
[41:52] that I send receives me. And now them
[41:54] that he sent and then them that received
[41:57] me receive him that sent me. Wish we had
[41:59] time to linger on that. Then he said
[42:01] this word, you can only serve God as you
[42:05] do and believe the servants that God
[42:08] sends. You can only serve God on earth
[42:12] as God's servants that are sent on earth
[42:15] by divine inspiration interpret the word
[42:18] to you.
[42:19] &gt;&gt; That's the way you could only serve God.
[42:21] So God have to send men servants
[42:23] &gt;&gt; and and as they invi divinely interpret
[42:26] the word then they could correctly serve
[42:28] God.
[42:29] &gt;&gt; They that worship him must worship him
[42:30] in spirit
[42:32] &gt;&gt; and in truth.
[42:33] &gt;&gt; So truth have to come forth that you
[42:35] could understand how God ought to be
[42:36] worshiped
[42:37] &gt;&gt; because men does worship and make
[42:38] anything their God. They think they
[42:40] worshiping God. He said in vain do you
[42:42] worship me teaching for doctrines the
[42:44] commandments of men. So you have to hear
[42:46] the word of God from the mouth of God.
[42:48] And God send a prophet that we could get
[42:50] from the mouth. And that's why he said
[42:51] the spirit, the prophet and the bride
[42:53] will say the same thing. And what they
[42:54] say would have already been said in the
[42:56] word. So you have to hear from the mouth
[42:58] of God. Praise God. And the mouth of God
[43:00] is his prophets. Isn't that right? Do
[43:02] you believe that?
[43:03] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. So you can only serve
[43:06] God as you do and believe God's servants
[43:09] that are sent on earth by divine
[43:11] inspiration interpret the word to you.
[43:14] Hallelujah.
[43:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:16] &gt;&gt; Who would President Kennedy be tonight
[43:17] if he wasn't President Kennedy? He was
[43:18] the same man. He if he was a worker that
[43:20] worked in Colgates for $40 a week, he'd
[43:23] come down the street and nobody would
[43:24] pay attention to him, only his own
[43:26] associates. But being he's a president,
[43:28] he deserves respects. And that is
[43:31] because God is God. He deserves
[43:32] respects.
[43:34] &gt;&gt; And you have got to respect him and give
[43:36] fear to him. And that brings respects.
[43:39] And God has demanded that for himself
[43:41] and for all his servants. God demands
[43:44] respects for his servants. And how do we
[43:47] know they are his servants? Because he
[43:49] vindicates these servants by his word.
[43:53] He take these servants and makes them
[43:55] servants of God
[43:57] &gt;&gt; and prove they are servants by making
[43:59] his word work through them servants.
[44:02] &gt;&gt; Then as you respect
[44:05] that servant, you respect God. So when I
[44:08] respect you and you respect me and we
[44:11] respect each other, then we are
[44:13] respecting God.
[44:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen and amen. Do you believe
[44:17] that?
[44:18] &gt;&gt; Now today he's alive. Watch. He is still
[44:21] proving himself by his word. He is God.
[44:24] And then this word is allotted here for
[44:26] this day. There's got to be somebody
[44:28] come back. Here we go. That that word
[44:31] can become quickened and make that word
[44:33] live.
[44:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the scriptur is laying dormant
[44:36] until somebody step forward
[44:38] &gt;&gt; and that would be quickened
[44:40] &gt;&gt; and that would begin to live.
[44:42] &gt;&gt; So the title tonight is the church will
[44:43] not be heir to the bride's inheritance.
[44:47] &gt;&gt; That's the title. Church will not be
[44:48] heir to the bride's inheritance.
[44:51] &gt;&gt; And now you can see why because the
[44:53] church will be doing their own thing
[44:55] &gt;&gt; and the bride will be under tutors and
[44:57] governance
[44:58] &gt;&gt; until the time appointed by the father.
[45:00] And our type is Queen Esther that was
[45:02] under guidance under the Modai
[45:05] &gt;&gt; that she could get to go in the presence
[45:06] of the king when he didn't call for her.
[45:09] &gt;&gt; But she had faith and confidence because
[45:11] he told her you have to do something.
[45:13] You can't just sit. You can't be in
[45:14] inertia. Praise God. Action is caused.
[45:17] Inertia just happens. And inertia is
[45:19] when you're in the same position all the
[45:21] time. Yeah. Moving. When you continue
[45:23] along a line all the time, you're not
[45:24] moving. But when something and the only
[45:27] way to break that inertia is when
[45:28] something interrupted
[45:30] &gt;&gt; something external
[45:32] &gt;&gt; some force from outside that's why he
[45:34] said the people is not desperate it love
[45:36] should get you desperate if love don't
[45:38] get you desperate conditions will so
[45:40] conditions is the external force to get
[45:42] you out of your lethagi out of your
[45:44] sluggishness out of your laziness out of
[45:46] whatever you in that is what comes from
[45:48] external something happen on the outside
[45:50] that you wasn't catering for
[45:52] &gt;&gt; and it shake you and move you out of the
[45:54] pivot that you're in.
[45:56] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right?
[45:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:59] &gt;&gt; So, tomorrow begins our three-day prayer
[46:01] fast as we seek the Lord for a
[46:03] breakthrough and deliverance and healing
[46:05] and everything else. Amen.
[46:07] &gt;&gt; Oh, let's go. Tonight,
[46:09] the church will not be heir to the
[46:12] bride's inheritance.
[46:15] &gt;&gt; All right.
[46:18] &gt;&gt; He said the seed of the bond woman Sarah
[46:21] doubted God's word. God was able to keep
[46:23] it. Notice Abraham, do you see what I'm
[46:25] I'll skip. Notice natural. It cannot be
[46:29] neither can the natural be heir with the
[46:31] spiritual. No more can Ishmamail's
[46:34] children be heir with Isaac's children.
[46:36] No more than the carnal can be the air
[46:38] with the spiritual. And I want you to
[46:39] see this tonight. This is something that
[46:41] is really blew up to me. Church natural.
[46:45] Church spiritual.
[46:47] &gt;&gt; There's a church natural and there's a
[46:49] church spiritual.
[46:50] &gt;&gt; And they cannot be hes together. Amen.
[46:53] &gt;&gt; They are two different separate times,
[46:56] two different separate peoples, two
[46:58] different separate covenant.
[47:01] &gt;&gt; And this is the bomb. That is why the
[47:05] rapture is different.
[47:08] &gt;&gt; And will only be for the royal seed of
[47:11] Abraham.
[47:13] &gt;&gt; So now we come to the rapture now
[47:15] &gt;&gt; and the message of when rapture not not
[47:17] so fast.
[47:18] &gt;&gt; Not so fast. It cannot come by the
[47:22] natural carnal seed of the church.
[47:25] &gt;&gt; It will have to be the royal seed of the
[47:29] word of God
[47:30] &gt;&gt; through Abraham. The royal seed. That is
[47:33] why the rapture has to be first.
[47:35] &gt;&gt; So he is putting this rapture as an
[47:37] exclusive bride promise
[47:40] &gt;&gt; an inheritance
[47:42] &gt;&gt; heirs to the rapture.
[47:43] &gt;&gt; Isn't that something else? Amen.
[47:45] &gt;&gt; Then he said, "We are alive and remain
[47:46] shall not hinder them asleep. For the
[47:48] trumpet shall sound, the dead in Christ
[47:49] shall rise. Therefore, they will not be
[47:51] hes together. They will not be in the
[47:53] rapture together."
[47:57] &gt;&gt; This is serious tonight.
[47:59] &gt;&gt; The church natural, the church
[48:02] spiritual, the church carnal, the church
[48:05] spiritual. Now she's this is ahead of
[48:08] bringing it. She is now dry shock. It's
[48:11] the spirit of God passed through her.
[48:13] Yes,
[48:14] &gt;&gt; that is true. So the testimony just like
[48:17] King Saul and brother Isaac preach on
[48:19] it. The rise and fall of King Saul, he
[48:22] have testimony of the witness, testimony
[48:24] of the anointing, testimony of the
[48:26] prophet anointed him. All kind of
[48:28] testimonies. The spirit passed through.
[48:34] &gt;&gt; There's no denial.
[48:36] &gt;&gt; There's no question about the spirit
[48:38] passing through.
[48:40] &gt;&gt; No dispute about that. The spirit of God
[48:42] passed through. He say it's true. And
[48:45] will she will not be air with the
[48:48] vindicated seed word.
[48:51] &gt;&gt; She sure will not be.
[48:53] &gt;&gt; Hear it. She will not be in the rapture.
[48:56] &gt;&gt; That's an absolute term.
[48:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; So when we talking about son and air, we
[49:02] had to had to see tonight what we are
[49:03] heir to.
[49:05] &gt;&gt; It is your inheritance.
[49:06] &gt;&gt; It is what Jesus died for.
[49:08] &gt;&gt; It is. That's why we in church tonight.
[49:11] This is what we fighting for. Not to go
[49:13] down in a bomb shelter to shelter from
[49:15] the bombs that is coming, but to go in
[49:17] the rapture.
[49:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. To get rapturing faith and
[49:22] rapture in grace. Isn't that something?
[49:24] &gt;&gt; What Abraham says she'll not be in the
[49:26] rapture. She'll be a church member. May
[49:28] come up in the second resurrection. Be
[49:29] judged according to what she heard.
[49:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Look at those four
[49:35] patriarchs.
[49:37] Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph. Abraham
[49:40] calling Isaac election election. Isaac
[49:43] calling Jacob grace and the perfection.
[49:46] Nothing against him. That was God
[49:50] working its way out.
[49:53] &gt;&gt; And then he titled it what? Luther
[49:56] Wesley
[49:58] Pentecost the capstone.
[50:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout tonight.
[50:05] Luther, Wesley, Pentecost,
[50:09] &gt;&gt; the capstone
[50:11] &gt;&gt; and the church and the word become the
[50:13] same thing.
[50:14] &gt;&gt; God working its way out through
[50:17] processes.
[50:18] &gt;&gt; Because when the seed go down in the
[50:20] ground, it doesn't come back out as a
[50:21] seed.
[50:22] &gt;&gt; It come out as a stalk. It going through
[50:24] processes. The life of the seed unfolds
[50:28] through processes. And at the end of the
[50:30] processes it come back to the original
[50:32] seed which has the original life. Oh
[50:36] give the Lord some praises in the house.
[50:38] I am alpha and omega. The alpha and
[50:41] omega is the same.
[50:42] &gt;&gt; The seed in the beginning and the seed
[50:44] in the end is the same. The faith in the
[50:46] beginning and the faith in the ending is
[50:47] the same. Oh give the Lord a shout in
[50:50] the house. And that is why God sent a
[50:52] prophet to turn our hearts back to the
[50:54] original.
[50:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:57] [Music]
[50:59] Hallelujah.
[51:01] &gt;&gt; So what are you saying belove?
[51:05] &gt;&gt; But Abramham went out in his ministry
[51:09] &gt;&gt; knowing he was going to be rejected.
[51:14] &gt;&gt; So he couldn't God feeling feeling no
[51:16] God they going to love me because
[51:18] &gt;&gt; I'm praying for the sick and they'll be
[51:20] healed.
[51:21] &gt;&gt; I'm opening blind eyes. The deaf is
[51:23] hearing. The dumb is speaking. The dead
[51:25] has been raised up. everybody would love
[51:27] me.
[51:28] &gt;&gt; But a Brandon went through the
[51:29] experience of people saying if you go by
[51:30] that other church, we don't want you.
[51:33] &gt;&gt; He needed sponsorship because he didn't
[51:35] have the money to go here everywhere.
[51:36] And they were trying to manu uh
[51:39] manipulate him from from the sponsorship
[51:41] position.
[51:44] &gt;&gt; One time they tell me you have to go
[51:45] there. He said Lord tell them don't go.
[51:46] They say you have to go because we're
[51:47] paying for you. He said dust say this
[51:50] this whole will crash. Everybody get
[51:51] sick
[51:53] &gt;&gt; because they don't want to be led by the
[51:54] spirit. Amen.
[51:55] &gt;&gt; They want control.
[51:57] &gt;&gt; That is denomination.
[51:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:59] &gt;&gt; The spirit of man behind things.
[52:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So this bride
[52:05] wake up now.
[52:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:07] &gt;&gt; And that that why feel you have to take
[52:09] a seat. You know
[52:10] &gt;&gt; feel you have to go home. You know you
[52:11] have to come tough.
[52:13] &gt;&gt; You have to come a word believer.
[52:15] &gt;&gt; Your feelings got be hurt and somebody
[52:16] hurting you. You get you go get
[52:18] manipulated and lick up.
[52:22] Because the bride in the beginning was
[52:24] the word.
[52:25] &gt;&gt; Then if the bride is taken from the
[52:27] bridegroom, it must be the word also.
[52:31] &gt;&gt; Why must the bridegroom be the word
[52:33] manifested? And I think I preached not
[52:36] years ago. The bridegroom going to be
[52:37] the word manifested,
[52:39] &gt;&gt; not the word talking, not somebody have
[52:40] a spoken book in their hand and somebody
[52:42] playing tape day and night. Word
[52:44] &gt;&gt; manifested.
[52:46] &gt;&gt; But I ask the question, what is the
[52:47] father's business? To fulfill the word.
[52:49] Amen.
[52:50] &gt;&gt; You understand that?
[52:51] &gt;&gt; Jesus understood the father's business.
[52:53] So when he got the spirit upon him, he
[52:55] went and find the scripture
[52:57] &gt;&gt; and said, "This is the father's
[52:58] business. The spirit is upon me. He has
[53:00] anointed me to do this, to do that, to
[53:02] do the other. This is what I'm going to
[53:03] do now."
[53:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he said, "This day, what
[53:06] you read here is fulfilled."
[53:08] &gt;&gt; It is quickened to me so I can anoint it
[53:10] to myself.
[53:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. And he walk out of
[53:13] there rejected. They put him out, you
[53:15] know,
[53:16] &gt;&gt; they throw him out, you know, they
[53:18] reject the word
[53:20] &gt;&gt; and they will reject the word in the
[53:21] bride.
[53:23] &gt;&gt; Some message ago, I told you the church
[53:25] message people have to reject the bride
[53:27] first before the government come down on
[53:29] them.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Kyifers and all of them,
[53:34] hallelujah, have to reject the Messiah
[53:37] &gt;&gt; before they can bring hurried and sees
[53:38] all the whole bunch of them.
[53:40] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises. No
[53:42] pressure coming in, no pressure coming
[53:44] until the bride become the rejected.
[53:47] &gt;&gt; And to become the rejected, it means you
[53:49] have to become the seed,
[53:51] &gt;&gt; the royal seed.
[53:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout. It mean the
[53:55] hot July sun dry ups the shock
[53:58] &gt;&gt; in the message that the seed could get
[54:00] golden brown and dead, right?
[54:02] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the name of the Lord.
[54:04] Hallelujah. You ready tonight?
[54:06] &gt;&gt; You ready to be bright tonight?
[54:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:08] &gt;&gt; Hear the bright tonight. She is smitten
[54:09] from the church. Amen.
[54:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:13] &gt;&gt; From the church body.
[54:14] &gt;&gt; She is smitten with her master.
[54:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:17] &gt;&gt; For the same purpose.
[54:19] &gt;&gt; Because she is the word.
[54:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:21] &gt;&gt; Just as the same as Joseph was smitten
[54:24] from his brethren.
[54:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; Because he was the word.
[54:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:28] &gt;&gt; Jesus was smitten from his brethren
[54:30] because he was the word. The bride is
[54:32] smitten from the church because she is
[54:35] the word.
[54:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; There is a stages one, two, three. Just
[54:40] exactly
[54:41] &gt;&gt; the word living and in action.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; The Bible bride.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; Not some man-made bride. The Bible bride
[54:49] smitten and afflicted of God. No beauty
[54:51] we should desire. Can't you Pentecostal
[54:54] man see that? If the other was husk and
[54:56] died. If the other stalk had to die. If
[54:58] the tassel had to die, so the husk have
[55:01] to die. Stands alone.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; All of you can't stand alone. You have
[55:06] to stand alone. If you can't stand
[55:08] alone, take the side of the church.
[55:11] &gt;&gt; But the church don't inherit the rapture
[55:13] as inheritance.
[55:14] &gt;&gt; That's only for the bride.
[55:16] &gt;&gt; The bride stands alone like the
[55:17] bridegroom.
[55:18] &gt;&gt; Rejected of man,
[55:20] &gt;&gt; despised and rejected of the churches.
[55:23] &gt;&gt; I wonder if people ready for that.
[55:25] &gt;&gt; Ready for rejection.
[55:28] &gt;&gt; Brotherly kindness. I love you, brother.
[55:30] God bless you. Don't do nothing. You
[55:32] know,
[55:34] &gt;&gt; Jesus was the expression of love.
[55:35] Forgive the prostitute. Forgive the
[55:37] multitude, heal the sick, heal leper,
[55:39] all kind of thing. And they end in the
[55:40] crucify him.
[55:43] &gt;&gt; Week before, hosana, hosana, hosana.
[55:46] &gt;&gt; This is where the bride going to be at.
[55:49] &gt;&gt; The bride stands in that way. What is
[55:51] it? It's his masterpiece.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; Now hear the bum. Hear the bum. It's the
[55:56] word that he can work through, made
[56:00] manifest, rejected.
[56:02] Hallelujah.
[56:05] &gt;&gt; So we have text and scripture
[56:08] &gt;&gt; but the word have to become you.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; All the scripture Isaiah 61 was laying
[56:14] there all the time you know
[56:15] &gt;&gt; to heal the sick and raise the dead and
[56:17] everything else you know. But when Jesus
[56:19] came
[56:20] &gt;&gt; he was the word
[56:22] &gt;&gt; that God could work through.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; A virgin shall conceive. That was always
[56:27] in the Bible in Isaiah. Nobody can
[56:28] change it. It was always there. But when
[56:30] Mary came,
[56:30] &gt;&gt; hallelujah,
[56:31] &gt;&gt; she was the word
[56:33] &gt;&gt; that he could work through.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; So her birth brought that word to life.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; Now this prophecy, he shall turn the
[56:40] hearts of the children back to the faith
[56:42] of the father. You in there.
[56:47] &gt;&gt; Brother man didn't come isolated like
[56:48] isolated behold Elijah. No, he come for
[56:51] a purpose
[56:52] &gt;&gt; to get you.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; God told him, "Go get that bride."
[56:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, glory to God. Amen,
[56:59] brother Lindon.
[57:01] &gt;&gt; God told that prophet, "Go get that
[57:03] bride."
[57:04] &gt;&gt; And he can only get that bride by the
[57:05] word
[57:06] &gt;&gt; because it's a word bride.
[57:08] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout in the house.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So, the word
[57:14] that he can work through, made manifest,
[57:16] will be rejected.
[57:18] &gt;&gt; And that ain't happen yet.
[57:20] &gt;&gt; That is about to happen.
[57:23] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Don't look at me like
[57:24] I'm talking about somebody else. I'm
[57:26] talking about you.
[57:27] The word will work through you are not
[57:28] the believer. You know
[57:30] &gt;&gt; the word in you
[57:32] &gt;&gt; is the believer.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:35] &gt;&gt; Why you think God couldn't trust the
[57:37] Pentecostals? They were gifted men but
[57:39] they didn't have the word.
[57:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that failed.
[57:43] &gt;&gt; Gifts will fail,
[57:45] &gt;&gt; but the word can't fail.
[57:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:46] &gt;&gt; Because the word is what produced
[57:48] character. Because the word is what
[57:49] produced the test. Oh, give the Lord
[57:52] some praises.
[57:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They were running with their
[57:55] gifts without the life because the life
[57:58] come by the word and the work came to
[58:00] the prophet
[58:01] &gt;&gt; and they rejected the prophet.
[58:03] &gt;&gt; So they couldn't get the word to produce
[58:04] the character which is the life. So when
[58:07] when God looked down he could only trust
[58:09] William Brandham
[58:10] &gt;&gt; and he give him the king sword. Oh give
[58:12] the Lord a shout. He adopted that son
[58:15] and son that son said other son's
[58:17] coming.
[58:19] &gt;&gt; Oh give the Lord a shout. That son said
[58:22] he was the first one that come to
[58:23] maturity.
[58:25] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. And when everything green,
[58:28] the shock is green and the seed is
[58:30] green. You don't know who is who. But
[58:32] sometime the that grain have to become
[58:34] mature. Oh, glory to God. Mary said, "Be
[58:38] it done unto me according to thy word."
[58:40] But she was only a carrier of the life.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; Jesus was still inside of her.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; Give the Lord a shout. He wasn't mature
[58:48] enough to step out. Glory to God. But
[58:50] one day when he step out, when he step
[58:52] out, Mary become the shock.
[58:56] &gt;&gt; Give the Lord a shout in the house.
[58:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. She was the womb
[59:01] that was blocking and covering and
[59:02] protecting the seed.
[59:04] &gt;&gt; That's what the church member there for.
[59:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[59:09] &gt;&gt; To test your spirit and to try your
[59:11] heart
[59:12] &gt;&gt; until you become right.
[59:15] &gt;&gt; I don't think I don't think you get that
[59:17] yet.
[59:20] I ain't saying that one again.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; Listen to the TV that one.
[59:25] &gt;&gt; I repeat that one.
[59:27] &gt;&gt; All right. Okay. So, the stalk. Here we
[59:30] go. The tassel and husk never become
[59:34] seed.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; But the life pass through them.
[59:39] &gt;&gt; They have testimonies.
[59:41] &gt;&gt; They have histories. They have types and
[59:43] revelations. Oh, what the Lord do for
[59:45] them and how the Lord used them and and
[59:47] what the Lord all of that. That's fine.
[59:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. But God coming for processes
[59:52] &gt;&gt; because the life pass through it dries
[59:54] up you know
[59:55] &gt;&gt; stalk dry tassel dry leaf dry everything
[59:58] drying you know
[59:59] &gt;&gt; because it come to seed time
[1:00:01] [Music]
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; let's go on
[1:00:07] at the harvest time
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; the seed is back to its original
[1:00:13] condition
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; the bum and must have all the word in
[1:00:18] order to be seed
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:00:20] I believe in thunders you know what
[1:00:21] thunders is
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; that not that's not the message
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; man don't want to say seven give faith
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; that's not a New York thing that that in
[1:00:29] the message
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; seven thunders right together
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; that that's an American thing that's a
[1:00:33] New York thing what
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; you can find that in the message
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; seven thunder wait till them seven
[1:00:38] thunders utter the voices of that group
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; that's in the message
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; the bride hand of revival yet it will
[1:00:45] take them seven thunders
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; to give the bride a revive that that you
[1:00:48] could read at
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; Even if a man don't know where the
[1:00:51] thunder is, he could beat that
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; because there's a promise.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; And Abraham's son was a seed of the
[1:00:59] promise.
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; So God will separate church and bride by
[1:01:05] these promises
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; because you have to have all the word to
[1:01:09] be seed.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on. Come on. Say it again.
[1:01:13] Say amen.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; You can't take part. You have to have
[1:01:16] all the word to be deceived. And seven
[1:01:20] thunders is all the word because the
[1:01:22] seven t is the capstone revelation of
[1:01:24] Jesus Christ. The seven ton is what caps
[1:01:27] the pyramid. The seven ters is the
[1:01:29] capstone. Oh, give the Lord a shout in
[1:01:31] the house. Come on, give the Lord some
[1:01:34] praises.
[1:01:36] [Applause]
[1:01:38] Amen.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; At the harvest time, the seed is back to
[1:01:45] its original condition.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; And must have all the word in order to
[1:01:50] be seed.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; Can I continue?
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; You can't have half a seed.
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; It won't grow.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; It's got to be the whole seed.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; And then he go down deeper. It's got to
[1:02:00] not manifest and say, "I believe in the
[1:02:02] Bible Holy Ghost. I believe in speaking
[1:02:04] in tong." That's just part of the seed.
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; But in a message they don't even leave
[1:02:08] that part.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; You understand this part of the Z2?
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; We can't say we need message. So we
[1:02:14] don't need justification. We need
[1:02:16] message. We don't need sanification. We
[1:02:18] need message. We don't need the
[1:02:18] Pentecostal part.
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; That's false.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; Because all the parts make up the seed.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; Do you understand now?
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; That's just part of the seed. But now
[1:02:32] but there is added to that the life
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; not the gifts
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; the life of the gifts
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; we at the end time brethren stalk tassel
[1:02:45] husk is dead dry now
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; yesmen
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; and the only thing that happened is to
[1:02:49] be gathered in the work of the churches
[1:02:51] all through life here we go that was in
[1:02:55] the stalk and they had the testimony you
[1:02:57] could listen it you could read it you
[1:02:58] could hear it that All true light that
[1:03:01] was in the stalk, tassel and husk is now
[1:03:06] gathering in the seed.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; Ready for the resurrection.
[1:03:16] Ready for the harvest. I'm still
[1:03:18] reading. The alpha has become the omega.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; The first come last. The last is first.
[1:03:23] The seed that went in has come through
[1:03:25] the process.
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; And become seed again.
[1:03:30] That is why there'll be another book of
[1:03:32] acts.
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; That is why there'll be another days of
[1:03:36] the apostle
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; because it's the same seed that was in
[1:03:39] the beginning is the same seed at the
[1:03:41] ending. And we will have nothing less
[1:03:44] than that. Do I hear a shout in the
[1:03:46] house? Don't tie me down to no message.
[1:03:49] Nothing. Tie it to the Bible that says
[1:03:52] if that branch put forth another
[1:03:55] original branch, we'll have another book
[1:03:57] of Acts.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout to those.
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; Not no message grafted and stuff.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:12] [Music]
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:19] So Luther was the blade
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; Abraham.
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; Wesley the task Isaac
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; Pentecost was the husk to shock
[1:04:31] Jacob
[1:04:32] and the fourth was Joseph
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; the capstone.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; So the shock comes down to Jacob grace.
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; God help me tonight.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So somehow there has to be a
[1:04:50] transitioning
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; out of Jacob grace
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; into Joseph perfection
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; the capstone word
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; the word itself
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; you don't want nothing less than being
[1:05:00] common the word itself
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; no excuses
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; you could take some more tonight
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; of course you could take some more
[1:05:10] tonight you come here to go home you
[1:05:12] come here to get something for your soul
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; we have more tonight.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; So does the seed. Oh, just like Paul
[1:05:21] here, did not the seed of the free woman
[1:05:23] or the bond woman persecute the seed of
[1:05:24] the free woman? So does the seed of the
[1:05:26] nomination persecute the genuine grain.
[1:05:29] So the genuine grain will be under
[1:05:31] persecution.
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; Let me give it how the prophet said it.
[1:05:33] The bride of the haunted persecuted
[1:05:35] group.
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Someone light but that's the word
[1:05:39] man. Somebody say word.
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; Long time I couldn't preach this. It was
[1:05:42] too heavy.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; What? was heavy for me and all.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; So I touch it.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; The bride will be a haunted
[1:05:52] persecuted group
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; because she's genuine green.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; No bride member looking to torment. No,
[1:05:57] no church member is them church member.
[1:06:02] That why said the criticism will be
[1:06:04] shut.
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; The bride criticizing and the critics
[1:06:06] criticizing.
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; Who's the accuser of the brethren?
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; Church members. Amen.
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; The Bible said Lucifer devil devil upon
[1:06:16] church folks.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; Here we go. So does the seed of
[1:06:22] denomination persecute the genuine
[1:06:24] dream. It is always got to be that way.
[1:06:28] They will not be hes together.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; They are not associated together. They
[1:06:33] are absolutely two different promises,
[1:06:35] two different times, two different
[1:06:36] peoples all together. One is bride and
[1:06:38] the other is church.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; So let's make it serious tonight. Amen.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Just make it serious
[1:06:43] tonight. No comparison at all.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; Mary was not the seed. She was a carrier
[1:06:49] of the seed, but she had nurtured and
[1:06:52] brought forth out of a womb. Just like
[1:06:54] the shark brought from the womb the real
[1:06:57] seed.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right?
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; Jesus told us in the last day it will be
[1:07:02] so close it will deceive the very
[1:07:04] elective possible. But then the seed
[1:07:06] comes forth from there and the shock the
[1:07:08] life leaves the shock and the shock is a
[1:07:12] carrier.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; So do you get it now?
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; When the word went down into the ground
[1:07:16] the seed the life begin to move
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; and the stalk was a carrier. The tassel
[1:07:21] was a carrier. The shock is a carrier.
[1:07:23] What they carrying? The life where the
[1:07:25] life getting for the seed
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; where the seed going to die
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; except a corner weight
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; fall into the crown and oh you thought
[1:07:34] the seed just going rap hold it hold it
[1:07:37] wait wait wait wait wait you you thought
[1:07:38] so
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; after all this process thing and se what
[1:07:42] you going do going to kill you
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; that see that go and die now
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; that your family could get the
[1:07:48] breakthrough
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; that your loved ones can get the
[1:07:50] breakthrough y stinking rotten flesh
[1:07:53] fleshly have to die.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; You have to die. God humbled Joseph in
[1:07:57] that prison.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, glor God taught Joseph humility. God
[1:08:01] stripped Joseph. Joseph had to be saved.
[1:08:04] This big man Joseph with vision and all
[1:08:06] kind of revelation. God leave him there
[1:08:08] to hang out until he was ready until the
[1:08:11] time appointed of the father under
[1:08:13] tutors and governors under discipline
[1:08:16] under order. Oh, give the Lord a shout.
[1:08:19] And all these mysteries and seals is to
[1:08:22] bring our bodies in order.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; But George, not the kind of message
[1:08:34] people like to hear.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; They want to hear about conversations in
[1:08:39] Ukraine
[1:08:42] and how the gold standard coming back or
[1:08:45] the US dollar losing power. That guy
[1:08:47] help me right now. I know.
[1:08:49] I don't even know what that's supposed
[1:08:50] to mean.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; India discover a whole ton of gold
[1:08:53] trying to have tons of gold. How come I
[1:08:55] never bring gold?
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; I better but have to dig in the back of
[1:08:58] my yard. See if I get gold.
[1:09:01] But what I'm saying then, we need to
[1:09:04] know what God promised us.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; We need to conduct the reality that
[1:09:08] these things have to come alive.
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; Somebody with faith anointed to
[1:09:12] themselves.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; You have to begin to believe with them.
[1:09:14] When you talk about Bri talking about me
[1:09:15] then when you talking about Julie he's
[1:09:17] talking about me then
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; I am just as real a manifestation that
[1:09:21] God promised as brilliant Brandham was
[1:09:23] as Jesus was. He said you are
[1:09:25] predestinated seed just like Christ was
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; not separate just like Christ was
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; you are predestinated seed and if God
[1:09:33] before you just think about that tonight
[1:09:36] if God before you forget what your
[1:09:38] family saying forget what your wife
[1:09:40] husband saying forget them. If God
[1:09:42] before you, who can be against you?
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. God for you.
[1:09:47] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; Jesus told us that in the last days
[1:09:59] it'll be so close. It will see the very
[1:10:01] less possible.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; But then the seed comes forth from
[1:10:05] there.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; And the shock, the life leaves the
[1:10:09] shock. And the shock is a carrier.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; Notice Mary, she was not deceived. She
[1:10:15] was like a shock, a carrier of part of
[1:10:17] the word.
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; Watch justification was save a man. You
[1:10:20] believe that? Sure. But it's a carrier
[1:10:21] of the word.
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; Just as I believe in the stalk is part
[1:10:25] of the wheat. Sure. It's a carrier. It
[1:10:27] ain't the life.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; Along came sanctification. You believe
[1:10:35] in sanctification. Then come Pentecost,
[1:10:37] restoration of the gift, speaking in
[1:10:38] tongues. They call it initial evidence.
[1:10:39] When you come and say I and my father
[1:10:40] are one these are the things then the
[1:10:42] shock pulls away. But the real genuine
[1:10:45] bride church will bring forth the entire
[1:10:47] word of God
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; in its fullness
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; and in its strength
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; for he's the same yesterday, today and
[1:10:54] forever.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; Oh my hallelujah.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; Notice in the womb of Mary was the seed.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; But when the seed was delivered, he
[1:11:05] said, I come to do the will of him that
[1:11:07] sent me. Amen.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; And when brother was talking about Mary
[1:11:11] and then miss m Miss um Jesus and he
[1:11:13] come back and and and they found him.
[1:11:14] They say your father and I he was
[1:11:16] showing how Mary slip up there
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; to say she said in in saying that making
[1:11:21] a statement she deny his supernatural
[1:11:22] birth.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; Your father and I was looking all about
[1:11:26] for you and he straightened that out.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; He said no you not I'm about my
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; my father's business
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; 12 years old.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; Straight out his mother because I was
[1:11:35] off the word. Oh, give the Lord some
[1:11:37] praises.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:11:40] Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; Notice at the opening of the seven
[1:11:45] seals, Revelation 10, the full word is
[1:11:50] to be born into manifestation again
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; and vindicated by the spirit of God in
[1:11:56] the full strength
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; as when he was here on earth.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; And the Revelation 10, who came down?
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; The Lord himself.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; What did he throw out? Seven thunders
[1:12:07] out his mouth. What the seven thunders
[1:12:09] do? Gather the bride together. Not to
[1:12:12] look for church members. Oh, give the
[1:12:13] Lord some praises.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; What the seven thunders to do? Give the
[1:12:17] bride faith.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; What the seven tongs will do? Show her
[1:12:21] how to prepare.
[1:12:24] [Music]
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; What the seven ts do? Give her a
[1:12:27] revival.
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; Utter his voices.
[1:12:35] That's the exclusive bride promise.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; Not church members. You're not going to
[1:12:40] fight that. But this is exclusive bride
[1:12:41] promise. So when you come here, you come
[1:12:43] here to hear bright promises. Not
[1:12:45] bakanal. Bright promises. Not what that
[1:12:48] church doing. Bright promises. Not who
[1:12:50] off and who falls. Bright promises.
[1:12:53] Give the Lord some praises.
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm not interested who falls
[1:12:57] and who off. I want to know if I'm
[1:12:58] connected to this thing. If this thing
[1:13:01] is real. If I got the faith to unlock
[1:13:03] the door because faith is not talk.
[1:13:06] Faith is the walk. Oh, give the Lord
[1:13:08] some praises. Glory to God. The works
[1:13:12] express the faith that is working inside
[1:13:14] you.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; Here we go.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; The shock has give forth its strength
[1:13:21] under the seed.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; It went on out. It was a good shock,
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; but it serve its time.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; It's the word bride of the word groom.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh yeah.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; The natural seed of Abraham, Isaac,
[1:13:33] Jacob, natural seed Ishmael, seed of
[1:13:35] Isaac and so forth had to go into the
[1:13:37] ground
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; and this bring out Jesus.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; I mean the shock has to dry
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; and the pollen has to dry and everything
[1:13:47] dies. Well, this blow me out. So that
[1:13:50] the seed can produce itself.
[1:13:57] So when you talk about the debt going to
[1:13:59] hit this message,
[1:14:01] you see nothing yet.
[1:14:04] That's the way it has been in every age.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; We see here the true revelation of the
[1:14:07] true type. There's three woman carriers
[1:14:10] of the natural seed until the matured
[1:14:13] into Jesus. He's talking about Hagga,
[1:14:15] Sarah, Mary, and Jesus. and Sarah,
[1:14:19] Hagga, Mary were carriers,
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; but Jesus was the seed.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; There are some people who brought you
[1:14:26] into the message. Nothing wrong in the
[1:14:28] message. Some don't even believe the
[1:14:29] message, but they were carriers
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; to lead you to the truth
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; because you are the seed.
[1:14:37] Hallelujah.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; Three women,
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; three denominational ages, which must
[1:14:43] die and dry up just like the shock and
[1:14:45] so forth to give room for the seed. So
[1:14:48] the the shock is what hugs the seed,
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; protects the seed because the seed is
[1:14:53] young inside. It's green.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; It can't face the sun.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; The shock is what is doing that. Looks
[1:14:58] like the green, look like the seed.
[1:15:00] Isn't that right?
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; But hear this now. to give room for the
[1:15:03] seed. The seed cannot get ripe
[1:15:06] until the shock stalk and leaves are all
[1:15:11] dry.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; It saps every bit of the life in them
[1:15:16] out. All of it is that plus
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; now it is sea time.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; It is bright time.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; The shocks are dead.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; The shocks are dried up. The virgin word
[1:15:27] time, not touch. It's a virgin.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Not touch. And then he said
[1:15:31] this. But it will be it it can't be a
[1:15:34] denomination. It won't be a virgin
[1:15:36] because it will be manhandled.
[1:15:38] God's church is not touched by
[1:15:40] denomination.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; So God will ensure that somehow this
[1:15:44] bride is not be manhandled.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; God will manhandle them out of the
[1:15:48] different groups and churches
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; that man ain't going to have the hand on
[1:15:51] them.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; Man go manipulate and control this
[1:15:53] bride. This are no Nick Nimrod trying to
[1:15:55] build some tower to go to heaven with
[1:15:56] his interpretation. This is a revelation
[1:15:59] that was bought by Malachi 4 as that
[1:16:01] elaza to go get that bride.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; That's why the Bible say the spirit and
[1:16:05] the bride say come. Oh give the Lord
[1:16:07] some praises.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. It's a virgin
[1:16:10] born word of God made manifest. Jesus
[1:16:14] Christ is saying yesterday, today and
[1:16:15] forever. There will be no get this bomb.
[1:16:17] There will be no denominational
[1:16:18] manhandling in the virgin birth of the
[1:16:21] bride.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; She is commanded by God to come out as
[1:16:24] such. And God will pull them out of
[1:16:27] every church, every fellowship, every
[1:16:29] denomination, every interpretation. He
[1:16:31] said, "The bride will follow the life
[1:16:33] wherever it goes."
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. You hear that?
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; The bride will follow the life wherever
[1:16:39] it goes.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; Because the life is the word. The life
[1:16:42] is the spirit. The word is the spirit.
[1:16:44] The word is the oil. The oil is the
[1:16:46] spirit. Oh, give the Lord a shout in the
[1:16:48] house. And the extra oil is what taking
[1:16:50] the bride to the rapture.
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:56] Hallelujah.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; This is good.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; Got to burn them. The life that come
[1:17:02] through Luther is what made Wesley.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; The life that come out of Wesley is what
[1:17:05] made Pentecost.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; The life that comes out of Pentecost
[1:17:08] makes the wheat.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; But they are carriers.
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; The real life goes through there. The
[1:17:13] message goes through, but it is heading
[1:17:15] up to the wheat.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; That's the reason the wheat comes up and
[1:17:19] brings the whole thing in the rapture.
[1:17:20] Amen.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; At the top
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; the bride itself comes out of each age.
[1:17:25] But the denominational stalk dies, dries
[1:17:27] up and dies. Have you noticed this last
[1:17:29] day? It begin to pull away. Now when the
[1:17:32] wheat begins to grow, the shock begins
[1:17:34] to get away from it.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; So you just have to grow and mature
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; and the shock will just pull away
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; because you are on the word now.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; You're not on gossiping. You're on the
[1:17:44] word now.
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; You're on sanctification. You're on the
[1:17:46] word now. You're on behavior. Yes.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; It's a powerful quote, but I'm talking
[1:17:52] about the preacher and he's talking
[1:17:53] about his behavior and conduct brought
[1:17:55] him to another office.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; Not the sermon,
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; not the teaching,
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; but his behavior and conduct.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; Promoted him to another office.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; So, when the wheat begins to grow, the
[1:18:13] shock begins to pull away. He said,
[1:18:15] "Look back at a little weed. Pull it
[1:18:17] open and look and see. Got a little bud
[1:18:19] inside of there. It's way back in there.
[1:18:22] It started growing. Now the shock." Here
[1:18:24] we go. Has to be there.
[1:18:29] So you can't fight the shock and say,
[1:18:30] "God, no. No. Wait. Take it easy. Take
[1:18:33] your time. Slow down. The shock has to
[1:18:37] be there to shelter that
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; to give it a chance to get out. But when
[1:18:43] it begins to grow and the message begin
[1:18:46] to spread, then the shock pulls away
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; and the life goes right out of that
[1:18:51] shock.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; There's what brother Isaac was talking
[1:18:55] about with the rise and fall of King
[1:18:57] Saul.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; All the testimonies there, the blessing
[1:18:59] is there, the witness is there, he
[1:19:01] prophesy and everything else. But then
[1:19:03] afterwards, what happened? Under
[1:19:05] instructions that he might obey, he
[1:19:07] failed. The life left him.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; Still on the throne,
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; but life already gone.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; All right. The life goes right out of
[1:19:18] that shock and goes right into the
[1:19:20] wheat. That's the way each age does. All
[1:19:24] right. We going good. Notice how much
[1:19:28] more the real thing Mary was like the
[1:19:29] shock. The shock hugs the seed, protects
[1:19:33] it,
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; nurtures it until it is standing alone
[1:19:37] mature. Amen. Amen.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; A heir, a child
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; is under tutors and governors
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; until it becomes mature.
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; So as long as you a babe in Christ, a
[1:19:50] babe in the faith, God have to put you
[1:19:53] under tutors and governors until you be
[1:19:56] mature
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; to handle the responsibility that God
[1:20:00] want to give you
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; because God didn't give it a warm bench,
[1:20:03] church bench. God have responsibility
[1:20:05] for you.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? So watch now. So this
[1:20:08] church age of Pentecost matured
[1:20:11] holding this grain until it's time to
[1:20:14] open up the shock. Mary was just a
[1:20:17] incubator. Let's get down. And that's
[1:20:19] the way with people who profess Christ.
[1:20:22] Many of them look like Christians, try
[1:20:24] to act like Christians, but you got to
[1:20:25] have Christ on the inside of you,
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; which is the word made manifest or it
[1:20:29] will never mature into a real Bible
[1:20:31] believing Christian.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; Praise God. A egg cannot hatch. It rots
[1:20:36] on the nest if it's not with the bird.
[1:20:38] It has to be with the male bird. Like
[1:20:39] church members, you can baby them, call
[1:20:41] them, make them deacons, everything else
[1:20:43] have a nest full of rotten eggs unless
[1:20:45] they have meeted with the meat.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; Carrier the shock. It neuted it. That's
[1:20:49] right. Then that is the seed itself has
[1:20:53] to leave the shock or the shock has to
[1:20:55] leave the seed to get the seed in the
[1:20:58] presence of the sun so it can be
[1:21:00] ripened.
[1:21:04] The objective of God before you die.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; You can't bury a green seed.
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; The seed had to get right.
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; For the seed to get right, the shock
[1:21:18] have to pull back.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; And for the shock to pull back, you have
[1:21:21] to become immature.
[1:21:24] Amen.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; Jesus had 30 years of hard trials
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; and three and a half years of
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; harder trials.
[1:21:33] This is me tonight. This is words.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; This is not this not KFC and burger and
[1:21:41] thing late in the night. This is words,
[1:21:43] sir.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; 30 years of hard trials. Three and a
[1:21:46] half years of
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; harder trials. Why?
[1:21:54] If you bring forth fruit, he does what?
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; He purge and prune for it to bring more
[1:22:01] fruit.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; And he want much fruit.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; So as soon as he start to bear, he said
[1:22:05] to come with the clipper. Ouch. Yes. He
[1:22:07] come with the clipper. People don't want
[1:22:08] to be clipped.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; They don't want to be cut.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; Let me put it back in the message. They
[1:22:12] don't want to be honed. Amen.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; So somebody who don't want to be under
[1:22:21] tutors and governors, they don't want a
[1:22:22] correction. They don't want
[1:22:23] instructions. They don't want to be
[1:22:25] honed because God will hone you by the
[1:22:26] word.
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; Because remember
[1:22:29] after brotherly kindness, I can't go
[1:22:32] into it tonight. You are called out of
[1:22:34] brotherly kindness age
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; into that Holy Spirit slot
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; to be fitted in that slot.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; That slot is the capstone. That slot is
[1:22:44] the Holy Ghost itself.
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; He said on top of that is Christ
[1:22:48] corporal body. Beneath him is the spirit
[1:22:50] of Christ to manifest the virtues.
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; So the spirit is under Lov
[1:22:56] corporal body. Under that have the Holy
[1:22:58] Ghost and then they get brotherly
[1:22:59] kindness. He has to call you out because
[1:23:01] he came at the end of the reason age
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; to call that bride out into the bride
[1:23:05] age. So that bride age is the Holy Ghost
[1:23:08] to call you out of what you're in
[1:23:10] into the Holy Ghost That means we
[1:23:12] have to believe in the spirit of man
[1:23:14] which is Luther and Wesley that come
[1:23:16] across into the message. Spirit of man
[1:23:17] into the message to get into the Holy
[1:23:19] Ghost slot where we be guided by the
[1:23:21] Holy Ghost itself.
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; And the first thing these demons try to
[1:23:27] do is to cancel sovereignity of the
[1:23:28] local church
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; for the bishop to take over.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; Trying to anull the sovereignity of the
[1:23:35] local church that the local pastor can't
[1:23:38] have guidance from God to do what he do.
[1:23:40] You had to have some headquarters to get
[1:23:42] direction from.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; But the bride-elect rejects that.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; No headquarters.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; The only headquarters is of heaven.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Christ is the head of the
[1:23:53] body called the church. Not some man in
[1:23:56] Jessville, America, South America,
[1:24:00] wherever they are from, Africa. It
[1:24:01] doesn't matter from Trinidad.
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; Christ is the head of the body
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; called the church.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? Amen.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; All right. So the chuck nurture it has
[1:24:12] to give uh to leave the seed to get the
[1:24:15] seed in the presence of the sun so it
[1:24:17] can be ripened. Now when the shock comes
[1:24:19] forth out of the grain a blade of grain
[1:24:21] I'll skip that. Now the grain comes
[1:24:23] forth from that. Now remember there is
[1:24:25] no more after that shock. All right here
[1:24:27] we go. Notice he's come back again.
[1:24:30] Matthew 24:24.
[1:24:32] There's two spirits in the last days. I
[1:24:35] want to get to this. We're almost done.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; The church spirit.
[1:24:39] of the church people
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; and the bride spirit of the bride people
[1:24:45] would be so close till it will deceive
[1:24:47] the elected if it was possible
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; so the church people have a church
[1:24:54] spirit
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; watch that
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; the bright people have a bright spirit
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; so therefore this this inheritance of
[1:25:04] divine love
[1:25:06] this tremendous victory the church can't
[1:25:08] inherit that
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; I'll show you why.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; 2 Timothy 3. This is the church spirit.
[1:25:16] There's no in the last days perilous of
[1:25:19] time shall come. This is people with
[1:25:21] books and tapes.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; This is people in this tabernacle and
[1:25:25] this fellowship and what this is them
[1:25:26] here. And the pastor some of them ooling
[1:25:29] them alone to become more like this.
[1:25:33] For men shall be lovers of their own
[1:25:34] selves,
[1:25:36] covetous,
[1:25:39] boasters,
[1:25:40] proud,
[1:25:42] blasphemers,
[1:25:43] disobedient parents, unthankful, unholy.
[1:25:46] You would think this is unbelievers,
[1:25:47] right? Without natural affection, truth
[1:25:51] breakers in church. Force accusers. I'll
[1:25:53] see it in church. Incontinent in church.
[1:25:57] Fierce, still in the church. Despisers
[1:26:00] of those that are good, still in the
[1:26:01] church.
[1:26:02] traitors,
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasures
[1:26:07] more than lovers of God, having a form
[1:26:10] of godliness
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; in the message,
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; but denying the power thereof
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; from such turn away. For this is the
[1:26:18] sort that they creep into houses and
[1:26:20] lead captive silly women laden with
[1:26:22] sins, led away by diverse lust, ever
[1:26:24] learning, and never be able to come to
[1:26:27] null of the truth. Now as dance and
[1:26:29] damage withtood Moses, so these resist
[1:26:31] the truth, men of corrupt minds,
[1:26:33] reparate concerning what? The fate, but
[1:26:36] they shall proceed no further. For their
[1:26:38] folly shall be manifest unto all men as
[1:26:41] theirs also was.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Blessed be the name of the
[1:26:45] Lord. Thank you, Jesus. I'm almost done.
[1:26:49] Music, come up, please.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; Somehow I leave out something.
[1:27:05] This is it. Notice the life that was in
[1:27:07] the husk, in the stalk, in the tassel.
[1:27:11] All gathers up in the seed.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; And the life that was in the stalk went
[1:27:14] on to make the other. Justification made
[1:27:17] a way for sanification. Sanctification
[1:27:19] made a way for the bapt Holy Ghost. and
[1:27:21] the baptism Holy Ghost made a way for
[1:27:24] the Holy Ghost itself to come right down
[1:27:27] in perfection back to the word again.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; If this be so, how the message will
[1:27:33] reject justification when justification
[1:27:35] is the channel or the carrier or the
[1:27:38] means by which you get to sanification.
[1:27:40] How could you reject sanctification when
[1:27:42] that's the means to get to the Bible
[1:27:43] Holy Ghost and the Bapt Holy Ghost is
[1:27:45] the means to get the Lord yourself. He
[1:27:47] said the dynamics of this church
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; will be a refilling
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; of the Holy Ghost that they have worked
[1:27:53] in a small measure.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; So God have to give a measure to work
[1:27:57] with
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; until this thing come down.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We'll be a super race, a
[1:28:02] super church as we near the headstone.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; So as we near the headstone, some kind
[1:28:07] of thing will be coming down to get us
[1:28:09] active, activated, motivated.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You see that? I
[1:28:17] know I missed something. I had to go
[1:28:18] right back to it.
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. We're
[1:28:20] going to close.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; My my my
[1:28:30] [Music]
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; glory.
[1:28:35] You going to play something? Luther went
[1:28:38] to hospital. The first word to just
[1:28:39] shall live by faith. Wesley had two
[1:28:42] words sanification. Second book of
[1:28:44] grace. Pentecostal has a third word,
[1:28:47] restoring of the gifts. But the entire
[1:28:49] seed has to come.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; They're denominated on one word, another
[1:28:54] word, another word. Listen to this now,
[1:28:56] saints. There's got to be something that
[1:29:00] cannot be denominated.
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; You know what it is? He say it's the
[1:29:05] entirety of the life.
[1:29:07] [Music]
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; There have been no unity on doctrine.
[1:29:15] There's no way we can see eye to eye on
[1:29:17] everything.
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; But you see the life.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; It thunders.
[1:29:23] [Music]
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; The devil recognizes it.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; Paul, I know
[1:29:30] the bride. I know.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; He recognizes the life. When Peter Bar
[1:29:35] says when they were in the upper room
[1:29:37] and they were staging and whatnot and
[1:29:38] the angels from hell went down and said,
[1:29:40] "Listen, they're having a good time up
[1:29:41] there. Nobody there. is having
[1:29:43] excitement. That was the interpretation.
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; They just excited,
[1:29:48] emotional,
[1:29:50] they acting wild,
[1:29:54] something off for them. They're not in
[1:29:55] the message.
[1:29:58] That's fine. But when Peter told that
[1:30:00] man, "Silver and gold have I none. Such
[1:30:04] as I have I give it unto you. Rise up
[1:30:05] and walk."
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; But Abbrand said, the devil said, we
[1:30:08] have to stop that.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; That is not excitement.
[1:30:12] That's a literal manifestation
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; of Jesus Christ again.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; We thought we'd kill him.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; We thought he was finished,
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; but we seen his life reproduce again.
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; That was a reproduction of the original
[1:30:26] grain.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout. Brother Bam,
[1:30:32] he lived a life. God vindicated his
[1:30:34] ministry, confirmed the word that he
[1:30:36] spoke and he prophesy that there'll be
[1:30:39] another reproduction of the original
[1:30:42] grain. It will be original life because
[1:30:45] it will be brought by the original seed.
[1:30:47] In closing, there's got to be something
[1:30:50] that cannot be eliminated. It's the
[1:30:52] entirety of the life that's in there has
[1:30:54] to produce itself again on a bride.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; There cannot be any more churches after
[1:31:00] this. We are the end, brothers and
[1:31:02] sisters. We are here. We have arrived.
[1:31:06] Thanks be to God. May the Lord bless you
[1:31:07] tonight. Could we just stand and worship
[1:31:09] the Lord and give the Lord some praises?
[1:31:10] Father God, bless your people tonight.
[1:31:12] You'll give us a word for them that
[1:31:15] they'll recognize that the bride, the
[1:31:17] the the the elect lady, that seed will
[1:31:20] not be able to shock,
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; but they're going to have an inheritance
[1:31:24] of the rapture of the millennium of the
[1:31:26] wedding supper of the new Jerusalem of
[1:31:30] that city built before Square. Oh, God
[1:31:32] bless them tonight. May they leave you
[1:31:34] inspired in love with you in Jesus name
[1:31:37] I ask it. Amen and amen. God bless you.
[1:31:39] Praise the Lord.
[1:31:43] [Music]
[1:31:56] Praise God. Just raise your hands and
[1:31:58] give him praise tonight. Continue to
[1:31:59] praise him. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Just

[1:32:27] bright inheritance tonight. Blessed be
