well greetings in Jesus name and welcome want to say welcome to past Andrews for long on this portion of his church here publishing my brother praise the Lord innerville Sanctuary that's his church and it's my privilege to introduce to you him today to come to the pulpit we're going to keep that same song um I know him as a humble respectful man of God with a fine spirit and I'm privileged to have him to come and bring the wood to you today and Psalms 42 David said as the heart pounded afterward books so part of my soul after dear God my soul tests for God for the Living God When shall I come and appear before God my tears have been my mid-day night while they continue to see unto me where is thy God but we have a promise one day that God will come to you he will surely visit you just welcome to the pulpit let's sing the song One More Time [Music] Glory and Andrew take a liberty [Music] foreign [Music] it's good to be in this house amen the Lord bless you all his sons you may be seated for just a moment certainly appreciate the invitation Bible or precious brother Tio to be here and I think I must have been on wise to accept the invitation because I I know the the caliber of the ministry here and I am accept myself even after this very moment what can I tell you that you have not already heard but God does as an appropriate word for every service service amen really is is not let me talk normal right if I try to talk a language accent you might even understand and I might even understand myself so it better be simple and plain just be who you are if you're otherwise is a hypocrite and and Gordo like hypocrite that I don't want to be a hypocrite amen but I just want to be a blessing and whatever little way that the Lord would use me to encourage ourselves sometimes we have to encourage ourselves you know when you see pressure starts so it seems like you are alone at all you have to encourage yourself in Psalms and songs and so the Lord have allowed me to be with you this morning by God's grace I appreciate the confidence that brought Theo had to remind me to be with you all he never hear me preach before that's a brief money but who would have thought God would have chosen me or you you remember when it wasn't good I I I I I there was nothing in you to qualify you yeah but Gordon is Grace amen amen and God has not seen your conditioner your present condition is not going to determine by your destiny is around or were you going to be you know and if I could step into my message that was determined before the foundation before there was a speck of dust there when there was nothing God already see bratio oved and put his name dog in a book I'm not even brother T the book that he writes his name in not him he could take him out of the annoying reason no kind of nothing to take all that that is indelible event and that is the kind of assurance we want to have that God has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world the rather was meditated on what I could see and I was looking on the name Tio you know there's only two mentions of the name in the Bible right but you know that and and look you know it's a physician a Dr Luke who was writing to Tiara so a man of his caliber I need a doctor to write too yeah well he said he said most excellent amen so there is not much of his background but the name Tio means a friend of God so you have a pastor who is a friend of God that's a I want to be friends you know because if he's a friend of God and good company so that's why I must stay with your pastor because he's a friend of God and if somebody is a friend of God he can make representation for you you know that is that could fail but the bank the manager Heroes is in the banker heaven listen let me tell you something God don't need money and gold and silver do you know what God is interested in you [Applause] you'll see this morning the hard purpose of God is to have a wife era the heart purpose he had many purpose we see the hard purpose is to have himself a wife so I Believe by God's grace you are part of that elect lady so I really want to appreciate our precious brother and I pray this morning I I really was enjoying this service um the ministry here has always been profound and I think the very first time I met brother Tio was in Brussels I believe well I'm Saddam he was on his way to some part of Africa so I met him very very first time in an airport but then we begin to meet and fellowship with one another and by God's grace we are here this house this amen so we have come maybe as strangers but when we leave we leave us Brothers in the Lord Jesus Christ so I pray that the Lord will help me to say something that will be of a blessing you know this is my this is just revision class right this is just a reminder of things that you have already known amen so by God's grace it will help us in life's Judy I had several thoughts or two other thoughts in mind but somehow you know sometimes it never seem to come over and then I I just glance at notes that I had and then I pick up this message and the last quote that I have in it birram says but this is introducing the headstone so I knew right away I said listen this is what I'm gonna preach on light is introduced in The Headstone the last the the Bright Tree which is contrary to all of it yes it's the same light for the mature amen like the same sunshine today will be ripening the green for the Harvest in July amen so by God's grace I want to speak a little bit this morning on this subject the purpose of God amen or the purpose of the seed so maybe you all stand and ball heads as we just approach god father God we come humbly before you as a man we are nothing as individuals we may have all the intelligence and the abilities Lord but Lord it takes on a Divine anointing to bring Revelation to your word in fact Revelation is Sovereign Lord we can hear everything we can know it we can repeat it but not until it becomes a revelation it means something to us then it becomes life then it becomes quickening power then it becomes a rock something that can anchor us and Hold Us Lord let your word become a revelation let it be revealed to us so it becomes a part of us Lord father Lord continue to bless the ministry here the musician the song leader Lord Lord such thrilling serve abilities lord to bless our hearts and the various support in the ministry Lord father Lord I know that they are better equipped them to do it Lord but today it falls my portion so I like flesh and self to be put aside and let God get the glory and praise we commit ourselves to you bless the body Hera and the speaker for we ask it for the honor and Glory of our Lord Jesus Christ with Thanksgiving amen and amen the Lord bless you well you heard my wife sing this morning and so I don't need to introduce her but by God's grace my three children are here my eldest son is Isaac also and that album a second one William and then I have a young lady uh Christina she's the last so we have God has blessed us with three children and I'm connected to a church that has been really a blessing to me loyal and faithful so I want to thank God for the innerville sanctuary or here this morning to fellowship with us and all of a sudden may the Lord bless all of us this morning amen I'd like to take a scripture reading from the book of Ephesians chapter 1. and verse 10 and verse 11. perhaps I could read verse 9 haven't made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he had purpose in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of time he might gather together in one all things in Christ which both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who work at all things after the Council of his own will God be praised me he had a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated I hope I have missed any appropriate announcements but I really am happy to be here with you all Ministry I was very nervous and I never got it over and I want to say this morning um just as novice but I know I'm depending on your prayer right and that it will but I feel like I feel like a home a little bit and it's good to be home you know you can when you feel a spirit that Kindred Spirits then you're at home amen and I know if I say anything that you don't understand you will know what I mean right amen so we want to look a little bit of purpose purpose is important amen hey man you see this morning because Purpose By definition it means the reason for which something is done or created or for which something exists amen the reason the reason for which something is done or created or for which something exists so you were created for God's purpose you are created for a purpose and everything else hinges around that great purpose of God remember you are the the heartfelt purpose of God program says in in the church change book amen and once you see the picture you will never lose the image and your focus it's like a jigsaw puzzle if a jigsaw puzzle had a 5 000 pieces or two thousand pieces and they actually put it together you will have difficulty because you haven't seen the picture but once you see the picture you know and we'll be able to foot fit each piece into its right place you can go on the edges and then you can go by the colors and the sky and the various things so you want to see the picture I want to see the whole picture then you are able to see I want to see the purpose of God then you will understand what why you are where you are if I remember in this in this picture God has had a hundred and ten billion persons that ever lived science estimate that among the people and to think of it you are one in a hundred and ten billion persons and God pre-planned your boat amen God is the best family planner God didn't want you to born in uh be CEO or before the flood God wanted you to be born and God the purpose for you to be here this morning [Applause] God wanted you to be here this morning God wanted me to be here this morning and he wanted us to be here for a purpose so we want to find the purpose of God I want to find purpose then you will not be frustrated once you find purpose you will not be afraid because you know where you come from and who is this much exact he know your beginning you know your journey you know your end amen amen when I left home I knew I was coming Grande so I left without purpose now if I was God I will be saying I will be in Grande at such a time I wouldn't be looking at ways to see how long again I have and where am I I where the church is that I can't take but God knows the destiny God knows your end already God is not frustrated God is not upset over anything God is settled and God wants us to be settled the same way God wants you to be at rest God wants you to be at peace you can be in the midst of a trial this morning but God wants you to be at rest amen he said Peace I live with you they met in 1964 Bear Brown says shalom why why is he saying Shalom he said good morning it's the dawn of a new day you are not living under your old thinking your mind is transformed you are New Creation in Christ you have the mind of Christ you are living on that revealed word the word is now open to you the world your life has become simplified Barbara said no you see the complete secret of your life not part of your life on the complete Secret because he has one objective to bring you back to himself that is why you are blessed in him if you read our Ephesians chapter one in Christ in him in us us in him we [Applause] that us is we you are in Christ that's why I promise even said when he raised you rest too when he died you die too so you must rise again amen that cannot stop you problem cannot stop you whatever may be happening in the world nothing can stop you because you are in Christ [Applause] [Music] you are sealed you are settled you are established you are perfected I I consider about myself but he said it and whose one is more guaranteed to happen here's one if he said it if he was so sure to put my name in the Lamb's Book of Life then why should I fight why should I question why should I be afraid he has said it [Applause] praise the Lord ow listen look at the big picture your life when you look begin to look at your life it's poor personal everything is guided and controlled by God's purpose that's your powerful passes amen it's a controlling factor in life purpose precedes predestination and then you begin to predestinate things to put in a place amen God had already you will see in the pupas you see one of God's purpose maybe I can just talk I don't need to look at the nose then the Lord will help me right when the fall took place you think God oh my gosh all this thing happened no the alarm was already slain [Applause] you appreciate that the alarm was already slain then don't worry about what is happening in your life the purpose of God determined you will make it [Applause] Jesus it doesn't matter the in-between this gap between your beginning and your end no matter it's just a little Dash if I would have died or put a little thing 1958 to whatever and that little line is a little but not it's the end or no and my destiny everyone as long as my destiny is in Christ I will rise again you are assured this morning the amen you're gonna be settled amen oh my goodness do you know that when you die you have a body already waiting for you [Applause] not will be made enough it was already me waiting for you but I'm saying before the foundation of the world your body was your tea or funny was waiting and God said you wanted you to be tested Abraham so in order to do so if I pass your tea or funny amen to bypass me something means that it have to be there you come by Spa something if I if you see me walking and I go around so you're gonna wonder what happened to brother Andrew why did I go so on the Tejano thing you could only bypass something amen and gods of jab Abraham said you see with the revealed word and all the time we are taught and told things that we see the whole picture yeah Christ The Mystery of God revealed he gives the whole mystery the threefold purpose of God so the whole secret is was compiling that amen and he said know that these things are open and now we understand things and the word has been revealed we understand why we are tested so we are pleased the Lord you are pleased just to be tested [Applause] if you take this one you have my next one [Applause] and another test he's the god of your testimony he's the god of your testimony and the only way you can have a testimonies if you have a test the first four letters of testimony is this so as long as you are in this body you will be tested you will be tried but if you up if you had come the regular line like the Lord Jesus Christ came from totally or funny to Word Flesh then you will have known all things yeah like he ignored all things but you bypass that and then you stopped down in this flesh but now amen but now you are hearing from your theophany [Applause] then I hear from mighty or funny enough you are here from your theophanic your word body is speaking to you I'm telling you you will have another test and another test but when the test come here 11 to say rejoice counted all joy your trial is more precious than gold so there is no purpose for trial there's a purpose for suffering [Applause] so God has designed your life listen first some of us may not have had the opportunity to go to a higher level of Education right but I don't mean you're not bright enough it's just a garden seed necessary so he take you straight into his university [Applause] or MIT or whatever that is not University in comparison to the one you are in you know you are in the highest School of learning [Music] [Applause] where where Paul went Saul Paul therefore when he became Paul he was carded to be the next high priest but that was that education that he had to be preparing to be a high priest was nothing compared to when he met Jesus on the road to the Damascus you know what Paul comes all the Education and Training on that Gamaliel gobar foreign papers and they have it frame and organic polsonized dog I said go in the Bible and read the Olympics listen I have one home from UWI and I could go where I was it have no value how old are you 65 so we don't oh yeah very good very good first class good good good oh good I wasn't the top of the class already but it means nothing they will never hire me I expired as wait until his retire at 60 years because you expired you're just breathing so don't pick up yourself you could have a hundred billion dollars in the bank don't you're still expired is that right one brought to you have exit now look at that what we put value on things that are not value but when Paul met the Lord Jesus Christ Dennis training started it is then we went to the backside in the desert of Arabia and then he met God then he met the pillar fire Danny new God Danny babe was able to sin or death was just thing or grave ways of a tree he said nothing [Applause] he stopped in his life he said nothing shall separate me nothing [Applause] a little a little problem come you're back you're going back to church he says there shake your heart your vex the preacher preach against me you vex laughs and you say nothing then take all that scripture from your Bible because it do apply to you because every little thing separates in you and your Bible say nothing [Applause] I have to be identified with that if Paul was the word and he identified when I am part of the word I have the same gene I had the same chromosome are the same DNA that I ought to be identified with him part of the bright tree listen when I won jeans on one gene so all is the same Christ in your Jehovah Glory so you are seated you are honor the highest Ministry the greatest light that has ever struck the Earth has struck the Earth in this day [Applause] oh my goodness don't you don't you know that this message is the greatest message the greatest light of all times there's no greater light that has ever struck the Earth the entire book is open the entire mystery is revealed The Secret Of God has made known and God by his grace has purpose in himself that you and I [Applause] that is why God has put us in the worst of age the worst of times because he wants you because you are passing through the highest level of training [Applause] foreign [Applause] but God is so uh concerned about you your Prophet didn't even need an education great education nothing from him well what he was empty so he was able to assimilate everything that God gave him [Music] [Applause] because he was preparing a bride without Sport and with ordering her hey you know brother was a brilliant man I'm not stuck like here no much but was knowledgeable in every aspect of life she when I listened to the TLs one this morning tell us when I'm taught that when you get sickness that virus is not a virus is a demon he was outside he was beyond doctors I'm going to some doctors and they see you know Mr brother I'm using unusual man he said you know how to fall asleep to God dream and he had to ask them he said let's go to church foreign only knew why do you think he was making that sense man because what the greatest scientists of all time what wanted to do he was doing already [Applause] I'm not a friend named Joshua yeah I'm friends Joshua the man who tell his son son stands still and he doesn't have the blood of bulls and good because if Joshua could contact the center and stop the son when there was 93 million miles away he knew he could have done it too if you are so surrender to God do you know the prophet of God say you can create a world and God live in it oh tell me which scientists could do that and yet we are under that Ministry it's not the ministry of our man anymore though is the ministry of the son of man God has come down God has condescended do you know that the the gentleman who took the photograph of the Hilo right Mr ayaz Right his son and daughter well I don't know which one of the two was calm the committed an offense and they were charged right they were sentenced to death capital punishment and before brother preached marriage and divorce he went down there am I right no one knows that no no 63. yeah it would have been 63 that was earlier we went down to Texas to represent them and he gone before a Supreme Court Judge a high court judge and presenter case and they had to reverse the judgment only watch a mystery oh gosh if he could present a case legally in man's Court and get to and do you know he presented a kiss legally for you and I so that lives that were messed up when he had the Revolutionary marriage annivers he could have preacher to 1963. he said bye cannot do that is going to destroy he stood in the gap and he said Lord bear Roberson welcome to my son Billy Paul so he said I cannot do that I need something Lord and God said come up and I'll meet you [Applause] hey he came back a new question when the cloud come when it was in February or March I wish it was haunted and if you're haunted crazy what leave me with my Prophet yes indication like that come and tell me yeah any one of them could ever stand and tell our cancer go they tell us pray that I can't tell a blind man or a dead man raised or whatever listen it's too Vindicated was not mine it was God in a man gonna prove the man's Ministry God Vindicated my Ministry God take a selfie with the man the only feeling no self with God during that long time [Applause] you know I don't know I just talking this morning there I hope I say something that makes sense forgive me the church people say Brother picture messages don't make your point make your point don't worry we'll say all right say I lose my train I thought I was gonna see yes science because we have all this thing phone become important and this and we are technology and we could switch on your camera yes where all your camera security cameras stop them until they're coming to open the door for them get a security system by the angel of the Lord and Camp around those that kill him we we know get what someone we can put on with food right you live on WhatsApp we live on YouTubers listen all of us are the problem me too you think I know how they probably think I'm talking from an experience you know because these things are designed to take your time away you think they dance stupid about six thousand years ago the only man who could help so you apply the word to deal with the Devil then the Syrian King was wondering how Israel know what going on in the house he's like Jihad what's up waiting here and it wasn't dependent on when he put it on God cannot put it on my mini bedroom when in the bathroom [Applause] a who opened the gate for Peter this is amazing automatic got to do in that long time [Applause] and ship the no start to float Elijah want to make an accent float up and come up until it's still on the water so listen science is superseded by the laws of God and the word of God everything is controlled by laws you know God put laws in place but God can supersede Allah a higher law so that when the fall took place God already had a law in place to deal with the Fallen it was called the law of redemption so the fall is not greater than the lawyer of redemption let me remind you you are not bigger than the loyal you have to live by the law if they lost aware seat Beltway seat belt no man law may have short comments and feel it but God law has no flaws in it [Applause] and God oh hello hidden agenda or no hidden little line under the line at all he said take up your cross and follow me daily it has nothing here in God has talked plane he said foxes of all birth softness the Solomon have a place all they want to come with me this message of persecution this message will have problem this message will make you different you went 15 you look different you dress the front to talk the front you behave the Frank you become an oddball so there's nothing hidden God is plain and he told Eve Aram sorry he said the day you eat from that tree that day you die nothing no big deal that I had nothing hard to understand come and see you go surely die girl you think Satan was sweeter adultery doesn't start overnight you know oh well a man or woman after you your dog's death you know sorry sorry pretty language you you've got to protect yourself bro and protect yourself see tell me we come good morning Eve you look lovely to this wow your hair looks beautiful tomorrow oh you have such soft hands all your eyes are so big satano's work you work over time historial weakness everything about you but God give man free will you know Satan was equal with God without creative power because if he had creative power he would have been like God but you know God was so confident with Adam he gave God made God equal with him and give him creative power Adam could I create Adam could I tell you three three I don't like how you look into they go a little bit and said let me get variation in The Greenery today at the landscape I look a little different and he had the power to speak it but he give man free will so that his purpose will be accomplished you see inside of God had the attribute of Redeemer instead of God had the attribute of Father instead of what are the attribute as Savior healer provider no unless there are needs to be satisfied these attributes could have never been expressed or manifested it would have never been realized amen so that in order that his great attributes that he had hidden up inside of him these things were locked up inside of him and he couldn't be God without it expressed and manifested it would never make him who he was that is why Angels cannot sing Amazing Grace they would they don't know what it is to be lost they don't know what it is to be straight they don't want to be an old cast but you and I can sing Amazing Grace [Applause] we know what we asked again we understand because you know what it is to be in our need you know what it is to have a problem you know what it is to be sick and you can praise them with an understanding you can approach him in a particular way your love to him is greater [Applause] my Robert Brown talks about you with the woman in Simon's house right who washed his feet the prostitute when she saw Jesus unwashed she said I cannot leave him like that at all because he had done some kindness to one of my kind the woman that was caught in adultery amen so she was identified he said this man have done such a deed such an act such a way he treated a friend of mine and that's how they have him she was not prepared to sit sit by and just pass him either she said I will do something amen that is why Baja expression was greater than even the invitations Simon had of him and when she was watching us with Simon and them look back with contempt and sarcasm if he was a prophet he don't know the kind of woman yeah but yet Jesus never moved he sat there because the purpose for coming is a safe Sinners that's the kind of people he was looking for they were previously looking for people where Rob said he said that woman at the well amen so she understood the woman at the well she went there she was in her 20s turning 20s she was becoming old and then he talked to the woman he said young at all once across twenties downhill the joy and beauty is that listen as a Christian you are not dying but you are you are looking for water you are closer to your body change don't suddenly agent Factor anymore study your body changes nearer I am nearer to my youth you are closer to 18. 20 the peak of your youth amen so there she was amen but God had a purpose amen before he left before the heavens had stepped down into our body of Flesh he left with that purpose the Bible say he had needs on this particular day Jesus you will be required to go through some area the Bible said he had needs to it was mandatory Daddy go to some area and he'd send the disciples away they did not want them to interfere with this purpose that morning he said only have gone by food all they're going to say about the Flesh and he sat down waiting for the woman to come amen Jesus was waiting for you and I Jesus is waiting for you and I he's longing for you and I to come to adoption he wants us to rise up to our full potential we are not predestinated to be children all our days we are predestinated to be a mature son and daughter of God you're stepping into your position the restores the restoration of God's power is back to his bride again you are living in glorious time you are living in a golden age [Applause] Jesus had needs amen and he sat there waiting for her and when he came by he started a discussion amen and the first thing she said you I talk in my own language right you're playing fresh with me or what you are all my the Bible say you look like you are not a man more than 50 years older that's what I thought the ministry and the labor of the ministry had him like that in fact the Bible said there was no form no Beauty no comliness that we should desire him the great God we like show we like to create the impression look good be your best this that go to the limits facelift dongle volcanalift Pennywise bathroom bomb radio commercial why you want to create an impression listen God was played and God wants a plane God know you when you had nothing amen say when Sarah went down to to Sodom and she met Mrs Lott he said he Caravans had passed through yeah and when he saw the new curtain and she when she saw the new curtains and and a lot Mrs a lot new here do I think she get upset she will begin to Foster Abraham living up in the mountain it had no rain the cattle died in her life hard and your letter good for nothing never yours take everything and if it's the old thing dog day if it's any kind of house like white living in in a tent although the holidays complained I would tell the ladies I want to watch a lady is a serious foreign was in a bad mood I don't know why I said I said I'm talking to my church people right so that may excuse this morning I talk about my church people so anybody from headstone cannot say anything I'm a disclaimer I'm a disclaimer I put in a disclaimer I have that legal right here I am not responsible for any damages anyway the prophet said she was in a bad mood she was not in an atmosphere to receive what was the blessing that was coming and do you know a wagon had gone down to Saddam but a wagon from heaven was coming down it was going to pass through Abraham went by the 10 door and he began to sit down you know what he was doing he was counting the blessings of God all the things that God had blessed him with all the Privileges that he had and that he knew and here was Melchizedek coming down not to make Opera he was going to give Sarah a makeover when God was done with Sarah even though she lied and God couldn't hit him God cannot hurt us because we are connected to Christ Alone it's not that you're good looking or you're dead nothing you know it's because you are in him he covers You by his blood he protects you you are seal this poor person that he covers you with his blood and Melchizedek came down to give Sarah a complete body change a complete body change that Ivana when he saw her she was so beautiful it was reported that if you see the girl with Abraham and his sister and all kind of thing because she was such a new creation come in every four man motion she was a new woman again listen friends if Melchizedek came and did it then don't you think the purpose of melchizere coming is to do the same for you and I [Applause] do you think Melchizedek just came for November Abraham said who is this male president he wasn't talking about the one that came to Abraham he wasn't talking about he said about this Melchizedek it is the Melchizedek that was in him talking it was God in him you know he spent more he talked and titles the message who is this Melchizedek but he spends more time uh revealing Who You Are in other words your identity his purpose for coming was to establish your identity you are not a Trinidadian you are selling a group European article someone said that's how people come complain about the indenture ship and slavery and all kind of thing all over the world right and they want re reparation or repatriation make up for it listen me I want to make up for that I thank God put me in a place where I know English so I could understand the prophet language and God put me in an environment God's purpose was for you and I to hear this message God know maybe whatever part of India or Africa you will may have come from God knew we may not have had the message yet so he pull it out and make it easier for us hey he put baratio in a position where he can get the message freely and be able to be a blessing to the bride around the world your purpose is to fulfill the mind of God it's to do God's will it's according to his great counsel of his mind [Applause] you are not just existing you are born with a purpose you are born for a purpose you have an eternal purpose temporary purpose Satan has a temporary purpose listen if people are come against you they have a temporary purpose don't fight over them listen God will deal with all our attend you cause Everything Jesus tells um Judas he said do we have to do fast amount as hard and painful as it was very much he said but go and do what you have quickly because you have a purpose to fulfill but I also am born with a purpose you see the laws of redemption requires that a man must die so God concern an angel God can take another Sinner and make him die God and you and I couldn't die for our own sins it could not equate for your sins that's why Baba said taking a man's life because he killed somebody is not going to compensate so what did God do God came himself he came back as Redeemer the laws of redemption step into effect and he came back and he stepped in in their flesh body so that when he paid the price the price was paid in full [Music] on the sun Redemption and when you look at Redemption you'll realize listen be he redeeming love will be my team and shall be till I die because Redemption means I'm bought with a price I am not restored to my former position I can no longer be charged I can no longer lose my inheritance because it has been redeemed God all that Adam lost in the truthful purpose of God all that Adam lost is now being restored that's why we are living in a time when markets go hunted and he can tell you God can come down and tell him your hunting squirrels he said well you speak how much you want and a man like you and I Jesus In the Flesh didn't create with what with anything new order nothing but Ramsay took bread and break it he took water and made wine but in this day he took the ministry of the son of man and he said you speak it and out of nothing nothing yeah oh my goodness what a time is the restoration of them did if all that Adam lost [Applause] God Wants You and I the message is not yet a contest the message is yet to put us in our position of comfort and Assurance to know as a Son of God I kept the same right I have the same privileges [Applause] God wants us to come up there amen oh God is so good everything about you is already known amen I don't know why they thought you remember Banks would you know is um they they were Jehovah Witness so they were always the father brother I think Bank started fellowshipping first because his son David had Adam polio and in the audience he was uh discerned and such like honey walked out so the brother come down the street not very bad who else to let them come he said well we where were you last night you say it's a good thing you didn't come outside because the man was like a shotgun waiting for you you jump truly went on went outside and he wanted to know if banks wouldn't know what he was doing everything about her says no no but they go fishing together and on the lake the the catch a fish and the hook is too big it pulls audience and the Lord said barbram says you're going to see the power of God and he thought it would have been some popular kitten that was got crush or something Joseph had Crush and he said the Holy Spirit tell them speak to this fish and he said little fish I give you a life a fish study and trails that come out Swan back to life and went back in the water [Applause] it went on when Brahm is telling this story to sister happy right she is standing there a little with a woman look at her attitude where the Branham isn't Society right everything that God does for us our purpose why didn't bro I'm going to brashikirian house so when I was saying the testimony or this one house and that guy because there are some things are not for everybody you know you don't quarrel if somebody don't see the message you even seated and just pray that they get eternal life at least just pray for one another and don't come them or criticize regardless of how mean people can be to you listen they're serving our purpose the idea to test you to see if you have patience they're here to test you to see if you have love listen the higher you go up in life as you you get treating your training never ends in certain Fields if you are certain professions as a lawyer you're constantly reading and you gotta keep our breasts at things but you move up the ranks and every test every exam that you have take you at a higher level so God is promoting us to a higher level he's gonna take you to a point when he has such a confidence in you that you can stand up you see it is all about character you know when you've got character you nothing is done for sure anymore you know nothing is done to impress anybody you know you are just you have humility you have gentle you listen you a man with real Authority he don't need a Fastenal he knows his power he knows his authority and you don't have to display it you just quietly and not the appointed time not Paul kraka so the demand and the Lord never gave him permission until a particular time is the same way that deal with it right away when Dr Bess was forces one question but I was without a annual argument Fall Apart didn't he never did anything and what is happening to us friends you've got to help La law God to develop your character those qualities those attributes that you move around with a calm and quiet assurance that you know that Jesus is mine amend sobraham moved around with purpose the same way Jesus went to the well for that particular one where Brown goes to sister happy rights host and he's talking and speaking about his squirrels and wherever she is she may be standing back I'm sure she wasn't in the Forefront and she she just said that is nothing but the truth and berbraham said the Holy Spirit came down and such a mighty way it cannot boost the room apart how do you say give her anything she asked for him to start if you want million dollars gold could put her in table if you want your sister eat it to be healed she can get up from a wheelchair walk and she said bro she asked for something that was priceless Priceless you cannot put out value on a soul and if for nothing else his purpose for visiting that house was for sister hearty right say I want the salvation of my they laugh at the right time and she said I want the salvation of my boys I give you your voice increase of God we are born with purpose everything that God has done has purpose amen let me share with you a little torture I I always said you know technology is amazing you know you know I I tell the church I said this iPod if I close it it will only open with my face I didn't know that right just without having a print recognition on your phone and accounting I won't facial recognition with this well when I open this I want this to recognize me you identified you're living at time with technology we are moving up into a higher level a much higher level purpose we said that purpose precedes predestination that's why God could have predestinated things you know God predestinated every individual the time would be born I was a general dedication last Tuesday I was telling them that when Jesus was born he had to be born at precisely the right time conceived six months before he was booted John had to come because the ministry of John the Baptist could only have lasted for six months so John had to come and the Jew Jewish system is that you're going to service at the age of 30. so John had to be born six months exactly so that when he stepped in into service he had a Ministry for six months and then Jesus took over amen so the timing of both John and Jesus had to be precise and here was a a barren woman amen never had a child and even when you know a boy's name Zacharias he should have had more faith than and then Elizabeth because he know about Hannah how she was born to could be dumb yeah so you see the the Revelation could come simply you know a big examples and somebody simple that's why the ordinary people will catch it and and the bigger Minds with all your intellect and things you miss the whole thing now because you're too confused with your science and your intellect just think God would simply plain Lord you said it that's why Mary said be it unto me according to I would Elizabeth accepted the word Mary when she was visited Ram said Mary was the daughter of Anna the prophetess in the temple spoke on what is the Original Seed her without mother who was in the temple had taught her those things so I went Joseph were discussing what the priest was saying her son would be born he said well you know that God from that time no longer operated anymore that was in them time and she said but that was song right and she was meditating on it but she was well taught by Anna you see the importance of her Godly mother so that when the angel came she was already prepared to receive it you are already prepared to receive this word your prayer meeting prepared you amen if you were praying and asking God he said Lord prepare my heart so that when the word comes I will recognize what my purpose is I will recognize my position so you're not unprepared but you are ready because you are meditating you talk too much about soap and all kind of dishwashing liquid all kind of other things now and you miss the essence of your life but when you begin to study and meditate on the word what does it mean she was able to say be it unto me according to Thy word and a virgin conceived never happened before will never happen again amen but the word of God is see the word of God impregnated us she received listen Mary just receive our word in them do you know that all of us came from one all human beings came from one man unless you didn't come from somewhere else I hope all human beings come how did God lock up the potential of every one of us in Arab you you try to figure that out and not one in 110 billion human beings was in one seed in one month sorry that's the infinite mind of God locked it up and if God can have said Adam and said at that time let every seed bring forth after its kind he knew down through the ages of time but Mary just received the word and that is why if you can receive the message of this hour the light that has come in this day then it will Quicken you the same way that seed world was quicker than Merry and a child was born [Applause] amen and just how God put our seed in Adam he put you in Christ are you notifications if you booked an alarm then you put listen if I take a corn seed and it has life and it is your mother and I plant it for 10 years time there will be Millions 10 to the power 27 million congruents come from one sin you won't see nothing else only corn in one little tiny season but God has purpose that seed has power seed has life seize their career and that is why the same word of God has power inside of you it has life inside of you [Applause] it's not how it will be it's a bit unto me according to your word I am a Son of God you're a daughter of God it has to happen everybody had increa there are lots of nature their laws of life amen are the laws of nature are portfolio the laws of science that man have discovered is powerful it was always there you know it's just that Isaac Newton was sitting on that fall and he decided to write the laws Newton's Law but for all life as long as there were apple tree and there was a upper will fall from a tree it will drop to the ground and he was asking why did it come to the ground and not go up in the sky and then he write the laws of gravitation but God made the laws there's a law of gravitation if I jump from here I wouldn't go so right and I prefer too far I wouldn't be foolish a jump because I could hurt myself but there's a lot of aerodynamics that if I had the power I could supersede the law of gravitation and I could fly and that is why God's word are more powerful that's why God Jesus gonna walk on the water he didn't need to follow Akin with this principle I know the law of rotation he just know I need to meet them boys only see the fish the frightened I'll stop and he walked out and one day this Supernatural will become natural [Applause] and that would mean something super oh my gosh do you know that brother I'm still this storm and the men were between him that remain when he came back he said what you can the brothers that testify that they were making so much a joke they were not in a position to receive that that here was a man who stepped into a storm that knew and he told them don't go in there so when it's not only get back to the camp and here it is that the almighty God spoke to him the almighty God spoke to him he said I am the creator of the heaven on Earth I am the one who tell you speak to these squirrels he said you speak to this talk and whatever you say is going to be that way he says storm I resent your comment go away he says son the same son that Joshua spoke to he said you shine for four days [Applause] and a storm Russia custard stopper storm China can stop a storm America can't stop us up all together they can't stop by storm but a man like you and I who are serving God's Eternal purpose was able to tell a storm he says storm go back to where you come from that is what God wants you and I we want us to be walking but I'm never did nothing for sure he said he could have shot it there three day will come out because in the atmosphere that was created the day again three of them and whatever third two phones go back and then he remembered he made a promise to God he said I will not shoot animals for these men anymore unless it's like an emergency and he said little the holidays are going to come closer he said the presence of God the atmosphere the attitude of a man the character of a man them there was Fearless in the presence of a son of God amen and they came close to him amen and then God said to him you remembered your promise he said neither will I forget mine I will never leave you nor forsake me say for thank you and the burden was lifted birram continues and he says crying and he's saying every form and motion I was a young man again he stepped in his tea off anybody his Millennial body the media was there too can I walk anybody he was physically strong it would have had to take something like the same way John had to execute John leaked while and he was an organic man amen he knew how good food was and he was strong and healthy I mean he couldn't die from sickness he'd take up by evil woman with a bad mother but his purpose was finished when your purpose is finished you should be ready to go don't fight up for more life your purpose done I tell them don't put me on no machine and block me and I don't do enough bypass one is enough we're not ready to go let me go you have to they bought anything so no way you're going [Applause] your purpose is done Lord let me go perhaps when my purpose is finished then I am finished with life because his purpose was greater than his desire his purpose was greater than his comfort his purpose was greater than his suffering his purpose was greater than his desires your his purpose is greater than anything you gotta see purpose if God have allowed something there's a purpose behind everything [Applause] do you know that Jesus even though Mary was nine months ready to give birth his purpose was that God determined that Jesus will be born in Bethlehem the least of the Cities not Jerusalem not bigger Bethlehem or Hebron or other cities he said he had to be born in Bethlehem listen yesterday why it had to be Shepherds because Shepherd would understand sheep he was the Lamb of God Eminem high priest and then my pollutant men couldn't understand though Jesus could have been born they missed it completely but it came among Shepherds that why God will bypass all the other churches and come to you he comes in humility he comes in your home he comes in in your life he sits with you you'll be driving and he's in the car [Music] when we get into that state of mind when we remember our commitment when we remember our resolve then he comes in on the scene demand and the almighty God I love this so much the almighty Creator he stepped on and he said want to walk with me oh my goodness all the almighty God amen the one who said let there be light and he put the sun in position and he said you rule by day Moon you roll by night and science every past six billion years this summer being in its position he said it has enough power in it it has enough energy in it to run for another 6 billion years because our Word of Our God almighty God said let there be light and if that same one speaks a word that there is going to be a break nothing [Music] I think a million years they can take a billionaires but that bride has to come [Applause] are you understand how powerful it is do you know that only five parts and 10 billion of the sun energy ever is good 9.0005 percent the rest is just dissipated into space and yet everything is ruled by Nissan if the sons of shining how long you think life will last winter will come suddenly into Trinidad death will come Darkness will come an all life will end and everything that I've ever lived naturally have lived because of the energy of the Sun [Music] and think about the power behind the one who said let there be light that's why the prophet was able to say this spoken word is the original seat because the same power that generated I have a son operating and controlling all these systems and the climate and the the various conditions of the earth that same power is operating behind the word of God it is the same power it is not less it cannot be diminished amen it's all connected to purpose and there's been a light that has been determined that will shine in this day nothing Paul's day nothing nothing Wesley day but this day but in the day of the voice of the Seven Angels when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God will remain in the hood this secrets of God will remain known I am thankful that you and I are part of that mystery we are part of the secret in fact the bride is no longer a mystery I said it bright it's no longer a mystery there's no secret to the bride anymore she's coming into manifestation what do you think the word is doing you why do you think it's transform in your life why do you think God is working on you Jesus when he met the woman at the well she started at theological discourse with him he said she said you are not water to to draw you want to give me water Jesus said he said if you knew who was talking for you to you you would ask me for a drink I wonder if we knew who have spoken to us in this day do you know who have spoken as it was not man from Kentucky no this was the message that came from the almighty God God took a man with no form no comliness no height no looks you check Billy Billy Graham and all robots powerful men but when he sent the messenger to the bride simple humble but do you know who has spoken to you it was not Mad Max it was the one in Revel the one who was determined to fulfilled by God predestinated listen God's purpose was so powerful in his life that he couldn't hold no high tension wire he wanted to change God's purpose he said Lord there's pressure too much I can't take it no more my wife got my daughter gone it too much he couldn't stop God purpose [Applause] there was not another man to fulfill Revelations Luke 17. hey that was written in the book long before he came I I want to tell you something if he was written in the book don't you think his purpose for his comment was also written in the book the reason for which something is created born or exist if God sent Elisa we know these things let me remind you Abraham said look you mean to say well he said no no it's from your loins and then the seed came right that was the natural seed but the natural seed is not as important as the spiritual theater barbraham said his spiritual seed will come the same way though just so Jesus came to connect this to your funny you and I will one day reconnect theory of funny let me put it this way no you're connecting to your theophany [Applause] not will connect you know no you are connected to your theophany [Music] axi Lord he said Lord he says surely in your word this just before he preached chosen up right there he says surely in a word I don't know where the time going look out that's idle threat purpose is greater than your comfort your desires your Ambitions or your complaints it is greater than all of that purpose is the controlling factor of your life God's purpose [Applause] he said Lord surely in your word there must be something to tell me what my purpose is I mean after he the seal is already opened he know Malachi four and five then God tell Mrs when she asks you Lord will Bill married me what to do will I leave the house you know because she was looking after Joseph and she opened the Bible and she opened up Malachi for behold I give you Elijah the prophet she closed the Bible and she was confident she's enforced again after that God said the date and everything for my Ram to marry her amen I'm sure when Revelation turns them come he knew he was that when you really sealed you realize that he spent more time in the same seal talking about the ministry of the son of man he was not elevating himself he was elevated in Ministry of God it was God what an effect the same way that John the Baptist uh fulfilled the scripture he was fulfilling scripture and he said surely Lord if there is something there must be something in your word that will tell me what my role is and he opens his Bible randomly to Genesis 24. to go find our wife Isaac an inclusive Bible because now he knows that his ministry is to get a wife for the Lord Jesus Christ you know what he preach after I believe he says sheep I'm ashamed I didn't realize what my calling was and next message he preached was chosen of a bride the whole message is designed to choose a bride and to dress a wife for the Lord Jesus Christ [Applause] no we make the mistake of the fine Brother right but you cannot minimize his ministry don't try to take away listen he was a friend of God he was a friend of God he knew God in a personal way he knew what he looked like his only he could tell us he looked like half man we're gonna take some Roma Italian painting all kind of thing with all kind of fish I think he said no no he's not like that this was taken from the uh the ritual rulan Jesus he said that is how he looks like because he saw him he was a friend of the the Lord Jesus Christ amen he said no I realize I was sent to choose a wife so do not underestimate the ministry of the prophet you cannot take his place you cannot replace him his ministry has already come and God that is why you honor do you know who speaks to you when your pastor stands before you he's an angel from God that is standing before you he's ordained by God to see you through you cannot supersede them you cannot rise higher than him that's why you should pray for him don't underestimate those establish Ministry go be on your phone by talking I don't like how we preach I didn't like how we invite brother Andrew we should invite somebody not your business [Applause] you see he's a lover of God at all here listen his one desire is to see you come to maturity to see you come to adoption why do you think he'll labor why do you think he spent time he could have been doing many other things in life but this is the greatest purpose that he will ever serve that one day he can present you to the Lord Jesus Christ oh my goodness do you know what a joy it will be that when I must a servant of God can say Lord this is what I have done he didn't bury Talent he didn't he take his time his resources his efforts his pain being a pastor or pastor's wife is not an easy job you know and don't ever feel like this how it is you know they have to deal with every situation his pain becomes her pain when you are sleeping and when you have the two miles of dealing with situations and this and pressures and all kinds of things coming against him when he has to deal with the planning of a convention I think it's sleepless night that's why the officers of the church they serve a purpose and every one of you that's why you shouldn't have sent yourself from church you are serving a purpose [Applause] everything is you are born with a purpose you are serving an eternal purpose I tell the church after coveted about this is called long covered and long coverage they must stop coming to church stop really they didn't want to come to church in the first place I'm not being offensive I'm talking to my people I never seen the scripture where he said extremely service it's a forsake not the assembling of yourself as the man of some long-covered patient is let's say the pastor may not invite me back but let me tell you I want to tell you you know sometimes preaches because he want to share water in mind to your own people right but you use the excuse right so this is the excuse to express why why would you want to miss the Rapture tell me why would you want listen this is the picture of Jesus looking at the return ruler so every time you look at the picture in your home if you have one remember I hope you're not looking at the ritual again you know we have it you know but is he located he asked the question he asked for the most valuable thing good Master what shall I do to be a bride to be in the brain the highest honor in the land in any man's life is to be the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ you will sit and you will rule with him and would you turn that down listen when Rebecca went to you you know you know we are privileged you know you go into this exam it's an open book exam I understand no when we do example you never know book I want to know them to do exam with our open book I still try to figure it out at all the information is ready but you have an open book exam because you know the kind of wife you choosing denomination don't know that them never opened the book when you do an open book exam before you open the Pokemon because you'll be looking for page and chapter and you know where to find nothing [Applause] but if you have an open book if you have read the book you know precisely that way being a doctor easy if you had a bird right another day because what you know is not that you could remember you know but you know where to find it and you know how to apply it so it's the application of what you find and to put it in the practice so then it becomes easy because you already pre you have a foreknowledge of the whole now you know purpose then you can you know first you see Joseph when he went down into prison break O'Brien Joseph didn't know when God gave him them dreams that's how the sun and moon and the stars go ball before him he didn't know he gained soul and slavery though that part he didn't know that she born on that was good all of us know he's bride right nice dream but you know how bright come here you see I'm having a little problem I want to stop and know about all your questions I really want to stop you how long I tell myself enough is enough so but I always don't blame you is the people I don't know if there's my people are your people but all of them together causing some problem here [Applause] listen being the bride is not that easy take it off do you know what it costs Rebecca to be the the bride she watered 10 camels do you know much water camel drink a hundred gallons and it was 10 so she fill out a thousand gallon tank that morning a young girl you ask a girl to water One camera yeah mad [Music] and he didn't ask you to watch any camera or she offer but you see she was in an atmosphere she knew that day her blessing was on the way [Applause] she she left home ready [Applause] just give me water for myself she said not only will I give you water but I'll Water your camels I feel she had training [Music] listen if you never work hard you can never walk I don't know [Applause] [Music] kind of nails them people as well you could cook food with that you know how to knead flour you know the Belair roti Brothers KFC and Double Tree the rest of your life sorry to tell you that McDonald's and pizza but Rebecca I'm saying this Rebecca halapu personal life she wasn't just living you know for anything she knew exactly what she wanted something that will will be a blessing to my life and there was that quality and character inside of her so she would have left with a poor person she would have gone to the well that's why the brothers didn't want you to go easier because they knew what she meant to the family [Applause] right but she knew that this was her calling in her life and God has sent a prophet and Eli is again he know exactly what the master wants you know the quality you know the character he got it nature everything that God does is with purpose he made his son for a purpose he made a water for our purpose he made life of a light for our purpose he made seeds with purpose you check the main things and you could check the old creation everything in God has order it has Harmony it has continuity is a hybrid and it make up fruit and a carrier produce itself God has had seeds operating for thousands and maybe millions of years and it hasn't changed I want to say this morning the same power that was in the word of God that they did the entire creation the same power will produce a bride without spot and without wrinkles and the greatest message that has ever hit the face of the Earth has come in this time to bring a restored bride and by God's grace that eagle have went searching that light went searching you know it's like an exercise missile when did that first come about now we know technology is a little more advanced than that it could switch out and be directional nothing can stop it anymore it will fine you exactly where you are and it is determined for one purpose listen in God rich and mercy Abraham said you sometimes we question what I will make it or not here's my position on that berbraham said if God wanted me to be an antichrist he said that is what I want to be you know why he could say that because he knew God purpose was greater than him his exists if that is God's purpose for me that's what I want to be if he sends me to Hell after all I've done he said Lord that's what I want us I will still do what I'm doing because I'd rather serve your purpose and we should live life to serve his purpose Joseph as I was saying Joseph went down he was sold into slavery everything is connected or no you see the whole plan of God from then to no it's a whole plan of God that is now we can see it in review what has been done but now we are living in the climax we are down to the end of the line what was in types and shadows the reality the perfect realization of what he had in his great mind is coming to fulfillment that's why he saved the best for last not that we are the best maybe we are the weakest you think of men like Paul and Peter and all those great men that even the men who lived the truly Reformation the kind of standard decision they make maybe I put the weakest at the end of the line well you know what he will take the weakest to defeat Satan when when Goliath you know that was a champion he was big tall huge intimidating trained everything and God said let me take my weakness let me take a Shepherd boy he didn't take a fighter yeah what I can do oh my goodness but in that sling amen there was a power behind that there was an anointing behind that there was no Shield that Goliath could use that stop that stone that stone was moving like a greater than an existent missile that was an intercontinental ballistic missile embedded in a little Stone so [Applause] because it's zero in I don't know where the crack was in Goliath helmet but the Bible said the stone sunk into his head astounded bombs off that sticks color he won in Boston and God and God has chosen little David's again insignificant nothing to defeat Satan foreign the best that Satan has to offer the greatest the Gaga better than Dubai better than what America but you could go Shanghai and see roadways and cars and network and Tesla and this kind okay real style but this bride this bright will not be faced [Applause] you know Elijah boss and how it's remote and it this and that listen what was the airplane the airline that Philip used foreign Star Trek was doing that a long time ago what was the airline or the spacecraft that took prabharam from Earth in sunset Mountain into the consolation of angels 26 miles up in the sky you say I can show you where I was what was the what space where did he have on that's what he said he was caught up he said they move at the speed of light they came from there and I flashed there was on him and you wonder where that was the 27th I'm sorry whatever how many days in February 28. what did it take I think they were moving at the speed of light they were not Timeless dementia and their purpose they came and and shrouded amen the Supreme judge not just our ordinary children things bad here [Music] tell me the time you see here and all bad he ain't tell me the time there's a purpose for a clock you know oh I would like to think we step into eternity but some people may be saying when this mango stop we I know we're hungry well my I have meat that you know not of [Applause] off now that that's coming friends all that happened this supreme judge came down with a purpose he's the ultimate Authority when program is speaking it's not him speaking at all is the Supreme judge using his vessel you see how things go to the privy Council and in America is the Supreme Court this Authority is the supreme authority so that is why he's able to see that you are sinless you are virtuous you are the bride of Christ as I explained you said what do you think I do in life I want my wife to know before before we get married right somebody thoughts we have in my mind not that you should hide anything but make your path clean if you understand what I'm saying but he says regardless of who you are you are sinless he came down to establish your purity your perfection that his choice in choosing you couldn't be any better he said I couldn't have found a better wife are better people are more honorable person amen when Salman went into Jericho there may have been many other beautiful women but you take rehab you see it was all in God's plan enough it was not just random error gods look what take a root for example you know root was a more bites if you check rude family history she was born from incestors like you know is zlatani daughter live together and do you know that God locked that seed up inside here and to bring along at the appropriate time oh my goodness but God determined that that is how that seed was going to come and you and I may have come through our lineage you may do like your family history so maybe thieves and robbers and bandits or whatever else or what kind of History they have I don't know but God is not looking at your history God is looking at the Eugene that he placed inside of you [Music] and God rich and mercy barbraham said when God met Paul on the road to Damascus he said the word saw the wood that you are not you will be the worded you are already the word when I was conceived I was just a little speck Barbara said the woman at the world just had a little bit of understanding but it was sufficient when they see the light shocking the waters rocket it came to life she became an immediate evangelist she went on into the city she said come and see a man and she had an authority because she knew what she was talking about you and I will leave with an authority this morning that God said I have chosen you let us all stand and give God praise this morning maybe I'll Stand and praise the Lord is
