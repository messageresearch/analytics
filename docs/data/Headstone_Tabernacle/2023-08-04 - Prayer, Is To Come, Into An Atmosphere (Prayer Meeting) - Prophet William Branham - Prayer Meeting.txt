Isaiah 639 it says in all the affliction he was afflicted and the angel of his presence sees them in his love and in his pity he redeemed them and he veered him and carried him all the Deeds of all and the emphasis there and the angel of his presence well last Sunday I replied a message in his presence and I shared some things before we play that Heap because I I felt a lot to do that they came to my heart about that message I've listened to it and it came into my heart about playing that message and I met sister John Oliveri at the bottom of research where I come from the office and she had sent me something an error and I told her it wasn't an error she was sharing something about Christ Mission God revealed I said it's not by chance I told her about this message in his presence I have to play it and then when I went up on my desk and I know this is something actually on Sunday but I somehow I feel to do it tonight when I went at my desk and this was clear and clean there was just one spoken book on my desk under my shock it was in his presence so I want to know how did that book appear how did that book a deal why is that book on my desk because that's very unusual I don't really have these spoken books on my desk you have I sort of a side uh a cupboard where we have those books and so on so when the assistant pastor working when Isaac came in I said but Isaac I said you know what they come into my heart that I have to play this message and no that was not a day we were playing a message no that was before it was everything with before I said and here it is this because on this desk how could this get you how is this possible so then he begins to tell me that when but Riemann Thompson was preaching he asked him to get a spoken with book and he went and just pull out a book out of these shelves that was dear and he just gave him that book and it was in his presence so you're kind of mind-boggling how all the pieces come together that I fear the lord is pointing us where we need to go where we need to be so in the light of that I want to read or testimony for you and this is from Brother Kelly's South he said yeah brother over this is after some this is regarding this person a message on presence some years ago I heard you made a statement at the end of a service but who is somewhat like when you get up on the seventh step you enter initial Glory that is where True Fellowship takes place those words struck my heart and I've been praying for it since that time recently I was asking the Lord what I should read I'm not feeling particularly inspired randomly choose a message called inspiration preaching always borrow Kentucky 1956 it was good but in dear he said the next night he was going to preach on the Lord's Second Coming so I decided to read that one also and I was surprised to find that the next nice message was titled the supernatural considering what Buddha balance said it was going to be about however this message has taken my breath away in dear he speaks extensively about presence although he often referred to as an atmosphere yesterday while taking a break at work I reached a part where he speaks about praying in his presence and she came out and I found myself stunned at his words afterwards while sitting at my desk listen to worship music I struggle not to weep as I considered what I just read it seemed like all I've ever wanted in life was setting right there in those three paragraphs although I pray that work I have no place to go like a tree like I wanted to write them so as soon as the lunchtime came I got in my truck and drove out into the countryside weeping and crying out to God to have what I just read about and I'm so blessed because I was able to check that message out and I want to play a little 10 minute script for me tonight but I want to title this tonight what I'm going to share with you prayer is to come into an atmosphere I extract that for something but around said and I want to read his voice and then we're going to play a little clip I will get them in prayer go to Brandon in this message called the supernatural it's the attitude of the people that brings the results that's the reason at Pentecost they had to go in an upper room and pray until the Holy Ghost came cause they got in one place one Accord it is the atmosphere that brings the results you believe that every man woman this villainous morning boy or girl get everything from their minds but the Lord Jesus and believe that he is standing present right now and you will see something happening that will cause headlines in newspaper in the morning that's right is the atmosphere I do believe in joking from the pulpit because the pulpit has no place to joke it's a sacred place but a Mr buzzword said I have a good sense of humor he said brother Brown to prove it's the atmosphere you could take a hand egg and under and put it under a puppy and tie him down it will hatch a chicken see it's the warmth of the puppy's body that will hash the egg they don't have to be under the hand it has to be under the puppy it could be an incubator it's the atmosphere here we go and it's the atmosphere that brings the miraculous and wonders and powers of God Among the people it is the atmosphere of the people note he didn't say the sermon of the pastor he didn't say the mystery of the unfolding Revelation he says the atmosphere now is the atmosphere of the people doesn't this sound familiar a minister kind of being a Revival they take the people to bring a Revival in their home he's talking about the atmosphere so it's the atmosphere of the people and when the people get to a place that they are reasoning and wondering and stewing and thinking and all talk and don't know where they do stand are for them not even scripturally taught how can you expect the atmosphere to be right you can't do it it won't be right it's got to be one Accord one place settled down with one motive one thing then you're going to see something happen no friends I want you to take these things like this tablets like if it's a doctor order these things as if it's cues as if it's uh special instructions and guidance and leading of the Holy Spirit don't don't think we're rolling that dice I believe that the footstep of the righteous are ordered of the Lord and God guide us into things and I want you to place closer content in just about 10 minutes and listen carefully to what the prophet is presenting praise God Amen so we want to go straight on that now by God's grace just one minute three Divine Healing and sanctification and the powers of God is as long as your faith lasts in it when your faith fails then your experience is gone it's based that way simply upon the finished works of Christ the calvary you're Sanctified as long as your testimony is right as long as you live a Sanctified life and believe that God sanctifies it you're sanctified count it all to his grace and his merits and as long as you can accept healing and believe your healing and and go on believe it like that you'll be healed as long as you believe it and you start doubting it and you take us a man sending you this morning it's all a bit sick and let him begin to get in his heart believe it he is sick they're packing all the buildings as your faith is so be it unto you that's our Christian sign I'm not meaning Mind Over Matter but to see the thing of it is it's the atmosphere that you live in now this man that we're going to speak of for just a few moments and I want to give you a testimony this man Elijah the great prophet was a man who lived in that constant atmosphere he was a cow man a Nazarite first all gifts and callings are without repentance it's nothing you can't make one hair black or white you can't add one cubic to your statue we only have carnal impersonation when we try to impersonate something that God hasn't made it if we try to do something that God hasn't called us to do we'll be a total failure doing it if man would try to make himself woman woman man how would you do it I met that woman that was exposed to have the surgical test and be made or man-made a woman whatever it was and Italy in Rome that you are the disgrace to being a woman drunk as she could be walking up and down the streets and or harvest sites you ever seen notice you can't make yourself anything different from what God intended you to be anything else is an impersonation therefore if your conversion is on because you're trying to hide behind something or trying to make yourself a better person you're only playing a part of a hypocrite until Christ has actually come to your life and change you and brought you into an atmosphere that's the difference of it that's the reason we go through so many different farms and saying they have to do this Jesus said he's a year of my word and believeth on him and certainly has everlasting life it's not a make-belief it's absolutely something that's happened on a conversion of the heart that's changed and brought you into another Realm men are misunderstood Christian women men boys and girls are misunderstood who live in those places because it's contrary to the Natural run of life among people of the world I'm sure we all want to live in that atmosphere look the people who eat the man out you're on the ground was eating the same manner that the high precede in under the Shekinah Glory but this man have withered away out on the ground but that in the hidden place never did wither away that lasted to the spans of years and a man who walked in there won a high priest went in beyond that Veil that Veil that separated the holy from the holiest of holies when he walked in there the veil dropped behind him that man he gives even sound proof he didn't just shut off from all the world and the surroundings he knowed nothing in there but the living and the presence of God and a man or a woman had ever walked into that Shekinah Glory of God the whole world shut off behind him no matter what the devil says you don't pay any attention to it and he's living in a different atmosphere he lived in there where they put Aaron's robbed and it was nothing but an old Dead stick off of an olive tree but once laid in the presence of God if yielded what it was supposed to be in the beginning and one night's time it buddies blossomed and brought on that's the same way that an unbeliever sinner has ever laid in the presence of almighty God over the influence of the Holy Spirit becomes a new creature right then life becomes fruitful Fresh Life comes in and he yields what he was supposed to be a son of God we were took off of the tree so is that Olive Branch he would talk also a tree but Sinners and and lukewarm church members become dry sticks with some kind of a memory that sometime there was a supernatural God in the past they had life and way back there but if you believe and lay in his presence it'll produce the same thing to you you will realize that you were born Sons and Daughters of God that would yield the Fruit of the Spirit but you can't do it out there in the courts you've got to do any dare on the inside hid away the man out the course he walked by daylight some days it was like this raining other days it was Gonna Shine the night time to be dark and stormy he had his ups and downs that's where you see people oh they say we're healing the good man of God that's right but where are they living they're living out there eating it in an atmosphere that they should not eat it in the next man he had another life that's not the owner he replaced by seven golden candlesticks some little lamb and sometimes I'm Lance burnt low and they smoked up the chimneys and you know how it went the smokes and go down and a man who comes to the place where he comes into the church how the courts out of just the lukewarm church member and comes up to live a pretty good New Life In Christ he's separates and things from us but he's still living under lights that will get damn and smoke up and artificial lines but when he once walked in behind that whole list of holies walked into the presence of God and the failed falls behind him there's a power man or he can eat every day every hour of the week there's where he's living in the Shekinah Glory or nearly interlocked wings of the Germans the great Pillar of Fire and the Shekinah rested there and he's living under there he can't be nothing but a real genuine Christian anytime men and women who live in there are misunderstood you see it they become peculiar they don't hear the things of the world if they do they don't pay attention to it they just move on God never put that in there for nothing God never comes for just any haphazard way prayer is not a uh perhaps prayer is a sincere thing prayer is talking to God prayer is not get down shut your eyes and think about your washing or your work you're doing said Lord help me and John and you'll Miss Jones and so forth that's not prayer that's repeating some words the prayer is to come into an atmosphere where you realize that you're in the presence of God and you're moving to them in the deepest of sincerity first it's a worship oh Jehovah how I love you is it then after the worship of prayer then you come with a sincere heart asking if ye abide in me not to laugh behind the curtains in the world today and run around try to get back in the curtains tonight if ye abide in me my words abide in you otherwise if you're like Aaron's rod that's pulled up to the Shekinah Glory by the golden pop of manner where you can eat at any time and your soul is refreshed and blooming nearly abide if you abide me my words abide in you that's what you will be given to you the Sea of failures of the church the Pentecostal Church the Methodist the Baptist and all it's a failing to that abiding grace of God the night you shouty clap your hands and dance in the aisle speak in tongues that's gifts gifts is no good unless you're abiding in the Shekinah Glory those things are fine I have nothing to say against them they're of God shouting and blessing God's wonderful speaking in tongues or translation of tongues or I mean interpretation of tongues it's the same but uh and all these other things Gifts of healing prophecies all these things are marvelous but they're no good they're not fruitful they can't yield the right unless you're living in the presence of the Chicago [Music] the atmosphere around you Jesus Godly that's the reason that men and women are not permitted to these things because you'd go out here and call a blessing over something God had cursed or or cursed out and God had blessed it's a fighting presence to know the will of God then don't look what the world's going to say about you it's what God thinks about you then you're living in his presence oh praise God praise God then you are living in this process you appreciate that word tonight so God is not just talking about us feeding on the word but feeding on the word in an atmosphere and what does it take by in the night Conformity to the will of God in thought and purpose and in action you have to begin to receive and absorb the thoughts of God speak the word of God and then act upon it let us borrow heads and let us pray father God I thank you tonight for this word and Jew season Lord abide in your presence when I pray to become a living reality tonight as from the description we read May the angel of his present School Lord and visit the people tonight and we know the manifestation of the holy spirit is that angel so may this great Holy Spirit visit every heart here tonight visit him in prayer he and answer their prayer and filament the Holy Ghost In Jesus amen and amen since God bless you and as we get on in prayer you think about it there's no way around it we have to get into God's presence and wait and t idea so may you have a great time and pray tonight as we get on in prayer praise the Lord foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music]
