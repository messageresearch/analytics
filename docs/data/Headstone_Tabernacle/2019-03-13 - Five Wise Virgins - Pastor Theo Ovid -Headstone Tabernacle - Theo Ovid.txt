pleasure my lord been also and the Lord said unto Abraham wherefore did Sarah laugh saying shall I have a surety be a child which I'm all is anything too hard for the Lord at the time appointed I will return unto thee according to the time of life and Sarah shall have a son Matthew chapter 25 similar Scripture then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be likened unto ten virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom five of them were wise five of foolish they that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps while the bridegroom tarried they all slumbered and slept on a midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps and the foolish said unto the wise give us of your oil for our lamps are borne out but the wise answered saying not so least yea enough for us and you but go ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves and while they went while they went to buy the bridegroom came and either were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut afterward up came also the other virgins in Lord Lord open to us where the answered and said verily I said to you I know you not watch therefore for you know neither the day nor the hour when the Son of man cometh let's pray father we thank you for your word tonight interpreted our hearts we love you we adore you we worship you we thank you for this great opportunity to come into your presence into your house and to learn of you and to receive from you and in this when we expect a dynamic power via come amongst your people Lord and baptize them and fire but the Holy Ghost tonight in GCM I ask it amen and amen you may be seated oh praise God thank you lord well said I still be choice him from Sunday I felt as a different turn a new season among us that the Lord went up blessed and I log on report mightily do we believe that tonight just three little words five wise virgins five wise virgins another inspiration get ready and still ready oh praise God get ready and stay ready this Christianity is not a part-time thing he's a full-time thing it can be a part-time Christian deliver the full ten devil or glory Liguria be fully committed oh praise God isn't that right no but a Branham he had seen earlier with his shop you see there's three woman carriers of the natural seed until it matured into Jesus Ishmael could not be he was born from the bonds woman and Isaac was born of sex between ciarán Abraham but then come along Mary by the vision put produced Jesus Christ that's gone the world no look there were three woman there are true women type here churches the woman always tied church's tree denominational ages carriers which must also die so therefore just like the shock and so forth to give room for the seed the seed cannot get right until the shock stalk leaves all dry that's right it sucks every bit of the light in them and so it's all it all it was is that plus or praise God so the seed cannot write until everything has died and what the sea does the seed draws all the life on everything so afterwards the life is contained in the seed the seed has the lights or blowing of God he said you cannot do it nor with the cetane or play time or glory the shocks are dead the shocks at Jaya this is the Virgin would time not touched its virgin remember it's a virgin good time if you're putting in the hands of the nomination it won't be a virgin it will be manhandled she's got to be virgin not touch my interpretation always I love it there'll be no denominational manhandling in the virgin bit of the brain or glory to God the bride will be pitted and there'd be no manhandling of the virgin put of that bride that's why the Lord Himself descended with a shout or chlorine I've got to get the bride oh we believe that hallelujah so when the Lord told him pick up a pen I was right he said no watch in the last days the true the church bride comes a headstone will be a super race as she neared the great headstone there will be so much like him that there will be in his very image in order to be united with him there will be one and that's why we say the Holy Spirit come back on drying the Holy sprit have to come down on a hat my sphere of praise and worship double United with Christ I have to be like Christ whole globe I really got that to realize it with Christ you have to be like Christ or glory to God so therefore in the upper room that wants to be worshiping to create the atmosphere for the holy s--t way to come down the water vapor coming up on dead Oh glory to God and never kill never not dead they come not in the atmosphere Oh glory that was fast user Street he was preached Villa's prayed for two and a half years for five hours every day the church was it was was was being channeling to prayer Liezel being challenged the prayer why it was power coming up on a sanctified life let me say it again it was power comment on a sanctified life and I separated life because God put Wesley in that position clean the touch up for your point of the spirit or chlorine upon justification pick up the duty class certification wash the dirty glass back to Holy Ghost pour milk into the glass or do you believe that or glory to God so the first son was a spoken C word of God he was given my brain oh my the bride was given to what to reproduce himself again another son of God so this terminology called bride it's for reproduction purposes so Jesus want to reproduce himself began a brain to produce more sons just like him so you had to become just like him how many believe that not a church member but a reproduction of the grain Oh God Lord hallelujah the bride was given to her producing self again another son of God and she fell by high breeding she fell and caused him to bang the second son spoken seed word was given a bright like Adam so Adam his Bridal fell right but before he could marry her she fall also okay then from a little group of the true seed of the word God represent Christ I've been love it bright of version of version of his word on tonight we sing on the positive five wise virgins Oh glory to God I want to touch the foolish I want to talk about the wise one Oh glory to God she will be a vision for the world isn't that right how do you believe that then what a virgin who knows no man-made creeps and dogmas what a virgin knows God said so God said so my side mom healed God said so if I'm justified Oh glory to God I'm called of God I'm already justified I've already glorified God said so or glory to God I am Joseph there's nothing against me because God said so the bride will be Joseph isn't that right so the bride believes a word it doesn't matter how old you are you believe the word it doesn't matter if you look like you can produce it again you believe what God said or glory to God see repunit in the heart I'm all woman how I expect child and gorsek is anything to have the Lord if this man is a tough call if you wanna think herbs and exercise and walk on Savannah you're in trouble that and work him you need a miracle they need a body change give me that transformation you need something happen to you that's the same thing happened to Jacob that's why he asked Jacob who are you I'm a scam I'm a deceiver I'm a cheat he said God I could change you know because you know what you are Oh glory to God I could change you in what you are to become so that experience transformed Jacob by wrestling with the angel but he

tonight characters got a gift we can wrap the wrapped and give it to you and shake it focus it take that home with you faith is not transferable either experience is not transferable you can get a testimony of an experience but we can't transfer it to you you have to have your own Pentecost of your own experience you have to meet your pillar of fire you have to get up Gordon County [Music] Oh glory to God but we could have a revival my revival is my revival you have to get your own revival or glory or may start tonight mates that no I want a revival of power of science of Wonders of miracles all of that when I sign up myself for all of that not just the seven seas on the pregnant power who he is the seals and equipment power open the season Anna took mercy yes but dynamic raise the dead too dynamics producing vision he said we shall revelation upon revelation upon revolution baptism on top of baptism baptism fishing on top of vision upon vision what did you see young men seeing visions visions they all lie time take what to give your vision tonight Oh glory to God gotta break upon your spirit tonight open the womb of your mind your womb of your spirit God could reveal himself for you tonight praise God the word is in the bride under mind of Christ to know what he wants done with the word and she does it in his name she has dust saith the Lord then it is Dimmit eyes so the Holy Spirit waters it until it is grown and silver its purpose he had a big bomb the only do his will only as well no one can persuade them different so this bright about attitude this pride about behavior you could talk you could see you could explain no one could get her to do otherwise Oh glory to God if we doing what the word said to do that's what we're striving for that's what you want do you want that they have touched our Lord or they keep still then they will do the works of God for it is himself in them continuing his word to fulfill as he completes in his days all things when he was not what was here he did not complete when he was here for it was not time yet let us turn like just one killer as we see the promised uncommon insight as we see power coming inside promised land promised land was the land of promise the Holy Ghost from say the Old Testament New Testament the promised land is the land of the Holy Ghost a comet in a land you're in to go into that land is the land of what is the Holy Ghost Lamb Oh glory that cause Allah know spirit and power Kenan represent that wound he goes friend and that Lana war and battles and fights but is a Holy Ghost RAM Oh glory to God that's why when they cross over the first terrorists are circumcised them people who was born in the wilderness because circumcision was still required not because you cross into the land there is no circumcision Oh blow times a fight for your boot right toe glory to God hallelujah they still have a comb on the cotton Oh glory to God I just like the faith isn't that right they still have to come a little cotton hallelujah and he said today I roll away the reproach of Egypt because don't you circumcised because the lamb belong to the system sighs okay the love show circumcised so now you can understand white deer because in who is that uncircumcised philistine will keep the Lord a shout David knew who the land belong to or Chloe therefore as long as you're not sick I'm saying I could take you out or give the Lord a shout praise god damn it at the book right all them guys know they belong to God hallelujah children Israel oh come on now hallelujah hallelujah praise God let us stand like Josh one killer I want to skip along now for my Jenny Voss he said no watch look at this revival what they had the rivalry last three years Luther revival went in a nomination moody usually rather last about three years but this one Quinn over 15 years not one denomination as far from it this is see time there is no more shock after the shock is gone it is seeded cord is ready and if he isn't doing it now he's going to call a church to perfection by his word Jesus Christ or glory to God we believe that hallelujah praise God praise God alright what time is that he said see time so let's look back on what we read on Sunday when the baptism of the Holy Ghost was presented a Methodist they couldn't take it no when the see tiny has produced a Pentecost she can't take it she's organized but she has been a carrier of the seed Oh glory look God you know people pastor's message in the 70s and 80s all around they pass through the message Oh glory to God hallelujah but you are seed glory record mmm so what did the Prophet prophesied see time will produce what another Pentecost hallelujah let's go but I'm talking about Abraham and where's that wife Sarah she's dead behind you he's I'm gonna visit you I please don't prolong I'm going to visit you according to the time of life and you're gonna have that baby that you're waiting on he said any breaking but around in prophecy the Lateran is fixin to fall you have held that seed in there long enough now believe in you are looking for a common son and he is coming why I can't see that the Lateran is fixin to fall oh give the Lord a shout on that do you believe that when you're born speak it to yourself pray about us and Lord I know the lettering it's fixin to fall get ready for I'd stay ready Oh blow you and I said get ready and steady Oh hallelujah the latter in is fixin to fall that's guaranteed we'll get the Lord I showed about that so the rain is not a problem it's what seed inside of you well can the Lord a shout and if that word seed inside of you you have you will you must reproduce the life of Jesus Christ or glory let go because the seed of God inside of you hallelujah praise God remember there will be such a denominational gathering pretty soon it will be terrific and they will bring themselves together in this Federation of Churches and then this kind of change will be put out of operation as far as they know it's at that time that Jesus appeared and he will show which is Brian which is not what we remember Christian friends I'm a man I can make mistakes but God being God cannot make a mistake all the words that have been written must be fulfilled so we have got things here in scripture that must be fulfilled and that is one of the things this point to come but before the boycott tantrum or the mocking of the beast there has to be a seat short for God to take a church out of it that's what's important these messages to sort of see that they could take out because the my words are spirit and my words are lies so Willard is also a spirit and you're gonna find out the foolish virgins they can't get the oil because they don't have the word the turn of the Spirit Oh glory to God or get a lotta show glory to go when you come to Simmons they come back extra oil God release the oil and wood form nor the oil I want to turn into spirit the oil I want to turn into power the realism of the fall and the world will live you know what brother I'm calling me up Aroon dry seeds he said they'd haul themselves in the upper room there were dry seeds waiting for real crises and they afraid crises and the fearful crises and awaken on the promise and when the day of Pentecost was fully come my god the rain began to fall upon them dry seeds and the uppermost to Strong's feel smaller because I'm seeing him to grow and smell all praise God it was too small in the upper room or glowing and they were filled with the Holy Ghost when I found Reims hell on their season and this message you are being a Jessie for long enough but the freeness fixin to fall [Music] do you believe that do you really believe that Nick ready fair or come on church you like reggae this message you do not tonight man ready for the ring [Music] from borders evil age he said no watch in obedience this little feet woman that lives by faith the bride hallelujah believes the Word of God obediently written in love for the promise of the age to be consumed within promises but you have to look for to be consumed that's a different thing going together hallelujah when God still Abram I am your shield and great reward look what Abram tell called and I tell you this Abram suddenly beat with God I chain this I don't want to reward talk I want something in reality God said come on calm these guys cuz I talking a different talk now I want to show you your future present talk themselves out point and showing you these times to show you what gonna happen in the future that you will take a different view of the present do you hearing me tonight he said comedy at social I see be he say holy change the name for now but continue to walk and fit change any from Abram to Abraham

specials nice singing clean life everything order long dress nice tie jacket matching and everything else that missing the rapture but this is frightening the same thing with a different version under wise version they were both sci-fi people but this one I Dora this one did not have oil they were they said we are cool as you are there is none of us good as far as that to concern why are you a bunch of holy rollers there is none of us good we have all sinned come shall glory and the only will ever know it not by Jordan Church not by trying to live good but by receiving Christ it ain't what I live in is what he was in what I am is what he is you live in that's your life when he lives in you that's a different thing altogether iguana's that's what you see in preacher god have to do something for you Jacob got the world right arrow but then when we got to the angel he recognized this in this book right is welcoming trouble to begin virginal then I continued this way I have to be changed he had a choice holy in tongues I'm s all mine give a testimony next day and it's just just I didn't talk over the angel we didn't just say nothing wooden shall do nothing what you feel I was briefing God around you to hear more testimony about the person of the angel you change no you still scheming you're still chilly it's still what but you have a testimony of a angelic in point but Jacob wrestled all night long and he was so locked in money I recognize this man Alessandro so he must he put his tie off that joint besides I ain't going here until you bless me then the angel talk what is your name because I bless you have to call on what you are I want to know you know what you are there's nobody chicken like me I'm exploiting this thing he said you no longer be called Jacob change your name tonight Israel but you know what when he got on there his walk is different he have more than a testimony yeah but change life do you want that more than the testimony you hurry to write no testimony and they turn all real testimony yet you want that change life so when he walk no he walking a limp in no here what kind of style you can't walk when he pants fall off his bottom anything like that you he walking limping knows walking he walk in the front now he walk like a rich man he walking like a book man a weak man but a man who are poor with God he looks naturally weak but yes power he has so much power his brother no longer intimidates him he's no longer afraid he have an assurance on the inside no it's nobody brother they get frightened you're going to see a next man can walk into your presence like that you have to watch out Oh glory to God hallelujah humility is real power you know all glory to God you have won that power inside you could do like if you have

all of a sudden something changed and people get caught they get caught 30:50 still right just right just still holy holy still young boy still you have the word in you would still just get caught snapshot fixed condition nothing changes after that Oh a sudden a message changes it's not what you think it took me going to church is what you believe and receive in your heart what all of a sudden go out to meet him and they were weakened and when they did this one could go in because they are all in the land that was the difference this one could not go in where there was the ordinary lamp they went back to pray up to receive the Holy Ghost oh so you mean this oil is takes you beyond the letter of the world it takes you with the burden to receive D only goes yes yes and while they were gone it was over the domination say well maybe we remain wrong maybe we better go back and seek for the baptism of the Holy then the raccoon come how close this is coming then they are now going to try to bear turn your tip on Gino you get it while the when to buy they're trying to buy now all the teachers are trying to have a revival they're trying to go back will then happen this message after why the teachers recognize what they have because it will take more than explanation interpretation and revelation it will really take a power that's why the prophecy a national force would put the church in the works on Constitution but the power of God will put the people in the brain we need power until I said you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost come upon you that is acts 1:8 that is all power come in know you need this not just for you but for your children that they get the mask on so that they be sealed also you as parent have to have a burden for your own children not god's
