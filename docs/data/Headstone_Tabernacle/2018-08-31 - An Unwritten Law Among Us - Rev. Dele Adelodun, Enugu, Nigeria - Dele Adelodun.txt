for the wonderful privilege we have to be called your sons and to be called your daughters thank you indeed for amazing grace that appeared to us in this last day you chose us not because we impressed you not because we look better than anyone else but just your election just your love we thank you even a father for this goodness that you have done on two hearts like King David said in the Holy Scriptures our soul will never forget this benefit that you have given unto us we say blessed be the Holy Name thank you for the services that have gone for the blessings that we have received the heights and the depth that you have taken horse the comprehension that you have brought by your spirit we pray Lord that those things will help us together with the ones that which are here tonight and the rest of the convention days Lord may he be Madiba those things that we draw us closer to you sharpen our experience in the Lord take was deeper you know take was ayah in your joy tonight let every soul and of your spirit that we do wonderful things on hangers charge the atmosphere with your Divine Presence bless the hearts of your people we prefer thy servants whom you have used that you will reveal them back the virtuous they've lost may you heart back to them those that you are good no use may you give option and grace unction to the speaker and grace to the hearers we bring forth those who might still be on their way that you will bring them in safely among those all that we have left to be here may you watch over give us a real capping in this missions that we're all will be Hoover our coffers will be full and we shall go home a blessed people thank you for the host pastor we had that you bless em your blesses family you will bless their offices in the charge and you will bless the entire congregation like your prophet will say they have done their part o God may we enjoy this part I mean this part minister at the entrance of your kingdom on to our dear heart bless your servants everywhere those who might not even have opportunity to speak that supports the goodwill may you bless them bless every one of us once again we commit the night this night into your care that you will visit us one more time at the end of all things may we give you glory as we commit ourselves your word and this atmosphere this time into your care in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen the Lord bless you Church we welcome ourselves in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I do not want to keep you standing so I would suggest we read the Bible so you can take the comforts of your seats and which was the Lord to take it from there if you have your Bibles with you please turn with me to the book of Matthew chapter 6 amen Matthew chapter 6 I would like to read the truth verses there verses 9 and 10 and I we also read from Matthew chapter 7 verse 7 to 11 and we take one of us from the book of Deuteronomy chapter 13 Matthew 6 9 and 10 after this manner therefore pray ye Father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven amen and in Matthew 7 verse 7 Jesus our Lord speaking here he said ask and it shall be given you seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you for every one that asketh receiveth and he that seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be opened or what man is there of you whom if his son hacks bread will he give him a stone or if he ask a fish will he give him a serpent if you then being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children how much more shall your father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask em you believe that the tirana main chapter 30 Deuteronomy 30 verse 19 13:19 this was one of the Moses valedictory message he said I called heaven and earth to record this day against you that I have such before you life and death blessing and cursing therefore choose life that both thou and I seed may leave may the Lord Artus blessings to the reading of its only word god bless you you may be seated while how will remain standing I'd like to welcome every one of you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and we thank the Lord for giving us another opportunity again to be in Henoko and to also be in the Fellowship of brethren of like precious faith I want to appreciate precious brother Charles for giving me this privilege to be of service to God's people is that the bridegroom and waiting wonderful I thought you were too busy with preparation god bless you brother Hartnell yeah yeah so I was thanking the pastor for giving me this privilege to be of service before God's people trusting to God that somewhere along the line we can be of a blessing and I bring greetings from home from Pastor and all the ministers the officers the entire congregation they are sending accretions I do not bring the greetings of my wife because he's here with force together so as many as he has opportunity to greet she will greet them home but I'm bringing those of my children the alum to be here for what we also have a family function of somebody very close to also at pass up listed around the house for sometimes she's getting married this weekend it would have been important for us to also be there but somehow because they're spiritual people you understand why we have to be here so we have delegated and donated some of our children to who lest we create offense let me also use this opportunity to thank the Trinidad team for the wonderful time we had they give us and when we are in Trinidad [Applause] maestro a few of it was such a wonderful world and brother heizak they give us the best treatment anybody any guest could wish for around there so may Allah bless you bless mama bless my dear sister I will welcome me for comment thank you for my part of the theme of the convention I was meditating on it and even the host pastor was sharing some of his thoughts around that with me it's cause they would make a bride eros and I was thinking of it and 30 years we thank the Lord for the servants of the Lord whom God has used for us today and we thank the Lord for the blessings they've made the thoughts that they have brought to us may the Lord bless yourselves god bless you sir god bless you sir so my my thought was running along the line of what past week he said that for you to be an hero you've got to be victorious amen and I know that one of these days something will provoke victory for the bride of Jesus Christ brother Bram said and the message look away to Jesus he said in this spiritual race the permit me to use some words just like this so you can pick it it's like two vehicles that are running side by side and you wonder which one is running faster it's about in this spiritual raise the vehicle of the message of the hour run far ahead of that of the Antichrist it's at what we are doing now is slowing down and that is why it looks like this in-law of this law of that but there is actually no law it's a part of God's program after MIT Reviver Jesus took time to rest on the boat and the disciples were saddled with given testimonies of what are taking place amen but then something happens the storm came and it provoked Jesus to be called back on the same so that is why it will look like maybe things are slow in the economy of the bride it's actually not slow it's all the walking of God's program we are given great testimonies of the visitation of God in these last days but one of these days the Prophet said we are waiting for this Antichrist automobile to catch off is that when it catches up is a watch the tarpaulin is that what you see temporarily manifested now will come in its fullness so nothing is out of Quetta friends but so that this roof of this hour will note that a bridegroom is still in our midst and full of purpose on purpose like Boz was given a gift commandment to the young man is that for this lady she has served so well every once in a while give up on us so these bonuses will be going on all the time so miracles signs and wonders he means deliverances great things will still be taking place it might not be in the quantity of your expectation but the law we prove that is still in the midst of this bride all the time so we severe a regime of the Antichrist tightening up and that you wind up to such a time that it will provoke what is in hush and then you will know that God is quite literally since on heroes and some champions you are not going to live here without some sort of display because god bless you god bless you I'm just giving you beautiful comfort you aren't going to live here without some sort of display this is the seventh age we are back to the feast of as we rose again you know as well as was one of the richest King ever known he had control brother Isaac over 127 prophecies I don't know of any country that has one run 27 states eh all right even addressed it has got 52 or 50 what all right now what this man ruled over 127 and for six months the Bible said it was dis plain is worth and nobody saw the same thing twice he had so much to show for six months then after the six months displayed it decided to have a feast time for seven days I you spiritual so it fits there it will tell the guys you haven't seen nothing yet because this King had in his mind that on the seventh day his greatest treasure is going to be displayed that greatest treasure isn't his auto mobile isn't this beautiful palace the greatest treasure of Oz Arras was his bride vasee a type of the Pentecostal church refused as well as that display that was what introduced Esther somebody who looks like a stranger to the economy think about the blessings of the Jews becoming the blessings of the Gentile sorry I have not started my message tonight Alleluia so anyhow esta in blood Providence because it must choose a time was selected among the visions that will appear for consideration now each of these virgins when they came near agar agar was the Kings Chamberlain who is the preparer of vigils when they and the man was made an eunuch so that it cannot interact in that manner with any of these girls so if we have a negative a it never gave us a seat it never give us his torch it never gave us his opinion he never gave us his idea all right all right all right that which I received from the Lord like Paul says the same i delivered that was what is like ID now but a guy doesn't fuse with no man it gives you what you want so each of them were common with the opinion of what they taught we make them acceptable to the king and a guy was given it anything you want with this last is a guy you will get because it represents the only lights left and is got or shine upon the tears and upon the railways there are no two songs just one Sun as um it doesn't change the seats that you have it only transformed that same seat to come to its maturity whatever sit whether good or bad you need sunlight this is why Judas Iscariot had to come and be with Christ I think it will be wrong for us to suggest that Christ never knew who Judas was from day one it will be very wrong he knew him and his role is very important his induction into a posture ship was not by accident because their role is to fulfill pizza cannot do it and it is unnecessary if you and I will be here to rejoice our salvation so I knew it and they put him there and this guy needed Jesus in other for the seat in him to come through different developmental stages toward it is that equal fulfill its purpose just as Peter needed him even just as you needed him we all need him French that was why the dynamics of blood Pizza Judith and everyone was in the hand of the same person when Judas Iscariot became a ripened by Jesus assessment he gave him an inspiration that which they'll do it too quickly and when he gave that message only Judas understood it in the context in which it was given so French all this I don't know how many of them agree maybe 1,000 ladies were many they were they all gathered together and they were asking for this for that for this and a guy was dishing it out but the Bible made a remark when it came to the time of Esther the Bible said Esther required nothing as such what a guy in his own wisdom so she wasn't leaning on our own understanding she has dropped a passionate belief she wasn't living by our opinion she had a testimony like a posture paul i live by the faith of the Son of God so it would be like a guy you know the King better you are closer to the king you know what he likes you know what it doesn't lie whatever you think you give it to me there was only one man in this age who was closest to God they call him William Branham he said I was another one that appeared at Ohio River but I was the one nearest when he have here is that a man is what we fail you are not feeding on me body on the unfailing body words of the son of man only one man one day God was so happy with this man he gave him and Hoffa would you like to walk with me and hand in hand in the wilderness that we are walking together so it qualified by every standard to be the a guy of this hour he qualified to know what and what's that as well as of this our King Jesus what 'likes [Applause] so when Esther prepared herself by hey guys teaching and she appeared before as well she became the delight of us we rose because as well as who see is reflection in our and what Vashti lost Esther gains and she became the final display you know what I've just been doing since telling the story of your life so don't worry one of these days the vindication that you are ghost heroes for this hour will come to full manifestation I congratulate you all you love him tonight by the grace of God if the Lord would be over here which I trust he will I want to speak on a subject I called an unwritten law among us an unwritten law among us and not to keep you in suspense is not a big subject I'm just going to speak on choice a great thing yeah but the chance that wanted me to also join brother Heiser to have some time for a special service with the young people but I will be unavoidably absent from the convention from tomorrow because I'm locked into about three or four conventions within 10 days and so I covet your prayers as I travel to Zimbabwe tomorrow yeah so but then that is why I will not be able to make that who wanted something that way then the regular service but I was trusting God for what to do and I think I find a friendly middle point between death in the regular service so this is why I'm going to speak on choice tonight amen so the profit College an unwritten law among us in the message chosen of a bride all right now choice is a law of God like it says it's not written anywhere maybe sections codes and so forth and it affects our lives on a daily basis consciously we make choices and unconsciously we make choices we don't live in a day without making some form of choices as you are sitting here this evenin the dresses that you have on is not the only shirt or blouse or sketch that you have or suits that you have when you run through the Wardrobe and pick this one and leave the orders you have made a choice on that détente where we were invited to eat they have two or three varieties of meal when you pick the one you ate this evening and you left the others you've made a choice some of us all live outside the camp are the convention ground probably many routes or routes that leads to this place or even in traveling down when you play on one and left the others you have made a choice so it is what we do every day day in day out but that is not where I'm going we am going is to wake you to this consciousness that the choices we'll make have consequences and the consequences of some of the choice that we have made is the reason for who we are today the choices we make affect our yesterday it is affecting our today if there's a tomorrow the choices will make now we also affect our tomorrow and I think this is why we must give some sort of vent to the thought of choice when people are growing up they will come to a time they call a duel isn't years it is an age of self-discovery and one of the features of that time is to refuse to be told what to do and you will start hearing the people telling you look I'm old enough at least I've clocked a thin you should lama tsong some greats to take my decision it is inherent in man to always want to have his freedom to take decisions it is an energy man to always want to make his choices and God also understands - what I want to tell you something this evening that you're making a choice by yourself is actually disc complimentary to your creation excuse me you are not designed with the capacity to choose by yourself and be correct the Bible says in the beginning God placed man on free moral agency and that gives him the right to choose whatever he wants free moral agency is called the ability to make your choice without being interfered with whether divine or physical you can take your decisions and do what you want but there was a reason for which God gave man that right everything you see today as its origin before time way back in its eternity that is why our lives and whatever we do and what is happening to us there are no accidents in age in eternity God us to things he wanted to achieve brother bronzer added at the time of this discussion God wasn't even God we can call him hello him the one who exists by himself and it was just all alone to himself but inside the desire of this Elohim what's a desire inside this thought was a desire to be God the meaning of God is an object of worship so what we are saying that is that at this time nobody was worshipping him he has no hope he has no subject he has no worshipers but in him was that desire to be God are you following me now also in aim was a desire to be known beyond being God it doesn't just want to be God it wants to be known beyond being God because inside him where are the abilities so if you know him just as God and you don't know image and other abilities it will be so distant in relationship to us but there's a problem here these abilities of God by which it will want you to be known cannot take place as long as there is perfection so God is building a platform to eat his cake and to also have it back thus follow my story it will become clearer as we go God wanted to eat his cake and he also wants to have it back he wants to be known and with God and it wants to be known beyond being God what are these abilities in him the Prophet called them attributes for spiritual language and is there inside God was an attribute to be an illa a healer a deliverer a Savior and what does a redeemer goblin - I've got spiritual people here it's got all these abilities in him but as long as everything remains perfect there will never be a need for this attribute [Applause] we are still in eternity we have not come to time for you to know that the introduction of Satan into the program was not accidental if it was accidental then God is not in control of all factors of life then the one who cannot be in control of every factors of life is not qualified to be my god so this was why after I finished all these thoughts it designed a program to bring it to pass he created the angels heavenly beans and they started singing holy holy only unto the Lord his desire to be God is achieved if it never brought any creation beyond Earth is already God because there are now worshipers but some of the things that he also wanted to do cannot take place in eternity you know why eternity is perfect that was why when Lucifer became contaminated by iniquity even the Bible said and there was no more space for him or there it couldn't continue his tenor hope in heaven is got to be trimmed down because eternity is perfect and is all around us all the time so what did God do God created a loop out of eternity now the IT people can help us better they will tell us that this is the program for this chain for this chain and when they make presentation some people will do a critique and say what if this happen watching that upon that was okay we never thought of that boy you know what we don't need to cancel the program and start writing it all over what we'll do is that we create a loop out of the original program to take care of that matter and introduces back to the program God was the first IT specialist God was the first programmer God was the first that is still the first software developer and in his own case nobody after telling in you what you want and in knows what is doing friends I'm telling the story of your life all right so you know what you did it created a loop and that loop is called time then we started airing in the beginning God created heaven and heart God existed before that beginning what time was just a look out of God's eternal program to demonstrate is other tots and huh tribute so that when the days of such demonstration is over time we blend back into eternity so nothing is out of Keita nothing has ever been out of kata and nothing will ever be out of Peter it's our God Father in his program so on earth he brought all manner of creations than the last it brought forth a son now when a brought forth this son this son was like his cook out of him and that is what made him his son amen so this on the Prophet says his men are being brought off presented him as an original creation now it is impossible for original creation to create a condition that will make other attributes of God necessary underline that it is impossible because Adam came to the earth as God it scooped out of God when God baguettes a child or give birth it gives back to God by the law of reproduction let every seed bring forth after human gives back to human God gives birth to God that is why you need another birth and you can only be reborn because there's a gene of God in you which is called a seizure your new batch is the quickening of their gene Alleluia which we start forming Christ in you you love him tonight all right God brought for this man and they called him original creation because it came out of God now because of the process of his coming it can never ever sing it can never create a condition for the attributes or the attributes of God to be manifested so what did God do God decided not to bring his wife the way he brought his son all those things of reasons then the Prophet said he brought us as a by-product now that's not a derogatory word if you understand it it's just that we take something out of something that is already created the reason abroad in this formula is to be able God was setting the condition for those other attributes to come to pass tighten up a alright now when it brought for this man the Prophet search in other for him to be successful to fall to be able to fall he gave him this gift or this privilege or this right they call free moral agency the ability to make choices would have been interfered with then in order for the woman to be able to bring the fall because what happened was that Adam accepted the fall she never fell that's what the Bible said it was not deceived it was the woman that was deceived now I'm saying that God created that woman he brought up in a way that she could take the deception it wasn't also an accident and you can study marriage and divorce spoken word book and find out those things there you can begin from paragraph 152 on all right so a brother the professor a brought our even with some features which he as God in His Holiness cannot put in her oh yes because those fishes are perversion features and that is why she doesn't look like other females in creation as a matter of fact the Prophet said sit and give our shape that is what godly sisters do not get too conscious of their shapes that is like bloodless sisters don't we upon me inside dresses I hope that's not offensive if it's offensive forgive me and spend how us and the mirror looking at the contours and tones when you have that you exhibiting the features of a Papa Chet fellow the prophets that our beauty sorry I will step up some of my languages because I don't want lead to people to take wrong impression a beauty a shape a sex control they were all fence not undead to her by God and Dustin's were there for the purpose of being in the shape to bring their fall and that was why when the devil who has the knowledge of the principles of life came into sufferings and gave him that knowledge seven new you go true in the garden now the common of serpents into the picture in Canadian Satan was not also an accident this is rather professor and when Satan has brought to pass that which was necessary to the purpose of God it's all within God's purpose so ever Saturn is being used to achieve God's purpose Satan is not as powerful as you ascribe him it can never - beyond what God allows him is a true one of these days that ever we'll find out very soon that is only being used it will soon be dumped like a trash now God was put Adam in a position to use that choice ability that's where we're going so the woman is there the serpent is there created in the manner in which it was created upright creature who talked correlate even his blood could mix with the blood of human being and cause reproduction God did those things for a purpose then when God finish order he went up into glory brother Bram said he gave him that ability to choose by himself knowing by that it would fall so when you are boasting about this is my right very careful you are preparing platform for failure because I tell you this evening that ability is this complimentary to your make of the Bible called you in lump that's the makeup of the bride he called you a sheep a sheep as no right a sheep cannot lead itself a chip has to depend on the shepherd to lead him and ship cannot make decisions that is the nature of a ship boy he is God trying a free moral agent ability to you you must know that there is something suspicious so don't worry don't ever glory in that right god bless you my brother don't ever ever glory in that right if you have twists wisdom don't treasurer's have don't look up to your parent and say you can talk to me when you begin to show that you exhibiting wrong symptoms brother Brahms that you exhibiting the character of a fallen nature that is why in the seals is that when we are redeemed with no longer ones our ways you are created to be latch and the message looking at the unseen the Prophet made a flood statement it might look root is a man must not even think for himself because the Bible said let the mind that was in Christ Jesus be in you so if the mind of Christ in you demand of Christ do the thinking this is why I said if you are coming to believe that open where you got no such coming you've got your opinions and your ideas barrage you are going to live by your personal belief of who God is you will live by the faith of the Son of God not by your faith in the Son of God all these things we're God's divine calculation so that they fall that would make the attributes necessary to take place so serpent and Eve cross themselves serpent Eve cross themselves you saw what I wrote and that when they cross themselves let me tell you when I fell nothing as a punch to the head nothing has happened something terrible happened on the earth or to the earth only after Adam became involved if Adam never involved himself if may perish alone and that will continue imperfection but then this was the reason why God gave Adam the ability to choose so glad for that is I'm in heaven and turned his back waiting for his son to decide brother Brahm said God knew that by that it will fall because if we choose something that would make the demonstration of the attributes necessary so free moral agents the choice given in the beginning was designed to make you fall because ordinarily in yourself by yourself you can never choose correctly you are not designed to do it it's not your chemistry it's not your make off so get it right [Applause] this was worried that I ronamayk achieve as nature is that I place before you life and death blessing and causes that's free moral agency in other words but the Lord you know at your makeup in those that you would if he allows you to do it you will choose death you will choose a course the next line a whisper quietly choose life choose life what is that showing to you Anna God wants to influence your choice he shouldn't have told you what to choose by the convention of free moral agency to allow you to take your decision but if you are is own you don't have that right as you think you do the only person God we allow a free fall is the Serpent's each the prophet and a message god of this village is AG Lord is not obligated to teach concealed Rijn revelation is not obligated to teach them is will they can have a free fall but free moral agency is not for the seeds of God because the design of it in the beginning is to bring if all are you struggling with her please don't struggle with her because I will put you to a point you wish or another choice tonight you will surrender hey you are going to live here with no longer my wheel no longer my way I surrender [Applause] you love him tonight so young men young women it is not as free as you taught his freeing God has a purpose for that amen and we thank God for the open book that is declaring the will of God for when Hannah made that choice don't forget read in the scripture it was only after it made his choice that God came down God wasn't sleeping God wasn't lost on the program before ADA made a choice but it designed it that way so as to make him necessary the demonstration of his attributes now the choice the header made has the far-reaching consequence does the lesson for horse fire region we need police today because of the choice of ADA we need Ospital today because of the choice of ADA violence is everywhere because of the choice of Edom now let's not dwell so much on Adam because Adam is gone this is your day the prophet in a message by faith Moses I don't know if I will be patient to read but let me make attempt amen Desiree's read it all right in the message by Pharaoh Moses he told us that you also you are today what you are because of the choices that you are making it maybe this moaning wind even in Solem is a discipline that there'll be men and women set in here that will make your final choice you are today what you have because several years ago you chose to be what you are now for a minute look at yourself what am I Who am I whatever your conclusion is it's not the product of now it is what you choose some time ago if somebody woke up here this then said call me doctor dr. Sam America dr. Sam well brother Bram said call him and what he wants to be called but if I do not understand your history when I'm sick I know better than to come to you yeah because to be a doctor is not just by saying call me doctor for you to be a doctor today in our country I will use you will have run through primary school secondary school six six years nowadays is all right another six years in the university with one year Osman ship and another year of youth service by the time you added together you are doing about 20 years before you become a doctor so it wasn't the day they come file with that degree that you made the choice amen you made the choice several years ago you came into secondary school and they asked what do you want to do you said I want to do sciences they move you one side and you chose the course those were the tendencies towards that so the day you were given the degree wasn't a choice day the day of the degree is the reflection of the choice that you made several years ago physical types the spiritual so oh you are by your hand such a night did not begin now it's a choice you made yesterday your today is a reflection of the choice of yesterday your tomorrow will be the reflection of the choice today let me read further I hope it's going well with us is that what you choose now will determine what will be five years from today so it's not too late to make good choices now is that five years from today you may be a missionary five years from today you may be a renowned Christian oh five years from today you may be in hell because you made the wrong decision five years from today you may be clinging Spee terms in the barrels or five years from today you may be a prostitute on the street don't say it is not possible you some people have proclaimed the message who have jumped on the anointing who have said Amen somehow there today attacking the same message some people said so longer and around the message so true say because you cannot be in the message and depart hmm brother Brahm said many is an attraction within the range of the message they said so long the day they renounce the message the next day the sisters are wearing trousers pants then you wonder what their values have been for all the years they've been around so don't say it's not possible you come to that because of catalogs of areas areas of Prayer areas of disobedience areas of no study of the word areas of playing Church and yes of even not knowing where you come for where you in the house of the Lord when dustin's build up to a level that your system can no longer unduly you crushing box Latinas so look at yourself again tonight and say what am I Who am I this is the word of the Lord five years from today look five years pass look five years tomorrow and it is not too late to make the right choices you love them too now what am I trying to show what am I trying to show is to let you know even though our choices sometimes are unconscious yet the affective effect in our lives then if the case be so the professor has an advice for horse amana would like to hear his advice you love him tonight yes the Prophet advising listen to this I'm glad for the patient to reach tonight is that my advice to you is when you are making choices don't look at the modern things around you and the popularity and glamour that could be but choose rather by faith choice is a battle between sites and faith sites is seen through human hi faith is seen through the eye of God choose by faith amen all right it still advisor knows and that faith is a revelation here it must be God's choosing it cannot be ours we have no choice coming and is already chosen now what God chooses is right I can choose wrong you can choose wrong but God cannot choose wrong so what are we to do handle by your choice to God now listen to this one is that it is best to have God's will that's what I thought was they will be done the kingdom come we must submit ourselves to his will and is wait don't question it believe it don't try to find a way around it just take it the way it is we must submit ourselves to two things in any step you want to take in life in order to fulfill Tutera know me touch in a chain we must submit ourself to his will and his word I think when there's an hand it shows two things this is the Word of God amen but the message of the hour is the will of God is it sinking there are times when the word of God may not be the will of God it remains the word of God which is not the wheel of God it's very simple to crack in the days of Noah let's just give an example it was the Word of God for Noah to build an ark for that age that was the will of God physical ark that is as many as never entered the hock they perished by the floor today it remains the Word of God but a physical ark is no longer the will of God any man can do it and go and say I have a scripture for it you'd really do it's the end the Bible but if you do it today it's not the will of God there will never be a flood to flow to your heart to begin with flood they have been off Lord if there's another flood on a worldwide global basis then God broke his Convenant of rainbow to know because God told him I will never do it again so your heart will be useless it was the Word of God it was the will of God but today it remains the word it is long long guys will this is why in every age God sends his messenger to declare his will out of his word so that when you follow that wheel you are automatically fulfilling Genesis to Revelation it's automatic don't question it believe it don't find a way around it the Prophet said if you look while we are around you will get but any way around the will of God is permissive it is not perfect God may allow it it will never accept it that's what the word says are you listening German the way we are being born our natural birth is an example God allow us to come that way but he never said that each this is why when God Himself came in flesh he commanded you must be born again [Applause] walking in permissive will is very dangerous the professor you could even find God blessing UNH but at the end I want to tell you you will lose Moses gave Moses give the order of service and the articles of service and they placed each ministry into the opposition but some people who are politically minded thought that Moses was just allocating so many things to his family because Aaron and the seeds of Aaron take the priesthood while other Levites take the ministry to read the word and to preach but it is only the sons of her on that can do intercessory work and you know sometimes people feel one ministry is better than the other it is not a spirit of today it has always been around so this is the reason why Korah Dathan and abiram we are never happy with that fine arrangements they thought it was Moses boy it was God so one day they funds the courage to challenge Moses but unfortunately it was a direct challenge against they reveal what for that hour it gives that we love God for that hour is that you take too much to yourself Moses says you sons of levy you have too much problems and when a Kunal I could not ruin them him he said to what you want then this guy's they went to pick incense and the sensor to offer the incense and it looks like karana param and the time was after it will prove to you that if you know we also know like many important to have the same level of Revelation like William Brown today it is far from you [Applause] [Music] it is far from you it's just that you don't read your work very well the last dispensation of prophets to the Gentile is William Brown there have been no other person on the field after I'm gone that's what I searched when he said I must decrease animals increase it wasn't handing over to nobody it is the Ministry of the seventh angel of loud this year giving well to the ministry of the mighty angel of revelation 10 because Christ has always brought deliverance by himself the job of Major Redemption it never gives any man that was when they good when they go to a Jericho it was beyond Joshua he has to make contact with the angel of the Covenant who appeared in angelic for are you for us are you against us it took the angel to give him the formula to know how to break down the walls of Jericho not no man Joshua means Jehovah Savior does the Lord Jesus Christ William Brown never expose you to no man he has passed you to Jesus Christ he said what God sent me to do is to establish a relationship between man and God when the relationship become established he said I must decrease and II must increase because the bride and the groom must begin to have contact in order for the bride to bring for the seat of this hour lemme lemme tell you something lemme tell you somethin our Western understanding confuses or sometimes you know in the scripture in the scripture in the Jewish land when the wedding is performed before reception they go for consummation aha radio Bible the moments the groom and the bride is blessed that nesting is for the bride's father to prepare a room we have the consummation of that time will be made it is the outcome of consummation that will determine whether they'll be wedding Sapa or not read your Bible correctly in the West what we'll do is wedding and reception then consummation that's what we do but in the whole Jewish that is not what they do wedding consummation reception let me announce to you that is what Christ has adopted that is why it must relate with you as the bride now in order to bring forward while we wait for the wedding so far and you see the outcome is coming he said you a sinless virtuous [Music] [Applause] well carotids bright so you deserve a reception and is gonna come for three and a half years we are waiting for that time to come so while we are waiting letter waiting continue let the marriage continue amen let the bride and the groom be bonding because the go-between as finishes what you say as villages walk a finishes walk without leaving one stone unturned he turn every stone that was why a priest a message invisible Union he said this is my tons given message the purpose for which group brought me has been accomplished I've received by intermediary and I'm fine with that you love him god bless you Church [Applause] so this folks this folks they went to carry their sensor with their incense and they started the Bible said they started offering actually and while they were offering the smoke of the offering was rising up to heaven do you City God with us and there must have been telling Moses can you see your life even God is swallowing our offering but thank God for Moses who knows way standing he doesn't get bothered or shaken by all those things he waited till there abracadabra and Acrobat was over when they finish pastor Moses got off he said who is on the Lord's side it will interest you to know that some of those guys who were healing who has him preach on brother data move on brother Cora when they saw the countenance of the pastor Moses they said anytime pastors faces like this something will happen they must have taught by the Korah Dathan and abiram excuse me for now I'm changing comes is the season of defection in Nigeria so all these brethren began to defect in the incision of defection and their defection and they were defective and they were defective the Moses Asch well if this man died the death of natural human beings the Lord has no called me then God Moses began to prescribe for God the kind of death [Applause] don't joke with the Moses of this hour [Applause] you know Paul said I am the wise masterbuilder do you remember I said ax is a let every man watch what is building on hitch the bride will not be judged but there's an elements of our future judgment listen to these your work will be judged is that summer Putin stone summer Putin is summer Putin's troubles some are putting wood some are putting brass summer Putin silver and some are putting gold it's a fire we try so that is the element of our future judgment and we must be careful but I thank God beyond the curtain of time their sense who in the Achuar final bodies in their body in which you know all things in the body in which you cannot be diseased they said they chorus with one voice when the Prophet said I want to see Jesus they said is a bit high we are waiting for you to present us to him is that will Peter do the same they said certainly will paw through the same suddenly it Danny told those Saints is that if the people of Peter make it mine will make if the people of Paul make it mine we'll make it because I preach war Paul preached I preach what Peter preached talk about being built on apostles and prophets foundation that is in there I preached what the bridge and the sense of Ghana they said on this we are rusty [Applause] we are still resonance because our theophany ball record with us [Applause] you love him hallelujah then after they finish the offerings is an image will be that the land will open and God will swallow them one after the other and all that they have then it will be a lesson that if you are not of the stock of Iran don't ever pick a sensor and the incense and the Bible said as Moses was finishing the statement God wished had no time the land opened and swallowed them whole now watch God watch God Moses said this the offering of these people against their soul is that God or sends us because they offered it onto the Lord is that so they've become a load take them as vessels in the house of God but the question is where were those who offered each be very very careful even if you are running in permissive wheel and you are feeling good and you are feeling blessed be very very it will never end well and it is not a cause so we must submit ourselves to his will and to his work don't question each Donn's as you meet tickets the way such it's not going well with you you loved him tonight Oh hallelujah now watch why she will be scared about the will of the Lord you don't have a reason to be scared because most of the times what was trouble with if the men walk up to the pastor and said this and this I want to do sir could you just pray along with the pass always say let's pray buddy let's see what it will of God would be that you become uncomfortable you know why it's because many a times we already made up our mind be careful that is dangerous because God looked at the heart of some folks and he told his prophet is that the elders of Israel are coming with to me with idols they've already made up their mind what they wanted to do they say well to fulfill all righteousness let us go and find out God does not deal with your lips it deals with your heart so what is on your lips must match with what is in your heart if there is no match God caused you an epoch reach and we give you the answer that you want he gave Balaam the answer he wanted what I want to I want to make it very easy for you tonight you don't have to be scared you don't have to feature about the will of God just look at the scripture we read is that ask and it shall be given knock and it will be open to you is that what they say this is sick and you will find is that what is that then it shot to you how a better fat is than ever your head'll appearance is that o amongst you will your children ask for a fish will give my snake it's not possible if they have so bread you won't give them stone is that there if you being evil know how to give good gifts I'm much more me that's a challenge tonight can we trust God enough to know that is will our lives will be better look at you look at you brother Bram said we do not choose by what we see we choose by what we believe now yeah because what you see is just the quantity that your eyes can declare if you are not using hi glasses like I'm doing if you stand here on the plane surface you can see more than a kilometer or two very clearly after I kilometer you might be able to tell that this is a human being but I doubt if you can identify who they're following that is the best your eyes can declare by you see God is here in the beginning is the end so o is a better person to make your choice and the Bible said in whatever you do consider at the end of the matter if you are to take decisions by the end of the matter then you need the ones who knows the end from the beginning to influence your choice [Applause] you love em tonight are making it easy for you to surrender now I want you to know that nobody should frigate embargoes choice for them because three God made three physical choices about your life that you had no contribution hing it made a choice of you for you and about you we are going to read it we are going to look at it you have no contribution in those choices and if you're mandarins correctly you love them so well but let me begin from the spiritual choices how many are happy to be Christians tonight how many are happy I want to see your hands how many are happy everybody is happy to be Christian god bless you James so you are happy with God's choice because you never chose to be a Christian I rather be a no time Christian than anything I know that's very good you are releasing a choice but you never made that choice it is beyond you to make that choice Jesus Christ you never chose me I chose and you are here liking the choice can you begin to trust Amy at least God has a plasma canal he made a choice that you like all of you can die for Christ and it was in your choice if you love him tonight is because if I love you and II places' is love in your heart our prophet said when you begin to feel a need for God in your life it is the seed God put in there that is hungry man testing to come to a life it wasn't your idea it was is an e-zine is appointed time Oh glory to God [Applause] let's look at some choices image for you of you and about you in the message chosen of a bride paragraph two one five just one series it preached on that he said remember now we are going to step up our language so that the young do not take the young ones don't take a wrong impression but the hadass will understand what I'm saying are we together all right it said remember what I said the other day at a breakfast in the polling of breeding male and female there's a million of gems go for you pick and are millions of eggs go for but there is only one of them live and yet there everyone just alike one out of a million every one of them the same egg and the same kind of Jam one of them leaves and the rest of them dies what I'm saying is that in the hour of your conception many lives came from - too many lives coming from mom but out of these millions of lives it is only one that will match with the other life you have revelation it is just only one and even science under microscope told us that your position on the queue is not a disadvantage they said sometimes they have washed the very last life rot on top of the other lives to come and be the one when it's riding when is riding on top of the other lives what intelligence make the other lives to submit without competition without fighting there must be a supernatural intelligence that is what brother Brown search your best is more mysterious than the virgin birth of Jesus Christ [Applause] many the lives father's will submit and say you go and you go go go go go and touch the other life and it becomes a conception and that conception happened to become you for you to be the conceived 999,999 lives we are wasted for it to be you the prophetess not even mama or Papa or anybody can decide who amongst those lives will from the conception I want to hug the church tonight who took that decision who made that choice can we give God a pass man when image that choice it became you now permit my route question how many wants to die now see their faces city offenses prefer mr. heo meaning no no no but if God let's ask him since he's the one who responded prefer my come let us ask him maybe you can remember where we were when the millions of years of light space did God ever HASC you that would you like to be the one conceived that day no it never hurts you it never hurts you do you like being alive sure you do like being the one sure so can we give God a plasma so God meant a choice of in among manic or their lives you are like it if you had if you had a blast now but you will forget you and a charge everybody will start running helter-skelter you know what because you are trying to protect their life you have no idea how it came about it's a reflection of the fact that you are scepter that choice let's go on let's go on no one can tell which is the one that's will rap on the head or what about each God us to decide that just like you said whether it's going to be a boy or a girl who decides - blonde or brunette black brown chocolate light complexion whatever who decides that your greed is good again I manage sisters would like to be mid man city face off sister cookie sir God you know in my house any time I will go marry I will walk around the house when I'm walking like that my wife knows I'm up to something I said the best thing that could have happened to be a preacher and that is to be a man and she will pause Antigonus the most wonderful beautiful thing is to be a woman and I was that what is in it being a woman man we're in charge he said she says until you become one you won't know I said god forbid I can everyone then I sat down one knee and I wonder both of us conversing the position of our agenda and yet we never told God brought me back to you coming in let us ask him is our case study did you remember whatever asking you whether you would like to be made a man or a woman no shall we turn you to woman it looked at me what an embarrassing quest god bless you sir so you accepted choice number 2 of God is that right that there are those of us who would say I like vacation on the mountains and there are those who say no no no no I like it by the river by the poolside I just like to watch water for the next 10 hours feel the cool breeze this that sandy harder ask these people did God ever consult you to put those things in there how come it so perfect that it knows what you would like and the message things that are to be the profits that the kindness of our Heavenly Father knows what your tests will be like and it puts everything in place before you have a appear if God met all these choices for you of you and about you and you loved it so much I want to ask you sirs and mass what or that choice of your life can you not undo I know something is running the mind of some of you say but it promised to give me the desire of my heart am i touching your spirit you are very right it's a promise but the Prophet said that Christian desire is just only one what does the word says on any vain this is why God to time by the inspiration of debtor animated Eva's nineteen we are in a whispered choose life it took time to set out in his word every aspect of human life and give you confidence and guidelines to appear choices if you want to marry there's a provision in the word of God on how to get married when you get married there's a remedy in the Word of God on how to live with your wives and with your husband's God students have interfere with your personal life but in knows if he lets you have it you won't do right every other areas of your life if you are lying the right of way is willing to guide you I'm winding down now by saying this the choices you make when you do it by sight your physical high what you are seeing will not be as much as what you are not saying or let me put it another way what you don't see is more than what you see I'll give you some choice examples in the scripture Abram and Lord we're together for a while Abram the uncle lot the nephew for everything lot achieved you hood it to Hebron you remember that but because they Brom was a Christian he doesn't tight fist on anything when it loses if the portion of the land can no longer contain boat he give love the right of first choice it should have been Abraham saying Lord goodies way but Abram manifested every character every virtue and that is what stirred him out today as what as an allegory a prophecy of your whole life but not only see the opportunity to make choice then the batchest the Bible said in Luke that he well what are plain brother Bram said all that was on his mind is better economic opportunity to make much more and sometimes some of us take such decisions Bala Brom said without even consideration for our souls he taught us that when you are considering where to even locate is that consider fast your soul is that it is important you hang around where the fire of God is fallen a lot of you became emergency pastors today because you don't consider that he said doesn't matter that place is good when we get there if there's no church we'll start one as God led you to do that I hope I'm not standing offensive I'm just preaching the Word of God thank you for loving me sir I appreciated love the professor was looking at an opportunity this my one thousand cow but it's an degrees on that land for the next one year they will become double and in the next year triple quadruple syncopal are not cairo pools then before you know it i will walk around and overland then i become the main man for friends because it was all a choice besides II couldn't sees wife becoming the pillar of salt here watch the choices you are making watch the influences of your life he couldn't see himself going with plenty and escaping with nothing it couldn't see his daughter's been destroyed his their ways does has destroyed reach the Bible lot had sons in-laws who we have married to his daughters the two daughters that escaped with him we are not here marriage they were pure veterans living in the house but is God those who were ready marriage so those daughters perish so sometimes when he was a Lot's wife looked back the tendencies to look at it from the angle of maybe our trinkets our jewelry and so forth but the instant of mother also was there my daughters are perishing that prize and yet when God was ready to bring that deliverance that you must not mind the cry think about it go without it didn't see the destruction of his own daughters in Sodom and Gomorrah he didn't see himself starting so well and ending it in shame by becoming father by his own daughters when you choose by sight what you see is not as much as what you don't see you loved him tonight there's even a very even a very tough one in the Bible go to the Sakaya prepare your house this is the time to go that was the choice of God for you hmm it's over and now nobody wants to hear that kind of a thing but our tell you those who had it and we're happy Paul was telling the church I am ready to be offered Peter said the same thing brother Brahm said I never want to ask for one more hour or one more day when it determines my time is off as a guy has got for another 15 years he got it friends for reach the Bible it were better for him to have God [Applause] what God chooses right I could go on and on about several examples but let me come home to a brother Brahim the Prophet said I'm sure many of us have read it he said I choose to be poor and it doesn't make meaning to many of us because you can say was really poor at the end of his life but friends this is the way to scale it if you look at all that the gifts give opportunity for brother Brahm to have and what he had in comparison it was very poor or a robot stole my husband and so forth developed out of his ministry you saw what they had and you saw what he had and it give us a reason he said I don't want my meetings to be so complex that I will need so much money to sustain make my people because I want to be able to be available to a congregation of six or twenty as much as I'm available to those of several hundreds of thousands it was only William Branham who did that in his day there were many places or a robot couldn't go and brother Brant all the people said don't begrudge him because for the office of our robot to open every day if then it said it needs about six thousand dollars there now if it comes to your meetings how much are you gonna give him to sustain - this is why it locked them off it must be to the eye and the dignitaries but the profits and mine is not like that brother Brahma and his office on a daily basis then with an unread order about dollars and you see when it took this decision it created and impact in heaven the choices you make god watch it was mementos I will show you why it was mementos it was God Himself who said it it was mementos in heaven and day by day the Prophet was faithful to that choice it doesn't matter what stories people are talking about brother Brahim day by day it was faithful because every Barakat that he was faithful and I'm gonna read it to you then one day God blesses us already then one day he just finished preaching as a full gospel business meeting and what he preached look odd today I believe but I don't think the Prophet we just want to do that accept his letter inspired but anyhow it was so hard and how they managed with him but there was a young fellow who came around him and held him ladies there brother Brown what you've just preached will look like the 23rd chapter of the book of Revelation you know Revelation has only 22 so is that this sermon will be the addition or a tandem to the Bible some said as such things are never survived it but in the case of this young man it was messy to him the moment he says that the Spirit of the Lord struck in and started speaking in another language this was an English man speaking French and God you knew that was going to happen position three French now we've got five six seven French bread hallelujah God knew what was going to happen who has arranged for that he knew that we upon daddy he measures some three French fellows were in their mission to two men and one woman and each of them by their occupation and preoccupation they are authorities in French translation the three of them deeds those translations and when they brought the three notes together they agree under 8% even with commas signs and everything Oh with thank God for beautiful choices before I read that you know Moses had an opportunity to choose also he was raised up like an Egyptian but thank God for a godly mother who behaved more like a nurse who looks to Moses more like a nurse and it was a God's divine arrangement because the curriculum of the teaching that will make Moses fulfill his commission wasn't available in Egypt so the teacher had to be imported and she was badged with foreign currency because she was an expert rate [Applause] when we got to glory I would like to have some my my joke about how she spent her morning so as Moses was growing up in the carriage of a prince everyone's in the way when they saw him alive to a level to stop picking understanding he started telling him you don't belong here son Anna you got no right to tell me that you go say young man come you don't belong here and as you begin to repeat it because faith comments by don't stop telling the children if you take a hold one of these this [Applause] brotherbrother you got two three or four things to do live in life water before them pray for them talk to them create the right environment move out all the trash out of your house and be positive it says somewhere down the line go we find a way I believe that very well because we got the scripture in this end time thou and thy house shall be saved it doesn't matter how they look like now if you keep your eye on that that is symptoms past okay you told us that they were to have salutes I love that is that the absolutes of Caleb and Joshua was the promise God gave but the absolutes of the ten elders where the things they were looking at keep your eye on the promise and it will be well with your children Keep Calm fascinates the most obey don't be negative remember sitive that if it work for you is gonna work for them there was no temple no Tabernacle in the palace of Egypt and yet the Bible told us in Hebrew level by faith Moses who taught affects faith cometh by hearing who gave him to hear the mother the fifth gospel the kinsman redeemer to those children and one day he said okay let's assume I don't belong here where do I belong then the woman looked to be sure nobody else was watching in the palace is they come let me show you you see hope on the shot as she hope on the window is a look there you tell me I'm a slave sure you sure you sure you and it begins to get a hold it began to get out on to Moses one day refused to be called Pharaoh's daughter son choosing rather to suffer the reproach of Christ and accepted his as a greater riches than all the treasures of Egypt friends that choice paid off eight hundred years later he was standing with Christ on the Mount of Transfiguration when the gospel returned to the Jews we'll be back again oh man what a choice [Applause] then when it was interpreted listen to what Evan said about brother brems choice you like to hear that so because they are chosen the narrow paths the other way and thou as Walt in your own chosen walk in their choice find out the will of the Lord on any matter and whole heartedly stain it thou has picked the correct m precise decision and it is my way so this was God's choice for brother Brahim because of this momentous decision why was it momentous when the Prophet accepted that choice Evan was touches Oh a huge portion of heaven will have with thee what a glorious decision that was made see Evan excited about that decision and as the way is going to be excited about your lives being hero for Jesus Christ be the choice of Christ make God happy young people if you want models are give you the real models they will never die their memoria will never leave us oh my I remember I made a young girl who was taken captive by the Syrians all that galas a could torch in my heart you know why she was taken captive against her own decision it wasn't a pleasant experience you go to campuses by your desire you go to school because we wanted to become a graduate but this lady find herself in Syria not out of a volition but guess what she took God of Israel with our wherever you go take the name of Jesus with you that was the choice she made and I tell you people we are watching until one day when she gave a testimony just a testimony his excuse me says she couldn't even talk to the general himself but she talked to some maybe some people who matter you see this problem of general is a minor problem and everybody began to give here's you know why there's a life behind that testing if she's just another Syrian girl nobody will take a serious said if general will go to Israel my homeland and Guam if the prophet of God this leprosy that they have to treated in John Hopkins they've taken to Saint Victoria and all kind of saints Germany France and all over the world it's a minor problem you don't mean it I mean it you don't mean it I mean it can you give this testimony before the general himself it's even before the president then when they were sure the entire house of the general we're running up and down getting in touch with the presidency imagine if the all of us along started working doing diplomatic shuttles with Syrian country just because of the testimony of one small insignificant girl think about that and you are looking for a model that's a model wherever the gospel is being preached she will never be forgotten I mainly remember Michael Jackson today no way you know a lot of their pop whatever the ones you keep on your phones and so forth was there Memorial today your value will be too cheap if does that the people you are keeping as models I want you to know that the kingdom of God is raising royal children and royal children are not permitted to live any how to dress any how to talk any huh as long as you have a linkage to Detroit the palace must watch how you live we have a contemporary case there are two boys in England today they call him Ariana which one William I relieves the way once you know I got no link to that role even though it's a prince but the palace will never allow William to live anyhow you know why because is next in line to secession are you catching it that is the Royals of eggs in order to present to preserve the sanctity of earthly Kingdom that will soon give way do you think the palace we allow William to have married a girl re marriage there was just crew tonight that gal in marriage because II could be the next king of England so if Atlee monarchy is as concerned as I am about everly monarchy a kingdom that can never be shaken so don't take it as too much pressure from the past oh no sir he's just trying to resume to be an hero it brings a princess [Applause] because we shall rule and we shall reign ever right now we are ruling we are running because we have dominion of a scene of a Satan over this world Oh glory to God what a glorious decision that was made dissonant service that which will give and may come to pass tremendous victory in love divine the prophets epic losses was translated from French it might as well be tremendous victory in divine law god bless you how many will from now one allow Jesus to have his way in our lives you got only one
