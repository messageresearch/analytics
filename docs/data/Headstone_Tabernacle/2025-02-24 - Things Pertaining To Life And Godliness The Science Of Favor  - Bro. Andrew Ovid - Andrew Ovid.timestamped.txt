[2:27] opportunity to hear the word of God to
[2:30] be able to fellowship and we ask that
[2:32] you speak lip to air to your people that
[2:35] you speak lip to a to us that
[2:38] you bless us in a mighty way that we
[2:41] find favor in your eyes in your name we
[2:44] pray amen and
[2:46] amen amen you may have your
[2:53] seats amen so today we have the first
[2:57] session for 2025
[3:00] the first session of things pertaining
[3:02] to life and to Godliness and today we
[3:05] have a special topic um if it is that
[3:09] you have your Bibles close by it will be
[3:12] really
[3:13] fantastic um so that we'll be able to go
[3:16] through some scripture and I have a
[3:19] topic for you today which is the science
[3:22] of
[3:23] favor right it's a science of favor
[3:27] right and throughout Bible we see the
[3:30] use of the word grace and we see the use
[3:34] of the word favor and we all are
[3:37] benefactors of God's grace
[3:40] amen
[3:41] so um I just want to read a couple
[3:45] scriptures right that speaks to favor
[3:47] and then we're going to dive into the
[3:49] topic because we want that you're able
[3:52] to see how this is going to be able to
[3:54] work for you and how biblically in the
[3:58] past that it has been
[4:00] um beneficial for God's people um
[4:06] amen all right
[4:08] so I'm going to read
[4:16] from I'm going to read from Exodus
[4:19] 3 chapter 20
[4:35] all right so Exodus 3 T chapter
[4:40] 20 and this is when God was speaking to
[4:44] Moses in the buron
[4:47] bush and he said and I will stretch out
[4:50] my hand and smite Egypt with all my
[4:54] wonders which I will do in the midst
[4:57] thereof and after that
[5:01] he will let you go and I will give this
[5:05] people favor in the sight of the
[5:08] Egyptians and it shall come to pass that
[5:11] when ye go ye shall not go empty but
[5:15] every woman shall borrow of her neighbor
[5:18] and of her that sourth in her house
[5:21] jewels of silver and jewels of gold and
[5:24] rment and ye shall put them upon your
[5:27] sons and upon your daughters and he
[5:30] shall spoil the
[5:33] Egyptians amen I also want to read from
[5:36] Exodus
[5:39] 12 verse
[5:43] 35 Exodus
[5:52] 12:35 and the children of Israel did
[5:55] according to the word of Moses and they
[5:57] borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of
[6:00] silver and jewels of gold and rment and
[6:03] the lord gave the people favor in the
[6:05] sight of the Egyptians so they lent unto
[6:09] them such things as they required and
[6:12] they spoiled the the
[6:15] Egyptians
[6:17] amen and um in one of the other sessions
[6:21] I would have read in Deuteronomy 8 and
[6:23] I'm just going to read Deuteronomy 8
[6:25] verse 18 to 20
[6:37] and in Deuteronomy 8: 18 and this whole
[6:41] passage about Deuteronomy 8 is actually
[6:43] a warning from the Lord about don't
[6:46] forget him don't forget who would have
[6:48] brought you out of Egypt so it's it
[6:51] speaks to this passage and it's also a
[6:53] warning for us right so he says but Thou
[6:56] shalt remember the Lord thy God this is
[6:58] Verse 18 for it is he that giveth thee
[7:01] power to get wealth that he may
[7:04] establish his Covenant which he swear
[7:07] unto thy Fathers as it is this
[7:11] day and it shall be if thou do at all
[7:16] forget the Lord thy God and walk after
[7:18] other gods and serve them and worship
[7:21] them I testify against you this day that
[7:25] ye shall surely
[7:26] perish as the Nations which the Lord
[7:29] Lord destroy it before your face so
[7:32] shall he perish because ye would not be
[7:35] obedient unto the voice of the Lord your
[7:37] God may the Lord add a blessing to the
[7:39] reading of his word amen so um just to
[7:44] lay a little
[7:45] background God told Moses that he will
[7:48] give his people favor in the sight of
[7:52] the people and he showed later down
[7:55] where that favor was
[7:57] fulfilled and in Deuteronomy he is
[8:00] saying don't forget me and it's a
[8:02] warning normally I would say talk about
[8:04] warning um like against poverty but in
[8:07] the Bible there's warnings against
[8:08] wealth there's warnings against poverty
[8:10] as well right so this is one not to
[8:13] forget the Lord right because he would
[8:15] have been able to give the people that
[8:18] favor right and throughout the Bible we
[8:21] see this word being used so Noah found
[8:24] Grace in the sight of the Lord right
[8:27] Jacob f um found Grace there was
[8:29] actually a scripture where lot was
[8:32] speaking to the to the angels to say thy
[8:35] servant has found Grace in thy sight and
[8:38] this is why I would have been saved
[8:41] right so there's quite a lot of
[8:43] scriptures that pertain onto favor and
[8:46] to Grace and we want to be able to see
[8:49] how we could apply that to our lives so
[8:51] hence my topic being the science of
[8:54] favor all right and in our workplace and
[8:58] I'll will use the phrase workplace and
[9:00] Marketplace interchangeably but in our
[9:04] workplace there's a saying and um
[9:08] there's a saying that a percentage of
[9:11] your success would be the skill it would
[9:14] be the skill set right that's a
[9:17] percentage and there's a even greater
[9:20] percentage which we call spiritual
[9:24] intelligence and it and bundle in there
[9:26] we will talk about about emotional
[9:28] intelligence
[9:30] we will talk about different factors of
[9:31] your life we will talk about mindset and
[9:34] like your attitude and so on
[9:37] and just to show in a normal reference
[9:41] if everybody were to get five subjects
[9:45] or if we were to qualify with the same
[9:48] passes or the same
[9:49] doctorate you would never see everybody
[9:52] operating on the same
[9:54] level right they would never get jobs
[9:57] pertaining to the same exact level and
[9:59] that is also Testament to the fact that
[10:02] a percentage of it is the skill set a
[10:05] percentage of it in the skill set but a
[10:08] a greater percentage would be emotional
[10:11] intelligence spiritual intelligence and
[10:14] basically the favor that are lines that
[10:16] works for that particular person so
[10:19] sometimes it actually works out in in
[10:22] quite different ways from how it is that
[10:24] we see it so let me just get to my notes
[10:27] Here
[10:30] all
[10:31] right
[10:36] so so we're going to talk about why
[10:39] favor matters and why does it matter to
[10:42] us right and one of the reasons is
[10:45] because favor accelerates
[10:48] success favor is something that would
[10:51] that would accelerate
[10:53] success so in the Bible we see where it
[10:56] is that favor would have been able to
[10:58] help to defy the odds and when I say
[11:02] defy the odds I mean when the situation
[11:05] is least likely it's least likely that
[11:08] we should win then we are able to get
[11:11] the Victory and in the Bible we see all
[11:14] the situations with regards to even um
[11:16] like Gideon and the 300 men with regards
[11:19] to
[11:19] David and so on where it is that there
[11:24] was the least the least likelihood of
[11:28] victory but we've been able to win
[11:31] because of God's favor on our life right
[11:34] there's also instances where we were
[11:36] able to how to say it jump the queue
[11:39] right get ahead of of others vying for
[11:43] the same um like position and I'm going
[11:45] to talk about it in scripture just now
[11:48] there's also some who have been chosen
[11:50] for promotion so they have been given
[11:54] rules that they didn't have the
[11:55] qualification for because they have had
[11:58] favor
[12:00] right and we want to talk about God's
[12:03] plan especially when it is that there's
[12:06] there's trying times and troubling times
[12:09] God plan has involved positioning key
[12:12] persons into key positions of
[12:15] significance of influence and of
[12:17] leadership and from these positions God
[12:21] was able to have his People Protected he
[12:24] was able to disrupt the enemy plans and
[12:27] he was able to influence the ations for
[12:30] his people's
[12:32] benefit
[12:34] amen so we're going to talk about we're
[12:38] going to talk about some stuff because
[12:40] we want you to let your light shine so
[12:44] that you'll be able to influence and
[12:45] then you'll be able to lead persons to
[12:48] Christ by also that great favor and that
[12:51] influence which you would be grateful
[12:54] for all right so we're going to talk
[12:57] about Joseph the story of
[13:00] Joseph and there's one thing that I want
[13:04] to point out of note is in the
[13:07] Bible anytime that somebody has been
[13:10] given
[13:12] favor there has been persons
[13:15] [Music]
[13:17] who have had hate towards that
[13:21] favor and it's also a sign for us right
[13:25] that when we see that or when we see
[13:28] hate
[13:29] that that is also potentially a sign of
[13:33] God's favor right because because the
[13:37] world is built in such a way that nobody
[13:40] is just going to like you being able to
[13:42] get ahead and you being and you being
[13:45] able to to prosper and you being
[13:47] successful it's just it's just a natural
[13:49] law of life but in the business world we
[13:52] say we say that the haters are the ones
[13:54] that actually Elevate you so we actually
[13:57] look forward more more to the haters
[14:00] because they are the ones that will push
[14:02] you into position and in the Bible if it
[14:04] is that we look at it so for example
[14:06] just starting with the with the story of
[14:08] Joseph Joseph was favored by his father
[14:11] and he got this special rainbow coat
[14:14] right and then he got these dreams that
[14:18] were revealed to him the Bible said that
[14:23] his brothers hated him for his words and
[14:26] for his
[14:27] dream so the hate of his brothers was
[14:31] actually what propelled them to be able
[14:34] to push him
[14:36] out amen so sometimes we have to look
[14:40] forward to the hate but sometimes we
[14:43] want to be so nice we want we want all
[14:45] the persons to like us okay so um now we
[14:49] also see where in poyer's house he was
[14:54] able to see the favor of God on Joseph's
[14:56] life because everything that is hand t
[14:59] touch would have
[15:00] prospered amen so there was a there was
[15:04] a there's a part in scripture where it
[15:06] said that potifa left everything to
[15:10] Joseph for him to
[15:12] manage because everything had prospered
[15:15] so much potifa probably didn't even know
[15:18] how to track the prosperity within his
[15:20] own home so Joseph managed and it had a
[15:24] point that it said that that all that he
[15:26] knew is that everything was increasing
[15:28] and everything was working out fine
[15:30] because Joseph was in that particular
[15:32] position all right now I want to jump to
[15:34] one of my favorites here so I'm going to
[15:37] go to Genesis
[15:38] 39:21 just to read this other one
[15:41] because we're dealing with Joseph here
[15:43] so Genesis
[15:45] 39 verse
[15:52] 21 and it
[15:55] says but the Lord was with Joseph and
[15:58] showed him him mercy and gave him favor
[16:01] in the sight of The Keeper of the
[16:04] prison and The Keeper of the prison
[16:07] committed to Joseph to Joseph's hand all
[16:10] the prisoners that were in the prison
[16:13] and whatsoever they did there he was the
[16:16] doer of he was the doer of it and The
[16:19] Keeper of the prison looked not to
[16:22] anything that was under his hand because
[16:24] the Lord was with him and that which he
[16:27] did the Lord made it to prosper
[16:30] ER amen so that's just to show you that
[16:36] one is that God could bless you and give
[16:39] you favor in every possible situation
[16:42] Joseph was where we would call it the
[16:45] bottom of the barrel he was in prison
[16:47] but God gave him favor with the keeper
[16:50] of the prison right who was able to to
[16:54] give him the keys and this is just it
[16:57] God's favor and you know we would rant
[17:00] and say how life is not fair right but
[17:04] favor favor from God is actually not
[17:07] fair because Joseph may not have been
[17:11] the longest person in the prison to get
[17:13] this
[17:14] title he would have been able to be
[17:17] there and got favor from The Keeper of
[17:20] the prison to be positioned there
[17:23] amen so you can prosper in every
[17:27] situation and even in
[17:29] prison and we're going to talk about
[17:31] some other situations here in the Bible
[17:34] but I just want to say that God informs
[17:36] the way that others see
[17:39] you so not just that God States when he
[17:43] finds favor with you but God informs key
[17:46] people to be able to see what it is that
[17:49] others can't
[17:50] see and everybody may not have the
[17:53] ability to see what it is that others
[17:55] can't see but the key people God has has
[17:58] given them the gift to be able to spot
[18:01] and to be able to give favor for your
[18:06] benefit amen so in the case of Joseph we
[18:10] had Joseph moving from the prison to the
[18:14] palace and that actually happened in one
[18:16] day right Joseph had a very Swift
[18:20] promotion to the Head we have in the
[18:22] case in the Bible in the story of Esther
[18:27] where Esther moved from powerless to
[18:29] powerful also in one day right and that
[18:33] story of Esther there's there's actually
[18:35] multiple places where it is that she
[18:37] would have been shown favor because
[18:40] beauty is in the eye
[18:42] of of the of the beholder right so first
[18:46] of all Esther would have found favor for
[18:49] being able for looking the way that she
[18:53] looked in the eyes of the King right so
[18:56] that was the first form of favor but
[18:58] then she was able to walk into walk into
[19:01] the chamber where it is that it wasn't
[19:04] allowed and influence the situation
[19:07] right we had in the case of Nehemiah
[19:11] where it is that one one conversation
[19:13] was able to give him the permission and
[19:15] the provision to be able to build the
[19:18] wall right and the time the position to
[19:22] be able to build the wall right we also
[19:24] have one that we very familiar with in
[19:26] the case of Daniel Daniel Danel who was
[19:29] an outsider right he was an outsider but
[19:33] he found favor with with King Darius and
[19:36] King Darius would have told him that he
[19:39] find he sees an excellent spirit in him
[19:42] in Daniel and he wanted to position him
[19:47] to
[19:49] his his top right hand position a
[19:52] counselor a right-and person and so on
[19:55] and this is exactly where the haters
[19:58] would have Comm into play right so they
[20:00] would have come up with their scheme to
[20:02] be able to strategize to get the Lions
[20:05] then as a punishment because Daniel
[20:08] didn't worship the same gods that they
[20:09] had Daniel was an outsider and they
[20:12] found that it was unfair that Daniel
[20:15] came into the situation and was able to
[20:18] find favor in the sight of the king
[20:21] amen so yes I want to say that favor is
[20:25] not fair but these are things that God
[20:29] has put into place from the dawn of time
[20:32] because he wants to be able to
[20:35] to to let his people have the
[20:38] influence and to be able to carry about
[20:42] his work and fulfill his
[20:45] Covenant amen so we're going to talk
[20:49] about key people a little bit right
[20:52] because sometimes we would try to please
[20:55] everyone and sometimes we may not
[20:58] understand how favor
[21:00] works and and everyone doesn't have like
[21:03] the ability or or the resources to even
[21:06] support favor so who supports favor it's
[21:11] the key people and the reason that we
[21:13] say key people is because key people
[21:15] have
[21:16] keys right key people have
[21:19] keys right and sometimes we might pay
[21:22] attention to the to the opinion of
[21:25] people who don't have
[21:27] keys right and the reason that I'm
[21:29] saying this and I know that this might
[21:32] this might hurt some persons but
[21:38] everybody in the context and the scheme
[21:40] of things don't matter in terms of their
[21:43] views and their likes and their
[21:46] dislikes right so sometimes you might be
[21:48] going around your Merry way and somebody
[21:51] has a a position or a point or like a
[21:54] perspective and they may not be in a
[21:56] position to help you move towards your
[21:59] purpose with God but still we would take
[22:03] their we would take their information to
[22:06] heart and we would try to try to
[22:09] strategize our life based on that
[22:11] information when that may not be the
[22:13] best for us so I like to call it we like
[22:17] to get validated from somebody who who
[22:20] is who is an
[22:22] invalid right and an invalid is somebody
[22:25] who doesn't do anything somebody who
[22:27] cannot do anything so somehow sometimes
[22:30] we'd like to take a lot of advice from
[22:32] the persons who don't know what it is
[22:34] that they're talking about they have not
[22:37] been in the position before they are not
[22:39] empowered they don't have keys to be
[22:41] able to move you from one place to the
[22:43] next but somehow we find their word
[22:46] valuable and I'm just making the point
[22:49] to
[22:51] say if you don't have the keys then why
[22:55] should your like or your dislike matter
[22:58] and most people would focus on proving
[23:01] themselves to somebody and
[23:03] tailoring their perspective to somebody
[23:06] just so that they could get a like when
[23:09] that does not help instead of focusing
[23:12] on proving yourself you should focus on
[23:14] improving
[23:16] yourself
[23:18] amen
[23:21] so when God says that he opens doors no
[23:25] man can
[23:27] shut it's because he has designed favor
[23:31] the science of favor that no man can
[23:34] stop right which means again that the
[23:38] key informed persons who could open the
[23:40] doors for you there's nobody that could
[23:43] that could influence or impact their
[23:46] their decision especially the ones who
[23:49] don't have
[23:52] keys so I'm going to just go into this a
[23:55] little bit right because we going to
[23:58] going to just differentiate who are key
[24:01] people and
[24:03] maybe you might be able to spot them in
[24:06] your life or around or around the
[24:09] workplace or around the marketplace but
[24:11] it just means that if God has given you
[24:14] the favor you have to be able to expect
[24:17] that hate is going to come from
[24:18] somewhere that distraction is going to
[24:20] come from somewhere and we can't pay
[24:22] attention to everybody's opinions and so
[24:25] on so key key people one we have The
[24:29] Gatekeepers right so The Gatekeepers are
[24:31] the persons who actually are responsible
[24:34] for let's just say like the invite or
[24:36] they allow messages to pass through to
[24:40] certain persons so for example we would
[24:42] have
[24:45] um I see it in my particular business if
[24:48] it is that I go into a company you might
[24:50] have the frest person so if I ask can I
[24:53] speak to the manager right or can I do
[24:56] something or um like I'm doing a
[24:59] marketing promotion I'm doing something
[25:00] like that my ability to be able to get
[25:04] past the gatekeeper is also a position
[25:08] of favor right
[25:10] because that person has some say in
[25:14] where do I go next right the person
[25:18] behind the gatekeeper May normally be uh
[25:22] um like decision makers so for example
[25:25] in the Bible the Kings would have had
[25:28] the that ability to say yes to say no to
[25:31] sign a check to be able to give you
[25:34] certain permissions and so on so those
[25:36] are those are decision makers decision
[25:39] makers you might have them in your
[25:40] Marketplace you might have them in the
[25:42] workplace where it is that they actually
[25:44] have an influence on where things go
[25:46] next which brings me to the next one the
[25:49] next key person that we have we have
[25:51] what we call the influencers and I'm
[25:54] using this particular phrase but in the
[25:56] Bible all the kings had prophets they
[26:00] had wise men they had consultants and
[26:02] there's scriptures in the Bible that
[26:05] speak
[26:06] about um going to war if it is that you
[26:11] have to go to war it's done under under
[26:14] advice it's done under consultancy it's
[26:17] done under um it's not a viy VI decision
[26:21] and I'm just going to go to war right
[26:23] it's sound Council that you're looking
[26:25] for right so it does have um like the
[26:27] influence ERS and the council and the
[26:29] wise men who are able to position and
[26:32] say to the king and decision makers all
[26:35] right this is somebody or this is a good
[26:37] person or this is somebody who will be
[26:40] able to to accelerate the move or to be
[26:43] able to do those things right so I just
[26:47] want to touch a couple scriptures and
[26:49] Proverbs that speaks to the position of
[26:52] favor but that would have covered what
[26:56] key people would look like in your
[26:58] particular environment so we have The
[27:01] Gatekeepers we have decision makers we
[27:02] also have
[27:04] influencers right and I'm saying that
[27:06] because we we do have a society where it
[27:08] is that again we try to get validated
[27:10] especially by sometimes most times by
[27:13] friends and family and they may not
[27:16] again they may not have the keys to be
[27:19] able to help you to move from one place
[27:21] to the next and in fact there's
[27:23] something that I say very very
[27:25] frequently if your friends and family
[27:27] could have moved you to where it is that
[27:28] you needed to be maybe you would have
[27:30] been there already just maybe you would
[27:33] have been there already so where you
[27:36] need to be able to move from one place
[27:37] to the next obviously it's going to be
[27:40] outside of your your immediate circle
[27:43] which means that maybe the validation
[27:46] that you're seeking for they may not be
[27:48] able to help you with some of that right
[27:51] so Proverbs
[27:53] 22:1 it says a good name is rather to be
[27:56] chosen than great riches and love in
[27:59] favor rather than silver and gold this
[28:02] is speaking to favor Proverbs 11:22 it
[28:05] says he that diligently
[28:08] seeketh
[28:10] good procureth favor but he that seeketh
[28:14] Mischief it shall come to him Proverbs
[28:18] 8:35 and this is speaking onto wisdom it
[28:22] says for who so findeth me findeth life
[28:24] and shall obtain favor of the Lord
[28:31] amen all right
[28:40] so we're going to talk about a few of
[28:43] the situations and I'm going to go back
[28:45] to the story of Moses where in that
[28:48] story God chose to continually Harden
[28:52] the heart of
[28:53] pharaoh and in this position pharaoh
[28:58] became how to say it a
[29:00] hater right Pharaoh became the hater and
[29:04] we even see this particular
[29:07] war and and sometimes it becomes a
[29:10] competition right so when the rod went
[29:14] down and it turns turned into serpent
[29:17] Pharaoh would have gotten his people to
[29:19] do the same
[29:20] thing and in fact they would have gone
[29:23] Toe to Toe for about three rounds so
[29:26] it's quite quite funny when it is is
[29:29] that they would
[29:31] have brought the the plight of the
[29:36] frogs right they would have brought the
[29:38] plight of the frogs and the Bible says
[29:44] that Pharaoh's people went and did their
[29:47] enchantments and did the same
[29:50] thing and it's so funny sometimes how
[29:55] people compete and they hate to their
[29:57] own death
[29:59] detriment so imagine that you live in
[30:02] Egypt
[30:05] and Moses
[30:08] came and turned the water into blood and
[30:12] you come to do the same thing to your
[30:15] own
[30:17] water so you turn some more water into
[30:20] blood so Moses came and brought um and
[30:25] brought
[30:26] frogs and you came
[30:28] and bring some more
[30:31] frogs so the whole place was was then
[30:34] like Sesame Street after
[30:37] that so sometimes we would do things and
[30:42] this is this is why this is why when God
[30:46] gives favor to
[30:47] somebody and somebody's fulfilling their
[30:50] own purpose even if it is that you do
[30:53] have let's just say skills that could
[30:56] compare you cannot compare
[30:58] because that type of competition is just
[31:01] not of
[31:02] God he wouldn't allow it so because
[31:06] because God gave things to everybody but
[31:09] he didn't give them every single thing
[31:13] so everybody is unique to the position
[31:16] that we need people we need we need
[31:18] other persons right we need other
[31:21] persons right and there's a saying that
[31:24] no one man um like it's like a island
[31:26] well no one person could do everything
[31:29] that they need right but through God's
[31:33] grace we could find favor and we could
[31:36] see exactly how we could fulfill our
[31:40] purpose so in the story of Joseph we saw
[31:45] exactly how the brother's hate would
[31:48] have droven him
[31:50] into um into Egypt and we we saw how
[31:54] God's favor would have been able to keep
[31:57] Joseph and to position him to where it
[31:59] is that um that you want to do also a
[32:01] good point of note is that Joseph would
[32:04] have asked the butler to I'm I'm like
[32:06] remember him right now if the Butler had
[32:10] remembered Joseph at that point in time
[32:13] Joseph would have been on a taxi back to
[32:15] back to
[32:16] home which means that he would not have
[32:19] been able to fulfill his Destiny of
[32:20] moving from prison into
[32:23] Power amen so this is just how God
[32:27] designs his
[32:28] program right we saw in the case of
[32:31] Daniel where where King Darius would
[32:33] have found
[32:35] favor would have found favor in Daniel
[32:38] and say I see an excellent spirit in you
[32:40] and Daniel being an um somebody from
[32:43] like a Outsider he's a he's let just say
[32:46] um let just say like an I'm like an
[32:48] immigrant and so on and but because of
[32:53] the way that he worked Darius could have
[32:55] said I see an excellent Spirit In You
[32:58] and I want to promote you
[33:01] to this particular position
[33:04] where Daniel's colleagues would have
[33:07] found that to be unfair and begin to
[33:10] build up the amount of hate that they
[33:14] quickly devised their plan they quickly
[33:17] devised their plan and those those guys
[33:20] know their stuff right because they
[33:23] would have been able to butter up the
[33:24] king and say your majesty you are great
[33:28] you are the best you are whatever that
[33:30] it is to be able to bring that plan
[33:32] about but what did God do God was able
[33:35] to position it that that would have been
[33:37] able to elevate him and and the King was
[33:41] able to say let those same persons who
[33:43] would have accused Daniel put them into
[33:45] the lions then
[33:47] instead
[33:49] amen right so I want to go
[33:54] to I want to go to this particular part
[33:58] which is this is a stepbystep process of
[34:02] how you can begin to unlock some favor
[34:06] in your life right so step
[34:09] one is that you need to show
[34:12] up so there's a particular thing that
[34:16] the generation does nowadays they would
[34:18] stay home on their bed and they would
[34:20] complain and they would say well like
[34:22] government are doing anything and this
[34:24] person are doing anything and whatnot
[34:26] and stuff like that and they
[34:27] continuously Point blame and blame the
[34:30] system but the first thing that they're
[34:32] not doing is that they're not showing up
[34:35] right so you could show up and you could
[34:37] show up in different ways so um there's
[34:40] been so many success stories and books
[34:43] that I've read where persons would have
[34:45] show up and they say hey I I'm looking
[34:48] for work thing d d I'm willing to
[34:50] probably work and start off for free I
[34:53] just want to be able to learn I want to
[34:54] be able to do certain things and so on
[34:56] and stuff but the Step One is that you
[34:58] need to show up right so you can't meet
[35:02] key persons you can't find persons who
[35:04] could see the talent of you and see the
[35:06] favor of you if it is that you're not
[35:08] showing up in any
[35:09] circles right so just for the persons
[35:14] who
[35:15] um they want to be in this particular
[35:18] shell and and and sometimes they might
[35:22] come to church and as soon as as the
[35:24] thing they go straight home or they go
[35:26] to work and as soon as
[35:28] and so on and they get they get invited
[35:30] to a function where it is that they
[35:32] could interact and so on they don't show
[35:33] up anyway because they might find that
[35:37] their particular time or their bedtime
[35:39] or their rest might be special to them
[35:42] well if it is that you don't show up you
[35:44] don't get the chance to meet new people
[35:46] you don't get the chance to socialize
[35:48] you don't get the time chance to see key
[35:51] persons and to and to find out and to
[35:53] have these conversations right step two
[35:57] step step two is to speak up right so
[36:04] um be
[36:06] prepared be prepared to have a
[36:10] perspective or to have a say in the
[36:13] Bible there's references to be ready to
[36:17] respond right be ready to respond um be
[36:21] ready to witness and so on now you need
[36:24] to be in a position to be able to speak
[36:27] up if called upon be prepared to ask ask
[36:31] a question be prepared to say something
[36:33] in terms of your perspective be prepared
[36:35] to say who you are and where you from
[36:38] and what it is that you do because if it
[36:40] is that you don't say anything well
[36:42] nobody's just going to magically spot
[36:45] what gift and talent that you have if it
[36:46] is that you don't say anything okay so
[36:50] step two is be able to to to speak up so
[36:54] show up and speak up step three
[36:58] is stand
[36:59] out right and how do we stand out well
[37:03] particularly um God's people have unique
[37:07] ways in which that they could stand out
[37:09] so one is the way that you dress the way
[37:12] that you you speak the way that you
[37:14] portray yourself um the way that you the
[37:17] type of conversations that you have um
[37:20] the way that you make an entrance all
[37:22] those different things um are different
[37:25] ways that you can choose to be able to
[37:27] stand out right
[37:30] so you could show up so begin to show up
[37:34] begin to speak up and begin to stand out
[37:38] so with your dress with how you walk
[37:40] with how you carry about yourself with
[37:41] how you speak and so on and key people
[37:46] that God could inform will begin to take
[37:48] notice and see what it is that they may
[37:51] be able to see within you that would be
[37:53] able to benefit you in the marketplace
[37:56] and in the workplace
[38:00] amen so we don't have long
[38:03] again
[38:05] right we're just going to wrap
[38:08] up
[38:12] by finishing up here in terms
[38:17] of understanding that God's
[38:20] favor is designed in a way for you to be
[38:24] able to shine for you to be able to
[38:26] influence and for you to able to impact
[38:29] there's plenty times that we choose to
[38:31] have a very very passive way of sitting
[38:35] back and not standing up and speaking
[38:38] out right and God wants this little
[38:43] light that you have for you to be able
[38:45] to let it shine right and our
[38:48] commandment to be able to witness and to
[38:51] compel and to to to compel persons by
[38:56] the highways and the byways is to be
[38:58] able to to come to Christ or to be able
[39:01] to come to God to find god um means that
[39:05] we need to be in that position to be
[39:07] able to speak and to
[39:12] influence so I just want to encourage
[39:15] you to look in the Bible and review some
[39:22] of the things that were said about the
[39:23] science of favor so that we too would be
[39:26] able to apply some of it into our lives
[39:30] and that we will be able to access as
[39:33] much benefit from the Lord there are
[39:36] scriptures that speak
[39:39] towards getting his love in
[39:42] favor and his hand upon your life and to
[39:45] be able to access his grace right so I
[39:49] just want us to stand and give him some
[39:55] praise hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus
[39:58] yes
[40:00] Lord thank you
[40:03] Father glory to
[40:06] God

[40:33] Lord Jesus to ask you for your hand to
[40:36] be upon our life for your hand to be
[40:39] upon our purpose for your hand to be

[40:43] shine our light that we could continue
[40:46] to to guide and to grow and to
[40:51] help and to lead and to be able to
[40:54] benefit your kingdom Lord Jesus we want
[40:56] to be able to establish your kingdom
[40:59] your your ever increasing government

[41:07] able to continue to bless us that we
[41:09] could not just be blessed but that we
[41:11] could be a blessing unto others Lord
[41:13] Jesus that we could be a Lifeline unto
[41:16] others that we could be a lantern unto
[41:19] others that we could be a lighthouse
[41:21] unto others we worship you today we ask
[41:24] for you to guide us in this such
[41:26] perilous times we want you to prepare us
[41:29] with your favor we want you to prepare
[41:32] us for your victory in your name we pray
[41:35] amen and
[41:37] amen just want to finish up by singing a
