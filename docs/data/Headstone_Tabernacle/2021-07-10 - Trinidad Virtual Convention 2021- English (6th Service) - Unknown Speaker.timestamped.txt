[24:32] amen so our personal brother
[24:36] especially upon him is for us to speak
[24:39] on the dispensation
[24:41] of another ephesians and
[24:44] just uh my name is john duncan passing
[24:48] the church here in mississauga
[24:50] canada here in the province of ontario
[24:53] uh message is our church name is grace
[24:56] and truth
[24:57] message tabernacle i've been pastoring
[24:59] this local church for close to 20 years
[25:01] now
[25:02] and so happen to meet your pastor by the
[25:04] grace of god and
[25:06] it's an honor for me to bring greetings
[25:09] from my family my dear wife the church
[25:11] here
[25:11] the elders as we just approached in a
[25:14] short while my greetings for you all
[25:17] uh in the name of the lord jesus christ
[25:19] as we are all pressing on this battle
[25:21] uh to make it a home and so
[25:25] in uh the scriptures that we want to
[25:27] read today
[25:28] ephesians 1 3 5 2.
[25:33] jesus 1 3 to 5 is the blessed be the god
[25:37] and father of our lord jesus christ who
[25:40] has blessed
[25:41] us with all spiritual blessings in
[25:43] heavenly places in christ
[25:45] according as he has chosen us in him
[25:48] before the foundation of the world that
[25:50] we should be holy
[25:51] and without blame before him
[25:55] having predestinated us onto the
[25:57] adoption of children by jesus christ to
[25:59] himself
[26:00] according to the good pleasure of his
[26:03] will i read ephesians
[26:05] also 4 1-7
[26:08] i therefore the prisoner of the lord
[26:12] beseech you that you walk worthy of the
[26:14] vocation whereby you
[26:16] are called with all loneliness meekness
[26:19] with long suffering forbidden one
[26:20] another in love
[26:22] endeavoring to keep the unity of the
[26:24] spirit in the bond of
[26:25] peace there is one body one spirit even
[26:29] as you are calling one hope of your
[26:31] calling
[26:32] one lord one faith one baptism one god
[26:35] and father of all
[26:36] who is above all and through all and in
[26:39] you all
[26:40] but unto every one of you uh
[26:43] every one of us is giving grace
[26:46] according to the measure of the gifts
[26:49] of christ and he gave some
[26:52] apostles and some prophets some
[26:55] evangelists and pastors and teachers
[26:57] for the perfecting of the saints and for
[26:59] the work of the ministry
[27:00] for the edifying of the body of christ
[27:04] till we all come in the unity of the
[27:07] faith
[27:08] and of the knowledge of the son of god
[27:11] unto a perfect man
[27:13] unto the measure of the stature of the
[27:15] fullness
[27:16] of christ and so because we are
[27:20] uh speaking on another ephesians the
[27:24] dispensation that we are coming in
[27:26] though we're living in the nordician
[27:28] church age which is the final age of all
[27:31] ages
[27:32] the age of lukewarmness the age of total
[27:34] blackout
[27:36] god is looking at this church coming
[27:38] back
[27:39] into his first love just like the first
[27:41] church had in ephesus
[27:43] and uh the prophet told us in the
[27:45] message paradox for
[27:47] 61 he said the ephesus
[27:51] now we find the same thing that old
[27:53] testament i think
[27:55] that this book of joshua fits a fitting
[27:58] word for it will be that the book
[28:00] of ephesus of the old testament so the
[28:03] book of ephesians of the old testament
[28:05] will be
[28:06] a good thing to title this book of
[28:09] joshua
[28:09] because it certainly fits and it goes on
[28:12] to say
[28:13] that we find that joshua also represents
[28:16] the aid of grace
[28:17] or some proposition that it could not
[28:19] exist in the same time that the law
[28:21] was in existence in other words
[28:27] joshua is typing grace where moses was
[28:30] typing the law
[28:31] and the two of them could not be in his
[28:32] existence at the same time
[28:34] one has to go for the other one will
[28:37] have to come
[28:37] in in paragraph 66 it says therefore was
[28:41] joshua representing grace
[28:43] was right along with the law but could
[28:44] not be enforced
[28:46] as long as the law was in his proper
[28:48] place
[28:49] and so we want to just take a few uh
[28:53] thoughts as to how joshua
[28:57] the ministry is typing the
[29:00] ephesian church of our time just
[29:03] as the ages have gone on uh they've all
[29:06] brought in
[29:07] their catechisms and their everything
[29:10] and they run their time
[29:12] but we have entered into another age
[29:14] again where the
[29:15] headstone itself is coming down with the
[29:17] shoutings of grace in our time
[29:20] we know the shout is the message of the
[29:22] hour and it was the more joshua's time
[29:24] that we had a word of shout for the
[29:26] first time and so let's go into that for
[29:28] a second as we enter into this ephesians
[29:31] typing joshua in our time here today and
[29:34] so we realized that
[29:36] when moses had to first of all
[29:39] depart this here to go the scriptures
[29:42] already told us that joshua was a
[29:45] faithful
[29:46] minister to the ministry of moses
[29:50] and that is what requires in this end
[29:52] time as we are crossing
[29:54] over faithful ministers ministers like
[29:57] joshua
[29:58] who are standing with the word of god
[30:00] and when moses crossed over
[30:02] it was god that came and spoke to joshua
[30:06] and gave him a ministry and told him it
[30:08] says that
[30:09] moses my seventh is gone but
[30:13] i've chosen you be not be
[30:17] discouraged be encouraged
[30:20] stay with the word if you want to
[30:22] prosper i want to bless you
[30:24] don't turn to the left don't turn to the
[30:26] right stay with the word as i was with
[30:28] moses
[30:29] i will be with you in other words though
[30:31] the dispensation
[30:33] seems to change from law to grace
[30:36] the message which god brought
[30:39] cannot be uh substituted for any other
[30:43] thing
[30:44] joshua had to stay in the same context
[30:46] of the word
[30:47] the ephesian church had to do the same
[30:49] thing and as joshua was about to cross
[30:52] over
[30:53] many of the uh unbelievers the med
[30:56] believers
[30:57] the borderline believers have all died
[31:00] on the moses ministry
[31:01] but joshua is taking a brand new people
[31:04] and people who were
[31:05] many of them were born around the
[31:07] journey they've come
[31:09] in and circumcised around the journey
[31:11] having a sign around them
[31:13] of a representation of coming out of
[31:16] egypt
[31:16] and now they are getting into the
[31:18] promise i also want you to see
[31:20] that under this joshua's ministry for
[31:22] them to continue the journey
[31:24] into the promised land his ministry was
[31:27] to take
[31:27] israel from the wilderness from one
[31:30] moses let them off
[31:31] into the promised land and divide or
[31:34] positionally
[31:35] place the church place the body into
[31:40] the promised land where god is taking
[31:41] them into and
[31:43] as joshua god's seventh
[31:47] was uh thinking of these things
[31:51] he led two spies or anointed two spies
[31:55] to go down there and minister it was
[31:58] under the minister of joshua
[32:00] under the minister of grace when his
[32:02] processing chained from law to grace
[32:05] the first place they went was the house
[32:08] of a gentile woman
[32:10] who has been in the house of bondage a
[32:12] house of jericho
[32:14] a house of bondage and in there like the
[32:17] you know the denominations uh the bible
[32:19] calls them prostitutes and harlots
[32:21] and so she was identified with them and
[32:24] therefore
[32:25] her lifestyle was categoric was
[32:27] categorized
[32:28] as one like that ray have been harlot
[32:31] because she was identified
[32:32] with the prostitutes of their time just
[32:34] like all of us who have been identified
[32:36] with a catholic church or methodists or
[32:38] denominations we came out of
[32:39] prostitution but the holy spirit
[32:42] led these spies to the house of this
[32:45] rehab and then god caught her out
[32:49] she represented the messengers she
[32:52] recognized the message they were
[32:53] bringing
[32:53] she was recognizing the power of god in
[32:56] the ministry
[32:58] to save her and the joshua's commission
[33:01] so when she received it she had the
[33:04] talking upon
[33:05] her life that talking brought it out
[33:08] when
[33:08] death was in every place in talking
[33:11] about ephesus
[33:12] striking to come in it was a place where
[33:16] they have to rightly divide
[33:20] the land but abraham says that when they
[33:22] cross over
[33:23] joshua alotted or divided divided
[33:27] this land to believers so
[33:30] this book of ephesus or joshua coming to
[33:33] the promised land
[33:34] is not for evangelical teaching it's for
[33:37] those who have
[33:37] already come out of egypt who are
[33:40] already being established
[33:42] who come into the promised land that god
[33:44] is going to divide
[33:46] his portion to them blessing of sons
[33:50] in other words adopting of sons bringing
[33:53] god's sons and daughters into the
[33:54] promised land
[33:55] where god is going to rightfully divide
[33:57] the word of god to them
[33:59] is the ephesians called we're crossing
[34:00] over and the promise
[34:02] is in revelation 10 when those seven
[34:05] thunders
[34:07] are going to sound and the mysteries are
[34:10] going to be revealed
[34:11] and the word of god is going to come to
[34:13] god's children when the message
[34:15] begins to come across them that message
[34:18] they receive
[34:19] that message that is there they are
[34:20] going to have upon their heart
[34:22] is what divides us from every
[34:24] organization
[34:25] revelation 10 the word of god came and
[34:28] it was that a mighty angel descended
[34:30] under joshua's ministry we saw the
[34:33] captain of the host
[34:34] also started with a sword the drone
[34:36] sword the sword was caught in the sheath
[34:39] it was drawn which was ready for battle
[34:41] it was out of the sheet
[34:43] it was an open sword which is the type
[34:46] that the word of god
[34:47] is no more a closed book is now an open
[34:50] book
[34:50] and because it's an open book god's
[34:52] student can take that word
[34:54] feed upon it eat upon the word and by
[34:57] eating upon the word we are positionally
[34:59] placed
[35:00] into the body of christ for god's word
[35:03] to
[35:04] have its own purpose in our lives
[35:07] and here we are today the ephesian
[35:09] church
[35:10] a ministry of life ministry that god is
[35:13] giving a fivefold
[35:15] apostles pastors prophets eating that
[35:18] book
[35:18] they are prophesying of the message of
[35:20] the hour
[35:22] and every one of us here know our
[35:24] position
[35:25] our sisters know their position our
[35:27] brothers know their position
[35:28] the deity the congregation the uh the
[35:31] laity the congregate
[35:33] the ministry everybody has a power to
[35:36] play
[35:36] and we have all been positioned in place
[35:39] right now into the body of christ
[35:40] prepare for a rapture to come we know it
[35:43] will be long
[35:44] the dead in christ will rise this
[35:46] ephesian church
[35:47] when he brought rehab out redhat when he
[35:49] came
[35:50] into israel she solidified solidified
[35:54] her status of inheritance in the land by
[35:56] her marriage and we
[35:58] have an inheritance today by our
[36:01] marriage to the lamb
[36:02] of god so when the land's book of life
[36:04] was opened
[36:05] that became our marriage certificate the
[36:08] land book of life was opened
[36:10] the bride was married and is the lamb's
[36:12] wife

[46:55] and the god will bless you
[46:57] amen i would like to thank the lord for
[47:02] giving me this opportunity
[47:08] to be part of this program in year 2021
[47:13] amen and i would like to
[47:17] also appreciate our dear pastor theovic
[47:22] and his associate brother isaac ovid
[47:26] and the entire board of the church
[47:29] and the entire sense the believers
[47:31] everywhere
[47:33] for affording me this privilege to be of
[47:36] service
[47:38] to the people of god or i can say the
[47:41] peoples of god
[47:43] because they came from different tribes
[47:45] and many backgrounds from all over the
[47:48] countries of the earth amen and
[47:52] we trust that somewhere along the line
[47:55] we can be of a blessing
[47:57] and i'm sending my warm regards to all
[48:01] the
[48:02] sins all over the world that we view
[48:05] this
[48:06] there'll be parts of this program i pray
[48:09] that the richest of god's blessings
[48:11] will be your portion in the name of
[48:14] jesus christ
[48:15] i also want to appreciate
[48:18] all the other servants of god that will
[48:21] be speaking in the program
[48:23] or that have spoken before me and will
[48:25] speak after me
[48:27] as the arrangement will be that the law
[48:30] will bless
[48:31] them the lord will prosper their
[48:33] ministries
[48:35] make their feet and their part beautiful
[48:38] watch over them and their families and
[48:40] keep them in the center of the
[48:42] of the will of god i want to
[48:45] commensurate with uh
[48:48] pastor raymond thompson once again on
[48:50] the passage of his dear wife
[48:53] and i pray that the old man
[48:56] will receive encouragement the lord
[48:59] knows all things
[49:01] sometimes you feel for a man like that
[49:05] being
[49:05] older than 70 or a little over
[49:09] this will be the time that he needs
[49:13] the association of his wife most
[49:16] and that was the time or is that time
[49:19] the lord
[49:19] also took the decision to take mama home
[49:23] but in god's
[49:26] in god's program in god's doing there
[49:30] is no mistakes and the capstone
[49:32] revelation that we have as believers
[49:35] is that god can never be wrong we might
[49:38] not
[49:38] understand some of his decisions
[49:42] and some of his decisions might feel
[49:43] very painful
[49:45] but we have a consolation that by and by
[49:47] we will understand it
[49:49] it is where we pastor raymond it is well
[49:52] with the family
[49:54] it is well with the saints in south
[49:56] africa
[49:57] god bless every one of you i just want
[50:00] him to know that we are perfectly
[50:02] identified with him
[50:04] and we share his pains and feel his
[50:06] grief and
[50:07] we identify with him we are part of it
[50:10] and
[50:11] we pray the lord will bless mama with
[50:14] the
[50:14] family i remember that our last trip to
[50:17] south africa for the convention in
[50:19] conquer
[50:20] it was such a it was such
[50:23] motherly making sure everything
[50:27] with us my seven wife they were just
[50:30] fine and dandy and we were hoping that
[50:32] we shall see
[50:33] again sometime but and we know we will
[50:35] still see
[50:36] anyhow amen not in this planet
[50:40] plane again maybe at the resurrection
[50:43] here
[50:43] for a brief meeting and up then glory
[50:47] for the wedding supper
[50:49] and thereafter for the millennium and
[50:51] thereafter for eternity
[50:53] till then we shall keep the faith and we
[50:56] pray that the lord will keep pastor
[50:57] healthy
[50:58] god bless everyone in the name of jesus
[51:01] christ
[51:02] we want to thank god for the inspiration
[51:06] the lord has given a servant
[51:08] again this year
[51:11] to gather us i'll be virtual now
[51:15] for most people who will have converged
[51:19] in the port of spain trinidad at this
[51:21] time
[51:22] but uh for the saints that'll be
[51:24] physically present there we salute you
[51:26] all
[51:27] and for those who are on virtual land we
[51:29] also salute everyone
[51:31] and we thank god for uh
[51:36] the theme for this convention
[51:39] it is called the dispensation of another
[51:43] ephesians amen and
[51:46] i seem to have read a very hot scripture
[51:50] when we are talking about ephesians i
[51:53] was reading
[51:54] the book of joshua but uh by the grace
[51:58] of god
[51:59] uh will transceive by god's grace
[52:03] where this meets with each other and
[52:06] i believe if we follow faithfully the
[52:09] teachings
[52:10] of the prophets concerning the ephesians
[52:13] it has its rooted background
[52:16] in the old testament and when we look
[52:19] for ephesians in the old testament
[52:21] we find the book of ephesians in the old
[52:24] testament
[52:25] in the book of joshua so much so
[52:28] that the prophet search we might as well
[52:32] call the book of ephesians
[52:36] as the book of joshua as the book of
[52:39] ephesians in the new testament
[52:42] and the book of ephesians as the book of
[52:46] joshua in the old testament and
[52:49] while meditating on that it gave me a
[52:52] very good background
[52:56] the lord pointed out some things to me
[52:58] there
[52:59] to be able to be of service and maybe be
[53:03] of blessing
[53:04] in this program and i thought that the
[53:06] lord will bless each and every one of
[53:08] you
[53:08] amen now the prophet said
[53:13] this book of ephesians perfectly
[53:16] parallels
[53:17] the old testament book of joshua
[53:21] amen i'm trusting that god will help me
[53:23] this time around
[53:24] to do a lot of reading so i prayed for
[53:27] the quest i asked the congregation
[53:29] to pray for me amen and he said um
[53:34] it said the ephesus now we find the same
[53:38] thing the old testament
[53:40] i think this book of joshua feats a
[53:43] fitting word for it
[53:45] will be the book of ephesus or the book
[53:48] of ephesians
[53:49] of the old testament the book of
[53:51] ephesians of the old testament
[53:53] would be a good thing to title this book
[53:56] of joshua
[53:57] because it's certainly fitting amen
[54:01] and since we are speaking of
[54:03] dispensation
[54:04] of another efficient i would like to
[54:09] go back a bit to build into the
[54:12] dispensation
[54:14] of efficiency because if you said
[54:16] dispensation of efficiency
[54:18] it is possible that you have
[54:22] a pre-dispensation before that and it is
[54:25] likely you may have
[54:26] a post dispensation after that but
[54:30] if you look at the dispensation of
[54:31] division itself
[54:33] it will look like a period of time
[54:36] which at a beginning and in the
[54:39] beginning there will be a lot of events
[54:41] that build up to a climax and
[54:45] those are some of the things i want to
[54:47] look at
[54:48] and i trust that god will help all the
[54:50] servants of god
[54:52] to come from various angles in order to
[54:54] paint a perfect picture
[54:56] that would reflect the mind of god amen
[54:59] all right from the scriptures that were
[55:01] reached
[55:02] the first thoughts that struck our
[55:04] hearts here
[55:06] was that the glorge caught the attention
[55:09] of joshua
[55:11] by telling him moses my servant
[55:15] is dead amen
[55:18] so according to god moses died
[55:22] amen but nobody could
[55:25] uh point to his grave amen
[55:29] because moses had an angelic paul biera
[55:32] and wherever they kept his body
[55:36] i don't know amen but god was
[55:40] interested in that body keeping and that
[55:43] was why
[55:44] when moses died god did something
[55:47] unusual
[55:49] he sent down angels to pick
[55:52] the body amen ordinarily
[55:56] when men died satan who is the
[56:00] author of death seemingly will have a
[56:03] right
[56:03] to the dead body
[56:07] especially in the dispensation when
[56:10] moses lived
[56:11] because he lived at the time that
[56:14] nothing has paid for the sin of mankind
[56:17] he lived at the time that the blood of
[56:20] jesus christ has not been shared
[56:22] the blood of bulls and gods and lambs
[56:26] were only figurative we're only a symbol
[56:29] and what they do they couldn't remit the
[56:32] sin of man
[56:33] they only covered each and that is why
[56:36] everybody who died
[56:38] before the advent of christ couldn't go
[56:40] into the presence of god
[56:43] they were all kept the bible said
[56:46] the prophet said they were kept in the
[56:48] paradise that then was
[56:50] which looks more like a vip section
[56:55] in the prison house of death but guess
[56:57] what
[56:58] the man who has the possession of the
[57:01] key of the prisoners of death
[57:03] that locked up the body was satan
[57:06] himself
[57:07] are you catching it so from the first
[57:10] man
[57:10] to the last one who died before the
[57:13] shedding of the blood
[57:15] if they are saints their bodies are
[57:18] locked up by the devil
[57:21] they are dead bodies because satan had a
[57:24] right to that body
[57:25] but when moses the servant of the lord
[57:28] died
[57:28] that was a man whom the lord
[57:30] personalized as a servant
[57:32] when he died god sent the power bearers
[57:35] of angels
[57:36] and that was why satan also came around
[57:39] and started fighting with them the bible
[57:41] said it was disputing with them
[57:43] over the body of moses amen and
[57:48] the ark angel michael the bible said he
[57:51] never brought a railing accusation
[57:53] even though satan deserves all
[57:55] accusations we can give him
[57:57] he never use bad words because there is
[57:59] no bad word
[58:00] in the saints there is no vulgar word
[58:04] in the sense if you are still speaking
[58:07] vulgarly
[58:08] acting vulgarly you are very abusive you
[58:11] need conversion
[58:13] it is not actually your mouth that needs
[58:15] your conversion it is your heart
[58:18] because out of the abundance of the
[58:20] heart
[58:21] the mouth speaketh if the art is taken
[58:24] care of
[58:25] the mouth will be taken care of i'm
[58:27] saying that
[58:28] my angel michael the act anger
[58:32] did not speak abusive words amen
[58:35] he only said the lord rebuked it
[58:39] satan was interested in that body
[58:41] because he feel a sense of entitlement
[58:43] to every dead body but because this body
[58:47] is to be preserved
[58:48] and used in the future god took
[58:51] interest and took care of the body by
[58:54] himself
[58:55] so moses my servant is dead
[58:59] but don't forget joshua was always
[59:01] around
[59:02] before the death of moses but
[59:05] joshua couldn't become the picture until
[59:09] after the death
[59:10] of moses so there was a dispensation
[59:14] before joshua's dispensation amen so i
[59:18] would say there was a dispensation or
[59:20] there was a period
[59:21] within this dispensation before the
[59:24] advent of joshua
[59:25] amen there was a period there was a
[59:28] stage
[59:29] there was a time hallelujah before the
[59:32] advent of joshua before that time joshua
[59:36] was laying low
[59:37] waiting for his own time but i tell you
[59:40] everything joshua will need has been
[59:43] prepared
[59:45] the ground has got to be prepared for
[59:47] joshua
[59:48] amen in order for him to take over
[59:51] because the ministry of joshua the job
[59:54] description of joshua
[59:56] as stated by god was for him to take the
[59:59] people
[1:00:00] into that inheritance and divide it
[1:00:04] in other words joshua at the ministry of
[1:00:06] placing
[1:00:08] everybody into their inheritance
[1:00:11] amen and it is that blessing if you
[1:00:14] look at the book of ephesians the
[1:00:17] book of ephesians dealt more with the
[1:00:20] blessing of the church
[1:00:22] into the inheritance ephesians stressed
[1:00:25] your origin it took you away from time
[1:00:29] it took you into eternity ephesians told
[1:00:32] you that
[1:00:33] even your adoption was not an
[1:00:35] afterthought
[1:00:36] it was not a timely conception it said
[1:00:40] your adoption was a predestination
[1:00:43] your adoption was a predestinated
[1:00:45] mystery
[1:00:46] of his will which was revealed to you
[1:00:50] amen in time immensely meaning that
[1:00:53] everything god wanted to do he has
[1:00:56] already done
[1:00:58] it was that and it is that that the book
[1:01:01] of ephesians come to bring you to the
[1:01:03] reality of
[1:01:04] and that is why in ephesians you see the
[1:01:07] blessing of the ministries
[1:01:10] you see the placing of the church the
[1:01:12] ministries have got to be placed for the
[1:01:15] church to be placed
[1:01:21] just follow every bit of my statement
[1:01:24] it is the word of the lord amen the
[1:01:26] ministries have got to be placed
[1:01:29] before what before the church is placed
[1:01:33] you know why because the ministries
[1:01:36] have a responsibility in the blessing
[1:01:39] of the church the ministry have a
[1:01:43] responsibility
[1:01:45] to be able to bring you to the
[1:01:47] recognition of who you
[1:01:48] are you don't talk of a placement
[1:01:52] if you don't even know who you are one
[1:01:55] of the books of the bible
[1:01:57] that connected us to our origin
[1:02:00] that we can boldly affirm our
[1:02:03] personality
[1:02:04] in god was the book of ephesians
[1:02:08] he told us where we came from he taught
[1:02:11] us
[1:02:11] how not to linger between two opinions
[1:02:15] he told us our salvation can be sure to
[1:02:18] the believer
[1:02:19] it knocks out the doubt of identity
[1:02:22] am i a child of god am i not a child of
[1:02:25] god you will find those things in the
[1:02:27] book of ephesians
[1:02:28] because it instilled it in you that you
[1:02:31] are a seed of god
[1:02:33] and if you are a seed of god you must
[1:02:35] unfold
[1:02:36] then it came to a point he told you what
[1:02:38] not your grief
[1:02:40] he showed you your ceiling he said you
[1:02:42] are sealed by the holy ghost
[1:02:45] until the day of your watch your
[1:02:47] redemption
[1:02:48] amen which we know the fullness of your
[1:02:51] redemption
[1:02:52] is your body change and with apostle
[1:02:55] paul told the church the perfection of
[1:02:57] your redemption
[1:02:58] is your body change he said to which the
[1:03:01] redemption of our body
[1:03:03] the book of ephesians showed us all
[1:03:06] those things the book of ephesians
[1:03:08] blessed the family
[1:03:12] amen but before he started those things
[1:03:15] it
[1:03:16] connected you to your origin it made you
[1:03:18] to know who you are
[1:03:20] then it brought the ministry to put you
[1:03:22] in your inheritance
[1:03:24] are we together amen i'm not by that
[1:03:27] calling the fivefold joshua
[1:03:30] i want that known all over the surface
[1:03:32] of the earth
[1:03:34] the five-fold is not joshua you will see
[1:03:37] who the joshua is as we go along
[1:03:39] just enjoy the lord amen
[1:03:43] but it placed the ministries
[1:03:46] and after the ministry's place the
[1:03:48] church is placed
[1:03:49] then it began to place our families
[1:03:55] it was inefficient that we are told that
[1:03:58] if we are ever going to have a
[1:04:00] successful family
[1:04:02] we must have it like christ christ has a
[1:04:05] family
[1:04:06] is god a church he's got a bride
[1:04:10] and if he has a bride he has a family
[1:04:13] even if he does not have children
[1:04:15] man and wife they are a family
[1:04:19] and the book of ephesians took time to
[1:04:21] place the families
[1:04:23] he told the husband the position he must
[1:04:25] be are we together
[1:04:28] are we together he told that husband
[1:04:31] the position you must be amen it said
[1:04:34] you are the head
[1:04:35] in the family he placed the wife in a
[1:04:38] position
[1:04:38] you are the body of the family amen
[1:04:42] and when the edge and the body come
[1:04:44] together
[1:04:45] ephesians show us the mystery of oneness
[1:04:48] amen that when a man and a woman
[1:04:52] is to get marriage what god is
[1:04:55] interested in
[1:04:56] in the man is his age amen
[1:04:59] what god is interested in in the woman
[1:05:02] is our body
[1:05:03] hallelujah and we can begin to lend this
[1:05:06] placement for our lives
[1:05:08] so when both of you come forward to be
[1:05:11] married
[1:05:11] god cuts the edge off of the man and
[1:05:14] threw
[1:05:15] his body away
[1:05:18] his body lost and loses identity
[1:05:21] in marriage then when a woman comes up
[1:05:25] it cuts his head off throws his head off
[1:05:28] and takes a body
[1:05:30] then he puts the head of the man on the
[1:05:32] body of the woman
[1:05:34] i'm talking spiritual and the two had
[1:05:37] become one
[1:05:38] so if you see yourself as a personality
[1:05:41] my sister you are just a body
[1:05:44] if you see yourself as a personality my
[1:05:46] brother you are just a hedge
[1:05:48] amen and he told us because there are
[1:05:51] many faculties in the age
[1:05:53] amen and there are many faculties in the
[1:05:56] body
[1:05:56] and he told us that the body that entire
[1:06:00] personality can only progress
[1:06:02] when there is coordination amen the
[1:06:05] church of god can only progress
[1:06:08] when there is what coordination because
[1:06:11] in the brain you have the head is that
[1:06:13] right so the brain can conceive
[1:06:16] lofty ideas but can the brain carry it
[1:06:19] out by himself
[1:06:23] are we together it you know
[1:06:26] in describing us in describing his
[1:06:29] church
[1:06:30] he said you he said i am divine
[1:06:33] you are the branches i may not remember
[1:06:36] that
[1:06:37] now divine life lost within the vine
[1:06:42] fruit is actually manufactured from the
[1:06:44] vine but can you see the fruit on the
[1:06:47] vine
[1:06:48] you see the fruit on the branches amen
[1:06:52] so the vine has to interact with the
[1:06:55] branch
[1:06:56] in order to bear the fruit meaning that
[1:06:59] everything that tree has in itself
[1:07:02] cannot come to fruition or manifestation
[1:07:06] without expressing it through the
[1:07:08] branches
[1:07:09] christ the head has got lofty programs
[1:07:12] and plans
[1:07:13] but they can never come to fruition
[1:07:16] without
[1:07:17] expressing it through his bride
[1:07:20] which is his body which is you and i
[1:07:24] hallelujah ephesians
[1:07:28] sure does that he showed us that no
[1:07:30] matter how great the plan
[1:07:31] is that the brain the intelligence of a
[1:07:34] man at conceived
[1:07:36] it takes the body to drive it amen
[1:07:40] you need your hands to implement it the
[1:07:42] ants are not in the edge
[1:07:44] it's in there in the body you need your
[1:07:47] leg to move
[1:07:48] it the legs are not in the edge they are
[1:07:51] in the body
[1:07:52] the brain sends messages to the leg and
[1:07:55] that is why the legs can move
[1:07:57] what if the legs say i am not moving
[1:08:00] every vision
[1:08:01] every thought every plan no matter how
[1:08:04] great
[1:08:05] will rotten right on the spot i want you
[1:08:09] to know
[1:08:09] church that god is conscious of that and
[1:08:12] that is why
[1:08:13] he's careful to choose his bride he's
[1:08:16] not
[1:08:17] choosing any our people because his
[1:08:20] program cannot be defeated
[1:08:22] and he must work at that program through
[1:08:25] the bride of his own chosen
[1:08:27] that is why that bride must have his
[1:08:29] nature
[1:08:30] in himself in order for their thoughts
[1:08:33] to agree
[1:08:34] they are thinking to be the same they
[1:08:36] are taught to be the same
[1:08:38] that is why if you want to be the bride
[1:08:40] of christ you've got no ideas or
[1:08:42] thoughts coming
[1:08:43] you must drop it you will lose your
[1:08:46] individualism for the lord jesus christ
[1:08:49] as long as you want to remain yourself
[1:08:52] you cannot be the bride of christ
[1:08:54] this is why in the book of ephesians he
[1:08:57] told the man you are the head
[1:09:00] it's a placement amen he told the woman
[1:09:03] you are the body and he said how do you
[1:09:07] function as a body you function by
[1:09:10] reverence did you catch that
[1:09:14] that's placing you into your inheritance
[1:09:18] so that you can enjoy the things that
[1:09:20] have been freely given
[1:09:21] unto you he said you men how do you
[1:09:24] function
[1:09:27] as a head he said you function by love
[1:09:31] amen that is why he said husbands
[1:09:34] love your wife now the quality of this
[1:09:39] love
[1:09:39] according to ephesians must go beyond
[1:09:42] failure
[1:09:45] did you hear me church the quality of
[1:09:48] this love must gone into a gap
[1:09:50] out it must be love divine
[1:09:53] amen he said even us
[1:09:57] oh church underline that always in your
[1:10:00] mind
[1:10:02] there is no less quality and the only
[1:10:05] person
[1:10:06] that can love as christ is a man
[1:10:09] or a woman who has christ in them
[1:10:13] this is what the prophet said only
[1:10:15] christian can
[1:10:16] love because what it means to be
[1:10:21] christian is christ-like
[1:10:23] christ like is a carrier of the nature
[1:10:25] of christ
[1:10:26] you can't make it without the life of
[1:10:29] christ you need to be born again
[1:10:32] without the holy ghost you are finished
[1:10:36] [Applause]
[1:10:40] are you following me i want to get
[1:10:42] married i want to get married get the
[1:10:44] holy ghost first
[1:10:46] did you hear me because you will only
[1:10:49] marry your reflection
[1:10:51] you will only marry your type like beget
[1:10:54] like deep collects to the deep
[1:10:57] the bride of christ has to be
[1:10:59] predestinated
[1:11:00] or danged to become bright she is not
[1:11:04] he's not just going to pick any other
[1:11:06] people
[1:11:06] because god appreciates a perfect
[1:11:09] harmony
[1:11:10] he needs an harmony to execute
[1:11:13] his plan and i'm telling us even in our
[1:11:16] houses
[1:11:17] amen because the word of the hour has
[1:11:20] come to place
[1:11:24] us
[1:11:26] you don't catch that when you are
[1:11:29] thinking
[1:11:29] these things are still in the future
[1:11:31] that is why you are that is why you feel
[1:11:33] you are
[1:11:34] you can accommodate carelessness and
[1:11:36] excesses
[1:11:37] and bad practice and bad habits
[1:11:42] i will show you this morning that the
[1:11:44] prophet said we are here in the
[1:11:46] ephesians
[1:11:48] it is not a future if it remains a
[1:11:52] future the word of god has worked for
[1:11:54] nothing
[1:11:55] amen i'm building a case just follow me
[1:11:58] gradually
[1:12:05] it said the bride you must have what
[1:12:08] reverence it said you husbands
[1:12:11] you must love your wife let's look at
[1:12:13] the quality of the love
[1:12:15] even as christ loved his church
[1:12:18] and gave himself
[1:12:22] for each amen
[1:12:25] christ was willing to give what his life
[1:12:28] is all for that bride that
[1:12:32] is the quality of the love that he had
[1:12:35] that has gone beyond failure that
[1:12:38] is divine love
[1:12:42] are you catching a church
[1:12:46] a love that does not value his life
[1:12:48] above that of his wife
[1:12:51] a love that was ready to become a ransom
[1:12:54] for his own wife
[1:12:56] and he said for you sister your
[1:12:59] placement is in reverence
[1:13:02] amen and let me tell you
[1:13:05] the word reverence is deeper than the
[1:13:08] word respect
[1:13:10] is a king to worship amen
[1:13:15] this is why if you don't feel that man
[1:13:17] deserves your reference don't marry him
[1:13:21] if you marry him you must reverence him
[1:13:24] your position is to reverence
[1:13:28] your husband and how do you come about
[1:13:32] reverence
[1:13:33] you accept him as your singular hedge
[1:13:38] amen from where you take
[1:13:44] instructions
[1:13:46] whatever it says does not comfort with
[1:13:49] arguments
[1:13:51] even if you are strongly opinionated
[1:13:53] otherwise
[1:13:54] you can only engage in simplicity and
[1:13:58] humility
[1:14:00] are you catching it because the bible
[1:14:03] said you must
[1:14:04] reverence him in all things
[1:14:09] i know many are becoming modern amen
[1:14:13] but i would rather you take your
[1:14:14] modernity from the scripture
[1:14:16] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[1:14:18] and forever
[1:14:20] there will never be a better
[1:14:21] civilization than that
[1:14:23] amen it does not get any better than
[1:14:26] that
[1:14:27] if you want peace in your home if you
[1:14:29] want healing in your womb
[1:14:30] if you want joy if you want heaven and
[1:14:32] earth you've got to
[1:14:34] take divine prescriptions
[1:14:39] because god sent his servants to place
[1:14:42] the church
[1:14:43] if you cannot respect him if you would
[1:14:46] like to argue with him if you would like
[1:14:48] to abuse him don't
[1:14:49] ever get married when you don't have the
[1:14:52] nature of christ in you
[1:14:54] two you are not submissive he doesn't
[1:14:56] deserve you or you don't deserve him
[1:15:04] when the family is placed correctly the
[1:15:06] church of the lord will be in their
[1:15:08] position
[1:15:10] these are the things that you'll find
[1:15:12] amen
[1:15:14] in the book of ephesians and then
[1:15:16] finally after he dealt with us
[1:15:18] he dealt with our family the bible said
[1:15:21] he finally dealt with the church he said
[1:15:23] finally my brethren
[1:15:26] that is now addressing the church he has
[1:15:28] stressed your origin
[1:15:30] he has shown you who you are he has
[1:15:32] given you a witness
[1:15:33] that you are a child of god and he
[1:15:35] instilled it in you
[1:15:37] by a great fate that nothing can shake
[1:15:40] it
[1:15:40] not in present not in future the prophet
[1:15:43] said
[1:15:44] the book of ephesians was the solution
[1:15:46] that we needed
[1:15:47] between calvinism and armenianism
[1:15:51] because the book of ephesians approached
[1:15:54] god
[1:15:55] and his word to the church from a
[1:15:57] balanced point of view
[1:15:59] amen it took the blessings of the
[1:16:01] calvinists
[1:16:03] who will turn the grace of god into
[1:16:05] disgrace
[1:16:06] and the truth the blessings from the
[1:16:07] armenians who think that it is only by
[1:16:10] human effort that you can achieve
[1:16:12] holiness
[1:16:13] amen it took the blessings of the true
[1:16:15] way
[1:16:16] and it blessed us two ways and he placed
[1:16:18] us in the middle of the road
[1:16:21] because the middle of the road is the
[1:16:24] most balanced
[1:16:26] area on the road somebody said
[1:16:29] if you drive in the middle of the road
[1:16:31] you are preparing for a crash
[1:16:34] because it thought that it's a two-way
[1:16:37] opposite traffic lanes no sir it's a
[1:16:40] one-way road
[1:16:42] amen in a one-way lane there's no
[1:16:45] opposite traffic coming
[1:16:46] it is just one direction you don't go to
[1:16:49] heaven and come out of it
[1:16:51] we keep going into each that is the way
[1:16:53] to holiness
[1:16:54] that is the way to the kingdom of god is
[1:16:57] an highway of holiness
[1:16:59] when you stand in the middle of it you
[1:17:01] are balanced
[1:17:02] and i'm so glad the message we receive
[1:17:05] is an efficient message
[1:17:07] i will come to it to round up just
[1:17:09] follow me
[1:17:13] this morning i'm speaking on the
[1:17:16] efficient
[1:17:17] the efficiency of this journey
[1:17:20] amen the theme of the convention
[1:17:24] is the dispensation of the ephesians but
[1:17:26] i'm speaking on the efficiency of this
[1:17:29] journey
[1:17:30] hallelujah
[1:17:34] so he blessed you
[1:17:38] he made you know who you are he
[1:17:40] established you into your inheritance
[1:17:43] then he went after the family amen
[1:17:46] before he went for the family he went
[1:17:48] for the ministries
[1:17:49] amen he located a five-fold into their
[1:17:52] positions
[1:17:53] hallelujah he told us that there are
[1:17:55] teachers
[1:17:56] amen he told us there are apostles he
[1:17:59] told us there are pastors
[1:18:01] he told us there are prophets he told us
[1:18:03] there are evangelists
[1:18:05] amen and there are no less ministries
[1:18:09] they are all five-fold ministry you
[1:18:11] never hear such concept
[1:18:13] in the world
[1:18:18] even though church listen to me even
[1:18:21] though
[1:18:22] it's in the scripture you don't hear
[1:18:24] those concepts
[1:18:26] in the world what you hear
[1:18:29] in the world is more of graded title
[1:18:31] approach
[1:18:33] amen and it's a pity that is creeping
[1:18:36] around the message it's not in the
[1:18:38] message
[1:18:39] amen grade that title approach you hear
[1:18:42] it past us
[1:18:43] and what do you call other ministers
[1:18:48] if it is not a pastor it's in the lesser
[1:18:51] category no
[1:18:53] no truly the local bishop the local
[1:18:56] header is a pastor
[1:18:58] are you following but there are other
[1:19:01] ministries
[1:19:02] also in the church and
[1:19:05] the functioning of all these ministries
[1:19:08] is to achieve
[1:19:09] excellent things and that will deal with
[1:19:12] those who think
[1:19:13] also we don't need the five-fold is
[1:19:16] because
[1:19:17] your understanding of the program of god
[1:19:20] in
[1:19:20] this last dispensation is very shallow
[1:19:25] you need the ministries and watch who
[1:19:28] was writing the book of ephesians
[1:19:31] the man god used to write the book of
[1:19:34] ephesians
[1:19:34] was the messenger for that hour
[1:19:39] are you are you listening something
[1:19:42] ephesians originated from god
[1:19:45] but it never came from god directly to
[1:19:48] you
[1:19:49] it came through the medium of the
[1:19:51] messenger
[1:19:53] the messenger places the church
[1:19:56] into the inheritance by the holy spirit
[1:20:01] before paul left the church was set in
[1:20:04] order setting each other setting the
[1:20:07] church in
[1:20:08] other is putting everybody into their
[1:20:11] positions
[1:20:12] did you hear me church that was why we
[1:20:15] could hear from him
[1:20:17] the mystery of our life in your personal
[1:20:21] dealing with god he establish a
[1:20:23] relationship
[1:20:24] between you and god to make sure to make
[1:20:28] you have the assurance
[1:20:29] that you are a seed of god when they
[1:20:32] finish with that
[1:20:33] he went for the ministries why will he
[1:20:35] go for the ministries
[1:20:36] because after the messenger some people
[1:20:39] must keep that voice
[1:20:41] alive and that was why the quote that
[1:20:44] says that
[1:20:45] when god comes down it goes through the
[1:20:47] messenger
[1:20:48] amen and from that messenger
[1:20:52] those who are faithfully touched
[1:20:56] hallelujah those who are watched
[1:20:59] faithfully touch they carry on with that
[1:21:03] message
[1:21:04] their faithful teaching is that they've
[1:21:07] been brought up in a manner
[1:21:09] not to add or suppress they themselves
[1:21:13] also become an eunuch to this world
[1:21:16] they don't teach experience for truth
[1:21:19] they teach the world as the truth they
[1:21:22] can learn from the experience
[1:21:24] but experience will not become the
[1:21:26] church order
[1:21:28] experience will not become the doctrine
[1:21:30] experience will not become the conduct
[1:21:33] and they will they won't do it oh man
[1:21:36] you hear people teaching experience for
[1:21:38] truth today
[1:21:39] and they do it in flagrance opposition
[1:21:42] to even watch the review what had said
[1:21:46] you are not building a church for god
[1:21:55] because you will come to realize that
[1:21:57] the ephesians
[1:22:00] are not corinthians
[1:22:05] oh my the church needs to catch that
[1:22:08] if you look at the messenger to the
[1:22:10] current messages to the corinthian
[1:22:12] church
[1:22:13] if a man is not careful in the
[1:22:15] corinthian church it should be difficult
[1:22:17] for you to come to perfection
[1:22:21] because if they are not having gift
[1:22:23] problems they are dealing with the
[1:22:24] fornicator
[1:22:26] if they are not dealing with the
[1:22:27] compulator they are dealing with those
[1:22:30] who have segregated who have chosen
[1:22:31] their stars and heroes
[1:22:33] i am for apollos i am for courage
[1:22:36] when there is so much crisis church
[1:22:38] don't churches don't advance
[1:22:41] because you are spending more time
[1:22:43] dealing with crisis
[1:22:44] amen you are spending more time dealing
[1:22:46] with small small things
[1:22:48] love your brother don't fight don't eat
[1:22:50] don't bug bites don't
[1:22:52] gossip don't hate your brother don't
[1:22:54] effort don't be influenced by funny
[1:22:56] dreams and all kind of things
[1:22:57] you are still in the corinthian church
[1:22:59] don't live in sin
[1:23:00] we have to pilot you around and guide
[1:23:02] you so that you are not fletching around
[1:23:04] those
[1:23:05] are corinthian tendencies
[1:23:08] i want you to compare the message to the
[1:23:10] church of corinthians
[1:23:11] with that of the ephesians you will know
[1:23:14] that they are not the same
[1:23:16] you will know that the quality of
[1:23:18] believing is different
[1:23:20] and it is the quality of your believing
[1:23:22] that determines the messages you hear
[1:23:25] did you hear me church the messages that
[1:23:29] comes to you
[1:23:30] depends on the quality of your believing
[1:23:33] if you have environments that they are
[1:23:35] still preaching
[1:23:36] and don't do this don't do that don't do
[1:23:39] this
[1:23:39] it's because there are a lot of doings
[1:23:42] god will not have a servant to open his
[1:23:44] mouth for fun
[1:23:45] if he has yielded himself to the spirit
[1:23:48] is because the lord who is the discerner
[1:23:50] of the thoughts and the intents of the
[1:23:52] art
[1:23:53] is discerning things he's seen that girl
[1:23:56] who is wayward
[1:23:57] but pretend like a dove in the house of
[1:23:59] the lord it's in that brother who is a
[1:24:02] church
[1:24:03] presenting to pray pretending to be
[1:24:05] christian in the church
[1:24:06] you will keep the church on the same
[1:24:08] spot hallelujah
[1:24:10] but you watch the ephesian church
[1:24:18] oh apostle paul to tell the church let
[1:24:20] us live the principles
[1:24:23] let us go on to perfection
[1:24:26] he said if time permits we shall still
[1:24:28] dwell on distance
[1:24:30] is part of our fetch but we cannot
[1:24:32] always dwell on abc's
[1:24:35] we cannot always do arithmetic
[1:24:37] arithmetic
[1:24:38] we've got to go into some further mats
[1:24:43] we've got to go into algebras hallelujah
[1:24:46] and inside the algebras you still find
[1:24:48] repentance you still find salvation
[1:24:51] god has to go to coinage differently
[1:24:54] because the efficient church can only be
[1:24:56] produced by what they are eating
[1:24:59] you've got to eat correctly hallelujah
[1:25:07] let me tell you there's a man there's a
[1:25:09] difference between messages of
[1:25:10] preparation and messages of adoption
[1:25:13] there's a difference between messages
[1:25:15] for children and messages for maturity
[1:25:18] they all came from god but they do
[1:25:20] different things
[1:25:24] apostle paul told the corinthian church
[1:25:26] when i was a child
[1:25:27] i act as a child i behave like a child
[1:25:30] i eat as a child it is milk that is for
[1:25:34] children
[1:25:35] hallelujah it's about you you should
[1:25:38] count
[1:25:39] number of years because the joy of life
[1:25:42] of living can only be sustained if there
[1:25:45] is growth
[1:25:46] hallelujah if there is no growth there
[1:25:49] is a problem
[1:25:50] whether growth as an individual or as a
[1:25:52] family
[1:25:53] or as a church of the living god there
[1:25:55] must be growth
[1:25:57] there must be the things that have
[1:25:58] plagued us in the past that are no
[1:26:00] longer plaguing us
[1:26:01] we might not have gotten to where we are
[1:26:03] going but each day should be a
[1:26:05] celebration
[1:26:06] that we are not who we used to be if
[1:26:09] that is not happening
[1:26:11] you will short change yourself but the
[1:26:14] quality of the messages
[1:26:15] that will be coming to you
[1:26:17] [Music]
[1:26:20] milk sucking churches it's only good for
[1:26:24] bone form it's much more bone formation
[1:26:27] but you see that baby is going to reject
[1:26:29] you and make one of these diseases
[1:26:31] you know what it's going to be
[1:26:33] insufficient um
[1:26:36] and when it becomes insufficient and you
[1:26:38] are not giving the child
[1:26:40] real food the prophet in the message
[1:26:44] running from the presence of the lord he
[1:26:46] said we've got to rob out
[1:26:48] make believe from the church and
[1:26:51] go into the deeper things of god and
[1:26:54] when we say the deep patterns of god not
[1:26:56] intellectual gymnastics
[1:26:59] that we end up with the people not
[1:27:01] getting anything from that service
[1:27:03] not human concussion the people who are
[1:27:06] sent must realize how necessary
[1:27:09] to say only what the messenger of search
[1:27:14] it's a church in progression the
[1:27:17] ministry of the prophet
[1:27:18] was in progression before he came to
[1:27:21] perfection
[1:27:23] the prophet came to a point that he told
[1:27:25] us that his bible
[1:27:27] in his hand became a watch a new book
[1:27:31] it was the same old bible what makes it
[1:27:34] new
[1:27:35] the advent of the angel of the lord that
[1:27:38] made a difference
[1:27:39] to revelation to understanding
[1:27:44] spiritual understanding of the world
[1:27:48] we must come to each because it is that
[1:27:51] perfect understanding
[1:27:52] that will achieve a literal work of
[1:27:55] working on the atoms of your body
[1:27:58] to translate you from children to the
[1:28:00] fate of the apostolic fathers
[1:28:03] exactly so
[1:28:09] all these the book of ephesians taught
[1:28:11] us i'm just bringing the corinthians to
[1:28:13] draw a parallel
[1:28:14] to make you appreciate the necessity
[1:28:18] for the ephesians the book of ephesians
[1:28:21] it was given by the messenger amen
[1:28:24] but the messenger asked to place the
[1:28:26] ministry
[1:28:30] because when the messenger leaves the
[1:28:32] messenger was happy to leave
[1:28:34] the messenger knew he was going to leave
[1:28:37] paul told
[1:28:38] his church he said i am ready to be
[1:28:41] watched
[1:28:42] to be offered amen
[1:28:46] prophet agar boss did a sign he said i'm
[1:28:49] not he said why are you people sorry i'm
[1:28:51] not even afraid
[1:28:52] to go and be in bondage i'm happy to go
[1:28:55] and die for him
[1:28:56] did he not say so he said then spot is
[1:28:59] led for me a crown of glory
[1:29:01] not for me alone but for as many as love
[1:29:04] it is appearing
[1:29:06] if my love is appearing the crown is
[1:29:08] waiting for me
[1:29:09] if you do is waiting for you he was not
[1:29:12] afraid to die
[1:29:14] he knew he was going to leave
[1:29:18] but before he left he set the church in
[1:29:21] order
[1:29:22] he taught communion it touched church
[1:29:25] order
[1:29:26] amen he placed the ministries into their
[1:29:29] position
[1:29:30] after the ministries he dealt with gifts
[1:29:34] oh that's a true church standing friends
[1:29:37] then he came into the family he dealt
[1:29:39] with marriage
[1:29:40] he dealt with family life hallelujah no
[1:29:43] one that the prophet said god gave us a
[1:29:45] remedy
[1:29:46] on how to marry our wives and to live
[1:29:48] with them
[1:29:49] amen if you don't know those remedies go
[1:29:52] back to the messages
[1:29:54] he dealt with it then finally then
[1:29:57] finally my brethren
[1:29:59] is dealing with the church and he began
[1:30:02] to allocate
[1:30:03] weapons for our warfare amen
[1:30:06] you knew you were going to have battles
[1:30:09] he knew
[1:30:10] in your inheritance hallelujah you've
[1:30:12] got to take it by force
[1:30:14] because there are already invaders and
[1:30:16] settlers in the land
[1:30:18] and we've got to chase them out
[1:30:20] hallelujah
[1:30:21] when joshua came into the land of canaan
[1:30:24] the land of the
[1:30:25] inheritance amen if that wasn't heaven
[1:30:29] that wasn't healthy land they met
[1:30:31] settlers there
[1:30:32] they met people they had to deal with
[1:30:34] there amen
[1:30:36] but their uncle they are driving force
[1:30:39] their passion was that great faith
[1:30:41] i have given you the land wherever the
[1:30:45] soul of your fish are touched
[1:30:47] it is your inheritance but guess what
[1:30:50] after joshua divided the lad and placed
[1:30:52] people into their inheritance
[1:30:54] you tribe of this movie you this one
[1:30:57] move here
[1:30:58] you this one moved here it wasn't an
[1:31:00] easy occupation
[1:31:03] you see this was why i went back to the
[1:31:05] book of joshua
[1:31:07] amen so you can so you can see the
[1:31:09] making of the ephesians
[1:31:12] it wasn't an easy watch occupation
[1:31:15] when they got into the inheritance they
[1:31:18] met in vedas
[1:31:20] they met quarters they made you surpass
[1:31:23] in the land
[1:31:24] amen and these usurpers were ready to
[1:31:27] claim this
[1:31:28] as their land they probably even have
[1:31:31] history of ownership
[1:31:33] but does it bother the believer what the
[1:31:36] believer is concerned is what god said
[1:31:39] i have given you the land caleb told
[1:31:42] joshua don't give me support
[1:31:44] just write it off just give the command
[1:31:48] for me to take it
[1:31:49] he said as my strength was then so is my
[1:31:52] strength now
[1:31:53] that is an efficient hallelujah
[1:31:57] that is an efficient that is a man who
[1:32:00] knows the ground is standing
[1:32:01] that is a man who has escaped the
[1:32:03] corruption he has kept it in kadesh i'm
[1:32:06] coming to those things
[1:32:07] he has kept all those troubles he has
[1:32:10] kept the temptations
[1:32:11] he has kept all the oppositions he came
[1:32:14] out on his cottage
[1:32:15] and he got a double portion and the
[1:32:18] personally god preserved him
[1:32:20] every promise to the efficient church
[1:32:22] will preserve them
[1:32:24] you will enjoy every bit of it without
[1:32:27] fail and god will keep you in the shape
[1:32:30] to enjoy it
[1:32:34] when he got into canaan the inheritance
[1:32:37] he said joshua remember
[1:32:42] oh hallelujah it's it's not
[1:32:46] it's not the way i want to bring it but
[1:32:47] i think god is helping us
[1:32:49] joshua remember in those days of our
[1:32:52] temptation in kadesh bania that is on 45
[1:32:55] years ago
[1:32:56] when you and i went to spy the lunch
[1:32:59] and we came with good report because we
[1:33:02] have another spirit
[1:33:04] you must have another spirit contrary to
[1:33:07] the spirit
[1:33:08] of others you must have the holy spirit
[1:33:11] it's in the bible exactly is that my
[1:33:13] covenant of peace will be with caleb and
[1:33:15] joshua
[1:33:16] because they have another spirit their
[1:33:19] spirit was different from the spirit of
[1:33:21] the
[1:33:22] ten elders the ten elders were all
[1:33:24] fighters
[1:33:25] i'm going to locate them for you shortly

[1:33:34] and because you do i will give you extra
[1:33:36] portion

[1:34:01] building bronze
[1:34:02] paul said i am the master builder let
[1:34:05] every man watch
[1:34:06] what is building because every walk will
[1:34:08] be tried by fire
[1:34:11] the believers will not come to judgment
[1:34:13] but there will be a future judgment of
[1:34:15] your work
[1:34:17] that's the wage
[1:34:20] and that is why around the wedding
[1:34:22] supper there's going to be price giving

[1:34:53] my dears coming into it
[1:34:55] i don't want my opinions or my thoughts
[1:34:57] coming amen
[1:34:58] some things will not jeopardize your
[1:35:00] eternity but it will make you lose
[1:35:02] reward

[1:35:08] but it will shortchange you

[1:35:12] never be able to come
[1:35:14] to the fullness of the benefit of your
[1:35:16] sonship

[1:35:32] amen apostle paul
[1:35:36] left a kitten church did you hear me
[1:35:40] he left a fully kitted
[1:35:43] fully equipped church and that was why
[1:35:48] after paul left when some folks were
[1:35:51] coming
[1:35:52] we switched out to preach you gaga's
[1:35:55] things
[1:35:56] these ephesians listen carefully
[1:36:02] when they finish their gymnastics and
[1:36:05] their theories and their
[1:36:08] parabulations permutations and
[1:36:09] combinations
[1:36:11] they said brethren thank you very much
[1:36:13] for the effort
[1:36:16] he said but you know what you did not
[1:36:18] say what paul
[1:36:19] said
[1:36:23] if you have problem with me saying what
[1:36:24] the prophet said you will have it as a
[1:36:26] permanent problem
[1:36:29] because i'm an efficient of this hour
[1:36:32] he said you did not say what paul said
[1:36:36] therefore with all your anointing you
[1:36:38] are false
[1:36:42] they tried every anointing every spirit
[1:36:46] every manifestation every demonstration
[1:36:50] but the message of their hour even in
[1:36:53] the absence of apostle paul
[1:36:55] they remain loyal
[1:36:58] because paul affirmatively told them
[1:37:02] he was so convinced of what god gave him
[1:37:04] that which i received from
[1:37:06] the lord the same i delivered to you
[1:37:09] he was so convinced until he said even
[1:37:11] if it is we
[1:37:14] or an angel we shall come back to say
[1:37:21] we don't mean or it is now different it
[1:37:23] says
[1:37:24] let us be a curse
[1:37:27] brother brahm said there is a hanging
[1:37:29] cause over those who we hurt
[1:37:32] over those who we surprised even if we
[1:37:34] don't pray against them they are already
[1:37:36] on that course
[1:37:38] [Applause]
[1:37:39] [Music]
[1:37:41] if you step by distance and impurity you
[1:37:43] already under blessing
[1:37:44] he said because blessed are those who
[1:37:47] read
[1:37:48] and meditate on the words of this
[1:37:50] prophecy
[1:37:51] to read the lord is a blessing brothers
[1:37:54] read your bible
[1:37:55] sisters read your bible reading alone is
[1:37:58] a blessing
[1:38:02] [Applause]
[1:38:06] how can a man be so sure of his
[1:38:08] revelation
[1:38:09] the prophet said when god gives a
[1:38:11] revelation he cannot change it
[1:38:14] he said he can add to his to further its
[1:38:17] understanding
[1:38:18] but he can never bring something
[1:38:19] opposite
[1:38:21] and i throw it as a challenge today god
[1:38:24] cannot give two
[1:38:25] opposing truths on one subject of
[1:38:30] doctrine of his words
[1:38:33] the true truths are opposing each other
[1:38:35] and we said they are true no sir
[1:38:38] the prophet said one is false one is
[1:38:41] true
[1:38:42] or both of them are false
[1:38:45] but the probability that cannot happen
[1:38:47] is for both of them to be true
[1:38:51] because god is not a double tongue god
[1:38:54] is only one tongue
[1:38:56] amen
[1:39:01] finally my brethren then you know what
[1:39:04] he did
[1:39:06] he kitted the church he prepared the
[1:39:10] church for the battle
[1:39:13] to claim their ground and stay in age
[1:39:17] i have shown you i have placed you but
[1:39:20] you need
[1:39:21] this to retain your victory
[1:39:24] church of the living god this is the
[1:39:26] junction where we are
[1:39:28] amen with that as a background i won't
[1:39:31] take your time so much
[1:39:33] let's go back to the book of joshua
[1:39:36] moses my servant is dead
[1:39:43] so moses are the periods before joshua
[1:39:48] but all along joshua was part of that
[1:39:51] economy
[1:39:53] are you catching it
[1:39:57] before before moses came
[1:40:01] to bring his message which was law
[1:40:04] grace was ruling that church
[1:40:10] because this church started as a people
[1:40:12] from egypt
[1:40:17] while they were in egypt for there to be
[1:40:20] deliverance
[1:40:22] grace sent them a prophet
[1:40:26] when they never even asked for one they
[1:40:29] were only crying for deliverance
[1:40:31] how their deliverance would come they
[1:40:32] never knew
[1:40:34] grace brought the pillar of fire
[1:40:37] grace gave them the pillar of clouds
[1:40:41] are you connecting with us
[1:40:46] grace brought the word for that hour and
[1:40:49] grace
[1:40:50] puts them under the atonement
[1:40:54] it was the atonement that saved them
[1:40:57] from the plagues of egypt
[1:41:03] and it is the atonement that we are
[1:41:05] living under that is keeping us in the
[1:41:07] last days
[1:41:09] while these people do not even know who
[1:41:11] they were
[1:41:13] because egypt was the type of the world
[1:41:16] while they were in the world
[1:41:19] the grace of god that appeared to all
[1:41:22] men already appeared unto them
[1:41:25] that is why why we were yet sinners love
[1:41:28] has been commended to us it was the work
[1:41:30] of grace
[1:41:33] god never waited for you to impress him
[1:41:36] and that was why in the book of
[1:41:38] ephesians apostle paul could show you
[1:41:40] that that could happen because you were
[1:41:43] predestinated
[1:41:44] in his will before the foundation of the
[1:41:46] world
[1:41:48] mercy found you before sin found you
[1:41:51] sin find you by your natural breath but
[1:41:54] messi find you by your
[1:41:56] election election existed
[1:41:59] before your natural birth and the
[1:42:01] conditions of natural breath
[1:42:03] can never change election this was what
[1:42:06] ephesians is making you realize
[1:42:08] to give you the assurance of salvation
[1:42:19] so there was the egyptian period
[1:42:23] and god who was ready to help them
[1:42:26] he came down in that messenger it
[1:42:29] testified to them
[1:42:30] all these things they saw the cloud
[1:42:34] they saw the pillar of fire even though
[1:42:36] they might not see it physically
[1:42:38] they accepted the testimony and decided
[1:42:42] that the right thing for them is to
[1:42:44] leave egypt
[1:42:45] church are we together church are we
[1:42:48] together
[1:42:49] the writing for them is to do what live
[1:42:52] the world
[1:42:53] and the things of the world the prophet
[1:42:55] call it the repentance of the church
[1:42:58] as i'm looking at the program of god for
[1:43:00] this day i have to go back to the old
[1:43:02] testament
[1:43:03] to show you those events so you can
[1:43:05] understand the dispensation of the
[1:43:07] ephesians
[1:43:08] because the prophet said every christian
[1:43:11] journey
[1:43:12] every christian move of god has always
[1:43:14] had its efficiency
[1:43:16] so we are taking the thoughts and the
[1:43:18] understanding of the prophet
[1:43:20] with regarding efficiency
[1:43:26] he said that was your repentance in acts
[1:43:29] chapter 2 38
[1:43:31] the first thing a man does is to what
[1:43:33] repent
[1:43:35] if you have not repented this morning
[1:43:37] i'm calling you to repentance
[1:43:40] be sorry for all your wrongs don't
[1:43:43] rationalize it don't find the reason
[1:43:45] behind wrong living
[1:43:47] if you keep finding the reason behind
[1:43:49] wrong living
[1:43:50] you are going to have the faith of
[1:43:53] soul
[1:43:58] be like a david this morning so you can
[1:44:01] come into your adoption
[1:44:04] david came into his inheritance because
[1:44:07] he valued repentance
[1:44:09] that is the journey of an official
[1:44:15] after they repented god brought them to
[1:44:18] the period of the red sea
[1:44:21] in which the bible described it as their
[1:44:23] baptism how many ever read that in the
[1:44:25] bible
[1:44:26] he said that we are baptized unto moses
[1:44:29] oh gracious almighty god
[1:44:35] so this moses wasn't as ordinary as you
[1:44:37] think
[1:44:38] they were baptized onto the message of
[1:44:40] moses
[1:44:42] the message that called them to
[1:44:43] repentance that's what the bible said
[1:44:46] as many as went through the red sea we
[1:44:48] are baptized unto who
[1:44:50] moses so you see
[1:44:53] where you are seeing moses god was
[1:44:55] seeing himself
[1:44:58] because the commission was be you god
[1:45:00] let aaron be your what
[1:45:02] now how was moses god to the people he
[1:45:04] never came with his own message
[1:45:07] they were not feeding on moses amen
[1:45:10] whatever they repented of was not
[1:45:12] because of moses
[1:45:14] was because of the message moses brought
[1:45:16] and all the messages that moses brought
[1:45:19] was
[1:45:19] called moses read your bible
[1:45:25] that deliverance was called moses oh man
[1:45:29] if we use those words today you will
[1:45:31] think we are religious
[1:45:34] all those of you believing back to the
[1:45:36] bible that is the bible i'm coaching
[1:45:39] and i hope you don't have problems with
[1:45:40] that because today you have problem with
[1:45:43] the mention of the name of the prophet
[1:45:46] you have problem with william brahm and
[1:45:49] you told me you don't have problem with
[1:45:50] moses you are an hypocrite are you a
[1:45:54] confused man
[1:45:57] let me give you another shock it said
[1:46:00] wherever moses is preached
[1:46:04] how many read it in the scriptures the
[1:46:07] bible says moses was preached
[1:46:09] was it moses they were preaching the
[1:46:11] message moses brought
[1:46:13] was called moses
[1:46:17] and the ephesians believe it like that
[1:46:22] there are literally two things
[1:46:25] that will prepare your mind to accept
[1:46:27] the totality of the words
[1:46:32] some of you will talk about back to the
[1:46:34] bible you can't even believe bible
[1:46:36] if bible was actually preached to you
[1:46:39] i'm
[1:46:40] preaching the bible now let's see how
[1:46:41] many struggling with that
[1:46:45] didn't the bible say wherever moses is
[1:46:47] preached
[1:46:51] so will it be strange for the people of
[1:46:53] that age to say moses search
[1:46:58] and with the true convert of that exodus
[1:47:00] i have problems with that
[1:47:03] if you do you are not a vision
[1:47:08] you are just a sophisticated pentecostal
[1:47:11] denomination looking around the message
[1:47:14] [Music]
[1:47:16] come on church we're speaking to the
[1:47:18] world
[1:47:19] amen so we better hear it correctly
[1:47:23] and get it correctly in the light of its
[1:47:26] revelation
[1:47:27] because i'm celebrating the ephesians
[1:47:30] the ephesians who will look at you in
[1:47:32] the face
[1:47:32] you didn't speak it like paul said it
[1:47:35] therefore you are
[1:47:36] false it was a building block
[1:47:40] debut to that maturity they were loyal
[1:47:43] to the world
[1:47:44] let's be loyal to this message anything
[1:47:47] you cannot find a seat for throw it away
[1:47:50] in your conduct in your order in your
[1:47:52] doctrine
[1:47:53] stop sympathizing with creatures god
[1:47:56] called you a night out of preach
[1:47:58] lester sent the message ultimately
[1:48:03] the message has order it has conduct it
[1:48:05] does doctrine the message is not a
[1:48:07] cesspool
[1:48:08] we are anything can harry anything goes
[1:48:11] no sir
[1:48:12] if you travel with it there will be a
[1:48:14] generation that will be loyal to each
[1:48:18] [Music]
[1:48:21] oh glory to god
[1:48:25] they came to the red sea and they were
[1:48:27] baptized
[1:48:28] amen so there are so many ways we can
[1:48:31] look
[1:48:32] at these things but this is the
[1:48:33] direction today
[1:48:35] after their baptism they started their
[1:48:37] wilderness journey
[1:48:39] isn't it their wilderness journey was a
[1:48:43] place of trials that is your
[1:48:46] sanctification
[1:48:49] [Music]
[1:48:52] and the prophet said sanctification
[1:48:54] presents a trying time
[1:48:57] in the message of a present water from
[1:48:59] the living rock he said this is the
[1:49:01] stage
[1:49:02] many people will rebel and go back
[1:49:07] as i'm speaking of that church be
[1:49:10] looking at yourself
[1:49:11] and i'm going to speak of it in terms of
[1:49:13] end time program of god
[1:49:16] looking at dispensation
[1:49:21] that was why from the red sea to kadesh
[1:49:25] bhania
[1:49:26] which was the length of the entire
[1:49:28] wilderness experience
[1:49:29] because after kadesh bernier was the
[1:49:32] inheritance
[1:49:35] they would have come into the fullness
[1:49:37] of the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:49:40] after kadesh banier but let me tell you
[1:49:43] go read your bible every trial
[1:49:46] that exodus church heard they heard it
[1:49:50] between the red sea
[1:49:52] and category
[1:49:57] they had the dayton quran abraham in
[1:50:00] that spell of time
[1:50:02] they had balance in that spell of time
[1:50:05] shall we go into the activities they
[1:50:08] have the ten elders
[1:50:10] who preach the message of we cannot make
[1:50:12] it in that spell of time
[1:50:14] in all the messages of jubilee the
[1:50:16] prophet called this generation of people
[1:50:19] old fighters
[1:50:23] and he said before you and i can enter
[1:50:26] into our inheritance and enjoy it
[1:50:29] all the old fighters must give way
[1:50:32] [Music]
[1:50:35] what was the function of dayton quran
[1:50:37] and aberrant
[1:50:38] they don't want to stay with one-man
[1:50:40] message
[1:50:42] that was the exact x-ray of the
[1:50:44] messenger
[1:50:46] they feel the length of the journey is
[1:50:49] too wide enough
[1:50:50] to stay only with what moses said
[1:50:54] and because they are eloquent men of
[1:50:56] renewed
[1:50:58] big guys they were not the prophet
[1:51:00] messengers they are people you can call
[1:51:02] the fivefold
[1:51:05] because they were levites come on church
[1:51:10] they were ministers they were not
[1:51:13] priests but ministers
[1:51:15] in the levitical order you have the
[1:51:17] priesthood and you have the ministry
[1:51:20] the priesthood are those who are for
[1:51:21] intercession it's just
[1:51:23] like in the new testament the lord
[1:51:25] divided the ministry into five folds
[1:51:28] then you have the ministry in about
[1:51:30] three fold also
[1:51:32] that's not cast in stone but you have
[1:51:34] them as a priest you have them as the
[1:51:36] ministers
[1:51:37] those who reach the scrolls and preach
[1:51:39] they are from and you have them as the
[1:51:40] singers
[1:51:41] those who minister through songs they
[1:51:43] are all
[1:51:46] delivered
[1:51:48] and these guys hallelujah
[1:51:51] they were renowned ministers
[1:51:55] they are powerful preachers if they are
[1:51:59] staged under the ministry of the
[1:52:00] messenger no problem
[1:52:03] but the prophet said the undoing of
[1:52:06] korra
[1:52:06] dayton and habiram was because they
[1:52:09] couldn't stay with one man message
[1:52:13] they had i want to be the continuity of
[1:52:15] the message or they want to be the
[1:52:17] better part of the message
[1:52:19] or they want to be the oh man
[1:52:23] we had many joshuas before joshua
[1:52:25] himself
[1:52:29] are you following me this is a serious
[1:52:31] matter
[1:52:33] because what did they succeed in doing
[1:52:36] they needed the message to get
[1:52:38] legitimacy
[1:52:40] but they are not of the message
[1:52:45] so what we are seeing today is not
[1:52:47] different from what we have seen
[1:52:50] people have repented so to say people
[1:52:53] have been baptized in the name of jesus
[1:52:55] christ
[1:52:56] onto the message of the hour amen
[1:52:59] and the same people they claim the holy
[1:53:01] spirit
[1:53:02] they have preached this message for a
[1:53:04] long time until they start having
[1:53:06] corrupt data
[1:53:07] and aburam ideas and they began to have
[1:53:10] so much
[1:53:11] influence in the art mind soul spirit
[1:53:14] body head of the believers until the
[1:53:18] believers unconsciously drop the message
[1:53:20] for their own teachings and you god look
[1:53:23] at the teachings of most of them
[1:53:25] it's far away from the message
[1:53:28] [Music]
[1:53:29] they never left the message but they
[1:53:31] became liabilities to the message
[1:53:34] did you ever see quran left to the
[1:53:35] message of daddy he remained there but
[1:53:38] it became liability
[1:53:39] until it was consumed
[1:53:41] [Applause]
[1:53:42] there is nothing new under the sun
[1:53:45] whatever is happening has been before
[1:53:47] and if there is a tomorrow more will
[1:53:49] come but why is god allowing those
[1:53:52] things
[1:53:52] to prove you to test you
[1:53:56] amen to make you sure god
[1:53:59] to make you the real efficiency
[1:54:02] [Music]
[1:54:04] because let me tell you in the midst of
[1:54:07] these cantacarous tendencies
[1:54:09] the believers stood there was a
[1:54:11] generation that was not carried away
[1:54:14] there was a generation that remained
[1:54:16] unpolluted
[1:54:17] hallelujah they are not going to accept
[1:54:19] the interpretation of the five-fold
[1:54:22] they will only stay with interpretation
[1:54:25] of the messenger
[1:54:27] there is nobody preaching any mystery
[1:54:30] that is where they deceive your mind
[1:54:32] and swindle you is a spiritual
[1:54:34] sunderland
[1:54:35] all mysteries have been revealed what we
[1:54:38] are preaching
[1:54:39] is the revelation of mysteries
[1:54:44] who are you to preach mystery did the
[1:54:47] word of the lord come to you
[1:54:50] are doing gymnastics on the puppy you
[1:54:52] calling ministries
[1:54:53] ask your audience how much understanding
[1:54:55] do they have
[1:54:56] you left them more confused
[1:55:00] after you are leaving than the time you
[1:55:02] match them and because they themselves
[1:55:05] do not put a value on their souls it's
[1:55:07] okay
[1:55:08] they don't want to offend and you dummy
[1:55:10] your soul
[1:55:12] is high time the efficiency rolls up
[1:55:15] and say give us the message and nothing
[1:55:18] else
[1:55:18] don't give us colored water the water
[1:55:21] that has been colored by a daytime
[1:55:23] colored by an hobby ram colored by a
[1:55:26] cora we don't need colored water
[1:55:28] it brings pollution nobody drinks normal
[1:55:31] pure water
[1:55:32] and gets sick except it's contaminated
[1:55:35] but you drink too much coke you suffer
[1:55:37] sickness
[1:55:38] you drink too much fanta it's a problem
[1:55:40] drink all the water it cleanses your
[1:55:42] system
[1:55:43] give us the pure watch not the ones
[1:55:45] colored
[1:55:47] and painted by the touch of men
[1:55:50] [Applause]
[1:55:54] none of them was sent to you amen
[1:55:57] but distance are there to prove you to
[1:56:00] be sure you come into your inheritance
[1:56:02] the reason a lot of you are not coming
[1:56:05] into your inheritance
[1:56:06] is because you are still taking colored
[1:56:08] waters
[1:56:10] i use the word water because the word of
[1:56:13] god is a water
[1:56:15] that is supposed to be for your
[1:56:16] cleansing you can use coke
[1:56:19] to wash your bleach amen you use
[1:56:22] water to wash your plate that is proper
[1:56:25] cleaning
[1:56:25] do you use coca cola to take your bath
[1:56:28] hey if you use coca-cola to take your
[1:56:31] bath your body will be coming
[1:56:33] you won't even feel clean ants and
[1:56:36] circles will be attracted to you
[1:56:38] but use clean water hallelujah and the
[1:56:41] bride is washed by the water
[1:56:43] of his word
[1:56:49] those who use colored water perish in
[1:56:51] the wilderness
[1:56:52] no inheritance for you no adoption for
[1:56:55] you
[1:56:56] using colored water using the
[1:56:58] interpretation
[1:56:59] of men see how many have risen up in
[1:57:02] these days
[1:57:03] because of offense i won't mention names
[1:57:07] but i'm not afraid they are all colored
[1:57:11] waters
[1:57:12] amen and that is why some of you must
[1:57:15] even repent
[1:57:16] and be pushed of those things they have
[1:57:18] put in you
[1:57:19] amen don't think it is right amen if you
[1:57:22] want to come
[1:57:23] into efficient dispensation if you want
[1:57:26] to be mature
[1:57:27] you want to come into adoption punch
[1:57:30] yourself
[1:57:32] of all colored waters they are not the
[1:57:35] truth
[1:57:36] throw them books away come back to the
[1:57:39] message of the hour
[1:57:40] take it from 46 to 65 hallelujah take it
[1:57:45] all the way you will see the light of
[1:57:47] god
[1:57:48] you will see the program of god you will
[1:57:50] see the purity of god
[1:57:52] then you are on your road to efficient
[1:57:54] masterpiece
[1:58:00] if it sounds offensive to you anywhere
[1:58:02] oh
[1:58:04] may god have mercy i can't apologize for
[1:58:07] the truth but i can ask the lord we have
[1:58:09] mercy
[1:58:10] let the lord have mercy upon me let the
[1:58:12] lord have mercy upon you
[1:58:13] it's all i can say the hour is getting
[1:58:16] late
[1:58:17] we've got to come into trueness the
[1:58:19] message is either right or wrong
[1:58:22] if it is right let us give our whole to
[1:58:24] it i'm showing you
[1:58:26] things that prevented some people from
[1:58:28] coming into the inheritance
[1:58:30] the inheritance is the dispensation of
[1:58:33] the ephesians
[1:58:35] [Music]
[1:58:39] cora dayton and haram had their time
[1:58:42] amen
[1:58:43] it never shook the church even aaron who
[1:58:45] was so close to the blessing at this
[1:58:47] time
[1:58:48] did you realize that god is not
[1:58:50] respecter of persons
[1:58:52] aaron was the man used to building
[1:58:54] golden calf
[1:58:56] and the prophet said we still have the
[1:58:58] golden calf schemes today
[1:59:00] let me show you the golden calf schemes
[1:59:02] quickly
[1:59:07] when moses was absent from them
[1:59:11] what did he go for he went to
[1:59:14] collect the watch
[1:59:17] that will govern that hour is that not
[1:59:20] the truth church
[1:59:22] before it came what did men say as for
[1:59:25] these moses
[1:59:27] we don't know what has become of him
[1:59:30] so they used a priest
[1:59:34] they used the fivefold hear me clearly
[1:59:39] to invent a scheme to substitute
[1:59:44] what they were to have expected
[1:59:51] and that was where everyone came into
[1:59:52] the picture
[1:59:55] church what was the confession of aaron
[1:59:57] i fear the people
[2:00:00] he doesn't want to lose his popularity
[2:00:02] before the people
[2:00:03] he doesn't want to lose his scholarship
[2:00:06] he still wants to be in their good books
[2:00:08] i don't care for good books i want peace
[2:00:11] with god
[2:00:16] are you listening to me i'm telling you
[2:00:19] the confession of aaron
[2:00:21] some of you knew the truth and you still
[2:00:24] know it
[2:00:25] but because of pecuniary objectives
[2:00:28] because of some benefits physical
[2:00:31] benefit for your body
[2:00:34] fun-seeking pleasure loving generation
[2:00:37] at the expense of your soul you can't
[2:00:40] stand right
[2:00:44] you think aaron never knew better errant
[2:00:47] because of popularity he confessed it
[2:00:50] himself
[2:00:53] i'm not describing it that was what he
[2:00:55] said he said you know your people
[2:01:00] it was left there to guide the people
[2:01:03] it was legs there to keep them in the
[2:01:05] path of righteousness
[2:01:06] hallelujah but the people became of his
[2:01:09] stature to intimidate the ministry
[2:01:12] jezebel religion here jezebel is him
[2:01:16] here
[2:01:18] and heron boccucc under popularity
[2:01:20] impression
[2:01:23] and they told them to bring all the
[2:01:25] things they brought from the world
[2:01:27] what do you do with them anyway you
[2:01:30] still keep them they will lead into
[2:01:34] idolatry
[2:01:36] it did in the beginning we do at the end
[2:01:38] time they brought all their earrings
[2:01:40] and so forth all those things they
[2:01:42] borrowed from egyptians
[2:01:45] it wasn't their way it was what they
[2:01:47] watched in the egyptians
[2:01:49] they are not completely poached yet
[2:01:52] that is why justification is not your
[2:01:54] absolute project
[2:01:55] listen to me it takes care of them of
[2:01:58] your past
[2:01:59] but if you don't move beyond them the
[2:02:01] root of that sin
[2:02:03] what makes you live like a sinner is
[2:02:05] stealing you
[2:02:06] even under justification when you are
[2:02:10] sanctified you prune the branches
[2:02:12] you need the holy ghost which is fire to
[2:02:15] kill the roots
[2:02:17] place himself in your life so this
[2:02:20] church in the wilderness having gone
[2:02:21] through directive baptism
[2:02:23] is still not much they still have a
[2:02:27] strong influence of egypt
[2:02:28] after all how many of them made it many
[2:02:31] perish in the wilderness
[2:02:32] because you of the overbearing influence
[2:02:35] of egypt
[2:02:37] anything light affliction any small
[2:02:39] challenge are there no graves in egypt
[2:02:41] come on george you can be worldly and be
[2:02:45] christian at the same time you must
[2:02:47] choose one
[2:02:49] you cannot serve god and mamman at the
[2:02:52] same time
[2:02:53] you must choose one
[2:02:59] he gathered it all together and he made
[2:03:01] for them
[2:03:02] a golden calf and a man who got carried
[2:03:05] away
[2:03:05] by the time he finished making it the
[2:03:08] action
[2:03:09] of those people converted iran do you
[2:03:11] know what he said
[2:03:12] he said beyond israel your god that
[2:03:14] brought you out of here
[2:03:16] the high priest of israel
[2:03:21] church don't carry the image of any holy
[2:03:23] man
[2:03:24] no matter how nice they are to you
[2:03:27] if they leave the world leave them alone
[2:03:30] [Applause]
[2:03:32] they didn't die for you their blood was
[2:03:35] not shared for you
[2:03:36] they can't take they didn't bring you
[2:03:38] here they can't take you anywhere
[2:03:42] be concerned about your soul some of you
[2:03:45] money is your god and that is why you
[2:03:48] can detach yourself
[2:03:49] from evil
[2:03:53] the whole high priest of israel said
[2:03:55] beyond your god
[2:03:58] and israel started worshiping the moment
[2:04:01] the worship began
[2:04:02] it created such a revival the prophet
[2:04:04] called it the golden calf scheme
[2:04:07] how many five-fold ministries are doing
[2:04:09] it today
[2:04:11] what is the intention to replace the
[2:04:14] message
[2:04:15] they don't tell you frontally because
[2:04:17] they are no bulge but by the time they
[2:04:19] finish with you
[2:04:20] you will realize that you are out of the
[2:04:22] range of the message
[2:04:23] you are in another economy
[2:04:27] and those of you who have suffered the
[2:04:28] faith you know better oh sure
[2:04:30] if you want to be honest with yourself
[2:04:33] it is the old fighters at work
[2:04:39] then after this after they came out of
[2:04:41] that they came
[2:04:44] to the ten elders
[2:04:48] or was it the balaam just unlike that
[2:04:51] and the ten elders told them
[2:04:55] you cannot make it the spirit of the ten
[2:04:58] elders are see here
[2:05:00] amen after that they came to
[2:05:03] balance doctrine we are all one
[2:05:10] we are all the same
[2:05:14] the prophet said what was what was is
[2:05:17] that
[2:05:17] the prophecy of balaam was correct but
[2:05:20] the teaching of balaam was dangerous
[2:05:23] because balaam's attempt
[2:05:26] to run contrary to the message of that
[2:05:29] day makes him false
[2:05:30] to begin with amen
[2:05:34] but when it speaks prophecies it was
[2:05:36] correct
[2:05:38] when his prophecy couldn't curse the
[2:05:40] people of god
[2:05:41] he brought a teaching we all won
[2:05:47] so in the feast of balaam you have all
[2:05:49] kinds of people
[2:05:51] those who dress and look like moabites
[2:05:54] full moabites in appearance they have
[2:05:57] their lifestyle forget it
[2:06:00] they have the appearance they as worldly
[2:06:03] as worldly can be
[2:06:05] amen the face is painted
[2:06:08] they came out of the world from painting
[2:06:10] they got into
[2:06:12] they got into the message we padded
[2:06:16] until a black sister will look like a a
[2:06:19] brownish sister
[2:06:21] god knows your house address
[2:06:24] [Music]
[2:06:26] if sons of gods are still who they are
[2:06:28] they won't marry anything like that
[2:06:34] pancaking your face it didn't start now
[2:06:38] the prophet said before you marry i tell
[2:06:40] her to go and wash your face
[2:06:42] because yeah it's a quotation it's a
[2:06:45] quotation
[2:06:46] i don't care what you call it the devil
[2:06:50] will take you
[2:06:50] from lipstick and it will start giving
[2:06:54] you some funny funny things
[2:06:57] it will take you from from full blown
[2:07:00] painting
[2:07:01] it will give you the one they call
[2:07:02] organic at the end of the day it changes
[2:07:04] your face
[2:07:07] if it's hurting you please
[2:07:11] forgive me for hurting you but i cannot
[2:07:13] repent of what i'm saying
[2:07:16] if your pastor appreciates that's fine
[2:07:18] go on with it
[2:07:19] but the prophet told me some of it is
[2:07:24] balaamism
[2:07:28] and i told you if they were not making
[2:07:31] up their face
[2:07:32] he will not tell you to go and watch why
[2:07:33] are you doing those things
[2:07:36] you want to have a beautiful identity
[2:07:40] if that is what the boy marries don't
[2:07:43] forget you will always take time home to
[2:07:45] wash
[2:07:46] and the devil polish a lot of you when
[2:07:49] you are doing your evening beauty
[2:07:51] routine you can spend two hours removing
[2:07:52] this removing that
[2:07:54] a christian sister
[2:07:59] it's balaamism amen it brought them
[2:08:03] together
[2:08:03] oh all we know is that we are united by
[2:08:06] common purpose
[2:08:07] we are not the same
[2:08:10] look let me tell you why some people
[2:08:12] were collapsing for these things
[2:08:14] you know 25 000 people died in the
[2:08:17] battle of bala
[2:08:20] the entire people died in the matter of
[2:08:21] ten elders
[2:08:23] many also died in the matter of colorado
[2:08:25] and abraham
[2:08:26] because even after seeing the obvious
[2:08:29] hand of the lord that was heavy upon
[2:08:32] those men
[2:08:32] some people were still sympathizers who
[2:08:35] came to attack
[2:08:36] moses you have killed the people of god
[2:08:38] and god wiped them out just the same
[2:08:41] it didn't cost god anything then it
[2:08:43] wouldn't cost him
[2:08:44] anything now
[2:08:50] generation of sympathizers with evil
[2:08:54] osha it didn't begin now read your bible
[2:08:58] and why was god doing all this pudging
[2:09:00] along the way
[2:09:02] because the efficient church must be
[2:09:04] pure
[2:09:07] it will take the cream of the cream
[2:09:11] the survival of the fetus amen
[2:09:15] so god at every state was pudging that
[2:09:17] church
[2:09:18] reducing it to a number that it will
[2:09:21] only accommodate
[2:09:23] the predestinated unto adoption
[2:09:26] those who are meant for that inheritance
[2:09:31] depositing continues church
[2:09:35] you see their parents today you can't
[2:09:37] tell a difference
[2:09:38] the illy so i as if no as
[2:09:42] i don't blame them they don't read the
[2:09:43] message they read other authorities
[2:09:47] the guys who want to be popular the old
[2:09:49] fighters
[2:09:50] amen we are living in the days that this
[2:09:53] one is a judgment that one is a joshua
[2:09:55] we have had duplications of jews who are
[2:09:57] more than 25 or
[2:09:58] 30 people claiming joshua he tells me
[2:10:00] they are counterfeits
[2:10:04] you don't even know who joshua is
[2:10:10] so what was happening
[2:10:14] it brought them eventually to the border
[2:10:18] it brought them to that poison level
[2:10:21] when the
[2:10:22] church was perfectly pushed the movement
[2:10:25] began
[2:10:26] am i still preaching the bible then god
[2:10:29] told the messenger
[2:10:32] it is now time for you to leave
[2:10:36] now you must begin to decrease
[2:10:40] hallelujah something else must increase
[2:10:44] amen then the lord told him go and
[2:10:47] anoint
[2:10:48] joshua
[2:10:51] church of the living god joshua was
[2:10:55] anointed
[2:10:56] and moses the servant of the lord left
[2:10:59] the prophet said the mess he said in our
[2:11:02] dispensation we have come
[2:11:04] through a lot of persians
[2:11:07] in our justification sanctification we
[2:11:09] have been pushed
[2:11:11] until we came to these last days
[2:11:14] entering into our inheritance
[2:11:19] and before the prophet left in 1965 he
[2:11:22] said
[2:11:22] now we are here in the efficient
[2:11:26] in the efficient age
[2:11:33] when joshua was to take
[2:11:36] over god told him
[2:11:40] do everything as moses
[2:11:45] has given you
[2:11:48] joshua had no idea of how to
[2:11:52] pull down the barrier that would take
[2:11:54] the saints
[2:11:55] into the inheritance the angel of the
[2:11:58] lord
[2:11:59] had to come down from on high amen
[2:12:03] from 1946
[2:12:07] to 1962 we have lived in the
[2:12:11] dispensation
[2:12:12] of the messenger to the laudacian church
[2:12:15] age
[2:12:18] as a matter of fact we are all in love
[2:12:21] this year
[2:12:24] i'm winding down closely but you must
[2:12:26] get this speech
[2:12:27] because i want to show you who you are
[2:12:32] now
[2:12:34] from the ministry of the signing the
[2:12:36] hands
[2:12:37] to that that discern the thoughts of men
[2:12:40] and the wonderful evangelisms that went
[2:12:43] on the efficient church the efficient
[2:12:46] congregation
[2:12:48] was in the background
[2:12:51] the people of joshua were in the
[2:12:53] background
[2:12:55] nobody knew them the ministry of the
[2:12:59] prophet for those number of years
[2:13:01] could only produce all manner of
[2:13:03] congregation
[2:13:06] from among these numbers
[2:13:11] god must sieve out certain people
[2:13:18] are you listening to me god must
[2:13:22] identify the people who are ready to be
[2:13:25] placed
[2:13:25] into the inheritance
[2:13:28] the messenger of the hour cannot place
[2:13:31] you into your inheritance
[2:13:33] moses never pleased them he
[2:13:36] saw them he called them out through
[2:13:38] their call-outs
[2:13:40] he saw them through their purging in the
[2:13:42] wilderness
[2:13:45] but he handed them over to joshua to
[2:13:48] please them
[2:13:50] didn't william brahm came to a point
[2:13:54] that he said i must decrease how many
[2:13:58] have i read it
[2:14:00] and he must increase is that if i am not
[2:14:04] that person
[2:14:05] i am laying the foundation for that
[2:14:07] person
[2:14:08] so that when it does come i must
[2:14:12] decrease and he must
[2:14:15] increase
[2:14:19] those statements were not made for
[2:14:20] nothing
[2:14:23] when john the baptist made that
[2:14:25] statement
[2:14:27] is because his own ministry as the
[2:14:30] messenger
[2:14:31] and the foreigner was ready to give way
[2:14:36] to the ministry of the lord jesus christ
[2:14:38] himself
[2:14:42] who are you to call yourself joshua you
[2:14:45] do not
[2:14:45] fit java means joshua means jehovah
[2:14:49] savior it's only christ that bears that
[2:14:53] name
[2:14:54] that is why in some scriptures
[2:14:56] interpretation
[2:14:57] in the place of joshua they put jesus
[2:15:04] even i think in the authorized king
[2:15:06] james version in the new testament there
[2:15:08] was a place they should have used joshua
[2:15:10] they used the word jesus it's a
[2:15:13] revelation
[2:15:17] somebody must present us
[2:15:21] we must have years of preparation
[2:15:24] amen and let me tell you as a church we
[2:15:28] have added
[2:15:30] by the pro i'm not talking of as a local
[2:15:32] church
[2:15:33] as the move of god for this age we have
[2:15:36] added the years of preparations
[2:15:40] the years of persians
[2:15:43] the world fighters are going out
[2:15:47] because if they remain they will keep
[2:15:49] you from your inheritance
[2:15:55] their ministries can never bring you to
[2:15:57] inheritance
[2:15:58] because their ministries intended to be
[2:16:01] substitute
[2:16:03] to the message of the hour joshua was
[2:16:06] not a substitute for moses
[2:16:10] joshua was the captain of moses
[2:16:15] that was why the instruction to joshua
[2:16:18] was that
[2:16:18] do not depart
[2:16:23] may god give his church revelation
[2:16:27] meditate in this day and night
[2:16:33] joshua watched unto his that everything
[2:16:36] he did
[2:16:37] was according to what he was given
[2:16:41] common church
[2:16:47] those who teach you that the messenger
[2:16:49] was only a prophet
[2:16:50] he's not a teacher
[2:16:54] they want to destroy the also they are
[2:16:56] hold fighters
[2:16:57] they must give away
[2:17:01] i say it prophetically and they are
[2:17:03] giving way
[2:17:04] because the children of jubilee must see
[2:17:06] their lives
[2:17:07] they must come into their full
[2:17:09] inheritance they are ready in the land
[2:17:11] of ephesians they must
[2:17:13] enjoy every benefit we must come to full
[2:17:16] adoption
[2:17:18] amen
[2:17:27] so joshua did you ever see anywhere
[2:17:31] where joshua contradicted moses
[2:17:35] the things you don't know the things you
[2:17:38] read
[2:17:38] moses act joshua acted it out
[2:17:42] amen the pleasant of everybody
[2:17:45] was according to the message of moses
[2:17:49] let me harmonize it for you when john
[2:17:52] said i must increase i must decrease our
[2:17:54] name was increased
[2:17:56] who did he refer to the lord jesus
[2:18:00] christ
[2:18:00] isn't it if moses decrees
[2:18:05] and he increased who was he referring to
[2:18:08] jesus christ joshua jehovah savior
[2:18:13] [Music]
[2:18:15] that was why joseph joshua needed the
[2:18:18] visitation
[2:18:19] from above a full manifestation of the
[2:18:23] angel of the lord
[2:18:25] who gave him its seven seals
[2:18:32] i can read it for you here the prophet
[2:18:36] said for a week for us to come into our
[2:18:38] efficient dispensation
[2:18:40] efficient blessing we need the opening
[2:18:43] of the seals
[2:18:47] he's right here what was it to lose
[2:18:53] it was to lose jericho completely
[2:18:57] it was to december jericho so that
[2:18:59] because that was the wall
[2:19:01] that separated that exodus church from
[2:19:04] the inheritance when it is disarmed they
[2:19:07] will see the blessings
[2:19:11] and even joshua as a person couldn't do
[2:19:13] it
[2:19:14] it would take the real he took the real
[2:19:16] joshua
[2:19:17] amen you say who was that
[2:19:21] who was that did joshua worship that man
[2:19:24] or not
[2:19:26] hey hey hey did he worship him or not
[2:19:32] the angel that came down did he reject
[2:19:34] the worship
[2:19:35] did he accept the worship why would he
[2:19:37] accept the worship
[2:19:39] who was he
[2:19:44] [Music]
[2:19:47] so who did moses actually decrees for
[2:19:53] ah church of god
[2:19:57] who did it decrees for
[2:20:00] you thinking joshua was moses minister
[2:20:03] a fivefold moses cannot decrease for
[2:20:07] joshua
[2:20:09] [Music]
[2:20:14] moses left the sin
[2:20:17] for the god of exodus himself
[2:20:20] to take over his business
[2:20:25] the god of exodus took over
[2:20:28] and they walk through the five volts to
[2:20:31] bless the people
[2:20:33] in their blessings isn't this the
[2:20:36] scripture
[2:20:37] it's as simple as it can be but the
[2:20:40] five-fold couldn't have any thought
[2:20:43] they don't have any idea they don't have
[2:20:46] any opinion
[2:20:47] because the rule of engagement is say
[2:20:50] what the tip says
[2:20:52] say only what moses had said
[2:21:00] if they do not say according to the law
[2:21:03] and the prophet
[2:21:04] the spirit of god is not in them that's
[2:21:06] what the scripture said
[2:21:09] i'm nailing it here for you now as i
[2:21:11] went
[2:21:12] down
[2:21:15] in these last days the prophet said i
[2:21:17] must decrease
[2:21:19] enemas increase who did it decrease for
[2:21:23] it decreased for me it will decrease for
[2:21:26] you
[2:21:27] when i am to look up to him to him the
[2:21:30] word of the lord came
[2:21:32] and the proof that i am a genuine
[2:21:33] minister is the grace i received to
[2:21:36] follow what he touched
[2:21:38] paul said follow me as i follow christ
[2:21:41] it cannot decrease for
[2:21:42] you
[2:21:43] [Applause]
[2:21:45] [Music]
[2:21:48] if it decreased for you that shows it
[2:21:51] was foreign in you
[2:21:53] that wasn't the message at oil river as
[2:21:56] john the baptist was sent to forron
[2:22:01] the first coming of who the first coming
[2:22:05] of christ
[2:22:06] you are sent with the message that we do
[2:22:08] what
[2:22:09] for run the second coming of who
[2:22:15] of jesus christ so if william brahm
[2:22:19] decrees and he said he must increase
[2:22:22] it decrease for christ
[2:22:26] and that was why christ had to come in
[2:22:28] 1963
[2:22:30] swallow he church the old fighters are
[2:22:33] fighting that
[2:22:34] they said it is the smoke of aeroplane
[2:22:37] some people
[2:22:38] are saying let's not say not to create
[2:22:40] offense they are already offensive
[2:22:42] and they must get the offense because
[2:22:44] they are prone to offence
[2:22:46] but blessed are those who are not
[2:22:48] offended in the gospel
[2:22:50] of righteousness if you feel offended it
[2:22:53] is your personal
[2:22:54] headache

[2:23:16] you are not doing anything new we
[2:23:19] expected you and you came

[2:23:23] the truth
[2:23:24] [Applause]
[2:23:26] if this message parallels that of moses
[2:23:30] it must have everything moses heard amen
[2:23:34] moses ministry suffered implosion an
[2:23:37] explosion explosion from pharaoh
[2:23:40] implosion from dayton quran and aberrant
[2:23:42] dating quran and abirah there were

[2:23:59] beginning

[2:24:03] much you can endure to the end
[2:24:05] the reward is for those who finish who
[2:24:08] finish the line

[2:24:38] how many converts
[2:24:40] have you taken out of the message for

[2:28:04] to how it should be before now we used
[2:28:06] to turn it like this
[2:28:08] and the spirit of lord said tonight this
[2:28:10] way
[2:28:11] and the prophet said only god knows the
[2:28:14] right angle

[2:31:30] not to do it
[2:31:31] it doesn't mean he cannot do it but he
[2:31:34] told
[2:31:34] he never told us to where which one did
[2:31:36] we do or not he told us to only believe
[2:31:39] he told us to ask we will keep asking
[2:31:42] and we will stand upon it and he will

[2:32:02] sinners are coming to christ backsliders
[2:32:05] are restoring
[2:32:06] those who haven't been citizens are
[2:32:08] having victories and he said things are
[2:32:10] not taking place
[2:32:11] come and church
[2:32:19] you love him you love him
[2:32:25] from that point that the angel came down
[2:32:29] oh man they told him go back you were in
[2:32:32] the west
[2:32:33] it was a setting of the song for loud
[2:32:35] this year
[2:32:37] but now go back to east because it
[2:32:40] should be the rising of the sun for the
[2:32:41] ephesians
[2:32:45] the real elect from among the crowds the
[2:32:48] god will come out by that
[2:32:50] hallelujah and we begin to feast on
[2:32:53] eternal things
[2:32:54] and the body said our the prophet said
[2:32:56] in the message it is the rising of the
[2:32:58] sun
[2:32:58] our body begin to respond to each he
[2:33:01] said this body cannot be delivered
[2:33:03] but we receive a power that put it under
[2:33:05] subjection
[2:33:06] and he said that is why whatever the
[2:33:08] word says we are just so each
[2:33:10] we are just to it we are losing our
[2:33:13] whole identity
[2:33:14] we are coming to new creature identity
[2:33:16] we are testifying in our lives
[2:33:19] that if any man be in christ is a new
[2:33:21] creature
[2:33:22] all things are indeed passed away
[2:33:24] because we are witnesses
[2:33:26] of the change taking place in our system
[2:33:29] the word is healing the word is
[2:33:31] delivering the word is setting free
[2:33:34] the law oh man
[2:33:37] the word is blessing the word is
[2:33:39] provided
[2:33:40] the word is satisfying us
[2:33:43] the word is becoming our eternal portion
[2:33:46] it's getting real and real
[2:33:48] we are connecting with where we are
[2:33:49] going that blessed land is becoming real
[2:33:52] and we are more than willing to give up
[2:33:54] anything for the sake of the kingdom
[2:33:57] hallelujah
[2:34:00] it's a major deliverance guess what
[2:34:04] i write down with this thoughts the
[2:34:06] prophet said
[2:34:08] when those angels came
[2:34:11] and they brought those truths by the
[2:34:14] unction of christ
[2:34:16] god still needed him amen
[2:34:19] to by that revelation set the church in
[2:34:22] order
[2:34:23] announce our efficient economy and give
[2:34:26] us the message of our pleasing
[2:34:30] that was why god never took him early
[2:34:32] 63.
[2:34:34] he witnessed it and the truth was
[2:34:38] deposited in its earthen vessel
[2:34:40] to bless the church to place the
[2:34:43] fivefold
[2:34:44] to bless the families amen that was why
[2:34:47] we have the correctness
[2:34:49] the truth of marriage and divorce the
[2:34:51] truth of serpentine
[2:34:52] you say has been preached before watch
[2:34:54] the trail
[2:34:56] everything came to perfection by the
[2:34:59] teaching of the world
[2:35:00] through the angel of the lord that came
[2:35:02] down
[2:35:05] and this is the reason the prophet said
[2:35:08] my bible in my hand became watch did he
[2:35:12] say so
[2:35:13] oh it should be sinful for you not to
[2:35:16] say he didn't say that
[2:35:17] he said my bible became a new book in my
[2:35:20] hands
[2:35:21] hallelujah he said he said we have said
[2:35:24] things before that we need to pull back
[2:35:28] we need to reverse back and put real
[2:35:30] lives on edge
[2:35:32] it talked about 70 weeks of daniel he
[2:35:34] told us now it remains three and a half
[2:35:36] years
[2:35:37] he talked about those living creators
[2:35:40] that even the prophet himself had called
[2:35:43] some of them
[2:35:44] had called the white house writer
[2:35:47] jesus christ by better understanding and
[2:35:51] revelation
[2:35:52] for whom it decreased for the ministry
[2:35:54] of christ that took over
[2:35:56] he said now we know better it is satan
[2:35:59] in his deceptive form coming to the
[2:36:02] church you cannot tell me that seven
[2:36:04] seal was not a blessing
[2:36:06] it brought the capstone blessing
[2:36:09] it brought the correctness and the
[2:36:11] perfect truth of marriage and divorce
[2:36:14] and all the other blessings which you
[2:36:17] need
[2:36:18] to come into your full blessing this was
[2:36:21] the efficient church of the bible heart
[2:36:23] and this is what these last day
[2:36:25] ephesians will have
[2:36:27] in order to come into their full
[2:36:29] inheritance
[2:36:30] and as we feast on this we'll be
[2:36:34] punished
[2:36:36] yeah that's my closing shot you will be
[2:36:39] tried
[2:36:40] you will be tempted you will be cleansed
[2:36:44] you will face challenges sometimes your
[2:36:47] business will fail
[2:36:48] for god to test your love for him i have
[2:36:51] no time i could read it out of the coach
[2:36:53] you say
[2:36:53] business faith god allows it to pudge
[2:36:57] you
[2:36:59] because you need character to carry the
[2:37:02] blessings
[2:37:03] that are ahead a wonderful time is ahead
[2:37:06] the prophet said it is the efficient
[2:37:08] church that will fulfill mark 11.
[2:37:11] it is the efficient church that will
[2:37:12] speak to the mountains
[2:37:14] it is the efficient church that will
[2:37:16] speak the need of the believers among
[2:37:18] themselves it is that church that his
[2:37:20] brother will say i need dream that will
[2:37:22] give him reign
[2:37:23] it is a vision church that will speak
[2:37:25] cancer out of existence
[2:37:26] it is the efficient church that will
[2:37:28] bring grain for his brother
[2:37:30] it is a vision church that would
[2:37:32] demonstrate the power of spoken word
[2:37:34] it wasn't the preserve of the prophet
[2:37:37] alone
[2:37:37] it was waved as the first chief to
[2:37:40] create
[2:37:41] faith in you and i for a perfect return
[2:37:44] because before they fall in genesis that
[2:37:47] was who you are
[2:37:48] you speak and everything obeys
[2:37:52] you will come into that dominance you
[2:37:54] will come into that domain
[2:37:56] you will come into that blessings if you
[2:37:58] feel we are that part of the church
[2:38:01] way man whoever lives with the coming of
[2:38:03] the lord amen you are that part of the
[2:38:05] church
[2:38:06] that will put a capstone on all the sins
[2:38:09] of all ages
[2:38:10] they without us cannot be brought to
[2:38:13] perfection
[2:38:14] you are the perfection of that church
[2:38:16] and because you are going to carry a
[2:38:18] great blessing
[2:38:19] god must pudge you you must know what to
[2:38:21] do with the gift of god
[2:38:23] character is not a gift it is a watch
[2:38:27] is a watch it's a victory for every
[2:38:30] higher ground
[2:38:31] for every higher possession there must
[2:38:33] be pudging
[2:38:34] there must be cleansing that is why god
[2:38:36] will allow the devil
[2:38:37] to attack you like he did rule just to
[2:38:40] watch your action
[2:38:41] just to watch your manner and after
[2:38:43] those challenges are gone
[2:38:45] you will stand pure as the god of god
[2:38:48] god will set you aside amen
[2:38:52] he may not be all everybody who look
[2:38:54] forward to it is part of it
[2:38:56] but those of us who live till that hour
[2:38:59] will have more more demonstration
[2:39:01] the prophet said the antichrist is
[2:39:03] tightening up the antichrist is
[2:39:05] tightening up to bring out the best in
[2:39:07] us
[2:39:07] this is not the age of massacre it is
[2:39:10] not an ox age
[2:39:11] it is flying eagle age when the enemy
[2:39:14] comes like a flood
[2:39:16] the standard they'll be raising this age
[2:39:19] is for us to match
[2:39:20] him is for us to match him there is
[2:39:23] going to be a pressure
[2:39:25] that will give us a press until we are
[2:39:27] almost preserved
[2:39:28] the efficient church will be ready to
[2:39:31] demonstrate the thoughtful then
[2:39:32] he said watch the thoughtful then a
[2:39:35] great time lays ahead
[2:39:37] we aren't going to live here without
[2:39:39] some sort of display
[2:39:41] and it should be the church of ephesians
[2:39:43] but before the display
[2:39:44] we must eat much more things we must eat
[2:39:47] bones
[2:39:48] we must eat things that we robert make
[2:39:50] believe
[2:39:51] that we take pretty nature that will
[2:39:53] take peter living
[2:39:55] that with the pretty tendencies that
[2:39:57] will bring us into that masterpiece
[2:39:59] that we that we have femme to us where
[2:40:01] the sons of the most are
[2:40:03] and when that our king will not be a
[2:40:05] casualty

[2:40:09] efficients
