We bless your name. We thank you. You answer prayer. You are God tonight. God over sickness, God over disease, God over every condition, every situation. We thank you in advance for what you are about to do. We thank you in advance for what you're going to bless this prayer meeting. Have your own way. I pray in the name of Jesus. Father God, I pray come in a special way and minister to each heart. In Jesus name I ask it. Amen. And amen. God bless you and thank you for being here tonight. And if you have your Bibles, I'd like you to go to a scripture here tonight. I want to go to two portion of scripture. Uh, Exodus chapter 4, we want to read verse 20- 23 and Hosea 11 1 verse verse 1. Exodus chapter 4 on verse 20. And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set him upon an ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt. And Moses took the rod of God in his hand. And the Lord said unto Moses, "When thou goest to return into Egypt, see that thou do all those wonders before Pharaoh, which I have put in thine hand, and I but I will harden his heart, that he shall not let the people go, and thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus sayeth the Lord, Israel is my son, even my firstborn. And I say unto thee, let my son go, that he may serve me. And if thou refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay thy son, even thy firstborn. Hosea 11:1 reads, "When Israel was a child, then I loved him and I called my son out of Egypt." May God bless his word. Tonight, I want to share something with you. Let my son go that he may serve me. And I trust that this would be a word not just only of encouragement but of faith in your own heart how God sees things. Here it is. There's a people under bondage for 400 years. And it was a kind of a a blow mind to me to see these scriptures. How God saw Israel as his son. Note how God saw Israel as a son. Note God is interested in family. Note the whole concept of adoption is connected to family. Elohim self-existing alone becoming Jehovah God, God with his family. Genesis was about God's family, not church, but individuals. Who is Adam? than Eve. People today are churched, churchified, if we're going to use that word, in the last days. Yet to us Gentiles, he's calling you and I as individuals. So I want to zero in tonight on this individual, this son. But Abraham says, he says, "My hope is built on nothing less than Jesus, blood, and righteousness. All other grounds, every church, every denomination is sinking sand. Whether it's mother or father, loved ones, whether it's friend, whatever it is, all other ground is sinking sand. On Christ alone I stand. It's an individual affair, not of groups of people, but it is to you as an individual that you yourself as a soul human being might notice, might forsake your own thoughts. As long as you have your own thoughts, your own ways, your own ways are contrary to God's ways. You cannot be right and think your own thoughts, for you have got to die through your own thoughts. Do you know that your thoughts as long as you look at it, you look at it materially, you say, "Well, that can't happen. It's not reasonable. It's not sensible even to think such a thing." As long as you do that, then you will stay in the same condition. You have got to get to a place where you cannot think your ways, but come into Christ and think his ways. Take his words. Then things begin to shape different. Now, it's one thing to see Israel as a people, Israel as a nation. And it's another thing to see God's viewpoint, note God's viewpoint, tell Pharaoh, let go my son. And I feel this is a word that we have to be interested in. The purpose of releasing from bondage is that he might serve me. Not just to free him, but free to serve. So what that tells us is that we cannot really serve God correctly or properly if we're in bondage. Bondage is a stream. Bondage is what is controlling you, what is affecting you, what is afflicting you. And you have to long for freedom from bondage. There must be no bondage with the people of God. And you'll see from what I'm going to share what Jes how Jesus saw his own commission. Brother Abraham says this. No matter what the Brandham tabernacle ever turns out to be. Listen. No matter what the Brandham tabernacle ever turns out to be, don't let it be you. So in other words, he is saying don't let the brand tabacle be the standard. Don't let the Brandham tackle whether it fall whether it stand. That is not what you're supposed to look at. It is not up to the Brandham tabernacle. Neither is it up to any other churches. It is up to you as an individual to be ready at the coming of the Lord. You must be ready. I must be ready. I sweep my own steps. It's up to you to sweep your steps. Leave mine alone. Me, leave yours alone. You've got to make your garment ready. So, I want to challenge you tonight. Stop making excuses. Confront yourself. Stop blaming others. Stop blaming your past. Stop blaming your condition and your situation and begin to own up. He said the Pentecostal church needs a cleansing all the way from the front to the back through the cellar basement upstairs. The Pentecostal church needs a revolutionary, a revolt against the things that is wrong and accept the things that are right. A fresh baptism of the Holy Ghost, a church to make herself ready. God calls you as an individual. Watch. He says it's you that's got to clean up because he is taking a people from the Gentiles for his name's sake his bride gentile Esther clean herself she clean her heart and that's what she clean that is what the church needs a heart cleaning how do you clean your heart brother Brandham wash by the water of the word through the blood of Jesus so again God don't deal with a person in a group. God don't deal with you in an organization. People love their church. People love their group. But the reality is this. He deals with you as an individual. An individual. Individually, we are baptized with the Holy Ghost. Collectively, we are baptized into the body. When we are baptized with the Holy Ghost individually, each one with the Holy Ghost, God is dealing with each one. That's his purpose. And here's Bob scatter them across the earth so he could deal individually with each of them. That's the purpose. God scatter people across the earth so he could deal with individuals. So there ought not to be any person between you and God. Let me say it again tonight. Nobody. No pastor, no elder, no deacon. It's supposed to be you and God. In this age of adoption or age of maturity, it's age of which sons have to come forth. And the scripture in Hosea said it's so beautiful. When Israel was a child, I loved him. And I call my son out of Egypt. God cannot leave us in Egypt. A call have to go out to get us out. Egypt is the world. Egypt of our flesh. Egypt is canality. Whatever of negativity of this earth, of this dust is like Egypt. And the call is to call and to come out clean out of Egypt. I call my son out of Egypt. What's the purpose he want that son come out for? That he might serve me. Not that he may be a better lived Egyptian or executive Egyptian or a more prosperous Egyptian. No. Come out called out that he might serve me. Okay, let's continue. He says, watch this. There's a time bullheaded amongst women. You wonder why I'm hollering about this. Now I'm going to lay a lot of scriptures. He said, "Now I'll show you why." And that's the reason. Here we go. I've got to stay true to this word. And every servant of God ought to stay true to the word. You must stay because there's got to be a voice somewhere but crying out against it. This part I want to get to. I don't care what the rest of them does. You are not responsible for them. You answer as an individual. You don't answer as a Methodist. We will say to this uh I belong to this tabernacle. You don't answer as a Methodist. You don't answer as a Baptist. I belong to this other tabernacle or a Pentecostal. You answer as an individual to God for your own life. Praise God. The church is looking for better letters. I have this written here. God is looking for better men channel that he could exert his power upon the world. What the church needs today is not more machinery, a new organization or better methods, but men whom the Holy Ghost can use. Men of prayer. Men mighty in prayer. The Holy Ghost does not flow through methods but through men. He does not come on machinery but on men. He does not anoint plans and thoughts and ideas in that way but men of prayer. So at the ending of the day God is seeking better men not so much better methods but better man. And that is what he said about David and comparing to Saul I find a better man. You know people look at gifts, ministerial gifts, pastor gift, apostle gift, prophet gift or whatever gift and they look at gift but this was the curse of the Pentecostal age. Gifted men without life and that is what he sent a prophet to bring the word that we could have life along with gifts. So the emphasis is not who is more gifted, who higher gifted, who are more revelation, who have more uh knowledge or more information, but coming into this stature of life which the prophets call the perfect man. Listen to this as we kind of wrap up here. We hear this cry on the radio, Lord, give us a revival in our time. It's uplifted to hear people cry for revival. And God made a promise. If my people that is called by my name shall assemble themselves together and pray, I'll hear from heaven. And tonight we want to think on that and remember in the midst of all this cry, God, here we go, cannot send a revival until he's got man in shape to take it. Now, we know the bride revival is promised. He spoke that seven thunders will be the bright revival. That is promised. He said we cannot have a revival until we got God called men. This is not books. This is not given out tapes. God trained men that is not trained up in a school of theology or education but rugged men of faith that God has brought through his school of rugged training. Men who are not afraid to face the fire. Men who has come into the presence of God and knows his power. Knows his omnipotence. knows his healing power. Some men train to know the living God. It's right to train them by the word, but the letter killth. The spirit giveth life. And before we can have this revival, God has to call out and train men. God trained men to carry this message. They don't care what the opposition is. They are willing to go to the fiery furnace and defeat or to the lion's den or wherever it may be. They are ready to go because they have been in the presence of God and know that he is whether he's a victory or defeat still stand the same. That's the kind of training God does to a man. The kind of training God does to a man. It's very strange to think that God would do that. God trains his men like that. But he does. You know, we have an old song. We sing some through the waters, some through the flood, some through deep trials, but all through the blood. God leads his people. So here it saints through great trials to purge them and sometime it take years to do it. This is not idle words. God leaves his people through great trials to purge them and sometime it take years to do it. As for myself tonight, I believe prophecy coming that right now God is training such men to meet the front line. Men who are going through and times shook from their feet. Sometimes it look like the whole thing is falling but yet in the midst of it they know that living God and keep their face forward, keep moving on. And many people praying for revival. I wonder if sometimes those that are praying, if their own prayers don't stop up the wells of blessing, they are cowardly, afraid to trust God, afraid to take him at his word, afraid to believe he still lives. The Bible says he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. Okay. Now said this here these virtues virtues has to be endear before the capstone will ever come on it. You might shout, you might sing, you might speak in tongues and dance. That has nothing to do with it. Until these things are scripturally proven and sealed into you, the Holy Spirit sees you as an individual, then you are son and daughter. Let my son go tonight that he may serve me. Jesus commission as we close according to Isaiah 51 was clear. Isaiah 51 said, "The spirit is upon me. This is like another Moses. This is like another deliverer coming forth. What for? It's upon me because the Lord has anointed me to preach, good tidings to the meek. He had sent me to do what? The ministry of Christ, to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty, freedom to the captives, to the opening of prison to them that are bound. to proclaim the acceptability of the Lord which is Jubilee and the day of vengeance of our God to comfort all that more. Let my son go that he may serve me. I wonder how much parents actually bind their children by what they say, by how they act, by what they do. When God in his burden tell Moses to tell Pharaoh, Israel is my firstborn, let him go. If you don't let him go, I will take your firstborn. All right. So, as we close, this is the final quote I have here. What a brand his presence in the individual with personal vindication of himself expressing himself the living word that's promised for the day expressing itself through you a vindication of the great revelation of God. Look here we go. This is a bomb only in an individual. Never in a group. an individual not in a group. His identification is with an individual. You get that? Say amen. Not with Methodists, not with Baptist, not with Presbyterian, not the Lutheran, not the Pentecostal, but as an individual. I want you to see tonight that brother Brandon said the Holy Ghost is poured out on individuals. I want you to see tonight that the veil that was rent from top to the bottom and Jesus died give you an individual under the song of my voice tonight direct access to shikina glory or presence he went on to say this I'll take one I'll leave one I'll separate them they'll be a field I'll take one I'll leave one there between a bed I'll take one and leave one it's not a group it's a personal vindication of a pregnantated child of God filled with the Holy Ghost so surrendered to God that he don't care about anything else and the Holy Spirit living its life while Satan through him showing personal vindication of the word itself expressing itself to the people and to the world. You know today I was thinking about a prison and how prison limits you and how Paul say I'm a prisoner of Jesus Christ. In a prison, you can't feel to go and stroll. You can't feel to go by the beach. You can't feel gushed a feeling for pizza. It does not exist. You are in a bind. You are in a holding bay. I realize that if God is to take us truly as prisoners, we can't do our own thing. We have got away a lot with our own thoughts, our own way and our own ideas because as human beings we supposed to be God's small G and because of that he give us the power of choice and decisions to choose. He know what way we will go. Israel as I close didn't know the ways of God. So Moses the commission was to bring them to this mountain that I may reveal or unveil myself to these people because in a family if we don't relate communicate connect the family will be on a strain. Family needs connection. Whether it's father, son, mother, daughter, brother, sister, brother, brother, sister, sister. That's what family connection is all about. This whole team of adoption, which is what this age is about. And spiritual maturity is not you just by yourself. It's just is you as part of a family, the family of God. And that is why we are members one of another in this glorious body of Christ. So God wanted to truly place us in this body by his spirit by a mighty deliverance and breakthrough. The call out of Egypt wasn't just to be called out was to be called out that he might serve me. Let go my son. I want you to plug into that word that God gave Moses to tell Pharaoh and begin to speak and pray for your family, for your children, for your loved ones, for your connections that this word may go out tonight. Let go my son that he may come and serve me. Let's bow our heads. Heavenly Father, it was such a glorious thing to see how you view Israel as a son and son carries so much with it. As a child, we are no different from a servant, though he be heir of all things, but is under tutors and governors until the time appointed by the father. And here in Hosea, I say, "When Israel was a child, I called my son out of Egypt." God the Bible say when I was a child I speak like a child understood as a child but when I become a man so childhood childish is just a stage a stage in which we grow we get stronger we get responsible we take on responsibility to come into true maturity and that is how you want us tonight to be solid to be established to be rooted to be grounded in the love of God that even though we are trapped died. Even though we are tested, even though we have battles, even though we have storms, we could weather them. We could hold true, we could find faith as bad eyes preach in a time of storm, we could find you to be faithful. We could find you to be trustworthy because you promised never to leave, never to forsake us. And Father God, as the people go in prayer tonight, may the anointing be with them in a special way. The sick touch them, the elderly touch them. Oh God, the weak touch them. May each one be encouraged. May they see that Jesus was released on the earth to set captive free, to open up prison bars, to heal the brokenhearted. There are people with broken hearts, bad experiences, and only you could heal them. Father, words cannot do it. But your love, your presence, your touch can do it. Lord, heal marriages, heal hurts, heal fears, heal past, heal sicknesses, heal disease, sickness of the flesh, sicknesses of the spirit, sicknesses of the soul. whatever condition, wherever the conditions are at, that you can release them from guilt, from the past, from their fears and bring them into the glorious liberty which is promised in this last day to the sons and daughters of God. You see us as individuals. You see us striving. You see us pressing. You see us fighting. You see us battling because the battle of angels have now become the battle of men. Help us tonight as we grow in prayer. As we press in prayer, as we believe you, oh God, for all things, have your way among your people tonight in their homes, wherever they are, may you visit them in a special way tonight. In Jesus name I ask it. Amen. Tell Pharaoh, release my son. God bless you as we ask that you get on in prayer at this time. Praise the Lord. Heat. Heat. Woo! Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat.

Father, we praise you. Father, we bless you. Father, we thank you. We thank you for your presence. We thank you for answering prayer. We thank you for hearing the cries of your people. We thank you for hearing and answering prayer. We thank you for confirming your word. We thank you for who you are, the Lord the redeemer, redeeming us from sin, from unbelief, everything that's contrary to your will in your word. Thank you, Father. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Lord, bless your saints tonight. Just want to say with you that share with you that the rapture is not a group group thing. Rapture is specific. There'll be two in a bed, one taken, one left. We don't die in a group. One by one we get the portals there to dwell with the immortals. One by one we enter in. And as an individual we have to fight for what we know is our own. You have to fight. You have to take great courage. And don't say you don't like confrontation. You cannot defeat what you're not prepared to confront. We have to confront our own selves. See yourself as a son. See yourself as God telling the devil, "Let my son go that he might serve me." See yourself being released from everything that has bound that you are going to be released because this is how God want you. Want you want you to be a free son, a liberated son, a son that is free from all hindrances that you could effectively serve the Lord. So at this time I want to bow uh let us bow our heads as we close in prayer. Heavenly Father, we thank you for your word. Lord, to see from the scriptures what you told Moses, what it tell Pharaoh, how you saw the children of Israel as son, as family, family that is in trouble, family that is in bondage, family that is bruised, battered, family that is depressed, but family that is pushed to call upon you. your son in trouble, your daughter in trouble, your children in trouble, and yet they are your children, and you want them to be free. God, may the people get it in their hearts tonight that your desire, your aim is not for children or family to be bound, but they be set free. The enemy have them, Lord, but your word come to free them, to loose them. That's what the anointing was released for. That is what Jesus declared. The spirit is upon me because he had anointed me to do these things. Your prophet saw some young men Lord tied up. Lord, some got freed, some broke out and some couldn't get broke out broke couldn't break out and you said house of hell give way to the name of Jesus Christ. And father God, may the authority come down, Lord, to speak that word, house of hell give way to the name of Jesus Christ. I commit your children into your hands, your people into your hands that they may see your promises, liberty, freedom, deliverance granted God in Jesus I ask it. Amen. God bless you. Looking forward to see you on Sunday. Come under great expectation, great faith, looking to see what the Lord will do. God bless you. We are dismissed tonight.
