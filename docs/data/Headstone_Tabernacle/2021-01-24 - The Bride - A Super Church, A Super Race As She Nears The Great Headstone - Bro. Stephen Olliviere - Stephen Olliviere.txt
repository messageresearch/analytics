message that is being unfolded to us lord each and every day lord even when we are not in the tabernacle you are working your way out in our lives lord in our situations in our trials in our testings it's it's that seed that's growing lord in the environment of what's taking place in the world there's a power in the sea to produce itself there's a life in the sea there's truth in the sea there's a power in the seed we thank you this morning lord that we can be in your divine presence that in your presence all things are possible lord we take every spirit on our control this morning for the honor and glory of almighty god we thank you for waking us up this morning we thank you for the breath that's on our lips father we have done nothing to deserve it we have done nothing to earn it lord but you're for knowledge lord looked into this time and you saw us and you saw us here worshiping and you saw us here receiving you saw us here accepting this great charge this challenge of the hour and you wrote names in that book lord names that cannot be removed lord because lord you saw them perfected you saw them adopted you saw them coming into maturity lord so may you bless your church this morning may you bless your people lord may you take complete control we commit the service into your hands in the precious name of jesus christ and the church says amen can we give the lord a hand of praise amen you may be seated for a few minutes amen it's a good thing to be in the house of the lord it's a good thing to be in the presence of the lord to break the hustle and the bustle of this system and to spend time you know focus on what's most important our eternal destination our eternal promises the divine promises of god and that by these promises we are partakers of his divine nature oh we have so much to thank god for our trials our testing our situations it's all design it's by design there is no accident with god you being here this morning is not by accident you being call is not by accident your frustrations are not by accident god is working his way out he can't help himself the seed in you can't help itself is designed to do a certain thing that seed in you is designed to accomplish a certain thing no word spoken by god is by accident hallelujah every seed will bring forth after its kind and thank god we didn't put the seed in our souls it was not our seed in the first place but he placed that seed in there and put the law in the sea to reproduce itself and to make possible what you didn't know was possible because there's a power in the seed and it's god working his way out it's like that lily that's pushing from under the muck and the maya that's going to push its way out no matter what you throw on top the lily the lily is designed to keep pressing oh so we come this morning to press to press past our feelings to press past the limitations of the world to press past what's happening all over the world there's darkness but that lily can't help herself but press so we are here at another service another opportunity another day of grace to press a little bit oh we are so grateful this morning amen so we thank the lord for all that

great mission of god this great purpose of god by design and we are we are finding ourselves in that purpose in that plan and realizing that there's more power in us than than we even realize and it's

little sermon is the bride a super church a super race as she nears the great headstone amen amen amen praise the lord amen and from the message the deity of jesus christ rama's speaking the church has been brought from the cradle pentecostal rocketed down yonder a few years ago back there while the people threw stones and made fun and laughtered her but she has grown to maturity now can we say amen it's about time the church grew to maturity amen hallelujah that's right the hour is here hallelujah that's what i'm interested in to see god's church coming together now amen hallelujah we've been beat out here and beat out there but the hour is coming when god is throwing the blanket around us all amen to draw us in hallelujah why for the enemy is at the gate can you see the enemy approaching amen can you see the enemy approaching hallelujah yes sir but thy seed shall possess the gate of the enemy shall possess this morning shall possess the gate of the enemy hallelujah glory to god amen brother by them says and now of his people you are his people amen daniel said the great things of the last days when these things come to pass all the prophecies the men of faith that's you amen say amen the people of god will do great exploits in that day can we say amen that's a prophecy amen hallelujah glory to god amen great exploits what do you mean i looked up the meaning of the word exploit and it says a bold or daring act an achievement that requires great courage skill or strength hallelujah in other words what i'm trying to say is that the ordinary people the average people cannot and will not do great exploits my i'm not talking about exploits now i'm talking about great exploits hallelujah the people that know their god the wise shall know their god and they shall do great exploits great exploits hallelujah oh glory to god amen hallelujah hallelujah these people are not ordinary they are extraordinary hallelujah their strength is not natural their power is not natural their wisdom is not intellectual come on now come on now hallelujah i'm talking about the last days daniel saw these people by vision it was a special people it was a chosen people but it was a powerful people hallelujah glory to god amen and that vision cannot fail because god cannot fail this morning amen amen and amen hallelujah oh glory to god amen hallelujah thank you jesus amen [Applause] who are these people and what is the source of their strength hallelujah from the message super sign brother the way he chose to show to come to show in this last day is god's super signs a super race you mean there will be a super race in the last day hallelujah yes sir what makes then a super race what makes a super race amen brother branham said because they got supernatural power hallelujah amen he said because they got supernatural power with supernatural signs through a supernatural belief in a supernatural word from a supernatural god he said you talk about super oh glory to god amen hallelujah super god amen glory to god glory to god amen it's a supernatural god in a natural people hallelujah amen amen yes it will be a super race give the lord a hand of praise amen thank you jesus amen amen amen amen question what differentiates the church from superchurch what differentiates the race from super race it's the supernatural it's the supernatural can we say amen we must have it we are hungry for it but i'm said i know john in every man's heart there's something that longs to see the supernatural hallelujah amen amen we need the power of god we need a supernatural do you want to this morning do you want to this morning amen listen the supernatural the power of god is the word made manifest hallelujah it's a word coming alive amen amen don't tell me about god that's good but i need god i need god that's what i'm hungry for i need him now hallelujah is that how you feel this morning do you need him now amen hallelujah hallelujah this gospel came to us not through word only but through the power and demonstration of the holy ghost can we say amen can we say amen and jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever give him praise give him praise this morning hallelujah hallelujah oh the days of miracles are not over that's not true praise god don't listen to the devil's line hallelujah hallelujah you can be healed every sickness has

your deliverance thank you lord hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to god amen thank you jesus oh blessed be the name of the lord blessed be the name of the lord all through the bible those things depended on the supernatural to survive and brother there's come in a time that if you don't have the supernatural with you the devil will cheer you to pieces paul i know i know but who are you where is the supernatural in your life you've got to have it the token must be on display man give the lord a hand of praise hallelujah hallelujah glory amen what is a mystery scripture previously hidden truth now they finally revealed but a supernatural element still remains despite the revelation the supernatural yes hallelujah oh may the supernatural element drop down today yes lord amen how many looking for that this morning hallelujah brave drop down today praise god amen and quicken that mystery of the pillar of fire returning back into the church that's a mystery amen yes lord amen hallelujah glory hallelujah amen the pillar of fire led the children of israel through the wilderness that same pillar fire struck down saul on his road to damascus and arrested him amen then he became paul glory moses met the pillar fire in the building bush and was changed forever hallelujah amen because when you do when you meet the pillar of fire when you have a divine encounter that personal supernatural experience you will never be the same again oh my hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh praise god brother bannon said no person has a right to call himself a christian until he has had an experience with god an experience with god amen my can i jolt you a little bit from israel and the church you say i don't go to dances i don't go to shows i don't smoke i don't curse i don't drink he said that's just moral stuff my moral stuff unless there has been a supernatural experience my amen amen not because you shouted not because you spoke with tongues not because you jumped up and down he said but something supernatural has happened in here that's changed you and you are sealed away in god in god hallelujah you're anchored that's right give the lord a hand of praise yes lord yes lord amen so don't stop until you have that raise your hands close your eyes and just call upon him this morning for a few minutes just call upon him this morning hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah call upon him this morning this is your service this is your day this is your time hallelujah praise god amen oh you called upon him this morning thank you jesus [Applause] oh blessed be the name of the lord we need a supernatural praise god praise god amen you may be seated still building a foundation for the message because it makes no sense i get into the super church just yet unless we are sure amen brother terence it is essential and absolutely compulsory that we meet the angel that we are baptized with the holy ghost and fire compulsory absolutely necessary amen praise god amen ah hallelujah the message the methodists thought that when they shouted they had it found out a lot of them didn't have it the pentecostal spoke in tongues and said we got it but many of them had nothing paul says though i speak for the tongues of men and angels and have not love it profits me nothing oh my so this is serious this is serious amen so the prophet says it's not a fleshly demonstration or emotion but something that happened in here that's changed your whole opinion you got a renewed mind amen it changed your nature hallelujah is that what you're looking for amen praise god he said christ has come into you and converted you amen your nature is dead in the old man and you're born again you're a new man oh praise god hallelujah thank you jesus thank you lord it must not be an impersonation because that wouldn't stand on the chest amen it must not be a make-believe it must be a supernatural birth a supernatural birth always a super race born by a supernatural birth can we say amen can we say amen said just as there was pain and groaning in the natural birth there will have to be the same thing in the spiritual booth birth amen give the lord a hand of praise give the lord a hand of praise a groaning and a travailing to be born and positionally born into manifestation hallelujah yes lord amen so impersonations will not face the challenge of the hour amen you must have the genuine baptism of the holy ghost can we say amen can we say amen this morning amen one more forgive me i just felt inspired to drive this in good first amen praise the lord don't leave this service without it sit on the edge of your seat brother jesus praise god amen be on the expectation ask god in your heart to visit you today a supernatural visitation amen or maybe the lord will work for you today amen maybe today is your day to be sealed away hallelujah grab a hold of every word press pass the song barrier forget who's next to you and reach out to him this morning give him praise give him praise give him praise sit at the edge of your seat praise god amen somebody's crying lord somebody needs you lord oh lord hallelujah thank you jesus oh praise god amen brethren says don't fall short of that without the baptism of the holy ghost you're lost and young people you won't have to worry about getting into heaven if there's nothing supernatural in here you say it one more time you won't have to worry about getting into heaven if there's nothing supernatural in here the doors can't unlock you could walk and pump your head against it but it won't open speaking about the heaven's doors amen he said but if the spirit of god the supernatural is in there the spirit of god will unhinge the doors hallelujah you've got to have that thing in here to unlock heaven's doors give the lord a shout hallelujah glory to god god to have that supernatural experience amen praise god so man of god through all the bible knew god by experiences in their everyday lives it was god with them walking with them fighting their battles getting small victories growing stronger from day to day confidence in god through experiences can we say amen yes lord look at david when the time came to fight goliath saul offered him soldiers apparel and weaponry david said no thank you let me use something that i know about hallelujah see god needs men in his army who know what they are talking about by experience praise god can we say amen praise god david said i have had an experience with this power that i'm speaking about amen my hallelujah glory to god one day at the back side of the desert i was hood in my sheep and a bear came and got one of my sheep and i used my slingshot and knocked him out and retrieved my sheep another time a lion came and i slew it with my slingshot now the god that delivered them out of my hand he did not say his slingshot but the god hallelujah hallelujah he said the god that delivered them out of my hand that god will much more deliver this uncircumcised philistine who is defying the armies of the living god into my hand oh praise god amen hallelujah hallelujah glory to god he knew for sure what he was talking about hallelujah praise god amen and if god delivered you from sin from a life of sin how much more will he deliver you from sickness this morning praise god hallelujah you that are sick he can make you whole will thou be made whole this morning praise god make your mind whole make your spirit make your body make your soul will thou be made whole this morning give the lord a hand of praise hallelujah he can change your nature and make you a new person again by a supernatural experience give the lord a hand to pray give the lord a hand of praise hallelujah hallelujah glory to god amen then king saul told david i admire your courage son but you are walking into your own death are you sure you can handle that giant are you sure you can handle a giant brother david took his little slingshot and five stones and while the army was trembling and while goliath was making fun of him f-a-i-t-h praise god he took his slingshot f-a-i-t-h and david brought the giant down hallelujah why he had an experience that he knew that god could deliver give the lord a hand of praise give the lord a hand of praise amen god can deliver god is a deliverer this morning god is a mighty deliverer hallelujah hallelujah yes lord amen thank you jesus oh those bible characters the three hebrew boys the experience they had with god was greater more real than that fiery fullness and when they got into the fire there was the supernatural a fourth man in the fire can we say amen praise god amen hallelujah daniel thrown into the lion's den the pillar fire stepped down the supernatural and stopped the mouth of the lions praise god amen can we say amen moses met the pillar fire and was ready to face pharaoh and all of egypt's mighty army praise god amen yes lord notice all these men became fearless and brave after they met the supernatural can we say amen so where do you think you are going without the supernatural today for what's coming ahead we must have it somebody say must we must have it we must have it and the bride will have it because it's a divine promise given by god it's given by god two wednesdays ago be perseverant for the promise of dynamics be persevering somebody be persevere and praise god for the promise of dynamics it's gonna come to pass because god spoke it and it shall be give the lord a hand of praise yes lord amen glory glory if no dynamics is coming then we are finished my we have all the words we have all the seeds but that supernatural element must drop down oh glory to god amen must drop down amen malachi 4 had it and we are going to have it give the lord a hand to pray we are going to have it amen malachi 4 how did amen praise god amen notice the dynamics of this world system through the world council of churches is rising we can see it day by day more clearly can we see it even at the other gates amen we are seeing an amen but what about the church glory to god brother branham said the dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the holy spirit hallelujah so don't play down the holy ghost we've got to be filled and refilled praise god that's our dynamics give the lord a hand of praise this morning give the lord a hand of praise glory to god amen the dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the holy spirit which we have worked in a small measure while the headstone is coming down to unite with the body give the lord a hand of praise amen glory amen so god is always ahead of the devil god is in control don't forget god is in control say that this morning do i ever forget that amen and god is looking down at his footstool dear and enjoying he's enjoying all the drama that is about to begin god is having pleasure he's enjoying the drama my god amen hallelujah he is looking at the devil making his moves thinking he has finally got the church backed up in a corner but brother beauty paul said poor devil [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah praise god but isaac he can't see the special agents [Applause] he can't see there's an army rising up that will break every chain break every chain break every chain are you in that army this morning are you in that army this morning give the lord praise hallelujah it's a super church a super race a super people praise god amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh may you be inspired today may your faith get anointed this morning amen hallelujah so satan looks and he sees the church backed up in a corner he says yes i have them now but he does not know that in the last days a true church bride will come to the headstone and she will be a super church a super race as she nears the great headstone give the lord a hand of praise he doesn't know that amen praise god so brother is like again divine strategy and the book of revelation from the bible study from the message revelation of jesus christ christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts we are supposed to produce another book of acts amen hallelujah and the book of revelation shows how the antichrist spirit would come into the church and they file it making it listen carefully lukewarm formal and powerless don't ever forget these three words the satan strategy to make you lukewarm formal and powerless my it is satan's tragedy you say lukewarm well you are in church but you're not in church [Applause] you're hot you're neither hot nor cool [Applause] amen that's the devil's strategy amen oh god formal you're just going through the motions and all the church traditions but the passion is not there you're coming to church because it's sunday you're not coming to church for the holy ghost there is no fervency there is no cry to get in the spirit praise god formal and powerless anything will lick you up you stop fighting you have given up you are weak and dying oh you wanna throwing your back into ladies here praise god i'm not talking about people in the world this is christian people now this is message people now i'm talking about satan wants to paralyze you satan once said destroy you praise god amen but as an individual as a family as a church this morning shake up yourself this morning stir up yourself this

know he says anything you pray for pray for those things pray for the holy ghost pray for your children you have a reason to pray you have a reason to talk to god you have a lot to ask god for and he said in his word we have not because we asked not so what will begin to happen if we begin to ask and we ask in earnest and we ask with a purpose and we ask with a revelation of what we should be asking for what will god do for us when the revival as we know is not based on the preacher but is based in our homes in our own activities in our own effort and as we have exhorted so many times before don't let it be that the bible study and the prayer meeting and the services is your only effort you have to have that personal your personal plan your personal prayer life your personal time with the scripture your personal time with the word of god so that when you are already in the spirit and you come to a bible study or you connect to a service or you're here on a sunday then it explodes in your soul because it's already bubbling on the inside is that is that you believe that this morning hallelujah hallelujah and uh and of course if it continues this sunday uh the last sunday of this month of january it feels like very eclipse we just broken the 2021 and we're talking about the last sunday of january and before you know january is finished in february and before you know it if the lord tarries we're closing out another year i'll be one year closer one month closer one day closer to leaving here and leaving here with the devil under our feet leaving here with our family back into the position they're supposed to be and leaving here with your joy wherever you left it you're picking it back up because the joy of the lord is your strength hallelujah they hear your loss you're picking it up too hallelujah and the pain you picked up you're putting it back down hallelujah all the bad feelings that this past house would have picked up over time he's had to
