to look at first Corinthians up to 10 100 watt 1 to 11 Ephesians chapter 1 on the word between verse 3 to 10 Thank You positions regions in Jesus name - you're welcome we tend to all those connected to us on the internet welcome you to Sunday morning worship fellowship unto God Daniel chapter 12 we have of one to four and at that time shall Michael stand up the Great Prince which standeth for the children of thy people under there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time and at that time thy people shall be delivered every one that shall be found written in the book many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake some to everlasting life and some to shame and everlasting contempt what did that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever but Thou O Daniel shut up the words and seal the book even to the time of the end many shall run to and fro knowledge shall be increased even from first Corinthians chapter 10 when I read from verse 1 moreover brethren I would not that ye should be ignorant how that all our fathers were under the cloud and all passed through the sea were all applies unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea did all eat the same spiritual meat did all drink the same spittle drink for the junk of that spiritual rock that followed him that rock was Christ but with many of them God was not well pleased for they were overthrown in the wilderness now these things were our examples to the intent we should not lust after evil things as they also lusted neither be idolaters as were some of them as it is written the people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play neither let us commit fornication as some of them committed and fell in one day three and twenty thousand neither let us tempt Christ some of them also tempted and were destroyed of the Serpent's neither murmur ye of them also murmured and were destroyed of the destroyer now all these things happen unto them for example and they are written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world come final scripture Ephesians chapter three one we want to read from verse 3 blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ God blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ according as he had chosen us in him before the foundation of the world I would be wholly without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of His grace where any admittance accepted in the beloved whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of His grace wherein he had a bond towards us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he had purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him may God bless his word you may be seated 11:00 this morning

manifestation of the sons of God that's the inspiration waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God in this scripture this inspiration is enormous it 19 it says for the illness expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the money of the sons of God and we amplified it says further even the whole creation all neat e'er waits expectantly and longs earnestly for God's sons to be made known it's waiting for the revealing or the disclosing of the Assumption that's not function that is sonship so the creation itself is waitin for the revealing or the unfolding of the Assumption or this is tremendous just imagine the whole creation is groaning for the manifestation of the sons of God when God will pulled the veil off of his son now these are sons of God not human not that natural people sons of God and sons of God expressed God - they became as his own is always even not but as many as received him to them he gave power to become the sons of God not that this not

talk but I'm talking that throwing up different cleansers the puddin of the seraphs idea to cleanse the worshiper hallelujah commit to being offering to God you want to offer some inner God he said before he could you offer it go to a brother and make it right look up a bigger bigger afraid offering and do you know what I never warned against a brother we're doing at all its faith virtue knowledge temperance patience garnish on the top rather be kindness that's the spirit of forgiveness that's the fullness the seven steps that's as far as you can go because the Spirit is calling himself to come down upon you hallelujah the Spirit of God descending like a dove you can operate that God does but you could get up on the seventh step that seven separate forgiveness that never suffers when you could talk your or and the whole not gotten excuses and blame somebody and somebody and somebody you still even don't down somewhere it's that idea you have to get out to that getting the real spirit of forgiveness look at Jesus you did Father forgive them they know not what they do and they won't crucify increasing on him what you would add and that yet curse them he has swear against them he stood us and forgive them did all you know what they're doing they don't know what the killers didn't know what they unfold inside idea they them to even know if they don't only understood he was on the lead years alone when he died shadows smart you believe some spirit no we are here and see that the whole I spot nothing nothing nothing with a stop the sons of God from coming forth in this hour if they what a Wolverine has grown and fall not have a nice shirt and nitrous members and so on and soothe anti-education good and for Oh hallelujah what was the rip the veil of who he is you wanna see who he is and I will be holding you will become like him let me see lady I was second on the room the banner God see enforce Ian Elijah's t1 numbered he had so long you could still hear it so long as everybody has got to put punches you can pass so don't worry what know what to find everybody has a good one go ahead knock on door you know Wes Anjali look and I'm an hour coming home so he's gonna have a success of Elijah when he did God call this man listen he wasn't a Nocera seminary when he called him he was plowing a field but a yoke of oxen the service taking care of his mother and father God called him to be the successor of Elijah Elijah perhaps many up at the school thought they were sure to do going to be his successor they weren't aware his role as soon as he was finished but God does the callin God does the chosen God does the electing and God does the second in order do you love him God are set in the church some apostles some prophets some teachers some evangelists and pastors God does that himself we cannot make one hair black or white neither can be added wanting to over stature by taking thought God in His infinite grace and by his election and foreknowledge sets these things in order and every real was just right I like that I would be a discouragement this morning is I didn't believe in the election and calling of God if I thought that this world was Lester the outcome of it by the power men and by the wisdom of man and by United Nations who never mentioned God's name I'd be discouraged person but I'm not looking at that for the outcome I looked at the pages of this old book here where God wrote it out and everything will come just exactly the way he said it so you're not looking for man for your outcome you don't give an uncle and Aunty and Pantheon this bishop and this ministers Association you don't look if attack for your outcome you look into the world for your outcome because once that word is spoken over you nothing under stop it oh he'll have to find a woman at a well you have to find back emails get a sign Peter and John Unchained all of them here to find them because the names was in that book and every name on the book shall be must be have to be delivered or give the Lord our show praise God for that after about a year the complexion you hide your color theory is where your country come from or the language you speak normative or the names on the book that time Michael sharp and up and every name from rippln that book [Applause] that's why the mighty enjoy killing with the buckle bug in Revelation 10 to call your name the seven thunders is what call your name that was twice your husband that was quite your husband that's your husband Remington 10 1 is your husband Remington 10 7 is your messenger or give the Lord a shout in the home your husband drop-down in Revelation 10 to call you with a shout it was the common on angel because he swore by himself what it is where that time shall be no longer even timers have runs out so we come into the full of the time when pilots have runs out that may be breaking his eternity making into the eight hair written is a holy convocation look at the lot some places people I misspelled with the ball to run out so what do you do with July time is about or huh remember there's only what you do for the kingdom is what comes what you're selfishly been living for your own self your own pleasure that ain't going for nothing that you're stinking rotten selfish being we're not talking about that well think eternal life

will be people of the Holy Ghost [Applause] all right let me Jesus know this word was cut through seven ages and going to send a message seven angels picada discovered words to tie it back into the world to bring the entire Holy Ghost and the progress of the entire Holy Ghost has visited the church that is what make looks something today the son of man in a sauna man so Jesus Christ on dealing a prophet which is the Holy Ghost itself I mean spoke word prophetic words spirit spoken words the coronoid a bride so when you ensure that you could be wherever the will ever find you that's why you interested a something inside of you it's what the would connect with or give the Lord our South in the house because it's spirit given word hallelujah that means is that word going out and me that wanted to catch you to pull you in the will you in because the word has you want to become the sons of God that's what power is given for that was the word was given for not to become a church member but for you to be a reproduction of God the church supposed to be an avenue in which you get connect back to your God they come like a cell phone ik activated here suppose in place where you get the activation then when you could call him for yourself not see some priests not to some bishops but you have your own line back to your father I want a number [Applause] but this part is incredible after the doors of the Gentiles exclus God would anoint a church then what does that mean that those of the Gentiles is closed Bible call the Jews the olive tree olive branch and God cut them off to put this while olive branch in called the Gentiles and the Bible talked about the times of the Gentiles until the fullness of the Gentiles come in so therefore the Gentiles have a specific train not a specific time but called the fullness of the Gentiles until the time the center come in so it means that when that time come in not one more name person would be seized so don't wait for the door to shut because no harder 120 years where people had an opportunity to receive it to receive the message then when goats are the telling oil is in time of your fullness of time has come so started getting emails in two by two people see that and total at work we do not have enough found inside earlier when they confronted or but after was go at the door seven days it talks had visions of doomed people the acts at recent the people who could not be seized oh yes whatever repeat again yes in church yes people have accomplished a turn here and table you see because they were already rejected you mean those people that was preaching to no fun for no yes for seven days until the rains out of all those people say no no I said no but the only problem is Noah didn't shut the door got it and what watch door what shut no man could open what God or man or God opened Noman good shot so when God the door the door shut Oh hallelujah so while you have a chance to make things right while you have a chance to be reconciled to God please do I could with my family to save the Lord you know I will have with no choice but I choose that I choose this is the hard way is now our way either smoke

henceforth his governor his ruler he's over all my heritage all I have belongs to him oh praise and that's the reason the coming of the seals at the finishing of the seventh seal the mystery of God to be finished to know who God is what he is how he lives his nature his being you are supposed to be all the way of death by that time to bring us into the full stature of the sons of God of God they come right back to the mystery of the seventh seal under little seven feet of seven thunders and he says we supposed to be all the way up here like that time or the imposed you suppose me in there spike that time what time to put this on time when the fullest sense of them is trained to see the manifestation of the sons of God we are weakened on it Oh glory to God hallelujah praise be to Jesus hallelujah seven seals but I wanna know for the endtime message this seal he reveal all these two kills but he don't see nothing about the seventh so the seventh seal is for the endtime essage first four seas history also fifty thousand reorder for steel be system and source acute earthquake 7c silence it does another one is seven seals but the end time seal when its acts will be a total secret only when it sucks but I was finishing we just went that you suppose we wait of the road now all faith and virtue and knowledge members at the finishing what it is for the top of the pyramid when the pyramid comes through stuff we are at the end time the opening of the seventh seal Oh glory to God so when he made man of God he give him a domain as a zoo domain goes from sea to sea from shore to shore he had control of it and Jesus came being the one without sin he proved it when the winds blow he said peace be still it was more than talk he proved it by my position isn't that right then he said if you see this long can be moved the dock you shall have what you said so go back to Genesis now the world and nature is growing moving for what for the manifestation of the sons of God when two sons born son third son speak and their word is back I believe under I started getting bored of it now see this mountain and brother desire and so I give it to you in the name of Jesus Christ oh praise God from future whom almost done now in Ephesians 1:10 you put the null is called the fullness of time it's called not the seven days called the fullness of time when the fullness of fame has come when time has been fulfilled when there is no more time then you go into eternity after the 72 Jesus over Luther's ages over Methodist is over many constellations over know you go into what eternity no more severance no more trees no more other the utility oh my god is where the fullest time is that give me a church or we said that oh praise God hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord

God Oh hallelujah praise God let the worshippers arise hallelujah and the only way okay jesus said that messages go to all the world then at the end shall be after this message both to all the world and the only way that God can preach the gospel city is true that lump of clay so God can physically to mechanical deep he had to preach it to his lungs are clean so men and that's the reason you see people have the right to come and say Lord Jesus if you only hear me know I'm gonna be a preacher I'll talk about it I'll do everything I can you edifying I'm one of the branches and so forth okay that's well as well for them in order to preach the gospel before you can make it a gospel preach you've got to have power and demonstration of the Holy Spirit to prove the gospel the letter killeth and it was a spirit make it alive so the gospel is truly the gospel when it is preached and power a demonstration could we all stand and give God some praise 'as as we wish it the Lord I'm balancing

conscience that the meeting is already blessed the convention is already it's already it's already blessed so we under great expectation for God to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we could ask or think and I want to encourage you Church back there when you read the Bible they told them one time when they didn't have green and it for on water for a long I am the Prophet - let me go dig a valley full of ditches because the rain is going to fall and how much water you get his directories tied to hold much ditches you take and how deep how deep you take it so if you dig a little bit you're gonna get a little bit of water but if you take many ditches and you dig it deep then God has more blessing than you could even fill David speaks of his running over so don't don't let me god this weekend don't let me go to your situation what be under expectation for your family for your loved ones for the promised revival because one of these days the Prophet said we'll be standing talking sitting and the love of God will just drop down in on this and I'm under expectation that this we think it'd be that kind of meeting is that how you feel so we are dismissed [Music] in addition those who are tied to the other aspects for the convention the transportation technical any other function and tie the dimension you also invited to the meeting with the Deacons a nauseous after service okay so the middle or best you a manatee very brief go on eleven today all of the your return gone email ashes remain to come you are all alone from before time you are on your throne
