[37:22] discern between the righteous and the
[37:25] wicked

[37:57] the hour the word for this season and
[37:59] time you have elected us to be here for
[38:02] such a time as this and I pray Lord that
[38:05] you would open up our understanding and
[38:08] open up the word to us that we could

[38:29] the um weather but God is good we still
[38:32] some soldiers here marching on Amen
[38:34] praise God okay so I have a title get
[38:39] ready to be positionally placed
[38:41] Hallelujah that's the title get ready to
[38:44] be positionally
[38:45] pleased have a subject to know who God
[38:48] is who you are and who the devil is and
[38:53] I have
[38:54] inspiration return and discern
[38:57] oh praise God return and deserve let's
[39:00] go as Daniel heard the seven Thunders
[39:02] and forbidden and John heard the voices
[39:05] and this book was sealed and the back of
[39:08] the book was sealed with Seven Seals but
[39:10] in the days of these seals to be open
[39:14] the mystery of God would be finished in
[39:17] other words so in other words he said
[39:19] the mystery of God will be finished and
[39:21] then he is interpreting it in other
[39:24] words God
[39:27] would be known to his church yes sir do
[39:30] you get that God would be known to his
[39:34] church not in three people but as one
[39:38] person the mystery of God would be
[39:42] revealed and when that was completely
[39:45] revealed he's still on the Revelation
[39:48] line now mysty of God been revealed and
[39:51] when that was completely
[39:53] revealed
[39:55] then the the seven Mysteries would open
[39:58] to the church so he's talking about the
[40:00] seven Mysteries which is seven
[40:02] Thunders okay and when that was
[40:05] completely revealed then the seven
[40:08] Mysteries will be open to the church
[40:10] because in dear the church would be
[40:13] living under the inspiration of the Holy
[40:17] Spirit and that's why he talk about
[40:19] divinely reveal mystery truths not just
[40:22] divinely reveal and then he said then
[40:25] the church should be living under the
[40:28] inspiration of the Holy Spirit him
[40:31] moving in and out showing his signs of
[40:35] being alive and among us living among us
[40:39] and we are then worshiping the living
[40:41] Christ that's Among Us so the promise is
[40:44] to have that super anointing that
[40:47] presence that person that being the
[40:49] angel right Among Us Oh Glory to God so
[40:52] you're no longer coming to church as a
[40:54] church just going to Fellowship in him
[40:55] you're going into an atmosphere you're
[40:57] going into a worship you're going into a
[40:59] spirit atmosphere when he can move in
[41:01] and out and then you know is the living
[41:03] Christ what did Brother Bram say after
[41:06] discernment he said you know what I'm
[41:07] waiting on is the angel I'm waiting on
[41:10] him all of a sudden he he is here that
[41:13] he is here we talking about that he have
[41:15] to be here oh give the Lord a praise
[41:18] glory to God you know we say where the
[41:20] twos and trees that gather he's the
[41:21] midst we could say in the midst of us
[41:23] two that's the word but we not talking
[41:25] about that just saying where the TOs and
[41:27] trees are gathered he in the midst and
[41:29] by faith you know he's in the midst we
[41:30] not talking about that we talking about
[41:32] what the prophet had there when he said
[41:34] he is here now he was with the prophet
[41:37] preaching the word the word is God he
[41:38] was there with the word he was there
[41:40] with the Revelation but when he come to
[41:42] the manifestation he is here is a
[41:44] different thing altogether he is here
[41:46] means I take every Spirit under my
[41:48] control for the glory of God because he
[41:50] is here not a devil move till I say so
[41:53] oh give the Lord some Praises do you
[41:56] understand what he is here we talking
[41:57] about now that over he is here that's
[42:00] the promise to be God what we made known
[42:03] to his church Oh Glory to God not just
[42:06] by the word but by the spirit and power
[42:09] God will be made known to the church
[42:11] making known is not only by Revelation
[42:13] the word written making known is also by
[42:16] manifestation oh give the Lord some
[42:18] Praises people keep emphasizing making
[42:21] known as making Mysteries known
[42:23] Revelations known thoughts known words
[42:25] known but God reveal himself in
[42:27] different ways by Nature by word by
[42:30] Power by presence is different ways he
[42:32] reveal himself but this he's talking
[42:34] about him moving Among Us not some
[42:37] Deacon not some Elder not some Pastor no
[42:40] him moving In and Out Among Us and then
[42:42] we are worshiping the living Christ oh
[42:45] give the Lord some Praises glory to God
[42:47] you believe that Hallelujah so what's
[42:51] this mystery of God to be revealed in
[42:53] the days of the voice of the seventh
[42:55] angel when he shall begin to sound the
[42:58] mystery of God should be finished as he
[43:00] ha declared what all this is about three
[43:03] things you got to know who God
[43:06] is oh praise God are you with me God
[43:09] sends a guide and God wants you to
[43:12] remember that his appointed guide we
[43:15] must remember him here it says Jesus
[43:17] said I will not leave you I'll pray the
[43:20] father he will send you another
[43:22] comforter and this comforter there's a
[43:24] slight Echo up here and this comforter
[43:27] when he was to come was to guide us to
[43:30] all truth and the word of God is the
[43:34] truth and the word is Christ I am the
[43:37] way the truth and the life he is the
[43:39] word in the beginning was the word and
[43:42] the Word was with God and the Word was
[43:44] God and the Word was made flesh and
[43:47] dwelt among us then if we follow the
[43:49] real true guide the Holy Spirit he was
[43:52] to tell us what he had seen what what he
[43:56] had heard and what he to show us things
[43:59] that is to come so the guide would show
[44:02] what was what is and which is to come
[44:04] there you are he's going to show you
[44:06] things to come and when the churches
[44:08] today reject that how can we ever expect
[44:11] to go to heaven when the Holy Spirit was
[44:13] sent to us for a guide who the Holy
[44:17] Spirit and we take some Cardinal some
[44:20] Bishop some general overseer or somebody
[44:23] like that to guide us when the Holy
[44:26] Spirit was given to us to guide us but
[44:29] it take a man to interpret what the
[44:31] prophet say and that becomes their guide
[44:33] they don't believe the message they
[44:34] believe the man Oh Glory they believe
[44:37] the prophet you know they believe the
[44:38] man behind the pulpit interpreting to
[44:40] them what the prophet say and they have
[44:42] eyes and ears like everybody else to
[44:43] read what the book say and the only way
[44:47] those disciples could said uh we have
[44:49] found them who say they Apostles and are
[44:51] not found them to be Liars the only way
[44:53] they could know that they know what Paul
[44:54] taught and because they know what Paul
[44:57] taught they got have watch them guys in
[44:58] the eyes and say you a liar because
[45:00] you're not saying what what Paul said Oh
[45:04] Glory to God do you believe that now and
[45:06] we coming right back to that if they
[45:08] can't say what the tape say or what the
[45:10] Paul said or what the prophet said they
[45:12] are liars because this is the original
[45:14] word oh give the Lord some Praises now
[45:17] watch this now and the Holy Spirit will
[45:21] always speaks of the word I've got many
[45:24] things to tell you you cannot understand
[45:26] it now but when he comes he will guide
[45:30] you to it then the prophet broke in
[45:33] that's the reason the coming of the
[45:36] seals at the finishing of the seven seal
[45:40] not the beginning at the finishing of
[45:42] the seven seal what the mystery of God
[45:47] should be finished to know who God Is
[45:53] Right what he is how he
[45:57] lives his
[45:59] nature his being you're supposed to be
[46:03] all the way up there by that time and he
[46:06] point up the pyramid up to brotherly
[46:08] kindness so in other words all these
[46:10] seals and Mysteries is not for
[46:12] information purposes Daniel said
[46:15] knowledge shall increase it's not for us
[46:16] to know information long time when you
[46:19] have encyclopedia you might one family
[46:21] in the whole village might have
[46:22] enyclopedia you want to know something
[46:24] you had to go and tell them and spin
[46:25] pages and to Mr Google and Mrs Google
[46:27] take over just punch it in the computer
[46:29] and then all the information come here
[46:31] well now you have YouTube you have every
[46:34] in you could make learn how to make a
[46:35] bum learn how to cook anything you want
[46:38] to do you can find it on the internet
[46:40] because knowledge shall increase and
[46:42] knowledge is total knowledge here now
[46:44] and as man release total knowledge God
[46:46] come with a prophet to release total
[46:48] knowledge oh glory to God but knowledge
[46:51] as information knowledge as Revelation
[46:53] and knowledge to come to the place to
[46:55] know who God is is so the knowledge is
[46:57] not just for information purposes the
[46:59] knowledge is to bring us to Revelation
[47:01] to know who God is and if you know who
[47:03] God is you'll behave yourself if you
[47:05] know who God is you will know he is Holy
[47:07] oh praise God praise God praise God
[47:09] praise God praise
[47:11] God GL Hallelujah his nature his being
[47:16] you're supposed to be all the way up
[47:17] there by that time see and bring us into
[47:20] the full stature of Sons and Daughters
[47:23] of God a church that is washed in the
[47:25] the blood of Christ that's bought
[47:27] without money is paid for by the blood
[47:28] of Jesus Christ praise God so who God is
[47:32] who you are and who the devil is isn't
[47:35] that right so we know we have to be born
[47:37] again going into a place of triy add
[47:40] Seven Virtues and then adopted and then
[47:43] being positionally place isn't that
[47:44] right so therefore the opening of the
[47:47] word is to reveal who God
[47:49] is think about it God was unveiled to
[47:53] the prophet but God had to be unveiled
[47:56] by the word he couldn't let us come by
[47:58] Pentecostal and and get back in spirit
[48:00] Spirit Spirit without the word because
[48:02] the word is God and the word come to
[48:03] produce character and the word come to
[48:06] form us into the word image the
[48:08] Pentecostal did not have the word image
[48:10] because they were in the womb so they
[48:12] didn't come for the tongues and gifts
[48:13] and so on so when the prophet came he
[48:15] came to bring the word now so God going
[48:17] to use the word in the bride not you the
[48:20] word in you not you the pyramid is in
[48:22] you because he come to build another
[48:24] house in you oh give the Lord a shout in
[48:27] the house in the Pentecost he used men
[48:30] he used Flesh and Blood he used gifted
[48:32] men but the person of the word was not
[48:35] there because the word come to the
[48:37] prophet and the prophet messeng did not
[48:39] yet come so God couldn't send real
[48:42] latain because the seed was not yet
[48:44] there in the
[48:45] ground Oh Glory to God but a shame could
[48:49] you give me something more here so watch
[48:51] this here
[48:54] now son of man Jesus Christ he was the S
[48:57] of the seed then Seven Ages Son of God
[49:02] Seven voices and then the prophecy was
[49:05] in the day of the son of man reveal so
[49:07] them seven voices of Son of God was
[49:09] gathered up and bring back into son of
[49:12] man oh glory to God a God send Prophet
[49:16] failing the son of man the S himself so
[49:19] what the prophet unveil was the so and
[49:21] the so come back the original seed to
[49:24] bring back original bread
[49:26] so that's why I'm Alpha and Omega seven
[49:29] voices gathered up Son of God come back
[49:32] son and Mory into son of man Oh Glory to
[49:36] to bring back seed to bring back Son of
[49:39] God again back into a bride seven voices
[49:43] seven spirits seven Thunders oh give the
[49:46] Lord a shout in the house oh give the
[49:49] Lord a shout in the house is who God is
[49:52] he's them seven spirits yes sir Oh Glory
[49:54] to God is is not right hallelujah
[49:57] hallelujah so I believe that's as the
[50:00] prophet said when the church finds his
[50:01] brotherly love when the church finds his
[50:02] Hool andc when the church Finds Its
[50:04] place in Christ it is three stages and
[50:07] three steps that we have to get to place
[50:09] in Christ Place in Christ is the
[50:11] destination the journey is to place in
[50:13] Christ the preparation is to getting a
[50:15] place in Christ before you even hit
[50:17] Rapture you have to get your place in
[50:19] Christ because to overcome going down
[50:21] the road now you have to know who God is
[50:23] you have to know who you are and you
[50:25] must know who that devil is which is the
[50:27] Rel religious spirits that fighting the
[50:30] bright spirit in the church oh give the
[50:32] Lord a shout is no man with no fork and
[50:35] no horn is religious Spirits coming
[50:38] against that prde oh give the Lord a
[50:41] shout do you see it now so three things
[50:43] have to involve before we could be
[50:46] placed positionally to know who God is
[50:49] that's what the word come to do unveil
[50:51] for for you to know who God is
[50:53] hallelujah God is not church people
[50:55] think think God is Pentecostal Baptist
[50:56] Methodist and today people believe
[50:58] people believe God is Tabernacles and
[51:01] and assemblies and so on God is not that
[51:03] you know that church God is the word oh
[51:06] give the Lord a shout
[51:09] hallelujah so the people that know their
[51:13] God yes sir or let's rephrase it the
[51:16] people who know who God is shall do
[51:19] great ex exploits Oh Glory to God so to
[51:24] know who God is that's not enough you
[51:26] have to know who you are yes
[51:31] sir Hallelujah and then you can have
[51:34] faith to do great exploits and if you
[51:36] know who God is and who you are you
[51:38] still need to know who the devil is
[51:40] because the devil come to destroy to
[51:42] track you to try to get you off the
[51:44] word oh my and remember and we read this
[51:48] I want to read it again Christ in the
[51:50] true church is a continuation of the
[51:52] book of Acts and the Book of Revelation
[51:54] reveals that the Antichrist Christ
[51:55] Spirit would come into the church this
[51:58] message amen and defile it and make it
[52:00] lukewarm formal and Powerless it exposes
[52:04] Satan revealing his Works isn't that
[52:06] right then he went on to say if the
[52:08] people that's you bride get a true
[52:11] revelation of the true churchu a
[52:13] revelation of it yes sir and what she is
[52:16] one two what she stands for that she can
[52:20] do the Greater
[52:22] Works she will be an invincible Army
[52:26] if you get if they get a true revelation
[52:28] of the two Spirits within the framework
[52:30] of the Christian church are we preaching
[52:31] it recently and by God's spirit discern
[52:35] and withstand the Antichrist Spirit
[52:36] Satan will be powerless before
[52:39] her if we don't
[52:41] discern Satan going to have his way we
[52:44] have to discern and withstand Oh Glory
[52:48] there so there's going to be a people
[52:49] that going to return and discern Oh
[52:51] Glory to God when God unlock your
[52:53] understanding and God open up the
[52:54] scriptures you're going return and
[52:55] discern and then you're going to get
[52:57] yourself in motion and understand it's
[53:00] not flesh and blood you're fighting
[53:01] against it's principalities and powers
[53:04] and spiritual wickedness trying to
[53:05] hinder you from coming into your place
[53:07] and position Oh Glory to God and going
[53:09] shake them Devils off and push them when
[53:12] it's supposed to belong amen praise God
[53:14] so Luke 24 amen God Jesus open the
[53:17] understanding to the scriptures he
[53:19] opened the word to them so he opened the
[53:21] seals I'll say this way of the Old
[53:23] Testament and give them a revelation of
[53:25] what their promises are in order to tell
[53:27] them go in the upper room so they had a
[53:29] clear understanding of who God is and
[53:32] who they are and what was promised and
[53:34] who the devil is isn't that right so
[53:35] Jesus unveiled the entire word to them
[53:38] they knew the word of God and that's why
[53:39] Peter when he Ste up from the upper room
[53:41] he said these people not drunk but this
[53:42] is that that the prophet Joel spake of
[53:45] in other words he was able to identify
[53:47] the Fulfillment of Prophecy Oh Glory to
[53:49] God he wasn't just saying we bringing a
[53:51] thought and bringing our inspiration he
[53:52] said this is that that the prophet spoke
[53:54] of and we going to come back to that
[53:56] same spot that identify this year is
[53:59] what the prophet William brandham spake
[54:01] of this is that oh glory to and if we
[54:03] don't have that yet we keep in this Oh
[54:06] Glory to God we keep in this prophecy we
[54:08] keep in Dynamics in the form of the
[54:09] spirit of Prophecy to prophesy again and

[54:13] glory to God Get Ready Get Ready Get
[54:16] ready you are going to be positionally
[54:18] placed there enough devils in hell to
[54:20] stop that positional placing it will
[54:22] start with the ministry and will go to
[54:23] everybody else in position you want that
[54:26] place you're going to get that place in
[54:27] Christ Oh Glory to God so before the
[54:31] spirit fell on them they had that a
[54:32] revelation by the punch Oh Glory to God
[54:35] he didn't just run them into the upper
[54:36] room he took them into a room and break
[54:39] the word and break the seals and break
[54:41] and open the understanding so there
[54:43] wasn't in the upper room with
[54:45] understanding there was in the upper
[54:46] room with Revelation oh give the Lord
[54:48] some Praises without understanding they
[54:50] were sad they were D out Jesus died
[54:53] Jesus gone and he had to rebuke them all
[54:55] fools and slow of heart but when the
[54:57] Revelation hit them with joy he was
[54:59] leaving and they said bye-bye we know

[56:15] great joy and they were praising and
[56:18] blessing God when they feel like when
[56:21] they on top the mountain know they
[56:23] continually because they had no
[56:26] religious spirits on them oh glory to

[57:24] God praise God praise God hallelujah do
[57:27] you believe that tonight so have got to
[57:29] know who you are isn't that right he
[57:31] this now and Satan my God makes it
[57:34] appealing sin is appealing and the enemy
[57:37] keeps finding to get a better bait he
[57:40] will trip a little more don't worry he
[57:42] will never make a completely naked but
[57:43] he be horrible s Satan keeps bringing
[57:46] sin in and that was the original sin but
[57:49] God doesn't have to do anything more to
[57:51] his to make it more appealing the only
[57:54] thing he has has to do is raise a
[57:55] standard of his own word against the
[57:58] enemy and the Bible said when the enemy
[58:00] come like a flood the spirit of God
[58:03] raised the standard against it and we
[58:04] read that scripture tonight here how the
[58:06] prophet interpretting it now what does
[58:08] he do he makes the word that he already
[58:11] said more positive you see the time is
[58:14] not yet the vision is long we have to
[58:17] wait but God raising a standing in your
[58:19] life by taking the same word you're hear
[58:21] in all these years and making it more
[58:23] positive Oh Glory to God thank you Lord
[58:26] Jesus oh give the Lord some Praises it's
[58:29] not like we a reached anywhere yet no we
[58:31] waiting on the
[58:33] promise we waiting on a promise well
[58:36] brother to you acting like if we reach
[58:38] nowh and you know where we
[58:40] are Wai on the promise waiting on the
[58:43] promise who reach let them Reach but I
[58:47] am waiting because God promised the Holy
[58:49] Ghost he promised Dynamics in the
[58:51] mechanics he promised Revival he
[58:54] promised these things things Hallelujah
[58:57] so let's read it again God doesn't have
[58:59] anything more to do to his to make it
[59:02] more appealing the only thing he has to
[59:04] do is just raise up a standard of his
[59:07] own word against the enemy and when the
[59:10] Bible said when the enemy come like a
[59:12] flood the spirit of God raises a
[59:13] standard against it what does he do he
[59:15] makes the word that he already said so I
[59:19] don't how to try to create no Revelation
[59:21] that you never hear before and your ears
[59:22] tingling tingling from more that we not
[59:24] coming with that the spirit the bride
[59:28] and the prophet says the same thing and
[59:31] what they say would have already been
[59:33] said in the word Oh Glory to God so this
[59:36] what prophet now God know what he said
[59:38] through the prophet so he taking the
[59:39] same what the prophet said and make it
[59:41] more positive is things we heard before
[59:44] I'm not preaching nothing in you you
[59:45] know it's the same message you
[59:48] know same
[59:50] message oh praise God praise God brother
[59:54] Bram from rising his son he said you if
[59:56] your spirit that's in you is reckoned
[59:58] dead and you Anointed with the life that
[1:00:00] was in Christ is upon you Romans 11 says
[1:00:04] if that spirit that raised up Christ
[1:00:05] from the dead Powers same he said now
[1:00:08] then that same Powers then the same
[1:00:10] beneficiaries that he had here on Earth
[1:00:13] from God he redeem you we redeem you a
[1:00:17] seed that was for known by God whose
[1:00:20] name was put on the Lamb's Book of Life

[1:00:25] and that the Gospel Light of this
[1:00:27] Resurrection the confirmation of the
[1:00:29] word how did we know he was the Christ
[1:00:31] because he proved what he talked about
[1:00:33] Sir How will I know the message of the
[1:00:35] hour God proves what he promised sir he
[1:00:38] talks about it that is identification
[1:00:41] and we are beneficiaries with him in the
[1:00:43] resurrection he proves what he talks
[1:00:45] about what he promised to do in Christ
[1:00:48] he proved it on the resurrection what he
[1:00:50] promised to do in Moses he proved it
[1:00:52] what he promised in the days of Enoch he
[1:00:53] proved it in all the days of the Apostle
[1:00:55] he proved it now in this day he proves
[1:00:58] what he said because they are part of
[1:01:01] that
[1:01:02] seed that was represented on the book of
[1:01:06] life that he came to redeem back to God
[1:01:09] again yes sir what a message so you are

[1:01:35] message only it can't be teaching only
[1:01:38] he said the quickening power has got to
[1:01:39] come to Quicken them out of these dead
[1:01:42] denominations we say dead Tabernacles we
[1:01:45] say dead churches we say dead groups in
[1:01:48] the message to Quicken them a power have
[1:01:50] to come to Quicken them out of these
[1:01:51] dead denominations and Creeds to a

[1:01:59] you the quickening
[1:02:02] power wasn't only in their soul it was

[1:02:30] their soul it was all over them not only
[1:02:35] the Dynamics come into Quicken but it
[1:02:37] quickened the mechanics which was their
[1:02:39] physical body it's only because the

[1:07:27] all right let's let's continue now now
[1:07:29] i' like to draw for a
[1:07:32] moment here is God God is the Eternal
[1:07:35] there's no one but him God he had
[1:07:39] attributes and this here represents the
[1:07:42] word the word of God which has made
[1:07:43] flesh and dwell Among Us in the person
[1:07:45] of Jesus now this is called the woman of
[1:07:48] the wells he's joined this is the priest
[1:07:51] Pharisee and here you see a open
[1:07:54] Blackboard means Grace and salvation now
[1:07:56] in the beginning was the word the word
[1:07:58] has made flesh and dwell among us three
[1:08:00] stages it was the attribute first was in
[1:08:04] God he Tau of himself as being human and
[1:08:07] that transmit him down to be Jesus now
[1:08:10] if you ever be dear you will what's
[1:08:12] going to be within him then for there's
[1:08:14] only one for eternal life that's God and
[1:08:17] you are to be part of God at the
[1:08:18] beginning not what you just chose down
[1:08:21] here he chose you he say oh all that the
[1:08:24] father has given me will come now look
[1:08:26] at this priest here we find his bottom
[1:08:28] part his back
[1:08:30] life his predestination back there is
[1:08:33] sinful here is held down here and this
[1:08:37] part in here that looks like the black
[1:08:40] board that represent his Purity he was a
[1:08:42] priest he was an honorable man so that
[1:08:45] is his front side that represented this
[1:08:49] he was a good man because you couldn't
[1:08:50] be a priest a bad man a bandit a rough
[1:08:52] dog guy in know be priest you see how it
[1:08:55] got it intellectual learning now this
[1:08:58] woman her first life up here she was a
[1:09:01] prostitute she was all mad up but way
[1:09:05] down in her I know when the Messiah
[1:09:08] cometh you see notice when Jesus came
[1:09:12] and manifested the
[1:09:14] word because the word discerned the
[1:09:17] torch that was in the heart St John 4:12
[1:09:21] what happened the priest with only
[1:09:24] intellectual learning it's the devil
[1:09:27] because that's what his denomination
[1:09:29] called it what did it do he had no
[1:09:32] representation so it blacked out but
[1:09:34] this little woman had nothing to present
[1:09:37] she was filthy and dirty as she could be
[1:09:43] but notice way down in her she got
[1:09:46] representation so we Oh Glory to God so
[1:09:50] she had representation by predestination
[1:09:54] do you understand that now the priest on
[1:09:57] Earth your jacket and tie looking nice
[1:10:00] and breaking scripture and breaking the
[1:10:01] bread and everything else but back life
[1:10:04] no representation he doesn't have the
[1:10:06] predestination the woman she's back in
[1:10:09] front filthy but she have
[1:10:12] representation Oh Glory to God do you
[1:10:14] see that now hallelujah
[1:10:17] hallelujah brother Bram question and
[1:10:20] answers here this now if we were saved
[1:10:24] before the foundation of of the world
[1:10:27] were we and later on were we Spirits
[1:10:30] then and he's breaking it up now yes sir
[1:10:34] Revelation 13:8 as the scripture read
[1:10:37] and you were saved and your name was put
[1:10:39] in the Lamb's Book of Life before the
[1:10:41] world was ever created and he quote
[1:10:44] Ephesians 1 that we we are blessing
[1:10:47] Spirit of blessing Heaven of Christ
[1:10:49] according as they has chosen Us in him
[1:10:51] before the foundation of the world that
[1:10:53] we should be holy and blame without him
[1:10:55] having predestinated us unto the
[1:10:57] adoption of children by Jesus Christ
[1:11:00] himself now in the Book of Revelation I
[1:11:01] got here 38 all that dwell on the earth
[1:11:05] whose
[1:11:06] names uh shall not are not written shall
[1:11:09] worship the Beast right next part of the
[1:11:11] question were we Spirits then no he this
[1:11:14] part we were nothing
[1:11:16] then but in God's mind we
[1:11:21] were and he spoke it amen and it
[1:11:24] materialized hallah Jesus was slain how
[1:11:28] many knows that the Bible is he was
[1:11:29] slain Christ was the lamb slain before
[1:11:31] the found of the world why God spoke it
[1:11:33] and when he spoke it it was good as
[1:11:36] finished when he saw
[1:11:38] me when he saw you before the foundation
[1:11:43] of the world we were only figurative in
[1:11:46] his
[1:11:47] mind then when we come to the world we
[1:11:50] were both man and woman male and female
[1:11:52] and he separated the feminine Spirit
[1:11:54] from the man and made a woman out of it
[1:11:56] and left the masculine spirit in a man
[1:11:59] so when you see a woman acting like a
[1:12:01] man something is wrong when you see a
[1:12:02] man acting like a I want something
[1:12:04] is wrong isn't that right but before the
[1:12:06] foundation of the world our
[1:12:08] names when the lamb was slain our names
[1:12:12] were put on the
[1:12:13] book when in God's own mind he foresaw
[1:12:17] us and predestinated Us by his for
[1:12:19] knowledge before the foundation of the
[1:12:21] world oh brother if that would make the
[1:12:23] church get up and run through the a
[1:12:26] think of it you are born again before
[1:12:29] the foundation of the world God put your
[1:12:31] name on the Lamb's Book of Life this is
[1:12:32] who you are you know this is connecting
[1:12:34] back who you are you know because Satan
[1:12:36] only come in the
[1:12:39] beginning but this identify you were
[1:12:41] before the beginning so you was before
[1:12:44] the devil was
[1:12:47] created you was before Lucifer before
[1:12:50] Satan before the world was formed you
[1:12:53] was in is
[1:12:55] thinking Glory Hallelujah so before the
[1:12:59] found of the world now this is real you
[1:13:01] know yes sir they not a subjective
[1:13:02] thought like a lecture or a University
[1:13:04] degree thing you God put your name on
[1:13:08] the Lamb's Book of Life and Christ
[1:13:12] died and sent the Holy Ghost here to
[1:13:16] call you to eat in the
[1:13:18] life you receive it he sealed you you
[1:13:23] are here till the day of your Redemption
[1:13:25] you talk about holding on it isn't do I
[1:13:27] hold on did he hold on it isn't what I
[1:13:30] done it's what he has done it isn't I
[1:13:33] quit smoking I quit lying I quit
[1:13:36] stealing is he died for me he took my
[1:13:40] spirit out of me and converted me into a
[1:13:43] new
[1:13:44] creature oh give the Lord some
[1:13:47] Praises
[1:13:49] Glory
[1:13:50] Hallelujah glory to God H so you're
[1:13:54] referring to that same scripture
[1:13:56] Revelation 13 okay the devil deceive all
[1:14:00] shout out all all except those who names
[1:14:04] in the book think of it before Jesus was
[1:14:07] born 4,000 years before he came on the
[1:14:09] earth several thousand years before you
[1:14:11] come on the earth Jesus and God man died
[1:14:13] for the sins of the world but the book
[1:14:15] of life was made and your name was put
[1:14:19] on that book of life before the
[1:14:20] foundation of the world he said that is
[1:14:22] Bible truth
[1:14:23] your name was ordained of God and placed
[1:14:26] on the book of life before the found of
[1:14:28] the world you were there in his
[1:14:30] attributes you don't remember it because
[1:14:33] you are just part of his life you are
[1:14:35] part of God when you become a son and
[1:14:37] daughter of God oh glory to God notice
[1:14:40] his attribute then the attribute was
[1:14:43] first God the thought the attribute all
[1:14:46] in one without being expressed and then

[1:14:51] the word so first the thought
[1:14:53] then the word then the word become flesh
[1:14:57] and S John one now in the beginning was

[1:15:10] beginning was fun of spirit it was
[1:15:14] Elohim in the beginning was the Loos but
[1:15:17] before the Loos was Elohim and Elohim
[1:15:20] was seven perfect Spirits the Loos was
[1:15:22] form into a Yony which is a word body
[1:15:25] which was Jesus Christ in the beginning

[1:15:34] flesh and dwell Among Us isn't that
[1:15:37] right before it was a word it was an
[1:15:38] attribute of thought then it was

[1:35:59] that God Vindicated to be true the
[1:36:02] predestinated is the only one that is

[1:36:10] predestinated is the only one that is
[1:36:12] considered Redemption people might be
[1:36:15] making like and think they are but the
[1:36:17] real Redemption is those that are
[1:36:19] predestinated because the word redeem is
[1:36:21] to bring back to redeem anything is to
[1:36:24] bring it back to its original place so
[1:36:26] when you say positionally place is the
[1:36:28] place you had before and you're finding

[1:37:02] a glorified State it's matured oh praise
[1:37:06] God hallelujah glory to God so God forew
[1:37:11] us that is for knowledge then God
[1:37:14] elected us and then God predestinated us
[1:37:18] and then God have a Destiny for us isn't
[1:37:20] that right right so God for knowledge
[1:37:23] praise God determines the election oh
[1:37:26] and the election of God Must Stand isn't

[1:37:30] knowledge when I look back to where I am
