[47:01] anymore Jesus
[47:03] only with themselves God
[47:11] bless I have a title this
[47:16] morning and there was a cloud that
[47:19] overshadowed them

[48:42] displayed got so
[48:45] excited all he could think
[48:48] about building three
[48:53] Tabernacle that was not the purose
[49:03] and God would let that idea
[49:07] drop
[49:22] before and a cloud
[49:28] of the
[49:29] CL tell
[49:31] them that there's no man in the picture

[53:30] this top of
[53:36] the
[53:39] overow out and
[53:42] prove the love of
[53:48] God because you can't even love God

[55:08] church some groups of
[55:12] people this Valley here needs a group of
[55:17] people every of the world needs a group
[55:22] of
[55:23] people that real loyalty

[55:34] Ghost you
[55:39] love when God really overshadows
[55:49] you up
[55:51] here on the
[55:53] mountain is not where
[55:57] we talk about building
[56:01] tab here we want the presence of
[56:06] God
[56:08] up because down
[56:11] there the challenges are
[56:14] waiting the epileptic
[56:17] man is
[56:20] waiting
[56:25] overshadow to
[56:30] speak faith will be
[56:33] displayed live
[56:38] voice it w just be talk
[56:43] about you simply have to have the
[56:46] reality of
[56:50] it
[56:52] Glory you we
[56:54] have acted
[56:58] we have
[57:01] tried and those disciples kept
[57:05] trying epileptic person was
[57:09] there kep trying and kept
[57:15] trying the hour had
[57:19] come when the Son of God walk down from
[57:22] Mount Transfiguration
[57:26] suffer with you brother nothing can kill
[57:31] this bring him
[57:35] here Satan
[57:38] out and the demon
[57:41] knew hold that
[57:49] guy in this
[57:51] bride and the red
[57:55] say and the redeem
[57:58] say Glory GL so always when the power of
[58:03] God comes
[58:04] in the walls that you built around
[58:11] you your denominational walls will
[58:15] crush will be known
[58:19] again is the same yesterday
[58:28] and he
[58:31] said Samson Samson wanted God's what
[58:35] manifested before that
[58:42] Jezebel come to the church again yeah he
[58:47] wasn't praying for a new
[58:51] order the word of God might again
[58:58] so you know people want
[59:01] power and really they don't know what
[59:05] power
[59:10] is they don't really know
[59:17] what the Way
[59:19] Up Is Down
[59:24] all not sometimes
[59:27] not when it suits
[59:29] me
[59:34] always if you want
[59:37] Power see how humble you
[59:43] can just
[59:45] get away from all your wly
[59:53] thinking and then you've got more power
[1:00:03] a big lot of
[1:00:06] noise because you
[1:00:09] been
[1:00:14] yourself and I cannot conquer
[1:00:17] you until I conquer myself
[1:00:27] so God gave us a
[1:00:36] message something that will shape us
[1:00:42] up like a brother said want some kind of
[1:00:45] quality
[1:00:47] control that won't just be any kind of
[1:00:49] character
[1:00:57] somebody say amen amen Jesus was an
[1:01:03] embodiment of
[1:01:09] character so young
[1:01:13] people you are a
[1:01:17] challenger walk out of this meeting at
[1:01:19] the end
[1:01:21] of Sunday
[1:01:35] you're not going to see yourself as
[1:01:37] somebody that
[1:01:40] cannot you're going to see
[1:01:43] somebody that
[1:01:46] is
[1:01:49] overshadowed by
[1:01:52] God and you are going out with l o v
[1:02:00] e the only thing that can make it in
[1:02:06] there perfect
[1:02:12] love I can't go ahead and hate
[1:02:19] you that's not
[1:02:23] true and
[1:02:30] I mean he told the people he
[1:02:34] met that had passed on I God I preached
[1:02:38] what
[1:02:43] Paul well of
[1:02:52] that it's got to be what Paul preached
[1:03:01] it's got to be fitted
[1:03:04] back in the
[1:03:09] word somebody say amen amen so if
[1:03:13] brother Braham preach
[1:03:16] what and we are preaching what brother
[1:03:19] Braham
[1:03:21] preach we are also resting on
[1:03:26] that we are going
[1:03:28] to no way we can fail
[1:03:34] as somebody
[1:03:37] say
[1:03:39] Amen let me read a quote here from
[1:03:47] ad paragraph
[1:03:51] e32 now as we are coming right down
[1:03:57] how many I I believe this woman here
[1:03:59] raised her
[1:04:01] hand she studied the
[1:04:04] pyramids you know the pyamid never was
[1:04:10] capped and they
[1:04:12] rejected the
[1:04:14] headst the builders were
[1:04:21] building this one will throw it this way
[1:04:23] it doesn't
[1:04:28] this one will be pick it up it
[1:04:42] this that they had to start looking for
[1:04:44] that
[1:04:51] stone and we cannot make
[1:04:54] it without that
[1:05:01] stone so the stor that the build has
[1:05:05] rejected has become The Headstone of
[1:05:09] the this is the Lord's
[1:05:12] doing and it's
[1:05:14] marvelous in
[1:05:16] our and the people of God
[1:05:19] saying over here say something let's
[1:05:22] give a hand of praise
[1:05:33] that's why the pyramid was never
[1:05:37] CT but he left an
[1:05:40] opening that no other Stone could fill
[1:05:49] up amen amen this journey will
[1:05:54] finish and what you do for Jesus Christ
[1:05:57] is not in
[1:06:02] vain don't you ever give
[1:06:05] up Beauty
[1:06:07] calls whether you are
[1:06:09] sick whether you are tired whe the
[1:06:13] circumstances are
[1:06:16] not Lord your reps for
[1:06:23] Duty God has no other hand
[1:06:26] but your
[1:06:28] hands God has no other legs but your
[1:06:32] legs God has no other
[1:06:35] mouth final voice to the final
[1:06:39] age somebody say
[1:06:42] Amen somebody say
[1:06:45] Amen you are the
[1:06:49] gospel and the gospel didn't come in
[1:06:54] words so you will leave this meeting to
[1:06:57] go and
[1:07:04] demonstrate come on
[1:07:06] sisters come on
[1:07:11] Brothers remember that you are
[1:07:15] overshadow by
[1:07:19] God and that's
[1:07:22] something
[1:07:24] something that's no
[1:07:29] man and he has a
[1:07:32] purpose so this voice
[1:07:35] interrupt everything they were trying to
[1:07:39] fix so let's go on and finish our
[1:07:43] quote you know the
[1:07:47] pyamid never did have a cstone put
[1:07:52] on couldn't even find
[1:07:58] but it was there in the first place just
[1:08:01] that the thought it
[1:08:13] was building is almost
[1:08:19] completed we don't want the building
[1:08:23] shaking can you say Amen
[1:08:26] amen there wouldn't be many put in
[1:08:32] there you
[1:08:35] do let that perfect
[1:08:39] love be in your
[1:08:45] heart amen amen they don't know whatever
[1:08:50] happened to it
[1:08:52] why put on it
[1:08:55] Stone top of because he was
[1:09:00] rejected when he
[1:09:06] come it will
[1:09:11] be we are resting on
[1:09:14] this it will
[1:09:19] be that's
[1:09:21] right and then those stones
[1:09:25] that fit around The
[1:09:28] Headstone have to be stones that will be
[1:09:31] so completely
[1:09:38] like the pyramid is so
[1:09:41] perfect you can't run a razor
[1:09:46] blade where them Stones go
[1:09:50] together
[1:09:52] merary of
[1:10:04] this will be
[1:10:08] achieved Satan
[1:10:11] cannot
[1:10:14] so seed of
[1:10:18] discrepancy into
[1:10:23] this this is original
[1:10:27] seed spoken word is the
[1:10:40] or and would you have this Malachi four
[1:10:49] seed so keep pressing on
[1:10:56] getting
[1:11:04] narrower
[1:11:07] God will confirm his
[1:11:14] word quote the Seal of the
[1:11:18] Antichrist Los Angeles California
[1:11:21] California um 1955 March 11
[1:11:27] because that we

[1:14:39] evil amen
[1:14:43] amen braham's yearning was how these
[1:14:46] walls could be broken
[1:14:56] and instead of breaking them
[1:14:58] down are multiplying
[1:15:03] them so God has to step in on the
[1:15:08] scene by overshadowing
[1:15:11] you and said this is not
[1:15:23] the
[1:15:53] e
[1:16:23] e

[1:21:11] himself and
[1:21:13] God out of the
[1:21:18] picture but man wants to be recognized
[1:21:24] and John said from
[1:21:27] now I must
[1:21:32] decrease and he must
[1:21:37] increase can we willingly
[1:21:40] stay
[1:21:43] down while we keep lifting

[1:22:15] disappointments in
[1:22:19] tiredness I'm not hearing you
[1:22:30] and Braham said see so we base it all
[1:22:35] upon wrong
[1:22:38] thing
[1:22:40] B solidly upon thought sayth the
[1:22:45] Lord upon the
[1:22:52] word will
[1:23:01] so
[1:23:05] um talking about a condescending
[1:23:10] God coming down

[1:23:15] love with his
[1:23:17] creatures and that Jehovah God that
[1:23:20] created all those things
[1:23:26] in the heart of
[1:23:32] you before he did
[1:23:34] that he had to clean his
[1:23:39] road to
[1:23:45] show then he had to come down and show
[1:23:50] them
[1:23:52] love and then break his way right in the
[1:23:56] heart of
[1:23:59] man is in
[1:24:02] us that's
[1:24:04] right now we are his
[1:24:12] hands we are his
[1:24:14] eyes
[1:24:18] on we are his gospel on
[1:24:22] earth and the gospel is not Al together
