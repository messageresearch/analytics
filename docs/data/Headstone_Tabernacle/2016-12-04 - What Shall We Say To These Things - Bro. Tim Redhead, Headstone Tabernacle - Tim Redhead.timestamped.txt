[17:46] is God alone this morning. Beside him,
[17:49] there's none else this morning. Oh,
[17:52] blessed be the name of the
[17:55] Lord. We do have a praise and some
[17:58] prayer
[18:02] requests from Sister Kzia Clark. I would
[18:04] like to thank the saints for their
[18:06] prayers of faith. On my last visit to my
[18:09] doctor, my blood count, my blood count
[18:11] is now above 10 and ultrasound results
[18:13] are now normal and surgery has been
[18:15] cancelled. Glory to
[18:17] God. He's in the surgery cancellation
[18:21] business. It doesn't matter what the
[18:23] doctor says, what the result says, he's
[18:26] able to do anything. He's able to heal
[18:29] you this morning. We are back to
[18:32] apostolic times. As Peter yet spake
[18:34] these words, the Holy Ghost pours out
[18:37] this morning. You could be healed this
[18:40] morning. You will be healed. This
[18:42] morning you shall be healed. You shall
[18:44] be delivered. That's the time we're
[18:47] living in. Can the church say
[18:48] amen? Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[18:52] And we have two prayer requests that God
[18:55] will turn to two notes of praises as
[18:57] well. I'm requesting prayer for severe
[19:00] pain that I'm experiencing from sister
[19:02] Sandra and from brother Popwell for Miss
[19:05] Annard Winsor a pinched nerve and aic
[19:08] condition also unable to get out of bed
[19:10] and move around normally. Can we bow our
[19:12] heads for a word of prayer? Heavenly
[19:14] Father, Lord, we are so grateful this
[19:16] morning to be in your house of God. And
[19:17] Father, your word declares that no man
[19:19] can come unless the Father draws,
[19:21] Father. And Lord, we know the pull, the
[19:24] pull that we felt this morning to bring
[19:25] us into the house of God, Father, with a
[19:28] sacrifice of praise, Father. And Lord,
[19:31] we know that healing is a children's
[19:32] bread. And this morning, we Lord, bring
[19:34] these two requests before you for Lord,
[19:37] for Sister Sandra with the pain in her
[19:38] body. We Lord speak a word right now
[19:41] Lord that even now you would touch her
[19:43] from the crown of her head to the soles
[19:45] of her feet and may she be completely
[19:47] healed of every condition every pain
[19:50] Satan the blood of Jesus is against you.
[19:52] We bind the works of darkness this
[19:54] morning Lord and for Mrs. And it winds
[19:56] all Lord may you reach out to her right
[19:58] now with this pinched nerve the arrithic
[20:01] condition Lord not able to walk around
[20:03] normally Father it was not this way from
[20:06] the beginning we are not destined to be
[20:08] bedridden we are not promised to be sick
[20:11] so we speak a word of healing to her
[20:13] this morning Lord not just for her body
[20:16] Lord for but for her soul father may she
[20:18] have a supernatural experience with the
[20:21] angel of the Lord and now as we prepare
[20:23] for hear the word this morning father
[20:25] May you anoint your speaker that would
[20:27] bring the word this morning. Lord, may
[20:29] you speak to your hearts, Lord. Lord,
[20:31] may you bless those that are here. Bless
[20:33] those that are yet on their way. Bless
[20:34] those that are connected on the
[20:36] internet. Bless those that would hear
[20:37] the tape, Lord. When this service is
[20:39] over, may the sick be healed, Lord. May
[20:42] you deliver the backsliders, Lord. May
[20:44] you break the bands of wickedness. Lord,
[20:46] those that may be depressed, may you
[20:47] raise them up. Uh those that may be
[20:49] weary, Lord. May you lift them up. Lord,
[20:52] I don't believe you brought us this far
[20:54] to leave us, Father. Lord, we commit the
[20:56] service into your hands. We pray a
[20:58] special blessing on our pastor this
[21:00] morning that you would touch him from
[21:01] the crown of his head to the soles of
[21:03] his feet. The enemy tried to attack him,
[21:06] but Satan, the blood of Jesus is against
[21:08] you. You have no place in this househ.
[21:11] You have no place here this morning.
[21:13] This is the house of God. And there are
[21:15] sons and daughters of God in the house
[21:17] this morning who know their position,
[21:19] who know their promise, who know their
[21:22] inheritance, who know where they come
[21:24] from, who know where they are going.
[21:26] Lord, may you anoint your man's servant
[21:28] with a red hand. Lord, may the Holy
[21:30] Ghost drop down and speak spirit spoken
[21:33] words to your people this
[21:35] morning. We commit the service into your
[21:38] hands in the precious name of Jesus
[21:40] Christ. And the church says, "Amen." You
[21:43] may be seated.
[21:45] Are you happy to be in the house of the
[21:46] Lord this morning? Amen. Certainly want
[21:49] to welcome you to our Sunday morning
[21:51] service. Special welcome to brother and
[21:53] sister Adams. Invited by sister Ingred
[21:56] Williams. Where they at? Welcome.
[21:58] Welcome to Headstone Tabernacle this
[22:00] morning. Amen. God bless you. So good to
[22:02] have you. Well, this morning we have a
[22:05] treat for you this morning. coming all
[22:08] the way from
[22:11] Grenada, a real genuine servant of God.
[22:15] And one thing I love about Berhead, he
[22:17] tells it like it is because we know the
[22:20] truth is what will set you free. So I
[22:24] told him before you at home so he has
[22:26] every liberty this morning because we
[22:28] are one body and we could be in this
[22:31] country and that country but we are one
[22:33] body and all in this whole body no part
[22:35] of the body leaving the other part
[22:37] behind. So we all have to be built up to
[22:39] move as one to speak as one in one mind
[22:43] in one accord under one headship the
[22:45] headship of the Lord Jesus Christ. We
[22:48] have one headquarters and that
[22:49] headquarters is the Holy Ghost. So I
[22:51] believe this morning he is anointed and
[22:54] commissioned by the same boss of bosses,
[22:56] the same king of kings, the lord of
[22:58] lords, the alpha and omega, the
[23:00] beginning and the end, the rose of
[23:02] sharon, the lily of the valley to bring
[23:04] a word to the church this morning. So be
[23:07] under great expectation because all over
[23:10] the world the spirit is
[23:12] moving all over the world. Let's dance
[23:16] to our feet. The spirit is moving. Oh,
[23:21] all over the world. Oh, as the prophet
[23:25] said, it would be
[23:27] hallelujah. All over the world. Oh,
[23:31] there's a mighty
[23:33] revelation of the coming of the
[23:37] Lord as the waters cover the sea. Oh,
[23:41] sing it all over the world of brother
[23:45] Tim Spirit.
[24:11] Amen.
[24:14] God bless you.
[24:18] With your permission. Good morning. Good
[24:20] morning. I want you to sing this little
[24:22] song for me. With your

[25:06] me. Hear the sound from
[25:10] heaven. Yeah. That's the sound of many
[25:15] waters. It's the sound of
[25:18] worship coming from the
[25:21] throne. Oh, I love that. We have cries
[25:24] of adoration. There are cries of
[25:27] adoration. As men from every nation, as
[25:30] men from every nation lift their voices
[25:34] in one accord. Lift their

[29:20] on

[29:30] Jesus is the
[29:33] sweetest
[29:35] name I know. You can't go in his
[29:39] presence without
[29:40] worship. And he's just the same.
[29:47] as his lovely
[29:52] name. And that's the reason
[29:57] why I
[29:59] love him
[30:03] so
[30:05] Jesus is the
[30:09] sweetest name.
[30:13] [Music]

[31:09] hallelujah. I always love when he
[31:13] comes. If I come, nothing happens.
[31:18] And when you come, nothing happens. But
[31:22] when he comes,
[31:25] a lot of things happen.
[31:27] And our coming this
[31:31] morning would have been no value if he's
[31:35] not here. And Jesus
[31:37] is very
[31:40] sensitive. He doesn't just come in. You
[31:43] have to want him.
[31:47] And you have to make them feel welcome.
[31:50] Hallelujah.
[31:52] And it begins with a
[31:55] song. Probably want to hear the message.
[31:59] But I want to hear from him so that you
[32:01] can hear the message.
[32:03] So I must first get him here. He says,
[32:06] "Where two or three are gathered
[32:08] together in my name, there I am in the
[32:11] midst." But there's another part that
[32:13] says to bless. Hallelujah. I want that
[32:16] kind of blessing.
[32:19] So if you could just close your eyes as
[32:21] they play
[32:22] softly.
[32:26] Amazing
[32:29] grace, how sweet. And then when he drops
[32:33] down, you'll know the
[32:37] sound that save. I can feel his
[32:41] presence. a
[32:44] rest like
[32:48] me. Just trust
[32:50] softly. I
[32:54] want once was
[32:58] lost, but
[33:02] now I'm
[33:04] found. Was
[33:06] blind. Was blind. Yes, Lord.
[33:11] But
[33:14] now I
[33:17] see it was grace. It was grace. It was
[33:23] grace. Was grace that tore that
[33:27] tore my heart my
[33:32] heart to
[33:36] fear and grief.
[33:40] my
[33:43] first
[33:48] be. How precious, how
[33:55] precious
[33:58] is that great?
[34:04] The
[34:06] hour. The
[34:09] hour. Our
[34:12] first
[34:17] be.
[34:19] We walk in the
[34:25] light. The
[34:29] beautiful life.
[34:33] Come
[34:34] where the true
[34:38] drops of
[34:42] mercies are
[34:44] bright.
[34:46] Oh, shine
[34:49] all around
[34:52] us by day
[34:55] and by
[34:59] now.
[35:02] Jesus the light
[35:06] of the world. One more
[35:08] time.
[35:10] We walk in the
[35:15] light. Somebody the
[35:20] beautiful light. Glory.
[35:27] Somewhere the true
[35:30] drops of
[35:33] mercies a bright
[35:38] home shine
[35:40] on a
[35:43] rock by
[35:47] day by night.
[35:51] Jesus,
[35:52] Jesus,
[35:54] Jesus, the light
[35:57] of the
[36:01] world.
[36:03] Jesus, the light
[36:06] of the
[36:10] world. Let's pray.
[36:13] Almighty
[36:14] [Music]
[36:17] God as the brothers play softly only
[36:20] believe. Let's pray. Heavenly
[36:24] Father, oh we thank you for being in
[36:27] this place.
[36:30] We thank you for your
[36:32] presence that is so always
[36:35] available when we take
[36:36] [Music]
[36:38] time and we ask thee, oh God, that you
[36:41] will just make your presence
[36:44] real. Settle our
[36:46] hearts. Help us, oh God, to just focus
[36:51] on
[36:52] you cuz you mean everything this
[36:55] morning. Oh, we need you, Lord.
[37:01] How I need
[37:05] thee. Without you,
[37:07] Lord, where would we be? You're the
[37:10] reason we
[37:13] hang. It's because you live, because you
[37:16] died, and because you was buried and
[37:18] rose again, we have a
[37:21] hope, oh
[37:22] [Music]
[37:24] God. And we are mocked.
[37:28] We are
[37:29] marked. We are marked by your blood and
[37:33] by your
[37:35] spirit and we are yours. To live is to
[37:40] love
[37:42] you. And to love you makes us want to
[37:46] live. And that's why we are here this
[37:49] morning. And so I pray that you will
[37:52] just do what you do best.
[37:55] Come and bring that love, bring that
[37:59] sweetness, bring that inspiration, bring
[38:02] that presence, Lord, we need you,
[38:06] Lord. We living in a dying
[38:09] world and you're the only one that has
[38:13] life. You're the only one
[38:17] power. And then you said, "The spirit
[38:20] that raised Christ from the dead, if it
[38:22] should be in me, if it should be in
[38:25] them, that same spirit that raised
[38:27] Christ from the dead shall be in me a
[38:29] spirit of
[38:31] resurrection. I know all men have to
[38:34] die, but Lord, what about the rising?"
[38:37] And so, Father, I'm here is serious
[38:39] business, but it is good
[38:42] business. And it's also a love affair.
[38:45] And so I'm asking you, Lord, just to
[38:47] take charge. I'm praying, oh God, that
[38:49] you will speak to our
[38:51] hearts. We are one in your
[38:54] presence. I'm not a Grenadian. I'm a
[38:57] child of
[38:59] God. They are not Trinidadians. They are
[39:01] children of God. And we belong to a
[39:05] kingdom whose ruler and baker is God.
[39:10] And so we use that moment Lord and that
[39:14] we have invited you and we speak and we
[39:16] say Satan the Lord Jesus Christ rebuke
[39:19] [Music]
[39:20] you. You have nothing we
[39:23] want and we don't want your presence
[39:27] here. So we rebuke you. We cast you out
[39:29] in the name of Jesus. May all unbelief
[39:32] be
[39:34] broken. May every spirit Lord of fear be
[39:37] broken.
[39:38] Every spirit of sickness be broken. All
[39:41] those things you use to bind and to
[39:44] challenge and to try God's people, we
[39:47] come against it in the name of Jesus
[39:50] Christ. And I pray, oh God, that your
[39:53] sweet presence would flow through this
[39:55] place. I say, house of hell, back
[39:59] off. House of hell, give
[40:02] way. For we are conscious of your
[40:05] devices. And so, Father God, just bless
[40:08] your people. Let the Holy Spirit take up
[40:11] their rightful positions in the north
[40:13] and the south, in the bench, in the
[40:15] pews. Let the angels come around and
[40:18] help us, Lord, and bless us, Lord. And
[40:22] in the end, we will give you the praise,
[40:24] the honor, and the glory. And remember
[40:26] me, remember your servant brother T,
[40:29] Lord. Prayer has already gone up. Let
[40:32] the healing come
[40:34] now. We thank you, Lord. I thank you for
[40:37] being here. Bless us now. We pray in
[40:40] Jesus precious name. And all the people
[40:43] says and all God's people shout
[40:47] and all God's people shout
[40:49] amen. Turn around and greet your
[40:51] brother. Greet your sister in the name
[40:54] of the Lord.
[40:55] [Music]
[41:05] God bless you. You can have your
[41:10] seat. Well, I'm happy to be here this
[41:15] morning in
[41:23] Trinidad and I greet my brother and
[41:27] friend. There's a lot of brothers but
[41:29] not many
[41:31] friends. A friend is different. I know
[41:34] you can have brothers and they go their
[41:35] way, you go your way, but a friend goes
[41:38] with your heart.
[41:44] And I don't have many friends. I have a
[41:47] lot of brothers. I have a lot of
[41:49] sisters, but I don't have many
[41:51] friends. And brother Theo is one of my
[41:58] friends. And it's not that I don't have
[42:00] many friends because I'm not friendly.
[42:03] It's just that I don't have any friends
[42:04] because where I am is in the back side
[42:06] of the desert. Nobody comes
[42:08] [Music]
[42:10] there. So, we are kind of like Abraham
[42:12] and Sarah in the back in the back way in
[42:14] the back. And I'm glad to be here
[42:17] in you call it um Headstone Tabernacle.
[42:22] And I want you to know that you have a
[42:25] wonderful brother as our pastor.
[42:36] I usually when you have a little jam,
[42:39] you know, there's somebody you usually
[42:40] would call. I'm talking about besides
[42:42] Jesus. Jesus you always
[42:45] call, but I'm talking about somebody,
[42:48] you know, like you and brother and
[42:52] brother McMillio are the two friends I
[42:54] have. Like I always tell them, nobody
[42:57] remembers us in Grenada.
[42:59] In fact, I was telling Bertio coming up
[43:01] that I've never been in a
[43:03] convention. Never. Not even once. And
[43:06] the closest I've ever come
[43:08] is way back in I think it was 2000. I
[43:13] was sitting in New York church and
[43:16] brother Coleman was
[43:17] preaching and he told me pointed me said
[43:20] stand to your
[43:22] feet and I want you to take the word
[43:24] back to
[43:26] Grenada. Now, I'm not talking about a
[43:29] Coleman. I'm talking about what
[43:30] happened.
[43:32] Amen.
[43:34] And when I went back
[43:38] home, I got real thirsty for God.
[43:44] And sin, you get thirsty and not doing
[43:46] something about it is not the same.
[43:50] And I got real thirsty for God. And
[43:52] then, well, I guess you wouldn't mind if
[43:55] I tell you I had a
[43:59] dream. Now, I don't know about you, but
[44:02] God ministered to me by dreams. And I'm
[44:05] saying that without shame because it's
[44:08] real. It's true. And if you ask anybody
[44:10] at home, they will tell you many of
[44:12] times he stopped me and spoke to me and
[44:16] directed me. My coming here, I believe
[44:19] is of God. Amen. Amen.
[44:22] And so in the dream I was riding a
[44:25] horse. No, I was in a cave and I went
[44:29] into this cave with this horse. The
[44:31] horse was bare back. And when I went
[44:33] into the cave, I met the pillar of
[44:35] fire and the pillow fire was just
[44:38] burning
[44:39] and and from that time when I left I was
[44:43] riding bear back and since that time my
[44:46] life has never been the same.
[44:50] Never. I was some years
[44:54] ago and then
[44:57] God give me something. You can call it
[45:00] the Holy Ghost. A lot of people have the
[45:02] Holy Ghost and they don't know. A lot of
[45:05] people think they have the Holy Ghost
[45:06] and they don't have it. But whatever it
[45:08] is he gave me, that's what's keeping me
[45:11] alive.
[45:12] [Applause]
[45:14] And
[45:15] so I've never been the same. And God has
[45:18] just been leading me and helping me cuz
[45:21] in Grenada we have six churches in the
[45:24] message. And um in the past we used to
[45:28] be kind of Ivan brought us together and
[45:31] then after Ivan left, they
[45:36] left. We shared wood and food and
[45:39] everything with Ivan. But as soon as he
[45:41] was as as soon as Ivan left and the
[45:43] memory of Ivan left, everybody went back
[45:45] to their place. And within recent times,
[45:48] cuz I always try to keep in touch with
[45:49] the ministers because they read the
[45:51] books I read
[45:54] and they follow the same prophet I
[45:55] follow. Yes. And whatever their failings
[45:59] are, that's that's them and God. That's
[46:01] not my portfolio.
[46:04] My portfolio is to take care of what God
[46:06] give me. Amen. So I'm not I don't want
[46:08] to prejudge them or prejudice them. So I
[46:12] try to reach out to them. All of them.
[46:14] Even those that I know in my heart needs
[46:18] more help than the rest, I still try to
[46:21] reach out to them cuz it's better to
[46:23] have somebody standing and everybody
[46:25] sitting. And at the end of the day,
[46:29] recently we were told your congregation
[46:32] is no longer welcome because there's
[46:33] make too much
[46:36] noise. But I called the the pastor. We
[46:39] still talk. I the same pastor that told
[46:42] me that because before we go we usually
[46:44] ask
[46:45] permission and he said no brother Tim
[46:48] you can't come up now the reason why I
[46:51] call is because his member works with my
[46:55] members and he saw something in them
[46:57] that they didn't have and he wanted them
[46:59] to come up and give them what we had
[47:02] that they didn't have. So when we were
[47:04] going up, he said, "No, you can't come.
[47:05] It's it's just not possible. Too much
[47:10] noise." So, but I still call him and
[47:12] still fellowship with him. So, it's
[47:15] different in Grenada. So, it's like
[47:18] we're on our own just with Jesus. Amen.
[47:22] And um this is the first time I'm being
[47:25] here on a Sunday morning. So, bear with
[47:28] me. I'm not as eloquent as you. I watch
[47:31] your convention. We have ministers from
[47:32] around the world. Remember where I'm
[47:34] from? The back side of the desert. So,
[47:37] so don't put me in that category.
[47:38] Remember, I'm just a little low country
[47:40] preacher. But I love the Lord.
[47:44] I love the You love the Lord.
[47:50] Let's see. You really love the Lord. Let
[47:52] me see your hands. I love the Lord.
[47:56] Amen. Well, let me see. Now, love is
[47:59] supposed to be something that involves
[48:01] communication. Ain't that right? And if
[48:05] you love a girl or you love someone, you
[48:07] call them all the time. I remember when
[48:10] I met my wife, I would be by her house,
[48:13] leave 2:00 in the morning, and I reach
[48:15] home, I call
[48:16] again. And then I'll be sleeping, and
[48:18] then I'll call around
[48:20] 5. And then I'll call around
[48:23] 8. But you just call me. Yeah, I just
[48:26] checking.
[48:29] So we always talking but that's when you
[48:30] love someone and then re I realized she
[48:33] too far away. I need you to come here
[48:36] and that's when I got married.
[48:38] So love involves communication. Amen.
[48:40] And you said just now you love the Lord.
[48:43] Now you have 24 hours in the day and you
[48:46] can divide 24 into three eights. You
[48:49] have 8 hours work that's for yourself
[48:53] and you have 8 hours sleep.
[48:55] The next eight hours, how many times you
[48:57] talk to God?
[48:59] All right. You said you love him. Now,
[49:04] don't get angry because love is a doing
[49:06] word.
[49:08] It's what you do. It's not what you say.
[49:11] That's right. See, it's easy to talk.
[49:13] Talk cheap. You don't have to pay for
[49:15] talk.
[49:17] But it costs you to do the walk.
[49:21] And so out of the eight that's
[49:24] available, I challenge you. Would you
[49:26] give him 15 minutes?
[49:29] Maybe 10 minutes. I don't know.
[49:32] Eight. You know, I'm saying eight.
[49:34] That's like 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8. How much do
[49:39] you give him out of that eight? I'm not
[49:42] talking about your sleep and I'm not
[49:44] talking about your work. Come on now.
[49:46] Out of the eight. Amen. What do you give
[49:49] him? And then if you could find if you
[49:52] could find
[49:54] three, you're not doing too bad.
[49:57] If you could find four, temperature
[50:00] rising.
[50:02] If you could find five, ah, we are
[50:05] brothers.
[50:07] Where are we now? What number should I
[50:08] go? 1 to 10. Where am
[50:12] I? And I'm just telling you that because
[50:14] I notice when I come to Trinidad where
[50:16] I'm living, she's busy all the time.
[50:19] gets up early walk walk and I said to
[50:23] Engineer we take our time we just
[50:27] like I mean it's amazing what they get
[50:30] done so I'm like this is probably the
[50:32] spirit
[50:34] here and then where is the time for God
[50:37] and the strength of a congregation that
[50:40] serves God is their time their time
[50:43] alone with God
[50:47] you can have 15
[50:49] conventions. But how much do you have
[50:51] with God? Amen. Amen. And a convention
[50:55] is a prayer with God. I'm a firm
[50:57] believer in prayer. Amen. I started
[51:00] preaching. I just talking to you because
[51:01] we got to know one another first before
[51:03] we can preach.
[51:06] Are you following me?
[51:09] And when you could answer that, then you
[51:11] would know if you love God. Now you
[51:13] might say, I like God.
[51:18] Now you heard brother Isaac he told you
[51:21] I speak the truth and that's one problem
[51:23] I have. I cannot help but tell you as it
[51:26] is. I rather be a drunkard and a vagrant
[51:31] than be a hypocrite.
[51:35] So I can only tell you what he puts in
[51:37] me and you can't blame me because he
[51:38] puts in You can be angry with a drunk
[51:41] man. He
[51:43] drunk. You could crowd at him, but he's
[51:45] still drunk. You could get vexed, but
[51:48] he's still drunk. And there's nothing
[51:49] you could do. He's drunk. And when he
[51:52] wakes up, he's going to drink again. And
[51:54] until he gets rid of that taste, of that
[51:56] pull,
[51:58] you had to work with him.
[52:02] Are you following me? So, what's in you
[52:04] this morning? God, send me from Grenada
[52:07] to you. What do I tell you this morning?
[52:10] Amen. Are you Did you come to hear me or
[52:13] did you come to hear him?
[52:15] Now, if you came to hear him, you need
[52:18] another air.
[52:21] Not this one.
[52:23] You need the air in the spirit. Now, how
[52:26] you going to get here in the spirit if
[52:28] you don't even have a prayer?
[52:33] So, I may not be invited after this,
[52:38] but at least invited. I told you the
[52:40] truth.
[52:48] Amen.
[52:50] So from today after I'm gone, long after
[52:53] I'm gone, and you may forget me by 2:00
[52:55] this
[52:56] afternoon, remember this. How much time,
[53:00] quality time do I spend with God? I'm
[53:02] not talking about prayer that you
[53:05] know. I'm talking about things you're
[53:07] never accustomed telling him. the deep
[53:09] things, the things that we can't see.
[53:12] I'm not talking about adultery.
[53:13] Everybody knows what adultery is, but
[53:15] everybody don't know why it's malice.
[53:19] Cuz we can't see malice. We could see
[53:21] the effects of adultery. I could be
[53:23] angry with you and you never know. Young
[53:25] men that walk with brother Brennham, hug
[53:27] him up, and brother Brenam because of
[53:28] his gift knew that their thoughts were
[53:32] not what their hands were doing.
[53:35] Amen.
[53:37] One time, brother Brennham was in a
[53:39] meeting and he was in the back and they
[53:42] had a shelter
[53:44] area and the leader of the convention
[53:47] came and he said, "We are so sorry that
[53:50] brother Brandham is not here with us
[53:52] tonight. He had to attend to a sick
[53:56] person." Brother Brandon was right there
[53:58] and we're so sorry that he wouldn't be
[54:00] here with us tonight but hopefully the
[54:02] next time he will come. And brother
[54:03] Brandham was sitting right there and
[54:06] brother Brisll was also there and
[54:09] brother Brisll was like but look at
[54:11] brother Brandham
[54:13] there. Brother Brham is right there and
[54:17] they didn't call him cuz they had their
[54:19] reasons. So brother Briscoll went to
[54:21] brother Brham afterwards. He said why
[54:23] didn't you walk out and say here I am.
[54:25] Why didn't you walk on and say God bless
[54:28] I'm
[54:30] here? You say I would have done that.
[54:33] Brother Bam look at brother Biscal said
[54:35] I could never do
[54:37] that. I can never do that. So you
[54:41] understand what I'm saying now? So
[54:42] there's a difference in
[54:45] people and your spirit identifies your
[54:48] character. Amen. So now that I got your
[54:51] attention, let's go to the word.
[54:57] And our first reading is from Matthew 5.
[55:05] Now, this is not your regular service.
[55:08] This is not your regular
[55:10] message. This is the deep things that we
[55:14] want to go into here. It's not the
[55:16] popular stuff, but it's the stuff that
[55:19] will stay with you. Amen.
[55:22] Matthew 5.
[55:25] These words are direct from God himself.
[55:30] So it's not even Paul's words. It's
[55:32] Jesus own words. And God don't waste
[55:36] words.
[55:37] What he says he means. He don't even
[55:40] look back to see what's wrong. What's
[55:42] what you are doing about it. He says it
[55:44] and he's that's it. So let's read what
[55:47] he said and may the Lord bless the word
[55:50] real well.
[55:52] Reading from
[55:54] verse
[55:56] three. Blessed father bless the word as
[56:00] we read. Are the poor in spirit for
[56:02] theirs is the kingdom of
[56:04] heaven. Blessed are they that mourn for
[56:08] they shall be
[56:09] comforted. Blessed are the meek for they
[56:12] shall inherit the earth. Blessed are
[56:16] they which do hunger and thirst after
[56:19] righteousness, for they shall be filled.
[56:23] Blessed are the merciful, for they shall
[56:26] obtain
[56:28] mercy. Blessed are the pure in heart,
[56:31] for they shall see
[56:34] God. Blessed are peacemakers, for they
[56:37] shall be called the children of God.
[56:41] Blessed are they which are persecuted
[56:43] for righteousness sake, for theirs is
[56:45] the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are ye
[56:48] when men shall revile
[56:51] you and persecute you and shall say all
[56:56] manner of evil against you falsely for
[57:00] my sake. Rejoice. Don't get vexed. Don't
[57:04] get upset. Don't retaliate.
[57:07] Rejoice and be exceedingly glad for
[57:12] great is your reward in heaven. That's
[57:14] if you do this. That's that's if you
[57:17] rejoice. For so persecuted they the
[57:20] prophets which were before you. Then we
[57:24] go on to verse
[57:28] 37. And this is the
[57:30] killer. But let your communication be
[57:33] yay and yay, nay and nay. For whatsoever
[57:36] is more than these cometh of evil. You
[57:38] have heard that it had been said, an eye
[57:40] for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth. But
[57:42] I say unto you that you resist not evil.
[57:45] But whosoever shall smite thee on the
[57:47] right cheek, turn to him the other also.
[57:49] And if any man shall sue you at the law,
[57:52] and take away thy coat, let him have thy
[57:54] cloak also. And whosoever shall compel
[57:57] thee to go a mile, go with him a twain.
[57:59] Give to him that acet thee, and from him
[58:01] that would borrow of thee, turn not
[58:03] away. You have heard that it has been
[58:06] said, "Thou shalt love thy neighbor and
[58:08] hate thy enemy. But I say unto you, love
[58:12] your enemies, bless them that curse you,
[58:16] do good to them that hate you, and pray
[58:19] for them which despitefully use you and
[58:22] persecute you, that you may be the
[58:25] children of your father, which is in
[58:27] heaven. For he maketh the sun to rise on
[58:31] the evil and on the good, and sends rain
[58:34] on the just and on the unjust. For if
[58:37] you love them which love you, what
[58:40] reward have he? Do not even the
[58:43] publicans the same? And if you salute
[58:46] your brethren only, what do you more
[58:49] than others? Do not even the publicans
[58:53] so here's the word now. Be ye therefore
[58:59] perfect. Even
[59:02] Jesus, even that's a powerful word. As
[59:07] your father which is in heaven is
[59:11] perfect. You say bre is that possible.
[59:14] Amen. Jesus said it. And he was speaking
[59:18] to us. And he is saying that is in you.
[59:22] That is in me.
[59:24] But it is
[59:26] unconditional that you truly have
[59:29] something in you to be able to do
[59:31] this. Let's go to the next reading.
[59:34] Romans chapter 8. And I'm reading like
[59:38] this because I had to prepare for the
[59:40] how the brothers have to take it in
[59:44] the in the technology and all this stuff
[59:48] which is new first time I have to do
[59:50] this but I
[59:54] comply. So
[59:56] verse chapter
[1:00:00] 8 reading from verse one. I hope I gave
[1:00:03] it to you. There is therefore now no
[1:00:06] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[1:00:08] Jesus who walk not after the flesh but
[1:00:11] after the spirit. For the law of the
[1:00:13] spirit of life in Christ Jesus had made
[1:00:16] me free from the law of sin and
[1:00:19] death. For what the law could not do in
[1:00:22] that it was weak through the flesh. God
[1:00:24] sending his own son in the likeness of
[1:00:27] sinful flesh and for sin condemn sin in
[1:00:30] the flesh that the righteousness of the
[1:00:32] law might be fulfilled in us who walk
[1:00:35] not after the flesh but after the
[1:00:38] spirit. For they that are after the
[1:00:40] flesh do mind the things of the flesh,
[1:00:42] but they that are after the spirit the
[1:00:44] things of the spirit. For to be carnally
[1:00:46] minded is death, but to be spiritually
[1:00:48] minded is life and peace. Then we go to
[1:00:51] verse 17.
[1:00:53] And if children, then hes of God and
[1:00:57] joint hes with Christ. If so be that you
[1:01:00] suffer with him, that you may be also
[1:01:03] glorified together. Remember Matthew
[1:01:06] 5. For I reckon that the suffering of
[1:01:09] this present time are not worthy to be
[1:01:11] compared with the glory which shall be
[1:01:13] revealed in us. For the earnest
[1:01:15] expectation of the creature waited for
[1:01:17] the manifestation of the sons of God.
[1:01:21] For the creature was made subject to
[1:01:22] vanity, not willingly, but by reason of
[1:01:25] him who had subjected the same in hope.
[1:01:28] Because the creature itself also shall
[1:01:31] be delivered from the bondage of
[1:01:32] corruption into the glorious liberty of
[1:01:35] the children of God. For we know that
[1:01:37] the whole creation groanth and travail
[1:01:40] and pain together until now. And not
[1:01:42] only they, but ourselves also which have
[1:01:45] the first fruit of the spirit. Even we
[1:01:47] ourselves grown within ourselves waiting
[1:01:49] for the adoption to with the redemption
[1:01:52] of our
[1:01:54] bodies.
[1:01:56] I'll I'll pause there for now on that
[1:01:59] scripture and go straight to Revelation
[1:02:02] so that you can begin your seat. Let's
[1:02:04] go to Revelations chapter
[1:02:10] 6. May the Lord bless the word. And I
[1:02:13] saw when the lamb opened one of the
[1:02:14] seals, and I heard as it were the noise
[1:02:17] of thunder, and one of the four beast,
[1:02:19] saying, "Come and see." And I saw, and
[1:02:21] behold, a white horse, and he that sat
[1:02:22] on him had a bow, and a crown was given
[1:02:24] to him, and he went forth conquering and
[1:02:26] to conquer. And when he had opened the
[1:02:28] second seal, I heard the second beast,
[1:02:29] say, "Come and see." And there went out
[1:02:32] another horse that was red, and power
[1:02:34] was given to him that sat there on to
[1:02:36] take peace from the earth, and that they
[1:02:37] should kill one another. And there was
[1:02:39] given unto him a great sword. And when
[1:02:41] he had opened the third seal, I heard
[1:02:42] the third beast saying, "Come and see."
[1:02:44] And I beheld a no a black horse. And he
[1:02:47] that had sat on him had a pair of
[1:02:48] balances in his hand. And I heard a
[1:02:50] voice in the midst of the four piece
[1:02:52] saying, "A measure of wheat for a penny,
[1:02:54] and three measures of barley for a
[1:02:55] penny, and see hurt not the oil and
[1:02:58] wine." May the Lord bless the word. You
[1:03:00] can have your
[1:03:02] seat. And with your permission, I'll
[1:03:05] relieve myself from the top coat.
[1:03:12] And brother Isaac said, "I'm home."
[1:03:18] Mystic. You don't want me to be
[1:03:25] home.
[1:03:27] Anyhow, this morning we want to talk
[1:03:29] about a little portion of scripture that
[1:03:31] I didn't read yet and it's found
[1:03:38] in 31 of the same Romans. I didn't read
[1:03:41] it yet because I was waiting and it I'll
[1:03:44] take it from 28. And we know that all
[1:03:47] things work together for the good to
[1:03:48] them that love God to them who are
[1:03:51] called according to his purpose. For
[1:03:53] whom he did for know he also did
[1:03:54] predestinate to be conformed to the
[1:03:56] image of his son that he might be the
[1:03:59] firstborn among many brethren. Moreover,
[1:04:01] whom he did predestinate them he also
[1:04:04] called and whom he called them he also
[1:04:06] justified and whom he justified them he
[1:04:09] also
[1:04:10] glorified. Not who you call not who I
[1:04:13] call but who he calls. And God don't
[1:04:16] make mistake when he calls.
[1:04:19] Are you hearing me? God don't make a
[1:04:21] mistake and say Steve oh I meant John
[1:04:26] that don't happen you can't be saved now
[1:04:28] and then lost it when God calls you it's
[1:04:31] a call it's permanent
[1:04:36] God who knows all things you think you
[1:04:37] wouldn't know who to call
[1:04:39] oh by the way um rejoice with me my
[1:04:42] daughter is
[1:04:44] here Zoe just stand for
[1:04:49] [Applause]
[1:04:52] I call her Zoe and my father called her
[1:04:55] Joy. So her name was Zoe Joy but she she
[1:04:57] she changed it to
[1:05:00] Zoe. All right. So whom God called. You
[1:05:03] understand what I'm saying now. Whom God
[1:05:05] called. Not who you call. Not that you
[1:05:07] felt a little fizzle and you felt a
[1:05:09] little dizzle. I'm saying whom he
[1:05:11] called. Amen. And if God call you, I'm
[1:05:14] telling you, you're going to know.
[1:05:18] This is not auntie. This is not John.
[1:05:20] This is not uncle. This is God whom he
[1:05:24] called.
[1:05:26] This is not your pastor. I'm not even
[1:05:28] brother. God bless him. This is God. Who
[1:05:32] called me? Who called you?
[1:05:36] [Applause]
[1:05:38] Cuz if you're not sure, you won't stay.
[1:05:42] Those who he call, they stay.
[1:05:48] [Music]
[1:05:48] [Applause]
[1:05:57] Amen. Every once in a while you'll
[1:05:59] excuse me. I have to baptize the truth.
[1:06:02] So who he call, they stay. I love when
[1:06:06] God calls.
[1:06:07] Hallelujah. One time he said, "Samuel,
[1:06:10] come on now." And Samuel ran to Eli. He
[1:06:13] said, "Did you call me?
[1:06:16] And Samuel probably had a little
[1:06:18] wine. He said, "No, son. I didn't call
[1:06:21] you." He went back. He said, "Go back
[1:06:23] and lie down." And then he called again,
[1:06:26] "Samuel, and I love God. God don't call
[1:06:28] and then keep talking until he gets your
[1:06:30] attention."
[1:06:32] That's why he kept calling. See, see, we
[1:06:35] say, "John, I want you to go down the
[1:06:37] road without even a response."
[1:06:42] And then when they don't go, you angry.
[1:06:45] You first have to get a response and
[1:06:47] affirmation.
[1:06:49] Come on. When God said Samuel, Samuel
[1:06:52] had an answer.
[1:06:54] And God had patience.
[1:06:57] Come on. He has all the time.
[1:07:03] So he
[1:07:04] waited cuz he came for a purpose. When
[1:07:08] the angel come to you for a purpose, you
[1:07:10] don't go back until it's fulfilled.
[1:07:15] when he said the third time after the
[1:07:17] Eli because Eli don't even know what's
[1:07:19] happening, he's out of it. And you could
[1:07:22] get so lost in the message that you
[1:07:24] could be out of it. You get so all in
[1:07:27] the message, you're out of it. You so
[1:07:29] all in the message, you know everything
[1:07:31] and you're out of it. Don't even hear
[1:07:34] call anymore. Get cold and starchy and
[1:07:37] stiff,
[1:07:40] spiritually arritis.
[1:07:46] You don't want to get cold.
[1:07:49] Eli got cold.
[1:07:53] That's why he's dealing with those who
[1:07:55] he call.
[1:07:58] Eli called had dried up.
[1:08:02] He was no longer listening. Amen. He was
[1:08:05] no longer following. And God don't waste
[1:08:08] time. Amen.
[1:08:10] You have a certain amount of time
[1:08:12] allocated to that goal.
[1:08:15] [Music]
[1:08:17] Are you hearing this morning? You know,
[1:08:19] in Trinidad, I know you have a big
[1:08:21] country. I drive on the highways and I'm
[1:08:23] like, "Wow." For us in Grenada, that's
[1:08:26] like, "Wow."
[1:08:28] We don't have highways. All we have is
[1:08:30] ways.
[1:08:34] So, it's different for us when we come
[1:08:36] here. We're like, "Wow." and you were
[1:08:38] like this is ordinary
[1:08:40] and you could get so comfortable as I
[1:08:42] said that you so that it becomes
[1:08:45] ordinary and don't realize what you did
[1:08:48] where you're sitting and where you are
[1:08:50] then all of a come all of a sudden it
[1:08:51] gets familiar
[1:08:53] oh I know that brother oh I know this
[1:08:55] brother and you have your prejudice and
[1:08:58] your preconceived
[1:08:59] understanding that I don't know who gave
[1:09:03] you and then you find before you know it
[1:09:06] you're in another church and then you're
[1:09:08] in another church looking for the call
[1:09:11] you had here.
[1:09:15] [Music]
[1:09:16] But you're not going to find it.
[1:09:20] As long as Samuel stayed, remember the
[1:09:22] his mother gave it to him in the temple.
[1:09:24] She said you to serve God. And as long
[1:09:26] as he said serving God, he will hear
[1:09:28] from God. And as long you're in the
[1:09:30] place where God called you the first
[1:09:32] time, you will hear from God.
[1:09:35] Amen.
[1:09:37] So pray for me to take my time.
[1:09:42] Cuz I ain't reached there yet. Just pray
[1:09:43] for me. But somebody's pulling.
[1:09:47] So let's go back here.
[1:09:49] Moreover, whom he did predestinate them,
[1:09:51] he also called. And whom he called, them
[1:09:53] he also justified. And whom he
[1:09:55] justified, them he also glorified. And
[1:09:57] here is the part I love. What shall we
[1:10:00] then say to these things? That's that's
[1:10:03] my message to you this morning. Not my
[1:10:05] message. That's the message God give me
[1:10:07] to you this morning. From the time
[1:10:09] brother Tio asked me, I've been laboring
[1:10:12] in
[1:10:12] prayer. Cuz I don't want on that day to
[1:10:15] give God an account for something that I
[1:10:17] just gave because it was a a feeling
[1:10:20] or or a tingling. Amen. All men have to
[1:10:23] stand with what they preach. And you
[1:10:25] better make sure God call you to preach
[1:10:27] because every word you said, every dot,
[1:10:31] you have to stand with your life with
[1:10:32] it. And you have to give an account. I
[1:10:36] say, "Lord, let's just run in." I said,
[1:10:37] "You know where you're going?
[1:10:40] People just dead inside there.
[1:10:44] Where the rod blossom?" Let me tell you,
[1:10:47] in the in the first coat, you find
[1:10:49] everybody there. Pentecostals, Baptists,
[1:10:51] Berians, everybody. They love the Lord
[1:10:53] and they come out and they're in the
[1:10:54] outer coat.
[1:10:56] But every coat is higher. Then you go in
[1:10:59] the middle coat and then you see the the
[1:11:01] crowd thinning down.
[1:11:04] Now you have the sanctified ones.
[1:11:07] But that's not you.
[1:11:09] God didn't call you to stay in the first
[1:11:11] two courts.
[1:11:13] You got to go in the inner veil.
[1:11:17] You don't get there by words.
[1:11:20] You don't get there by ideas. You don't
[1:11:23] get there by thinking. It's a life.
[1:11:31] And this life is not a painting.
[1:11:36] It's real.
[1:11:37] It breathe fire.
[1:11:40] Holy Ghost fire. Amen.
[1:11:47] Aaron Rod can't blossom in the second
[1:11:49] coat. You remain a stick. You probably
[1:11:51] get dry too.
[1:11:53] And he won't dare put it in the first
[1:11:55] coat. You don't put wood there. You
[1:11:58] don't put things
[1:11:59] there. You have to come inside. But you
[1:12:02] notice every state was different. In
[1:12:04] fact, to go in the inner veil, you had
[1:12:05] to tie a rope around your waist.
[1:12:08] That's right. Are you on your own?
[1:12:12] that. Are you understanding me? Cuz
[1:12:15] you're on your own. And that rope is you
[1:12:17] can't go in and pull them out, you know.
[1:12:20] Nobody can go in and help you.
[1:12:26] So, they have to design it in a way that
[1:12:28] when they pulling, if you're fat, when
[1:12:30] they're pulling, if you're thin, when
[1:12:32] they're pulling, if you're medium, you
[1:12:34] don't get stuck.
[1:12:37] Otherwise, you have a problem.
[1:12:41] And the rope had to have a reef knot.
[1:12:46] Them was serious business in those days.
[1:12:49] I can imagine how the priest and them
[1:12:51] used to prepare
[1:12:53] and that happened on the right things.
[1:12:55] He can't go in there. Oh, I forgot to
[1:12:57] pray this morning. Oh, I was busy this
[1:12:59] morning. Oh, I missed something this
[1:13:01] morning. He's a dead man.
[1:13:06] And that is God under the law.
[1:13:09] [Music]
[1:13:11] We talking about grace. You know, a lot
[1:13:13] of people don't know what grace is.
[1:13:16] Grace is not helping you sin.
[1:13:20] Grace is what you live above sin.
[1:13:25] He gives you grace to rise above sin.
[1:13:31] [Applause]
[1:13:32] We can't rise on our own. It takes the
[1:13:35] grace of God.
[1:13:36] [Applause]
[1:13:40] When you overcome, that's
[1:13:43] [Applause]
[1:13:44] [Music]
[1:13:45] [Applause]
[1:13:47] grace. A lot of people think it's
[1:13:49] gracious. Well, I smoked last night, so
[1:13:50] I'm dead. That's grace. No, thy
[1:13:55] smoke. Th grace.
[1:14:00] Grace is for his his children.
[1:14:03] You don't give grace to strangers.
[1:14:07] Thy special virtues
[1:14:10] to the called out ones.
[1:14:18] And that's why this morning I'm asking
[1:14:19] you, what shall we then say to these
[1:14:22] things?
[1:14:24] Let me finish the verse. Hallelujah.
[1:14:29] I missed my curt anyhow.
[1:14:34] If God be for us,
[1:14:37] not the pope, not Trump,
[1:14:42] not your father,
[1:14:44] not your job, God. Amen. And God is not
[1:14:48] a man. Amen. Don't treat him like a man.
[1:14:53] Don't treat him like somebody that is
[1:14:55] your neighbor.
[1:14:57] Amen.
[1:14:59] You must respect him. Amen.
[1:15:02] That's the source of every living thing.
[1:15:09] [Applause]
[1:15:11] And God don't have no grandchildren. You
[1:15:14] don't call him auntie God or uncle God.
[1:15:17] [Music]
[1:15:20] God is not your mind.
[1:15:23] God is not your ideas.
[1:15:25] You could religious. You could be
[1:15:27] religious and have a religious mind.
[1:15:30] Amen.
[1:15:32] And have religious ideas, but dying God.
[1:15:39] And we could get so cold that we think
[1:15:41] God is with us. Just like when Mary and
[1:15:43] Uncle Joseph was traveling. Amen. Auntie
[1:15:47] Mary and Uncle Joseph.
[1:15:52] And they went many days. Every time she
[1:15:55] see Joseph and he see her, I felt
[1:15:57] comfortable.
[1:15:59] Where is the child?
[1:16:04] You come here and you meet one another
[1:16:06] and you are comfortable. Where's the
[1:16:08] Holy Ghost?
[1:16:12] [Applause]
[1:16:17] Amen. Are you hearing me? The connection
[1:16:20] was not Mary and Joseph. Look where God
[1:16:23] was. He was in the temple. Amen. Amen.
[1:16:27] Not because you're going on the road and
[1:16:29] everybody smiling ding God there.
[1:16:33] [Applause]
[1:16:35] If you want to know where he is, see
[1:16:37] what's happening around you.
[1:16:40] God never change.
[1:16:45] This good? You hearing me?
[1:16:49] God never changes.
[1:16:52] Amen. But here is Mary and Joseph and
[1:16:54] they're walking along. I mean, how do
[1:16:56] you walk for so many days and you you
[1:16:58] don't even know where your child is?
[1:17:00] You're not even asking where your child
[1:17:01] is. It must be some kind of
[1:17:03] conversation.
[1:17:05] You sleep, you wake up, the first thing
[1:17:07] a parent supposed to do is wear Jesus.
[1:17:13] Do you remember?
[1:17:16] You're walking every day. You're moving
[1:17:18] every day. You've come here. Is the Holy
[1:17:20] Ghost inside?
[1:17:24] They went on and on and you probably
[1:17:27] would have give him a rap for being a
[1:17:29] not so good parents. But what about us?
[1:17:32] Amen. Where is he? Amen.
[1:17:38] Is he there?
[1:17:40] Amen.
[1:17:42] I could only talk about Grenada. I don't
[1:17:44] know much about Trinidad. And that's why
[1:17:46] when I'm finished here, you can vex with
[1:17:47] me. It's all right because I gone.
[1:17:52] But in Trinidad, how many churches you
[1:17:55] have? We only have
[1:17:58] six. Where's the number now?
[1:18:01] 16. 30 something. Oh,
[1:18:06] [Applause]
[1:18:07] God. What you doing in 30 something
[1:18:12] churches? Hallelujah. I know God has
[1:18:14] divided himself, but that's when the
[1:18:16] Holy Ghost is coming on in one place.
[1:18:22] 30 something churches and growing
[1:18:27] and the time we finish the year we
[1:18:29] probably reach 40.
[1:18:32] But who's in there?
[1:18:35] Mary and Joseph.
[1:18:40] All we building is a lot of Mary and
[1:18:42] Joseph. Where is Jesus?
[1:18:45] [Applause]
[1:18:50] Hallelujah.
[1:18:51] [Applause]
[1:18:55] Oh, we talk Jesus. But I tell you
[1:18:57] something, it's not easy when you have
[1:18:59] to walk Jesus.
[1:19:04] We got to come on. God pull us out of
[1:19:06] Baptist. He pull us out of denomination.
[1:19:08] And what has happened? 33 something
[1:19:10] churches in the message, reading the
[1:19:12] same books, following the same prophet,
[1:19:13] God almighty. Are we that brilliant?
[1:19:20] Have we become lawyers?
[1:19:25] I thought we were simple.
[1:19:30] I thought we were simple led by the
[1:19:32] spirit.
[1:19:34] Amen. Amen.
[1:19:37] Who's leading that?
[1:19:42] Where are we
[1:19:43] going? And you know what's amazing? The
[1:19:47] same 33 churches expect to go the same
[1:19:48] place we going.
[1:19:51] But we can't fellowship.
[1:19:53] All right.
[1:19:55] Now, what kind of God you think you're
[1:19:57] serving? That would not permit you to
[1:20:00] come together here, but bring you up in
[1:20:02] his heaven. You think God crazy?
[1:20:10] God didn't change. Amen. But the
[1:20:13] democracy,
[1:20:15] [Applause]
[1:20:17] the democracy to come after you,
[1:20:20] [Applause]
[1:20:23] how can he expect to separate you from
[1:20:27] your God? Amen.
[1:20:32] Amen.
[1:20:35] [Applause]
[1:20:36] So my question is, what shall we then
[1:20:39] say to these things? I'm trying to bring
[1:20:42] to you. You know what you could, if you
[1:20:45] playing draft, you don't see the moves,
[1:20:47] you know.
[1:20:49] But a person on the other side will see
[1:20:51] the moves. They'll be able to say, "Why
[1:20:54] you push that? Why you push that?" But
[1:20:55] that man here, he have tunnel
[1:20:57] vision. He can't see from the he like a
[1:21:00] horse.
[1:21:02] He can't see the
[1:21:04] moves. And you can come to a place where
[1:21:06] you can't see the moves. All you can see
[1:21:08] is Mary and Joseph. All you can see is
[1:21:11] the things around you. My God, woman,
[1:21:14] where is your son?
[1:21:17] [Music]
[1:21:20] And a woman is a type of the church.
[1:21:22] What's the purpose of the gathering if
[1:21:25] he
[1:21:27] is not there?
[1:21:33] No wonder we can't keep the young
[1:21:35] people.
[1:21:37] They couldn't keep Jesus.
[1:21:41] If they could have keep him, he would
[1:21:42] have been in the temple. He would have
[1:21:45] been around them collecting sweet
[1:21:48] tea. Amen.
[1:21:50] He would have been around them playing
[1:21:52] on his mouse.
[1:21:56] Look at the children today.
[1:22:00] Look what they're playing with. Natural
[1:22:02] types is spiritual. Amen.
[1:22:08] Anyhow, let me go on. Amen.
[1:22:11] So, it is God that justifith. Who shall
[1:22:14] lay anything to the charge of God's
[1:22:15] elect? It is God that justifith. Amen.
[1:22:19] But there's a evil one who is laying
[1:22:21] some charges
[1:22:24] and he's laying some serious charges.
[1:22:26] And that's where we come into the
[1:22:28] message here.
[1:22:34] So I start the message. Amen. So the
[1:22:37] believer that's in Christ Jesus walks
[1:22:39] after the Holy Ghost, not in the flesh.
[1:22:42] Amen. Because the law of the spirit of
[1:22:44] life in Christ Jesus had made us free
[1:22:46] from the law of sin and death.
[1:22:49] Free. Free.
[1:22:52] Hello. Did I say free? F R W Z. Free.
[1:23:00] Free.
[1:23:02] Why you going back?
[1:23:05] That's good.
[1:23:08] Where's the freedom of the Holy Ghost?
[1:23:10] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:23:13] Why go back and bondage on the man?
[1:23:18] You don't want to go back and bondage
[1:23:20] onto Uncle Joseph and Auntie Mary.
[1:23:25] Hallelujah. God don't have
[1:23:26] grandchildren. Amen. And look at them.
[1:23:29] You know, when they found Jesus, didn't
[1:23:32] take the blame, you know.
[1:23:34] Don't you know we were looking for you
[1:23:40] when the day before
[1:23:42] yesterday or the two days before
[1:23:45] yesterday? There's nothing nowhere here.
[1:23:47] I sleep and wake
[1:23:50] up. This fell here. Give me a piece of
[1:23:53] bread. I sleep and wake up right
[1:23:57] here. Where were you?
[1:24:01] But you notice Jesus responds nice
[1:24:04] things he could tell
[1:24:08] them. But like the perfect person heing
[1:24:12] is, he said, "I must be about my
[1:24:15] father's business." Now he could have
[1:24:18] give him a message or make them shame,
[1:24:20] but he didn't do that.
[1:24:23] And so they were left with the apparent
[1:24:25] victory.
[1:24:27] Hallelujah.
[1:24:29] And many times you are left with the
[1:24:31] apparent victory cuz blessed
[1:24:34] are the peace makers. Amen. And that's
[1:24:38] him there. We'll be going on to that's
[1:24:39] the other part of the message. Let us go
[1:24:41] on to perfection.
[1:24:44] Now perfection means at the end. That's
[1:24:47] right. Perfection is not something that
[1:24:50] you just grab and say, "Okay,
[1:24:51] perfection." No,
[1:24:54] it's at the end. Amen. Amen.
[1:24:59] Do you notice when Paul had his
[1:25:01] conversion?
[1:25:02] Amen. You watch them men that had real
[1:25:06] stuff
[1:25:08] immediately he went into the desert.
[1:25:13] He didn't go with a campaign. He didn't
[1:25:15] go with a a message around the place,
[1:25:17] burning up the place. I got hit by a
[1:25:19] light.
[1:25:23] He first had to find
[1:25:25] out what shall we say
[1:25:30] to this thing.
[1:25:33] Amen.
[1:25:35] And he went down in the Arabian desert
[1:25:36] or the Egyptian desert. It was a desert.
[1:25:39] Whether you want to put Arabian or
[1:25:40] Egyptian, I don't know if it's the same
[1:25:42] place. My geography not so hot or down
[1:25:44] in
[1:25:46] age. But he stayed there for 3 years.
[1:25:51] Not three
[1:25:53] days. You say you love the Lord. Do you
[1:25:56] pray for 3 hours? Do you pray? Well, I
[1:25:58] didn't want to go there because I might
[1:25:59] get I don't want to make enemies.
[1:26:02] Let's be friends. Preach, brother.
[1:26:04] Preach.
[1:26:06] Paul, this is the old time fashion way,
[1:26:09] went down there. Amen. You know what he
[1:26:12] did? The prophet said, he
[1:26:14] studied the word. Amen. To find out who
[1:26:18] is that light. Oh,
[1:26:21] and you know what? He found out that
[1:26:24] that light was the same I am.
[1:26:28] [Applause]
[1:26:33] He found out that was the angel that
[1:26:35] called to Abraham. Abraham,
[1:26:39] now I know what we shall say to these
[1:26:43] things.
[1:26:46] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Now I know.
[1:26:49] Amen.
[1:26:51] He also found out that
[1:26:54] Moses had an experience like him.
[1:26:58] Amen. Imagine God drove out all the
[1:27:00] knowledge that was in Moses, drove it
[1:27:03] out of him and brought him to the
[1:27:05] backside of the desert in a dog muscle.
[1:27:08] That prince
[1:27:10] that grew up in state place and learn
[1:27:13] state things. Amen. And he was driven
[1:27:17] Amen. Amen. He didn't go in. He was
[1:27:21] driven.
[1:27:23] And a man that comes to God, the Holy
[1:27:25] Ghost will drive him.
[1:27:29] [Applause]
[1:27:31] If you get the same Holy Ghost that Paul
[1:27:33] got, that brother Brennham got, it will
[1:27:36] drive you, brother.
[1:27:37] [Applause]
[1:27:42] Hallelujah.
[1:27:45] He found out that that's the same
[1:27:48] God and he stayed there until he was
[1:27:51] sure.
[1:27:53] When you speak, are you sure? Amen. Do
[1:27:56] you have a relationship with God that
[1:27:58] makes you sure? Or can I come and change
[1:28:00] your mind? All right.
[1:28:03] You hear a message, maybe brother to
[1:28:05] you, bring a message here and you go
[1:28:06] down the road and another brother said
[1:28:08] another thing and you say, you know,
[1:28:09] that's some that's all right. You know,
[1:28:11] I wonder if brother Tio made a mistake.
[1:28:13] Oh, brother T, I have a question for
[1:28:14] you. Did you mean to say
[1:28:19] 700? As if God didn't know what you're
[1:28:22] doing. Cuz you see, there's something
[1:28:24] called the believers call they call them
[1:28:28] collectors. They come to church to
[1:28:31] collect. If they can't get the tithes
[1:28:32] and offering, they collect information,
[1:28:34] stuff.
[1:28:37] I'm serious. Why? The mind is already
[1:28:40] made up.
[1:28:41] They already have their prejudices.
[1:28:45] How they do it, I don't know. I can't do
[1:28:47] that. As brother Brennham said, I could
[1:28:50] never do that to go and listen to a man
[1:28:53] with your prejudice. Why come
[1:28:57] in helping you?
[1:29:02] Well, let's not jump. Let's go back to
[1:29:05] Paul and his experience driven. Amen.
[1:29:08] And it's only when he was sure he got up
[1:29:11] and went
[1:29:13] back. And how did he come back? He said,
[1:29:16] "I don't come here today to seek the
[1:29:17] approval of man."
[1:29:20] I do not come here today because I am in
[1:29:23] the wisdom of a man or I was taught by a
[1:29:26] man. That's the same Paul that sat under
[1:29:29] Gam. But he found something greater,
[1:29:33] more powerful than Gamil had.
[1:29:39] Gambian made him a terrorist, but what
[1:29:41] he found here made him to rest.
[1:29:44] [Music]
[1:29:49] He found something.
[1:29:54] And when you find that thing,
[1:29:59] try that. Wake up. Smell the coffee.
[1:30:02] It's burning. Amen. Amen. Wake up.
[1:30:10] Amen. He found something.
[1:30:13] What he found was so powerful that he
[1:30:15] challenged Peter, the man with the keys
[1:30:19] who walk in the shadow of Jesus.
[1:30:23] [Music]
[1:30:24] You better know where you're standing to
[1:30:26] challenge Peter.
[1:30:30] But because he had a personal experience
[1:30:33] with that light,
[1:30:36] you are bold.
[1:30:40] [Applause]
[1:30:44] Satan is not afraid of you with your
[1:30:46] noise,
[1:30:48] but he's afraid of the life.
[1:30:54] He respects the life. Amen.
[1:30:59] [Music]
[1:31:00] It makes the demons tremble.
[1:31:04] You don't you don't tremble under other
[1:31:07] things is alive. Not even the message.
[1:31:10] Satan would take a message and he goes
[1:31:12] like no problem. Wet in a duck. Amen.
[1:31:17] Amen.
[1:31:19] So the message is not the final thing.
[1:31:21] When I'm finished here, that's not the
[1:31:22] final thing. It's what happens after.
[1:31:24] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Anybody
[1:31:27] could preach. In fact, you don't need to
[1:31:30] be saved to preach. Amen. That's right.
[1:31:34] Gifts and callings as long as you had a
[1:31:37] gift of the gib.
[1:31:39] The first message that was preached on
[1:31:41] the earth was the serpent.
[1:31:44] God don't preach. God just speaks his
[1:31:45] word. Preaching is trying to get people
[1:31:47] to obey.
[1:31:50] People preaching is trying to get people
[1:31:51] to come. God spoke. Amen. The day you
[1:31:55] eat, the day you die, you want to live,
[1:31:58] you could do this, you could do that.
[1:32:00] Don't pass yet. Boom. So over
[1:32:07] that message is even today. Amen.
[1:32:10] Hunting us.
[1:32:13] That little message, Amen.
[1:32:16] Amen. So it's not the length of the
[1:32:18] message. It's the power in the message.
[1:32:26] Every time I see a funeral, before I
[1:32:28] came here, I buried one of the brothers.
[1:32:30] He was sick and he was one of the
[1:32:32] strangest. He gave me my greatest test.
[1:32:34] I'll be preaching and he will get up and
[1:32:36] walk out,
[1:32:39] angry,
[1:32:42] and I would run after
[1:32:45] him cuz I don't know how to do anything
[1:32:48] else. That is not my pick category. That
[1:32:51] is not my section. things I know about,
[1:32:54] I leave that to
[1:32:55] God. And even what I know about, if I
[1:32:57] find it look dangerous, I say, "Lord,
[1:32:59] you you handle that." And I went after
[1:33:02] him. And I went after
[1:33:05] him. And one day, he fell. He got a
[1:33:10] stroke. And what God can do in 5 years,
[1:33:13] he can do in 5 minutes.
[1:33:18] God put him on his back. Amen.
[1:33:22] Guess what? The temper didn't leave
[1:33:25] him. That's I have seen some things. I'm
[1:33:28] telling
[1:33:29] you, I have seen people teach fish to
[1:33:35] swim. Oh my god. In this
[1:33:42] message, no joke.
[1:33:50] And I thought by now, okay, this brother
[1:33:52] is ready. Ready?
[1:33:54] What? The man have a stroke. The man is
[1:33:57] dying, but the temper is raging.
[1:34:01] [Music]
[1:34:02] Death don't change you.
[1:34:06] True prayer.
[1:34:08] I would have thought if I'm in that
[1:34:10] condition, I'd be praying morning, noon,
[1:34:12] and night.
[1:34:16] But he could not handle the temper.
[1:34:23] People have a saying don't sweat the big
[1:34:25] stuff. I say sweat
[1:34:29] because all that he did that temper was
[1:34:32] bringing them to hell.
[1:34:36] And I sent to the brothers and sometimes
[1:34:37] I'll tell her don't go. Hallelujah. Cuz
[1:34:40] he would reject them. And then I'll give
[1:34:42] him a week and then when he suffer the
[1:34:43] wife will say brother Timmy going now.
[1:34:45] Oh God brother Timmy going now. I said
[1:34:47] no ain't going yet.
[1:34:51] You know why I said that? I went to the
[1:34:53] Lord and I said father don't let that
[1:34:55] man leave without the Holy Ghost.
[1:35:01] He went to hospital with the same
[1:35:03] complaint as another brother in the
[1:35:05] message had. The other brother died.
[1:35:08] They had the funeral and he
[1:35:11] remained same
[1:35:13] condition. He he lingered and lingered
[1:35:17] and lingered and lingered. I just did
[1:35:20] his
[1:35:22] funeral. Tuesday
[1:35:26] gone. But guess
[1:35:28] what? When that all comes, boy, that
[1:35:31] temper had a backup. Amen.
[1:35:36] Somehow somewhere God reached that man
[1:35:39] and the brothers will come. You see, I
[1:35:41] don't know about how you handle it here,
[1:35:42] but in Grenada, we go after
[1:35:45] everybody because you're not coming in
[1:35:47] the church like a
[1:35:50] terrorist because you've been away for
[1:35:52] so long. I don't know what you're
[1:35:55] doing. So when we don't see you, we come
[1:35:57] and see you.
[1:36:01] No, I'm not saying you could do that
[1:36:02] here. It should not be
[1:36:05] all not so in
[1:36:07] Grenada. Some of them people living in a
[1:36:09] far place uphill when you're coming down
[1:36:11] there's only one way stoop and and and
[1:36:15] ride. It's no joke. I I felt we went to
[1:36:19] prayer meeting and when we coming down
[1:36:20] it was skates.
[1:36:24] Hallelujah. So from the time somebody is
[1:36:27] missing and hear me I don't know about
[1:36:29] you in Grenada your Cascal church
[1:36:33] once you're a communion taking member
[1:36:36] you cannot break that word because the
[1:36:38] strength of the church is equal to that
[1:36:40] one man
[1:36:44] brotherham said the church would fail
[1:36:47] bitterly by that one man
[1:36:52] your healings will not be as how it's
[1:36:54] supposed to be. Amen. Amen. Why you
[1:36:57] think I prefer brother to you all the
[1:36:59] time?
[1:37:01] I thank God he's here and I in
[1:37:04] Grenada cuz you had to have grace to be
[1:37:08] a pastor in
[1:37:11] Trinidad. Our people still simple. Oh
[1:37:13] God, let us stay
[1:37:15] simple. They're not that
[1:37:18] technical. You know technical lies.
[1:37:22] So when you have prayer meeting, they
[1:37:24] come
[1:37:25] out. When they have Wednesday service,
[1:37:28] they come out.
[1:37:30] And we pray for
[1:37:31] everybody. I'm one of the few pastors
[1:37:34] that pray for every single member every
[1:37:37] day.
[1:37:39] Now, you don't have to do what I do. I'm
[1:37:41] just giving you my little testimony
[1:37:42] about Grenada while I'm doing the
[1:37:44] message.
[1:37:48] Cuz we found a lot of things. You
[1:37:50] remember I told you about teaching fish
[1:37:51] to swim?
[1:37:54] I had services just like you are having
[1:37:57] and the Holy Ghost would come down and
[1:37:59] the people would be screaming and
[1:38:00] running up. Fellas would leave the back
[1:38:02] and run up to the altar with the power
[1:38:04] glory. And I said, "We ready for the
[1:38:06] rapture."
[1:38:08] Hallelujah. Amen. And I was going
[1:38:11] [Music]
[1:38:12] [Applause]
[1:38:17] along
[1:38:20] glorious. And one Sunday, the Holy Ghost
[1:38:22] came down and shouted
[1:38:26] it. And the Holy Spirit said, "Call a
[1:38:29] solemn
[1:38:32] assemble." And the Holy Ghost was
[1:38:34] digging out them secret things.
[1:38:39] Amen. We don't major on fornication and
[1:38:41] adultery. That too
[1:38:43] obvious. We major on malice and hatred
[1:38:46] and strife and the things you can't see
[1:38:49] that are like little worms in your
[1:38:51] heart.
[1:38:55] Jesus said that's what defile you.
[1:39:01] Not the big stuff.
[1:39:03] That's too obvious.
[1:39:06] Hallelujah. And the Holy Spirit led me
[1:39:09] to tell the church, you write down the
[1:39:13] area that Satan is beating you at and
[1:39:16] set it up without your name.
[1:39:21] And the whole church wrote down, wrote
[1:39:24] down and they set it up. And God, I if I
[1:39:27] wasn't standing, I'd be sitting.
[1:39:32] And there's no lie cuz I have it on
[1:39:34] paper.
[1:39:39] Let me tell you the areas that they
[1:39:41] confess. Temper, lies, sex,
[1:39:45] superstition, jealousy, fear, cursing,
[1:39:50] malice, stealing, doubts, cigarette,
[1:39:54] pride, rebellion, not wearing proper
[1:39:57] clothes, worldly
[1:39:59] music and so on and so on and so on.
[1:40:03] them same shouting people, them same
[1:40:06] glorious people, them same people that I
[1:40:09] thought we ready
[1:40:12] to a man, we made our
[1:40:15] confession and 3 years ago God brought
[1:40:18] us to a place where we had what you call
[1:40:20] compulsory prayer, compulsory prayer.
[1:40:27] No one escapes.
[1:40:31] Hallelujah. So let me give you a typical
[1:40:33] week. Monday I go to the church for half
[1:40:36] an hour before I go to work. That's
[1:40:38] after I send my devotion
[1:40:42] home. Then Monday we come back for
[1:40:44] prayer meeting 1 hour mandatory and we
[1:40:48] join. I tell you we not don't go and
[1:40:50] tell brother do that you're too big. We
[1:40:53] are a small church. Keep it simple
[1:40:57] Lord. I'm getting old.
[1:41:01] And we come on Monday and we pray.
[1:41:02] Tuesday, same thing. Wednesday, same
[1:41:05] thing. Thursday, same thing. Friday,
[1:41:08] that is the power
[1:41:11] hour. We do a half an hour in the
[1:41:13] morning. 2:30 I do an
[1:41:16] hour. No, I'm not bragging. I'm just
[1:41:18] telling you how we live. So don't take
[1:41:20] that
[1:41:22] wrong. So 2:00. And by the way, Friday
[1:41:26] is everybody. You find your time
[1:41:28] according to your schedule, but it must
[1:41:31] be our hour. We ain't leaving nobody
[1:41:35] behind. Jesus said, "I prayed for them
[1:41:38] and I've lost none."
[1:41:43] [Applause]
[1:41:45] We had a brother from Trinidad come and
[1:41:47] join us. He used to go by brother
[1:41:48] Waldron and he said, "Brother Tim, oh my
[1:41:51] god, I've never seen this." He came to
[1:41:54] Grenada in a backslitting condition. By
[1:41:57] the time God was finished with him, he
[1:41:58] said, "I'm going back
[1:42:00] home." He came here seeking his two sons
[1:42:03] which were lost. He came here seeking
[1:42:05] because why? He got divorced. His wife
[1:42:07] had gone and he had said he done with
[1:42:09] him. But God was not done with him.
[1:42:17] He came back here.
[1:42:22] So after that hour on Friday when we go
[1:42:26] home at 6:00 another half an
[1:42:28] hour I love talking to
[1:42:31] him. My only regret we didn't start
[1:42:36] before then at night before I go and
[1:42:38] sleep is your normal
[1:42:41] prayer half 4 in the morning 1 hour.
[1:42:44] Hallelujah.
[1:42:47] When you get up, you do your normal
[1:42:48] prayer Saturday morning and then you
[1:42:51] prepare yourself in a spirit of worship
[1:42:54] for
[1:42:55] Sunday. Glory. I stop all my men when
[1:42:58] you see 2:00. Whatever you're doing,
[1:43:00] slow down. Some people just come to
[1:43:02] church hot and sweaty. Where you coming?
[1:43:04] Well, I just been washing the waist.
[1:43:05] Where you going? I'm going to church.
[1:43:06] Who you going to meet? Who you going to
[1:43:08] meet,
[1:43:11] Jonathan? Who you come to meet? Amen. My
[1:43:16] God is a holy God that ain't changed.
[1:43:19] We need to change our perception of God.
[1:43:22] And you know what brought that? We have
[1:43:24] gone away.
[1:43:26] We need to get back to the Holy Ghost.
[1:43:31] You have a hope here. Many don't know
[1:43:33] where the Holy Ghost is,
[1:43:37] much less finding it. They don't preach
[1:43:39] Holy Ghost.
[1:43:43] You thank God you have a man who's not
[1:43:45] afraid. You know when you start to
[1:43:46] preach Holy Ghost, you getting lost
[1:43:47] blows too.
[1:43:50] Amen. In any Holy Ghost church led by
[1:43:52] God, there is nobody big.
[1:43:59] There I might be on the pulpit but dying
[1:44:01] make me tall is the pulpit that is
[1:44:08] in the sight of God is one. Amen.
[1:44:11] And the same life I have to live, you
[1:44:14] have to live it too.
[1:44:17] The same prayer I have to pray. What
[1:44:19] about you,
[1:44:21] brother? There is no
[1:44:24] exemption. There is no
[1:44:26] buy. There is no
[1:44:29] excuse. You get in or you
[1:44:32] [Applause]
[1:44:32] [Music]
[1:44:35] perish. This God we serve in change. We
[1:44:39] change. get back to God.
[1:44:43] And I can't say that to every church.
[1:44:46] They don't even know where he is.
[1:44:50] You can only get back to some place that
[1:44:52] you know where you come from. Amen. But
[1:44:54] what if you don't know where you're
[1:44:54] going? How you going back? Long ago, I
[1:44:57] used to say back to God, back to the
[1:44:59] church. I can't even tell them back now
[1:45:02] because to go back, you had to come
[1:45:03] from. You cannot go back if it wasn't
[1:45:06] there. Amen.
[1:45:09] [Applause]
[1:45:10] Amen. So, it's not a fancy
[1:45:13] word. It's a It's a reality. I can only
[1:45:17] go back home because I was home.
[1:45:21] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Back means going
[1:45:23] from where you were.
[1:45:25] Just look around.
[1:45:27] When I came in this message, we had so
[1:45:29] much fire. We used to have all night
[1:45:30] prayer. And don't look at me old. I've
[1:45:33] been in a message long.
[1:45:36] But Jesus is what keeps me young.
[1:45:40] Hallelujah.
[1:45:42] I've seen many ministers without the
[1:45:43] Holy Ghost. What happened to them?
[1:45:47] And I thank God that he give me that
[1:45:49] verse. Many ministers go in without the
[1:45:51] Holy Ghost expecting to get it later. By
[1:45:54] the time they get it, they have so much
[1:45:55] damage they can't
[1:45:59] preach. That's why I say get it first.
[1:46:02] That's why I tell the young people don't
[1:46:03] get
[1:46:04] married if he not Holy Ghost.
[1:46:08] Because the ghost he have does beat.
[1:46:15] I had a brother in the church when he
[1:46:18] wanted to to have a relationship in the
[1:46:20] bed, he pull his wife and bring her
[1:46:21] under the under the um
[1:46:23] shower. I had brothers who used to take
[1:46:25] 2x4 and be their wife.
[1:46:31] I've been
[1:46:32] there and I've seen God change them by
[1:46:35] prayer
[1:46:37] and
[1:46:40] consecration. The word is good, but
[1:46:42] that's not enough.
[1:46:44] Amen.
[1:46:47] I could give you a lot of mud and a lot
[1:46:49] of preaching, but the change only begins
[1:46:52] when you go on your knees.
[1:46:53] [Applause]
[1:46:57] And a lot of people don't go underneath.
[1:46:59] Hallelujah. Hurting.
[1:47:02] He hurting. Well, start. You start
[1:47:05] somewhere. Eventually the hood go walk
[1:47:07] out.
[1:47:12] I don't understand. The person that we
[1:47:13] meet the most, we talk to the least and
[1:47:17] then when we in our jam. Wake up.
[1:47:21] No wonder you don't get no answer. God
[1:47:24] is not impressed by emotions, you know.
[1:47:27] Amen. He's impressed by your heart.
[1:47:30] The condition of your heart. Amen. And
[1:47:32] if the heart is not right, how you going
[1:47:33] to get the right God to handle a wrong
[1:47:35] heart?
[1:47:37] Got to repent.
[1:47:39] Fix it.
[1:47:41] Not one of you can go on in Christ
[1:47:44] unless you repent.
[1:47:45] [Applause]
[1:47:46] [Music]
[1:47:49] You don't just get up and say, "Okay,
[1:47:51] Lord, I reach." Hello. What is all them
[1:47:54] bush you dragging?
[1:47:57] Look at my spirits coming behind you.
[1:48:02] Where you get them spirits?
[1:48:06] There was a young
[1:48:09] woman, Sunday school
[1:48:13] teacher. She knew I was right.
[1:48:18] She was
[1:48:19] married and the spirit taker she just up
[1:48:22] one day and leave her husband but in her
[1:48:24] heart she knew it was wrong but she
[1:48:27] didn't pay no
[1:48:30] mind. She went with that one and then
[1:48:33] pretty soon she left that
[1:48:35] one. You get you get it's like a
[1:48:37] practice now but she had to keep pushing
[1:48:40] it down. Amen. Hallelujah. It got to the
[1:48:44] place that the second husband left her
[1:48:46] and she end up in a common law
[1:48:48] situation. Now you're at the bottom of
[1:48:50] the
[1:48:53] barrel. And God help me if you are in a
[1:48:55] common law situation. I don't mean
[1:48:57] you're in the bottom of the barrel. I
[1:48:58] mean that your marriage in the bottom of
[1:48:59] the
[1:49:07] barrel and then she took sick. I tell
[1:49:10] you God have a way of touching us. God
[1:49:12] don't chase nobody. You had to
[1:49:16] come. God don't chase nobody. You know
[1:49:20] why? We are all in a same tunnel. We
[1:49:23] have a tunnel in Grenada called Sendal
[1:49:24] tunnel. And it dark and you just come
[1:49:27] down on you. But if you want to get to
[1:49:29] the next side, you have to make that
[1:49:30] move. And you could only make that move
[1:49:31] when you make the first step.
[1:49:34] And after you make that first step, you
[1:49:35] have to make a next step because you can
[1:49:36] make that step and then turn run back.
[1:49:39] But you're happy. You come to the place
[1:49:40] where you decide you know what I'm
[1:49:41] going. That's called faith. And you
[1:49:45] start to walk. Now here's the beauty.
[1:49:47] Every step you make, you're going away
[1:49:48] from here and you're going closer to
[1:49:51] there.
[1:49:52] Over there is the light. Here is dark.
[1:49:55] Though I walk through the valley
[1:49:59] of the shadow of death, I'm coming to
[1:50:03] the light. You are in that same tunnel
[1:50:06] with me. You may be living in Trinidad,
[1:50:08] but all of us in the same tunnel
[1:50:12] [Applause]
[1:50:16] and the faith I got to begin to walk is
[1:50:19] what's going to bring me over there. But
[1:50:21] there are people walking with no faith.
[1:50:26] They're
[1:50:29] afraid. There's a difference between
[1:50:30] fear and faith. You could be afraid and
[1:50:32] you're still going.
[1:50:36] My God, what a miserable way. Why you go
[1:50:38] back?
[1:50:40] [Music]
[1:50:42] And many of us walk through life like
[1:50:46] that. You don't have to. That's right. I
[1:50:49] have the antidote. Amen. My
[1:50:53] just talk to Jesus. Amen. He's the
[1:50:56] antidote. Amen. So when you're going
[1:50:59] through this valley and he the Lord is
[1:51:01] my what?
[1:51:03] Shepherd. You know what's a shepherd?
[1:51:05] key in front I behind. So there's an
[1:51:08] invisible God in front of me inside a
[1:51:09] tunnel.
[1:51:11] He will bring me out.
[1:51:14] That is
[1:51:17] life. So me and brother Tio by the way
[1:51:20] we same age. I didn't want to tell you
[1:51:21] but we are same age. So we they halfway
[1:51:24] now. Them young fellas them still in the
[1:51:27] back there but they coming though. And
[1:51:29] those in front they a little closer
[1:51:30] here. So you know what has happened when
[1:51:31] they reach here? They start to slow
[1:51:33] down.
[1:51:38] them who they don't hear they running.
[1:51:40] So you know better said come you're
[1:51:46] coming. Oh my lord.
[1:51:50] But when that's empty
[1:52:01] reach has changed people boy. That's
[1:52:03] right. Let us take away all your pride.
[1:52:06] Let us bring you and strip you. And then
[1:52:09] all of a sudden you realize, boy, oh my
[1:52:11] god, what what do I
[1:52:13] have? The woman that I'm telling you
[1:52:15] about, you will stripped and is on a
[1:52:18] dead
[1:52:19] bed. And there's a time between going
[1:52:22] and staying that your whole life does
[1:52:24] come before you. Just before you go,
[1:52:26] your whole life does go on fast.
[1:52:29] real lie, steal, thief, go in church,
[1:52:33] thief in church, come back this, that,
[1:52:34] say you love the Lord, lie there, come
[1:52:36] your whole life going, going, going,
[1:52:37] going, going, going, going, going until
[1:52:39] you reach it to where you are.
[1:52:42] Ain't showing you the special thing in
[1:52:46] church. He ain't even showing you test.
[1:52:49] Sorry, testimony.
[1:52:54] It bring you to the things that you
[1:52:56] bypass
[1:52:57] to hear.
[1:53:00] And you know what happened? Brother
[1:53:01] Brham said
[1:53:04] the soul that she was pushing down raise
[1:53:06] up
[1:53:09] cuz the mind no longer walking.
[1:53:12] Are you hearing me? Amen. The spirit get
[1:53:15] feeble. Well, God God know why he make
[1:53:17] the soul. It's the soul that sin that
[1:53:19] shall die, not a
[1:53:21] heart. And your soul have every message
[1:53:24] that God send you, every warning that
[1:53:27] God send you. That why you use it to
[1:53:28] judge you, you know. Now your spirit
[1:53:31] know your soul is your recorder.
[1:53:36] You will not get away.
[1:53:40] Amen.
[1:53:41] And just at the time you're leaving her
[1:53:44] pastor who used to tell her thing good
[1:53:46] don't worry all is well I pray for you.
[1:53:50] She started to scream. You lied for
[1:53:53] me. My soul is lost. I'm
[1:53:58] lost. I'm
[1:54:01] lost. That soul wake up and start to
[1:54:04] preach back to
[1:54:06] her. She left this earth screaming, "I'm
[1:54:12] lost." The brother I
[1:54:15] bury, he had changed down to a place
[1:54:18] where he gets soft and sweet. And I say,
[1:54:20] "Yeah, boy." Like, "You ready?" He
[1:54:22] didn't last long after he
[1:54:26] died. So, what you think is a game is
[1:54:29] not a game.
[1:54:31] What you think is a way of being
[1:54:33] religious is more than that. You see
[1:54:37] this? That air is called oxygen. You
[1:54:41] know where that come from? God. That is
[1:54:44] your energy to make
[1:54:48] choices right and wrong. And everybody
[1:54:51] here have one
[1:54:53] chance. You're not three chance. One to
[1:54:57] choose between what? Right and wrong. No
[1:55:01] other. And the God who made Adam and Eve
[1:55:04] said to them. You and your generation
[1:55:07] have to go under the same basis.
[1:55:10] And every man that came after, I don't
[1:55:13] laugh when I'm in
[1:55:14] church. I do it after. When I go to
[1:55:18] church and all the brothers, hi, hello.
[1:55:20] I don't have time for that. I need to
[1:55:21] check my light and see how it burnes.
[1:55:26] [Music]
[1:55:29] I ain't going young. I'm going to them.
[1:55:33] They ain't coming to
[1:55:36] me. every time you lay down and
[1:55:39] sleep. Many times I get messages from
[1:55:42] God. That message I'm preaching now, it
[1:55:44] dropped in the from the the Lord Friday.
[1:55:47] I've been wrestling. Lord, what do I
[1:55:49] tell them? I don't know
[1:55:54] them. I said, Lord, when I go there, you
[1:55:57] reach the heart because I don't know
[1:55:58] them.
[1:56:00] But let them never be the same.
[1:56:02] [Music]
[1:56:03] [Applause]
[1:56:10] So, I'm not a popular preacher
[1:56:13] and I'm glad I have been in a lot of
[1:56:15] trouble. You see, Brother Theo, he's the
[1:56:17] smartest preacher I've ever met.
[1:56:19] Whenever I call brother Theo, I just get
[1:56:21] like, "Yes, no." Maybe he could never
[1:56:24] get in
[1:56:27] trouble. He's the only man I know that
[1:56:29] you can't tr you can't get him to say
[1:56:31] something wrong.
[1:56:33] Yes. No. And he gone. I said, "Hello,
[1:56:35] you got me."
[1:56:41] He didn't come for just
[1:56:44] fire,
[1:56:47] trials,
[1:56:49] and a heart that loves God.
[1:56:52] [Applause]
[1:56:57] They're not many men. And I ain't coming
[1:56:59] here to preach him up because you know
[1:57:01] him. I remember when I just g the
[1:57:03] message. I wanted to go to New Zealand.
[1:57:05] I want to go all over the world. Lord,
[1:57:07] I'm going to I used to go in the bush
[1:57:08] looking for my pillar
[1:57:09] fire. Everybody burn. I have a pillar of
[1:57:12] fire, too. And I in the bush for hours
[1:57:14] praying, trying and then one day the
[1:57:15] Holy Spirit said to me, "Hello, show me
[1:57:17] in the Bible your your
[1:57:20] text. Show me your your text. Your
[1:57:22] text." Because even with the signs, you
[1:57:24] can't you have to have a word to back
[1:57:25] the sign. And I said, "Lord, enough." I
[1:57:27] said, "All right, I'm
[1:57:29] done. If I can if I cannot preach to
[1:57:32] Grenada until they come in unity of the
[1:57:35] faith, I ain't going nowhere.
[1:57:38] No, that's not brother Tio. He have a
[1:57:40] gift cuz I can preach like him. He could
[1:57:42] preach five times and even feel it. He
[1:57:43] ain't even sweating.
[1:57:50] So everybody different.
[1:57:53] But you see the point I'm making? That
[1:57:55] woman left this earth with regrets.
[1:57:58] Are you going to leave this service here
[1:58:00] with regrets? When we have communion,
[1:58:02] everybody is dressed sharp because why?
[1:58:04] It's communion with the Lord.
[1:58:07] I just tell everybody come shop looking
[1:58:09] your best. We going to have supper with
[1:58:12] the Lord.
[1:58:14] So all them brothers who even know how
[1:58:15] to tie tie, you see that some of them
[1:58:17] just tie, you don't even know if it's a
[1:58:18] tie. What they coming
[1:58:24] and there's nobody that say I ain't
[1:58:26] taking communion this week. I think they
[1:58:28] come on next week. Hello, you're a
[1:58:33] Catholic. Since when you have the
[1:58:38] right when the word says as
[1:58:41] oft as you do these things, you do show
[1:58:45] the Lord's death. Not the bread, not the
[1:58:47] wine, the Lord's death.
[1:58:52] A young, not a young, a old woman, not
[1:58:54] old, middle-aged going to
[1:58:57] old, solid in the church for 20 years in
[1:59:01] labor. First time she came, she said she
[1:59:03] heard God speak from the
[1:59:06] skies. I said,
[1:59:08] "Amen." But sometime with them, "Amen."
[1:59:11] before you put a full
[1:59:13] stop. And she sat in the church for
[1:59:16] about 18 maybe 20 years.
[1:59:20] And a brother who does preach, she have
[1:59:23] a issue with him. You know issue like
[1:59:25] the woman with the issue of
[1:59:27] blood. Cuz that issue is not something
[1:59:30] that's small enough. It coming from your
[1:59:33] heart. Hallelujah. It's not only
[1:59:36] hemorrhaging. They just have issues of
[1:59:37] the heart that don't go that stay like
[1:59:41] Jumby.
[1:59:44] Sorry, you don't know what Jumby is. All
[1:59:45] right. It's devil spirits.
[1:59:50] and it rise up cuz she say he ain't fit
[1:59:53] enough to make the bread the bread you
[1:59:55] know
[1:59:58] the last time I see bread I went in a
[2:00:00] Catholic funeral and I don't go and
[2:00:02] stick what they take so let's go and he
[2:00:04] finishing and I see the priest take the
[2:00:06] bread and go and lock it in a box with a
[2:00:09] light that in poster
[2:00:11] out and they said that is the perpetual
[2:00:16] flame a candle is perpetual
[2:00:21] flame. So when that gandle done, what
[2:00:23] happened to the
[2:00:27] flame? And they are big educated people
[2:00:30] with 16
[2:00:31] subjects drinking
[2:00:37] that. And God pull you out of that,
[2:00:39] you're blessed. If you stay where you
[2:00:42] were pulled
[2:00:45] out that they play the flame until the
[2:00:48] next service and when they're doing
[2:00:50] communion all man going for communion
[2:00:52] people would discuss and that's the only
[2:00:54] time in the Catholic church when
[2:00:55] everybody's friend peace and love
[2:00:57] brother and they going to take the thing
[2:01:00] from the priest mouth my god you can't
[2:01:02] tell me you had that in the
[2:01:08] message didn't take from
[2:01:10] this and that. My God since when listen
[2:01:12] when I get saved I give up all my
[2:01:13] rights. I don't have a right. All I have
[2:01:16] is wrong.
[2:01:18] Jesus carried my right. So I said Lord
[2:01:20] what should I do? He said go. So amen.
[2:01:25] Do you make up your mind and then God
[2:01:26] say Lord what should I do? Should I
[2:01:28] marry him? He had nice
[2:01:30] eyes. You make up your mind already and
[2:01:32] then going to ask God.
[2:01:37] Lord which church should I go? Should I
[2:01:39] go send the grandy or Londonville?
[2:01:41] Sorry, I won't get in trouble.
[2:01:47] So why you can't stay where you baptize?
[2:01:51] Why you can't stay where the word is?
[2:01:53] Where you can stay where the Holy Ghost
[2:01:54] is? Where you getting your soul feed?
[2:01:57] Well, Lord, I have a issue. There we go
[2:02:00] again. Am I issue with the brother? Am I
[2:02:03] issue with that fella? And who have I
[2:02:05] issue with you?
[2:02:15] And that's what the message is all
[2:02:17] about. You notice you bring me from a
[2:02:19] message and God just helping me
[2:02:23] now cuz I was supposed to tell you how
[2:02:26] this thing come about. It started with a
[2:02:28] horse, a white horse and I ride on it.
[2:02:33] And he had a plan to ride through the
[2:02:36] church and to conquer and to conquer and
[2:02:40] to conquer. One
[2:02:41] aim. Who you going to conquer? Them
[2:02:45] bench. No, the people.
[2:02:50] The white horse rider. And Satan smart.
[2:02:52] He come white.
[2:02:57] Where you riding? Within the framework
[2:03:00] of the true church. Not just the church.
[2:03:03] the true church cuz there's only one
[2:03:05] church you know. Amen. Just have many
[2:03:08] membered bodies but it's one church.
[2:03:10] That I tell you I'm not a Grenadian. I'm
[2:03:12] from the kingdom of heaven and you not
[2:03:14] Trinidadians. Amen. You supposed to say
[2:03:16] me what wrong with that
[2:03:18] [Applause]
[2:03:22] Grenadian by one spirit. We all
[2:03:25] baptized.
[2:03:27] The God that saved me is the God that
[2:03:29] saved you. And if God give me the Holy
[2:03:32] Ghost and he give you, how come we going
[2:03:34] different?
[2:03:36] [Applause]
[2:03:40] Same God, same baptism, same life. Amen.
[2:03:45] Amen. What shall we say to these things?
[2:03:49] Amen. You better have an answer by the
[2:03:51] time we finish. God demands it of you.
[2:03:54] Amen. This message is not for Grenada.
[2:03:56] It's for you.
[2:03:57] Amen. Amen. What shall you
[2:04:01] say to these things that you hear now?
[2:04:04] Don't come and tell me nice message. I
[2:04:06] don't get impressed with
[2:04:08] that. I come and do what the Lord want
[2:04:10] when I gone. I don't even look for pa
[2:04:12] anda. I afraid man.
[2:04:17] The further you can say for a man
[2:04:18] better. The closer you can say to
[2:04:19] Christ, you can't go wrong.
[2:04:23] [Applause]
[2:04:27] And that white horse rider changed
[2:04:30] because they get to recognize him. All
[2:04:32] right. He didn't change because he
[2:04:34] tired. He want to do more damage.
[2:04:38] So he changed
[2:04:40] to
[2:04:42] red. And anybody know red means
[2:04:44] something
[2:04:49] dead.
[2:04:51] Conquering. Conquering. Wake up,
[2:04:54] Trinidad. Don't sit down there sleeping.
[2:04:57] Something happening while you just
[2:04:59] there.
[2:05:00] Satan doesn't rest. He's not a man.
[2:05:05] Amen. That's true. When you resting, he
[2:05:07] ain't resting. He just I wonder what to
[2:05:09] tell him when he wake up.
[2:05:13] I wonder how I could trick him today.
[2:05:16] I will put the Lord always before me
[2:05:18] because he's at my right hand.
[2:05:21] No matter what the devil send, I shall
[2:05:23] not be moved.
[2:05:26] Listen, I believe in the genuine baptism
[2:05:29] of the Holy Ghost and nothing else.
[2:05:32] [Applause]
[2:05:34] Take all the rest.
[2:05:38] Brother, preach and message me say
[2:05:39] there's a highway, a way of holiness.
[2:05:42] And on that road, you walk in the
[2:05:44] middle. Why is made that way? So the
[2:05:46] water could wash the trash to the sides.
[2:05:50] me no trash. Hallelujah.
[2:05:54] One day I met a man who was in the army.
[2:05:56] He he fought in Vietnam.
[2:05:59] Actually, he's my
[2:06:01] neighbor. And we started talking cuz
[2:06:04] when I pick up people, I pick up people
[2:06:05] for spite. And I put on the
[2:06:09] prophet cuz if I even tell them, if I
[2:06:12] talk to them, the prophet talk to them.
[2:06:13] But they had to
[2:06:15] hear. And we started talking. And then
[2:06:17] we started talking about faith. He said,
[2:06:19] "You guys who are calling yourself
[2:06:21] Christians, you don't have
[2:06:22] faith. You're a bunch of wimps." I said,
[2:06:25] "How come?" He said, "Let me tell you
[2:06:26] something. I was in a helicopter flying
[2:06:30] going in the enemy territory and a bomb
[2:06:32] take the back of the
[2:06:34] helicopter." And I panic. I said, "Lord,
[2:06:37] you bring me down safely." And he bring
[2:06:40] down a broken helicopter and he landed
[2:06:42] safe. The man don't go to church. He
[2:06:44] said, "You guys who supposed to have
[2:06:45] faith don't have."
[2:06:48] And we who don't go to church, we have
[2:06:51] faith. He said, "You guys are a bunch of
[2:06:53] wimps." I'll never forget that.
[2:06:57] Me no whimp.
[2:07:00] So I started praying more.
[2:07:03] You think when you just start to pray,
[2:07:04] angels will come down? No, sir. God want
[2:07:07] to see how serious you are.
[2:07:11] It took us three years for us to see God
[2:07:13] moving.
[2:07:15] We have a man that was in coma. His
[2:07:17] struggle was 500 plus. The doctor said,
[2:07:20] "Go home. You have two weeks to dead. Go
[2:07:22] and prepare and meet your children." And
[2:07:24] so on and so on and so on. His wife was
[2:07:26] a member in the
[2:07:28] church. And I said, "Okay, we are going
[2:07:30] to God. But if God heal me, owe God's
[2:07:33] life."
[2:07:35] That was 5 years 6 months ago. Amen. The
[2:07:39] man have friends who had the same sugar
[2:07:42] who lose thumb,
[2:07:44] finger, leg and dead.
[2:07:48] Nobody ain't touch him yet.
[2:07:51] [Applause]
[2:07:58] So I know what I'm talking about. Prayer
[2:07:59] changes things. Message don't change
[2:08:01] things. Pray. Prayer is the only thing
[2:08:04] that make God say, "All right,
[2:08:08] No message prayer.
[2:08:10] Hezekiah.
[2:08:12] Yes, Lord. You say, "Boy, your time up."
[2:08:17] God, there's one guest you don't want in
[2:08:19] your house.
[2:08:22] He's unwelcome.
[2:08:24] But he's a guest because he must come.
[2:08:26] But he's not welcome cuz he heartless.
[2:08:31] Say ready, boy. And here say, "Are you
[2:08:33] ready?" Amen. Amen. He said, "I ain't
[2:08:37] ready and you know I've served you all
[2:08:39] these years." What he did in the past
[2:08:41] didn't help him. It's why he doing now.
[2:08:44] And that man went before God in
[2:08:46] sackloth. He went before God and he
[2:08:48] prayed. And God
[2:08:51] [Music]
[2:08:52] I wish I could shout this out down in
[2:08:55] the fifth
[2:08:56] rib. And God
[2:08:59] Hallelujah.
[2:09:01] said, "I've never done this before,
[2:09:05] but I'll grant him an extension and I'll
[2:09:08] prove it by making the clock." Oh, God.
[2:09:10] Tell me somebody. Oh, you watch watch.
[2:09:13] He going back.
[2:09:16] 15°, not five. It was five. Did I say
[2:09:20] somebody hit the clock?
[2:09:22] 15.
[2:09:25] And each degrees was each five degrees
[2:09:27] was five years. He get 15 more years.
[2:09:30] Can you get God to give you 15 more
[2:09:32] years? You ain't getting it by just
[2:09:34] going through the motion. You ain't
[2:09:36] getting it
[2:09:38] byoop. Let me tell you, devils do that.
[2:09:43] Oh, I feel quivers. And what the quivers
[2:09:45] do your heart? The same condition.
[2:09:50] Amen. You're still lying. Amen. You
[2:09:53] still have bad mind.
[2:09:55] Well, brother, look what Jesus said. Not
[2:09:58] me.
[2:09:59] If you can't love your enemies that just
[2:10:02] take your butt and come back and ask you
[2:10:05] for another one.
[2:10:09] Amen. You ain't ready.
[2:10:12] Cuz some of you say, "No, no, no, no. I
[2:10:15] have more."
[2:10:17] I know. You lying. I don't want to give
[2:10:21] you. You bring it back yet.
[2:10:24] Suppose God had a man testing you.
[2:10:27] Come on. Amen.
[2:10:30] You know how many times I have had to go
[2:10:31] back and say, "Look, I'm sorry. I
[2:10:33] apologize."
[2:10:35] Do it
[2:10:36] now. Go back and tell your wife who just
[2:10:40] tell you, "You're worthless. You're no
[2:10:42] good as a husband
[2:10:47] and go back and call her honey." Bring
[2:10:49] out the honey. Bring it. Bring that
[2:10:51] word.
[2:10:55] Bring that word without the Holy Ghost.
[2:10:57] It's not coming.
[2:11:04] I had a case where I missed something
[2:11:06] and I tell and I sent a text to my wife.
[2:11:08] I didn't know it but I miss it. So I
[2:11:10] figure she will have it. I say when you
[2:11:11] finish with that and you take your photo
[2:11:13] copy, bring it
[2:11:14] back. She sent me back a text. Now I
[2:11:17] know you're
[2:11:20] crazy. What thing I
[2:11:22] have? I said, well Lord, where you could
[2:11:25] go? But you notice what's in it. I
[2:11:27] didn't accuse her. But I say when you're
[2:11:29] finished with
[2:11:31] it, because you can't put fire on fire.
[2:11:34] You got to pour
[2:11:37] water. You have to learn how to talk to
[2:11:39] your wife is you're a Christian. You
[2:11:40] have to learn over. Learn
[2:11:44] over. You can't come with them old
[2:11:46] thing. New heart I will give you. New
[2:11:49] spirit I will give you. Where is it?
[2:11:52] [Applause]
[2:11:56] You can't rest it down.
[2:11:58] [Applause]
[2:12:04] So I said, "Lord, something wrong." So I
[2:12:05] run home. I said, "Nah, something
[2:12:08] wrong." And I go and I dump the thing
[2:12:09] and I I flip it over. Bam. And there is
[2:12:11] the thing. I said, "Oh God,
[2:12:18] do you know what I had to do now? I had
[2:12:20] to go and say apologize." Yes.
[2:12:24] So I take the shortcut. I send it by
[2:12:26] text.
[2:12:32] Hurry. So so so because it's not the
[2:12:35] same as facing it. So so so I apologize
[2:12:38] and so on. But you done there. So I came
[2:12:41] to the church and I say I owe my wife a
[2:12:43] a um a
[2:12:45] honey or a sweetheart. I owe I don't
[2:12:48] know when to slip it in cuz I don't know
[2:12:50] when to slip it in.
[2:12:53] And I they checking and I looking for a
[2:12:55] movement and I looking for a time to
[2:12:57] slip in. Honey and loud enough
[2:13:00] here. No, not so
[2:13:04] honey. Think good. How you
[2:13:08] do? Cuz God had to teach me over. There
[2:13:11] are a lot of things I now learn since I
[2:13:13] start praying that things I didn't know.
[2:13:15] And I thought I was ready for the
[2:13:17] rapture. Oh God, thank God he didn't
[2:13:19] come. Hallelujah.
[2:13:21] [Applause]
[2:13:25] Right now I'm walking
[2:13:27] straight. Every day we in labor we
[2:13:30] learning how to treat one another, how
[2:13:32] to speak to one another, how to deal
[2:13:35] with one
[2:13:36] another. Let's go on to perfection.
[2:13:39] [Applause]
[2:13:44] I don't have the same church that we had
[2:13:47] before. Before we got praying, I didn't
[2:13:50] know who was on
[2:13:52] who. No. When we come and I I don't do
[2:13:56] like other fellas. Once you get saved as
[2:13:58] a young fellow, I g them busy. No time
[2:14:00] for the devil come and put nest in your
[2:14:03] head and light that thing. Oh, right.
[2:14:05] Use a young handsome fell. No. So, next
[2:14:07] one. And I g them things to do.
[2:14:10] Opposition in the church because you
[2:14:11] know you can't fail now. And them fellas
[2:14:15] growing. They praying. They coming
[2:14:17] before God. Look, I probably one of the
[2:14:19] few ministers that ain't have no
[2:14:22] trouble. And it's not because they're
[2:14:24] afraid maybe because you could see I
[2:14:26] afraid
[2:14:28] you but it's because of the Holy Spirit.
[2:14:34] I want the Holy Spirit leading a church.
[2:14:36] They have no high and they have nothing
[2:14:38] different. You know what I just tell
[2:14:39] them? Don't call me pastor unless it's
[2:14:41] absolutely necessary or you're there
[2:14:43] around people.
[2:14:47] Call me brother because a pastor hard to
[2:14:49] do.
[2:14:50] So true. Pastor mean shepherd. Pastor
[2:14:53] mean that. And I have family too. Them
[2:14:55] don't call me pastor. Them say
[2:14:57] [Music]
[2:15:00] daddy. I have five
[2:15:03] children. So anything happened to them I
[2:15:06] had to deal with that before God. And
[2:15:08] now I have a whole church that God give
[2:15:11] me a burden for that I can't separate.
[2:15:13] When them sick, I
[2:15:14] sick. Amen.
[2:15:18] And then when we say let's pray,
[2:15:19] everybody pray. We had a young lady who
[2:15:21] was in hospital. They had to get blood
[2:15:23] and she was supposed to be in a bad
[2:15:24] condition. She had a tumor growing and I
[2:15:26] said, "Oh God, touch that child." And I
[2:15:29] give her a string and I say, "Every day,
[2:15:30] measure it." She said, "Brother Tim
[2:15:32] going down."
[2:15:37] She came out of hospital real quick.
[2:15:39] Look at my daughter there. I didn't
[2:15:40] think I she'll be here, but God answers
[2:15:43] prayer.
[2:15:45] Even when you didn't think it coming.
[2:15:52] What is faith? Faith is when a brother
[2:15:55] do you wrong and you ain't giving back
[2:15:57] no wrong and you accept it. Faith is
[2:15:59] believing God going to handle it.
[2:16:02] But if you is not a faith person, you go
[2:16:04] handle it
[2:16:06] works and you come under the law. Let me
[2:16:08] tell you the law was not perfect. It
[2:16:10] could make nobody perfect. God scrap it.
[2:16:13] If you ask them, there's your loss.
[2:16:16] The rich man kept every
[2:16:19] law, all 10, and he end up in hell.
[2:16:25] Don't tell me about what you did. Tell
[2:16:28] me about what he is doing in you.
[2:16:33] [Applause]
[2:16:37] Unless he has full preeminence in you,
[2:16:38] then you're not your the token is not on
[2:16:40] display.
[2:16:42] Amen. The your confession is not
[2:16:45] accepted. When you bring your confession
[2:16:47] before God, it's not drop and go. You
[2:16:48] know, you have to wait for him to take
[2:16:50] it up and God help you. You only taking
[2:16:53] it up when it sees that it's complete.
[2:16:55] God don't take no halfway prayer
[2:16:59] until you get absolutely 100% serious
[2:17:02] with God. God will not get serious with
[2:17:04] you because God is always 100%.
[2:17:10] [Applause]
[2:17:14] Amen.
[2:17:17] So where we going? You going with me?
[2:17:20] Amen. Onto perfection. And it don't just
[2:17:23] come. So it comes with a prayer life.
[2:17:26] You can't leave with prayer. Nobody. If
[2:17:29] you go back to street prayer. If you go
[2:17:32] back to William Brham, what made him
[2:17:33] unique? Prayer. Imagine a man having 30
[2:17:36] visions in a day. Amen.
[2:17:42] And a vision is seeing things in a day.
[2:17:45] Just so
[2:17:47] he transcended both quarters. Brother
[2:17:49] Brham is the only man that could go in
[2:17:51] hell and search for you.
[2:17:55] He said, "I went and I searched and I
[2:17:58] found him." You find him.
[2:18:02] You're not built for that.
[2:18:04] But God could find him.
[2:18:07] Amen. Amen. Not because God gone.
[2:18:11] Amen. Amen. I never thought I'd live to
[2:18:13] see the day. I love this message. I'll
[2:18:15] give my life for this message. But when
[2:18:16] I see what's going on with it, ashamed.
[2:18:19] A shame. Amen. I just apologize to God
[2:18:22] when I praying for this message and it
[2:18:24] stated it in.
[2:18:27] It was not the intention for William
[2:18:29] Brham to bring a message with all this
[2:18:31] mess.
[2:18:33] A shame. Come on people pulpit.
[2:18:37] Amen. If God didn't call you, leave the
[2:18:40] pulpit.
[2:18:43] When the white horse rider come in and
[2:18:45] he come with a black now, you know where
[2:18:47] he attacks the pulpit.
[2:18:50] Amen. He don't interfere with you. Walk
[2:18:52] them from here defin.
[2:18:59] So God help us with them. Some of them
[2:19:01] pastors, if the people can live higher
[2:19:03] than them, what they have
[2:19:07] I have two sisters in the
[2:19:09] message. I grew up in a very close-knit
[2:19:11] family. My father was a praying man.
[2:19:14] Thank God for
[2:19:15] them. And I live to see my two sisters
[2:19:18] split because one day with this side and
[2:19:19] one with that side from New York
[2:19:23] we special about New York. What?
[2:19:29] You better make sure you have it right.
[2:19:30] What's
[2:19:31] special? Yes sir. I never been to a
[2:19:35] convention and from what I'm hearing I
[2:19:37] miss none.
[2:19:39] Sorry if you get offended but I I I I
[2:19:42] just tell brother M when I'm talking to
[2:19:43] him just as it
[2:19:45] is. How could these things
[2:19:48] be? If I'm representing a message and we
[2:19:51] representing heaven man I want the truth
[2:19:53] not this. Amen.
[2:19:57] Lord I have a Muslim friend. He know the
[2:19:59] Bible as good as me. And that man
[2:20:00] believe in his faith and I believe in
[2:20:02] mine. But that man better than us.
[2:20:08] Oh
[2:20:09] God, somebody help.
[2:20:13] But it takes you to bring the change.
[2:20:16] Why don't you rise up? Rise
[2:20:20] up and live out what God called you to
[2:20:23] be. Amen. And stop footing and
[2:20:25] just sitting down there lazy.
[2:20:31] Break the egg.
[2:20:35] We get so relaxed.
[2:20:40] And it easy to spoil in Trinidad.
[2:20:44] Look
[2:20:45] around everything nice. How you why you
[2:20:48] get you to pray when everything nice?
[2:20:52] Man serve God by need. What is yours? I
[2:20:56] need a new car.
[2:20:59] that you
[2:21:00] need. You wouldn't serve God. When you
[2:21:02] get a car, you're
[2:21:06] gone. I just come to God and I say,
[2:21:08] "Lord, I don't know which one more
[2:21:09] important. But I can tell you, I love
[2:21:11] you and I need you, but I don't know
[2:21:12] which one first
[2:21:16] cuz my need is equal to my love. And God
[2:21:19] help you. I love him. And I will choose
[2:21:20] him first before I choose you."
[2:21:24] When I in trouble and think real bad, I
[2:21:26] can't call you. You know, I can't come
[2:21:29] now.
[2:21:31] [Music]
[2:21:35] Why you can't come? Well, I just hit the
[2:21:37] nap and just sleep just if you know
[2:21:39] where I've been to. All right. I didn't
[2:21:40] call you for a rosary
[2:21:46] [Music]
[2:21:49] is on duty
[2:21:51] and you want me not serve him right, you
[2:21:54] got to be mad.
[2:21:56] So help me God. I'll serve him with all
[2:21:59] my heart, with all my soul, with all my
[2:22:03] strength and a little more.
[2:22:08] I don't have time for games
[2:22:12] and excuses.
[2:22:14] There was a time for that.
[2:22:17] We need to get back to where we were
[2:22:18] when we
[2:22:20] gather just started church up in Kilik.
[2:22:23] What was it?
[2:22:24] Prisonwa. Yeah. Ask him the kind of
[2:22:27] people and what they were doing up
[2:22:29] there. Amen. And the anointing that used
[2:22:31] to drop down. Right now, if you get an
[2:22:33] anointing, you have to praise God. You
[2:22:34] don't even have to move. Lord, we even
[2:22:36] want to move because we don't we don't
[2:22:37] know when you're coming
[2:22:42] back. And who's doing the damage? That
[2:22:46] black horse rider. Somebody say,
[2:22:47] "Brother, I'm gone. He stop right." No,
[2:22:49] he stop right. He killed everybody.
[2:22:52] and where he start to write in the
[2:22:54] message. I never thought he was brave
[2:22:56] enough but he has done a good job in the
[2:22:59] message.
[2:23:01] Just imagine you know the word you know
[2:23:03] the truth and you let a man come in
[2:23:05] here.
[2:23:10] We should be ashamed to to treat
[2:23:12] churches that go be
[2:23:14] judgment every church for judgment. Make
[2:23:17] sure Sunday grande come out shining.
[2:23:21] Hallelujah.
[2:23:25] I only have one conquest. Make my
[2:23:28] calling on election. Sure.
[2:23:31] Paul say I see pulls coming in.
[2:23:35] You know it's a wolf a bad
[2:23:41] animal. And Paul see that sense when he
[2:23:43] was there. Did you realize when Paul
[2:23:46] gets saved, he went in the desert. When
[2:23:47] Jesus gets saved, he went in the desert.
[2:23:48] You say save. Yeah. When he gave the
[2:23:50] Holy Ghost,
[2:23:52] where he went in the desert? Why? To get
[2:23:54] away from man.
[2:23:58] When Jesus came back after 40 days, Paul
[2:23:59] come back after 3 years. Go and touch
[2:24:01] them now.
[2:24:03] Jesus came back in power. Paul came back
[2:24:06] in power. Have you been to the desert?
[2:24:14] I mean, some of us even the only desert
[2:24:16] we know is what we eat.
[2:24:20] I'm deadly
[2:24:23] serious. I didn't come here to get
[2:24:26] approval. I'm tell you here what God
[2:24:28] mind is. Take it or leave it. Amen. You
[2:24:33] don't have to agree with me. That know
[2:24:34] my business. God has handled the bigger
[2:24:36] stuff.
[2:24:38] Cuz I know I go and then you will
[2:24:40] continue your life. And if you didn't
[2:24:42] take care of these things that you
[2:24:43] heard, you're going right back on the
[2:24:44] same bicycle.
[2:24:48] A never ending
[2:24:49] bicycle only getting spiritually lazy
[2:24:52] and fat and doish.
[2:24:58] Sorry, the bride is not dish.
[2:25:02] Amen. Look, I'm moved.
[2:25:07] Hallelujah. I've been praying ever since
[2:25:10] the brother talked to me. Every
[2:25:12] day God came to me the two nights. I
[2:25:15] said, "Lord, what do I tell them? I'm a
[2:25:17] backward
[2:25:21] preacher. I don't do
[2:25:24] this. Ask it's not you. You ask me to
[2:25:26] come." I said, "Rat talk. I'll pray
[2:25:28] about
[2:25:30] it." And now by God's grace, I'm here.
[2:25:33] That's the last time you will
[2:25:35] hear cuz some of you might
[2:25:38] leave. Some of you might die. Hope not.
[2:25:42] But you better make sure you do
[2:25:43] something with it. Amen.
[2:25:47] When do I do it, brother? No.
[2:25:54] Some of you might say, "Well, brother
[2:25:55] Tim, I hear the word and I realizing I
[2:25:58] know after I get my holidays." Shut up.

[2:37:15] saints, if your children can't behave in
[2:37:17] church, lead them

[2:37:28] You are very good church. You don't be

[2:37:35] And I applaud you.
[2:37:37] Hallelujah. Not every church have that.
[2:37:40] From the time during the singing, nobody

[2:37:52] riding inside your home. right in inside
[2:37:55] your life and he would not leave until

[2:38:01] thirst for God now or you just like

[2:38:27] coming here had nothing to do with who
[2:38:28] preaching.
[2:38:33] [Applause]
[2:38:35] Your coming here is a personal
[2:38:38] experience by revelation. By revelation
[2:38:42] from God.
[2:38:44] [Applause]
[2:38:47] You know why I tell you that? Because I
[2:38:48] notice now when the pastor dead, the
[2:38:50] church's dead. Amen.

[2:39:21] Well, them young and I old.
[2:39:25] What shall we say to these things? Amen.
[2:39:28] If God be for us, dumb them thing.
[2:39:34] Dump it.
[2:39:38] Oh, you're too bright. We could get a
[2:39:40] little dance. It does help.
[2:39:45] And I mean that because the more
[2:39:46] intelligent people eyes, the harder I
[2:39:47] forgot to reach them. I had a son and I
[2:39:49] hope my daughter go back and tell
[2:39:52] him. I grew him up praying and singing
[2:39:54] and so on. He went to university. No, I
[2:39:57] think I hear they say he so sure that he
[2:40:03] go I
[2:40:05] pay. Well, I don't want to give the
[2:40:06] figure but a lot of
[2:40:08] money for him to reach
[2:40:12] day was somebody fooling somebody. It
[2:40:14] cost so much money to lose your mind.
[2:40:22] Hallelujah.
[2:40:30] I'm glad that you're enjoying the
[2:40:32] message because then you can't hide and
[2:40:34] say, "I didn't hear."
[2:40:37] [Music]
[2:40:39] [Applause]
[2:40:42] I'm not talking a little bit of money,
[2:40:43] you know. I didn't take long.
[2:40:46] That's right.
[2:40:50] Wait for you to lose your
[2:40:52] mind. I tell you d education. Leave me
[2:40:55] where I is. That's right. I go stay in
[2:40:57] the station.
[2:40:59] Hallelujah. I will stay where God is.
[2:41:02] Where you could light that fire.
[2:41:04] Hallelujah. And keep me burning. Keep me
[2:41:07] burning. Keep me burning.
[2:41:11] If God be for us,
[2:41:19] Time for us to light the fire. Time for
[2:41:21] us to get on board. Time for us to get
[2:41:24] the anointing. Time for us to get on
[2:41:26] fire for God.
[2:41:29] Let's bow our heads.
[2:41:35] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:41:38] If it is God,
[2:41:42] then there is not a normal fire.
[2:41:44] Hallelujah.
[2:41:47] If you are sons, if you adopted sons,
[2:41:50] then prove it.
[2:41:52] Don't be a member. Don't be religious.
[2:41:55] Brother, please softly only believe.
[2:42:00] Don't be like that woman that soul start
[2:42:03] to preach to her at her
[2:42:06] departed. You young people I'm
[2:42:09] challenging you this morning. We have a
[2:42:12] spirit in the world today. Young people
[2:42:13] don't washes. They don't do
[2:42:15] nothing. They eat and they're
[2:42:18] gone. As in the natural so in the
[2:42:20] spiritual. We have we have nurtured a
[2:42:25] lazy
[2:42:27] generation. And what cause it? We stop
[2:42:29] beat. We stop punish. We stop put the
[2:42:32] law down. We're not talking about law.
[2:42:34] I'm talking about the law of Moses. We
[2:42:36] stop
[2:42:38] discipline. And what happened? It came
[2:42:40] in the church too. Pastor stopped laid
[2:42:43] the word down. The people can't take it.
[2:42:45] Boy, they just stay and everything now
[2:42:49] soft like
[2:42:51] porridge. So the church dead. The church
[2:42:54] cold, stiff, starchy. for the wood stiff
[2:42:58] and
[2:42:59] starchy. There'll be very very few
[2:43:03] remnant that will escape the black horse
[2:43:07] rider. The pale one and start to ride
[2:43:09] yet. He comes after we
[2:43:12] go. Now that is all the colors
[2:43:15] mix. Who's in your life? The Holy Ghost
[2:43:19] or the horse
[2:43:21] rider? If God be in your life, what
[2:43:25] shall you say to these
[2:43:28] things? I can't force you, but if
[2:43:30] there's a light, if there's a spirit, if
[2:43:32] there's a talk, if something going on in
[2:43:34] you
[2:43:35] now, don't wait until you like that
[2:43:38] girl, she kept hearing it and turning it
[2:43:40] down, turning it down. After a while,
[2:43:41] you won't be able to respond to
[2:43:44] nobody. You get a professional way. You
[2:43:46] don't you don't come when God
[2:43:49] call. When lost, did you respond to
[2:43:53] God? Shouldn't we have a solemn assembly
[2:43:56] call this
[2:43:57] morning? We getting ready for the
[2:43:59] communion. How are you approaching
[2:44:02] it? You say, "Bim, I don't know. My life
[2:44:05] is just topsy to know your life is topsy
[2:44:07] to is your heart that topsy turby." Get
[2:44:11] it right.
[2:44:14] Repent. We have a open altar in our
[2:44:16] gate.
[2:44:18] Some of you come to the altar. Sometime
[2:44:20] you say, "I'm been going up there again,
[2:44:22] man. That horse rider has fooled
[2:44:25] you. It may be that last time that you
[2:44:29] turned down that you get turned
[2:44:32] off. If God spoke to you this morning,
[2:44:36] raise your
[2:44:39] hand." Excellent. Now, here's the here's
[2:44:42] the hard part. And if God spoke to you
[2:44:45] and you raise your hand, you can't get
[2:44:47] what I'm talking about in your
[2:44:49] seat. There's a lot of room here. Come,
[2:44:52] let's
[2:44:53] [Music]
[2:44:54] pray. God be with us. Come back. And I
[2:44:59] don't want you to do this and then when
[2:45:00] I'm gone, you're gone back. Say,
[2:45:03] Lord, so help me God. I don't move
[2:45:09] until I know that you are there.
[2:45:14] Come
[2:45:15] on, you won't get it
[2:45:21] again. If God is
[2:45:24] God, he will always be God. And if God
[2:45:29] could save
[2:45:30] me, he can save anybody.
[2:45:35] I feel his presence. I remember as a
[2:45:38] young boy, I had I had backsliden. I
[2:45:41] started preaching this message in 77 but
[2:45:43] I didn't have the Holy
[2:45:45] Ghost and I went to Caraku with my
[2:45:47] father and the Holy Ghost came down and
[2:45:49] a woman who was demonp possessed from
[2:45:50] the back of the church slid on her back
[2:45:52] like a snake and came right up and I ran
[2:45:55] behind my father's
[2:45:56] back and I said daddy save
[2:45:59] [Music]
[2:46:00] me preaching anybody could preach and I
[2:46:05] didn't have the
[2:46:07] life I'll never forget that And he just
[2:46:11] stood there and that demon power was
[2:46:14] broken by
[2:46:17] prayer. Then I came back down and I you
[2:46:20] know the cares of this life and the
[2:46:22] deceitfulness of riches and these things
[2:46:24] of the world like a snare. It pulled
[2:46:29] me and I was searching for something and
[2:46:33] I thought I could find it on the dance
[2:46:34] floor. I thought I could find it
[2:46:36] somewhere. So after work I used to work
[2:46:38] in a bank. I would go down there and
[2:46:39] I'll be dancing on the floor alone. I
[2:46:41] was
[2:46:45] searching and I was empty. I was
[2:46:50] empty. And every night I would leave
[2:46:53] last and I said,
[2:46:56] "Lord, and I tried to dance like them,
[2:46:58] trying to move like them, and I couldn't
[2:47:00] find it." No, God. The most wretched
[2:47:05] life is one who knows and
[2:47:07] [Music]
[2:47:10] can't. And I was going home about 3:00
[2:47:14] in the
[2:47:15] morning and my sister
[2:47:17] Debbie before I reached the house, she
[2:47:20] heard me pull a chair and sat down. That
[2:47:22] was my
[2:47:23] spirit. It had arrived before I did.
[2:47:28] And then I came home wounded, broken,
[2:47:31] [Music]
[2:47:32] beaten. And I'll never forget that
[2:47:36] day. My father used to have morning
[2:47:38] devotion. And I just dropped to the
[2:47:40] front. I said, "Oh God, daddy, I
[2:47:43] surrender. Oh
[2:47:45] God, I can't fight anymore. I can't
[2:47:49] fight
[2:47:50] [Music]
[2:47:51] anymore. I give up. Oh God, I give up."
[2:47:57] And God began to work on me and drove me
[2:48:00] to the church. And I tell you, I beat on
[2:48:03] that ground from the back of the church
[2:48:04] to the front for
[2:48:08] hours. Oh, he washed me
[2:48:10] [Music]
[2:48:14] good. Oh
[2:48:17] God, I can't forget these
[2:48:20] things. I can't. I love him. I love him.
[2:48:24] Oh God, I love him.
[2:48:27] [Music]
[2:48:30] I love you. Oh god, I love
[2:48:38] you.
[2:48:40] [Music]
[2:48:49] [Music]
[2:48:52] Wow. Oh god.
[2:48:55] Show them Lord that I didn't
[2:48:57] [Music]
[2:48:58] lie. Touch somebody. Oh God, I can't do
[2:49:04] it. The rest is up to
[2:49:07] you. Spirit of the living God, come
[2:49:12] [Music]
[2:49:22] down. Shut up.
[2:49:24] [Music]
[2:49:34] [Music]
[2:49:46] I'm God. Why don't you fall on your
[2:49:49] knees
[2:49:51] somewhere? Talk to him. I can do it. You
[2:49:54] are to do it.
[2:49:55] You ought to come all the way
[2:50:00] back. All the way. Come
[2:50:06] back. Oh, all the
[2:50:10] way. The fact that you come means he's
[2:50:13] not finished with
[2:50:15] you. You're not doing the saving. God is
[2:50:18] doing the saving. You are doing your
[2:50:21] repenting.
[2:50:23] You are doing the
[2:50:28] [Music]
[2:50:33] repenting. Don't pass. He's always
[2:50:37] willing. Now, you going to get nothing
[2:50:39] from him if you're going to stay
[2:50:41] silent. You got to be
[2:50:44] sincere. How bad do you want him?
[2:50:49] No baby get anything from God by just
[2:50:51] being
[2:50:53] quiet. They scream until they can't even
[2:51:00] breathe. When last you had a old time
[2:51:03] old time fashion revival where God was
[2:51:06] shaking you.
[2:51:21] I promise you he's here. But you had to
[2:51:24] let go. You had a bus
[2:51:27] way. Don't be
[2:51:29] [Music]
[2:51:32] sty. You got to hunger. You got to
[2:51:35] thirst. Amanda thirsty. Don't
[2:51:40] mumble. Bust out from your safe net.
[2:51:45] on your comfort zone and
[2:51:51] cry. That's
[2:51:55] it. Don't be watching
[2:51:57] others. Don't be afraid of what would
[2:52:00] happen. Let go. Let the Holy Ghost
[2:52:03] strike you.
[2:52:11] Come on Sunday grandy. This is your last
[2:52:18] [Applause]
[2:52:20] ride. The Holy
[2:52:23] Ghost is ebing
[2:52:27] away.
[2:52:29] Oh, don't get
[2:52:31] left. It's real.
[2:52:45] There has to be somebody
[2:52:49] here. You're not going to gain nothing
[2:52:51] if you remain the same way. You got to
[2:52:54] do something you have never done before
[2:52:57] to get something you have never yet
[2:52:59] received.
[2:53:04] That's the word. There is no other way.
[2:53:07] I don't care what you think. Dump it. I
[2:53:11] don't care what you feel. Dump
[2:53:14] it. Come out from your
[2:53:18] shell. Some of you might be hanging over
[2:53:20] hell. Run.
[2:53:24] Say,
[2:53:32] Jesus, Father God, I give them to
[2:53:35] you. May the fire of God that's around
[2:53:38] this place, Lord, just take the whole
[2:53:41] place and sweep this place. May the fire
[2:53:44] of God hit the young ones, hit the old
[2:53:47] ones. Come on, little people.
[2:53:55] Trinidad, don't miss
[2:53:57] it. This is
[2:53:59] it. Come
[2:54:02] out. You have a voice. Then
[2:54:07] call. He did not say whisper. He said
[2:54:10] call and I will
[2:54:12] answer. Break
[2:54:18] out. It's a little softer.
[2:54:23] Just a little softer. Keep
[2:54:24] [Music]
[2:54:31] playing. What about you young girl over
[2:54:36] there? Mommy is not the
[2:54:43] problem. I am the
[2:54:45] problem. But Jesus is a solver.
[2:54:50] He's a problem
[2:54:52] solver. Come on. Come on, Sandy
[2:54:57] Grande. Don't miss it. Don't miss
[2:55:07] it. There is somebody
[2:55:10] here. Why don't you be like the woman?
[2:55:13] If I can
[2:55:16] touch the hem of his
[2:55:21] garment, you don't be looking at what
[2:55:23] happening. You be the happening. You be
[2:55:26] the one that's
[2:55:29] happening. Say, "Lord, I'm in a
[2:55:31] desperate position. I am in a terrible
[2:55:33] state. If I don't get desperate, I
[2:55:37] perish." God can revolutionize your
[2:55:40] home. God can revolutionize your
[2:55:42] husband. God can revolutionize your
[2:55:44] whole life. God can revolutionize your
[2:55:46] children. God can change what you don't
[2:55:49] think can
[2:55:52] change. You may have a sickness. You may
[2:55:55] have a problem, but God can touch
[2:56:01] you. I'm inviting you to
[2:56:05] him. The God that helped me can help
[2:56:08] you.
[2:56:13] [Music]
[2:56:18] Don't stop. God bless
[2:56:23] you. Wait, one more thing before I
[2:56:25] leave.
[2:56:34] [Music]
[2:56:36] If you don't call out to God this
[2:56:40] morning and
[2:56:41] really be desperate,
[2:56:45] you don't know when you'll get the next
[2:56:47] chance. Whatever the devil is showing
[2:56:49] you is a a mirage. It's a
[2:56:52] lie. The horse rider, he he come to
[2:56:55] destroy.
[2:56:57] God wouldn't send this message and you
[2:56:59] come here if there wasn't a need. I've
[2:57:02] been praying for
[2:57:04] [Music]
[2:57:06] days. Don't miss your chance.
[2:57:09] [Music]
[2:57:11] And when I tell you he comes to those
[2:57:13] who are calling,
[2:57:16] there were many blind men, but Zakius
[2:57:18] was different.
[2:57:21] Zakius cried out and when they tell him
[2:57:24] keep quiet, he
[2:57:26] shouted, "You don't have no pride when
[2:57:29] you have a
[2:57:31] [Applause]
[2:57:35] need. You don't have no pride when you
[2:57:37] have a
[2:57:40] need. You don't
[2:57:42] [Music]
[2:57:44] care. It's now in your hands.
[2:57:48] Jesus on your hands. God bless you.
[2:58:01] [Music]
[2:58:12] [Music]
[2:58:22] Heat. Heat.
[2:58:29] [Music]
[2:58:43] [Music]
[2:58:48] Heat.
[2:58:54] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[2:58:57] [Music]
[2:59:21] [Music]
[2:59:24] Jesus
[2:59:29] call you.
[2:59:37] Oh, come
[2:59:42] on.
