Isaac going to be ministering the word to you this morning what a time last Sunday what a time in his presence last Sunday and the unction of the spirit that was there but before Isaac but Isaac comes on just want to read uh musician remain I want to read something just before he comes on and this is from B brandham you know we talking about the breaking of God the heaven silence and the prayers of the Saints and I want you to know what the prayers of the Saints is it's not prayer of the people is the prayer of the Saints and he said remember last night this some don't try to take the other man's office some evangelist and some pastors some teachers remember speaking about human Thim and remember talking about Dan and not and and and Juda and all those things were placed you know none couldn't be out of order you know it was 12 tribes and there was a head of the three tribes represented there by lion ox man and Eagle because that is what was wrong with to throne amen so God is not just doing things halfhazard everything have to come in position and in order sir for things to take place so that's why the prophet said the angel of the Lord is on earth now fixing things around now you can't fix like God could fix you can't know what to put here and set here that's why you have to believe Romans 8:28 Hallelujah that all things work together for good praise God so when God closed this door because God don't want the behind that door to get to you so he blocked that door for you not to damage yourself that's why God closed that door is that because he don't like you and he have a problem with you that's not the door for you to go through he have another door for you because he is always a way maker he has proved himself to be a way maker especially when there is no way especially when there is no way God makes a way Hallelujah glory to God Amen thank you Lord God always have something in ahead of the game 5,000 people to be fed what what do we have here to feed these people if they walk away from the surface they feel hungry they faint that's right we have to give them something that's right they say we have a boy here with five loads and two fishes but that is not the problem Hallelujah we just need to have something to start with because if you only get started God will do the rest we just need a start if we could only get this whe turning if it could only get activated into the higher class into the god class amen into that DNA of God who you are Hallelujah Glory you must get a fight you supposed to get a fight you can't be a warrior in a relaxing position God to put you in battle to be Warrior how else you going be a warrior you didn't born knowing who you are you're born in sin you're born in iniquity you come in the world speaking lies you don't know who you are you had Amnesia God had to bring the word to bring back to your mind that that is not you that cinman is not you hallu hallu go come to remain you leave you in the C man mode C man mode nothing much with that no that why Samson didn't care Samson was just ripping up the Philistines amen nothing stopping Samson they close on the gate on Samson and Samson take the gate on the post and walk up with it it's like it's like that that's what you Sam smiling is that amen amen amen is is that you going block me up with I going show you who's the boss there some something come upon him the spirit of the Lord come upon Samson Samson rip off the gate because he know he belong to a super race a god class a higher level of people and God want you live down like an animal not no low down lustful evil Wicked carnal natural Unholy filthy life he wants you to raise up and enter into where you're supposed to be in that God class amen so but said don't try to take the N man's office some evangelist pastors he said now what for the for the Perfection of God does it read that he said no the Perfection of saints who are the Saints the Sanctified ones you ain't the Saints until you're Sanctified so the Saints are the Sanctified ones in other words the Sanctified ones is who will to be perfected so you want God to give you a clean mind a clean heart one time say who Ascend unto the hill of the Lord he that had Clean Hands and a clean heart that has not lifted up his soul unto vanity and sworn deceitfully hallelujah hallelujah praise God Amen he said be holy for I am Holy Worship the Lord in the beauty of Holiness without which no man shall see the Lord oh give the Lord a praise offering Oh Glory to God so who are the Saints a Sanctified one blood sprinkled upon you not your own righteousness but his blood his Holiness drop upon you oh glory to God you're praying through that blood you're underneath the blood you're thanking God for the blood we have Fellowship one with another by the blood amen Hall all right the preacher is in the house all right I I I told him I don't want him stay back there and he not coming out you all right Revelation 2:3 I Know Thy Works thy labor thy patience how th cannot bear them which are evil and thou has triy them with say the apostles and are not and has found them liars and as born and as patients and for my name's sake as labored and has not fainted Hallelujah God speaks amen how beautiful the Savior praises and commends his children praises and commends he takes full account of their fine spiritual attitudes and behavior he knows there is weakness among them but as yet he doesn't cry out against it amen amen isn't that just the Lord he knows how to encourage Us in the right matters and discourage Us in the wrong matters we could all learn a good lesson right here in running the church and our families and better still we could all learn a good lesson in that God deals with each one of us in exactly this way amen don't ever be discouraged saint of God for God is not ungracious to forget your labors of Love whatever you do even to give a cup of cold water to someone has a reward and a blessing from the Lord I know th labors and I patience he walks in the midst of his church he's aware of the suffering of his people and he cares as it was in a days of captivity in Egypt when he heard the cries he who never changes till hears the cries of the oppressed as he walks amongst them that's why important that you cry and don't Bluff your way like everything is all right no no no no hunger and thirst cry weep Paul amen send your requests knock on every day Hallelujah pray the same prayer have to pray have to pray pray it let him know it's you again on the line you haven't heard from him yet Hallelujah you didn't hear that you haven't heard from him yet but you are still on the line Hallelujah if you don't if I don't hear this evening I'll be back here in the morning and at noon time and in the evening I'll be troubling all day long Heaven you heard me Oh Glory to God what shall this man say what shall this unjust judge say this person nagging avenge me this person n in give me the Holy Ghost this person n in want a breakthrough this person n in I want Deliverance the nagging God let God get fed up let God get tired hearing you Hallelujah but we not going to stop we going to bomb heaven with prayer we're going to drop some BMS of prayer we going to get a break you anyhow Oh Glory to God we going to have a Revival anyhow my God hallelujah glory to God glory to God if your fellowship and your friends is a bunch of crooks you'll become a crook yourself if your friends is thieves you'll come thev yourself if your friends negative you'll be negative yourself but if you ever get in contact with Abraham if you ever contact with David if you ever get in contact with Samson if you ever come with the Jeffy if you ever comea with the Royal SE of Abraham you would find a people that no God no faith no who they believe hallelujah hallelujah that's why when God come down he said I am the god of Abraham Isaac and of Jacob I am the god of Israel I am de God oh Hallelujah woo wo woo Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Glory Glory Glory Glory be seated one time my God tell a man your days up all right fix your papers right time up that man set his face before God and say God I need more time I serve you all these years I ask him for an extension God said take [Applause] it did you hear that God give him extension because he asked ask it shall be given unto you Lazarus listen he didn't stay alive all the time you know all right he went back and died again you know that's right but that don't mean God can raise him so you could be sick and bu God that God heal you teror me brother pray for 92y old man he was healed healed when you expect him like a waste of prayer talk pray for that man man God heal it had no waste of prayer no prayer is wasted praise God no pray is wasted that's what the devil want to tell you that your prayer means nothing your prayer is not wasted I've heard the cries of my people I heard the cries of my people there is prayer that God hear they are prayer that God is answer so listen to this my the very word labor signifies awarness through oppression God's people do not only work for him in a labor of love but they suffer for him with joy they are patient in being the Yoke the first aid suffered great persecution Hallelujah it had to work hard to preach the gospel to shed forth truth their High Calling in life was to serve God and when their hopes in life were blighted Hallelujah here this bum when their hopes in life were blighted they were patient and committed all to him who had promised a last recompense in heaven for what they had given up for him on Earth amen I think we ought to stop here and deal with the thought that God people have always been and always will be persecuted you know from Genesis in the book of the beginnings and what you find started there will carry on right through to Revelation and never change amen there we see Cain persecuted and kill Abel because the latter pleased God then we see the perfect picture in Abraham son of the flesh Ismael who teased and fought the son of promis Isaac there was Esau who hated Jacob I would have killed him had not God intervened and in the New Testament we find Judas betraying Jesus while the religious orders of the first century attempted to destroy the early Believers the children of this world controlled by the devil hate the children of God that are controlled by the spirit amen so no matter how just and upright a Christian is before the public and how gracious he is to his fellow man doing not but good let him confess Christ as his Savior and acknowledge the operation of the gifts of the holy spirit in tongues and prophecy healing and miracles and he will be condemned amen the spirit of this world hates the spirit of God Amen that's just plain as it is and because it can't here we go because it can't overcome the spirit of God Amen it can't it tries to destroy the vessel in whom the spirit of Truth dwells so whatever Spirit it have outside of second Peter 1 14-7 cannot overcome that because that was the voices that overcome in every age there was a triumphant anointing that God released upon his elect in every age to overcome the devil even in the Dark Ages the ox anointing was upon the people to ride through even so amen I commit my spirit into your hands Lord Jesus and they burn them at the stake and they overcome the Devil Couldn't frustrate them from giving up their lives from being burned at the stake from being crucified upside down from being Amen in the Lion's Den but they stood their ground and we going to stand our ground because God give us the ability to stand before God make a fish you had put water for the fish to swim in and before God put us in this a he had to put something in us to face what we have to face I will not believe otherwise it's already built in once it have a Goliath there is a damid somewhere Glory don't tell me about Goliath tell me where is David Hallelujah persecution and trials a natural and normal part of Christian Life there's only one thing you can do about them commit them all to God judge not and leave their outworking and final judgment to him thou can not bear them which are evil thou has try them which say they Apostles and are not and has found them Liars right these Ephesians believe that God's people ought to be holy am there's going to be another Epi Ephesians Hallelujah let me repeat it again these Ephesians believe that God's people ought to be holy according to this verse they took steps to keep the body unle from sin most evidently the apost had apostasy had already started sin had entered into the church but they were obedient to the words of Paul when he said to put away the wicked from amongst them they were a separated people had the world they had come out of the world and now they weren't going to let the world enter amongst them they this the part I want to get to they would not put up with sin in the church Holiness wasn't a phrase with them or a figure of speech it was a way of life let me repeat that Holiness wasn't a phrase or a quote on with them or a figure of speech it was a way of life thou has tried them with say the apostles and are not has found them Liars my that is a blunt statement that was try them who were call Apostles isn't that presumptuous what right has a people to try those who call themselves Apostles how do they try them oh I love this here it is in Galatians 1: 18 though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you that which we have already preached unto you let him be a curse watch it was the apostles who brought the original word to the people that original word could not change not even a DOT or a dash no mistakes no error nothing god is perfect God is not a man that would lie he has a word that is perfect His prophets are the mpce of God Hallelujah watch watch Paul knew it was God who had spoken to him so he said if even I come and try to give a second Revelation to make a change from the one I originally give let me be a curse you see Paul knew the first revelation was correct God can't give a first revelation and then a second Revelation if he did he would be changing his mind he can give a revelation and then add to it as he did in the Garden of Eden when he promised the seed of the woman and then later designated that seed to come to Abraham and then later said it would come to the Bloodlines of David but it was the same Revelation it only give the people more information to help them receive and understand it but God's word can't change the seed came exactly as be revealed and these and you see what those false apostles were doing they they cared they came with their own word those Ephesians knew what that word that Paul as Paul taught it they were full of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of Paul's hands they looked those false Apostles in the eye and said you are not saying what Paul said therefore you are false oh that sets my heart on fire get back to the word it is not you that really tries the Apostle and prophet and teacher it's the word that tries them amen Oh Glory to God that's why it can't be little me and big you it have to be Sons and Daughters of God till we all come into the unity of the faith and those believers they wasn't afraid to check out who say they Apostle and check out who say they a prophet and check out who say they a teacher because the mouth say they're teacher there that my goodness is not like that brother has to be the word has to be the word living and thundering could we all stand and give the Lord a worship and a praise how we thank God for a 20th century Prophet that brought this immovable word this solid word praise God let's sing this song what can be done with the so high like mine please offer it Hallelujah with the all the wine the O is you it's the spirit of love please wash me a new with the wi of your l oh Lord what can be done oh high like my be suffer [Music] [Applause] [Music] let's just sing it one more time what can be done with the soul heart of M the all the all is of love please wash me are new with the wi of your can we just give the Lord some praise this morning oh blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Glory he is worthy of the praise he is worthy of the honor this morning oh let's just thank him let's just bless his name let's just exalt his name together let's exalt his name forever amen amen amen let's just bow our heads for a word of prayer Heavenly Father we thank you this morning to be in your house to be in your presence and Lord we are so grateful Lord that father you permitted us all to be here to Lord be connected to you at such a time as this father now may you bless your people Lord may you bless those that are here those that are downstairs are those that are connected to the internet Lord may you bless the reading of the word and the opening of the understanding to the people Lord may you take me out of the way completely and Lord may you bring great Deliverance to your people may you bring great encouragement to your people father may they leave here with Lord Praises on their lips and a shout in their hearts Lord with a genuine revelation of the time and the season that we are in Father we commit the service into your hands father in the precious name of Jesus Christ and the church says amen thank you musicians you appreciate brother over this morning you appreciate the worship and the special thank you so much for the special this morning so I like to go straight to the word greetings in the precious name of Jesus Christ and Welcome to our Sunday morning service I just want to read two portions of scripture reading from Second Chronicles chapter 20 and reading from Isaiah 55 for two portions of scripture 2 Chronicles chter 20 and verse 15 hallelu and this is the spirit of the Lord in the midst of the congregation saying and he said Haren ye all Judah and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem and Thou King Jehoshaphat thus sayeth the Lord unto you be Not Afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude for the battle is not yours but God's and read from Isaiah 55 and reading from verse 6 seek ye the Lord while he may be found call ye upon him while he is near let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts and let him return unto the Lord for he will have mercy upon him and to our God for he will abundantly pardon for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways sayeth the Lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts for as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven and returneth not fither but WTH the Earth and make it it bring forth and Bud that it may give seed to the S and bread to the eater so shall my word that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the thing with to I sent it may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated amen amen everybody feeling fine everybody happen to be in the presence of the Lord so I always say and brother bam actually said he said it's easy to talk about what God did in the past it's easy to preach about what he's going to do but it takes some great faith to speak about what he's doing right now and you have to realize that no matter what trial test situation problem persecution what you can't understand God is doing something right now and in the message taken s side with Jesus brother brandham said these tapes this message will fall into the hands of the predestinated so the fact that the message fell into your hands means something about you and bovid said it last Sunday and I was saying it uh in maraval on Tuesday night I said it's so amazing uh that there's a president elect in the US and no matter your feelings or opinions the reality is come January Donald Trump will become president of the US whether you voted for him or didn't vote for him whether you think he's qualified or he's not qualified it doesn't change the fact that he's destined to go into power and mov brought it out last week that there's a vote that already took place way back before there was a moon before there was a world before there was a star and there are some people who didn't vote for you they didn't elect you they don't think you could make it they don't think you're qualified but there's only one vote that's important this morning and who he found you he elected and who he elected he called and who he call he already justify it doesn't matter what the devil thinks what your family thinks what your body thinks what your mind thinks what your past says about you you maybe see that there are people who speak about his past and his past is not stopping him from hitting his throne what about your past hitting a different kind of Throne you are promised to be somewhere this morning and that place is in God's kingdom and no devil could stop it no protest could stop it no demon could stop it because you are promis and inheritance can the church say Amen so I have a very interesting title this morning and it's taken Direct IR ly from The Prophet's message in a message to guide and I want to read the quote and I'm going to refer to it uh quite a few times uh but in the message to guide brother brandham said God has never changed his strategy and Satan has never changed his so my title this morning is God has never changed his strategy and my subject the battle is not yours and my inspiration Jesus Christ the same yesterday the same today and forever can the church say Amen so what is a strategy a strategy is a plan of action designed to achieve a long-term or overall Aim so there are many dimensions to strategy in business there's strategic planning but the word strategy is most connected with war because a general has to have a strategy for his army to win the battle and the God we serve is a Master General and he also has a strategy to win the battle but there's a beautiful part of this whole strategy the battle is not yours but it's the Lord's you might be on the Battle Ground but it's not your battle you might be in the battlefield but it's not your battle you may have been given a sword to fight but it's not your battle you have been told to put on the armor of the Lord but it's not your battle you have been asked to grow up into a certain stature but it's not your battle you may get wounded you may get cut but it's not your battle you may may be battle scared you may be tired but it's not your battle you're going to have to fight but it's not your battle being caught up in the fight doesn't make it your battle but this morning the battle is not yours but it's the Lord's and when the Lord appears on the scene brother popwell it's a different story because you will realize that everything in scripture is strategy you may be seated I said to them in maraval on Tuesday night God existed by himself and in order to fulfill his strategy of being a Healer he had to have a long-term plan Hallelujah a plan of action to achieve a long-term aim he was there by himself and he realized that there was nobody to heal so God in the back part of his mind say let me make a strategy to heal somebody I need to get a strategy to deliver somebody there's got to be somebody backsliding but I got to get a strategy to deliver the backslider and God in his mind because he's not from time he's in eternity so he's moving back and forth he's in all the years he's in all the ages he's in all the times and he said for this strategy to be unfolded you may be seated Hallelujah one of the greatest strategy games is a game of chess you have different pieces on the board not just different pieces but different pieces could only move in certain ways you can't move it how you want to move it you have to move it based on the rules of the game and the master chess players they distinguish themselves by how many moves ahead they can think so when you're playing a master chest player he will tell you Checkmate in four moves and if you are new to the game you can't even see it you can't even understand it but brother brandham said in that quote he said God let me read the quote exactly he said God has never Chang his strategy and he follows it with and Satan has never changed his when I read that this week it had me so happy because we are playing a fixed game where God's strategy is guaranteed to win and the devil can't even improve his game you understand what it is you may be seated for a minute I don't think you get me if you're playing chess brother kangali and you are trying to get better so you are practicing to improve so the next time you play against the player who is your opponent you want to be better than he is but we are playing a game where the enemy cannot get better the enemy cannot improve he cannot change his strategy and God also he cannot change his strategy because his strategy makes him a winner every single time he has never lost a battle he has never lost one there has been never one person that God predestinated ated that was ever lost because God can never change his strategy I can't hear you this morning you may be seated so if you are sick this morning you may be seated God allowed the man who was SI for 38 years to be sick for that time you may be seated for a minute I want you to get this because way back there in the beginning he told himself I want to deliver that one for myself I don't want a minister to pray for him I don't want the Elder to lay hands on him when I get there I'm going to take care of that lame man for 38 years he's coming to the pool looking for the angel to stir the waters but he doesn't know behind his struggle behind his situation behind his struggle God has a strategy and there came a day when Jesus walked by the pool of Bethesda he passed this one he passed that one he passed that one but he went straight for that man he said this one is mine will thou be made whole can the church say Amen you may be seated God could never change his strategy I already left my notes already God is limited brother the kangali until he gets somebody to use he needs some hands to use he needs some feet to use he needs somebody to look through he needs some mouth to speak so when Paul let's talk about Paul for a little bit Paul wasn't always Paul he was Saul but God's strategy is so good God picked Peter James John and all of these brothers they were uneducated they couldn't write they couldn't teach so God needed somebody to write the New Testament so he had to find an academic he had to find a writer so God in his strategy found a man called Saul in the eyes of the theologians he wasn't qualified he wasn't with Jesus but that was God's man you may be seated God could never change his strategy so what you where you were born is a part of his strategy where you work is a part of his strategy your condition is a part of his strategy because something is being unfolded Hallelujah you may be seated brother over preacher Masterpiece last week the breaking of Heaven's silence and while he was speaking dedicated me the strategy of Silence because silence itself is a strategy God loves to use silence to Veil what he's doing right now there might be silence over your life and nobody knows what's going on but there's a strategy God can never change his strategy so when it looks like you don't have the Holy Ghost and it looks like you're not going to make it that's God's strategy because he want to prove uh that he's the same yesterday he is the same today he is the same forever and the battle is not yours but it's the Lord's you may be seated you may be seated for a minute I love that when the battle is not yours that's no wonder you may be seated God could say I will restore sayth the Lord it has nothing to do with your effort nothing to do with your ability nothing to do with your prayers nothing to do with your action this is God saying I've watched the battle for a long time but now I'm stepping in because it's not your battle there was war In Heaven There was war in heaven and Michael fought and the dragon fought and that war dropped down here and we have been caught in a battle we have been caught in the crossfires but the battle is not ours it's the Lord [Applause] Hallelujah I feel religious I feel Pentecostal I feel Baptist Methodist everything mixed up in one because God Moved Through the Ages to bring it all to this spot when he will break the silence break the seals break the Mysteries and uncover who you are that you were born for such a time as this and can the devil stop it because the devil cannot change his strategy oh my you may be seated oh you don't hear me this morning Holy Ghost and Fire Daniel Holy Ghost and power listen you may be seated the devil thought he had Daniel when he was put in the Lion's Den it was the devil's strategy that Daniel ended up there but God's strategy that's why I read the scripture for my thoughts and not your thoughts neither are my ways like your ways for as the heaven is higher than the Earth so is my thoughts above your thoughts you could never figure out what God is doing but just trust God this morning that he has never changed his strategy he's still healing he's still fing he is still pouring out the Holy Ghost he's still saving the Sinners he can't stop it let me read something for you hallelujah hallelujah oh my Hallelujah God can change and that's a good thing he cannot change and that's a beautiful thing and the devil cannot change and that's a beautiful thing familiar scripture fixed match it's a fixed match hallelujah hallelujah if you have no money in your pocket don't worry God's strategy could never change when the disciples had no money to let them go fish and when they got the fish they had food and money cuz there was money in the fish how do you figure that out and God has never changed his strategy he said I've never seen a righteous forsaken nor his seed Bak bread God has never changed his strategy yeah a thousand fall on my right 10,000 I shall not be moved God has never changed his strategy some through the water some through the fire some through the flood but all through the blood God has never changed his strategy if you are all right today God didn't come for you because Jesus said the word of the Lord is upon me because he had anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he had sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight of the Blind and to set at Liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord and God has never changed his strategy so he's still here this morning to lift you up uh he's still here this morning to give you Deliverance uh he is still here this morning to break the chains upon your life hallelujah hallelujah oh my my my my my my thank you this message is encourage you this morning because the devil listen the Bible say we are not ignorant of Satan's devices right that itself tells you a lot there's no device for the ger that the devil has that he could bring what that we are ignorant of all right it's the same things every time lust of the eye lust of the flesh pride of life he makes the ingredients different but the same thing we are not ignorant we know what he's trying to do we know he's trying to stop you but God is the greatest strategist that he ever ever ever ever is was will be he is the same yesterday today and forever Alpha and Omega and what I want to get to you because many people complain but the ROM preach the message why are people so tossed about anybody ever read that one amen he preached another one called letting off the pressure because life is meant to be a struggle and when I read the scriptures with the Kang I can't find a scripture to support this easy view of Christianity Amen Hallelujah Jesus Hallelujah my I want read something here in Hebrews 11 by faith the Hal rahad the Hal Rahab perish not with them that believe when she had received the spies with peace but what shall I more say for the time would Fe me to tell of Gideon and of Barack and of Samson and of jeffi of David also and Samuel and of the prophets who through faith subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained promises Stu the mountain out of lions quenched the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong wax Valiant in fight turned to fly the armies of the aliens women received their dead race to life again and others were tortured not accepting Deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection and others had trial of cure of cruel mockings and scourgings ye moreover of bongs and imprisonment they were stoned they were sown aunder were tempted were slain with the sword they wandered about in sheep skins and goat skins being destitute Afflicted tormented of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and in mountains and dens and caves of the earth and these all having attained a good report through faith receive not the promise God having provided some better thing for us that day without us should not be made perfect and as I was studying this and trying to get my heart and mind in line with what God wanted to say this morning I realize that the resume of these brothers is not the resume many of us want to have they were beaten they were scourged they were this happened and that happened and the moment we have one trial we want to give up when we have one trial we want to backslide when we have one situation we want to give but these considered it not to accept Deliverance that they might obtain a better Resurrection in other words the Revelation in their heart of who God was and who they were and the fath ha in their soul was so real to them that it didn't matter what the trial was it didn't matter what the testing was and I got good news for you God has never changed his strategy so there are no shortcuts amen there's no easy way no wonder the prophet say he could turn your wife against you he could turn the church against you there's no shortcut but God is going to have character out of somebody in such a time as this can the church say Amen oh oh blessed be the name of the Lord so in the message perfect strength by Perfect weakness but AB brandom said God's strategy is to take empty human vessels so God has a strategy is to take empty human vessels and shake the world with them like he did at Pentecost what did he do it taken them 10 days to get all emptied up but they were all standing there with their vessels turned up and God took himself and filled them up that's all and they shook the world God p pour himself into them and that's the same thing God wants to do this morning find some empty vessels that's his strategy individual that he could use individuals that he could fill can the church say amen hallelujah so I want to talk a bit about God's strategy there are so many of them we can't get to them all this morning but I want to talk about the strategy of solitude because many of us we want to be in a group and part of something and we realize that God's strategy is to call individuals and for God to call you as an individual you can be with everybody else so God has a strategy of solitude I call it when Jacob was ready to reach a certain Junction of his time after he was blessed and he was with his family God forced the issue that he had to leave where he was to go back to his land because he was not in his land and as he's going back he hears word that his brother Esau who looked at him funny who thought he was a no good Rascal was on his way to find him so Jacob cut his risk and divided his family and divided the people he send this one this way send his wife this way and the Bible said Jacob was left alone and it might seem sometimes when you end up by yourself you want to ask the question where is God and why did this happen to me but that was God's strategy because what God wanted to do something for Jacob and he couldn't do it when he was with everybody else he couldn't do it when he was with his friends he couldn't even do it when he was with his wife because he had to send his wife away he sent his children away he sent his wealth away and the Bible said Jacob was left alone and when you are left alone in your prayer closet when you were left alone in your trial and you could no longer talk to anybody else that's the best time that God could speak to you so if you are in alone time right now and nobody seems to understand and there's nobody to talk to get courage this morning because God has never changed his strategy he God will do whatever he has to do to bring you to the spot where he could get the Holy Ghost on the inside of you somebody say amen God is not speaking to the group he speaking to individuals so you may be seated so if you can call yourself aside if you can pull yourself aside if you can separate from your connections and from the worldly associations God has wa to turn the pressure on to increase the stress in your life to force you to come alone because when you're by yourself the same thing with John on the aisle of pmos Peter wasn't there and James wasn't there but when John was alone he heard a voice say come up here I've been waiting a long time to talk to you but I waited till nobody else was around that's God's strategy so there are some people here this morning God is bringing you to a spot to pull you like Moses by the pillar of fire his wife wasn't there in that encounter come on Church Oh My My My and God has never changed his strategy you may be seated God is not filling a group he is filling individuals uh he's not baptizing a group he's baptizing individuals uh he's not calling a group he's calling individuals can the church say amen and God has never change his strategy you read the scripture it's first name basis individuals Abraham Isaac Jacob David Joshua Joseph are you hearing me this morning Caleb Elijah first name basis I want God to say Isaac not talking about that one but talking about me first name basis individual Anthony who's he talking about papwell yeah that's right individual but to be called out like that you got to be to stand alone you may be seated I told them in maraval there are some people if they don't get one service they backslid because they can't stand on their own right but God wants you to stand anywhere but the brandom said John was in the is of pmos he was by himself but he was in the spirit on the Lord's day he didn't need a song leader to say let's get ready he didn't need to say somebody let's go to church no he was there in prison and he was still in the spirit Peter was in prison still in the spirit Paul was in prison still in the spirit can the church say Amen everybody with me this morning we're going somewhere this morning God has never changed his strategy Hallelujah God has another strategy I call it the secret agent strategy God knew that the children of Israel would be be without food right because God is thinking so far ahead he know that in order to get the children of Israel to pass through Egypt to break Egypt and to take him to the promised land he would have to in order to get the children of Israel into Egypt it had to be a famine and all of this God already worked out but in order for the famine to come and for the children of Israel to have food you have to have a right man in the right place amen so Joseph is growing up now all right he doesn't know what he's born to do he has no clue what his purpose all he knows he has these profound dreams and when if he tell these dreams the brothers around him get little bothered about him because this boy a little too spiritual he always seemed to be worshiping they could find no fault with Joseph the Kang and he's saying I had this dream and this one bowed down and and his father loved him gave him a coat but his brothers took him his own Brothers it wasn't the enemy it wasn't his neighbors his own brothers who he grew up with he play Pitch with them he played Nintendo with them he play play with them he thought they were cool his same Brothers he grew up and throw him into the pit am amen amen so don't feel bad if your brother throw you in hallah don't feel bad if somebody you didn't expect to you something they didn't even know that they were doing something in God's strategy and there Joseph he's in the pit he wasn't excited he wasn't happy he's feeling sorry for himself he say I didn't do this it wasn't my fault I was just worshiping I was I didn't give myself the dream the dream came to me and here I am no coat locked up and then they sold him into slavery he ends up in Egypt he didn't plan to be there he ends up poy for wife make a move you run for his life still get in trouble Joseph not making any mistakes here now but this is God's strategy Joseph in prison he's being tested he's being tried because there's a throne waiting for him that he doesn't even know about and while in prison he can't even get out of spirit dreams are coming and he's still interpreting the dreams he is still anointed in the midst of his [Applause] trial so brother Isaac this morning I'm in a trial I'm in a test I'm in prison keep worshiping keep praising the battle is not yours it's not about you the battle is not yours it's the Lord's God God is seeing Joseph's brothers the see ones who sold them out he's seeing his cousins his nephews the whole family and Joseph is there you may be seated he tells them when you get back into Power remember me and God's strategy he wipes the memory of the butler don't remember him yet not time yet amen amen until the king reaches a crossroad he has a dream and the wise men can interpret it the ministers can interpret it the Bishops can and the butl there but wait a minute wait a minute there's somebody in prison his name is Joseph he says send for Joseph and when Joseph time come he didn't even know what he was walking into he didn't know what to expect they shaved his Beed and they get Joseph ready and Joseph didn't even know not many days hence he was going to be on the right hand of pharaoh can the church whether they like it or don't like it it didn't change the fact that God was positionally placing him to be there to deliver his family Hallelujah stop looking at your trial stop looking at your situation God wants to use you to deliver your family to deliver your loved ones it's not about you the battle is not yours it is the Lord's cander church say [Applause] amen [Applause] hallelujah I want you to stop asking yourself the question why me Hallelujah why this happened to me why why why this happened to me and this other person looking you don't even know what trial they're going through but they look like they on a shouting every time you see them they shouting you don't even know every time they shout is their way of getting air because they under so much of a different kind of pressure and you think you are under so much trial and God is saying like there's a there's a there's a image that goes around with somebody saying God but Lord you're hitting me with this like a stone or whatever this is the rock or the whatever that's coming against me say Lord why it's so big and then you see the other scene is like God holding back some bigger rocks he said like the smallest one that one just slipped through and you think your trial is the biggest trial and God is making sure that you can get more than you could bear and whatever he allows your way he knows your shoulders could handle it stop saying you go dead and you're not going to make it and you go backslide you you barely me you drag yourself you didn't drag yourself to church it was the grace of God brought you here this morning you couldn't even bring yourself somebody say Amen you didn't bring yourself this morning you can wake up you may be seated I've said it before don't ever say your alarm clock woke you up heard a preacher say one time take an alarm clock to The Mug and put the alarm clock on and see what happens nobody's going to get up it's the Lord who woke you up this morning he put breath in your lips and life and you don't want to shout you don't want to worship you don't want to praise God listen what God wants from you is worship you know you may see it for a minute let me put this scripture in context about the Battle Is Not Yours as the Lord in 2 Chronicles 20 amen we're going to read a little bible scriptures this morning it says it came to pass after this also that the children of Moab and the children of Ammon and with them other besides the Ammon came against Jehoshaphat to battle there a whole host Then There came some that told Jehoshaphat like you know brothers who come to encourage you then they came some that told Jehoshaphat they commit a great multitude against thee they didn't say against us know they come they come in a great multitude against thee it's like if you you staying we going amen there cometh a great multitud against thee from Beyond the Sea on this side Syria and behold there be in hazon which is and and stuff and Jehoshaphat feared and set himself to seek the Lord and proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah and Judah gathered together to ask help of the Lord even out of all the cities of Judah they came to seek the Lord you know when things are desperate when everybody comes out out of every city in Judah they all find themselves coming out because it's a great crisis can the church say amen and Judah gathered himself together to ask help of the Lord even out of all the cities and Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem in the house of the Lord before the new court and said oh Lord God of our fathers add not thou God in heaven and rulest not thou over all kingdoms of the Heathen and in thy hand is there not power and might so that none is able to withstand thee amen hallelujah hallelujah at Art not thou Our God who didst drive out the inhabitants of this land before thy People Israel and givest it to thy seed of Abraham thy friend forever and they dwell therein and have built the a sanctuary daring for thy name saying if when evil cometh upon us as the sore of judgment or pestilence or famine we stand before this house and in thy presence thy name is in this house and he goes on and on and on Amen it is after this great prayer we reach the verse that I read at the beginning he said harken ye this is when the Lord spoke now and he inhabitants of Jerusalem and Thou King Jehosaphat thus say the Lord unto you be Not Afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude for the battle is not yours but God's now listen closely now it's going somewhere tomorrow amen tomorrow now the battle is not yours it's the Lord's but this is your part so we're getting to your part for the victory tomorrow go ye down against them amen right they come up by the Cliff of zes I'm telling you exactly where they come in all right and ye shall find them at the end of the brook before the Wilderness of juel ye shall not need to fight in this battle I'm not hearing you this morning you shall not need to fight in this battle set yourself standing still and see the salvation of the Lord with you oh Judah and Jerusalem fear not nor be dismayed tomorrow go out against them for the Lord will be with you can the church say amen and Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground and all Judah and in the inhabitants of Jerusalem be fell before the Lord worshiping the Lord and the Levites of the children of the Kites and the children stood up to praise the Lord God of Israel with a loud voice on high and they Rose early in the morning and went forth Into the Wilderness and as they went forth Jehoshaphat said stood and said hear me oh Judah and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem believe in the Lord your God so shall he be established believe His prophets so shall he prosper and when he had consulted with the people he appointed singers unto the Lord and that should praise the beauty of Holiness as they went out before the Army to say praise the Lord for his mercy endureth forever and listen and when they began to sing and to praise the Lord set ambushments against the children of Ammon Moab and mount serir which will come against Judah and they were smitten let me read it again and when they began to sing and to praise the Lord set ambushments so the battle is the Lord's but we then we begin to sing and we begin to praise then the ambushments as sent to wipe them out you don't hear me this morning once they begin to sing and to worship God took the battle over you don't hear me this morning and you don't want to worship and you don't want to praise brother I'm worshiping this morning I hear the sound of the abundance of rain and listen God has never changed his strategy once you worship once you give God praise ambushments send to your home ambushments send to your family ambushments send to your children ambushments sent to that cancer in your body ambushments sent to that female condition ambushments sent sent sent they are being released this morning because the rejoicing of the Lord is in the Tabernacles of the righteous I shall not die but live to declare the works of the Lord this is the day that the Lord hath made no trial no weapon no demon formed against you could ever Prosper because it's not your battle the Lord is powerful he is mighty in battle he is my shield he is my buckler he is my defense he is my strong tower he is my Fortress he is my great deliverer and he has never lost a battle yet and God can never change his strategy Give the Lord a shout of [Applause] Praise You may be seated hallelujah hallelujah Hallelujah everybody feeling fine we now know why we come to church right to get encouragement for us to be worshippers because God means object of worship how could you come to church without worship how could you come here without praise yes you have problems that's understood you have trials you have un understood you have needs that understood but that doesn't change the fact that he's worthy of worship he's worthy of Praise My problem is bigger than your problem we're not debating that right now we leave that for later on but right now we're dealing with the fact that he is worthy he is worthy he is worthy of the praise he is Alpha and Omega he is beginning and the end he is the first and the last the rose of shon the lily of the valley the Bright Morning Star he is worthy he is worthy once the Praises go up the glory comes down uh you could be here worshiping and the glory descends in your home you could be here worshiping and the glory descends on your job when you walk into to work tomorrow it's a different place because God is obligated to send ambushments once the worship goes he can't help himself the ambushments you may be seated I don't think people really understand that God is Tied by his own law all right all right all right Hallelujah my Jesus his movements are restricted by his word because his word is absolute so when the Centurion Roman came to Jesus and said I'm not worthy right for you to come under my roof just speak the word Jesus he he said I haven't seen Faith like this but when you touch faith and you speak to me in that language I have no choice but to respond doesn't matter if you in church out of church backsliding Ro on Jewish when you speak to me in that language I have no choice but to answer he said I haven't seen Faith like this go thy way your servant is healed I can't even pull it back you touch the right buttons you dial the right number and you have to get the right response you may be seated so the woman with the issue of blood there was no precedent for her she did not read about this she didn't study this somewhere but she told herself she tapped into a law she didn't even realize if you shall say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt it your heart so she told herself without even reading the scripture if I could just Touch the Hem of His Garment within her heart she already made a withdrawal of healing so when she got to Jesus and she touched Jesus all of a sudden Jesus felt the bank account level drop he said who touched me I felt somebody made a withdrawal I felt virtue left me Peter without Revelation said but everybody touching you he said no this is different I couldn't even help myself it happened without me even realizing that somebody was in the ATM about to do a transaction so when the money came on the cash register I was like who who made the [Applause] withdrawal you don't hear me this morning morning you don't hear me this morning you can make a withdrawal this morning you can make a withdrawal this morning you could touch Jesus this morning tell him what you want reach out this morning God has never changed his strategy he's going to release power he's going to release the Holy Ghost listen to what the prophet said he said amen hallu brother brother B said if he healed a man at any time through the Journey of life let it be in the days of Jesus the apostles the prophets whenever it was when the same conditions is met he's got to do it again that's right he doesn't change man changes time changes age changes dispensation changes but God Remains the Same he is perfect what a hope that ought to give the sick people amen if he ever healed a person he has to do it again when the same condition is met and I believe this morning God is healing sick people in here this morning I'm not saying he will do it he is doing it because he cannot change his strategy Hallelujah brother BR said he ever saved a man he's got to do it the same grounds he did it the first time if he ever filled a man with the Holy Ghost he's got to do it on the same grounds he did the first time if he ever raised a man up from the grave he's got to do it the second time and every other time on the same principle he doesn't change oh what a hope that gives me what is it not in some man-made fairy some of that groups of man have come together but his unchangeable word can the Church Say Amen everybody feeling fine I'm all over the place this morning strategy yes so when you study this you realize that you could find yourself in scripture hallu hallu you know you are in scripture if you're not in scripture then you knowwhere Hallelujah but not just in scripture as in we use the people that know their God shall do exploits and that speaks about you that's true but the Bible is it's a powerful book because within there you have to see your life and your situation be it in prison like Joseph amen not understanding what you're going through Hallelujah being like Samson call for a specific purpose Jesus but losing the burden losing the vision Samson was so confident in his ability he lost the confidence and the burden and the plan and just relied on his ability hallelujah amen and God allowed Samson to be caught all right because in God's mind he saw the all of the Philistines and the Lords of the Philistines being destroyed I want you to picture for a minute the Bible said that there were 3,000 amen caught up there brother kangi when Samson was brought to to make sportall I wonder what would have happened if Samson was not a prisoner and Samson was still in his strength and still in the way they knew him years before if he had walked into that same building on that day you know what would have happened they would have all ran out of that building so fast Amen brother they would have pulled all the fastest Chariot and Caravans because it was concentration risk for all the Lords to be in one place but God foresaw all of this and he say you know what to take out all of the laws of the Philistines in one shot I need to take a man through certain trials certain testings Behind Enemy Lines take out his eyes listen so Samson is there he knows the glory he knows the power he's the only man to lift up Gates Hallelujah open the lion's mouth he's the only man to pick up a Jawbone and Hallelujah when he looked at the jawb and looked at the enemy they didn't know what was going to happen next but when he start to fight they say this is not what we expected this was this man called Samson but after it all brother kangali Samson started off good like many Christians do amen Amen on fire anointed inspired but lust of the eyes lust of the flesh pride of life the devil sent a woman Hallelujah to wrap him up and it was it first it was inocent know if you time a here inside call them Samson pH but he was having fun yes until it was no more fun that's good that's good right no more fun because it wasn't all that once this lady didn't come and tell Samson Samson I want to cut off your hair so that you could become a prison of the Phil if you said he was going to run that's right but it was subtle like many of us allow subtle things into our lives amen and it comes in all easy all innocent just friends just friends are you a Christian no that's good I have a lot of Christian friends systematic destruction of your defenses yes yes yes and Samson found himself in a position going back and forth back and forth until his hair got cut off but I want to say something this morning don't write off anybody don't write off anybody Samson is there in prison and the Philistines write him off yes the devil wrote him off even Believers or enough yes was an evangelist they take his tapes out the church nobody talking about Samson anymore all they hear Samson backslide yes Samson the one who putting the gate and thing yes Sams some woman tie up Samson Samson there in the prison Samson written off you know nobody go and check Samson in prison but while Samson is in there God's strategy you know it takes Years brother Karen to put a spy Behind Enemy Lines somebody takes 30 years for the man to work himself up the ranks in a foreign government years born there he was he went there with he a child and he fit in his family and stuff and his years and years and they get you're not activated until you get the code to get activated for whatever government you for now you're in place you've been there for 20 years this is when you go and hit the nuclear war and it take years so God now has this strategy Behind Enemy lines and Samson is finally in place grinding at the Mill and he still don't know what his mission is and he feeling sorry for himself like many of us we saying I remember when I was in the fire I remember back in 83 when the Holy Ghost part and we ran around the building I remember 93 I remember 200 I remember the convention I remember pen Harris I remember all these revivals and you're grinding at the Mill you don't know how you end up here you remember when you were Usher when you were Deacon when you on fire when your wife was with you when your husband was you only was in church and you're grinding at the Mill your hair has been cut off your eyes have been blinded God took away your natural eyesight so that now all of a sudden you have a spiritual eyes and then something begins to open up to you and then you feel one day you come to a service like just any other day and they say Samson come and we want to carry outside and Samson D to make sport because the enemy never thought Samson was going to be anything anyway the whole concept of making sport is when you finally catch somebody and you feel you have them and Samson is there and his last breath he said leave me to the pillars and but the Bram said Samson saw a possibility he saw something and while Samson was there all of a sudden he began to pray once more Lord and then all of God's strategy just snapped God had finally had a man in place to finish the Philistines with a popwell all the trials all the testings when it looked like God was not there God was doing something with his life under silence when they wrote him off God was doing something with him and he began to hold onto the pillars he began to shake the pillars he say once more Lord what the devil didn't realize is that Samson here was growing back under silence nothing looked like it was happening but under silence throughout the trial throughout the mistake throughout the backsliding moment his hair was growing out because God's purpose will always be accomplished and God has never lost one [Music] [Applause] yet you may be seated oh Hallelujah God's strategy will never be defeated so don't write off anybody you keep praying for people don't talk about people yes see what he doing now what's she doing now what good no no no no no no no no no that's not your place just pray Lord let your will be done Lord keep me keep them keep us until that day but Lord we worship you we praise you that's your attitude because you don't know what secret mission God has everybody on you don't hear me this morning you don't know what secret mission God has you and your family on for his honor and for his glory Samson killed more in his death than in his life and you know what for all of Sam backside him he's going to be over there I'm looking to shake his hand oh you don't hear me this morning we preached it before no matter David's mistakes he was still a man after God's Own Heart God wiped his record clean God loves to ripe your record [Applause] [Music] clean you may be seated God hallelujah God's strategy hallu we still under the secret agent strategy could you take some more I have 992 strategies Jesus just kidding we talked about the soul to Paul at the beginning amen how God had to find somebody who could write Peter was not that man right he had to find somebody to write the bul of the New Testament so Saul was the academic training the right place the right experience he had the wrong Doctrine but he was the right man Saul thought he was doing the right thing understand this H you could be totally convinced that you're right and still be wrong so Saul is there when Steven is killed he's like that's him that's Steven the Deacon from the church that's him that's the one to kill right so I want you to understand the Paradox of how God works when SA becomes Paul and turns up in church you know the Bible said the Believers had they struggle to accept him and that's a lesson for us you know because God will deliver some people and I know some of you will [Applause] struggle on now we in the word now the Bible said the Believers struggled it was turn around greet your brother andow you imagine how Paul felt and he was the messenger to the first church age and the Believers in the church who walked with Jesus talked with Jesus had issues with This Man Called Paul yes until Paul actually had to just keep growing in Grace and Ministry until he reached the point that he could straighten Peter out and say Peter you can't come down and tell the Gentiles stuff from Jerusalem I was not with Jesus but the same Jesus that met with you met with me my approval is not from the brothers in Jerusalem my Ministry is not to Jerusalem my gift is not to Jerusalem but Paul the Apostle to the [Music] Gent my March and orders are not from Jerusalem don't put me under Jerusalem Doctrine my instructions come from a God and if any Angel preach anything other than what I'm saying let him be a curse let this be the [Music] absolute you may be seated you understand the sovereignity of God that he could take somebody who was responsible for killing deacons Hallelujah and using them as the Apostle The Benchmark that brother brandham at the seven Church eight could say I preach what Paul preached and that Paul was the gold standard the standard by which every single messenger has to be measured This Man Called Paul and you want to tell me your past God can't turn it around and God can't use you and you're not going to make it and your mistakes is too much God could use anybody and God has never change his strategy God loves to take the unexpected people and fill them with the Holy Ghost and give them power and give them Grace and give them an anointing give them a Ministry [Applause] you may be seated and it will speak for itself always way does it will speak for itself can the church say Amen you love the word some growing up to the way so God you know that's why brother brand said God will send things into the church that's a strategy to try the church so when God sent Paul into the church he was trying the church you need more love amen amen he need more grace you need more forgiveness don't hold Arts don't hold grudges how will God know if you have the tendency to hold grudges unless he send somebody that you could be grudging you could only be proven if there's a test let me say that again what's in you could only be proven when there's a test right so if God want to test your ability to forgive you has to send a situation where it's going to take everything in you to forgive because he wants to prove that you have the character amen and God has a responsibility to test because you cannot graduate without passing a test Jesus himself had to be tested and you don't want a test his whole Wilderness experience was a test that's right amen and Jesus passed the test overcame lust of the eye overcame lust of the flesh overcame pride of life check check check a a a pass pass on M Transfiguration adoption hallah and you want to pass the class no Wilderness but it says all the time many of us are being Tri and is not yet sent to the Wilderness you will know when it's sent to the Wilderness your child just become really different but when you're ready for Wilderness know that power is on the other end returning in the power of the spirit because the test is to make sure that when God give you power and Paul walks in the church and say that was Paul was Steven bind him because right now that your instinct you know and you have to let God deal with individuals God deal with people's lives because you don't know listen carefully what mission God has them on because everybody is on a mission because everybody has a purpose and they all pieces on God's chest board canand the church say Amen could you take some more so I just going to touch on two more then close out with the strategy of silence and connect to brother ob's message last week the breaking of Heaven silence so God loves to make it look like you're finished Daniel the Hebrew boys they all thought they were finished the devil thought they were finished he closed the book and say they're done and then Daniel comes out the next day and the Hebrew boys there's a for man in the fire they say where did that man come from we didn't put him there God's strategy and he never changes his strategy he chooses unlikely people the woman at the well Rahab The Prostitute so don't count yourselves off friends I want to speak about the strategy of silence and I'll begin to close out silence Abraham touch it last week for 25 years he was under silence and the Bible did not say that Abraham staggered not it said he staggered not at the promise of God so it doesn't mean that Abraham didn't have up days and down days but when it came to the promise of God there was no compromise and that's how we must be with the trials that come our way Glory you will have updates you will have down days you'll have days it seems all confusing and all messed up but don't stagger at the promise of God because that is what will keep you alive that is what will keep you through the trial it is not realistic to tell you you will never stagger that's not real there will be up days there will be down days there will be days you wonder I wonder if you're going to make it but don't stagger at the promise of God Amen but in that thing be strong and give praise Hallelujah that you're going to be healed Hall that the promise say you're going to get the Holy Ghost that the promise says we're going to have a Revival that the promise says one of these days your body is going to be changed don't stagger at that if you stagger with your job that's all right but don't stagger at the promise of God if you make mistakes in your home that's all right but don't stagger at the promise of God can the church say Amen everybody feeling fine so I want to connect now to about always message last week the breaking of Heaven silence and he read the scripture about silence in heaven for the space of half an hour and I preached on this sometime last year about how every good director knows how to use Sound and Music and silence to create the right effect because if you playing and you're conducting a choir there are times you want to stop to create a pause so when the music resumes it creates a certain Symphony a certain Harmony a certain Melody and on the seven day the Bible says there was silence in heaven for the space of half hour so God brought an interlude a pause a space of silence and if you go back through the Old Testament in the days of Noah God was silent until he couldn't take it no more he allowed what happened to happen under silence because it was part of his strategy because in his mind he wanted to baptize the Earth all right and he had to have a reason to do so so he allowed the sin to grow until he couldn't take it no more he had watched for a long time but now he had found a righteous man in place that he could not break his silence and say build an ark I'm to baptize the Earth in the days of Moses for 400 years they were in bondage Moses had 40 Years of Silence but then God broke the silence amen can the church say amen and for many years in the message it would seem like we have been living under silence yes where are the Miracles where are the signs where are the Wonders where is the Dynamics that's been prophesied and we've been living under the testimony of Jesus with the spirit of Prophecy under the ministry of the word which is period of Silence Hallelujah because there's a Time coming of Dynamics there's a Time coming of power there's a Time coming when the silence comes to an end there was silence on Gideon's life there was silence in Abraham's life there was silence in Isaac and Jacob's life there was silence in Israel because golad had them pinned down nobody was moving only Goliath was speaking send me a man to fight me and all of Israel was covered in silence until David said said I am that man and God broke the silence with David can the church say amen and I'm saying this morning God is getting the ra to raise to break the silence not just on the bride but on individuals the silence that has kept you quiet thinking that your sickness is your promise is over we are going to break the silence this morning because if I hold my peace the rocks are going to cry out so I'm not going to be silent anymore I'm going to begin to declare I'm going to overcome I'm going to begin to declare I'm going to be healed by Stripes I'm Healed the silence is breaking this morning can the church say amen glory the Old Testament closes with words that hold meaning special meaning to us behold I send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to their fathers lest they come and smite the Earth with a curse amen and these prophetic words held scripture between a Chasm of the Old Testament and the new and for 400 years there was silence for 400 years there was no message from God for 400 years no Prophet arose to give God's word for 400 years no angel came and visit the people it was just silence and like the Calm before the storm God was getting ready to break his silence can the church sayen I'm not talking about man breaking the silence but I'm talking about God breaking the Silence of the SE on your life and when God gets ready to break the silence he does it a certain kind of way here comes God drops down the angel Gabriel to speak to Zachariah and his wife Elizabeth amen hallelujah because God is about to unfold something poor Elizabeth had lived with the Decades of being a barren woman her definition was not Elizabeth the great cook it was Elizabeth the baron woman it was a pain to her that she couldn't have a child and Zachariah husband was groan and travailing because he knew he wanted a son who would follow in his footsteps and he knew how his wife felt about it Zachariah was not somebody on the street he was a priest so he was in the house of God praying and and taring and seeking the Lord he understood as a priest that if you ask God for something God has an obligation to answer so he's there praying when the church comes together he's there praying he has he has a burden because he has a need and then all of a sudden one day he's there and then the a the angel Gabriel speaks to him do not be afraid Zachariah your prayer has been heard what an encouragement for after all your years of silence and crying and sighing to hear the angel of the Lord come and say don't worry brother kangali your prayer has been heard oh to know that God has heard your prayer that the vials of your prayer has been raised up and the perfume and the fragrance has reached to God and God is saying yes I'm ready to do something about it I'm ready to break the Silence of your baroness I've heard the cries of my people and I've come down can the church say Amen oh my don't be afraid Zachariah your prayer has been heard your wife Elizabeth will have a son and you are to give him the name John and this John in other words you may be SE could you imagine from baroness from a burden and then to be given a son who will have a message to make ready a people for the Lord a son to forun the coming of of the Messiah from baroness to a special kind of a son a son who will have the spirit of Elijah Zachariah was praying and he didn't even know how God is going to bless him beyond measure breaking the silence God uses the silence to do his work Hallelujah and Elizabeth is carrying child and meanwhile while this is unfolding C getting ready to talk to Mary Hail Mary th highly favored hallu because for years since the prophet spoke a virgin shall conceive there were silence in that scripture ministers would read the scripture and know it's in the word but they don't know how it's going to be fulfilled there was silence Discerning preachers could say one day of Virgin will conceive and people in church would hear it say maybe that's the word but we don't know how it's going to happen Lord preaching out of season but it's still the word so you have to say it oh you don't hear me this morning 600 years in the preaching of Virgin will conceive because the prophet spoke it and we believe the prophet but it was not the season yet so the ministers sounded kind of crazy but when the season changed what was now out of season became in season and for years we have been talking about adoption talking about perfection talking about the Resurrection talking about the power coming to the church and for all the years it's been out of season but under the testimony of Jesus the spirit of Prophecy we have been under obligation to speak it because the word must cover the people if the word doesn't cover the people there's nothing to connect it so Mary is walking by the well she is well versed with the scripture she knows a virgin will conceive so when Gabriel comes and say hail Mary thou are highly [Applause] favor the word in her soul the predestinated because brother Bram taught us that you are not the believer but the word in you is the believer so when the word is in you the word has no choice but to respond Mary you're going to have a child you're going to bring forth Messiah you're going to bring forth the Christ her only question was how shall this be and before the Holy Ghost was poured out on the day of Pentecost the angel dropped a mystery upon her the season has changed to hold ghost is going to overshadow thee because [Applause] the breaking the silence and Mary Mary's now anointed she's now inspired God could never speak to you and you keep it to yourself God can never speak to you and you go to the corner and stay quiet when God spoke to her but the terance she ran to her cousin Elizabeth eleth and say Elizabeth you wouldn't believe what happened to me I went to church Sunday morning and the angel came to me and told me I'm going to have a child told me I'm going to get the Holy Ghost told me I'm going going to get a breakthrough and his name is going to be called wonderful his name is going to be called counselor this thing is going to be of the Holy Ghost his name glory and listen the baby in Elizabeth's wound the seed of Promise was dead for six mon that was all part of God's strategy because there's power in the name of Jesus there's power in the name of Jesus so when Mary stand to talk about counselor Mighty God Everlasting father Prince of Peace Jesus wonderful that baby in Elizabeth strategy being on he is the resurrection and the life he's not even born yet but resurrection power locked up inside of Mary John come to life begin to Rejoice because he knows he knows that the Messiah is already on the earth can the church say Amen can the church say Amen can the church say Amen the Holy Ghost is on the move he was moving he was fixing things around for the Messiah to be established and but the BR said the same holy ghost that justified the lutherans that sanctify the wans that baptized the Pentecostals is Now setting in order for the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ and it will be a Breaking of the silence for all these years the devil think is church church church church message message argument this Minister that Minister but we are way beyond that this morning the silence we have held our peace for a long time uh but there's a voice that's about to speak there's a voice that's going to speak and that voice has power that voice has resurrection that voice has life that voice will go after your children that voice will go after that cancer that voice will go after that can the church say Amen the silence is going to be broken so for all these years since the prophet left brother popwell we have been placed under silence we all had expectation you may be see that brother Bram said it's so close I could almost feel it but the brandham thought that he was going to experience it he thought he was going to see it but it was not for him ministers came after many ministers and under the spirit of Prophecy they were obligated to speak the same thing to anoint the promises to the People by faith because that's the only way to do it but you cannot change a season before the time comes can the church say Amen they had to be in the upper room uh and they were praising God continually but when the day of Pentecost was fully come then the season changed I got news for you this morning all your life you have been waited for your day of Pentecost and one of these days I could must feel it it's going to come and you're going to experience a wonderful glorious baptism on the inside that will transform to the outside and this Mortal will put on immortality you don't hear me this morning these 16 elements will [Applause] become could you take some more I'm not finished yet hallah Hallelujah and I love how God does it and that's why you got to trust God because God does things in stages you know Jesus is born we we know the story Bethlehem and everything and then they silence all right we hear nothing when he's 5 6 seven years old 8 nine but then all of a sudden we see another snapshot the family comes to to worship and to come for one of the celebration whatever and then Jesus gets lost all right hall hallelujah it was their custom of the feast and Jesus gets lost and and and and I want you to understand Mary and Joseph were so caught up in the custom and the tradition and the service that they actually didn't realize that they lost Jesus amen caught up in the religious tradition so much that they real that Jesus is missing could you imagine it come to church brother kangali and Jesus is missing they came for a religious feast and left without Jesus and he's the reason for the season Hallelujah and the Bible said for about three days they travel away until it occurred to them but Joseph yes Mary where Jesus you don't have him [Applause] no around the car all right and that they head back and they find Jesus right where they left him Jesus wasn't playing PlayStation playing Nintendo running around with everybody else Jesus was in the temple confounding the elders yes what scripture is that no that doesn't mean that look back into that scripture way I never see that 40 years I'm a minister 12y old Jesus the Bible said confounding the ministers all of the ERS are there now because they're saying we hearing stuff we never knew was there but it's right because all the scriptures finally lining up I so all get confused and Jesus opening their understanding and when they come to Jesus they say what you doing here he said don't you know I must be about my father's business and then it's as if the director says cut there's nothing else for 18 years brother the Kang there's silence 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 we hear nothing about This Man Called Jesus amen till age 30 right till out of Silence God breaks it once again and out steps Jesus amen walking down Hallelujah watch John preaching a message the AXS must be laid to the tree repent there's one comingall and John is preaching Masterpiece after masterpiece all right John is a disruptor he's breaking tradition his messages people coming to take notes nobody ever preached that hard before if it don't bring forth fruit chop axe chop what they want to eat wild honey and lo Locust see this Minister different he too hard too rough but then John begins to break into the realm because the same holy say there's one standing among amen hallelujah whose shoes are not even worthy and then Jesus breaks the silence thank you in the wilderness Jesus is there and the devil is probing at Jesus if thou be he wants a response Hallelujah he wants a response and Jesus just Hedges it is written it is written if thou be the devil trying to get me to see who he is it is written it is written not breaking the silence he's playing his part he's just he's like playing cricket and he just he not ready to hit it out the park just yet all right all right but then after he comes to the Wilderness he breaks the silence because God loves to do it in a certain kind of way so he comes in and the Bible says I want to read it exactly because and Jesus returning the power of the spirit Luke 4 into Galilee and they went out the Fame of him all around the region around and he taught in his synagogue being glorified of all and Hallelujah and he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom was it wasn't something strange with a p he was always in church he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up for the read and there was delivered unto him strategy somebody actually pulled the book that he needed didn't know why he was pulling that book but he brought it and he found the place the book of The Prophet is that when open he found a place where it is written the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he had anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he had sent me to heal the broken hearted to preach Deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the Blind and set at Liberty bruise and to preach the acceptable of the Lord and when he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister and sat down and all the eyes that were in the synagogue were fastened on him and then he began to say to them this day is the scripture fulfilled in your ears amen and he broke the silence amen because they had heard that scripture many times before but never was there anybody who said this day this scripture is fulfilled and he said Not Another word and from there was just signs wonders and miracles amen and that's how God breaks am the silence amen I'm getting ready to why now now can the church say Amen can we give the Lord a hand of Praise so but brandham taught us music the musician can get ready that a seal signifies a finished work all right a seal signifies approval and he spoke up the box car and said when it is filled the right way it is sealed until its destination and the seal is necessary to protect what's on the inside until the time appointed yes for it to be opened in other words you're not to touch it until it reaches its destination and we know that Seven Seals was the book of Redemption yes so only when you open a seal and look at the contents could you know what's redeemed in that seal all right so the first seal to the fourth seal identified how Satan infiltrated the church by the Antichrist spirit with four Riders White Horse red horse black horse Pale Horse and though Satan caused havoc in the church God still did a work of redemption we know that God sent a lion ox man and eagle and a great drama was being unfolded when he open the fifth seal we see another work of redemption the Redemption of the Jews The Sixth Seal is to come is a judgment seal but when he open the seventh seal there was silence amen hallelujah because under the silence under the radar visible yet invisible the God that was once invisible silent was doing something Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he had Chang form once again and a work of redemption was going on Amen every other seal had symbol but the seven seal is Christ amen so the Lord himself descended with a shout amen could it be that you became that living symbol Hallelujah that in there was the bride to a sign of going back to Eden back to the spoken word can the church say Amen brother brandom taught us every seal had a word A History A age a vision and a People yes the first to the fourth seal had their ages the church ages Lord is everybody with me this morning we're going somewhere the fifth seal has it age with the Jews The Sixth Seal is the age of the tribulation The Sixth Seal will have a history of only three and a half years but what about the seventh seal the seventh seal also has its history we can look back to the prophet can the church say Amen the seven seal as it age it's a bride age but hidden under that seal s is it time to break the silence to break it of Heaven silence what is this about church Adam lost the book Hallelujah Glory the book of power the book of redemption the book of name and Satan tried to grab it because if Adam did not fall he was going to take that book and call your name spoken word you were going to come forth but Adam lost the book and Satan tried to grab it but this book has Biometrics it's only certain people could handle this book so when the book Satan thought he had it because if Satan got the book he would have had your names but he was not authorized he didn't have the password he didn't have the permission to go into that book so the book fell back into the hands of the original owner It could only be viewed by certain people can the church say amen amen but even though the book had been taken back it needed a redeemer somebody authorized to open the book it had to be family to us because that was the law it could only be family to redeem you your neighbor can't redeem you not even a king could redeem you only your family could redeem you so when Jesus came as part of his strategy that never changes he became the kinsman redeemer he became your family when you had no family he your blood and his blood same DNA he could identify with you more than you could identify with yourself because he suffered amen so that he understands how you could suffer he went through pain so he understands your pain amen so he's not suffering in isolation he took your sin he took your pain he took your problem and as a Kings neighbor he died in your place and he dying there he said father it is finished and Heaven began a shake the Bible said there was an earthquake the Skies begin to change color the trees begin to move the plants begin to shake why you may be seated because the plants and the trees and nature they remember how it was when Adam was there nature remembers how it was when Adam was there and the whole of creation where the Jason is groaning and travailing for the manifestation of the sons of God but the sons of God cannot come forth until this book could be placed in the right hands so God's strategy from Genesis to Revelation from time out of Eternity was to place this book back into the hands of sons Place power back into the hands of sons for sons of God to step out and speak the way Adam spoke you may be seated you may be seated can the church say Amen everybody with me we we could take some more right Hallelujah one of these days where the Andrew will break into eternity and it wouldn't be time no more so for all the ages when Jesus was here we preached it before he took fish he said what do you have he said we have Five Loaves and two fish he said bring it he blessed it and he broke it and they ate it he took raw materials and he changed it he said what do you have water bring it turn it into [Music] wine but Adam didn't need raw materials because he's a Creator and Jesus could only do so much because for him to be complete he needs his wife but every law has to be fulfilled so in Jewish custom when the Harvest is about to come there has to be somebody waves the first crop to show that the rest are coming so in our day God also a strategy he placed a Inside Man everything we preached about God wrapped into his prophet he lost his wife he lost his child he lost the [Music] anointing but this same 20th century prophet he didn't need a squirrel to make another squirrel this same prophet he said let there be a squirrel and Heaven began to shake the Earth began to shake the trees began to shake because they recognize Adam is on the again brother pram didn't come just to demonstrate it he came to bring evidence that the new land is Within Reach and we have been living by the evidence of the new land the son of man The Silence has already been broken oh my everybody with me this morning you see why I'm excited why I'm encouraged why because there are people here brother the Joshua who will speak and see their worlds change they will speak to their homes they will speak to their families they will speak to their situation just like Lazarus was dead tied up and God's strategy he wanted to leave a secret for all of you who think the situation is so messed up there's no recovery he said you know what let me let me come on you know what the Bible said Jesus was in Lazarus Village a while before you know but when Jesus was there he ran into some problems with the people so when he heard that Lazarus was sick he didn't want to go because the last time he was there the people had issues with him all right but the delay was also deliberate because Lazarus had to die and when he heard Lazarus was dead he said now all the people who are there now I can go because the problems I have will disappear when Lazarus come forth yes that's what the Bible said Jesus couldn't go because the people are pro but when Jesus got there they all mour the same people who upset the whole neighborhood when Jesus got there they all mour so Mary and say if you had been here my brother would not have died he said roll away the stone and when Jesus said Lazarus come forth the critics the haters those who were upset with the message he preached before their mouths were shut you see Lazarus coming out like this they say I can't Vex with Jesus no more Lazarus is my boy Lazarus is my friend amen amen Lazarus was dead now he's alive and he was tied up they say loose him and let him go that's the voice that's coming into the bride can the church say Amen so I don't care what condition your son is in your wife your husband it doesn't matter they are coming out and even when they come out whatever still tiing them up we're going to loose them loose them let them go they're going to be free and God has never changed his strategy somebody say Amen you may be seated let me try to come to a close what time is it I a couple weeks ago I lost my watch so I start to lose track of time okay with a check on yeah I didn't bring the watch I'm preparing for eternity so the book could only be used by certain hand viewed by certain eyes so we needed a redeemer and John wept because when he looked around there was nobody worthy to take the book but then the bleeding lamb Ste forward and tore off the seals no wonder John shouted because he knew that finally the silence that was placed on the Earth from Adam's day was about to be broken can the church say Amen oh I'm about to finish out now everybody feeling fine my my my my my oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Hal hallelujah hallelujah so God is about to break the silence every Church age every Church age was leading up to this time now when God is about to break the silence to restore Fallen man back to his position never before could have been manifested Sons like this day now where Sons will speak and create where Sons will speak and deliverance will take place and brother said
