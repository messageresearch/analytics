brother precious brother green at this time may Allah bless you amen I greet you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to a virtual convention 2020 pastor Tilo has invited me Pastor Albert green from Bethlehem Tabernacle Trinidad and Tobago to share greetings to you by God's grace we certainly thank God for the host pastor and the congregation and we pray god's richest blessing as Saints for many nations join this convention God's richest blessing on the speakers and viewers I have been privileged over the last two years to attend some of these services and they have been a rich blessing and was certainly looking forward to be a part of the service this year the enemy taught that kovat 19 will hinder our fellowship but God created us for fellowship with him and with each other so we certainly want to turn God this morning today that nothing can hinder that fellowship we give thanks to God that we can tap in to the fourth dimension we are thankful for the opportunity to use these gadgets as God's prophet tell us when it's working with God they are natural blessings that God has given us we bless God for the theme of these services the time of life and we look at it human beings has two changes in life to our young ones the time of life take them to puberty a time of body change described as God's prophet as a reckless age dangerous time of life where there's that movement from boy to man from girl to woman described as a frantic age and an age that we all brothers and sisters we went through so as parents today and as leaders we are called to suffer with them and to bear with our young ones as they go through the stresses of that change and use the word of God to be a support and a comforter a direction to them time of life takes us to our second change which is called menopause a change described as the worst of all in that change the devil run our sister's crazy how many times in the discernment line we had God's prophet picking up sisters that claim that he had all sorts of problems all sorts of serious matters that afflicted them they told her everything was wrong but it took the disarmament line that God's prophet could tell him nothing really is wrong with them that what was their real concern that is not been described preparing them for time like that a real dreary feeling after a terrible feeling your nerves get ripped a time of extreme nervousness and with all of that identifying to them that is not really something that is wrong what it is at the time of life a time a men of season of childbearing it was at that time Sara was told you are going to be young again she was told that in 20 days your life will start all over again so in that this time of life for their sisters God's prophet instructed us husbands it is the time if you ever was a sweetheart you ought to be a sweetheart then identifying to us is the time oh wise need us is the time we ought to be heir with one another we also saw sister Rebekah speaking of a dad would call her and share with her the reasons for her mother's behavior the reasons for what is going on in the home and a rift explained to her what a mama's problems when it come to that time of life and a time of life also that time of life also affect us men definitely is not physically but it is the time that maybe we like to look through the mirror the time when we want to be young again and we force to make certain physical changes in our body it was at such a time because prophet tells us it was rock fellow that leave his wife to marry his secretary what about the time of life we spoke over the time of life of the human body the time of life of our changes what about the time of life on our spiritual journey God's prophet show us that naturally this time in our life we should be anchored we should be strong we should be at our very best we should be mellow out the kid back of us should be out anyway the childhood things should be outside that kind of part should be all beat note we should be at a season settlin we had our best for the Lord just to share a quotation from with you from the message just one more time Lord and God's prophet is telling us here he's Eve God come to me and I want you to go to hurt and I was up there and he said go to hurt I am going to give you a hundred years peace of the knowledge but I want you to LUT your years what years you want to take you want to take the first 25 the second 25 or the third 25 for the last 25 here it was God's providence showing us is if Illustrated that God would have asked him to choose a time of life to live if he would have chosen the first 25 the second 25 the third 25 for the last 25 and here identifying what a choice he would make say what would I say whenever I'm going to put my time here on a football player athlete or something I better take the first 25 if I'm going to be a carpenter or some pose like that I better take the second 25 but but if I want to serve the Lord I will take the last 25 from 75 to 100 why because I've accumulated much knowledge I know more about it see and as long as I go stand on my two feet and water water um what difference does it make how old I am I am here to serve the Lord that's good enough for me so he's identifying in time what does sort of choice he would have made as far as time is concerned what time of life way could be most useful to the Lord Jesus Christ so we look at all physical time of life we see times are changing nations change scenes change attitudes change or physical body change and we observe the course of human nature change but yet we turn God this morning for today what we're part of the world we are in what all we are here yet we contain God for the greatest change the change to be transformed the change to move this morning from a street singer to an angelic position and that change we went through a time of life those of us who faced with an experience a change that is called a paradox a change that is incredible it is unbelievable but yet it is true a miracle something that cannot be explained what a change God convert in your soul God change in my nature we read in the scriptures God lead in the chair of Israel without one feeble person that was it'd be rather what David challenged in Goliath we read about Moses in a one-man invasion we read about Samson killing a thousand Philistines with the jawbone of a mule we read of the Hebrew children in a fiery furnace we read about a floatin of the ark we read of this very earth being held all being great paradoxes yet the greatest products is to be a Christian God making a Christian all of us God converting us God change you know Anita it is like to tell a pig piggy you are no longer a pig but you alam kind of pig meat all is wrong to eat slop naturally if you bathe a pig you dress him with a suit did you authorize him that pig will go right back into the wallow that pig will go right back into that wallow again because wallow in his hog net yeah so as long as a hog remain a hog with the nature of a hog he will go right back to wall and that's the reason people continue wallowing so-called Christians continue wallowing in sin we continue wallowing in sin amen because it because the process did not go through how to keep your hog out of the model change his Nydia the pig Nature has to change the pig Tia has to change god bless you I realize I may have crossed my time but just to close off on time of life the happiest time of life is ahead of us together with the profit job I trust God will wait till our change come we wait our time of life we are promised a body change in a moment in a twinkling of an eye we are promised a sudden change we are promised that from the Word of God we go to unite with a

change even while he was yet alive Oh glory to God here that he got a body change while he was yet alive oh praise the name of the Lord so my title is time of life hallelujah Vanna inspiration is anything too hard for the Lord and this is becoming more more real is anything too hard for the Lord oh praise God is good to be here today email hallelujah praise God it has always been about the life always hallelujah Adam lost his life and inheritance in life what was inheritance sonship now Adam lost hallelujah when Adam disbelieved God by listened to his wife that books report of his hands hallelujah but what he really lost was his life the life was connected to the book but what he lost was his life and as he lost his life he lost his inheritance in life because the inheritance is in the life Oh glory to God no light no inheritance go inheritance is in the life do believe that you know it was dry for such a while and try that here and it's because you know you can just a few opposite me and XE dry dry dry and Marine begin to fall and overnight behold Phoebus green Oh hallelujah that life was always lay in the air it was tried air the fevers dry as ever you know they don't have to broadcast but they do have to cut it did after a long long cut it and whatnot they just have a wait until the rain and looking dead but tell the Rangers kid number four as falling Jesus reign hallelujah not on my water with chlorine in it but this Jesus reign once that fall on the ground green begin to pick up hallelujah look and try but but green life is laying right there hallelujah try explain life because I exact like but it is dear it's unfolds it reveals or glory to God isn't that right and the life was passing through the stalk and the tassel and the husk and the life was passing true it revealed justification and looter it reveals significant in Wesley it revealed a demon the Pupkin Holy Ghost in the Pentecostal Oh glory to God hallelujah forgive me tonight because something Oprah to me I'm so excited tonight it was the life passin true that produced a function of sanctification it was the light passing true that produced a doctrine of justification it was the life Oh glory the core and going to wrap the life with doctrines and teachings but it was the life okay the Lord show hallelujah and the masterpieces and the gospel is gonna come out you looter true Wesley into Pentecost in the last days brethren can't you see the wheat is the first beginning it's not like a seed when it begins to fall like the seed is the husk is denominated now the green seed in the original fell in Nicaea for it was the first nomination here we go notice here the life that was in the stalk and tassel ends up in the seed the life that comes out of the original seed comes two different processes three different processes and then turned back to its original condition Oh glory to God he said I am the happiest person in the world that God but let me see this Oh glory to God in other words God heads the life with testimonies with mysteries with doctrines with Asians but it was the life all along and the devil can't touch that or give the Lord a shout holla it doesn't touch that so when men break the word interfering body under of the life Oh glory to God do you see what I'm saying that's my god hear the word being broken because once you break the rubber wrote the word you pick the channel but the life calls true because the word is the conduct of the Spirit or get the Lord a show or chlorine oh god that's right the first thing the angels came to do was to gather the scattered word to get everything lined up glory of God do you see you tonight notice the life that was in the sauce in the stalk and in the testicles in the seed what one went to make the other justification Mira way for certification sanctification Mira way for the Baptists of the Holy Ghost and the PAP tamale goes man away for the Holy Ghost itself to come down in perfection and back to the word again so course objective is to bring the church back to perfection and it could only do that by his word Oh glory to God well my my my man so sanctified scientific ation was at auction of the life identified by John Wesley hallelujah justification was identified by the life Martin Luther Oh glory to God so Elohim came unveil himself in Genesis 18 hallelujah to make way for him to come back in Luke 17 today and feel himself in a profit sea mellow him hallelujah coming back again to speak to that bride to reveal Solomon to bring back original seed so he said the spoken word his original seed so that is why he said this is very important that the spirit and the prophet and the bride will say the same thing because the spoken word itself not the interpretation of the spoken word no no no no no no no the spoken word itself is the original seed so what is spoken by that prophet is not a prophet said that is hello him Oh glory to God I'm excited tonight hallelujah hallelujah and Elohim stole hallelujah Ellen pick up some dust that painted tell Sarah the telegram I will return unto thee according to the time of life because everything have a season and a time under heaven you can't force it you can't manufacture you can't bring it out the season and have a seasonal time or chlorine or color when the time of life isn't the season of the time of life no stop it your condition - puppet your body just puppet Sarah unbelief - stop it it shall come to pass come upon Sarah Leggett alors - oh it's gonna come upon that bride it's gonna come up on you go either God so after the Pentecostal each it produced different denomination after the Prophet gone the same spirit produce different interpretation hallelujah but the original life have to press on can you cast up life you put a brick on a tree it has twists and keep open up you'll drop a brick on a plant it just grew on the side so and sillier hallelujah your forces in a corner I'm still here you can't stop me you can put borders and me we could bury me you can't stop me there was something on the inside there's a jail money inside there's a seed on the inside it has caught the comfort or glory to God he may be mocking me being birthed a Libyan senior maybe none belief but you gotta come thought the sea wasn't a woman of the well that she wasn't blind bat Chema's that she wasn't drunk that seemed a sudden PETA the c1 and cuspid and fishermen teittleman okay the Lord show and I can't praise God this morning I can't prescribe today that series in me Oh glory to god and satan kappa stop so what's the secret what's the secret nobody's in the brain how did the word get in the brain under the teaching ring Allah he said we are no living at the time of the revelation of these things being made known okay the Lord a shout there's a time of ten of these things being made known but some point in time it's gonna spit over at the time of the harvest of these things that has been made known or plural accorded making known me making known in you as I see by revelation Oh glory of God because the Son of Man is still the sword of the good seed once a year Solomon is talking about saw oh give the Lord a shout hallelujah I never seed was sown it hasta la havas of that seed or calf fallen suicide or careful and lucky altar get tied up a pony some have to fall on could give the Lord a shout I am declaring that bride is control Oh hallelujah thank you lord so the son of man come to seat on a bride with promises knowing there's gonna be a time of lightning to bring every seed planted to be manifested in that bride the son of man came back in this last day as looked something 30 to reveal the mysteries written and hidden he revealed all the mysteries all of them so that makes us stewards of the mystery of God and the life is hid and connected to the mysteries the life has always been tied to the book the book that Adam lost was the book of life in it there was a blood section that's the lady elect or the elect lady not any church in particular but the body of Christ universal oh praise God from Chrysler revealing as one word he said we have got one of the most dreadful times to go through that ever leave before human beings I want to lay that out like a like a back like like her underline like a highlighted statement we have got one of the most dreadful times go through that ever lead before human beings and I am just waitin for the hour every penny Betty can get a chance where you can get off from work and spend a few DS or we could set up somewhere where I can speak on those plagues and things that's the fall in the last days and true about two or three weeks together and bring that together if the Lord let me live to do it I will spare me to see to inspire me to do so how these things will be trucked in on those thunders so he put the thunders in with the plagues the dreadful time or all that's coming in or let's continue now who is Elohim from the unveiling of God he said first Timothy 3:16 without controversy great is the mystery of godliness Elohim capital G he said it's Elohim in the beginning Elohim without controversy great is the mystery of Elohim for Elwin was made flesh and we handed him Elohim field in human flesh that great Jehovah that covered all space-time and everywhere was made man we handed him then in swich like Abraham could not see that Sun no science no pregnancy of Sarah not even menstruation periods or anything but yet God said so is anything too hard for the Lord a dead woman and God says she gonna vagina say I had to be with that and God say you will be healed your foot and moving years I'm gon say good behavior walk again Pauly Ord and you will be healed I've tumor and it will be healed I have cancer and it will be healed is anything too hard for the Lord I think we have to shake off the unbelief or glory they wanna be convinced that the seed of Abraham let me say good the royal seed of Abraham the faith is what was to be restored back into the Gentile bride church what kind of faith royal see faith or glory to God that nothing is impossible Oh hallelujah praise God listen to this the streams of life a womb was dead his life in him was gone the stream of his life had dried up and her life was tried up within her what about Christians who like their dead but they have to come back to life because you have a promise of a return or glory to God hallelujah praise God a transformation within and a transformation without or glory to God yet he staggered not at the promise of cultural belief but was strong given prayers knowing that God was able to perform anything he said he would do there is the way we got to believe that would today how is it going to be I don't know but court said it's going to be that way and that settle it who is this great unseen person who is this Abraham seen and visions right at last true he was manifested in flesh before the Sun King God came to Abraham in the form of a man in the end time Oh hallelujah that was the first time not the second time it wasn't a man the second time it was insightful ministry it was in the next prophet man and next manatee our the only man yahwah doctor coming you know that first man talk that come with Elohim veiled in flesh revealing mystery and ministers were supposed to rotate off that prophet speaking back Dempsey mysteries keeper bride normally so profit no profit of 1/2 no Meraki four and a quarter and have none of that it said behold I send you elijah the prophet and he he only he Lord he nobody he and he shall turn God alive he say he a mean he enemy he a man from here here a man from tear mean what it said it said what it mean and he shall turn ok the Lord a shout so nobody got found no man and me the camp and man oh man they could tell me man come after and bring more light and bring one shed more clarity but you're carrying a man and parade a man in front of me put that be fault God said behold I send Elijah and he shall turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the father's Oh glory to God we believe that hallelujah hallelujah so he was manifested in flesh before the Sun King who is a son Isaac so in other words before body change God was villain flesh before body change to produce the Sun and before you could produce son of God God's and God was veiled in a prophet because the only way you could produce a son is for the seed of the Sun to come in you because this word had to be formed galvanized another building steel is not a building concrete is not a building see matters of the building gravels of a building that's the material to make up the building but the building not to be formed or glory to God on this image has to be formed even the bees have an image and life have to come to give power to the bees and the brighter the image look at the fit thank you knowledge temperance is sung in steel but it's just as real temperance patience godliness I know you're fed up hear it but it have brotherly Kairos and Papa that oh god help me this morning I'm theatres miss the pun forgiveness and first to break into the King Macau fail which is the Holy Ghost itself which is charity the voice of the Archangel what give the Lord a show yes upon forgiveness have to pull down that gear Oh hallelujah glory to God hallelujah let's continue he said in the beginning was the word the Word was with God in the beginning was hello him I'm not saying that the prophecy now and the beginning was hello him an Elohim became the word and the word was Elohim and the word was made Elohim it's the same thing just unfolding he was LOM the eternal but in him of thoughts he wanted to become material what did he do he spoke a word and the word was materialized and that's the whole picture from Genesis to Revelation it's nothing wrong it is Elohim materializing so he can be touched and feel and in the Millennium there is Elohim system on the shroom that's right we always suppress around him that he predestinated before the foundation of the world so number one it is before the beginning the Eternal Spirit who hallelujah is not right number two is the word as the blue goes oh ha before number one spirit self existing one existing with the thoughts no family yet just thinking about the family because when in foreign two logos becomes you caught with his family that's a different thing I wanted dinner and then from the Lowe's the word became flesh but before the beginning was spirit whoa and if we have to go back we have to go back to spirit or glory that caught because the word the Lois came and produced the beginning in the beginning was the word but the world was hello him and hello him was the word that's why when Jesus came he said the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life or glory no God oh yes yes yes the word is spirit the mystery or glory of God the spirit was hiding in the word [Applause] [Music] my god I'm the happiest man that God would let me see that Oh glory to God hallelujah that Caprice message to the blue in the face you have to see the spirit hiding in the world you said the words that I speak their spirit and their life because you know in the world of the gym and the gym have the potential so he could about one so you could put a seed lay in here for years for 30 years nothing to him looking dead looking like his nothing when you take that same seed for 30 years and put it in the ground and then you see life that the comfort the life is dear because God said that every seed Oh glory to God bring thought after it's time taught himself could he get nothing until he spoke the seed for the thing that he wanted he said let there be light and I see when told him God it was a word seed and when that world began to manifest and there was light God Himself can't bypass that word that's why he said my word shall not return unto me void but it shall completion the purpose is to accomplish or clarita but there is a neural time of life coming that's here it's no it's for you believe it don't you like it believe for that we do fight on your own the question whether or not what the prophet prophesied will come to pass hallelujah or glory to God let's go to again number one spirit Elohim self-existent one returner number two loaves word in the beginning a number three the word becoming flesh margin divorce he said God is ready if he isn't doing it now he's going to call it truth to perfection buyers would Jesus Christ quality restore what perfection oh I read even some more I'm in the spirit down and from question as I said God was this great spirit we pictured him the seven colors of the rainbow it's not some man put that together that's his Holy Ghost speaking to the Prophet quad was spirit who is that the seven colors of the rainbow hallelujah the power and the cover the earth he said what now God is eternal and he was perfect perfect love perfect peace perfect joy perfect satisfaction all those seven spirits as we get into revelations they come out and make up God was perfection so them seven virtues them seven rainbows and no beginner no stacked that was before the beginning [Music] seven spirits the rainbow that was before the levels the spirit there's no argument with that when that come down Mansell is dead when that come down I hate myself when that pomme d'amore flesh shall glory Oh Oh get the Lord some praises now a man who argued on fostering they have never ready but into the presence of God the hair as I preached before Isaac said whoa before as I say worries me he was but I want to you want to you want to you he again presents yet when God put the proper Monday on King Uzziah died and I say I hit that temple and that presence had to come down the hood holy and I'm Sarah such a fight back and forth he bought words me no one to you at all when you look in the mirror is me talking alone Harlan lying trouble I am worthy I ain't no good I am stripped I am just like everybody else or glory no God give the Lord some praises hallelujah that man who spoke for God he said hallelujah praise God hallelujah I want cause he needs consequence them lips my lips are on cleaner i men that speaking for God a prophet when he got into presence Oh glory to God and that's why he said the fit isn't right he said we need to lay in the presence of the Sun and get ripen and God bring us into July where we could be ripen by the hot July Sun Lord bringing us and the presence return us to a time of life that she kinda could come over the seasons are you and bring back the original glory original manner the original experience that's why I said when a church is groaning under the pressure under the persecution stop the Holy Ghost just as real as it was until Pentecost hold it girl hold it cry but when they are born I'm positionally point and God sets in the church or give the Lord a shout there's got to be a bunch of people recalling the Holy Ghost punch they cut to be a bunch of people that believe that the Holy Ghost is just as real I am owner knew Holy Ghost I wanna model Holy Ghost I want the same only go Street I got the same only goes Paul had same sensation same emotions same same it's the same Holy Ghost there is one Lord come on one spirit one baptism so all those spirits they come make up God was perfection everything else here we go outside of that has been something that has been polluted from that so everything outside the rainbow is a perversion that's why we say in the last days the battle would be second Peter one four to seven verses everything else you hear what I said daddy but already heavy and high-minded lovers pleasure second Timothy church members had to fight that alone then they fight with the man who was the would know they have to fight and battle by the word working through the man not talking to the money somebody sort of working with came to the man so the world after come on work that's not too hard to believe Jesus said the same words denied that I do shall you do also so it's not hard to talk about words right people might be afraid that's all they like they talk about they talk but have a work and this fight for ministry every talk ministry the work of the ministry and define of the body is a world killer hallelujah the same work he said I do Jesus was working wasn't just grunting lazy and lame in the wrong you know he was at work on the bride after work because the spirit of the monk the bride with spirit the same spirit that came to Ibrahim after come to the bride to get the by the voice you have no voice of y'all the spirit out to give you the voice to pick up revelation 22:17 the spirit and the bride or glory look good because you yourself become Louis with Oh glory to God and the spirit out the right you go to the Lord a shout do you see it now glorious got to be a time of life it's impossible for there not to be [Music] your plans are corn seed it going to processes stock the leaves we toss a die not watch a plant it get tall its look autologous they can't eat that didn't know so much they leave so big in the little seat buddy yeah a change in form it's going to processes the life in its start to reveal itself so it seemed leaves go in so looking like a young lad then you look like it twelve years old they look like a teenager many countries had a look like an adult then inside they get full my mature and you'll see something come out looking like fruit there is have this shiny rotating at the end the corn here because they can fresh a nice you can pick it them it's a ready yet it not mature yet you have to wait till that get dry then you film when you pick that comes up to peel that off you can boil electrical rule they stay where you plant your plant SC take a back a seed gonna expect to get about the same thing that I demand we took the money up you bury my money your berry when I gives you a barrier talent what I expect that when God come back he said up to your feet you have to add something you have got more now I wanna give you plug Gary books and paste will you expect predict to get back board sale or look at books the bucket tips no no no no no but that can work we have to give God more than that we play in tips since then these seven TV playing tips you can forget about your playing tips though them tears how to become flesh them caves have become alive that will have to become flesh and that word as I live there has to be a time of life not a time a talk time of life or give the law some praises hallelujah so the only way we can come back the perfection is to come back to that perfection which is God a halt so when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part is done away with so therefore we have to wait for this age that perfection could reveal as revealed by malachi for not just a perfection alone like elijah tell the brothers those if I fall safe I fall as revealed by the prophet of Malachi for because he revealed the fivefold ministry is the Ministry of Jesus Christ died on on man ministry announced aborting and I know man ministry dies the Ministry of Jesus Christ but abandom had it and the bride will have it you say you know what I'm waiting on Oh glory to God hallelujah hallelujah the Ministry of Jesus Christ was manifested and before he had it in him as person he said I represent the fit by way of a divine gift yeah had a gift of divine healing or glory to occur until the angel stepped into him and come to the unveiling of the mighty God God was veiled in him but before that he had a gift don't care Christ and to prove the gospel which signs one of the miracles or glory of God then the giver came inside of him and we are promised the giver to be in this bride because once more the world will get pirate from God direct not plane a book not playing a tape die like from God because God will be veiling the bride and you can't unveil what to never view whatever the fear in the bride they're gonna rip the veil off the bride then you will see Jesus manifested Christ filled in our flesh their life like it wasn't Moses or till the Lord a shout quad was building Moses when Moody's people flights might have to come I know where they're coming from but they have to come because God was speaking to Moses okay the Lord I show when I'm nipa 10 speak the miraculous take place nobody can comment tell me the other militants that know miraculous that can work that cannot work miraculous

the Bible talking so you have to tell me where you come from you say a flight on flight dog I think you fly from below because Paul said if I angel come down from heaven and preach any other gospel so
