to zechariah chapter 4 and joshua chapter 13 you want to read verse 1 praise the name of the lord blessed be the name of the lord praise god hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord zechariah chapter 4 and we want to read from verse 1. and the angel the talk with me came again and wake me as a man that is weakened out of his sleep said unto me what sees thou and i said i have looked and behold a candlestick all of gold with a bowl up on the top of it his seven lamps thereon and seven pipes to the seven lambs which are upon the top thereof and two olive trees by it one up on the right side of the bowl the other up on the left side thereof and i answered and speak to the angel that talked with me saying what are these my lord and the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me no is now not what these be and i said no my lord then he answered and speak unto me saying this is the word of the lord unto zerubbabel saying not by might nor my power but by my spirit saith the lord of hosts who would dow ogre mountain before zerubbabel thou shall become a plain and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shouting crying grace grace unto it o praise the name of the lord and reading from joshua chapter 13 just one verse verse one now joshua's old and strict than he is and the lord said unto him thou art all and stricken and he is there remaining yet very much land to be possessed let us bow here to the prayer almighty god we thank you for your word this morning and for your presence and for your blood for the cross for calvary that give us this opportunity that we could approach your throne of grace and mercy lord sanctify us and take us completely out of the way cleanse our hearts from all unbelief every way not like you take it out father and make us more like you this morning may you be glorified and all that is said and done will you come now in our midst and confirm your word with signs with wonders with miracles deliver the lies of your

the name of the lord you may be seated and give god some praises so this morning special day also next week is a special day uh special service this morning and next week and um i'll let you know praise god so our title rebuilding the true church rebuilding the true church and have an inspiration setting the church in order for the appoint of the spirit setting the church in order for your point of the spirit or the lattering or the and all dynamics want to see at the church have to be set in order for god to outpour the dynamics the spirit the lattering because the lattering is promised the fall if it says seed you see rain if you say word you say spirit praise god but something is coming down it's coming down it's coming down it's coming down hallelujah nobody could stop it from coming down praise god daniel saw a stone cut out without the hands of man you see that stone that's coming man not gonna cut that one out that's the different stone the coming of the headstone closes the gentile dispensation hallelujah that stone that was rejected that stone comes back to close off the gentile dispensation because god has to go back to the jews but before you go back to the jews there's a bunch of people you've got to seal because the death angel is moving the decision of a sniper weapon he has taken out all that don't have that mark all that don't have that seal he's not asking if you believe brother branham he's not asking if he believes the message he's not even asking what church you go to all he wants is the mark he is really talking to the mac he is only looking for the map he's not asking what you believe he only want to know is if you got that mark because in the last days there's going to be two kind of people on the earth one with a mark and one without oh glory to god and the devil receive all except those whose names written in the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world russia is flying all over making test runs for war there is going to be another war there is going to be a third world war the war is coming you can't stop it and i can't stop it there is no way out there is one way that's up and that's why we come to church this morning to know how we gonna get out how we going to get up we come here for preparation we come here to know how to prepare because the bible says his wife had made us already you could know the death of the coming of the lord you could know the hour of the coming of the lord if you're not ready if you're not prepared you are wasting your time praise god you've got to be ready and if we come to church and we are not changing and we are not being ready we are fooling ourselves how we are wasting our time we have wasted years but that's not what my bible said my bible said everything that can be shaken will be shaken that the things that cannot be shaken merry men let the shaking begin because we are standing on the rock of revelation upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell will never prevail against it oh hallelujah hallelujah praise god glory glory hallelujah hallelujah burrito cornea man you may be seated hallelujah understand this this morning the catholics deceive baptist method is deceived every denomination deceived this morning so much a church service is going on amen but the prize cannot be this here because she have to see her name in the book which man could show you your name the god that call you the god that draw you to him that's the same god that gonna take you over yonder when you heard the gospel and the holy spirit whispered to your heart it wasn't a man in there it wasn't a man whispering to your heart it wasn't a man join you it was god that draw you and took you to the waters to get baptized to be identified with the dead burial and resurrection of jesus christ which man could touch you now which man can interrupt no wonder the bible said come i will show you the bride the lamb's wife you're not a wife of a man you don't belong to a man you belong to god the privacy that his wife had made yourself ready there's going to be a people that's calling me already hallelujah hallelujah glory to god there's gonna be a people that's gonna be made ready oh my good to feel the fire of your faith it's good to feel the anointing in the camp my god i'll be a dead man without this glory [Applause] last sunday was something else it's as if god used to gift normally on a monday i'm so tired and drained but i had energy sunday monday up the monday night i couldn't even sleep the quickening power was all over couldn't even sleep oh glory to god a true revelation of the true church and on this morning the rebuilding of the true church you say what are you saying better of it are you saying the church must be rebuilt that's right unc church yet the glory the glory this glory will be greater than the former glory if you think that was glorious under the ministry of the word wait till you break into the ministry of the spirit not by might not by power but by my spirit [Applause] you mean we already got started yet no if you talk to the seed you will get the answer you talk to the seed seed when you're going going great i'm just waiting under here see you're undercover that's right i'm under silence nobody knows i'm here they can't see me they can't hear me but in me have all all what i have to produce sealed up i'm sealed i can't change who i am i can't change what i am i can't change my purpose it's too late it's too late it's just too late hallelujah i am not what i'm supposed to be yet come on now come on now don't let your temper get you down don't let your struggles get you down your trials your failure don't let that get you down you're not you're not just there yet just seed if the seed could talk seeker said laugh at me i'm still a seed hallelujah good seed true seed just just laugh just laugh the seed can stay there for years and let the world laugh but one day one day when that rain when that spirit when that power we're not anointed when that glory strikes that sea everything that was locked up everything that was sealed up everything was planted inside of you will come forth [Music] hallelujah [Applause] there is reason why churches feel the reason why group fails men feel there's a reason for that the reason why some fail and some succeed and we have to look closely at god's plan and purpose for the church because all man systems note that word system must run out and must fail god had the pillar of fire above them by day amen cloud by night when the pillar of fire moved israel moved nobody'll tell them should we move now the pillar fire was moving and you wouldn't want to be without that because that brought them out that that that is who handled pharaoh and his army and horses so you really don't want that to go ahead of you or leave you back so when the pillar fire moved in no time to move everybody knew it was time to move nobody could pray super spiritual i feel it let the pray today that can't work you have to move pick your package and move because the pillar fire is moving oh glory to god israel was supposed to know that that was god up there that was god above us in the fatherhood representing something above them more than them distinguished from them no man in this thing it was a god thing the people knew that fire was god almighty oh the angel of the lord leading them so it was an astonishing thing for you to ask for a man to be king and the prophet lament what you're asking for god is your king [Applause] why do you want to humanize the kingdom of god why do you want to bring it down to a flesh level when the supernatural is in your midst [Applause] and god told samuel they have not rejected you they have rejected me because i am their king he was going to bring on david at his appointed time but they look around and show what others have and that's the first era people make look around and see what this one have and what that one is doing and what that one is doing because once you start to look around and compare yourself and you are unique you can't be compared with nobody else your purpose is unique you cannot be used like nobody else stop comparing stop looking around to see what this one is doing and what that one is doing what you have to be concerned with is the will of god for your life being interpreted to you by revelation and inspiration take that you want somebody to worship you want somebody to lift up you want somebody to super honor wholesale soul is a stop gap measure because i have appointed myself and david amen god purposed to have david amen to sit on that room and what purpose have to be accomplished [Applause] so soul start off good no saul didn't start a battle nobody said so bad especially when they get anointed but sometimes things just go wrong and things go off track and god have to get people back on track this is the history of israel a people led by god backslid god send them into bondage they repent god bring them out and say my people i'm with you again amen until the backside and he said when you're going this way i go in that way because i could only honor my word because you have to understand the laws of god demand certain things hallelujah certain results oh glory to god amen hallelujah and i just want to bring this about joshua joshua one email because i'm with you joshua no man shall be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life amen as i was with moses i'll be with you i will not fail you i'll be with you be strong and have a good courage that's joshua one what happened joshua said in joshua 7 they say the king her eye is next door because they don't handle jericho already so the victorious them guys getting extra juice i want we don't want to use a good drink they're getting extra juice for victory isn't that right they have the victory they're feeling good and powerful they run up at confidence we just need three thousand men or whatever they're gonna take i is small thing and they go on with i and everybody expect to hear the victory show and only see men running down the mountain when joshua saw that 36 men dead the israel running from their enemies joshua say good what is this remember joshua 1. god joshua can tell god that remember your short one and got your lament joshua bowen is here joshua crying then god tells joshua i am not with you amen and i will not be with israel until you get this cursed thing out yes yes now this is the god that i serve i don't know about the message god that they have but this god is he's a god of justice of judgment of his word keeps his word of righteousness and keeps his words of judgment even though he told joshua that in joshua 1 in joshua 7. now joshua did no wrong amen that's right joshua i didn't do anything god didn't ask joshua if he did anything the law was broken something went off-key and judgment was the effect of that going off key then joshua had the task of finding out i didn't mean to go down here this morning but i'm there already he called tried by tribe family by family man by man to get down to the individual that did this cursed thing and when they finished they stoned him akan and his entourage they've stoned eaton and all the connection with that that deed oh hallelujah could we say amen this morning do you understand how we have to go back to the bible and not back to your feelings come on now do you understand you cannot go back how it was and how this group do it and how this pastor did it i said something unity must not cannot and should not break sovereignty every church is sovereign the prophet said so the reason he said that is that the popes wouldn't come in and move in once that suffinity is broken watch for the popes archbishops bishops lieutenant lieutenants you name them they come in because they structure and hierarchy to govern people man-made slaves god made man god never ordained man the rule man [Applause] god said let us make man in our room and only imagine like this and let that man of the men over the fishes over the bees over the birds he never said man over man give the lord a shout and praise every creeping thing that creeped upon the face of the earth and before god could give manpower over others and other things a man must have power over himself i'm not hearing you this morning therefore they have to come a test that proves you have power over your tongue over your attitude over the lust of the eyes over your temper come on now over the lusts of the flesh over the pride of life over women over money over popularity god has to give that test and you have to overcome and if you ain't get the test yet it's coming it's coming it's coming it's coming let me say that again it's coming it's coming it's coming are you brothers anymore to say that first they're still coming god the test is what's going to bring out the best out of you isn't that right so brother branham was his son a man the message he brought was the messiah and jehovah of the old is jesus of the new year came into that prophet and spoke his own words not brother branham spoke jesus spoke through that prophet spirit given words that's why the prophet said the spirit and the prophet and the bride will have to say come we have to be able to say this is that that the prophet speaker not this is that a brother from england speaker no this is that that the prophets speak of we have to vindicate malachi 4 we have to confirm the prophecy because if peter didn't step out and say this is that it's just tongue jabbering people when they're speaking in tongues but when peter step out and say this is that that the prophet joel speak of that makes a whole different thing altogether because now you're identifying the prophecy that the church supposed to have and we supposed to be under prophetic utterance we supposed to be inside a prophetic vision we supposed to see where we are going that we can know how we are getting there and how yeah we are to target i'm trying to get started here whoa israel was just two days journey on the promised land my god little did they know they were 40 years away two days convert to 40 years because of behaviors because of attitudes because of unbelief two days convert of 40 years and people were expecting the millennium in this message a long time now they want god to take them all to the troubles nobody knows the trouble i've seen but you're not changed yet nobody knows but jesus but you need character nobody knows the trouble of seeing you want to get out your troubles i don't want to get out of trouble i want to overcome i want to be like him i want to leave some smoke in the devil's face before leaving here that's what we are talking about who want to die and go over yonder we'll die and go over yonder but as long as i'm here above six feet i'm gonna praise him i'm gonna serve him and i'm going to give hell a shaken [Applause] are you thinking that they ever feel when you see soldiers walking near it i mean special forces you are special forces not only alone [Applause] god could choose anybody to be in this age with special men in this age [Applause] next year could be 40 years since i joined this army you hear what i said next year going to be 40 years since i signed up for my boots and my gun and my weapons oh glory to god i didn't get a pen i have to pee potatoes no i got a sword and right now it's sitting just right just right oh hallelujah i got a sword and you got a sword all god's children got short oh and we're gonna use the sword oh glory to god the sword is the word and the sword is sharper oh glory that's the word [Applause] an intense of the heart so therefore when that capstone anointing veiled itself behind william branham and spoke out spirit given words which man going to add to that or take away from that my god is a dangerous thing now to add or take away from what the prophet brought is very dangerous now oh hallelujah if somebody believes six seals they are guaranteed a front seat in tribulation no doubt they're not gonna miss the tribulation for nothing because six years you can't make the rapture the rapture is from under the seventh seal so at least you have the assurance you are guaranteed a front row in the tribulation period under the sixth seal isn't that right you have to you need a seventh seal you need them thunders oh glory to god to give you a faithful rapture in grace you need them seven thunders to gather their bride together they need them thunders to show you how to be pale you need them thumbnails to utter their voices you need them thumbnails to be the private revival you need those standards and those thunders is under the seventh seal but a man that adds or take away the bible says god will add plagues that's in the book to that man amen and if they take away take the name of the book take the name out take it that's dangerous whoa to come down 40 plus years and add to the world where you can't find where the prophet say those things that is dangerous i wouldn't want to be there i wouldn't want to be that that's why i strive to see what the team say my inspiration amen my revelation people love they say i can't preach that's fine i can't preach that's true trust he preached from me i'm a repeater i'm a quota people preaching freely without the quotes they don't need quotes and after 40 years so many believers don't even know their promises what they know is the pastor with the pastor teacher i heard a personal testimony of a man who said he went up to buy new canyon and a spirit enter into him no no there's another two party hearing now this is my one ears hearing this and i'm listening to spirit unto him oh he said what spirit yet but spirit unto him and the spirit tell him when you go back to your church go and open some series i say whoa it's a big thing now because by around 37 seals so this spirit tell them go back to your church and open some of the seas that's fine i still don't know what spray that is but then when it's at a break the first thing that break you don't need the holy ghost you are a seed of god you don't need the baptism of the holy ghost you are predestinated original seed from before the phone now that sounds nice and what he has now a bunch of people that know that they are predestinated from the foundation world without the oil amen because they have been taught out of expecting and receiving the holy ghost oh hallelujah they could sing well they have nice music they have hundreds of people nice church and so on but no oil oh hallelujah no oil no oil no oil it's a troubling thing when people take away the desire for oil but one songwriter said give me oil in my lamp to keep me burning give me all in my lamp i pray give me all in my lamp to keep me burning keep me burning till the break of day we need the oil there's only two the wise version and the foolish version one had oil and one did not one sat in church and one asking god for the fire asking god for the holy ghost one was content to have books on tapes one was content to belong to a group and belong to a church but the other one was hungering and twisting for righteousness and we have a word from jesus he said blessed that day that hunger enters after righteousness they shall be filled oh glory to god so what are you saying but all i'm saying the teaching of the message the letter of the word did not accomplish this church that god promised in the last days this church that joel saw this mighty machine army they didn't accomplish that the ministry of the world did not accomplish that but i am saying all what the ministry of the world did not accomplish the ministry of the spirit well oh glory to god that's what i'm telling you this morning and there's a prophecy that the church gonna be rebuilt so god's gonna get some rebuilders oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah and that is where you're going to get a supernatural fightful ministry oh glory glory my my my my be saying something this morning oh glory you may be seated no there's a fifo in the body and there's a fightful out to the body i know you never hear that before amen think on that seller where is he going with that amen there's a fifo ministry in the body and there's a fight for ministry out of the body all claiming to be fightful but the ones in the body are those that pleased ah by god amen the ones out the body they have been elected and selected by man they anoint each other but the fifo that that god has to place positionally that anointing comes from god almighty [Applause] no man could do that one time a man wants to climb up in the realm but ram said listen go back down and testify it take god to put a man up there you could climb all the intellectual realm brother i have an amazing iq above others i tell somebody iq i'll do the holy ghost the sharpest brightest iq a man could have could never all do outwit outsmart the holy ghost glory i am not intimidated by the intellect of men on the contrary i see a big target i see fear game because i have a rock [Applause] god gave me a rock he gave me faith to handle the swing [Applause] oh this is good this is good this is good in other words don't play goliath around me hallelujah i will take your head off glory to god that's all because i have a rock a revelation god put that inside a tear that is why i am how i am oh hallelujah glory to god amen i'm gonna blow your mind up with this quote coming here hallelujah this is on paradox in paradox means incredible but true unbelievable boggling mind blowing here is bomb the same one jesus of nazareth would choose a bunch of ignorant fishermen for his church instead of well-trained priests on the nomination of that day how that a god that had all wisdom that could walk on the waters that could turn water into wine that could take five biscuit and feed five thousand take up seven baskets for left over hold that same one that god that sets an eternity under so bright till the sun hides their face from him the very pool of wisdom and purity and of understanding and knowledge supreme of supremes that he would come to a place where a great organization of churches had gathered together and trained all their men and he would go down and pick up a bunch of dirty stinking fishermen that couldn't even write their name and choose listen and choose that type of man to set the church in order oh hallelujah oh give the lord a shelter praise and this morning will be part one of setting the church in order for the dynamics because the dynamics of the pope the poor oh hallelujah hallelujah watch strange thing isn't it it look at least he might took somebody off stream he's the trainer he's the one who does it strange that he did that instead of taking church men he took fishermen to do it very hard but that's the way he does it it is true a real paradox when god took a bunch of ignoramuses as we call them today holy rollers poor of the world's good poured out the holy ghost in on them in the upper room instead of pouring out of these hydrogen council where all the telogen set where all the great men was we're the head of all the churches we're the ones that study the scriptures have made great school well trained waiting for the coming messiah knowing that they will be the one who would walk out and meet him and say messiah you come long as if on an airplane wing you sat down here in the temple step we've seen you coming from heaven from the golden call of heaven we are trained ready to go to work we got our schooling we got our phd we are all trained here we are 10 000 strong come we are waiting on you the in word already interpreted the people with men's idea intellect so the people are set expected to come that way expecting to come the way their pastors teach it and train it not hold the words speak it but instead of that he goes down and get a bunch of people that they know right and from left hand put them in the upper room pour out the holy spirit but abraham said oh god hallelujah hallelujah what apparently oh god upon a bunch of people like that instead of this hydrant council it pleased god it pleased god to make his own church a paradox are you hearing what i'm saying it please god to make his own church a paradox but i'm saying when they get over yonder you will see a bunch of weak people struggling people it will be surprise you who gonna be on the other side over yonder if you think it's all the big highfalutin and all the big shots and whatnot forget about it my god hallelujah i have a lot of friends you know not here but of course there forget about it you know long michael looking to see me and david and jeff ty them guys want to fellowship how you made it over yonder how you crossed jordan how you battle with lions and dragons how you overcome this how you overcome that what manner a man is this what bunch of people that god have in the last days that going to possess the case of the enemy never if there was a people like these people [Applause] oh hallelujah hallelujah [Music] in the last days they're going to be two classes of people one of them gonna have the seal of god the other one got on the mark of the beast who may know the scene of the god is the holy ghost without the holy ghost is the mark of the beast ten virgins went under me the lord one with oil one without oil isn't that right it's not right and the others that was outside weeping wailing almost they had they once had oil you know they sprayed past through them they didn't have the vessel to hold the extra hallelujah extra somebody said extra that's what you get when you do something more for the lord you get that extra blessing some people barely come to church barely raise their hand nothing extra come on now let's get their hands going get your mouth activated glory lord god stop gossiping and start praising say praise waited on the o god god of zion hallelujah let praise has come out your lips your president for what he's about to do you're president for what he is doing you're present for what he has done let everything that had break praise god this morning so the book of ephesians is some adoption is the book of joshua and joshua placing the people where they belong and if they couldn't stand still he put ephraim here run over my and if they wouldn't stand still he put it from here and said he run over to marseille manager see this is where it becomes problematic because adoption is pleasing one call to raise oats one quarter is sheep one quarter is cattle different things that everybody iron that brother have a good corn field but i go and plant corn too yes but your land is for sheep your land is the main goat so man you see so so with all that revelation you find that lions getting tie up because you're getting a problem with other people blessing and other people blessing bothering you but that's not yours and as soon as you get the burden to understand where is my land that's where it's going where is islam you see you haven't asked that question yet but joshua thirteen said there is more land to be taken so i wanted to understand it have plenty of land okay don't have to say well you know i'm taking it easy i wanna push through i didn't want to look so pushy and have more land to be say hello there again taken say say it again one more time a hole not watched every place your watch is yours he didn't see that every place you put your footage you got to put your foot somewhere you have to put your feet somewhere let the devil know you're walking let the earth shake when you walk let the devil talk when you walk oh hallelujah [Applause] you must you must be causing things to happen let others watch what happened but you must be you must never be wondering what is happening that's bad after 40 years you're wondering that's very bad but you must be causing things to happen the bride is not wondering the bride is not watching what is happening the pride is who is shake and ah either you are part of the shaker or part of the shaking oh give the lord some praise his people but the bride will be causing things to happen so when something happened in your home and you go down on your knees do you think the devil wants you to go along on your knees because that's how god will make things happen you have to set up a request god waiting to work but there is no call the application can't be possessed because he has not received no application when the people start to cry so and cry god said i heard it i heard it i heard it i heard it i heard it i had to process it because i heard a head i heard it man you should be screaming the way i heard the cries the blind man the blind man custom begging gets cuz i'm getting coins and that day jesus didn't no coins he says where's everybody they said jesus on the next street and the blind man went to depression and said poor me tomorrow maybe people might pass there and give me something he didn't do that he said who's next street this is jesus how mercy upon me fought son of david somebody said he can't hear you have mercy upon me he can't hear you he's and them next street is not like how we have next street that next street to be hallelujah that is way down but when he here and when that person's ever talked about he can't hear you that man throwing another gear he's got the strength now now now you may hear a natural scream but in the spirit realm there was a fate that broke listen bro brought another dimension in that dimension you hear everything in that dimension your secret thoughts are revealed listen i don't need to send a spy in ghana to ask questions about what the next pastor doing no elijah didn't have the son of spy in the enemy camp they themselves testified that elijah has somebody working for him because elijah talking things that they whispering in secret because elijah could break in the next dimension where the air is open ah hearing you're crying i am hearing what you are saying i can see what you are doing because the word is a designer of the thoughts and intents of the heart [Applause] [Music] there are some politicians disguised as preachers they should go for election they should go up to their parliament that politics have no place it's not christ's not a politician when people say no what the christ doesn't live in speaker said you shall not die he's a kepler satan a politician would say you know i want to talk to you privately between you and i um you can't talk that way i know you love me no i don't want to die they can't talk not jesus get behind me satan peter harter put the stair between his leg and let's move on because there was a spirit jump on peter and beat each other at one time jesus handled it one time he rebuked them and you know we're not oh no mistakes are made no he used to straighten them out of course it's his own disciples isn't that right lovers tell me more than these yeah lord i love you always don't mean one hand he's pressing him yeah man keeper speaks to him impress you they're the last age like i want to pressure you and i'm not jesus [Music] because i know to whom much is given much is expected and i can handle laziness i want to see goals on target i want to see you further down the road and where you were last year i want to see you praying more fast and more crying more sign more build more you can watch me and tell me you have arrived you're right where you are right here in this building this is not your place do you know your place in christ this building your place in christ you're in trouble that's the problem people see the church the long pipe organ the catholic enemy some strange songs they'll be singing anything and the people just in the spirit of that and the pope just how they're saying homily and whatnot take the little thing and do and the ladies ceremony today and oh it looks very good the gong and the cat or the colors the candles like turn the the right now just love it amen like i read something people like just some people like to hear things they don't want to leave nothing at all they come to get the air tickled they come to get their brains stimulated by the long-term user calling fellas philosophers people in love with their own thoughts that was relevant they sit down in the market places and they philosophize you know and they speak forget them kind of guys um i forget the names and stuff and thing and all in socrates yes socrates and and all them different guys sitting in marketplaces and people coming you know what woodward square people just going to listen to talk and you're going from one talk to the next talk stimulation you know you hold your attention it pin you down there and afterwards you come up for more talk not change no transformation just the talk is stimulating and that's how the messages become they want stimulation they want to hear about the venus looking at mars and pluto have a little thing wrong and so and i can't explain that i am not a stargazer i can't explain those things but those things sound great and in newsweek president say this and president say that and then it's dying here so and it's tight never see it so that has nothing to do with faith virtue knowledge temperance patience cognitiveness probably kindness that has nothing to do with that [Applause] i call that verbal gymnastics flipping here flipping here doing some assault with birds here and the people get entertained that's not what we are here for we are here to build up in the most holy fate yeah yeah yeah we are here to add to our favorite virtue we are yet to leave you transformed to be more like jesus more sincere deeply experienced amen [Applause] oh glory give the lord a shout people [Applause] for the brandon had an experience we just translated to the other side i want to bring that to you now and when he broke to the other side a voice say there is no tomorrow there was no yesterday no sickness no sorrow there's no little bit of happiness there's a hole of happiness it's all happiness i stood there and said what is this that voice said this is perfect love and everything that you ever loved and everything that ever love you will be here with you now is here with you now and you'll present us to the lord jesus when he comes as trophies of your ministry i've seen those beautiful women standing there all grabbing me and screaming my precious darling brother seeing those men with shaggy here around the neck running grabbing me saying our darling brother i said what this does this mean he said they are your people i said my people there couldn't be that many branhams there were millions he said they are your converts they are converts they are the ones you say you see that one standing there the most beautiful one ever seen she was past 90 years old when you led her to god no wonder she is crying my darling brother she'll never be old no more she passed from that she's in the splendor of a youth she is standing here she can't drink a cold drink of water she don't need it she can't lay down and sleep because she don't get tired there is no tomorrow there is no nest today [Applause] [Music] [Applause] we are in eternity now but some glorious day the son of god shall come and you will be judged according to the word you preached to them [Music] [Applause] and i said will paul have to bring his group yes sir i preach exactly what like paul said it that's what brother branham said i preached what paul preached i never took it in two streets or anything else i stayed the same and all them screamed with one accord we know that we are resting with assurance oh hallelujah we are resting on that that you preach what paul preached but i want to be able to say the same thing i preach what paul preached that's the word free from all men oh give the lord a shout of prayer oh i told a big shot minister i will never let any man on earth tell me what to preach or peddle his own inspiration for me what to preach i will preach what god put upon my heart oh glory to god hallelujah oh glory to god amen but i don't care what color what creed what nationality what they are they're all one when they get there watch them all bungee line has passed away i can see those women so pretty so here way down their back skirts all the way down they were barefooted see their men with shaggy around their head neck redhead blackhead all different colors they were throwing arms around me i could feel them i felt their hands god is my judge the sacred book opened i could feel them just as i feel my hands and my face and they were throwing their arms around me no sensation of woman like what we know i don't care who you are who you are what kind of preacher you are priest or whatever there's no man can let a woman throw his arms around her without having human sensations that's exactly the truth but brother when you pass between here and there it ain't that way there it's impossible it's all love everything is real brother everything is real sister there is no death there is no sorrow there is no jealousy there is no nothing nothing can entertain just perfection just perfection and that is the prophetic vision that is the prophetic vision that is the vision that brother coleman fought for for 40 plus years a vision of perfection jacob grace joseph perfection that's the vision look it right here this is the rainbow joseph rainbow coat [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah that vision has been officially overthrown by men who have been around him that vision they have overthrown it overthrown the prophetic vision and they introduce their own vision their own inspiration their own revelation and it is off of the world hallelujah hallelujah but i'm still speaking he said there is no sorrow no jealousy no nothing can't enter there it's just perfection listen that's what i am striving for this is buddy branham that is what i am placing for i said oh lord that's what i'm here at the church for trying to set the church in order telling you brother and sister there's only one thing can enter that and that is perfect love it has nothing to you come into this church it has nothing to do with i being your pastor it has to do with the target it has to do with the goal perfect love to end the end we got to strive [Applause] open your bibles to first john chapter four first john chapter 4 reading from verse four you have god of the children and overcome them amen because greatest healers in you that jesus in the world they are of the world therefore speak day of the world on the world here at them we are of god he that knowed god here at us he that is not of god hear it not us hereby know we the spirit of truth and the spirit of error beloved let us love one another for love is of god and everyone that love it is born of god and know it god he that love it not know it not god for god is love in this was manifested the love of god towards us because that god sent his only begotten son into the world that we might live through him hearing is love not that we love god but that he loved us and sent his son to be the appropriation for our sins beloved if god so loved us we ought also to love one another amen no man had seen god at any time if we love one another god dwells in us and his love is perfected in us hereby know we that we dwell in him and in us because he had given us of his spirit and we have seen and do testify that the father sent the son to be the savior of the world whosoever shall confess that jesus is the son of god dwelleth in him and he and god and we have known and believed the love that god had to us god is love i need to dwell it in love dwell it in god and god in him hearing is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world there is no fear in love but perfect love casted out fear because fear had torment he that fear it is not made perfect in love we love him because he first loved us now if a man say here we go i love god and hated his brother he is a liar for he that loveth not his brother whom he had seen how can he love god whom he had not seen and this commandment have we from him that he that loved god love his brother also may god bless his word could we give the lord a shout on that one hallelujah hallelujah say in other words the devil can impersonate any gift amen the democrat in person in miracles but one thing i could guarantee you the devil cannot do is love and barbara said there will be no love left except amongst the elect he's so naive and deceived if you only say different to them they will hang his head off like isis and put them on a stake that love is based on saying what they say but if you say different cut your head off and put them in a stick like jihadist isis oh hallelujah praise god hallelujah but jesus said you have heard at all times hate your enemies i say unto you love your enemies oh we have to get dog in the wood now that's why we're getting down to business now wherever you are being preached love who hallelujah anyhoo no they're loving their own jesus rebuke disciples for everybody love the old this family love their brother and their mother and their sister and their wife and their husband everybody love their own pharisees of their own sadducees of their own isn't that right like i send somebody somebody to unite with me against something coming with me to me agreeing with me against something doesn't mean you are standing with me because you could unite to be against the same thing but that don't mean you are for the same thing because the scribes and pharisees and sadducees they didn't agree with one another but when jesus came they came together and former consul to unite against jesus because he was the word being expressed and they couldn't handle it so they helped us to destroy it and that was before the government could take action so before the press come down the so-called church in the church the so-called church spirit in the message have to come against the bride [Applause] before the government could come there to shut down the churches all the people of god so called after come against the elect then the phong fought with the man who was the word no divine fault with the word working through the man oh the word is gonna be in the bread by and through the pride will be fulfilled all that was spoken hallelujah my god my god i feel good this morning i am i'm looking forward for the day when we can say talk over no more talk let the corner answer by fire let that god be good talk over no more talk oh hallelujah firefall in time oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah you're gonna see it oh hallelujah what i'm saying that's what i'm here in church for trying to set the church in order telling your brother and sister the only thing that gets entered at this perfect love here we go

half naked to show off the tattoos they loyal too they're following somebody they're following you know oh yeah they're proud to follow and those sodomites they call them gays but god call them sodomites the same god you see they call it the bible they want to force and try to bring their ways upon the world so it could be normal and god judged that with fire and judgment that's the god that we served this is a piece of a bible god you know not an american god and the foolishness of bible god hallelujah hallelujah a bible god a god of his word oh hallelujah [Applause] you had to forgive me you know last time i feel i would feel i was about 17 years old i'm feeling like i was back in 1975. i was ripping form eating the world you just lay it on me i was fearless chopping left right i believed this message brother and nobody wasn't stopping me from getting it or getting to it every word was god every word was true i couldn't wait to put my hand on the spoken word books i was hungry i was passionate i understood the person to know the will of god the cry to get in the spirit and the film fervent desire to please god that was fire burning in my bones that fire is still alive tonight oh glory to god next is going to be 40 years fire in me oh hallelujah i have a right to shout i have a right to praise god he kept me alive all these years [Applause] the zeal of god is eating me up hallelujah i feel like the word in my bones hallelujah hallelujah i can't handle anything contrary to the word any teaching that can charity the world is something that fire is putting me against it [Applause] right is right and wrong is wrong i will never have peace at the expense of truth no peace at the expense of truth no peace at the expense of truth jesus comes said i behold i come to set a war mother against daughter father again son a sword i miss a family for truth sake truth truth sake real oh hallelujah early four was a preacher you may be seated lord show me very early and i wasn't my minister yet don't impersonate don't copy anybody go when they say lord kill me with no way kill him see if i implemented but i'm understanding i said lord kill me you say which one yeah i first get rid of that impersonating spirit first do it come down to you yeah so i knew that lord spoke to me about popularity if you stay with the world you won't be popular you see to be popular you have to compromise that's right you have to please the most you have to be missed a nice guy i end up mr dishrag everybody wipe it here wipe your hair and you just you wipe everybody you know you become mr dish rag because you're playing nice guy nice girl you don't want to fall away nobody you don't want to lose no friends and the politics in this message have a shunned culture when a pastor put a shot on you think i think is the image the amish they have a kind of shunt thing when when you do something wrong and they put a shine on you the people do like you don't exist you don't acknowledge it not emotionally you just go under you shunned and the only way to get back from being on shunned is to get back in line so these ministers think they're going to shun me and get me back in line are going to feel lonely but jesus told me i'll never leave you nor forsake you i i don't need amanda to make me feel better about myself i don't need a culture a club i need a group of men the group i don't need a group hallelujah i don't need that i have had almost 40 years of fighting alone i am trained this way i am built this way actually i do better when i'm rejected i i feel like joseph i i feel i feel josephus protected of the brethren oh hallelujah hallelujah don't get me started i told my wife you're married trouble when you marry me oh hallelujah hallelujah you married mr t you married trouble with the capital t oh hallelujah praise god but so help me i'll stand on that rock if i lose my teeth i will use gums under devil but i'm not going to stop or give up oh get the lord some praises people oh hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to god will take perfect love to enter into here oh we have the press we have to strive we got to make it you may be seated i rejected this message culture a long time because i've seen myself end up in failure and i made a pledge to god in kaiwa with 12 people never to rule his people with rigor with force and with legalism in that kind of a way and i kept my pledge i kept my pledge i see pastors that control people's lives who to married when they're married everything else they read for the brandon books they see brother branham said he didn't get a preacher when he was caught in his sister he only went to church to escort a home he never heard his sermon because he was in love these jokers sitting in church and telling and letting him tell them who to marry who not to marry how long they stay and whatnot and also the foolishness and they say they believe this message man who's supposed to have grandchildren you know they married your name because i'm minister hold the light he's a guru only missing a little turban call it the golden temple in punjab everybody have the ubuntu it's just they have the spiritual turban right now must be can see it that message their lives are the peoples in their hands what the life of the people doing in some manhattan why wow brother branham said this thus saith the lord amen it will take perfect love to put you in that place no matter how much religious demonstration no matter how much good deeds you have done whatever you have done that won't cut nothing on that day it will take perfect love so whatever you do lay aside everything else until you are so filled with the love of god till you can love those who hate you now if you're docking them who hate you or you're going to show them your love amen somebody coming across on the street [Applause] that easy describers do that too amen but when you see you come to this spot you see that love is not imagining anything you know that's that tangible thing you squeeze a business and put something from yourself and you say you love him because the bull coming you don't hear what i'm saying the bull is on his way but abandoned forgot his gun and the bullet was coming the bull was coming the bull does what he does he gets mad he sets his horn and he takes you off in first guess i can get third gear and before he is done with you that's the bull that's that's his rhythm he accustomed doing his stuff so but ram is crossing the field and whether i'm suitable he forgot about the ball no

word to the bird with love he wasn't just speaking the word he was speaking the word he was speaking the truth with love that that that wasn't a phrase jvh would charities people excited hearing gvsu with charity i almost sound like you're doing you're doing like um you're doing um cream thing when you puree something now you stick something insane just words that wasn't that that was divine love that was something that was pure something that was powerful and that bull stopped screeching back and lie down did that how he's supposed to feel man he knows who he is he and who his father is my god he's feeling like how adam felt when he said mountain move here a lion going lie down here he felt that king away it wasn't a game friends it's not a game now we're going to have real tests ahead we have to be sincere i have to be genuine i have to be real have to be passionate about the things of god i have to be passionate about seeing these things come alive we have loved ones who don't understand the woman at the well she was out to church isn't that right she was in design the hyenas that are teaching and preaching she was there designed to meet messiah she wanted to see the word walking the word talking the word living the word manifesting and their family members they're waiting to see the word made flesh in you stop trying to pump a tape on them stop trying to force a book on them sometime in the force attracting them let them see christ in you the hope of glory [Applause] hallelujah yes that's what they have to see so barranca go back to his church and testify about

then finally singing singing and singing to see if anything can happen there's not the song service to do it they taught special some people write so much songs they told me songs gonna bring out atmosphere and whatnot after they sing so long i recognize nothing when they both still rocking and they both rocking dangerously now somebody said go with jesus when we came and breaking fast because he's the man of the hour [Applause] [Music] hallelujah what happened jesus come about peace be still i want him to do storm fall up wrap itself up go in the blanket and go and sleep hallelujah swim to

life are gonna start to pack up fall up wrap up you have got to speak you will speak you have to speak you must speak you shall speak you are called to speak you are a son a son is like this father you are attribute of god speak to your children speak to the storm speak to the condition there's going to be a rising bible in trinidad oh my hallelujah praise god hallelujah i want you to get this never let this slip if we only need the intellectual conception of man we don't need the holy spirit if the church is to be run on government upon intellects educational program upon the intellects of mankind we do not need the holy spirit and if it is to be run by the holy spirit we do not need intellectuals it's either one or the other now these five offices of this fifo ministry aren't called by the church and so forth they are chosen by god apostles prophets teachers evangelist pastors five spiritual offices in the church to set the church in order apostles prophets teachers pastors those are called offices by god then in the local church there are nine spiritual gifts working among the people now in these offices and places in the offices you hear you hear from the apostle his ministry you hear from the prophet his ministry you know last week or so i spoke by inspiration it came to me the fivefold ministry is not corporate readers bandits and pirates of wherever they come from they are not coming to take over churches and say you know what i am i feel you know who i am i am part of the fool no we'll tell them get out they're no full business the fivefold is christ manifesting himself in these offices look what i find here and discover you are hearing from the apostle hearing from the pastor here you have to hear from them and their words and their message will bring the edification the strength the perfection from their ministries affected to the bride across the world so when somebody say connect to me to make it you know that is nico again that is contrary what the connection so far has been god's permissive will because once it breaks affinity it cannot be god's perfect will it's god's perfect will that every church be sovereign where it chews its deacons elders and the minister preached what god put upon his heart that is god's will that is how the churches was established in ephesus in paul's time that is how we're going to be in the last time one thing i'm convinced of the bride will not be manhandled because the bride is the wife of the lamb you can handle the church anytime but not the lamb's wife she will escape all the force anointed she will be the escape ones another people in the land that is going to be the pride oh hallelujah glory to god amen listen god had must allow some people to backslide to save them from this untoward generation and the religious spirits in this message because god coming to get them back glory to god hallelujah that was going to be lost in church but no you're not lost you're free that's why god could find the woman of the world she escaped the pharisees she escaped the sadducees she escaped the herodians [Applause] you you you understand that you wanna be seated if she was a good pharisee man jesus enemy dinner we got along so she she long white version closing what nothing for a second make any tribulation guaranteed front seat to city tribulation but that sister was a rapture person she was getting caught up in the upper room the jesus told his serpents and needs spatula samaria them didn't know what he's gonna do he's going to meet a woman at the well her name is on the book i only come who the father give me that is one of them god gave me jesus come for everybody all that the father had passed and has given me welcome so he walked up to the woman and said give me the drink he's kind of feeding her out watch that seed she's in the condition he said you had five man and the man you're waiting not yours [Music] you hear that no that had nothing to do with the plan of god jesus went beyond all what she had done you see that's what the blood does that that's the power of my my you're making me the dance this morning hallelujah that's what the power of the blood does the power cleanses the power of redeems the power the blood the blood the blood the blood watches you and make you whole make you clear whoa could you take care anymore but i have a lot more for you amen amen hallelujah so watch each has a separate ministry so the glad the guy who claimed to have the entire fightful on him and people i guess believe that the entire fifo that is not what it's saying here each have a separate ministry okay and their ministry is of god and god has set them in the church for this purpose what is the holy ghost given for what's the purpose of the holy ghost it's to give unction to the preacher it's to give holiness to the group it's to set the church in order it's to bring the unity of the spirit it's to unite us together with power it is united together with love broadly love i don't care if you're a methodist baptist presbyterian lutheran whatever you are if we are all being one holy spirit baptized into the body and become a member of the body of jesus christ there's nothing present future starvation can separate us from the love of god we are a new creature oh could we give the lord praises listen to this ephesians 3 i'll read at verse 16 and he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man that christ may dwell in your hearts by faith that he being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height and to know the love of christ which pass that knowledge that he might be filled with all the fullness of god no one to him that is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all we can ask or think according to the power that work enter in us unto him be glory in the church by jesus christ throughout all ages without end amen oh may god bless his word but i want to really amplified of that here we go may he grant you out of the rich treasury of his glory to be strengthened and reinforced with mighty power in the inner man by the holy spirit himself indwelling your innermost being and personality make christ through your faith actually dwell settle down abide make his permanent home in your hearts may you be rooted deep in love found securely on love that you may have the power and be strong to apprehend and grasp with all the saints god devoted people the experience of that love what is the breadth and the length and the height and the depth of it that you may really come here we go to know practically true experience for yourself the love of christ which first surpasses mere knowledge without experience that you may be filled through all your being into the fullness of god may have the richest measure of divine presence and become a holy filled and flooded with god himself now to him who by in consequence of the action of his power that is and at work within us is able to carry this purpose and do super abundantly far above above all that we could dare ask or think infinitely beyond our highest prayers desires hopes and dreams to him the glory in the church and in christ jesus christ all generation forever and ever oh blessed be the rock oh hallelujah glory to god and for my hearing on my seat he said that's the church if it's in order it's got the mechanic ready it's only needed dynamics and if we will get the mechanics ready watch get our hearts right so getting the mechanics ready means what get in your hearts right the things that we can do follow every word follow him in baptism follow him in every order he told us to do get every mechanic ready and stand there then we are ready for the dynamics to be let off and only god can do that only who can do that but we could do something if we can only get started then god will do the rest so the dynamics would come as a response to the action of our faith oh glory to god and this is where i got the inspiration from for this title the church rebuilding of the true church but about the message of grace he read that scripture we read this morning from zechariah not by might not by power he said we all acquainted with the scripture that reads the bible we all know that this was during the time of preparation of the restoration of the temple and zerubbabel was the great prince among the people who had laid the foundation of the building now i want you to put in your spiritual thinking anointing jacket this morning as we think this great prince had determined to rebuild the house of the lord and when he did he laid the foundation stone as we read on father we find out that god said the rubell had laid the foundation with his hands he also shall bring the headstone i want you to notice he never said he shall bring for the cornerstone he shall bring forth the headstone and we know that the scripture says jesus is the chief cornerstone he also is the headstone now if we will think for a few minutes here we go are you ready the seventh church messenger was to restore the fate of the children to the fathers in other words rebuild the church again under the power of the spirit not by power not by might but by my spirits here the lord not by organization not by denomination but by the holy spirit god will bring forth the church in the last days so all these groups around the world that's not the church yet because we have us to move from mechanics to dynamics from ministry of the world to means of the spirit so when the military of the spirit runs in effect then you will see the power of this church then but the problem says when the power of this church rises if we bring the brethren oh glory to god so what something which group is going to organize the power of this church it's foolishness which man going to open the pipe and says you know you want to have it i'm not gonna you're not gonna have it but i'm already prophesied when the power of this church rises it will bring the bridge around so there's a seed to bring the power jesus said destroy this body and trees i'll raise it up there was a built-in power in him he said i laid down and i will take it back up again hallelujah enoch mechanic what became dynamics with the spirit and god took him the power is already built in the power of the world have a life in it give the lord a shout of praise and the secret is the word and the pride we are already connected to the source there's a power already inside of you creator is he that's in you that's he that's in the world come on believe it that's nothing but the truth [Applause] oh glory to god hallelujah on the guide this is after this such a perfect man said don't forget now remember these things that build the civil of christ faith first then virtue now remember the holy spirit here we go cannot cap the building of god until these things are operated by the spirit so he is saying these virtues are not just to operate by revelation he is saying they've got to come an hour where these things are operated by the spirit itself then you're going to be talking about the ministry of the spirit it has to be a life not just preaching mysteries oh come on now hallelujah hallelujah praise god but abraham there's got to come in the last days a restoration of the church that by tree back there he said now watch we are waiting for something they're going to take the fate and restore the fate to the children back to the original pentecostal tree that the kangaroo eat up roman conqueror caterpillar all the nomination increased eat it down i will restore again in the last days it will be restored here we go god shall send the holy ghost in such a way upon planted word that will restore so he is saying that that world is going to be planted and then god going to release the whole egos in such a way that that power going to make it restore oh hallelujah praise the name of the lord do you believe that hallelujah watch i'll take one and leave one and separate them they're between the field i'll take one and leave one it's not a group it's a personal vindication of a pregnant child of god filled with the holy ghost so surrendered to god he don't care about anything else and the holy spirit living his life pulsating through him showing a personal vindication of itself expressing himself to the people and to the world oh glory to god amen from super saiyan when when it strikes watch no that when that light struck little rebecca she knew something within her that brought her to isaac she failed her face she wanted no more to do with her own thinking isaac was a thinking then on and the church itself when it strikes the power of god watch watch there's a prophecy the church when it strikes the power of god the baptism of the holy ghost out of the dimensional churches out of the catholic church so you're saying that we're going to strike the holy ghost not the nomination not the catholic church not nominal people no no no the prize going to strike the baptism of the holy ghost watch and when that baptism of the holy ghost is made real to the people the predestinated like you people here to eternal life sees it and walks in it what is it it's a super sign what are you saying brotherhood i am seeing the baptism of the holy ghost that the villain has rejected has to be made real to the bride they don't want the holy ghost no more [Applause] they even claim to be the holy ghost at all oh hallelujah you may be seated oh my god from world falling apart brother branham he's saying brother sister just remember this we're the end time education has took the place of salvation the church nomination has taken the place of the body of christ setting all that corruption that's what you want that's what the people want that's what the american jewish want that's what the pentecostal they want they want somebody not to come and tell them the truth they want it you tell them they say i don't have to listen to that stuff turn up their nose walk out the building they won't listen to it why that's what's in their heart which one of the prophets ever come up in the old days which time did christ come whatever messenger ever come from heaven but what the church rejected we are here the world is falling apart the church is falling apart the systems are falling apart because it's a system outside of god we are the end time i hate to see a something nominational puppet i like a man a god-sent man that stands on his conviction regardless when he is proven wrong he admitted and come back and start over again you don't come and say no mistakes say something no he don't when he had me when he when he when he come wrong he admitted and start back again that is real man hallelujah i have condemned your organization not condemn you i condemn the system that got you into the place i'm not condemning you my minister brothers you get the wrong impression of me i'm trying to help you when i see you on a boat going down the river yonder towards the falls i know that both gonna shoot those falls i'm screaming to you get out of here it's not because i don't like you it's because i do love you but the system that you are in will go to hell where it come from hallelujah what are we looking for friends the real church is not looking for the nomination he's not looking for a president he's not looking for a genus he's looking for a kingdom it's a spiritual mystical body of christ and in dear watch i love this they come out of presbyterian methodist pentecostal they are in this kingdom they are born in there they come in there by the baptism of the holy ghost and they are in this kingdom oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah you are in the kingdom and he said there'll be no unrighteous there everybody in the kingdom they are kingdom people and christ is their king christ is the headshell he's the headship over the body which is his church [Applause] i'm going to come to the home church want a messiah but they want it under their own conditions they want a savior they did and they want it now the way the same way the same reason for denominational politics has taken the place of the holy spirit the ministers instead of too many of them are led by religious politics instead of letting the holy spirit lead them we ought to be led by the holy spirit god send a real leader of the church that is the holy ghost friends we are not promised a system jesus wouldn't have nothing to do with a system we wasn't promised a system we will promise a kingdom oh my that ache jacob and esau and he's so present for the buddha isn't that right the word must deliver a word by church the church has got to be delivered out a bride for christ there you are what system are you in just imagine if you would have lived back there in the other days under the jolting of god's prophets that was comfort what side would you be on back there well we got the same choice today she's fixing to bring forth the perfect wood back there the word coming to our word bride you say i taught you love people if love isn't corrective how are you gonna produce love love is corrective i'm zealous of god's church and when i see these systems that binding it down on the dogmas is rotten away and god declared his word to be true the word must produce a bride they were hated by everybody so therefore when god sent the prophet the church itself went in the good things the word of the lord comes to the prophet and him only is not right what was it back to the word back to the life systems doesn't have life it's only the word that has life systems are built around the life so around this seventh and the life of systems hallelujah that's not the life that's a system of wrong the life isn't that right praise god listen to this they brought to me for pilate jesus nicodemus came by night master we know you're a teacher come from god we know now cometh from god no man can do these things except god be with him who is he talking for the church the pharisees the leaders of that day we know we totally convinced the other person why then couldn't they do it because their system i wanted to soak real deep because i'm that's what i'm getting too the system that they have already joined themselves into was the one that could move though this did see that that was messiah but the system that they were connected with would not let them accept it [Applause] hallelujah so once you are labeled and the system say brother to you is off no evidence no proof once it is said the system conquers all the people to say he off how is he off how do you check a man out prove a man by way he stays with the world not by the way the system says so then the same way from but i'm going to judge them they can't come on judgement day and tell by god saying you know you know my passage i met that brother was off and i thought he was off and i i see him off no you wouldn't see how you judge a man but how he stays with the world there's no foolish age this is not blinding just the age god and a prophet with evening light we have 40 plus years people claim the word open up to them the right testimonies the understanding open up and they're seeing the word and what they're going to receive i know what happened they're standing closer it was testimonies went up about the understanding of the world opening them are they seeing it they're seeing it what are they seeing right now they have shades dark glasses any day time they're watching walking witches nighttime you're walking with shades they have been shaded off from the truth hallelujah because once the word opened up to you you are changed [Applause] understand this peter denied christ right pick up your sword and call my ears and run when there was looking say you're a believer same peter peter went back fishing same peter but when that word was open peter didn't look left no right peter was focused because he really knew what he was and what he was about to receive nothing couldn't show him off on the second day an email come or some from phone call come or some text come or something letter come peter you're the night guys boo peter will tear that up put us in the spin and continue on praising god no more normal normal you ain't the devil always stands i'm in the fight you know oh yeah you're looking for the holy ghost and when your brother got a breakthrough some old thought come something you do 10 years ago and you want your names to do this and correct this and make an all kind of nonsense the devil's job is to do that but i'm saying once your body got a bridge in the forest all kind of mosquito come to bite him to get him holy spirit or kind of insect something troubling him just when you're about to get a breakthrough just when you're about to get a breakthrough here come that devil that's what he's supposed to do but you supposed to keep on pressing on keep on pressing on keep on pressing on oh hallelujah glory to god amen hallelujah glory hallelujah hallelujah oh praise god i'll have to go with a few more here now from sister shepard dreams he said the biggest part of faith is mental fate by hearing the word it brings us to mental recognition of god but if it ever strikes that it becomes godly fate and that faith recognizes only what only the word not a bishop not a pope only the word that spiritual faith once you hear the word you say amen you will even take it off on facebook and like it praise god because it's the word hallelujah it's just the word praise the name of the lord only the word oh blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah praise god amen and by the way on our facebook page we have an announcement it's coming soon we're having a meeting here next year july 3 4 5. praise the name of the lord praise god a content a seventh on the revival convention we have it next year so praise god tell it to somebody hallelujah we are looking for revival we are moving towards a revival we are going to have that revival not a revelation revival a manifestation revival that's what we're looking for we believe this is the time hallelujah to call for fire this is a time for acts of rain this is a time for revival hallelujah praise anyone do you believe that now watch that spiritual faith only recognizes the word isn't that right don't hear this bum you see the fate five streams he said now watch five streams you see coming down through the watch it's been the holy spirit that made the ephesus church this is good just give me a few more minutes again just keep alive now it's the holy spirit is the holy spirit that made the eff is a church it was the holy spirit yeah this word that built the spinning church now we're talking about the bird now holy spirit britain ephesus britain smyrna oh he's gonna have to put it inside of you you have to get seven bits we'll have to hear that when i say yeah i'd preach no watch watch the holy spirit put this one into it it was the holy spirit that gave the pokemon church the titanic church the dark ages it's the holy spirit that built that bride [Applause] so what it is it's the spirit you have received the spirit in word form so when we're talking about rebuilding it's really activating and transforming and turning the word in you back to spirit oh give the lord [Applause] so jesus said behold the kingdom of god is within you what is it the word turn into power god put the kingdom in you in word form oh give the lord a shout on that one amen so watch watch i know the holy spirit that built that bride that's elected that's pulled out of organization it had been holy ghost in this age in that age in that all up to the holy spirit and now as individuals these virtues is added to our faith and when the capstone come the holy spirit cements it together there is the baptism of the holy ghost that is why it's sure today so now friends under the ministry of the world we have a perfect standing under the blood but the ministry of the spirit will bring the bride into a perfect state right now under perfect standing you are variable you're feeling up you're feeling down you're feeling low you're feeling depressed that is all because you are not in a perfect state but you still have a perfect standing god hearing your voice through the blood the blood is still over you the blood is still speaking on your behalf but your promise is a perfect state where your conscience imaginations affection and reasoning is all anointed the devil can make a move praise god in your perfect state but ram had the intelligence the mind of god for every situation because he was in his ephesus he was in that perfect state he was in the intelligence he was in the supreme anointing knowing what and knowing how oh give the lord a shout i pray he was in it hallelujah so the ministry of the spirit chewed the fifo will bring you into a perfect state oh blessed be the name of the lord praise his wonderful name hallelujah hallelujah i want to bring something from the coleman spoken with a new season 26 april 1981. listen to this this is 1981. the testimony of jesus is the spirit of prophecy the spoken word in due season the seven seal message have loosed seven spirits to all the earth the prophetic vision that was sealed up to the seven church ages the prophetic vision has been restored to the church again like it was in the apostle church it's the restoration of the entire ministry of jesus christ therefore it had to include the prophetic vision the restoration of the prophetic vision which is a testament of jesus which is a testament which is a spirit of prophecy and now that testimony changed to the spirit of prophecy listen to this prophecy it will change the fightful ministry they will preach by direct inspiration not only for telling but by direct inspiration like a nazi sapphira the apostolic pastor will be standing there preaching sin comes in the camp dom comes the mouth don't come the wisdom don't see the lord praise the name of the lord hallelujah do you believe that oh praise enough he said now watch the testimony of jesus the spirit of prophecy when the prophetic vision functions in the church again after the manifestation of tongues on their pentecost it changed from the pentecost to the word when peter said this is that isn't that right if peter didn't say that it would be confusion this ministry and that's coming now will show up the hypocrites expose them expose the false shepherds wolves and sheep closing it will pull down the heretics as god declared would be the letter of the word the tapes and the books and the hearing and the quotes has not accomplished that but the living word was spoken by men that don't fear nobody they don't fear anybody they got a mount they got wisdom oh hallelujah praise the name of the lord that is what the vision gonna do it's going to be a different ministry altogether such as the world i've never seen oh blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah i'm almost true but abraham he said i believe in the supreme authority of the local assembly let each church be its own choose its pastors its deacons whatever it is and the way the man there has no bishop over him the holy spirit wants to speak something to that church they don't have to ask anybody about whether they could do this or do that it's the individual in contact with the holy spirit show me by the bible what's greater in the bible than the local elder to a local church that's right the severity of the local church each church in itself no brotherhood that's wonderful all churches ought to be in brotherhood but the sovereignty of the local church hallelujah no man supposed to undermine the sovereignty of the local church and in some churches that is what being done hallelujah people are being sent to church to undermine the pastor undermine the local church they try to destroy the church instead of looking to save souls and get people sinners restored they're trying to destroy men who standing because they believe a data stand somebody must be destroyed the laborers are few the harvest is ripe and ready praise god there is no need for any man to destroy any man there is need to understand the devil is on the loose and every time i see a pastor preacher breakthrough i am feeling great about that i told those ministers in india i said listen if you need somebody to come from america or you have to tell all the promises i see you all a bunch of lazy men i said good josh i'm going to rebuke you i said time to get all your laziness and get your promises and fight for inheritance and hear from god yourself praise god i didn't do that or get out the pulpit it's very simple hallelujah every place i go i tell them i come i don't bishop as bishop or pope i come to influence them nudge them urge them to keep pressing on because they have a responsibility in their country i am not going to answer for their country holla this is not like britain colonial britain conquering all about the place this is not that that's overweight train has come under us in 1962 praise god of the colonialism there's another fightful colonizing the bride and taking over what kind of hole is that like pirates pirates on the high sea god i have no as a pastor christ as a teacher christ as our evangelist christ as a prophet christ as an apostle what are we going to haunt them pirates oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah glory to god just now we're going pirate hunting so listen there is so the highest authority is the local elder in the local church now i could tell you last sunday i am the local elder doing the work of a pastor waiting to be positionally placed by my father i've been doing a work since 1982 that's a mighty long time yeah i say you're a place yet but you could please me i am pleased here are you still waiting you please well then you wait in the night waiting all of us

word and you pack it out i hear from him and i give it to you you pack it up as he give me i give you i cannot give you what i don't have what did he give me i could give it to you if god said revival i said revive her and god say power i say power if i wasn't living i say deliverance time for signs i'm one of the miracles i feel ready for it now i feel ready for the supernatural yeah we need it too much are sick too much of unwell too much a condition we need power in this place and see what you will do with what what touched you and that might say hold on hold on you don't know what i'm going to do he went and burned everything that he has nothing to go back to burn his business bond everything that he has nothing in other words he burned the bridge behind him he said where you go i

elijah saying stay here and your father said you must be taking care of me today he said holy peace hold your peace hold your peace shut up you say join us connect us shut up i'm not connecting to you hush praise god hallelujah i'm not connected to that unbelief hallelujah i see a vision it's a prophetic vision it's an open vision it's efficient to take me across jordan hallelujah jordan is dead

lord a shelter praise amen is all over hallelujah the world will bow at the feet of men and women who have crossed jordan god himself oh hallelujah hallelujah praise the lord hallelujah hallelujah glory glory glory glory hallelujah watch it's possible that staunch christian almost done are you supposed to be a strong christian could be hold on things that are wrong hold on to the wrong thing thinking it is right and these things should be proven whether they are right or wrong it's the duty of all of us as we expected to go to heaven when jesus come and it's the minister's duty here we go when any question is brought up that he solves this out and then proves it before the people that they might understand because no one wants to be found wrong hold on to the wrong thing so we have the scripture watch we should prove all things and hold fast a dead grip don't turn it loose to that which is good oh blessed be the name of the lord praise the name of the lord hallelujah glory to god amen praise god mission come and please if god give a duck enough sense to know how to dodge the coldness how old he have to give the church if a duck can do by instinct what about the holy ghost in the church it ought to lead us from all formalities and creates into a glorious wonderful baptism of the holy ghost where there is virtue and knowledge and godliness in the holy spirit that's what the real guide would lead oh god deals with individuals not with groups isn't that right you see he's trying to get one man he can get in his hands that will tell the truth that will be fearless with it that won't pull no punches that will not be dogmatic one man he could get a hole in his hands and show his word alive and show himself alive oh praise god oh let's just stand and worship him let's stand and honor him oh hallelujah praise the name of the lord oh hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] [Applause] hello [Applause] [Music] [Applause] we need the rainbow [Music] it will always be oh jesus
