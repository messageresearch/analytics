special tape for you from India we would like to share with you this morning and it be a blessing to you India was outstanding and the atmosphere from the first very first service was charged I have a testimony here I wanted to read dear brother ID on Friday June 2nd prayer was offered at the beginning of the prayer meeting for my cousin Bill Ferguson who was diagnosed with inoperable cancer this week my brother received word from him that the doctors had told him that his cancer is in remission it is the Lord for he has no money nor insurance for any serious attempts at treatment my brother told him that we have been praying for him to which he replied where it must be working these are the words from a 62y old man who to my knowledge never been in a church in his adult life other than for the occasional funeral we are very much encouraged that the Lord will bring him the Salvation please continue to pray for him brother Kelly sou giving God praise this is I remember this prayer request that means prayer still works hallelujah praise God prayer still keep on praying don't give up the devil job is to Blind you from that to say because God has not answered your prayer and you're not seeing any fruit and results stop it why why was thing but this is a proof because sometimes some things are instant Miracles some of a span of time Miracles God have a Time on it for it to be healed but it prayer Works amen amen and also we're going to pray for brother Anthony orran and his family done with the flu and that's why he's not here this morning let's bow heads right now father God I pray Jesus for your Holy Spirit to visit uh Bill Ferguson father God that salvation may be wrot in his heart and life that you'll turn him around and he will come to know you father God in the power of your Resurrection Lord grant it father and Lord I pray for brother Anthony o bran and his wife and family that you would visit them right now Lord with the flu and may they be delivered completely and totally and if there's anyone here come down with anything have anything father God may your freed them this morning that they have a witness that you are the same yesterday today and forever we not look into the past we're here in the present you're not living in the past Lord you are here present tense that's why you said you are Jehovah Gyra you are Jehovah shama you I am that I am whatever they have need of this morning may you minister to your people in Jesus name we ask it amen and amen praise the Lord okay so I have a few words I like to share with you before we put that tape on um so this Israel hamus war started October 7th hamus launched a surprise attack on Israel killing hundreds of civilians taking more than 200 hostages Israel responded with air strikes gr operations to stop the rocket fire and rescue the captives so this is what's going on right now and um Hamas had was the rulers of the of the of the Palestinian people but they are like enemies of Israel okay so um you know I was concerned with because they have over I think 500 miles of underground tunnels that they dug to go here there everywhere and whatnot so I was always thinking about it going take a lot of Courage for Israel to go into these tunnels but you know what actually working opposite it working opposite that Hamas being trapped within the tunnels and Israel actually the blasting away their way of Escape that's just I'm going to just share this with you so the Vatican which I know Rome have to come and stick the head inside here the Vatican said it is ready to mediate between Hamas and Israel so I always wonder how on Earth Rome going to get into this thing you know because Rome going to make a covenant with Israel all that is part of Bible prophecy but here it here here we go the Vatican said it was ready to Med mediate D hamus and Israel to prevent further violence and facilitate the return of hostages held by hammers Cardinal p Carolin the Vatican Secretary of State told Vatican media on Friday that the attacks on Israel by Hamas were inhuman and he echoed pop Francis call for the freeing of Israeli hostages held by the militant group so I just skipping through I just going to skip that through right okay so now um have a sort of title for what I'm going to say here this morning the Battle of Psalms 83 um not going to just get here going to get to it here I just want to read from Judges chapter 4 and I want to read the scripture here J chapter 4 and if you want to turn your Bibles you turn it and and this Psalms 83 thank god brother Andrew Lan he keep telling me about this Psalms read this time he read it read it read it and I finally got chance to read it I said I see what you seeing so I really appreciate but Andre Lan for sharing that ssal with me Psalms 83 and we'll get to it just in a while but Judges chapter 4 and the children of Israel did again did evil in the sight of the lord lord when Ood was dead they're always doing this evil thing you know after God speaks to them and the Lord told them watch these words now they did Evil and look what happened in verse two and the Lord sold them into the hand of jabin king of Canaan that reign in heor the captain of whose host was Cera that's the name of the captain Cera which dwelt in hares of the Gentiles and the children of Israel Cried unto the Lord watch this now ver one evil verse three they Cried unto the Lord for he had nine this Cera had 900 Chariots of iron and 20 years he mightily oppressed oh this is jabin he mightily oppressed the children of Israel so after sinning after doing evil they take a 20e sentence under jabin verse four and debor a prophetess the wife of labido she judged Israel at that time and she dwelt under the palm tree of De Bor between Rama and and beel in Mount Ephraim and the children of Israel came up to her a judgment the prophet debor verse six and she sent and called Barack the son of abinoam out of Kadesh naftali and said unto him had not the Lord God of Israel commanded saying go and draw towards Mount Amar and take with thee 10,000 men of the train of napali and of the train of Zebulon and I will draw onto thee to the river of Kishon Cera this is God telling them now I will draw this captain that abin has to the river Kon Cera the captain of jabin's army with his chariots and with his multitude and I will deliver them into thine hand this is when God speaks God say I'll deliver that enemy into your hand and Barack said unto her if thou will go with me then I will go whether thou will not go with me I will not go she said I will surely go with thee not withstanding the journey that thou takest shall not be for thine honor yeah he this not withstanding the journey that thou takest shall not be for thine honor for the Lord shall sell cerah into the hand of a woman that's prophecy the Bor prophesying unto him and de Borah Rose and went with Barack to kades and Barack called Zebulon and naali to kades and he went up with 10,000 men at his feet and debor went up with him now hea the kenite which are the children of hobab the father-in-law of Moses had severed himself from the kenites and Pitch his tent into the plain of zanim which is by Kadesh and they showed Cera that Barack the son of abin Noam was going up to mount himo and cesera gathered together his chariots so the prophecy already said that God will deliver s to their hands when Sarah here where they s Sarah gathered together verse 13 all his char Pates even 900 chars of an and all the people that were with him from haroset of the Gentiles onto the river Kon and the Bor said unto Barack up I like that up stop sitting down on your laurels up for this is the day which the Lord had delivered cicera into thine hand I love that up oh glory to God oh that's a command you know I you feeling led up this is the day which the Lord had delivered cesara into thine hand is not the Lord gone before thee so Barack went down from the mount and 10,000 men with him and the Lord here we go discomforted cesera and all his chariots and all his host with the edge of the sword before Barack you have heard about Barack and Jeff and Samson and Gideon this is bar we talking about here now yeah it is so that sah watch so the Lord is comforted sah vers 15 and all his chariots all his host with the edge of the sword before Barack so that cerah lighted down off his Chariot and fled away on his feet so Sarah C on his foot but Barack pursued after the Chariots after the host on haret of the Gentiles and all the host of cesaria fell by the other's sword and there was not a man left how be it cesaria fled away on his feet to the tent of gel the wife of hea the canite for there was no peace between jabing the king of Hannah and the house of hea the kenite and J went out to Mid C and said him turn in my Lord turn in to me fear not and when he had turned into her into the tent she covered him with a mantle and he said unto me give me I pray the a little water to drink for I am thirsty and she open my butter and milk and give him to drink and covered him again he said unto her stand in the door of the tent and it shall be when any man that come and inquire of Theon said is there any man here Thou shalt say no then Gile he's wife took a nail of the tent and took a hammer in her hand and went softly unto him and smoked the nail into his Temple and fasted into the ground for he was fast asleep and weary so he died and behold as Barack pursued cerah jail came out to meet him and said unto him come I will show Thee the man whom thou seekest and when he came unto her tent behold ceria l dead and the nail was in his Temple so God subdued on that day jabbing the king of Canaan before the children of Israel and the Hand of the children of Israel prospered and prevailed against jabin the king of Canaan until they had destroyed jabin king of Canaan remember what debor prophesied he shall be delivered into the hands of a woman oh Hallelujah see how prophecy coming right in front F right then let's go to Psalms 83 I call it the Battle of Psalms 83 oh blessed be the name of the Lord praise the Lord give him some praises praise God hallelujah hallelujah thank you Jesus let's go Psalms 83 hallelujah praise be to Jesus a song of Assaf and this Like a Prayer in beginning keep not thou silence oh God hold not thy peace and be not still oh God for L thine enemies make a tumult and they that hate thee have lifted up the head they have taken crafty counsel against thy people and consulted against thy hidden ones they have said come let us cut them off from being a nation that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance for they have consulted together with one consent they are Confederate against thee the Tabernacles of Edom and the Israelites of Moab of the Hagar jibal and Ammon and amalec the Philistines with the inhabitants of Ty aser also is joined with them they have Halen the children of lot silah do unto them as unto the midianites as to Cera as to jabin that's why I read judges first because there was some reference to point what God could do you know was just as CER get lick up do unto them like Cera and jabin at the brook of Kishon which perish at Endor they become has D for the Earth make their nobles like Horeb and like Ze y all their princes as a Zeba and a Zuna who said let us take to ourselves the houses of God in possession oh my God make them like a wheel as the stubble for the wind as the fire burneth a wood and as the flame set it in the mountains of fire so persecute them with thy Tempest make them afraid with thy storm fill their face with shame that they may seek thy name oh Lord let them be confounded and trouble forever y let them be put to shame and perish that men may know that thou whose name alone is Jehovah at the most high over the all Earth Jehovah is the most high god oh give the Lord a praise offering and that's the God we serve this morning Hallelujah so then I wanted to find out more about these names because these were not the these are not the mother names now e Edom and Moab and giel and Ammon these Nam here these are the regions in Jordan ishmaelites and hagrites these are the people of Saudi Arabia amalec this is the region of Egypt philistia this is the area of Gaza Palestine Ty this is the city of Lebanon Assyria this is the region that covers parts of Syria and Iraq children of lot these are the descendants of Moab and Ammon scatter in in in in the Middle East oh blessed be the name of the Lord so Psalms 83 tells of a about a 10- member Alliance comprised of Arab territories that mostly share a common border with Israel who would form an alliance and seek to wipe Israel off the map in other words they say Israel have no right to exist and some I feel that way you know people feel we have no right to exist but we are still here we a disappearing anywh time now we we ordained to make the Rapture praise God they say the Israel have no right to exist but they cannot Stamp Out Israel because go his hand upon them 144,000 have to be sealed after the bread get sealed oh give the Lord a praise Give the Lord of Praise if there's 144,000 Jews to be sealed there's a pride to be sealed that would close of this Gentile dispensation Oh Glory to God hallelujah praise God praise God so these groups are no longer identifiable by their ancient names the modern day equivalent of these nations that will form the alliance that plotting to destroy Israel the tens of Edom the sents of of Esau are we're going again which is Palestinian refugees and Southern jordanians ishmaelites Saudi Arabians Moab Palestinian refugees and Central jordanians hagrites the Egyptians jibal Northern Lebanese Ammon Palestinians refugees and Northern jordanians amalec Arabs south of Israel philistia pales refugees and hammmer of the Gaza Strip so you see we have must connected with the Philistines they're not easy you know but I'm talking about adoption to deep with the Philistines you know these are demons you see Hittites and jeites is one seites but the Philistines are different together them have iron chots they come back and fight you oh Hallelujah you hit the amorites and the Hittites and the jebusites but the Philistines you need power to deal with Philistines not easy you know that the golad family we give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah praise God praise God praise God hallelujah oh glory to God Amen so we ready to go to India what I want to say is this it was a war Israelite to fight coming out of Egypt and going to the promised land he said the land for H Jeb but the land is yours and you have no other choice but to

against you because you are God's people you're God's elect even if you don't feel so even if you don't think so even if you're fully you're not fully convinced of that that doesn't change what you are Oh Glory to God you ordained for a breakthrough you have to get a breakthrough these Bible stories happen for our examples to whom the ends of the world have come that the same God that was with them the same God that was with barock and Jeff and Gideon and Samson and all of them is the same God with the bride this morning he will fight for you he will fight your battles Oh Glory to God I

intelligence the mind of Christ to know what to do with the word will be accurate every time will be on point every time we have the word every time because will be the mind of Christ dropping down

promised when Joseph was about to die Joseph told them don't leave my bones here in e he said God will surely visit you but when you're going out take my bones with you take my bones with you because Joseph knew that Messiah was coming in the land Messiah was not coming in Egypt Messiah the Christ was coming in the land you have to come from Egypt into the land and if tonight you are still in Egypt have to come out of Egypt if tonight you're still in the world you have to come out of the world come out of the fashion come out of the world issues and come to the Land Of Promise This Land Of Promise have joy in it it have power in it it have peace in it it have Revival in it it have the manifestation of the sons of God in it all your promises all what you long for is in this land tonight so they had to come out of the land they were in into the land of promise and here the prophet now and the church has to do the same thing get out of that group of [Music] rejectors over into the promise and the people have to do that there are groups that are negative there are groups that saying things contrary to the Bible there are groups that don't believe in the holy spirit all they want is the word the word the word intellectual they don't believe in lattering they don't believe in Revival just sit and wait for the Rapture but they will and wait for the tribulation because the Rapture is a revelation and only those who are ready only those who are ready will go in and the Bible say his wife had made ready his wife for get a revelation to get the extra oil to go and meet the bridegroom so brother Bram the church has to do the same thing get out that group of [Music] rejectors over into the promised land before Messiah can ever be manifested before them prophecy when the church can get in such harmony with God until the manifestation of the bridegroom is manifested in the bride wait a minute will be manifested in the bride you mean the word will become flesh again you mean God was invisible until the word became [Music] [Applause] flesh then he could touch him you could shake his hand turn around and greet one another in Jesus name Hallelujah somebody next to

promised and brother said Canan is the type of the Holy Ghost Canan is not a type of the millennium because in Canaan had Wars fightings killings so watch this now Canan is where they settled down with the Holy Spirit but they still had Wars what do they do in Canaan listen carefully Church they were possessing their rights [Music] Hallelujah they were doing what possessing their rights now if you are drunker here tonight you are the worst behaved person in India and your father or grandfather leave you 10 million rupees ion I don't know how much1 million I don't care if you're drunk that money is yours Hallelujah because your grandfather left it for you you could be eaten out the D and somebody come and tell you your grandfather has left you a castle I've left you all this land all this money and you could go with your drunk self and say I come for my land this land is mine my grandfather left it for me this is my right what I have news for you Jesus died and paid for your land and you have the right tell the devil give it back this is my land this is my wife this is my husband this is my children I claim them I snatched them back from the enemy that is your right today oh glory to God glory to God you may be seated I told them back home I don't know the Royal children Now with uh in England when the baby is born Prince Harry or princess this or Prince whatever they don't know that they are royalty if they send one of those babies in India he will grow up like an Indian will grow up if he's in in this area wear a turban or whatever it is he wouldn't know he belongs to royalty to the queen and the king and so on like that now when these children are growing up the mothers and fathers don't teach [Music] them they are special tuts to teach them their history they are generation of kings and queens to teach them etiquet and behavior [Music] notice you will never see one of these people when in a mini skirt no because they are royalty they are train in their minds to think my father is the king my mother is the queen I have to walk walk a certain way I have to talk a certain way I have to live a certain way now they wasn't born Royal they have been taught to be royal you wasn't born Royal but you are being taught to be royal because the Bible say you are a royal priesthood you are a holy [Music] nation you are a peculiar people but you didn't know that but when you come to the convention when you go to your church you are being taught that you are not from India you from Glory you are not from this land so that is why you have to hear the word receive the word and if you could change your thinking you can change your walk so God has to bring the word into your mind then into your heart and then you are different person Al together then you walk like royalty you talk like royalty walk like the son of a king like the son of a king and your father going to back you up your father will protect you when your prime minister is coming around he don't get out of his car and walk out he has to have security he has to have bodyguards you has to have motorbikes lights flashing you know that's our prime minister coming but the Bible said the angel of the Lord in [Music] Camp around you you have escorts you are protection because you belong to a kingdom in that Kingdom it has a King Jesus is the king and you are the sons and daughters of the king glory to God help us Jesus Hallelujah maybe see it I pray see it tonight so when we talk about possessing this land you are not possessing it you know Lord forgive me Lord I'm a sinner I so I'm So Unworthy you can't go there none of us are worthy God's grace open our eyes to see The Inheritance that he has left for us and I don't know if I will get to it but the prophet said you have to fight for what you know is your [Applause] own that means the revelation of the word supposed to give you a revelation of what is your personal [Music] property this message when it is finished you supposed to know by Revelation what belongs to you Hallelujah if you don't know it's yours you can fight for it let's go back to that drunk man some lawyer come and tell him look your papers your grandfather left for you then he get his papers he's still drunk he still have old clothes [Music] on when it hit himself so he stop drinking he wants what is his own now so they said this landine is yours it have squatters in it now he if he don't know that land is his own he can't tell the squatters get out but now we have documents no we have evidence and when he come they say go you [Music] drunk he say yeah I might be drunk I'm not stupid this man is mine oh give the Lord pray hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah I may be drunk but I'm not foolish my grandfather M or whatever he leave this come for me out of my land and tonight the worries of the Faith by a faithful Ministry they run those Devils out of the land give me my Mountain Oh Glory to God hallelujah hallelujah glory to God glory to God hallelujah hallelujah glory of God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so says Abraham God give Abraham the land and lot was part of that land and some Philistines and some people take away [Music] lot and Abraham asked God if there's 50 and and and no he he's had a beg God for to help him to get back lot Abraham wasn't a soldier Abram was a farmer so they're farming Community take up Fork ho Cutlass whatever they had they were going to fight no bear in mind Abraham never had an experience before he never had no conflict with anybody before this is the first time Abraham have to fight and it wasn't for himself it was for his family who are you fighting for who are you fighting for and ABR went down with fork and and so on and and he beat those people and set lot free and what did the Bible says beat your FKS beat it into swords change what you have into weapons of H you begin to say I am a son I am a daughter I have rights and I want what Jesus left me Jesus died I can be healed Jesus died that I can be filled with the Holy Ghost and I come tonight to get my portion I come tonight to get my possession we are moving from profession to possession praise God listen to this now butam Abraham had a right to the promise and the promise was his yet he had to fight to possess it the believer today we are air to all things we are air to every spiritual blessing every physical blessing every blessing the bible promises yet you have to fight every inch of it that is the way God got it set up God set it up this way this year is yours but you will to fight for him it is yours but you have to fight Oh Glory to God sh fight H youth youth youth youth yeah youth you have youth Hallelujah you have to [Applause] you you have to fight hallelujah hallelujah God set it up that way that you have [Music] to keeping that word [Music] youth I Lear all right you have to fight to possess what you know is your own you have to fight to possess it you may be seated one time Jesus after a couple of years with the disciples he simple question who do men say I the son of man am some say you're Elijah some say you are this some say you that and all of a sudden brother Peter he said thou are the Christ the son of the Living God Look what Jesus said he said flesh and blood had not revealed it to you you didn't get it by a text or Whatsapp you didn't read that on Facebook he said my father has revealed it unto you and Upon This Rock of Revelation I will build my church the church is not built on men the church is built by Revelation and Revelation comes to the individual Revelation don't come to a group Revelation comes to individuals in the group so you could sit there and your father bring down revelation in your heart and the person next to you don't even know he's revealing himself to you so you have a right Revelation to possess your mountain and you know what I love about the [Music] Lord he doesn't have to ask anybody permission to give you [Music] Revelation but you know he's a bad boy Hallelujah he he you know he's a bad person he reveal it to whomsoever he will but she's a bad girl that have nothing to do with it Jesus he wait for that woman at the well and he told her if you know who's speaking to you you ask me for water and the water I give you you will never tast again Jesus told her go call your husband she said I have none Jesus said you had five and the one you're living with is not your Jesus didn't open his eyes big look how much man look how much husbands he had Jesus didn't do that he said you had five and the one you're living with is not yours when Jesus finished with her he said I that speak unto you it is me it is and Jesus freed her from the inside out and she run into the village a somebody say another man she said no this one different is a perfect man this is a perfect man see a man this the Christ give him some Praises wants you to see him this morning want to see him today so you have to fight for what to possess what you know is your own so I have this here I wrote this the entire Seven [Music] Seals was to bring us to revelation of what belongs to us the ministers was supposed to show the bride her promises that she can go on to possess them that is what the ministry is for not to present ourselves but to present the promises you may be seated we find out and we talk about it this morning a bit you cannot contend for the faith without a revelation of forgiveness and brotherly kindness because you will encounter people that Hate You Without a Cause Joseph was hated without a cause his own Brethren hated him because his father gave him a coat of many colors and Joseph had vision and when he shared them his brothers got jealous now you cannot stop people opinion about you you have to have a revelation of what God called you to do stop listening to what others think about you you have to know who you are and who your father is you may be seated notice they sold Joseph to Egypt and they are thinking they are getting rid of the problem but what they are doing is bringing the prophecy to pass so when Joseph as a young man being driven from his brothers into a Strange Land find his position because if God give the vision it must come to pass so after a while the brother's living brother's fellowshipping but Joseph is down in Egypt Joseph got promotion from cleaning the garden to be in charge of for house one day po wife got an interest in him and Joseph run for his life you have to know when to fight and you have to know when to run Joseph knew to run from that woman and when he ran he was accused falsely and put into prison now watch if Joseph did not have a revelation he might have think about suicide he might think God abandon him but he knew Romans [Music] 8:28 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love the Lord to them who had he called Accord to his purpose so even in prison God was blessing Joseph had a Buckler and a baker and he told the butler you will be restored into a position and he told the baker he will die he told the butler when you get back in favor with the King remember me be grateful be thankful show some love show some appreciation when that Butler get delivered and come to the presence of the king he forget about Joseph no remember he's serving the king now but all of that was God's plan because Joseph wasn't ready and God not put you in a position of power if you are not ready you have to be ready to be placed into Power Give the Lord a praise offering the Lord shout so watch this when God was ready to move not man moving man controlling things when God was getting ready to move Pharaoh a dream and Pharaoh forgot the dream it was a terrible dream and he called all the wise men and told the wise men tell me the dream they say what is the dream interpret the dream say gone from my mind all say all wise [Music] men you better tell me that dream if you don't tell me I will cut all your head off come all you say all you know Supernatural things and spiritual things so this is when the butler remember Joseph you see nothing happens by chance so the butler tell Pharaoh there's a man named Joseph who interpreted a dream and told me I'll be here then Pharaoh says send for Joseph and I could see Joseph he's in prison he's in prison clothes and he is coming up in prison clothes up to Pharaoh Joseph looking like a nobody and Joseph tell Pharaoh the god of Heaven to reveal secret things and Joseph went and prayed and the vision broke upon Joseph of seven years of plenty seven years of famine and Joseph interpreted the dream to the king and Joseph told the king fin a man who is wise enough govern this whole thing and Pharaoh told him go the man you are going to rule this thing and I am telling you there's a fold Ministry that God will adopt into the family and give them a power I to shake the nation shake the nation this world going be shaken Once More by the voice of God and Pharaoh had chosen to be the right next to him watch God work you may be seated this is an international Affair now God let fam strike everywhere famine is everywhere but in Egypt when there's a pyramid when all other bands are empty only Joseph B have grain so everybody have to come down to the pyramid and one day this pyramid everybody who want to be in the bride have to come on to that pyramid F virtue knowledge Temperance patience they have to get it from Joseph B Jacob Grace Perfection this Perfection has to be in that bride may be seated so his Brethren coming from Egypt same brothers that rejected [Applause] him same brother that sold him out they don't even know is Joseph and Joseph see them come through and when Joseph reveal himself to them notice what he said now if Joseph wasn't changed you said bring a big stick for me I beat them you sold me out Joseph didn't do that he had forgiveness he had a revelation kindness he was a real son notice Joseph never told his Brethren you sold me out he never told his brothers you treated me badly listen to what he says God sent me [Music] ahead to preserve life [Applause] so when you see the higher purpose of God you wouldn't see the petty nonsense a lot of Brethren doing Joseph saw the higher purpose all what you did Brethren was to bring me in this position that I could help you God send me AE life and God have sent you ahead of your families because you have to bring a word to your familyes the spirit and the Brain say come go whether I not you to tell your family come come come Come Oh Glory to God and don't think that they wouldn't come because the Lord himself he sent with a shout and a voice and when that voice was out from Jesus and Lazarus was dead Lazarus couldn't say he coming Jesus said Lazarus laus come forth and Lazarus a dead man he can't stop the voice of God of God Soul his Spirit bring it back to the body heal the body and he was wrapped up in clothes Lazarus come out like this and Jesus said loose lose him and let him go and tonight God going to bring you out and you are going to be loose you are going to go free God will show Vis you glory to God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God amen amen amen hallelujah you will be seated what is a warrior a warrior is someone who is courageous and strong and fights for a cause or a goal Warriors are determined confident fearless and courageous they fight persistently in the face of adversity and never give up a warrior you're not born a warrior you are trained to be a warrior and that is why God tests us and try us is to train us for this battle so the training of a warrior is to optimize his physical mental and spiritual discipline in order to achieve peig performance Paul said it this way we don't fight like you fight in the air he said but I bring my body in [Music] subjection Oh Glory to God if India is setting up a great cricket team pick any and anybody they have to pick the best because they are competing with the best for Olympics you say come let's go you go you come you come no they don't do that they have trials timing how much fast you're running why did you do that because they want to make you feel bad no they want the best yes watch this Satan came in God Eden and throw down Adam and Eve now God come down in Satan's and God only getting the best in the last days what are you saying brother you are the best I don't care what you think I care what you feel God Reserve you for this last day so this Warrior mindset must focus on Inner Strength Focus self Mastery you may seated wa the woman with the blood issue she had a need her husband told her don't go to that church don't go to that group don't go to that Jesus but she spent all her money with the doctors and the doctors gave us this and that it wasn't helping her she told herself sometimes you have to talk to yourself told herself If I Could Touch the H of His Garment I made whole she was a warrior sister she had fighting in a heart the service she went to Jesus was surrounding all but was surrounded by a lot of people tall men short men fat men T men all people watching but she know she has to touch so she decided to say excuse me excuse me she take a handbag thr it through somebody's leg excuse me I want to get my handbag and she push and she press and she push she craw she get on the ground and when she touched him His Garment Jesus said touch my [Applause] Hallelujah the disciples say but everybody touching you he said no this one is different this one is different I come me the power come and he saw the woman watch what Jesus said he never said my power healed you made the whole she was a warrior of the faith she has faith and she made a withraw from God's Bank of healing oh praise God so God have to train men said amid this called for Revival we cannot have a Revival until we have God call men train men men train the rugged School of Faith men must come into the presence of God the men who will stand in Victory or defeat feet they still stand the same he said that's the kind of training God does to a man God leads his people two great trials to purge them to what to purge them and sometime it take years to do that for me myself tonight speaking I believe right now God is training such men to meet the front line Oh Glory to God hallelujah hallelujah you may be seated can wrap up here but listen this David David wasn't a soldier David was seen about the Sheep but God wanted to take David and bring him from the back to the front how will God do that he's a Shepherd boy he has nothing to do with sword and fighting and so on so watch this now David knew he was elected because Samuel come and pour the oil upon his head remember when God told Samuel go and anoint one of the sons of Jesse and the big brother came first and Samuel says surely this is he and God said no no no no no don't look at height don't look at stature look at what's in the heart and when everybody pass by Sam have horn oil because he recognized there's no witness to confirm pour that oil upon so he said do you have another son he said we have one more his name is David he said sent for David and David come out smelling like the Sheep David didn't have time to put on cologne and Sh shave his face and David come muddy smelly and when Samuel saw him he pour the oil upon him now watch the anointing is for David to be king but David is not ready to be king God anoint you you're not ready yet give the Lord some Praises so let anoint him could hit you tonight God's oil of the Spirit come upon you what did David do he went right back to the sheep and one day a bear came and one day a lion came and David killed the bear and the lion be so this is this scene here David in the Sheep normal living taking care of their sheep kill the Bear kill the lion another scene on a hill the armies of Israel P down by a man called Goliath that could be cancer that could be tumor whatever condition you have tonight that could be your Goliath [Music] gol every day gol saying send me a man to fight me and those Brothers only polishing boots sharing shorts but they're not going to fight David father send him with some Roy to give his brothers some food to give his brothers David have nothing to do with the

Philistine defying the armies of the living wasn't B with who is that uncircumcised Oh Glory to God hallelujah hallelujah David couldn't understand how they could allow that one man down the entire church the entire Revival and then afterwards know the story David give his testimony give him his [Music] armor that sa he have the latest armor but he going fight he gave David his arm to fight when when they had to walk you had to walk like a robot David had to work he said he said sir this is a very good armor but this is not for me I will [Music] use what God give me and they take off the armor put a stone in his sling and the B said he ran down to meet Goliath he wasn't walking tbling he was a warrior of the FI and David ran down to meet Goliath and Goliath was shocked he said am I a dog you have no respect for me you send this little boy to fight me and then gol prophesied Fe him to the birds and David prophesy I will cut your head off oh give the Lord a shout I'm going to finish right here I'm not even finish and we find out that golad big and heavy walking down and David started winding on his sling and as he started wind his sling the Holy Spirit took a hole of his hands it was a guided missile everywhere go head was going Stone was going go do if the stone going so the prophet said if we could get started if we can get started God will do the rest and tonight let's get started you worries of the faith let's get started with SS with wonders Miracles oh my so listen to this God elected you God pour the oil upon you and God is here to place you God had elected you to be a Christian you will not be a Christian you are not even a Christian by your choice God elected you to be a Christian Oh Glory to God hallelujah hallelujah so the Bible promise there be exploits of Fai exploits which which is signs and one of the but abam said the church today is filled with mental Believers human Faith wasn't enough then it's not enough now it takes the faith of the Son of God it drop into the heart so he can receive the Lord Of Glory and listen to this part now I'm but he said no when a man is born in the family then he was adopted into the family and he was given a robe and brought out in the street in public and brother mam said this when you stay in the Kingdom stay in the gospel stay right prophecy one of these days God will call you out and set you aside and adopt you as his son before the people and give you something that will shake the nations with it and butam says after Jesus adopted I'm finish him God shine and said hear ye him that's the thing that God will will do to his sons on Earth someday he will call you aside church if you only obey him and stay in his word listen to this he will place into the [Music] church before the coming of Jesus Christ listen carefully before the coming of Jesus Christ listen to what God will do all that the powers that Christ had in him will be in the church all that God was he poured into Jesus all that

him out to a certain place have a ceremony he said let me say this if you count me to be a fanatic that's the very same thing I'm speaking on will be done there will be a power but to the church and now is coming in that the Holy Spirit Will so anoint the people till they will speak the word and it will create itself like that we haven't seen Powers coming into the church I know there's a fact say unto this mountain be mov what it is the placing of the church Church in position where the fullness of the power of the Holy Ghost come into the church then the critics mouth will be shut it will

now is the adoption of the ceremony of [Music] adoption where your signature your you could write the check just like your father and this is it here I'm closing with this well that's where the church

that great being father that can make that Rapture you said when that being is complete that's the being that will go into the Rapture and it'll take a fight it'll take a dying out it'll take a total surrender it'll take a total commitment it'll take a separation from the world and Lord we are so grateful for the clarity of the word this morning that we are being challenge as Warriors of the faith to pick up our swords and fight for every inch of ground to fight for our families to fight for our homes to fight for our individual experience to fight for Holiness to fight for Purity to fight for

back at the appointed time in the precious name of Jesus Christ and the church says amen and amen you may be seated for a few announcements Hallelujah there's an anointing in this place oh the prophet told us when they'll be standing sitting and then just love will just drop down oh all the evil will be taken out all that is wrong is going to be made right it will not be the work of man it will be the work of the Holy Ghost God himself performing surgery oh the putter having a work with his clay oh what a time is going to be oh Hallelujah may this anointing not stop may this presence not stop

encourage you don't leave this service if you need to make something right with God this is the place this is the time this is the season if you're looking for more of God he is here it has nothing to do with the man it has all to do with the Holy Ghost himself wanted to have a perfect union with you Hallelujah bride and bridegroom together service continues this evening for the Lord's Supper we encourage you to make the effort stay in the spirit this coming Wednesday there'll be no physical service here at the Tabernacle there'll be a live stream service only and I really want to encourage you Church make that sacrifice to carve out that time for that service don't do it as something you're doing along with something else but do it because you're in the house of the Lord in that space that space that God has carved out for you dedicate that to be a time with the Lord so you can receive fully from the Lord this coming Friday there'll be no Zoom prayer meeting but we encourage you remember the pastor in prayer as he's traveling this weekend to minister in the US may God go with him and strengthen him and bear him up we are in a special time as we know menance group five please meet with brother Blackman after the service second service and next week group four is CED to serve and we also made an announcement I believe it was a week or so ago about our planned church dinner which is going to be on December the 9th and we just want to speak briefly to this that uh we really want an extra effort so that everyone can be there and we want to be able to have registration begin today uh for it so we could understand uh what we're looking at and we encourage you if you have a burden to sponsor someone you are free to do so you can let them know at the table if you have someone in mind and if you don't have someone in mind that you would like to sponsor for this then let them know at the table and they will be able to help assign to someone who may have that need uh but we do have uh the church dinner on December the 9th and the price for adults will be $150 um for adults for children between the ages of 6 And1 it'll be $75 and for under five and under it'll be free and we do have a brief menu uh that we will publish on the notice board uh downstairs but I could assure you it's a it's a wonderful menu that is planned uh but I feel led uh to to not read the menu now I think this the spiritual food is still is still being consumed consumed and although we have natural food to eat afterwards you know there are times when you have to lean to the Holy Ghost because I believe God is still dealing with someone in the sanctuary this morning and God is not finished yet and we want the Holy Ghost to have his way that's the reason we came to church that's the reason we came in the house of the Lord for him to have his way not for us to have our way not even for the minister to have his way but for God to have his way Lord if you need to break me break me you need to change me change me you need to shut me up shut me up you need to shut me down shut me down whatever you need to do because I want to be changed I want to be transformed I want to be a a worthy soldier of the cross a warrior of the faith because there's a great occupation there's a promised land that I have to take and there's a cause because the young people need it and the fathers need it and the husbands need it and the wives need it and the daughters need it and the young people needed every inch of ground so we could build up this statue of a perfect man because one of these days the last service will be preached and the last song Will Be Sung and whoever is filthy is filthy still whoever is righteous is righteous still Lord I want to be ready I want to be ready I want to be ready so may the Lord richly bless you may the Lord be with you in your in your lunch meals and and in your fellowship and I really encourage you to keep practicing the presence of God keep in the spirit there's so much to consume our time during the week but if you plug in to the super natural through your prayer through reading the scripture through reading the prophet's message through watching a tape your life will be different so may the Lord richly bless you brother [Applause] stepen the Lord a hand of Praise one more time amen I want you to stand up and go around and greet
