your people this morning bless your word bless your people gathered here those connected live may your spirit be with them and he sick in our midst may your healing virtue flow towards them and bring great Deliverance today and Jes him I ask it amen and amen God bless you and welcome amen you may be seated praise God before I read the scriptures just share a few words I am grateful to be here this morning and I consider it always a great opportunity to come into God's presence we wouldn't always have this privilege hallelujah amen we want to welcome Deborah Maraj uh this morning God bless you welcome P Tabernacle invited by G marage and um I uh they had a great time yesterday with uh things P into life and godliness amen those who were there really appreciate what brother Andrew shared and one of the things my wife was telling me about was uh concering the wise virgins when the foolish asks the wise for oil they said go to them that sell it means you have to be in a position to buy it means the wise make sure that they were in a position to buy the oil that was needed so it's quite a challenge there right amen go to them that sell in other words time for pay for you to pay the price so this morning I'll see what the Lord will do we are looking forward for great things from the Lord amen I'm under great expectation we are moving on to a certain Junction and some time ago I was preaching about Joseph and I was talking about how I was looking to see how there will be an intersection where Joseph have to connect with Pharaoh because that was the purpose of him going there and sometimes in our lives because we are not in helicopter to see the big vision and we under the ground on the street and you're struggling and you're battling but sometime there's a big higher picture that God have in his mind for Joseph to come into position it means that his brothers have to sell him out for the brothers to have to sell them out it means you have to be gifted enough for they to get jealous and that jealousy provoked them to the place where they could get rid of him in getting rid of him he still performed in a land that was not his own in a language that not his own hallelujah it's a young boy but he learned your language and he pressed on he performed in party first how did he get promoted until God could get him into prison the target was the prison because the bottle connected to Pharaoh was going to be dear forget the baker for now but the butler is who was going to connect him to to Pharaoh now the thing of it is when Joseph tell that Butler remember me he forgot that's human but the reality was Joseph wasn't ready yet and sometimes we want to escape route we want to get out of what we in but are you ready you blame others but are you ready you say this and that and make excuses but you have to become ready that's the most important thing amen and if you hang around me long long enough you'll know I don't like excuses I like people to accept responsibility for their attitude and their actions and their behavior I like to choose my behavior and action choose to love choose to forgive choose to drop things choose to Live and Let Live there's a choice choose not to be hurt and and and be angry and cursed and and you know is a choice we make and God reward you for the choices that you make remember reputation is what people think you are but character is what you are amen amen amen amen praise God you love him so he saying a few thing before we get into the word this morning so you know God have his requirements and we have to meet them it's not the gift I was thinking something this was striking me so strong God want better sermons think about that that song Stranger God don't want better sermons God want better men and better men will produce better sermons and that's why he couldn't handle Saul he said I found me a better man Hallelujah and that was David Hallelujah so God don't need to talk so much from you and know he wants you a better you could you see yourself becoming a better you or do you want to continue as you are why sometimes they're so sad there some people all they know is what they know for the last 20 years they add nothing to it they didn't read an extra book nothing listen to nothing all they know is what their brains have in last 30 40 years they add nothing to themselves that's a shame because whether you don't know or where you know you don't know the world is spinning around and there are things you're supposed to know and the Bible said my people perish because of lack of knowledge you need knowledge because knowledge gives you the access to discernment and you need discernment in order to escape the Ws of the enemy and I and but Andrew was Shar with us that he read Proverbs every day so on the first days 31 chapters on the first day if it's day three or four he read the third book of prbs and so I tell him that book was my mother grandmother father everything else as a young Christian that was The Guiding Light of my life that book called Proverbs it kept me from woman kep me from so much different things snares in life that book called Proverbs it's a book of wisdom is a book that every young man woman should study the Book of Proverbs and it's not hard to do that because you could just get into it every day day one read Proverbs one you know and get into side of it because what the devil was the devil don't want you to get into the word get you in Facebook getting all kind of foolishness and all kind of all kind of gimmick people be saiding on whatnot but to get into the word that's a challenge but in that word of life and that word have your calling if that word have your election if that word have your anointing in that word of your deliverance that word is for all nations all countries everyone it's subject to the word of God not your emotions so much you got people go by their feelings and their emotions and their hurts and their fears and God have nothing to do with that he's not in the realm of your feelings emotions in the realm of your word of the of his word if we get to catch the mind of God we see everything different praise God so this coming week here I be leaving to go Peru South America on on on Wednesday back next Tuesday and uh I had the privilege of being in me Georgia spoke uh so strange I was in the plane we I me and I went Georgia and this brother passed by this man passed by say you you you are passed this message and I didn't know he was and he contined walking what to find out is a family from Trinidad have a church in Mak Georgia think is um Mark um RAM kisun and um so I met the mother and the brother very talented people and so on like that so I I I it wasn't my intention to go there and preach but I eventually was invited so when fine time bless time was really really wonderful amen but it's amazing how God has set up things how I met this family and begin to talk with them and then here in Georgia and I was in Georgia I think 1989 or 90 way back when we had some meetings in mon Georgia and I was there many many years ago and we have never been to Georgia but we glad her brother now lives there he moved from New York across to Georgia so we able to visit the family visit brother place also was very nice he by his son across in Georgia it was such a a wonderful experience and God has been good to us so please remember me in prayer I'm going to Peru we in the last home church now but brah says one of these days that last name will come in and when that last name comes in the book will be closed there'll be no more saved no more you know people about the end times but we actually facing the time of the end and we like to say it this way sometime you know long time you you catch the turkey and had turkey in the cage for for Christmas or chicken and as he time the time of the the end of the time of the end you're just waiting you're feeding feing when time come to cook it off course neck the end of time for that turkey well we coming on to the end of time of all things so could be standing we want to push the word bless you musician thank you so much uh but even thank you so much for the song service appreciate I have two portion of scripture I like to read this morning Jeremiah 1: 11 to 12 and Isaiah 55 1 verse vers1 God bless thanks to see all of you all out here this morning Jeremiah 1 reading verse 11 moreover the word of the Lord came unto me saying Jeremiah what seest thou and I said I see a rod of an almond tree then said the Lord unto me thou are seen well thou has well seen for I will hasten my word to perform it Isaiah 5511 B says so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return to me void but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall press prosper in the thing where to I sent it let's bow our heads Heavenly Father we stand in all of your presence and we thank you for your mercy and your grace and I pray that reverence and respect will come for you more and more in this place in your house and among your people may you come and breathe upon your word and bring life to your people by Your Word through your word in Jesus name I ask it amen and amen you may be seated the scripture you read in Jeremiah I want to read it in the Amplified just to give a little a fresh uh meaning on it in the Amplified it reads moreover the word of the Lord came to me saying Jeremiah what do you see and I said I see a branch or Chute of an almond tree the emblem of alertness and activity blossoming in late winter then said said the Lord to me you have seen well for I am alert and active watching over my word to perform it and I want to get this part here he is alert and active watching over my word to perform it and the title of the message this morning is I am watching over my word to per perform it now the English word perform is derived from a old French perform per which means thoroughly and for is to complete does its original meaning is to bring to completion or to finish entirely so when he says he is watching over his word to perform it it means he want to bring it to full completion or to finish it sometimes they use the word perform as they use the word fulfill in some instances the use of the word perform it carries okay I'll skip that in Modern English however perform has lost its narrower focus on completing an act and can simply indicate doing an act does the English versions use perform as to do or to make but this is not just action this is God going and complete what he prophesied that would happen and I have an inspiration my word shall not return unto me void I news and as I get the news I'm going to share with you North Korea soldiers have now entered into the war with Ukraine and they are fighting along with the Russians they'll be fighting along with the Russians to go against Ukraine so North Korea has joined this thing in the Middle East now Russia has warned Israel about attacking Iran's nuclear facilities and so on like that Russia right now presently has warships in the ports of Iran at present right now Israel is been a attacked by four countries at the same time hisbah and and it just killed the head of Hamas the guy who was the orchestration orchestrator of what happened last year October and they got him by accident so the new see but we know that nothing is by accident but because that man got killed there's heavy repercussions that is going on right now so what I want to say is this things are heating up it's like a low burner and now is increasing right now amen so I want you to shake off your foolishness and your nonsense and get real that this is a real thing that we are confronted with so Russia warns Israel about bombing Iran nuclear facility Russia warships are now at the Port of Iran and they will be conducting exercising exercises with Iran in the next few days I read this before before I'll read it again B had seven Visions 1933 which is say must come to pass before Jesus Come Again the sixth Vision there arose America most beautiful but cruel woman she held the people in her complete power I believe this was the rise of the Roman Catholic Church though I knew it could possibly a vision of some woman rising in great power in America due to the popular vote by women am then in the sixth Vision There Rose up in America most beautiful but cruel woman the last and seven Vision was when I heard a most terrible explosion as I turned to look I saw nothing but Deb craters and smoke all over the land of America so this was Vision that he saw and you know how a vision comes the prophet go UPS into the knowledge of God that stretched out into prophecy into the stretched out into the future and he pulls it down and then prophesy so he's not hoping this happen it's a vision you see it and then you come back and see it so you're not seeing what you're not seeing what seest thou Jeremiah what seest thou elij they see it and they come and prophesy it and God is active over his word of Prophecy to ensure it come to pass what about your life what about the word over your life you don't feel sometime you don't what but but he is active whether you feel or you don't feel he is active over his own word that word is what is hanging over your life when the prophet stood and said this message will fall in the hands of the predestinated he was talking about you however it had to be done this message of the hour had to come to you he had to put you in the family put you in the right location put you to the of the right person he had to put you wherever you had to put you to make sure you get this word this is not Baptist Methodist Pentecostal this is an end time message for end time people that are about to get out of here give the Lord some [Applause] Praises [Applause] Hallelujah this is not a message of Kentucky Fried Chicken this a message of judgment he said behold I send you Elijah the prophet before the great and terrible day of the Lord because that day is coming hallelujah hallelujah praise God praise God I read this also picking up the other day an old book up here reading some of the things that the Lord had told and for told already come to pass about this juvenile stuff and how the war would come out and all those things has hit just two things left in one of those great prophecies that is for cars to be on the road with remote control looking like a egg only you don't drive it it controls itself and then there will be a great woman rise up because America is a woman's Nation a great woman will rise up and be president or something like that in the nation and then there will be total Annihilation the entire nation will be wiped out so the time I read this a couple of months ago I pre I think end the time end has come and I've told you that they were working on the car without steering wheel and without pedal I want you to say that this uh think last week or week before they launch that car so Whata just wanted to put on the clip let them see what we talking about a bit overnight in Los Angeles Elon Musk revealing his next destination the fully driverless cyber cap as you can see I just arrived in the rubber taxi the Cyber cab the Tesla CEO showing off what he says is the company's first fully autonomous Robo taxi with no steering wheel no pedals a whole lot of AI and a price tag of around3 ,000 you could fall asleep and wake up at your destination musk also hyping a robo van that can carry up to 20 passengers now can you imagine going down the streets and you see this coming towards you but critics are quick to question the timeline of that future musk says mass production of the Cyber cab is at least 2 years away I tend to be a little optimistic with time frames Tesla's stock dropping 8% today investor skeptical after musk's track record of over promising on deadlines it's still 4 years behind find competition there's a lot of ground for Tesla to make up that's for sure meanwhile competitors like Google's wh have been on the roads for years without drivers it's just me and the steering wheel here weo having logged more than 22 million driverless miles across four cities while Teslas with full self-driving capabilities still need a human in the driver's seat and even that Tech is under scrutiny earlier this year Federal Regulators said a critical safety Gap in Tesla's self-driving systems contributed to at least 467 collisions including 14 deaths we'll see autonomous cars become 10 times safer than a human but for now that promise of a cyber cab and full self-driving safety remains as elusive as an Android so that's it so you you call the car door is open you sit in it you punching your destination and you enjoy the ride there's no pedal to press there's no breaks to press there's no gas to press there's nothing to press there's no stearing to turn the car take you where you to go you could fall asleep and I will take you and that's is what the prophet saw in 1933 where at those time the scar was sare and black the color choices was black and black it was for in those times you could choose any kind of black but it was black and it was very Square now you see what he's talking about the egg shape curve like that this is what a vision is like going up in the spirit go forward into the Future come back and see what going to happen that's a vision so this makes the Bible such a powerful book more than just behave right and act right and live right the reality is a prophetic book that tell you what is and what is to come and how you are going to be prepare for what is Yet to Come he said watch and there will become a total anation the entire nation will be wiped out so much for who want to go and head for America I not tell you don't go to America you say p through there but all I'm telling you is that that nation is heading for total Destruction because you see the thing about it God is longsuffering and people misinterpret the longsuffering of God and and I said it sometime ago with Samson and this one was so shaking for me and scary for me because when Samson when the lla was trying to get information from Samson about his strength he began to lie and play games and whatnot but his strength was still there his power was still there when he give all to the ler and say about his here and she cut in the Bible said he Shake himself like before and the Bible said he knew not God was not with him so you see God could be with somebody oh got 20 years ago and 50 years ago and 100 years ago yeah but what happening now amen so what you want you not you don't want God that with you 5 10 15 20 100 years ago you want god with you now because Samson shook himself find himself without God all the time he thought was his gift his strength his ability and God strip him to come down to be a human like everybody else he didn't realize it was the anointing it was God's presence it was the Covenant that kept him all these years don't you take this for granted don't you take this message for granted don't you take this word for granted what has been keeping you all these years and don't take make an excuse because of the longsuffering of God that's why Noah preach 120 years because of the longsuffering of God but God was going and kill every one of them but Noah found Grace in the eyes of God and God get Noah to Bild a AR to see if there's anybody else who interested in Deliverance breakthrough and salvation and Noah and his family went inside the ark oh give the Lord some Praises somebody got the message somebody saw something oh glory to God go in that Ark with all them manimals yes because that was God's provided way because a flood was coming to flood the entire Earth Oh Glory to God he say he's not going to flood this Earth with FL water but fire next time oh glory to God we can hide from no fire fire coming Oh Glory to God we have to there's only one way that is up and out oh give the Lord some Praises praise God God told that Prophet go get that bride there's a bride in the earth there's a bride in Trinidad there's a bride around the world there's a bride that will meet God's requirement there'll be a bride with the extra oil there'll be a bride with Rapture in faith there will be a bride with Rapture in Grace there'll be a bride that will be a super Church a super race there will be a bride there'll be one more ride oh give the Lord some Praises glory to God hallelujah hallelujah glory to God Amen Hallelujah all the time the world want to admire This Man Called Diddy Puff Daddy puff didy whatever his name is now in prison a billionaire filthy guy yeah and somebody talking about they were seeing satanic worshiping in his place all the didd parties and whatnot they feel that his life they feel there a good life but they're playing with the devil a lot of them sign the soul over to the devil you know to get Fame and Fortune for a time and when the devil reeling his his stocks and his bonds and and make them pay what had to pay they will pay the price of it but there's going to be a bride that the devil will come after the devil the devil not interested in church folks you know the the devil interested in The Bride of Jesus Christ because she's the only one anointed and appointed to leave smoke in his face and leave here and he'll be vexed and angry so angry he will go after the remnant of the woman's seed all them nice message folks oh give the Lord of Praise that don't have Rapture in faith that don't have them seven tunders that give faith for Raptor in grace that don't have a Revival that don't have charity the brides absolute that don't have the token that don't have the Capstone Give the Lord some shouts Oh Glory that don't have Joseph rainbow coat Hallelujah everybody else have to stay back and be Cannon further for the BMS that about to be released Oh Glory to God Israel under tremendous pressure right now is Israel has lost a lot of soldiers just recently when last 48 hours or so Hallelujah there's a lot of pressure going around right now what about you what about your battles what about your fears oh praise God in the beginning was the word he said and the Word was with God and the Word was God the beginning was the logos and the logos was with Elohim and Elohim and the logos was Elohim isn't that right Hallelujah and before is a word had to be a thought so then God had to think it then speak it as a word so when you connect to the word you connect to the the thoughts of God how could you fail you have to come true Hall if you were in God's mind and God spoke you out as a seed a word and that word come to you and

challenge of the hour anywhere any time any place under any condition you have to come into that position to be that [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] the scripture like to find in Daniel we go talk about he is the one that has been the Affairs of men set up this one and set up that one so it's not like God sitting down with the arm Fen and God a care and God not concerned he set up kingdoms he set up Kings Hallelujah he set up Nebuchadnezzar he set up Putin and he retired Biden brother BR he is the god of the amen he never changes what he does never changes see when you get into this here you get into the real God not these Santa Claus chocolate cake God that they have now a good god he's sweet yeah he's chocolate listen to this he never changes what he does never

means that whatever he said to the first age to the second age to all the ages about his own true church about the false Vine is exactly right it won't change it means that what he started out with in Genesis he will finish in Revelation he has to be for he is the amen so let it be now now we can see again why the devil hates the Book of Genesis and Revelation he hates the truth he knows the truth

voice everybody could could could could take picture and go on Tik Tok and and get likes andall these things sayth the faithful and true witness now I want to show you what I find in the thought of faithful you know we often talk about a great unchanging God whose word does not change but when we speak of him after that manner we often get a view of him that makes him seem very impersonal it is as though God made the whole universe and all the laws that pertain to it and then stood back and became impersonal God it as though God made a way of salvation for lost mankind the way being the cross and then when the death of Christ had atoned for our sins and his resurrection give us the open door to him God just folded his arms stood back it is as if we majored in Believing on a great Creator who having created lost personal interest in his creation now I see that is how too many people are apt to think but that is wrong thinking for God is governing in the Affairs of men right now [Applause] so when Mary was pregnant and the government passed a law that you had to go and pay taxes in the village that you're born in and whatnot you join a protest gang and you take up a Facebook page to fight the government and fight taxes and fight that you see what Spirit you have Mary Mary in her pregnant self has to find her way back to the original place you know why because Jesus was going to born out of place if it remain as is that whole taxation story was to get Mary in position to get Jes into him oh give the Lord some praises and sometime God to flip so much things to get you in position sometimes you don't even know how you get where you get when you get go give the Lord some Praises but he is active he's alert and he is present over his word over your life to fulfill it

you were created for Hallelujah then Sim came along to fall and blinded the eyes of it and now Jesus came along and redeem it back now the father gives you the Holy Spirit to lead you and and guide you giving you all the Divine promises and I believe that this is God's word and if this is God's word as I believe it to be I believe that he's obligated to answer for me every promise that's in the book if I meet his conditions and he seals me into his kingdom by the Holy Spirit which I believe is not fanaticism though we have a lot of fastic with it yet it is not fism it is the truth and then God is obligated his word and to take care of his word he listen he watches over it to perform it so I want you to think about this God literally watching over his word that's why the Bible is perfect if the god of the universe can't write the book what we going trust man always apologizing in the newspaper and what not for lies to telling but God is not a man that going to lie he call out Babylon he call out all them he call them out let's go the Lord is our refuge and strength a very present help in a time of trouble and in the Redemptive names shama is the Lord is present Jehovah Gyra is provider Jehovah the provider is present but Jehovah shama is present so whenever Jehovah is present shama the name shama is in effect I am present in our midst I am present to heal I'm present to guide I'm present to instruct Moses parents instructed him because they had Revelation that that child was a special child that's why they put him in AR and sail him to pharaoh and what not they wasn't fearful because they know no alligator no tiger no lion nothing could touch that life that's ordained life onto our purpose but they couldn't bring Moses into illumination of his calling they could share by words from an intellectual standpoint you are called to this and Moses believeth his parents telling them what God told them but Moses himself never had a god encounter until he met the pillar of fire in the burning bush after flee in Egypt and unchill for 40 years but when that time up and he settled down now know we get mortgage now we get you house and now we got you fancy car now we settling down he planning now to buy some more acres and do this and do that and expand and whatnot that when God choose to say hey I want to talk with you fire attracted him he gone up there when God finished him so he come down he tell the wife going on Egypt she just going to the market tomorrow not down Market Egypt some say where going on the FL to take over Hallelujah they say Moses lost it but I when a man hear from God the vision is always bigger than you the plan is always bigger than you if you could do it why need God to tell you to do it but when the vision is Broad when the vision is great you could see how to be God to fulfill that purpose and when that purpose when the God bring the anointing of the purpose for your life nothing could break it nothing could stop it Hallelujah that's why saming to pray once more Lord he once had it so he can ask for a double portion he once had it so he could acttiv it again he once was in contact with it he lost it for how much years but he was in a position he found himself in a position where he could call once more Lord because the Lux was restored and the prophet labored to bring back these seven tunders these seven

yourself you know how God sees you a sinner saved a sinner by the grace of God if people laugh at you because you are the same last same dress say last month so what you saved money for you last month we have to become detached from the external voices external people remember a man probably talk about the man who was playing a piece and people clapping and applauding and he's waiting watching somebody up on the balcony there that's the man who train him he's wanting to see his reaction he's not concerned about all clapping maybe they don't even know see from D note in their ears is sounding good but when that man raised his hand to say was fine then he felt good because that is the man that train him somebody could play a PC set mistakes in it you hear no mistakes because you love it you love songing but somebody who really know music oh you hear that bad note yes yes but you a here no bad because you're not trained and therefore who we are to be playing for is not people around it is God and that's why all these women all these men who break through and press through note that they did it alone the one where the blood issue she pressed through alone and when she touched and she got healed Jus said who touch my clothesall hallu so this gangster and you always want somebody with you and always was somebody let we go and go and go and go you had to cut that out you know that means you have some maturing to do you have to make a choice yourself to serve God is the greatest thing you could do I am not talking about going to church there are too many people going to church and they're not serving God I'm not talking about going to church now I'm talking about serving God when nobody else is around you serving God when nobody is around you're loving God oh glory to God you know why Satan like silence worship it's called Universe personal and what keep silent secen by time Catholic finish you're dead know the reason the devil inflict them them silencing is to ignore God you know he said the silence is to ignore God you know that is pain God you know he is God and we're ignoring him like if he doesn't exist you keep in silent the Bible say keep not your silence praise God with a sultry praise God with a song praise God with a heart praise God with a loud song and instrument let everything that had bet praise the Lord praise the Lord oh give the Lord a shout the those hallelujah hallelujah Hallelujah where there is God there is noise hosana hosana hosana where there is God there's a shout God want you to worship him God want you to

business to act upon it but God will take care of it glory to God [Music] hallelujah be seated this is to come what I'm about to read God calling his children aside by manifestation they don't have to say one word about it you would see something happen positionally placing his son getting him into order he just has as much Authority his word is just as good as an AR angel or better the son was adopted put on a high place out there change his robe change his colors the father had a ceremony he said this is my son from hence forth he is Governor he's the ruler he's over all my inheritage all that I got belongs to him then we could go back to the same Elohim where he was self-existent then they come back to Jehovah who made something he gave man dominion over the Earth and what are we waiting for the manifestation the Earth is groaning just take any Divine promise listen to this you can take make take this statement it's on recording everything else but I say this and challenge anybody the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise of this word will bring it to pass regardless of what it is if God said so you take the right mental attitude towards the word it will bring it to pass so why should I preach anything less than the promises to you why should I go down the road a long Mor or long car or something so and you're stretching it stretching it stretching it stretching it without a promise you need the promises is by these promises we become partakers of his divine nature you need to know what God promised [Applause] you those scribe and Pharisees they have the books they have the tape they head straight down inside of it and they miss Jesus clean a woman at the well say we know when the Messiah cometh he shall do these things Give the Lord a shout that woman was more activated than God by the word to expect Jesus that she could say when the Messiah come he will do these things and Jesus said I that speak unto you am he direct identification of who he was because she was spiritually sensitive and spiritually aware that this man was different this man was bringing something completely different than the Scribe and the Pharisees and and so [Applause] on and God freed her Oh Glory something for go to free you know free you from your past we all have a past don't look at me don't look at me like that you all we all have a past I want to hear a bigger amen than that every one of us every one of you here have a pass and he can free you from your past let your past be your past it doesn't cancel your future that was just your past oh give the Lord a shout Oh Glory to God [Applause] [Music] we know in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the W was God and the Word was made flesh and dwell Among Us therefore here we go God and His word is a self same thing church are you ready here this it is God in print form that's why the devil that's try you to avoid the Bible you reading this book that book you're reading this listening to this he in this podcast hear in this and that that about the Bible no because those modern day preachers don't believe the Bible to be God you know they believe that that that translations until they become a translator themselves and they translating whatever they want to translate they feel God is one big Entertainer you know he need entertainment in Industry lights I I see a preacher thing and they have fire behind them not not not Holy Ghost Fire you know like a kind of camera fire thing and then that smoke and lights flashing and thing and they singing and people rejoicing that even atmosphere know that just entertainment justs have fire listen to this Jesus looked upon the audience and perceived their thoughts is that right perceive their thoughts the word of God is sharpen to Ed sword is that right Jesus was the word you believe that and he is the word and the Bible is Jesus in printed form So Daniel could look by books what the Prophet Jeremiah say because Jeremiah words is just God from the mouth of godall are you with me so I want you to come back now to the printed word the very text the very Bible because brother didn't come to reveal something outside the word he can reveal what was inside the word the word is first the word is God and when the angel came he compare what the angel said to what the Bible say because the Bible is the Anchor Point let's go amen 40 men wrote the Bible within the space of thousands of years apart never knowing one another seeing one another and not one would contradict one another it is inspired now many look at the Bible the Book of Ruth it's a love story of the Bible the Bible is a love story the whole Bible is a love story not only is a love story it's a prophet not only is a prophet it's history not only is a love story a history a prophet is God himself because in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God so the word is God on print that ought to settled brother God on print Jehovah printed on a book Hall and this story was written and all the old manuscripts when they were segre in the Bible holy men when they're trying to put it together in the Old Testament This Book of Ruth was one of the outstanding books that they accepted why it's just a love story why would the writers and ancient sages accept this book as inspired because there's a hidden revelation in it and in this in Revelation you catch the meaning it will bring you close to God and I pray my whole soul this morning that God will catch every heart so Spellbound till he reveal himself amen let's go now God knowing that this last days there will come intellectual Giants this is gol cousins and relatives it's just that this is intellectual Giants now those had physical Giants you could see them by their height and everything else and oo you know I mean you're not that same size but these guys you're not that same size either they on a different level there will come intellectual Giants there will come everything intellectual all kinds of the enemy with reasoning powers to try to prove to the church that there's a miracle is pass all this God packed in the baptism of Holy Ghost with what speaking in tongues interpretation of tongues prophecies gifts and all kind of things so if I come now and speaking Tong they say that but God pack all of that in the baptism of the Holy Ghost hallelujah hallelujah get this part watch this you say I just don't like to get down there I don't like to pray all night I don't like well then you're going to get killed out in the Battlefront you stay there till God equips you with the baptism of the spirit then everything you got need of in this world or the world to come lives right in you the all wise God know how to equip his army he equip it with the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's exactly what he sent for in the last days he knew he this he knew that we have to have it he knew that people would reason with go to reading this word when it become in print out here amen so he knew once it come spoken work on print they go read it explain it argue with it and reason with it there's got to come some group somebody somech somewhere who outside this reason intellectual thing it C A havoc in the message and those who pressing and playing they can't handle it you know because you have to press and play for they to see with you thees and scri you know Jesus come according to the book their books but according as Moses written of him he came according to that written prophecy oh praise the name of the Lord but Bram what good does it do to give a canary bird vitamins make him have good strong wings and keep him in a cage why they try to do that with people feed them all kind of vitamins and tell them these americ these birds in message the Mysteries but Mysteries oh good mystery upon mystery trumpets V plagues the whole the whole remedy Mysteries and people weaky no power no nothing God know it will take the baptism of the Holy Ghost to prove his Latter-Day signs listen we cannot leave here weav leaving spoken books devil we cannot leave here we even books to the government you know all closes down but we have the word it can't work you we sh the government word we can't go word doubt no it can't be that it had to be the witness of the spirit almost done all right so we're going very good after Pages we now on page n almost there Jeremiah again we want to read it moreover the word of the Lord came to me saying Jeremiah Amplified what do you see and I said I see a branch or a shoot of an almond tree the emblem of alertness and activity blossom in L with then the Lord said to me you have seen well for I am alert and active watching over my word to perform it now all about to read here I've read plenty times but I hope it struck different t tonight but Christ is the word God dwelt With Us in flesh he was the word before a word it's a thought a thought has to be created God thoughts become creation when it's spoken by a word he presented to you as a thought his thought it's revealed to you but it's still a thought until you speak it so this word that can't return void must come from somewhere so God will drop to you Revelation which is his thoughts but you still have to speak it and when you speak it it become a word oh give the Lord some Praises he presented to you as a thought his thought it's revealed to you then it's still a thought until you speak it now he said there's three Realms humanistic divine revelation and vision there only three real people live in people Liv in a natural realm humanistic realm I hoping hoping hoping Revelation is when it's revealed to you and vision that's thus say the Lord that's the completion that's the final you have a vision you know it's going to come to pass Moses went out to pray pill fire around him he said go and hold your stick towards East and call for flies so God could have tell Moses go and call for flies and Moses holy stick towards the east and shake it so no fly ain't coming you know he could thinking about flies no he had to speak it let there be flies and then them flies come there was no flies but when he went and held a sick and said let there be flies no flies at all yet went back but the words God's thought has already been spoken it's a word now it's got to happen Hallelujah now you see what Jesus said if you say this mountain if not if I say but if you say to the mountain me move now he said this now you can express it by a mental conception but if it becomes a real revelation of God you see it before it happen and express it in word form and God takes a whole and becomes material a taught Express almost done this is good Oho boyall did you ever think what Israel done in the wilderness there they married wives they raised children crops and so forth God blessed them and they prospered but they were still out of the promised land that's the way Pentecost is today 40 years ago you wouldn't have thought your mother and father wouldn't have spasm if they thought you would gotten the condition you in them oldtimers had tight was tight and absolute they held on to the word because of what it was he said now the hour has arrived he wants to get a church ready I'm going to say this with a prophetic voice voice I trust I'm not saying it in the name of the Lord but I believe that it is true the Rapture you'll be talking about the Rapture when the Rapture has been gone a long time you'll be saying bless God the Rapture is come it's done pass then Jesus said about John why does the scribe say John elas must first come you already come and you didn't know it one day there will come a judgment upon the earth and the first thing you know you're going to find people here looking for the Rapture and they done be been gone a long time ago it will be such a minority he said as in one the days of Noah so shall it be in the coming of the son of man he said we think this great big bunch of Canon further here Atomic Ash is going it's only go if it's got the Life of Christ in it so he's saying the amount of church folks WR is like Atomic Ash the only thing going is with those with the Life of Christ in it there will be a raptor you think two or three people here one over there one over there somewhere going missing watch looking for the Rapture is already passed God places his great power out of his church and take a group in Praise the Lord now this the part I want to get to H you see we living in a terrific time mustion come up please and that's the pressure is upon the church you want to see something you want to see something but now how can God ever watch over his word to vindicate it and a person disbel in that word won't receive it in their heart how can the sun shine upon a seed and bring it to life when it hasn't got any life in it it's got to be germatize seed so a Creed is gered listen listen a Creed brother George is gerti to make more members but the word is dramatized to make Saints to make Believers that's right God works to perform his word numbers 29:19 says God is not a man that he should lie neither the son of man that he should repent at he said shall he not do it at he spoken shall he not make it good Hallelujah the Amplified God is not a man that he would tell or act a lie neither the son of man that he would feel repentance or compunction for what he has promised has he said and shall he not do it has he spoken and shall he not make it good I'm going to wrap up God has promised to bless his word he will watch over his word to perform and take care of it do you believe it but I'm talking about the church is no longer the mouthpiece of God it is his own mouthpiece so God is turning on her he will confound her through the prophet and the bride here this part for the voice of God will be in her not on the books and tapes what are the books and tipes coming in her the voice of God and then he give a scripture for R 17 says the spirit and the bride say come once more the world will hear direct from God because the word heard direct from God in a prophet now they will hear direct from God in a bride Hallelujah not pressing play but direct from God like how Peter said this is the stone you bu is refused this is that that the prophet Jo speaker hallelujah hallelujah look at that I'm really done I'm on the last page oh praise God hallelujah but not by speaking in tongues not by dancing in the spirit not by joining church but by fruit of the spirit Christian sanss canot SM anyone that it's the word living there it is if they only looked he was Messiah he was the word living made manifest and a man that's got the spirit of God in him or woman lives that word right out in them that's the heartbeat the predestinated here we go for the word of the Lord comes to them and they are the word to the people so the word of the Lord comes to the predestinated so you could get the word coming directly to you this is it hallelujah hallelujah you begin to play something We Believe last quote that there is to be a church in these last days that will receive both former and latter Reign it will be scattered throughout the world in this loud Eastern age it will be a church that is called back to the original faith in God it will be a church that will have Jesus Christ walking in it manifesting himself the shout of the king will be in it may the Lord bless you praise God I chust this message will do something special for you that God himself would watch over his word to perform it God bless [Applause] [Music] you thank you Jesus raise your hands and give him praise this morning give him praise thank you Lord thank you Lord thank you Jesus hallelujah hallelujah
