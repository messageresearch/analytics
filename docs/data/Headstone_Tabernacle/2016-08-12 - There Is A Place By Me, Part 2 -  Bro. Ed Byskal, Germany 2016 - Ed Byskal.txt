evening Saints you may be seated thank you very much brother Sigma colen brener asked me to say a few words to you tonight of something God put on my heart and then we'll take the prayer requests and I want also to testify that I've been very very blessed attending this convention and it's wonderful to be almost once week together in one place one Accord focusing our eyes on the Lord Jesus Christ and his word the Reb word of the hour and just fellowshipping with Brothers and Sisters in Christ it's just a an osis you know of of Peace of joy of faith and I believe God knew we needed that am because we live in very hard times as we all know and and God wants to strengthen us so God gives us always the best so uh I really want to thank brother sigar col brener and his team for following the leadership of the holy spirit amen amen I believe that amen and I really believe as it was already said that it was God who planed it and God who organized it and I really appreciate brother Sigmar Spirit of wanting to draw a bigger Circle amen amen amen praise the Lord amen because it's true that it's quite unique that uh brothers and sisters who may have different understandings of certain points of the message can just stay for days under the same roof and worship together and smile at each other and and hug each other you know it's it's a miracle amen praise the Lord for that amen and I be I believe that God has given us this week his best ministers for this occasion and each one with a different flavor a different inspiration but all of them pointing us to the same Lord Jesus Christ who has been revealed in the last days so personally I was really inspired by everything I saw and heard and I was also deeply moved in my heart a few times I had to help with the translations and the French speaking noticed it sometimes I could hardly translate I was so moved you know uh tears were coming to my eyes when I would hear the word and the testimonies of the reality of God Jesus Christ today no I just love that just love that you know amen amen and um I know some of you we have known each other for a number of years it's so good whether here or elsewhere to be able to see one another and to say God bless you brother God bless you Sister by God's grace we are still on the way amen by God's grace in spite of all the attacks of the devil who are still standing on the word Standing on the Promises we thank God for that amen it is not us holding him it is him holding us he's so good praise the Lord for that and I also share brother sigar's burden for the young people because you young people will love you we appreciate you and you are the future of any church we don't know how long the Lord will car before he comes back but somebody has to fill our shoes somebody has to carry on and take the torch and move on it will be you so I believe in you I believe in the potential that God has put in you and we're just here just not to make decisions for you are just here to encourage you to to pray for you to to help you to coach you we want you to succeed with Christ and all of us myself included we have been following somebody footstep steps I am what I am today at 66 years old because God has put before me men or women of God real Christians who were examples to me in my family in the church in the ministry here and overseas people who have been a a help a blessing an encouragement to me amen and I I thank the Lord so much that we have you know Role Models examples that we can follow amen thank you Lord for that and also want to thank God for putting the right people on my path from my birth until today just to to help me to encourage me and several of these people are right here brother add or different ones are some of them who have really encouraged me and helped me along the way and I want to be grateful for that and I believe that we are living in a tremendous time we all know that it's getting better and better for the bride and worse and worse for the world but one thing that that has struck me years ago that that is coming becoming more and more plain as years go by is that is that I believe that we live right now in the apocalypse you know it's a Greek word meaning Revelation it's a great unveiling time and uh and it's a privilege that you and I have been chosen by God to live in the last days no in the days where everything comes to to a completion to a um to a climax you know it won't go any further the good and the bad just arrive to the top to the climax and you and I we are partakers and Spectators of what's happening and uh different Brothers have mentioned that which I really believe that are our calling is to make the word of God real to the people and I really want that I really love that I really need that I love theology even though I am not a theologian never went to Bible School have no degree but I love to see that word becoming real I want something that is a reality and I believe you and I we have been given the the privilege of uh of having a part in God's word becoming a reality in these last days and um concerning the young people I have gone through that stage I was raised by a believing mother and believing grandparents and U it was a great help to me they believed in God God they trusted God so for a number of years I benefited from their faith their experiences with God but it was a good surrounding but the T the day came when God saw that I needed to make my own experiences with God to have not a secondhand Faith or Revelation but to have a firsthand faith in Revelation amen and and in my life by God's grace it started at a young age I was blessed to hear brother Tim also mentioned how at 5 years old God dealt with him I was a little older I was eight and a half when God started to deal with me in a Pentecostal church and I gave my heart to the Lord I accepted him as my personal Savior and Lord and this is a choice I have never never regretted I had my ups and downs my good days and bad days but that choice I never regretted it and uh to know that there was somebody somewhere who loved me more than anyone else who cared for me who wanted to bless me to strengthen me to guide me I needed that as a little boy I needed a a real father who looked after me and God revealed himself to me inide such a matter in such a way and um and about a year later I was uh in Denmark with my mother and there alone in a room I had a an encounter with God I had I had been a good boy on that day and my mom was disappointed with me and she she went to church by herself I said alone in the room I got on my knees said Lord forgive me help me Lord to be a better boy and every time this is my testimony every time I can humble myself make myself little he comes down and he came down and after me repenting and asking for his help he just fill my heart with his Joy with his peace and when I was watching brother brother Kenny this morning and at about the same age as me and just having so much energy and to praise the Lord and to to testify and everything well it brought me back to that time when I was 9 and a half and the Holy Spirit came down upon me I couldn't worship or praise the Lord in my language French anymore I had no more words but then something Supernatural happened and God gave me other words and other language to continue to praise Him amen and I was so happy just overflowing I was just just jumping from one bed to the other just praising the Lord in unknown tongues Hallelujah so so just looking at my brother he just brought me back to that experience I say Lord um a few more years now but Lord I want to keep that Joy I want to keep that enthusiasm to to serve you to know you to please you and uh about six months later I was not quite 10 years old again had I had had a bad day I even rebelled against God because I was going through hardships and things and but then I had to repent because that was wrong God is never guilty for uh your your troubles and your problems no God is a good god so once again I had to get on my knees say oh God I'm sorry forgive me for my Rebellion Lord you are not at fault you are good you are right you are love and again I guess my repentance pleased God and again something came in me and God started to speak to me inwardly I was just a little boy I just say that not to uh speak about myself or to uh lift up myself but just to encourage the young people don't wait too long long don't wait until you are 30 40 50 60 to think about surrendering your life to the Lord the sooner the better that's what I believe amen the sooner the better it's just to say it's possible it's possible so what what am I doing just trying to tell you follow these footsteps I'm not a perfect example but God has been good to me God has been gracious to me and this is my prayer and my desire for each one of you young people especially and older people too just keep your eyes on the Lord Jesus keep your eyes on the word put him first in your life you know he will be so good so sweet to you you will never regret it so as I was on my knees again just asking God to forgive me for my rebellion and my mistakes and my my bad behavior again he spoke to my heart and these are the words he spoke to me which can be good for all of us he said my son listen to my voice for my word is the truth and then he went on saying that he wanted me to preach his word so like brother Tim said he said I have always known God had called me to preach the word so when it's a calling it comes from him it's not something that we make up so God was so good and in in the early 60s I was just a young boy in my teens I was given a book with a black cover and a big red cross and it was the French translation of a book a man sent from God and there's a Bo boy I read that book you know that book a man sent from God it spoke about the calling and the the life of William Branham a man sent from God In Our Generation and as a boy I read that book along with my Bible and I was so moved to see how the Lord called him out of a poor family and the trials he went through and also the way God used him and and glorified himself through through him I was just so blessed and I said Lord I wish that I could meet this man one day that was my dream because I was so impressed by the dedication the humility and the reality of God in the life and Ministry of this man but at the end of 65 I already in the local paper that the Evangelist William brunham had passed away due to a car accident and I was so sad my dream couldn't be fulfilled but a few years later a minister came to loan Switzerland told us that we lived in the last days and said that God fulfilled his word his promise according to Malachi 4 that he God had sent a prophet with the spirit of Elijah and this man said I have met this man I know him his name is William Maran Bram when I heard that name I said it brought me back to that book a medine from God and I said that evangelist is also God's Prophet oh it really Drew my attention if is really God's end time Prophet what did he say so I'm just saying that to you I was 18 so you young people of about 18 years old have an interest for the word be curious look for yourself read for yourself listen for yourself you know everyone needs his own personal experience and I thank God because you know what to make us real Christians it's more than just had knowledge it's much more than Theology and Theory the word must be become flesh in us and it can only become flesh in us when we go through personal experiences just to give you a very simple example to make it very plain parents tell their children please don't touch the stove it's hot you will get burnt some obey listen some don't and maybe some children they just want to try when no nobody's looking so the time when they just put their hand on the hot stove what happens they get burnt immediately they they start screaming and Mom or Dad run to their rescue it's a painful experience but it's very positive because from the that day on they know for sure that the stove is hot that's right nobody can talk them out of it they are convinced so I believe that we need you need I need more more experiences with God the word says one thing the message says one thing that's tremendous but that's not enough we must experience it personally and then the word and us become one and then you are unshakable nobody can make you change your mind you know that you know that you knowen so when I heard that I said man if William Brenham is God's Prophet what message did he bring in those days there was hardly anything translated in the French language so I I was able to get a hold of a few books in English the Seven Seals seven Church AG book and a few others and with the help of a dictionary and just a very small knowledge of the English language I started to read these books that was my choice that was my experience my desire I wanted to know what this man sent from God had spoken to us it was not second hand it was first hand and one thing it produced in my life it shook me up I had been a Christian for 10 years had spiritual gifts experienced Divine Healing water baptism in the titles and things like that but when I I was reading these books of this Prophet I realize one thing if Jesus comes today I am not ready it was as though I was standing before my judge like the brothers have expressed when they preached like brother George or brother Kenny or different ones or brother Ed also when we stand before that word which is God we cannot hide anything he knows everything about us maybe nobody knew certain things but God knew and before that word I understood is is no time to play now be serious so young people I want to encourage you let the word of God judge your life don't take it just to increase your your knowledge that's not enough this word is meant to judge you not only outwardly but also inwardly even your thoughts are being judged but what is beautiful about it it's a judgment under grace it was not a judgment to condemn me it was a judgment to help me it was like God saying there's a Rapture in front of you Jesus will come back for a Perfect Bride if you want to go you need to go through a quality check and studying this word this message it was just exposing my life to the word and saying lord judge me judge me give me that quality check Lord I don't want to miss the rapture I want to be a part of that perfect blameless spotless bride so that's that's the way God has dealt with me I just pray can maybe help some of you and then I thought my I need more of that word this I just have two or three books but that's not enough there's a whole message so I decided to quit my job at the bank and go to the United States to get more of the message I I I put aside my my career in the bank in Switzerland and I said no this comes first this is important and I believe we live in a time and day when the word must come first before anything else you study you have plans you have Ambitions you have many things like that but let this word come first in your life I just say that because I can just give God thanks today he has been so good so gracious to me so kind so sweet and I believe that by his grace and I don't say that to be boastful I just say that to glorify God Amen I believe that my life in spite of my failures in spite of my mistakes in spite of my ups and downs My Life as a human being has been a success for God that's my testimony be encouraged God wants your life each one of you especially you young people to be a success for Christ a life worth living on the earth I believe God wants that for each one of us because we are his bride we are precious in His sight he cares for us like for the apple of his eye and personally I'm always looking for reality you know I don't like just to to look at the at a facade I want to know what's behind it to me I'm not satisfied with just a Pious facade a cover up or a form of godliness in my life in the life of my people I want reality and I believe that God has given us this message it's a message like no other message we know that no it's a message that exposes us and there's a scripture I would like to leave with you trust brother sigar not taking too much time but just sharing something on my heart but I stop as soon as possible in Luke 12 1 and two I believe it applies to our time beware ye of the leaven of the phes which is hypocrisy for there's nothing covered that shall not be revealed Apocalypto revealed unveiled neither head that shall not be known I believe you and I will live in the last days but it's a time when God unveils reveals everything I say everything in every domain in in everything there's an unveiling a general worldwide unveiling of everything because the scripture must be fulfilled but to me a beautiful age because when everything is unveiled everything becomes clear there's no guessing about it anymore before I was praying a Triune God the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost I was confused but when through the message God unveiled himself it became clear I'm worshiping and praying to one God who has different offices different functions but it's always one when things become clear you know where you can stand it's so good I don't like to be the something that is foggy hazy you don't know where you are I like it very clear this is what the message has brought to me something making things clear and since the opening of the seeds in 1963 this is what I saw I don't know what you saw but what I saw Jesus Christ unveiled himself but he also unveiled the devil who was hiding under a camouflage now we know how to recogn the devil in whatever form he comes but also since then we can see so many things in the world being unveiled in politics in the finance in everything thank you brother and and I believe this is a great day everything is coming to the open in sports in everything what a great day and God has chosen you and I to live in that day so now this is my heart's desire now that we live in the time of the open book brother braham's life was an open book to us and I pray that my life your life will also be an open book transparency hiding nothing being what we are what God made us good or bad let's be sincere let's be real and I believe that God will just bless us and use us to his glory so I just uh want to give God thanks and praise for being so good to me and uh God is good to you too praise the Lord for that amen and I pray that all of us will be able to pray like the Lord Jesus father I have glorified thee on the earth I have finished the work which thou gavest me me to do like we we've heard this week we all have something to do for the Lord Let's Be Active but let us finish that work and glorify God in everything we do and say I believe we have been called for that so tonight we have a few prayer requests very serious prayer request from a person jonel Peru persu from Romania I feel I am weak in the spirit I would like a touch from the Lord so he would give me strength and spiritual healing for my soul may the Lord richly bless you thank you Shalom a touch from the Lord I don't know if it's probably a brother jonell I'm not sure so may God grant this request another request from Sister Edith her corn in uten German please pray for my mother sister Lou graph she was in the meetings with brother Branham and K together with my father who was a Nasher there at the platform seeing many signs wonders and healings now my mother suffers very much with dementia she forgot the most things of her life and parts of her children but never her Lord Jesus praise the Lord and brother Branham wonderful yesterday evening at the end of the meeting I felt the Lord challenged me why don't you believe that her mind her mind can come back so please pray and believe with me for her recovering sister Edith please pray for sister swea swea for the last two month she lost her father and her brother who died of can cancer she has cancer too I believe she can be healed by the prayer of the Saints may God bless her marriage she was married this August the 5th and God give them a child yeah sister Galina Fritz okay so please stand as we present these request to the Lord we have heard so much preach to us about about who we are AOS in the word AOS in Christ so we all believe that with all of our heart but now as God has revealed to us who we are what position we have in the body of Christ may God just Quicken these words so we can just stand where God put us and as we stand on the word which gives us our true identity then God gives us his authority we are nothing we are weak but we have his authority so by God's Authority I believe we can push Satan back we can push death back and we can claim life healing Victory Deliverance filling of the Holy Ghost and everything so I I believe time has come now for a greater reality in our lives in our midst in our churches so as we bow our heads in respect we just want to to present these three requests and if you have other requests that are Unspoken You know God knows and God wants to glorify himself wonderful Lord what you just here to give thee thanks because we are the fruit the product of your grace nothing that we can boast about nothing we can be proud about but just recognizing your goodness your predestination your grace in our lives and Lord if you have called us to be a part of your bride and to receive the end message Lord we believe it was for a purpose Lord you wanted to be made manifest in bright form so Lord as your people are standing tonight with a holy reverence before your face and a lot of humility and also our faith has been strengthened by the hearing of the word all these week so lord it's not a feeling it's a reality your word cannot fail so Lord we pray together for this person jonel Peru who would like a touch from you to be strengthened in the spirit oh God we commit this person into your hand Lord it is certainly your will Lord that your children be strong in their spirit that be strong in their soul that they can have a strong testimony of your reality so God answer this prayer we pray as we ask it in the way Wonderful Name of Jesus Christ and for his glory Lord we pray also for this sister who is dementia who cannot recognize the people and forgetting many things oh God this person's mind has been affected and Lord it is so sad Lord that this person cannot communicate with her surrounding like before Lord we we have compassion for this situation lord lord it's so difficult the person is there but there's a break in the relationship because of the dementia but oh God you can restore you have restored your word you have restored us you can restore this person Lord we just use we just just unite our faith oh God looking right to you and to your word and your promises and to the finished work at Calvary it is done it is finished we just have to claim it to take a hold of it Lord we want to trust you for this dear sister Lord oh God we send your word right now in the name of Jesus Christ Hallelujah and your word as a seed has healing power in it we send your word Lord to that person for complete recovery for your honor and glory and Lord we pray for that other sister who who has cancer she already lost two persons in her family but now she has that your Prophet preached to us on do you fear cancer Lord we don't want to fear cancer because the one who is in US is greater than the cancer so oh god with faith believing we just stand up against that cancer against these rebellious cells that try to take the life of our sister and we say Satan get your hands off she's a child of God Redeemed by the blood of Jesus Christ and the Church of the Living God is uniting her faith with that sister and her family and we just take authority over that sickness an authority that Jesus Christ has given us to over will come so Satan we command you in the name of Jesus Christ get away we cast you away in the name of Jesus Christ you must obey you have no [Music] choice we know who we are we know who our Lord is and we believe his word let it be for the glory of God father we just give you thanks for being so good and kind to us we commit the rest of the service into your hands and the preaching of the word bless brother Ed bisc in what you have laid on his heart we are under expectation Lord we opening our heart

give ourselves to you completely amen and amen amen amen you may be seated I I would like to just simply say when the when God prepared a sacrifice in the form of Jesus Christ and the scripture says Jesus uh quoted he he spoke the words and he quoted the scripture actually it is from the Old Testament as well and and he said in Hebrews wherefor when he cometh into the world he saith sacrifice and offering thou wouldst not but a body hast thou prepared me and I read that scripture I believe the first uh Service uh but something that I would like to convey to you is that the preparation of a body there is the body of Jesus Christ that was for sacrifice and then the body of Jesus Christ which is the Bride of Jesus Christ the prophet said the life for that body came from the side of the Lord Jesus Christ where bone of his bone Spirit of his Spirit life of his life and I think that we would want to rejoice when we see that the the heartbeat of this bride is to get the last one in the the ultimate is actually the ultimate is is in even the meaning of a body hast thou prepared me and this is this is it just before I inv invite uh brother Tim Dodd to show the slides that he has prepared prepared and to to prepare the body is number one is about five items number one to perfect and make complete that's his intention for you number two formed into what it ought to be and the prophet uses that phrase what we ought to be that is a body hast thou prepared me to what it ought to be number three is that having special aptitude talents or qualities and number four is for a certain season of time and the word that follows that is now in other words you have been prepared for this moment you have been given special aptitude special talents special characteristics for this moment this is not what the disciples uh this is not what the disciples had or those that were in the Reformation or those that were in other ages but God prepares this is part of the preparation and if you are part of that body then you will fully expect to be formed into the uh into the type of body that he wants us this very moment and the last is probably the most wonderful the intent of the body all of the preparation is that it would be raised up and what would be raised up shall be taken away and that's what the word prepared means isn't that wonderful isn't that wonderful the intention of God is Not only that we uh have a good time is not only that we hear are instructed that's not all the intention is that this body shall be lifted and elevated into Heavenly places that this body will be not only raised but taken away and that's what it means to say a body hast thou prepared me and I trust you can say that hallelujah amen we have two things what has happened just while we're seated here is taking place in Ethiopia and secondly what has taking place in China brother Tim would you come [Applause] please amen it's good to be gathered together with you tonight and uh I don't as brother Ed said we're going to make this extremely brief so don't blink don't fall asleep we're going to just make this really fast because we want to give maximum time to the word amen and uh uh as brother Ed said I work with them in missions and uh I won't go into the details of it other than to say there are some outstanding things that are happening around the world and I'm just going to go right to these slides here and talk about just for a moment a second book of Acts that is not future tense that is present tense that's what is happening right now uh brother Bram talks about it in the token message and he says now he says ' when he said you must be born again that don't mean jump up and down at the altar that don't mean walk back there and shake hands with the pastor that don't mean all this foolishness that we've seen done it don't mean putting your name on the church book it means Death to Your First being and life to the second being can we say Amen to that it means that the blood has been applied and you're identified by the life of Jesus Christ and and if he be the vine and we are the branches now let me just stop here for a second when Jesus in John 15 says I'm the vine you're the branches he's speaking to those that are the first first book of Acts is that right but now there's to be a second book of Acts and so he says he says uh if he be the vine and we be the branches the life that's in the branch is also from the vine it'll bear the fruit he says if the first first Branch come forth that Branch out of the vine that wrote a book of Acts behind it if that vine puts forth another Branch they'll write another book of Acts behind it because it's the same life amen it's not you it's the life that's in you that writes the book of Acts and what is the book of Acts we know the book of Acts has Doctrine it's where we get water baptism from but it's not Doctrine alone it's the record of the acts of the holy spirit in the church and the and the book of Acts is not just acts chapter 2 where they were filled with the Holy Ghost but the Holy Ghost put them into action the Holy Ghost put them into action that what that's what the Holy Ghost is about I don't want to get preaching here I have to carry on I want to just give you a little testimony here as we press on because uh bi at bible Believers uh you know what is Bible Believers Bible Believers is not just Cloverdale Bible way it's not just brother Ed bcll but it's it's like-minded people all around the world that support missions needs under the guidance of brother bis's Ministry and uh we're large we are known in a great way for printing books but our object is to get the message into the hands of the local people that's our our objective is to get God's love letter to his bride God loves his bride we are we bride here God loves his [Applause] bride and if God loves his love letter to his bride then those who carry his love letter God will bless amen because God's objective is not to um I'm sorry I'm getting to preach so uh we get uh I want to just give this short little testimony because something happened to me two years ago uh and that was a real surprise to me and I I just thought I'd start with this before I go to Ethiopia in that uh uh I was in India and a young man stepped into the room where before I was about to preach and he says do you remember me and I looked at him and he was about 22 years old and I I said I looked at him and as I'm looking at him my mind goes back to an instance about 10 years earlier when I was in India and this young man here came up to me with a lot of questions and he he was at the end of a service and and he had different questions and finally he said I want you to prove to me that what you preach is the truth because right now I'm studying with the Catholic church but I'm from a seik family and uh I've learned all different religions what makes what you're saying the truth and I want you to prove it to me and so I thought how can I prove it to this man saw this young man I think he was about 12 years old and I told him I can't prove it to you I said only God can prove it to you I said but what I want you to do I says I want you to ask this pastor and I was at brother sardar's Church stand up brother Sardar and I was at this man's church and and I said you uh you ask this man for some books he'll give you some books and then you read those books and you ask God personally to make it real to you and he will vindicate it to you personally and so now I'm standing with that young man in the room and I'm saying are you that young man and he says I'm that young man and God had miraculously converted him and made her made him a preacher of this message that has has won many souls to the Lord Jesus Christ we have a message with life in it and it produces results and that young man is standing right there at the back he's one of the translators wave your hand brother malit he went from this to that praise the Lord in the book what is the book of Acts in Acts chapter 8 it says the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip saying arise and go towards the South unto the way that goeth from Jerusalem to Gaza which is the desert and he arose one man and behold a man of Ethiopia a unic of great Authority Under Candice Queen of the Ethiopians who had charge of all its treasure and had come to Jerusalem for to worship and I won't read the rest of the script scripture but you know the story the Ethiopian unic after Philip had been called away from a Revival Philip had been called away from a big Gathering but now to go individually to a country to speak to an individual that was traveling through that was going to a country called Ethiopia that's the book of Acts often just two men standing alone in a field perhaps and that's how the work began in Ethiopia Now by way of background Ethiopia has never been colonized so they don't speak English they don't speak German they don't speak French they don't speak Spanish they don't speak any of the European languages they speak their own languages and the message has never made an impact upon that country though over the years some have tried to take the message into Ethiopia but there had been no real results and it's uh uh and it had always been something that was upon my heart in a general sense of the term for some reason I'd never been to Ethiopia but for some reason always thought about Ethiopia and then all of a sudden what after ID moved uh down to Cloverdale and begin to work in missions in one week three brothers from un unconnected to each other from three different areas one by phone one by email and another walked into my office in the same week and said brother Tim what are we doing for Ethiopia and so I knew God was saying we need to do something for Ethiopia and I went into brother bis's office and I talked to brother bisc about it and I said this is what happened and he agreed with me that this seemed to be the Lord's timing but how to do it was the question at this time we had been in contact with a young brother from Uganda whom you heard about already from brother biso and he's a a a very fiery young evangelist and very energetic and full of life and full of the Holy Spirit and uh just as a desire to to do things for God and he had contacted me to do his wedding and he was getting married in January of 2013 and I told him no I won't come and do your come to Uganda just to do your wedding but I said to him our young people from our our school are going to Uganda in March so two months later I said if you'll postpone your wedding for two months I'll come with the young people and we'll do your wedding while we're doing other Ministry and I thought no problem he'll never postpone his wedding if I was a young man I wouldn't postpone my wedding somebody say Amen but he phoned me back or he texted me back the next week and said brother Tim even though it will cost the best man being unable to make it I feel God's asking me to change my wedding so you can do it and so so that had happened there and then uh and then I had heard from these three brothers and we begin to think about Ethiopia and I'm wondering how are we going to find out what God wants to do in Ethiopia and a thought comes to my mind and I contacted this young brother and I said to him I says what are you doing for a honeymoon and of course and many of you African Brothers as many of you African Brothers know most Africans don't take a honeymoon because they can't afford it they get married they go home life continues on and so he said we don't have a honeymoon planned I said well how about if I buy you and your wife two tickets to Ethiopia and you can go to Ethiopia for two weeks on your honeymoon knowing in my mind this man had an Evangelistic gift and if God's going to use him he just may well open the door in Ethiopia now I have to jump forward they get married they go to Ethiopia they're on their honeymoon they pass by the the country of Kenya in Kenya he meets this man darissa is his name he's an Ethiopian he's not just an Ethiopian he's the United ntion one of the United Nations translators for the Ethiopian language into English and God sovereignly directs their paths he introduces the message to this man he receives Christ is baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and immediately begins to Embark upon translation not only that he had a brother in the country of Ethiopia this man is a refugee from Ethiopia that's living in Kenya he has a brother in Ethiopia and he gives brother bsabi his contact excuse me I'll call him brother bus which is what we call him for short he gives brother bus his contact in Ethiopia a for his brother so he goes to Ethiopia he meets his brother who speaks a little bit of English and as he he introduces the message to him that man also receives the message and his is baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ now remember they're on their honeymoon they're on their honeymoon you European people think about this now all of you that are married anyway and uh you know they they God is really opening doors at this time and and actually is continued to do so but as this man is baptized and recognizes God just just pours out the the revelation of his word upon him and he remembers a sister in the Pentecostal church that he knows not a natural sister but a spiritual sister who's hungry for God so he calls her and he says you need to meet these people so she comes uh this brother's name here is uh kumasa which by the way uh there he is now sitting on the front row of the church there playing his instrument and uh he uh calls this other sister sister yodit we would say Judith in English but her name is sister yodit in Ethiopian and says you need to meet these people so she comes over to where they're staying on their honeymoon and brother bus introduces the message to her the Holy Spirit quickens it to her she says I must be baptized while while brother bus is witnessing to her his wife excuses herself and goes into the washroom and and she he is wondering why is she taking so long in the bathroom and he come to find out later she's in the bathroom praying while her husband is witnessing to this woman I'll tell you what these people are real Believers and so the this the word quickens this woman she says I need to be baptized it's about 9:00 at night brother bus says I don't know where to baptize you she says I'll find a place I'll be back he says all right but don't come back till tomorrow he says just give me a night's rest and and so she come back the next morning she was there at 9:00 in the morning saying I found a place come and baptize me and she was baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ This Woman become instrumental in the fact that she speaks very good English and and she speaks the local language very well and God begin to use her in the initial stages of the work there like Lydia in Philippi how that she became uh useful as a translator and interpreter for them into the local language so as they would meet people and travel and even she opened doors for them to go into churches and to preach the gospel uh and and she had to be The Interpreter because that's all they had is The Interpreter just like brother brandham in the beginning of his ministry that would use a sister as an interpreter when there was no other resources so she was she was used of God to spread the gospel amen God taking a hold of her life and and moving in a supernatural way let me just carry on here I'm going to take up too much time this is Sister yodit now and brother bus is on the right and they travel to another town with brother Paul and they meet they meet a man on the street and they they say to him do you know where we can get some food and he he tells them where they can get some food and uh uh and he they say to him well give us your contact information and he says well why do you want my contact information because we're missionaries and we've come here to share the Gospel of Jesus Christ and so so they connect with this man and it turns out that he is a man that has just finished his law degree in University and has majored in English and so now he uh they introduced to him the gospel and God strikes him that these people have come from a long way always a way to tell him the truth and he Embraces the end time message and is baptized almost immediately in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and this is brother mogus or we would say Moses but brother mogus there in Ethiopia is now the main translator in the most popular language in that country in all we're actually translating already into three languages in Ethiopia and we have in total almost 20 translations already because these people need the word in their language here they are now in the new church that has just been established there in the basement of a building and this is actually brother mogus you see standing on the left he's interpreting uh sister Yodi you can see on the far left in the front row brother uh kumasa there and several other believers some of whom one of whom was baptized even while I was there in March of this year God is moving there in a supernatural way I don't have time to share all the stories but I'll just tell you so far there's been over 35 people baptized I I there's developments amen there's developments almost daily in that Country open doors people wanting to hear the word people being receptive to the word in a country where the message has never taken a hold God is going to find his last predestinated seed and when the last one comes in we're going home amen you heard brother Tim puit say it the other day it's it's not totally unselfish that we do Mission work it's actually selfish we want to go home but we're not going home until the last one comes in let me put it another way you're not going home until the last predestinated seed has come in the brothers were were doing the brothers were doing a U uh one of their missionary trips in brother buosi now lives in the country with his family lovely family and uh they've had two children since they've been married and uh the uh he and another brother were traveling there on one trip they were going down the street and uh uh one of the street workers um begin to call out to them one of the women of the street begin to call out to them thinking they were businessmen or something that she might get some business and like Peter and John at the gate called Beautiful it was Silver and Gold Have I None but what we have we're going to give you and they turn to her and begin to introduce Jesus Christ to this poor street prostitute who it turns out was an orphan and had to do what she did because she there was no other way to put food in her mouth mouth and prostitution is legal in Ethiopia but God opened this woman's eyes and she became miraculously delivered and became a Believer baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ again I can't go into all the I'm just going to stop that there one of the great tools that we have is something that I want to introduce to you uh many of you have heard of it I've shown number of people around but it's I'm always amazed how many people don't know about this and that is a Bible app that we've developed not for English though English is in it but the purpose is to put connect the message to the Bible so that brother briham becomes the commentary to the Bible and to put it in as many languages as possible so that all of these countries have the message in their language I was just talking to uh the angolan brothers that were here and they have a huge need for message books they they estimate that there's about a million Believers in their country hello a million Believers how are you going to print message books for a million Believers if you print a 100 titles that's a 100 million books hello that's amazing an amazing project but we have a an Avenue by which we can put the message in their hands right on the smartphone and that's a Bible app that we call message Hub mobile it's downloadable for free on the Google App Store it's only for Android systems and that's this little app right here and very it's a very simple app that connects the Bible to the message message and as it loads here I feel like I'm doing an apple or something presentation where everything's locking up on me I've never ah there we go okay doesn't usually take that long but uh there it is now very simply all you do is is Select whatever language you want here's all the languages we have 17 different languages on the app right now many European languages such as Dutch German French uh Spanish um Slovenian Slovakian Croatian Polish Russian all uh and many other languages from around the world we'll select the uh German Bible since we're in Germany and pull that up here and you see on the side here numbers that are in Blue on the right hand side and those are links to the message from the scripture and you see in each number it's a it's a certain number 1 1 5 6 those are how many links to the message or how many times in the translated messages that brother brandham uses this scripture in the English it would be more because we have all the messages but in the German we only have about a 100 or so messages that are translated into German that are on the app now if I click on this number six here it pulls up the six spots where brother Brandon mentioned that scripture and then if I click any one of these quotes it goes right into the message and so it's just as simple as that and it makes brother brandham the commentary to the scripture and also in every language it brother Murphy you can come forward now also in every language uh it's searchable in that language so automatically these languages who have never been able to search the message in their language can now search the message in their own language and so we've had it in English for years some of you have had apps in your language but now the Indonesians have it in their language the Filipinos have it in their language some of these nations that have never had access to it like this before it's glorious what they have and they're excited about it and we're excited and it puts all the translations right into our hands and we and I mention that because I say the the brothers from Angola you pray for them and and uh because they want to load all the angolan translations so they can have an app and doesn't matter how many millions of people they can download all the translations instantly to their smartphone or their tablet and they have them there no printing required praise be to God brother Murphy's on his way here he is right here brother Murphy's going to speak about China and and he's going to show us uh a little bit about the Chinese Bible and how that came about and uh I don't I want to say while he's coming you know Bible Believers began by connecting needs with believers that had a burden for Missions and we are very very very strong on on being accountable we do reports we have some Faith challenge reports in the back and uh there's probably a few left and if you're interested in reading the reports of some of these things there's many other things that are happening but including Ethiopia and China but if you want to read some of the reports you get one of the faith challenge reports and if you want to be a regular uh uh partaker and be involved in what God's doing on the mission field give us your name and address just write it down on a piece of paper and give it to myself or brother Murphy or brother MIL stand up brother mil if you would there's brother milal give it to one of the three of us and we'll make sure that you get a faith challenge report Amen brother Murphy [Applause] oh just to try to be as pry as I can I had a lot of testimony but I won't share to any of them because otherwise going to be take too much time actually I had about30 slides for all the testimony of the Believers what happening in there but I only I taken about 10 slide here the only thing I shared is about the Bible uh to the back there uh the reason that we translated the Bible uh because that's about a 100 years ago and so they had a uh the missionary going to China and that husand Taylor or whatever and uh then they feel the need of the Bible so they translated and uh but uh while they translated they become a different version of it and the only one version last that's called a union version that's the 99% of the Christian in China and overseas that they were raiding but because the based on the uh the wrong uh I won't say wrong but it's different um manuscript so there's a lot of uh uh mistakes and the missing verses there and the first thing when we find out that uh is about uh 1998 uh when we translated brother bram's message we find out that the uh vers is missing the first one we find out is the first John chter 5 and verse 7 and uh he said uh there are three be record in heaven uh there are father uh the Holy Ghost and the word this three are one if you go back to your French Bible uh Louis Vuitton or Louie Su and uh they don't have that verse either and I think the many other verses was missing as well and when we find it out uh because the the task was so great uh we uh just uh we dare not even to touch it but we start to accumulate to all the uh the missing verses we make it a d uh diary off it and the mark it down just verse after verse and and it until they come to a time just become so many hundreds if not by thousands and then we uh pray the Lord uh uh give us the determination you know there's a two way to do this one way you just Overlook it just said okay I I know English I just go ahead that read my English Bible and uh uh you know just go along but another way is if I have the Bible if I know that English if I know the message I want to to give everyone that they uh doesn't have the privilege to know and that's why we determined to retranslate this Bible so by God's grace and uh after five years of uh hard works that a group of Believers will work together and we got that the Bible was translated and the published I'll just give you a few example if you can go to the first uh slide uh is that the scripture okay and then Matthew 5:44 it said but I say it unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you this verse is missing and I pray for them that which despise to use you that verse is missing and the next one 1811 for the son of a man is coming to save that which was lost the verses doesn't exist and Matthew 2016 so the last shall be first and the first last for many be called but few chosen that was missing 2735 and they crucified him and aart His Garment and cast lots that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet dep part of my garments and among them and that upon my vestan did they cast lot this verse is missing Mark 611 verily I say unto you it shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgement then for that City that verse is missing John 16:16 because I go to the father that was missing act 95 it is hard for the kick against the Pricks that verse doesn't exist ex 9:6 and they trembled and astonished and said Lord what would thou have me to do and the Lord said on that verse is missing too Roman 81 there is a there therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit that was missing First Timothy even so must their wives be G grave not Slanders sober faithful in all things their wives they translated as uh woman Deacon Revelation 1111 saying I'm Alpha and Omega the first and last it was missing what if that's your Bible what you going to do about it but by God's grace all those missing verses now come back to his original [Applause] Place hallelujah hallelujah I'm glad they're not missing anymore praise God praise God Hallelujah the prophet said that this this is the secret the word is in the bride yes the holy spirit is in the bride and he said she knows what he wants done with the word hallelujah this what you've just seen is exactly those words she knows and brother Murphy is one of those I won't even go into details his parents sent him to Canada with money to go into business he landed in Vancouver they told him in China there's somebody there in Vancouver that will baptize you I baptized him and his wife and they never left and I'm glad they never left Hallelujah that's what these kind of gatherings are all about listen friends it needs to be your D dedication let's get out of here we don't want to just go on with conventions forever and ever that's not going to continue as Jesus said things are going to change things are going to change he's not going to be the son of man forever he's going to be the the the the Son of God and it's not going to be that forever it's going to be and and the prophet said your Prophet said in the unveiling of God in between the son of man and the Son of God and the son of David in between he comes the son of man again to fulfill the rest of it that's happened we're in the final stages of it friends and I and I'm not just excited about things I'm excited about the Fulfillment of the word of God and you people that declare your Believers of the message that's the message amen that's the message the of Jesus Christ is to fulfill the message and the prophet said that she will fulfill he fulfilled the Old Testament and she fulfills the New Testament is that right is that right and she is a Living Word to fulfill a new testament

now now around your word in Jesus name amen amen I want to read just a couple of scriptures the other day uh as I spoke I have to confess to you that I read the scripture and the Holy Spirit just took it in a completely different direction and had me give uh uh two testimonies of things that had taken place uh when I was with brother Brenham and uh I had already con I had already promised myself in my heart I won't tell those because the atmosphere won't be right but the atmosphere became perfect and uh God was very gracious to us so I I want to just read the scripture if you would uh turn to it with me I have several notes here because I just didn't have the time to to get everything sorted out but I am going to with the Lord's help uh do what brother Coen Brunner has asked me to do and to be a live witness uh but I do want to go to these scriptures I'm going to read out of Exodus the 3rd chapter and verses just two down to five and the angel of the Lord appeared unto him this was to Moses in a flame of fire and in the midst and and out of of the midst of the Bush and he looked and behold the bush burned with fire and the Bush was not consumed and Moses said I will now turn aside and see this great sight why the bush is not burnt and when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see God called unto him out of the midst of the Bush and said Moses Moses and he said here am I and he said draw not nigh hither put off thy shoes from thy feet for the place where on thou standest is Holy Ground and then uh the scripture tells us that Moses at a later time asked God a question and he wanted to see his face said you cannot see my face but and he said this uh behold I send uh an angel before thee to keep thee in the way and bring thee into the place which I have prepared and the Lord said unto him this is Exodus 33:21 and behold there is a place by me and thou shalt stand upon a rock you may be seated my precious friends I will speak to you out of the depth of sincerity of my heart as he said to Moses there is a place by me and I want to speak about a place for a few moments tonight it's a very very striking word a a place can be a locality a place can be your country a place can be this building a place can be a condition someone may be very sick and I'm going to give you one or two examples when they came before the prophet of God and then and listen very close they came because they were very sick that was their condition that was the place they were in and they anticipated that they would be healed and pray and and prayed for but when the angel of the Lord began to speak to them and he spoke to Moses out of the burning bush and the prophet did declare that what Moses lacked the burning bush in the pillar of fire had and I want to say to you this evening some of you have come from different countries whether it be indria India or whether it be the Philippines or whether it be Angola or whether it be the Congo or whether it be from America or whether it be from Canada we may not even realize the depth of our need we may not even realize our real need we may have come here and said I anticipate to hear certain things the different Brothers I certain I have a certain expectation but God may have a little slightly different expectation for you and you may feel that your need is a certain thing and I'm going to give you exact examples while men I stood in front of the prophet of God and came there with a specific need they were people that were in a certain place and it was a desperate place and they wanted to be freed they wanted to be delivered but God had a different idea because they had a greater need and he knew what that need was and he declared that need through the prophet's mouth and dealt with that need first and I want to say can we not say Amen to that amen God knows exactly what we have need of and what what place we're in and he said to him when Moses said I wanted to see your face that I might see your face and God God answered him that no man could see his face but he said but there is a place by me and thou shalt stand upon a rock so God had to tell Moses that there was a place already prepared for him already prepared and I can say to you friends I don't know exactly why I know why I came here I came here at the invitation of brother Coen Bruner and and the rest of you have come it's impossible for me as a man to know why you have come and what your expectation is but I know one I know somebody I know one who can turn on the light I know a man that knows us and knows the inside and then knows the deepest deepest desire within you and that man can turn on the light that is none other than the son of man revealed and he is the one with the power and the insight to tell us exactly and point to our real need whatever that might be and also to provide that need [Applause] amen I had just mentioned to you and I'll just say this as a as a as a little starting Place Moses had stood in very special places he stood in h a a a place politically where he would be and the prophet said he was a great military man he knew what it was to hear the voices of the people roaring in adoration for his accomplishments but to God that was not the accomplish lishment and one day Moses also stood and looked out a window that was a place he looked out the same window that Pharaoh looked out but they had a different View and a different Vision Moses saw people that were the elected of God Moses saw people that were in slavery Moses saw people that were God's people and friends I'm standing here this evening and we see one another and I don't know how you view one another or how you view those who Minister but God views them M we want to make sure we have God's view of things we want to make sure we see one another as God sees them we can say We Are The Blood Washed uh we are the purchase of the blood of Jesus Christ and that is true but we need to be able to see and appreciate each other in that light and I can tell you as a servant of Christ that is the that is the level of divine love that needs to be within the Bride of Jesus Christ and we do not want to come to meetings such as this and go out from here the same way we shall be we shall experience a transformation where we actually literally feel different about one another and the prophet of God I'm going to go to beyond the curtain of time because I had a personal experience with the prophet and I'm going to be closing on that I'll be giving some some of the testimonies if if uh if the atmosphere is right and that's up to you hallu amen Moses was born in a home of slaves that was a place then a basket of bull rushers and that was a place was it not to the Palaces of Egypt and that was a place but that wasn't God's place for him to the backside of the desert and that was a place into a shepherd's tent and that was a place and leading the children of Israel and that was another place and up onto onto the mountain where God said you will not go into the land and he was he didn't and and even God told him don't speak to me anymore about this and he listened to the voice but he led the people to the land he led them to the land and Joshua his servant took them on in and gave them their inheritance because when God spoke to Abraham and said unto you and to your seed will I give this land that was a place and my brother my sister when God has a place in his mind he's got a place for the redeemed and Jesus said I go to prepare a place for you Hallelujah and I will come again and receive you unto myself and I'd like to declare to you my belief and and this is my last time speaking so I will just say it all I believe that the prophet's Ministry is part of that him receiving us to himself he's the word he's the word he's the revealed word and he raises up ministry for the expressed purpose he does translations for the expressed purpose of letting people know what this message is all about and that it is none other the mighty angel that that descended in Revelation 10:1 is none other and exactly what the prophet said that's Jesus Christ you believe that do we all believe that that's none other than Jesus Christ and I will take it further he's descend ending for one purpose to make himself known to his people and he's descending to receive a people to himself to take you to another place a body has the Lord prepared me Hallelujah this body of Jesus Christ it is not his intent that we just come and have meetings and have sing songs and that we have conventions it's much greater than that Hallelujah and the purpose of these conventions is to prepare ourselves for the place that he is prepared for us hallelujah it is prepared and he has sent his holy spirit we don't even have to beg him he the Holy Spirit has come and desires to dwell in us even more than you desire him hallelujah hallelujah because that is the spirit of God that's the spirit of Jes Jesus Christ to collect his bride and take her to his side and take her to the Palace the place he's prepared amen I believe you believe that with all your heart I certainly do amen and then there's another place it says and he came to Nazareth this is Luke 4 and two or three of the ministers that have preached have referred to this scripture and even read it but it says and he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up that's in his Earthly life in his Earthly visitation of our Lord Jesus Christ and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day day and stood up for to read and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah there has been delivered unto you the book of The Prophet Malachi there has been delivered unto you the revealed book called The Bible the message of the hour and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah and when he had opened the book and when he had opened the book and that is in y time and that is for you my dear friends when he opened the book he found the place when he opened the book we found the place Hallelujah and he opened the book and he found the place the place where it was written when he opened the book he opened it for me and found the place and the prophet opened his mouth and spoke of Malachi 4 5 and 6 and read it I didn't need a bunch of sermons I didn't need a bunch of explanation as soon as he read it the Holy Spirit was present and I just said Within Myself of course amen of course this is what's right this is this has to be the truth and he spoke a false anointed ones and I said of course that's what those scriptures how come I am so ignorant that I couldn't see that before I can tell you friends without the Holy Spirit we're nothing but deaf and dumb mutes the prophet of God your Prophet said concerning this microphone he said the microphone is mute he is mute I'm a mute I I don't have anything that I can say until that voice he's a vessel he's a vessel for the voice and listen to my my friends my dear friends I speak and cry out with all the strength I have that you are the vessel you are the vessel there is no vessel like the Bride of Jesus Christ in the earth who else has this kind of indication who else has this kind of voice that's why he said the world won't see me but you will see me I will leave but you will see me again Hallelujah and you'll rejoice when you see me and he found a place in the book and when the book was opened in this time listen to me Saints and Young people as well mothers and fathers and Elders of this group that is here you can never find that place by yourself we are like the unic of Ethiopia he was reading in the book of the prophet Isaiah he's LED as a as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep and as a sheep is is is led to the slaughter and is and and and is before her shears and he's rejected and the scripture speaks of the terrible rejection of Jesus Christ I don't want to take the time to read it you know it in Isaiah 53 and the and uh unic has the scripture has the has the scripture like you have the scripture and he perhaps had had it explained to him as well and he perhaps loved that portion and I do not know and I don't want to speak presumptuously but he needed he needed the voice of one who had received the spirit of God and know and and and knew how to take that same and the scripture says and Phillip joined himself to his Chariot and started at the same scripture I tell you my brother my sister when the prophet of God came and gave uh gave us attention gave a gave you specific attention to Malachi 4 it's not just a catchphrase it happens to be where the Holy Spirit starts at that scripture and reveals Jesus Christ and lets us know that there's a vessel that God brought on the earth at the specific time it was in this season and God prepared also that vessel H you young couples that have just been married you don't want to have to go through what God caused and allowed this Prophet to go through to be molded he also came into the hospital after his wife hope had just passed away and Dr s dare said Billy don't don't go in there now he's I'm I'm going in I have to go in and then life story when he's telling the life story friends I just read it yesterday again not I wasn't looking for it I wasn't studying it but I just came across it and it touches me so deeply because on in his ministry many years after it happened he said says now it's my duty tonight to go back over those times when he was so wounded and his heart was so bleeding and those bloody Footprints of his own life and recall for the People Like Us could sit here in relative relative peace and hear the agonizing what was it it was a body that God Was preparing that would be suitable to handle the word of God and to reveal in great secrets the messages of the hour and take us and point us to Malachi 45 and 6 and point us to Revelation 3 and let us know what the message was to the leodan church and to point us to uh point us to Revelation 10 and we know Revelation 10 and 7 that he wants to point us to Revelation 101 on and tell us that is Christ you'll find him in the first chapter of Malachi of of of of uh first chapter of Revelation and you find him again what's he doing he's pointing us he's starting at the same scripture it's not a new Bible it's not a new book but he's starting at the same scripture and revealing Jesus Christ to us I say to you did you see him do you see him once you see him you could never be the same again did you see him do you love him do we love him he's our bridegroom I ask you do you love him if you s Hallelujah if you see the one the prophet is speaking about you can't help but love [Applause] him and when you love him you be changed you'll be transformed Hallelujah because we're going to a place my brother we're going to a place we're going to a place pastors that's why you're preaching the bridegroom is drawing them to a place another place thank you brother Cen Brer for preparing this place and for your family that has helped we thank you for preparing this place but I am conscious that we're not here to stay here we're here because we're going to another place we're going to a place and I heard a prophet describe that place and our Lord has spoken it there's no tears there there's no pain the things you may be in the place tonight and I'm conscious of of this congregation and what you may be experiencing tonight you come from different countries you come from different situations you come from perhaps situations where where you thought this would never happen to me I thought I would never see this in the message but maybe you have experienced it maybe you have some regrets maybe you have some sorrow but I'm here tonight to tell you there's somebody here more than a man more than just a congregation there's someone here and I come to declare tonight hallu I have met that person you have met that person and he's come to change your residence he's come to change you from the situation that you're in to another place hallelujah hallelujah glory to God hallelujah oh what a place Hallelujah you may be in the pits of Despair tonight and you can't you cannot just be pumped up and made happy you have to have this one come maybe you're in a place of distress and he wants to move you from that place of distress and bring you into a peace my peace give I unto thee not as the world gives it Hallelujah and people of all stripes and all denominations quote those scriptures and speak about his peace and speak about his Joy but I can tell you friends there is a place where the fountain runs over with joy unspeakable and full of glory and peace such as the world knows nothing about that peace can you say amen hallelujah I say he's worthy of Our Praise [Music] Hallelujah [Applause] the unic was not an insincere man and Candace the queen he said he was the scripture said he was over all of her Treasures I've read about Candice and that name Candice is not just one individual not just one Queen but it was a title of great queens and Candace was a mighty warrior she was also a one that had many victories she was a very great Queen in Ethiopia tell you friends and this man was a great man he had a great position he also had a great place but he was not where the one he was speaking and reading of he was not where he wanted to place him Christ wanted to place him in another place so much so that the servant Phillip that spoke to him once it was revealed who that Christ was he departed off the scene a lot of people perhaps they wonder why did God allow William Brandon to be taken off the scene at a young man and a man that I highly highly highly respected very dear man and friend to me and one that saw that I should be in the ministry and he did everything he could to open doors but those same doors slammed shut as soon as they be became I soon as I became identified with the prophet in William bram's name because it was disdained or it was UN not liked and not thought highly and was not respected but I I saw first that this was a man of God I saw secondly that he was a prophet I didn't know anything about a messenger I didn't know anything about Revelation 10 I didn't know anything about Revelation 3 I didn't know anything about the church ages but I can tell you friends it was no it was not some uh flashing light from Heaven it was just an illumination and when you have a revelation you don't have to be taught a revelation if you're taught and convinced about a certain thing you can be convinced out of it as well but when you have a revelation and somebody comes to convince you otherwise I'm sorry but you just come too late I've already experienced it Hallelujah you that are seeking the baptism of the Holy Ghost I want to tell you he desires to give it to you more than you already ask for it let me say something else to you I had a sister come to me and she cried for many many months and and and even in De some years she would come and and get counsel from me and and she wanted I need the Holy Ghost I said what will you do when you have the Holy Ghost said I don't know I said if you don't know what you'll do when you have the Holy Ghost how can you tell me that you don't have it and she didn't know that either and I can tell you her problem was solved she's in the church today she has not come to me for many many years concerning the Holy Spirit I can tell you friends there are people maybe who desire it and simply because you have struggles or you have uh uh things that you feel are defeats in your life and and and and we don't want just a catchphrase well you need the Holy Ghost I can tell you if you're born again you can only be birthed by the spirit Jesus said except a man be born of the spirit and of water he cannot be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God I hope you understand what I'm saying I'm not saying it's a blanket everybody has the Holy Ghost it is an experience it is something that you know but I cannot point you to the exact place perhaps others can I cannot point you but I can tell you one thing your nature will be transformed when the Holy Spirit takes a hold of you you you will be transformed whether you know it or realize it or not but you might awaken to it after some time and say I couldn't do that of myself I could not do that someone else has come in and the Master of the House has come in and he's begin to rearrange things I hope you understand I want to tell you that are seeking the Holy Spirit God desires more to give you the Holy Spirit than you could possibly desire to have it and he desires to take you to a place where you have the fullness of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah and that you know that you have it and that you're born in the seed of God and I can tell you also friends I don't try to beg people into the kingdom God is not going to lose one of his I have my faith unshakable confidence in the scripture all that the father hath given me will come you ought to say that in your language they will come Hallelujah let this congregation say they will come and further more Jesus has said Do you believe him I will lose none of them no man can pluck them out of my hand Hallelujah I don't care how many Devils of Hell come against you no man can putu me out of his hand Hallelujah now he needs to be praised glory to him he's the mighty conqueror he conquered death he conquered every doubt he conquered every sickness he conquered every disease he's the mighty conqueror and and he went into the depths of Hell itself he went to our hell and he stripped Satan and Eve said who is it he said the seed of the woman and Daniel said who is it Hallelujah Ezekiel said who is it said the wheel within the wheel that's who it was that was him and perhaps today we could say who is it and he would say I'm Revelation 101 I'm the mighty angel that has the Covenant over my head Hallelujah for those of you that might have the Life Magazine if you look on the Life Magazine where they have the picture of the cloud how many have that picture out of the Life Magazine on the backside of the original in the Life magazine and we had a brother that collected them from many many parts of the United States and bought them paid up to $25 us for one copy and sent boxes of Life magazines to us so we could give it to people and especially I started giving it to ministers but on the backside of that picture is a picture of the moon eclipse moon eclipse and and over it is a rainbow the seven colored rainbows over the top of the moon eclipse and it says this is a very rare picture because it is made up of moon beams not sunbeams but Moon Beams I thought how rare and how wonderful I don't make any doctrine of it but I can tell you that the Covenant Angel what the prophet said he the word Angel it is the mighty the angel it is the Lord none other than the Lord Jesus Christ and in Revelation 5 when the book is still closed it talks about a strong Angel a strong Angel a strong messenger when the book was O when the book was closed and before that strong Angel is done here the book is open and the mighty angel in Revelation 10 one comes with the book open in his hand and I don't want to dwell on that but I want to say one thing emphatically and I trust all the translators will be able to get it exactly as I'm saying it that Mighty angel that has the book open in his hand this Earthly Angel and he said that's a Heavenly Angel but this Earthly Angel who introduced we didn't know who that was I didn't know who that was was but now I know you know how do we know because he started at the same scripture and declared Jesus Christ to us and it was perfect it was no struggle we didn't have to be taught we didn't need some great uh flash of lightning to see that it's it's it's him is it not the Bible says in Luke's gospel and all bear him witness and wandered at the gracious Words which proceeded out of his mouth and they said this was the scripture and the people wondered at the gracious words that proceeded out of his mouth and they said is not this Joseph's son see friends people read the same scripture they read the same scripture they read the same Revelation that you read and they have a wrong conclusion they said isn't this Joseph's son those that heard it and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth they came up with the wrong conclusion and friends that's why I'm very pleased to be here amongst a group of people thanks be to God who prepared a vessel for us it isn't because we're smart it isn't because we came we're specially gifted it's because God God loved his people and God gave us the right conclusion all things are of Christ all things are his he gave it to us freely amen hallelujah you pray for me I don't want to be too late do I have a little time I want to give you a few three or four testimonies as well the other night when I was also able to speak to you and I always felt I I'll just tell you was a group that was one of the most wonderful opportunities that I had been given and I felt I would not give that testimony of the Angel of the Lord coming into the car and having him speak to me on the log and answer the questions and the scriptures fell open it was too precious to me amen it so precious I don't like to speak it but they atmosphere thank you congregation I want to say thank you the atmosphere was perfect the atmosphere was right and you may not know it and I did not know it but one of the Coen Broner Sons met me after the service and said a man a young man walked in and maybe the daddy is here he's 23 had a long chain around his neck just like a man a young man of the world and he came in and I think he wanted to use the washroom the toilet and then after he came out stepan stepen said to him can I help you with something he said i' like to see my father my father is here from Angola I don't want to embarrass anyone but daddy you are here and the son walked in God knew I was wanting to speak this God knew I wanted to change my mind but this young man walked in and walked into this service just while I was giving my testimony he walked in I said I want to say to you when there's an atmosphere it's for somebody I don't know maybe it's a young man that walks in and he came to the next meeting and came to the next meeting and he may be here this evening said I want to see my daddy I want to see my father and they were able to connect in these meetings let me tell you friends I don't know where that young man came from I don't know the places that he's been in but he's probably in some dark dark place and our Lord Jesus Christ led him to another place and in this place thank you brother Co and but thank you ministering Brethren you don't know what you're providing and a young man hears for the first time the message of the hour I pray oh God the same God that got a hold of this young man gets a hold of that young man and brings him and as the as the young people from Ethiopia how blessed how blessed we are to have a heart how blessed you are to even see these pictures and say God bless sister yodit God bless brother bus God Infuse them with [Applause] power Hallelujah I say Hallelujah to the Lamb of God he is worthy he's worthy of all praise he's worthy of our voices he's worthy of our breath blessed be the name of Jesus Christ blessed be the name of Jesus Christ Worthy is the Lamb Hallelujah use your voice to say glory be to God glory be to [Applause] God why are we praising him because he's so Victorious he has done what we could not do that father did not arrange perhaps had no idea that his son was coming from someplace I know not where but someplace in Germany coming from that place to this place so that Jesus Christ could take a hold of him and take him to another [Applause] place just so that you'll remember we have there can be a written book and every book must have an author then there is a sealed book then there is a the claimed book that's still not sufficient then there is the open book and it even requires more than that it requires that the author reveal the book and then you manifest the book my life is worthless unless I can manifest what's been made real Hallelujah glory to God and when my Lord Jesus said you will preach this gospel not just here in Jerusalem but in Jerusalem and in Samaria and in Judea until the uttermost part uttermost part of the earth take it back to Malawi or Zimbabwe or Angola or Congo or into brazaville or wherever it may be we take it back to the United Kingdom take it back to America but I can tell you America doesn't need a new president as much as it needs Jesus Christ and they have they have passed their day of redemption according to the prophet as a nation I don't know what whether you agree with me or [Music] not this Prophet said if they had recognized the gift the gift of God as the as the Lord Jesus said to the woman at the well and how you heard brother George Smith speak I believe he said that brother brandham referred to that scripture perhaps hundreds of times I remember one time where he said something on this order that the angel had directed him to that scripture and that's why almost almost every prayer line he's referring to Jesus felt directed to go to Samaria and there he stopped at a well to rest that was another place and a woman was coming to that place she was coming wherever her home was listen to me friends maybe your car is parked outside or you have airplane tickets in your in your briefcase at the room God's not interested in that it's not that he's not interested but he's interested in something more I will collect them together in this place in this place that God has laid upon the heart of his servant brother colen Brunner and he has invited other men to come and to preach preach and you Brethren that have picked up the word of God you're Duty bound to speak what the prophet of God has spoken we are Duty bound to stay with the message Hallelujah all of the message it's not a smorgus [Applause] board it's not walking down the line and taking what you like taking another piece that you like that's not this message that's not this lamb you eat all of it you eat the bitter herbs you beat all of it Hallelujah this Passover Lamb we eat it all say well this isn't exactly what I this doesn't tickle me he he's not just having you take the good parts we're not just taking the steaks and the roasts but we take the better herbs and there are things about this life of Christ that are not that Pleasant Hallelujah I have your attention the prophet of God went into little Sharon Rose and he said that little baby A little girl his wife has just passed away and he begs God don't take her don't take her and he said it was like his prayers were bouncing on off of the ceiling he said that she bent and she was bowed over like a banana because she was in such pain and she was in such pain I ask you what's going through the heart of the father what's going through brother bram's heart that was a molding process brother Ron Spencer I heard you speak on at Edmonton and I never forgot those words the molding process to make it the kind of vessel he wants a prepared vessel I'll form this vessel I'll make it the kind of vessel we may have all kinds of other desires but he has a desire I'm going to mold this vessel into a member of the B bride bride body my lover the Lover of My Soul he's lover my soul that's the kind of person he is and what do you think went through the prophet's mind you that are mothers I'll tell you he speaks of it he said she was in such pain her eyes crossed and that touches me very deep because the first thing I saw when I was sitting 1 2 3 I was sitting like where you were sitting and the place had had several thousand people and the girl a mother brought the girl up and her eyes I there was no eyes there it was just all white but I was sitting close enough and I could see there was just a little bit of the black of the ball of the eye and the prophet said when he had seen Sharon Rose his little darling daughter in such pain he said God by God's grace I have never been able to see a crosseyed child without seeing it healed but the mothers and fathers of those children did not know what that Prophet went through what the vessel went through to have that kind of faith and that kind of Courage against the enemy that would hold those eyes crossed like that and he said he had about 400 cases in some months of crossed eyes and he said God healed every one of them but not those parents those parents didn't know about it and maybe you didn't know about it and you hear men of God come up and Minister friends I'm deeply moved because this these are my last words maybe the last words I'll ever be able to speak in German me I want to tell you out of the desperation of my own soul I want to testify there is a book of Acts being written behind this bride whether you realize it or not I'm declaring it to you this bride there's a book of Acts this is a supernatural bride your call is Supernatural him calling you was Supernatural you young men you young ladies listen to this voice God's call in your life is Grace Grace Grace I'm amazed that he loved me often we don't know who's sitting around us I know something of our brother Ron Spencer and brother Tim puit because we've known each other for many years it's not because we are have some special affection but uh brother Ron's father you would never know this if I didn't say it I have never preached in his church I've never preached in brother Ron Spencer's Daddy's church but I have such a deep love for him and we have such a deep mutual respect and that man I'll tell you what kind of man he is brother Ron Spencer if you stand brother Ron so they can see you see this man he's going to preach tomorrow night uh just stay standing a moment that man fell four stories out of a building from the fourth story fell onto the concrete and was rushed to the hospital and his daddy walked into that hospital and the medical people today they don't want to butter things up so they want to be very honest with a person and they told brother Ron Spencer's daddy your son will never walk again you must know he will never walk again and that's what you have and Bron Spencer's daddy said to the man the doctor I respect you but you just don't know who you're talking to Hallelujah a quiet man but a man who knew his position he knew his place he wasn't some doubter he knew his place and that's a place also a man of faith and he said to the doctor he said you just don't know who you're talking to and he said where's my son and they led him to this man in the in broken all up and the doctors have just declared he'll never walk again and you can you can correct me if I'm wrong brother Ron but your daddy said son I'm a Son of God and you are my son and we are going to walk out of this hospital and brother Ron Spencer walked out of that hospital Hallelujah I tell you friends this is a man who knows who the Creator is he's not wondering how many bones are [Applause] broken and they walked out of that hospital and brother Ron Spencer went to work Monday morning hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah friends that's not 2,000 years ago that's not the Rapture that's now that's today that's here that's here in this place and God will hold you accountable but you saw it and you heard it and the man my Witnesses here and another man who just took the courage to say that and brother Ron can tell you anything else he wishes hallelujah it's so real friends this is the one I met on the log this is him who spoke this is him who St the waters Hallelujah this is the same one and this is the one that you desire to hear from this is the only one that can answer your questions this this is the only one that can give you the life that you need this is the only one and I plead with you tonight make him welcome for your Prophet said he comes every time he's invited you believe it don't you God bless you hallelujah hallelujah glory to God I just feel like giving him praise it's not a god of yesterday he's not a god of tomorrow he's a present God right now and he's prepared to take you from the place of unbelief he's prepared to take you from the place of your bondage he will take you to a place of Liberty he will take you to another location Hallelujah GE I hope the translators are getting it I hope I'm not going too [Applause] fast but when the master he's the beginning of the new creation and by him were all things made that were made he's the Creator and when he come as a young man and began to enter his ministry he saw men that were born of thees flesh the same kind of birth that you and I have had and Jesus in his creative mind knew they're in the wrong garden they're in the wrong place and they need to be transpl trans planted he said come that's all come follow me and I will make you Fishers of Men And even the demons a thousand demons that was cast out of the man in the gines and they they said have you come to torment us before our time he said he said what is your name said Legion had a thousand or more demons in him I tell you this Jesus Christ this Revelation 101 that I'm speaking of he is he's without limit of his power and they said let us go to the swine and Jesus said one short word two letters in the English language go Hallelujah young people all he needs to say to you is come come I say come and you respond yes Lord I will come if you mean it I'm not going to beg you you have to hear his voice you have to hear him say it you have to respond to him not to the preacher not to me not to other friends that are here you need to respond to him I I come king of my life I Crown thee now thine shall the glory be lest I forget thy thorn crown brow lead me to Calvary as our brother preached last night hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah he is worthy he's the mighty conqueror yes he is and he's here tonight I know before I came to the service he's here tonight to move somebody to move you we major on sickness but if you're sick he can move you from sickness to health Hallelujah we did get the we did get the request I believe the young brother right there are you the one with the chronic leukemia why don't you stand up it wasn't that I thought of you but he thought of you today

part of it Hallelujah I've never been to Ethiopia I probably will never go to Ethiopia but I'm rejoicing what happened I'm rejoicing when Phillip met uh the unic I'm rejoicing over that and I'm rejoicing what's happening there today God bless you amen you may have your seats would it be all right if I take a few moments to tell you I I took brother brandom on his hunt on a his rest in May 1961 the last two weeks of May I had been in quite a number of brother brenham's meetings but in the meeting in Dawson Creek which is where my wife was born a woman is standing over here she's a German woman woman very well known as very dear friends of my father and stepmother her name was Sister clun KL u n t clun she and her husband come to our church or they come to the church in Fort St John where they lived I wish I had my map here but Fort St John is 42 K 42 miles but maybe 60 kilometers north of Dawson Creek on the Alaskan Highway and brother Branham is here you'll have to listen very close to to lay hold of the subtle uh movements of the Holy Spirit I tell you he's so that's why people remain blind to his moving because they're they're not keen enough I want want you to be Keen now and brother bam is standing here and I'm sitting over there on the platform and I know this woman very well and I have big questions in my heart I'm sitting on the platform with big questions in my heart concerning brother brandham because I heard that he taught that Cain was the son of the serpent we have never heard such things it wasn't that I was doubting I wasn't disbelieving I believed him to be a great man of God in fact is it was a meeting like this I was so anxious to see what happened and if he performed the same way and in my Simplicity that's all I was wondering but I wasn't even there with questions I just was sitting there observing what was happening and now here's sister clun I know her well very good friends of my parents and the prophet is about 2 MERS away and he he says you can hear it on tape it's on the Dawson Creek series he said now you're not from this place said you you are praying for a man and that man has is shadowed with death he's dying with cancer and I believe that man is not from the city he's from a town just north of here called it's like he's reading it he's called Fort St John and he didn't he didn't say that you know he's healed or anything he just said go your way and you know whatever God bless you and sister Clint moved away the next day we're leaving very early in the morning brother brandham does not know where I'm taking him he he knows that we're going on the Alaskan Highway but he doesn't know exactly am I all right thank you he doesn't know exactly where we're leaving we're leaving in this small city so we drive out of this city and he's actually driving the car and we start up the Alaskan Highway he's in his denim clothes relaxing clothes he has that little uh White cowboy hat on and uh and we're just talking and we're relaxing now the meetings are over and it was a big load off of his shoulders of course and I I was happy that we were able just to go this was the object of him coming that we I we'd be able to take him to my good friend brother brother his name is Bud Southwick and uh I told you the other day he had just sold his Ranch and the government gave him this territory brother brandham was his first Hunter on this territory and so we're driving and we're coming we're coming to the city of Fort St John small City maybe 5 6,000 people and when the United States Army called the US D which is the United States Engineers division when they were building that Highway it was a war project because the Japanese were invading and coming up the uan islands and had already captured two one of them I believe is ATU at and they needed to get heavy equipment into Alaska or they may lose the entire state so the Canadian and United States government agreed together the United States would build the highway and the Canadian government would undertake to maintain it forever and they still do we're driving up the highway and when they came when the US Army came to the area where Fort St John Fort St John was down towards the Peace River maybe 3 four miles and they just they they couldn't wait for anything friend you've never seen a highway built like this one if a truck went over the bank they just left it for the most part they just time was of the essence and they built 1,000 523 miles who who's got calculus and can tell us how many kilometers that is 1,500 miles it's about 2,200 kmet I think are you listening they built it in s months 7 months and pushed trucks through in s months and I was living on that Highway my father was a carpenter they called him the holy Carpenter because he was a Christian so we knew what that was very early my daughter and wife perhaps hear that for the first time but they called him a holy Carpenter a as as something against him because that's what they figured Jesus was was a holy Carpenter and that's what we lived under but my father would witness wherever he could witness and now when the US Army put this road through here it went right through a right in a farm and The Farmhouse just laid about 100 200 m to the right a big white house and I knew that house i' passed it all my childhood every time we drove on the highway I I even wondered about that house brother Southwick also had been born just north of Fort St John and he lived off in a Wilderness you talk about Wilderness hello you people in Germany you don't have Wilderness like this this is Wilderness that's void of humans you could go from a point of Fort St John you could go north for maybe over 2,000 kilometers and never say a human you could go straight South for another 7 800 kilometers I guarantee you never see a human this is where we're taking brother Brenham and what is called the Rocky Mountain Trench and it's a vast I stood brother brandham on a on a curb side of the road and the road just fell away I lived as a boy about 10 years old at the bottom of that mountain and I knew they call it Steamboat Mountain because of its shape and I stood there I wanted to stop and we had the car stop and brother brandham got out and we walked to the edge of the Mountain edge of the road just a gravel road and it just fell away like this way down to the bottom and then the bush it was a the spruce which is dark almost black and just going on and on wide valleys miles and miles wide like that and at the end of this one Valley you can see mountains little row of purple mountains about that high and I said I don't know for sure brother Benham I understand that this Valley is 75 miles that' be about 100 kilometers across just one Valley now I want you say why are you saying that I'm saying that so that you'll understand when the prophet speaks about rugged Christians it's because he was a rugged prophet amen he brought a rugged message and I read it today he said after the curtain of time and when he went beyond the curtain of time you know what the going beyond the curtain of time did for him made him I'll never compromise I'll never compromise with this message aren't you glad that you had a man who was a rugged Prophet that would not compromise on the word of God and even though the denominations offered him big amounts of money and he said that uh they offered him huge amounts of money he said you'll never worry about money again you'll just need to adjust your Doctrine a little bit on some minor things so he wanted to know what what was the minor things what was minor in their mind you know what was minor the godhead and the baptism is that minor to us those are major doctrines I say thank God we had a rugged Man Elijah was a rugged Man they would not compromise on the word of God is this all right and so as we were going past this big white house just listen close and I'm I'm expecting maybe at any moment I won't point to any person but he I was expecting he was going to say you rascal you're not really believing everything I couldn't believe everything it wasn't revealed to me yet I didn't know but I was honest I was absolutely honest he never ever said that and as we drive past that big white house he said put his head back said there was a there was a woman was up in the prayer line yesterday praying for a man from Fort St John oh brother Bram I said that's a very good friend of our of our family I said her name is Sister clun he's not paying any attention he's Sayang and and and he slowed down because the speed limit was only 30 kilomet and he and now we're going past the house slowly and he says the man's in that house have you ever heard the Devil speak he always has a doubt right away I said well how do I know he's in that house that's a thought that shot through my mind how do I know he's in that house we get 375 about 500 kmet up the highway and we're at brother Southwick and this was his town or his village and he lived about 50 kilometers away that's where his Ranch was and I'm I'm anxious to tell brother Southwick about this uh about talking and calling out and saying that the man's in that house and brother Southwick says that's right he said I know him his name is Ed Thomas and I know that he also is dying with cancer I said well brother brandham called out sister Clint because he knows sister Clint I said he called her out and so now I had I was on the platform knew the woman heard what he said said I didn't know anything about Mr Thomas dying with cancer now we get up the Alaskan Highway and I'm 375 about 500 kilm and I'm trying to explain to brother Bud cuz Bud was a raw he was just a raw Wilderness man he doesn't know anything about Genesis or Revelation or Matthew Mark or Luke he doesn't know anything about the Bible but he understands the Wilderness I'm going to answer some questions for you just now and he says well that's correct he said I I I've known Ed Thomas since I was a boy about 8 years old and he he lives in that house and I also know he's dying with cancer so now I had two witnesses and I was just wondering you know I I I'm I'm God is so tenderly saying see it's true see it's true true I never got a rebuke I never got anybody chastising me he never tried to convince me in the scripture this is how it works he was just living the life and it convinced me and I just saw I I saw you know what I saw friends precious friends I saw the pages of the Bible just come alive one page after another page this is what they did in the Bible this is what Jesus did this is like this is like Jesus is here again this is what he did he went to places and and he he he explained it to the people and this is what Jesus did the Bible do you know why you're sitting here that's what his wife does now he's not here physically but you are here physically he said and I will be in you Hallelujah I am the father one and I will be in you why is he in us to do the same things and we don't have to struggle we don't have to strive we don't have to try it just comes natural when we have the Holy Ghost in us we just live that life that's all there is to it we can't help it I've had people say well I I I I feel like giving up I said well if you can just go ahead throw in the towel give give up and then they say well I can't that's good that's good you you can't give up I can't give up either you can't give up so that was one and I put that in my heart then we got up now I'm coming to a very tender spot so I want you to listen close you're very nice is it better if I stand on the platform is this a okay we get up on in This Magnificent country which I Can't Describe for you but there mostly grass and flowers and nothing no trace of human no sound of a Jet Plane no sound of cars or automobiles and we can't even have our horses up there we just walk and we sat on the hillside and brother brandom began to describe beyond the curtain of time he looked up this Great Valley look down the scenery friends is beyond description and not only the scenery but the ruggedness and not only the ruggedness the serenity la of humans humans are the pollutant they're trying to and they God don't let me get on this but they want to environmentally clean up the world they can't clean up the world as long as man is here you understand and there's no human it's so pure and he said brother Eddie now so that you can follow this on February 1961 the Full Gospel businessmen put out their pamphlet called Full Full Gospel voice and they have Brother brenham's picture on the front cover and he's holding his Bible you've seen it brother caps he's holding his Bible I'll just say to you as a as a friend friend to friend uh the eyes of brother Branham in that picture is the closest to him when he's under that anointing and under Visions they caught it I I've seen the picture was taken right after and that and he's smiling and that's not but these eyes now are completely the reason why friends I talk about it is but I was maybe a foot away looking in those eyes it wasn't the eyes so much it was just the whole appearance of him but God was looking through those eyes I was as a I was as naked I couldn't now I understood when brother brandham says to people women sometimes you sometimes men and he says you couldn't hide a thing in your life now if you tried you could not hide a thing and I have said so many times I know exactly what that was I knew I was totally stripped naked and then I understood the Judgment God's not going to have to stand there and condemn people you will condemn yourself because you will know you'll know if if you're a Critic in this meeting you'll face that again you'll come before an allseeing eye you come before a mind that knows the beginning and the end and that listen to me friends that was displayed in that prophet's life I've seen I've seen power that was just a silent and power over the elements power that uh would leave an average B just weak but on this occasion now brother bman saying and I I'm getting such a unveiling I'm seeing now what the judgment is like and I'm understanding these things and uh he said now brother Edie we're sitting on this Hillside and this was in the last two weeks of May of 1961 and that picture was in February now here we are in May and he looks up this Valley and down said brother Eddie on the other side it's just very much like this he says and when you cross over you'll find some little paths or little Trails he said you walk down one of those one day and you'll find me tell you what friends that has meant so much to me that could not be a lie he was telling me the truth you cross you go down one of those Pathways and you'll find me and so I I look I just tonight I've never done it in my life just tonight I went in beyond the curtain of time and I wanted to see how many times he used that phrase once in 1955 when he speaks on MDC Mighty Prince and King he used beond the curtain of time once the second time was when he has brother Neville read what the four gospel businessmen uh printed in their book of brother Bram relating going beyond the curtain of time the third time was when I didn't know that till this evening the third time was I was sitting behind him and he told it he didn't tell about it but he he just mentioned beyond the curtain of time in Dawson Creek and that was in May and a few days later we went we went hunting and then he he describes beyond that and he said brother Eddie I was um I was laying in bed and sister mey was still sleeping and I woke up quite early he said I had my hands behind my head like this he said I said to myself well Bill Branham you're getting to be an old man now he said he was 52 he said if you're going to do anything for God you better get going I thought oh my you know how how that affected me I felt like nobody I thought there was no hope for me if you're going to do anything for God he's been here to Africa he's been to some many of these places and I thought if he was going to do anything for God and he uh then a few moments later he said uh I was standing I was I was laying in bed and uh one came to me and the voice said would you like to see what's beyond the curtain at time and he said oh that would help me so much he said brother Eddie it was just uh instant there's no sensation I didn't have any feeling and I was standing about 20 ft from my body and I was looking at myself and he said and I was standing there and then here came ladies young ladies and he describes them you've read it long hair and long dress and he says then they embraced him and said our brother our precious brother and then came the man and he describes it exactly as he wrote it now I want to tell you then I hope I don't get misunderstood a few weeks later I received that that little pamphlet that magazine Full Gospel man's voice in the mail from brother brandham and he just said on it to brother Eddie and uh then he opened it up I opened it up and he had an arrow from Beyond the curtain of time the the the the capital the the title of the and it had an arrow down to a box I don't know if there's any Christian businessmen here but listen this is what they said not what he said that's what they said in Bible days there were prophets and seers of God but in all the sacred records there was none as great or none greater than that of William brandham a prophet and a saer of God who in the name of Jesus has raised the Dead I gave that to a Muslim man I gave that to a Muslim man just a some weeks ago and he asked me he said Mr Bisal can you give me some words of wisdom about your size about your age and he he's such a fine young man he was in my home and he said can you give me some words of wisdom he said kind of what made you what you are and I took I took that little pamphlet I have it behind glass and I took it out and I handed it to him I said I met this man and from that day my life was transformed and I said I said read this at the bottom please and he read that and he said my raise the dead and and I haven't spoken to him uh send on the subject but I'm just expecting that God will move him from that place am if you're here tonight and you have trust in some other uh your confidence is in someplace else I'm here to tell you that there's not only is there one here but he's wanting to move you if you're struggling he B to move you you to victory and this is this is a true Rec a true record of beyond the curtain at time and I want you to read it he pleads with the people don't don't miss this and only perfect love can enter there amen I'm very conscious of our time and I'm going to close in just a couple of minutes but I want to tell you my wife and I just a few maybe a few months ago we traveled to one of the Native Indian Villages that I was going to and also had many of those people come to brother bram's meeting you will hear the tape it's in Port El Bernie and there's a young man his name is Steven Tate t a t and he had epilepsy very very bad he was sitting in the meeting in Port El Bernie and uh they didn't expect that he would live maybe Beyond 20 he was 19 I thought he was 16 but he was 19 at the time and so we were sitting with the former pastor's wife my wife and I in her home and we were saying what about this one she said well they've passed on what about this one or they've passed on what about sister Tate and Steven Tate is Steven Tate still living oh yes yes Stephen Tate is in the senior citizen's home and you'll go right past it in in in Port El Bernie so we stopped there the next morning and we walked into the senior citizen home older people everywhere and uh I said I'd like to see Steven Tate and he was sitting right there in a wheelchair he said I wasn't supposed to be in this wheelchair but he said I I uh I I just stumbled and I fell and so they put me in this wheelchair I said do you remember being in brother brenham's meetings in uh in 1962 oh yeah he said I remember I remember being there I said you had epilepsy yeah said I had epilepsy I said have you uh have you had any spells have you fall under the spell of epilepsy he said I never had one since he spoke to me I say to you my friends who does that who did that Jesus simply the Bible says he sent his word and healed them I don't know what happened happened all I know I'm sitting on the platform and and and he calls out Steven Tate but he tells he tells also very honestly that EP that epep epilepsy spirit is a very stubborn Spirit very difficult to handle but he said just sends that word and then and with this I'm closing he stands and I'm sitting there my wife was actually playing the piano and he turns like this and looks up into the Gable of the little Hall of the building we were in he says now when he was here with Abraham he turned his back on the tent he says I'll turn my back now he said and I know every detail I know every detail I don't have to read this and get refreshed I know every detail I know these people personally and uh he said there's a man that's paralyzed and I said right away I oh that's brother Jacob brother Jacob's the brother who led me into open some doors in the ministry was sitting right beside me he had visited him that day and and brother Jacob was in that City and I when he said his name is Mr Jacob no he didn't say his name is Mr Jacob he said he's paralyzed and I said I knew that he was up in an Indian village many many miles by fishboat and I had been to that reservation where the Native Indians were and he was living in a little lean none of you people have had to live the way that poor man was living and in that State paralyzed so as soon as he said there's a man he's paralyzed I said oh that's brother Jacob and he's up at a hous it the man who's sitting right beside me we're all in the same place we're all born again we're all spiritual people and this other man and I are both preachers I'm a missionary to the Native Indians but we both come up with the wrong conclusion I said I thought he's up at that place in a haard and the man next to me said he's right here in this city because I visited him this morning and brother brandham has his back turned and he says the man is not in this city and he said the man is in a town just east of here called nanimo and you can look at it on the map that's exactly straight east of Port El Bernie on Vancouver Island and then he does this and he Wheels around said isn't that right Mike and point right to the man who is pulling for him to be healed I don't know any more than that and that except that man Mr Jacobs was moved that after afternoon from that City to a Indian Hospital in Nimo British Columbia now friends this isn't some hoax this isn't some dreamed up thing this is exactly what happened and I'm Duty bound to tell you as a living witness that's what happened and that's the kind of sign that came and that's the kind of God that just demonstrates himself not for brother Jacob's but that I can live this long and stand here at brother Cen burner's invitation and tell you people that God is still exactly the same that God who saw where he was moved that God saw you come to this meeting that God saw you drive or come by airplane or however that God knows exactly the condition that you're in at this very moment that God I'm taking a lot of time but I'm ending right now I am so thankful and I can tell you if I did not have the opportunity to be a living witness of what God has done in this day I say we are a very very privileged people very privileged people we're not just at church we're not called just to be a church members we're called to be a part A Living member of the Bride of Jesus Christ that's what he's called you to I say glory to God that's the highest calling a high and mighty calling do you believe that do you feel that way this is such a privilege such a privilege I shouldn't have to tell you it's a privilege I would not be here I'm not a young man my wife is not a young woman anymore we would not be here if if we didn't have something that was true and something that was it's worth every ounce of our energy you believe that don't you I know you do God bless you my brother you believe that don't you you folks believe that you young people believe that he's the same same God I testify these things are not things just in in the past we showed you Ethiopia on the screen he's the same God today doing exactly the same thing and he's here this evening to try perhaps do something for you shall We [Applause] Stand I'm going to pray almighty God Giver of Life Giver of every good gift father you work in strange and mysterious yet wonderful ways every person here we're so diverse and so different men women young people children elderly people we all have various expectations there may be those here that are are terribly sick I do not know but Thou knowest You're the same God who I have seen in operation and I have seen oh God you do G great and glorious things and even to this time and I pray father that you will speak people need to hear your voice they need to hear you talking and I pray that you will Lord do so in these final closing moments I thank you for the patience the people have had I'm very conscious that this has been a long service but I believe you'll give rest to our bodies and renew us I ask your grace and blessings upon them in the name of Jesus Christ I wonder do you know brother Daniel speak my Lord speak my Lord I'll be quick to answer you and we don't want to sing it too too slow if we

I'll be quick to answer thee speak my [Music] Lord speak my Lord speak and I will answer Lord send with those thoughts on your mind would you just have your seats for a moment please stay here with me I very much questioned whether I should do this so I'm doing this at the expense of I trust not being embarrassed do not ask these people about what I'm going to say about 12,000 miles from here I was sitting in my home it was a Saturday morning and I was going to in I was in my study and I was just going to study and a voice a deep voice uh a voice that also was a Discerning voice I knew more than what I'm just going to say but it says I had opened up my computer and I have several emails that come during the night and the first one was a short one and I read about two lines and this voice came suddenly he said this is a wound wounded one and her husband doesn't know she has written this I would like that woman to stand that's the woman and just remain standing [Applause] please and I thought maybe the email is from United States or someplace in Canada I didn't know where it's from and I could not tell from the address there was no address on it it was just a email address but didn't tell me where it's from and maybe two three weeks later would come another little short one said I streamed the service and it was a great blessing to me it from this woman now I was sitting in my office that place I have never talked to her about her her writing that I've never talked to her but that is what happened and a few weeks later I got a long email and when I saw it I thought oh this is there's a lot of detail here a lot of text and I just started to read the top two lines and the same voice and the same at atmosphere said these exact words now her husband knows and I'd like her husband to [Applause] stand and brother FASA sister Susan I want to express myself I may never have a chance to do this again I love you brother franois I I learned that these people were in Switzerland brother fris has been Pastor there for maybe 40 plus years and it was a puzzlement it was a puzzlement to everyone and then there was brother Daniel Ken Brer and Brother David mayor brother Jean Jock's son-in-law and we were in a uh my wife and I excuse me just a moment my wife and I were invited to come to Switzerland and we were way far I was on my way to Ukraine anybody here from the Ukraine from danet denk no one from dank and ala aloua there was a meeting in aloa across the Black Sea and so we were coming to Istanbul and there was 5 days from that moment to the time the meeting was to start and I said well we must um this is the only chance we'll go to Switzerland and we flew back to Switzerland and these two people brother Jord and sister Angela picked us up at the airport we were like lost oldtime friends I never saw them they grab our suitcase and run off to their car and brother George driving the car out of Geneva about an hour and a half and into the to their house and they pull in you know God does strange things folks does very strange things and now we're from one place to another place and all I have is this this voice I'm coming to you in a few moments and brother Gerard takes our suitcases up to the bedroom and says just you know have a wash and refresh yourself and come down we'll have coffee and he closed the door and my wife is look standing there our suitcase is standing there and I'm standing here now I'm being honest with you I looked at my wife I said what are we doing here 5 days what are we doing here I never stay any place in a private home for 5 days and we come to know these people didn't we met Jean jaac michelo Brother In the Flesh to brother Jord and his wife sister Marinette and then of course we knew the uh brother Fran and sister Susan and it was awkward and then they thought well maybe there's other people I only had that one thing this is a wounded one you might be here tonight and I don't know anything about sister Angela brother Gerard all I know is that someone spoke in my study 10 12,000 miles away I was in another place now my friends whoever that was that SP spoke to me I can tell you it's a voice a living voice I did not want you to hear my testimony and think oh this is like 50 60 years ago I'm talking about something that is is current something that's right now and I'm telling you that God is that God never sleeps that God never gets weary that God knows exactly what's in the deepest part of your heart that God knows your thoughts that God knows everything about your being he knows your background he knows where you came from and he knows where you're sitting at this moment he knows you're sitting here listening to me and all I can tell you is what I say to you is absolutely the truth this didn't come out of a book this didn't come out of a seminary this didn't come from any other special theme this is AB absolutely the truth and then it goes from one to another to another and they decided to have a a gathering there was 27 I told them don't tell anybody that I'm here and they said just our family just some of our family and friends and they had a dinner at their place and it was 27 persons and then they said well maybe I can see there was a strain and there was a pull and such a desire to maybe get together just get together have a service and about a year later friends I want to tell you I'm a mute without this God I have nothing to offer nothing to offer these people this is not a special gift or a special person this is the person Jesus Christ we say that he's alive you should not be surprised I'm telling you things that declare he is alive do you believe that I'm trying to reach you just for a closing moment and then they and I I finally under a lot of strain and duress and brother colen brother I know what that strain is and that is why brother frosta see this isn't even preaching this is that's why I stood there and said brother F well you're a pastor here brother Jean Jack you have a group you've been pastoring this group and you're I I don't have any right to even be here I have no right to be here I don't have any position to be here I want to be honest and ab and about 120 came I was still at home 10 12,000 miles away and God directs me to a place simply because of Geneva and I thought that your Prophet spoke on conference with God and I just became obsessed with W with an overwhelming you tell these people I have called this conference they are in a crisis and I have called them to this place because they're in a crisis friends I didn't know I don't know maybe you're sitting here and you look perfectly normal but maybe you're in a crisis and I know a god it isn't that you call for conference your Prophet said God calls a conference when there's a crisis and I say to the people of this audience and the people of this convention maybe 90% of the congregation just fine I don't know we can be ever so happy I don't know I know what conferences are I know when a person is desperate I know when a person needs an answer I was a happy young man I could you know I I could make humor and nobody would ever know what was going on inside ladies he knows he knows exactly what goes on inside you Brothers he knows exactly when you say I'm so empty is this all there is to it is this all there is we can believe this and we can you know and be stirred up and have our emotions all stirred but is this all there is to it and it seemed that there was other people so we had that Gathering brother colen Brunner you have a very deep respect for me you and your wife came and had had such an effect on me and then uh young men said the people are asking are we going to do this again next year and so that next year and next year there was maybe 240 and the next year I'm not talking about numbers now I'm not interested in numbers I don't care if it went down to 10 but when there was 240 there more wounded people more hungry people they weren't necessarily all wounded but there are many that are wounded friends I'm just going to stop for a moment there were times in my life when I just didn't feel right I didn't feel physically right but I didn't know what was wrong with me but I would go to a physical doctor and say can I just describe something to you my doctor said uh Mr bisco what can I do for you I said I don't know I said that's positive I said I don't know what's wrong can I describe something to you and I described what I was going through he knew exactly what I was it took somebody and now I can tell you about it you might be able to play play the part and not you're not acting you're genuine you're Believers I was a Believer I believed with all my heart and soul I believed in the spontaneous things and friends take this right please I have seen the demonstration of the holy spirit in the in the congregation such as I have never seen in the message yet but I never have had the voice speak and say precisely a certain thing and then listen to that voice and find out it goes from that to another year to another year and I feel as though I'm just writing and there's lots of room for misunderstanding and God knew that and God help me please to just finish this by saying this out of that brother home Runner that's why we've come you were so warm and friendly and kind and spiritual and when I got your email and said I desire this meeting and walls will go down and the Holy Spirit will just come and the love of God will prevail that was this man's desire and that's why I've come God bless you brother Tim Phil brother Tim I'm so happy that you're here and if I never live to see and I'm so happy that you're here friends we're not complimenting one another these are men of God I want to say to this congregation and all you pastors that are here God knows what he's doing and whenever I I struggle today over what I would say and how far I shall go and I went back I went back brother brandham sometimes tells about something that happened and he talks about it like it happened yesterday and it's maybe 20 and 30 years ago God's the same the god that spoke 20 30 years ago is the same God that speaks 5 minutes ago or five minutes ahead he's the same God and when I came here to speak to you friends I heard one thing this is a wounded one and her husband doesn't know she's written this I go back I'm just one man I'm just a simple man I'm in my study I'm sitting down to study and I'm interrupted in that place and now all these years later about N9 years later I end up and I'm not preaching by myself I end up see all new people and and you need to know why am why we're here Jesus has spoken to us Jesus has spoken to you I do do
