theories got a new one give us a shout in house can we get a shouting house are you sure you can do better man a so penis praise God so failure Bibles three portions of Scripture short ones Psalms 1 3 3 9 verse 17 and 18 Psalms 40 verse 5 and Jeremiah 29 in verse 11 if you have sums 139 17 and 18 it reads how precious are their thoughts unto me O God how great is the sum of them if I should count them they are more in number than the same when I awake I am still worthy my hallelujah isn't that beautiful why and then sounds 40 verse 5 he says many O Lord my God are thy wonderful works which is always done and I thoughts which are to us word they cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee if I would declare and speak of them they are more than can be numbered my that's the thoughts of God what he thinks of us each more than can be numbered and Jeremiah this one I like verse 11 if you have it Jeremiah 29 verse 11 that's what it's easier for I know the thoughts that I think toward you says the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end can I read it again for I know the thoughts that I think toward you it's goal is trying to get it to see what he thinks of you not someone else what he thinks of you say the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end may God add a blessing to the devious world you may be seated so tonight I like to take a title the pride of Christ is God's ether eternal thoughts made manifest hallelujah the word eternal my subject you are always sons you did not become a son you are always the son and then my inspiration God is going to give to you an expected end [Applause] so tonight who is we I want to speak of the bride's pre-existence you come from you not just from here brother Isaac said we're not from Nigeria we're not from Trinidad you existed somewhere before and you were there some way and promises somehow in your human mind you cannot remember it but somehow God sent a prophet in this day and I love this he went so I that he broke into the mind of God and caught the thoughts that was in the mind of God and pulled it down and then came and revealed it to the bride now I have a revelation then I was somewhere else how did I he'd know that godson as a prophet would thus sayeth the Lord that wins oh hi brother that he could catch the thoughts of God and today when it's been preached that's the very mind of God that you sitting within your lap that you have in your shelves that times that you are listening to is the very mind of God so we know now what God fought for this day we have a revelation what God fought for this day brother hallelujah so I'm gonna do can I float on the quotes but he says here before it could be a word spoken it has to be a thought and because a word is the thought made manifest when God speaks now back in the beginning when God looked down through the corridors of heaven he saw all things that were going to happen on earth did you ever just sit and draw a picture in your mind an idea or pinion now that's the way God did perhaps in the beginning then he see it seemed good so what you know he spoke it and as soon as it was spoken it become a word the thought was expressed he's thought and makes it a word and he says once it is spoken he can never take it back again hallelujah brother so once God speaks that word that word can never be taken back again why it's already spoken Oh hallelujah The Devil's in trouble brother he thinks he caught you but you're gonna find out God is a different plane for your life and for you and your situation uh he has thoughts about you that never mind what someone else thinks about you I don't care what anyone thinks about me what they say about me I'm not gonna become a product or some man's opinion but I want to know what God thinks about me what God says about me what these thoughts about me that's what I'm looking and you must never become a product or some men's opinion never allow that none don't let the devil even put something on you and say you nothing he's a liar God says the thoughts I have about you are not evil it's peace hallelujah and it's good [Applause] my he says he can never take it back he says let me inject a fourteen-year even your natural birth is based upon the election now you think you think this is a mystery to be saved in this day and being a message he says your natural birth was based on election and it's a mixed audience but he says the female ovaries produce so many eggs but why is it that at the certain time a certain air comes down and not another one and then amongst the male sperm for wee-wee and for no known reason a certain term attaches itself to the egg while others that could have just as easily attached themselves or had a better opportunity to do so but they did not eat perish there is an intelligence behind all of this otherwise what determines whether the baby is a boy whether it's a girl a blonde the brunette like that boy he says there's an intelligence now I'll in a loggia know your natural birth was not an excellent and Eunice eat you not here by mistake hallelujah so you in the natural water overcometh there was many other germs but you in the natural your natural birth you swam brother there was something in you and intelligence behind her and you swim there brother millions of sperm but you hallelujah you brother to Vega and here you are today you think that's a mistake hallelujah God don't make mistakes you're here for a purpose you here for a specific purpose I feel a shout coming on brother Alleluia so you mean brother Raymond in the natural I'm already overcome now what about your spiritual birth come on our brother brother says there was many others who had an opportunity but they didn't do it they died but you brother hallelujah you had victory in you already you had power in you already you had anointing already why to overcome in the natural how much more the spiritual birth those who have the royal seat on the elect of God are the predestinate Abela Peter for known of God and were in the mind of God named in his thoughts and I want to see we speaking of where we were before we even came here so we were in the mind of God his thoughts in very plain language the true Bride of Christ was in the mind of God eternally though not Express until each came forth in the designated decreed season so God knew this was saying please stay with me you're gonna see you not yet by mistake he says the true bride of Christ was in the mind of God eternally though not Express until each came forth in the designated decree season you could not come in Luther's day you could not come in the Wesley's day but this decree season on the eighth day holy convocation you had to be a brother there's somebody has to be here to bring on the survivor [Music] [Applause] my he says though not express until each came forth in the desert cleave season and each member came forth he became Express and took its place in the body thus the bride what is the literal spoken word see bride now brother this is not small words man this was this was in with the process he picked up his painting right so it wasn't him so when he wrote this was part of it the bride this bride is the literal spoken with she bride so don't look at yourself as and nothing don't sell yourself short you the literal spoken words he bride and that's why the devil fight you because he knows there's a seed inside of your butt brother he will not prevail you have a revelation of you have something in you that overcomes hallelujah did you hear that literal literal spoken with she Brian my and though she's feminine feminine in designation she's also called the body of Christ it is very apparent that she ought to be called that for she was predestinated in him came from the same source was eternal with him what eternal with him and is now manifested in a many member body whereas once goddess manifest into one member in our Lord Jesus Christ and that eternal one was the father manifested in flesh and thereby gained the title of son what's in our he gained the title of son he says even so we eternal in his thoughts in our turn I knew certain in our turn so the profit news has come in our turn hallelujah Luther addison-wesley Eddie Stan the Pentecostals here this so did Malachi fall but what about our turn brother there's gonna be a people in the lane in our turn so even so eternal in his thoughts in our turn become the many members spoken word seed manifested in flesh and those eternal thoughts now manifested in flesh are the sons of God even as we are so called so now you come into your body of flesh you were Turner but now you come into the body of flesh now you hear on the earth you going through situations you can't understand but remember you were already eternal even brother Isaac we speaking to eighth day hallelujah people that come from eternity so this shouldn't be a mystery because you're not in the seven days anymore now you cooked our back into eternity my brother is simply pushing you back up man you know you're not down there we're pushing you back into eternity now come on you gotta be there if you stay down here you gonna be all muddled up you're gonna be mess up brother but now we pushing up when we catching you there where you were before where you always be and you bring light back there hallelujah and that's why the Holy Spirit is brought to you to anoint you and push you back they again I feel the anointing tonight brother I feel the spirit speaking to somebody to say come on get shake yourself get out of that state of laziness and complacency and say Lord I'm hungry but I want to get back to where I was I want to be anointed I don't want to be just complacent and be a church member I want to be a son and a daughter of God my we did not become seat by the rebirth we were seized and therefore we reborn for only the elect can be reborn because we will see it is the reason we could be quickened in Nancy there is nothing to quicken so you think the whole world will embrace this message but you find it's not like that there's nothing in them to quicken but when you only brother yeah something's stimulated in you man you pick up that first spoken word you listen to the first tape and something quicken in your heart why if it was the machine of God in your heart and yet comes a Spirit of God he quickens escena and it made you alive hallelujah so the devil can't take that away from you I don't care how many mistakes you made I don't care how long you fell there's a seed in your heart and that is what the Holy Spirit I'm small hallelujah hallelujah my god hallelujah my he says Jesus poured back his own listen hold us careful in mind take the next step Reidy means to buy back it restores to the original owner God by his death the shed blood bought back his own he bought back the spoken word seed bride my sheep hear my voice the word and they follow me you were always a sheep you were never a pig or a dog turned into a sheep you always this heap to me brother Damon I always was a sheep in my heart though I was in the Sabine's and I was in all the ungodly places wherever you went there was a seed in your heart you are never pretty or you will never talk you were a sheep brother and my sheep will hear my voice hallelujah hallelujah oh praise God [Applause] okay so Jesus had to pay the price to die he had to die and he bought back his own by his blood redeemed the spoken word see bride because Satan would have held it against him and against us but now we can point back and say about that day he paid the price and why did he die brother the brain was saying that a little circle and there was a hickey but that Hickey was when he came down and and to redeem us there's only reason he died he came because someone had to pay the price and then god looked down in the Adam's human race was in chaos no one could redeemer and God says man listen those are my thoughts though they were in my mind holiday a part of me I'm going down to the earth I'm gonna take on the body of flesh and when they nailed him to the cross hallelujah yeah and you and me on his mind and he paid the price brother and here we are tonight we are shocked in the victory we are praising God why we can tell the devil the price was paid you can point back Satan the price was paid the blood is hog accompany some of the work [Music] my mind it's time you preach back to the devil man say that he owned Calvary was for me hallelujah it was for Eamon Thompson it was for just in a play-doh it was rising over it was for you you put your name in there that day he died for me and Satan can no more put anything on you because that day the price was paid and he died to redeem back and he says redeem is to bring it back to the original owner so you're not in the hands of a man he's not in the hands of a group you know in the hands of any Church we are not your underpinner of any no we under the banner of Jesus Christ and you redeemed back to God's hands shake of any sport brother shake of anything that's hanging on you shake it off be like poor winter when the serpent put him in an honest and one important shook it off shake it off into the fire the fire God is here shake it off any problem every sinner every unbelief shake it off but they said that about me shake it off they said that about you shake it off hallelujah hallelujah come on young people shake it off [Applause] [Music] my now we can point back to the day of Calvary Jesus speed it all not just power payment but full payments full payments paid in full hallelujah paid in full my he says yea and brother Peter spoke of the little ego it says yeah but when when he heard the call of the great ego he came to his own place he was in the chicken yard remember but he heard mama eager and once a true son of God hears the cry of the Spirit by the word he too will realize who he is and run to the great prophet eager and be with him forever more seated in heavenly places in Christ Jesus then he says Maki Sonicare then after you recognized the very word of God was eager food then you left the other thing I like this man when you have the message you left the other thing you ran for your life you saw the false you saw they they not true you heard he says you recognized the very word was iike food then you left the other thing he says right there you heard from your theophany [Applause] remember the Raymond the day I heard it that was mighty awfully speaking back to me I heard and he pulled me out of there brother you better believe it you got your own theophany you're not born from some ministers day or phanie you're not born from no organization you born from your own theophany hallelujah the thing you bypass came and called you and you saw it and you learned for your life and we're still learning glory be to God we're learning from every force we running from every interpretation we're running by the way we heard from a theophany Galatians 4 verse 47 and because he has sons God is sent for the spirit of his son into your hearts crying Abba Father wherefore thou are no more a servant but a son and I think too many of us still look at us as servants and Burmese is a servant e-e-e works and he gets his wages he gets his reward but it is a son a son is a person who's in authority [Music] because he comes from his father now we were always sons we come from where of Heavenly Father so we not servants when we are sons speak the word hallelujah speak the word but a son he says and if a son then an heir of God through Christ ladies Jesus Christ came for died upon the cross accomplished redemption restoring to the region only by means of purchase and paying the price thereby he placed us as sons he did not make a sense that's why I made my subject list you were always sons let's see what it says he did not make her sons for we were already his sons but he placed us his sons so brother you were always the sons sister you were always a part of God you didn't become the day you gave your heart to the Lord the day you made the mess you know you are always a Sunnah and I'm speaking to the eighth day people they will recognize this is the sons familiar manner I was somewhere before hallelujah that's why Jesus prayed in John 17 he says father I do not pray for the world but I pray for them that stay in the world but they not of the world but I pray Lord that you keep them while they in the world he says you at glory with him before the foundation of the world you were there [Music] hallelujah and because yes honest God I said for the spirit of a son into your hearts whereby you cry father father hallelujah open wounded the spirit fall in penico sons hoody is fallen on a corinth upon sons while they heard the word he says yeah what is the baptism of the Holy Ghost it is the Spotted baptizing you into the body of Christ it is the new birth it is a Spirit of God coming in and falling you after you have repented ever heard the word and been baptized in water as an answer to good conscience towards God but now the Holy Spirit that's why I don't know who said it one of the minister said the question should be asked have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed and many hasn't gone that far they just happy to be in the message just happy to be in the church but brother we should be hungry for the fully of the Holy Spirit day and night coming in here Lord for me that's my desire to be anointed to be filled with the Holy Spirit ministers should be so bad and the Holy Ghost making sure the people brother listen man that's how winning this brother feels burden that's right this holy convocation is called why for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit upon the people young people you're not gonna make it out there without the Holy Spirit the only thing that will keep you he's the Holy Spirit hallelujah one one man has brother Branham he says I have two children they 16 and 17 he says how can I make them stay in the message or stay in the church he says there's no way they can make it only by the Holy Ghost Oh hallelujah and the Holy Ghost is here tonight and the Holy Ghost is in this meetings you don't walk from here without being Florida it will be upon your own head but tonight you to find out you ordained to receive the Holy Spirit hallelujah so don't be just don't just be satisfied with the first experience when I don't know pharmacy let's the man he says I'll take away the stony heart I'll give you a new heart he says and then I'll give you a new spirit he says many people must understand that they think they have the Holy Ghost but they only have a new spirit he said but then I put my spirit in that spirit that's where you gotta go brother that's why you were you into the Holy of Holies where the Holy Spirit told you I need you lay in a court and it places you right in there and phones you with the Holy Ghost [Applause] my let's see all that is the Splane showing by type like the whole Bible God coming together with a redeemed wife says yeah I pride that God had in his mind now watches so when it comes to the bride it's got to do with God it's got nothing to do with the minister nothing to do with a group got nothing to do with the five for what God coming together with a redeemed wife a bride that God had in his mind before the foundation work that was the attribute of God being displayed and now to make a character that would redeem this woman it had to be something greater than her to Redeemer so God is in his mind how this bride must look but it had to be a great the character so you see goddess is you can't go in on your own merits please man you can't go in on your good cellphone and how good I am and I know this has got to do with redemption and he's choosing so he took a greater character than us to redeem us he says if he is the Redeemer he comes to redeem it is to pick up that which is fallen to redeem back to the place where it was at the beginning so you use me me no profit centers this is the thoughts of God now so none will be picked up by them that was in the thoughts at the beginning he come to the dream not the cannon fodder that we see around professing to be Christians but that he come to redeem that was his attitude which made fresh and redeemable so the minute you come into a body of flesh you become redeemable that's why the Holy Spirit process one other coat the Holy Spirit follows the blood all the way from the book of redemption so the man that you born your name was in the plan section of the book brother that's why you're uncomfortable you'll never be happy in that condition you know why your name is in the blood section of the book and now the Holy Spirit is on your trail and he's gonna bring you to a place where you need to be that's what the Holy Ghost is here for that's why you feel condemn you ought to feel condemn that that's the Holy Spirit don't burn that down [Applause] so you made flesh and redeemable so the manager came into your body you are now redeemable so the Holy Ghost goes to hunting oh I don't care where you run I don't care how are you trying to hide you might hide in the benches Jesus is gonna get you he's gonna get you hallelujah he knows exactly what you're gonna find out he even knows where you sitting do you know that tonight he knows even where you sitting [Applause] so there's no excellence with God and all those who was redeemable believed it because they were in the thoughts of God the attributes of him at the beginning was made flesh and redeemable and was were brought back to God as many as received him to them gave you the power to become the sons of God brother Peter hid another well she had a representation of predestination officials Isaac readers four five one was four five according is what he has chosen us in him not our choosing now you gotta be very careful don't say no I chose him and and I know according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will let me point out here that according to these verses Jesus Christ is doing the choosing halleluyah says got nothing to do with the minister the chosen is according to him now Jesus Christ is choosing his shoes in his own bride just the same as any man chooses their Brides today the bride today does not suddenly decide she's going to take a certain man for a husband Oh sir it's the groom who decides and chooses a sentient human for his bride hallelujah he have not chosen me but I have chosen you now according to the Word of God the bride was chosen before the foundation of the world the choosing of the bride was purposed in himself brother Jesus Christ purpose in himself he's gonna choose a bride and he chose you to be holy and without blame before you mean love when did he do it brother Raymond not the night that you were born not the night you gave your heart to the Lord but before the foundation of the world you were chosen come on young people man can we get a shout in the house yes come on give God back this is for you hallelujah it's for you he gave his life for you [Music] my I'm not gonna let no devil beg me down brother every time he says shut up I'm gonna stand up brother that every time you stand up you define him hallelujah synchronize is in our hands Mustang down but when you lift it up you define nature hallelujah the laws why because you hate gay people [Music] my so I chosen before this world what was in himself he says Ephesians 1 9 in Romans and I'm 11 it says that the purpose of God according to election might stand you can't leave it any other way the heart purpose the eternal purpose of God was to take a pride of his own choosing and that purpose was in himself and being eternal was decreed before the foundation of the world so Jesus didn't decide now I'm gonna choose a bride no he didn't decide well at this holy convocation I'm gonna choose right now he chose this bride win before the foundation of the world you were already chosen man tell him back to the devil here that Satan I chuck it in his face man I was chosen before the foundation of the world hallelujah amen [Applause] my [Applause] my come on man oh I feel my muscles growing brother Peter I feel twice my size I was tired are no more tired why there's something else [Applause] [Music] he says what's carefully now and see this before they was ever speck of Stardust though God was caught even an odd job of adoration no one was there to worship him so he was at that time only a potentially God and he was known only as the Eternal Spirit the bride was already in his mind so I'm speaking of your pre-existence oh you're not a creature of time and we're now broken into eternity we push you back up and and even a year brother says if you see this you'll see many other things if you can see that you're a part of God in his mind come to the earth for a purpose hallelujah when I see that he says you see many more other things brother my he says they known only as the turtles wouldn't the bride was already in his mind yes she was she was existing in his thoughts and what about those thoughts of God they Aeterna are they not that's what I said my title the bride is the eternal thoughts of God made manifest now the devil that that's shaking her do you think of people like this with all the mistakes they the bride yes they'd applied here that say that they are the bride this is a portion of them sitting here tonight and she's all across the world brother there's a people that's called by his name hallelujah that was in the thoughts of God they I eternal are they not the eternal thoughts of God let me ask you are the thoughts of God eternal now yes sir yes he says if you can see this you will see many other things if you can see this you'll see many other things hallelujah God is unchangeable in both essence and behavior he has never had a new thought about anything because all his thoughts he has always had and always will have and knows the end from the beginning because he's God hallelujah they are not something like a man with a blueprint he has grown up in which one day will be translated into substance and form but they are already real an eternal and a part of God so man is gonna build a house so he gets all the bricks and the food in the cement you see he still gotta put the thing together but he's got a blueprint is gonna work by and this foundation must be so deep in this raid and everything and the walls must go up in the roof trust us brother that's what he does but when God looks at this bride she's complete she's already burned up he don't see you with your mistakes and all what is wrong with you he sees you perfect brother he sees you complete hallelujah that's a god I serve man hallelujah is a party and he says yeah so I'm speaking to any people and we're looking with their with a eternal I remember now we're looking with a eternal I it's already real to God so God sees you complete he sees the building standing he sees the house already completed he already sees you as a statue of a perfect man this is you already adopted this is you already coming to your officience he sees you coming into your position he sees you perfected he sees you baptized wasn't filled with the Holy Ghost he sees you already in your in a holy convocation this is you great to free you going free in this time

creature of eternity you come from God and you going back to God you are in the mind of God so you going back where you came from hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] so God don't see like a man he still lets to put it together but when he looks at you you completely separate the lumen I have so many mistakes he sees you complete probably when I still have this hanging on me he sees you perfected he sees you adopted my sees in your visions he see unites a holy convocation where does the revival going on so when he looks now that's why you know I'm so glad to be serve God man always puts man down come on priest back now is that the truth man will always put man down but you know when God looks that's what I don't care about any man's opinion what they think or what they say it's immaterial I'm worried what does God think of me this way I must be connected this way not this way brother this way they catch you off this way it's limited force which only those who love you but this way it's unconditional hallelujah vertical is unconditional [Applause] [Music] [Applause] oh my feel a fire on that man will always put you down they always have a hidden agenda or something but not with God

know even if even if we fail and make mistakes he doesn't disqualify us [Applause] oh man the devil is reaching like this and I love to chuck it in his face brother because you see we were like we love fallen people and we needed a greater character than us to redeem us back and now will redeem back to the mind of God and once you come in flesh so God is not gonna get a listen brother Branham says this earth was baptized in water Noah's day then the blood fell when Jesus sanctified this is the next fire he says he's not gonna discard this earth he renovated tons of every germ every Sunday everything will be burnt off and made new he says he what he'll end up with it he said well that's the same way does he doesn't get rid of you on your earth hallelujah but what does he do he gives you the brand he gives you a water blood spirit fire baptism and then he comes to live on the air that's the same three stages you go through brother sister but he doesn't get rid of her [Applause] hey

gonna preach a note brother pour that's God there's no mistakes with him everything that happens in our life is for a purpose if you see that brother misses you will see many other things Oh God give me a revelation then I can see I'm a part of God I'm eternal as God is eternal I come from God and I'm going back to God it's like that ring is a circle there's no beginning there's no end brother it just continues you come from eternity you bypass your theophany coming to the pony or a place of trying but you go right back again to eternity where you come from how the devil ages where we come from but I see we can brag man hallelujah eight day people we come from eternity man my [Applause] that's the reason when he spoke of a saya they had to come a messiah he spoke there there would be a church in the last days without spot or wrinkle only there will be a church today hallelujah he said it I take his word and I believe it do you see God you don't question his word when he says it you believe it [Applause] [Music] Moses spoke God's thoughts he says because a word is the fourth Express and God brought his thoughts to Moses and Moses spoke them let there be flies and they was flies let the beef Lisa swag is mine and gods mine came in contact Oh hallelujah let me say something to this United I see the churches United Nations uniting its unite the time of God and his bride - and I say this with reverence and respect I believe that the pride is of Christ is called a bee she sailed into the kingdom of God I believe the mechanics is there they waiting for the dynamics that will take care of the earth in the glory in the rapture I believe it with all my heart yes sir we don't know how he's gonna do it but he shall do it I don't know how I cannot explain about you will do it brother and that's what we're waiting for the dynamics could it be this convention when a prophecy as we spoken over the people and you don't question me a chief taken a me embrace it and tell us me hallelujah the reason I believe when the bride is called and elected and set in the book of life there will come a song from heaven that will take such a baptism of the holy spirit into their pride that it will take her from the earth in rapture in Christ God promises don't care how many signs and how many astronauts and signs are being everything else how many million miles they can see I don't care nothing about that there is a heaven and there is the little Jesus now he told us earlier there's a little pride now he says there's a little Jesus the easel heaven and there is a little Jesus hallelujah there's a little Jesus Christ that there that will come in a body form to receive his church himself no matter how old the story seems it's still the truth God said so that's what believers believe can I hear the eight they believe us hallelujah o blessed be the name of the Lord okay now we're gonna hit Jeremiah 29:11 now the thought that got things we always worried what what do you think about me what does she think about me that is not got one thing what anybody thinks about you it's got nothing to do with it I'm interested what does God think about me hallelujah and if I can see that brother I'm gonna see many more things hallelujah so we're gonna hit that speck to the end [Music] my thoughts that I think toward you thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end and when you going through the trial in through your situation you always think God is judging you but if you take that scripture it says my thoughts towards you that I think they are good and peace and they are not evil so God on the evil of his bride what man will do that brother God don't think evil of his bride [Applause] my it says what it says my thoughts that I think toward you the thoughts of peace and not of evil so we for ever thinking that when we go through a situation it's evil I must have done something wrong God is punishing me no God got you where he wants you he got you in that situation in your job well you don't know which way I do have a job when you go back on Monday he got in that situation you don't even have money to pay your rent he got your next situation not because he thinks evil but my thoughts are peace and not of evil to give you an expected end hallelujah Philippians will seek been confident of this very thing that he has become a good work in you will complete it until the day of Jesus I sort of looked up expected end they say for I know thy thoughts towards you the thoughts of peace and not of evil to give me watch a future hope whoa annex so you see we were in here in-between but God is looking at the end he said I'm the first and I'm the last he's not worried what happens in between he took care of the bad end and the beginning he took care of it and yet you worried about what's happening in your life brother I don't care what drama you have I don't care what drama you have sister but there's a plan of God working
