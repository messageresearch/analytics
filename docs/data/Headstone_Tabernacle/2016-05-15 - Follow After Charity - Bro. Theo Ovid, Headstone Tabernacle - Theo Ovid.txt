morning oh praise God hallelujah God hallelujah praise the Lord amen hallu so you ready for the word this morning oh Hallelujah so we want to stand we want to turn our Bibles to 1 Corinthians chapter 13 and 1 Peter chapter 2 for scripture reading certainly blessed last week to be here Ministry of reconciliation 1 Corinthians chapter 13 want to read that old chapter and then we just read first verse of 14 do I speak with the tongues of men and angels and have not charity I am become a sounding brass or tinkling symbol though I have the gift of Prophecy understand all Mysteries and all knowledge do I have all Faith so I could remove mountains and have no charity I am nothing and though I bestow my goods to to feed the poor though I give my body to be burned have the charity it profited me nothing charity suffered long and is kind charity vaed it and charity envieth not charity vaed not itself is not puffed up do not behave itself unseemly seeketh not her own is not easily provoked thinketh no evil rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth bear at all things believeth all things hope at all things endureth all things charity never fail it whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away when I was a child spake as a child understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things and now we see through glass actly and then face to face now I know in part but then shall I know even as also I am known now abided faith hope charity these three but the greatest of these is Charity let's continue follow after charity and let's go to 1 Peter chapter 2 want to read from verse 4 to whom come in also as a living Stone disallowed indeed of men but chosen of God and precious ye also here's the description as Lively Stones not dead ones I built up a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ wherefore also it is contained in the scripture behold I lay in Zan a Chief Cornerstone elect precious he that believeth on him shall not be confounded unto you therefore which believe he is precious but unto them which disobedient the stone which the builders disallowed the same is made head of the Corner Stone of stumbling Rock of offense even to them which stumble at the word being disobedient where unto they were appointed but ye are chosen generation royal priesthood a holy nation A peculiar people that you should show forth the Praises of him who had called you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light which in time pass were not a people but a now the people of God which had not obtained Mercy but now have obtained Mercy dearly beloved I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims abstain from fleshly lust which bore against the soul let's pray once more father we love you and we thank you for your word Feed Us Lord with your the bread of life break the bread of life unto us this morning Lord May the people be strengthen in the Inner Man May the love of God vibrate through this building here take all the evil out Lord take all the unbelief out father and may a Revival fire break into every soul here in Jesus name I ask it if they sick in our midst heal them if they are bong in our midst free them if they backsliders in our midst restore them if they are sinners in our midst save them in Jesus we ask it amen and amen as you take your seat Give the Lord some [Applause] Praises Hallelujah to God thank you Jesus Hallelujah have a title follow after charity and have an inspiration charity never fa it follow after charity and that word and Amplified is to eagerly pursue and seek to acquire this love make it your aim or your Great quest pursue it go after it press towards it make that effort so just to connect back to last week's service we read the scripture from 1 Peter 48 and above all things have fervent charity among yourselves for charity shall cover a multitude of sins Colossians 3 and above all these things put on charity which is the bond of perfectness amen and where we got that inspiration from uh it was God that 2 Corinthians 5 it was God personally present in Christ reconciling and restoring the world to favor with himself not counting up and holding against men their trespasses but canceling them and committing to us the message of reconciliation or restoration to favor amen so God purpose this morning is that each one of you will be restored into favor with God that's why we are here we are here to be restored Hallelujah into favor with God when man fell we fell out of favor with God and God put angels to guard the tree in the Garden of Eden that man in that Fallen condition wouldn't partake of that tree of life isn't that right but when Jesus came he bring bring the connection it come like your phone get cut and what Jesus came he come to restore the phone line amen that you could have access to your father amen so when he died he paid a price to reconnect you amen into heaven L places to reconnect you into your sunship into your godship to reconnect you with your inheritance because Adam lost it Adam forfeited it and God want to reconnect his people because it belongs to you the devil can't own it his hand is too greasy and filthy to own this inheritance it belongs to our the sons of God so we have to come to a place to recognize what is our Redemptive rights because the devil can't interfere with it and you can't partake of it if you don't know it's yours that is given for you and you have a right to it glory to God how many understand that now oh glory to God so the devil he is only jealous because he cannot possess what it belongs to you he cannot ever inherited it because the book that Adam had he went back in the hands of the original owner Satan was Wai to catch the book because he saw the book slipping out of Adam's hand that was the objective to take away the book of redemption but it was sealed the mystery of it seal so when the devil looking to get the deed to take over the Earth it went back in the hands of the original owner waiting for the cry to come out who is worthy to take the book and to loose the Seven Seals there oh glory god and John was weeping because there was no man worthy a man had to come forth a Kinsman had to come forth and here come that Bloody bleeding Lamb of God here come that bloody bleeding Lamb of God even Jesus oh he died to take the book oh we are free this morning oh hallelujah hallelujah here am I to worship here am I to bow down and the four be say amen and the 24 Elders they begin to worship and thousands time thousands oh that's what we here to do oh Hallelujah so every service you supp be more excited let be seated every service used to be more used to be more trilled to know that we are closer than the day before Oh Hallelujah you being restored back to favor so God take you to plant you by the by a by by the rivers of water where your leaves will not withen and whatsoever you do going to prosper with the is not so blessed is the man that walth not in the counsel of the ungodly nor stand in the way of Sinners or sit in the seat of the scornful but his Delight is in the law of God and in that Lord do he meditate day and night he shall be he shall be he you can't stop that man give me a housewife give me a preacher give me anybody that going to put God first I will show you a man that is successful despite all what theyve devil put in front of here oh we have something to shout about oh we have something to praise God [Applause] [Music] about you may be seated if you don't want to shout I'll shout for you but this message is too real for me to sit dead I will shout for you and me too but I ain't going to let no rocks out praise me Jesus said if they don't shout if they don't worship the Rocks going to cry [Applause] out I don't care your roof blow out last night you supposed to give God worship and tell the Devil he's a liar you getting another Roof oh give the Lord some praises [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah let's rock the boat yes yes let's rock the [Applause] boat be seated Hallelujah I don't want you to be predictable am I want you to be unpredictable because the devil predicting you long time because you born in shape iniquity heart condemn you you do this something go wrong the devil understand that he he long time in his business he has nothing new to discover he has nothing new to unfold it's only God have stuff that the devil know nothing about that's why he put silence under the S seal to confuse the devil he don't know what happening there he don't even know what happening right now he don't even know you're being loosed you being set free you don't even know the Holy Ghost has been disguised as the word and you have received it in the word form he don't even know that the transforming power the power of love is here oh glory to [Applause] godil don't know [Applause] that brother bam came to introduce us to Messiah let to be message [Music] people you supposed to have a personal relationship with Christ you love the Breen love the Breen that's fine but you have to know Christ and Christ is the [Applause] word Solomon build him a house right how be the most high dwelleth not in temp made with hands building my great house beautiful house with stones cut from all around the world hounded in the individual country honed in their individual country that when Solomon got the stones he just had to fit it here fit it there it's already cut already honed already shaped already formed not even my hammer not even my saw was heard he just laying it there laying it there behold I lay in Zion for foundation of stone and God begin to fit them stones and you are a Lively Stone that God is about to cut that God is about to shape that God is about to hone we also are Lively Stones you got to know who you are Oh Glory [Applause] hallu I like that wonderful I like that am normally see a stone on the ground that a a stone that dead stone he's saying you are one of that but a lively one that me you can raise your hands that mean you can shout that mean you no dumb dog in Israel praise God you could open your mouth and give God Praises that means Heaven could look down this morning and said there's a bunch of people in Sandy Grandy like they don't care they don't care who in front of them they don't care

they don't ask at all all right all right open your mouth and ask them how are you going and if you have a $5 here and a $1 here and they're not going so good take the five and give them it and see

love one another amen for love is of God hallelujah and everyone that loveth is born of God that's right and knoweth God hallelujah he that loveth not knoweth not God for God is love in this was manifested the love of God towards us because that God sent his only begotten son into the world that we might live through him hearing his love not that we love God but that he loved us sent his son to be a pretation for our sins beloved if God so love us we ought also to love one another no man had seen God at any time if we love one another God dwelleth in USU and his love is perfected in US hereby know we that we dwell in him and he in us because he had given us of his Spirit verse 16 and we not have known and believe the love that God had to us God is love he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God and God in him there's the last scripture I have here hearing is our love made perfect amen that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world there is no fear in love but perfect love casteth out fear because fear had torment he that fearth is not made perfect Hallelujah in love hallelujah what is he saying as you walk towards love you get less fear Hall follow after charity as you walk in love the fear of men the fear of failure the fear of Fallen the fear of mistakes all of that be to dissolve because you're walking in the love of God nothing could hurt you or harm you because you're in the will Hallelujah of God he that fear it is not made perfect in love with love him because he first love us if a man say I love God and hated his brother he's a liar for he had he had that loveth not his brother whom he had seen how can you love God whom he had not seen all right amen all right amen and this commandment have read from him that he who love God love his brother also oh praise God do you love the Lord this morning praise the Lord hall hallelujah hallah Hallelujah Jesus for a message Called Love brother brandom I say this tonight as a minister of the gospel I've tried I have had the privilege of preaching around the world before tens of thousands of people and every Divine promise in the Bible is true and if you take the right mental attitude towards any of God's Divine promises it will bring it to pass amen if you can take the right attitude our scripture tonight is God so love the world and if there's anything that the world is dying for today is love in my travels I find that it's the rejected stone that keeps the building from being fit together where the assemblies in the Church of God the Baptist methodists will shake hands and be brothers if they just had love one for another that is the great need the world is dying for and God is love and you find the church that what's hindered the church has been a wrong conception of Love Now love there are two different types of love that's real love one of them is the Greek word called agapo that's God's love and there's a Ed love called filio love which is human love filio comes from the word Fellowship the filio love is what you have for your wife a man might flirt with her or insult her you will shoot his brains out over her that's what fil your love will do it accompanies jealousy and many other things goes with it but a gapo love will make you pray for his sinful Soul that's the difference between the two loves God's love is the beginning of love it's the function of love and the church today is lacking in that that real agapo love that makes you have love for your enemy and if we only had that kind of a love there'll be a Revival sweep this nation from coast to coast from north to south and the reason that we do not have that love the main reason the church is not progressing like it should we don't need theology we need Rel love to go with theology we already know hallelujah hallelujah we don't need another Doctrine we don't need another mystery we had them for 40 plus years what we need is the spirit Hallelujah love Dynamics the Holy Ghost charity love divine to come upon what you already know hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah we only need love we love to go with the theology we already know we all argue so much whether we should be baptized forward backwards whatever more but that don't make any difference how you're baptized or what church you belong to or what evidence that you have that you're a Christian if you haven't got love you haven't got God we need love God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son now when love is projected and come to its end soving Grace produced to project that love projected oh praise the name of the Lord Brother Bram from my new ministry jville brother brandham as soon as I return from California the Lord willing what the Bram Tabernacle needs a Revival amen they need a Revival and a filling of the Holy Ghost and that's a great need of the Tabernacle some of the finest people in the world comes here but what we need is the baptism of the Holy Ghost I feel it I can tell it and as soon as we return back if the Lord willing we're going to have a Revival for that very purpose that's the members of this Tabernacle and other people who are seeking the Holy Ghost might come in and give instructions and everything half prayer meetings in here to receive the Holy Ghost and that the church might get back into the will of God and move on with the program of God as it moves on oh Hallelujah so himself saw the need for the Holy Ghost in his church isn't that right so you said what God calls foolish what man's called foolish God called great so that we have got to do is to get back into the program of God are you in God's program or are you coming to church you have to know the program of God and you know you're in the program of God then no devil could throl your offbeat no devil could thr your off balance because you're in God's program it's God's program for you be here this morning because he said don't forsake the assembling of yourself together as the manner of some is you can't still listen to books and display tape that's the purpose to get be in a church there's a purpose to be in Fellowship there is unction and and and words coming from God that you need to hear and need to know but more than that is only in this environment you could get to access brotherly kindness Hallelujah only in a group scenario can somebody Mash your corn mash your toes a fect your life frustrate your life and only in this circumstance you could get the opportunity to forgive and repent and say forgive me say I'm sorry say I'm wrong bless God to be in a group that feels the spirit of God Hall so somebody upset you you're in the right place hallelujah amen somebody hurt you is in the right place you feeling bad about this one you're in the right place what you going to do about it Christian man Christian woman what you going to do about it oh Hallelujah this word going to live it's going to thunder the devil going to be stunned because it look like the honey won't stick but the honey will stick oh give the Lord a [Applause] shout now watch all this forgiveness forgiveness most of the time is just talk

forgiveness it's really forgiven that's right it's really released it's really it come true because you're in the spirit of it hallelujah hallelujah now you're going to need the spirit of forgiveness in order to approach charity amen no we get into something because he said we have to come to this Ministry what Ministry the ministry of Jesus Christ we have to come to the king you can't just walk

weapon of warfare you one time Jesus before Lazar he said Lord God I know that thou always harass me but for dear sakes Hallelujah he was in a different realm all together that power of that prayer

is Promised isn't that right this great servant Moses message butam but Moses had no Fellowship not one thing in that 40 years was spoke that God did for him or anyway and he Supernatural he was out of fellowship and when the church gets out of fellowship with God Miracle cease signs of w cease Revival cease just moves right out when when you get out of Fellowship oh so he said the bride has not a Revival as yet it will take them seven tunders that means seven tunders have to bring back the blood amen because the blood is what going to bring fellowship and fellowship going to bring Revival okay now the thing to do is keep is keep that's what I'm trying to say a while the love of God in your heart keep fellowshipping with him and he will add these other things just as we mature Hallelujah that's very important Hallelujah but talk about somebody got the Bap Holy Ghost and say shall I ask God for gifts he said and become a stuff shirt because that's what people do they get a little blessing they get puffed up so he said no don't do that let the Lord lead you and different thing like that so watch I keep fellowship with him and he will add these things other things just as we mature don't you think so so so Moses was out of Fellowship no Fellowship dear what Hallelujah no Fellowship out there in a strange country among strangers not his own people she was his the people there was Ethiopians and he was a Jew completely out of the reach of God seemingly are you ready and God all the time knowing that no matter how much of a mess that God that man makes out of the program of God God is going to straighten it [Applause] out no matter what mess is in this message God will straighten it out Moses was 40 years under silence normal living and God waiting for his time to reconnect back Moses to his commission and purpose nothing could stop it not his backsliding not his running nothing could stop it and your backsliding and running that ain't going to stop it this happened that happened that ain't going to stop it the purpose that God put inside for your life that must must must be accomplished because he said my word shall not Hallelujah return unto me

Christ David was crying out saying God is my rock my Revelation now Peter Rock confession which we know he would build his Church on the Rock not Peter being a stone as a Roman Catholic tries to say it but Peter's confession of the Revelation that's the church amen God will reveal it not a confession of this man because later he backslid not not a conviction of him being the Son of God because they knew he was the son of God am Peter just said it but it what it was it was the Revelation that had been revealed from Heaven that he was a Son of God so it wasn't the words that the Son of God no it was the fact that Peter heard from Heaven that he was the son of God that was divine revelation coming to Peter huj and you have the ability come on I want to give a shout on that you have the

you Lord then this Tabernacle the the individuals they are the Tabernacle contain the Holy Ghost I want to get to now the honey represent Brotherly Love brotherly kindness which is the age I just got through telling you brotherly kindness is believeing now now you might see I sure don't like brother Neville I sure don't like brother Jones I don't like brother son so but something like that but let something happen to him your heart is broke it just nearly kill you we can obtain brotherly kindness and feeling for one another to maintain it in a group grp why do you care for that brother because you broke bread with him at the altar you fellowship with him you shook his hands you worship with him he's your brother listen he might do something in the flesh that you would disagree with right because you kind of stay you oughtn't to do it sh a little bit but at the bottom of your heart if something happened to that brother it will kill you or that sister I'm a old man I have once young and now I'm old I've seen it Through the Ages here people say I won't have no more to do with him and something happened to that man it nearly kills him oh God I let my precious brother go without making friends with him see his Brotherly Love here we go it looks like it won't stick but it does stick the honey it sticks real honey it have the fast food honey you know just sticking at all it's just a fasting a temporary temporary thing so each age each one of these age had that rock confession and brother I'm talking about uh the SL sleeping waiting wait waiting waiting see until this age but soon the Holy Ghost being poured out from Christ will come and seal at the church then the church will be raptured it'll be a complete unit of the Lord God hallelujah oh Hallelujah could you take some more Hall the other night I made a statement at the pulpit saying this that I would rather see Brotherly Love existing among the church if we didn't have one case of Divine Healing or anything else we must know what these things are for I rather have a church listen just a moment I would rather have a church that knows nothing about spiritual gift and just be so in love with each other and with Christ I'd rather have that than every spiritual gift operating in the church now I know that my song Hard in a Pentecostal group but I would rather have it where there is gifts they would fail where there is gifts they'll be conf bring confusion where there is gifts they can be questioned but where there is love it's perfect amen hallelujah that's right so if you are per perfect love you'll have perfect gifts that's right so work first with love that brings fellowship and fellowship brings gifts Hallelujah so when people push off the switch and W in the darkness there's no Fellowship it is evidence there is no love because you don't have to agree with me to fellowship with me we don't have to believe the same thing for you to be a friend with me there are people evil to toward each other in church but they're talking to unbeliever in their job they're talking to people they don't know they will go and eat dinner with them they will go and have fellowship with them and that is not a problem but they have a big problem to repent and repent and to somebody that they offend in church Hallelujah whether you say H or not that doesn't bother me I cannot proof that long time I I don't that don't but whether you say Amen or not as long as I'm speaking what I believe God lay upon my heart that's it whether you face hard what say don't don't say that doesn't matter I'll say it still that's just how I am built I get to know how I am built just have to bring the word and just slam it in Hallelujah the bride just eat it all up because she loves her husband her mate the revealed word so once they're hearing the revealed word they say that's mine that's mine come on preacher give it to me give it to me go hold back give it to me I don't want to hear a dream like you had last night no give it to dream you would like to know what a dream last night all right so now work with love First Love brings Fellowship Fellowship bring gifts he say what the world need today is a filling a filling and when The Dumping out comes it needs a filling what does that fing do when it comes in what does the fing do what it does where you have doubts it brings fith where you have indifference it brings love where you have hatred it brings Fellowship hallelu so this message need a big dumping in of the Holy Ghost oh Hallelujah and when the Church of the Living God someday will be United under one great head amen that will be the head of God go into the unity of the body of Christ will be the governor and the King and the Lord over the entire church under his control am that head will not be the Pope that will be the Lord himself could you take a little more we have more it's coming watch he talking about the Luther just lost a light one more they lost coin the Pentecostal Church lost their light and so on he said but watch I don't care if you're Methodist she had a house Ste in time she scrubbed the floors she swept the walls she took down the cup web she kept on until she found what she had lost and when she did she called her little sister churches to come now I don't care if you're Methodist here we go Baptist Pentecostal Presbyterian let us rejoice together when that time come prophecy when the church finds his brotherly love so the prophet knew it will be absent he Prophet knew it will be something that was lost but you also knew we would find it when the church finds his brotherly love when the church finds his holy disty when the church finds his place in Christ it will call to the members of the body come and rejoice with us God wants the church to love [Music] himall people love the pastor but he want the church to love hallu him hallelujah praise God Amen now you know a confession a decision is a confession confession is a stone you said what good is Du to pile up a bunch of stones if you haven't got a stone cutter here we go to shape them by a sharp twet sword of the word into Sons and Daughters of God Amen so the object of the word coming to us is to shape us that's not for us to get a blessing on a Sunday but for you to be shaped amen because you are a stone I want to say a living Stone a Lively Stone but you have to be cut to be fitted in some people like theel they don't want to change because they are satisfied with themselves but when get troubled in your spirit that you are not all right amen you need something more then you can say Lord chip me hone me cut me hallelujah amen hallelujah oh praise God thank you Lord so watch praise God let them run around here with all kind of woman dressed like skin dong we and call himself Christian men letting them do it and calling themselves Servants of Christ and the church in a lukewarm condition we need stones here we go cut into Sons and Daughters of God Amen that's why the prophet when he left he left a Ministry on the earth to continue bringing the word say what the tape say that we could be cut to be shaped another time he said make yourself a Christian Hallelujah you're not an instant Christian is have a a tablet to pop it inside you and become a Christian you're baptized and become a Christian no you make yourself a Christian you overcome

Christ act the Life of Christ do the Life of Christ we have got a Ministry coming what exactly like The Life of Christ what will that Ministry identify the coming of the Lord oh blessed be the name of the Lord praise God praise God hallelujah so Joseph had that rainbow quat right and that quat B says that represented that robe of seven colors was upon Joseph was Upon Jesus was the baptism of Holy Ghost the body was covered with a robe the church is not you it's the holy ghost that got you covered amen from Hebrews seven is complete God was complete seven spirits those Spirits were perfect the first was the color of red perfect love Redemption and how we had time and so on he said those colors represent the motives of God the attitude of God those seven colors represent seven churches isn't that right all those Spirits seven spirits makes up what in Revelation it makes up God was Perfection and the only way we could come back to the Perfection is to come back to that Perfection which is God in other words we have to come back to that seven perfect Spirits all those Seven Virtues flowing into your life here's what I want to get to the motives of it if you just get it for somebody that's different if a man is guilty and lot here we go had wentong and backslid though he was a Hebrew he went down and was backslid he was in Grace but he had fallen from it and lot was saved don't ever think lot wasn't saved he was because all the time when he was in the wrong place the Bible said the sins of Sodom Vex his righteous Soul daily now his flesh was doing one thing but what was his end he brought more disgrace his wife turned to a pillar of salt he had children by his daughter so you see what his great had brought because he had fallen from grace and never restored himself back again but God had to take him out of the Earth but still here we go this a big one he was a fallen brother L was and Abraham done all that he could do Amen to bring him back again amen am the spirit that was in Abraham is the spirit of Christ that is in the church today or should be in the church today doing what doing all that you can do to bring back your messed up Fallen backsliding brother who out of favor with God but the spirit of Christ will come with the ministry of reconcil creation to bring back your brother back into favor with God that is the spirit of Christ oh give the Lord a shout Glory Glory Hallelujah no matter what the brother done no matter what the worst of sin the worst of whatever condition the filthy of of condition that's what the blood is for that's what Jesus died for for the worst sin for whatever fornication adultery lying whatever condition it is it doesn't matter that's what the blood is for that's what the attorney is for that's what Jesus died for he died for your sins to redeem you from your sins to deliver you from your sins that you can go [Applause] free no matter what the brother has done you will do all you can to bring him back into Fellowship of Christ again no matter what he has done Oh Glory to God God this some God keep his word won't have a freak body amen hallelujah he wouldn't have six fingers on one hand it'll be five fingers on one hand the body of Christ won't be a freak amen when the last person comes in into the body of Christ then it's over yes maybe over in Africa today the last one will be brought in then the book is closed but God will not have a freak body amen watch amen Jesus have to come down himself at the head of the church and he will resurrect this church being his own body there is the body and the way God is expecting us as individuals to grow is the way he brought a church to grow every church is to bring one Church watch these fellows were required watch okay let me go first seven things Faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness Brotherly Love ad brotherly kindness and then the love of God the Holy Ghost Christ in the person of the Holy Ghost comes upon you in the true baptism of the Holy Ghost when you get all these virtues sealed in you then God lives in a tabernacle called the building the living Tabernacle of the living God's dwelling place and when a man possesses these things then the Holy Ghost comes upon him no matter you might speak with tongues no matter in person gift but you still might do that but until these virtues go into you you are still off the real true foundation of faith and then these virtues grow in and you add to that then you are living Monument you are living moving Idol huah Hallelujah where I'm going with all of this well on the message got the guide boram says if God give a duck enough s to ddge the coldness how ought he give the church if a dock can by Instinct what about the Holy wor in the church it ought to lead us from formalities and Creeds into a glorious wonderful baptism of the Holy Ghost that brings virtue and knowledge and patience so since the prophet left the guide was supposed to guide us to this oh my you should be shouting since the Prophet left the guide was supposed to guide the people not the ministerial associations not the message popes and Bishops but to this year watch the church watch it ought to lead us from formalities and Creeds and things into a glorious wonderful baptism Holy Ghost where it brings virtue and knowledge patience godliness and the Holy Spirit that's what the real guide will lead because he will breathe nothing else but the gospel amen oh Hallelujah Glory when dark is perfect has come and we have it today by God's help the perfect interpretation of the word with Divine Vindication perfect interpretation of the word where you could see where you are and see where God want you to be day without us not made perfect isn't that right oh hallelujah praise God praise God so the prophet said the people in the message the the faith isn't ripe enough oh my God he talking about the rting of your faith we have to come to brotherly kindness which ripens your faith because faith is based on forgiveness faith is based on forgiveness so therefore in the ripening of your faith it has to have the application of the blood of Brotherly kindness isn't that right oh praise God praise God oh Hallelujah I'm about to close oh praise be to Jesus Oh My My My My I want to bring something to you that brother kman had brought out and this was such a blessing to me this is the of June 1991 for a message to brotherly kindness at charity and in this message he fleshed out the contents of Charity in a particular way that I want to bring it back to you Hallelujah you know baram says may God uh raise up men to make more sense to this message this make more sense to this whole thing called charity am let me just bring it here to you now charity we are talking about is not some kind of society Give Good Will and give some clothes and so forth and old shoes we're not talking about that kind of Charity we're talking about a gapo love spontaneous Divine love there are nine ingredients I picked out of here in 1 Corinthians 13 of divine love it's right in the scripture patience here we go this is love passive no hurry suffers long bears and believe and hope and endures all things you find that in verse four and S kindness number two Love In Action never Acts rashly or incidentally not inconsistent or puffed up or proud that's in verse four number three generosity loving competition not envious or jealous number four humility loving hiding not running around you know a parade I'm a Christian no hirs Works does his things then retires out of the way it gets off the scene after good works of the food off it goes doesn't stand around how do you like that does it how does it taste no it's gone amen it's not looking for medals or Merit watch number five courtesy love in society courteous does not behave unseemly always polite it don't push it don't shove always polite at home it's at home with all classes of people black white yellow red or IND different it's still the same it don't just love the lovely it loves the unlovely all class never rude or discourteous number six unselfishness love in essence never selfish sour or bitter seeks Only the Good of others doesn't run others down it lifts others up seek Only the Good in others does not retaliate and seek revenge Hall number seven good temper love and disposition never irritated never resentful number eight righteousness Lov and conduct hate sin never glad when others go wrong always gladdened by the goodness to others always slow to expose charity Heights of multitudes of sin number nine sincerity love in profession never boastful or conceited not a hypocrite always honest leaves no impression but what is strictly true never self assertive am does not Blaze out in Passionate anger why did she do this to me I don't understand always joyful truthful knows how to be silent full of trust always present praise God don't we speak with the tongu of men and angels and have no charity and become a sounding brass and a tinkling symbol do you understand the Miss of the Rapture if you don't have charity It Don't Mean a Thing to you do I understand all the tunders all these things it means nothing to you until you have charity oh blessed be the name of the Lord Halle Hallelujah so that's it how many appreciate that word now so I have it listed I want to go it over number one patience amen love passive let me S this here hallelujah I just want to read it back you have to find it do I bestow my goods to feed the poor do I give my body to be burned have no charity probably nothing charity suffer long and is kind charity envieth not charity vaed not itself is not puffed up do not behave itself unseemly seeketh not her own is not easily provoked think it not no evil rejoice it not in iniquity this is Charity talk about charity the love of God this is it here Rejoice not in iniquity but rejoice it in the truth bear at all things believe it all things hope at all things endure it all things charity never fail there's some people like to hear Bak like to hear evil like to hear like to say this thing happened to this one and that one happened to this one like to point out faults and failures and shortcomings they love that that is not charity we just read what charity is rejoice it not in iniquity amen hallelujah but rejoices in the truth oh praise God number one patience love passive no hurry suffers long bears and believes and hopes and do all all things number two kindness love in action number three generosity love and competition there's some people they can't they don't like to lose they're not generous somebody win something somebody looking good they can't say congratulations that's a hard thing it's them or nobody else it's all about them humility love and hiding no parade courtesy I like this one love in society courteous does not behave itself unseemly always polite number six unselfishness love in essence never selfish sour or bitter seeks Only the Good of others number seven good temper love in disposition musician come up please number eight righteousness loving conduct hate SIN number nine sincerity loving profession oh praise God butam said this I believe the time is coming the manifestation of the gifts that's GI to every man that profit all I believe gifts are wonderful we need them and respect them and I believe the time coming when it's going to be in a higher standard than that after all of these things is done away that which is will endure forever it's the love of God we be just standing preaching like this and love will just settle over the building hallelujah oh hallelujah praise God the message of Grace he say takes the sincerity it takes the Simplicity of believing God to make his word speak out to show that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever Hallelujah it takes a humble heart dedicated to God to bring Jesus Christ into present tense oh hallelujah praise God I'll close with one last scripture from Mark 11 Jesus answers telling them have faith in God for verely I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be th cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he sayth shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he say it and therefore I say unto you that whatsoever things you desire When you pray believe you receive them and you shall have them when you stand praying forgive if you have ought against any that your father also which is in heaven May forgive you your

joined a group and you really want to put your shoulder to the wheel to assist in whatever way feel free to speak to brother Steven or the different groups and feel free to join and help and even if you are in one group and you feel super inspired to help out another group you are totally welcome to do so you know we not restricted to being in one group if you want to you know being another group you are totally welcome to do so and we also want to leave a last note of an encouragement with the upcoming convention time is moving very fast we're just about six seven weeks away from the convention we do solicit your continued support in particular financially uh whatever you feel free to give the sisters will be downstairs collecting um there's no set amount you give from your heart we're looking for God to do something tremendous during that convention 8th 9th and 10th of July people are under expectation we are looking for the sick to be healed we're looking for backsliders to be restored we are looking for demons that have been living in houses for a long time to get their final eviction notice because the enforcer is here amen and we need to make room because we have a lot of young people who are struggling and waiting for us to come to Perfection and come into power to speak them out of their condition that's what we are PR preparing for not just to come and have word and more word but we are preparing for word and spirit to come together and for the Dynamics to strike our mechanics and for these mortal bodies to put on immortality can I get a witness in the house this morning so beyond the natural we want to encourage you to begin to take time out every week to pray fast that you could do on your own you don't need permission from the pastor to fast you don't need permission to pray you don't need permission to hold on to the horns of the altar because you are looking for your change to come you are looking for your family to be delivered you are looking for your son to be restored and as we do that and you bring your fire and you bring your fire and the minister comes anointed then God has to do something because he promised to deliver he promised to heal he promised to seal and as brother brandham said Jesus didn't just heal because he felt like healing he healed because the scripture said he would he didn't deliver because he feel like delivering today but the scripture said he will deliver and God is obligated to bring the scriptures to pass you being here this morning is scripture being fulfilled and God cannot lie he will not lie have a wonderful blessed week give the devil trouble because you are Sons and Daughters of the Living God may God richly bless you give the Lord a shout of Praise as we prepare to leave this house Hallelujah ushers deacons will walk in the light we walk W in the light
