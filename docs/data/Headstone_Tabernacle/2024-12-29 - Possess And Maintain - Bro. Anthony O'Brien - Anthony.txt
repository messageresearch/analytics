hearts we pray that by the grace of God he will help us this morning in what whatever way he can we know he can do it we just L ourselves open to what God wants to do this morning thank you so much musicians so one scripture we just want to read and it'll be from Exodus 23 verses 29 and 30 amen so we know Exodus 23 God is speaking said behold I send my angel before you and what not but we just want to Z zero in on this portion of that scripture passage uh from 29 okay so Exodus 23 and verse 29 says I will not drive them out from before thee in one year lest the land become desolate and the beasts of the field multiply against thee but little by little and little I will drive them out from before thee until thou be increased and inherit the land may God have blessing to the reading of

the spirit we pray that you would come and breathe life into this word this morning Lord we have a thought here you'd like to share with the people Lord we need strength father we come to draw strength from your word Lord we pray your spirit would come and unfold the word in a way that would strengthen somebody here this morning or maybe listening on the Internet or wherever they might be we pray that the word of God will do the work this morning uh we just lay ourselves uh before the altar of Grace Lord that you would come and have your way bless your word bless your people Inspire us as we sit at your feet and wait to hear what you would speak to us Lord granted almighty God I surrender to you now in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen and amen you may have your seats now and give the Lord Praise amen because that's what we're here to do amen just going to amen take my jacket off amen amen praise God just making myself a little comfortable here amen well we thank God to be here this morning amen amen praise the name of the Lord so it's a privilege to speak to you this morning and we have a title this morning and the title is possess and maintain as the title I have this morning possess and maintain um so quite recently the idea of Maintenance uh and upkeep has been a an idea that has been quite personally intriguing to me um more and more recently I'm seeing the value uh or the there's an excitement I have almost in maintaining and upkeeping things you know uh you a father of a household and so on uh you know and there's things that need replenishing there's consumables that uh we are using every day every time you start your car oil is being used uh you know liquids uh oils um you know replenishables braks fluid uh the battery going down every time you start it um all these things have a shelf life um because we live in such a world where we need to maintain the things that we have in order to keep the value of it see the value of it to preserve the value of it it requires maintenance it requires for you to maintain the things that you possess and more and more I'm seeing there's value in it uh and there's great satisfaction in it because you know they always say the grass is greener on the other side well that's because somebody is maintaining it uh it's only Greener because somebody is watering a little more than maybe you are watering and it just looks a little Greener and maybe if you did some watering yours would be just as green isn't that right you see and uh sometimes we see things flourishing and replenishing and and and bringing forth fruit but the secret is in the way that it's being kept the way that it's being maintained and um when your life is is filled with blessings or when your life is filled with things that that you know you didn't give yourself you know that something is keeping you something is maintaining your your stand this morning the only reason you came into the building this morning with a smile on your face and with a praise in your heart is because there's some spirit this morning that is keeping you from from coming off the road that is keeping that is holding the rains it was a hand of God in your life maintaining the blessings maintaining the presence upon you maintaining the glory that is upon your face this morning that's why we give him all the glory that's why we give him all the praise because we couldn't keep ourselves it is he that had made us and not we ourselves we are his people and the Sheep of his pasture and he is the Good Shepherd that lookth after the sheep and it's the shepherd business to make sure that you are well taken care of to make sure that you look good this morning because when you testify you could tell them I didn't do it myself I couldn't keep myself but when I went through the trial he kept me when I went through the darkness the cruel crushing an oppressive darkness something inside of me wouldn't let me give up something inside of me wouldn't let me let go it was God that held the rain and maintain my faith through it all can we praise him this morning Hallelujah for what he has done amen hallelujah so we give God praise amen and I'm seeing the Great Value in it see and upkeeping things so it's it's not just about keeping things clean in that sense you know like or making something look nice aesthetically pleasing and so forth like that that's all good and fine you know you polish as brother brand say polish the hub caps polish the rims polish the body but what if the car isn't working that's not really the key idea of Maintenance that is just a a nice look uh a night a cool facade um but the real the real uh value in maintaining something is to make sure that all of the parts are working just right cuz even if it doesn't look awesome we need to get from point A to point B we have a destination that we're trying to get to and on the way to that destination we need to maintain and upkeep our position our possessions in order to get there you don't want to get there barely scraping by you want to get there on the right foot isn't that right amen you want to get there better than the when you left and God will help us to do that by his grace is not right so it's not about just making things look nice you know that's the initial thought I had in my mind when I was thinking about this and it's about making sure that things function well things are are working well in order to serve a particular purpose or function the function that it was meant to serve isn't that right and there's a certain level of care and attention that is embedded in that word to maintain am you know um so it's not just simply managing a process you manage a process you might delegate duties over see a task make sure things are done but in maintenance you actually suggest that the object was achieved not just that the objective was achieve but that we were able to get there safely amen that we were able to reduce risk that we were able to reduce wastage you know isn't that right that's good maintenance you know that's the benefit of of good maintenance you know if you don't maintain your car properly it'll break down you may get a good resale value for it uh you know the body rotten in because that is one of the first things that guys is checked for when they buying a secondhand car they ask have any rocking spots um is is is the shocks good you know uh did it get in an accident you know all these things are questions that they will ask when you're selling a car because it has to be properly maintained and the funny thing is um and I can say this cuz I sold a car recently that um the things you don't fix is the things that you will have to fix when it's time to sell it so you feel you're ducking the process by not fixing this and not fixing that but guess what it's going to creep up on you sooner or later because you want to get value for your sale and people not going to buy some something that they don't perceive is of good value because it has to be properly maintained so there's value in the maintenance there value in keeping something well having it not just looking nice but functioning and serving the purpose that it was meant to serve uh and we have a purpose this morning and we have something we're meant to do and God's going to keep us by his grace he's going to keep us in his love he's going to keep us and help us to move from strength to strength by possessing and maintaining this land as we go into it isn't that right so I'm just ling a background here you know and um so just recently I learned that the Panorama ship I don't know if you all remember it but that was a ship that used to sail um you know the inter island ferry thing back in the day I think that had purchased his ship in 1987 this government and that ship became so rundown I think by 2004 or so it was the deemed inoperable to function anymore no one could carry could be on the vessel it wasn't safe to be on the vessel by 2004 so that just gives you a picture of what kind of Maintenance was being done on such a vessel uh however recently I discovered that that vessel is currently carrying people from inter island Greece uh Ferry uh work and it's just so happened that when they all government sold the vessel I guess to Greece they renovated the ship now the ship has seating areas it has a barroom it has it has a restaurant it it serves people it has fully air conditioned uh it has a television it has a lobby area um it is in a way better condition than it ever was when it was here in 2004 um so that just goes to show that when something is in the right hands uh uh you see the value of the difference um upon the thing whoever is doing the maintenance um once they could put the right care and attention behind it it will look and it will feel like the person who is behind it that's why God takes his Shepherd business very seriously amen our precious brother deun ministered to us that on the convention isn't that right and when when the devil's got you oh you know when the devil's got some people they got that look on their face they all drawn down can't praise God they all messed up in their mind but when God is maintaining you you got a praise upon your lips you got a two-edged sword in your hand you have confidence to come boldly Before the Throne and ask of God concerning your family you understand your position as a priest of your home to make offerings for your family and say Lord I need you one more time because I can't do it on my own but because you are the one that's keeping me you are the one that's keeping my feet from falling you are the one that's keeping my household you are the one that's providing for my every need according to your riches in glory and I come to you because you're doing the maintaining and he is very good at what he does uh he doesn't do a halfway job he does a complete job we can be halfway uh but God isn't halfway and we certainly appreciate God for that today isn't that right amen amen amen so in heaven everything is fixed right in heaven everything is in a permanent state so if someone were to die and pass on from this life there is no more opportunity for change isn't that right which means that in this Earthly realm we are presented this morning with the opportunity for change is that right that's what we're here this morning to do to find out how we can change and change for the better uh at least that's what I think we have in our hearts this morning because you can change either for the better or for the worst when you come into the present of God and so we don't want to be drawn away from him this morning but we want to be drawn more closer to him this morning as we near the pyramid and as we uh uh Feast on his word we ought to be reflecting the one who's doing the maintenance work the one who's keeping us and and helping us along the way is now right and then when that happens your life becomes a testimony of the man that's doing the work your life becomes a reflection you become God's portfolio because whenever you question whether God can do the job or not God should be able to point at you and say look here's my son here's my daughter here's my spirit flowing freely here's one I can put my hand on here's one I can use in 2025 coming oh Hallelujah they've got my word and they are willing to perform it one little none from God and away we go because we want these virtues in Us by the grace of God Amen to do the will of God isn't that right so being here this morning we are presented with the opportunity for change in an Ever Changing ever evolving landscape of Life a a landscape that is constantly shifting change is happening constantly around us and the way life was 20 years ago is not the same as it was today isn't that right the way people communicate just 20 years ago 2004 to now look at how much things have changed look at how rapid the technology has become it would just been a May thought for us to think of self-driving cars and all these things but it's a reality today artificial intelligence and all these technologies have made certain things a reality today that was not a reality just 20 years ago and so it's constantly changing so we have to keep up with all these changes or we will end up getting left behind isn't that right and it means that in this atmosphere this realm that we live in you don't have to maintain things in heaven everything is in a perfect state but here where we live here now we have to maintain the things that we possess and develop a key sense of responsibility for the things that are important or we will actually find ourselves one day wasting away and life will end up leaving us behind because we have not kept up with the race isn't that right hallelujah praise God and the Bible says if you can't run with the footman if you run with a footman and and and they wey you then how are you going to keep up with horses isn't that right you have to be able to keep up with the pace of life and the way it's moving and God by his grace will give us the strength to do that the prophet talk about moving from the horse and buggy to the automobile moving from the automobile to the airplane and to the astronaut age and he said the Church of God ought to be advancing and progressing and getting better but some of us are loling some of us are are dazing around some of us are saying the Lord delay his coming and are doing other things or finding other things to do rather than being diligent about about maintaining the things that God had given us in our hands to to to deal with isn't that right if we don't take a bath you will find yourself dirty one day CU you need to maintain yourself you need to cut your nails you need to do basic things isn't that right that's because in this realm we live in there's a value behind maintaining things the Bible speaks of uh possessing the land of your inheritance right so we talking about possession and maintain amen uh right so in Genesis 22 he says and and he said by myself have I sworn say the Lord for because thou has done this thing this is God speaking to Abraham after he had offered up his son Isaac he said be for because thou has done this thing and have not withheld thy son thine only son that in blessing I Will Bless thee and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and as the sand which is upon the seashore and thy seed shall possess the Gate of his enemies and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou Hast obeyed my voice oh Hallelujah so right there God pronounced the blessing the power of possession that's right upon the seed of God upon the Seed of Abraham that was to come forth from generation to generation God had pronounced a blessing of possession upon every seed and today we believe that we are the Royal Seed of Abraham we have been connected to This Promise through the shed blood of Jesus Christ which means you and I here this morning have an opportunity to have this same possession this same Hallelujah the same spirit that raised Christ from the dead is promised to come upon you and just like he conquered you also will conquer and just like he possessed you also will possess your individual inheritance whatever God has for you you are going to possess it because that's the promise that has been pronounced upon every seed of God in here this morning do you believe it oh the devil would have you to be ignorant of that oh but we are not ignorant of the Satan and his devices this morning we come to preach knowledge we come to preach truth we come to preach Revelation that God has given us the power this morning to possess our inheritance to possess what belongs to us to possess what rightfully belongs to us this morning every healing belongs to you this morning your deliverance your breakthrough the baptism of the Holy Ghost uh and Fire reviv rival in the church belongs to you this morning it is yours for a possession can we praise him oh hallelujah oh I'm so happy about that oh hallelujah hallelujah he died didn't he die but when he rose again Victorious he didn't just rise to save me but he rose to put my to take the name on my on the book amen and to give me an inheritance according to what is written in there amen amen there's an inheritance connected to your name amen amen isn't that right so God wants us to possess the land isn't that right I believe he also wants us to maintain it God give us the landu but we have to fight for it amen we have to fight for the land it's not good enough to say God has given us a land but what are we doing about what he has pronounced over us what his word has already declared we have to now do something for something to happen in these last days do you believe it and that fight can be broken down into two phases possess and maintain first we fight to possess then we fight to maintain what we have possessed isn't that right and little by little you will make progress as you progress into this into this war tactic so what we're talking about here now is kind of like a strategy for Success so the more you get in there is you cut down land and you maintain it and keep it and he that is faithful in little will be faithful in much because little by little little is the secret embedded in the v the victory is embedded in that secret of little by little isn't that right when an army goes into battle they are fighting for territory they are fighting for a space they are fighting they are fighting they are Waring factions heading against each other but they are fighting to capture the flag they are fighting to capture the city am this is The Benchmark for their Victory that's right this is what they're setting up as We Know we've progressed and advanced when we're able to capture the land capture the city but what good would it do an army if they go in and possess the land and don't maintain it they will lose it just as fast as they got it if they don't have a strategy to maintain what they have possessed as soon as they possess a territory they have to set up an outpost set up a watchtower set up a fence set up guards because the enemy is not going to take it lying down they are currently regrouping themselves to launch an attack to get back what they think is theirs and so it's a constant battle back and forth between War space and territory and infiltration it's a constant moving shifting landscape and you have to keep up with it so that's why when you possess set up a watchtower set up an outpost fence your area and make sure the enemy does not come back and if he did does drive them out because this land belongs to us and we are well able to take the land that God had promised us in the last days hallelujah if you lost your joy get it back and when you get it back maintain it put a mind field around it and say Satan I dare you to cross that line I'll chop you your head off hallelujah mean business with the Enemy hallelujah hallelujah and keep what you have possessed hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah as a man does in his heart so is he and if you believe that that land belongs to you if you believe this morning that healing belongs to you that Deliverance belongs to you that breakthrough belongs to you not only you but your family but your husband but your wife but your children but your finances but your business but your job but your community whatever you want ask what they want in my name and it shall be given if you believe this morning oh then you can possess [Music] it and you can maintain it and keep it isn't that right Jesus said he that loveth his life in this world shall lose it but he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it until life eternal isn't that right isn't that right it means you're building your hopes on things Eternal and if that is what you maintain then you are here what you are somewhere else so when you get there you get to keep what you've maintained you get to keep your blessing keep your Holy Ghost keep your inheritance you get to keep your virtues because you've built on a foundation of Jesus Christ isn't that right oh my that's wonderful so it's a it's possible so it is possible to maintain something and not possess it I want us to just entertain that thought for two seconds it is possible to maintain something and it's not yours this is like in the case of Moses when he was taking care of jetro's flock uh it wasn't his flock they might have been well taken care of um but it wasn't his uh he couldn't leave with the flock when he went down to Egypt you had to leave that behind and you had to follow and pursue after God's purpose isn't that right isn't that right and uh uh uh isn't that right and and likewise even the children of Israel at that time found themselves building a city building Egypt Brick by Brick slave by slave whip by Whip and yet they didn't own any of it they couldn't they couldn't lay claim to Egypt it wasn't their land they were just sojourning through there uh but God had a place for them and that's why God wanted to take them out of that place because the work that they were doing wasn't for them it was for somebody else but God wanted them to have their own amen their own Nation their own crops their own successes their own victories their own battles their own failur their own trials isn't that right you want to bring them to a place of enlargement that would require some level of maturity and pain but it will help them to grow and get better and come into their own God likes that kind of Independence thing where he can say here's my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased hear ye him this is what he had in the Garden of Eden when he had Adam he had someone he could turn his back on and know that things are being maintained things are running well uh and that he could catch a report in the evening and Adam would say I I fixed this I I moved that because I felt it was more efficient that way and he would say Well done my son uh you have done well in the Garden today lay down and rest because I am pleased with your work I am pleased with your progress and that's the kind of thing God likes so sweltering down there in Egypt apart from them being under cruel task Masters part of the issue with God is that they were not in their own place uh they were not in their own space in their own land where they could really truly see the hand of God and claim their own victories and their own possession isn't that right amen amen so so so it gave great joy to God to pull his people out of that condition and to bring that into his land a land of promise isn't that right oh my so it's possible to uh to possess something now it's possible to possess something and not maintain it here's the other flip side so you can maintain something and not possess it you could also possess something and not maintain it it's possible to own something and not upkeep it bit am isn't that right talked about uh you see an abandoned house sometimes it's so sad you walk by and you see a house that is uh there's no one living in it and you could tell because it looks like just a warped relic of its former glorious State now it is wilting away uh the floor is not swept the cobwebs are taken over uh the leaves are all in the front porch and there's no one there to sweep and to make sure this house looks in a condition it's almost like the soul of the house is gone because there are no occupants in the house and it's just abandoned and it just looks run down because no one is maintaining this possession it probably has good potential maybe the foundation is solid the wall structures might be well built the windows are are really good uh solid uh a framework the roof might be in a wonderful condition but it just doesn't look like what it ought to because there's no one keeping it looking good uh keeping the pipes running well making sure the electricals in the house are working no one is in it doing that and so it's almost like the soul of the house is just gone from it and it's in darkness while everyone else is in light uh because of its condition sometimes people end up in this kind of a condition because they don't maintain their faith they don't maintain the blessings of God if you are praying every day and you are reading your Bible then is impossible for the light of God to go out of your life moreover the light of God will begin to increase in your life if you are feasting on the word hallelujah then the blessings of God will be seen upon you because God has something he could work through and he can work through his word he can work through prayer prayer changes things it changes us it changes situations isn't that right and so it's all about upkeep you see uh so it's possible to have a possession and it not being properly maintained isn't that right so God wants us to exercise fate you believe that faith not only to possess but also to maintain or keep your position of victory until the next battle because it doesn't stop there you have to keep fighting there is much more land to be possessed so do not be slack concerning your promise as some men count slackness our God is Not slack oh so therefore we will arise this morning and we will possess and maintain what we have possessed until the coming of the Lord can you believe it amen hallelujah from next battle to next battle we keep fighting until he come we keep fighting until he comes amen hallelujah isn't that right one time they told an army you have to hold here you have to hold the line because we're going to send for reinforcements but at the dawn of the light we will be there we we promise to be there but you have to hold it down you have to keep the enemies off the gates hard battle all night long they're fighting they're fighting praise God hallelujah but they have to hold the line they have to hold the fort they have to maintain what they have possessed they can't let the gates be breached so every man to his post every man to the gate barricade the doors get rocks get trees get Stones if you have to but keep the enemy off until our Lord comes and brings his deliverance we going to stay here on the battlefield until he come oh Hallelujah don't give the enemy an inch oh bring your Shields oh the shields of the earth belong unto our God make line with those Shields don't let him come through amen amen amen hallelujah sometimes that's what you have to do God will bring his Deliverance you have to do the maintaining part Keeping the Faith God give you a promise God told Abraham you're going to have a son he had to maintain that fate for 25 years un believing no evidence no stray of Lights to to show that there would be a son all he had was a word from God a god promise and he had to maintain that promise year in year out 2022 2023 2024 he had to maintain his faith until God promised Revival until God promised Dynamics pours out upon them they had to maintain their faith oh is that what we're doing here this morning oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory god spoke to Simeon you're going to see the Lord's Christ you shall not see death what did he do he maintained that faith I'm not going to die until I see the Lord's Christ year in year out he didn't know what was going to happen he kept getting older but one day God come down one day that Messiah was born and the thing that he was waiting for come to pass isn't that right oh my soam says here on fate so in the big campaigns we try to get that in and he said in my tent I'm going to try to do it myself in the afternoon service give the instructions of how to approach how to maintain your healing just as much to know how to maintain it as it is to receive it Prophet saying this here and I this is wonderful so the same Faith you have to receive your healing is the same Faith you have to exercise and use to maintain the healing that you receive or it is very possible the devil will run in and take it away from you because he doesn't want you to be healed the war doesn't end when you get the healing the war now start oh but you have to keep it and stay with that word that he gave you until you see the Fulfillment the fullness of what he has said and spoken isn't that right over your life so I see it as a strategy to overcome possess and maintain and I hope you see it too Amen to increase in the stature of God see the stature of a perfect man not only to possess but to maintain and upkeep what you have possessed in order to grow from Victory to Victory Exodus 23 tells us that God could not give us the could give us the land in one year he could cuz that's what the that's what the that's what the scripture said right what we read just now it said that God could give us the land in one year if he were to do so the land would become desolate let's read that back Exodus 23:29 says I will not drive them out from before thee in one year right right lest the land become desolate and the beasts of the field multiply against thee in other words he could give you the whole thing on a silver platter but he knows that it will overwhelm you because it is too much you can't eat all that on that plate by yourself it's too much it it will it will overwhelm you you're not at the State of Mind a maturity to handle that kind of blessing so sometimes you have to work with your little by little so that you could gain confidence in yourself in knowing and practicing the word of God so that you could get Victory out of Victory so that you can enlarge your mind to the blessing he has for you because no eye has seen or no ears have heard what God has in store for us God has something really wonderful but he he's got to train you for it he's got to get you ready for it I heard a preacher say one time he said if a they put a a small man in a big place what usually happens is that small man will break that big place down to how small he is but if you put a big man in a small place he going to build that place up into how big he is it has to do with your mindset if you're thinking too small you're going to do things in a in a Pity in a in a Pity way isn't that right God have to enlarge your mind and increase your borders little by little so that as you grow the things around you benefit as well the people and the things connected to you benefit from that growth because you're in a place of influence where God could use your life uh not only bless itself but to bless others to help others along the way that's the point of Christianity isn't it uh eternal life is living for others isn't that right okay interesting that he says now the Beast of the field would multiply against thee that's interesting it means the Beast of the field now thees of field we know it could be used for many things right so meat for food skin for clothing Hooves horns and other parts could be used as useful things so for instance the chauffeur that they blew as a horn was actually a Ram's Horn isn't that right it's what they use for a trumpet so the beasts of the field represent uh things that useful things that could be used but God is saying that this could actually become the kind of situation where it could be come too much for you in other words that what God left in the land for you for a blessing could actually turn against you if you don't know how to maintain what God has blessed you with in other words you could stand to lose the things that you do not maintain that's right I'll say that again just so it don't fly over your head you stand to lose the things that you do not maintain and this is where brother ID would always say time and time again he say you know how we he would pray that God would not give him more than he could effectively manage or handle I'm sure you heard him say that once yeah amen and it's so true and uh and this is what we want see uh we don't want to as they saying goes bite off more than we could chew is that right but we want to be able to manage effectively uh you know and just like brother brought out and I'm drawing some reference from the Wednesday night service amen we're talk about that temporary Ministry um and the the the the parable of the talents was tied into that you know and if you haven't listened to that service you should go back and listen to it because drawing from that you could see that uh he gave to every man according to his several ability God knows what you can handle he he doesn't give you more than you can bear he doesn't put you in a situation that he knows you can't manage the stress of it the the the trial of of it or the testing of it amen but he's growing you little by little so he give you just enough to build your muscles so that you could be ready for the next fight because the muscles you gain here is what you are going to need when you get there isn't that right and what you get there is going to take you there and so forth isn't that right Jesus learned obedience by the things he suffered and it took full obedience to go on the cross and die for us isn't that right the the testing was relevant to to the final outcome uh to what was needed and the final hour uh it wasn't just a relevant test or a spot quiz uh God is not random uh when he gives you a test he's preparing you for something that's coming up the road that's why this bride has to be tested on brotherly kindness Spirit of forgiveness Hallelujah we have to possess that and we have to maintain it because that Hallelujah that sweet Spirit praise God is what charity is going to come down on and we have to catch that stone hallelujah hallelujah and God's going to raise up a people in the land who under their Messenger will be the final voice to the final age who will finally strike Revelation 2217 let the spirit and the bride say come how you going to come if you don't strike brotherly kindness if you don't find that lost coin how you going to strike it hallu you got to have place in Christ got to have holy decency am got to have Brotherly Love in there then you can call to the other members come and rejoice with us because we found something we have recovered something that was once lost isn't that right oh wonderful now we at Luke 15 amen praise God God is leading well talking about the woman of the Lost coin we're already there either what woman brother uh Jesus said in the scripture what woman having 10 pieces of silver if she lose one piece do not light a candle and sweep the house and and seek diligently until she find it and when she had found it she cth her friends and her neighbors together saying come re Rejoice with me for I have found the peace which was lost isn't that right and this is an interesting story that the Lord gives because here's a situation with a woman who has this as the prophet described it a sacred headdress or sacred headpiece with which there are 10 tablets or pieces or coins in them that represent her virtues uh her marital vows and so forth like that are embedded within the address and and it's interesting because she if this was so valuable she was supposed to guard this thing uh she was supposed to keep this possession safe she was supposed to keep this in a safe place but I guess through the course of time sometimes we lose things sometimes we lose our keys or we misplace our watch or we misplace our glasses but but this was a thing of great possession this ought to have been kept with a certain level of diligence but somehow along the way she was not diligent about this possession and only to realize that a coin was missing and her husband was returning now her husband wasn't the one responsible for moving the coins that's right a higher up in her community could have done it a priest or someone who found her in in a in a in a compromised position uh could have removed the coin she how is she going to explain how this coin has been lost uh she would end up in a predicament and it is because she was not diligent in keeping her possession in a safe place she misplaced it somehow but she had to go find it what woman having 10 piece of Sila if she lose one that she do light a candle so this morning if you have lost something or if you lost your joy you you lost your peace you lost that sweet Breeze of the spirit oh you have to find it this morning you have to be diligent about the possessions about the things that God have give you if you had a victory at the altar if God pour out his Spirit upon you you have to fight to keep that the fight is not over when you walk away from the altar no no no the fight is only just begun because Monday morning is coming work is coming bills is coming the cares of life is coming to try to choke that seed you've got to maintain your borders this morning and keep on praising him keep on worshiping him keep on creating an atmosphere around you in your home in your life stay with the word read the word pray every day oh Hallelujah and maintain your blessing until the next battle that's what we do amen hallelujah oh my so it's an interesting story and I found that there's a there's a element of of of a failure here and brother brandham says that uh you know the church is loling you know uh they're gazing around they they they they haven't they not lost their focus heing unto them teachers and so forth like that when we ought to be growing and getting stronger we ought to be way up the road by now with all that has been revealed to us uh because to whom much is given much is expected and when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth amen isn't that right we have to be able to answer that call when the son of man comes and say yes I have faith isn't that right seven tunders give faith for Rapture in Grace isn't that right amen you see so something she failed to do right now she had to use so maintenance is like the consistency part of your life you know there are moments of intensity but then there are moments of consistency where you have to keep doing the right thing every day in order to progress you don't want to wait for intensity this woman who lost her piece of silver she had to use intensity to get back what she lost it was an urgent matter it was the house on fire kind of situation she had to get into into adrenaline mode to recover herself to recover what was lost before the evening Shadows Fall there are moments like that in life but if we maintain what we have there'll be less moments of intensity for us we could actually uh H come into our own and begin to get used to being in that presence with God for God Walking with God until it becomes second nature to us until it's not strange for us to say let me talk it over with Jesus before I make this situation before I make this Choice let me just come aside for 2 minutes I want to do something but I don't want to do it without him I want to know that he's with me Lord I'm about to buy this I'm about to do that Lord just for two minutes I want to ask you a question just like David he would inquire of the Lord uh Lord is it okay to pursue or should I hold a fort should I stay here or should I go what should I do the prophet said that bride when she gets to that place she will have thus sayth the Lord or keep still which means you come into a position oh somebody help me you come into a lifestyle of Holiness where you are walking with God so much until you don't feel comfortable making a choice unless he is with you in the trial in the Tempest in the storm he is with you he said I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you it's got to become a practicing of the presence of God every day just the other day before Christmas I was going to do something and I said Lord I just I'm going to do this thing I just want to know if it's all right Hallelujah just want to know if it's all right I come away from the from the cashier from where I was I said Lord help me to know that this is the decision you want me to make and I feel it's so important with do that CU a lot of times we feel so confident in maybe our ability or the things that we have that we lose sight of the fact that we belong to God we have to give an account to God we ought to take inventory at times um when we are making a decision sometimes you might call your wife or call your husband but make sure and call God too make sure you have enough credit on your phone to give your father a call uh before before you take the next step cuz the next step could be it could be here or there in this life is like that you know just the other day I had skin rashes all over my skin I didn't look like what I did a week ago I said look how unpredictable life is one moment you're in this state and then it could all change just like that you have to walk with God you've got to know that he's with you and he's helping you make these decisions cuz it could be your last right you don't know see so you just want to be know that he's he's there amen okay so in that same luke5 it talks about the woman of lost coin he also talks about a prodigal son he said a certain man had two sons the younger of them said to his father father give me a portion of the goods that fth to me and he divided it unto them his living the Bible distinguishes this son as the younger of the two the younger son said to him give me the portion that fall to me give me my inheritance I want what is mine and I think it's interesting that he distinguished the younger son because this youth usually tends to uh lean towards the idea that he is not experienced enough that he hasn't seen enough of life yet that he hasn't learned enough um of how to maintain certain things of how to get from strength to strength how to grow his assets or whatever it is he was the younger of the two sons so he didn't really have all that he didn't go to all of the school classes uh he hadn't yet reached form five he's still coming up there but yet he feels somehow in his mind that he was independent enough to say I want my inheritance no now I heard a preacher say one time that if you think you're independent and you have to ask your daddy for power to leave home then you're really not that independent uh because you needed your father's permission um to leave the house so you have to wonder what kind of Independence we talking about here um because when you're really independent you could you could make your own M choices you can move out when you want you have things to move with uh but he didn't have anything he he was moving with what his father gave him so it just shows the the the the sense of maturity here in this you see and so he asked for all of his inheritance and and and um okay let me skip on down here amen oh they love him this morning so not many days after the youngest son gathered all together took his journey into a far country as what the Bible says right in verse 13 Luke 15 and um and there wasted his substance with riotous living here it is that he got his possession but he ended up wasting it away because the principle of keep keeping the blessing maintaining it was not part of his plan of operation so he just wasted it away see he spent all that he had is so unfortunate he went off into a far country which means anywhere that the father was not that is where he was pitching his tent some people because they want to do their thing they pitch their tent up far away from the father far away from the word far away from the presence of God as possible because they clearly their intention is to is to do what they want you see um uh once you get but you see uh once you get far enough now you're on your own you see you become vulnerable become open to the attack isn't that right and as life would have it the Bible said there was a famine in the land and the son uh saw the power of money The Treasure of The Inheritance would give him he saw the power in that but what he didn't see was the famine coming that's right to waste down what he thought was so great to possess uh there was famine coming so sometimes you have a possession uh but the test is coming the trial is coming and it takes a wisdom of God to put things in place so that when the famine comes when the storm comes or the floods of Life come to waste to hit to attack at your possession you've got something to hold rains you have to have some investment some return on your investment to keep the thing moving forward or at some point you come to a dead stop you come to a halt isn't that right amen so as life would have it a famine came and it wasted down his his his substance see and see he didn't see what the effect of that would have on the substance and that he didn't make wise Investments and the famine cut off all his income streams leaving him with nothing with which to reinvest and the young man came to himself this is the Glorious part of the scripture and we thank God for this amen that sometimes we make mistakes sometimes we go off to a far place in our minds and tell ourselves we can do it and we go off in the might of our own power we need to realize that we are leading ourselves and when we lead ourselves things usually go Haywire things usually go wrong the prophet thought he could lead himself when was lost in the forest and said I'm a Tracker I'm a ranger I know the the ins and outs I'm familiar with the trees I know how to get around yet all the while he was trying to lead himself and kept going around in circles and it is only when he stop and realize his condition that's when God was able to touch him on the shoulder and let him know that you might not be as good as you think you are you don't have all the answers you think you have and you need a savior you need a guide and we all need a guide this morning because no one man or woman has all the answers to life but in this Bible has every answer to every question that you will ever face in this world or world to come hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to God so we ought to acknowledge our wrong thank you Lord acknowledge the fact that we we can't do it on our own and yield to God and he brings the circumstances one on top the other Until It Breaks you until you realize that you need Jesus he's going to continue to push you into a corner until you realize you have to surrender it is just too much for you when the children of Israel began to cry out unto the Lord their task Masters had increased increase increase increase the weapons and God let it go on because what he's waiting for is a cry fact of the matter is you haven't seen your deliverance yet because you ain't cried enough yet God wants his believing children to cry out unto him and when he hears the cries of his people then he's compelled to do something about your situation and until you allow your Foolish Pride to be cast down to be ripped down then and only then will you hear from God God wants to tear you up God wants to rip it [Applause] down some of us are too intact some of us are too whole some of us are too Hallelujah polished up we need to be broken like porcelain on the ground Hallelujah because he alone knows where every piece is and he could put you back together [Applause] again hallelujah amen and so you got to come to yourself at some point this young man did that he came to himself amen what a glorious hope the scripture gives he came to himself and began to talk to himself he began to talk to himself ask himself questions does my father's house have meat in it doesn't it have the fatted calf doesn't it have uh carpet a couch to sit on I'm sitting on a log near a pig pen eating corn husk I mean come on this is not what I'm meant for this is not what I'm accustomed to this is not what I know to be true I'm only accepting this reality because I'm too proud to admit that I'm not very good at doing this life thing and I need help in this department I need help in this Arena I'm getting licks I'm on the ropes I'm dying and I need assistance we've got to be willing to cry out for hell just like Peter come out into the boat he was following Jesus and he start to sink what' he do cried out for help the prophet said we have every right today as a Christian as a Believer if you ever found in in want if you ever found slipping you could cry out the same way that Peter did and say Lord Save Me Oh Hallelujah help me pull me up out of the situation I've got myself into and I believe he will do that for us this morning if we're willing to to to to cry out to him amen so he talked himself enough to arise and go back to his father's house and ask for forgiveness amen all right so the Lord says little by little I'll dve them out see that's our little strategy this morning we're talking about and um until th be increase and inheriting the land little by little you will possess the land to avoid wastage cuz it didn't want to overwhelm you right so you possess some you keep it paint the walls clean the shutters right cut the yard right now that that is in a good condition now you're in the rhythm of things we can now look to see what else is next for you uh and how to enlarge or increase your territory um and to come into what God has for you in the in the outcome isn't that right oh my and you will come into your own as you increase incrementally until you're able to effectively manage and maintain the land of possessions so we're talking about the pyramid right and we go up stage by stage you can't stay where we are we have to go on and possess possess and maintain and in the maintenance is testings is Trials because the devil will make you prove every inch of ground you claim to stand upon isn't that right so that's what the maintenance is for to make sure that you could prove that you're worthy of the possession that you got so if you got knowledge God's going to test you on knowledge to see if you really going to keep it or if you're going to give it away isn't that right but once you could keep it hold on to it then you're ready for temperance and if you can keep that then you're ready for patience and if you can maintain that then you're ready for godliness you're ready for brotherly kindness and that's how we grow and that's how we we mature isn't that right oh my that's what we want amenu so God gave them strategies to possess the land in the Book of Joshua right um for inheritance to divide it among the children of Israel to give each one their portion in order to maintain and to divide it among themselves to have their own yard and grass and that kind of thing you know wonderful and I love it because it's different strategies the way they conquered the aites was not the same way that they had to conquer the jebusites the way that they conquered the jebusites was not the same way that they conquered the parasites or or the amorites or the Hittites or the median ites it wasn't the same it was always a different strategy connected to it because it's a different thing you're going to possess it's on a higher level it requires more muscles it requires sharper tools better weapons requires Precision accuracy learn to control your breathing run through the troop stay the course how many horses we need how many men we need how to use resources oh hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right it's all strategy and there's a wisdom in the thing you know it's not just called wildly pelting stones and sticks God is not a wild man he's a gentleman he knocks on the door he he has a way an approach there's a thing he's trying to do an intent yes to every purpose he has you are God's purpose he had an intent for you what intent for you he has not for somebody else he give every man to each his own ability you've got abilities inside you this morning and God knows just how to get it out of you so he's going to pass you through a specific road so that you can be shaped a certain way cut a certain way honed a certain way to serve a certain position because you've got to fit in that pyramid that's right the way he wants you to fit so that the whole body could be joint packed together Hallelujah each joint supplying according to the effectual part of the whole body of the thing he knows he knows it we don't know that's why we have to surrender um to the Master Mason who is doing the shaping who is doing the cutting and making sure that we get to the destination isn't that right oh my so it's different strategies right each strategy is different because each enemy was different Jes and they required a different strategy in order to defeat them and possess he that is faithful in little be faithful in much the Bible also says he that is unjust in the least will also be unjust in much so the reverse is also true if you're faithful in little faithful in much if you're unjust in in little you be unjust in much which means here's the summary the lesson is in the little that's where the lesson is yes the lesson is actually in the little you could be faithful in little you could be unjust in little the rule will apply the same when you scale it up but the foundation bottom of it is in the little that you start off with isn't that right because if you could conquer when times are rough then surely you could prosper in times are plenty by applying the same principles but at a much larger scale you could actually scale up your principles that you learned in the rough time that's right to learn how to manage the better times when things is nice when the goose is hanging High uh you could you could handle that because you know how to to to run the the the the rugged sand training sometimes when they training thorough breed horses they run them through sand there's a lot of restriction on that kind of terrain but it builds their muscle form so when they come on a clean clear truck it's lightning speed because them tellers are used to the Restriction the restraint Hallelujah having to push through sand and difficult mud and terrain so when they get to the real racetrack it's all guns firing because they've been trained a certain way and their muscles are used to uh having to push past uh certain trials and testings and and rough terrain that's why God passes us through rough terrain oh little by little we learn and we get stronger little by little we learn how to overcome this trial overcome this test how to step over the dead bodies as it were and keep on moving forward 10,000 fall on my right side a thousand on my left but it shall not come n thee for Only With Thine Eyes th Shall Behold and see the reward of the wicked because thou has made the Lord thy habitation amen and amen apart from maintaining a possession you can also bring us out Point real quick we're running out of time uh but I thank you so much this morning um amen for your uh uh your Praises apart from maintaining a possession you could also maintain a position right let's bring this up real quick Jesus said um uh Jesus Christ same yesterday and today and forever sorry uh brother brandham says here on Jesus Christ same yesterday today and forever he said and firmly being a fundamentalist who believes God's Eternal Word believing that everything that God has written is part of himself self he said I believe the scripture says in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God so therefore the word is part of God so he's differentiating this here now the word and God is the same the word is part of God if we will approach it like that approach his word like we are actually approaching him the person right for no man is any better than his word is see a man and his word is the same so if you couldn't take your if I couldn't take your word I wouldn't believe you for anything same you should by me and Prophet said that's the way I would do it by God if God made a promise and if he is almighty God he must stay by his promise in order to maintain his position as almighty God so by so by keeping his promise is how God maintains his position as Lord God if he said something he will keep it that's how he Main maintains his position if we promise to deliver you he will deliver you that's how he maintains his position he will always be gone because he has the ability to keep his own word to maintain what he has said and to keep and watch over his word to make sure it fulfilled and to perform it in its due time isn't that right he cannot make a promise and then take it back I can make a promise and have it take back the prophet said you will make a promise promise and have to take it back because we are men and we're finite but he is infinite God cannot get wiser smarter he was perfect to begin with and when God makes a statement it is perfect isn't that right so God has a position that he has to maintain and his position as God being God by keeping his word keeping his promises isn't that right and we have a position to maintain also this morning isn't that right as Sons and Daughters of God to possess and to maintain our position as Sons and Daughters of God isn't that right we have something to do too as well isn't that right we have to pray we have to call on God we have to get out the strange Idols we have to clean up our lives we have to light a candle we have to sweep diligently we have to do what we have to do isn't that right in order to maintain our position as Sons and Daughters of God God when we come into this building to worship we are maintaining our position when we come and we shout and we lift our hands we are letting the devil know I'm maintaining my position in the house of God as a Son of God as a daughter of God I'm here to praise him I'm here to lift my hands I'm here to let the devil know that despite the trial despite the test I'm maintain in my stand having done all to stand stand therefore and maintain your position this morning oh until he come maintain the fight Amen to maintain actually means to fight to earnestly contend for it in order to maintain or keep it in other words you had to fight to get it and now you have to fight to keep it isn't that right it's a fight all the way it's just a different kind of fight the first fight was intense possess you get it Capture the Flag cut away the enemy but in the Second Battle it's an endurance battle it's in the ins and the outs it's in replenishing the consumables it's in making sure that things are working things are functioning and then every day you're doing a little that that goes that adds up to a lot amen and you're cutting down some to add increase to your border and territory what God has for you little by little amen oh my so uh so see so they are fighting to possess the land and they believe that is their own isn't that right and all war this morning is a Holy Ghost Land of promises that we are trying to occupy it's a holy war of occupation and the contract is in The Souls of our feet that's where the contract is at isn't that right wherever The Souls of feet shall tread upon that have I given unto you the Bible says according to Joshua 1 and if God be with us this morning then we are more than able to possess the land that God had given us us and divide the land for an inheritance and to maintain our possession but abam speaks here he says so many says of the Lord will take this evil spirit from me from drinking from gambling or from lying or stealing I'll serve him but he said that's up to you see you've got to do something too they that overcome shall inherit all things they that overcome you shall have power to do it but you must be willing to lay it down see she made herself ready I like that word he said you see God couldn't push us through a little pipe pull us out on the other end and then say blessed is he that overcome it you had nothing to overcome he just pushed you through but you've got to make decisions for yourself God give you that to do you've got to choose and you've got to be willing to lay it down say Lord help me make the right choice I I want to know your will isn't that right see I have to make decision for myself the prophet said and in doing that we show our faith and respects to God Abraham was a promised child uh was promised a child sorry Abraham was promised a child but he must maintain the promise for 25 years Prophet said the ups and downs that he had the Temptations and in those 25 years but he held to the Word of Promise isn't that right oh my praise God hallelujah do you love him today amen's get trouble amen Oh Glory to God all right amen they love him this morning praise God just give him some praises amen okay wonderful see Israel has promised a Promised Land but they had to fight for every inch of it uh whatever The Souls of your foot shall tread upon that have I given unto you said Joshua and it was all there see the land was there God give it to them but they must fight for it isn't that right okay I'm winding down now musician can get ready to come the same way it is about Divine Healing God has got the power to heal you but is if you got the courage to accept it but you'll have to fight every inch of the way God has got Amazing Grace to save you and he will do it but you have to fight every inch of your way he said I've been behind the pulpit going on 31 years and every inch of that has been a fight constantly it certainly was but we must fight he said if we must reain and so we find out that the bride has to make herself ready you've got to make yourself ready because your bridegroom is coming and you've got to have your wedding garment on this morning isn't that right we've got to make ourselves ready we willing to lay aside every weight that does so easily beset us that we might run with patience the race that's set before us that we must lay them aside ourselves and we can't say God you come and lay them aside for us we've got to do that ourselves he said and now I want to see this place before audience and so forth God is still the same as he ever on he Remains the Same isn't that right he said he's always the same it's the people that get away from God but not God from the people he said they lose their faith F but God covers all space everywhere he's omnipresent you see and he's always be will be everywhere he said but it's the attitude of the people that brings the results and that's the reason at Pentecost that they had to go into an upper room and pray until the Holy Ghost come they got in one place and in one Accord it's the atmosphere what brings the results he said you believe that let every man and woman in this building this morning boy or girl get everything from their minds but the Lord Jesus and believe that he's standing present right now and you'll see something happening that'll cause headlines in the newspaper in the morning that's right he said it's the atmosphere he said Divine Healing sanctification and the powers of God is as long as your faith lasts in it here's a part we get to and we Christi do as long as your faith lasts in it so you've got to maintain your faith God give you a healing God give you a Deliverance God give you a victory it lasts as long as your faith lasts in it he said and when your faith fails then your experience is gone oh no wonder God told Peter I pray for you why that your faith fail not so that your faith could remain in the Blessed holy word isn't that right and upkeep your deliverance and maintain your position I pray that your faith fail not isn't that right oh my then your experience is gone see if your faith fails it's based that way simply upon the finished works of Christ at Calvary he said you're Sanctified as long as your testimony is right as long as you live a Sanctified life and believe that God Sanctified you you're Sanctified counting it all to his grace and his merits as long as you've accepted your healing believe your healing you go on believing like that you'll be as healed as long as you believe it isn't that right Hallelujah glory to God amen amen amen I'm almost finished you can begin to play something Softly amen he says here now God wants to bless us in order to do that he has to train Us in Little Things isn't that right this man said if your they believe you to be a prophet why don't you teach them how to receive spiritual gifts and how to do things for God why don't you teach them things like that if you're a prophet the prophet said how can I teach them algebra when they won't even learn their ABCs he said you know what ABC means always believe Christ uh-huh how you going to do that see you you want to get way up there instead of starting down here he said God will build his church upon the foundation of Jesus Christ and that's the Bible outside of that all other grounds is sinking Sands God doesn't change and his nature doesn't change isn't that right amen amen amen first Peter one says the trial of your faith being much more precious than gold and that perisheth though it be tried with fire might be found unto the praise and honor and Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ isn't that right so the lesson is in a little this morning God will test you as brother spoke about uh that Wednesday night with a temporary position things that he give you in a temporary way to bless you with that you have to maintain that and stay with God's word and show that you're fully prepared to hold that line when Elijah caught Elisha he was plowing at the he was at the plow the prophet said he knew how to keep a straight line and that's the kind of man God put chose to put his mantle upon to put his anointing upon because he had learned something in a little that was going to take him all the way to bethl to gilgal to the school of the prophets he knew how to kept that line and stay with God and say I want that kind of blessing isn't that right Christ did the work of a carpenter I'm finishing up amen during his years of Silence he was baptized by John in the river but 18 years of Silence he was a carpenter every day he came and opened up the shop set out the tables and chairs did his work with the best of his ability no one knew about him but he was just doing his part god training him in the little there was a mighty Ministry that he had to perform carpentry wasn't even closely related to what he had to do but he did his best with the little that God gave him until he was ready for his change of season isn't that right but AB Brandon's Ministry was a temporary Ministry isn't that right God told him youall do the work of an evangelist isn't that right he said that he said do the work of evangelist he said he didn't say you was an evangelist Prophet said but he said do the work of one and the prophet said on the sign of the end he said perhaps until the time come for something else another change of work might be something different he says I don't know isn't that right we know God made him a major prophet isn't that right he stepped into his office 1963 Angels come down from heaven to declare a new season isn't that right praise God and we are all this morning doing a temporary work until we are positionally placed according to D God's Dynamic power release which we believe will positionally place the Church of God in the last days do they believe that oh my you begin me to stand I want wanted just read this one quote from the statue of a perfect man which says lust for money lust for big things Lust For popularity these things are dead to the believer we
