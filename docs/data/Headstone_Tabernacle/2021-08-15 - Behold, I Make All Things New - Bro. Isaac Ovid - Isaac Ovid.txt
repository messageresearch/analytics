can't even compare to the love you have for us lord because you loved us when we were at our lowest moment and we didn't know who we were in you and we were blind and wretched and miserable and naked and we didn't even know it but lord your love cut through eternity into time to find us lord and your word arrested our souls and even though we are still going through a process of transformation we are here at our post of duty this morning lord about our father's business looking to hear lord a direct word from you a direct word lord of encouragement we thank you for the presence that we feel we thank you for the anointing that's in this place we thank you for your servant brother stephen lord and lord for yielding himself to the holy spirit the atmosphere is right lord we thank you for brother gideon behind the piano and lord with the shame and with the timothy behind the technical team this group here lord as we gather you said where there are two or three gathered in your name lord there you are in the midst we know you are here and we pray there god that you would visit each one in their homes where they may be this morning me the shekinah glory the presence of the angel of the lord dropped into living rooms right now dropped into homes right now really clear holy ground we declare a space for god to move in lord we forget about our distractions we forget about the interruptions we forget the fact that we are at home we are caught up this morning in your presence lord may you bless the service this morning what will be said and done lord may you take me out of the way and speak to your hungry children your needy children i'm hungry i'm needy lord may you lord take words lord and speak through me father use me as your instrument your microphone this morning so their lives could be changed and transformed may you break shackles and break chains satan the blood of jesus is against you this morning so father we commit the service into your hands in the precious theme of jesus christ and the church says amen amen and amen and amen may you give the lord a hand of praise where you are right now welcome the holy spirit in your home welcome the holy spirit where you are at this morning amen so certainly a great privilege and an honor to be in the house of the lord and to be able to speak to the purchased of the blood of jesus christ certainly loved the lord this morning and we've seen so many things happening and we are so grateful for his grace and his mercy to us before i get into the service this morning somewhat short notice i asked a technical team to put together us a song just to play for the church uh we didn't have enough time to get it on the video but uh pray will be a blessing to you this morning god bless you brother shane [Music] thank you jesus know what it's like to be in the presence of the lord and not know what time it is because time stood still and bodies were healed and families restored because we stayed here

is i oh jesus oh jesus i want more little voices lord yes i want more this morning hallelujah amen you appreciate that special this morning amen blessed be the name of the lord and i pray that's your burden that's your prayer this morning that you want more from the lord really when you appreciate the team i also want to specially thank brother ian paul francis as well for helping from at home to get that song to us i felt ashaburden to have that song played this morning so if you have your bibles this morning would you tune with me to two portions of scripture i certainly want to salute our pastor but ovid and certainly want to thank uh him for the opportunity to speak to the church this morning so reading from second corinthians uh chapter five and reading from revelation 21 this morning second corinthians 5 and reading just one verse 17 and therefore if any man be in christ he is a new creature all things are passed away behold all things are become new i want to read it one more time therefore if any man be in christ he is a new creature all things are passed away behold all things all things not some things but all things are become new and reading from the book of revelation 21 a reading from verse one revelation 21 reading from verse one and i saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away and there was no more sea and i john saw the holy city knew jerusalem coming down from god out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband so not only did john see the holy city the new jerusalem coming down from god out of heaven but he saw how it was prepared not just how it was prepared but the way it was prepared john describes it as prepared as a bride adorned for her husband in other words very precise very careful very intentional preparation verse 3 and i heard a great voice out of heaven saying behold the tabernacle of god is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and god himself shall be with them and be their god and god shall wipe away all tears from the eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away and he that sat upon the throne said behold i make all things new and he said unto them right for these words are true and faithful in other words make sure and take note of this you could rest your faith on this you could rest your hope on this for these words are true and faithful and he said unto me it is done i am alpha and omega the beginning and the end i will give unto him that is a fist of the fountain of the water of life freely he that overcometh shall inherit all things and i will be his god and he shall be my son may the lord add a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated this morning in the presence of the lord wherever you are this morning i don't think we'll ever get used to preaching to empty benches but i believe in my heart that we are connected by that invisible bond that bond from our invisible father our heavenly father and we are connected in fate and connected around the promised word of god this morning so i have a title this morning behold i make all things new behold i make all things new and for a subject the journey of the overcomers and an inspiration he that overcometh shall inherit all things so we're under expectation this morning for the time that we are here to hear a word from the lord and that we can kind of grow in the presence of the lord and in the spirit of the lord and i'm on the expectation friends for a new thing for a new walk for new talk for a new place for a new experience as that song we heard said i want more i'm not satisfied with what i have seen i'm not satisfied with just my experience i'm not satisfied with where i'm at i want more and this promise is scripture we read and we just read speaks of a new thing a new experience can the church say amen so just to lay an introduction before i get into the message from the message as i was with moses with iran i'm in the early part of his ministry he was speaking here he said i've kind of got to a place where i want to get more boldness is there anybody who feels that way this morning they want to get more boldness we see all these things happening around us but we need to get not less boldness we need not to get more fear we need to get more boldness but ibrahim said i want to take the initiative side regardless of whether it's under the discernment so whether manhattan himself was going through uh discovery of his ministry and a discovery of what the scripture said he said regardless of whether it's under discernment i want to go forward and challenge the enemy is that anybody who feels that way this morning you want to go out and challenge the enemy in a bold and he goes on i'm more like a timid sort of person and i only try to work as i see the spirit of god working and then i speak he said but that's not exactly a fate in other words he said i've been waiting to see and then act he said but that's not exactly a fate that's seeing exactly what's going to happen before you say it i want to step out and fear tonight so but abraham was going through something he said i've been waiting and i've been watching and i wait but tonight i want to step out on fate and i want to come out when something new that i haven't done before take the other side and say satan jesus christ sent me to do this and you have got to leave the people and just make a bold command without even seeing anything believing it with all of my heart and i believe god will confirm it with great signs and wonders and i'm putting it to the test tonight it's a new place so i want to challenge you where you are this morning this evening wherever you are to put god to the test today it's a new place put god and his word to the test oh hallelujah you don't need to wait for a sign you could have fear this morning for your healing you could have faith this morning for a breakthrough you could have faith this morning for a revival you could have faith this morning for your children you could have fear this morning for an old-fashioned sin killing sky blue holy ghost revival you don't need nobody to be around you to have a revival you don't wait for these men to have a revival you could have it today you could have it in your home you could welcome the presence of the lord can the church say amen doing something new going where you have not gone before challenging yourself to press and worship and trust god more than you ever did before can we set a new record today to do what we have never done before that's what brother branham was entering into he was entering into a place he had never gone before he was entering into a fate that he never went before and that could only come when you go through a transformation of your mind and a transformation of your soul to realize that we want more and we cannot be satisfied with just a formal religion cannot be satisfied with just a lukewarm hallelujah i'm in the message kind of service but the promises of god that are real to us today and the promise of the holy ghost just as real as it was on the day of pentecost can the church say amen hallelujah you know anybody who knows me knows i'm not much into sports that has been never my ministry never my portion when i was very young i tried and it didn't quite work out but one thing i admire about the sporting arena is the olympics every four years or so they would come together and for some reason it doesn't matter and since the time they started it to now there's always a record that's being broken there has never been an olympics where a new record was made was not made every single olympics whether it is in cycling or it's in running or it's in whatever it is every single time man with the ability of man come together and they break out they break a record hallelujah man makes up his mind that i'm gonna push more than i did the last time man picks up his mind that i know somebody else may have had the record before but this time i'm going for something greater i'm going for something more powerful and i feel that we are at the time now that the bride of jesus christ has to break a record do you know the bible has been about breaking records oh hallelujah hallelujah every prophet every apostle every king every son of god was challenging a record that was set before them hallelujah and that's when when jesus came he came to break every record he took five loaves and two fishes and fed five thousand and broke a record hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord and that's how god is he said the same works that i do you are going to do also and greater in other words you got to break some records i believe we are come together as a church we might be virtuous we might be in our homes but we could break a record for having a revival that could start in our homes oh hallelujah starting our lives blessed be the name of the lord somebody give god a shout out praise breaking limitations doing what has not been done before accessing the unlimited resources of god do you know the resources of god are unlimited there's no limit to the resources of god when last have you made a withdrawal from the unlimited resources of god when last have you made a withdrawal from the unlimited resources of god blessed be the name of the lord oh just lay in the background i'll get to the message in a minute trying to warm up oh some of us we get we are too comfortable but we want to warm up oh forget the distractions get your house in order declare your house holy ground set up the altar this morning let's get into battle let's get into spiritual warf here i can't see you you can see me but we are fighting our invisible enemy and we have support from an invisible god oh i want you to open your eyes this morning to see that we are more than able we are more than conquerors we have access to the unlimited resources of god and god is about to do a new thing in your life a new thing in your home a new thing in your family a new thing that will shake your job a new thing that will shake your neighborhood a new thing because behold i make all things new oh god wants to do something new this morning he wants to shake up the old heart he wants to shake up the lethargic condition and get you excited a new joy a new peace a new fate a new expectation a new hope a new desire a desire for greater a desire for something more powerful because that is what it will take to leave this place and go into the rapture can the church say amen blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah hallelujah keep those mothers coming oh let's create some tectonic movement this morning in the message christ has revealed in his own word still in the background but abraham said listen to this if einstein had only the spiritual application as he had the physical application so listen so god through the prophet was seeing what einstein had done and said einstein tapped into something in that realm of the physical application that's scientific application and brother branham said if einstein had only the spiritual application as he had the physical application as he studied the laws of light and so forth he could have told us something so bernie bannon when i heard his message speaking about einstein message of that great center somewhere into the skies that an einstein said this he said if anybody ever contracted with that great center you could create it do anything and the power would be unlimited see but a man i'm speaking a mother so you say einstein without a revelation and a spiritual understanding new that somewhere out there was a great center and if you could just get into contact with that great center then you could create it you could do anything didn't the prophet say when them someone turned us out of their voices to that group who could take the word and hand it there to slice and cut they could say what they want and what they speak would have to come to pass oh hallelujah what is it in contact with that great center and i'm looking for a people this morning some mama somewhere some father somewhere some young brother somewhere somebody around the world who will get in contact with that great center oh where unlimited resources of god could be on display oh to shake this world to shake this world are we in can the church say amen oh are you in revival oh i'm in revival this morning let's go on still in the background from the message jehovah jireh brother bannon said but mary when the angel met her she didn't doubt god she said behold the handmaid of the lord be it unto me according to thy word then and never was there anything like that before but she didn't question she didn't reason she just took god at his word and went along rejoicing telling people she was going to have a baby knowing no man when that had never been done before oh wouldn't it be fine if all these mary's in here or these marys connected this morning would take that kind of attitude wouldn't it be wonderful if all the people could take that attitude don't question if god said so that settles it that's all that settles it now he is the final voice all authority hallelujah then abraham believed him and when he did abraham hadn't questioned but god said i'm going to tell you how it's done abraham i'm the bosom one i am your mother in other words you're just a baby to me you're 100 years old but you're just a baby and the natural stream of life has passed from you but i am your life giver i am your mother now don't dis that's nurse from me and you'll have your string like a young man we're gonna get into that in a minute he said i could heal your body and make you a different person while you are here on earth oh hallelujah i can prolong your days i want you to take that to heart this morning i can give you good health that's your promise all these negative thoughts i can give you good health i can do that because i am the breasted one oh blessed be the name of the lord oh hallelujah last quote for the background but iran i'm in a message of hidden light and but overhead read this a few weeks ago i've noticed among oppression that many of you as coming into you as full gospel people coming from the baptist church myself and accepting the doctrine of the baptism of the holy spirit being a separate work of the holy spirit and when martin luther reached justification by faith he thought that settled it so brethren brother brown was addressing this comfort that exists that people reach and they feel they have arrived somewhere he said when martin luther reached justification by faith he thought that settled it oh so we are coming against that spirit of being satisfied and being comfortable he said that was the light of his day and he preached it and he believed it and held on to it and it was the light of that day then he entered into another veil a man john wesley hallelujah got raised up john wesley and he smashed calvinism to the ground to the place where it ought to have its right balance and and nazarenes carried on and along come the pentecostals and then next the baptism of the holy spirit moving on up into higher heights i'm getting to something now and now when the virgin received the baptism of the holy ghost they said this is the summit this is all of it but brethren that's wrong there is no summit to god's power oh this is what i want to get to this morning there's no summit to god's power but the balance said we move on and on and on it's the unlimited resources of god has never been tapped yet oh my oh if that's an encouragement to you the unlimited resources of god that has never been tapped yet blessings and powers that we know nothing about it's never been even revealed to archangels is laying ahead for his church that will believe so it's a promise it's laying ahead not to everybody but to his church that will believe what's laying ahead unlimited resources of god that has never been tapped powers we know nothing about never even reveal to angels oh come on now give the lord a shout out praise oh hallelujah so let's move up brother madam said and claim our rights as god opens the gates and swings out the welcome mat i'm reading let's move on up into deeper depths and never colonize ourselves to organize ourselves and to get into a place where there is we believe this and that's all let's believe this plus how much more we could hear from god that's what we're looking for this morning we believe this plus how much more we could hear from god and god could use anybody if your heart is open this morning to receive from god you can get a word from the lord this morning oh blessed be the name of the lord everybody feeling fine so we building so just to get into the thought a bit this morning and in our bible study there's a kind of theme that we're on to now we read it in colossians 3 and i'll just read just the first three verses to connect to this colossians 3 verse 1 paul is speaking to that church the colossian church and he said if you even be risen with christ so he's not speaking to strangers he's not speaking to visitors he's not speaking to people who didn't know what he was talking about he said if ye then be risen with christ in other words you have a relationship with god if he then be risen with christ you have had an experience with god the call of god has been upon your life you understand that this is the resurrection gospel it's a gospel to move from death to life if ye then be risen with christ seek those things which are above where christ sit on the right hand of god set your affection on things above not on the things on the earth for ye are dead and your life is hid with christ in god can the church say amen and then we now read the scripture this morning now this message today about being in christ and we read the scripture second corinthians 5 17 therefore if any man be in christ he is a new creature all things are passed away behold behold all things become new can the church say amen if any man be in christ so this message today is to those who are in christ hallelujah not those who are in the message not those who are in church not those who are in an inspiration one inspiration or the other it is for those who are in christ it's not to those who are in a doctrine or to those who are in a belief or to those that are in a system this message is to those who are in christ in other words being in christ is a prerequisite or the foundation for where we're going next can the church say amen and it says if any man be in christ so it's not up to me or you to judge who the man is if any man gets into christ he hallelujah is a new creature this has nothing to do about group has nothing to do with association has something to do with belief it is just getting into christ he is a new creation all things are passed away old habits are passed away all behaviors are passed away all problems are passed away all situations are passed away and all things every service becoming new hallelujah every week you're seeing a new thing hallelujah because your eyes are being changed your heart is being changed your desires being changed because you are in christ you're not caught up in yourself you're not caught up in your emotions you're not caught up in your ambitions you're not caught up in your desires you are in christ from the message and exposition of the seven church ages the laotian church age but the random said but now speaking about jesus he is standing in the midst of the church hallelujah as he stands there revealing who he is in this last age he calls himself the author of the creation of god hallelujah so jesus is the author of creation of god brother branham said this is another creation this that he is referring to has to do with the church i'm reading this is a special designation of himself he is the creator of that church so this church that we are talking about and this new creation we are talking about and the relationship with the author of the creation of god has nothing to do with the work of man hallelujah suffering god dealing with individuals and bringing them into a new creation his creation and he's singular is the author of creation the author of the creation of god can the church say amen the heavenly bridegroom created his own bride oh my so it was not a happenstance it's not it's not a watching you and you turn into this and this is how and this is why i know he is creating his own bride he is very much involved in the process of bride shaping of bride honing of bright perfection of bright mentoring of bride coaching a bright scolding of getting her into position the heavenly bridegroom created his own bride as the spirit of god listen to the prophet he came down and created in the virgin mary the cells from which his body was born but ibrahim said i want to repeat that he created the very cells in the womb of mary for that body it was not enough for the holy spirit to simply give life to a human ovum supplied by mary that would have been sinful mankind producing a body that would not have produced the last adam of him it was said lo a body has thou father prepared for me god not mary provided that body mary was the human incubator and she carried that holy child and brought him to earth brought him to birth it was a god man he was the son of god he was of the new creation man and god met and joined he hallelujah was the first of this new race oh hallelujah so remember the brands we could have a super church a super race as we near the headstone but abraham is saying that he jesus was the first of this new race he is the head of this new race colossians 1 18 and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence and now he connected to the scripture he read second corinthians 5 17 therefore if any man be in christ he is a new creation all things have passed away behold all things are become new there you can see that though man was of the old order or creation now in union with christ hallelujah he has become the new creation of god ephesians 2 10 for we are his workmanship hallelujah the results of his work that's what workmanship is the result of your work right created in union with christ jesus onto good works ephesians 4 24 that he put on the new man hallelujah which after god is created in righteousness and true holiness this new creation is not the all creation made over or it would not be called a new creation this is exactly what it says it is new creation it is another creation distinct from the old one oh hallelujah brethren goes on no longer is he dealing by ways of the flesh that was how he dealt with israel he chose abraham and of abraham's issue through the godly isaac line but now out of every kindred tribe and nation he has purpose a new creation he is the first of that creation

his suffering power that his sovereign power could choose you his sovereign power knew your name his sovereign power knew what day you were going to be born his sovereign power met you in the hospital room you couldn't die your delivery had to be a safe delivery it may have had complications but his sovereign power was there when you were born because you are predestinated for a new creation oh hallelujah every trial every test every situation what is it the working of the sovereign power of god his workmanship shaping cutting molding preparing putting aside pushing this hair moving this aside causing this to happen in the political realm in the financial realm in the ecclesiastical realm it doesn't matter what realm he needs to interact with his workmanship is what he's interested in his sons and daughters is what he's interested in his bride is what he's interested in i'm still reading his sovereign power brought it to pass by his own decree i'm reading the prophet's words isn't this encouraging this morning by his own decree a decree becomes law by his own decree he elected the members of this new creation hallelujah so your election is by decree it is not just election by vote it is election by decree nothing can stop this election oh hallelujah oh my you can't turn over the vote you can't say something happened with the vote by decree he elected the members of this

omniscience he's all-knowing he knows your trouble he knows your problems he knows your situations he knows your mountains he knows your valleys he knows your heartache he knows the stuff about you that nobody else knows and his omniscience hallelujah made a way for you by decree to be elected he knew you were going to fall here he knew this was going to happen but his omniscience and said an omnipotence he is all-powerful so his power combined with his omniscience and his power to decree by election and his ability do you see you anywhere in that whole conversation whoa hallelujah you're not even in the conversation hallelujah is his omniscience his omnipotence his predestination his election his decree his love his law his will his good pleasure hallelujah and you want to tell me i can be happy that his good pleasure and his love and his law and his omniscience and his omnipotence and his omnipresence could not find me and turn my life around or you should be on your feet this morning because it's not about you it's about him your love would have never been enough to connect with him but his love cut through everything to find you to find me to find us so we could be

hear about being in the church hallelujah there are many in church and not in christ in the message i'm not in christ the prerequisite to be a partaker of this service this morning is you are in christ or you want to be in christ if you want to be in a church or you want to be in a group or you're under this pastor that's a whole different conversation i have no time for that we're not here to waste time this morning we are talking about the need for a new creation because only a new creation can push back the darkness push back these fires push back all the sickness it's the manifestation of the sons of god when born sons failed sons what will they be part of that new creation come the church say amen give the lord a hand of praise oh hallelujah if you're in your house

make it come on children you're going to make it i don't care what the situation is i don't care what's going on in their lives i don't care what this lockdown has done this is just a part of the process of god's workmanship when nobody looking he working on you oh my oh my oh help me this morning when nobody around you working on you you're by yourself so you can get to know a better more about who you are so god can help you pull out the root the snake in your heart that nobody sees it's just you and god hallelujah his workmanship oh hallelujah his workmanship i'm so glad that i'm part of his workmanship he has taken time like the potter and the clay oh he's taking his time like michelangelo he's taking his time like these great gifts carving cutting holding shaping bringing you into perfection oh my i haven't even gotten to the message yet i trusted being blessed this morning i trusted being encouraged this morning i just have been inspired this morning that the all you has got to go oh you look in the mirror abraham went through it you know abram would look at himself but after a while oh the old abraham started to become less visible and the new abraham with a body change start to become more visible until a point where abraham could say this is not the old man oh hallelujah somebody help me this morning sarah had to look in the mirror and do a double take one day i'd say wait a minute wait a minute i look in the front i'm looking younger i'm feeling different i used to have back pains i used to have body pains i used to have arthritis my eyes was given trouble but as you come closer to the head stone you become more and more of a new creation because to make it over there but the brother said how could you have fear for the rapture if you can have faith for divine healing oh hallelujah so before we leave this place you got to be healed before you leave this place you got to be delivered but everybody said missing limbs will be restored i am not letting that promise go i'm not letting that go i'm not dropping one promise from the requirement of promises that god gave to us i'm holding it i'm grabbing it i'm grabbing it like like like jacob wrestle with the angel oh hallelujah oh hallelujah come on now create a fire let's light up this island oh hallelujah create a fire let's push the demons back once you turn on the light all all the insects got to go how do you turn on the light in your house turn on the light in your home turn on the light in your life this morning by the revealed word of god the fullness of the light of god the fought light coming to light up this place all the way to the rapture the resurrection the millennium the new city even the new jerusalem can the church say amen let me try to finish this quote and get to my text he elected by his own decree he elected oh my the members of his new creation he predestinated them to the adoption of children according to the good pleasure of his will by his omniscience and omnipotence he brought it to pass brought it to pass his past tense who he foreknew he called past tense who he called he justified past tense who we justify he had already glorified you have to realize that when god in eternity dealing with us in time in his world this time is already finished you know so he could speak in what we call past tense but to him because he's an eternity no beginning no ending he's already seeing the end before the beginning oh you don't hear me this morning so he can read it in past tense who he foreign who he called it justified who would justify he hath all ready glorified your healing is already finished you being sealed already finished you being in the rapture already finished we are just walking through a process of what has already been finished no wonder satan is mad no wonder satan is upset my my my mind let me try to contain myself [Music] by his omniscience and omnipotence he brought it to pass how else could he know that he would be standing in the midst of the church receiving glory from his vision if he did not make sure so but abraham said god am i he made sure he is making sure everything god is doing is to make sure that his plan don't feel oh my all things he knew and all things he worked out according to what he knew listen i'm reading from the prophet that his purpose and good pleasure be brought to pass ephesians 1 11 in whom also we have obtained an inheritance listen how being predecimated according to the purpose of him who will kept all things after the council of his own will god taken singular counsel with his will not consulting even consulting you hallelujah you not even in a conversation he not even consulting you lazarus was dead go there come and say lazarus you're interested in coming back jesus stood there in front of the grave and said lazarus comfort he consulted himself the council of his own will and he determined that lazarus you have to come and lazarus found himself coming when he came to his senses he was moving out of debt into life oh come on now whoa you have to forgive me maybe it's because nobody here are feeling a feeling what can i liberty brother stephen hallelujah you have to forgive me god don't need to consult you you need to consult your wife he need to consult your husband he can visit you today and bring off a transformation in your life behold i make all things new so this new thing we are looking for this new creation this new creature this new walk this new talk this new life and friends i've said it before and many bible studies this gospel is about progress you have to be shedding the old man into a new man you have to believe in the old ways into the new ways if you are living in this realm of the of the of revelation and and your spiritual walk and you're not changing something wrong hallelujah people who know you meet you and counter you must be saying something every time i see him he talking more positive every time i see him he's smiling more every time i meet him be more happy and i know he lost his work or not but oh god says he can get happier how is that possible because it's a new creation and no things went wrong in his life but something else seemed to be at work hallelujah he has a new perspective on stuff that went wrong god could give you a new perspective on situations in your life you can't explain hallelujah he can give you a new way to look at it can the church say man everybody feeling fine everybody feeling positive this morning in the message the future home of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride but the random is prophesying oh hallelujah he said i'll be changed from this creature that i am anybody wants to be changed from this creature change from your old walk and change on me all talking i'll be changed from this creature that i am when that day comes for i'm going to that city oh hallelujah oh hallelujah i'm going to that city the whole world caught

branham said i feel the redeeming power in my whole heart now oh this is 1964 august the 2nd but ibrahim said i feel the redeeming power in my whole heart now but everyone said if this isn't so then i've throwed my life away i've taught others this hateful thing but when i look down and see that the promise he made of this day and see it vindicated and look at this 1500 miles square congregation here's an elect that's been called from denominations and races and creeds and things gathered together as i see the word vindicating itself i know beyond one shadow of a doubt the jewels of my crown will outshine everything in the world at that day oh hallelujah there will come a time people but about him said we are not gathering for in vain we're not here having this service in vain hallelujah five of us didn't come here to have service in vain we're not all connected this morning in vain we're only waiting for that time it is very very late but jesus is still very very near may this be a reminder to us this morning of the hour we're living in the season we're living in and the promise of god that's above us hallelujah his glory is wonderful his name shall be called counselor that city can you see it there's where the bride and the groom will settle oh my whoo now i just want to read a few verses a few quotes from future home i hope you're feeling fine we're at home i don't know i don't know how long i'm going to be this morning sometimes i say i don't want to be too long i know i didn't say this morning i don't know i just riding the anointing this morning i trusted in you you're not trying to multitask i'm trying to cook and be in this service and think at the same time and trust you 100 there so that we can ride the anointing right where we need to be this morning but i said now if you think it's wonderful when we drive hundreds of miles to set here and feed on his wood listen to the prophet nowhere and and we miss it we miss coming with any true believer with miscommitted church any real believer would miss coming to church i don't want you get comfortable with this this home thinking because we are we are we are born to fellowship god we're coming any cool in the evening to fellowship with adam to fulfill his needs because he was alone and he wanted fellowship and adam as well had to try on fellowship god said it wasn't good for man to be alone he needs some fellowship i don't want you to get relaxed and comfortable and and no no no no no no we want to we we're using this until that time comes because we still have a responsibility for a short quick message or shake the whole nation so but abandonment now if you think it's wonderful when we drive hundreds of miles or whatever it is to sit here and feed on his word which this is only a shadow what will it be when we live in the city with him oh my when i live next door neighbor to you and we and when we eat of those trees he's talking about in the new city oh hallelujah friends i'm not talking about your house now you know are you talking about your neighbor making noise and no no no nobody knew city he said if this experience of coming here to church and the experience we get when we together worshiping together could be so good imagine what it'll be like when we enter into that new city when i live next door to you you imagine living next door and the prophet is there and and and abraham is down the corner and you say well where what what house is joshua house what is what's his house number hallelujah oh can you tell me which house elijah is in oh i want to go sleep with a daniel you just have to go around two blocks and there's danny ellen and opposite him is shadrach hallelujah and opposite him is brother kangale god bless you by the kangaroo happy birthday an opposite brother congress but among us oh come on somebody somebody preached back to me he said when i live next door neighbor to you and when we eat of those trees and we will walk in those streets when we walk up those streets of gold to the fountain and and drink from the fountain hallelujah walk into the paradises of god with angels hovering the earth singing the anthems oh what a day it will be my it's worth it all the road seems rugged sometimes it gets hard but oh it'll be so little when i see him make this your cry today it's i know it's a rocket road it's a rugged road hallelujah but it'll be worth it hallelujah my my my mind somebody gives a lot of praise i want you to skip through here a little bit try to find a place to close off in a few hallelujah with a brand new future home he said we understand that this great home of the brightest to be here on earth hallelujah and brother branham and we preached that before i'm not going to take too much time there but brother branham said it's it's here on the earth in other words this new city has come down on this hit hallelujah and but iran went through he typed out through isaiah isaiah and so forth and show the scriptures a new heaven a new earth but really he brought it out that is the only atmosphere around it that fire comes to consume it but ibraham said it's only the atmosphere wrong and the sin that's upon the earth that will be destroyed see now we realize that the heaven means the atmosphere he said what does it do these thistles and sickness and death and politics and sinful man and sinful woman and evil spirits will all be gone away and annihilated see it has to be done that way because we are going to live right here hallelujah these roads these these mountains these things that you see here we will live right here hallelujah right here is where we live now notice thistles germs all sicknesses and things will be completely taken away you see mankind find solutions but there's coming a fire that's going to burn the sin burn the sickness and it'll be taken away listen to the prophet all this its existence that's in the earth now man-made systems politics sin all kinds of evil spirits that the world is contaminated with and friends don't be caught up in the contamination because everything contaminated will be burnt because only holiness can live in that city on this new earth there is taught earth to purge earth to cleanse earth only new creatures can live in the new creation new creation and new creation together in perfect harmony can the church say amen all this its existence that's in the earth now man-made systems politics sin all kinds of evil spirits that the world is contaminated with and all the heavens above us in here is contaminated with evil spirit all this exists in the heavens or atmospheres and the earth which is now this earth holds these things but it wasn't made for that purpose listen to the prophet sin caused it to be like that it was made by god and all of our bodies our flesh that we live in now was put on the earth when god created it because you are out of the dust of the earth it was all laid out here when god himself created it and in him the great eternal was a thought which is his attribute now sin has caused all this to happen and god through this age this is now is gathering up his material oh because he's about to fix what has gone wrong all these years listen to the prophet satan is still here that's the reason all these things happen all these negative things all these news all the sin all the satan is behind it all in here he is still here and all of his evil forces are still here notice that's why the earth now be so filthy that's why the scum and ridiculous thing that goes on bloodshed war politics sin adultery all kinds of filthiness go on because satan is a ruler of this earth and this atmosphere both heaven and earth now is contaminated with devils that can accuse us before god and jesus is there to intercede for us see while the accuser keep pointing a finger they did this they did this they did this but the blood still covers he came to redeem that elected that he foresaw that's why it's so filthy today oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah and by the branham goes on he said the same way he takes the individual through the three stages of grace hallelujah hallelujah is the same way the world has to go through the same thing and the world went through and noah was here the world was baptized and when jesus came blood sprinkled to sanctify the earth but now it's missing one last element which is the fire it's the same way we go to us individuals can the church say amen oh hallelujah hallelujah and it was it's in this message but iran said something really powerful he said if he ever healed a person he has to do it again when the same conditions is met so we are here today to create the same conditions for healing to take place for deliverance to take place he ever saved a man he's got to do it on the same grounds he did it the first time if he ever filled a man with the holy ghost he has got to do it on the same grounds he did it the first time if he ever raised a man up from the grave he's got to do it the second time and every other time on the same principle oh my he doesn't change oh what a hope that gives me what is it not in some man-made theory something that groups of men have come together but his unchangeable word oh my my my my my oh glory glory glory glory let me skip through here oh my [Music] see but the random goes on see the heart has to be cleansed like that before god could come down in the person of the holy ghost which is christ coming down and dwell in the human heart it first must be repented it must be baptized in water in his name to to show who it belongs to then it must be cleansed by the blood of jesus and then the holy fire the holy ghost from god comes down and burns out all the desire of sin how could this ever be intellectual how we can have another way to do this it's a process it is a process hallelujah oh my my my hallelujah see amber ibrahim goes on typing the the the individual and the earth see the earth redeem goes back to its original owner again he took it from satan he pulled taking the earth away from satan just like he took you away from satan do you know god already took you from satan hallelujah like he took a little woman at the well away from satan that that woman who was that that woman who was at the well he said go call your husband hallelujah but everyone said jesus took that one from god loves to go into situations and take people who the devil think is his and snatched him he took that little woman at the well away from satan and but ivan i'm typing against the priest who thought he was with god and go there take him so but abandon bills in this whole new earth satan will be taken away from the earth just exactly like satan was taken from you satan cannot bother or he can tempt but he cannot get a born-again christian cannot get a born-again christian for god from the foundation the world foresaw him and sent jesus to redeem him and the blood speaks for him how can he sin when it can be seen even by god hallelujah oh the only thing he's here is your voice he sees your representation oh and by the same means listen to the prophet saying by the same means for the world is one of his attributes so but i branham is saying that the earth is a creation of god the earth itself is one of his attributes the world just the same as you are one of his attributes so god is coming for his attributes he is redeeming his attributes he is restoring his attributes whoo because it was god's thinking in the beginning to have to have a world to be on a throne to be a king to be a redeemer to be a healer that's his attribute these processes makes us clean a temple for his dwelling place justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost with fire that does the cleansing amber about him said you know when a man receives a baptism of the fire this is 1964. so for all those who who i want to experience and they're sitting down and they're taking notes and things this is 1964. whatever i'm saying you know when a man receives the baptism of the holy ghost the baptism of fire there's a lot of noise around there they think that's a shame to hear people scream and shout like that but i said just wait till this earth gets a baptism oh my brother oh you got to be kidding me hallelujah i want a reality i don't want to show i don't want a performance i want the fire of god to take me completely if i shout dancer dance see me running on the valencia stretch don't get in my way because i'm running for my life and i'm running to glory hallelujah oh my buddy branham said one time i was his property so brother branham is sharing his own testimony one time i was his property but not now and he wanted to tell me i could sit down in church i need a message praise god what one time i was the devil's property but not now one time that little woman was his property but not now see he came to lose the grip of it lose them and let them go and who the son of man set free is free indeed he lose the grip of sin of satan upon my life upon your life i'm reading the prophet's words and now we are not his listen to the prophet have you often heard me say in prayer take your hands off of god's property see have faith to claim your own that's your rights take your hands off of her take your hands off of him you speak about your children like that speak about your family like that satan take your hand off of god's property i'm the trustee of god's property your children you are the trustee for your children the custodians of your children you are who god entrusted the responsibility with it's not your property it's god's property so you have the right for the brand i'm saying here to speak and say satan take your hand off of god's property oh hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord give the lord a shout our praise i'm trying to find a place to close out not going to be too much longer with you everybody feeling fine hallelujah bless

have nobody know how you're moving because you're armed and dangerous you know whose side you're on you're the army of the lord about your father's business nothing moves you nothing shake you nothing distracts you you're looking like what about instead of the beginning of the service to see where the enemy is at and take faith and say satan i come to challenge you for too long you have operated in my house for too long you have operation in my life hallelujah today today today we serve notice i'm a new creation i have new christians stamped on my passport that's where i'm going new city new jerusalem that's my eternal destination and no devil could stop it because this has been a decree by election of god it must come to pass listen to this still in the same message future home like he did us his creation to live in listen to this before he could come in it so there's a coming in it which means if he could come in he could be out before he could come in it he had to give us the baptism of fire so he's given the baptism of fire then the holy ghost come in and live how could this be a revelation and there's an understanding and well when i know something and i read some quotes and i accept it this is not accepting this is god being confident to give you something you say a new heart i'll give you i'll give you a new spirit and i'll put my spirit in you will i read a book so because i really book i have it no this is not that this is a reality no it's not something it's not it's not well i in church for 20 years this is a new creature hallelujah your behavior your nature your being your attribute your your habits your desire is different before you can come in it he had to give us a baptism of fire then the holy ghost come in and live baptism of fire then when you get that baptism of fire then the holy ghost can come in what as it does it burns up listen to what it does it burns up everything contrary to the word out of you so the holy ghost itself the spirit of truth will guide you into all truth which underscores that you cannot be in the same place this week as last week because if the holy ghost is operating in your heart it should be it have one mission a seeker mission to find what is not the word and destroy it you heard what i read it burns up everything contrary to the word out of you so the fire of the holy ghost when it comes in it has a mission it has a purpose it has an objective to hunt in your heart and find what has done the word and burn it so if you have behaviors and thoughts and things that is not the word it's either one or two things oh just one thing really that holy ghost there that you claim to have not there no because the holy ghost will it don't need you to operate it let me say that one more time the holy ghost don't need you you are not the battery pack for the holy ghost the holy ghost has its own dynamo its own power oh come on now let's push now the holy ghost don't need you to wind it up the holy ghost is good when that fire comes in your heart as you come into peter and coming to them brother's heart hunting the holy ghost does the transformation so you have to really be careful what is in you and what is working in you because if you are not changing you need to be desperate to receive the holy ghost so the fire can begin to work and burn out oh hallelujah holy i hope this helps somebody people sitting on your message any message have you received the holy ghost since you believed could there still the baptist doctrine in your message you have it when you believe have what because i'm not seeing new creature behavior you still can't forgive that's one of the first things you can't be humble that when the first sign of the holy ghost humility before we climb anywhere oh come on we're back to basic this morning new creature hallelujah hallelujah a new creature and when that change that'll take place then listen it can't be only the people who outside know you're changing you know your doors in your house those in your house must do your changing hallelujah your wife must say now boy this this this thing is real your husband was saying now boy this thing is real because this is i living with this person for years this is new this is different never seen this version before this is version 1.7 hallelujah this is a new version it's a new creature hallelujah still making coffee the same way still cooking the same way but oh my there's a difference there's a there's a different presence oh hallelujah let me try to find a way to close out here this morning oh my i'm not even halfway through but by the grace of god i trust it resonates with you hallelujah we talk about the journey of the overcomers it's a journey it's a process you're overcome you're overcome you overcome primary school you overcome your house you overcome just to be born you have to overcome hallelujah overcome all kind of challenges you overcome looking at a different sickness you overcome to be here today is a sign of overcoming hallelujah but don't just stay with what you have done and have a pity party let your mindset be fixed and overcoming because to him that overcome it will i grant all everything we read it in the scripture the inheritance hallelujah oh my let me skip through here to find a place to close out said many of these things before oh my so are you ready church to go to that new city that john saw the city that abraham was looking for but that's what brother branham described he said from abraham time he looking for the city the city that that coming that john saw abraham had a glimpse of that city that's the city he was seeking who maker and pillar was god being a prophet he know that city was somewhere and he first soaked the city he lived and went over looking for a city whose builder and maker was called jesus going to prepare with the divine hands a divine city divine architect for divine borton people for upper destination people he has gone to prepare abraham was looking for it are you looking for it why are you looking towards the news any media any politicians anything no no what are you looking for he said abraham was looking for it he was actively seeking hallelujah that is what his focus was he professed he was a pilgrim and a stranger for he looked for a city whose builder and maker was called that prophet knowing it was somewhere john saw it coming down so that abram is typing out from genesis to revelation because abraham is in genesis revelation is john from genesis to revelation it's been about that new city hallelujah coming down to it because satan messed up god's eden and god had to destroy this atmosphere but only do when a certain people is here to to the people who are living that city can the church say amen john saw it coming down but abraham actually thought it was an earth right then he met melchizedek the king of it we studied it before mercedes the prince of salem the prince of peace jerusalem is the city of peace he seems salem we know this and gave him a tithe which had no father or no mother he had no beginning of life or no ending of life abraham met him and took communion right here on the literal spot where the city will be raised up oh my oh hallelujah so but i'm showing where abraham was when he met melchizedek the great prince that's the exact spot when this new city drops on earth abraham was marking the spot in genesis for the destination he put the x where the new city had to drop oh come on now god had no planning he's now not now putting together this has been a great plan from since the beginning till now oh my oh hallelujah oh holy mountain there will be streets of transparent gold could you imagine i came and picked a transparent gold avenues and houses and parks i'm reading the prophet you know if you want to read it the tree of life will be there 12 different manners of fruit one each month will be born on it do you mean that brother madam overcomers only that overcome the beast overcome his mark that's catholicism protestantism nominationalism who overcome the beast his mark the letter of his name he will have a right to the tree of life to enter into the gates where nothing that defiles can ever go in so to go in there you can't be living any old how i make it in there because nothing that defiles could ever make it in so it has to be a total complete transformation not just an intellectual understanding but a change a genuine real change of your heart hallelujah oh the tree of life will be there for overcomers only i'm getting ready to wind up but the gideon you can come the leaves will be for the healing of the nations oh my glory trying to find a place to close up here oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh my my my my my my glory these precious promises oh hallelujah hey many many many men listen to the prophet in the new it and new heavens will never be blackened again when this new earth is to come the devil will be bound satan he is still loose now he is accuser but in the new earth he will be bound and cast into the lake of fire in this holy fire hallelujah he said then in this new earth let's look at it for a few minutes so as we get ready to close our let's look at it for a few minutes hallelujah the skies will never be black again i was driving up the church this morning driving through the rain and i was reading this this morning before the rain i say but look at this thing now boy oh the skies will never be black again with angry clouds winds will never blow across her again like that oh my she will never tear up the trees and tear up the houses and turn over things look just a few days ago hey here the earthquake hallelujah that kind of stuff will never happen again lightning and the rat will never belt from satan across there and kill a man walking on a road or burn up a building no no more there'll be no more typhoons sweep down or storms and tornadoes tear up houses and kill little children and things won't be no more trying to just it won't be the satan is cast out what is say heavens and earth have met god and man is reconciled no wonder the bible says the whole creation groaning and travailing for the manifestation of the sons of god our restored eden has begun but abandonment said see all the curse is gone just like all the curse of sin is gone when the holy ghost accepts you listen to the choice of words but the bad amuse not you accept the holy ghost when the holy ghost accepts you similar in type 2 this is my beloved son we identify with the message until the message chooses to identify with us hallelujah we identify with christ until christ says confirmation this is my beloved son see you don't accept it it accepts you because it's god's attribute hallelujah and then when the earth is restored by the same thing there can be no more cursing no more storms no more winds no more typhoons you are reconciled man and god has met the new earth will put on its eden beauty again the new birth will spread forth after her baptism of fire oh blessed be the name of the lord everybody feeling fine trying to find a place to close out here hallelujah and when the earth is restored let me just read that no beast will be there to destroy you when you walk down the road in the flower gardens there will not be any supernatural hiss at you and bite you with this poison but when i'm talking about even the animals that people who fred little mosquito afraid you say no even super nothing is there there'll be none of that new earth ever mounted listen to the prophet none of that new earth will ever mount up a little sod bang for a grave in other words nobody would dig up that new earth brother stephen to make a grave again because there'll be no more debt there'll be no more sickness man and god has come together bride and bride group isn't this a hope that we could look forward to isn't this a promise we could look forward to bride and bridegroom heaven and earth has embraced each other god has come not to dwell among man his tabernacle is with them we read the scripture there'll be no more sin there'll be no more sorrow never will there ever be a tear drop off a mother's cheek oh my could you imagine not even a tear drop right now we have a lot of weeping mamas weeping mothers weeping for their children weeping for this but he said when that time comes there will not be a single drop to ever come off the cheeks of a mama over her baby brother branham said it won't be on that new ground it is redeemed hallelujah and look you were part of that ground and when he redeemed you he redeemed the earth with the same thing god already took up his abode oh gideon you have to play something no graves no teardrops no more bloodshed she will never be moistened by a teardrop or blood no more wars no more colds of winter no cold snow upon the breast of her won't lay there no more the sun will never burn grass again even the desert will bring forth roses hallelujah god said so when she is redeemed when she takes her fire baptism oh hallelujah don't you want your fire baptism just as the earth has to get its fire baptism like the man was when he still had hatred malice and strife in him when the fire baptism come it cleaned it off no more jealousy new creature no more of nothing it's just absolutely is a dwelling place for god and remember that's his delegation i'm winding down he said this but ibraheem said that's not just a story that's the truth satan sin and sinners has gone forever it's all done blended into an eternity oh my oh my i'm done i'm done nothing will ever touch that sod that new earth but holiness the redeemed i just feel so good god and his creation and his creatures of this creation is redeemed by his own blood cleansed by his own cleansing process his germ-killing sin killing process is there anybody this morning wants to surrender themselves to god's germ-killing sin killing process that opens up the opportunity for the holy ghost itself to fall upon your body your mind your soul your heart and consume you like if anything is sterilized but ibraham said and we have heard a lot about sterilization and sanitation and and and on these things the last year he said if anything is terrorized the best sterilization we have ever had has been fire you can take anything with a random set and wash it with soap suds and all these chemicals that they talk about is still in free but you burn it once oh it's over and when the holy fire of god sterilizes the earth with the chemicals he has lifted his bride which can come into heaven with him while this is going on and comes back upon the earth again a new heavens and a new earth the cold winter can't hurt it the hot summers can't hurt it the deserts will blossom as a rose sin and sin as a god god and his creatures and creation is dwelling together in perfect harmony as the heavens and the earth is husband and wife so is christ and the church and they all meet in one big glorious plan of redemption and is brought right into the bosoms of god let not your heart be trouble jesus said it's in john 14 i have a reason to go away you've believed in god now believe in me i'm going to prepare a place for you in my father's house is many palaces christ is there under the construction of this new jerusalem
