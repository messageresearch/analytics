[34:44] mighty warrior
[34:48] to me
[34:50] [Music]
[35:00] now you happen even a house to the law
[35:02] this morning so I'd like to invite your
[35:05] attention to the wood if you would turn
[35:08] with me thank you musicians thank you
[35:09] for the Anthony to three portions of
[35:12] scripture reading Isaiah 55 if reading
[35:16] Malachi 3 and reading Hebrews 13
[35:20] scripture readings this morning as they
[35:32] are 55 a familiar passage of Scripture
[35:34] Sikhi the Lord while he may be found
[35:37] call ye upon him while he is near let
[35:41] the wicked forsake his way and the
[35:43] unrighteous man his thoughts and let him
[35:45] return unto the Lord and He will have
[35:47] mercy upon him and to our God for he
[35:51] will abundantly pardon for my thoughts
[35:54] are not your thoughts neither are your
[35:56] ways my ways saith the LORD for as the
[35:59] heavens are higher than the earth so are
[36:01] my ways higher than your ways and my
[36:03] thoughts than your thoughts so as the
[36:06] rain coming down and the snow from
[36:07] heaven and return it not thither but
[36:10] water it and make it it bring forth and
[36:12] bud that it may give see to the sower
[36:15] and bread to the eater so shall my word
[36:18] be that goeth forth out of my mouth it
[36:20] shall not return unto me void but it
[36:23] shall accomplish that which I please and
[36:26] it shall prosper in the thing whereto I
[36:29] sent it really Malachi 3 and verse 6 for
[36:32] I am the Lord and I change not and read
[36:37] in Hebrews 13:8 Jesus Christ the same
[36:40] yesterday and today and forever me the
[36:44] Lord had a blessing to the reading of
[36:46] his word you may be seated this morning
[36:48] I have a title this morning my word
[36:51] shall not return for it my word shall
[36:56] not return void hallelujah and that word
[36:59] void means empty so the word cannot
[37:02] return empty the word cannot return with
[37:05] a result once the word is spoken
[37:07] something must come out of it even if
[37:10] you don't understand what
[37:11] comes out of it something always comes
[37:13] out of it my word cannot return void but
[37:17] it shall accomplish that thing which I
[37:19] please so there are things that would
[37:21] please God and it shall prosper in the
[37:23] thing whereto I sent it so once God
[37:26] speaks whatever he says it has got to
[37:29] prosper it as got to come to pass and
[37:31] God through diverse prophets and time
[37:34] than dispensations and epochs and eras
[37:36] have sent prophets and messengers and
[37:39] preachers because the mouthpiece of God
[37:41] are his prophets so when God speaks
[37:44] through his prophets a true prophet kind
[37:46] of lie a true prophet cannot inject his
[37:49] own ideas a true prophet cannot put his
[37:52] own perspective on things a true prophet
[37:54] is commissioned to say what God put on
[37:56] his heart to see and to use his mouth as
[37:59] an instrument and that is what makes it
[38:02] a true prophet and when that true
[38:04] prophet speaks and it comes to pass then
[38:06] you know it's a true prophet and if you
[38:08] read scripture you cannot find a
[38:10] prophecy a came from a true prophet that
[38:12] did not come to pass it could happen in
[38:15] a month it could happen in a year it
[38:16] could happen in five years or it could
[38:18] be 400 years as a prophecy that came
[38:21] from Isaiah that a virgin should
[38:23] conceive and bear a child it was not an
[38:25] immediate manifestation of the prophecy
[38:28] but the prophecy had to come to pass
[38:30] because a prophet spoke it and once a
[38:33] prophet speaks it has got to come to
[38:35] pass or come on somebody say man and
[38:39] even when a prophet comes off to Cena
[38:42] even though another prophet is there and
[38:44] another prophet may be there if there's
[38:46] anything that's hanging over the
[38:48] fulfillment of it could still happen it
[38:50] must still happen in fact so when Peter
[38:52] walked out of the upper room he didn't
[38:56] refer back to the molokai he didn't
[38:59] refer back to zeti he went straight back
[39:01] JoEllen see this is what joeld was
[39:03] talking about it it couldn't happen in
[39:06] his name other prophets came after
[39:08] Joelle but this prophecy that joy and
[39:10] mana it apply to us can the church say
[39:13] man so-called because he operates in
[39:16] eternity and is not limited by time the
[39:19] way we see
[39:20] things is not the way God sees things
[39:22] and before God clock down to given the
[39:25] word about my word shall not return void
[39:27] he prefaced sit or lay the foundation
[39:30] about the difference between our
[39:32] thoughts and his thoughts he said my
[39:34] thoughts are higher than your torture so
[39:35] what am I about to tell you is because
[39:37] my thoughts are higher than your
[39:39] thoughts and my ways are higher than my
[39:41] ways so even if you don't understand
[39:43] them my word chill shall not return void
[39:46] it is not peace of your thinking it's my
[39:50] peace on your understanding
[39:51] it's the peace of your experiences it's
[39:54] not based on your emotion it's not based
[39:57] on how you feel it's not based on what
[39:59] happened to you if not be son what
[40:02] happened this morning
[40:03] it's not be so what the doctor said it's
[40:05] the peace that what shinu did it's not
[40:08] based on who your father was
[40:09] it's some peace and who your mother was
[40:12] it's some piece of how long in church
[40:14] it's peace under one factor that if God
[40:17] spoken it's got to come to pass
[40:20] it's very simple this gospel isn't a
[40:24] complicated gospel once God speaks it
[40:27] it's got to come to pass somebody
[40:30] preached back to me Oh hallelujah
[40:33] you may be seated for a minute I go back
[40:37] to and the Prophet preach for the blind
[40:38] man you pray for the blind man and I me
[40:41] pray for the blind man but the man had
[40:42] no feet so the man came back to the
[40:45] prayer line he came back to be prayed
[40:47] for and but I brought him said I don't
[40:48] have to pray for you again I want you to
[40:51] get that this morning he said I don't
[40:52] need to pray for you again I already
[40:55] prayed for you and when I pray for you
[40:57] it already activated something in heaven
[40:59] the brain is not the problem your head
[41:02] is the problem so you see it go back to
[41:04] work go back to what you do and begin to
[41:07] see my stripes I'm healing because you
[41:09] already healed up I can't take it black
[41:11] you didn't hear it again it's already
[41:14] the truth no one has already gone water
[41:16] your healing has been declared of your
[41:19] deliverance has been declared your
[41:21] breakthrough has been declared when God
[41:23] said we see here oh holy awesome he was
[41:25] not just speaking to Peter
[41:28] he was not just speaking Sir John he was
[41:31] not just to get the poor but he was
[41:33] speaking to you Jesus himself said
[41:36] receive you know Holy Ghost and when
[41:38] that word left his motor that word
[41:40] waited until you came along and waited
[41:43] until Paul was there and waited until
[41:45] all come on somebody tweets back to me
[41:48] [Applause]
[41:50] don't try to lock my god in any day and
[41:55] time you can't lock him in this you
[41:57] can't lock him in time
[41:59] he's an eternal God he doesn't
[42:01] understand our limitations if thoughts
[42:03] I hired at all talks of his ways I hired
[42:06] at all ways Oh somebody preached back to
[42:09] me this morning
[42:10] [Applause]
[42:13] hallelujah hallelujah
[42:16] no one but a Branham said we ought to be
[42:19] reckless
[42:20] I'm CLS and feet meaning you have an
[42:23] attitude that you'd already care anymore
[42:26] because your feet is what's propelling
[42:28] you it will have to make sense to you
[42:30] it's not supposed to make sense
[42:32] everything and that makes sense as well
[42:35] eternity Gordon loves to do foolishness
[42:37] the max don't have to add up when Jesus
[42:40] came the match didn't add up
[42:41] five lawns to fish feeds life closed
[42:44] them remain the twelve baskets the match
[42:46] does not have to add up we have to take
[42:49] God at His Word
[42:52] stop trying to figure it out stop trying
[42:55] to look at your past and say I don't
[42:57] think I'm gonna make it your past have
[42:59] nothing to do with where you are now and
[43:01] where you are calling God is able to
[43:04] take anybody tell them with the Holy
[43:06] Ghost he could take your sadness into
[43:10] gladness and he does not need permission
[43:12] he does not need permission he could do
[43:15] it this morning and he is doing it this
[43:18] morning
[43:20] [Applause]
[43:21] [Music]
[43:23] you may be seated your healing is not
[43:27] based on merit of your understanding
[43:29] your healing is not peace and the merit
[43:32] of your revelation your healing is based

[51:27] hallelujah hallelujah how many had a
[51:30] rough week this week there's only one
[51:33] person to be knows this or they might be
[51:35] non listener but everybody Niko put up
[51:43] two hands is and that's time that's all
[51:47] rachel job didn't have a hard week job
[51:52] had a hard place a trying way he lost
[51:55] everything and when he lost he think
[51:59] that wasn't he naturally has a losing me
[52:00] physically that I get sick I said I get
[52:03] so bad II that's a loose income use
[52:05] everything any wife see why don't just
[52:06] go ahead and we get him surance money
[52:14] but the Bible says that the suffering
[52:16] that is present time because people
[52:18] suffering is not people know that's walk
[52:20] in a sovereign alone but at his
[52:23] suffering that is president I'm not
[52:24] worried to be compared with the glory
[52:27] that will be revealed so in other words
[52:31] to get the glory you have to go to the
[52:32] suffering so that's why the Bible says
[52:35] the issue that is suffering you know but
[52:37] count it all joy so the next question is
[52:41] who had joy through that trial this week

[53:09] look to buy Peter say listen I'm
[53:11] drowning enough Peter I forget about
[53:14] Ruben forget about all he would have
[53:16] learned as a fisherman because what he
[53:18] had stepped out on was new territory if
[53:20] he was walking on the water and he was
[53:21] honestly sir enough to say I need help
[53:24] when Jacob was left alone and he was
[53:26] battling with the Angely interesting who
[53:28] are you in other words tell me what

[54:07] it's gospel and these tragedies that get
[54:09] us to get patience
[54:12] put your knowledge temperance patience
[54:15] godliness and then quarters designee
[54:18] child he himself sign off on each other
[54:20] for brotherly Canada because I hear it
[54:23] you're the age to test and to trial and
[54:27] you will have to do it over and over
[54:28] again until you say yes that's it
[54:31] you know behaving itself like a son
[54:32] because power has to come power has to
[54:37] come and feature how poor you have to
[54:39] have character and the police are trying
[54:43] is when you feel or your door feel like
[54:46] doing and still do that's what is
[54:50] sacrifice of praise is you know back in
[54:52] the old days his sacrifice was bringing
[54:54] me lamb and and but this sacrifice you
[54:57] know is is is when you don't want to do
[54:59] but you still do so you don't feel like
[55:02] worship it II don't feel your your body
[55:04] your hand given your trouble and but but
[55:06] a brand said when you lift your hand you
[55:08] defy gravity such as the actor live in
[55:12] your hand is defining laws of this world

[55:20] hands you identify yourself as a
[55:22] worshiper and the church a man it's a
[55:26] choice it's a choice to worship it's a
[55:29] choice the praise it's a choice to come
[55:31] into the house of God it's a choice to
[55:33] read the word it's a choice to be on
[55:35] fire it's a choice to forgive and so
[55:39] choice the love it's a choice to have
[55:42] more patience it's a choice to Terry and
[55:44] waters of you horns are your top it's a
[55:46] choice to bridle your tongue it's a
[55:48] choice to have the right attitude it's a
[55:50] choice it's a choice it's a choice can

[56:10] will respond say the Lord that word has
[56:13] got to come to pass that's your promise
[56:15] has nothing to do with what you're lost
[56:17] the question of what you're lost your
[56:19] question is when is he gonna restore
[56:21] because he promised
[56:22] restore hallelujah hallelujah
[56:29] my my my my mind I'm gonna brand him in
[56:32] the message putting on the whole armor
[56:34] of God he says that and he sees speaking
[56:37] about about secret agents and warfare
[56:38] and he said each nation will equip its
[56:41] people with the latest equipment the
[56:44] very latest and they study and they do
[56:46] everything they're trying to counteract
[56:48] the other fellows weapons I think a
[56:51] little more modern weapon something with
[56:53] a little more punch to it
[56:54] and it's the nation's business if they
[56:57] want to survive they want to equip their
[56:59] soldiers with the best equipment that
[57:01] there is well God you know he's infinite
[57:05] you don't have to think anything better
[57:09] hallelujah he doesn't think anything
[57:12] better he got the best to begin with so
[57:15] you can't improve on it nothing to be
[57:18] done about it he gives us the best
[57:21] that's his wood it's what is the best so
[57:25] good they're trying to give you our
[57:26] improvement on it it's the same wood
[57:27] it's already the best weapon it's your
[57:30] best offense against sickness
[57:32] it's your offense against everything
[57:33] you're going through your boys giving
[57:35] trouble to the wood the wood is flour
[57:38] you're feeling sick take the water by
[57:41] his stripes I'm healed you see the word
[57:43] come on now but Iran I've said God
[57:52] cannot make a decision today and
[57:53] tomorrow come back and make a better
[57:55] decision God doesn't make mistakes
[57:58] he doesn't have accidents here well let
[58:01] me try this this morning lemon let me
[58:03] try to talk about a pop well i'ma try to
[58:05] talk to about our Nicholas i'ma try and
[58:07] see if this hole up this time no he
[58:08] makes a perfect decision every time so
[58:10] if God chose you and put your name down
[58:12] on a lamb's book of life he got bigger I
[58:15] wonder if I do it I wanna do it right no
[58:17] he already chose you and God cannot
[58:20] change his mind he cannot change his
[58:23] mind about you Oh hallelujah and the
[58:27] arrow of God's deliverance has already
[58:29] been shot
[58:30] he can't even pull it back his prophesy
[58:33] over you
[58:33] I've already been spoken he can't even
[58:36] take it black hallelujah
[58:41] so you can rest on whatever God says you
[58:46] can rest on whatever God says concerning
[58:49] your life you can rest on what he says
[58:51] about your help you have to rest on what
[58:53] he says about your spiritual condition
[58:55] that he would not leave you Paran it's
[58:57] not his desire to leave you empty you
[58:59] can rest on what he says when he says he
[59:01] gonna give you the Holy Ghost
[59:02] you can rest on that you have to go
[59:05] beyond your emotions beyond your
[59:07] feelings I'll be on your mistakes
[59:09] The Devil's Shabbos I keep you in that
[59:11] realm of your mistakes and your sins and
[59:14] your failures and what went wrong and
[59:16] you lose control that's the devil's job
[59:20] but we are here this morning to get
[59:22] reminded that there's a seed in our soul
[59:25] that the devil cannot mess with the
[59:29] devil didn't put it there
[59:30] that ever kind of reach it he cannot get
[59:33] to it but a brother sent him to get
[59:35] access he and he have to come under the
[59:37] blood and he cannot come under the blood
[59:40] because in the devil with the common of
[59:41] the blood he'll be your brother but the
[59:43] devil is our enemy he cannot come under
[59:46] the blood so he cannot come and touch
[59:47] what's inside your soul he has no access
[59:51] he has no access when the never tries to
[59:55] reach you he try to reach you access
[59:57] denied he can reach other people for you
[1:00:00] you are the blood wash once there's
[1:00:02] power in the blood there's a blood
[1:00:05] bumper around you the devil could try to
[1:00:07] afflict your body he could try to mess
[1:00:10] with your spirit but your soul there's a
[1:00:12] see them they're a germ of
[1:00:15] predestination hallelujah you may be
[1:00:20] seated
[1:00:20] and that scene it's based on the law of
[1:00:24] God that seat could only produce after
[1:00:27] its kind and that seed in that seed has
[1:00:31] every genetic code from God in that
[1:00:34] sheet is a living feet it's a living
[1:00:36] virtue it's a living knowledge it's a
[1:00:38] living temperance is a living patience
[1:00:41] it's a living College in that sedum is
[1:00:43] the mechanics in that sheet is that DNA
[1:00:46] of who you are that you didn't know
[1:00:48] about so God had to send the message to
[1:00:51] wake up your understanding that this
[1:00:54] seed is in your soul and cut at a week
[1:00:57] of your understanding that you have to
[1:00:58] get that sheet in the right atmosphere
[1:01:00] because you could take a seed you may be
[1:01:03] seated and if you put the seed can ice
[1:01:06] it'll have a different result and if you
[1:01:10] wanted in good ground it's all about the
[1:01:12] environment so where the pranam said if
[1:01:14] you take a chicken egg and put the egg
[1:01:16] under a dog didn't see that because the
[1:01:18] atmosphere is right
[1:01:20] the chicken was still hot because it has
[1:01:22] to be near right environment and when
[1:01:24] you take a seat you can't put the seat
[1:01:26] in nice beautiful sprinkle sand and
[1:01:29] prints on ice dust no you have to put
[1:01:31] the seed in money on you have to put the
[1:01:33] seed in the field sometimes you have to
[1:01:35] put the seed in conditions that that
[1:01:37] that that seem contrary to the beauty
[1:01:39] that's about to be revealed
[1:01:41] so God under the chaos of darkness under
[1:01:44] the cares of this world allowed us to
[1:01:46] grow up in different homes different
[1:01:47] families different backgrounds that
[1:01:50] appear to be so messed up that the devil
[1:01:52] have to wonder could anything good come
[1:01:54] out of Nazareth the devil 801 could
[1:01:57] outbreak about a Trinidad the devil
[1:02:00] after one is here somebody's gonna
[1:02:02] overcome because they're looking bleak
[1:02:04] and looking like the bride instead it
[1:02:06] looked like nobody holding a message but
[1:02:09] the sheet is still alive
[1:02:10] and the devil because he can't see it
[1:02:12] because it was hidden under the Seventh
[1:02:14] Seal he is trying to do mathematics and
[1:02:17] geometry and algebra to figure out who
[1:02:20] you are the scenery here to access us if
[1:02:23] so be if thou be FOP if God poured
[1:02:29] himself into Christ and the devil didn't
[1:02:32] even know who he was what about you as
[1:02:36] an amateur cook what about you as a
[1:02:38] measure of that stature the devil has no
[1:02:42] idea who you are you are caught secret
[1:02:44] weapons his secret agents
[1:02:48] somebody say man blessed be the name of
[1:02:58] the Lord hallelujah so his word cannot
[1:03:04] return void but Abraham said this
[1:03:07] message would find itself in the hands
[1:03:11] of the predestinated you didn't find a
[1:03:14] message the message found you the
[1:03:17] message interrupted your life the
[1:03:19] message wanted you the message followed
[1:03:21] you the message conflicted you the
[1:03:23] message convinced you even when you back
[1:03:26] slip it troubled you you try to do
[1:03:31] different things and somehow you just
[1:03:32] didn't feel comfortable that's why I
[1:03:33] City young people all the time
[1:03:34] listen when you have one foot in church
[1:03:37] I want for all the church is the most
[1:03:38] miserable existence the most frustrated
[1:03:45] place to be is one foot in church and
[1:03:47] one foot in the world because if I go to
[1:03:53] a party and jump up because there's too
[1:03:56] much of God in you to be comfortable
[1:03:58] there so you jump in on one foot you can
[1:04:02] and then I'm gonna come to church it cut
[1:04:04] and sew all the way in before one foot
[1:04:06] the fighter I'm trying to be outside you
[1:04:07] upstairs on your foot outside
[1:04:16] but something has to take over is about
[1:04:19] surrender it's about to ring on the
[1:04:22] white flag and seeing Lord I surrender
[1:04:25] that's where the song comes from I
[1:04:27] surrender all I surrender control
[1:04:33] surrender decision-making surrender all
[1:04:35] of it to what God wants and when you do
[1:04:38] that it's simple this message is not
[1:04:39] complicated you know it's a message of
[1:04:42] surrender it's a message of commitment
[1:04:44] it's a message of truth and faith and a
[1:04:46] reality that your behavior has to change
[1:04:49] people come to church and going back and
[1:04:51] they have more knowledge but they were
[1:04:53] here via ISM more information but the
[1:04:56] behavior is the same if you disrespect
[1:04:59] with your husband I would expect at
[1:05:01] least every week you're less
[1:05:02] disrespectful until it's gone but are
[1:05:04] these same level a disrespect for years
[1:05:05] you were operated at level 9 let it hit
[1:05:10] eight seven six five four until it some
[1:05:14] people lose the behaviors immediately
[1:05:16] like like like Saul on the road to
[1:05:18] Damascus Gordon knock him off a horse
[1:05:21] immediate transformation but as some
[1:05:23] people is a process we would pray
[1:05:25] everybody the media but as naughty kids
[1:05:27] it's a process of character development
[1:05:29] a process but a random talk about preen
[1:05:34] and he said as the about to break true
[1:05:36] is when you're getting tired and he
[1:05:37] musky to us come do you prefer to go to
[1:05:38] that you can't just go trash - only you
[1:05:43] pray for two hours solid every day
[1:05:45] really it's a process and you have to
[1:05:48] carve out more time you have to and this
[1:05:51] is your work enough people waiting and
[1:05:54] go to give to give them to get to give
[1:05:56] you what you ready give you the word
[1:05:58] which is all your weapons we need and in
[1:06:00] the word gives instructions about having
[1:06:02] a prayer life even the word have
[1:06:04] instructions husband love your wives as
[1:06:06] a commandment in the world instruction
[1:06:09] children obey appearance in the world
[1:06:14] don't forsake the assembling of
[1:06:15] yourselves together so you're supposed
[1:06:17] to be the house of God in the word
[1:06:21] present your boys a living sacrifice
[1:06:24] holy and acceptable that's in the word
[1:06:34] walk before me beat up perfect neighbor
[1:06:37] that's in the world so your promise is
[1:06:39] there Jesus come back in Matthew 5:4 ear
[1:06:42] beat therefore perfect as your father in
[1:06:44] heaven is perfect
[1:06:45] that's your word that is your hope
[1:06:50] that's your expectation that's your
[1:06:52] reality but if you want anointing a word
[1:06:55] to yourself what are you doing it is
[1:06:57] making circles you and your own death
[1:06:59] walk walk around in circles commented
[1:07:01] church walking around in circles but
[1:07:04] when you see that who is would sign
[1:07:06] return void that word that is not
[1:07:08] returning void is not Jes blessings you
[1:07:11] know it's also judgements because when
[1:07:16] God pronounced judgment on Sodom and
[1:07:18] Gomorrah he couldn't even take it back
[1:07:23] judgment I've already been spoken so he
[1:07:26] had to extract lot o because when God
[1:07:28] speaks he can unwind his word he already
[1:07:31] spoke it so judgment is spoken over Los
[1:07:33] Angeles judgment is spoken over this
[1:07:36] island judgment is spoken over this it
[1:07:38] fires coming judgment is coming but I
[1:07:42] wrapped is also coming deliverance is
[1:07:45] also coming a way of escape has already
[1:07:47] been spoken and is I've God sent a
[1:07:50] prophet to make sure that that message
[1:07:52] of escape gets to us that we can get
[1:07:54] ready and make preparations the seaman
[1:07:57] Noah made preparations the same way all
[1:07:59] to the aegis
[1:08:00] he made preparations so to we come this
[1:08:03] morning to make preparations to be
[1:08:06] positionally please before the terrible
[1:08:09] big strike to be in position before
[1:08:12] judgment strike we're here this morning
[1:08:14] because of here we are here this one
[1:08:16] because of love we had a pride of jesus
[1:08:18] christ his love his unconditional love
[1:08:21] for us was so great that he overlooked
[1:08:25] our failures overlooked our mistakes
[1:08:27] overlooked our faults overlooked of our
[1:08:30] backsliding overlooked the many
[1:08:32] he didn't pray overlooked the t's you
[1:08:34] didn't read the Bible and he still say I
[1:08:35] love you and I want to marry you
[1:08:38] you still say I love you when your
[1:08:41] thoughts was all messed up his love

[1:16:41] spin antenna watch the two cups because
[1:16:45] he you reach enrich so you feel
[1:16:55] embarrassed when somebody comes I give
[1:16:57] your boss command for the house and be
[1:16:59] like no you know it was excused the
[1:17:01] place excuse me place I am I was really
[1:17:10] able to clean feet last nine months is
[1:17:11] too easy please Jesus not coming I got
[1:17:19] no excuse deep listen
[1:17:30] we talk about a change of behavior
[1:17:33] excuse a place and I start talking about
[1:17:35] wifey last it once we we really can't
[1:17:37] speak until I was like you sir we have
[1:17:41] talked make Jesus welcome because for
[1:17:54] Jesus to be welcomed because Jesus's
[1:17:56] love so the lava has to be there because
[1:18:00] that's what attracts him in on his
[1:18:02] attraction to us is because he so loved
[1:18:04] the world that He gave His only begotten
[1:18:05] Son
[1:18:06] it was love was driving his behavior so
[1:18:11] to make Jesus be welcome there has to be
[1:18:13] love between husband and wife
[1:18:14] love between wife and husband love
[1:18:16] between father and son and anybody in
[1:18:20] the house is anybody in the house this
[1:18:22] morning for Jesus if you welcome the
[1:18:28] love must be reciprocated
[1:18:31] can I speak a little bit I remember a
[1:18:39] few years ago I was preaching about love
[1:18:44] and relationships and and I'm doing
[1:18:45] things and say listen a lot of young
[1:18:47] people think this messages rules and
[1:18:49] rules and rules and regulations by say
[1:18:51] this about love because if you love
[1:18:53] somebody you will do what makes them
[1:18:55] happy so I made the point that in my
[1:18:58] house my wife only white clothes here
[1:19:02] any color clothes but because she wanted
[1:19:03] white clothes here and if I put call
[1:19:05] that only white clothes will get in
[1:19:07] trouble I'm still a work in progress
[1:19:16] the points that colorblind
[1:19:23] but it shouldn't be fear of punishment
[1:19:26] that leads to be white on whites and
[1:19:30] colors and colors it should be love
[1:19:33] makes your behavior to adjust in such a
[1:19:36] way that would make her smile anybody
[1:19:41] everybody with me this morning and the
[1:19:44] converse has to also be true then it
[1:19:47] would be things that I I like my coffee
[1:19:48] a certain way you can feel and to make
[1:19:51] it a way but if you know how I wanna be
[1:19:59] coffee well George if you're making you
[1:20:00] wait and I will get a yes but I'm if
[1:20:06] that's in the natural how much one is
[1:20:07] spiritual because God I thought up we
[1:20:11] should say God bankrupted heaven it's
[1:20:13] greasy wood by giving everything he had
[1:20:15] his only begotten son his love was so
[1:20:17] great he gave everything all that God
[1:20:22] was he wanted to Christ and he sent His
[1:20:25] Christ tone as the greatest gift when he
[1:20:28] searched happened to figure out how they
[1:20:30] express his love the only way you can do
[1:20:32] it is his only begotten son his most
[1:20:35] valuable possession he gave it all to
[1:20:40] redeem man and we in turn want to give
[1:20:44] him a two hours on a Sunday is that what
[1:20:51] love means to you because God is love he
[1:20:56] may be seated that's why I don't take
[1:21:00] issues and by the niccola's helped me
[1:21:02] understand this sometimes in these
[1:21:03] simple things gives us the perspective
[1:21:07] sometimes I think about Nicholas also
[1:21:09] was talking and he was explaining he say
[1:21:12] people I say why us leave your house to
[1:21:15] go all you ate the ground you say well
[1:21:17] some time ago you know sorry either if
[1:21:19] it's him or somebody know he's he had a
[1:21:21] girlfriend in Tahoe or something and he
[1:21:24] said it was leaving he was Merivale to
[1:21:26] go up to Tahoe or whoever and I was
[1:21:29] traveling because he loved was great
[1:21:33] they're not no eztravel but his love was
[1:21:40] so great it was men back in the old days
[1:21:42] before he had what's up on this thing
[1:21:44] yesterday it's a plan D visit it's a
[1:21:46] plan D tribute to see if it yes I leave
[1:21:48] early any morning to make it on time
[1:21:51] what drove that behavior was love if it
[1:21:55] wasn't ready sure he was in love it
[1:21:57] wasn't intentional is this is this
[1:22:04] reaching anybody so if you tell me you
[1:22:09] love God and Jesus went deep I see how
[1:22:13] could you even love Gordeeva Kyle of it
[1:22:14] wasn't next year before God see me and
[1:22:18] you telling people you love me but you
[1:22:20] brought it next year you look at him
[1:22:21] heart is shaky honey I call them pretty
[1:22:23] weak finally will you love me let me
[1:22:29] take down this thing called love because
[1:22:34] we are one body so n1 memory buddy in
[1:22:40] pain you want to feel it and when one
[1:22:43] member is enjoy you ought to feel it too
[1:22:45] because it's one body is a body of
[1:22:47] Christ by one spirit you baptized into
[1:22:49] that one buddy
[1:22:54] so friends this is a encourage you this
[1:22:57] morning this is nothing my notes or
[1:22:59] somebody pulling and I'm healing to the
[1:23:02] pole this morning because this has to
[1:23:04] become a real trust what are you looking
[1:23:05] for preacher I looking for a reality
[1:23:07] that the behavior when people see you
[1:23:10] see me they must take note that
[1:23:11] something is different about us that we
[1:23:16] have been with Jesus because it was
[1:23:18] understood that when you met Jesus your
[1:23:20] life was not the same you can't tell
[1:23:22] people you met Jesus and you live in the
[1:23:25] same way you have yet to meet Jesus
[1:23:29] because when you meet him your behavior
[1:23:31] it's supposed to change your love
[1:23:33] it's supposed to change your worship is
[1:23:36] supposed to change your command
[1:23:37] man is supposed to change somebody
[1:23:40] please talk to me I always find myself
[1:23:48] in these messages where's Nani shout for
[1:23:50] joy and if they kind of coming to your
[1:23:52] house opening doors opening windows
[1:23:54] putting out on any bed it has something
[1:23:58] when they clean and they say I became by
[1:23:59] myself you can you're free that I people
[1:24:01] help you you don't know what you're
[1:24:03] gonna find
[1:24:07] but when you live in Iraq you like no go
[1:24:14] in that door don't know that that leave
[1:24:16] that window do it no not that room just
[1:24:18] clean this clean you know what just
[1:24:19] clean the porch Oh handle everything
[1:24:22] else and you know that we used on your
[1:24:29] life but I better call it on confessing
[1:24:35] Bobby said confess your force wants
[1:24:37] another get it out your system encourage
[1:24:41] one another provoke one another it's
[1:24:48] like that you know there's some people
[1:24:49] he did don't want to marry doctor could
[1:24:56] freely injection we didn't listen we
[1:25:01] deepen when help is when we come to
[1:25:06] church we come for the word begin to
[1:25:08] operate and uncover things that we may
[1:25:11] think it's okay
[1:25:12] that we may think I want you to get this
[1:25:14] done that you think it's okay but it's
[1:25:15] not that's why I drove it always see
[1:25:21] husband's love your wives not as your
[1:25:24] father loved your mother
[1:25:25] but as Christ loved the church because
[1:25:29] we measure things based on our
[1:25:31] experiences we measure things based on
[1:25:34] our knowledge we measure things based on
[1:25:36] our understanding but God has a way and
[1:25:39] our objective of coming to church as to
[1:25:41] see his way not my way
[1:25:43] nutty pastas way is way
[1:25:46] the way he operates because we want to
[1:25:48] be like him can the tread salmon and no
[1:25:58] wonder the Prophet does a full obedience
[1:26:00] to the entire Word of God
[1:26:02] it's what entitles you to the token
[1:26:04] because full of penis of the word will
[1:26:07] bring you into subjection to the would
[1:26:10] Wheaton for dynamics that come upon the
[1:26:12] mechanics but the mechanics part is your
[1:26:15] part the dynamics part is his part can
[1:26:20] the church say man anybody everybody's
[1:26:27] gonna find this morning could we could
[1:26:29] we go somewhere nice I see I see
[1:26:31] background i already i already i really
[1:26:34] attending afternoon looking for change
[1:26:40] of behavior and god will test us and
[1:26:45] they told us that devil will also test
[1:26:47] and make you prove every one of these
[1:26:50] virtues so you have tests comment from
[1:26:53] every side to prove these virtues are
[1:26:56] operating in you before he can seal the
[1:26:59] whole thing so it must be proven before
[1:27:01] the final ceiling before charity comes a
[1:27:03] bundler perfection to compete the whole
[1:27:06] thing I'd say this is a finished work
[1:27:10] can the church say man and in order for
[1:27:14] you to even be here this morning you
[1:27:16] have to be led by the spirit just like
[1:27:20] Simeon was led by this bird you shall
[1:27:22] not see death until you see the Lord's
[1:27:23] Christ semen was living comfortable
[1:27:25] because he knew that he couldn't die
[1:27:27] until you see the Lord's Christ
[1:27:29] Brian Anna without having eyes to see
[1:27:33] the natural was led by the spirit to
[1:27:35] identify Messiah wasn't it that's being
[1:27:39] led by the spirit but about having a
[1:27:42] message expectation the same reason that
[1:27:43] you're here tonight I said today you
[1:27:45] sick people the same Holy Ghost that
[1:27:48] let's see me on the same Holy Ghost and
[1:27:50] let Anna has let you here for you
[1:27:53] believer there's a fountain open
[1:27:55] somewhere for healing
[1:27:56] it's here God moving amongst his people
[1:27:59] and it's people believing so the Holy
[1:28:02] Spirit could only lead you to truth the
[1:28:05] Holy Spirit could only leave it's an act
[1:28:07] right yet come and tell me you spurned
[1:28:09] have your aching body you misbehave and
[1:28:12] say in a spirit so if you are if you
[1:28:16] have the Holy Ghost you looking for the
[1:28:17] Holy Ghost there's evidence of that you
[1:28:19] know your behavior supposed to be
[1:28:21] speaking to that you can't be losing
[1:28:24] your cool you breaking up your house
[1:28:26] your match something than see is what
[1:28:32] the Holy Spirit will not lead you
[1:28:34] sisters to cut you here try to put up
[1:28:38] makeup trying to look like the wall and
[1:28:41] could imagine if Jesus is welcome in
[1:28:44] your room and you there trying to pick
[1:28:45] up I'm put up something on your face to
[1:28:47] do it wouldn't you feel embarrassed
[1:28:52] because I see sometimes people who say
[1:28:55] they believe when they meet on your own
[1:28:57] and when they recognizes me over to move
[1:29:00] it over Anthony they comfortable look at
[1:29:05] you from the corner because they don't
[1:29:06] hear so if a man would make you feel
[1:29:12] that way how should go and make you for
[1:29:14] you as you go to every decision of your
[1:29:17] life your schoolwork your business life
[1:29:22] your career you can't operate like the
[1:29:25] word in the corporate world people wanna
[1:29:28] stab in the back and do this and do that
[1:29:29] it's not what God teaches we're dying
[1:29:32] holders work here you know so and you
[1:29:34] will risk your experience with God
[1:29:37] because any waiting world operates on
[1:29:39] your job or in school or whatever this
[1:29:43] one to break this possession of this
[1:29:44] compartmentalization of God to your
[1:29:46] church experience but as when you're
[1:29:49] alone and nobody else is around
[1:29:52] is your true test of who you are
[1:29:57] when your wife not tell your children
[1:29:59] that there nobody else is there who can
[1:30:01] hold you to a higher expectation then
[1:30:05] you real you stands up and that's what
[1:30:10] we have to tell us what the tutor that's
[1:30:12] when the whole is pretty tutor wants to
[1:30:14] see your behavior he really wants to see
[1:30:18] you behavior when nobody else is around
[1:30:19] to see how you will conduct yourself and
[1:30:22] this is what we are fighting for friends
[1:30:25] the church is a born-again bunch of
[1:30:28] believers that's in Christ by the Holy
[1:30:30] Ghost
[1:30:31] led by the Spirit of God that's sweeter
[1:30:34] than Jubilee they are not of the world
[1:30:36] they are out of the world they are
[1:30:38] different from the world I've preached
[1:30:40] this before it cannot be that you are
[1:30:42] like the world or you want to be like
[1:30:44] the world or you want to act like the
[1:30:46] world the Bible said if you love the
[1:30:49] world and the love of God is not even in
[1:30:51] you not even in you come to church say
[1:30:54] man that's what makes them what they are
[1:30:57] their life is dead and they're hidden
[1:30:59] Christ dead in Christ and hidden sealed
[1:31:01] by the Holy Ghost they're away from the
[1:31:04] things of the world from the message
[1:31:06] expectations sons of God are led by the
[1:31:08] Spirit of God not led by some other
[1:31:11] fanatics or some organization or
[1:31:13] something other they are led by the
[1:31:15] Spirit of God the Holy Spirit was given
[1:31:17] to the church to be the overseer the
[1:31:20] tutor that was to raise the children of
[1:31:22] God not our bishops and Cardinals and so
[1:31:24] forth but the Holy Ghost and by the
[1:31:27] brennaman said and this is his
[1:31:28] expectation he had a word for us I'm
[1:31:30] expecting the Holy Ghost not
[1:31:32] denomination not a bishop not a Catholic
[1:31:36] priest not a Baptist preacher or a
[1:31:38] Pentecostal preacher I'm expecting the
[1:31:40] Holy Ghost to come and set in order a
[1:31:42] church that will go to meet him filled
[1:31:45] with the power and the resurrection of
[1:31:47] Christ I'm expecting that I believe that
[1:31:50] God promised that that there'd be a
[1:31:53] church dear without spot or wrinkle on
[1:31:55] it I'm expecting it because God said it
[1:31:59] was so and my
[1:32:01] shall not return unto me void and the
[1:32:05] church Amen hallelujah hallelujah
[1:32:10] hallelujah
[1:32:11] I remember preaching a message God has
[1:32:15] never changed his strategy hallelujah
[1:32:18] cuz he's a senior student today on
[1:32:19] forever I am girl and I changed not so
[1:32:22] the way he operates the operators same
[1:32:24] way every time and the devil still
[1:32:26] doesn't get it that even though gonna
[1:32:28] pray the same way every single time the
[1:32:31] devil still can't figure out how God
[1:32:32] operates hallelujah Roma's eat certain
[1:32:35] moreover whom he did predestinate Demi
[1:32:38] also called and whom he called them he
[1:32:41] also justified and whom he justified
[1:32:43] them he also glorified
[1:32:46] because he predestinated you because he
[1:32:49] thought knew you he could predestinate
[1:32:51] you because he predestinated you he
[1:32:53] called you because he called you he
[1:32:55] justified you and listen these words are
[1:32:58] all past answer let me read again I want
[1:33:05] it is not future tense or presidency no
[1:33:07] more room moreover whom he did
[1:33:09] predestinate them he also called past
[1:33:10] tense and whom he called Demi also
[1:33:13] justified past tense and whom he
[1:33:15] justified them he also glorified past
[1:33:18] tense so God does not know predestinated
[1:33:20] no Collin no justifying not no he
[1:33:25] already did it so your destination of
[1:33:28] glory is guaranteed he is speaking as a
[1:33:31] finished work what demon what devil
[1:33:34] worked out what past what mystic can
[1:33:37] separate you from the love of God
[1:33:40] hallelujah
[1:33:42] nothing Pass nothing present nothing
[1:33:51] hallelujah everybody feeling fine Oh
[1:33:56] hallelujah
[1:34:01] in a message a guide and I love this
[1:34:04] quote because god unbearable said God
[1:34:07] has never changed his strategy never
[1:34:11] change it and Satan has never changes so
[1:34:14] this is a pallet confusing me but a
[1:34:16] George F Court hasn't changed on the G
[1:34:19] and by the varsity devil cartina
[1:34:21] strategy and God always winning
[1:34:24] and the devil have no room to change
[1:34:27] because that means God will win
[1:34:30] everything every single time so this is
[1:34:34] a rigged game and we know the result
[1:34:36] before he can play every day every day
[1:34:40] we know the outcome enough
[1:34:43] every single day we know the outcome
[1:34:50] every single day we know the outcome and
[1:34:52] what's the confirmation of it I want you
[1:34:54] to get this for a minute you may be
[1:34:56] seated
[1:34:57] I love somebody speaking recently about
[1:34:59] Jesus people know Jesus as the healer
[1:35:00] people Lord Jesus as he as Jesus who was
[1:35:04] asleep on the boat and that's wonderful
[1:35:05] but he see the resurrected Christ
[1:35:09] because within Judaism and the aslam
[1:35:13] atif other groups they recognize Jesus
[1:35:14] as prophet what they have problem with
[1:35:17] is you resurrected eyes because they
[1:35:20] have no problem with Jesus as prophet
[1:35:22] but they have a probably resurrected
[1:35:25] Christ because he resurrected Christ is
[1:35:27] the one that break them all of all the
[1:35:29] other prophets all Jude Jesus ministry
[1:35:33] it was calling him good master calling
[1:35:35] him teacher that's funny how does it
[1:35:37] address the others rabbi teacher master
[1:35:40] ela this donnelly Jews were would not
[1:35:43] knowledge about our miracles they knew
[1:35:45] miracles so Jesus did a miracle wasn't
[1:35:48] really a big big big thing in context
[1:35:51] because they knew they had miracles
[1:35:52] before but is he when Jesus died and he
[1:35:56] put your word before he died he said
[1:35:58] destroy this temple and she is already
[1:36:00] back up again them kind of things is
[1:36:02] what people have problem with dies
[1:36:04] eating the devil really our issue
[1:36:06] because when Jesus died Jesus the Bible
[1:36:11] said no sin but in all of him to get the
[1:36:14] pass the ticket to get to hell because I
[1:36:17] had to get a ticket to go to hell the
[1:36:18] card is going to hell
[1:36:19] you had to have sin to go to hell but
[1:36:21] Jesus inhabitation so he had to find him
[1:36:24] and Jesus taught there such a collection
[1:36:28] to get a ticket
[1:36:30] he took the sin from the class the same
[1:36:33] from the present listen from the future
[1:36:35] and he said taking all of it and I put
[1:36:38] in on this ship because I want nobody to
[1:36:40] question my ticket to get down into hell
[1:36:43] because what Jesus was going for was
[1:36:45] beyond just Redemption
[1:36:47] he was going for Authority and power
[1:36:49] because the Bible said all power in
[1:36:52] heaven and earth was given unto him but
[1:36:54] the devil was rolling some keys so when
[1:36:59] Jesus reached they couldn't stop him
[1:37:01] from walking inside because he was
[1:37:03] sinful but he was the only one who could
[1:37:05] walk in and walk back out for the first
[1:37:08] time someone could walk in and walk back
[1:37:11] out he walking and man handling security
[1:37:14] walking and manually bodyguards walk
[1:37:17] straight past the bodyguards straight to
[1:37:20] the temple and took the keys turn back
[1:37:24] around unluckier ham unlock Isaiah I'm
[1:37:28] not - well I'm not listen I want you to
[1:37:31] picture it and nobody could move because
[1:37:34] they never saw this before Jesus was
[1:37:37] doing what had never been done before
[1:37:38] all the demons in Hell want to know who
[1:37:41] is this who is this who is the king of
[1:37:44] glory the Lord mighty in battle he had
[1:37:47] come town can the church say man
[1:37:53] [Applause]
[1:37:56] maybe she did
[1:37:58] I had preached about this before God's
[1:38:02] Dominion is heaven
[1:38:03] he put man truly it man's dominion is
[1:38:07] the it that's why you have to pray
[1:38:09] because God don't operate without prayer
[1:38:11] God don't move without a request
[1:38:13] somebody have to cry and I have to cry
[1:38:15] the Turner's have to cry somebody a
[1:38:17] little it has to do something to
[1:38:19] activate cord to move on the scene it
[1:38:21] takes a human it takes a man a son in
[1:38:24] position to activate the glories
[1:38:26] activate the power cord doesn't get
[1:38:28] struck down unless somebody makes a
[1:38:30] request that's what he called to Moses
[1:38:32] he said I've heard the cries of my
[1:38:34] people
[1:38:35] and I've come down because man has
[1:38:37] dominion somebody preached back to me
[1:38:40] [Applause]
[1:38:44] you see the bear in mind that's fallen
[1:38:47] man magnesium is falling man that's
[1:38:50] money each one of the Holy Ghost
[1:38:52] that's money native living and soon
[1:38:53] that's man Anita before the fullest of
[1:38:56] the atonement and yet still deer cries
[1:38:58] interrupted heaven and cause go to drop
[1:39:01] down on the earth because somebody had
[1:39:02] activated his presence or somebody
[1:39:05] preached back to me so in order to
[1:39:12] fulfill the plan of redemption God had
[1:39:14] to find a body that's why he had to get
[1:39:17] Jesus he had to put a sperm inside of
[1:39:20] Mary and by the bottom said he picks it
[1:39:22] all together himself so he can have a
[1:39:24] buddy he could use so now this body
[1:39:26] could give it everything you don't need
[1:39:28] somebody else who don't understand your
[1:39:30] plan so Jesus can all see when you see
[1:39:32] me you see the father we think in the
[1:39:34] same way we are the same page we know I
[1:39:37] am here my always not yet come
[1:39:43] because Jesus on a mission to bring
[1:39:46] deliverance to set the captives free
[1:39:48] to comfort him that morn he was the
[1:39:51] prophet of prophets the teacher of
[1:39:53] teacher the master of master the King of
[1:39:55] Kings the Lord of lords
[1:39:57] wrapped up in human flesh and he was
[1:40:00] vulnerable he was tired he was weak he
[1:40:04] fell asleep and this great Court stood
[1:40:06] in front of Lazarus grave and wept and
[1:40:09] when he shook back his head he activated
[1:40:11] who was inside of him he said Lazarus
[1:40:14] come forth I'm gonna brand him said if
[1:40:16] he didn't see Lazarus every dead every
[1:40:20] dead person was gonna wake up everybody
[1:40:27] would be this morning
[1:40:31] so what are you afraid of this morning
[1:40:34] no wonder pork is here these workers
[1:40:36] said death where is your sting grave
[1:40:38] what a victory talk about because even
[1:40:42] if I die listen it's just me speedily
[1:40:45] gettin to bite you often in this this
[1:40:50] wretched man that I am this flesh man I
[1:40:52] am here on a mission they have no fear
[1:40:57] no fear
[1:41:00] George scripture you know what do you
[1:41:02] want the most common thing jesus said
[1:41:03] fear not fear not fear not and then in
[1:41:06] the New Testament literally say four
[1:41:08] corners have given us the spirit of but
[1:41:11] a spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba
[1:41:13] Father so what are you afraid of don't
[1:41:16] be afraid you're gonna make it
[1:41:18] don't be afraid you're gonna be healed
[1:41:20] don't be afraid whatever you do shall
[1:41:23] prosper don't be afraid keep walking on
[1:41:25] the promise don't be afraid of ten
[1:41:27] thousand and falling your eyesight or
[1:41:29] whatever I shall not be moved
[1:41:31] keep your eyes like flint I'm going to
[1:41:33] the rapture I'm going to the
[1:41:35] resurrection I want to have a revival my
[1:41:37] son is coming
[1:41:38] my daughter is coming my wife is gonna
[1:41:40] be delivered that's our promise
[1:41:44] hallelujah so God always needs somebody
[1:41:52] if God didn't need anybody could have
[1:41:54] operated without humans but he needs
[1:41:57] somebody so he called Paul a Pharisee of
[1:42:01] Pharisees nod man who was not there when
[1:42:04] Jesus was there and keep his mind a
[1:42:10] mission and when he was called and
[1:42:12] brothers have an issue with him God has
[1:42:14] two things go ahead I get that nice but
[1:42:15] who was there when he was a boy he
[1:42:18] picked Paul he picked Paul who brothers
[1:42:23] had issue with him even when positive
[1:42:26] priest reading by what anybody still a
[1:42:27] issue with Paul because they was
[1:42:29] thinking back when Paul was free
[1:42:30] to them and they remember the Steven and
[1:42:34] when Paul was there and Paul is Manson
[1:42:36] killerman
[1:42:37] when they say it so it might something
[1:42:39] bad but but God was showing that when he
[1:42:44] take a hold of somebody you can't judge
[1:42:46] that person by your human eyes poor was
[1:42:50] a tiny right hand of God
[1:42:52] a messenger time age and God Paul
[1:42:57] Iranians Martin Columbo loser Wesley and
[1:43:00] in our age he sent a prophet 20th
[1:43:03] century prophet simple man small
[1:43:06] minority education but God speaking
[1:43:08] first to that man and then through the
[1:43:10] man these son of man field and a son of
[1:43:15] man and everybody is speaking a spoken
[1:43:18] word the original seed words that cannot
[1:43:22] fall to the ground words that must come
[1:43:24] to pass words that somebody will catch
[1:43:28] word that somebody will hold on to words
[1:43:32] that will change your life words that
[1:43:35] would interrupt the plans of the devil
[1:43:37] would that would pronounce healing can
[1:43:41] the church seem
[1:43:43] whoa hallelujah
[1:43:46] oh I'm not gonna be too much longer with
[1:43:50] you Oh hallelujah God gave the promises
[1:43:56] and he is able to keep his promises and
[1:43:58] when God give the promise to Abraham in
[1:44:01] a message convinced and concerned he
[1:44:02] said he would possess the kids of his
[1:44:04] enemies and so shunga believed that he
[1:44:07] destroyer Sunderland and look at the
[1:44:09] odds against him court only needs one
[1:44:11] man just let him get one man in his hand
[1:44:14] the world will think he's crazy but he
[1:44:16] will drive home the gospel when he's
[1:44:19] thoroughly convinced that Jesus Christ
[1:44:21] remains the same yesterday today and
[1:44:23] forever
[1:44:23] aiyoo thoroughly convinced that he's a
[1:44:26] same yesterday today and forever because

[1:44:42] on because he's thoroughly convinced
[1:44:45] that God is good and if he ever was

[1:45:05] Daniel out of the lion's den the same
[1:45:08] God that brought the Hebrew children
[1:45:09] from the fiery furnace he's the same God
[1:45:12] that raised up Jesus Christ on Easter
[1:45:15] morning he's the same God that friendly
[1:45:17] at Pentecost he's the same God that
[1:45:20] raised Lazarus out the crib he's ashamed
[1:45:22] yesterday today and forever and I'm
[1:45:25] convinced that this is the Holy Ghost
[1:45:27] [Music]
[1:45:29] hallelujah my my my my he's the same
[1:45:35] yesterday he's the same today he's the
[1:45:37] same forever he's the same quarter when
[1:45:39] Joshua says sunshield and see the
[1:45:42] salvation of God and his son stand right
[1:45:45] there
[1:45:45] he's a shame gonna meet it come to pass
[1:45:47] he's a simcard that was there when you
[1:45:49] were born in the hospital room or in the
[1:45:52] house he was there to make sure your
[1:45:54] delivery was all right he's a simcard
[1:45:56] the place that he went to school he was
[1:45:59] there to make sure you went to school he
[1:46:02] was there when you got up this morning
[1:46:03] and started your car he was dead he's
[1:46:07] there all the time and he promised to
[1:46:10] never leave you he promised to never
[1:46:12] forsake you he promised to be with you
[1:46:16] Peter said in the day of Pentecost this
[1:46:18] is that and if this isn't that I'll keep
[1:46:21] this till that comes for I believe this
[1:46:24] is that I'm convinced that it's the
[1:46:26] gospel and the power and the
[1:46:28] demonstration of the resurrection of the
[1:46:30] appearing of the Lord Jesus in this last
[1:46:33] day making the church ready to be caught
[1:46:36] away in the pride see in a message
[1:46:42] future home of the heavenly bridegroom
[1:46:44] and his Hebrides see his plan of
[1:46:46] redemption is exactly the same by
[1:46:48] everything he uses the same method he
[1:46:51] never changes he said in Malachi 3 I am
[1:46:54] God and I changed not the way he does it
[1:46:57] therefore if he saved the first man he
[1:46:59] ever saved by the shed blood of an
[1:47:01] innocent one you have to save the next
[1:47:03] one and everyone he saves will have to
[1:47:06] be the same way if he healed a man at
[1:47:08] any time to the journey of life let it
[1:47:10] be the tears of Jesus the Apostles the
[1:47:13] prophets whenever it was when the same
[1:47:15] conditions is meant he's got to do it
[1:47:18] again that's right he doesn't change man
[1:47:21] changes time changes it changes
[1:47:24] dispensation changes but God remains the
[1:47:27] same he is perfect what our hope that
[1:47:30] ought to give the sick people if he ever
[1:47:33] healed a person he has to do it again
[1:47:35] when the scene
[1:47:37] is met he ever say the man he's got to
[1:47:40] do it under cm grounds he did it the
[1:47:42] first time if he ever fell a man with
[1:47:44] the Holy Ghost he's got to do it in the
[1:47:46] same grounds he did it the first time if
[1:47:48] he ever raised a manner from the grave
[1:47:50] he's got to do it the second time and
[1:47:52] every other time on the same principle
[1:47:55] he doesn't change
[1:47:56] oh what a hope that gives me what is it
[1:47:59] nothing some man-made theory something
[1:48:02] that groups of men have come together
[1:48:03] but his unchangeable would let every
[1:48:06] man's will be a lie and mind be true for
[1:48:09] heaven and earth will pass away but my
[1:48:11] word shall never feel all Scripture is
[1:48:14] given my inspiration therefore is good
[1:48:17] and profitable for doctrine all
[1:48:19] scripture will be fulfilled every bit of
[1:48:21] it that's what the Prophet said can the
[1:48:23] church say Amen
[1:48:25] everybody feeling fine just a little
[1:48:29] more we're done God's strategy is to
[1:48:37] take empty human vessels and shake the
[1:48:41] world with them just a little bit and
[1:48:44] we'll go as a prophet saying like a
[1:48:46] Pentecost what did he do it taken them
[1:48:48] 10d is to get all emptied up but it was
[1:48:51] all standing there where their vessels
[1:48:53] turned up and God took himself and
[1:48:55] filled them up that's all they shook the
[1:48:57] wood poured himself into them the same
[1:49:01] Holy Spirit that see the Lutheran's that
[1:49:03] sanctify the Methodists that baptize the
[1:49:06] Pentecostals is now setting in order the
[1:49:08] coming of the Lord Jesus and the
[1:49:10] manifestation of the Holy Spirit is that
[1:49:12] angel trying to get the people back and
[1:49:17] one is here we are in the end time come
[1:49:20] from the east or west north south what
[1:49:22] are we doing getting ready for that
[1:49:24] rapture getting ready holding ourselves
[1:49:26] steady for a few minutes till every
[1:49:30] fiber is filled with the Holy Ghost is
[1:49:32] that your prayer this morning
[1:49:34] that every fiber is filled with the
[1:49:39] holiness is that your expectation and
[1:49:42] every fiber is filled with the Holy
[1:49:45] Ghost it's all over you at all in you
[1:49:48] it's all around you it's you are so M
[1:49:52] Dida but he could fill every part of you
[1:49:54] with his present with his love with his
[1:49:56] glory
[1:49:57] that's my expedition that's my prayer
[1:49:58] that's my desires and your desire this
[1:50:01] morning can the church say Amen glory
[1:50:08] hallelujah hallelujah in a message of
[1:50:13] paradox just to bring this home my word
[1:50:16] shall not retail void he said in every
[1:50:18] age there have been some of it left off
[1:50:20] so he's saying the reformer didn't have
[1:50:22] time to take care of it in the days of
[1:50:24] luta he only preached Jessie because of
[1:50:26] my feet and he was gone they made a
[1:50:28] church after that come Wesley he
[1:50:30] presented occasion there was an Along
[1:50:32] Came the Pentecostals but we are
[1:50:34] promised according to revelation 10 a
[1:50:37] quantumatic eye falls in Luke 22 17 and
[1:50:39] so forth that has got to come any
[1:50:41] visions of this there's promise of
[1:50:44] friends that must come in Ephesians that
[1:50:46] these Sevenfold mysteries of the Word of
[1:50:48] God must be unfolded and it's in the
[1:50:50] Laodicean age that this takes place and
[1:50:52] I believe that we are here we are here
[1:50:56] at another Ephesians we are here at
[1:51:00] another dispensation we are here at
[1:51:03] another time when the closing and the
[1:51:05] finishing of everything is at hand
[1:51:07] what's going on the world the political
[1:51:09] arena Wars rumors of wars earthquakes

[1:53:29] were ready Lambs ready trim already
[1:53:34] ready they are not taking chances
[1:53:38] they learned too much preaching to take
[1:53:41] a chance then the cry went to be all the

[1:53:51] the file of all wise they were already
[1:53:54] one time I'm ready
[1:53:56] the foolish didn't know they're supposed
[1:53:59] to get ready and then they say well

[1:54:31] it's time to get ready it's time to get
[1:54:35] ready are you ready it's time to get
[1:54:39] ready because his wood cannot feel he
[1:54:42] doesn't change his strategy he will not
[1:54:45] get you ready you have to get these
[1:54:47] already his wife has made herself ready
[1:54:50] the word is there the instructions he
[1:54:52] had a plan for the dress the plan for
[1:54:53] how to operate how to live how to act
[1:54:55] his nature is being his actually which
[1:54:57] is all in the word how it was operate in
[1:55:02] the days of Esther when Esther they were
[1:55:04] being when I'd been chosen and had been
[1:55:06] been prepared to go to the king there
[1:55:08] all are you not send me preparing them
[1:55:10] to go and meet the king the eunuchs had
[1:55:18] no see the unit's were just there to
[1:55:19] prepare him because they knew what the
[1:55:21] Kings desire was so their message and
[1:55:24] their ministry was just to get to get
[1:55:26] the potentials ready
[1:55:34] for the king to choose and you read it
[1:55:39] they could have taken whatever
[1:55:41] adornments they want and I still didn't
[1:55:44] choose none of the jewelry none of the
[1:55:45] makeup none of the fancies you say
[1:55:47] whatever the King would wonder whatever
[1:55:48] you recommend but I'm gonna wear this
[1:55:49] other stuff and when the King saw us we
[1:55:51] chose it wasn't coming from the king and
[1:55:56] you meet the one already this this guy

[1:56:16] expectation your own way of how it's
[1:56:18] supposed to be no you come to hear the
[1:56:19] word for the word to have an effect in

[1:56:30] day you supposed to be more ready than
[1:56:32] last week and next week more ready than
[1:56:35] this week but you can't go backwards may
[1:56:39] you can really lock your position I'm
[1:56:41] not going backward this is not the time
[1:56:44] to backslide not the time to give up
[1:56:46] because his Woollett kind of returns
[1:56:48] void and his wood is hanging over
[1:56:50] families his word is hanging over
[1:56:52] churches his word already said go to the
[1:56:57] city and put the mark upon those that
[1:56:59] sigh and cry for the abomination in the
[1:57:01] city that word has already gone forth
[1:57:05] and it was said begin that my sanctuary
[1:57:07] any ancient man that would is already
[1:57:12] going out and his work country to the
[1:57:14] void but to them that sigh and cry to
[1:57:18] tell them that seek his face his wood is
[1:57:20] also true to them he will visit them for
[1:57:23] them that I'm looking for the Holy Ghost
[1:57:24] he will visit them but then they are
[1:57:26] hungering and thirsting after
[1:57:27] righteousness he will visit them because
[1:57:30] first minions are hunger and thirst
[1:57:32] after righteousness they shall be filled
[1:57:34] that word cannot return void it must
[1:57:38] accomplish the purpose
[1:57:41] hallelujah hallelujah the musician to
[1:57:45] get ready I'm almost done
[1:58:01] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:58:11] hallelujah hallelujah Oh blessed be
[1:58:21] Adam had lost a book it was a book of
[1:58:25] authority it was a book of flower it was
[1:58:28] a book of names Adam was supposed to
[1:58:30] open the book and speak from the book
[1:58:32] and when he called names they ought to
[1:58:34] be created but Adam lost it when he fell
[1:58:37] and Satan tried to grab it but his book
[1:58:42] was to slip through his hands
[1:58:44] only certain hands could handle the book
[1:58:47] or he sitting eyes could see the book so
[1:58:50] the book went back into the hands of the
[1:58:51] original owner and we needed a redeemer
[1:58:56] to come and be a kinsman redeemer to
[1:59:00] fully open back access to this book so
[1:59:03] John had wept when he was caught up and
[1:59:06] I mentioned because there was nobody
[1:59:07] worried to loose the seals and to open
[1:59:11] this book
[1:59:12] no wonder John shouted when they said
[1:59:16] Behold a little tribe of Judah and the
[1:59:18] lamb started to come out and all the
[1:59:20] whole thing unfolded
[1:59:21] because John knew without redemption
[1:59:23] there was no possibility and all of this
[1:59:31] that God didn't manifest through his
[1:59:33] prophets was to bring the word for us
[1:59:35] that we could have comfort in this day
[1:59:37] that we could make it
[1:59:41] whenever Adam said in Israel and the
[1:59:43] truth I believe in the truth in his Road
[1:59:45] tonight a power of the Living God and
[1:59:47] mid will speak the wood here and they
[1:59:48] are little flash like lightning and the
[1:59:51] church is coming out not a psychologist
[1:59:53] not some of this put on make-believe but
[1:59:55] a real true genuine anointed holy Eagles
[1:59:58] called out Church that's what I'm
[2:00:01] looking for
[2:00:02] can the church say man is that right
[2:00:05] wait and God trying to please his church
[2:00:08] in position to manifest himself you
[2:00:10] begin play something soft
[2:00:12] one day the Wrightwood will be spoken
[2:00:14] but at random said and the right thing
[2:00:18] will be done and we were - into the
[2:00:20] presence of God candid should see man
[2:00:24] Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah and
