[23:15] man shall it not be in the day when I
[23:18] took from them their strength the joy of
[23:21] their glory the desire of the eyes and
[23:24] that whereupon they set their minds
[23:27] their sons and the daughters that he

[24:04] righteousness of God and our Savior
[24:06] Jesus Christ grace and peace be
[24:08] multiplied unto you to the knowledge of
[24:10] God and our Jesus our Lord
[24:12] according as his divine power had given
[24:15] to us all things that pertain unto life
[24:17] and godliness through the knowledge of
[24:20] him that call us to glory and virtue
[24:22] whereby a given to us exceeding great
[24:25] and precious promises that by deeds he
[24:28] might be partakers of the divine nature
[24:30] having escaped the corruption that is in
[24:32] the world through lust and besides this
[24:35] given all diligence up to your faith

[24:47] things be in you and abound they shall
[24:49] make you leti shall neither be barren on
[24:51] full knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ
[24:53] but he had lack of these things is blind
[24:55] cannot see a foul
[24:57] had forgotten that he was putting
[24:58] resolved since wherefore the rather
[25:00] brethren give diligence to make your
[25:02] call and election sure for if we do
[25:04] these things he shall never fall may God
[25:07] bless his word you may be seated
[25:08] our title tonight the escaped ones let's
[25:13] that have that the escape one the
[25:15] escaped ones and you know America
[25:21] started off as a lamb and the Bible
[25:23] speaks that he would speak like a dragon
[25:24] and what we have seen unfold in being
[25:28] fought be if we are not writing for the
[25:30] eyes is the dismantling of democracy
[25:35] that's what you see in the dismantling
[25:37] of democracy it has to happen because
[25:40] the lamb have to speak like a dragon and
[25:42] things have to happen to turn a lamb in
[25:45] the dragon and the Prophet said there
[25:48] were raised up a pharaoh that knew not
[25:51] Joseph and Joseph represent freedom of
[25:55] religion see so therefore it will be a
[25:59] force system and take away the freedom
[26:02] from the people freedom of religion and
[26:05] I want to just go back to Revelation
[26:08] chapter 13 and read something from the
[26:11] earth to his tree said I saw one of his
[26:13] heads talking about the beasts it was
[26:14] wounded to death and his deadly wound
[26:16] was healed and all the world wondered
[26:19] after the Beast and they will ship the
[26:22] Dragon which gave power unto the beasts
[26:25] so the beasts have to be empowered let's
[26:28] continue let's go and they worshipped
[26:30] the Beast saying who is like unto the
[26:32] Beast who is able to walk with him and
[26:37] there was given unto him a mouth
[26:39] speaking great things and blasphemies
[26:42] and power was given unto him to continue
[26:46] forty and two months and he open his
[26:49] mouth and blasphemy against God the
[26:51] blasphemous name his tabernacle and them
[26:54] that dwell in heaven and was given unto
[26:56] him to make war with the Saints and to
[26:59] overcome them and power was given on
[27:03] him over all Kindred's and tongues and
[27:06] Nations
[27:07] this is not skim milk this is the word
[27:10] we're eating you know and all that dwell
[27:13] upon the earth shall worship Him whose
[27:15] names are not written in the book of
[27:18] life of the lamb slain from the
[27:20] foundation of the world not some all
[27:24] therefore all those who will escape
[27:28] that's you know the bride gonna be the
[27:32] ones that are gonna be not gonna escape
[27:34] on everybody else going to worship the
[27:38] beasts and the B system watch if any man
[27:42] an a let him hear he that liveth
[27:44] leadeth into captivity shall go into
[27:46] captivity he that killeth with the sword
[27:48] must be killed with the sword here is
[27:50] the patience and the faith of the saints
[27:52] and I beheld another beast coming out of
[27:54] the earth he had two horns like a lamb
[27:56] and he speaks as a dragon and he
[27:59] exerciseth all the power of the first
[28:03] beast before him and causeth the earth
[28:06] and them that dwell therein to worship
[28:08] the first beast whose deadly wound was
[28:10] healed where she Noah's Pig and Rome
[28:12] turn to Papa room let's continue and he
[28:15] do a great wonders so he maketh Fire
[28:17] come down from heaven on the earth in
[28:19] the sight of men and did he see that
[28:20] them that dwell on the earth by the
[28:22] means of those miracles which he had
[28:23] power to do in the sight of the Beast
[28:25] seen unto them that dwell on the earth
[28:26] that they should make an image to the
[28:29] beasts which had the wound by a sword
[28:32] and did live hallelujah
[28:35] make what image unto the Beast and he
[28:39] had power to give life unto the image of
[28:41] the Beast so the image to our power in
[28:43] itself the image has to be given power
[28:46] hallelujah hallelujah and he had power
[28:50] to give life under the image of the
[28:52] Beast that the image of the Beast should
[28:54] both speak and cause that as many as
[28:57] would not worship the image of the Beast
[28:59] should be killed and he causeth all both
[29:02] small and great rich and poor free and
[29:06] bond to receive a mark in their right
[29:09] hand or in their foreheads
[29:11] that no man might buy or sell save he
[29:14] that had the mark or
[29:16] the name of the beast or the number of
[29:18] his name
[29:19] here his wisdom let him that had
[29:21] understanding Kong the number of the
[29:23] beast for it is a number of a man is
[29:25] number six hundred threescore and six
[29:27] 666 it's not something tonight all glory
[29:31] to God to the Bible identify the image
[29:33] and to the beasts or praise God you know
[29:35] and the thing of it is in the beginning
[29:37] in Genesis God said let us make man in
[29:39] our image and likeness hallelujah and
[29:42] God put an image with first created
[29:44] image isn't that right
[29:46] once the flesh man yet and God put this
[29:48] flesh man in the body isn't that right
[29:50] that man couldn't feel that man could
[29:52] not fall that was the original man
[29:55] isn't that right and got completed
[29:57] creation with a man that was in power a
[29:59] man that was in Dominion because the man
[30:02] himself as a son had a reflect God and
[30:05] to reflect God you have to influence his
[30:06] attributes so he said let us make man
[30:08] let her have dominion over over over
[30:11] over everything that creepeth upon the
[30:12] earth so man wasn't was supposed to be a
[30:15] conqueror overcomer a Dominator is that
[30:19] right hallelujah man was supposed to be
[30:21] in control of in charge of ruling over
[30:25] that was man and God's original intent
[30:28] but you a by-product because Eve was a
[30:31] by-product of the man hallelujah she was
[30:34] not in the original she pulled out of e
[30:36] a man and that became the woman isn't it
[30:39] right
[30:39] Satan didn't approach the man he
[30:41] approached the woman we know the story
[30:42] and man fell but God promised to restore
[30:45] brains got your gets caught in that
[30:48] God promised to restore because court
[30:50] had a plan to bring right man right back
[30:53] [Applause]
[30:57] and I've got news for you tonight you
[31:01] live in in the verge of the
[31:03] manifestation of the fulfillment of the
[31:06] plan that God had since man fell God
[31:09] always was going to bring back man back
[31:12] to his original condition back to his
[31:14] first created image so just as a piece
[31:16] of an image we have an image that images
[31:19] faith virtue knowledge temperance
[31:23] patience godliness brotherly kindness
[31:25] charity is men right and the mystery of
[31:29] God come down from God as the word of
[31:31] God and the world is being preached and
[31:33] the world come as a seed and that image
[31:36] coming to you in seed form by the word
[31:39] of promises and Peter said by these
[31:41] promises not by these explanation by
[31:44] these promises you have become a potato
[31:47] of His divine nature but power total
[31:51] power power after commentator image and
[31:54] we are promised dynamics we are promised
[31:57] charity we are promised the price
[31:59] absolute isn't that right power down Oh
[32:04] hallelujah hallelujah two images going
[32:10] to be empowered you may be seated praise
[32:13] God the ears of the beasts versus the
[32:16] image of God
[32:17] isn't that something let's continue know
[32:21] anyone who can explain anything you
[32:24] don't have to accept it anymore by feet
[32:26] if these things that we cannot explain
[32:29] that we have to accept my feet we cannot
[32:33] explain God no man can explain God he is
[32:38] sovereign he is great and mighty we just
[32:40] accept it because we know he is there
[32:43] and then I our faith and accepting it he
[32:47] brings the response back to us the

[36:39] world I've got meetings that tell you
[36:41] you cannot understand it now but when he
[36:45] comes he will guide you to it so after
[36:49] the prophet was taken off the scene God
[36:51] released the Spirit of Truth two spirits
[36:54] was unfold on the earth the Spirit of
[36:56] Truth and the spirit of error but the
[36:59] Spirit of Truth was sent to guide us to
[37:02] the truth so listen this part now that's
[37:05] the reason
[37:06] the coming of the seals at the finishing
[37:09] of the Seventh Seal
[37:11] the mystery of God to be finished to
[37:13] know who God is what he is how he lives
[37:18] his nature his being you're supposed to
[37:21] be all the way up there by that time in
[37:25] other words you're supposed to be on top
[37:27] of brotherly kindness by that time
[37:31] you're supposed to have it based on
[37:34] forgiveness by that time by that time
[37:38] the Ottoman Lords no grudge no jealousy
[37:41] no malice no foolishness by that time
[37:45] it's just a faith to pull down the cap
[37:48] or blow it up God give the Lord a shout
[37:52] listen to this listen listen a the
[37:55] strong that Daniel saw no money cut that
[37:58] oak no manner cut that so now that's
[38:01] only coming the coming of the headstone
[38:04] ready or not it's coming or glory though
[38:08] God you better get ready bright Oh
[38:12] hallelujah I'm a sinner again the
[38:16] finishing of this seventh seal not the
[38:19] beginning this is 54 years since the
[38:21] Prophet left

[1:02:54] Sheikh open there will be a resurrection
[1:02:56] because the children under perfection by
[1:02:59] manifestation till the Lord a shell all
[1:03:02] this fivefold ministry for the perfect
[1:03:04] innocence men flesh man ordinary man
[1:03:07] human beings think that they doing that
[1:03:08] man kappa man sinful man too
[1:03:11] perfect man they don't understand is
[1:03:13] five for ministry as prophesied by the
[1:03:15] prophet of william branham and he's to
[1:03:17] be five for ministry is the Ministry of
[1:03:19] Jesus Christ it's not this man ministry
[1:03:22] and that you have a great ministry that
[1:03:23] technology those guys the message I saw
[1:03:25] me before all together you have to be
[1:03:27] given that you have to comment to that
[1:03:28] God after we put you put that upon you
[1:03:31] there is that a man trying a king and my
[1:03:34] church and I just better illustrate a
[1:03:36] foolishness like humans business that
[1:03:39] nothing mister Jesus Christ
[1:03:40] there was one cap there was one head
[1:03:43] there was one head you must recognize
[1:03:44] the headship of Jesus Christ
[1:03:47] Oh glory to God I am NOT a head of the
[1:03:49] church he is the head of the body called
[1:03:52] the church in that body of fivefold
[1:03:55] ministry in that body of believers but
[1:03:59] gifts with places in that body but on
[1:04:03] top that body Christ alone is the head
[1:04:05] the bigger the Lord a shout or do you
[1:04:09] see well I'm saying in all glory to God
[1:04:11] so the early part of our ministry he
[1:04:14] said I said I represent the faith by way
[1:04:20] of a divine gift
[1:04:23] it's a powerful statement
[1:04:26] I represent the faith by way of a divine
[1:04:30] gift D fate didn't come into him yet he
[1:04:35] had a gift of healing and that was so
[1:04:40] powerful they taken for Jesus Christ but
[1:04:43] he at was the growth of first full
[1:04:46] second pole purple into the Ministry of
[1:04:49] Jesus Christ where God Himself was
[1:04:51] filled in him that's why you can say
[1:04:55] come to the unveiling of the mighty God
[1:04:57] Oh glory to God and when God was veiling
[1:05:00] him God spoke himself out on books and
[1:05:04] tapes in the form of promises hallelujah
[1:05:07] and we catch the promises or the
[1:05:10] preacher sketch explanation
[1:05:11] interpretation or kind of crazy
[1:05:13] revelation but what we see is promises
[1:05:15] so when you come to church all you want
[1:05:17] to hear is what your promise you want to
[1:05:19] hear what your heritance is you want to
[1:05:21] hear what you call on truth you want
[1:05:23] hear what they're here for what you must
[1:05:25] anoint what you must clean what you must
[1:05:27] pull down you know he has a bacchanal
[1:05:28] and confusion and talking other people
[1:05:30] business you know here for that I am NOT
[1:05:32] here for that we have to speak as the
[1:05:34] Oracles of God Oh glory to God when we
[1:05:37] speak you have to speak for God to the
[1:05:42] escaped ones we'll give the Lord a shout
[1:05:44] that's the promise you know hallelujah
[1:05:50] yes prophetic utterance we'll go out to
[1:05:54] the escaped ones hallelujah you wouldn't
[1:05:56] want to miss a service because they
[1:05:58] don't know what God want to say you
[1:06:00] don't know what call wonders speak
[1:06:01] because Corps gonna sleep by direct
[1:06:03] inspiration it's not just the course we
[1:06:05] are caught in here is the Spirit of God
[1:06:07] coming and speaking to you because once
[1:06:10] more the world will get direct from God
[1:06:12] or glory God direct from God God
[1:06:15] speaking directly to you when you leave
[1:06:17] a your no God talk to you or glory
[1:06:19] they're gonna get that directly from the
[1:06:21] Lord oh my my my my my hallelujah
[1:06:26] so we said I call you a long time ago
[1:06:28] before the fog in the world and God sent
[1:06:30] Jesus to make that inheritance real to
[1:06:34] me
[1:06:34] because there was nothing I could do but
[1:06:36] inherited there's nothing I can do but
[1:06:39] in the fullness of time God sent his own
[1:06:41] the time Jesus the lamb slain from the
[1:06:44] foundation of the world his blood was
[1:06:46] shed that I met Gautam inheritance to be
[1:06:48] walked whatever it is the sonship to be
[1:06:53] a son of God not just remember but
[1:07:00] that's for me a little bit right
[1:07:03] Moses people children in Israel God's
[1:07:06] people pillar of fire they come out on
[1:07:08] its own right so go get them prophets
[1:07:10] they have the word they have the law
[1:07:12] from Malachi to Matthew hundreds of
[1:07:15] years no prophet here comes John the
[1:07:18] Baptist repent by that time 100 years
[1:07:23] pass then fellows are tall hats
[1:07:24] long dongs nice little Indians nice
[1:07:28] Tabernacles and temples and so on nice
[1:07:31] traditions and so on people respect them
[1:07:33] on what not here come a man that's
[1:07:35] Zachariah
[1:07:36] his name is Johnny yeah come on man with
[1:07:38] camel skin blossom bring forth fruit me
[1:07:42] to repentance and blessing them the
[1:07:44] Pharisees knew something happening
[1:07:45] because that behavior is out of sync
[1:07:48] with what their custom with they say are
[1:07:50] you him are you the Messiah should we
[1:07:53] look for another see me I'm not me
[1:07:55] there's one standing among you the whole
[1:07:57] harlot are whose shoes I'm not worthy
[1:07:58] sunroofs you're gonna baptize you with
[1:08:01] the Holy Ghost somebody fire or glory to
[1:08:03] God you under know who it is yet
[1:08:05] she caught giving my sign upon whom you
[1:08:07] see the stuff coming on resting and
[1:08:09] remaining that's the Messiah Jesus he is
[1:08:12] watching what's happening he had to wait
[1:08:14] for his time he came out of all a mess
[1:08:16] I'm Jesus until hey buddy I'm Jesus
[1:08:18] he can't introduce himself John have to
[1:08:21] introduce him and we have to be made for
[1:08:23] the Messiah
[1:08:24] so jeez had a whiff of John to start to
[1:08:26] preach and John the timing has to be
[1:08:28] just right and then all of a sudden Holy
[1:08:31] Spirit tells Jesus
[1:08:31] move now he's standing in line to be
[1:08:34] baptizing anybody else I'm John baptized
[1:08:36] I'm baptized I'm
[1:08:37] Jesus he said I said you should map ties
[1:08:39] me he said that might be so but it
[1:08:41] behooves us to fulfill all righteousness
[1:08:42] I'm John baptized and he said behold the
[1:08:45] lamb of God then the elect among John
[1:08:48] disciples stopped following John and
[1:08:50] instead the follow Jesus because the
[1:08:52] neutron was introduced Jesus John Scylla
[1:08:55] disciples but this guy is following
[1:08:57] Jesus no because the new Nazi Messiah or
[1:09:00] glory that God but Jesus find a lot of
[1:09:02] priests so qualified fooling them is
[1:09:04] also called custodians of the wood in
[1:09:06] those days they have the books that they
[1:09:08] tipped up the scrolls your fallen same
[1:09:10] with the caretakers they work ethic in
[1:09:14] the Moodle schools after John got Papa
[1:09:17] Jesus got baptized Holy Spirit again not
[1:09:19] man Holy Spirit led him into the
[1:09:21] wilderness
[1:09:23] yeah but Lord is that you I've seen
[1:09:26] realism front is that you I thought I
[1:09:28] was going I wouldn't on a platform and
[1:09:30] people welcomed me I thought I get
[1:09:33] enough love people shake my hands but is
[1:09:36] that real
[1:09:37] yeah that's really you the Holy Spirit
[1:09:40] led him into the wilderness to overcome
[1:09:42] Lucifer
[1:09:43] one-on-one private trial to overcome the
[1:09:48] lust of the eyes lust of the flesh pride
[1:09:50] of life to overcome himself a lot of
[1:09:54] people that they don't have the internal
[1:09:56] power
[1:09:58] self discipline self order conquering of
[1:10:02] self denies by the mode fly loosely get
[1:10:05] empathic carry on because they don't
[1:10:07] have the internal stuff so when Jesus
[1:10:11] had that discipline look at this stone
[1:10:13] could turn into bread and say it is
[1:10:14] written it's written is also written he
[1:10:16] overcame know the spirit come back upon
[1:10:19] him so here is he baptized spirit on him
[1:10:22] when he hit the wilderness spread off of
[1:10:25] him now
[1:10:25] yeah the physicists alone no help of it
[1:10:29] it has written it as written he's doing
[1:10:32] that for you and me you don't need power
[1:10:34] to beat that devil you just need to know
[1:10:36] your word
[1:10:38] hallelujah it's written is written burns
[1:10:40] they did that for you he did that for me
[1:10:43] that you could tell sit and it is
[1:10:44] written it is written if you do it is
[1:10:47] written that's why you have to be in the
[1:10:48] word to know it is written or give the
[1:10:50] Lord a shout you have to know it is
[1:10:53] written you have to know it's in the
[1:10:55] word after study the word so when he
[1:10:58] come true and he come back over then he
[1:11:01] speak come back upon in the Bible call
[1:11:03] it the power of the Spirit
[1:11:04] so now you have a super anointing upon
[1:11:06] him he goes to the temple they save

[1:11:33] text they thought he cotton and he
[1:11:36] quoted he just caught him but his
[1:11:37] himself is coated the Spirit of the Lord

[1:12:41] are sons of God how much of God's or
[1:12:43] this is beautiful men that are sons of
[1:12:46] God are mature gods
[1:12:48] he didn't say meander
[1:12:49] the god of preachers and teachers and
[1:12:51] explainers he's showing you that the
[1:12:53] inheritance is your sonship to be a son
[1:12:57] of God and the son of God rightly not
[1:13:00] Church son civil and pure son of God
[1:13:03] rightly is a mature God watch watch how
[1:13:11] many ever knowed how many know Jesus
[1:13:12] said so did not they lost it at your
[1:13:14] God's watch impotence is - because they
[1:13:18] had full don't mean the mean of the
[1:13:19] world
[1:13:20] he couldn't Dominion of all things he
[1:13:22] lost his quad ship he lost his sonship
[1:13:26] he lost his to mean Satan took it over
[1:13:29] but brother we are waiting for the
[1:13:32] manifestation of the sons of God who
[1:13:34] will come back and take it over again
[1:13:37] waiting for the fullness of time and
[1:13:42] then now he wanted equality side the
[1:13:45] fullness of time as when the pyramid
[1:13:48] gets to the top so he showed it can
[1:13:53] happen before time it has to come at the
[1:13:55] fullness of time when when the pyramid
[1:13:58] comes to the top watch watch watch watch

[1:14:28] work out evil Alleluia
[1:14:29] and will take every Power that Satan's
[1:14:33] got away from him that's right that's
[1:14:38] why Jesus said usually about wars and
[1:14:40] rumors of wars and Kingdom rise against
[1:14:42] Kingdom and earthquakes in diverse
[1:14:44] places he said the end is not yet but
[1:14:46] then he's qualified with this gospel
[1:14:49] must be preached not taught this is not
[1:14:55] taught now this is after all the
[1:14:57] teachings this gospel must
[1:15:00] preached and then shall the end come
[1:15:03] nobody is coming to end us without us
[1:15:05] preaching the gospel did not end in us
[1:15:07] we have that we have to close this story
[1:15:09] or give the Lord a shout let me say it
[1:15:12] again we have to close this story
