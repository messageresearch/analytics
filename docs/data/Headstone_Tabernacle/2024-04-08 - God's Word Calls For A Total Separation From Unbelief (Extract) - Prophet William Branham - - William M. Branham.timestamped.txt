[20:35] you amen you may be seated and this
[20:38] evening we have a message from the
[20:40] prophet William brandham uh God's word
[20:42] calls for total separation from unbelief
[20:45] amen listen and enjoy amen praise
[20:55] God we're going to turn in the
[20:57] scriptures to
[20:59] few scriptures that I have written out
[21:02] here or uh what I if I want would call
[21:05] it a text I wouldn't know whether they
[21:07] call it a text or not but just for a
[21:09] text I want to take this
[21:13] thought God's word calls for a total
[21:18] separation from
[21:19] unbelief and now I wish to read out of
[21:22] the Bible over in the Book of
[21:25] Genesis the 13th chapter of Genesis and
[21:30] we wish to start with the fifth verse to
[21:32] read I just love to read the word
[21:34] because what I say could fail that's a
[21:38] man but if I just read this word what he
[21:41] says can't fail so then I know there'll
[21:44] be good come out of it if no more than
[21:46] just reading the word the fifth verse We
[21:51] Begin of the 13th chapter and lot also
[21:56] which went with Abram had loocks and
[21:59] herds and Tents and the lamb was not
[22:02] able to Bear them that they might dwell
[22:05] together for their substance was great
[22:08] so that they could not dwell together
[22:11] and there was Strife between the
[22:13] herdsmen of Abram's cattle and the
[22:16] herdsman of Lot's cattle and the
[22:19] Canaanite prite dwelt in the land and
[22:22] Abram said unto lot let there be no
[22:25] Strife I pray thee between me and thee
[22:29] and between my herdsman and thy herdsman
[22:31] for we are
[22:34] Brethren is not the whole land before
[22:38] thee separate thyself I pray thee from
[22:41] me and if thou will take the left hand
[22:45] then I'll go to the right or if thou
[22:48] depart to the right hand then I will go
[22:51] to the left and lot lifted up his eyes
[22:54] and beheld the plains of Jordan that it
[22:57] was well watered everywhere before the
[23:00] Lord destroyed Sodom and gomorra even as
[23:03] the garden of the Lord like the land of
[23:06] Egypt as thou comest out of
[23:08] Zora then lot chose him all the plains
[23:12] of Jordan and lot journeyed
[23:14] Eastward and they separated themselves
[23:17] one from the other and Abram dwelt in
[23:20] the land of Canaan and lot dwelt in the
[23:24] city of the Plains and pitched his tent
[23:26] towards Sodom
[23:28] but the man of Sodom were Wicked and
[23:31] sinners before the Lord
[23:34] exceedingly and the Lord said unto
[23:36] Abraham after that lot was separated
[23:39] from him lift up now thine eyes and look
[23:45] from the place where thou northward
[23:49] Southward Eastward Westward for all the
[23:53] land which thou seest to thee will I
[23:56] give thee and to thy seed
[24:00] forever now the thought of God's word
[24:04] calling a total
[24:08] separation we only know this by as we
[24:11] read the word and see the word uh
[24:14] manifest
[24:16] itself now in the beginning Genesis
[24:19] 1:3 we find that there was Darkness upon
[24:23] the
[24:24] earth and the spirit of God moved upon
[24:27] the water and said let there be light
[24:31] and there was light and God saw that the
[24:33] light was good and God separated the
[24:37] light from the
[24:39] darkness so the word of God began to
[24:42] separate the light from the darkness
[24:45] from the beginning so does it remain to
[24:48] this day as I said last night of Jesus
[24:52] when he was only 12 years old and being
[24:55] a mistake of his mother who is claimed
[24:58] by people to be the mother of God and
[25:01] how that the woman said while thy father
[25:04] and I have sought thee with tears and
[25:06] quickly he being the word said knowest
[25:09] thou not that I must be about my
[25:11] father's business see she was declaring
[25:13] him to be Joseph's son but he wasn't
[25:16] Joseph's son if he' been Joseph's son he
[25:19] would been with him but he was with the
[25:21] father about his business so the word is
[25:24] always corrective and always right and
[25:27] the word word will correct ever
[25:30] wrong always now when the earth that God
[25:33] was going to use the Earth and it was in
[25:35] total darkness the spirit of God spoke
[25:38] out and said let there be light and he
[25:41] separated the light from the darkness
[25:45] and it's been doing that ever since
[25:47] separating light from Darkness God's
[25:51] word also separated the water from the
[25:54] land in the beginning God spoke and the
[25:57] water was separated from the land so
[26:00] that he had a a reason for that God
[26:03] never speaks a word unless he's got a
[26:05] reason for speaking that word he's not
[26:08] like you and I that we just or
[26:10] especially myself that speaks so many
[26:12] foolish things God speaks every word
[26:15] with a meaning and something that he's
[26:17] trying to achieve and will achieve by
[26:19] his word and it will perform exactly
[26:22] what he said it will do now if God said
[26:24] let there be light and there was no
[26:26] light then that
[26:28] that isn't uh that wasn't God said that
[26:31] when God says anything he must back up
[26:34] what he says and when the word of God
[26:37] has been a Vindicated the word been a
[26:41] Vindicated that is light now the word is
[26:44] isn't light until it's a Vindicated
[26:47] light if God said let there be light and
[26:49] there was no light then it wasn't the
[26:52] word of God but when light sprung upon
[26:55] the Earth that showed the word was
[26:57] Vindicated and and it was light now
[27:00] today if God has made a promise and when
[27:03] that promise is Vindicated then that is
[27:06] light that's the light of the day when
[27:08] the word is a Vindicated the word for
[27:12] the hour is a Vindicated then God was
[27:15] going to have a our Earth that he was
[27:17] going to
[27:18] grow vegetation and have people up on
[27:21] the earth and then he spoke and
[27:23] separated the waters from the sea then
[27:27] also he separated in Genesis life from
[27:33] Death now if we believe the word of God
[27:38] it is the Word of Life to us right but
[27:41] if we question the word of God it's
[27:44] death to us for God has spoken who can
[27:47] deny see and if we question the word of
[27:52] God then it becomes death like Eve Now
[27:56] Eve question one one little phase of
[27:59] God's word and what did it do caused all
[28:02] this trouble that we had if she would
[28:05] remain behind the word fortified behind
[28:08] the word the whole armor of God and not
[28:11] disbelieved it then it would have never
[28:14] had way it has it never been this way
[28:17] but you see there Came Death then God
[28:21] also had an atonement being Mercyful to
[28:24] us he accepted a substitute death for
[28:26] their death which both he separated life
[28:30] from Death also in the Garden of Eden
[28:33] and he did it by his word and today he
[28:36] does the same thing when we're in Gross
[28:39] Darkness as I spoke on Sunday Darkness
[28:42] upon the land upon the people and gross
[28:44] darkness in the midst of all of this
[28:47] he's still speaking his Word of Life to
[28:49] those who want to believe it and now we
[28:52] find that if um Jesus has constantly
[28:58] told us that there's a separation and we
[29:00] find that the last thing that's
[29:03] predicted to the human race before the
[29:07] great final day when we Ascend into the
[29:10] presence of God there will be a final
[29:13] separation he will separate the sheep
[29:16] from the goats God will continually has
[29:21] been separating separating and that's
[29:24] what he's doing tonight it's what he
[29:26] always does you can see it in meeting he
[29:29] separates Faith from unbelief he speaks
[29:32] out he declares himself to those who
[29:35] will believe him have faith in him now
[29:37] we find out in numbers the 6th
[29:40] chapter that a nazarites call a Nazarite
[29:45] call was to separate themselves from all
[29:48] the world to the word of God that is a
[29:53] Nazarite call separated we find out that
[29:57] Sam son was a Nazarite unto the Lord and
[30:02] he was separated from the U uh by a
[30:06] sign and this sign was that he was to
[30:10] wear his hair long with Seven Locks it
[30:13] was a a sign of
[30:15] Separation that he was called for a
[30:19] purpose and I don't want to get started
[30:22] on this because I said that it I was
[30:25] just going to speak a few minutes but I
[30:27] think that today when we see our sisters
[30:29] wearing long hair as the Bible said they
[30:32] should I think it's a Nazarite sign that
[30:35] they want to follow the lord I know that
[30:38] sounds flat and I I I wanted to go home
[30:42] see because it is it looks like somebody
[30:45] is trying to to do keep a uh something
[30:48] that God told them to do no matter what
[30:51] the price the world uh has to say about
[30:53] it out there how many scornful or
[30:55] laughers or critics that doesn't bother
[30:58] a person that's totally separated from
[31:01] the things of the world to the things of
[31:03] God they'll obey the word and separate
[31:06] themselves from the things of the world
[31:09] because the word separates them I know
[31:13] they stand criticism but if we wasn't
[31:15] criticized then there'd be something
[31:17] wrong the world always knows its own but
[31:20] as I've said that remember criticism on
[31:24] the count of the word of God is only
[31:26] growing pain of his grace it shows that
[31:30] you have separated
[31:32] yourself to be a Christian to act like
[31:36] one to live like one to obey every
[31:38] commandment of God and it's a it's a
[31:41] Nazarite vow to separate a call from God
[31:46] that separates you from the things of
[31:48] the world I believe tonight that every
[31:50] man and woman every boy and girl that's
[31:52] born of the spirit of God is a Nazarite
[31:55] unto the Lord because they have
[31:58] separated them things themselves from
[32:00] the cares of the world and whatever the
[32:02] world's got to say you live in this city
[32:05] here where there's great schools and and
[32:08] we see our nation calling for higher
[32:10] standard of Education which is all right
[32:13] nothing to say about that but that
[32:15] education cannot give you salvation
[32:18] that's right a scientist can split a
[32:20] grain of wheat and tell you how many
[32:22] different uh chemicals is in it but it
[32:25] can't find the life that's in there an
[32:28] education can learn you or teach you
[32:30] mathematics and and it can teach you
[32:33] history and whatever more but it cannot
[32:36] bring life to you your education will
[32:39] not do that right God has one way of
[32:42] bringing life to you that's when you're
[32:43] ready to separate yourself from all the
[32:46] things of the world and all the the
[32:48] cures of the world and clean only to
[32:52] God's promised
[32:53] word Paul was a Nazarite unto the Lord
[32:57] he was separated from his Orthodox
[33:00] Church to the word of the Living God
[33:04] Aaron was a Nazarite unto the Lord he
[33:06] was separated from among the Brethren to
[33:09] Bear the birthstones and to be the high
[33:12] priest it is a total separation we're
[33:15] not to go back into the world no more or
[33:18] have anything to do with the world but
[33:20] cleave only
[33:22] unto
[33:24] God Jesus is coming after a bride a
[33:28] woman a church that's separated from the
[33:32] things of the world or the cures of the
[33:35] world she's separated from the Fashions
[33:37] of this Modern Age that we live in she's
[33:40] separated from the the ks and the
[33:42] traditions of churches she's separated
[33:45] only to God and God is the word and as
[33:49] husband and wife is one so does the
[33:52] bride and the word become one for the
[33:55] words living through the bride amen
[33:57] that's how that's her credentials that's
[34:00] her
[34:02] identification if I could pull out a a
[34:05] PhD or lldd and show you my credentials
[34:08] from certain organization from some
[34:10] school that school would recognize that
[34:13] credential but the only credential that
[34:15] a Believer has is the word of God living
[34:18] in him declaring Jesus Christ lives in
[34:22] that person that's right that's a
[34:24] separated Nazarite unto the Lord
[34:27] separated for the word sake the Bible
[34:31] said the word of God is sharper than a
[34:33] two-age sword cutting to the suer and
[34:37] the mire of the bone and discerns the
[34:39] thought that's in the heart that's the
[34:42] reason Jesus could look upon the people
[34:44] and perceive what they were thinking he
[34:46] was the word now the first Adam that was
[34:50] born in the world or not born but
[34:52] created by God the first Adam separated
[34:56] himself from the the word to his
[34:59] wife now he could have stayed with the
[35:02] word if he wished to but he separated
[35:05] himself from the word to be with his
[35:07] wife that's exactly what the common
[35:11] carnal church member does today
[35:15] separates themselves from the true
[35:17] Living Word to hold to their Church
[35:22] where the eve put a question upon the
[35:25] word whether God would punish or not
[35:29] Satan put the question Eve believed it
[35:33] and then when the church today puts a
[35:36] question upon the word is he the same
[35:40] does he still uh live in his church and
[35:44] per uh perform his signs and miracles
[35:47] that he did when he was here on Earth
[35:49] which he
[35:49] so surely promised us in St John 14:12
[35:54] he that believeth on me the works that I
[35:56] do shall he do also even greater than
[36:00] this shall he do for I go to my father
[36:03] these signs shall follow them that
[36:05] believe shall follow them the question
[36:09] is the the people today does he really
[36:12] mean it and when you accept what the
[36:15] church says does he really mean it then
[36:17] you put yourself in the same condition
[36:20] that Adam did and join yourself with the
[36:24] the woman of the Church of the this
[36:27] world and separate yourself from the
[36:30] blessings that God has promised to every
[36:32] believer that would separate himself
[36:34] from the world to the
[36:35] world uh that's the
[36:38] truth we are have had the privilege of
[36:41] living in the day that when the word of
[36:44] God that we've seen is lotted through
[36:46] each age for certain things to happen
[36:50] and when this is lotted sometimes a man
[36:52] wonder how it's going to be done
[36:54] professors have their own idea but in
[36:57] them AG God has always sent forth his
[37:00] prophet and the word of the Lord comes
[37:02] to the prophet and vindicates the word
[37:05] to that
[37:06] generation and the prophets is always a
[37:08] Nazarite separated from everything else
[37:11] to obey the word of God do you remember
[37:15] what Peter and John said is it right for
[37:17] us to obey man or God when they
[37:20] questioned them about the experience of
[37:22] Pentecost now the first man separated
[37:26] himself the first Adam
[37:29] from the word to go with his wife that
[37:33] question whether God kept his word or
[37:36] not what a perfect type of the lukewarm
[37:40] carnal minded believer today that still
[37:43] wants to cling with what the tradition
[37:45] says instead of taking what the word
[37:47] says that's it a very real type he was
[37:54] separated to his wife the carnal
[37:57] believer is separated from the word to
[37:59] the church but when the second Adam was
[38:03] created in the womb of a woman and came
[38:07] to the world he was a Nazarite to the
[38:11] word of God he was separated from the
[38:14] world to the word now Hebrews the 7th
[38:17] chapter 26th verse tells us that that
[38:20] them priest continually died but this
[38:22] Jesus is Holy and separated from Sinners
[38:27] sin is unbelief there was no unbelief
[38:30] found any nowhere when he was sure on
[38:32] Earth he said who can condemn me of sin
[38:36] sin is unbelief if I haven't done just
[38:38] what was prophesied for this age if I
[38:41] haven't met the requirements of what
[38:43] Messiah is supposed to do then don't
[38:46] believe me said search the scriptures
[38:49] for in them you think you have eternal
[38:51] life and they are they that testify of
[38:55] me tell you who who he is because it had
[38:59] been prophesied since Eden that there
[39:02] would come a savior the prophet said
[39:05] he'd be born of a virgin and how that
[39:08] he'd be called
[39:09] Emmanuel and also he was a counselor the
[39:12] Prince of Peace Mighty God and that's
[39:15] what they accused him of making himself
[39:16] God he was God Amen and he was the
[39:20] prince ofie of Mighty God and the
[39:22] Everlasting father there's no other
[39:25] father but him spiritually speaking he's
[39:27] the only father the father of us all and
[39:31] we find all believers he's the father of
[39:34] all who will believe his word for he was
[39:37] completely separated from the church
[39:40] from his Traditions from his mother from
[39:42] the world and only did that which
[39:45] pleased the
[39:47] father now he was a different person
[39:49] from Adam no matter what anybody
[39:52] questioned to him the word it was the
[39:54] word always first and he pre knew that
[39:57] the word was right when Satan tried to
[40:00] whitewash it for him and said it's
[40:02] written he said yes and it's also
[40:04] written he with stood Satan upon the
[40:08] word because that's what he was the word
[40:11] the Bible First John St John the first
[40:14] chapter said in the beginning was the
[40:16] word and the Word was with God and the
[40:19] Word was God and the Word was made flesh
[40:22] and dwelt Among Us he's the same
[40:24] yesterday today and forever it's always
[40:26] a connection ction with the spoken word
[40:29] of God God's promise for the day and
[40:33] when he comes it's so unusual the people
[40:37] can hardly grasp it because we're so
[40:40] sewed into to farms and ideas of our own
[40:45] that it's hard for us to grasp what's
[40:47] truth I think much of that would apply
[40:51] to to Joseph in the days of of the
[40:55] the U Mary in her maternity she she was
[40:59] to be mother and Joseph loved her and he
[41:03] he wanted to believe he was a righteous
[41:07] man a good man and he wanted to believe
[41:10] that story that Mary was telling him but
[41:12] still there was a question that now
[41:16] she's a good woman no doubt Mary had
[41:19] explained to him the visit of Gabriel to
[41:21] her and he was a just man in the lineage
[41:26] of David
[41:27] and yet her it looked like that she was
[41:31] trying to use him for a
[41:33] shield to take off her reproach because
[41:37] if she was engaged to him and to be
[41:40] found in this condition was the same as
[41:42] adultery Deuteronomy tells us so and
[41:45] would be stoned for the ACT and it
[41:47] looked like that she was using him for a
[41:51] shield and the man a good man a just man
[41:55] the Bible said he was a just man but her
[41:58] case was so
[42:01] unusual that he could not grasp it he'
[42:05] look in her lovely face and the
[42:07] sincerity and honesty that she would
[42:10] tell her story in and no doubt but he'd
[42:12] go to his home or his Cartner shop say I
[42:16] I just can't see how she would tell me
[42:18] wrong but the case is so
[42:21] unusual if he would have only searched
[42:24] the scriptures that a virgin is to
[42:26] conceive
[42:28] see it was so unusual to him because it
[42:31] was out of the line of his thinking but
[42:34] she is exactly in the scripture and so
[42:37] is it today Brethren that the power of
[42:41] the resurrection of Jesus Christ and his
[42:43] promised word of this hour is so unusual
[42:47] good man stumble over it it's too
[42:52] unusual they say that the dead was
[42:54] raised up the blind see the de here the
[42:58] Holy Spirit discerns the thoughts
[43:01] foretells things that's coming to pass
[43:03] never fail at one time or they they
[43:06] can't can't grasp it it's so unusual so
[43:10] they they uh say well it's a telepathy
[43:12] or it's a evil spirit just like they did
[43:14] in that day the unusualness of the word
[43:17] of God but when a man is born in the
[43:21] world for a a Believer he becomes a
[43:24] Nazarite when he separates himself from
[43:27] anything that's contrary to the word a
[43:31] total
[43:32] separation Jesus said I come to separate
[43:35] a man from his
[43:36] wife tear up a family and he that won't
[43:41] uh take up his cross and follow me is
[43:44] not worthy to be called mine a
[43:47] separation from everything anything from
[43:51] church from from a community from a
[43:54] belief or from family or anything that
[43:58] would stand between you and believing
[44:01] the entire word of God if your soul will
[44:04] not punctuate every promise for this
[44:07] hour with an amen there's something
[44:10] wrong somewhere you need a
[44:13] separation so Jesus was the word made
[44:17] flesh and he was completely separated
[44:20] from Sinners unbelievers that the word
[44:23] itself flowed completely and and
[44:26] thoroughly through him that he said I do
[44:29] nothing until I see the father do it
[44:31] first they asked him question him about
[44:34] things he said verely I say unto you the
[44:36] son can do nothing in himself but what
[44:38] he sees the father doing watch
[44:42] everything that he said was
[44:45] perfect just he had not to ask about it
[44:48] think about it it was perfect and his
[44:52] perfect truth always separated the truth
[44:56] from error even as I quote back again
[44:58] again his mother said thy father and I
[45:01] before those priests that should already
[45:03] testify it was a virgin
[45:05] barnon but in the moments of her grief
[45:08] How could a 12-year-old boy we have no
[45:11] record of him even being in school how
[45:13] could his intelligence be so great as to
[45:15] debate with the priest Sage learned man
[45:19] and why when she called that this Joseph
[45:22] was his father quickly the word of God
[45:25] he was separated ated he was the word
[45:29] and the word corrected the error know ye
[45:32] not that I must be about my father's
[45:34] business that was not just that little
[45:37] 12year old boy that was the word of God
[45:40] speaking through his little childish
[45:43] mouth to correct error separating like
[45:47] he did in the beginning Darkness from
[45:50] light aive from the
[45:53] truth death from
[45:55] life it's a separation always the word
[45:59] requires total and complete separation
[46:03] regardless Jesus said let every man's
[46:05] word be a lie let mine be true that's
[46:08] right all down Through the Ages the same
[46:10] thing has happened it's a separating
[46:13] always he separates his people from the
[46:16] unbelief he did it at the beginning he
[46:18] does it same today each one of the
[46:20] prophets was separated from unbelief
[46:23] they reason they did that is because the
[46:26] the word of the Lord came to
[46:30] them now believe a night somewhere
[46:33] perhaps this year Sunday or last night
[46:35] that I was speaking what the word sear
[46:38] in the Old Testament meant it meant a
[46:41] man a
[46:42] diviner a man that would tell the future
[46:45] events that were coming to pass and then
[46:49] when they come to pass exactly without
[46:52] failure come to pass exactly what he
[46:54] said then God said listen to this man or
[46:57] hearing fearing for I'm with him then he
[47:01] had the Divine interpretation of the
[47:06] written word for that was his
[47:08] credentials of identification that he
[47:11] was God's prophet and the word come to
[47:13] him amen right now separation it
[47:18] separated Isaiah from the church World
[47:22] it separated Moses from the church World
[47:26] it separated
[47:27] the uh all the the great prophets to the
[47:30] ages from the church world because they
[47:33] had it separated Jesus from his Brethren
[47:36] it separated the apostles from the
[47:39] church it was at that day the Pharisees
[47:42] Sadducees great man holy man good man
[47:45] fine man humble man man that had fruit
[47:49] of the spirit more so than what Jesus
[47:52] exercised but what was his credentials
[47:55] that the word was with him the word
[47:58] promised of that day was living through
[48:01] him he said which one of you can condemn
[48:02] me of sin which one of you can say that
[48:05] what I have claimed hasn't happened that
[48:08] he showed that he was a separated
[48:10] Nazarite of the Lord he was the Lord
[48:13] himself in flesh Abraham
[48:17] also he was a separated person from the
[48:21] world when God called Abraham at 75
[48:25] years old separate yourself from your
[48:28] Kindred and from all your the unbelief
[48:31] and come out into a world that you've
[48:33] never walked in before and amongst a
[48:35] people that you've never known before
[48:38] come out and separate yourself from
[48:40] anybody that would be contrary to what
[48:42] you're believing that You' be a Nazarite
[48:45] unto the Lord because he was holding a
[48:48] promise of a son praise God he had to
[48:51] separate from his father from his mother
[48:54] from his Kindred and what separated him
[48:56] him not because he was a good man but
[49:00] because he believed that God was able to
[49:03] keep the promise he had
[49:06] given and when he was 25 years later and
[49:09] the baby had never come Sarah being 90
[49:12] he 100 and when the angel of the Lord
[49:15] visit him that Jesus referred to that
[49:17] would come again in the last days God in
[49:20] a human Farm sat down before him and Tau
[49:24] and Sarah being almost 100 years old in
[49:26] the tent behind him laughed because the
[49:30] angel said I will visit you according to
[49:32] the time of the promise and she said me
[49:35] being old and would have pleasure again
[49:37] with my Lord seeing he's old and this
[49:41] man well which was God in flesh said why
[49:47] did Sarah laugh in the
[49:50] tent now she run out and tried to deny
[49:54] but he said yes but you did laugh
[49:57] because it she didn't believe it could
[49:59] be right now notice Jesus said that
[50:04] would come again as it was in the days
[50:08] of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of
[50:11] the son of man amen again the spirit of
[50:15] God will come upon martal human
[50:19] flesh that man eat the meat of a calf
[50:22] drinking the milk from the cow and eat
[50:25] butter and bread in human flesh and
[50:30] Abraham said he was
[50:32] Elohim God manifested in flesh Jesus
[50:37] promised that God before his coming
[50:40] would be manifested in human flesh again
[50:44] that's the Holy Spirit he's only one
[50:47] God manifesting itself separating again
[50:52] lot from
[50:54] Abraham lot wanted the word
[50:57] God SE tore up his world and separated
[51:01] Abraham and lot lot being a type again
[51:03] of a carnal believer who didn't think
[51:06] these things were true he just went on
[51:08] down in Sodom and he didn't have the
[51:10] real spunk to stand out as we' call it
[51:12] and call what was right right and wrong
[51:15] wrong so he went down all these
[51:17] Believers as we could go on for hours
[51:21] all these were like a bunch of change
[51:24] out of your pocket in God's hand
[51:28] you pull out a bunch of change there's
[51:30] pennies nickels dimes quarters half a
[51:35] dollars dollar all in coins now that's
[51:39] what the world is in God's hand there's
[51:43] some people that's just can have a
[51:46] Penny's worth of it and God can only use
[51:48] them in a penny way that's all they can
[51:51] buy don't reject them if they can't
[51:55] believe the real truth don't turn them
[51:57] down don't kick them out and say they're
[52:00] not in it because God uses pennies
[52:02] sometimes amen lot was just a penny
[52:05] Abraham was a silver dollar so it taken
[52:09] a hundred lots to make an Abraham so it
[52:12] take a hundred carnal Believers will
[52:14] never stand in the presence of a genuine
[52:17] Christian that's separated from the
[52:19] carnal things of the world living in
[52:21] Christ Jesus where the word can flow
[52:23] through
[52:24] him he can only take a penny worth
[52:27] that's all he's got so you see people
[52:29] say I don't believe in healing I don't
[52:30] believe in these things just know it's a
[52:32] penny but just let him
[52:34] alone just a Penny's worth and so that's
[52:37] all he can buy don't stop him just let
[52:39] him alone remember that's just all
[52:40] farther he can go
[52:43] Joseph he was separated from his
[52:47] Brethren yeah I didn't mean that hard in
[52:50] that way that I said it see I mean if he
[52:52] just well I belong to this and that's
[52:54] what we believe it's just a penny go
[52:56] ahead thing just aend he say well the
[52:58] Lord bless you my brother se's copper he
[53:00] can never be silver so just let it go
[53:03] ahead God can use him oh he's using it
[53:05] I'd rather see him down there in a
[53:06] church than see a barroom stand there on
[53:08] the corner would you sure so just let it
[53:10] alone God can use it anyhow maybe not
[53:12] very much but he'll use what he can use
[53:14] as much as he'll let him use that's
[53:16] right so that's kind of a rude way to
[53:18] express anything but I well I hope you
[53:21] get the truth that I mean what what is
[53:23] meant see he can't believe in
[53:25] discernment and the power of God is
[53:27] Promised for this days those Pharisees
[53:29] couldn't do it either they couldn't see
[53:30] Jesus being God oh no you make yourself
[53:33] God a man one day he was standing there
[53:35] at you multiplied loaves of bread and so
[53:37] forth far then and he said um unless you
[53:40] eat the the bread uh the son of man's
[53:43] body and drink his blood uh there's no
[53:45] life in you oh imagine this congregation
[53:48] they walked away from me this man
[53:51] expects us to be a cannibal eat
[53:52] somebody's flesh oh that's crazy Doctors
[53:55] medical doctors and so forth said the
[53:57] man's insane that's all there is the
[53:59] priest is right that man is crazy give
[54:01] us his body to eat that's all he said
[54:03] see but the spiritual mind maybe they
[54:06] could not understand it those disciples
[54:08] they didn't know just exactly what it
[54:10] meant but they believed it anyhow
[54:12] because where did it come from it come
[54:15] from the one they know to be the Son of
[54:17] God I might not be able to understand
[54:19] all in here but I believe it it's God's
[54:23] word I want to separate myself from
[54:25] anything is contrary to it I've tried to
[54:28] stand like that notice another group the
[54:32] 70 he called one day he standing talking
[54:34] to them and he said the son of man shall
[54:38] Ascend up into heaven from whence he
[54:40] come from they said this man he's taking
[54:43] us to the place he was born we know his
[54:45] mother Mary while we know his brothers
[54:47] we know all and then this man's going to
[54:49] take a the son of man is coming going up
[54:52] into heaven from when he come from he
[54:55] come from Bethlehem
[54:56] how did he do that see he said it in
[54:58] that way see and they walked with him no
[55:01] more they walked away they said ah this
[55:04] man we know there's something wrong with
[55:05] him them disciples sat right there see
[55:08] they believed they had seen the promised
[55:12] word for that day Vindicated and
[55:15] manifested by who could create but God
[55:18] himself could take bread and they know
[55:21] he was a Son of God whether it was in
[55:22] riddles or not that whether they
[55:24] understood it or not they walked right
[55:26] on anyhow because the word was
[55:28] Vindicated and they were separated from
[55:31] anything contrary to it thank God help
[55:33] us to have faith like that we believe
[55:36] this Bible to be the truth I may not
[55:38] have faith enough to make all the
[55:39] promises come to pass but I believe it
[55:42] anyhow amen I believe the hour that
[55:45] we're living Joseph separated from his
[55:47] Brethren Without a Cause now what was
[55:51] the matter with him he was not willing
[55:53] to be separated it wasn't his will to
[55:55] separate but they separated themselves
[55:57] from him see from his bright shiny
[56:01] dollar their penni's worth couldn't
[56:03] stand it they know they were Patriarchs
[56:06] they know that Isaac was their U pardon
[56:09] me Jacob was their father and they know
[56:11] that to be true but Joseph was born he
[56:14] couldn't help
[56:15] it he was spiritual he saw Visions could
[56:20] interpret dreams and they were perfectly
[56:22] right whatever he said was the
[56:25] truth and his patriarch Brothers moved
[56:28] with Indy and sold him to the
[56:31] Egyptians see they they separated
[56:34] themselves from him because they were
[56:37] pennies he was of a different
[56:40] quality so is a real believer today he's
[56:43] of a different
[56:46] quality they'll separate themselves they
[56:50] don't understand it Copper from
[56:53] Silver now we find out they move within
[56:56] the insulting why they do the same thing
[57:01] today what it really was they said they
[57:04] were it was for
[57:06] jealousy they didn't want to break down
[57:09] because if the quality in them were not
[57:13] the quality was in him and because of it
[57:16] they were jealous because they were
[57:18] pennies and he was a dollar see now if
[57:21] the penny say blessed be the name of the
[57:23] Lord my brother dollar here see I can't
[57:26] make the change that he does but I'll
[57:28] make what I can that's that we go along
