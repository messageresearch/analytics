[49:06] all right
[49:07] well let's tune to our Bibles now
[49:10] um I have three portions of scripture to
[49:13] read from book of Saint Matthew from
[49:16] also from Saint Matthew chapter 3. from
[49:18] Saint John chapter 3 and then also from
[49:21] Zechariah 4 6 and 7. so I'm actually
[49:25] going back to the Old Testament
[49:26] in the end
[49:28] but that's just how God showed to me
[49:30] amen so I just kind of go with that
[49:33] so you could just make a markup for
[49:34] Zechariah we'll go back there in the
[49:36] last but the first scripture we want to
[49:38] read from is saying Matthew chapter 3
[49:39] and verse 11. amen
[49:44] um
[49:45] and it says
[49:46] and this is a
[49:48] John
[49:50] ministering to the people while he was
[49:52] baptizing them onto repentance right
[49:55] he said I indeed baptize you with water
[49:57] unto repentance
[49:59] but he that cometh after me
[50:01] is mightier than I am
[50:04] whose shoes I am not worthy to bear
[50:07] he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost
[50:11] and with fire
[50:14] whose fan is in his hand
[50:16] and he will throw uh thoroughly Purge
[50:20] his floor
[50:21] and gather his wheat into the Ghana
[50:24] but he will burn up the chaff
[50:27] with unquenchable fire
[50:30] and we know what the chaff is right
[50:31] that's that's the ungodly man like the
[50:33] chaff which the Wind Drive it away amen
[50:35] praise God but he's gonna gather his
[50:37] wheat and that's you and I this morning
[50:39] amen
[50:41] Saint John chapter 3. I want to read
[50:43] from verse 3 to 7. this is Jesus witness
[50:48] into Nicodemus
[50:51] familiar scripture but we want to just
[50:52] pull this out here this morning for our
[50:54] context
[50:55] see in John chapter 3 and verse 3.
[50:59] Jesus answered and said unto him
[51:03] verily verily I say unto thee except a
[51:07] man be born again
[51:09] he cannot see the kingdom of God
[51:12] Nicodemus said unto him how can a man be
[51:15] born when he is old
[51:17] can he enter the second time into his
[51:21] mother's womb and be born
[51:23] Jesus answered verily verily I say unto
[51:26] thee
[51:27] except a man be born of water and of the
[51:31] spirit
[51:32] he cannot enter into the kingdom of God
[51:36] that which is born of the flesh is flesh
[51:39] and that which is born of the spirit is
[51:42] Spirit
[51:43] Marvel not that I said unto thee ye must
[51:47] be born again
[51:50] amen praise and evil alone
[51:53] and uh Zechariah Chapter 4.
[51:57] amen the old
[51:59] Testament
[52:01] reading just six and seven
[52:04] and that should close us out here
[52:07] then he answered and speak unto me
[52:09] saying
[52:10] this is the word of the Lord unto
[52:13] zerubbabel
[52:14] saying not by might
[52:16] nor by power
[52:18] but by my spirit
[52:20] saith the Lord of hosts
[52:23] who are thou o great Mountain before
[52:26] zoruba Bell Thou shalt become a plane
[52:30] and he shall bring forth The Headstone
[52:33] thereof with shoutings crying Grace
[52:36] Grace unto it may God add blessing to
[52:40] the reading of his wound let us pray one
[52:42] more time

[52:47] but to take God and your spirit father
[52:50] to bring it to life Lord

[52:55] your spirit we pray that your anointing
[52:57] would come down for a few moments and

[54:19] work of the spirit

[56:11] the Holy Spirit and he is here this

[56:16] according to his riches in glory and he
[56:20] is able to supply
[56:22] your every need according to his riches
[56:25] in glory do you believe that this
[56:28] morning can you somebody say Amen
[56:31] hallelujah amen so let's get started
[56:35] so for hundreds of years
[56:38] Israel was without a prophet in the land
[56:41] isn't that right
[56:43] but when Jesus came
[56:45] on the earth his coming introduced a new
[56:49] season
[56:50] it's not right
[56:52] from the time of his birth God begins to
[56:54] do something
[56:55] Supernatural on the earth coming to from
[56:59] the announcement of John isn't that
[57:01] right coming all the way down to his
[57:02] peculiar birth
[57:04] God begins to move upon the Earth isn't
[57:07] that right
[57:08] God calls John out
[57:11] a separated one
[57:13] isn't that right named him John
[57:16] brother would like to say he didn't call
[57:18] him over dial or Zachariah
[57:21] Zephaniah oh hi guy he wasn't he wasn't
[57:25] a hubba hey he was not I don't know
[57:27] I said that he was just John
[57:30] oh that's all you get
[57:33] one crime in the wilderness
[57:36] the voice of one crime in the wilderness
[57:39] seem like nobody's listening seem like
[57:42] nobody cares but that was God's way of
[57:46] preparing away for his coming he used A
[57:50] peculiar man to prepare his way
[57:54] I love how God does things when God
[57:57] calls somebody he does it his way
[58:01] he calls his man the world calls it
[58:04] funny and and silly and daughter praise
[58:07] God but what God man calls foolish God
[58:10] calls wisdom and what God calls wisdom
[58:13] man calls foolish the Bible says my ways
[58:18] are higher than your ways and my
[58:21] thoughts are higher than your thoughts
[58:24] your thoughts will perish in a day but
[58:27] his thoughts are Eternal this morning
[58:30] they are from eternity to Eternity and
[58:33] when God thought about you this morning
[58:36] his thoughts were perfect his thoughts
[58:39] were finished Thy word O Lord is settled
[58:43] in heaven forever and in his thoughts he
[58:47] loved you in his thoughts he saw you
[58:50] anointed in his thoughts he saw you
[58:53] commissioned in his thoughts he saw you
[58:57] filled with the Holy Ghost in his
[59:00] thoughts he saw you crushing the devil
[59:04] under your feet he saw them Kings under
[59:09] your feet all the heads of them kings in
[59:13] the palm of your hand he saw you
[59:15] Victorious he saw you conquering or the
[59:19] Devil is a lion this morning because in
[59:22] God all things are possible and we are
[59:26] more and conquerors through him that
[59:30] loved us and what can separate us this
[59:35] morning from the love of God that
[59:39] stretch his arm wide on the cross he
[59:44] loved you and made a way for you to
[59:48] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[59:52] and with fire a new badge in your soul
[59:57] somebody say Amen

[1:00:24] effect it's gonna turn into spirit it's
[1:00:28] gonna turn into Supernatural and the
[1:00:31] devil will be crushed on the foot the
[1:00:35] devil will be broken against the power
[1:00:38] of the supernatural God oh I believe
[1:00:43] he's here this morning he's here to give
[1:00:46] you a baptism a glorious a wonderful
[1:00:52] baptism of the Holy Ghost and with fire

[1:01:45] people isn't that right

[1:01:58] prepare away
[1:02:00] for this coming of the Lord Jesus
[1:02:03] he was baptizing the people in water
[1:02:06] and we know that God promised us in
[1:02:07] Scripture a baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:02:10] and Fire
[1:02:12] it's promised and it is unto you
[1:02:16] and to your children
[1:02:18] and as many as them are far off and as
[1:02:21] many as the Lord or God shall call
[1:02:23] he promised to claim the People by fire
[1:02:27] fire to burn the demons out to burn out
[1:02:30] everything
[1:02:31] and put God in the soul and make you a
[1:02:35] real Christian to make you to walk after
[1:02:38] his statues and to walk after these
[1:02:42] virtues he's gonna put that in you not
[1:02:46] by might not by power but by my spirit
[1:02:51] said the Lord of hosts who is this Green
[1:02:54] Mountain that stands in before you this
[1:02:57] morning
[1:02:58] Thou shalt become a plane and he shall
[1:03:02] bring forth a headstone or which
[1:03:05] shoutens nothing that we could have done
[1:03:08] but the grace of almighty God oh it
[1:03:13] won't be by that prayer but if God ever
[1:03:16] pours out his Spirit upon the church
[1:03:20] it'll be by the grace of almighty God
[1:03:25] can somebody say Amen
[1:03:29] hmm
[1:03:31] Hallelujah
[1:03:32] boring
[1:03:34] Hallelujah
[1:03:38] so is that the introduction of Jesus
[1:03:39] that this fire baptism is actually
[1:03:42] mentioned in John's Ministry
[1:03:44] as he is baptized in the people in water
[1:03:47] down at the Jordan it's not right
[1:03:49] for repentance
[1:03:52] and he asks John to identify himself
[1:03:55] some I'm told Pharisees went down
[1:03:58] to question his ministry it's not
[1:04:01] everyone who are the where you come from
[1:04:04] what what do we say about you
[1:04:07] and what did John do
[1:04:09] he gave them the word
[1:04:11] this is the scripture here Saint John 1
[1:04:13] 21.
[1:04:15] and they asked him what then adult Elias
[1:04:18] and he said I am not
[1:04:20] at all that prophet and he answered no
[1:04:23] and they said unto him
[1:04:25] that we may give an answer to them that
[1:04:27] sent us what's the power of thyself
[1:04:31] and he said I am the voice of one
[1:04:34] crying in the wilderness
[1:04:36] make straight
[1:04:38] the way of the Lord
[1:04:40] has said the prophet his eyes
[1:04:43] and day that was sent was sent out of
[1:04:46] Pharisees so that's right and they asked
[1:04:48] him and said unto him why baptize it
[1:04:51] thou then
[1:04:52] if thou be not that Christ or Elias
[1:04:55] neither that prophet and John answered
[1:04:58] them saying I baptize with water
[1:05:01] but there's time that one among you
[1:05:04] so he's already here
[1:05:06] if you think he's that he's about to be
[1:05:08] born he's already on the earth oh hell
[1:05:10] he's already standing among you
[1:05:13] whom you know not oh this morning you
[1:05:16] better be on expectation he's standing
[1:05:18] among you you may not see him with your
[1:05:21] natural eye but prophecy is about to be
[1:05:25] fulfilled it's about to switch from the
[1:05:28] prophet to his prophecy he's already
[1:05:31] standing among you you better get ready
[1:05:34] this morning you better get your heart
[1:05:36] right get your eyes lifted up towards
[1:05:39] heaven and let your pants legs be
[1:05:43] bragged at the knees and keep on praying
[1:05:46] until this one that standeth among you
[1:05:50] oh he also John said he's going to do
[1:05:53] here it is Who coming after me is
[1:05:56] preferred before me whose shoes lasted I
[1:05:59] am not worthy to unloose he's gonna
[1:06:02] baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with
[1:06:06] fire
[1:06:08] oh hallelujah
[1:06:11] hallelujah do you believe it
[1:06:14] amen let me read somebody having a
[1:06:17] prophet Amen on the sadism Church h
[1:06:21] Prophet said Satan is the greatest
[1:06:23] sophist
[1:06:24] amen I looked up the word surface it
[1:06:26] actually means a person who reasons with
[1:06:28] clever but false arguments
[1:06:32] so he's a debater
[1:06:34] he liked to argue
[1:06:37] he like to just ask a question with the
[1:06:41] purpose of provocation
[1:06:43] to Pro hook
[1:06:44] well what about this
[1:06:46] huh does that sound familiar you shall
[1:06:49] not surely die
[1:06:51] Same Spirit
[1:06:52] got it so but Prophet said Satan is the
[1:06:55] greatest sophist
[1:06:57] and he has never been overcome wow in a
[1:07:01] Strife of words hear it
[1:07:04] in Divine service
[1:07:06] the words of man are usually heard more
[1:07:09] than the word of God
[1:07:11] each one Chatters as he pleases
[1:07:14] or kills time I like that
[1:07:17] by learning disquisitions
[1:07:19] and disproving the views of others
[1:07:22] argumentative
[1:07:24] of the new birth the prophet said
[1:07:26] and how a man must be changed into the
[1:07:29] likeness of Christ
[1:07:31] to become a partaker
[1:07:33] of the divine nature
[1:07:36] II Peter 1 4. scarcely anything is said
[1:07:42] isn't that time
[1:07:43] like we've come to a condition today
[1:07:46] where of the new but
[1:07:48] and how a man must be changed into the
[1:07:51] likeness of Jesus Christ
[1:07:52] all man must be born again
[1:07:55] received the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:07:58] the prophet said you can't shake hands
[1:08:00] into the into the church you can write
[1:08:03] your name down on a book and become a
[1:08:05] member of this body that's not how you
[1:08:07] become a member of this body you become
[1:08:10] a member of this body by that same
[1:08:13] Spirit has to come into you you've got
[1:08:17] to be born again to be a member of the
[1:08:21] True Church of God

[1:08:26] church the born Church the Holy Ghost
[1:08:29] filled Church the Spirit-filled church
[1:08:32] is a church filled with Spirit-filled
[1:08:35] individuals Spirit-filled people so I
[1:08:38] didn't come here this morning to write

[1:08:48] receive the same Penny the same Holy
[1:08:52] Ghost The Same Spirit that Peter
[1:08:55] received on the day of Pentecost the
[1:08:59] same holy ghost that Mary received and

[1:09:05] same Holy Ghost has got to come into you

[1:09:15] Church you're just dressing up and
[1:09:18] looking nice to come to a nice building

[1:09:23] sent a prophet 50 plus years in this
[1:09:26] message for us to just take up space for
[1:09:29] us to just shake hands and for us to
[1:09:31] just go home but I came to meet God
[1:09:35] I came to get into contact with
[1:09:38] something Supernatural I'm fed up of
[1:09:41] myself I need a change I need a
[1:09:45] manifested reality of the abiding

[1:12:06] God so
[1:12:07] the prophet is saying here
[1:12:10] about this new bird
[1:12:13] scarcely anything is being said
[1:12:16] that's a disturbing thing
[1:12:20] shut up means they've intellectualized
[1:12:23] it
[1:12:25] come down to our knowledge thing
[1:12:27] who know more than who
[1:12:29] who reads more scripture more than who
[1:12:32] that ain't the point
[1:12:34] that is not what Jesus died for
[1:12:37] [Applause]
[1:12:38] died so that we could come into this
[1:12:40] image
[1:12:42] that's what he died for
[1:12:44] he was tortured beaten and bruised
[1:12:47] to make a way for you to come to
[1:12:50] perfection
[1:12:51] foreign
[1:12:53] [Applause]
[1:12:55] tried to keep this from you
[1:12:58] but we're gonna speak it
[1:13:00] seven Thunders are the seven voices of
[1:13:03] the seven Church Ages which are seven
[1:13:06] manifestations of one Holy Spirit into
[1:13:10] you as to take a live voice virtual live
[1:13:13] voice knowledge of live voice tempering
[1:13:16] to live voice patience to live voice
[1:13:18] godliness will live voice brutally
[1:13:21] kindness or live voice
[1:13:23] and when God sees all them virtues in
[1:13:25] you he drops down charity that Capstone
[1:13:29] of love
[1:13:30] to make you a complete
[1:13:32] and sealed unit of Jesus Christ and that
[1:13:36] is the servant of God that goes into the
[1:13:38] rapture
[1:13:39] oh Hallelujah
[1:13:42] oh no wonder the pyramid has never
[1:13:44] capped
[1:13:45] God is waiting on you
[1:13:47] to come down in this last age and cap
[1:13:50] you off and bring up the dead in Christ
[1:13:52] the Perfection will be
[1:13:55] the reflection amen
[1:13:57] really Perfection
[1:13:59] oh my all right
[1:14:02] well
[1:14:04] so Prophet goes on he said church has
[1:14:06] almost lost a power binding
[1:14:07] only the power of losing remain
[1:14:10] the sacraments given us symbols of unity
[1:14:12] and love and all life in Christ
[1:14:15] have made the occasion of bitterest
[1:14:16] conflict
[1:14:17] a cause of mutual hatred
[1:14:19] a center of sectarianism
[1:14:22] different sects
[1:14:24] different foreign factions
[1:14:28] wow Mercy in short he said Christendom
[1:14:30] or Christianity has become a labyrinth
[1:14:34] a puzzle
[1:14:35] and the faith has been split into a
[1:14:37] thousand little parts
[1:14:39] and you are made a heretic if there is
[1:14:41] one of them that you don't accept
[1:14:43] yeah it'll make you odds it's not right
[1:14:47] our Oddball so what can help only the
[1:14:49] one thing needful
[1:14:51] Prophet said Return to Christ
[1:14:53] and that's what we want to do this
[1:14:54] morning
[1:14:55] turn Eyes Upon Jesus and look full into
[1:14:59] his wonderful face and receive the
[1:15:02] baptism of the Holy Ghost on Fire
[1:15:05] let him change us
[1:15:07] when Moses came down from the mountain
[1:15:09] it was noticeable his countenance was
[1:15:12] different his face Shone with the glory
[1:15:15] of God he looked like somebody who
[1:15:19] finally had it all figured out
[1:15:22] and it only took five minutes
[1:15:24] [Applause]
[1:15:27] for 40 years in the wilderness questions
[1:15:30] questions
[1:15:31] but one uh experience in the fire
[1:15:35] and he come out different and that's
[1:15:37] what we want this morning that's what
[1:15:40] the young people need that's what the
[1:15:42] calebs did that's what we all need this
[1:15:43] morning
[1:15:44] to throw us in the fire oh Hallelujah
[1:15:47] experience in the fire where a man meets
[1:15:51] God and he's changed forever oh
[1:15:54] Hallelujah
[1:15:56] they brought the people to seminaries to
[1:15:58] Creeds to dogmas they bring the people
[1:16:01] to church but the people need to meet
[1:16:04] God they need to meet their same Jesus

[1:16:27] oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:16:30] amen all right let me carry on here now
[1:16:33] so what can help one thing needful
[1:16:34] return to Christ look into Christ as the
[1:16:37] only leader walking in his footsteps
[1:16:39] setting aside all other ways until we
[1:16:41] reach the goal and have come to the
[1:16:43] unity of the faith
[1:16:45] according to Ephesians 4 13.
[1:16:48] now here what Paul says in the New
[1:16:49] Testament concerning this
[1:16:51] he said and I was with you in weakness
[1:16:53] and in fear
[1:16:55] and in much trembling and by speech and
[1:16:59] my preaching was not with enticing words
[1:17:01] of men's wisdom
[1:17:02] but in the demonstration of the spirit
[1:17:06] and of power
[1:17:07] and that your faith should stand not in
[1:17:11] the wisdom of men
[1:17:12] but in the power of God oh that's where
[1:17:15] we stand this morning not on the wisdom
[1:17:18] of man but in the God's power to
[1:17:21] transform or in God's power Hallelujah
[1:17:24] the power of God unto salvation amen
[1:17:27] that's where we stand this morning all
[1:17:28] right in adoption 1916 Prophet said but
[1:17:32] the Believers the Caleb and Joshua
[1:17:35] outfit
[1:17:37] the Caleb and Joshua outfit
[1:17:39] your man look like smell like amen that
[1:17:43] was going on to the promise
[1:17:45] he said they moved over into the land
[1:17:48] and they took the land
[1:17:50] and they settled down in the land
[1:17:52] isn't that right amen as a possession
[1:17:55] he said and we never stop a
[1:17:57] justification
[1:17:58] or a signification he said let's go on
[1:18:01] to the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:18:04] let's not stop Hallelujah I believe it
[1:18:08] on Lord Jesus and being baptized let's
[1:18:11] not stop just because he cleansed us
[1:18:13] from a life of sin but now we press on
[1:18:16] into a position
[1:18:18] oh Hallelujah to a promise of the
[1:18:22] baptism of the Holy Ghost for Peter said
[1:18:26] on the day of Pentecost for This Promise
[1:18:28] is unto you and to your children and to
[1:18:32] them that's a power off and even as many
[1:18:35] as the Lord oh God shall call how that
[1:18:39] God had set some in a church through
[1:18:42] their labor pains or they get tremendous
[1:18:45] sometimes but when a church is grown in
[1:18:47] under the persecution of the outside
[1:18:50] world Believing on the Lord Jesus that
[1:18:54] the promise of the Holy Ghost is just as
[1:18:57] real is it just as real this morning as
[1:19:01] it was on the day of Pentecost how they
[1:19:04] grow own and cry on the labor pains but
[1:19:09] when listen oh Hallelujah but when they
[1:19:12] are born
[1:19:13] and positionally porn into the kingdom
[1:19:17] of God then the Holy Ghost not a man not
[1:19:22] a seminary not an association but when
[1:19:25] the Holy Ghost had set in a church saw
[1:19:29] Apostles some prophets some teachers
[1:19:32] some pastors some evangelists oh
[1:19:36] Hallelujah God's Gonna Give You a
[1:19:38] Ministry when the Holy Ghost when I've
[1:19:41] shame Holy Ghost horns in you are new oh

[1:19:52] that same Holy Ghost is just as real as
[1:19:55] it was on a day of Pentecost other than
[1:19:58] that we are Slackers this morning we are
[1:20:00] playing church and God is Not slack
[1:20:02] concerning his promise as some men count
[1:20:05] slackness but he wants to give it to you
[1:20:08] he wants to fill your life with the
[1:20:11] power of the Holy Ghost more than you
[1:20:13] even know how to receive it but we're

[1:21:22] power but by my spirit things might be
[1:21:26] messed up right now but there's nothing
[1:21:28] that's too messed up that God can't fix
[1:21:31] there's nothing that got too broken that

[1:22:27] marvelous
[1:22:29] earnestly contended for the feet
[1:22:31] that was once delivered to the sins
[1:22:33] that's what they're doing today amen all
[1:22:36] back in the age now the very faith that
[1:22:39] he had at the beginning
[1:22:41] it's supposed to be today yet
[1:22:44] a very fine scholar he said I was having
[1:22:46] a dinner with here some time ago
[1:22:49] you name them Eastern Jones He said that
[1:22:51] brother Branham said he said he said I
[1:22:54] see most of your meeting is made up of
[1:22:56] Pentecostal people
[1:22:58] he said well yes sir
[1:23:00] and the brother said well why so
[1:23:03] he said well they're the ones that
[1:23:06] believe
[1:23:08] and he said well he said he said
[1:23:10] I think that Pentecost was a scaffold
[1:23:14] like a scaffold inside of a building you
[1:23:16] know just
[1:23:17] just outer shell
[1:23:19] and he said that God was going to put up
[1:23:22] a building
[1:23:23] the brother still explaining he said so
[1:23:25] this is his understanding of it I guess
[1:23:26] Brothers explaining he said that God was
[1:23:28] going to put up a building and he
[1:23:31] caused the sky
[1:23:33] said well
[1:23:37] and he said but we'll see after the
[1:23:39] scaffold work is done
[1:23:42] we don't need the scaffold anymore
[1:23:45] he said but the scaffold work isn't done
[1:23:49] he said when the building is completed
[1:23:52] then God Will Take It Up
[1:23:55] he said so we're still working on the
[1:23:57] building
[1:23:59] and if we're still working on the
[1:24:00] building we need a scaffold
[1:24:06] is that
[1:24:07] yes sir
[1:24:09] the prophet said we still need every
[1:24:11] stepladder every step in stone
[1:24:15] so you see people get caught up they get
[1:24:17] caught up in something and they want to
[1:24:18] count people out
[1:24:19] you know
[1:24:21] Jesus called Peter James and John up on
[1:24:22] the hill mount Transfiguration it's all
[1:24:25] glory and lights all of a sudden they
[1:24:26] want to build three Tabernacle
[1:24:28] Peter's official
[1:24:30] fish for a pretty long time as far as I
[1:24:32] know I don't know him to be a
[1:24:33] construction worker
[1:24:34] so he wants to build three tablet you
[1:24:37] see what I'm saying so people get caught
[1:24:39] up in the flesh thing
[1:24:41] and because want to count people out
[1:24:44] because they found something here now I
[1:24:46] don't want to kick kick you know kind of
[1:24:48] discount others just get caught up in
[1:24:51] themselves shall we call on fire like
[1:24:53] Elijah did huh because they're not
[1:24:55] moving at us you see that same thing
[1:24:58] see it super Prophet said yes sir we
[1:25:00] still need a every stepladder every
[1:25:03] stepping stone we need everything just
[1:25:05] exactly the building is still in the
[1:25:07] making yeah yeah and when it's completed
[1:25:10] this gospel is to be preached to every
[1:25:12] Kindred tongue and Nation
[1:25:15] and then Jesus will return that's right
[1:25:18] he said now we've had plenty of passing
[1:25:21] out of tracks and theology around the
[1:25:23] world
[1:25:24] but the gospel is not the Bible
[1:25:25] altogether
[1:25:27] the Bible Paul said that the gospel came
[1:25:29] to us not in word only but through Power
[1:25:31] and demonstrations of the Holy Ghost
[1:25:34] and then when Jesus said go into all the
[1:25:36] world and preach the gospel to Every
[1:25:38] Creature then he meant go into all the
[1:25:41] world and demonstrate the power of God
[1:25:43] to Every Creature
[1:25:45] oh so this gospel is not in word only
[1:25:48] but it's in power and demonstration out
[1:25:51] there oh Hallelujah going out into the
[1:25:54] world oh hallelujah hallelujah and
[1:25:57] whosoever will let them come pray God
[1:26:00] God seed out there they may be in
[1:26:02] different places different groups or
[1:26:04] whatever but when that David takes the
[1:26:06] rock of the Revelation Hallelujah and
[1:26:09] smashes it into Goliath's forehead the
[1:26:12] Sheep of God will come screaming out out
[1:26:15] of every group out of every nation out
[1:26:18] of every tunnel are aware of a goal
[1:26:20] Forge into all the world and preach the
[1:26:23] gospel
[1:26:24] hey many many men and let them know who
[1:26:28] Jesus is amen then they'll come out
[1:26:32] you see
[1:26:33] praise God it's about the people it's
[1:26:35] the organizations that get mixed up you
[1:26:38] see Pentecost been spewed out on the
[1:26:40] mount the organization praise God
[1:26:42] because they misconstrue the word praise
[1:26:44] God but there's genuine seeds out there
[1:26:46] that God's going to save and deliver and
[1:26:48] redeem we don't know who they are praise
[1:26:51] God but wait we want to be the body of
[1:26:53] Christ
[1:26:54] and if God has a body then why is his
[1:26:56] hands not reaching why is his eyes not
[1:26:59] seeing why is his mouth not speaking
[1:27:01] means we need to be under con the
[1:27:03] Supreme control of God so that when he
[1:27:06] wants to move he can move with us oh and
[1:27:09] the spirit needs to move he can move and
[1:27:12] touch somebody and heal somebody and
[1:27:15] pray for somebody and enter into
[1:27:17] somebody's suffering to have forgiveness
[1:27:20] to have kindness to have patience to
[1:27:23] have Temperance with your brother
[1:27:25] knowing what's in their hearts going
[1:27:27] with them the extra mile doing whatever
[1:27:30] it takes on suffering that none should
[1:27:34] be lost oh Hallelujah that's what it's
[1:27:36] all about
[1:27:37] praise God Amen oh Hallelujah
[1:27:42] amen
[1:27:44] it's not right so in order to preach a
[1:27:46] gospel before you can make it a gospel
[1:27:49] preach then you have to have the power
[1:27:52] and demonstration of the Holy Spirit
[1:27:55] to prove the gospel
[1:27:57] the letter kill it the word the letter
[1:28:01] kill it but the spirit make it alive
[1:28:04] so we need the spirit this morning we've
[1:28:07] had the word for over 50 years in this
[1:28:10] message but what we need is a spirit to
[1:28:14] make that word live otherwise we just be
[1:28:17] a nice Christians or a nice church or
[1:28:20] group of people coming together but
[1:28:23] where is the spirit oh we need the
[1:28:25] spirit of God to make the thing work we
[1:28:29] need put too much stress on the
[1:28:31] mechanics but not enough on the Dynamics
[1:28:34] the thing that pulse hates it the things
[1:28:37] that makes it move we need Jesus in
[1:28:41] every heart in every life and in every
[1:28:44] soul to make the world live and then
[1:28:47] you'll see real Christianity then you'll
[1:28:50] see people really forgiving from their
[1:28:53] heart really to in the work of God
[1:28:56] really living really reaching out really
[1:29:00] doing all it takes Hallelujah
[1:29:03] whoa Glory Glory Glory
[1:29:07] outside of that
[1:29:09] we just occupying time amen but we need
[1:29:12] a manifestation
[1:29:13] and God promised it and we're here to
[1:29:16] wait for it until he send it we can't go
[1:29:20] on our own minds we can't go on our own
[1:29:22] feelings we can't go with a little
[1:29:24] sprinkle or a shower that is not what
[1:29:27] our Bible tells me he tells me in those
[1:29:30] days he told us he'll pour out his
[1:29:32] Spirit upon All Flesh All Flesh o code
[1:29:37] preach the gospel to Every Creature such
[1:29:39] as would be saved or upon All Flesh your
[1:29:43] sons and daughters shall prophesy young
[1:29:47] man shall or seat Visions all men are
[1:29:50] gonna dream dreams the gospel is gonna
[1:29:52] be preached and then the end shall come
[1:29:55] oh don't look for the end from Putin or
[1:29:59] from Biden or from somebody else no no
[1:30:01] this gospel must be preached in power
[1:30:05] and in demonstration of the Holy Ghost
[1:30:08] when you see the sick being here when
[1:30:11] you see the blind eyes opening up when
[1:30:13] you see people will be in one by one
[1:30:15] baptized into the kingdom of God coming
[1:30:19] down from off the mountain with power
[1:30:22] and demonstrations proven the adoption
[1:30:25] that is upon them then we are ready for
[1:30:28] the Rapture and not before God's gonna
[1:30:31] have a church that's going to beat the
[1:30:33] devil running before the resurrection
[1:30:36] before the resurrection you're gonna be

[1:38:59] first thing
[1:39:00] you can't put the cupola on before the
[1:39:02] foundation is lead see so we got to
[1:39:04] remember that put the first things first
[1:39:08] you must be born again
[1:39:10] then we could build this
[1:39:13] after that the Holy Ghost come upon you
[1:39:14] you could make yourself a Christian
[1:39:18] or do you see it now the foundation got
[1:39:20] to be lame first things first so seek ye
[1:39:23] the kingdom freaky first the kingdom of
[1:39:25] God and his righteousness and all these
[1:39:29] other things shall be added unto you but
[1:39:32] Abraham said I'm be not afraid he said
[1:39:34] as David dupless said one time he said
[1:39:36] God has no grandchildren that's right he
[1:39:41] said we getting too many grandchildren
[1:39:42] in Pentecost that's right God doesn't
[1:39:46] have a grandchild nowhere in the Bible
[1:39:49] says God has a grandchild God has sons
[1:39:52] and daughters but not grandchildren Oh I
[1:39:57] thought no second generation no no all
[1:40:00] our sons all must be rebuked all must be
[1:40:03] corrected all of us gotta be
[1:40:05] straightened out and all of us have got
[1:40:07] to receive that same penny that same
[1:40:11] Holy Spirit a promise oh
[1:40:14] Hallelujah you've got to receive it
[1:40:17] because you are his daughter because you
[1:40:20] are his son you're going to receive your
[1:40:23] personal presentation oh believe it this
[1:40:27] morning walk in it this morning say it
[1:40:30] speak it anointed to yourself oh that
[1:40:33] promise is coming oh just shows anything
[1:40:37] it's coming this morning so don't be
[1:40:39] afraid
[1:40:40] let the devil get you all caught up in
[1:40:42] your mind in your human spirit it's easy
[1:40:45] because we connected there please go we
[1:40:46] had to go to work we have to do this to
[1:40:47] do that but remember the promise that he
[1:40:50] made hallelujah oh I remember the
[1:40:53] promise praise God because we can hold
[1:40:55] him to he's obligated to fulfill his
[1:40:58] promise word isn't that right all right
[1:41:00] he said go to another grandchild no end
[1:41:02] the Bible says God has grandchildren
[1:41:04] he's not no what it is
[1:41:06] now the First Methodist Revival they
[1:41:08] were Sons and Daughters of God
[1:41:09] and then there he said the old time was
[1:41:12] brought in their children and just put
[1:41:13] them in the Methodist Church
[1:41:15] that's exactly what the Pentecostals had
[1:41:17] done he said what is it the old timers
[1:41:19] that used to pray all night long
[1:41:21] the old-timers that had real real
[1:41:23] genuine salvation
[1:41:25] they come in the Pentecost they got the
[1:41:28] Holy Ghost they brought their children
[1:41:30] and put them on the cradle and roll them
[1:41:32] down there and the first thing you know
[1:41:34] we got grandchildren in Pentecost oh so
[1:41:38] they didn't come through the same boat
[1:41:39] that the old timers did that's how you
[1:41:42] end up with grandchildren all right so
[1:41:44] it can't be just joined in church
[1:41:46] everybody got to come to that same door
[1:41:49] oh you got to be wearing the same
[1:41:51] garments oh the same wedding garment oh
[1:41:56] not because daddy did it not because
[1:41:58] Mommy did it means you gonna just come
[1:42:00] in praise God that's not how it works oh
[1:42:03] you got to meet the same Jesus that they
[1:42:05] met you got to have your own personal
[1:42:07] experience like they had you've got to
[1:42:10] get into contact with the Holy Ghost
[1:42:11] with the god that created you you got to
[1:42:14] go back to the manufacturer get back in
[1:42:17] contact with the god that made you you
[1:42:20] were fearfully and wondering wonderfully
[1:42:22] made God Made You for a purpose and only
[1:42:25] his Spirit only his life could work in
[1:42:29] you only his life could work in this
[1:42:31] bride that's why we'll never be
[1:42:33] satisfied with what the world has to
[1:42:36] offer because there's something else out
[1:42:38] there that is calling me there's a real
[1:42:42] Spirit a real anointing
[1:42:45] oh a new bit
[1:42:47] and I've got to have it this morning
[1:42:49] hallelujah oh my see the Old Times by
[1:42:53] the children and right likely
[1:42:55] it's component now and they're all
[1:42:58] they all everyone born into his kingdom
[1:43:00] Sons and Daughters of God Amen
[1:43:03] Sons and Daughters not grandchildren God
[1:43:05] don't have any
[1:43:07] they are all sons and daughters
[1:43:09] he said and that's why today
[1:43:11] the message blinds the people so much
[1:43:14] because they're not used to seeing the
[1:43:16] supernatural
[1:43:17] wow there's a profit scene he said we

[1:51:26] God oh let me hurry on
[1:51:28] running late all right one more
[1:51:30] scripture if you want to write it down
[1:51:31] Saint John 12 24 I said let me go to
[1:51:33] jail quick Jesus said if a corner wheat
[1:51:36] falls into the ground and die except it
[1:51:39] die it cannot bring forth another life
[1:51:41] now look one more remark he said and
[1:51:43] remember it's absolutely no to you
[1:51:45] absolutely essential
[1:51:47] unnecessary and compelling and
[1:51:50] compulsory that you receive the Holy
[1:51:54] Ghost now for if you don't you can't
[1:51:57] come in the resurrection he said now
[1:51:59] watch your glory oh that's serious oh
[1:52:02] that's not cornflakes you can't come in
[1:52:04] a resurrection if you don't have the
[1:52:06] Holy Ghost that's what the prophet said
[1:52:08] he said now watch you cannot break God
[1:52:11] cannot break his laws he said we know
[1:52:14] that he has to follow his laws amen
[1:52:17] isn't that right I never greet him a
[1:52:19] wheat will take like Jesus out there
[1:52:21] corn in the Bible just reading it today
[1:52:23] flocks any kind of seed or whatever
[1:52:24] right he said it's a corn but when the
[1:52:26] corn falls into the ground now he said
[1:52:28] there's all of us here has know what has
[1:52:30] happened a corner of wheat or a grain of
[1:52:32] corn can look as perfect as it can be
[1:52:36] but when you put it in the ground if
[1:52:37] that corn it has a Perpetual life he
[1:52:40] said it'll go down today and it will
[1:52:42] reproduce itself in a stalk and come
[1:52:45] back and down and go up again and come
[1:52:47] back down it's perpetual life and if
[1:52:50] that corn hasn't got a germ of life in
[1:52:52] it no matter how beautiful it looks
[1:52:54] it'll never raise it'll go into the
[1:52:57] ground and just rot and that's it part
[1:52:59] of it the materials can be used for
[1:53:01] fertilizing things but as far as it's
[1:53:03] never living again it'll never live
[1:53:04] until it's God Perpetual life
[1:53:08] eternal life in it he said anyone knows
[1:53:10] that amen efficient uh Romans 8 14 for
[1:53:15] as many as I led by the spirit of God
[1:53:17] they are the sons of God for we are not
[1:53:20] received the spirit of bondage again to
[1:53:22] fear but we have received the spirit of
[1:53:26] adoption whereby we cry Our Father the
[1:53:31] spirit itself parrot witness with our
[1:53:35] spirit that we are the children of God
[1:53:39] I'm looking this morning for the spirit
[1:53:42] itself to come down and tell you who you
[1:53:46] are that you are predestinated to be
[1:53:48] conformed to the image of his son the
[1:53:52] spirit itself is gonna let you know that
[1:53:54] you are Son of God when he fills you
[1:53:57] with the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:54:01] Empire and dramatizes that seed or our
[1:54:05] predestination in you Hallelujah Oh
[1:54:08] Glory hey many men do you believe it
[1:54:12] this morning amen
[1:54:14] and now we know that Ephesians parallel
[1:54:16] Joshua is not right
[1:54:17] and when the children of Israel is
[1:54:19] getting ready to take the land the God
[1:54:20] had promised to their father that he
[1:54:21] would give them he had dare to go
[1:54:23] through a process isn't that right
[1:54:25] Joshua 5. I'm not going to read this out
[1:54:27] quick and it came to pass when all the
[1:54:29] kings of the amorites which are on the
[1:54:31] side of Jordan Westwood
[1:54:33] and all of the kings of the Canaanites
[1:54:34] which are by the sea
[1:54:36] heard that the Lord had dried up the
[1:54:38] Waters of Jordan from before the
[1:54:40] children of Israel when the Kings heard
[1:54:42] a report until they were Passover that
[1:54:45] their heart melted the devil's heart is
[1:54:48] gonna melt one of these days when you
[1:54:51] come forth in power when you step out of
[1:54:54] the pages of this Bible and you begin to
[1:54:57] conquer your land just to hear the
[1:54:59] report oh are they gonna be in a tizzier
[1:55:02] but it'll be them seven Thunder Sons
[1:55:04] coming forth in power come important
[1:55:07] sweetness come important humility
[1:55:09] conquering as they go oh Joel's Army
[1:55:13] will be on the Move I'm looking for this
[1:55:16] morning that's what's locked up in each
[1:55:18] and every one of you this morning I
[1:55:20] believe in Hollywood of fact Hallelujah
[1:55:22] Oh Glory I know it praise God Amen you
[1:55:26] might not think much of yourself but
[1:55:28] your Mighty Man of Allah God said so
[1:55:31] amen praise God hallelujah oh man
[1:55:36] except from before the children their
[1:55:37] heart melted neither was there spirit in
[1:55:39] them anymore
[1:55:40] because of the children of Israel oh
[1:55:43] just a report alone conquer the enemy
[1:55:45] and they know what to expect and at that
[1:55:48] time the Lord said unto Joshua make thee
[1:55:49] sharp dance
[1:55:51] and circumcise again the children of
[1:55:54] Israel the second time
[1:55:56] and Joshua made him sharp knives and
[1:55:59] circumcised the children of Israel at
[1:56:02] the hill of the four skins they went
[1:56:05] forth a circumcision when they had come
[1:56:07] in isn't that right
[1:56:09] and he said and this is the cause why
[1:56:12] Joshua did circumcise all the people
[1:56:15] that came out of Egypt that were males
[1:56:18] even the men of War
[1:56:20] died in the wilderness by the way after
[1:56:24] they came out of Egypt and they said now
[1:56:26] all the people that came out were
[1:56:28] circumcised but all the people that were
[1:56:31] born in the wilderness by the way as
[1:56:34] they came forth out of Egypt then they
[1:56:38] had not circumcised for the children of
[1:56:41] Israel walked 40 years in the wilderness
[1:56:44] till all the people that were the men of
[1:56:46] War which came out of Egypt were
[1:56:49] consumed because they obeyed not the
[1:56:52] voice of God unto whom the Lord swear
[1:56:55] that he would not show them the land
[1:56:57] which the Lord swam to their party that
[1:57:00] he would give us a land flowed with milk
[1:57:02] and honey so there's got to come forth a
[1:57:05] circumcision after 40 years in this
[1:57:07] message we've got a new crop this
[1:57:10] morning that has not yet tasted of the
[1:57:13] baptism of the Holy Ghost and Fire of
[1:57:16] the circumcision of the heart we need
[1:57:19] another gilchal need another hell of the
[1:57:22] foreskins we need Joshua the Holy Spirit
[1:57:25] to take a sharp knife and go to the camp
[1:57:28] this morning and begin to circumcise the
[1:57:31] hearts one by one you're gonna be
[1:57:34] circumcised oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:57:37] before you begin to possess your
[1:57:39] Mountain before you begin to possess the
[1:57:41] enemy's Gates there's got to be a
[1:57:43] circumcision go forth in this message in
[1:57:47] this season in this time oh the word of
[1:57:49] God is declaring it hallelujah oh man
[1:57:53] and their children who we raised up in
[1:57:55] their stead them Joshua circumcised oh
[1:57:59] hallelujah hallelujah I thought they
[1:58:01] were uncircumcised because they had not
[1:58:03] circumcised them by the way and it came
[1:58:06] to pass when they had done circumcising
[1:58:08] all the people
[1:58:09] that they are bored in their places in
[1:58:11] the camp until they were whole and then
[1:58:14] the Lord said unto Joshua this day have
[1:58:18] I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from
[1:58:21] off of you where of the name of that
[1:58:24] place today is called gilgal and the
[1:58:27] children of Israel and Captain gilgar
[1:58:29] and kept the Passover on the 14th day of
[1:58:31] the month at The Plains of Jericho and
[1:58:34] they did eat of the old corn of the land
[1:58:37] on the moral after the Passover
[1:58:39] unleavened cakes patch corn in that self
[1:58:42] same day the Bible said and the Mana
[1:58:44] ceased on the moral no more manner no
[1:58:47] more baby stuff let's go back to the old
[1:58:49] corn back to the promises back to the
[1:58:52] the the foundations that was laid down
[1:58:56] on a day of Pentecost have you received
[1:58:58] the Holy Ghost since you believe it yet

[1:59:21] fruit of the land of Canaan and then the
[1:59:23] Bible says it came to pass now when
[1:59:26] Joshua was by Jericho that he lifted up
[1:59:28] his eyes and looked and behold there
[1:59:31] stood a man over against him with his
[1:59:35] sword drawn in his hand and Joshua went
[1:59:37] up to him and said unto him other for us
[1:59:40] or for adversaries and he said near but
[1:59:43] as captain of the host of the Lord am I
[1:59:46] now come and Joshua fell on his face to
[1:59:49] the Earth and did worship and said unto
[1:59:52] him what said my Lord unto his servant

[2:02:12] God circumcises our hearts by the Holy
[2:02:14] Spirit where was done by the flesh with
[2:02:17] hands and the days gone by but it's done
[2:02:19] by the Holy Spirit now and when we
[2:02:22] believe correctly on the Lord Jesus
[2:02:24] Christ God gives the Holy Ghost to us to
[2:02:27] confirm that our faith has been reckoned
[2:02:30] before him and imputed to us for
[2:02:33] righteousness without the Holy Spirit
[2:02:35] he's never recognized it yet
[2:02:38] [Music]
[2:02:41] now this brother was a good Baptist
[2:02:44] brother of mine he said when you receive
[2:02:45] the Holy Ghost you receive the Holy
[2:02:47] Ghost when you believed and I said
[2:02:49] brother in Acts in the 19th Chapter Paul
[2:02:52] passed a good bunch of Baptist Brethren
[2:02:54] there he said he said have you received
[2:02:56] the Holy Ghost since you believed he
[2:02:58] said since you believed have you
[2:03:00] received the Holy Ghost he said the Holy
[2:03:02] Ghost is a confirmation that God has
[2:03:06] accepted your faith a many many men so
[2:03:10] what we need is a confirmation that Khan
[2:03:13] has accepted our faint in this message
[2:03:16] all these years to stay with that word
[2:03:19] God is promised to show you a
[2:03:22] continuation of that word oh he promises
[2:03:25] to send down his Spirit to confirm that
[2:03:27] word and make it alive this morning oh
[2:03:31] hallelujah hallelujah that's what we're
[2:03:33] looking for oh do you believe it this
[2:03:36] morning amen hallelujah hallelujah
[2:03:38] hallelujah position could get ready
[2:03:40] beautiful God took Christ at Calvary
[2:03:44] tore him apart soul and body
[2:03:46] sent it and then the body up to his
[2:03:49] right hand and then he sent the Holy
[2:03:51] Spirit back
[2:03:53] the Covenant with the people and you
[2:03:55] believe by faith like Abraham did and he
[2:03:58] was given the Seal of circumcision for a
[2:04:02] confirmation of his fate and you believe
[2:04:05] and accept Jesus as your savior and when
[2:04:08] you do that and God gives you the
[2:04:11] baptism of the Holy Ghost as a
[2:04:14] confirmation of your faith he said you
[2:04:16] say you believe and haven't received the
[2:04:18] Holy Spirit something wrong with your
[2:04:20] faith God circumcises the heart the very
[2:04:24] minute the believer really comes into
