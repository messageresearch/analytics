[12:57] Thousand Years is as one day
[13:00] 70 years is just like a
[13:03] flash God help us tonight and Minister
[13:07] To Us by Your Word
[13:08] truth God your word declar the time will
[13:11] come when people will not endure some
[13:14] Doctrine but with Heap unto themselves
[13:16] teachers having itching ears things that
[13:20] would consume upon their own lust what
[13:23] they desire to hear what they desire to
[13:25] know what they desire to understand
[13:29] but Lord he has a will for every age
[13:32] there's a word for every age there's a
[13:34] mind of God for every age every time
[13:37] every season there's a reason why you
[13:39] put seasons in
[13:41] time and how everything have a a a
[13:44] season and a time to every purpose under
[13:47] Heaven God there's a purpose and reason
[13:50] why we're in this virtual room tonight
[13:52] technology has afforded us this
[13:54] opportunity that we couldn't have had
[13:56] years ago we want to take take advantage
[13:59] of it we want to take best use of it God
[14:03] and may it be no hyp hypocrisy but we
[14:08] tonight in our own closet in our own
[14:10] rooms in our own homes can talk it over
[14:13] with you as we approach your word
[14:16] tonight minister to us I pray in Jesus
[14:18] name I ask it amen and amen God bless
[14:22] you and we would want to go straight
[14:25] into what we like to share with you
[14:27] tonight before we get down in prayer
[14:30] I a thought I want to share with you
[14:31] when you
[14:32] pray and
[14:36] it's from Luke chapter 11 and I just
[14:39] want to read it and then we going
[14:43] share I believe we read this sometime
[14:47] back it came to pass as he talk about
[14:50] Jesus was praying in a certain place
[14:53] when he
[14:55] ceased one of the disciples said to him
[14:57] Lord teach us to pray as John also
[15:02] taught his
[15:04] disciples and he said unto them when you
[15:07] pray say our father we are in heaven
[15:11] Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come
[15:13] thy will be done as in in heaven so in
[15:16] Earth give us day by day our daily bread
[15:21] and forgive us our sins as we forgive
[15:23] everyone that is in debted to us and
[15:25] lead us not into temptation
[15:29] but Deliver Us from Evil I stop right
[15:33] there but he went on to give a parable
[15:35] just after that I I want to just share
[15:38] this here now you say then brother
[15:41] brandham why is it that we do not do the
[15:44] things that we should do how is it our
[15:47] gifts and things in the church does not
[15:49] come to its color to where it should be
[15:52] how is it our church does not lift up
[15:54] into the spot where it should be the
[15:57] people
[15:59] in the testing
[16:01] time drops away like Israel did they
[16:06] think that God has left
[16:09] them but remember the rock never left
[16:13] Israel Israel left the rock it forgot
[16:17] about the rock being with them all the
[16:19] time it was right there it went right
[16:22] with them to the end of the road it
[16:23] followed them it wasn't out of speaking
[16:27] distance it was wasn't out of hearing
[16:29] distance or it wasn't out of seeing
[16:32] distance and neither is Christ with the
[16:35] church today he is not out of speaking
[16:40] distance some of you have
[16:43] backslid done that which is wrong you
[16:46] have lost your joy your water is dried
[16:49] up he is still and speaking distance of
[16:53] you he follows you he knows every move
[16:58] you make and everything you do he is
[17:02] longing to hear you call him on the
[17:06] scene this is so Sublime this last
[17:09] statement here he is
[17:11] Longing To Hear You Calling on the
[17:17] scene and this great Pentecostal move
[17:19] today God is waiting for you to call him
[17:23] on the scene you're not out of speaking
[17:26] distance with him do though we have done
[17:29] wrong and sinned turn our backs on him
[17:33] done things we ought not to do but he is
[17:35] with us Christ said he would be with
[17:39] us now all God's system is put up by
[17:45] Lords and you talk about the Earth
[17:47] spinning and and how the watch timing
[17:50] and everything else is governed by Lords
[17:54] so even though you could ask for General
[17:59] it cannot go contrary to the laws of
[18:02] God now listen to list if we could only
[18:08] realize that he is here with us the same
[18:11] yesterday today and
[18:13] forever L I'm with you always I'll never
[18:17] leave you never forsake you I'll be with
[18:20] you to the end of the world let me say
[18:25] this we were all born in sin shape
[18:28] iniquity
[18:30] let's put it this way
[18:33] humans a man could be born educated grow
[18:38] up get married get a job have house Car
[18:41] Land get old and die without
[18:46] God live a fairly good life not crooked
[18:50] straight upright without
[18:53] God God is not
[18:55] forcing anyone to serve him
[19:00] he said no man could come except the
[19:02] father draw him so the fact that you in
[19:05] this Virg room tonight it means not a
[19:08] human draw you but God himself is what
[19:12] draw
[19:13] you even if you're backd even if you
[19:16] fail your fell your sin your whatever
[19:19] that may be going on with you right now
[19:23] it doesn't
[19:24] cancel the call of God upon your life
[19:29] because each one of us couldn't pull
[19:31] ourselves
[19:32] up something greater than us and more
[19:36] powerful than us had to influence us to
[19:40] have a desire to Ser him remember he
[19:44] describe our heart a Stony and he asks
[19:47] for exchange if you give me a Stony your
[19:50] Stony heart which is which is a
[19:52] rebellious heart which is a heart that
[19:54] is out of tune with the principles and
[19:56] the things of God I will give you a
[19:58] heart of
[20:00] Flesh he is so gracious that he promises
[20:04] a new
[20:06] spirit and that new spirit is to help us
[20:09] to get along with the holy
[20:10] spirit because with anger temper bad
[20:13] attitude hereditary DNA genetic whatever
[20:18] from the generations
[20:20] P we fighting
[20:22] God because the flesh man fights God so
[20:27] it has to be more than flesh that drives
[20:31] us to even call upon him because we are
[20:34] not serving a god of wood or stone it's
[20:36] an invisible God we can't see with our
[20:39] eyes we can't touch with our hands but
[20:41] we believe and we have seen results of
[20:45] us TR trusting him and having confidence
[20:48] in him are you with me tonight praise
[20:51] the Lord so now he says now I will never
[20:56] leave you nor forsake you
[20:59] how can we be
[21:01] sure by his proven word there we go he
[21:05] is now waiting for you to call him on
[21:08] the scene to be
[21:11] proved so let us go and awake Christ in
[21:14] our lives how do you awake Christ by
[21:18] believing his word and Faith brings him
[21:22] on the scene that is what brings on the
[21:24] scene Fai then call on him to confer his
[21:28] word let that be engrave in your heart
[21:31] tonight call on him to confirm his word
[21:36] his word of being a deliverer his word
[21:38] of being a baptizer his word of being a
[21:40] Healer his word of being a provider his
[21:43] word of being a way maker his word of
[21:46] being a shield a rock whatever his word
[21:49] declares him to be you could call on him
[21:52] tonight to confirm his own word in your
[21:57] life
[21:59] so then call on him here we go to
[22:01] confirm his word and don't doubt in fear
[22:05] don't do that just believe him as it is
[22:09] written let it be done and God will
[22:13] prove to you that Jesus Christ is the
[22:16] same yesterday today and
[22:19] forever now the scripture we
[22:23] read and Jesus and we talk about the
[22:28] laws of God how God have his laws that's
[22:30] why we have the sun doesn't feel led to
[22:33] rise in the North or the sun set it in
[22:37] the in the east no it rise in the east
[22:40] it sets in the
[22:42] west it's God's laws that have the moon
[22:45] a certain place Tides everything is is
[22:48] the law of God so watch
[22:50] this after Jesus taught
[22:54] them to
[22:55] pray Our Father Who was in heaven and so
[22:58] like that this key
[23:01] part thy will be done as in heaven so in
[23:07] Earth and all of this acknowledging
[23:11] where he
[23:12] is his name is Holy his kingdom is
[23:16] coming and the will of God to be
[23:19] done is before a request is made to give
[23:23] us day by day our daily bread not
[23:28] after Daily Bread forgiveness of
[23:32] sins
[23:34] conditional as we also forgive those who
[23:39] trespass against us or indebted to us so
[23:42] our forgiveness or your
[23:44] forgiveness is connected to your ability
[23:49] to forgive those that have
[23:53] trespass or owe you or treat them badly
[23:57] and and the prayer goes on deeper to say
[23:59] lead us not into temptation but Deliver
[24:03] Us from all
[24:06] evil so what that tells you is that the
[24:10] Temptation Arrow will be set up
[24:13] Temptation roads going to be dear but
[24:16] you don't want to be drawn there you
[24:18] want to pray for a breakthrough that you
[24:21] don't go down there because when people
[24:23] go down there it's tough to come out but
[24:26] then he said this and there one that we
[24:28] familiar with I wouldn't go through
[24:30] inail of it which one of you have a
[24:32] friend shall go to him at midnight and
[24:35] say unto him friend let me Tre loaves
[24:37] now remember Parables and Mysteries and
[24:40] stories Jesus Is Telling with hidden
[24:44] hidden stuff inside of it and he says
[24:47] now is a friend you know you're familiar
[24:50] with it you're custom going by that
[24:51] friend and the friend come and said
[24:54] which of you have a friend and shall go
[24:56] onto him at midnight look at the time
[24:58] say friend let me Tre L for a friend of
[25:00] mine in his journey is come to me I have
[25:03] nothing to set before him and he from
[25:06] within shall answer and see trouble be
[25:09] not the door is now shut my children are
[25:13] me in bed I cannot rise and give it me I
[25:15] say unto you though he will not rise and
[25:18] give him because he is his friend yet
[25:22] because of his importunity or
[25:24] persistence he'll rise and give him as
[25:26] many
[25:28] as he needed so here where I want to go
[25:31] tonight when Jesus taught them to pray
[25:34] that wasn't the end of it that was like
[25:37] a template a template is something you
[25:40] could use to express things so what
[25:43] Jesus G was a template but this part
[25:46] here this par is connected to prayer
[25:49] because what he's trying to share with
[25:51] them is that you wouldn't get from that
[25:54] friend because it's a friend what a
[25:56] friend we have in Jesus not friend but
[25:59] you will get because of your persistence
[26:03] or
[26:04] perseverance so right after that as he
[26:07] give this Parable he say I say unto you
[26:10] ask it shall be given you it template
[26:13] again seek and you shall find this is
[26:17] template him knock it shall be open unto
[26:20] you so you could say you have prayed
[26:23] this and God didn't answer you have
[26:25] prayed this and it didn't work out you
[26:27] have prayed this but what you are taking
[26:29] is the template you're not looking at
[26:30] the fine print that enforces this
[26:34] template that God give you that is verse
[26:37] 9 here what verse 10 for everyone that
[26:39] ask receive it or this is not something
[26:43] in addition he's talking about the way
[26:47] you're asking not once but ask it he
[26:51] that seeketh find it keep on seeking
[26:54] until to him that knock it shall be open
[26:57] and brother Isaac last Friday exalted us
[27:01] on Hannah who was being tormented by the
[27:06] next wife and terrorized in church
[27:10] because she couldn't have a child and
[27:13] she was praying in bitterness she was
[27:15] praying maybe with Revenge she was
[27:17] praying that God maybe vindicate and
[27:19] shut him out of the critics and whatever
[27:21] whatever whatever and when her prayer
[27:24] changed and she adjusted her prayer to
[27:28] say God you know what I'm not praying
[27:31] based upon my enemies I'm not praying
[27:34] based upon who's against me who wronged
[27:36] me I'm praying because I love you I want
[27:39] to serve you and I want to bring glory
[27:41] to you so if you would bless me with a
[27:44] son I will give him to
[27:47] you and God blessed her with Samuel a
[27:52] prophet as soon as a pray and she knew
[27:55] she knew when things change
[27:58] because the Bible said she was no more
[28:00] sad year in year out it affected her
[28:04] countenance it affecting her stress
[28:07] level it affecting her all over but as
[28:11] soon as she changed a
[28:15] prayer there was a joy something
[28:18] happened something click and I'm hoping
[28:21] tonight that something click with you
[28:25] tonight forget what you pray in the
[28:28] past ask God to inspire by Revelation
[28:33] and inspiration keys that can unlock the
[28:36] doors because he's not far from you in
[28:40] speaking terms with him he's
[28:43] listening you know it have um the Apple
[28:48] have something called Siri and they have
[28:51] a something called everybody a product
[28:54] where you could talk Amazon have some
[28:55] called Alexa and you could speak and
[28:57] it's listening always listening you
[28:59] could say play a song play this
[29:01] everybody want this automatic and spoken
[29:03] words stuff and like that and sometimes
[29:06] I'm in the car and I say something and
[29:09] Google saying something as if I Ain talk
[29:11] to you but the technology now they're
[29:14] listening they're listening and I want
[29:16] you to see how God is listening he's
[29:19] listening to hear and if we could only
[29:24] see the power of our prayer and how the
[29:26] devil want to bind him out want to make
[29:30] sure you don't get through them because
[29:32] he don't have access like this he have
[29:34] no such access this is for sons and
[29:37] daughters even if we are Fallen Sons and
[29:39] Daughters we still have access rights
[29:42] because we could be restored he's our
[29:45] father he give us a place that we could
[29:48] have an inheritance he give us a place
[29:50] in his kingdom but he wants to
[29:53] communicate with us and relate to us are
[29:55] you get me tonight let me just see if I
[29:56] could finish up here I don't want to
[29:57] stay too long with you okay all right
[30:03] so and then he went on to say if a son
[30:06] ask for a bread would you give him a
[30:08] stone if he being evil know how to give
[30:12] good gifts unto your children how much
[30:14] more shall your heavenly father give the
[30:17] Holy Spirit to them that ask him so this
[30:20] tells us two things here the holy spirit
[30:24] is given one and you have to ask for and
[30:29] he already give you the template for
[30:31] asking seeking and knocking you're not
[30:35] asking once and saying but okay that's
[30:36] it I ask and I it we see going to work
[30:39] out no no no you're asking until they
[30:41] got to have a response okay when you
[30:44] pray Jesus in Luke 24:46 says and when
[30:47] said unto them why sleep he rise and
[30:49] pray least you enter into temptation so
[30:54] prayer would influence or affect what
[30:59] level of Temptation come your way
[31:01] because he said what Jesus
[31:03] says why sleep you rise and pray Le see
[31:07] enter into
[31:08] temptation so a prayerless life is a
[31:10] life looking for trouble looking for
[31:13] Temptation Temptation will come to a
[31:15] prayerless life Matthew 26:41 watch and
[31:18] pray that you enter not into temptation
[31:21] and here he gives a reason the spirit
[31:25] indeed is willing
[31:28] but the flesh is weak that is what he
[31:31] give here Spirit willing flesh weak what
[31:34] do you do
[31:35] pray and you pray you're praying for
[31:38] yourself alone for your family alone
[31:40] this is James 5:116 confess your faults
[31:43] one to another and pray one for another
[31:46] that he may be healed the effectual
[31:49] fervent prayer of a righteous man a at
[31:51] much not prayer effectual fervent prayer
[31:56] you do want to be sa saying words you
[31:58] don't want to saying like you're saying
[31:59] our father and H Mary and you're
[32:00] repeating stuff okay the effect your
[32:04] fervent prayer of a righteous man are at
[32:09] much Mark
[32:12] 13:33 take a heed watch and pray for you
[32:15] know not when the time is this is Jesus
[32:18] words now take heed watch and pray for
[32:23] you know not what when the time is when
[32:26] the time is for your healing when your
[32:28] time is for deliverance when your time
[32:29] for the angel come knocking on your door
[32:31] you don't know so you want to say stay
[32:34] ready and be
[32:36] ready and this one here now familiar one
[32:39] Mark 11 not 23 but 24 therefore I say
[32:44] unto you what things soever you desire
[32:46] When you pray believe that you receive
[32:50] them and you shall have them or believe
[32:52] it is granted to you and you will get it
[32:55] believe you receive it and you you shall
[32:57] have it and here the condition under
[33:00] that when you stand praying forgive so
[33:03] it's almost as if you want God to answer
[33:06] your prayer but then God sends down his
[33:10] thermometer to see if there's any ought
[33:13] or Grudge or anything in the heart so if
[33:18] there's anything even though he wants to
[33:20] answer he can't answer because his law
[33:23] doesn't allow him to answer a prayer
[33:26] from a unforgiving
[33:28] heart how many get that
[33:30] tonight he is hearing you as his child
[33:34] he was hearing you as a son or a
[33:36] daughter but he
[33:38] cannot answer because his law doesn't
[33:42] permit him to receive a prayer somebody
[33:46] somebody say every okay so think about
[33:49] it now prayer requests going up to God a
[33:51] lot of pray everybody praying all over
[33:53] the world prayer and whatnot what do you
[33:56] think will catches attention people
[33:59] praying with bad behavior people praying
[34:01] and they hate this one people praying
[34:03] and they have all kind of issues in
[34:04] their heart those prayers going to a
[34:06] certain side because that can't really
[34:08] connect in the principles and the laws
[34:10] of God but here it is a saint you here
[34:13] you may not be conscious of it but
[34:15] there's something need to be made right
[34:17] there something to get out your system
[34:19] and he's waiting for that that the
[34:21] prayer can reach the level where
[34:23] Heaven's Heaven respond so you don't
[34:26] want to say prayer as you're going
[34:28] through a motion you want to pray that
[34:30] heaven respond like when Daniel begin to
[34:33] pray and and and and Gabriel was
[34:35] fighting and fighting Devils to get a
[34:38] message to Daniel um and he says now if
[34:41] Daniel has stopped praying the angels
[34:43] have coming so he us to pray and his
[34:46] persistence and perseverance is pulling
[34:49] Angelic invisible forces into being on
[34:53] his behalf oh praise God so let's see if
[34:56] we can wrap this up up here now all
[35:00] right when you stand praying so pray
[35:03] that is granted to you you have it all
[35:05] right that's the top level but then now
[35:08] here comes this part but when you pray
[35:10] forgive if you have ought against any
[35:12] that your father which is heaven May
[35:14] forgive your trespasses but if you do
[35:16] not forgive neither will your father
[35:18] which is in heaven forgive your
[35:20] trespasses so come like a pray shut up
[35:23] Heaven is brass to you your blessings is
[35:27] be denied is reserved it is held up
[35:30] until you do your do and adjust your
[35:34] stuff Matthew 6 he was telling them okay
[35:38] not just about when you pray but how not
[35:42] to pray you say not be as the Hypocrites
[35:45] are for they love to pray standing in
[35:48] the synagogues in the corner of the
[35:49] streets the reason the reason that they
[35:52] may be seen of men y they have their
[35:55] reward but when thou prayest like
[35:57] tonight enter into thy closet when thou
[35:59] are shut thy door pray to thy father
[36:03] which SE in secret and the Father which
[36:05] see in secret shall wor you openly that
[36:07] he went down further when you pray use
[36:08] not vain repetitions so he's telling you
[36:11] what to do and what not to do don't be
[36:13] like the Hypocrites looking to be seen
[36:15] don't use V repetitions as the Heen do
[36:17] for they think they shall be heard for
[36:19] their much speak be not therefore like
[36:22] unto them for your father knoweth what
[36:24] things you have need of before you ask
[36:26] him and he said after this manner
[36:28] therefore you pray Our Father which are
[36:30] in heaven and he said the same thing
[36:31] give us this day our daily bread and so
[36:33] like that right then I'll close with
[36:35] this part
[36:37] here moreover when you fast this is
[36:40] fasting not if but when not if you pray
[36:45] but when you pray when you fast be not
[36:47] as the Hypocrites of a sad countenance
[36:50] for they disfigure their face that they
[36:52] may appear unto men to fast they have
[36:55] their reward when those fasting anoint
[36:57] thy head wash your face when th appear
[36:59] unto men not fast but unto thy father
[37:02] that thou appear not unto men fast but
[37:05] unto thy father which is in secret thy
[37:08] father which is in secret shall wor
[37:10] openly
[37:12] okay I have more stuff here but I no
[37:16] time
[37:17] would I'll read one of it deuteron
[37:22] Deuteronomy chapter 6 now these are the
[37:26] Commandments
[37:27] the statutes the judgments your lord
[37:30] your God commanded to teach you that he
[37:33] might do them in the land whether you go
[37:36] to possess it now remember this bunch of
[37:39] people that was Generations Generations
[37:42] 400 years of people grandchildren and
[37:45] and so on coming up they don't know God
[37:49] they just know God was with Abraham and
[37:51] Isaac and so on but they have never met
[37:53] him they never see you so they had to be
[37:55] taught and that's what we in this room
[37:58] here tonight to be taught to pray to be
[38:00] taught how to use the keys to be taught
[38:03] how to please God what pleases God we
[38:05] had to learn because we we wasn't born
[38:08] with the word of God in our mouths and
[38:10] our hearts so he is saying here that God
[38:15] command to teach you that he might do
[38:18] them in the land whether you go to
[38:20] possess it that thou mightest fear the
[38:23] lord thy God to keep all his statutes
[38:25] and his Commandments which I command
[38:27] thee thou and thy son and thy son son
[38:30] all the days of thy life and that that
[38:33] days thy days May prolong hear therefore
[38:36] o Israel and observe to do it that it
[38:39] may dwell with thee and that he may
[38:40] increase mightily as the Lord God of thy
[38:43] fathers had promised thee in the land
[38:45] that thren milk milk and honey here oh
[38:48] Israel the Lord our God is one Lord thou
[38:51] shall love the Lord thy God with all thy
[38:52] heart with all thy soul with all thy
[38:55] might and and these words which I
[38:58] command the this day shall be in thy
[39:00] heart here we go verse seven Thou shalt
[39:04] teach them diligently unto thy children
[39:08] and shall talk of them when thou sest in
[39:11] thy house when thou walkest by the way
[39:15] when thou liest down when thou risest up
[39:18] Thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thy
[39:21] hand they shall be as frontlets between
[39:24] Thine Eyes thou sh write them upon the
[39:27] post of thy house and on thy Gates so
[39:31] could you
[39:32] imagine God trying to drive this at the
[39:36] parental level at Mom and Dad father and
[39:40] mothers and saying Teach this to your
[39:44] children now you cannot teach what you
[39:47] don't know so you have to learn in order
[39:51] to
[39:51] teach verse
[39:53] 11 of okay write it upon the post of thy
[39:57] house on the gates verse 10 it shall be
[40:01] when the Lord thy
[40:02] God shall have brought thee into the
[40:05] land where you swear unto thy fathers to
[40:07] Abraham to Isaac to Jacob to give thee
[40:09] great and goodly cities which thou
[40:10] buildest not and houses full of all good
[40:13] thing which thou fillest not and Wells
[40:16] digs which thou digest not Vineyards and
[40:18] olive trees which thou plest not and
[40:21] thou shall have eaten and be full then
[40:24] beware least thou forg yet the Lord
[40:27] which brought thee forth out of the land
[40:29] of Egypt from the house of bondage Thou
[40:32] shalt fear the lord thy God and serve
[40:34] him and shall sway by his name you shall
[40:36] not go after other gods or the gods of
[40:38] the people that are around about you for
[40:40] the Lord thy God is a jealous God among
[40:42] you Le the anger of the Lord thy God be
[40:45] kindled against thee and destroy the
[40:47] from off the face of the Earth he shall
[40:49] not tempt the Lord your God as he
[40:50] tempted him in Massa he shall diligently
[40:53] keep the Commandments of the Lord your
[40:55] God and His testimonies
[40:56] and the statutes which he commanded the
[40:58] and thou shalt do which is right and
[41:00] good in the sight of the Lord that it
[41:02] may be well with thee that thou may go
[41:04] in and possess the good land which the
[41:07] Lord swear unto thy fathers to cast out
[41:09] all thy enemies from before thee as the
[41:11] Lord had spoken and when thy son ask
[41:14] thee here we go in time to come so all
[41:16] this is prophecy hanging over them they

[41:52] us to do all these statutes to fear God
