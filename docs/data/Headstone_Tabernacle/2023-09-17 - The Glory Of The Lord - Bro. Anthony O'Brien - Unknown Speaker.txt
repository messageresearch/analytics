so much musicians you can uh take your seats and you can turn to your Bibles now we'd like to put no more delay on this morning service amen um so just one portion of scripture want to read from this morning Sydney happy to be here in the house of the Lord second Corinthians chapter 3 we want to read from and um praise God Amen you appreciate the Lord 2 Corinthians chapter 3 I ask the Lord what do I read this morning told me said well this captures everything amen so so we'll read this amen all right Do We Begin Again to commend ourselves or need we as some others Epistles of commendation to you or letters of commendation from you ye are our epistle written in our hearts known and read of all men for as much as he manifestly declared to be the Epistle of Christ ministered by US Written not with ink but with the spirit of the Living God not in tables of stone but in fleshly tables of the heart and such trust have we through Christ to God what not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything of ourselves but our sufficiency is of God who also ha made us able Ministers of the New Testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter kth but the spirit giveth life but if the ministration of death written and engraven in Stones was glorious so that the children of Israel could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance which Glory was to be done away how shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious for if the ministration of condemnation be glory much more do the minist ation of righteousness exceeding Glory which is what we have today amen is that right for even that which was made glorious had no glory in this Respect by reason of the glory that excelth for if that which is done away was glorious then much more that which remaineth is glorious oh so there's a greater glory that's promised to you this morning do you believe it seeing then that we have such hope we use great plainness of speech amen we no longer mysterious but plainly speak to you amen praise God these things and not as Moses which put a veil over his face that the children of Israel could not steadfastly look to the end of that which uh is abolished but their minds were blinded for until this day remaineth the same Veil untaken away in the reading of the Old Testament which Veil is done away in Christ and even unto this day when Moses is read the veil is upon their heart nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord the veil shall be taken away amen he remove all the veils amen now the Lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord may the Lord bless our blessing to to the reading of his word this morning let's bow our heads now and just pray amen before we begin amen Heavenly Father Lord we pause now again just to honor you Lord Jesus we've just read your word father Lord only you could come and anoint your scriptures father and bring it to life any man can read the word any man can read the scripture but it take the spirit to give it life so father pray your spirit would be evident here this morning as we yield to you Lord as we look to you father Lord there's nowhere else that we can go and there is no one else that we can turn to this morning so we look to you father for everything that we have need of you had already provided this morning you are Jehovah Gyra you provide our every need Lord Jesus and Lord you are Jehovah shama you are here with us present with your people making yourself known bless your people this morning as we yield to you Lord take me out of the way use your word in whatever way you choose this morning you know what yeah I prepared here but Lord you come and be the minister this morning Lord so we just give it over to you now we pray bless these few minutes as you wait upon you Lord bless your people pour out your spirit in Jesus name amen and amen glory to God you may have your seats amen praise God amen so God bless you thank you so much amen so you want to appreciate our pastor this morning amen um for his labor and his Inspirations that he has brought for past few weeks in particular how can we say sure surely an entrance has been Minister us abundantly into the Everlasting Kingdom of Our Lord Jesus Christ amen so you want to appreciate with Isaac over and Ministry also and praise God for his labors amen and uh and also brother Gideon even Wednesday um the

soay praise God so we thank God for his blessings praise God and then there the midst of the drought in the midst of the hot sun there's still meal in the barrel there's still oil in the cruise amen pray your well will never run dry because you have made the Lord your God your habitation hey there shall no evil befall you neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling claim that promise this morning and walk in the light amen praise God so God bless you amen praise God so I have a title this morning my title is the glory of the Lord amen that's my title this morning the glory of the Lord and I have a theme the manifestation of the word made flesh produces a shakina of Glory in the end time from the glory of Jacob grace to the glory of Joseph Perfection amen amen that's that's my theme amen it was too long to put on the slides so I said I'll just say it amen praise God but God bless you amen so that's that's what I have this morning amen want to talk about the glory of the Lord isn't that right so we're here to give him glory this morning we're here to give him praise this morning all the praise that is due unto your name unto his name so we're here to just let loose this morning and forget about yourself forget about who's next to you forget about who's in front of you this morning you just ride the word and I believe there's already an atmosphere here that can minister to you more than I can do in this morning amen he's going to do the ministry I'm just here to yield myself we're just here to yield ourselves to the moving of his will isn't that right but what is Glory let's get started what is Glory Glory is anything that gives honor and praise unto God isn't that right you give him glory with your Praises with your worship with your uh adoration you give him glory oh he is not God to you until you worship Him and when you worship him then he gets the glory pray out your praise when you are willing to bow down and surrender yourself to the will of his to the will of the master then he becomes God to you then he is glorified when you praise him this morning when you praise it should be a fire in your heart hands are praise when you praise oh for our God is a consuming fire oh no flesh shall glory in his presence we're here to give him glory this morning oh oh hle the devil doesn't want to give him glory he wants glory for himself but we say none for Satan this morning none for Lucifer none for his Devils we kicked him out of heaven and we'll kick him out down here no glory for the devil oh we have no mercy no mercy on the forces of darkness no mercy on the armies of evil no mercy on the powers of heav of hell oh we have no mercy this morning for greater is he that is in us that he that is in the world oh pull your sword out this morning and fight a good fight of faith I'm here to give God glory I'm here to fight with my Praises I'm here to fight with my worship you want to know how to fight lift your hands up close your eyes and begin to give God glory Mark your territory this morning oh Hallelujah let the devil know he can't cross that line wo somebody say Amen somebody say Amen oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh we going to have a church on fire or no church at all but I'm here to get on fire on fire for Jesus Oh hallelujah hallelujah I'm not too young to praise God oh hallelujah oh hallelujah amen what is Glory Glory is also a Divine atmosphere God's atmosphere isn't that right the glory that surrounds him Jesus which is Christ isn't that all right amen hallelujah glory of God uh uh is and the glory of God watch is above any other glory is the highest Glory there's a glory of Kingdoms there's a glory of men there's a glory of achievements there's a glory of successes but there's no other Glory that can compare with the glory of God when the glory of God drops down all of the glories fade away oh come on now oh heaven and Earth will pass away but my word shall never pass away when the king comes with his glory there's no other Glory can stand in the presence of that Glory no flesh shall glory in God's presence nothing you've done nothing you could ever achieve will ever match will ever be close to the glory of God oh I'm here to give him glory this morning I'm here to give him praise this morning because when everything pass is away the only thing that will stand is the thing that cannot be shaken is the thing that will remain the kingdom of God is coming upon the earth once more this world will hear from God direct from God oh the Earth will shake oh the mountains will rent oh Hallelujah the sons of God will be on the earth speaking the word flashing like lightning oh Hallelujah Hallelujah the devil is in trouble brother oh hallelujah hallelujah this

Dynamics is coming revival is coming oh Hallelujah let's get on fire let's shine our shoes let's polish our Spears let's strengthen the feeble knees let's dig up the fow ground let's get to praying let's get to fighting we have something to fight for oh hallelujah hallelujah we shall see God's glory we shall see him face to face Hallelujah you believe it this morning amen oh my so so in the Hebrew shakina or shakina means the dwelling or cause to dwell that's what in the Hebrew amen isn't that right Shak of Glory isn't that right in Jewish teachings it usually means he dwell or he rested upon amen and those that favored it it also means God's holiness amen the shakina of Glory isn't that right Deuteronomy 23:14 for the Lord thy God walth in the midst of thy camp to deliver thee he says and to give up thine enemies before thee therefore shall they thy Camp be holy that she shall see no unclean thing in thee and turn away from thee so you got to make your Camp holy this morning you've got a responsibility to pray oh to cleanse yourself in the blood of the Lamb Hallelujah isn't that right to make yourself holy when you come before God so that his glory can be seen upon you his glory can come he can feel free to come and dwell to come and inhabit the Lord inhabits the Praises of his people oh H so there's got to be a condition there for Holiness to dwell for his presence to dwell for his glory to dwell that's how we come to church this morning to find out how we can get into condition how we can get into a situation where we can please God with the lives that we are living with all with prayer and with our signification and the things that we can do to get ready for his abiding Glory oh for his sh kind of Glory oh the glory that dwells the glory that rests oh

came off the scripture here all right they brought a sacrifice sacrifices upon sacrifices the Bible couldn't put a number so they put multitude my so now what she said and the priest brought the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord unto his place I like that the ark came into its place to the Oracle of the house into the most holy place even under the wings of the cherubims everything was done according to instruction hey according to Moses isn't that right my my my and the priest brought in the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord into his place right okay so for the chuban spread forth their wings over the place of the Ark and the cherubin cover the ark and the staffs thereof above and they drew out the staffs of the Ark and at the ends of the stares were seen from the ark before the Oracle but they were not seen without and there it is unto this day and he said that there was nothing in the ark save the two tables which Moses put therein at Horeb and when the Lord made a covenant with the children of Israel when they came out of Egypt and it came to pass that when the priests will come out of the Holy place for all the priests that were present were Sanctified oh they were what they were Sanctified oh they were prep prepared for service and he said he did not wait and did not then wait by course and also the Levites which were the singers all of them of ASF and of hemon uh of of jedian with their sons and their Brethren being arrayed in white linen having symbols and suies and hops stood at the East End Of The Altar and with them and 100 120 priests sounding with trumpets and it came to pass the Bible says it it came even to pass as the trumpets and singers were as one to make one sound oh doesn't that sound familiar One Voice one Accord with one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the Lord oh worship it precedes the Holy Ghost oh the Lord and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and the symbols and instruments of music and praise the Lord saying for he is good for his Mercy endure it forever that then was the house filled with a cloud even the house of the Lord so that the priest could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud for the glory of the Lord had filled the house oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh they were in one mind they would one Accord they were praising his name and then all of a sudden Town come a Cloud oh from Heaven not from the side somewhere but an anointing from above the weight of his glory dropped into the building oh I wonder this morning if we could get into such a condition where God would be pleased to come down in his house and fill the whole house oh hallelujah hallelujah he promise to do the same thing if you meet the same conditions oh isn't that right hallelujah oh my my my imagine such an atmosphere where the priest can't even stand to minister oh Hallelujah the preacher can't even stand to preach where the singer can't even stand to sing but the glory fills the house what happened God take control God begin his reign in that territory in that atmosphere there's no devil can stand in that atmosphere no demon can stand in that atmosphere when God takes over the service oh I'm longing for a church service when the pillar of cloud when the pillar of fire could take over the sanctuary when the minister was stand to minister but the glory of God will begin to heal the sick you begin to raise the dead you begin to create missing limbs missing organs we get to sprout in the presence of God oh my my my my that's a kind of service we are coming on to with the glory of God oh could it be today oh hallelujah oh I'm expecting it today oh my my so the prophet said on dedication 1962 he said but did you notice after the building was completed he said it was still an empty building now he said there was nothing in it but Furniture so Solomon had done all he could do put the furniture in his place everything in his place right build it exactly the way it's supposed to be built he's done all that he could do and when you've done all that you could do that you're supposed to do when you've met your end that's when God starts that's when God takes over that's when God steps in and said you've done all you could do now let me show you what I can do oh hallelujah hallelujah oh when you've come to your end brother when you come to the end of your road when you've come to what pretty Gideon talk about your last cry when you come to your last cry and you CED all you could cry and you prayed all that you could pray and you screamed all you could scream at the altar that's when God takes over and shows you oh what he can do oh he could part the spirit he could power the Holy Ghost he can heal the sick he could deliver your son he can deliver your daughter he can deliver your husband yes yes he can deliver your wife he can do anything as long as you're willing to lay it all upon the altar is your all on the altar this morning somebody answer me praise God hallelujah hallelujah cast your bread upon the Water laid upon him this morning oh my so there was nothing in it but Furniture right an empty house after a man done all he could do he still end up with an empty house because because it takes God to fill it isn't that right to make it complete oh Hallelujah so they were going to dedicate this building for worshippers to worship something something Prophet said now without Something There To Worship the building would have been in vain but the building was now ready for dedication and when the Levites and the priests

through the rings on the AR where the tables of stone was on the inside two tables of stone same Stone these two are one same commandment right same Covenant when these two tables of stone with the cherubims and their wings pitch across one another when these Levites only that consecrated group could be out the prophet said no man could touch it outside of them he did if he did he died huh the
