[11:57] in Cameroon we're looking forward for
[11:59] tremendous time and the Lord pray for
[12:01] those meetings there those Believers of
[12:04] like Precious Faith so I want to turn
[12:07] your Bibles to 2 Peter 1 just one
[12:09] scripture 2 Peter 1 we want to read from
[12:12] verse 1 to
[12:21] 11 Simon Peter a servant and Apostle of
[12:24] Jesus Christ to them that have attained
[12:26] like Precious Faith with us through the
[12:29] righteousness of God and our Savior
[12:31] Jesus Christ Grace and peace be
[12:33] multiplied unto you through the
[12:35] knowledge of God and of Jesus our lord
[12:39] according as his divine power had given
[12:41] unto us all things that pertain unto
[12:44] life and godliness through the knowledge
[12:47] of him that had called us to glory and
[12:51] virtue whereby are given unto us
[12:54] exceeding great and precious promises
[12:58] that by these
[12:59] you might be partakers of the divine
[13:01] nature having escaped the corruption
[13:04] that is in this world through lust and
[13:07] besides this giv all diligence out to
[13:09] your faith virtue and to Virtue
[13:11] knowledge and to knowledge Temperance to
[13:13] Temperance patience to patience
[13:14] godliness to God in his brotherly
[13:16] kindness and to brotherly kindness
[13:18] charity for if these things be you and a
[13:20] bound that they make that you shall
[13:23] neither be Barren nor un fruitful in the
[13:25] knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but
[13:27] he that lacked these things is is blind
[13:30] cannot see a far off and had forgotten
[13:33] that he was purged from his old sins
[13:36] wherefore the rather Brethren give
[13:38] diligence to make your calling and
[13:39] election sure for if you do these things
[13:42] you shall never fall for so an entrance
[13:46] shall be ministered unto you abundantly

[21:39] flesh of his flesh bone of his bone
[21:42] Spirit of his Spirit could somebody say

[21:50] Seed of Abraham are they all children
[21:54] but in Isaac shall thy seed be called
[21:58] that is which are of the children of the
[22:00] flesh these are not the children of God
[22:05] but the children of Promise accounted
[22:08] for
[22:09] seedall oh you heard that the children
[22:12] of promise and Peter said by these
[22:16] promises we become partakers of the
[22:19] divine nature having escaped the
[22:22] corruption that is in this world through
[22:24] lust so there going to be a bunch of
[22:27] people that they can't wait to hear
[22:29] promises they say give it to me preacher
[22:33] speak it to me preacher don't speak your
[22:35] dreams don't speak your thoughts and

[22:41] because by these
[22:44] promises is there a shout in the house
[22:48] you could be dead but Jesus said I am
[22:50] the resurrection and the life by these
[22:54] promises is there a shout in the house
[22:58] you can be sick but by his stripes I am
[23:01] healed by these promises you could be
[23:05] bed this morning but he came to set the
[23:08] captive free he came to open up the

[23:17] [Applause]
[23:22] promises
[23:23] Glory
[23:26] Glory you may be seated
[23:29] so you can understand now why Jesus
[23:32] could go to Peter and say come amen
[23:34] follow me that's right
[23:37] amen and I'll make you fishes of men and
[23:40] Peter couldn't you help him so he just
[23:42] drop his Nets and keep you can
[23:44] understand why now because you have not
[23:45] chosen me I have chosen you and all that
[23:50] the father had given me past T have
[23:54] given me will
[23:57] come will
[23:59] come at the appointed time you got to
[24:01] come the Devil Couldn't keep you back in
[24:03] that bar that adultery couldn't stop it
[24:06] couldn't continue you couldn't continue
[24:08] fornicating you couldn't continue
[24:10] drinking all that the father had given
[24:14] me will
[24:17] come Hallelujah
[24:22] Glory so you are not a mistake you are
[24:26] not an accident you are not even here by
[24:29] accident this morning so we know that
[24:32] all things work together for good to
[24:36] them that love the Lord to them who are
[24:40] de called according to his purpose so
[24:44] you got to make your calling and your
[24:48] election sure when you do that no devil
[24:53] could move you that's why David said
[24:56] don't 10,000 fall my right hand I shall
[25:00] not be
[25:02] moved because David knew if I make my
[25:05] bed in hell he is there he knew who he
[25:09] was he knew who his father was no devil
[25:13] could tell him oh that's why David said
[25:17] restore unto me the joy of my salvation
[25:22] he knew he was saved but he lost the joy
[25:26] oh give the Lord a shout of praise
[25:28] might be going to preach you out to hell

[26:55] they say you're old that has nothing to
[26:57] do with it who told you said God and if

[34:59] dog you try you try that now and see you
[35:02] cannot try that don't think about it but
[35:05] Adam could handle that because he was
[35:07] authorized because God said man have
[35:10] power have dominion
[35:12] over so man was Fearless you say little
[35:15] child what a child afraid of
[35:18] nothing you ever noticed that child

[35:42] have people to meet you have things to
[35:45] see so that death and that hook you
[35:48] coming with take it
[35:50] back take it back Jesus one time said my
[35:54] hour is not yet come because I have
[35:56] places to go

[36:30] conceived by one even our father here we
[36:33] go for the children being not yet
[36:35] born neither have done any good or evil
[36:40] that the purpose of God according to
[36:43] election might stand not of works but of
[36:47] him that call it it was said unto her
[36:50] the Elder Shall Serve the younger for it
[36:52] is written Jacob have I love and Esau
[36:55] have I hated amen oh Hallelujah ujah
[36:58] what shall we said then is there
[37:00] unrighteousness with God God forbid for
[37:02] he said to Moses I will have mercy and
[37:04] whom I will have mercy I will have
[37:06] compassion on whom I will have
[37:07] compassion so then it is not him that
[37:10] willth or him that run but God that
[37:15] showeth Mercy For What the scripture
[37:18] sayith unto Pharaoh even for this same
[37:21] purpose I have raised thee up that I
[37:23] might show my power in thee that my name
[37:26] might declare
[37:28] all the Earth so Pharaoh didn't raise
[37:30] himself up God raised up pharaoh to be
[37:33] pharaoh to bring him down to show his
[37:36] power and His glory so we serve a mighty
[37:40] God he raised up Kings he put down Kings
[37:43] he raise up kingdoms he thr on Kingdom
[37:46] but I see a stone cut out without the
[37:49] hands of man coming to strike the image
[37:52] Oh Glory to God a kingdom is about to be
[37:55] established a rocking is about to take
[37:58] place everything that can be shaken will
[38:01] be shaken could we give the Lord some
[38:03] Praises hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[38:06] had not the power the pot of power over
[38:09] the clay or the of the same lump to make
[38:12] one vessel unto honor and another unto
[38:14] dishonor Oh Praise name even to us whom
[38:17] he had called not the Jews also the
[38:19] Gentiles he also said in O I will call
[38:22] them my people which were not my people
[38:25] and her beloved which was not beloved it
[38:27] shall come to pass that in the place
[38:29] where it was said unto them you're not
[38:31] my people there shall they be called the
[38:33] children of God Isaiah CRI concerning
[38:37] Israel doubt though the number of the
[38:39] children of Israel be at the S of the
[38:41] sea a Remnant shall be saved and we know
[38:43] that Remnant is 144,000 isn't that right
[38:46] and he will listen and he will finish
[38:49] the work and cut it short in
[38:50] righteousness because a short work will
[38:53] the Lord make upon the earth oh blessed
[38:56] be the name of of the Lord amen so God
[38:59] have elected people on the Earth do you
[39:01] believe that and that elected people
[39:03] going to come into knowledge of who she
[39:04] is hallelujah what they call to do what
[39:07] they call on to and nobody that why
[39:09] Jesus said nobody could take your joy my
[39:11] joy I give nobody going to take that Joy
[39:13] from you isn't that right oh blessed be
[39:15] the name of the Lord okay
[39:19] [Music]
[39:21] wowl Hallelujah
[39:31] Hall are you
[39:33] ready that was the curtain wonderful you
[39:36] know about to get
[39:38] inside Martin Luther had mechanics and
[39:40] Dynamics in his day John Wesley had them
[39:43] in his day Pentecost what about our day
[39:47] this is another time the church should
[39:49] be fully grown now ready to meet Christ
[39:52] with the manifestation of Every Blessing
[39:54] he promised in the Bible operating in
[39:56] that great body
[39:57] amen where he promised he would meet the
[39:59] people and be
[40:01] woried amen so then when the Dynamics
[40:04] fell on the elected Lutheran Church It
[40:08] produced a manifestation of
[40:11] justification could they hear am on that
[40:14] when the Dynamics fell on wesan it
[40:16] produced a manifestation of
[40:18] sanctification when the Dynamics fell on
[40:21] Pentecostals because each age had
[40:23] mechanics and dnam and Dynamics but when
[40:26] the Dynamics fell the Pentecostal it
[40:28] produce the gifts with signs and wonders
[40:31] here we go but not the life which goes
[40:35] onto adoption and Perfection because the
[40:38] life come by the word am and the word
[40:41] comes to a prophet yes and the
[40:43] Pentecostal rejected the
[40:46] prophet so they are stuck with the money
[40:49] gospel with signs and one of the
[40:50] Miracles but they couldn't go on with
[40:52] the life so that is why God sent a
[40:55] prophet to bring the word because in the
[40:57] beginning was the word the word was with
[40:59] God and the Word was God in him was life
[41:03] and the life was the light of men so if
[41:05] you want life you have to get the
[41:10] word but because we come to the church
[41:12] ages all people know is
[41:16] church so it's a battle to get people
[41:18] out of church thinking into word
[41:21] thinking that's the battle Hallelujah
[41:25] that you are not a church member you are
[41:27] moving into bright
[41:29] material you have a choice to stay here
[41:33] move through easy and hit the
[41:35] tribulation
[41:37] amen hallelujah because church members
[41:40] just have to sa through know they just
[41:42] have to make an
[41:43] appearance but the bride she
[41:47] fights the Bible call her the
[41:50] elected Jesus gave a parable about the
[41:52] unjust judge and a woman harassing that
[41:55] judge he said shall not go avenge his
[41:58] elect who cry day and night yet she's
[42:04] elected she know she's elected she make
[42:07] a call election show and because she is
[42:10] elected she don't sit down and said I'm
[42:12] elected no she cries she sigh she grows
[42:18] she press because that's the word
[42:30] Hallelujah
[42:35] H you does only go for water when you're
[42:39] thirsty Jesus said the water I will give
[42:41] you you will never TST again this water
[42:45] this natural water this temporary water
[42:48] you have to come back for it but the one
[42:50] I have you to come back for that you're
[42:53] going to be
[42:54] sealed until your day of redemption out
[42:57] of your belly shall float rivers of
[43:00] Living Water there's a power friends
[43:02] there's a power coming Hallelujah there
[43:04] is power that is here right now glory to
[43:08] [Applause]
[43:10] God the Dynamics is here right now this
[43:15] morning the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost
[43:17] is here in the form of the spirit of
[43:21] Prophecy because the Bible said thou
[43:24] must prophesy again there's a prophecy
[43:28] that we will
[43:29] prophesy again which will be the same
[43:33] prophecy that the prophet brought will
[43:36] be recycled going to be re-echoed to
[43:39] give the world one more time to
[43:41] criticize and laugh that God could judge
[43:45] [Applause]
[43:48] them oh Hallelujah so you really
[43:52] think God will let the world go Spear
[43:56] and get away
[43:57] you really think God going raise up sod
[43:59] Andor and apologize to them you think
[44:02] God will take on what the governments
[44:03] want to do with all these gay rights and
[44:05] stuff and apologize no no no no no that
[44:08] same God every country Every Nation
[44:11] every Kingdom where Greek and Romans
[44:14] wherever it is they fell because of
[44:15] internal stuff and when we rotten and
[44:18] bad and perverted and God judged them
[44:20] for that the Bible said the the cup of
[44:22] the iniquity of the amorites is not
[44:24] filled up yet once it's filled God ready
[44:26] to pour the Wrath and judgment America's
[44:28] already finished it's waiting for the
[44:30] Judgment of God to be loosed a but
[44:32] before that happen a ceiling must go
[44:33] forth a bride must know who she is a
[44:36] pride must be sealed into the kingdom of
[44:38] God and a seal shows on both sides you
[44:41] are seal on the inside seal on the
[44:43] outside devil can't do you no
[44:46] h come on say Amen somebody glory to God
[44:50] hallu you understand what I'm saying I
[44:52] am preaching mother the people that
[44:54] going to be bulletproof right
[44:58] Death
[45:00] Proof bomb proof hell
[45:03] proof you not hearing
[45:07] me
[45:09] Glory they the first time the Grim re
[45:12] Reaper meet his match to the extent of a
[45:14] bunch of people on the
[45:16] Earth because Jesus died you
[45:20] know but this bride will not see death
[45:29] man praise God people not getting
[45:32] excited oh glory to God now getting
[45:34] excited we are not from here you know
[45:37] sit down a minute hallelu oh yeah we not
[45:40] from here you know Hall you thought we
[45:42] from here hallelujah we are not just the
[45:44] dust man is from here but where we come
[45:46] from we going back to where we come from

[45:51] where we come from Jus I come from God
[45:53] and going back to God oh God we come
[45:55] from fire we going back to fire devil
[45:58] don't know who we are the devil don't
[45:59] know who we are because he only came in
[46:02] the beginning but we were before the
[46:04] beginning are you hearing me are you
[46:07] hearing me this morning the devil only
[46:10] came in the beginning so all he could
[46:12] know it's in the beginning but we were
[46:15] before the
[46:17] beginning glory to God glory to God Amen
[46:22] so election looks back to for knowledge
[46:27] and predestination look back to look
[46:29] down to Destiny so when you're talking
[46:31] about election you have to go back in
[46:33] the full knowledge of God that's why you
[46:35] have to be in his thinking you have to
[46:37] be in his thoughts because when you
[46:39] express his word you were part of that
[46:42] expression that's why when the word is
[46:44] preached to you something
[46:46] [Applause]
[46:52] connect you know like have a wireless
[46:54] computer wireless instrument and whatnot
[46:56] and when you go and there's a wireless
[46:58] signal you could connect sometime you're
[47:00] not connecting right well God put a
[47:02] building thing inside of you a
[47:05] signal a gene a germ so when the word is
[47:08] preached something had to do so w whoa
[47:10] whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa so
[47:12] you might be among chickens but when you
[47:13] whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa is the mother

[47:27] fly but them chickens are flying I
[47:29] feeling to fly come on say Amen somebody
[47:33] I'm feeling to break out I feeling the
[47:36] shout where was down when I lay the
[47:38] foundation of the earth and the mon sang
[47:41] together and the sons of God shout it
[47:43] for Joy man I feel the
[47:47] shout but I ain't delivered yet still
[47:51] shout come on now Hallelujah
[47:58] on Thursday night we said something
[48:00] about David I could bring that back to
[48:03] youall Saul messing up God tell Samuel
[48:07] forget about sa now I enough for he
[48:11] mourn him he have no anointing upon he
[48:14] just there in
[48:19] position he just did killing time forget
[48:23] that I'm a king
[48:30] I a king go to Jess
[48:35] house oh blessed be the name of the Lord
[48:39] devil want to fight but we'll fight
[48:41] right
[48:43] back praise God praise God they want to
[48:47] fight but we will fight right back why
[48:50] because the devil don't want you to hear
[48:51] this part when Samuel went with the
[48:54] Horner oil to look for one of the sons
[48:57] that God said to anoint he never tell
[48:59] him who it was when the first one come
[49:02] Samuel said surely this is he thought he
[49:04] had easy job that day first man d man
[49:07] God said no I don't operate like that I
[49:11] don't look what man does look at I don't
[49:13] see jacket and tie on the external I
[49:16] look on the inside inside so I want you
[49:18] to understand from here on out stop
[49:20] looking at outside stop looking at
[49:22] complexion High color hair skin tone
[49:24] forget all all that praise God look look
[49:27] look beyond that so Samuel now will
[49:30] yield himself to the spirit and tell his
[49:32] sons pass by and only pass him by you a
[49:34] feeling not no witness you have to have
[49:36] a witness of the spirit this is a spirit
[49:38] business Spirit business man passing

[49:50] ain't get no sign they said we have one
[49:54] more he ain't got chance to B yet
[49:57] he still smelly like the Sheep little
[50:00] fell named David now watch this here's

[50:09] him you don't have to be ready but you
[50:13] have to
[50:14] make your
[50:16] calling an election make it sure so when
[50:21] David come God said this is he
[50:27] oh give the Lord some Praises
[50:29] [Music]
[50:31] people praise the Lord amen blessed be
[50:34] the name of the Lord are you with me so
[50:37] God didn't wait for David to say when D
[50:39] become a old man and he and he get some
[50:41] beard get big chest and tall and
[50:43] different things go understand that go
[50:45] said that is my king there pour the oil

[51:25] opening to get into the palace to see
[51:28] where you will walk where you will sit
[51:31] where you will talk it take a musician

[51:39] same hour same day upon Saul as as as
[51:43] the spirit anoint David the devil

[53:31] heard out there beloved pastor but
[53:32] Neville make a remark I just can't
[53:34] forget it I quoted a friend and after
[53:37] taken watch after the taken away of the
[53:39] Holy Spirit out of the
[53:41] earth that formal Church religion will
[53:43] go right on not knowing the
[53:47] difference do you have you heard that
[53:51] wasn't that astounding they don't know
[53:55] the Holy Spirit amen so they won't know
[53:58] when it is gone true they will just be
[54:01] going right on just the same when here
[54:05] we go the last one is sealed into the
[54:09] body of Christ they will still be going
[54:12] on trying to bring converts to it
[54:15] because they don't know what it is their
[54:18] former religions will continue on just
[54:20] like they were now it may not sink into
[54:22] you like it did to me but that was an
[54:25] astounding statement that will be so far
[54:27] away just religious rituals until they
[54:30] will not miss the holy spirit because
[54:34] they don't know what it is to begin with
[54:37] amen oh Hallelujah that spirit that
[54:40] brings conviction that spirit that
[54:42] convict you when you're wrong and make
[54:43] you feel bad that's you don't want to
[54:45] lose that you really don't want to lose
[54:48] that you don't want where the spirit
[54:49] speaking you don't even know the spirit
[54:51] speaking you want to be under the
[54:52] conviction of the Holy Ghost you want to
[54:54] know that God could tell you make this
[54:56] tell somebody forgive me I'm wrong I'm
[54:58] sorry you want to know that is still
[55:00] working with you praise God David did
[55:02] things David was wrong but David went
[55:04] and repent before God and ask God to
[55:06] restore the joy of Salvation ask God for
[55:08] breakthrough and whatnot when David said
[55:10] oh God I in trouble and know they run my
[55:13] enemies around me would seek the Lord
[55:14] and God will bless him you could do the
[55:16] same also could we give Lord some
[55:18] Praises people amen God have mercy on us
[55:22] brother I'd like to live this life is my
[55:24] desire till I if even the late least bit
[55:27] of his grieving I'll know it in my heart
[55:29] this is butam if I should do something
[55:31] that would grieve him I'll be able to
[55:33] feel it in a moment let alone his
[55:35] absence I don't want to be here when
[55:37] he's not here I want to be gone then
[55:40] there'll be no blood on the mercy seat
[55:41] it'll be dark Smoky and black the
[55:44] sanctuary will have no lawyer there to
[55:45] plead your case you know the scripture
[55:47] said the sanctuary is Smoky there's no
[55:49] blood on The Mercy Seat oh praise God
[55:52] there are so many entertaining things
[55:53] how day so much things to entice the
[55:55] people called pleasures the enticement
[55:57] for young people the modern dance rock
[55:59] and roll and I don't care how good a
[56:01] home a child has been brought up in how
[56:03] it has been taught to do right if that
[56:05] child listen hasn't accepted the
[56:07] experience of the new birth rock and
[56:09] roll music catches his attention just as
[56:10] quick as he hears it because in him is
[56:13] born in him by Nature a carnal Spirit
[56:17] and the power of the devil is so great
[56:19] today till it catches that Spirit of
[56:21] that little one amen how much more will
[56:23] it do to the old that rejected the New
[56:26] Birth because only here we go are you
[56:28] listening only as your life is changed
[56:34] and you have been converted and born a
[56:35] new into the kingdom of God your nature
[56:38] will still be of the things of the world

[56:45] till they could sweep the street with
[56:46] the dress Don't Wear No Makeup Don't
[56:48] Wear No earring and whatnot and whatever
[56:50] it is and clean face and whatnot unless
[56:52] they are born again unless their life is
[56:55] changed
[56:56] the world will always be an attraction
[56:59] because of your carnal nature and spirit
[57:01] isn't that right now watch this here now
[57:04] watch no matter how religious you are
[57:08] unless that has been changed in you you
[57:12] could worship and be religious and still
[57:15] that will be some kind of joint power to
[57:16] you because the old man of sin and his
[57:19] desires is not dead yet oh Hallelujah so

[1:10:54] depth
[1:10:56] of why when the disciples came to Jesus
[1:10:59] excited about the devil's subject unto
[1:11:01] them because of anointing plac on them
[1:11:05] not because they had character because
[1:11:07] they was given temporary power that got
[1:11:09] them so excited about demons running

[1:11:49] survive fire Daniel surviv Lions then
[1:11:52] they can't touch it the devil Can't

[1:12:14] flying colors it's not behind you you
[1:12:18] pass through Hell and Hell can hold you
[1:12:21] you don't belong to hell you're walking
[1:12:23] hell is on the earth and you're walking
[1:12:25] to hell but hell Can't Hold
[1:12:28] You Hell couldn't hold Jesus when try to
[1:12:31] hold him hell had to give up they
[1:12:34] couldn't hold his character Jesus took
[1:12:36] our sins and CH and the devil and Hell
[1:12:38] couldn't hold him so he rose from the
[1:12:41] grave triumphant to bring that
[1:12:44] triumphant Spirit back upon his church
[1:12:47] back upon his people and he said because
[1:12:49] I live you shall live also could we give
[1:12:53] the Lord some worship this morning could
[1:12:55] we give the Lord some Praises this
[1:12:56] morning oh hallelujah hallelujah are you
[1:13:00] with me this morning oh glory to God
[1:13:04] Amen God's love elective love the proof
[1:13:08] of his love is election that no matter
[1:13:10] what happened his love was proven truly
[1:13:14] by the fact that they were chosen unto
[1:13:16] salvation because God had chosen you
[1:13:19] through salvation through the santifico
[1:13:23] [Music]
[1:13:25] here we go take this soberly now he may
[1:13:28] commit you to death as he did Paul he
[1:13:31] may commit you to suffer as he did job
[1:13:33] that is his prerogative he is Sovereign
[1:13:37] it is all with a purpose and if you did
[1:13:39] not have a purpose then he will be the
[1:13:41] auor of frustration and not of Peace so
[1:13:46] God is not trying to frustrate you you
[1:13:49] are frustrated because you are in
[1:13:51] conflict with the will of God for your
[1:13:53] life
[1:13:55] [Music]
[1:13:56] [Applause]
[1:14:01] I will see it
[1:14:04] again because you are in conflict with
[1:14:08] God's will in your life you are fed up
[1:14:12] stressed out and frustrated and the
[1:14:14] holidays doesn't
[1:14:16] matter doesn't make a difference because
[1:14:19] you're wasting your money wasting your
[1:14:21] time you're wasting your trip because
[1:14:23] the battle is still here even though
[1:14:25] you're on holidays so you're not really
[1:14:27] taking a holiday anyhow if you only come
[1:14:29] to church and get it correct you would
[1:14:31] be rejoicing right where you are and
[1:14:34] when you take the holidays it'll be a
[1:14:35] real
[1:14:36] holiday oh Hallelujah it'll be a
[1:14:38] Thanksgiving holiday thanking God for
[1:14:41] delivering you from them crazy thing in
[1:14:43] your head and your mind because the
[1:14:45] devil job is to rough you up slap you up
[1:14:47] tap you up mess you up tie you up grung
[1:14:50] you up that's the Devil he's a net
[1:14:51] snarer you like to snare Nets when you
[1:14:53] fall it you say catch it
[1:14:56] him but greater is
[1:14:59] he greater is he right now in you and he
[1:15:04] in the world amen glory so watch his
[1:15:08] purpose are we ready his purpose is
[1:15:11] after we have suffered a while we should
[1:15:13] be made perfect be established and
[1:15:16] strengthened and settled as job said he
[1:15:19] put strength in US you see here we go he
[1:15:23] himself suffered yes he learned
[1:15:26] obedience by the things that he suffered
[1:15:29] he was actually made perfect by the
[1:15:32] things that he suffered Hebrews 58 and9
[1:15:34] though he was son yet learn he obedience
[1:15:37] by the things which he suffered hallu
[1:15:40] and being made perfect he became the
[1:15:42] author of Eternal salvation to them that
[1:15:45] obey him then Paul said I reckon that
[1:15:48] the sufferings of this present time are
[1:15:49] not worthy to be compared with the glory
[1:15:51] which are be reveal in US unless we
[1:15:53] suffer with him we cannot reign with him
[1:15:57] amen you have to suffer to Reign the
[1:16:01] reason for this is that character there
[1:16:03] we go remember talking about character
[1:16:07] patience trials character development
[1:16:09] but listen to this one again because
[1:16:12] character simply is never made
[1:16:17] without
[1:16:19] suffering we have eight amens there
[1:16:22] that's okay it's still the word is still
[1:16:25] the truth character
[1:16:28] can't simply is never made without
[1:16:31] suffering character is a victory not a
[1:16:34] gift a man without character can't re
[1:16:37] because power apart from character is
[1:16:39] satanic but Power with character is fit
[1:16:42] to rule so you can understand now why
[1:16:44] the Pentecostals run out with the gifts
[1:16:47] and so forth the Pentecostals run with
[1:16:49] the gifts with signs and ons and
[1:16:50] miracles with character am that's why
[1:16:53] they fail they have big churches 20,000
[1:16:55] 30,000 whatever it is but they fail
[1:16:57] because they didn't take the word that
[1:16:59] will bring them into this position into
[1:17:01] the place of trying bring them into a
[1:17:03] position where you even though your son
[1:17:06] have to make a call in an election show
[1:17:10] Peter knew about failure because he know
[1:17:11] he failed amen he fell but he know if
[1:17:14] you're at this life you don't have to
[1:17:16] fall if you make connection sure wait a
[1:17:19] minute I'm a son also I'm a worshipper
[1:17:22] so you can't come here and not worship
[1:17:24] because that's what the devil want
[1:17:25] there's two things God want from you a
[1:17:27] Sanctified life and
[1:17:32] worship if you're in sin you can't
[1:17:34] worship as you ought to worship but you
[1:17:35] live a Sanctified like you don't even
[1:17:37] have to have the Holy Ghost just be
[1:17:38] Sanctified just come clean and Worship
[1:17:41] the Lord that's all Worship the Lord
[1:17:44] when you worship you create an
[1:17:47] atmosphere hallelujah hallelujah you
[1:17:50] heard what I said when you worship you
[1:17:52] create the atmosphere you determine the
[1:17:55] atmosphere you want to live in by your
[1:17:57] worship to God oh hallelujah
[1:18:00] hallelujah okay A Man Without character
[1:18:03] can Reign because power apart from
[1:18:05] character is satanic but Power with
[1:18:07] character is fit to rule what we need is
[1:18:10] to get back to the word get back to the
[1:18:12] real word and that will bring forth a
[1:18:14] brigh to Christ back to the true word
[1:18:16] now watch God is obligated to meet you
[1:18:20] on the basis of them promises outside of
[1:18:22] them promises he can't meet you because
[1:18:24] you cut yourself off from him so your
[1:18:26] connection to God is based upon his
[1:18:29] promises are you with me oh blessed be
[1:18:32] the name of the Lord so therefore you
[1:18:34] are Sons and Daughters even before there
[1:18:36] was a moon or Star you are Sons and
[1:18:38] Daughters of God you are only the
[1:18:40] physical manifestation of the attributes
[1:18:42] that you are in God in the beginning
[1:18:45] isn't that right therefore you are Gene
[1:18:48] therefore as sure as your Gene had to be
[1:18:50] in your father before your natural birth
[1:18:53] your spiritual Gene had to be in God
[1:18:55] because you are an expression of the
[1:18:57] attributes of his thoughts before the
[1:18:59] foundation of the world there is no
[1:19:01] other way around it I want you to
[1:19:04] understand this election there is no
[1:19:05] other way around it you can't hope to be
[1:19:08] in it you have to be a thought before
[1:19:10] you could be a word before you can come
[1:19:12] into expression you have to be a gene
[1:19:14] back there oh hallelujah praise God Amen
[1:19:18] so what and through our Creed here we go
[1:19:23] we have disassociated to The Fellowship
[1:19:25] of the holy spirit this is
[1:19:27] powerful here what Creed does through
[1:19:30] Creeds we have disassociated the
[1:19:33] Fellowship of the Holy Spirit to anoint
[1:19:37] the word of God that is laced out for
[1:19:39] this generation we have separated the
[1:19:42] People by denomination that they cannot
[1:19:44] have a chance to see it see what the
[1:19:48] word for your generation amen not just
[1:19:51] that but your word because once you see
[1:19:53] your word your is your
[1:19:56] name if joh Jones inside of here and
[1:19:58] said John Jones he would say stand up
[1:20:00] stand up John Jones he stands up because
[1:20:01] he heard his name that's his name John
[1:20:03] Jones isn't that right when you hear the
[1:20:06] word that's your name your name is in
[1:20:08] the word isn't that right so you come to
[1:20:10] get connected to the reality of who you
[1:20:12] are now you bypass the word you came
[1:20:16] from
[1:20:17] thought to
[1:20:19] flesh to be tempted
[1:20:22] [Applause]
[1:20:24] a lot of times you only had taught to
[1:20:27] flesh but not the purpose taught to
[1:20:32] flesh to be
[1:20:34] tempted to be
[1:20:36] [Applause]
[1:20:39] tested so stop complaining about your
[1:20:42] Temptations that's what you are here
[1:20:44] [Applause]
[1:20:51] for some people will in through
[1:20:57] this is not SK this
[1:21:01] [Applause]
[1:21:03] morning Hallelujah you see here we go
[1:21:07] here I get
[1:21:08] to the attribute sons of his Spirit yes
[1:21:13] have not yet entered into the word form
[1:21:18] body we came from thought to flesh
[1:21:22] bypass did he offer the word body we
[1:21:24] have to connect back to
[1:21:27] that to be a real manifested son thought
[1:21:32] to flesh bypass the word but a word is a
[1:21:36] thought expressed so the word coming to
[1:21:39] you is your expression coming to
[1:21:43] you you are connecting with your
[1:21:46] expression so Jesus was clear when he
[1:21:49] said all that the father hath given me
[1:21:51] will come what he saying all the thought
[1:21:54] will become
[1:21:58] expressed I'm not hearing you when Jesus
[1:22:01] said my word will not written void
[1:22:04] that's
[1:22:05] [Music]
[1:22:06] true there is power in what we are
[1:22:09] preaching right now God don't need help
[1:22:12] to bring his word to pass he speaks and
[1:22:16] it is
[1:22:19] [Applause]
[1:22:20] so all he ask for us is to believe
[1:22:23] it amen look at ABR and Sarah God wait
[1:22:27] till the udge is awful Sarah passed
[1:22:29] bearing time Abraham is old and God come
[1:22:32] and tell Abraham you have a son

[1:22:35] be blessed and then Abraham start to act
[1:22:37] little kind of funny God say playing
[1:22:39] Fresh come outside and look at this
[1:22:40] Stars count them count he said take
[1:22:44] change your name of that to let your
[1:22:46] name be change from Abraham to Abraham
[1:22:48] meaning High father he walking with a
[1:22:50] father with no children you talk about
[1:22:52] mockery you talk about laughing he
[1:22:54] making laugh stuck God set it up like
[1:22:56] that he walk with that father title walk
[1:22:58] with father of Nations and you have no
[1:23:00] children that's the God we serve make
[1:23:02] the critics criticize make the muckers
[1:23:04] muck and scuff give a testimony and
[1:23:07] prophesy Isaac is
[1:23:09] [Applause]
[1:23:11] coming how long 25
[1:23:15] years oh Hallelujah and the Bible said
[1:23:19] Abraham a son Abraham as attribute of
[1:23:22] God believe God and not at the promise

[1:43:52] thing you can't
[1:43:53] he's not a filthy Spirit he's a Holy
[1:43:55] Spirit and when you become subject to
[1:43:57] that Spirit it CHS your whole being
[1:43:59] subject to that spirit and that spirit
[1:44:01] is nothing here we go that Spirit are
[1:44:04] you ready that spirit is nothing in the
[1:44:07] world but this seed word made manifest
[1:44:11] or quickened Hallelujah Made
[1:44:15] Alive do you understand why the foolish
[1:44:18] virgin will never receive the oil amen
[1:44:21] because they never receed the
[1:44:25] seed it was too late he said the spirit
[1:44:29] is nothing in the world but this seed
[1:44:33] word made manifest so when you come to
[1:44:36] church you come to church to get these

[1:44:57] into Spirit the mechanic Enoch reflected
[1:45:00] became Dynamics by the spirit and God
[1:45:02] took him so the word inside of you will
[1:45:05] turn into Spirit that's why the Bible
[1:45:08] when they say Lo here is
[1:45:10] Christ you know what that means L here
[1:45:13] is the man you're
[1:45:15] welcoming you say believe it not I like
[1:45:18] how the word say you know do not believe
[1:45:20] you know make it easy believe it not
[1:45:22] amen
[1:45:23] do not believe say look a man's man he's
[1:45:26] a man look every look for believe it not
[1:45:31] behold the kingdom is within
[1:45:34] [Music]
[1:45:36] you so when the revelation of God shows
[1:45:39] that you are pregnant with
[1:45:45] God Mary Mary ask right question how
[1:45:48] shall these things be
[1:45:53] he said the Holy Ghost shall over he
[1:45:54] said be it done unto me according to Thy
[1:45:57] word when you are pregnant with God Amen
[1:46:01] then you could Rejoice notice what Mary
[1:46:04] did when she received the word from the
[1:46:05] angel she ran to Elizabeth to testify of
[1:46:10] the Fulfillment of Prophecy in her
[1:46:14] life Christ is not yet manifest but
[1:46:17] she's witnessing the Angel's
[1:46:21] testimony because the scripture said a
[1:46:23] virgin shall conceive Mary know that's
[1:46:24] her name she know that's her the angel
[1:46:28] came as a witness of the scripture the
[1:46:31] angel have to come according to the word
[1:46:33] Hail Mary the Lord is with thee thou
[1:46:36] highly favored Oh Glory to God Mary you
[1:46:39] don't know that the Lord was always with
[1:46:41] her because she was a gene Tau in the
[1:46:43] mind of
[1:46:46] God but a 9-year-old can't produce no
[1:46:49] baby so why would the angel come and
[1:46:51] talk to Mary when she's nine
[1:46:56] has to be the right
[1:46:57] time oh so when she's ready what about
[1:47:00] you now oh Hallelujah why would God drop
[1:47:03] down signs and wonders to prove what we
[1:47:06] are right others are wrong what what
[1:47:07] where is the character where is the life
[1:47:09] it has to have a testimony of a life so
[1:47:11] when they have a testimony of a life and
[1:47:13] signs come nobody could question that
[1:47:15] and say that would be some unrighteous
[1:47:16] partaken of the Holy Ghost because he's
[1:47:18] a rascal that get anointed it can't be
[1:47:20] that it has to be a testimony first
[1:47:23] that's why we need thousand of voices
[1:47:25] devil could say whatever he want he go
[1:47:27] about with sweetness and Holiness and
[1:47:29] kindness say anything a real Christian
[1:47:32] that's what lacking now real Christian
[1:47:35] we have real church members we not
[1:47:37] talking about those
[1:47:38] guys Hallelujah we talking about real
[1:47:41] Christians that's the Thunder that
[1:47:44] shakes the devil Oh Glory to God real
[1:47:48] Christians real you can't lay a thinger
[1:47:50] on their life say anything to
[1:47:57] them Hallelujah I just feel away say
[1:48:01] anything to them what a test some of you
[1:48:04] so hot wrong your skin you can't say

[1:48:08] peas and D your eyes and so you could
[1:48:10] just flare up blood close to your skin

[1:48:20] serve you bam
[1:48:25] say fish when he open his

[1:49:20] anointing to do it you know
[1:49:23] Oh Glory
[1:49:25] Hallelujah oh here what I want to get
[1:49:27] think I going to wrap up here okay 2
[1:49:29] Corinthians 51 if there Earth tacle be
[1:49:31] dissolved we have another one we we have
[1:49:34] bypassed that to come straight from God
[1:49:36] the attribute to be flesh to be tempted
[1:49:38] and tested by sin like Adam did but when
[1:49:42] testing of his word was over then we are
[1:49:46] taken up in this body that prepared for
[1:49:48] us before the foundation of the world it
[1:49:51] is the word dear
[1:49:53] that we skipped to come right down here
[1:49:55] to be tempted and tested and if we have
[1:49:58] come through that we'll have there'll be
[1:50:00] no temptation we would know all things
[1:50:02] so if we came to a theophany we'd have
[1:50:04] known all things that's the reason Jesus
[1:50:07] know all things because he was word
[1:50:09] before he was flesh and then we become
[1:50:11] the word the other part I get close with
[1:50:14] this here right here on Earth are we
[1:50:17] ready ask come up
[1:50:19] please here we are formed to the word
[1:50:24] [Applause]
[1:50:25] [Music]
[1:50:28] image to be a partaker of the
[1:50:31] word to feed on the word by being
[1:50:36] predestinated since the beginning you
[1:50:39] see that little spark of life that you
[1:50:42] had in you from the beginning when you
[1:50:44] started your journey oh blessed be the
[1:50:46] name of the Lord hallelujah oh
[1:50:48] Hallelujah so here through the trials
[1:50:52] through the testing through the
[1:50:54] tribulation we are formed into the word
[1:50:58] image and that is what the Pentecostal
[1:51:00] missed they missed the word that could
[1:51:03] transform them into the statue of a
[1:51:05] perfect man amen character is not a gift
[1:51:09] is a victory and we are here to be
[1:51:11] tested and tempted and get mind battles
[1:51:15] and get Horrors and get pressed in order
