Glory to God. Hallelujah. He's here to touch you this morning. Oh, he's here to fill you this morning. Fill you with the Holy Ghost. seal you to the uttermost. Oh, lift up your hands this morning.

Praise the Lord this morning. Let all creation cry out the name of Jesus. He is our redeemer. He is a king of all the earth. The saints shall crown him. King of kings, lord of lords, all ruler of all things. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, he is here this morning. We feel the presence of God in the atmosphere of God where miracles take place, where the sick are healed, where demons flee. We feel the fire of God in the atmosphere of God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. There are angels [Applause] in this place this morning. Welcome to the house of the Lord. We're here to praise God. We're here to keep our motors humming. &gt;&gt; Amen. Stay on fire for him. He is got right early with his promise this morning. He's here to meet your need. So, God bless you once again. We're so grateful for his mercy this morning. And as we turn our Bibles over to the Psalms, we want to read a psalm of praise this morning, as we get ready for service and we want to commit this service into the Lord in prayer as well after the scripture reading. So Psalms chapter 91 which says, "He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the almighty. I will say of the Lord, he is my refuge and my fortress, my God, in him will I trust. Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence. He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou trust. His truth shall be thy shield and buckler. Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night, nor for the arrow that flyth by day, nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness, nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday. A thousand shall fall at thy side, and 10,000 at thy right hand, but it shall not come nigh thee. Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked, because thou hast made the Lord, which is my refuge, even the most high, thy habitation. May God add blessing to the reading of his word this morning. Why don't you just lift your hands and just worship him in your own way as we welcome the presence of the Lord and as we commit the service into the hands of the Lord. We ask for his presence this morning to fill our hearts, to fill our souls. You just worship him in your own way and just release your faith in this place this morning. We thank God for his presence. We we can't go without his presence this morning. And so we ask for him to bless us this morning. Amen. Almighty God, Lord, we are thankful today, Lord, we opened our eyes this morning to see your goodness, Lord, the light of the sun this morning coming through the window panes, Father, we know that it is a sign of your grace, Lord. Father, Lord, that the sun would rise again, Lord. Father, may the son of man, son of God rise this morning with healing in his wings this morning, Lord.

How you brought us through darkness, how you brought us through trials, how you brought us through testings, Lord. Times when we didn't think we would make it, but your hand was strong in the battle. Though we were weak, in your weakness, you were made strong this morning. We are only standing here this morning by the grace of almighty God. Nothing we did in ourselves. No power, no education, no greatness, Lord, no achievement, nothing we have, but in your hands we come and commit ourselves, oh God, the house of God, we give you praise this morning. We thank you this morning, Lord, for your goodness. And we just want to commit this service into your hands. Lord, may you have your way with us, Lord.

Change our hearts as we stand on your word. Holy Spirit, [Music] rain down. I trust that's your desire tonight. That's your prayer tonight. That the Holy Spirit would rain down. Praise the Lord. So God bless you. It's a privilege to be here tonight uh to be one more time in the presence of God and to share with you the word of God. Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So tonight we want to go to the scriptures. We want to read two portion of scriptures tonight from St. John chapter 14 verse 14- 26 and Luke chapter 16 1 verse verse 16. St. John chapter 14 reading verse 14. If you shall ask anything in my name I will do it. If you love me, keep my commandments and I will pray the father. This is Jesus talking and he will give you another comforter. So referencing another comforter where he himself being among them, he was a comforter with them. But he's talking about another comforter. So he was the word and he's prophesying of the spirit. &gt;&gt; I shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever. &gt;&gt; Even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive. This is not the spirit of error. It's not a spirit of lies. The spirit of truth and the world cannot receive because it seen not knoweth him. But he knoweth even you know him for he dwelleth with you shall be in you. I will not leave you comfortless. I will come to you. Yet a little while the world seeth you no more but you see me because I live you shall live also. At that day you shall know that I am in my father and he in me and I in you. He's saying to them you don't know that now but at that day you will know this. &gt;&gt; Amen. Vers 21. He that my commandments and keepeth them, he that loveth me, he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and I belove him. I will manifest myself to him. And Jerusalem unto him, not his scar lord. How is it that thou would manifest thyself and thus not the world? Answer. Jesus answered and said unto him, if a man love me, he will keep my words, and my father will love him, and we will come unto him, and will make our bow with him. He that loveth me not giveth up my sins. And the word which you heard is not mine, but the father which sent me. These things have I spoken unto you being yet present with you. But but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name. Send operating word whom the father will send in my name. He shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance. was since that time the kingdom of God is preached and every man will speak to them. Take me out that Peter was uh responsible for what he shared by words to Cornelius's house. But Lord, he was not responsible for the moving of the spirit and the dynamic operation of the Holy Spirit that fell on Cornelius and the gathering at Cornelius home. Because the scripture declare why Peter yet spake these words. The Holy Ghost fell upon them that heard the word. It was such a shocking thing to Peter and the other Jews with him. They were astonished that the Holy Ghost itself was being poured out upon the Gentiles just as they had had it in the upper room. And it was an astonishing thing for them to see it. So Peter wasn't in charge of opening that pipe of the spirit. You are in charge of that, Lord. And we pray that you would come on tonight and open up in the people's hearts and lives right in their homes the fire of God, the healing virtue of Christ, the deliverance, Lord, the witness of your spirit, the power of God. Even right now while we are praying, let the dove sweep into every home, every heart, every life, Lord, and bring that victory to them, Lord. Oh God, we are depending on you tonight. Uh always will feel, Lord, but you always can't feel. And we believe that we're moving to that cycle, father, of the spirit uh having the preeminences of the spirit having the oversight for your deepest desire is to see the sons in such a position that you can say there is my spirit flowing freely. No hidden agenda, no politics, no unclean spirit, no crooked life, just a channel of God that you can flow freely. Father God, may you find such a a place tonight in our hearts where you knocked on all the doors and you are available to every crevice in our lives that with the freedom of spirit, Lord, the liberty and of God that that that the word can be operational tonight, Lord, in Jesus name we ask it. Amen and amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, tonight have a title, the purpose of God sending the Holy Ghost. That's the title tonight. The purpose of go and holy ghost and I have an inspiration. Every man must press. &gt;&gt; Every man must press. I like to always find things that we are responsible for. You know like how the Bible says the secret thing belong unto God when things that are revealed belong to us. Isn't that right? So secrets God in charge of that. But what belong to us belong to us what have been revealed. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now uh let's let's go see what the Lord will do tonight. Now have you ever seen have you ever seen this? You see in our churches today even the groups where we have separate ourselves and make organization we see all of this. Have you seen a man here we go pick up a certain scripture and brother that man can take that scripture and make it live new. Make it live just exactly what is promising in the Bible. And the next man will see him do it. And he will come around and try to do it and fail. I hope you're reading now. He'll fail. Why? The scripture is not inspired to him. &gt;&gt; He's only trying to impersonate. He's trying to act like something. What? Watch. He said, "Now watch. But what about the church? What kind of Messiah is the church looking for today? The church has been crying the loudest. We holling about the Messiah. We are looking revival our time. What are they looking for to do it? What more do you want? What does the church want anyhow? We already cut it. &gt;&gt; God give it to us. It's his promise for this hour. &gt;&gt; We look in the Bible. We see it everywhere through the Bible. Anointed ones come on and make that word live again. &gt;&gt; Listen to it. &gt;&gt; Anointed ones. If it's not anointed, how could it really live? &gt;&gt; It will take the atmosphere, the presence, the power, the anointing to make that word live. Dry, dead, cold, formal. No life coming to that. It has to be the breath of God. &gt;&gt; So here it is now. Anointed ones, come on and make that word live again right in the hour for that hour. Now we have got the Messiah. This is him, the word. In the beginning was the word. The word was with God. The word was God. And the word remains God. The same yesterday, and forever. We are wanting the Messiah. And God give us the Messiah. What's the Messiah? His promised word for this day. &gt;&gt; It's just waiting for somebody with faith to anoint it and make it live again. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the name of the Lord. So I want to encourage you tonight that all we have need of is in the message of the hour is in the books is in the tapes but it takes faith to anoint every divine promise and you have to claim it for yourself. Ain't that right? So he said he says no Martin Luther mechanics and dynamics of this day. John Wesley had them. Pentecostal had them of their day. What about our day? Yeah, &gt;&gt; this is another time &gt;&gt; the church should be fully grown now, ready to meet Christ with the manifestation of every blessing that he promised in the Bible, operating in that one great body where he promised he would meet the people and be worshiped in this great church of his. &gt;&gt; Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. We believe that tonight that the church should be fully grown, ready to meet Christ with what? in books and tapes. No, with the manifestation of every blessing that he promised in the Bible operating in that one great body that he promised he would meet the believer, the people and be worshiped. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. So God's purpose of sending the Holy Spirit is one purpose, one purpose. That God himself might dwell in his church and continue his plans through the church. That's why the Holy Spirit told the prophet Peter the penant right by and through the bride will be fulfilled all that was promised. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; That God was in Christ continue his plans through Christ out of Christ into the church continuing his work through the church. All God was he coming to Christ. All that Christ was he poured into the church. What is it? God working in you anywhere in the world that he would want to call on you, working in you to do his good will. Oh, we ought to thank God for that. Thank God the Holy Spirit is sent for the purpose of God living in his church, moving through each age. Isn't that right? He was lifted up between heaven and earth, died and redeemed everything and it bleeding. Hallelujah. He sanctified a church that he himself might live in. Not come to church. Now his blood is what sanctified the church because he can only come to a sanctified life. Oh, glory to God. And that's why it was so powerful. The testimony of Cornelius, he was just and devout and a man that was praying always. He don't know about Jesus. Hallelujah. You don't know what's going to unfold. But they God was so pleased with his prayer and his testimony that God sent visitation of an angel to tell him to send for Peter because Peter was part of this body of Christ. This operational functional acts this channel of God that life the mount of Peter. Oh glory to God. And Peter on new grounds was challenged to rise and kill and eat. And he was challenged to go to these Gentiles called to minister to the Gentiles. Oh, glory to God. And all Peter to do was to give a witness, a testimony by word of what happened. And while he was giving testimony, while he was speaking, while he was witnessing what he saw, what he experienced, the spirit bore witness. Oh, glory of God. And once more, the spirit will return and return and has returned to the witness of the Lord himself everywhere. My word is a blessing for you. I'm serving the word with signs following the Lord. Supernatural power, supernatural, supernatural presence. Oh, glory to God. People supernatural. But something supernatural has to happen to you. Something has to happen to you. is the operation of God that operated supernaturally desire to take a life God. Oh, hallelujah. Praise God. And he was lifted up in heaven, died and redeem everything. And indeed he sanctified a church that he himself might live in and fellowship and commune with that lost spot of fellowship from the garden of Eden where God came down in the cool of the evening. I can see why God leave these last day sons to receive the full revelation of the mystery of God that he could fully commune with them and have fellowship with them. What a privilege to be this hour. It's crazy outside here. It is crazy. It'll get crazy. But we are blessed and privileged because many wise men and we all could be just as Hallelujah. When the sons of God will be born into manifestation tonight. Hallelujah. Just think about it. And sons of God will be born into manifestation. Oh, glory to God. And he will touch the earth with the power and the supernatural presence of the Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. Praise God. [Applause] Because we are under. Hallelujah. He brought the light to us. Hallelujah. That we can walk in that light and manifest that supernatural light. Hallelujah. Tonight, that's the purpose of the Holy Ghost. is the father again. God the father dwelling in you, working out his plans to finish his plan of redemption, working through you, making you a coworker with him, giving you a place, giving you a part for your fallen lost brother. Today is not just to settle in church and my bets. You know this is giving a pack for your whole brother because one day the last name going to be called into that book from the book will be called and redeemed and that redeemer is unveiled all the way to charity redeemed. Then the book is closed but one more to be saved. Oh glory to God. The book is finished and then God to the Jews. Hallelujah. Praise God. Giving you a part for the fallen brother. Just imagine that we have a part still to play. Oh, glory to God to go after the lost lost after fallen. Those that lost the way. Oh, glory to God to go after come back. The spirit and the bride come. Oh, glory to God. The spirit is here and the bride is here. The spirit and the bride is coming. Oh, glory to God. Giving you a part with him. Giving you a place. Giving you a part for your foremost brother and sister. giving you his spirit and his love to go hunt the lost as he did in the garden of Eden. Not saying this one is shocked this one finished [Music] this one finished. &gt;&gt; I guess I guess when they s Christian they say finished with glory God going to do a mighty work and flip him from Saul to Paul. Hallelujah. Let the church member say what they want. God going and change that man. Oh, glory to God. Nobody didn't put your name in the book and they can't take it out. Oh, give the Lord a shout. That's why we are free this night. Hallelujah. Praise God. Giving you his spirit and his love to go hunt the lost as he did in the garden of Eden. Adam, Adam, where thou? That's what the Holy Ghost does to a man or woman when it strikes the heart and takes it abode. There's a thirst and hungering for lost souls. And then here we go. Then as soon as he gets his church in speaking conditions, Uhhuh. speaking conditions when you could speak and he could speak back. Then you qualify to access God. I have heard your prayer. I have heard your cry. Oh, glory to God. Speaking conditions, not a one-way thing where God talking and behind the pulpit you're hearing word, word, word. That speaking conditions is mean you're back almost like back to Eden where God could talk to you and you could talk back to him where the spirit is there. The Bible said Jesus said he'll another comforter and he will bring things to your remembrance conditions not a one-way
