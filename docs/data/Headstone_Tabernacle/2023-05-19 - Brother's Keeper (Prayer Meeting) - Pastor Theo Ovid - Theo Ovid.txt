it's from the Bible you don't have to find it I'll put it up if you could read it back over and meditate on it and it's something that struck me about Brother's Keeper and I'll we just want to go straight into the wood tonight so if you want to follow with me that's fine I want to read from Exodus chapter 20. reading from first one so I'll go and I guess go therefore just listen and see what the Lord will do tonight amen and God speak all these words saying I am the Lord thy God which I brought thee out of land of Egypt out of the house of bondage Thou shalt have no other gods before me thou shall not make any make on the DNA agreement image only likeness of anything that is in the heaven above that is an it that is in the water under the Earth Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them nor serve them for I the Lord thy God I'm a jealous God visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me note note it put a responsibility here upon fathers so it's not just that your father in a vacuum [Music] foreigns upon the children until the third fourth generation of them with six showing mostly under thousands of them that love me and keep my Commandments thou shall not take the name of the Lord I got in vain for the Lord will not fool him Guiltless that taken him in vain remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy and and so on first 12 under thy father and thy mother that thy days may be known upon the land which now of the Lord I love it though shall not kill Thou shalt not commit adoption Thou shalt not steal Thou shalt not be a force witness against thy neighbor Thou shalt not covered thy neighbor's house but shall not cover their neighbor's wife nor his man's servant nor his need servants no it's Ox no his ass not anything that is thy neighbors and all the people saw the thunderous and the Lightnings and the noise of a trumpet and the mountain smoking and when the people saw it they removed and stood afiled and they said unto Moses speak thou witness and we will hear but let not God speak with us lest we die and Moses said unto the people fear not for God has come to prove you and that is fear maybe among your feces that you send them so you see what happened there God himself came down on filtered if I could use that word on the mountain when they begin to rock and Shake us God gave his word the people said don't let God speak let Moses speak and since that time God chooses to send prophets the word of the Lord come to the prophet's man shall live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth to the Mount of God so God sent prophets to bring his word to us I want to switch now to Matthew chapter 25. we're in verse 34. and Jesus in rip in form dealing with Pharisees and Sadducees and Scribe all the religious characters in that day all in Scrolls of Moses and verse 34 22 says but when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence you shut them up they will gather together then one of them which was a lawyer asked him a question tempted him and saying Master which is the great commandment in the law question now the first thing we just read was the Commandments okay so here is the New Testament uh trickster yeah asking for edification to argue to fight Master which is of the great commandment in the law and Jesus said unto them Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart with all thy soul with all thy mind so Jesus himself answered this this is the greatest commandment though shall love that the Lord thy God with all thy heart with all thy soul with all thy mind you don't need money to do this you don't need hoes to do this you don't need wife husband children mother brother father sister this is you Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart with all thy soul with all thy mind and then he says this is the first and Greek commandment one two even verse 39 the second is like unto it go shall love thy neighbor as thyself on these two Commandments hang on the law and the prophets so Jesus is saying that these two Commandments laws are the summary of all the Commandments you have heard about now Leviticus chapter 19 reading from verse 16 it reads us Thou shalt not go up and down as a clear Bearer among thy people neither shall thou stand against the blood of thy neighbor I am the Lord so God was not just bringing him bringing them word or Commandments for his law he was bringing to them Behavior attitude uh uh things pertinental life and godliness as they were here but Isaac say often thou shall not go Pandora stand against the blood of thy brother I am the Lord though shall not hit thy brother in thy heart aha see I mean where we have hit in the heart though shall in any wise we do thy neighbor and not suffer sin upon Him Thou shalt not avenge here we go no beer any Grudge against the children of thy people but though shall love thy neighbor as thyself I am the Lord now let's look at the Amplified of this Leviticus 19. you shall not go up and down as a dispenser of gossip and Scandal among your people nor shall you secure Yourself by false testimony or by science endanger the life of your neighbor I am the Lord you shall not hate your brother in your heart but you shall surely rebuke your neighbor at least you in close sin because of him you shall not take revenge or bear any grudge against the sons of your people but you shall love your neighbor as yourself I am the Lord so you could see that this Duty or this issue of Grudge and oats and holding things against your brother or neighbor this thing was identified or fleshed out since in the orgasm and here in Genesis chapter 4 you know the story with Keem here it is of course we know he's of the serpentes of the devil and his nature is terrible and the Bible described it about uh Abel and Kim and verse 3 of which four chapter forces and the process of time it came to pass the king brought the fruit of the ground are offered unto the Lord foreign thou shall rule over here and King talked with Abel's brother he in the past when they were in the field the king rose up against evil and slew him that's to kill him and today is not physically killing you can break the effect of someone your friend family Minister different one Elder Deacon by sins tough that breaks people confidence in that person that's killing them they're killing the influence you know today we have years ago that didn't even exist we have what are called influences now uh influences are people who have a large following whether on Tick Tock or or Instagram or on Facebook or whatever it is and and people could send products to them and they would influence people to purchase this product so they become Powerhouse in themselves they are called influences and there are people who have influences on others but punks uh their negative and punks their Vibes on others and influence them contrary contrary to the wood control God's plan foreign and the Lord Senator King where is it by thy brother oh this is interesting it's not that God didn't know what happened you know of course God knew came to kill the evil or he's speaking to the man he's asking a question he wants to hear from his mouth his response and God speaks to us many times he wants our response not your silence your response and the Lord shall not the king where is he by thy brother and he said I know no no am I My Brother's Keeper here it is am I My Brother's Keeper the question tonight is would you go on in your life in this selfish mode in this cave mood in this tunnel vision mode where you go in the Rapture or you think you're going to Rapture all alone and you don't care about nobody else but you you have no interest no burden no put into nothing others every church for a long flat it doesn't matter no burden for your household no burden for your wife your husband your children nobody for nobody you are living your stuff you live in your story God says am I My Brother's Keeper and he said what has thou done the voice of thy brother's blood cries unto me from the ground I hope tonight that these few things that we are sharing we kind of rocket on that rocking our Consciousness that in this battle we are in we have brothers we have sisters we have those that we can see and those that we cannot see and they are still Sons and Daughters of God they are around the world there's a lack around the world in different nations and people for his namesake what has called out to be bride of Christ in this last day Jesus speaks speaking to disciples a new commandment I have given unto you that you love one another as I have loved you that you also love one another why would Jesus say that why because these disciples know came from different background different one of the one is a lawyer one is a fisherman one is this one is that and all the backgrounds wasn't in harmony with each other say the taxman collection taxes he was unloved by the fisherman or men who they call it contacts from him but the fact is God called all of them so you kind of say God do call this one do call this one we are not the one to tell God who to call She's Too Tall She's Too Short he's too big he's too thin whatever you can't do that we leave that up to God we have to connect with the source that's what we have to connect with so Jesus knowing they're going through it's tough he's a new commandment I given to you that you love one another as I have loved you and he shall love one another and then he said these words by this shall all men know that you are my disciple when a competition want to talk to nobody no when you come to church and decide to treat who you like and so on no by this shall women know that you're my disciples if you have loved one to another now love is something is not talk love is something that could be expressed something can be displayed something that we should that we often say You must a dog know if you love you know the job is still the atmosphere or you tell them get and you know you're running the dog love is something that is real you can't show it as an Evidence the material the thing but it is expressed oh God so loved the world he gives love is active love is not passive love believe it all things open all things enjoy all things love is active so by this shall all men know that you are my disciples if you have loved one for another so I'm showing tonight the importance of understanding that you in your circle in your little family Circle in your own world you cannot think that is the world you cannot think that is God's order because God set up a program where his people will be a people not just a people to God but the people that will be working and dealing with each other and it come like Johan can't ask for Independence neither could your neck all the bodies all the positive bodies as tempered together to accomplish a purpose you want to get up well the foot gets to walking you want to get something your hand get to move it you want to speak you're more good to talk it you want to taste your tongue is responsible in that area there the smell eyes the sea and God tempered the whole body so nanka Chris one another and say well I'm more better than you and I'm more prominent and I'm in front no you have to work with the way that God ordered stuff and that is how it is one person could be a foot a hand a two or whatever it is but we are all members of one body let's continue now first John two reading from verse seven Brethren this is John no no you hear what Jesus talked about my new commandment and here John uh in John he's reiterating this Brethren I write no new commandment unto you but an old commandment which you have from the beginning the old commandment is the word which you have heard from the beginning again a new commandment I wrote unto you which thing is true in him and in you because the darkness is passed and a True Light no shame it he that see it he's in the light and he said his brother is in darkness even until now and I am talking about in this message if I'm unclean he's in the light and it is brother we know he is and no light at all yeah I believe that's that's just talk verse 10 he that loveth his brother abides in the light and there is none occasion of stumbling in him verse 11. so John come back again with this but he hated his brother he's in that place and walk it in darkness and know it not whether he grew it because Darkness has blinded his eyes so hatred is a powerful thing hatred blames hatred kick out your eyes hatred make you walk in darkness let's go to Romans 13 and hear what Paul says in verse 8. all don't mind anything but to love one another or he that love it another had fulfilled the law Paul John Jesus Oh saying the same thing verse 9 for this adultery Thou shalt not kill Thou shalt not steal Thou shalt not be a false witness Thou shalt not commit if there be any other commandment it is briefly comprehended in this Saiyan namely though shall Love Thy Neighbor as thyself question do you love your neighbor as yourself and if you want to know who is your neighbor go back to the parable of Jesus and we give the parable Jesus We Stand love will get no ill to his neighbor love will get no ill to his neighbor that's what the Bible says therefore love is the Fulfillment of the law remember whatever I'm talking about a sister who couldn't get a good church she's working hard she's feeling the house see more the children or whatnot and somebody rebuking her and telling about Bible and different things and whatnot and she said when Jesus come I'll show you in my hands it's a powerful thing she was committed to her responsibilities and everything else and you know a religious person will say well this that that that that but I'll show you in my hands what do you have to show God their love is the fulfilling of the law who's 11 and that knowing the time that no is high time to wake up out of sleep for now is our Salvation here whatever when we first believed and when we believe the night is Fast Man the days at hand let us therefore cast off the work of Darkness let us put on the arm of light let us walk honestly as in the day not in writing and drunkenness nothing chambering unwantedness doesn't strive for envying and put you on the Lord Jesus and make my Provisions for the flesh to fulfill the lust thereof Matthew 18. this is coming down where the ties the road Matthew 18. and this is Jesus speaking here in verse 15. moreover If thy brother shall trespass against thee and go and tell go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone so Jesus is begin practical living do you know big mystery you know hot sun brother head this is behavior and issues and life and you see if you rather do something against you affect you go to him alone don't go to the phone and courses and so and so on but so and so and you tell 10 people and yeah no he didn't say do that he said don't do that you go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone these with a specific these words are guidance these words are written in red he says Jesus speaking if he shall hear thee that was getting thy brother business self issues done it's still right dear but if he will not Yeti then take with d one or two more that is an amount of two or three Witnesses every will be established so the person have some problem with you and you go to them they don't want to hear they all auto tune and they and that's kind of crazy mood that is when you get two or three persons to go with you and go back to that this is what the word says watch and if he will not hear thee take two three one or two more that the mode of two or three Witnesses everyone may be establish and if he shall neglect to hear them tell it to the church so this is where the Jewish body comes in and this is where of course people who not in church in that way do belong to assembly or committed to our group then this doesn't affect them in that way but this is what she is talking about the church functioning and strength and power tell it to the church and if you need to get to hear the church let him be as an hidden man or Publican in other words is this Fellowship he's on his own group 19. again I say unto you oh my this is you should praise God on this one here so Jesus is talking he's preaching he's sharing and then he's moving into this gate I sent you that if two of you shall agree on Earth as touching anything that they shall ask it shall be done for them of My Father which is heaven could you give the Lord some praises to them so he is saying not you alone this is specific if two of you so Jesus put something in asking would join in with connection with agreement touching anything anything that they shall ask it shall be done for them but my father is in them for where two or three are gathered together in mining they am I in the midst of them so the picture that you on your own and you don't need these connections and you're only two and three and you don't need and you don't need and you're you don't have to connect and relate and communicate and you know that is not what the Bible teaches so when Jesus dropped all of this law about uh if your brother trespass against you of course you must have somebody want to get some clarity and then Peter came in verse 21 then Peter came to him and said Lord how shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him two seven times now this I guess would have been a big number in Peter's mind Jesus said unto him I say not unto thee until seven times but until Seventy Times Seven so Jesus was bringing Clarity to how deep this forgiveness this dropping bro it's just getting it right with your brother here Max 11. almost done sorry about this but this is what happened Mark 11 familiar scripture verse 22 Jesus answered 70 and half feet and God for realizing to you that whosoever shall see under this mountain Beetle removed will be the cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart which I believe that those things which he said shall come to pass if you have whatever is here so that is the third full speaking the word right but before that let's go therefore I say unto you whatever you desire When you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them they leave it before you get it and you're gonna get it verse 25 this is the part we come to now but when you stand praying like we are going to bring tonight forgive if you have water against any fought against who any husband wife children Pastor Elder vegan neighbor boss doesn't matter with it if you're born against any lacked purpose that your father also which is in heaven May forgive you your trespasses so if you do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive trespasses in other words your sin is still on you if you can't forgive your brother that's what that is and this is where I got this inspiration from from Job chapter 42. and I know but Isaac speaking the spoken I mean we touch it sometimes but this is something to reflect on again tonight this is job you know this story so I'm not going to go over that but this is job 42 now this is way down the line then job answered the Lord and said I know that all kinds do everything that no thought can be withholden from thee who is he that guided counsel without knowledge therefore I have uttered what I understood not things too wonderful for me which I knew now by the hearing of the ear but not my eyes see it wherefore I am all myself and repenting dust and Ashes it is such a tremendous thing to come to this spot where you could truly hate yourself and repent Investments take out all the Masquerade take all the holy pretense and the action and so on and it was so so job came to this spot this is the spot you know call it a place call it the Anchor Point call it a junction have you reached this spot you just have to get to this you see this part here you don't make excuses well that is why I ask so because they and the church and he and and if he didn't do it so I was gonna do it so and the reason all of that is all that is gimmick all that is just fluff uh there is nothing uh that could say yes you know like God will hear your reason and say oh it's so you know it's true oh gosh that was going through or or that is why that is why he was misbehaving because your father didn't give you this or your mother oh okay say whatever you want to wait and you have an excuse that excuse and that explanation is not acceptable this here verse 6 I upore myself and repent in those and Ashes verse 7 and it was so that after the Lord has spoken these words unto job the Lord said unto elephants and to determinate my rat is Kingdom against thee and against thy two friends for you have not spoken of me the thing that is right as my servant job had [Music] and my seven jokes I pray for you for him will I accept who God is accepted a man that has come to Jordan a man that has come to the place where I abhor myself and repentance am I even the streets or myself I repent and just I am somebody forget that I am all myself and repent in destinations watch this let's move it again therefore taken to you know seven Bullocks seven rounds go to myself and job and all for yourself support offering and my servant job shall pray for you for him will I accept at least I delivered you after your Folly in that ye have not spoken of me the thing which is right like myself and job so elephants the timonite and bildad the shushite and so far they're nehemite went and did according to the Lord commanded and the Lord accepted job this is the verse I want to get to verse 10. and the Lord turn the Captivity of job when he prayed for his friends also the Lord give job twice as much as he had before now job could have took take up on approach that these Rascals these hypocritical Christians who come and say like a secret sinner things I want to see them again I'm done that is it I Shake In The Hand fellowship and whatnot foreign the Lord turn the Captivity of job when when he prayed for his friends let me ask a question who do you pray for what what is the burden the Bible talk about love your enemies who do you pray for who you we have a burden for you're living for you God is just like a side show for some of you it has to change you have to take it more serious because see you and captivity some of you you captivity by your decisions by your mouth by your attitude by your pride by your arrogance I want to wrap up here but oh Lord I was just loading this this evening here with this thing friends there are so many things we could say tonight about the perfection we are always trying to go to the eyes out of somebody else to make ourselves just a little holier than they are but if we look at the picture it is only God's grace that we are what we are and but Obama don't forget this story and I think I'll run it through tonight I'm sorry I want to apologize but I feel that this is something that is needed to be spoken sometime here I'll go on Ohio I learn and listen the hard way I was having a meeting down in Ohio I was staying in our country because the masses I could not see in the city is it in a restaurant lovely little waitress decently dressed ladylike and I was a little hungry I went over to ordinary little common American restaurant machine going Standing There was a man of my age a perhaps a married man with his arms around a woman playing a slot machine on I tune and look towards the back of the building there was a bunch of teenage boys rock and roll music I look over to my right I heard someone make a big groan set an age woman probably 60 years 70 years she had those old vulgar clothes on sandals perpet toenails painted doing toenails and here was really short cooled up [Music] and excuse themselves and started walking out to the restrooms I stood there well this is what a Brand number and I said God why don't you destroy the whole thing why don't you just sink it needed it I said it's my little Sarah and Rebecca going to have to grow up under this stuff as that I said how can you God in your great Holiness ever stand and look at such a thing like that unless we can sink it and I was standing there condemning the woman as I was I stepped back behind the door and felt the spirit of God come upon me and I stepped behind the door and I see something whirling so he's breaking in a vision I notice around the world was a Scarlet streak around the world and as I got to the world I see myself a little boy so God has shown him himself doing things that I ought not to do maybe not like that but it was sin and every time I did anything I've seen a great black shadow go towards him which God would have killed me at that minute and I see standing between me and God that perfect sacrifice I seen him standing there with tones on talking with Jesus on his head and they spit hanging on his face and every time I sins would start towards God he will reach it and catch it like a bumper on a car he was protected me from death and every time I would do anything wrong God would have killed me certainly his Holiness requires it is not requires it every time I'll do anything you do anything the blood of Jesus acts like a bumper I seen that kind of streak meant that the blood still holds the earth I stood looking I got a little closer to him I noticed he said father forgive him he doesn't know what he's doing and I look down and they lead a book and there's a recording Angel there standing by side and every time I sinned was put down in the book wow my name was on it and I realized that someday that blood streak would be listed I have to stand in the presence of God with my sinful life but I seen his Mercy he was holding off my judgment I went in humbly I knelt on my knees I said oh Jesus though Son of God I'm unworthy to come in your presence will you please forgive me for what I've done he touched his side with his hand took the old book wrote pardon showed it back behind him and my sins were gone so all this is a division right then you look at the stone in the face and said no no I have forgiven you but you want to condemn her then I seen what it meant so God take him show him his own life and said well look I forgive you and you come to condemn that woman as I come out of the vision I walk over to her I said how do you do she was drinking she said oh hello I said could I sit down she's half company I said I don't mean it that way lady I just want to speak to you a minute she said I said lady just a few minutes ago standing under behind that door so but a balance is going to share the experience that God gave him I began to tell her and I begin to look at tears because I run on my cheeks she told me I said lady you don't mean to do these things Jesus died the judgments of God is held off by his blood you don't mean to do this she said no sir she said my father was a dignity in church I was raised in a Christian home my husband and I were chatted members and live their Christian Life she began to tell me after his death she had two young girls she went the street on how the girls had left her she threw the life away she thought there was no hope for her I said God be merciful those he has foreign I said I am she said I'm ashamed of myself to be sitting here like this do you think there's a chance for me I said Jesus had his arms stretched out waiting for you to come lady and the other people began to take up I said would you walk out here in this floor with me she said I will so I took her back and I said you are the age of my mother would you kneel here with me in the floor and there in the floor we broke up that place that afternoon in an old-fashioned meeting and God see that woman by his grace she's dressed herself come to the meeting my father I know live in a Christian Life Tonight what is it God requires perfection he requires your repentance he requires your loyalty to him and he's looking tonight no matter how much you have sinned how little or how much you are still a sinner can it come in no other way but by Jesus Christ God all sufficient sacrifice and in him you're perfected forever think of it it's not nothing you do it's not new pages you turn but I know some of you have heard this years and years and over and over but God helped me tonight help us at night now they strike you it is not new pages you turn it is not a new life you start it's a confession of your own and God's grace to you that brings you to Perfection and then you are perfected in Jesus Christ but I'm almost done I want to get to Hannah and Hannah we know this man had two wives one was Hannah and the name of the other was a penina then I have children had no children and they came to me I talk about Hannah's Prayer and this time I went out early to worship and sacrifice unto the Lord and when the time of elkana offered Mrs Anna's husband he gave Pena his wife to all her sons and daughters portions but under Hannah he gave a worthy portion for he loved Hannah but the Lord had shut up a woman now you talk about drama in your house you talk about challenges in your own homes but her adversary this other woman in the house provoked her soul to make a threat because the Lord had shut up so because things wasn't working and had a favor there's somebody a personal terrorist a terrorist right inside your house in your house terrorizing you because you're not producing what is a pretty good news and as he did so yeah by year when she went into the house of the Lord she poof booked her therefore she wept and did not eat so therefore this provocation was going on for a long time and it came to a spot a breaking point where Hannah just crying didn't want to eat and then said elkana her husband to her Hannah five people so why why he says donut why is that hard grief am I not better than to read on tensions upon their seat by the pools of the Temple of the Lord and she was in bitterness of Soul we're talking about travel of Soul this sister was in it prayed unto the Lord and he vote that vote to God this is what she tell the Lord oh lord of host if thou will indeed look to the Affliction of the anatomy and remember me and not forget that handmade but will give unto thine handmade a man chat then I will give him unto the Lord all of these of my life there shall no reason come upon his head came to pass she continued praying before the Lord and He line marked a mocked did I not going by really he said I see him you see your mouth moving no Hannah she speak in her heart only her lips move but her voice was not heard therefore Eli thought she had been dropped Elijah how long will they'll be drunk put away I went from the I I don't answer and I said no my Lord I am a woman of sorrowful spirit what we said last time a woman was in travail what you reap betrayed but joy come on a man shall come forth when you interview the sorrowful thing I have drawn you know why no strong drink but I've poured out my soul before the lord caught not thy hand made for our daughter abelia for out of your abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken beard you know some people underwear pressure I didn't know that some of you are not tremendous person what do you do when you're in depression when you're under stress when you're under brief when you're on the soul when you're in a pain and you can't even express it as you would like to express it what Hannah choose to do is it will be for God that's what we're here for tonight go before God when they are inside
