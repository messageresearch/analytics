[22:18] turn over now to the scripture amen and
[22:22] I want to tun to three portions of
[22:24] scriptures amen thank you musicians
[22:26] praise God
[22:30] Hallelujah um we want to go to the book
[22:32] of St Matthew Chapter 13 we're going to
[22:36] read from verse 3 to 17 and then we'll
[22:40] read a scripture in Isaiah and then
[22:42] Revelation okay
[22:45] so
[22:47] amen
[22:52] hallelujah praise
[22:55] God
[22:56] Amen
[22:59] St Matthew chapter
[23:05] 3en uh St Matthew chapter 3 uh sorry St
[23:09] Matthew Chapter 13 and verse 3 amen
[23:12] sorry about that mix it up um praise God
[23:15] so so you can find chapter 13 and um and
[23:19] then we read from three uh verse three
[23:22] so here he's talking about the parable
[23:24] of the the the S and the seed amen so
[23:28] from verse three it says and he spake
[23:30] many things unto them in Parables saying
[23:33] Behold a sore went forth to swow amen
[23:36] and when he swed some seeds fell by the
[23:38] wayside and the fowls came and devoured
[23:41] them up some fell upon Stony places
[23:44] where they had not much Earth and fought
[23:46] with they sprung up because they had no
[23:49] deepness of Earth and when the sun was
[23:52] up they were scorched and because they
[23:55] had no root they withered away and some
[23:58] fell among thorns and the Thorns sprung
[23:59] up and choked them but other fell into
[24:03] good ground and brought forth fruit some
[24:07] 100 fold some 60 fold and some 30 fold
[24:11] who are THS to hear Let Him hear now
[24:14] hear this part and the disciples came
[24:16] unto
[24:17] him uh and said unto him why speakest
[24:21] thou unto them in Parables and he
[24:24] answered and said unto them because it
[24:27] is given unto you to know the mysteries
[24:30] of the kingdom of heaven but to them it
[24:33] is not given for whosoever hath to him
[24:36] shall be given and he shall have more
[24:39] abundance but whosoever hath not from
[24:42] him shall be taken away even that he had
[24:45] therefore speak I to them in Parables
[24:48] because they seeing see not and hearing
[24:52] they hear not neither do they understand
[24:55] and in them is fulfilled a prophecy as
[24:57] is
[24:58] of of isas which saith by hearing ye
[25:01] shall hear and shall not understand and
[25:03] seeing he shall see and not perceive for
[25:06] this people's heart is wax gross and
[25:08] their ears are full are dull of hearing
[25:11] and their eyes they have closed lest at
[25:14] any time they should see with their eyes
[25:16] and hear with their ears and should
[25:18] understand with their heart and should
[25:19] be converted and I should heal them but
[25:23] blessed are your eyes for they see and
[25:26] your ears for they hear
[25:28] Jesus said for verily I say unto you
[25:31] that many prophets and righteous men
[25:33] have desired to see those things which
[25:35] he see and have not seen them and to
[25:38] hear those things which ye hear and have
[25:41] not heard them amen so very privileged
[25:44] people we are this morning Amen to see
[25:47] what we see and to hear what we hear
[25:49] okay so let's go over now to Isaiah book
[25:52] of Isaiah chapter 55 familiar scripture
[25:54] and then we go over to Revelation
[25:55] chapter 10 uh 1- 7
[26:01] amen Isaiah 55 reading from verse
[26:06] 6 amen bit lengthy with the scriptures
[26:09] this morning and do apologize but uh
[26:11] there's a few things that the Lord wants
[26:13] to bring out here this morning so we'll
[26:16] just go through amen but Isaiah 6 uh
[26:19] chapter 55 and: 6 says uh uh seek ye the
[26:23] Lord while he may be found and call ye
[26:26] upon him while he is near
[26:28] let the wicked forsake his way and the
[26:30] righteous man his thoughts and let him
[26:32] return unto the Lord and He will have
[26:34] mercy upon Him unto our God for he will
[26:37] abundantly pardon for my thoughts are
[26:40] not your thoughts neither are your ways
[26:42] my ways sayeth the Lord for as the
[26:45] heavens are higher than the earth so are
[26:48] my ways higher than your ways and my
[26:51] thoughts than your thoughts for as the

[27:36] 10 from verse one talking about a little
[27:39] book says and I saw another Mighty Angel
[27:41] come down from heaven clothed with a
[27:43] cloud and a rainbow was upon his head
[27:45] and his face as it with the sun and his
[27:47] feet as pillars of fire and he had in
[27:49] his hand a little book open and he set
[27:51] his right foot upon the sea and his left
[27:54] foot upon the Earth and cried out a loud
[27:56] voice as when a lion Roy
[27:58] and when he had cried seven Thunders
[27:59] uted their voices and when the seven
[28:01] Thunders had uted their voices I was
[28:03] about to ride and I Heard a Voice from
[28:05] Heaven saying unto me seal up those
[28:07] things which the seven Thunders uttered
[28:08] and write them down and the angel which
[28:10] I saw stand upon the sea and upon the
[28:12] Earth lifted up his hand to heaven and
[28:14] swear by him that liveth forever and
[28:16] ever who created heaven and the things
[28:18] that there in are the earth and the
[28:20] things that there in are and the Sea and
[28:22] the things which are therein that they
[28:23] should be time no longer but in the days
[28:26] of the Void of the seventh angel when he
[28:30] shall begin to sound the mystery of God

[30:37] the land to receive that message HJ pray

[30:58] that right the Bible said Gross Darkness
[31:00] cover the Earth gross Darkness cover the

[31:08] darkness is spreading it's spreading in
[31:10] the homes it's spreading in schools it's
[31:12] spreading in societies it's spreading in

[32:03] the the definition of a message is
[32:06] either a verbal or written or a recorded
[32:10] communication sent to or left for a
[32:15] recipient which is a specific person so
[32:18] God in his thinking had a message to
[32:22] send to us in
[32:25] 2016 so in his mind he knew that we
[32:28] would be here in his mind he knew that
[32:31] we would have mistakes he knew we would
[32:33] fall he knew we would grel through the
[32:35] mud he knew we'd be this way and that
[32:38] but in our hearts we were to be Sons and
[32:41] Daughters of God God knew that so God
[32:44] before the beginning had a message of
[32:46] redemption God before the beginning had
[32:49] a message of light to come to this Dark
[32:52] Age oh had the prophet put a little
[32:54] sliver of Light by faith knowing that a
[32:58] message would get to a bride in Trinidad
[33:01] a bride all over the world he had a
[33:04] message predestinated for us a message

[39:59] introduction blessed be the name of the
[40:02] Lord
[40:04] woo I feel like we're hearing from
[40:07] Heaven this
[40:09] morning forms of
[40:11] communication the Bible preserved for
[40:13] thousands of years waiting for you to
[40:15] read it oh just think about it when
[40:18] Peter was reading God said this is for
[40:20] her when John was writing God said this
[40:23] is for my children in 2016 they are
[40:27] going to read the same word and it will
[40:29] be life to them and my spirit will come
[40:31] upon them and make this word that has
[40:34] been laying in this Bible for all these
[40:37] years but the devil is going to see
[40:40] another Jesus
[40:42] intr in Europe in Germany in France
[40:46] Wherever Whenever that we walk in the
[40:48] streets Satan us Mountain be
[40:52] moved
[40:54] W who is this uncircum Philistine this
[40:57] morning there is another people another
[41:01] [Applause]
[41:06] people oh wonderful
[41:10] glorious amen is his name Jesus amen
[41:14] okay give me a break here
[41:18] amen amen okay so we on fire this
[41:21] morning amen that's good amen well the
[41:24] devil is outside praise God spiritual
[41:26] meaning of a communication spiritual
[41:29] meaning of a message listen to this it's
[41:31] a
[41:32] communication in a for from a prophet or
[41:35] a preacher that is believed to be
[41:37] inspired of God isn't that right that's
[41:40] a spiritual meaning of a message that is
[41:43] sent from God isn't that right so
[41:46] throughout human history man has tried
[41:50] to communicate his messages
[41:53] communication is a very important form
[41:55] of of how we operate here on Earth isn't
[41:58] that right in his Earthly way message
[42:01] sending is very important because we
[42:04] have to be able to communicate with one
[42:05] another to be able to get our ideas
[42:07] across and to be able to get our
[42:09] opinions across and to be able to
[42:11] achieve certain objectives we have to be
[42:13] able to send a message isn't that right
[42:16] and as far as history tells us the first
[42:19] form of communication was shouting isn't
[42:21] that right so they tried to shout they
[42:24] had shouting contests I heard and the
[42:26] furthest they ever got was 100 m which
[42:29] wasn't very far so they realized that a
[42:31] more effective form of communication was
[42:34] to run with the message Hallelujah isn't
[42:37] that right so they would give a
[42:38] messenger the message and that messenger
[42:41] would have to run with the message to
[42:43] the intended destination to the intended
[42:46] target isn't that right it was more
[42:49] effective than shouting because he
[42:51] couldn't get far with shouting but if
[42:52] you sent a messenger with the message
[42:55] it'd be a more effective form of
[42:57] communication so think about it
[43:00] Hallelujah God in this in these ages
[43:02] that have gone past had Messengers who
[43:05] ran with their message in their day
[43:09] Luther ran with his message oh
[43:11] Hallelujah when he got to a certain
[43:12] place he passed his message on to Wesley
[43:16] and Wesley ran with his message and when
[43:18] Wesley ran he ran and got to a certain
[43:21] place and he passed his message on to
[43:23] Malachi 4 and he ran with a message oh
[43:27] hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah who
[43:30] do you say this is praise God I say to
[43:33] you this morning the message has got
[43:36] home oh hallelujah
[43:40] [Applause]
[43:42] hallelujah I'm told I'm told in a time
[43:45] of War my God that's before they had the
[43:48] internet young people they had these
[43:51] Messengers used to run with the message
[43:54] and sometimes a camp would be be in
[43:56] trouble the enemy would be on approach
[43:59] and they didn't have enough to take out
[44:00] the enemy so they have to send a
[44:02] messenger with a message to go for
[44:04] backup to get help for them and
[44:07] sometimes if this messenger got seen by
[44:09] the enemy they would try to take them
[44:12] out they would try to wipe them out they
[44:14] would try to kill them and that's what
[44:16] the devil's been trying to do all these
[44:19] years he's been trying to kill God's
[44:21] Messengers he's been trying to cut them
[44:23] off he's been trying to cut them off
[44:25] from getting to us because if that
[44:27] message ever got to us if we ever got to
[44:31] realize who we really are the devil was
[44:34] going to be in trouble so the devil said
[44:36] don't let them get that message the
[44:39] devil shut arrows the devil shoot at
[44:41] them oh how he try to kill them but the
[44:44] message this morning is out the secret
[44:47] is out this morning the word is in the
[44:51] pride oh hallelujah hallelujah
[44:54] hallelujah hallelujah Hall
[44:59] hallelujah
[45:01] hallelujah now they say that message
[45:03] sending or communication all right is
[45:06] based on a
[45:07] language okay so they say the sender and
[45:10] the receiver have to speak the same
[45:13] language in order for the message to be
[45:16] effective yes that's why the Tower of
[45:18] Babel was almost a success because they
[45:22] were speaking the same language isn't
[45:24] that right and they were able to
[45:26] communicate with each other and tell
[45:28] each other what the vision was and once
[45:30] they were unified on the vision then
[45:33] they began to build and even in a
[45:35] building process the communication had
[45:38] to be the same the language whatever the
[45:42] form of communication they were using
[45:43] had to be the same and everybody had to
[45:46] be on the same page in order for this
[45:48] thing to work and they were so in one
[45:51] mind that they were so in one Accord
[45:54] that it brought God to attention it
[45:57] brought God's uh alertness to the
[46:00] situation that was developing here on
[46:02] Earth with this city called Babel oh
[46:05] this Tower called Babel rather and God
[46:07] spoke and said the people are one they
[46:10] are in one mind they are in one Accord
[46:13] and they are going to achieve what they
[46:15] set up to accomplish so God changed
[46:18] language and had everybody speaking a
[46:21] different tongue and when that happened
[46:23] well we know the whole thing fell flat
[46:25] isn't that right yes now spiritually
[46:27] speaking we have to be speaking the same
[46:30] language if it is we're going to be
[46:33] unified on the vision that Malachi 4 had
[46:37] said and that Malachi 4 had promised so
[46:40] we can't be saying one thing over here
[46:42] and another thing over there and another
[46:44] interpretation over there and this one
[46:46] preaching that and this one believes
[46:48] this thing no it has to be whatever the
[46:51] prophet spoke that's what's going to
[46:54] happen word on top of word line by line
[46:58] here a little there a little until we
[47:00] all come into the unity of the faith and
[47:04] the knowledge of the Son of God into the
[47:06] measure of the stature of the perfect
[47:08] man oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[47:12] so when we say seven tunders get fate we
[47:15] are speaking the same language when we
[47:17] say seven tunders gather a bride
[47:18] together we are speaking the same
[47:20] language when we say the Holy Ghost is
[47:23] promised to be poured out upon
[47:25] individuals
[47:26] we are speaking the same language when
[47:28] we say you are going to be delivered we
[47:30] are speaking the same language when we
[47:32] say you are going to be healed we are
[47:34] speaking the same language oh
[47:37] hallelujah oh Hallelujah they were in
[47:40] the upper room and they were praising in
[47:43] God's name because they understood the
[47:45] language they were speaking the same
[47:47] thing they were in one mind they were in
[47:49] one Accord they were single Eye Single
[47:53] motive single purpose and G heard from
[47:56] Heaven they heard the sound of a rushing
[48:00] Mighty
[48:02] Wind oh hallelujah
[48:06] hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah
[48:09] praise God amen amen amen amen
[48:12] hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right
[48:16] it's like a love letter hallelujah amen
[48:19] and the sender is sending the love
[48:20] letter this man or this woman who is in
[48:23] love is sending a letter to someone else
[48:25] else who loves them back just the same
[48:29] and they are speaking a certain kind of
[48:31] language now if you and I pick up the
[48:33] letter we may not understand everything
[48:35] that they are saying there are little
[48:37] idiosyncrasies in there there are little
[48:40] there little jokes in there there are
[48:42] inside jokes in there there are things
[48:44] that you don't know about but when that
[48:46] person who shares that special
[48:49] connection with that special somebody
[48:51] when they read the letter when they pick
[48:54] up the letter of whatever it is saying
[48:57] they begin to say oh my oh wonderful oh
[49:00] how wonderful oh Hallelujah they

[57:24] time the world was so wicked evil it was
[57:26] Darkness all around
[57:28] and God had repented that he made it
[57:30] made man Hallelujah but Noah found Grace
[57:34] in God's side and Noah whispered a mess
[57:37] it was whispered a message by God saying
[57:39] that it will rain build me an ark of go
[57:42] for word Noah was the only one who
[57:45] received that message and from the time
[57:47] that that message was spoken Noah had a
[57:49] burden to build an ark as the Lord had
[57:52] said Hallelujah for 20 years he went
[57:56] with his message and he preached It Will
[57:59] Rain to a generation of people who had
[58:02] seen no rain because in those days the
[58:04] Mist Still Water the Earth like in
[58:06] Genesis so they'd never seen rain before
[58:08] they'd never seen water and for fall
[58:11] from the sky like that like rain and so
[58:12] on they' never seen that so this was a
[58:15] weird thing this was a strange thing to
[58:17] them they'd never known about this rain
[58:19] and so on and and Noah was preaching
[58:21] something at that time that was contrary
[58:23] to the people amen it was contrary that
[58:26] this rain message it will rain It Will
[58:27] Rain It Will Rain Hallelujah isn't that
[58:29] right and the people didn't know about
[58:31] this rain so they argued it they debated
[58:34] it but nevertheless it was a word from
[58:36] the Lord it was a word from God
[58:39] hallelujah it was God's word to the
[58:42] people hallelujah isn't that right isn't
[58:45] that right and it came through Noah it
[58:47] came through an unlikely vessel it came
[58:49] through an unlikely person but God
[58:52] hallelujah burd Noah with this message I
[58:55] knowah preached it in season out of
[58:57] season no matter what this one was
[58:59] saying no matter what that one was
[59:00] saying no matter how much doubt there
[59:02] was in the church he preached It Will
[59:04] Rain It Will Rain it will rain oh
[59:07] Hallelujah and one day it did rain one
[59:09] day the door was shut one day no more
[59:12] flesh could be saved one day no one his
[59:14] family was in the ark and the C
[59:17] manifested what he had spoken to them oh
[59:21] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[59:23] hallelujah isn't that right
[59:25] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah that
[59:27] was a message for that day Hallelujah
[59:30] isn't that
[59:31] right lat on down through the years God
[59:33] gave Moses a message that's right he
[59:35] said let my people go the hour of my
[59:38] Deliverance has come to the people of
[59:40] the children uh to the to the children
[59:42] of Israel down in Egypt Hallelujah isn't
[59:44] that right the time on God's watch was
[59:47] over for the bondage of the people of
[59:49] Israel down in Egypt praise God
[59:51] hallelujah they were slaving they were
[59:53] there 400 years but God had given a word
[59:56] a message to Moses to go down there and
[1:00:00] to let my people go all the time Moses
[1:00:02] is in the ordinary Moses is in his thing
[1:00:06] Moses is in his humanistic Moses is
[1:00:08] going to work and coming back home but
[1:00:10] Moses doesn't know Hallelujah that time
[1:00:13] is up for the Egyptians Moses doesn't
[1:00:15] know the same place he ran from is the
[1:00:17] same place he has to go back to
[1:00:20] Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah and God
[1:00:22] begin to cause an attraction on the
[1:00:25] mountain and when Moses said I turn
[1:00:27] aside to see what is this thing that God
[1:00:30] is calling me to Hallelujah isn't that
[1:00:33] right Hallelujah God begin to speak to
[1:00:36] Moses and say take your shoes from off

[1:01:19] Egyptians are aware the people of Israel
[1:01:21] have no hope they have no way of getting
[1:01:24] out
[1:01:25] of this slavery condition they have no
[1:01:27] way of being released from their bondage
[1:01:31] these fets and chains on their hands

[1:01:35] were big chains they were thick chains

[1:03:19] strength in his own will and power he
[1:03:21] can't do anything about those children

[1:13:58] amen and the message of the hour went
[1:14:00] forth amen isn't that right
[1:14:04] hallelujah amen oh my taking up so much
[1:14:08] time here all right well let me speed on
[1:14:11] praise God so all these prophets were in
[1:14:13] Shadow of type and the one that was to
[1:14:15] come was Jesus Christ Son of God isn't
[1:14:18] that right I'll read here from um White
[1:14:20] had to be shepherd He said now remember
[1:14:23] the Messiah was already in the city born
[1:14:25] in a city in a stable right by the great
[1:14:27] Cathedrals where the high priests and
[1:14:29] the great priests and the theologians
[1:14:31] and the wise and the trained all was
[1:14:33] there waiting for the Messiah and there
[1:14:36] he was right in their midst but why then
[1:14:40] did they go talking about those angels
[1:14:42] He said why then did they go to out to
[1:14:44] the hills of Judea to unlearned
[1:14:48] untrained uncultured poorest of all look
[1:14:53] like like the most unfit person for such
[1:14:54] a task to reveal the message and to send
[1:14:59] send them out to bring the message
[1:15:01] hallelu brandom said you know my opinion
[1:15:03] he said it might not all Mount to very
[1:15:05] much but I want to pass my opinion he
[1:15:08] said I believe it's because of the
[1:15:09] wisdom of God that he knew that they
[1:15:13] wouldn't receive such a message because
[1:15:15] of the way it come they wouldn't receive
[1:15:17] such a message he said it wasn't in the
[1:15:19] taste of their learning he said it was
[1:15:21] different it was what they had been
[1:15:24] trained to believe he would be like oh
[1:15:27] my see what human interpretations does
[1:15:31] God gives a word a messiah will come and
[1:15:33] then man put his own interpretation to
[1:15:35] it as to how this Messiah would come and
[1:15:38] they got torn off isn't that right he
[1:15:39] said it wasn't the taste of their
[1:15:40] learning it was different it wasn't the
[1:15:43] way that they had trained to believe he
[1:15:44] would be like it was contrary to their
[1:15:46] theological understanding all their
[1:15:48] training all their learning was bypass
[1:15:51] become not he said I believe it was the
[1:15:54] wisdom of God that knew that they
[1:15:56] wouldn't receive such a message he said
[1:15:59] so the Messiah was here and they must be
[1:16:01] somebody to recognize it and he knew
[1:16:05] those who hadn't been mixed up in such
[1:16:07] stuff as that he he would be more able
[1:16:10] to get his message to an unlearned group
[1:16:14] that he would be uh uh that he would be
[1:16:17] that to a mixed groupall that was so set
[1:16:19] in their ways and that nothing could
[1:16:21] turn them on not even the word of God
[1:16:24] what a condition so there's two groups
[1:16:27] there's one that Hallelujah has got
[1:16:29] their own interpretation and there's
[1:16:31] another group a group of people who are
[1:16:33] simple humble looking for God to be made
[1:16:36] manifest in their own lives they don't
[1:16:38] feel worthy of it Hallelujah but this is
[1:16:40] the people that God could use these are
[1:16:43] the people that God could find and we
[1:16:45] may not much think much of ourselves but
[1:16:47] but you are one who God was looking for
[1:16:49] all the time Hallelujah if you're too
[1:16:51] much in your head oh Hallelujah God
[1:16:54] can't use you if you're too much in your
[1:16:56] own human reasoning God can't use you if
[1:16:58] you're too much in your own educations
[1:17:00] and in your own learnings and what you
[1:17:02] think and how you feel God can't use you
[1:17:05] but it's down in the heart a genuine
[1:17:07] desire for God a humble simple praise
[1:17:11] God recognition of God we need God in
[1:17:14] our lives and we're not ashamed of it
[1:17:17] praise God we're not ashamed to admit
[1:17:19] that we need God more and more we're not
[1:17:21] ashamed to admit that we need him
[1:17:24] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:17:26] hallelujah oh I'm not ashamed to admit
[1:17:29] that I need God this morning how many
[1:17:31] feel the same way this morning we need
[1:17:34] the Holy Spirit we need the power to
[1:17:37] make it in this hour oh Hallelujah see
[1:17:41] that was the wisdom of God cuz the
[1:17:43] wisdom of God is the foolishness of man
[1:17:45] and the foolishness of God is man's
[1:17:47] Wisdom isn't that right he knew they
[1:17:49] wouldn't receive such a message so the
[1:17:50] Messiah was here and it must have been
[1:17:52] someone but to recognize it now he says
[1:17:55] and now Christian F he let me ask this
[1:17:57] question With all sincerity and love he
[1:17:59] said I wonder if he would make the same
[1:18:01] act tonight and send us in this
[1:18:04] generation the promised word that's
[1:18:06] promised for this generation I wonder if
[1:18:09] our the theologians and Educators and
[1:18:11] wise would turn the message down just
[1:18:14] the same as they did then he said man
[1:18:16] doesn't change neither does God's word
[1:18:19] change he's the unchanging God he
[1:18:21] doesn't change isn't that right he said
[1:18:24] I wonder if God's doing the same thing
[1:18:26] today and he has God sent a humble
[1:18:29] little Prophet 20th century Prophet
[1:18:32] isn't that right to bring his word to 5
[1:18:35] foot something not a very powerful man
[1:18:37] but God was with him God spoke through
[1:18:40] him every miracle was of God every word
[1:18:44] he spoke never fell to the ground every
[1:18:47] prophecy even to this day hallelujah
[1:18:50] hallelujah has never failed God isn't
[1:18:54] that right the prophet said not one word
[1:18:56] has ever fall to the ground and if God
[1:18:58] promised us the holy ghost that word
[1:19:01] cannot fall to the ground if God
[1:19:03] promised to deliver us that word cannot
[1:19:06] fall to the ground that's why we preach
[1:19:09] this word that's why we stay with this
[1:19:11] word that's why we stand with this word
[1:19:14] this word cannot fall to the ground it
[1:19:17] must come to pass in its time and in its
[1:19:20] season oh oh hallelujah hallelujah my
[1:19:25] word shall not return void but it shall
[1:19:27] accomplish isn't that right he said
[1:19:30] notice Angels coming amen Angels coming
[1:19:33] and giving their message to a man of
[1:19:36] such low estate where there were men
[1:19:39] much more Earthly thought of qualified
[1:19:43] than these poor illiterate Shepherds he
[1:19:45] said the shepherd was the most
[1:19:46] illiterate of anybody he didn't know
[1:19:48] nothing but just uh about his sheep he
[1:19:51] didn't know mathematics he didn't know
[1:19:53] how to split an atom he didn't need no
[1:19:55] scholarship he just had to know about
[1:19:57] his sheep that's all that he needed to
[1:19:59] know and God the great wisdom and
[1:20:02] Fountain of resource of all wisdom would
[1:20:05] choose such a person as that or persons
[1:20:08] rather and bypass all the well- trained
[1:20:10] Scholars that's trained to know that he
[1:20:13] said it speaks of one thing he said they
[1:20:15] were trained in the wrong field he said
[1:20:18] they passed up all the importance of the
[1:20:19] Land There were important people great
[1:20:22] teachers cus the high priest many other
[1:20:24] men all of Israel's Mighty learned all
[1:20:26] the denominations boasting of their
[1:20:29] theologians and so forth God bypassed
[1:20:31] every one of them he said now that's
[1:20:34] God's wisdom oh Hallelujah just think
[1:20:37] about it there are many nice people in
[1:20:40] this world there's wonderful people
[1:20:42] there's goodly people if I look around
[1:20:44] and look for nice people and think about
[1:20:46] myself in that context I wouldn't have
[1:20:48] stand a chance maybe I've made too much
[1:20:50] mistakes there's people who never spit
[1:20:52] on a sidewalk there's wonderful people
[1:20:55] people who get moral standards people
[1:20:57] who have nice families and yet God in
[1:21:00] his wisdom choose me to speak his word
[1:21:04] to God in his wisdom choose you if God
[1:21:08] is looking for nice people I might lose
[1:21:10] that contest if God is looking for
[1:21:12] goodly people I might lose that contest
[1:21:14] if God is looking for Bly people I might
[1:21:17] lose that contest but God bypass the
[1:21:19] great God bypass the mighty and God come
[1:21:23] to Humble little people oh hallelujah
[1:21:26] hallelujah that he could speak his word
[1:21:29] too oh Hal God look for Shepherds oh
[1:21:32] hallelujah hallelujah praise God amen
[1:21:35] amen amen amen oh isn't that
[1:21:39] right amen David was a Shepherd all
[1:21:42] David know about is keeping the Sheep
[1:21:44] his brothers was the one train for the
[1:21:46] Army his brothers was around writing
[1:21:48] quantum mechanics and trying to get
[1:21:50] their papers so they could apply for the
[1:21:52] Army and so on David wasn't in that
[1:21:54] realm David was still young in it David
[1:21:56] was a Shepherd boy playing his little
[1:21:58] hop Hallelujah but God was speaking a
[1:22:00] message to Samuel and says Samuel I have
[1:22:04] somebody I want to anoint he never tell
[1:22:06] him who he never tell him how praise God
[1:22:08] he just tell him go down and make a
[1:22:10] sacrifice and I will send you the one
[1:22:13] don't you worry I'll give you a witness
[1:22:15] I'll give you a witness of that King
[1:22:17] that is to be king over Israel
[1:22:19] Hallelujah and Samuel go down there he
[1:22:22] have no who it is he just know he have
[1:22:24] to anoint somebody so he come with his
[1:22:26] horn of oil and he's looking for a
[1:22:28] witness in the house of Jesse isn't that
[1:22:30] right he bypassed this one he bypassed
[1:22:33] that one he bypassed that one and God
[1:22:36] said don't look at the outward
[1:22:37] appearance God literally told him don't
[1:22:39] look at the outside God look tell him
[1:22:42] look at the heart God is looking at that
[1:22:44] outside appearance God looking at how
[1:22:46] big how tall how strong how how short
[1:22:49] praise God no no that has nothing to do
[1:22:50] with it but God predestined inated a
[1:22:53] little Shepherd boy to be king over
[1:22:56] Israel that was God's choosing that was
[1:22:59] according to the good pleasure of his
[1:23:01] own will in other words it give God a
[1:23:04] smile to choose David it made God smile
[1:23:07] in his heart to choose David to be king
[1:23:10] and it made God smile to choose you in
[1:23:14] 2016 it was according to the good
[1:23:16] pleasure of his will oh it made God
[1:23:20] happy to choose you because he knew you

[1:23:49] could do more Hallelujah when you have
[1:23:51] all these num numbers it can't prove God
[1:23:54] it doesn't prove God's faith God had to
[1:23:56] cut down the numbers so throughout the
[1:23:58] years that what he was doing some fell
[1:24:00] upon Wayside some fell upon Stony some
[1:24:03] fell upon thorns and God was cutting
[1:24:05] down the numbers until he could get to
[1:24:07] that good ground that good ground that

[1:26:18] year was come they went a priest out and
[1:26:20] sounded a trumpet and that trumpet
[1:26:23] denoted to every slave no matter how
[1:26:25] long he had been serving or how longer
[1:26:27] he had to serve he said when that
[1:26:29] trumpet sounded that slave was made free
[1:26:33] he could lay down the hole and go home
[1:26:34] to his children he didn't have to work
[1:26:37] any longer because he was free when the
[1:26:40] Jubilee sounded he said that trumpet
[1:26:42] gave not an uncertain sound but it gave
[1:26:45] a certain sound he said and that man
[1:26:47] could lay down his instrument and go
[1:26:50] home free from slavery he said and this
[1:26:53] morning the Bible said that if the
[1:26:55] trumpets give an un certain sound who
[1:26:57] will know what to do he said and if the
