singing praise God and we thank God to be in the house of the Lord one more time amen so listen to our Bibles now we certainly don't want to uh stay too long amen unnecessarily but uh praise God as we switch over now scripture I want to read from tonight just a small thought here um I pray to be a blessing to you amen Genesis chapter 1 I want to read from Genesis 1 Ecclesiastes chapter 3 and we also want to read from Acts chapter 1 and verse 7 and 8. Okay so Genesis chapter 1 and verse 14. so this is how God is creating the world and so on like that he says in 114 and God said let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years amen now over to Ecclesiastes chapter 3 you want to read from verse one and it says to everything there is a season and a Time to every purpose under the heaven a time to be born and a time to die a time to plant a time to pluck up that which is planted a time to heal our time to kill and a time to heal a time to break down and a time to build up a time to weep and a time to laugh a time to mourn and a time to dance a time to Cast Away stones and a time to gather Stones together a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing a time to get in a time to lose a time to keep and a time to Cast Away time to render the time to sow a time to keep silence and a time to speak a time to love and a time to hate a time of War and a time of peace and now turn over to Acts chapter 1 and verse 7. our last scripture here it says and he said unto them it is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father had put in his own power but ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you and ye shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and on all Judea and in Samaria and into the uttermost parts part of the earth may God a blessing to the Ring of his word let's just bow our heads one more time all gracious Heavenly Father Lord we certainly demon a privilege and honor to come into your house tonight Lord Lord we know that you have called us Lord father lower out of lower out of the chaos of this world on you've called our hearts oh God far to peace Lord if we call our souls utter destruction oh God further Lord enter your Marvelous Light and so we thank you for your call upon our lives and so father we come into this place to hear from you tonight and Lord I come to Just Surrender now father to your will and to your way tonight have you perfect we may speak to the hearts of the people tonight Lord in a special way Lord father May anoint us and Inspire us Lord father May appoint your spirit Upon Us Lord and bless us Lord father as we look to your scriptures Lord as we fix our eyes upon you Lord and as we turn our attention Lord father to what is drawing us tonight Lord we pray to the Holy Spirit Come on minister to each heart and life although May no one leave the same way they come but Lord made even those on the internet Lord may we hear a word from the Lord tonight that would Inspire us Lord that would anoint us our fresh Lord Lord I will give us a fresh unction tonight granted Almighty Lord God we pray and ask these things now we pray for your preeminence and your total presence Lord and control tonight in Jesus name amen and amen praise God you ever have your seats tonight Hallelujah Glory praise God okay well we love the Lord and uh praise God we thank God for his presence amen so I have a thought tonight praise God and to Endeavor in the scripture for a few moments I have a title my title is times and seasons amen that's my title tonight times and Seasons praise God there's a time for everything under the heaven there's a time for everything on the earth and God is the one who is in charge of the times and the seasons because when Jesus was getting ready to ascend praise God is not right and leave his disciples for a while he spoken to them saying the Holy Spirit we're surely going to come upon you and they were asking you know when will be this kingdom of God common when is things going to happen and things gonna take place according to prophecy and Jesus answered to them was saying that you it's not for you to know the times all the seasons which the father had put in his own power but you are gonna receive power praise God after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you and you shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem so in other words he's telling them that praise God our times and seasons and dispensations are all in the hand of God but he said also tell her when your season come around you have to be looking for one thing you have to be looking for the power oh Hallelujah because there's gonna come a season for the power oh Hallelujah and that's what you've got to have your eyes fixed on oh hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right so God loves to stretch things out in time I praise God I notice that more and more as you read the scriptures you study it and as you look at the testimony of God's servants lives throughout the ages and how God deal with his sons how God deal with his men with his daughters throughout eons of time you could see that he always stretched things out in time that time proves all things time proves that the word of God is faithful time proves that the word of God is true though the journey is long though your mind get weary though your heart get weary and though people get a use of things and people get disenchanted and some might walk away all is not right but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength we're living in a time when young men even young men shall faint and utterly fall but I say they that wait tonight upon the Lord shall renew their strengths they shall run and not be wary they're gonna walk and not faint oh Hallelujah so tonight we've got to be taught how to wait until our time comes until our Seasons come because when your season come there's nothing the devil could do about your season there's nothing the devil could do about your time when the time has come for you to be liberated when the time has come for the change to break when the time comes for the captive to be set free when the time comes for the sick to be here for the dumb to speak for the blind to see for the to walk when that time comes there's nothing anybody can do about it because times and Seasons oh it's in the father's hand or can it get amen tonight oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God glory to God amen and so in Genesis we read that God said let there be lights in the filming of the heaven to divide the day from the night and let them be foresights and for seasons and for days and for years praise God isn't that right so these seasons will be declared even from the beginning from a Heavenly Herald a man was declaring the signs and the seasons upon the Earth isn't that right before God do anything on the earth he always declares it in the heavens praise God because we know that there's three Bibles isn't that right there's a zodiac the written bible and that permit Bible amen amen which is Christ into the hope of glory praise God but since the beginning when he established this star consolation this zodiac praise God it declared times and Seasons amen so you know rain is coming you know sun is coming you know winter and fall and all these things praise God because it's tied in praise God to what God has established from since the beginning it's not right glory to God and we don't have as much seasons as they have in temperate zones or in temperate climates isn't that right like the Autumn and the fall and the winter and so forth like that praise God we just have rainy and sunny season most of the time amen praise God but right now we're in a season when the nights are cold and we feel quite comfortable at night but it's gonna come a time when the nights are hot and he breatheses hot and he found no help and they need a AC because the season has changed oh Hallelujah isn't that right hey you feel the difference praise God even the wood gets affected your door something I can't open because pretty good the season has changed things are changing around you oh Hallelujah and God is in charge of all of that because when God is getting ready to do something he gets ready he announces a new season because because we're not seasoned and announce something begin to take place there are things you cannot help in a new season there are things you cannot help but from coming forth when it's a Time on the season for it oh when it's a time of sowing you have to sow the seed it's a labor of time oh it's labor in an opinion you don't see no evidence you don't you know so I see today and see the fruit tomorrow no oh you just had to keep sowing by faith you keep sowing seeds by faith to keep sowing seeds hoping someday knowing her and Fates in the sea that you have sown or that it will comfort in his time and in its season oh Hallelujah can't worry about the Dark Skies you can't worry about the sunny skies you just got to sow your seed oh Hallelujah and that's what Jesus when he was here he's the sower of the seed oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah is not right out of his mouth oh Hallelujah God was speaking let there be let there be Andrew come Philip come he was drawing all men unto himself oh Hallelujah he kept telling them that the son of man gonna be offered up unto the hands of sinful man and in three days he's gonna raise up again they couldn't understand it but he had to sow that seed because when the time come around he was going to fulfill what he spoke to them destroy this party destroy this Temple and in three days I'll raise it up myself oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah God is able to sow a seed and to see it manifest God is sowing a seed how he's been sowing a seed all the time line up online word upon word oh here a little they're little he's been so in season you all these years God is faithful tonight to bring every one of those seeds that he has sown to pass oh come on I can hear you every seat he sown through Malachi 4's message he said let there be a bride she's gonna be Hallelujah the word hallelujah undefiled unadulterated he saw a vision of her matching and step oh Hallelujah saw you coming forth that sea cannot fall to the ground no wonder he said I'm jealous about the seed I have planted because the Holy Ghost the season of the Holy Ghost the season of the fire of God the season of the rain it's getting ready to fall upon those same words upon those same planted seeds of the words of the son of man Hallelujah Hallelujah what are we saying hallelujah what are we saying a season of anointing is coming a season of fires coming a season about power a season of authority a season of angelic visitation a season of fire a season of presence a season of the pillar of fire moving In and Out Among Us it'll be caught failing his people God is getting ready I believe tonight he's getting ready to declare a new season don't you feel the wind shropping don't you feel the temperature rising don't you feel suddenly taking place those Heavens are declaring the glory of God oh they know that the son of man is coming back [Music] Hallelujah things are changing oh as the world got worse as the world got worse in their condition the bride is getting stronger and stronger she's teasing on a hidden manner from under that seventh seal she knows that there's a spirit out there somewhere she knows that there's a holy ghost she knows that there's an angel she knows that there's a presence she knows that there's a fire she knows that this word cannot fall to the crown she knows the devil is a liar she feels it out there somewhere she's waiting for her spirit to come to her and manifest the word in her season Oh Glory to God oh hallelujah praise God Amen oh I feel good tonight oh Hallelujah hallelujah oh set me free glory to God hallelujah hallelujah amen amen yes whoa Gloria God hallelujah oh fire falling time so come on I feel it now so before the season come on what do we hold on to we hold on to the word because the wood is going to clear the season and your revelation of your faith is what helps you stand until your season comes oh hallelujah oh my Hallelujah Grace I don't know if you get me oh my oh my God put something in your heart tonight that is how you come all this way 50 plus years in this message people fall as high people falling away inside remember Andy people fall on the left people are falling all right but God put an anchor in you God put a faith in you Hallelujah that faith is what creeps the solid rock and that rock is Jesus the revelation of Jesus Christ to his church oh hallelujah hallelujah are the seven voices of the seven Church Ages which are seven manifestations of one Holy Spirit into the church as fatal their voice virtually voice knowledge all the voice tempering voice patience to live voice godliness to live voice probably kindness for their voice seven voices that conquer the devil in every age and God's Gonna wrap all seven voices in a bride on the earth she will have to save the Lord or keep himself blow a trumpet tonight oh give him praise Hallelujah amen oh Hallelujah [Applause] seven Thunders revelation but when that season comes manifestation of those same Seven Little Voices oh Hallelujah then there'll be a group somewhere not even written doesn't be made manifest oh holiday come from flying all around oh Hallelujah oh gotta be a bride on the Earth not necessarily a church a group but a bride with individuals baptized into it displaying these virtues displaying this pyramid it'll be on the Earth again that permit is going to walk in you that pyramid is gonna talk in you that permit is going to arrest your spirits it's gonna kill your human spirits and out of your mouth will come love I'll become mother come forgiveness out of your mother come heal it with brother kindness patience Temperance knowledge fruits of the spirit love joy peace long suffering or gentleness meekness kindness not your kindness but the kindness of Jesus Christ Express brotherly kindness Spirit of forgiveness or the blood of the age upon your chest nothing against her nothing against Joseph that's God working his way out working his way out fighting pressing every day getting those virtues attaining Christ in you the hope of glory amen that's a revelation and that's what we've been holding on to all these years and that Revelation gave us put us on fire knowing that it's gonna come one of these days amen and those someday I feel like you're on the cross and they say come down from the cross huh you say you got it no I've got it to get praise God I'm fighting Hallelujah I'm looking to see myself die out on the cross Hallelujah I could come down from of the cross and carry that cross Hallelujah pick up your cross and follow Jesus every day Hallelujah walking with him walking in price Christ's bloody footprints amen because we need a bride can truly do that walk in Christ body Footprints that's what you're called to do amen no Perfection to bring on the resurrection that's what you're called to do amen so it's a high call and there's a season to come around to make that happen there's nothing we can do in ourselves but God gave us Faith a revelation of what he spoke praise God I know it seemed like he gone away pray for a season he's gonna come back around again and fulfill what he said fulfill what he spoke fulfill what he promised oh hallelujah hallelujah that's the message praise God Amen Hallelujah not books and tapes the gospel is not in just a word only but it's in power and demonstration of the spirits picking up the Hallelujah picking up those lame praise God making them walk causing the blind to see raising up the Dead the gospel preacher has power that's a real gospel when you can speak it and then prove it on the spots somebody fall dead in the service speaking to life again and keep on preaching the world Hallelujah that's what they had back there and that's what they're gonna happen this last day Hallelujah oh my let me read some quotes here praise God you want some evidence all right uh we're talking about the Zodiac right so the prophet said in a message shalom 1964 he said now even in the Zodiac I'm going to go back and teach zodiac but I'm just showing you in the heavens declared he said in the Zodiac we find out in the consolation of stars that he declared the whole Bible in the consolation of the zodiac amen so everything is in there praise God no one that he told Abraham come outside your tent and look up at the stars so shall I see it be it wasn't just a light thing but all that God promised all that God spoke was in the heavens he had already set it Hallelujah Thy word is settled in the heavens forever oh how you can't argue with that and a prophet of God God gave us a prophet in this last day to leave Earthly Realms and to go up into the heavens and to pick up the word for all day and then come down and speak it therefore seven Thunders it's not a man's message but that's God's message to the people that's called Divine promise and by these divinely revealed mystery truths it's going to literally turn our hearts back to the faith of the fathers oh Hallelujah back to the apostolic fate back to what they had back there oh hello signs wonders Miracles a church sell us for the things of God oh had it proven the word preaching the gospel every every creature to every man such as would be safe that's what I had back there and God's gonna have such a church again oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Hallelujah Oh Glory to God Prophet went up pull down the Eternal Word come no hands poke it and that's what we have on books and tips praise God that's why we gotta stay with a message saying what the tape say because Rapture and Faith lean in them same tapes after a while he said she'll find where it is written after a while she'll find her message for her day and tonight we can recognize our message for our day we know who we have believed we have not believed cunningly devise fables this is not a Nancy story This is Gospel truths oh hello and we are fully persuaded tonight that neither debts Nor Hell No persecution could ever separate us from the love of God we are persuaded tonight fully persuaded by all fits by the revelation of Jesus Christ to the Church of God hallelujah in this last day Who We Are Who God is and who the devil is we want our Mountain we want our inheritance we want the baptism of the Holy Ghost oh glory to God give him a shout of praise you can't teach us out of it you can't distract us out of it you can't tell us away from it it's in our hearts it's in our hearts hallelujah holy as it was in my heart Caleb said in my heart I holy follow the Lord my God oh when others walked away when others God weary we're not as fainted I holy follow the Lord my God now therefore give me my Mountain God knows I was faithful now he's gonna be faithful to the promise that he made oh Hallelujah come on now don't get weary Saints keep on pressing keep on praying keep on worshiping stay in the spirit the devil's job is to pull you into the natural and to try to beat you and beat you over the head with your faults and your mistake and your ideas but you tell the devil tonight my time and my season is coming my season of adoption my season of the Holy Ghost my season of healing my season of Deliverance no crippled people it's going in the Rapture your healing is coming your deliverance is coming what you struggling with now when the season comes your struggle will be over the devil will be defeated defeated he'll be bound a thousand years oh Hallelujah totally defeated you know what a torturous thing that is double bone for a thousand years meaning I'm nothing to use nobody to use that's the worst kind of Torment you are alive and you're miserable because you have nothing to do no more trouble to cause no more pain to inflict no more torments no more sorrow you're bound by that chain of circumstance he's got to walk around aimlessly praise God my my my my but that's not for you amen the devil hates the Book of Revelation he hates the Book of Genesis because it shows his beginning and it shows his end hello but you don't have a beginning and you never had an ending because you come from God oh there's an eternal part of you tonight that is what helped you stand all these years oh that's what you connected with when the true word of God was preached to you that mystery in you connected with that praise God and said this is the truth this is true amen I believe the words that are spoken the prophecy are the sins of this book and I believe that the time is at hand oh how do you play declares it hey you may not see it yet but your faith is declaring things that aren't as though they were that's what faith is praise is the evidence of the things you can't see oh Hallelujah that's why someone with faith is so confusing to the world that's why someone had faith is so confused into the church World praise God to the carnal believer because they cannot understand how after all these years with no visible evidence of God or anything like that matter and a manifestation you could still believe or even when things get dark even and it feel like things are silent even the things that feel like not moving you still have faith oh things may not be moving oh Hallelujah I might see God but the devil cannot move me because I'm Standing on the Promises I'm Standing on the Promises I'm standing on his word oh Hallelujah glory to God oh my in the Zodiac we find out consolation of the Stars he declares the whole Bible in the constellation and here we find out he starts off the very first figure in the Zodiac as a virgin he said the last figure is Leo the liar showing that Jesus would come first to the Earth by a virgin perfect amen and then he'll come the second time as the lion of the tribe of Judah see he goes through the cross fishes amen just before that cancer age he said and that's what we're living in now reveal age isn't that right where he's revealing himself in the time the revelation of things being made known praise God that's the age you live in an hour and all the heavens declare him see the Bible says so all right praise God so you talk about three miles right amen and God's words are declare the season amen just like the Zodiac declare the season upon you it isn't that right the word of God declares the season that is coming upon you praise God so amen so all a while until your time and season come pray God you are

but he's trying you until his word came the word of the Lord tried Joseph the same word that Joseph received Joseph had a dream knew he was supposed to come into power and imagine Joseph sitting in prison thinking about a dream that he had a long time ago oh God was gonna bring him bringing uh his brother to Bobby for him isn't that right how is this going to be how is this gonna happen bring her yeah testified of it oh it was sweet an amount when it first came to him it was bitten in a belly whenever suffered a reproach oh Hallelujah and there he was in prison waiting for his time and his season to come oh I could only imagine how Joseph felt Joseph knew he had potential but he had to sit there and wait Joseph knew he was educated but he had to sit there and wait Joseph knew he had experience but he had to sit there and wage until his time and season come his bed grouched his clothes got raggy he was looking dirty every day he looking more and more not like the vision but do it Terry wait for it it shall surely come to pass it shall not carry when it comes Hallelujah oh my God the other day I was outside just thinking about it I see Joseph must have felt a kind of hoe you know he tried to make things happen he tried to make it work he had a dream a gift a dream and he saw two men trouble in jail one time come to bring them food he said what's trouble in here the butler told his dream it's not right and the baker told his dream and Joseph interpreted it the gift was still working he still had the blessing upon him they had taken the court away and they rip it and they put an animal's blood and they tell if I lie about how he was dead and his father believed he was dead for a long time and he was still alive he was just waiting for his season to come around well but he was there waiting then the silence stairway seemed like nobody cared about him nowhere seemed like nobody know his name anymore he is dead to his family praise God as far as his brothers are concerned he's lost somewhere praise God we don't know where he is hallelujah they just they stole him away he prayed they don't know where he was going to go it's not praise but they won't do it concerned because they had hatred in her isn't that right and there was Joseph and God set up the scene just right perfectly rejected nowhere for him to turn he's in prison his hands are bound by circumstance he sent all the resumes and he blacklisted because he's a prisoner and he can't get any other job he can't go anywhere else and do any other thing but where God have him right there where he have him right there he can't make a move until God says so and that's how God have you tonight he set up your circumstance where you cannot turn to the left you can't turn to the right the only way he could do is turn your eyes towards a temple say God if you could still hear me I might be in the belly of a whale you might feel like Jonah tonight but turn your face towards his holy Temple and remind him of his promise to you remind him of his word to you oh he will not forsake the works of his own hands oh Hallelujah even though Joseph couldn't see him God was still with him even though he felt like he couldn't hear from God the devil couldn't move him he was just there waiting what a condition to be in Italian Butler listen when he got your post because I know you're gonna get it he dreamed no fall they dream no failed they don't lie the gift don't lie still working all that time God don't give us give and take it away always there in the prison and power doesn't matter where you are what blessing God put upon you is blessing is blessed well God blesses bless oh what God anointed is Anointed when God anointed David you feel he didn't know David was going to go through all kind of Madness praise God running around running failed for his life and so forth like that he had to play mat to get away from some of them praise isn't that right Hallelujah but God's blessing was still upon David God was just getting him ready for his throne all his taught us training him out there in hardship in trial and pain in torment though he can't see nothing though it's dark everywhere he can't see his hand in front of him he hiding in deserts and in caves and in dense but he always feared the Lord he always had a love for the courts of God and he always do the glove of God was set upon him because since the time when Samuel anointed him with that oil the anointing was upon David wherever David went the anointing followed him he was already anointed to be king and you tonight you have an anointing upon you you have a presence upon your life the Devils could see it the angels can see it it is what followed you you might have walked away but that presence was

said yeah no notice the angel of God will perform his word he will bring his word to pass regardless he said the prophet said when the season comes Harvesters are ripe and God is going to send his word and perform his things he said and today listen he said I believe we're listening that God is going to call our people out of the Gentiles for his name in this great latter movement here of a Revival sweeping the nation oh he has prophecy tonight amen he said and if the holy Holiness people don't want it he will raise it up out of something else he said that's right it's got to be if the people in this message don't want it he's going to raise it up out of something else if these These are pretty old lagers praise God want to hang around and just wait for something to happen or praise God or or just kind of occupy space then he's going to raise up a group of young people who want to take their Mountain who want to take their land they're going to go back to Egypt but brother we come out all this way we're going to have the rest of the way pray we're gonna cut you devils if we have to we're willing to give our lives if we have to but this is a promise that God made to us and we are just as strong as when we first started out because we have another spirit with us that has given us power giving us unction from above yet he often he given you a charge saying come on pray

your destination oh my all right when the season comes around right so he said offices are ripe okay so stevenage okay and if the holy holiest I wanted he'll raise up it out of something else that's right it's got to be it's got to come He's Able of these stones to rise children unto Abraham Prophet said he said what's the matter he said we've let down the bars amen the bar is restraining right compromise with compromising you've let down the bus kept the devil out amen the boss that kept interpretation out the Bowser kept men's ideas out we've let it down see he said prophesied compromising that's what Let It Down and all Minister used to sing he said we let down the bars we compromise with sin we let down the bars the Sheep go out how did the goats get in he said because you let down the bus Prophet said that's what it is he said let down on the word he said we're getting stiff on starchy afraid to come back to the old-fashioned gospel that's right worship and praise and shouting isn't that right Hollow preach and praying that old salvation that makes you clean up fix up he said that's right make it right and come before God oh that's the approach we need tonight amen every service clean up come before God get fixed up put all your hearts away Hallelujah put away your whole sin praise God Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus Hallelujah set your affection on things above oh Hallelujah so what's happened that's what we need tonight praise God make it right he said come before God that's what the matter with the church today Prophet said we need a Revival he said we do not need a new Seminary we don't need new preachers we don't need a new church building what we need is a Revival in what we caught he said that's what it is stirring up amen praise God he said all right amen he said I'm not amen and myself he said amen means so be itch so he's not even in you you're not amen and me you know Amen in the word praise God Amen what he said amen amen means so be it and he said and I believe it with all my heart hey do you believe that's what might be Mighty strong for a Baptist but that's right he said true he said I'm a Pentecostal Baptist he said I got the Holy Ghost since I've been a Baptist the prophet praise God he finds it here he said that's right he said notice it cleans up sets aside and makes a different person a new creature in Christ Jesus amen what does that the Holy Ghost it cleans you up sets you aside makes you a different person a new creature in Christ Jesus oh he said here is what we need oh Hallelujah is that what you need tonight is that what we're looking for looking for the Holy Ghost back in the church oh the Holy Ghost so bring reverence the main humility to bring respects Prophet actually said there's going to be another anunia sense of fire and a few of them when that church begins to get back into his mighty power isn't that right and what happened there the Holy Ghost took up residence in the heart of Peter isn't that right come in the church lying bring in something falsely telling them this is all the money pray he's gone it's not right and it wasn't praise God and and and and no matter what Grouse they had with Peter I don't know what relationship they had in the Earthly sense but they should have at least had enough respect to respect that man's office to respect the office that he held but they didn't understand the season they were in they didn't understand the time that they were in it wasn't a time for playing games it was not time for hiding and showing a false report wasn't a season for that the season had changed oh that is not right but they clearly were out of it because they lacked the respects the humility it took to approach that man of God despite how they knew him everybody know he's a fisherman he used to be this thing whatever it's not right in the Earthly sense praise God but forget about what he is in the Earthly sense when that season changed you got to recognize God's man on the earth identified by anointing my manifestation praise God by power praise God the prophet said if you can't respect the man respect the office he holds it's not right and they're coming there with disrespect lying to the Holy Ghost because Peter said you didn't lie to me you lied to the one who sits on the throne in the Shell of a body you're seeing there's a holy spirit sitting in the throne and because you come in here lying they've got got cut off isn't that right and the prophet said that will repeat again so we got to get our minds in our gear we gotta get get to practice in this presence of God and that's what it really means humility respects being humble before God forgiveness brotherly kindness having the right attitude towards one another not knowing maybe you might be entertaining Angels unawares you don't know you just got to have respects however you just got to have humility come with the right approach and God will bless you pray for your for your approach amen praise God and God's gonna try it so all of this been trial trial coming all these through these years what he's been doing trying to prove the word in you get you in a certain mind for it and a certain gear praise God said and that which is perfect is come because that's what you're in part will be done away with at that time praise God Amen we come into Perfection praise God it takes a certain mode a certain reality to bring that and gods have been trying to bring that to us all through the years praise God but he's going to manifest it praise God but you've got to have it inside David said Thy word O Lord have I hid in my heart said I might not sin against you hey hide a word in your heart tonight amen amen praise God hallelujah stay with that word amen oh my let's practice the presence of God amen I've loved one for another and in so much you love God Amen when you love each other amen is that right all right let me look to close out here times so far spent amen um he said cleans up set aside right then he doubted it too okay musician can get ready he said anything to do but God's Gonna confirm his word don't you worry God is able of these stones to rise up children to Abraham he said John watch then all of that then in all of that what taken place God was sure to bring it to pass because it was the season and the time it was at the season and it was at the time it's not right he said his words every Cog must fit in the same place with them prophetic Wheels to begin to roll together then it's got to happen oh so what has he been doing all these years getting the cogs in the right place in Christ when that prophetic will goes to Rolling together oh because brother may not be here but that prophecy Still Remains the Same what he said will come to pass so when those Wheels began to roll together every man could take his place in the body of Christ isn't that right amen amen it's got to happen the prophet saying when it starts moving and there is the coming of time prophecy see when right now he said in the near future he said that when that great judgment is going to come upon these nations that forget God America and all these things here isn't that right when you get put up with when when you put up with what I've seen the last few days seen around the country out in the name of religion living the way people are living He said no wonder communistic things breaking out and things are the way they are he said that the Bible teaches that's right he said we're letting down we're compromising but God's gonna have a remnant of people our Blood Washed Church Without spot or wrinkled he said amen I believe it with all my heart amen for the vision is yet for an appointed time but in the end it shall speak and not lie though Atari wait for it it shall surely come to pass Revelation 21 5-6 he says on he said that sat upon the throne said behold I make all things new and he said unto me right for these words are true and faithful and he said unto me it is done I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end and I will give to him that is a thirst of the Fountain of the Water of Life freely amen and amen and amen amen hallelujah there's a few more in this quote here praise God and I'll begin to wrap up oh okay since I'm 14 7 just a few more scriptures here even the spirit of truth of the world cannot receive because it's hit him no more neither anoint him but ye know him for he dwelt with you and shall be in you Jesus said I love you comfortless I will come to you and yet a little while in the world see me no more but you see me and because you live because I live you shall live also this day well Faith declares it praise God you shall know that I'm in the father ye and me and I and you praise God isn't that right Hallelujah okay spoken with Original Seed amen he says do believe he said why is this has been do you have a better understanding now he said it's the words friends this has been about six hours right close to it five you can play something Softly five and a half or six hours he said there's much more could be but surely the Holy Spirit by this time has sunk it deep into you that you know what I'm talking about he said we're at the end time he said the seeds are sold now the latter rain is fixing to come forward he said remember there will be such a denominational Gathering pretty soon it'll be terrific and they'll bring themselves together into this Federation of churches and then this kind of a church will be put out of operation as far as they know it's at that time that Jesus will appear and he will show which is bride and which is not he said and remember Christian friends I'm a man I can make mistakes but God being God cannot make a mistake so all the words that's been written must be fulfilled Jesus said so amen he said we've got things here in the scripture that must be fulfilled and this is one of the things he said this boycott has to come he said but before this boycott can come of the marking of the Beast there has to be a seed sown for God to take a church out of it he said you understand now the congregation says amen he said a seed has to be sowed and they'll make a form of the image into the Beast the Church of the room we said but there has to be a true bride and we understand that that's so combine is to be rejected amen and amen do you believe it tonight oh Hallelujah let's all stand praise God I'm finished oh hallelujah hallelujah the seed is already sown oh Hallelujah on a season of Revival season of harvest is coming
