[45:31] your mercy we don't have enough tongues
[45:34] to praise you for waking us up this
[45:36] morning and giving us health and
[45:38] strength that we could thank you and
[45:40] worship you in the last days of the last
[45:43] days that's like that's like that's why
[45:46] I like the phrase it the last days of
[45:48] the last days father we thank you for
[45:51] sending us evening light for sending us
[45:53] this end time message that we can know
[45:55] where to place our feet in this hour
[45:57] Lord the prophet prophesy about rough
[45:59] times ahead and we feel it in spirit and
[46:02] we know there are tougher times ahead
[46:04] but we come here to be edified to be
[46:06] strengthened to be built up in Jesus
[46:08] name we ask it amen amen just before I
[46:10] take a seats just want to read one
[46:12] scripture I read two scriptures from
[46:14] Colossians chapter 3:17 whatsoever you
[46:17] do in word or deed do all in the name of
[46:19] the Lord Jesus giving thanks to God and
[46:21] the father by him and from 1 Corinthians
[46:24] chapter 10 verse 31 and 32
[46:28] says whether therefore you eat or drink
[46:32] or whatsoever you do do all to the glory
[46:35] of
[46:37] God give none offense neither to the
[46:39] Jews nor to the Gentiles nor to the
[46:41] Church of God you may be seated oh
[46:44] praise
[46:45] God
[46:47] so this morning we I have a a spoke in
[46:51] Miami in a in uh in bride of Christ
[46:54] Church and I want to play back that
[46:55] message I I don't think I ever spoke
[46:58] that uh here uh about the bride
[47:01] Redemptive rights and I want to share
[47:03] that with you this morning um but before
[47:05] that I have something upon my heart I'd
[47:07] like to share from this scripture here
[47:09] and in the Amplified in 1 Corinthians 10
[47:12] it says so whether ye eat or drink
[47:15] whatever you may do do all for the honor
[47:20] and glory of God and this was striking
[47:22] me and then it said the verse 32 sayso
[47:25] not let yourselves be
[47:27] hindrances by giving an offense to the
[47:30] Jews or to the Greeks or to the Church
[47:33] of God In other words do not lead others
[47:35] into sin by your mode of life that's a
[47:39] harsh judgment in other words you better
[47:42] watch how you live you name the name of
[47:44] Christ then you want to live and act
[47:47] right and I have been contending that
[47:50] people have turned on the volume on life
[47:52] and turn up the volume on Mysteries and
[47:54] Revelations and information and stuff
[47:57] you see but what I want to get to you
[47:59] this morning before that tip comes on is
[48:01] that whatever you do you must seek to do
[48:04] it for God's honor and God glory you
[48:07] can't cuss for God's honor and God's
[48:09] glory you can't be angry and mean and
[48:12] wicked for God's on and Glory you cannot
[48:14] treat the Saints bad for God's on and
[48:16] God's glory you have to begin to do
[48:18] things for God's on and God's glory and
[48:21] if you begin to see that picture you
[48:23] would see your whole life transform
[48:25] where everything you want to do does god
[48:28] get Glory from this does God glory from
[48:31] that my attitude towards my wife my
[48:33] attitude towards my husband my attitude
[48:35] towards my neighbors the attitude
[48:37] towards the postman or Jehovah Witness
[48:39] in front of my gate does God get honor
[48:41] and Glory from what I do and how I live
[48:44] and if God is not getting unglory stop
[48:45] it cut it out because whatever you do
[48:48] whatever you do whatever you do whatever
[48:51] you do do for his honor and His glory oh
[48:54] blessed be the name of the Lord praise
[48:57] God and the prophet said here he talking
[48:59] about my name that has labored and has
[49:01] not fainted for my name did you notice
[49:03] they had patience labor for what his
[49:05] name that name holding in that church
[49:08] now watch it when we get down to the
[49:10] weak how that Fades out and goes into
[49:12] another name to keep the name of Jesus
[49:14] Christ above any church above anything
[49:17] else let it be first the Bible said
[49:19] whatever you do in word or deed do all
[49:22] in the name of Jesus Christ you can't
[49:24] smoke in the name of Jesus you can't go
[49:26] in the back in the name of Jesus you
[49:27] can't come in fornication adultery in
[49:29] the name of Jesus you can't lie in the
[49:31] name of Jesus whatever you doing word or
[49:33] deed you do all in the name of praise
[49:35] God you see you could do that as a
[49:37] church member but you cannot do that in
[49:39] in the name of Jesus Christ oh pray

[1:03:02] here we consider this a privilege to be
[1:03:07] here so if you have your
[1:03:10] Bibles i' like you to turn to three
[1:03:12] portion of
[1:03:18] scripture Revelation chapter
[1:03:23] 5yp Revelation chapter 8
[1:03:26] AP and Revelation chapter
[1:03:29] 10 reading from Revelation chapter
[1:03:33] 5 I saw in the right hand of him that
[1:03:35] sat on the throne a book written within
[1:03:37] and on the backside sealed with Seven
[1:03:41] Seals I saw a strong Angel Proclaim with
[1:03:43] a loud voice who is worthy to open the
[1:03:45] book and to loose the seals thereof and
[1:03:48] no man in Heaven Nor in Earth neither
[1:03:50] under the Earth was able to open the
[1:03:52] book neither to look thereon and I wept
[1:03:54] much because no man of strong
[1:03:56] to open and to read the book looked
[1:04:00] there and one of the elders said unto me
[1:04:02] weep not behold the land of tribe of
[1:04:04] Judah the root of David had prevailed to
[1:04:07] open the book and to loose the seven
[1:04:09] seeds thereof and I beheld andone the
[1:04:11] midst of the throne and of the four
[1:04:13] beasts and of the midst of the elders to
[1:04:14] the lamb as had been slain having seven
[1:04:17] horns seven eyes which are the seven
[1:04:20] spirits of God sent forth into the all
[1:04:22] the
[1:04:23] Earth and he came and took the book out
[1:04:26] of the right hand of him that sat upon
[1:04:27] the
[1:04:28] throne and when he had taken the book
[1:04:31] The Four beasts and four and 20 Elders
[1:04:34] fell down before the lamb having every
[1:04:36] one of them HPS and golden vs full of os
[1:04:39] which are the prayers of the Saints and
[1:04:41] they sng a new song saying Thou Art
[1:04:43] Worthy to take the book and to open the
[1:04:45] seals thereof for thou has slain and has
[1:04:47] redeemed us to God by thy blood out of
[1:04:50] every Kindred and tongue and people
[1:04:52] nation and has made unto us unto Our God
[1:04:56] made us unto our God Kings and Priests
[1:04:59] and we shall reign on the earth
[1:05:00] Revelation
[1:05:03] 81 and when he had opened the seventh
[1:05:06] seal there was silence in heaven about
[1:05:09] the space of half an hour our last
[1:05:12] scripture from Revelation
[1:05:14] 10 and I saw another Mighty Angel come
[1:05:17] down from heaven CL with a cloud and a
[1:05:19] rainbow was upon his head his face was
[1:05:21] with his Sun his feet as pill as the
[1:05:25] fire 10
[1:05:26] verse1 and he had in his right hand a
[1:05:29] little book open he set his right foot
[1:05:31] upon the sea and his left foot on the
[1:05:33] earth cried with a loud voice as when a
[1:05:36] land Roar it and when he had cried seven
[1:05:38] Thunders utter the voices but when the
[1:05:40] seven tunders had utter their voices I
[1:05:42] was about to write and I Heard a Voice
[1:05:44] from Heaven saying unto me seal up those
[1:05:46] things which your seven ters uttered and
[1:05:48] write them not and the angel which I saw
[1:05:50] stand upon the sea upon the Earth lifted
[1:05:53] up his hand to heaven and swear by him
[1:05:55] that live forever and ever who created
[1:05:57] heaven and the things that therein are
[1:05:59] and the earth and the things that
[1:06:00] therein are and the Sea and the things
[1:06:02] which are therein that there should be
[1:06:04] time no longer but in the days of the
[1:06:07] voice of the seventh angel when he shall
[1:06:09] begin to sound the mystery of God should
[1:06:11] be finished as he had declared to his
[1:06:14] servants the prophets and the voice
[1:06:16] which I heard from Heaven spake unto me
[1:06:17] again and said go take the little book
[1:06:20] which is open in the hand of the Angel
[1:06:22] which standeth upon the seene and upon
[1:06:23] the Earth and I went unto the angel Ang
[1:06:25] said unto him give me the little book he
[1:06:28] said unto me take it eat it up shall
[1:06:30] make thy belly bitter but it shall be in
[1:06:32] thy mouth sweet as honey and I took the
[1:06:35] little book out of the Angel's hand and
[1:06:37] ate it up it was in my mouth sweet as
[1:06:39] honey and as soon as I eaten it my belly
[1:06:42] was bitter and he said to me thou must
[1:06:45] prophesy again before many peoples and
[1:06:48] Nations and tongs and Kings let's bow

[1:10:39] last one is
[1:10:42] saved he is not talking about
[1:10:45] salvation he's talking about
[1:10:48] Redemption and to redeem be
[1:10:51] redeemed is to go back to where it was
[1:10:55] first
[1:10:56] in other words redeem means to bring you
[1:11:00] back to your first
[1:11:04] standing and in the
[1:11:06] beginning God said let us make man in
[1:11:10] our image and
[1:11:12] likeness let that man have
[1:11:16] dominion and God plac
[1:11:18] Adam to be that
[1:11:21] son that will produce other Sons just
[1:11:25] like him because every seed must bring
[1:11:29] forth after its
[1:11:31] kind but we know the
[1:11:33] story the devil came in interrupted the
[1:11:37] program of
[1:11:39] God and Adam fell and we fell with

[1:12:52] hands Satan who was kicked to

[1:27:26] soul glory to God
[1:27:29] glory because to be a word to be the
[1:27:33] word you have to be a thought

[1:27:43] contrary
[1:27:45] life she had a seed in
[1:27:48] her that she did not
[1:27:50] know so they take the word to Reve that
[1:27:55] woman that she's more than a
[1:27:57] prostitute she's more than a
[1:28:00] slacker she's more what everybody thinks
[1:28:03] about
[1:28:04] her so you cannot
[1:28:06] bother you cannot bother with what

[1:37:54] for the BR and this is from Revelation 5
[1:37:56] part
[1:37:59] 2 and uh you can put up this quote for
[1:38:03] me and this the part I want to get here
[1:38:05] now for it is the holy
[1:38:07] spirit okay ra saying here okay now over
[1:38:12] in
[1:38:13] Ephesians we have the earnest of our
[1:38:17] salvation and the earnest of our
[1:38:19] Redemption you
[1:38:21] could so in EP
[1:38:24] we have the earnest of
[1:38:27] salvation for it is the holy spirit that
[1:38:30] is the earnest our
[1:38:32] Redemption and then he said the next few
[1:38:34] weeks of
[1:38:37] teaching the next few weeks of
[1:38:39] teaching will be all based upon
[1:38:44] Redemption not
[1:38:47] justification not the medial work of
[1:38:49] office of
[1:38:51] intercession so brother br
[1:38:54] was bringing the word about
[1:38:57] Redemption which takes you completely
[1:38:59] out from Pentecostal
[1:39:04] or completely out of the denominational
[1:39:08] real because not
[1:39:10] Redemption you have to go back to your
[1:39:14] inheritance you understand that so you
[1:39:17] then before God are not a
[1:39:21] sinner mercy God Mercy
[1:39:25] Jesus this
[1:39:26] Redemption is the placement of
[1:39:30] sons that God wants to get back
[1:39:34] inheritance okay let's let me just back
[1:39:36] up a little bit now
[1:39:38] josa and
[1:39:41] Ephesians is the same book
[1:39:44] but now Redemption is in two parts
[1:39:49] coming out of and going into so come out
[1:39:52] a Baptist
[1:39:54] Catholic but some some of you just come
[1:39:57] out but you have to go
[1:39:59] in now Moses brought them out of
[1:40:03] Egypt Joshua took them into the land and
[1:40:07] Joshua had three things to do crossed
[1:40:10] over
[1:40:12] Jordan fight and then divide
[1:40:16] inheritance now theing of The
[1:40:18] Inheritance you cannot ask for
[1:40:21] inheritance talk about I am not
[1:40:24] worthy that I am not worthy
[1:40:27] story doesn't count so we not talking
[1:40:30] about I am not worthy if you go to I am
[1:40:33] not worthy you at the level of The
[1:40:37] Sinner when when when Caleb came to his
[1:40:41] portion Caleb said I'm not talking for
[1:40:44] Judah I'm not talking for ephra I'm not
[1:40:48] talking for Benjamin I'm not talking for
[1:40:51] no give me
[1:40:54] my Mountain
[1:40:58] soale had a
[1:41:02] revelation Oh Glory to God hallelujah
[1:41:05] amen hallelujah amen and I preaching my
[1:41:08] brother
[1:41:09] B and sharing some about
[1:41:12] Mary how Mary was in
[1:41:14] service and she was hearing the
[1:41:16] scriptures
[1:41:18] preach shall
[1:41:20] conceive like all the sisters there they
[1:41:23] know it has to happen but that was a
[1:41:26] general
[1:41:27] belief promised that it will happen
[1:41:32] because God said so but when the angel
[1:41:36] appeared to Mary and said Heil Mary you
[1:41:39] were highly
[1:41:41] favored when the angel finished with
[1:41:44] Mary Mary didn't say this is where
[1:41:46] everybody am she said be it done unto
[1:41:50] me according to Thy Word and when you
[1:41:53] get a
[1:41:54] revelation of your Redemptive
[1:41:57] rights you going to make
[1:42:00] claims you going to make your
[1:42:03] claim for your healing for your
[1:42:06] deliverance for the Holy Ghost for your
[1:42:10] husband for your wife for your children
[1:42:14] for your future for your
[1:42:17] finances whatever it is you want to make
[1:42:21] your
[1:42:22] claim glory to God oh my my
[1:42:27] myen
[1:42:30] Hallelujah you make a claim in your mind
[1:42:32] you
[1:42:34] know thinking it no no Hallelujah I
[1:42:38] don't know if I get
[1:42:41] time but but God had to speak the
[1:42:44] word before the word come
[1:42:47] to so first is a
[1:42:49] thought have to speak it so when of
[1:42:53] Angel Hallelujah the voice oh my God
[1:42:57] Amen Revelation 10 this have everything
[1:43:00] in it Revelation 101 is your husband is
[1:43:04] your husband that's Christ himself
[1:43:07] Revelation
[1:43:08] 103 seven
[1:43:10] tunders that's your message exclusive
[1:43:14] bright
[1:43:15] promise exclusive only for the
[1:43:18] bride
[1:43:19] 10 that's the messenger of this age
[1:43:24] but Revelation
[1:43:25] 10 the voice say go to the
[1:43:29] angel the book and ask him for the
[1:43:31] book you the bride John represented the
[1:43:35] bride you have to go to the
[1:43:37] angel because in that book have your
[1:43:41] Redemptive rights don't let no man stop
[1:43:45] you possessing your rights have a right
[1:43:49] to be
[1:43:49] healed I have a right to be free right
[1:43:53] to walk
[1:43:54] anointed hallelujah amen that is my
[1:43:59] right do you know your
[1:44:01] right my God praise the Lord praise the
[1:44:05] Lord listen to
[1:44:07] this if Christ died at
[1:44:10] Calvary he finished
[1:44:13] everything that was in the Redemptive
[1:44:17] plan everything was completed when he
[1:44:20] died at
[1:44:22] Calvary price was paid
[1:44:25] for so God had a Redemptive
[1:44:29] plan the plan means how do I get back my
[1:44:31] son's
[1:44:34] back but remember church is not
[1:44:37] original church is a means by which God
[1:44:40] connects to his
[1:44:43] people but in the beginning was a man
[1:44:45] and his
[1:44:47] wife not church and we are returning
[1:44:50] back to
[1:44:52] God turning back to
[1:44:54] Eden praise the Lord hallelujah am so
[1:44:57] Jesus had a Redemptive work to
[1:45:04] do now watch so the lamb here's the plan
[1:45:07] of it
[1:45:10] skip a seal is
[1:45:13] open a Myster is
[1:45:15] unfolded and when the mystery
[1:45:18] unfolds a trumpet song it declares war a
[1:45:22] plague fall
[1:45:24] and our church
[1:45:26] is he begins to proclaim the
[1:45:30] message and what does it
[1:45:32] start a spiritual war and then those who
[1:45:35] reject it a plague
[1:45:38] Falls and that keep going over and
[1:45:41] over it's a great plan until it comes to
[1:45:45] that last
[1:45:46] Angel he has no certain
[1:45:49] mystery but he guards them all up
[1:45:53] that have been lost to the
[1:45:55] ages he takes the book of
[1:45:59] seals and
[1:46:00] shows the seventh angel for this alone
[1:46:05] the mysteries of God is the
[1:46:09] ministry of the seventh
[1:46:11] angel notice Revelation 10
[1:46:16] 1-7 all the
[1:46:18] Mysteries are to be revealed to the
[1:46:21] bride by by the messenger of Lan
[1:46:25] Church there is no
[1:46:27] man to come after the prophet and reveal
[1:46:32] new
[1:46:32] Mysteries this is what I'm reading here
[1:46:34] now all the Mysteries not some all all
[1:46:39] the Mysteries will be revealed to the
[1:46:43] bride by the messenger of loud
[1:46:47] and glory to God hallelujah someone said
[1:46:51] well brother Bram them
[1:46:54] will reveal in the last
[1:46:56] days some great
[1:46:58] mystery how to get closer to
[1:47:01] God I said no sir it is to
[1:47:04] reveal what has already been
[1:47:07] written because you cannot take one word
[1:47:10] or add
[1:47:11] one oh praise God at the end of the
[1:47:14] Pentecostal
[1:47:15] age we are supposed to
[1:47:17] receive a
[1:47:19] messenger that will take the Loose Ends
[1:47:24] and the reveal and reveal the whole
[1:47:25] Secret Of
[1:47:27] God for the rtion of the church so all
[1:47:30] the Mysteries was to be
[1:47:33] revealed
[1:47:35] purpose the purpose was the rting of the
[1:47:39] church and there is coming forth seven
[1:47:41] mysterious
[1:47:42] Thunders that are not even written at
[1:47:45] all and I believe that through those
[1:47:49] seven
[1:47:50] tunders will be revealed
[1:47:53] in the last days had the purpose now in
[1:47:56] order to get the bride
[1:47:58] together for rapturing Faith because
[1:48:01] what we got now we won't be able to do
[1:48:04] it something got to step
[1:48:07] further we we hardly have faith for
[1:48:10] Divine Healing we hardly have enough
[1:48:13] faith for Divine Healing we have got
[1:48:16] have enough
[1:48:18] Faith to be
[1:48:20] changed and we will find afterward
[1:48:24] find where it is written so first he say
[1:48:27] it's not written after a
[1:48:29] while going to find where it's written

[2:12:52] he said the seventh and last one of
[2:12:56] seal when it is
[2:12:58] open now we read the
[2:13:01] scripture when he opened the seven
[2:13:04] seal there was
[2:13:06] silence half an
[2:13:08] all so the prophet saying when when the
[2:13:12] last one of the seat was

[2:13:18] chapter soam
[2:13:21] con Revelation

[2:13:51] God bruised him and mashed
[2:13:56] him he was wounded for our
[2:13:59] transgression and he let the rainbow
[2:14:03] light of his seven Church
[2:14:06] ages flash upon
[2:14:09] me there is your seven rainbow
[2:14:12] colors the seven spirits of
[2:14:16] God are seven fruits of the
[2:14:20] spirit that would reflect back in his
[2:14:23] people now remember the Book of
[2:14:26] Revelation is a book
[2:14:29] of amen amen so the seven spirits are
[2:14:33] seven fruits of the spirit what is he
[2:14:36] talking about second Peter
[2:14:39] 1
[2:14:41] 427 your faith virtue and knowledge
[2:14:43] these are the and so on these are the
[2:14:44] seven fruits that's supposed to be in us
[2:14:48] then he said there are seven
[2:14:50] qualifications
[2:14:52] to make the statue of
[2:14:53] God there are seven Church ages that God
[2:14:57] brought the church to
[2:15:00] disqualification and he had seven
[2:15:02] Messengers to do with all right I'm
[2:15:05] going to skip down
[2:15:09] [Applause]
[2:15:13] now all right here we go Christ has
[2:15:16] redeemed us
[2:15:18] now we are now redeemed
[2:15:22] but he has not claimed his possession
[2:15:25] yet you might different with
[2:15:28] that but hold on AIT it he hasn't
[2:15:32] claimed it he he took the book of
[2:15:36] redemption everything that Adam had
[2:15:39] everything that he lost Christ redeems
[2:15:42] back he already redeemed us but he
[2:15:46] hasn't took his possession
[2:15:48] yet he cannot
[2:15:51] until the time
[2:15:53] appointed and then will come a
[2:15:55] resurrection and then the Earth will be
[2:15:57] renewed
[2:15:58] again and then he will take
[2:16:01] possession he's got when he redeemed
[2:16:04] us he will do it at his appointed
[2:16:07] time so we are redeemed now but not yet
[2:16:12] claimed so it come like you buy a
[2:16:14] Furniture in the
[2:16:16] store and you have the evidence of
[2:16:19] purchase which is the
[2:16:21] receipt but you haven't picked it up as
[2:16:25] so Christ coming to pick you up but at
[2:16:28] Calvary he paid the price so he has
[2:16:32] evidence of purchase which is the book
[2:16:36] which is
[2:16:37] his he has the evidence that you belong
[2:16:41] to him when
[2:16:43] Satan accuses of you he did this she did
[2:16:49] this accuser stop accusing one
[2:16:53] another you are not the
[2:16:56] devil the devil is the accuser of the
[2:17:00] Brethren when he
[2:17:02] accuses about you Jesus said I died for
[2:17:07] them I pay the price for what are you
[2:17:10] talking about that doesn't count I Dro
[2:17:14] your
[2:17:15] charges I Dro their charges Jesus
[2:17:19] dropped the charges
[2:17:21] Jesus dropped their
[2:17:24] charges Jesus dismissed your
[2:17:27] case he dismissed

[2:17:37] Trump want his case to be dismissed
[2:17:39] Donald
[2:17:41] Trump he want his case dismissed Donald
[2:17:44] TR but
[2:17:46] Jesus dismiss your
[2:17:48] case not guilty Sav by Grace Oh Glory to
[2:17:54] God hallelujah am I'm going to
[2:17:58] [Applause]
[2:18:04] finish okay all
[2:18:07] right listen to this now before a
[2:18:12] word it's a
[2:18:15] thought and a thought has to be
[2:18:19] created God told
[2:18:22] become
[2:18:23] creation when it is spoke by a
[2:18:27] word this is deep
[2:18:29] now first he presented to you as a
[2:18:35] thought his thought and it's revealed to
[2:18:39] you but it's still a thought until you
[2:18:42] speak it so you have to come from
[2:18:45] thinking to speaking you have speak it I
[2:18:50] claim my
[2:18:51] husband I claim the Holy Ghost I claim
[2:18:55] my
[2:18:56] healing don't just think
[2:18:58] it speak
[2:19:00] it glory to God amen hallelujah amen
[2:19:04] what said this now the reason
[2:19:08] Moses went out to pray the pillar fire
[2:19:11] around him God said go and hold your
[2:19:14] stick towards the
[2:19:16] east and call for
[2:19:19] flies no flies as
[2:19:22] yet God thought has been
[2:19:26] spoken God tell Moses call for
[2:19:29] flies thinking about
[2:19:32] it Fly will
[2:19:35] come until the word
[2:19:38] come so when God tell
[2:19:40] Moses call for flies then Moses said the
[2:19:44] thought God said the god thought was
[2:19:48] spoken speak it
[2:19:51] it's the word it's got to happen so that
[2:19:55] your
[2:19:56] revelation of your Redemptive
[2:20:00] rights give you the
[2:20:02] authority to
[2:20:04] speak and to make
[2:20:06] claims so Mary when she heard the
[2:20:10] angel she knew it wasn't about any other
[2:20:15] sister it was no but no other
[2:20:17] woman it was no other virgin that
[2:20:21] scripture was talking about
[2:20:23] me glory to God amen hallelujah amen
[2:20:26] final
[2:20:29] quote from this is against organ
[2:20:34] religion just to the end you can put up
[2:20:36] that
[2:20:37] qu last quote the Holy Spirit today the
[2:20:43] manifestation of the holy spirit is that
[2:20:47] angel trying to get the
[2:20:49] people back to the word because the holy
[2:20:53] spirit will only V the
[2:20:56] word so the voice said go to the
[2:21:00] angel say give me that book take it and
[2:21:05] eat it and just think about it no didn't
[2:21:09] say that must prophesy again that means
[2:21:13] it must come out your
[2:21:14] mouth and the spirit of
[2:21:17] Prophecy is the testimony of Jesus we
[2:21:20] have had the testimony of Jesus for all
[2:21:24] these years because we are
[2:21:26] prophesying of the coming of the Lord

[2:44:24] [Music]
[2:44:26] Jesus he
[2:44:29] call he
[2:44:33] first what an
[2:44:36] anointing what an
[2:44:39] atmosphere oh what a
[2:44:46] presence friends you could see every
[2:44:49] service we are getting closer and closer
[2:44:53] breaking from this humanistic realm into
[2:44:56] divine revelation into Vision into the
[2:44:59] presence of the Lord wanting to make
[2:45:01] himself known to you as an
[2:45:04] individual in your home in your life in
[2:45:07] your situation and what an authority
[2:45:09] today in the service you appreciate the
[2:45:13] service and the authority in ministering
[2:45:16] the word and it was something else I I
[2:45:19] touched with the Clarence I said it
[2:45:20] something to see the change of the faces
[2:45:23] of the people and to see the word itself
[2:45:26] beginning to break chains change your
[2:45:28] perspective change your outlook and and
[2:45:30] that's what you want to see not a work
[2:45:32] up but the word itself coming to you as
[2:45:34] an individual and you beginning to see
[2:45:37] yourself in the word because that's what
[2:45:39] the prophet taught us that's that's who
[2:45:41] you are your name written in the word is
[2:45:43] the mystery of who you are it's not the
[2:45:45] literal name not Clarence Clark but the
[2:45:47] mystery of who you are a virgin shall
[2:45:50] conceive and then Mary one day say
[2:45:53] that's me be it unto me according to
[2:45:56] that word because that's me in the word
[2:45:58] there and once you see your name in the
[2:46:00] word then the devil is finished doubt is
[2:46:03] finished depression is finished you'll
[2:46:06] still have your ups and your downs but
[2:46:07] you know your name is written in the
[2:46:09] book and once your name is written in
[2:46:11] the book nothing can stop you from
[2:46:13] coming into manifestation can the church
[2:46:15] say amen and that's our confidence
[2:46:18] that's our Assurance that's our position
[2:46:21] when the doctor's report say one thing
[2:46:23] you look in the word and see I'm the god
[2:46:25] that heals you written in the word and
[2:46:27] you place yourself there and say that's
[2:46:29] me and count this contrary to whatever
[2:46:32] the doctor says can the church say Amen
[2:46:35] oh blessed be the name of the
[2:46:39] Lord hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[2:46:44] wonderful so as we prepare to close out
[2:46:46] this

[2:55:13] know he's tired but we're looking for
[2:55:15] God to touch him and as he renews the
[2:55:18] Eagle that he would renew the strength
[2:55:20] of the eagle of this church can the
[2:55:22] church say amen amen so and we need all
[2:55:25] hands on deck all soldiers Ready for War

[2:55:32] store for us this weekend I it'll be a
[2:55:35] great honor to have brother stephanus
[2:55:36] here to minister to us I've seen how the
[2:55:40] Lord has used him and has worked with
[2:55:42] him and I had a privilege like I would
[2:55:44] have said before to minister in the
[2:55:47] Germany convention last last year and
[2:55:49] just a few weeks ago to the youth
[2:55:51] convention that he hosted and to see how
[2:55:53] the Lord has continued to use him with a
[2:55:55] burden he has a true burden and I see
[2:55:58] the Lord really upon his life and I know
[2:56:00] that the services that we're going to
[2:56:02] have this weekend will be a tremendous
[2:56:04] time not just of the word and the moving
[2:56:06] of the spirit but a time for deliverance
[2:56:08] I want to encourage you encouraging
[2:56:10] young people to make an extra effort to

[2:57:22] post convention planning team you know
[2:57:24] who you are and in preparation for um
[2:57:27] the upcoming convention I want to remind
[2:57:30] the church that we are in preparation
[2:57:32] for our UPC coment our upcoming
[2:57:34] convention in July and we really solicit
[2:57:37] your support we do have quite a bit of
[2:57:40] various expenses that we need to be able
[2:57:43] to take care of so it is not a matter of
[2:57:46] we would we would like your support we
[2:57:48] really need your support so we want to
[2:57:50] encourage you we have this month of of
[2:57:53] March April May June and even into July
[2:57:56] whatever you can do to support and you
[2:57:58] can commit to that level of support um
[2:58:01] via the team downstairs who would be
[2:58:03] taking um that information so we could
[2:58:05] have clear visibility on what we are
[2:58:07] able to do as we pull together for the
[2:58:10] glory of the Lord and for this
[2:58:12] convention one more time we don't know
[2:58:13] how many more conventions we'll have we
[2:58:16] see what's happening in the world and I
[2:58:18] if you saw the news just a couple days
[2:58:19] ago in Russia somebody just got in there
[2:58:21] and shot over a hundred people killed
[2:58:24] and and you imagine as you going on in
[2:58:26] the natural Street and something like
[2:58:28] that happening you see that the that the
[2:58:30] lid of hell is uncovered and streams of
[2:58:32] demon powers just just moving around the
[2:58:34] earth so and the Bible said that if God
[2:58:37] don't cut the work short not even the
[2:58:39] elect would make it so God has to
[2:58:41] intervene in the situation and we see
[2:58:43] the lead of hell is uncovered at the
[2:58:45] same time Sons and Daughters of God are
[2:58:47] coming into true realization and a
[2:58:49] revelation that time is short and we
[2:58:51] need to get ready to leave here so I
[2:58:52] want to encourage you to balance your
[2:58:55] life between the natural and the
[2:58:56] spiritual I know there are a lot of
[2:58:58] natural things your school your career
[2:59:00] your job and these things are really
[2:59:01] things that take up your time and effort
[2:59:03] but make sure in this you don't lose
[2:59:05] your identity your spiritual identity in
[2:59:07] God as a son and a daughter of God
[2:59:09] because this heaven and this earth and
[2:59:11] the paper and the certification will
[2:59:13] pass away the bank account will pass
[2:59:14] away the house will pass away the car
[2:59:16] will pass away but this word of God will
[2:59:18] not pass away and our promise is not to
[2:59:21] live in heaven we shall reain on the
[2:59:22] earth so we need to come into a full
[2:59:24] realization so I want to encourage you
[2:59:26] young people don't take it for granted
[2:59:28] don't take it lightly come under
[2:59:30] expectation you're going to get what you
[2:59:32] expect so once more no physical service
[2:59:34] on Wednesday this weekend special
[2:59:36] weekend all are welcome invite someone
[2:59:38] Friday at 5:00 p.m. Saturday at 5:00
[2:59:40] p.m. Sunday at 8: a.m. brunch afterwards
[2:59:43] please get your registration in for the
[2:59:46] brunch and uh like like I said
[2:59:48] maintenance group five meet with brother
[2:59:50] Blackman after the service and next
[2:59:52] Sunday we'll be uh group four which is
[2:59:54] brother maron's group remember brother
[2:59:56] stephanus in prayer as he's coming in
[2:59:58] it's a big sacrifice for him to be here
[3:00:00] as well and also remember our pastor in
[3:00:02] prayer who is also preparing to fly out
[3:00:05] to Ivory Coast for the convention over
[3:00:07] there so it's a lot to keep track of but
[3:00:09] in all of these things we go to the Lord
[3:00:10] in prayer so that he will have control
[3:00:12] knowing that God is in control and
[3:00:14] everything is in order and God moving
[3:00:16] things around as a prophet said the
[3:00:18] Angel of the Lord has that
[3:00:19] responsibility to move things around for
[3:00:21] the coming of the Lord and we really
[3:00:23] want to be under great expectation come
[3:00:24] on time come pray up come looking for
[3:00:27] God to do something wonderful and last
[3:00:29] and certainly not least those who are
[3:00:31] part of the postmortem SL planning team
[3:00:34] for the convention um we do have a brief
[3:00:37] meeting after the service so may the
