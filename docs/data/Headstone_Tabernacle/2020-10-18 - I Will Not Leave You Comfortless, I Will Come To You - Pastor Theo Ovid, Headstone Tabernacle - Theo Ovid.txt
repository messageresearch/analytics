said when i'm gone heal is not gone there is still healing and miracle work in power and the power of the living god in the church of the living god call us to believe and all things are possible to them that believe just bar heads and close your eyes they want to pray heavenly father we thank you for your presence lord we are so unworthy and your blood have given us this opportunity that we could approach a throne of grace with confidence knowing that if we ask in your name you could give us the desires we could answer prayer you could hear and have heard your prayer and father we bring

you were here on the earth lord you conquered every manner of sickness and disease lord come again one more time and write this trail granted lord in jesus name we ask it amen and amen oh god bless you praise the lord um thank you lord jesus may be seated uh before we get into the word i have something i'd like to share with you uh i preached a message on the sunday 20th september and the message was judgment is set a time of lingering a space of grace and i i truly believe the lord put it upon my heart to present that word to you i feel uh it was a word from the lord and i got a testimony and we didn't read it but this testimony i was given my brother terrence and i want to share it with you now he said dear brother to you i just wanted to give this testimony concerning the message you preach on sunday twentieth twenty twenty about three weeks ago while i listened to the message called heisen and simplicity albuquerque new mexico the anointing of the holy spirit could have been felt coming off the tape while brother branham was exhorting the church to receive the holy ghost i had a tremendous experience in the spirit and after the service the holy spirit put it on my heart to call you and tell you that after you preach your message you should play this part of the tape so that the prophet could exhort and inspire the believers to get desperate to receive the baptism of the holy ghost however i never called you because the enemy came immediately and brought my battles and thoughts and saying you can't do that you cannot tell the pastor what you should do and that you know that'll be out of place and what you are looking for is is a good rebuke i eventually said in my heart lord he is your pastor and you have to speak to him so when you said on sunday which is the sunday 20th that you are finished and you turn on the prophet to teach the people to receive the holy ghost my mind was blown for here you are doing exactly what the holy spirit said you should do and i believe that that message was dossier at the spirit the anointing of the holy spirit was so real even my parrot was praising the lord i thank and praise the lord for the way he is using you to feed his sheep spiritual food and due season may god bless you when god richly bless you and your wife and family brother terrence of it oh praise the lord amen hallelujah isn't that something so i just felt that the lord wanted that read and shared with you this morning oh blessed be the name of the lord where do we go from here okay so right in your home where you are this is not the message yet no this is just a backdrop i'll just share something with you i want you to never to psalms 105. um um and maybe akashi we could read together but i would certainly love you to read it together with me right where you are psalms 105 says verse 1 3 4 or give thanks unto the lord call upon his name make known his deeds among the people sing unto him sing psalms unto him talk he of all his wondrous works glory in his holy name let the heart of them rejoice that seek the lord seek the lord and his strength seek his face ever more remember his marvelous works that he done his wonders and the judgments of his mouth oi seed of abraham his servant a children of jacob is chosen he is the lord our god his judgments are in all the earth he had remembered his covenant forever the word which he commanded to a thousand generations which covenant he made with abraham and his oath unto isaac and confirmed the same unto jacob for a law under israel for an everlasting covenant singing unto thee will i give the land of canaan the lot of your inheritance when they were but a few men in number yey very few and strangers in it when they went from one nation to another from one kingdom to another people he suffered no man to do them wrong yea he reproved kings for their sake saying touched not my anointed and do my prophets no harm moreover he called for a famine upon the land he break the whole staff of bread he sent a man before them even joseph who was sold for a servant whose feet they hurt with fetters he was laid in iron until the time that the word came the word of the lord tried it may god bless his word god bless you and that is just something that was kind of stirring me before i didn't have this when i wanted to preach this but this came to me and i wanted to meditate a little bit upon this word of the lord tried him the word of the lord tried him and um it's very interesting when you look at things from a different perspective i want you to think it's not your wife trying you your husband trying your children the balls the job the car the this no money whatever no i want you to look at what really is doing the trying is the word i want you to think about in the gardener eden what was given to adam the word the day you eat thereof that day you die that was the word that he shared with his wife eve that was the word he gave to her isn't that right and and gave her that word and that that she had to hold on to now when the serpent came uh the serpent said what did god say she gave him the word the day we eat thereof that did you die but he put a little knot inside a deer and she accepted that knot all she had was to do was said you shall not you shall surely die god said so i believe it god settle it go your way i'm not going to change my mind no no you see so because it was twisted and she received it that brought her into a different experience that changed everything hallelujah a false word a false revelation a false light bringing someone into a different experience and she fell and she died now let's switch to joseph hallelujah god called joseph he was a special son he was given the wrote ruben of any color but his ordination and his placement was to be at the right hand of pharaoh now joseph cannot ups himself and take himself from the land of canaan and say pharaoh i come to be right hand that can't work so therefore it has to have a road and a process how to get joseph to his position and this is where we miss many a times our own experiences what we go through and why we go through them but is unto a purpose god of a destiny for your life and a place for your life and he has a process by which he gonna get you from where you are to where you supposed to be so here it is joseph his brethren rejected him he's not enemy now he's not some haters now this is his own his own brethren they reject him so much to the point they hated him to the point where they're selling more to egypt joseph having a rough time a terrible experience but is all have a design and a mind and intelligence and a purpose and an intent behind it to get him into his position joseph lands in egypt and he find himself working as gardener and get himself a promotion okay he was doing quite well so inspiring was he with his life in his job and his work that he got a promotion to head potiphar's house his wife under that spirit of lust pushing a move on joseph he rejected that because here why he was staying with the world it doesn't matter he jesse was tempted but he was aware of that word of destiny that was upon his life and that is why he run for his life that running for his life brought him into prison but you see he couldn't go from potiphar house to the right hand of pharaoh it doesn't work that way because pharaoh have a butler and a baker that jordan gonna meet in prison and the connection to pharaoh has to be somebody joseph have to meet and the only place he could meet that person is in fear in the prison and the only way he could get into prison is to be wrongly accused so god set up the drama oh glory to god the word of the lord is still trying hallelujah when he interpreted dreams of the bake and the butler and we know the story the baker was going to be killed the butler was going to be restored he told the butler remember me but joseph had a time of lingering a time of lingering to wait until god's time because once god time break nothing changed everything changed after that is everything normal joseph in prison he interpret and dream he could look to the bars he could preach his revelation nobody bought him with joseph it looked like the vision is dead it looked like everything flat it looked like it's not going to happen but that is not so god have an appointed time so here is joseph lingering until god is ready and when god is ready clicks turn a key and give pharaoh a dream and pharaoh called his wise men to interpret and then he said heads off if you can't come and give some revelation all these smart men in your spirit you have this revelation you have this big this vision and you have this and that come interpret this from me they couldn't see a p they couldn't say a word then they bought the heart was to say there was a man in prison his name is joseph and then the pharaoh could say sent for joseph so i want to show you something there was there was no other route for joseph to pass to get into his position and your part today glory hallelujah i hope you see it hallelujah god have a root and there is no way you could escape that route there's a certain part a walk a journey that you have to get to to get into your position so joseph hat was to go to prison to go to prison he had to pass through 45 experience oh glory to god to get the potiphar he has to be kicked out by his brothers oh glory to god and the rest speaks for itself so the word of the lord is what was trying him not his brothers hallelujah not potty for wife oh glory to god not the butler he ungrateful wretch are telling me go into pharaoh's right hand uh going back to be restored and look he's going his way no no no not the butler not potiphar's wife not his own brethren but the word of the lord because when the brethren came to show you how joseph was disconnected from the humanistic realm that have issues as to what you do me 10 years ago and 20 years ago and you shouldn't have done that he said god send me ahead to preserve life so joseph by vision and revelation could see the intelligence and the mind of god i wonder many at times how many people think what does god think about this before they do this before ministers say this and preach this and reveal this and show this and and whatever do they ever think what does god think about this all the political machinations all the manipulations all of that do they ever think what does court think about this but judgment is set and that means god changes his mind about that at all he's already set and for the bride a time of lingering and a space of grace so may may the lord bless you and i find that um it was stirring upon me that sometimes we don't look at this way we see the wife and the husband and the children and this and the dad and the boss but is it so so the wife commit adultery or some kind of thing and you come adultery too because no no no i did not always work so somebody do you something i want to do them back and the reason you do them back is because they do you first that is not so is what are you seeing are you behaving correctly this one costs you them because the casino cost them back that is not that using flesh and blood but when you see the word train you then you could say like job to your wife you speak like a foolish woman hallelujah because job understood it wasn't the woman it was the pressure and the stress in heaven god was boasting about job i'm not going past the time i was supposed to go here but i want to show you what was the battle there's not a man like him you can't make him curse me god could boast he could go through whatever but he's going to stay with the world so god bless you we want to stand now we want to go into the word i have two portions of scripture to read for you genesis 18 verse 14 and also sin john chapter 14 verse 12 to 26 these are two scriptures this morning genesis 18 14 and uh sin john 14 who praise the name of the lord genesis 18 14 is anything too hard for the lord at the time appointed i will return to zee according to the time of life and sarah shall have a son it's in john 14 verse 12 verily verily sent to you he that believeth on me the works that i do shall you do also in greater works than these shall he do because i go unto my father whatsoever he shall ask in my name that will i do that the father may be glorified and the son if he acts anything in my name i will do it if you love me keep my commandments and i will pray the father he shall give you another comforter that he may vibrate you forever even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it sees him not need annoyed him but you know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you yet a little while and the world's hate me no more but ye see me and because i live he shall live also on that day you shall know i'm in my father and he and me and i knew he that had my commandments and keeped them he is that love at me and he that loved me shall be loved of my father and i would love him i will manifest myself to him judah said unto him not to scare it lord how is it that dow will manifest thyself unto us and not unto the world and jesus answered and said unto him if a man loves me he will keep my words and my father will love him i will come unto him and make our board with him he that loveth me not keep it not my sayings and the word which you hear is not mine but the fathers which sent me these things have i spoken unto you being yet present with you but the comforter is that then we find it now which is the holy ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to remembrance whatsoever i have said unto you let's bow heads heavenly father we thank you for your word lord and and this is the message lord you put upon my heart and i pray that you would bless it and take me out of the way god may have come and confirmable with signs wonders and miracles father your were declared lord the lord himself went everywhere with them confirming his word come and confirm your word to your peoples this morning in the name of jesus blesses interpreted their hearts in jesus name i asked amen you may be seated o praise the name of the lord thank you jesus i have a title i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you hallelujah i will not give you comfortless i will come to you on a subject becoming a candidate for the baptism of the holy spirit and an inspiration a personal appointment with the supernatural and i want you to note praise the lord let me just look back at this here and jesus was speaking uh here he said um uh i will pray the father he will give you another comforter that he may babble you forever even the spirit of truth so you identifying what it is it's the spirit of truth and i want you to know just as half the spirit of truth it have a spirit of error okay and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive i will not give you comfort less i will come to you and he said at that day you shall know i am in the father and my and and he and me and i knew and he had my commandments and keep at them so he's not talking them or he give the holy spirit to them that obey him so he's not he that talk it and explain it and and share it no he that had my commandments and keeped them in other words you're staying with your word you're staying with the word he said uh uh you're standing in such a way that that even if you can't hear from god the devil can't move you because you're standing on the word you're you're able to say god said so so whatever whatever we are preaching it has to be dusty of the lord that's how it should be because we posters say god said so not the pastor interpreted so no but god said so that is thus yet alone that is the word that that can't fail heaven will pass away but that word can't pass away i will love him and will manifest myself to him okay what i want to get this power he said but the comforter which is the holy ghost whom the father will send in my name o praise the name of the lord hallelujah praise god thank you lord jesus the comforter whom the father will send in my name thank you jesus blessed be the name of the lord he shall teach you all things and bring all things a remembrance whatsoever i've said unto you oh praise the name of the lord so we thank god for that that the comforter is promised and he's going to come i will come to you that abnormal fight for ministry and pastor and evangelist and apostle and teacher and prophet that there's a promise that god made isn't that right that the father will come to you isn't that why we will come to you isn't that right praise the name of the lord so but abraham says he says no he says no um this is from a message the deity of jesus christ he said praise god he said they will have a form of godliness but deny the power thereof from such turn away and they are taken their stand communism taken their stand and praise god the holy ghost is taking its turn and when the enemy come like a flood then it raises the standard against it that's right and the church has taken her stand i mean the holy ghost church and that's what i'm interested in friends oh dear i pray for the sick but in here i'm interested in one thing and that's the born-again church that is what i'm interested in i'm not interested in bylaws deacons and so forth and orders of churches i'm interested in the baptism of the holy ghost upon the church for this day that we are living in he's not talking about pentecost he is not about 1906. he talked about the baptism he goes for this day there's a promise of the holy ghost for this day oh glory to god can we say amen hallelujah for this day we are living in that's the fundamental part and that is what we are looking for so who is this comforter then jesus and he said i'll give you another comforter even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it needn't know it and nor see it him but you know him for he dwelled with you in a body of flesh now amen but shall be in you and will abide with you forever and then he begin to talk about a sacred trust you know what a trust is and his inheritance is a heritage that we inherit as believe in children it's a sacred trust the word itself is the vitamins the word itself god's word is the vitamins oh glory to god and he said we have a sacred trust to treating christ the word and the prayer a sacred trust like a contract inheritance a word to you the word christ and prayer is a sacred trust you don't want to break it as a covenant hallelujah is an agreement is what gives you access rights to the things and the blessings of god hallelujah glory to god and that's the reason i am so dogmatic as i would call it on standing on this word no matter what anybody else says if it's not with the word i don't believe it so when he says our church who believe the holy ghost is just as real as it was in the pentecost i will not move from that i don't care what mysteries a man reveal what mysteries a man preach new mysteries whatever it is praise god i will not move from that it must be the same holy ghost that they had in their pentecost we know it's not another pentecost in the weight of 120 in the upper room we know that that's that that's obvious but the holy ghost that they got is the same holy ghost you have to receive oh glory to god hallelujah oh my hallelujah praise god i live by the word it's our inheritance the word you say oh god let us think of it the deepness of it it's our privilege is this sacred trust that god has put to his church god give us his word the to the church and that sacred heritage is ours it's a gift from god not to just compromise on this and cut this out and throw this out and add this and to suit our own taste but to preach the full word so it's not customizing to suit the church taste and the message word taste and what the feed know is what god required this hour he said if we don't get it right we will miss the rapture we can't we can't go with rapture with all these letters and and information and no it has to have power it has to have something to take the church out oh glory to god hallelujah if this could have taken rapture if this was rapture power then we we should be rapture already if we take something more than books and tapes it will take something more than just a fightful ministry for something more than that it will take the power of god hallelujah putting men in position and there's a journey to put you in position jesus couldn't come to be before time johnny even comments on the baptized yet oh jesus is coming forward jesus had to wait he had to wait because i'm 25 years old and i have revelation now on our story books of the bible and are going down to the temple you entertainment you have to wait oh glory to god you have to watch because god were to tell him they have to have a foreigner before you oh glory to god so when john was baptized and jesus was watching what was happening he still had to wait he can't just go because john baptized and he had to wait until the appointed time because god has to talk to john and god tell john the one upon whom you see that dub descendant he gonna baptize them with the holy ghost and with fire it's not preached but there's still the word of god there's a baptism of the holy ghost on fire and no preaching or change that the message didn't change that i have no modern holy ghost and when you when he went quick unto you and mary said be done unto me according to thy word and mary get produced messiah is that right that same area to hit the upper room don't bring no kind of contrarian ultra timing dislocating the word mary said be it done on me according to your word and then she got she manifest christ is that right that same area to get in your room and stagger like everybody else and be stripped like everybody else and go to the process like everybody else to get that fire oh glory to god to get that power and there's a power promise i'm going to appreciate till i see it i'm going to speak until i see it it's got to come to

take over oh hallelujah there will be a church with jesus walking in it the shout of the king will be in the camp oh hallelujah oh glory to god for the brand of god help me god help us as christians never to compromise one of god's word the sacred trust some knew if it knew it they're true who could bring new revelation he said the spirit the prophet and the bride will say the same thing and what they say will already be said in the world he said well you're tired yeah you're preaching the same thing one brother say 30 years how much years now you say me i pray the same thing them on trumpets now they are not going to fully revelations here and the same thing same with rheem same sermon hallelujah boiled egg rose egg fried egg egg benny dick or display or do the egg whatever it is the same egg same promise i'm looking for that promise to be manifested yes it's so long you're waiting so long i still wait him because god said he will send it just like he said the bride's revival he said there have been no revival he had no matter but no bribe revival yet that they passed any man said that past is a liar false teacher that they pass he said he will send it if the people will forget the crease and dogmas and plead the promises what is it to please the promised lord you promise it you promise that you promise to heal me you've always delivered me you want me to bless me you promised to make away from you promise it you can't lie lord i'm counting on you as david said and that joseph had said our eyes is on you look at the lord i shout oh glory to god our eyes is on you why is on you man that was jehoshaphatel the lord the armies are almost around us he said god look at our children everybody come out and fast and pray they stand up in the city they say oh god isn't that you the god the judge of the whole earth that you just intervene in your fears of men god look at what condition we have no condition to fight this great enemy our eyes is on you oh glory to god then the spirit of the lord came upon jehaziah and said tell them tell them tell them they don't have to fight for this battle it's not tears it is the lord's and tonight this battle is not ours it is the laws you're going to fight for us tell them oh glory to god oh god the lord i shout wherever you are oh hallelujah hallelujah the spirit have to come upon somebody who call me the god we have to hear from the spirit oh glory to god healing heart and air let them hear but the spirit sees unto the churches but what a man stood in the back room last night what the spirit said unto the churches thank you lord now he says what that's the reason if you stay with the word the way god wrote it there'll be all kind of things happening among you it's supernatural it's the power of god it's the witness of the spirit all he actually just stayed with the word and then bear reproach for the word because all that is part of the package when you get a promise you have to have a barren period you have a time of lingering a time for the mockers and the scoffers to laugh and have a good time but you're saying what god said what abraham is supposed to do when god tell him as an old man you'll have a son what that man was supposed to do but the my bible tell me he staggered not at the promise of god to unbelieve what was strong in faith given praise and glory to god what he supposed to do but give god praise because he was fully persuaded tonight are you fully persuaded that this will become dynamics to the mechanics but i am persuaded that's why i preach the way i preach my soul like a crazy man but i believe it with all my heart oh glory to god the god that was will of william branham is still alive tonight oh glory to god listen about it right i'm here that's the reason if you stay with the word the way god wrote it there'll be what kind of things happening among you every word will be fulfilled listen i'm on the expectation just myself of seeing this shaken power come on oh what i supposed to unexpect what what coronavirus shaking of the world what happened to our power what was beyond the expectation we have to have the power to shake up coronavirus and whatever the virus whatever thing had to come coming he said they go stop cancer sons of god manifested they're going to stop diseases stop it arrest it catch it or bind binders up lock it up oh hallelujah god if god can get a people under his control if he will get a man or woman that won't compromise on this word but will stand there like the rock of ages that will believe every word of it and believe that he's behind it a man who believes it you must act like it if you don't act like it you don't believe it but if you believe it act like it and you can put it to work and the word will be with you the word will be in you we lost our heritage because we compromise when we compromise we can't expect watch god to keep his promise to us because we have broken it upon the secret trust and defile the trust that god given us look at history the old testament men of god anointed full of purpose and afterwards god bless them they do this and then they screw up and mess up because they break they break the word as they break the word god could only work listen listen true his word not our feelings not our history that's why i don't go back to much in history you know church history and church history like that by history history of experiences people could say god was with them 20 years ago but could they say god with them now that the history but he's the same yesterday then forever when all them was dancing coming out of egypt they were dancing in the spirit you know the anointing all out all over them jubilee trumpet song everybody singing specials and making their own song and the music amen when they fire overseas and skype 30 years our father is it man in the wilderness and jesus said under everyone dead same god that brought them out same god judge them the message world hasn't seen judgments of god yet yet because god said begin at my sanctuary then they begin at the ancient men who were before the house that is still yet to come glory to god god judgment is lingering oh hallelujah praise god and that's what we inherit that's what we inherit is the word and in the time of strain in the time of perplexity in the time of distress in the time of perilous time they found comfort and keeping the word the word is god's comfort isn't that right hallelujah when you know that you can walk down even to the valley of the shadow of death and know that god said so you can't say why the pastor said it the church said it you can say god said so and that's the comfort we get that is where i can find comfort now that is where you found your comfort he that believeth in me though he would dead yet shall he live whosoever lives and believeth in me shall never die believers doubt this it's the comfort we get from god's word noah had met god he heard god he had god's word so it didn't make any difference what anyone had said noah had god's word so it was a comfort to him when the critics would come and was going on what they were doing criticizing him we laughing at him it was enough to discourage him everybody coming back and saying look up in the hill that fanatic what the hell sitting what he's building what kind of outfit is that what is the business out of it's nonsense yet the comfort noah had because it was god's word it was a comfort he knew god said so noah had a consolation that while he was building this while he was making this act he knew that he was comforted because he had the word of the lord that told him that's the instructions what if someone said noah what do you mean by building that ultra gopher wood you know that would if there would water it would first thing it would sink but noah was following instructions god said go forward god eat believe it go for wood watch this go they tell him go forward and pitch in him he said go forward rather continue and keep walking until we further revelation come to put pitch in that now if god one day argue with god god this were there good this would have this the word and he complaining and complaining you see he he something wrong with noah but no bullet would go forward because i was so absorbent to get the pitch because god given revelation after revelation in his timing when you have reason to see it when you have reason to know it when you have reason for it to be unfolded to you he's going to unfold it so you have to lock god's neck for something oh glory to god he will reveal it he's going to unfold it he's going to confirm it he's going to manifest it he said it oh glory to god amen all right you love him this morning oh glory to god moses had a responsibility of two million people when he let him out of egypt how he's going to feed two million people women pack a little bunch and kneaded bread on top their head for 40 years of their journey how he's going to feed them how many babies could be born each night in a group of people like that how many all and in film how many clothes will wear out where will i get clothes where will i feed them he said mo they said god said so surely i'll be with you god had to tell him i will send manner god was arranging everything up front or give the lord a shout we just have to walk in obedience and god going to open up the windows of heaven and bless you all glory to god hallelujah glory to god thank you lord jesus hallelujah all these heroes but abraham says they could look back and see where the one kept the word and was comforted and this one he looked back and seen he followed the word and come out and was comforted it was promised but listen brother one day that word was made flesh oh glory to god that's it that word was made flesh that comforting word that word of comfort was made flesh hallelujah in the form of a man the word of god that brought comfort was made a man here among us we could handle the word in our hands we could shake hands with the word of god he was the word in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word is made flesh and well among us that word was god was made flesh the comforter he lived on earth we see that he was the word he acted like god he looked like god he preached like god he he like god he was god in every manner he was god hallelujah what a comfort it was to those galileans oh my and then they see him go up to calvary the son of man go up jerusalem put hands in hands of sinful men how could they stand it their heart was broken they were really depressed they was all in gloom isn't that right but then look at the promise he made i will not leave you comfortless oh glory to god i will not leave you comfortless i will pray the father he will send you another comforter oh glory to god which is the holy ghost and he will abide with you forever so first the only word word word word word then the word will become flesh i know the word made flesh prophesy i will not give you comfortless but i'm gonna come to you the person coming to you know i am going to come to you so my person coming to you know some bishop some message pope no i will come to you or give the lord a shout it's the same eye that told abraham i will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life and savior shall have a son or give the lord a shout it was no man coming it was power coming dynamics coming the holy ghost coming oh give the lord a shout no wonder jesus told them behold i send the promise of my father upon you but carry me to jerusalem until you be endured power from on high power then what is that word today what is our comfort today is when we receive the baptism of the holy ghost and the power of the living god living in us what i'll read it again what is the word of god what is our comfort today is when we receive the baptism of the holy ghost and the power of the living god lives in us that is when the word of the living god we stand that word is made flesh and dwelt among us now that same word that was made flesh and dwelt among us has become our flesh he is with you now but he shall be in you now that same word that the prophet spoke that same word that are made flesh that same word dwells in the church therefore if we don't compromise that word we stay right with it if we don't compromise it that same word living in you will produce the same thing that it did when he was made flesh because your flesh holds it your flesh holds it don't remember the word was invisible until it became flesh so how a man could claim the word made flesh word in him calling him and not a sign or a wonder you wonder about that that's the only one they'd have you know you wonder how that could be as they claim so it means that the claim is false because when omnipotent speaks the miraculous take place and miraculous is the confirmation of omnipotence that's the only way he knows omnipotence a man standing talk and talk and explain and explain he could say for us that don't have to be omnipotent speaking that could be a head intellect running like crazy but when now nibbled and speaks that is logos hallelujah the fire of god speaking the word of god hallelujah then miraculous must take place oh hallelujah what abraham said almost again therefore if we don't compromise with that word we stay right with it if we don't compromise it the same word living in you will produce the same thing that it did when it was made flesh because your flesh holds it that's the reason visions can break through the song barrier that's the reason a vision can break through time barry and say thus here the lord it shall be so and so that's the way it is what is it the word coming forth from a spirit you see me you do not see me you see my body you don't see me i don't see you because i only see your body this is my hand but who is me that owns the hand this is my buddy but who is me it's a spirit and if i'm born again if you are born again it is god's holy spirit god's word living in us and if we compromise don't compromise upon this word and say [Music] if we compromise upon this word and say we have the spirit of god how can we claim to have god's spirit when god's spirit testify of his own word that is why when the holy spirit told the prophet pick a pen and write he said no one can make the bride do otherwise so they could talk they talk and walk the talk but they can't make the baby otherwise because she have dust saved the lord or she keeps still you hear what he might have not an interpretation you know just say the lord or keep still so the bride could find god said so god said so god says oh your pastor says so that he say so but i want to hear what god say oh glory to what does the bible say oh hallelujah isn't that right so watch he will never move an inch from it no matter what denominations say or he's going to move from it when it's god's own word i'll be with you the comforter you shall send the comforter and they gather in the upper room and they wait a dear until the day of pentecost isn't that right for precept must be upon c precept isaiah 28 and he that's what he said he would do paul referred to the epistles of man with other lips would he speak to the people and when the holy spirit came it came exactly with the word and when it comes again here we go when it comes out again when it moves into a church that's born again it will come with the power and demonstration of its being not more talk we had 50 years of mechanics 50 years of revelation teachers ministries 50 years of man in the hour and who super and one more revelation and mighty teacher and nobody could teach like them and nobody could apostle like them and nobody could evangelize like them and nobody could profit like them whatever it is all that passed for 50 years but you see this here when the holy ghost comes it comes with the power and demonstration of its being not a man by the purpose sorry number six is out it's being oh glory to god he talked about the thunders coming forward he said he is him moving in and out and then you're worshiping the living christ him moving in and out among you i know man man the pulpit plain messiah i'm playing god hallelujah hallelujah play in the holy ghost hallelujah think about it now only man couldn't be holy she's a pope and that's a liar oh hallelujah man playing holy ghost holy ghost is the holy ghost it's not right don't shut yourself up in the cells of some organization like a seller somewhere an unbelief to the nine gods word i don't care what the bishop or anybody say let the word come in you made flesh by the power of the holy ghost and take over your flesh and control you and testify through you the works and the mighty powers of the living god that's right no matter what the churches say those denominations only put you in a cellar and you are hiding himself from the blessed sunlight i know that to be the truth do you want to stay in that cellar nobody does don't get in that cellar come out in the sunlight come out where the word can take the word and believe the word and the word will manifest itself to you and manifest itself through you and manifest his word bringing it to pass if we expect god to keep his word if we expect god to do the things for us that we are asking we will never be able to do it till we get back and obey what god said we have got to go back where we left off at we have got to go back to pentecost how much time the prophet said that what is he talking about you know the word seals the breaking of the seals back to pentecost the seals come to bring us back to pentecost because the seals was the scattered word that he had to tie up and bring it tight up into the wood to bring down the holy ghost so this breaking of the seals was not because he seals as a mystery are we so beyond pentecost right now you know it come like saying we don't need justification because i was looter we don't need signification that was wrestling we don't need pentecostal experience that was pentecost we just need a word oh yeah the word is consist of justification sanification and the holy ghost the word consists of all of that so you can't say because you have the word you don't need justification you have to be justified as if you never did this you have to be sanctified god god wants a holy life yeah god god ain't coming to unsung divine vessel you have to be satisfied so you need wesley you need looter you need pentecost you need your whole thing is i will restore in four stages oh glory to god hallelujah isn't that right luther justification where's the signification the pentecostal but from the holy ghost and the protagonist brought the word elijah the word come to the prophet isn't that right no we have the word now we can see what the stature is of a perfect man now we can see what perfection is now we can see what the vision is and fit everything into the vision oh glory to god so tight devil can't move you you're seeing now we could press towards the mark of the high calling because we see the mac now the only time he wasn't seeing no mark you see in church but when you see the mark of the eye calling then you know where you're pressing on to then you know what you could there onto then they're gonna always get locked in onto they get focused oh glory to god when you're not focused here everywhere everywhere everywhere everywhere everywhere no focus you can't hit the targets at all when you're shooting arrows every successful business everybody who i've achieved have somebody who have the pinpoint focus you're all focused where you're going you have to have focus hallelujah i think was the guy who was working on the light when they had a light bulb how much how much wrong thing he made how much how much mistakes how much how much things he try and whatnot eventually he hit it because he was convinced we could get light man we could get light hallelujah praise god i ain't trying the first the first time they woke up second time but you could get it he was working on light hallelujah next man working on the telephone he was here he could communicate man we could do this thing now if these guys didn't run ahead and make a way we couldn't be where we are right now with the phone if the right brothers then go ahead and say you know boy this this car thing we could get up in the air somebody have to try it of course the first thing crashed of course people laugh at them look at them but they're trying to play bird they tried to fly leave flying for birds but look at us now look how much plains in the a normal normal normal hallelujah why because somebody believed it could be done oh glory to god and god must have some spiritual scientists in this last day that believed this thing were going to be done but randomly all the mixtures he leave all the different chemicals and put it in the message it makes somebody to come and put this here my line up online take a little heat a little and shake it up here get a stir in here the bride had no revival yet it will take a manifestation of god to steal the bride he will send it he promised it there is going to be a prize revival i am so happy to be on the expectation for a revival or glory to god who want to be dead when you could get a revival oh glory to god oh you said whenever you have a strike jesus god wash the dishes oh glory to god hallelujah people don't talk about that another one would revive another mono would revive her i talk about what he said a revival is a move of god in power a move of who of god not a movement man he said god is suffering he have a right to start a revival he can stand a revival right here this morning oh glory to god with such a few people inside of here and you leave your soul revive and so charge up people want to know what happened to you oh glory to god hallelujah thank you lord jesus let's continue a little bit now we believe that after a person being justified by faith he has peace with the lord jesus christ but it's possible that this same person could have habits such as drinking smoking doing things that he should not do filthy habits of the flesh then we believe that the blood of jesus christ sanctifies this person for the service of the lord and we believe in sanctification according to hebrews 13 12 where jesus also that he might sanctify the people with his own blood suffered without the gates and we believe that sanctification is taught in the new testament and meant for the believers through the new testament age which we are now living in we also believe that after the person has been sanctified the unclean habits are gone from the person he is a believer on the lord jesus christ his habits are gone we believe that then he is a candidate for the baptism of the holy spirit oh glory to god when i hear that terminology hallelujah becoming a candidate for the baptism of the holy ghost after justification after sanctification after heart has prepared made ready you're ready you are candidate for the baptism of the holy ghost go give the lord some praises hallelujah which comes as a filling for the believer and then when the believer many times i have taught it like picking up a glass out in the chicken yard justification is picking it up ready to use it with a purpose in heart that's what god does to the sinner he's still filthy then he is cleansed by the blood of jesus christ and the word sanctify is a compound word which means clean and set aside for service and in the old testament the altar sanctified the vessel it was set aside for service then we believe that the holy spirit is put in the same vessel in service that the holy spirit is not another step of grace but more of the same grace that fills the believer to the extent here we go that signs and wonders such as the apostolic gifts spoken of in first corinthians 12. the filling to the extent that it produces the signs wonders such as the apostolic gifts spoken in first corinthians 12 manifest themselves true disbeliever when the holy spirit comes in to take up the gift i believe that the scripture teaches that gifts and call in the world repentance that when we are born in this world we are sent here by one purpose that is of god and that before we even become adults while we were yet children the gifts that we have of god is in us then i want to say that again before we become adults while we were young children the gifts that we have of god is in us then and only the filling of the holy spirit put these gifts into operation but we have them in the beginning such as teachers and apostles and prophets and gifts of tongues nine spiritual gifts according to first corinthians 12. now we believe that these gifts are in operation today and they should be in every local church oh glory to god i trust you're being edified this morning now we believe in water baptism in iran tabernacle by mercy in the name of the lord jesus christ which is the apostolic teaching of the bible and all members of the commerce of commerce to the brahms who desire such i may at any time request to be immersed in the name of the lord jesus may consult the pastor and if they have repented and believe in the lord jesus christ the pastor will as soon as possible baptize them immediately this does bring them into the fellowship of the believers we believe that by water baptism we are brought into a fellowship but by the baptism of the holy spirit we are brought into the members being members of the body of jesus christ which is all over the world no man can make you a member of the body of christ the holy ghost is what does make you a member of the body of christ you could belong to a fellowship but it takes the baptism of the holy ghost to push you into that body and that body is a wrong word nobody can put you in and no man can't take you out oh give the lord a shout i feel good this morning hallelujah but by the baptism of the holy spirit we are being made members of the body of christ which is all over the world who is that spirit then what is the holy ghost it is christ in you the comforter and that's the holy spirit when the comforter has come he will do the same things that i've done while the comforter is in me i'll pray the father that he will give you another comforter isn't that right i will not be comfortless no that's the comfort of christ that is what the holy ghost is it's christ isn't that right praise the name of the lord do you love him this morning trust your amen worshiping him there amen revelation 15 3 says says and they sang the song of moses the servant of god and the song of the lamb saying great and marvelous that i works lord god almighty just untrue and i ways the king of saints do you see it the lamb the high priest holding his blood as an atonement and the mercy for our sins is the lord god almighty that is his present office that is what he is doing now pleading his blood for our sins but one day that lamb will become the lion of the tribe of judah he will comfort in power and glory to take his authority to reina's king he is the common king of this earth of course that does not say he's not king now for he is our king king of saints right no it's a spiritual kingdom it is not of this world system even as we are not of this world that's the reason we act different from the world our citizenship is in heaven we reflect the spirit here we go listen we reflect the spirit of the world of our rebirth where jesus is the king i want to say that again we reflect the spirit of the world of or rebirth where jesus is king we are not trinidadians we get delivered between that spirit america the spirit germany of the spirit england of the spirit is a spirit that's not the holy spirit holy spirit is the word here oh glory to god is one spirit one lord one baptism hallelujah oh glory to god amen praise god our citizenship is in heaven we reflect the spirit of the world or of our reboot with jesus king that is why our women don't dress in men's clothing or cut their hair or use those cosmetics and other things that the world likes so much that is why our men don't drink and smoke and carry on sin our dominion is the dominion over sin oh glory to god i feel good about that one tonight our dominion is dominion over sin and it is enforced through the power that is in the spirit of christ that indwells us every kingdom on earth is going to be torn down but ours will remain oh glory to god and we have been talking about the offices and the manifestation of the one true god beholding his glory in a scriptural study but he is not to be known intellectually he is known spiritually by spiritual revelation this same one who was known as jesus after the flesh went back to the pillar of fire but he promised he would come again and dwell among his people by the spirit and on the day of pentecost that pill of fire came down and it separated itself into tongues of fire upon each one of them what was god doing he was separating himself into the church giving all those men and women a part of himself he divided himself among the church was the holy ghost he's getting part of him oh hallelujah who would send another comforter who was with them the disciples already but not in them that was christ then in verse 23 speaking of himself and the father he said we will come there it is the spirit is coming the same spirit of god that manifests as father and a son will yet manifest in many one god who is spirit that's why no man can ever come along and say the holy man is a pope or the holy man is a bishop or priest the holy man is christ the holy spirit in us how dare the iraqi declare the laity has no word to say each one has something to say each has a work each has a ministry the holy ghost came at pentecost and separated itself from each that it might be fulfilled way of christ said at that day you shall know i am in the father even me and i and you the great i am the almighty god has come a spirit to fill his true church he has a right to move any way he wants give the lord some praises he has a right to do what move anywhere he wants and upon anybody he wants to or give the lord some praises oh glory to god nobody can tell god don't move here don't move here don't bless that one here don't anoint that one here oh glory to god i think what condition you in god can still come to you he promised i will come to you oh glory to god i will not leave you comfortless you see your tears you see your prayers oh hallelujah he could come upon anybody he wants to we don't make any holy men among us but the whole true congregation of the lord is holy because of the presence of the holy spirit it is he the holy spirit that is holy not the congregation in itself oh my hallelujah these things say that faithful and true witness now i want to show you what i thought in the thought of the faithful you know we often talk about the great unchanging god whose word does not change when we speak of him after that manner we often get a view of him that makes him seem very impersonal and as though god made the whole universe all the laws that pertain to it and then stood back and became a great impersonal god it is as though god made a way of salvation for lost mankind and the way being the cross and then when the death of christ had atoned for sins his resurrection given us a door to him just folding his arms stood back it is as if we measured and believe in a great creator who haven't created and lost personal interest in his creation now i say that this is how too many people are apt to think but that is wrong thinking for god is governing in the affairs of men right now hallelujah he is both creator and sustainer colossians 1 16 for by him were all things created that in heaven that are in earth visible and invisible whether it be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things were created by him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist oh could we take some more he is a sovereign god by his own counsel he purposed the plan of redemptive salvation for his own elect which he foreknew the son died upon the cross to establish the means of salvation and the holy spirit carefully executes the will of the father he is working all things at this moment according to the purpose of his own will he is right in the midst of it all he is in the midst of his church can we give a shout hallelujah glory to god hallelujah he is in the midst of his church you know which churches jesus said jesus say upon this rock punch i will build my church all these churches oh god oh god you know jesus christ jesus said upon this rock of revelation i will build my church so that might just be talking about is jesus church that's not the building oh that's the body of christ he's the head of the body called the church you know head of somebody in especially in africa somewhere america in england or south america somewhere no he's the head of the body called the church so where did head man come from now where are the headquarters now that when he headquarters have been heaven so anytime you see head man we know something wrong it's a man who's trying to cross himself oh glory to god hallelujah praise god that man who called himself king he can't wait for salamat to be crying you take it first oh hallelujah praise god hallelujah go on and and fixing myself with with krongan king and god ordained solomon to be the king next minute david had a call for the prophet nato called for the priests to go on anoint solomon and proclaim to be king oh glory to god it had to be anointed you know oh hallelujah and then placed you know so weird still god begin to anoint a real fightful ministry all them who claim and

from all that shyness and all this bashfulness and whatever bring him in to be a mighty warrior because the end is how god saw him not the beginning or give the lord a shout not who he was but who we will be oh glory to god shall we look like nobody hallelujah we have no big listen you are nobody but what god sees at the end oh i wonder what god sees this morning my god the holy spirit carefully execute the will of the father he is working all things at this moment according to the purpose of his own will he is right in the midst of it all he's in the midst of his church this great creator savior god is faithfully working among his own right now as the great shepherd of the sheep his very existence is for his own i'll never leave you i'll never shake you better be with you take comfort

eyes ever upon them wherever you go he's looking out for you oh glory to god harley who much devils he pushed outside hallelujah angels drop them in front of you and chop this one aside and push someone aside to make a way for you oh you should be praising god right through oh glory to be called is elect to be called is love all glory to god my beloved glory to god hallelujah thank you jesus and we will back it up he said philippians 1 6 being confident of this very thing that he which had begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of jesus christ he's a true witness and this word true is the same word we saw back in revelation 3 7 you recall it is not true as in contrast with false it has a richer deeper meaning by far it expresses perfect realization in contrast to partial realization now back in philippian age the coming of the lord was joy nine what great love that age manifested for him it reminds me of those beautiful words in first peter 1 8 whom having not seen ye love in whom though now you see him not yet believe him you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory with them we rejoice also we haven't seen him but we have felt him we know him now as much as our limited senses can let us but one day hallelujah it will be face to face this is for this age he is coming at the end of this age partial realization will be made perfect realization completed realization hallelujah we have been looking through a glass darkly but soon it will be face to face hallelujah we have been going from glory to glory and soon we'll be right into the glory and his glory we will shine we shall be like him isn't that wonderful amen we will be swallowed up in life then we will realize realization he is the faithful and true witness now we think of that word witness oh my he said the holy ghost is the witness to that the spirit bear record of the word isn't that right the world hated jesus it killed him but god loved him and he went to the father the proof listen that he went the father is that the holy ghost came if jesus had not been received of the father the spirit would not have come and that is found in sin john 16 he said nevertheless i tell you the truth it is expedient for you that i go away for if i go not away the comforter will not come unto you oh my but if i depart i will send him unto you and when he come he will reprove the world of sin and of righteousness and of judgment of sin because they believe not on on me of righteousness because i go to my father you see me no more of judgment because they have the prince of this world is judged the presence of the holy spirit in this world instead of jesus being here proves that jesus was righteous went to the father but also in sin john 14 18 i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you he sent the comforter he was the comforter he came back in spirit upon the true church he is faithful and the true witness in the midst of the church but one day he's going to come back in flesh again he will prove then who is the only wise potent potentiate oh my hallelujah i'm on the home stretch here now oh praise god why would we need the holy ghost today why would we need divine healing why would we need this and how would we need another pentecost we are all civilized they were too but you see if whatever it takes to begin with whatever god give them to begin with that must ever remain and the tactics of reasoning is what satan use and that is what he uses reasoning we know our enemy because our enemy no brethren i have let away from doctrine he said i've got to see this any enemy any person any church any organization any individual that reasons against one punctuation of god's word is your enemy anybody that said the holy ghost is real the enemy anybody say that the holy ghost is not the same and he's not the same yesterday forever enemy oh glory to god anybody i said you cannot have a personal appointment with the supernatural that's the enemy talking to you they want you to have a point appointment with the pastor in the church they want you to be church bond they don't want your flight like eagles because everybody have a personal appointment with the supernatural he said if you love me you will keep my commandments and i am the father not i am the pastor i am the father not i am the bishop i am the father not i am the apostle i am the pharaoh will come to you and manifest myself to you they say oh will that happen oh oh oh oh oh oh glory to god no fight falling saturday no no fightful inside idea no man is headed any this is father and son business oh glory to god five will have their part but this we're talking about you alone have to keep your appointment nobody else could keep that appointment but you oh glory to god you have to be dear you can't send anybody for that appointment oh my hallelujah no my praise god sorry i didn't i say we are whom shall be nothing wrong should be halfway through oh my this one i want to get to here talking about jesus by his faith in the word he can conquer both debt hell and the grave we know that god is god that perfect fit in god's perfect word he conquered everything he can come in contact with debt could not even stand in his presence listen to this beautiful sickness could not stand in his presence flowing from him was like rivers of virtue going out constantly and that's why i challenged some of the ministers show me a man on it right now that had to mention jesus christ not one they could talk what the talk and all the mystery talk but this is what we're talking about here rivers of virtue flowing constantly not rivers are torque not rivers of revelation not rivers of interpretation i'm not talking about that not rivers of teaching sickness could not stand in his presence flowing from him him was the rivers of virtue going out constantly virtue going from his garments these people laying in his shadows put their finger on his garment and was healed when the woman done that everybody wanted to touch his garment caused the scene that there was virtue going from him constantly flowing like rivers of water he that believeth on me as the scripture had said out of his belly shall flow rivers of even water this specie of the holy ghost that was not yet oh glory to god hallelujah praise god is this the bible is this the word this is the bible we could take what we preached and put it right back inside the bible say if somebody came to the mercy of jesus christ where is the virtue flowing like rivers of living water where is sickness being challenged oh glory god that is what they're saying here rivers flowing constantly and now we say if he abided me and he brought the word to you and my words abide in you then walk in the same way virtues flowing from you the rivers of god fountains of blessings just flowing out to the people see what i mean you're not bluffing it you are not imagining it it's actually taking place i'm still reading can't bluff this thing there's not after service handles on books and tapes this is not that playing tips and no votes you flowing out that's not what we talking about you can't give what you don't have you might not have it to give it oh we can give revelation this is a vindicated message we can get explanation we could get quotes we can repeat scripture and court but this there is no impersonation to this oh give the lord a shout let me say it again there is no impersonation to this no impersonation virtues flew in from you the rivers of god's fountains of blessings flowing out to the people see what i mean you're not bluffing it you're not imagining it it's actually taking place and you see if you just imagine it it won't don't do any good but if it is really there it really happened oh that's some perfect faith you see instead of a human being it was a super super superhuman being and that makes a super being not only a human being but he's a son and daughter of god of the super super super super life that was in him comes back upon you and changes you from a sinner and the seal of the world a church member nomination of god are born again christian filled with the spirit and the life of god is flowing from you like sparks of an anvil as you walk full of virtue and love and gentleness as the holy spirit moving and speaking oh my there you are hearing the message watching the pillar of fire and blessed assurance have passed some debt onto life it's not wonderful this morning lust for money lots of big things lust for popularity these things are dead to the believer we don't care tend to cut it why should i care live or die sink or drown this is the thing that i'm interested in the kingdom of god whether i maintain my home whether i maintain my family whether i maintain whatever let me maintain christ our hope of glory build me up oh lord into this for the ministry now let christ be my head working through me on my foundation my feet that's in him let virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness and brotherly kindness work in me oh lord is my prayer i don't care live or die sink or drown drone denomination or no denomination friend or no friend minister friend or no minister friend message friend or no message friend friend or no friend let that work in me let christ's virtue his knowledge flow out that i might be able to teach those so for his virtue to flow out we have to have it for it to flow out not teach out flow out that i might be able to teach so the correct teaching will come from the virtue power powered by the virtue of christ oh my not my intellect not by understanding and just knowledge but by the virtue of christ for god has set in the church apostles prophets teachers pastors and evangelists all for the perfecting and here we go this is a big one and bringing all these virtues into it to that perfection of the coming of the son of god because what was revealed son of man according to luke 17 30. what after what happened after son emmanuelli in new testament after jesus came son of god spirit keep making the upper room so son of man come back again according to luke's literary what happened the next son of god spirit come back to the sons of god and these virtues to be brought into the people hallelujah by a fightful ministry they can't preach that into the people no it has to be there to flow out oh not something there each one of these stones are materials that that one this is a material of this each one of these virtues belong to him are gone oh my thank you lord so jesus we know he said mark you said have faith in god for very like sin to you if you shall say to this mountain be moved and be those cast in the sea have no doubt in your heart you shall have what those things would you seek on the past okay so you give the two pull first then you go into the second point therefore when i say whatever things you desire when you pray believe you receive them you shall have them and then you come down to the first pool when you stand praying forgive if you have against any so let's reverse it now before you could ask you have to be able to forgive so you could forgive then they could ask then they could get to the next step that you could speak isn't that right so then barbara said this if you do not forgive neither will your father which is heaven forgive your trespasses faith is based on forgiveness so once you have your horse in your grudges pack up stuck up like if it's our investment you know we have no faith working there at all you're struggling you believe the word but forgiveness is not really prominent it's not dear in front there faith is based on forgiveness then and then as we said this morning trying to get the church into a place where we could really see apostate times moving among us that's what we all hunger it's just laying right at the door we see it but we want to see more of it we want it to flow that to help us flow out to others so this must be our desire that we could be so yielded and surrendered with the spirit of forgiveness you know just what happened to brotherly kindness what happened on top brother christ is what holy spirit so true brotherly kindness you have access to holy spirit because i take faith to bring down the holy spirit so god put brotherly kindness the top of this age put at our virtue the virtue of this age is broadly kind of spirit of forgiveness and so enough hatred so would have jealousy and envy and sometimes when somebody jealous and envy god help them oh my just mess up the spirit they message they believe the word they're preaching all kind of thing like that but they messed up there's no faith to access holy spirit remember jesus as we had the lesson this morning he never used his power for himself he used it for others and that is what he was sent for and you think sometime why would a man that was so full of power like him would have to be sick i read in a book somewhere where he was raised up the boy the widow's son from name and the prince of house of david he sat on a rock and grown with a headache he bore over infirmity bear means to pack them see he had sickness from jesus oh my hallelujah he had sickness he had temptations he had trouble he had frustration so do you have temptations do you have trouble do you have frustration jesus had it too all right just as we have because he had to be the right kind of a mediator so he had to be a partaker the husband of the fruit isn't that right now the new birth you have the new birth by being believing on the lord jesus christ by having faith accepting him as their savior that's burt because you're apart from death in the life he that heareth my words and believe it on him and sent me has everlasting life see he's got life because he believes that's the same group that had to go to pentecost to be baptized with the holy ghost hallelujah holy ghost is power facilities all right where you are say powerful service right in your house a powerful service not joining church power for service holy ghost is powerful service so when talk that you have to be born again and apply that to the holy ghost many of the methodists and so forth are wrong there it cannot it won't cope with the scripture you get things sideways you receive the new word after this no you receive power acts on it after the holy ghost has come upon you they had already believed eternal life and so forth but they had they had to have the holy ghost for power what the holy ghost is for say power power in your house power power to pray power to overcome power to forgive power to repent power to make things right holy those come to give you power oh glory to god amen so watch they had to have holy ghost for power you shall be witnesses unto me after the holy ghost has come upon you because the holy ghost is a witness of the resurrection showing that you have become an adult in christ i think that word reading again because the holy ghost is a witness of the resurrection showing that you have become an adult in christ he that heareth my words and believe in him that sent me hat present tense everlasting life and shall not come to judgment but is passed from death unto life the holy spirit is an experience of being filled and endured with power for service the holy spirit is not an understanding it's not a knowledge and then a book being read the holy ghost the holy spirit is an experience of being filled and endured with powerful service one more time the holy spirit is an experience of being filled and endured powerful service but confession and receiving christ is to have faith and make a confession and feel free that god has forgiven you of your sins but the filling is what put you in service oh my hallelujah when peter went to the corners house the baby said why peter speak these words before they were baptized while people speak these words the holy ghost fell upon them why why why don't you fall upon them why here the reason why because they were all on the expectation now you are on the expectation you will god will seal you into the kingdom of god something that'll be real to you so you have to be on the expectation so if the ministers if the pastors don't preach the holy ghost and to put the people on the expectation how could they receive the holy ghost how could they get the holy ghost they think they have it already and they got it to get oh glory to god baptist doctrine come back again you have it because you believe the message oh hallelujah but he said have you received since you believe he said they got the holy ghost why they were under expectation oh glory to god and revelation brings you under an expectation for manifestation water don't save a man it takes the blood of jesus christ there's no life in water life comes in the blood cell it takes sanctification to cleanse that life to kill the desire of sin then the holy spirit comes into that clean vessel and set it aside in work and service the altar sanctify the vessel but it's the filling that put us in his service it was set aside for service but now it's got to be put in service and the holy ghost puts the church in service oh my so why it is after 50 years we still hang our wrong in church think about it now because dynamics have to come to put the bride in service to put the bride in place to do what the bride's supposed to do oh glory to god that's why he said wait till the poor strike the church he said when the poor of this church rises it will bring the brethren oh glory to god when the poor vicious rises he said it's coming oh hallelujah if you don't believe that believe the vision he saw hallelujah man went down so good seeds isn't that right next man go and save so bad seed after him and then everybody's dry and dry and the lord sent us the rain sun as the rain everything's drying up tell us everybody jump up good bad ugly different everything jumping up why rain what happened right now with family land things dry oh glory to god church is empty hallelujah all over the world this man saw seeds all around the world all the same condition oh hallelujah dry everywhere oh glory to god but but there's going to be a people on the earth that should be under great expectation not expectation great expectation for the manifestation oh hallelujah god is a god of reality don't just take a creed don't take a sensation take a reality take real god is something god is a reality that gives you assurance it gives you hope it gives you faith it gives you the spirit it gives you signs it gives you wonders it does it just like it did in christ because that was his purpose of coming to bring god to man and make god and man one and when he comes in his power of his resurrection to make people live and act and behave themselves to change their attitudes to change their ways to change their living they don't want nothing to do with that they want to live just the way they want to live they want to continue right on living the way they live always can't work friends this whole thing is to bring a change oh my hallelujah ii peter one tree according to his divine power had given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that i call us to glory and virtue oh my all that ever would be in the world would be redeemed god go all that ever that would be redeemed god put their name on the lamb's book of life before the world ever come into creation and the antichrist in the last days is gonna be so close like the real thing the real church everything like judas was until it would deceive the very lick if it was possible but no man can come to jesus except god sends him and all that god did give to him will come to him and when he takes that book are you ready the last name see all in the lutheran age he pulled them out all in the wesley age he pulled them out all in different ages and the pentecostal age he pulls them out they're over deer won't be judged with them they are rapturing but when the last name comes out that was put on the lamb's book of life that was flamed from the front in the world when the last name has been redeemed not just put but redeemed his work is finished he comes forth to claim what he has redeemed that makes our heart bleed but it went on a thousand years later there will not be one more redeemed no one can be redeemed unless they want the lamb's book of light before the foundation of the world who are they i don't know nobody else knows just god alone i'm trusting that every one of us our names were on that book if mine was on there i'm sure to be there if it wasn't i won't be there that's all see that's up to god it's not him that will it him that run it but his god that she wet mercy my now listen the seed of the woman and bring it down show you what see that seed of the serpent moved on here we go listen this is important as we finish that seed of the serpent moved on and how that seed of the woman moved on how the seed of the serpent begin to predominate predominate get greater greater greater greater greater until there is nothing left but just a little small remnant of name still left written from the foundation of the world when i saw this i saw i that just gave me so rejoicing but when the body has been formed and the last name that was on the book will be recognized here on it i love the phrasing the books are closed for it is completed on this shortened path the story of redemption has been read completely all glory hallelujah hallelujah this redemption story adam lost adam fell lost the book and god purpose to restore the names was in the book throughout the ages god just getting the names out whoo escape ones escape ones devil causing havoc on the earth but god having mysteries and messengers pulling out the elect of every age when it comes to our age the last name oh glory to god when that name is pulled out the full story is is finished he said i like how his faith the story of redemption has been read completely hallelujah the book could not be closed oh glory to god you come to the end of the book and you close the book oh glory talk about thunder's lightning and voices oh give the lord i shout hallelujah then we go to see him and to meet him in the resurrection he that heard my words and believe it on him that sent me has eternal life shall not come into judgment but let's pass some death into life oh my when god himself okay let me skip down a little bit he said when the great spirit of god which is love god the great rainbow we could imagine how it looks like and just he looks like a rainbow them spirits the perfect spirit of love red blue the perfect spirit of fellowship all those perfect spirits and then they begin to condescend coming down and from failure agapo love to feel your love don't lust down to the lowest then god himself become man jesus and came down the same way to the lowest pits of hell and picked out those who he knew before the foundation of the world whose name were written on the book and redeemed them back to himself there you are the story of redemption cannot be fully known until we see him and stand his likeness and that is why we are not a denomination oh man if the baptist turned me down the method is the pentecostal upon the initial evidence speaking in tongues being the holy ghost and that's the reason we are not pentecostals we don't believe that speaking in tongues makes you feel with the holy ghost no man no more than believe living in a band would make you a big no sir no manner we believe living in a king's palace would make you a king because it doesn't you could be a servant oh hallelujah we believe that you receive the holy ghost by an experience not by mythical intellectual conception of the scripture but by an experience that you alone know and this receiver in the holy ghost does not annoy the quotation you could have the battery goes 24 hours and still be lost because the prophet said that but is where the person get that baptism oh glory to god hallelujah so that doesn't say no holy ghost because the prophet said you can have the holy ghost of baptism and still be lost 24 hours a day hallelujah the baptism of the holy ghost is a personal experience if your name is in the land book of life you will walk in the light you will see the light and god will reveal it and you will walk in it now what i'm not saying i'm not taking you back to my church yeah i am not taking you back to a church i am taking you back to the bible what did paul say if an angel from heaven preached any other thing let him be a curse oh my hallelujah this church is sovereign it is sovereign in itself we have no bishops we have no general overseers we have jesus he's the bishop he's the general overseers he's a head pastor he's the king he's the lord isn't that right now watch no man can do it no other person no matter how good you are it's got to be revealed to you then you see who jesus is here's the predestinated plan in plain view just as other seed the word of god is a seed and i know you're going to rejoice on this one and must have the grumpy pier beforehand if you sowed seed and just straight out there on the ground it will do no good the birds will pick it up you throw it among tissues and tones they will choke it out pretty soon jesus parable said so the ground has to be made ready first here we go are you ready god in sovereign grace prepares the heart first he prepared you he prepared you before the foundation of the world to receive him in this age so you are not know being ppm he prepared you before the foundation of the world to receive him in this age he foreknew you by his full knowledge and ordain you to eternal life he knew you therefore he prepared you and that is the reason you staggered out of these things and staggered into what you have now it was god leading you to the place where your dinner to be he prepared your ground beforehand we'll give the lord some praises hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah praise god oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah glory to god that's about three more pages and we're going to close oh glory to god better give you god by the music music oh my oh my hallelujah so he christ was god's wheat that had been raised from the dead he was god's first fruit of them that slept he was god's sheath hallelujah and because he was the first son of god to come to maturity to be god he was plucked from the earth and waved over the people remember the old testament when they get the first sheep that was mature the priesthood come before the lord and wave it and it's a testament that others come in lord i bring the first fruit to you the first one that comes to maturity is being waved it's a testimony others come in just like this one coming here oh glory to god and jesus he was the god's first fruit of them that slept isn't that right hallelujah he was with uttar pentecos when there came a song from heaven like a wave in russian mighty wind was brave over the people the pentagons are people that was in pentecost waiting for the blessing to come and is to be wave again we realize in the last day are going to look something today wave how wave again the son of man again the son of man will reveal or wave again over the people why would god bring all these seals and all these revelations and all these messages to wave over the people first pull second pull to pull why would he wave it he waving it because others coming that's why the prophet said what you see manifested temporarily will be manifested in his fullness when the press come down that doesn't cancel out these signs shall follow belief we have to have sin mark 16 because he said the devil know assuredly that the true church is sin mark 16 not in the text not reading that scripture the true church is sin mark 16 in action go give the lord a shout hallelujah the lord himself went everywhere with them oh confirming the word signs one following isn't that wonderful praise god so watch so watch and according to luke 17 chapter 30 at first malachi 4 different scriptures that we are acquainted with that the word again is way over the people what word that the dead traditions of man is dead and the son of god is alive again with the baptism of the holy ghost right among us and giving us life he's like he's not talking about pentecost baptism you know what's speaking in tongues and they're crazy really crazy money god splitting he's talking about the real holy ghost it's not right christ was the first one to raise from all the prophets and so forth isn't that right there will be a chief wave again in the last days waving at the sheath what was the sheath the first one that come to maturity the first one has come to mature the first one that proved it was a wheat it was wave hallelujah i am sure that you see what i'm talking about it was way over the people and the first time they will come forward for the bright age for resurrection out of dark denominationalism will be a message hear the message that the full maturity of the word has turned back again to its full power and being waved over the people by the same signs and wonders hallelujah what did the prophet say in 1965 he said our faith isn't ripe enough oh glory to god our faith is intellectual he said the faith that they get right that means faith is not just faith faith could be intellectual faith have to ripen faith could grow faith could be increased so he's talking about the time will come when that faith will be so powered up it will go to virtue it will go to knowledge it will go to temperance it will go to patience it will go to godliness it will go to brotherly kindness i will tap into the source itself of the holy spirit isn't that right hallelujah he said oh man it was god's quickening power he was waved to them the word which he was was waved back to them on the day of pentecost the word made manifest hallelujah praise god hallelujah he said we put too much stress on the mechanics nothing on the dynamics it needs the dynamic power of god the resurrection paul of jesus christ upon the church to manifest and to bring the past this is gasoline it might be a gasoline can but it could still be water so somebody say they have gasoline saturday because they can outside say gasoline actually they paint on gasoline cyanide what you have in that can and let's strike the match and push it on earth and when you're slightly matched and nothing happens you know your eye water fully man hallelujah if it's gasoline it's blowing up that's the proof it's gasoline he said it might as well be water isn't that right he said watch let me say again we put too much stress on the mechanics nothing on the dynamics hallelujah praise god oh glory to god i wonder like he passes phrase the dynamics boy you don't want to talk about it because the law you see you see dynamics takes it out of man's hand let me say that again dynamics takes it out of man's hand man could make declaration and make prophecy and say who is shocked and who out of it and cut this one off and say this one is this a nigerian but when dynamics come waiting what do with jesus he said with small miracles and build right up you know what floor them when lazarus is reasonably dead when he finished with that resurrection they say old man go up there let me call a conference let me have minister association they all come from one time because they don't continue that's a church finish everybody will follow that man and that's where they get their money and they change the city they pull judas and sarah could bribe somebody and think to sell him out and what the holy oh hallelujah now remember judas and make it to the upper room he make it in the preaching part he make it in the teaching part he make it under jesus ministry he make it with the books and tapes he makes us make it happen church but he didn't make it to the dynamics think of it he didn't make it to the upper room only elected made it up there oh what i think jesus stopped him from preaching the whole time he was preaching he said new season new time hallelujah wait yeah they get this power now you know because he pressed command the congregation is coming down and they can't tell if you believe the message that can't work they'll lock you up they go shut you up oh glory to god but when you see the power come they can't lock up and shut you up oh glory to god you forget the god of the open prison those are what hallelujah the god of power you know remember god going to display this bright you know you have anybody in the corner just as god was unveiled he could pull the rope over this bride this is my wife here see how we could do about this oh glory to god didn't god tap the devil and say come come come here man why his check out his name is job there's none here like him there where you going he said two and four all in here he's about to miss this one here oh come here check this one out he said but i see he put the heads around this man he says not because i want to put that around him it's what in him hallelujah i know what i put in him god knew what joe was made of sin before the foundation of the world so you could tell the devil you could watch but you can't you can't change that man and make him curse me oh glory to god and when job gets stripped so and stripped and strip and strip oh my hallelujah he was still standing is not something so watch he said no what he said it needs the dynamic power of god the resurrection power of jesus christ watch upon the church to manifest and to bring the past that this is gasoline it might be in a gasoline can it could still be water but see the only proof of it is to put the life on it and prove whether it is gasoline or not oh my when you try to put the holy spirit in a denomination you get a splutter you ruin your engine full of carbon i'm so glad there's a ten thousand octane power the word of god and the holy ghost to light it up and resurrect the power of god into a man's life or a woman's life into a church that will show that cousin like don under the dynamic of the holy ghost which came backhand and waved over the people on the day of pentecost isn't that right there was the first sheave come upon the prophets which was the son of god the king of all the prophets there have been churches churches brides brides
