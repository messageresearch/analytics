TRANSCRIPT
========================================
us have spoken about this both within the old testament and the new and it would be remiss of us in such a time as this to be ignorant of what's happening and for us to have the opportunity to put things in place so that we can be stronger christians our confidence and our courage should be based on the fact that we have an understanding that he who started to work in us is more than able to complete it and the seed of the word that's planted in our souls itself has its has the power to reproduce itself so we have to trust um in our destiny in our destination and trust um in who has brought us and carried us through um i don't know how it's been with you from a spiritual perspective i trust that um not only are you enjoying the different services and that you are participating and different studies and stuff like that but beyond that you're also taking your own time to commune with god and commune with the wood in your secret closet and taking that time to slow down you know sometimes the peace of life could be so fast so then when you're stuck in traffic i don't know if you haven't had this experience you're stuck in traffic something happens on the highway and for some reason you can't move and then you notice things on the street that you know you have never noticed before you're passing that road every single day and it's only because you're at a halt you said i recognize the tree the sign the building the color somebody painted the house you didn't realize you was paying because you you become used to just flying past it on the way to wherever you you know were planning to go but because your life gets stopped you get to slow down to reflect a thing to meditate to ponder to discover to explore to analyze to critique to look into the world to look at your life plan to see where you are at um what have you achieved not just any spiritual but even in a natural you know many times we look at things and and as a church and brother ryan was very clear um when he in many different places he referenced the theme that god is interested in every aspect of your life um if he was not interested in every aspect he would not have provided gold and a fish so that the disciples could pay their taxes and that was not a spiritual situation it was a financial one it was one that was meeting the need of the law of ilan as it were and god had a direct interest in ensuring that they could render unto caesar what is caesar he was had a direct interest you know when he was preaching to them and they were hungry that they could take five loaves and two fishes and they could be fed because he was not just interested in their in their spiritual sustenance but that they had food and and they were able to grow and they were able to take care of their bills and meet their needs and all these things and there is also now with this uh no excuse because god gives us the ability to do certain things and we have to be very careful that we don't waste the time that is given to us you know and um but over many times you would have heard but over preach that luck is when opportunity meets preparation and as you look at what is happening on a global scale i i don't know if i said it in this in this room i told somebody recently i am zoomed out last week friday i had eight zoo meetings back to work i was trying to figure out if i was living in zuma outside of zoom so i'm not sure if it was in this room or another room where i was making reference to the fact that zoom this same technology we are using right now the value of this company called zoom is now worth more than the world seven or the us seven largest airlines combined i want you to process that for a second so when you add up american airlines to delta airlines so to these top seven airlines add them all together zoom this technology that we're using right now is worth more than all seven put together and it is it is not that it was zoom's plan to be in that place it is simply that the situation changed the opportunity presented itself and zoom was ready and just as in the natural preparation can meet opportunity is the same way in the spiritual what we are doing is preparation to meet the opportunity and the opportunity for us presents itself in the form of an open door the opportunity presents itself for us as a space of grace the opportunity presents itself to us as another chance the opportunity presents to us as another day the opportunity presents to us as as god giving us a a a space of grace as it will to do what may not have been done before and the reality is as as as those who may be more digitally inclined than others would see that because of what zoom was able to accomplish facebook was scrambling to to do something similar google scrambling but it was already too late zoom's position has been established until it is the next pandemic or the next economic situation or whatever it is to change the way business would would exist zoom's place has been solidified because opportunity met preparation and i want to encourage us in this to see the opportunities because we have been preparing the preparation has not been now in the zoom all these years we have been coming to church has been preparation all of the books these scriptures your life experiences have been preparing us and the reality is our preparation should show it should show in how we speak our preparation to chew and how we act our preparation should show and how we live how we deal with situations situations that should have bothered us before or may have bothered us before just don't bother us as much not that we don't care not that it doesn't bother us but the way we deal with it has changed we learn to value more important things we learn to cherish more important things things that we may take for granted we realize that we can't take these things for granted anymore so this is my way of introduction by way of encouragement to us as a church as a group of believers and understanding that um you know peter said it that god has given us all things that pertain both to life and to godliness and many people miss this because you could end up so super spiritual that you missed the part about life and this issue of life and i remember years ago i spoke a message to the young people in particular and i may have referenced it on sunday about between sundays and i was making that that distinction that that that sunday is like a major mark in our lives because it's that day when we carve out time as it were to to recalibrate and to spend time with god and to look at the world and see what to do next and and and there is this between sundays that exist on a monday on a tuesday and a wednesday and a thursday on a friday on a saturday when the issues of life as it were would increase and the battle would become more fierce and the intensity and the temptation and the struggles sometimes can feel as if they are too much to bear but within that period we understand that he gives grace to us to be able to weather it so i want to do a little bible study for a few minutes um and you know then we could get into prayer and the theme would be leading to a figure that we know in scripture that that that's that's prayer but i want to kind of look into his background i i shared a scripture you know somebody shared it with me and and and and i did some more study and i started to it that'll blew my mind um and i i said in a meeting yesterday you cannot exhaust the bible it kind of exhausts you would the more you look at it is the more you discover new things so um i know everyone would know the story of daniel um or at least about daniel i don't know who has done an in-depth study of daniel um but there's so much in there i want to pull some things out of there tonight for us before we get into prayer tonight and uh i want to call it a study of daniel part one because it is impossible to even touch scratchy surface in in a month on how much stuff is in there so ride with me tonight before we get into prayer and we all know uh the story of daniel and alliance then and all that so i want to kind of build up to that a bit and pass through a few things and really pause as i give the example of driving down the road and you end up at a hall so you get to look at it a little closer so danielle's story is a story of an exile he is an unwilling immigrant i'll i'll get to reading some scriptures in a bit and and in fact before i get into let's just borrow heads one more time heavenly father as we approach this sunday school tonight with your church lord as we look through the scriptures and through your prophet's message and we have a little talk tonight oh family alter family conversation lord with those that are near and dear to us who lord we are united not in one physical place but we are united where it matters most we are united in spirit and heart and faith and focus lord in our desire to be changed should be different to be transformed to make the rapture to lay aside every weight that so easily beset us and we are needy people we are needy for food for our souls we are needy for are touching our bodies we are needy for strength to continue to press this journey this battle that you dropped us into we didn't take the battle but the battle was here before we got here but we accept the challenge we accept the the the obstacles and the situations knowing that you will never give us more than we can bear so may you bless our effort tonight may you bless the this gathering the lord the opening of the word to us that you reveal through your prophet and lord our time of prayer as we draw nigh unto you and you draw an eye unto us we commit it into your hands in the precious name of jesus christ amen amen so daniel's story is a story of an exile um we find in the book of daniel is not that daniel intended to be where he was um but he basically was moved forcibly moved from his homeland of israel across almost 1 000 miles of desert more than likely the way things were at that time he may have been roped or chained to several other of his kinsmen israelis possibly after witnessing the death of his parents or relatives or family as a result of the babylonian invasion that conquered the nation of judah in around 605 606 bc um we know that daniel is a book of prophecy it's a book of kings it's a book of kingdoms it's a book of powers it's a book that demonstrates god's power in world history there's so much in daniel that we speak and reference and it's really amazing how much is in the book of daniel the book speaks of kings that would reign in the time of daniel it doesn't stop there because daniel will interpret the dream that speaks of the kingdoms to come so it deals with the kings that will reign even up to the end time and it is in effect almost the parallel of the book of revelation so it is what the book of revelation is to the new testament the book of daniel would almost represented the old testament so it deals with issues that was specific to daniel's day and it would deal right down to the second coming of christ and it's a book of a young man it starts off as a young man who would purpose in his heart to live for god and the bible says in daniel 1 if you have your bibles and we're going to read a few verses there in the third year of the reign of jehovah kim king of judah came nebuchadnezzar king of babylon unto jerusalem and besieged it and the lord gave joachim king of judah into his hand so the lord allowed it to happen with part of the vessels of the house of god which he carried into the land of china to the house of his god and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god and the king spake unto ashbanez the master of his eunuchs that he should bring certain of the children of israel and of the king's seed and of the princes so this heathen king nebuchadnezzar is trying to find i guess people who could be in his court people who could add value to his kingdom people who could contribute something to his kingdom and he goes into a description of what he's looking for and it's really mind-blowing because we hear about danielle but for daniel to have even been recognized or the story of daniel and the hebrew boys this is the origin of it so the king course is the head of his eunuchs now if we understand scripture and the role of kings the kings would have these eunuchs you had to meet certain qualifications to even be allowed in the presence of the king and the queen and and and all these things and look at the description he instructed him to find children in whom was no blemish but well favored when you hear well favored it means that you could get along with people people favor you you know there are people that don't like the company you don't like to spend with them i heard somebody say some time ago everybody lights up a room some people lighted the room when they walk into the room some people light up the room and they walk out the room which one are you is it when you walk in your room the room light up or when you walk out your room your room light lighter but the king was very careful because you don't want any and anybody in his court so he said i want people with no blemish so it basically saying they must be looking good but well favored do they can get along with people and skillful in all wisdom now that's deep many times i've spoken through scripture and i say all is a powerful word all means all aldo means some so skillful in all wisdom and cunning in knowledge this is significant and understanding science so the king is not looking for people who don't want to pick up a book or study a craft or dough they they're not saying they're not playing games during the pandemic all they're doing is playing video games this is not what he's looking for all the really pandemic they they just want entertainment this is people who have already exhibited some level of discipline i want to touch on that because for you to be skilled in wisdom and cunning in knowledge and understanding science that is not genetic it is not hereditary it is disciplined to be there in the first place and such has has has had ability in them to stand in the king's palace now that is powerful because there are people who are so bright or so intelligent that they cannot stand in the king's palace because you have to know your place in the king's palace now i can speak a whole hour just on this one verse alone so he was looking for it's almost like he was looking for a resume format you're looking good you can get along with people you're not wasting your time you're interested in self-development you're interested in self-progress you're interested in advancement such had the ability to stand in a king's palace in the king's palace guests would come visitors would come the expectation in the king's palace is that you conduct yourself a certain way to be there because the kingdoms who want to be embarrassed when visitors come into the king's palace i want you to understand the ramifications of what these things mean and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the chaldeans so they're looking for young men who not only knew or had experience or had conduct or had favor but were also trainable that they could teach something too that is powerful and that's why we are here tonight i am a student i just happen to be a student who's also teaching but for me to teach i have to be a student to learn so our attitude when we come into church or in any encounter with anybody is what can i learn because i want to grow and if i ask a question tonight if this king this king nebuchadnezzar wanted people who was trainable wanted people who were already doing something for themselves wanted something for people who were interested in self-development don't you think god who is bigger than this natural king would want people who were interested in developing we're interested in progress interested in improvement interested in learning in this case he wanted them to learn the tongue and and the mitchie learning and the tongue of the childians isn't it appropriate to expect that god wants us to learn his tongue he wants us to learn how he speaks he wants us to learn his will he wants us to learn his thinking he wants us to learn his behavior so i want us to connect with this and the king appointed them a daily provision of the king's meat and of the wine that he drank so nourishing them for three years so after all of these qualifications had already been met they were going on a three-year apprenticeship so to graduate into the class to stand in a certain way in front of the king that at the end thereof of the three year period they might stand before the king now among these were of the children of judah which we know the children of judah is a tribe of royalty the kings came from the tribe of judah in so much that we call christ the lion the lion of the tribe of judah so if you were to type into the jungle the lion is the king of the jungle they give jesus the italian royal the lion of the tribe of judah so from the tribe of judah were four young men who met all of these characteristics i want you to appreciate the position of daniel in the fact that there would be no daniel if daniel didn't meet these criteria isn't this marvelous to see the selection of god the election of god now understand this before daniel could have been in that room danny would have never known what he was preparing for that's why i i i could bring the example all your years of coming to this was preparing you for something you didn't even know what you were preparing for so danielle doing his little school book daniel doing his little bible study daniel during his little prayer time not knowing that all of his preparation was creating a resume for himself that both in the natural and in spiritual he could be chosen for his mission anybody with me tonight and among these were of the children of judah daniel hannah hananiah michelle and azariah four men unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names for he gave unto daniel belteshazza and hananiah shadrach and adamitiel meshach and azariah so daniel and what we call the three hebrew boys had met this criteria of being young men who were trainable young men who stood out young men who understood science young men who understood wisdom can the church say amen so you see god loves to use people that he could train and use so i want to build a little bit if if you could ride with me a little bit the reason that they were even in that situation in the first place is because they the children of israel had backslid so god would allow babylon to conquer them now i don't have all the time tonight to get into it but daniel is a very very interesting character ancient babylon some of you may know is what we call modern day iraq in fact saddam hussein before he was taken out in when he was alive he was quoted to sing he is a modern day king nebuchadnezzar now when you begin to study the life of daniel daniel is an anomaly and there's a lot because we know daniel is the one who who who would have seen the who would have seen mysteries these seven thunders was revealed to daniel and when he was told to write it not daniel is the only character in scripture where there's a conversation with him talking about gabriel and michael he's like the only character in scripture who could reference on this interaction with michael and gabriel daniel is a unique character in scripture so he's young he's 16 years old and he would die at around 86 years old i was i was having a conversation these these comic strips about the bible and stuff really paying daniel as a young man in the lion's den but if you really study scripture then it would have had to be some argue early 80s or at least in the 70s any lions then that was not a boy in the lion's den and we can spend a whole hour going through that but daniel is unique he has a testimony he maintains his testimony because when you read down through it daniel purpose in his heart this is verse 8 continuing that he would not defile himself with a portion of the king's meat nor the wine which he drank now we would have heard this reference before but i want to highlight the fact that here is a young man now plays in a position where he has the best treatment he has the best attention the king assigns to him people to take care of him and he still has the integrity he still makes a decision to maintain his testimony he still makes a decision without anybody else around him save those other hebrew boys as it will and they unanimously decide that whatever is presented to us will not compromise what we know to be the truth what we believe to be the truth anybody with me so we are dealing with so i want to carry something through here because i would have addressed the church i think about two weeks ago about the discipline of the word and i'm seeing a pattern here in the life of both daniel and the hebrew boys but we are talking about daniel specifically it was discipline that would have led him to study it was discipline it takes discipline to bridle your tongue so to stand in the palace it takes discipline it takes discipline when the food is offered the meat and the wine it takes discipline to say no that discipline is separate from a spiritual condition i want to make the point because you can get disciplined from alcoholics anonymous somebody who has true struggles with alcohol you can get disciplined from alcoholics anonymous so discipline is separate from a spiritual encounter so i want to make the point that is why the bible can say present your bodies a living sacrifice holy and acceptable unto god it is your reasonable service because that is that reasonable service is a function of discipline the holy ghost comes to give you power but you don't have an excuse to be in discipline i want to make the point because people many times say well it's because i'm waiting for god is why i do any nonsense and really it's a lack of discipline that pervades itself throughout every aspect of your life but not with daniel it was discipline that brought him into the palace it was disciplined that maintained his testimony in the palace can i get a witness in the house tonight so it takes discipline to be in this room tonight it takes discipline to pray it takes discipline to fast it take discipline every single day to be able to say no i don't want that and and daniel and listen the bible said that you know let me read it and the prince of the eunuch setter daniel i fear my lord the king who has appointed your meat and your drink for why should he see your faces worse likened than the children which are of your sort then shall he make me endanger my head to the king so the united say listen if all they do take this food from the king is my neck in trouble because ollie will not look healthy then daniel said unto the prince of the eunuchs prove thy servant i beseech you 10 days and let them give us pulse and water so so don't give us the king's meat and we know this story after the 10 days daniel and the hebrew boys look fairer so daniel had you wisdom to negotiate to maintain his testimony he had the wisdom to negotiate and i really want to fight for something here brothers and sisters about maintaining your testimony maintaining your discipline because we're going to build this into his life because here we see daniel in his teenage years this is not an adult this is not 20 thirty fourteen fifty and we struggle with people in their fifties and sixties who still can't be here anybody with me tonight this is a teenager who not only starts off right but finishes right now biblical scholars are perplexed about this one because we have moses saying drinky rebels we have abraham lying about his wife we have all these testimonies but you know i put you some homework find one scripture that represents where daniel fell now we know all fall short in some way but there's no record in scripture of daniel's mystics that is your homework so daniel had such a life of integrity that god gave him grace with that and in fact ezekiel says there were three very in ezekiel 14 14 he speaks of three very righteous men anybody knows that let me find ezekiel but then we don't sunday school tonight right is that okay ezekiel though these three men ezekiel 14 14. though these three men noah daniel and job were in it they should deliver but they're also by their righteousness say the lord god so it means out of all the biblical characters these men stood out to god for their righteousness remember job there's none like this man on earth like job anybody with me god search the whole earth and say there's nobody like noah so he pulls noah out from a sinful world and he puts daniel in that same category it's all there in scripture three men stood head and shoulders above everybody else job god was boasting about you throw whatever you want at job he will stand the test of time and he did look at noah out of the whole earth goku called noah and dan is in that same category and god gave grace to him by not even showing us you any weakness that daniel would make friends young people church deacon elder minister from a very young age or whatever age you are now you can make a decision to live a disciplined spiritual life with god i want to nail that down to us tonight i also want to highlight something very interesting because we did another bible study i want to go back to verse 7 and unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gives name for he gave unto daniel the name of belter shaza and tahana naya of shadrach and the mitchell of meshach and the azariah of abednego now this is so significant that many people don't really study it now daniel by by name daniel means my judge is elohim or my judge is god they were actually giving them babylonian names that was to be almost a resistance to their israel or jewish name so belted the name they gave to daniel was bell is my judge bail being the babylonian god i want you to process that for a second so daniel as worthy as he was they gave him a name and all of the names that were given to them were names that were contrary to their jewish names but it is a deep teaching that no matter what label is placed upon you whether it's in your job in your family you can rise above the label because the label they give to daniel daniels throw off the label because he knew baal is not his judge he was not answering to the gods of the babylonians he was answering to his god and his testimony was carried through that anybody with me tonight so i want to like i say this is part one if i keep going this could take us to midnight at least i don't have anybody willing to stay until midnight but this could take us a little ways but i want to highlight a few points about danielle so give it a little encouragement and then we're going to try to bring this to a little close so we talked we touched on the fact that daniel is from the royal family we touch on the fact that daniel carried himself a certain way he's renowned in wisdom we know he interprets dreams we know he the bible give us no dirt on daniel in fact what is so interesting to see how how the in daniel 2 48 in 4 9 and 5 11 with the interventional dream they actually put down here to oversee he was the truth prefect of all the wise men in babylon who was handling all this immediately god put daniel to oversee all these immediately characters because daniel was an anomaly to them because in their world they say nobody's was able to to understand what god do and and and here it is daniel when the dream came and the king said he's not telling no he can't remember the dream or he can't he don't know who and i was able to present the dream animation we we know this right daniel has such a testimony that he serves and his life and the consistency of his testimony he serves under four different kings firstly nebuchadnezzar then belchaza then darius and then cyrus the persian he has a 70-year ministry that is unblemished and it was in his later part of his ministry and that's what i want to touch on before we go into prayer tonight in daniel 6 is where he ends up in the lion's den by the time daniel 6 is there darius is no king and the bible says in in daniel 6 it pleased darius to set over the kingdom and i always say whatever man does it is only a small fraction of the way god operates because god we know is a god of order and when you read through scripture you see man's best attempt to have a level of order and structure it please darius to set over the kingdom 120 princes now this is a heathen pagan kingdom 120 princes which should be over the whole kingdom i want you to process the context so it's a huge kingdom he has a hundred and twenty princes which set over the whole kingdom and above these three presidents depending many time we do so long to possess this right he has three presidents that oversee these hundred and twenty leaders these princes of whom daniel was first so daniel is called the first president that the princes might give account unto them and the king should have no damage so the king sets up an administrative structure for the kingdom by appointing 120 princes and picking three men and this is the third king that that daniel is serving under and daniel is always finding himself in this position of leadership mind-blowing that he is not the first out of the three presidents so that the king would have no damage and if you look at each other it mean like no loss so nothing would be out of cater things would run officially et cetera et cetera then this daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes because an excellent spirit was in him could people say that about you that is such an excellent spirit in you that they could trust you to run the kingdom when people look at you can they say it's an excellent way about you i was saying in one of our offices meeting that there's good there's better and there's best you could do things good you could do it better but god really wants the best and here we have and i want you to catch your friends because the super spiritual people we deal with this is a man who god has in government he is part of administration he is his sharp in business in science and leadership and he still maintains his spiritual testimony i want you to get to that for a minute so you could find the balance with life and godliness nobody telling you go be mountain and don't come down but don't ever lose the anchor for your soul or the testimony you have as a christian but god wants you to succeed he wants you to prosper he wants you like i was in a meeting this morning in my office and i said somebody was stepping into our industry i say listen i want to be so good i want to be so good at what we do that we punish them no no i don't try to punish nobody but when you want your work to be so good that people say you know what i give up i don't want to try no more but that happens when you do your work a certain way because when god finished in the book of genesis 1 and it was it was good it was perfect he could rest so i want us to understand that god desires perfection it is an excellent and an excellent testimony so then there's daniel and animoare daniel because listen i've always said admire david and that's why zika exhausted scripture because dave a man after god's own heart i can't identify with david's struggle his ups and downs many of the increase about me many as many did i see as my soul there's no help helping for him and god if you look at at psalms 13 you see this is how i started to extend my time what time it is when you read psalm 13 you see a man on the heap of depression in two verses he asking god five questions how long will gopher get me oh lord forever how long will thou hide thy face from me how long shall i take counsel in my soul having sorrow in my heart daily how long shall my enemy be exalted over me that why i could identify with them god see what i dies i mean sometimes how long will don't forget me oh lord oh lord forever forever forever you'll forget me how long will i hide my face from me but here you see a man reconciling with god consider and hear me oh lord my god lighten my eyes lest i sleep the sleep of death in other words if you don't give me some hope his brother dies lest my enemy say i have revealed against him and those that trouble me rejoice when i am moved but i have trusted in thy mercy that's david my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation i will sing it to the lord look at me reverse his whole position by the time he reaches verse six he don't he don't convince himself out of a situation that's david man after god's own heart but true scripture this is why i say we have no excuse because we can look through scripture and see the different situations the struggles the problems the hopes the confidence and see how god could work no matter what the situation is let me try to keep on target few more minutes so then this daniel was preferred above the president and princes why was he preferred because an excellent spirit was in him our desire must be to have an excellent spirit in us that should be our testimony if that is not your testimony you need to start to change it tonight that on your job in your marriage in your business in your neighborhood people must say there's an excellent spirit in you and the king thought to set him over the whole realm so so the king because of the excellent spirit about daniel decide to now elevate him above president status and see you in charge of the whole realm we have examples of this this is joseph so the parallels repeat itself it's the same thing jose was left in charge of the whole of egypt here we have a jew joseph head of egypt a heathen world here you have daniel about to be elevated so it is not uncommon for god to raise you among your own family raise you above your own neighborhood raise you above your circumstances and elevate you dialed in and evade himself king after king would come and something about his life would attract them and place him into opposition of leadership can the church say amen open doors for him he couldn't open for himself can the church say amen no listen now this is where we get into it i'm trying to close up brother could i keep going then the president and princes listen there now sort of find occasion against daniel considering the kingdom so i want you to catch this it was not his spiritual life that attracted the attack god blessed daniel so much his natural life attracted the attack that's deep that is that's a whole message by itself the the other ambitious leaders the bible says sought to find occasion or reason or a problem or an issue against daniel concerning the kingdom concerning his authority considering his leadership considering how he rose to the level he did not by his own doing but by the spirit upon him that attracted favor because god was with him can the church say amen but listen to this but they could find none occasion no fault for as much as he was faithful neither was there any error or fault found in him wow wow i heard somebody we had i was having a conversation about this with somebody and say what a testimony to desire to have that's when i say neither was there no error or fault found in him this gives us something to desire something to aspire to you know that your daily walk could attract a testimony a couple of trying to pull a file on him boy i'm trying to pull a file i getting nothing so they found nothing then said these men we shall not find any occasion they get frustrated against this daniel except we find it against him concerning the law of his god so it was after they do you know when they're going off the election they just go and dig up in all your past they're trying to find something to pin daniel with all attempts at trying to derail daniel field so they say the only thing we could possibly use against daniel is something tied to the law of his god what does he tell us throughout all of his life his career if i could use that word career working in the courts of kings for almost 70 years he maintained a testimony not only a testimony of character but a testimony of the law of his god hallelujah the law of his god was maintained so they say the only thing we could find is something with the law of his god can somebody say there's something about this man there's something about this woman there's something about this deacon this elder this one that they don't compromise the law of the accord can the church say amen then these presidents and princes so if you do the match with me it should have two more presidents 120 princes 122 of them against daniel assemble together to the king now it's interesting because i wonder what was he king thinking because daniel was no wrong i don't know where daniel was when this meeting was happening what time they choose to come to see the king and why did he say well why isn't daniel with you i don't know how that city was here but here 120 of them come to daniel come to a king sorry and said just unto him king darius live forever watch not live forever as if you could ever live forever king diaries live forever all of the presidents of the kingdom the governors and the princes the councilors and the captains that is the whole administration the whole government the the the the the corporation the parliament the opposition they bring the whole resume everybody you all administration so you want to tell me you are people against you daniel had the old government the old system against him have consulted together to establish a royal statute and to make a film decree that whosoever shall ask a petition of any god or man so they put all man in there to wrap the king himself to make him feel good about himself any prayer for god or man sorry for that he is safe save of the your king or in other words the only person they should come to is you as the king the cargo to any god or any man except you the king shall be cast into the den of lions now or king established the decree and signed the writing that it be not changed according to the law of the medes and persians which alter it not does that sound familiar the lord will change this was the same thing i do not recall in the story of esther when the decree was made to go after all the children of israel in that time do you remember do you remember the law could not be changed so when he iman was hanged what did the king do the king told them am tell them to arm themselves so they are they are giving them permission to defend themselves because pull back the law which is also biblical because when the blessings was passed to jacob and the word was spoken there was nothing else to pass to esau because the word don't come back once it released from the bow once the blessing leaves god can't even pull back the blessing can the church say man everybody with me tonight so they wanted the king to establish a decree and sign the writing i'm trying to i'm trying to wrap up so that they be changed not according to the law where wherefore king darius signed the writing and the decree now when daniel no this is where it gets interesting we're coming to a close knew that the writing was signed so this is not him being ignorant of it and the bible writes it a certain way and this is your testimony when you knew that the boss did it against you when you knew your co-worker did it when you knew this happened and you knew the situation was bad and you knew it's nothing in favor when daniel knew that the writing was signed he went into his house and his windows being opened in his chamber toward jerusalem he kneeled upon his knees three times a day and prayed and gave thanks before his god as he did a fourth time in other words he did not break his routine he didn't change for nobody he didn't close his door he didn't close the window he didn't pray in secret he kept doing what he had been doing for 70 years he kept doing what he had been faithful to for 70 years he kept doing what had kept him going for 70 years this new trial didn't change his discipline this new trial didn't change his focus this new situation didn't change his testimony this new situation didn't change his fate anybody with me tonight and you must have that conviction you must have that conviction we serve a living god we serve a resurrected god we stand for a message that is true and will never fear no matter what enemy comes against it we have to have the ability to stand for what we believe no matter the cost no matter the cost can the church say man i was just sharing with my wife before this service i said but abraham said so many things that the world can't eat there's so many things the prophet has that the word can't tolerate that they would call hate speech now and recently some of you may know russia banned certain books from brother branham because brother branham would speak plainly you know holding it back is the truth in the same way that's why brother branham would say if if god don't judge this world he will have to repent to sodom and gomorrah and bring them back up again but in this world of liberation to the world movement where it's it's it's it's don't say this freedom of this freedom of this live and let's live love everybody love is love and oh i know all these things what will your testimony be when you opposition come close your door and hide we're not saying don't be wise and don't use wisdom but you have to know where your ground is you have to know what you're standing for you have to know what you believe you have to know what is truth because only the truth will set you free in the hour of darkness only the truth will keep you alive many people will say i don't know that man just like peter before his conversion peter was there for three and a half years he saw the miracles he saw five loaves and two fishes in fact he was the one one of them would say what was jesus among so so you know and and he was there but when the when when the pressure come he said i don't know him i don't know him deny and jesus saw this and still saw the seed in him would overcome because his seed was greater greater than his current situation greater than his pressure let me try to wrap up now when daniel knew that the writing was signed he went into his house and his windows being open did god left it here in scripture for you to see the backbone this man had as an old man now around 70 close to the early 80s he's not he's not 15 anymore he's not 25 he's not 35 he's not 45 but he you see i come too fast to turn back now i believe this thing for so long i've not given up nothing you do can change me i am trying to protect my position by not praying anymore i'm not trying to protect my office by giving my office not work for prayer like come on now but prayer life is more important than this position they're fighting for is god put me in this position he can keep business business don't touch my prayer life because my prayer life is my defense my prayer life is my weapon my prayer life is my confidence my prayer life is my bank my prayer life is my doctor because i could plug in there any time can the church say amen three times a day three times a day the bible says and prayed and give thanks before his god as he did her fourth time i'm trying to close out and these men assembled and found daniel praying and making supplication before his god then they came near and bespake before the king concerning the king's decree has doubled not signed a decree that every man that shall ask a petition of any god or man within 30 days save of thee or king shall be cast in the dead of lions the king anton said the thing is true according to the law of the meat and persons which alter it not then answered thee and said before the king because now they feel they catch him they are talking about they come and say but you know remember the lawyer make you remember you see nobody should ask any petitions nobody should make any plea you remember that he said well yeah i remember we catch you he said good no that daniel witches are the children of the captivity of judah now understand this it's 70 years daniel there i want you to catch this how the enemy is operating in 70 years he served under four different kings and they're still talking about the captivity of judah oh god almighty this future and the pin the heritage the issue is where he come from and that is why young people in church you will never fit into this world you will never fit in for all the time daniel was there they did they never welcomed him into their circle oh come on somebody i want you to catch this he was his position as high as he was he was about to be appointed head of the realm and he was still not accepted because he was not from there and god could elevate you in any position here but your kingdom is not of this world you're from another place you're not another time another dimension kind of the church say amen that daniel which is of the children of the captivity of judah regarded not be your king knows the decree that thou has signed but making his petition three times a day they come and bring the complaint to the king that daniel playing three times a day has anybody complained about you praying three times a day anybody complain that you're praying oh come on now let me see the hands anybody complaining like i said with with jacob i want my limp you see when jacob finished wrestle with the angel he had his limp i want people to see my limp i want people to complain that i praying three times a day i want them to complain about me that i praying three times a day i wanted to know i met the angel that must be your testimony let it not be hidden let it be a reality to you kind of church say man they complain they complain about him that he said that he that he peop that to make it with the three times so they knew they knew they knew then the king when he heard these words was so displeased with himself so the king and all regret his decision he said may i make her out i didn't realize there was daniel only trying to capture all you know well they all make me feel good and see people coming to me i'm ready you want to get right and he set his heart on daniel this is a heathen king a pagan king this is not uh uh what we would call a godly king but daniel had such an effect upon him i want you to process this that it bothered this king that daniel was in this trouble oh god talk about finding fearful with god with men that scripture finding people with god and men then the king when he heard these words was so displeased with himself and set his heart on danny to deliver him and he labored till the going down of the sun to deliver him so the king himself went into petition mode that is when he really have a testimony that is like what i reference to somebody about the the the centurion who had his servant who was so valuable that he went out of his way out of his character to get to jesus to speak a word are you so valuable to people that are willing to make an extra effort for you are you so valuable to the kingdom that god were willing to to go extra for you can the church say amen then these men assemble unto the king and said unto the king know o king that the law of the medes and the persians is that no decree nor statute which the king established may be changed so they are now arguing with the king about the lord the king make saying you may be looking you can't even change your own law then the king commanded and they brought daniel and cast him into the den of lions now the king spake and said unto daniel thy god whom does service continually he will deliver thee hallelujah oh glory are feeling good tonight oh my may everybody around you be able to testify about you hallelujah that thy god whom thou serve is continually he will deliver thee let it be my testimony let it be your testimony that we serve the lord continually we're not stopping praising we're not stopping believing we're not stopping worshiping we will serve god continually will deliver thee and a stone was brought and laid upon the mouth of the den and the king sealed it with his own signet and with the signature of his lords that the purpose might not be changed concerning daniel then the king went to his palace and passed the night fasting neither were instruments of music brought before him and his sleep went from him such was the impact of danny the king didn't even sleep the night oh god help us then the king arose very early in the morning and went in haste until the den of lions and when he came to the den he cried with a lamentable voice unto daniel and the king spake and said to daniel oh daniel this is the over 70 almost 18 year old man oh daniel servant of the living god the man backslides when he falls guarding him [Laughter] daniel life getting king the king in our backseat and condition the king backslide from the idols daniel life daddy king the backslide from his idol worship he said they say this so whether they live in god that's a real that's a that's a powerful statement you know that is heresy in their world you know that is blasphemy in their world you are king of a kingdom of idol and you say daniel silva believe in god hallelujah my my my my mind you have to forgive me and the kingdom oh then certainly is thy god whom those servants continue able to deliver thee from their liars then sent daniel unto the king o king live forever my god had set his angel and had shot the lion's mouth that they have not hurt me for as much as before him innocence he was found in me and also before thee o king have i done no hurt then the king exceedingly then was the king exceedingly glad for him and commanded that they should take daniel up out of the den so dana was taken up out of the den and no manner of hurt was found upon him because he listen why because he believed in his god no manner of hurt was found upon him why because he believed in his god and no manner of hurt could ever come upon you if you believe in your god man what an encouragement what a feat what a word tonight about believing and having faith in god despite your circumstance despite your opposition let me bring you so close now the king is upsetting so you see the king commanded and they brought those men 122 and all the captains and only generals and everybody else who had accused daniel and they cast them into the dead of lions the king is so upset he said them their children and their wives lord help us and the lions had them had the mastery of them that you see scripture mastery you know it is mastery land what's not even i had a time the lion get on body lands put on a show and break all their bones in pieces forever they came at the bottom of the den hallelujah then king darius wrote unto all people nations and languages that dwell in all the earth at that time it's really it peace be multiplied unto you i make a decree that in every dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the god of daniel for he is the living god and steadfast forever and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed and his dominion shall be even unto the end may the lord have a blessing to the reading of his word shall we bow our heads for a word of prayer tonight heavenly father the little bible study a little word of encouragement to your people lord from a testimony of a young boy who was captured forced into captivity but maintained a testimony and in so many ways we have found ourselves in situations places conditions that we didn't choose we didn't desire but lord help us to preserve a testimony in the midst of our child in the midst of our testimony in the midst of our testing and true it all lord he maintained a discipline a discipline to study a discipline to be wise a discipline to conduct himself and most importantly lord a discipline to pray and when the great test came to him the test of his testimony the test of his law of god his understanding of that law his subjection of his life to that law his commitment to that law his belief in that law he lived it out and he maintained his testimony of being a warrior of defeat in so much that to this day we could find no blemish in scripture about his life father
