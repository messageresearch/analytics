word granted God and Jesus my ask it Amen I'm gonna be seated or praise the Lord blessed be the name of the law [Music] we're tonight our title the vision is yet for an appointed time vision is yet fun appointed time I now have an inspiration catch the vision and cope with the word that's the inspiration that I have patched the vision and cope with the word now Jesus he rebuked his own disciples when they didn't have a real positive testimony when he was talking to them after he rose on the dead he actually told them all fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken but not Christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory so he was telling them I mean you supposed to know this stuff if I told you I'll be offered I told you all these things but he went on and did something to them and he the Bible says that these are the words this is Luke this is from 24:44 which I spoken to you while I was yet with you that all things must be fulfilled which was written in the law of Moses and in the prophets and in the sons concerning me then open he their understanding that they might understand the scriptures and said unto them thus it is written and thus it behooves Christ to suffer and to rise from the today or from the dead on the third day and so on and who is 49 his pretend is presented to them so now that he's opened it understand in the description opened the word to them he is pretending to them the vision of what they must expect and what they have to look forward to what was the target what was the endgame what was the goal and he said behold I and the promise of my father upon you but tarry in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high yellow is a stay there until hey there until this power that I've been loosed by my father because I did a price I paid a price I just come off the cross I am now risen from the dead and know that I have done that nothing could stop the power from being released the power is on its way but be in position to receive it and he Jesus let them as far as the Bethany he lifted up his hands and bless them and it came to pass while he blessed them he was parted from them so Dee was leaving now nobody was crying nobody was depressed nobody was frustrated and Jesus was leaving and they worship him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy he's gone what didn't happen there Jesus told him if I don't go the comforter will not come and they knew he was leaving something as his coming will get the Lord a shout in the house Oh hallelujah and that is when and they were and they were continually in the temple praising and blessing God because now their mind is open up the understanding is open up the world has been Brooke to them praise God not to look for some man that interpret more words to them they don't have to look to some bishop somewhere or some man of God from somewhere or a certain man have to come and do this and this certain man didn't have to look for that no more they got spoken word they got Jesus or words they got the breath of God receiving the Holy Ghost they got the breath of God upon their life no man didn't we get this God spoke it and we are promised we have been promised a quality group jump in today the son of man would be reveal again that's not a son of man that's the son of man so decent a man was filled in that prophet DS Solomon was failed in William Brennan so the words come another prophets mouth wasn't William branham's words what's the words of the Son of Man and the Solomon who came to Abraham he said I will return unto thee according to the time of life appointed this vision of God this prophetic vision that was released by seven seals and seven thunders there's an appointed time for this vision to be fulfilled but this shall be fulfilled it shall come to pass God swore by himself that it going to come to pass or do you believe others even or glory to God hallelujah my Kojima be seated Oh hallelujah so when God came down in Genesis 18 Genesis 19 to tell them I will return to be a corner time of life to angels went on to Sodom under investigative judgment isn't that right but one angel stays in the backside of the desert with Abraham another angel said the Lord said shall I hide from Abraham the thing which I about to do so caught at the break the seals on the backside of the desert to Abraham to reveal to Abraham judgment was next coming to Sodom Oh glory to God but Abram as the elect had to get the divine revelation and vision as Kings that ought to be all glory to God we believe that and because God brought that upon Abraham Abraham brick in the intercession the brief a lot because luck was a believer not sitting but a believer formal but a believer lukewarm but a believer it was family Oh glory to God and you can a big revelation 22:17 and the spirit and it has to be a scriptural voice hallelujah so Abraham was anointed with revelation 22:17 to go after his brother lot o glory to God isn't that right Oh hallelujah praise praises his family law is my right underground plea before God if there is 50 if there's 25 in there is 10 and they couldn't find him 10 with Christ living in them and God sentence that city to judgment and that same God Oh sentence the world judgment Oh hallelu because we are back to Salaam condition the name again we a packet of Sodom condition again and it has to be a manifestation of the revealing of the son of man again but this time in a body bride that is what you're called to do to give one final witness and they're gonna be a voice going out the spirit and the bride say come they don't even know what they would wit but the world is gonna head for Oklahoma can see a woman going to the bank Sodom and Gomorrah she's gonna call like a P but they didn't know next one and fire was coming I could see somebody kind of children amen to the babysitter but they wasn't seeing fire was coming on the backs after does that Steel's be an open mysteries being revealed vision being made clear and they don't see the seals of judgment is about to be poured out with the wrath of God or glory that God and people have sat so long enough in this message it becomes ordinary it become normal like if nothing is taking place like if the Lord Allah is coming and they fighting one another and accusing one another one another but the vision is for an appointed time the vision is correct the vision is just here at the Lord we have not been gathering of in vain seven thunders God is the bride together not the missile Association seven thunders seven thunders whatever in thunders are it's going to gather the bride together a prophet spoke it that's an exclusive bride promise that's why I here tonight nor devil in hell could stop the bride from these promises because the devil himself don't have a clue of what's under that Seventh Seal is only the bride ordained to go under there Oh hallelujah praise God this is hidden from the devil this is hidden from the wise and the prudent this is revealing and the babes such as we learn oh you can be seated what get courts even have a right division and make a queen not complicated plain not difficult please not to scratching your head trying to figure what the man of God is trying to say we not trying to say anything donuts done the Lions have brought the Lord God hath spoken we're not trying to say anything we have a message and it stops here the Lord we have the King's message glory to God undo you abyss Eden [Applause] [Music] nope no hair tight no Jackie sighs no amirite not Phyllis tiny but they stopped the bride from possessing for redemptive rights not when the lamb took the book not when the lamb gave the Prophet the book not when the mighty angel came not with the book and the redemptive rights of being revealed no no no no no no Oh glory of God Michel Fortin the dragon fought this battle we and you may be seated didn't start on earth it started in heaven so if you take you war in a new war and it started way back in heaven there was no whiskey up there nobody was more smoking marijuana nobody was going point no no no no no no no no no no no no was just this that's the ambition of of Lucifer wanting the kind of worship that beginning our God this morning because a father seeketh such to worship Him and Lucifer got jealous and wanted to worship and we were represented by those angels and we say who you not you you not get in this version Oh glory to God and the first over true and cool was in heaven hallelujah trying to make a coup that record of his true and instead a train going off going kick him off and fell to the edge and the battle of angels became the battle of men that's why we are here tonight to give me your sword in your hand to give your shoes on your feet to give you a shield to give your breastplate Oh glory to God this is not a game it's another game I'm not here to entertain you may be seated praise God Hebrews chapter 4 says let us therefore fear Lisa promise left us of entering into his rest any of you should come short of it so the promise is to enter into his rest or glory to God hallelujah because the word was preached so all of them but it wasn't mixed with fate so quarter to bring the fate to mix with the wood I promise when he saw we couldn't even go forward on trip we go backwards let me say that again we couldn't move forward until we pick up the faith that was once delivered to the Saints so courts and a prophet to go back and pick it up bring it here that we can deal with them Devil's trying to cut us off from the resurrection did you get that it takes perfection to bring on the resurrection this vision is a vision of perfection not judge anybody could go to church anybody can join church this is perfection this is seven voices this is seven living spirits this is the rainbow living in you hunger in you this is what this is about I don't want nothing less than that maybe seated forgive me forgive me tonight I get an excited oh my Gordon promised me a stipend he put me cmp keep the stipend until I get the same pay you give me something the hole a small measure to work with but the same thing mean just what Peter had just what Paul had just what the early church had we have to have it back nothing less than that which monitor right now that say like

Ripper he needs to walk you're blind you need to see your bow you need to be loosed you're dumb you'll need to speak [Applause] you need to pay taxes there need to catch a fish the gospel being preached and ministering to the needs of the people present tense [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Jesus had dominion over fish cook fish Jesus have dominion over bread he could multiply hell you say this is one I can make a - I can make Peter before I can make four become eight I can multiply whatever you put in my hands I don't have to accept this is one bread this is poo fishes this is I don't have to accept that I could make it what I want to make it I can make a revival right here in noodle right now [Applause] that's the gospel let me see the country maybe season some brothers brought a crippled friend on a pilot to half will be policy or whatever Treacher came to the surface and and he couldn't get no me in it's backed out nobody can I'll share him there's no Deakin there's nothing they can't comment I'm ghost brothers refused to go back home like that they said we come too far there was no bus there was no taxi there was no path they walked with that guy that was their friend they walk with him because it's a Jesus isn't own and if Jesus is all wrong something has to happen Jesus either turning water into wine multiplying bread wherever did something has to be taking place Jesus is a quiet man there is always activity around Jesus some pasta to be forgiven somebody being healed some blind eye opening some devil being cast Oh once Jesus is around what those guys did it t up the roof and left on the man in front of Jesus you think they're wasting time you think the idol you think you do have fit didn't have our feet to climb the roof that our feet are pulling the guy who on the stretcher had a fit that these guys have hit it must have been painful to go up the wrong side of that building but when he left in front of Jesus it was letting down and coming up in the atmosphere I pushed it was all around Jesus so he was coming down in the atmosphere my car and Jesus say which is easier to say we could be better walk but I still be forgiven me you say which one which one I could do both I can forgive you of your sins and free you from your condition you wanna go free tonight goodness Son of Man set free and free indeed oh you can't go free tonight [Applause] maybe season cement God given the promise of the Promised Land knowing Egypt the Prophet said God came down to make this promise of reality so it's good to see we have a promise but the promise has to become good these guys were so inspired go told Abraham hundred year before that he was gonna do it Judas said don't move my balls on me until you go to the promised land and bury me with the rest of my father's cause he know the resurrection was coming or glory to God each one of them prophets know what the other prophets said so they were consulting the prophetic utterance or glory the call of those men of God that went before them to see what the prophecy see because all of them knew it was men that was moved by the spirit so they were not speaking on the intellectual level they were speaking from the intelligence of God that trap tongue into the heart to give them dusty at the Lord Abram said bury me right here with you was buried said sirrah I'm gonna buy pieces wrong we will be buried right here I stuck with a prophet after the study said listen Bowie bury me here don't Egypt take me right to the promised land Oh glory to God so that's how they were you may be seated well till they've died years later he said oh you big blueberry me here take my bones with you because God will surely visit you so they were in the spirit they know a resurrection as promised they were looking for it so much that because they don't what did only me in Egypt because I'm not generally a football nineteen is only coming in a promised land if they stay in Egypt you can't get this anointing you got what I'm saying glory missin one time one time they were burying a man under hood some enemy coming and if that man in the grave of Elijah and when they just joined on this run when that body hit Elijah bones power [Applause] Misun the bible in cinema was a Christian there was an ordinary man but when that dead man hit christen power and bring the dead back to life give the cripton power only laser poles could bring a dead man to life what about Elijah Coates william branham taxes 1965 and we arrested we are arrested on these cost on these words because of spirit the prophet under bride will say the same thing I'm what I said what already been said in the world [Applause] LeBron said it's got to be a promise the intent addressed what to fear that we don't have a promise but we have a promise the promise is the enter his rest you may be seated [Applause] so you're even a battle tonight to fight to get into his rest because his rest is the promise what about him said this here he said watch notice let us therefore fear lisa promise being left us a end in distress so I want you to remember that unless we find out unless God really little us here we go no matter how much we go to church that has nothing to do with it God must come by revelation and reveal himself to us and that takes all the teens of the world out that's not good I'm not hearing of amens on that that's not like 60% something like a 1i how to read it again maybe younger idea God must come by revelation and reveal himself to us and that takes all the world polity that will out because once is being being made plain to you you could run if you read it both walk your run with it because I run with a message it is clear to you he not only coming for your soul or spirit you coming for your very body itself you wanna be completely redeemed Oh hallelujah praise God in add butter Branham now remember no remember you may be seated they were on the road to rest the pillar fire let them and we want to find out what is this rest watch so first you have to end into the stress but it shouldn't come short of it so when you know you have a promise don't come short of it you want to be faithful to the promise of God you want to see it manifested in your life not in the church but in your life and then you could come to church with it's in your life you understand - revival in your home you can't start something in the church what you don't have in your home you have to get it on the inside inside now right just when you pray go in a secret closet and pray dr. heavenly father who sees in secret will reward you openly or there's a lot of shout praise God that the professor no middles at the big revival - revival out the comforter people you were after [Applause] you have to remember you have to bring it look at stopping it right now right now by your worship by your shows by your hands by your hallelujah you are creating the atmosphere right now [Applause] maybe season here's the promise here is what we got to feel if there's not a promise left us but the Prophet said but there is a promise and the next thing don't come short of it now the thought is if we are on our way to the rest what is the rest where is it it is join in church it'll being baptized us is in a way is it becoming remember the greatest church in the city where I met the clothes it is education is it money so we can quit work I'm just laid on rests the rest of our lives that's not it listening to what the Bible says it is let us therefore fear Lisa promise left us the end in turn is rest that you should come short of it for unto us the gospel was preached as well under them what is the gospel the good news the good news came to them in Egypt that quarter said to deliver up he's going to bring us out and take us to the promised land the good news for us now is that God sent a deliverer the Holy Ghost and we are on the road to the promised land and the people has made Cui's and denomination but God still remains that our rest is the Holy Ghost so this rest is the Holy Ghost we are pressing towards the Holy Ghost that's our promised land is the land of the Holy Ghost in that land of power in that line of deliverance in that land of freedom in that land of miracles in that none of anointing in that manner contact with the supernatural in that line of angels descend an angel walking back that's it Matlin oh it's a good man oh he is here tonight Oh blowing up gardening Alleluia somewhere around says here the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith and then I heard it so after was it have to go beyond your Shelton priests you have to be praising board on a planet to your own heart he said no no matter how much the word is preached how well you like the way it's being preached unless you yourself a partaker of that it won't do you one bit of good so you gotta say this is - man I'm taking it tonight my taking it back home to my wife Oh glory to God husband love your wife that's the word or glory they're going you have to express it you have to show it you have to live it take it back home hallelujah praise be to Jesus or glory no Gordon and hallelujah you may be seated so Genesis 1 go and let every seat before and after its kind and God could only speak that because quad know to see that the power to transform itself into whatever the seat is isn't that right and but a man was talking about transform to be mean different to what has been its character and everything has to be changed and that's the word to be transformed isn't that right and God saw chaos and darkness and God saw the condition but that didn't intimidate God darkness and chaos and confusion didn't intimidate God all that has to happen is the spirit have the moon I want the spirit moves it has to have a voice because God have to use the voice of his word or glory no God is not just a spirit move this free enough to connect with the voice the voice have to speak and the word becomes that season to produce the miracle Oh glory to God so God transform chaos into a garden in Eden isn't that right everything was perfect he commanded each one of those seeds of what there would be that they would transform themselves into the plant of which kind of life that the Word of God spoken in them should be if it was an oak tree it the bridge what an oak it was a pan was read what a perm because the creator just sent this word and everything under his control now when he put the seed in the earth this seed can only come forth with the power of life within it and that is why God put that seed in you when before the foundation of the world you are not in charge of that seed that's his seed or glory to God let me say it again you are not in charge of that see the predestinated mission who you are he's in charge of that is who is Tanya he called you have to knew you before that's why he called you because he knew the seed where they planted in Nigeria your ceiling whatever village whatever state he had to find you I mean know where you are well glory to God that mother Eagle know where you are he's a seed inside of you oh yes yeah fleshly habits yes you have a human spirit you didn't even know you had acceded when you were smoking and drinking but what was looking after you all the time because you know one day you have to hear that call you have to get that call or glory that God listen we were dead in sin and we heard a call and the people that are dead in the grave they don't hear a whole wonder - Oh glory to God God Collier the Baptist Church of Methodist Church what Collier the University of the drunkenness out of adultery of the fornication what could call you further and transform you into a son and daughter of the Living God to reproduce and manifest Jesus Christ do you believe it amen each one of those seeds let me go you may be seizing each one of those seeds has the power in itself I love this the transform itself into the species that I desire it to be that is what make me that that's what it must be because I have given every seed here we go transformed in power [Applause] to make out of itself in its potentials no to make out of itself exactly what I wanted to be God has never changed I'm just the same as he was then God is he tell me to do something nothing is going to stop him and he will do it that's why when God finished with his works he turned his back and rested because they know every secret word of this guy super obvious guy so what is rested and let the magic work and bored acting on this drama converse the atom like it would I see Adam where do we get a word from how out of position then then humans not a takeover well is the woman he gave me so he began the past epoch and possible and got him young kill a lamb bring this atonement that's very first income because that was required so God couldn't spear them he said the day you eat thereof that did you died and there was no gambling house there was no drinking homes there was this Adam Eve his wife and a gardener Eden and Mansell hip-hop it had no rock star and Hollywood you know man fell in that environment so man can fall anywhere oh I thought you wasn't born in sin and with iniquity I thought with me alone I thought all I was born in sin and ship iniquity understand this if God don't hold you you fall let's let's talk [Applause] so don't play more righteous than anyone inside of here if God don't hold you that's my damn except I look unto the hills from whence cometh my help Maya come from the Lord the decision hallelujah I like what Isaac said this morning about the tapestry of David's life on a young man the king - old man - died cool he God make sure this lifespan from childhood go straight up a whole big circle of life and God call him a man after my own heart you may be seated oh praise the name of the Lord so then God the power to transform and the devil bring up something to deform and the reform is to take us from its original state make something go wrong with it same seed but messed-up same seed much tied up hallelujah we are presently tied up under before sometimes it industry but the twisting but there is coming a power and it's coming a brain that can have revelation 22:17 and the voice of that is not go the voice of that is not cut your I have not been with you that's not the voice of it the voice of it the spirit and the bride say come you have your ticket to glory you are both the board the plane you are saying goodbye world what you have time to do to be bitter with anybody or hateful towards anybody you are leaving here your ticket is County your visa is stamped you cannot be deported you came from there [Applause] did you get that you cannot be reported that is wet by your home you're going back home if I was seeking a city whose nature and the ladies thought maybe season you should see me in my home there's no gray headed you should see my house you should see the street leading to my house my god I see the wandering now at all I'm not talking about ensuring that that old house oh my god you should see the real one [Applause] remember season do you understand that God's objective was to bring back the original man that was supposed to be standing in the gadna even as if he never did fall that's why God introduced justification not just forgiveness but justification is you never did it we can't even figure that out but God could because only he as far as I know have a sea of forgetfulness everybody remember what you did but when God take your sins [Applause] [Music] I'm jumping you remember and remember some of the things I've done but Jesus with the special blood forgive me of everyone tonight under the blood of Jesus you can justify I said you never can you never did it because God said so or give the Lord a shout maybe season you see you need to get that because that will affect your confidence to approach the throne of grace with fullness you need to get that because I can affect you from going into the angel does it give me a little book because if you not sure of the salvation of the redemption and predestination you will need think about going to the angel because you were interpret that you're not worthy but the question wasn't if you're worthy Jesus died for you to have access to the book Satan don't have the password to go into the book access denied no you don't eat mustard type in a password you could just put your fingerprint he doesn't have your print no you don't even need a print whisper just show your face Lord Jesus your son and the book opens to you division bricks what the Lord is about to do I told them back home humid season I said they go outside on the street level you seen this street that's true that's true if you fight at that level you would lose you only seen the street I said if you go in a helicopter you will see beyond the streets you will see the village you go higher you see the city you go higher you see the state you go higher you see Nigeria you go higher the Selassie kana you start a city whole of Africa because you're going higher and higher got you see a bigger vision and the vision when you come down to that Street now it changes perspective because you see a broader picture you see the enemy coming on the road they will come along the streets are you moving on that Street or you know cut them off here because what take you up into a vision and when you come down from that vision you are invincible because we know the next move and that's what quarters to Abraham sure I have some Abraham what I'm about to do just think you are here and cause about the biggest seventh on the revival it's about to break it's easy boom man you be seated so caught up in that helicopter gives you a bigger vision hallelujah I had vision that's my father Brandon was so caught up beside seated right called I see she sealed in the king but who is it looking from he's talking from up dear he see you sealed he said Oh God so close I could feel it my god sons of God going down the streets some praise God silver gold have I none he said god help me live to see it he says it's so close I could see it missing limbs being restored the prophet prophesied missing limbs that's why I'm excited because we have a lot to look forward to oh there's a lot of negative plus a negative we could go into but we're not talking about that we talking about Bridal promises and the vision I have to be clear to you because windows guys got the vision from Jesus they were clean and clear about what they were about that's why the Whitney up Aroon and written in sphere it's not that they were they was rolling no no they were fearful but they know what they expected forward to take away that fear they were nervous but power control take over all of that this power is promised I love it I love it I love it Oh chlorine Oh God in the upper room was pastor and congregation apostle and congregation with chiffon congregation everybody was of me upper room the hut was the hideous prom because power is from the father or do you believe that tonight Oh glory to God hallelujah amen amen amen glory to God so before before the word could be manifested a seed have to be spoken let there be let there be let there be that's the word seed and then it's manifested is the real seed so gotta to speak you first so you are thought bypasses you offer me the world God send a prophet to connect you back with your world so when you hear the word preach you connect with it because the word is an expression of you the thought of what you are you are become a word expression so you have to connect with the world or glow in the world you can't help it this part of your makeup is part of your core it's part of the gene and your soul you can't help it I'm gonna be a perfect Melanie I'm gonna be a perfect man because that is my season [Applause] but if I'm talking about ministers can be half way go to McCaffrey preachers but we just could be hovering reason they get their own we'd messed up and an interrupted program over for their lives but God don't make a free preachers he makes full preachers he put something in since the teach preach as the preach isn't that right but the thing about them we can get mixed up and messed up in our own human spirit and affect the program of God because God wants to be conductors of the Spirit so we have to become the world isn't that right and once you become the word then you become a conductor like the speakin flow true difference that mashing up and doing that other things I give us hope to come out of the way if I come out of the way tonight who is speaking you said wherever gift the givers hope they come out of the way that the Holy Spirit will operate and speak to that gift where's a teaching give a prophetic if whatever gift it is it's how the cut out of the way and once man move out God moves in you hear from God and you know you hear from God all glory to God so sin John 14:12 is a season the same works I do shall you also send John 15:7 is a seed if you're batting me in my ways I value you can ask what you will send Mac sixteen is a seed these signs shall follow them that believe not maybe not perhaps these signs shall follow them not you follow signs signs following you wherever you go this reins are right behind you you can't help it because this is the word you can't help it because this is true [Applause] [Music] so when God made man he'll be Caesar in his own image after his kind the robber said what is this kind the word so the man that God made was would kindly not interpretation kind with a kind you see man like the follow force
