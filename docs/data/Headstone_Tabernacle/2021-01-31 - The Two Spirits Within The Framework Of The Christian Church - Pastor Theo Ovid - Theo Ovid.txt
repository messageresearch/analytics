pardon to receive that restoration to receive that grace father we pray your love would drop down here this morning and take all the evil out bless your people this morning take me out of the way in jesus name i ask it amen god bless you it's great to be here this morning and we thank god for his love amen if you have your bibles are you return to two portion scriptures tonight uh second peter 1 47 and 2nd timothy 3 on the knights that we appreciate message last sunday from brother stephen the pride of superchurch a super race she's near the great headstone amen so we're going to share some things that will tie into that but we are grateful to be here tonight till this morning ii peter 1 4 says here whereby a given unto us succeeding great and precious promises that by these he might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world you lust and besides this given all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge under knowledge temperance and the temperance patience and the patience godliness and to godliness broadly kindness and to bodily kindness charity and we want to go to second timothy 3 remember verse 1. this is paul given this warning this know also that in the last days perilous time shall come for men shall be lovers of their own selves covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents and thankful and holy without natural affection truth breakers false accusers and continent fears despises of those that are good traitors heady high-minded lovers of pleasures more than lovers of god having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such tune away for this is the sword are they which creep into houses and lead captive silly women leading with sins led away with divers lust evolution and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth now as janus and jambes which said moses so these also resist the truth men of corrupt minds reprobate concerning the faith another message the fate but they shall proceed no further for their folly shall be manifest unto all men as dears also was let's pray one more time heavenly father we thank you for your word take me out of the way lord and touch me this morning i need your help and be with me jesus and speak to our hearts take me out of the way and be glorified in jesus christ and you may be seated oh praise the lord this morning we have a title the two spirits working within the two spirits within the framework of the christian church that's the title that the two spirits within the framework of the christian church and um i have a sort of thought inspiration it is not only what you are fighting for but also what you are fighting against let me say it again it's not only what you're fighting for but it's also what you're fighting against so you're not just fighting for something but you have to know what is against you what you are fighting against in order to really effectively win this battle so we are coming down to have this time now where the wheat would be guarded in and matthew 13 jesus said let them both grow together until the harvest but in the time of the harvest i will say to the reapers gather ye first the tears buying them in bundles to burn them but guarded wheat into my ban so it's two things here until the harvest and in the time of the harvest i would like to say this way when you're preparing for christmas to have a turkey or something like that you have the time of the end and the end of time for the turkey hallelujah praise god harvest time the time of the end and then when the neck neck get cut off that's the end of time for that so there's harvest time the harvest time is on right now hallelujah the reapers is coming oh glory to god go there put the seed for nothing you a family plan sees just as he sees apartment plants seed because they expect a crop so god plants seeds and he expects a crop oh glory to god do you believe that so there are two churches or two crops oh glory to god at the harvest time and every one of those two churches have ministers oh glory to god the bride is second peter one four through seven that's that that's the bright spirit their ministers is from ephesians 4 11-13 like the fight for ministry and satan ministers is from matthew 24 24. false anointed ones and his church is what we read there second timothy tree oh glory to god that's the devil's church and that the church gonna fight the bride and that's the bride gonna fight that church that's a spirit no all glory though just two spirits not 27 spirits two spirits main spirits and that's what you're up against oh glory to god that's why you couldn't miss this for nothing god brought you out for a purpose god keep people back sitting to keep them out of the church mess you see the woman at the well god kept you out of the buckingham with the pharisees and described any sadducees oh glory to god because she was ordained to meet messiah she was not dead to sit on long in her church she ordained to meet messiah and their people ordained just to meet messiah which is manifested word glory to god hallelujah glory thank you lord jesus so the church ministry the ministry of the church church spirits is matthew 24 24 false anointed ones false teachers praise god first timothy 4 1 says now the spirit speaketh expressly that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith defeat and give heat to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils so if you say devil's just smoking and drinking there is a doctrine too so you have to know what you are hearing because the spirit in every earth said he'd have an air to hear let him hear what the spirit is saying unto the churches and the spirit could only bring the word let me say it again the spirit could only bring the word the true spirit the omega interpretation of the word the spirit brings the word oh glory to god amen so brother branham now from uh this is in time evangelism he said uh intellectual heady high-minded lovers of pleasures more than lovers of god i'm quoting scripture the holy spirit speaks expressively that this would take place at the end time there'll be incontinent despises of those that are right haters of those who believe the word see like those pharisees and sadducees they hated jesus why because he was contradicting their creed not that he wanted two to be different but he must live he was the word the living word isn't that right now notice praise god in this intellectual age heavy i minded still wins the night to watch uh we love lucy or we love susie and so on like that he said instead attending the prayer meeting lovers of pleasures more than lovers of god haiti high-minded you say they are communists no they are not they are church members you mean in this message the tears in them outside but the two spirits would be so close did you hear that it will deceive the very elect so you can't play with this word anything against this word is the enemy anything against this truth is the enemy because the word itself is god hallelujah you say they are communists no they are not they are church members having a form of godliness denying the power thereof having a form of god but say god doesn't do these things there's no power to it just accept and do this and that no change of life nothing just belong to church so i want to shake you this morning that you entitled to nothing you entitled a fight so all the bunch of people in this message i figured they entitled to be blessed and they're entitled because they believe no i don't see nothing but evil you know it's every place you put your foot is yours little by little you heard wednesday night service don't miss these services listen to it again you have to conquer and possess and walk and what you know is your own that's why you come to church to get revelation [Applause] when you free you're free you know nobody can point fingers at you when god set you free you know [Applause] so let's go through something here now the scripture we read secondary this snow in the last days parallel style shall come for men shall be lovers of their own selves for people shall be lovers of self utterly self-centered lovers of money and aroused by inordinate greed desire for wealth lovers of themselves they see in eye and eye about their business that's so covetous which is jealous envious boasters braggers show off big mouth attention seekers there's a spiritual yeah yeah that's spirit proud arrogant nobody can't talk to at all no correction you feel you're above that arrogant self-righteous pompous blasphemous fallout disobedient appearance is a spirit unthankful ungrateful are the pig and the apples falling on top to take her and he picked with him look up they say thanks just grunting picking up all the happens they could get takers not thank you and appreciate and oh god is good i'm gracious to god for health and strength this morning i i mean he didn't have to do it come here grumping like if god owe you hallelujah even even god tell cain if you do like your brother you'll get blessed god gave cain a chance and all you know you need a revelation just see what you're able to do and do it too oh and you're my blessing going to fall on you because i just bless revelation oh give the lord a shout glory to god if you don't even have it you could do the same thing your sister do your brother do and the same blessing that fall on them will fall on you do i hear a shout in the house [Music] [Applause] unthankful unholy without natural affection truth breakers false accusers troublemakers incontinent incontinent is lacking self-restraint intemperate loosen morals and conduct uncontrolled fierce ferocious aggressive vicious furious angry church people in the message don't look at pentecost look at people outside you know all right despises of those that are good people don't you don't know why they don't like you they just don't like you the spirit on them now listen they can't handle goodness it doesn't matter what you do they have to despise the spirit it's a church spirit all glory there is a church member spirit just get baptized into that and come to church they can't miss it because they have to belong to church but there's a bride inside of here this morning all glory to god and the holy spirit and the bride will speak the spices are those that are good women not lovers of good but haters of good oh praise god hallelujah praise god already is a spirit that already hates god so you reflect and that's come like some parents know you know the the children grow up bigger and then the children start to want to save the lord and then the church and the parents in a backseat condition and they're looking to pull the children down into where they are because they are aware that the children will grow up to be rebuked to them and their filthy behavior and they contrary behavior so they prefer to draw and pull the children down into the gutter where they are instead of saying lord i might be in trouble but not my children i might be in trouble but help them scare them oh god hallelujah let them be a witness to the next generation glory to god as every one of my grandchildren is born are seen as seed of the righteous because i see in seed of the unrighteous all over so i have to believe they are seed of the righteous somebody was praying for you some grandmother some grandfather they must be dead and gone but their prayer egg dead and gone their prayers toward up their prayer bottle up their prayers still being answered on your behalf oh glory to god who brought you up the murray clay who stepped your foot on a raptor state [Applause] [Music] [Applause] traitors defectors heavy high-minded lovers of pleasures more than lovers of god lovers of sensual pleasures vain amusement one and lovers of god having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away turn away turn away turn away although they hold a form of piety true religion they deny and reject our strangers to the power listen they conduct the lies the genuineness of the profession so all they have is they believe they believe what it has to come where the words have to be applied to your life and you have to want it and i trust this morning that this to you or because you're in a battle so you really think the devil will let you just walk upon your promise and just walk in this lit roll a red cap it out do you really think so that can happen in the bible even if you're feeling like fighting the devil still fighting you know even if you feel like praising the devil i want to cut you under you know he said rather you're hot or cold but because you lukewarm that's a spiritual lukewarm spirit my i don't want to look at any brother says saying look at yourself when we talk about this thing i ain't talking about no other church and i'll look at you you let's be heady we just be heady and high-minded and proud and watched at all these attitudes that have to die it's you i'm talking about i'm not much some other church i do bother with no other church i'm not answering for no other church i have to answer for this church go give the lord a shout oh glory to god i have to answer for you and even if you do have faith for yourself i have faith for you this morning oh glory because you're gonna be delivered you're gonna be set free your glory to god [Music] that true spirit will leave you and this only amplified for such as they would creep into houses and lead captive silly women living with sins leading with diverse lusts ever learning never able to continue the truth the amplified said for among them are those who warm their way to homes captivate silly and weak natured woman spiritually dwarfed women loaded down with the burn of their sins and easily swayed and led away by various evil desires and seductive impulses these weak women will listen to anybody who will teach them they are forever inquiring and getting information and i'll never be able to arrive at a recognition and the knowledge of truth these are church member spirits to conflict and contend with the bride members you know what i'm saying them church member spirit s saying easy you know because the ball has janice and jumpers withstood moses oh glory to god they're gonna withstand because they they despise the fate oh hallelujah bold spirits hallelujah glory to god so you get it now ephesians 4 5 4 ministry that's the bright ministry that's where the bright minister's coming from second peter 1 427 that's where the bright church coming from matthew 24 24 that is where the false anointed ministers coming from that is dear five four ministry they join year 19 matthew 24 24 and the church members join the anointing from second timothy street that we read oh glory to god hallelujah so deuteronomy 29 29 said the secret things belonging to the lord our god but i think that i reveal belong to us and to our children and not devil have a right to interfere with anything that god said belong to us the all sparked my path give me my mountain path oh god not what you feel what god reveal or give the lord a shout not what you feel [Music] somebody here 50 years and somebody just come in two hours and they take what is tears because they get a revelation to possess their mountain god have nothing to agree here how long you're praying how long in reading book that have nothing to do with that all glory like eli was backslidden a priest in the church of god and god raised up little samuel the boss all eli blind with no vision oh glory to god there was no open vision and wanted to get a young man named samuel look at the lord who gave the lord a shout and all this old dead moses generation making all kind of willingness turn away with that there's going to rise that just regeneration men that just want to close children all glory to god men want to put their food upon every promise that god has made i had time with the dead all glory to god i have no time with that now fire fire fire let's go over that once and possess signs wonders miracles another book of acts let's go over at once possess adoption perfection [Music] i am blocking them from nothing god said i'm not afraid of any promise take it at me true attacked me any promise god spoke i believe it i receive it i want it oh let me say it again i believe it i receive it i want it [Music] [Applause] glory hallelujah glory to god i had to preach could it be the woman and purple in the white house and who is vice president i here comes i ain't coming to preach that it doesn't matter who ordered that i have nothing with me what i hear is my promise when i say you shall receive power after the holy ghost come upon you glory to god i look at what destruction coming oh when i see the blood i'm gonna pass over you you want the token you want the power you want your [Music] [Applause] [Music] breakthrough [Music] [Applause] [Music] look look how much millions of people vote that man in a man called donald trump and some crazy nutcase christian who believes he's a trump and what kind of nonsense 99.9 of the so-called prophets prophesy lies they get caught sinners making mockery of their lies okay if christianity is a bunch of liars but a prophet student spoke the word and there's no lie god in that manner would lie when a prophet speaks it speaks for god paul said in the last days perilous times shall come he's talking about the war in the church oh give the lord a shout i'm not hearing you perilous time from shall come men shall be lovers of their own self he is talking about the church war a scriptural war a war that's about to start because when the spirit falls the war begins or give the lord a shout in the house oh you think we shaking on the ball what god bless bye-bye every devil in hell trying to cut you off from perfection god tell him walk before my middle perfect we have to get perfection to go into the resurrection not join with some church in america or south america or have to be under this man that is foolishness i have nothing to do with that matthew 5 48 be therefore perfect as your father is perfect and second peter 1 4 through 7 is to bring it to that perfection that is why that will be your spirit oh give the lord a shout not your old complex and when it was a child this happened that happened all that had to get blow out oh give the lord i showed us your nasty filthy human spirit we have come to mind that and and pound that and quote no we're not here for that we have to cast that out oh give the lord some praises what spirit you have to get is that spirit faith filter knowledge temperance patience gogginess brotherly kindness that's the spirit church members don't have that they're hateful but you will be forgiven because faith is based upon forgiveness and if you have to make it to the rapture you have to have the right kind of heart all glory to god the right kind of spirit [Applause] remember direct quote elect don't doesn't persecute elect so who you're fighting you know abram was minding his business because when you have faith just mind your own business faith is not gossip faith is not hope so faith you know so because faith is when you're here from heaven or give the lord a shout [Applause] for marginal voice but brown now that the seas are open the spirit of truth directs us to the word now that the seas are open because before the seas open what we had was theology and man's interpretation of the word but once the seal is open the spirit of truth comes to lead us to the word oh hallelujah and to get into to get from the spirit of truth you have to be online you have to get connected to the source when you're offline you can't get messages you can't hear from god god had his own wi-fi set up a long time around direct access in the garden of eden and when man fell he break the connection but god come this last day to restore back direct link that you could have access to heavenly father isn't that something today amen so whereas in the old testament was debt to go in now is that to be out then you have to press your way to be in god's presence and stay dear romans 12 verse 9 says let love be without this dissimilation uphold that which is evil cleave to that which is good be kindly affection one to another with broadly love in honor preferring one love you see the spirit not through full and business fluent in spirit serving the lord rejoicing in hope patience and tribulation continue the instant in prayer distributing to the necessity of these saints given to hospitality bless them which persecute you bless and curse not rejoice with them that do rejoice just remember that problem with that one year when they get blessed so they carry joystill they're jealous jealousy killing them but you see you have to get all that out your system and then you can apply the word your brother bless you rejoice with him say tell god give him a double portion oh glory to god you don't know what he has been true you don't know what hell he has been true you don't know what temptations he has been through and how you overcome oh glory to god and god change his name and change his work you see jacob walking so you don't know how we get at walk yeah again an accident you know he wrestled all night long so he can't walk normal something happened to him and just as something happened to him something has to happen to you oh give the lord some praises [Applause] all right rejoice with them that do rejoice weep with them that weep be of the same mind one towards another minor high things but condescending men of lower state be not wise in your own conceits recompense to no man evil for evil provide things honest in the sight of all men if it be possible as much as light in you live peaceably with all men daily beloved avenge not yourselves but rather give peace unto wrath for it is written vengeance is mine i will repeat says the lord let god repeat therefore here we go if thy enemy is hunger feed them don't say hungry good laying dead are you barely walk they suck sword no that's not christianity like church member business no sock salt no if you're enemy hunger feed they're not friends you know there's not family at all hey it was a macaroni pie you want some cheese you want some taste you want a burger there's not that channel this is the enemy you know there's somebody who will not do good for you that's why you must stop making excuses and make it a choice in your life to do what you need to do that is my motto i help because i want to help i love because i choose to love i act because i want to act whether you respond that is your business if you hit me back that is your business i will still give you because i want to give you you want to hear that is a business i want to love you you are the holy horse i want to forgive or give the lord up my choice i choose that i choose to walk in forgiveness oh glory to god i choose to walk in brotherly kindness you know why because our revelation broke 1981 on broadly kindness i was behind it but i said god forgive me why can't i forgive you and when i caught the revelation i can hold out against nobody because i know i brotherly kindness give me access to the holy spirit or give the lord a shout and i want to keep that access i want to keep that connection and then you break that you lost it all or give the lord some praises that's why he said when you stand praying forgive if you are old against any so right there is a key if you want to access spirit you have to come to this highlight of brotherly kindness god put the spirit on top of brotherly kindness you have to forgive look at jesus he's the father forgive them and what they say crucify him crucify him he dead yet you're looking for him to die he said father forgive them one man on the cross say why are you save us and save yourself too another man said lord remember me the old thief was everybody just shut him out with his crooks that man did nothing she said today you'll be with me now man i went to one service yeah who once spoke one book he listened to one tape yeah baptized in jesus name and he hear words here today you will be in oh that should make you want to shout this morning [Applause] [Music] god is sovereign he could save your son he could save your daughter he could save your marriage he could save your life he could fill you with the holy ghost he could heal you this morning all right therefore the enemy hunger feed him if he does give him drink for in so doing you he calls a fire on his head do not be overcome with evil do be not overcome of evil but overcome evil with good overcome evil with good what is faith it is something that revealed to you that is not yet but you believe it will be faith is a revelation of the will of god is not right and that's what the church is built upon revelation divine revelation so listen this i want to share something with you you can be informed by knowledge or you could be informed by revelation vote is information the difference revelation comes from above and it comes with stimulation knowledge is intellectual truth it is truth but it is intellectual truth it is not the same as revelation it's the same information but this one come by revelation flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto you that's why the devil's job is to fight you to come in the spirit because only the spirit could give you revelation as long as you sit in your flesh you only get an information knowledge of truth intellectual but if you get to your spirit you stand a chance you have an opportunity to become a channel that the spirit could descend and you get a vertical a vertical connection [Music] why the word is going horizontal the political spirit come down and reveal it to you and that's the rock that the devil can't change that's the rock upon which he built his church so that explains how some churches are dead and have thousands of people but stoned the minister behind the pulpit he did too but the people is intellectually stimulated in the gray matter they have no spirit there no revealing anointing because that reveal and anointing brings stimulation you know where stimulation is you ever died in the nighttime and you say you want a cup of coffee the coffees are stimulant you know just keep your eye open i want an eye opener drink a hot cup of coffee keep your eye up to finish what you have to do well wine is also a stimulant man drinking water when linking his head his lips lick his lips drinking wine i said i got glasses that they talk different hallelujah because he's drinking wine drinking water and drinking wine is not the same thing the word is the water but when revelation comes wine and wine have stimulation in it that's why jesus said you can't take new wine which is what we bring in this morning and put it in all bottles because when you put wine in bottle it's not glass bottle a skin bottle it does ferment in a stretch it'll stand up it has raised the hand the place has got too small after a while because it's revelation that coming by stimulation it does something on the inside oh give the lord a shout not something in your head something on your heart oh glory to god glory glory glory [Music] you think intellectual knowledge of isa could not keep abraham it's because the man of revelation he stuck at night he couldn't explain to sarah see right here whatever god himself told me i am going to have a sunny miser see her he heard me she eyes and she ears she heard but that hit and she hurt at all because god had speak to her you only ever say or to catch that it's for the spirit to reveal it to her so when abraham was going on the offer by zac he said he let me going up and i will not be coming back down he's not doing his head he's in faith that's why he was 11 is so clear prophet moses by faith jeff tag by faith samson joshua and by faith you do i have shout in the house you're not praising god because you're feeling the praise god god know what you're going through you raise your hand by faith you say amen by faith you stand up you give god blessed [Music] [Applause] wait a minute you figured he appreciated money multiple times a newsfeed it has some real terrible values you know every day is a war so watch so both are truths or both information is true but they come into different ways but there is another layer to this and this layer is the spirit of truth so the truth can be spoken preached exalted or shared and showed without the spirit of truth but you can see clearly why god said i would jesus said i rather have someone write in their spirit and wrong in their doctrine than someone who is writing the doctrine and wrong in their spirit no we know god didn't send a prophet for us to be right induction and wrong in the spirit no we have to be right in spirit and write induction also do you believe that amen so let me just hit the home stretch here but i'm talking about uh chicken chicken like a chicken if you lay egg a hen if she hasn't been with the male bird rooster it will never hatch it is unfull tile and that's the way with people who profess christ many of them look like christians try to act like christians but you have to got to have christ on the inside of you which is the word made manifest or it will never mature into a real bible even christians so therefore just like church members you can baby them call them make them dickens everything else you have a nest full of rotten eggs unless they have mated with the meat so in other words god have to give you a supernatural touch not yourself smoking stop drinking the buddhist could do that so this is not that this is not abhorrence here you stop doing this stuff in the uh party you know you're right you come out but you have to go in so in other words something supernatural have to take place in your life this community is not supernatural enough despite working here but right there you sit down on your pew you have to warn something supernatural you have thousands of people going to church this morning and hearing messages and living the same way they're just doing their duty some some people do they're not on facebook on social media church churches and social media when they go to church they see this that their facebook they're seeing faces there's where they meet people and say hello hi you follow what i'm saying so when jesus came he came to produce a revolution he came and made the traditions set in their ways pharisees scribe sadducees hallelujah but i miss them all them people with all the degrees and all this so he said you know they have seeds out there and he ain't go to them and say pharisees you know i want to introduce myself i'm jesus and you know i know they're reading this school is a long time and you are the people who are supposed to get this revelation he didn't do that he said peter come on andrew come i said a bunch of fishermen them came read and write and he called them to show that this is not my might or power but the callings by the spirit so when the spirit called them the spirit had to reveal things to them peter said that what the christ next man peter said though shall not go undying you're gonna die jesus said get behind me satan just rebuke them bust them straight them out love them care for them tell them after converted striking the brethren they were sons of god they were just like you and i strugglers and stragglers fighters and warriors but they have a destination to get to the upper room because you know the opponent will fix them up that's where they get the vaccination inoculation praise god hallelujah praise god for all them disease and viruses that lucifer had out there oh glory to god and when they get out of the upper room and get the first dose oh glory to god they were so charged up and peter staggered out of the upper room fully inoculated fully protected he says still van gogh had i none i could share this thing you know because this thing flowing through me you know i'm anointed i'm appointed i'm commissioned i have life inside of me i have healing inside of me of power inside of me where i am i give it to you [Applause] that is what god wants to do through you that's what god wants to do by you glory to god god and make you a little higher than the animals he make you a little lord and angels give the lord some praises he made man a little older than the angels [Applause] so you talk about the shock remember there's no more he promised to woman after mary so what's what higa sarah mary three woman and after mary was the promised seed no more woman to come after that just he promised seed now notice how close it is matthew said 24 24 the two spirits in the last days listen though we nail it down here now the church spirit of the church people and the bright spirit of the bright people would be so close till it would receive the very elected as possible he called it a church spirit of what the church people and the pride spirit of the bright people and i'm identifying the bright spirit as seven perfect spirits as reflected in second peter 1 4 7. all hell is against that every demon in hell against that because that is original you know all this computer all this program all the things you're doing you're pressing this and doing whatsapp and typing there's a source code behind that you are seeing the front part but behind that have what you call resource code and that source code written copyrighted what not is what they call the original code now sometimes they allowed what you call open source where people can directly access it and they have what you call closed source like apple and certain companies you kind of tamper with what is behind here others have it that you could go into it and that's why some companies have different skins over their phone like samsung have android and have a certain way and they phone a certain way but behind that have original code and they put a layer on top of it well god called his original code source code original source and meant to stamp and twist and make it say all kind of thing but if you'll ever ever if you ever want to know what is right you go back to the original source and that is why it's your right to check out to see if these things be so yeah if it was being spoken and being taught if it's in the word because they want to get back to the original source isn't that right so but imam says this here he says there's got to be something that cannot be denominated it is the entirety of the life has to produce itself again on the bride what is the entire picture of their life second peter 147 that is christ spirit to be back in the church that is the only thing that cannot be denominated what cannot be nominated the life isn't that right there cannot be any more churches you see you said no watch the full word okay so the life leaves the shock and the shock is a carrier and that's just exactly what our denomination has been a carrier so that is why you can't who under baptist method this week all of them had a portion of their life at a time but their life move on because the life that they plant in the sea the travel truths talk and whatnot it must end back up in the seed so god said i'm alpha and omega and the rest in between his processes so the seed i was planting the pentecost went through processes and end up with you that is why your age bride is have to come after pentecost which is a shock because you are coming back to the original green oceans do you believe that oh glory that means if we go back to original brain we have to manifest what those elites had nothing less than that having church is not what the holy spirit had having groups and and fellowships that's not what the church had they had the same life same signs same wonders same power man fall dead in church race on the dead continue preaching same life do you believe that [Music] so justification will save a man you believe that it was a carrier of the word a carrier it in the life then a long come signification then come pentecost the restoration of the gifts and when you come down to see when you come to say i and my father won and these are the things then the shock pulls away but the real genuine bride church will bring forth the entire word of god in its fullness and in its strength oh i'm looking for that he's the same yesterday today and forever oh praise god and at the opening of the seven seas revelation 10 the full word is to be born into manifestation so we lost the world to seven ages right got it to gather all the word and bring the forward back and then he promised that the footwork will be born into manifestation isn't that right the shockers gave fortitude strengthened to the seed it went out of it it went on out it was a good shock it's silver's time but it is a world ride of the weird room three denominational ages carriers which also must die and dry up just like the shock and soul fought to give room for the seed the seed here we go cannot get right cannot get right until the shock stalk leaves all dry that's right it sucks every bit of the life in them and and that's it it's virgin wood time not touched it you put you said there will be no denominational manhandling of the virgin boot of the bride so i'm skipping too quickly i want to wrap up now what she is now a dry shock the spirit of god passed through her is true that is why people have testimonies 20 years ago 20 years ago what god do with them they have no testimony now because the spirit used to be with them did you hear that that's why they don't go back in over the history you know because i want to know going on now because when you see me yesterday you see him today since they go back too far that's good god was with them god was and so 20 years and 30 years ago working in them what is happening right now because no faith is isn't that right hallelujah so what she is dry shocked the spirit of god passed through her and will not listen this is important she this church will not be heir with the vindicated seed word she will not be in the rapture so this second timothy tree spirit will not be in the rapture you are part of that you were involved in that you connected with that no rapture for you the bride is going in the rapture and that is what going in the rapture give me a quote he said this being is the servant of god in the church of god this being when it's completed is the servant of god in the church of god that's going in the rapture so when that is completed in you you're going in the rapture rapture will be inside of you oh no rapture coming for you you have the rapture oh glory to god right now you have the rapture in mechanic formed but that seed would have to clean the dynamics that seed would have to be transformed into the kingdom of god oh glory to god thereby jesus behold the kingdom is within you god put the seed inside of you devil can't go inside there there the word alone is the desire of the thoughts and intents of the heart god know what he put inside of you [Music] that why when you were backstage god was laughing because the devil didn't know who you were you didn't know who you were but when god ready and he set the alarm clock ready to find you you couldn't help it you had to stagger out of what you're interested into this oh my hallelujah so watch so the seed will produce itself it's the same yesterday and forever that's wood scene again the seed will produce itself you put a coin see the cargo mango tree from that the seed will produce itself same pill of fire showing the same signs the same wonders watch so it has to be a reproduction of the green here what he said a spirit comes upon the bride to do the same thing he did it's the reproducing again of the green which is the original green how could we reproduce it without the spirit coming upon us even jesus had to get his spirit upon him he said the spirit is upon me i'm not hearing you when the spirit came along upon him when john was about to baptize he saw the dove coming upon jesus and that dove led him into the wilderness to overcome satan and satan still didn't know who that really was that's why i saved though we as though we and jesus blessed him with the words written it is written it is also written so for all these years we ripping with the word because the devil only have two to two options send matthew 24 24 along with second timothy tree to try to deceive you and when he got received he recognized now he had to make war with the remnant of the woman's seed because you on your way to the rapture oh glory to god i feel inspired right now do you understand the devil hole attempt was to deceive the bride but he cannot it's impossible guess why guess why the bribe will not be received because the bride will be the word [Applause] the bride will become the word itself and that word will defeat the devil anywhere anytime any place under any condition [Music] [Applause] oh glory glory glory and with the wreck revelation nobody can mess up with your head glory but whatever and the same holy spirit that was in jesus will have to be operating in his church to make them coincide together at the rapture or it won't go so don't tell me i'm crazy i am not i want to see the same spirit and don't tell me i'm a man and you know no no his blood died he paid the price that his blood could sanctify us to give us access rights [Music] that god could use us for his glory come on now come on now [Applause] david david shepherd boy hallelujah he found himself in a spot where nobody was moving israel has been challenged nobody is their cause hallelujah and david step forward i will fight him not as he expects me to fight him as a devil job david eccles sword no shield no hunter and combat he will fight the way god anointed him to fight you just can't just fight for what you know it's yours you have to fight for what you have to know what you have to be up against and goliath coming i could hear him boop boop not any goliath but this one is different he's glad i've got this god goliath he's the biggest bodies of them all world concert churches coming down we've got light of god no intellectual spirit could deal with that it has to be the holy ghost on fire has to go the same spirit of elijah that rest upon elijah it has to be an anointed and commissioned bride oh glory to god amen my praise god thank you jesus hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord so much of things i have here but oh glory to god hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord but i'm talking about after the messenger comes then these impersonators rise up they're playing mini prophet they're playing mini sonoma they're playing revealer and revelator oh hell yeah they come by them yet i hear them daddy hear the mysteries i hear the talk god said behold i send you the world elijah the prophet and he have a job to do he shall turn the heart of the children i like how god has talked you know by these divinely revealed mystery truths he gonna turn the hearts of a children back to the faith of the fathers but that's not all what he said he said the or porn of the spirit that's the thing would bring the faith into the people it has all got to come together not by might not by power the church will be rebuilt in the power of the spirit god gonna raise up some rebuilders oh glory to god not letter preachers preachers anointed by the holy ghost and power and paul said my preaching didn't come with enticing words of man's wisdom but i come preaching with the power and demonstration of the spirit that your faith may rest where on the power of god we need to see the power of god godzilla exposed hypocrites already liars are ready false prophets already hallelujah they exposed outside no god coming on the inside oh glory to god hallelujah thank you lord jesus my my my my my praise god praise god baron said there's two spirits influencing the earth here now he said he licked he said what you're two spirits so close formal the outside of a former garden as you see but these two spirits the real spirits will be so close it receives very elected they was working side by side in the last days there's some demonology he said now what they're looking over the top of the real thing he said but i'm talking a lot of your time taking a lot of time but you got to see this friend if i never see you again you got to know what demons are you got to know what truth and error is and it's so close you got to separate the thing let's give a picture here now he said no there are blackness and gaity and so on two forces i want to skip that oh my all right he said they're men my dear christian friends demons are working on every hand and god's spirit is moving right out on the other hand to counteract it every time there you are now what demons working yesterday i had them in the physical realm today i'm showing you in the spiritual realm where they are at in the religious realm in the natural realm they're called cancer and called this that the other but they are devils and over here in the religious realm they are pious esau was a very religious man he said now watch he said no and today many people are listening and so many people are listening to enticing spirits instead of taking the word of god so something spirit talking something come to you and something tell i hear a voice yeah there's something void by the word you'll just run with every voice that talk to you they ever talking to you have mountain hallelujah that's spread fallen 400 prophets i mean the prophecy ally one time brother branham was going and castle the epileptic spirit he asked the people to bow there close the eye irreverent and a bunch of people started carrying on they're watching he said please and whatnot and the spirit leave he said the spirit gonna leave and he swear to leave and follow all of them all of them take up epilepsy after that the spirit you're talking about oh glory to god bride spirit and church spirit oh holy spirit and demon spirit but the reception is in the religious realm because church people having a form of godliness oh glory to god hallelujah but abram says enticing spirits coming down substituting something from the word of god there is nothing to substitute faith faith has no substitute hope will never take the place of faith faith is alone it stands alone hope can never take its place isn't that right watch the old fella down here the prophet the preacher he was so sure he was right he made himself a pair of horns and danced around and remember what the prophet said if god talked to me if you come back why didn't you talk to me are you feeling anointed and carrying on he said because we can be so emotional don't mean that you're saved because you go to church don't mean we are saved don't believe those entities and spirits a real spirit of god is the truth of god which is the seed of god will produce god in your life and be godly and saintly and holy among a lot of people we find where the emotions and so forth they become tattlings and back titans and all kind of godly things that's sulfuric acid and it's demon powers spirit of men and women who get among one another this is not right this is not right that's not right if you chase it down nine times out of ten is the very person making this still that is not right but as long as you know your life is deviant with the bible with purity of heart preaching of thought love towards your brother trying your best to build the kingdom of god doing those things dressing right living right you say you gotta have all the emotions you want to do and everybody would believe it o praise the name of the lord thank you lord oh praise god mission comma please thank you lord jesus hallelujah let's continue he said now watch these two spirits they are so close that they will receive the very elective possible these are you ready these two spirits are marking their people for future judgment this is serious this is serious the spirits saying this is minds this is minds this is minds this is mine the being marked now judgment come later the bride that has been marked your judgment will be the rapture judgment is reward the church member spirit their judgment is true and i have tribulation period that is judgment that church members in this message people do believe it have a tribulation you're talking about the woman in in in america is that judgment coming after you know yeah yeah but wrong side of my vision i don't know what this woman the guy can say is this one but judgment is coming god's setting it up and we have to be ready these two spirits are marking their people for future judgment oh my hallelujah they're skipping through i'm almost finished i was president of getty at this time about a steve message let me show you the reason why satan hates this book of the revelation of jesus christ in the church he knows that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever and he changes not he knows that a whole lot more than do 90 of the illusions he knows that since god is immutable in his nature he's also immutable in his weight which is unchangeable right does satan knows assuredly that the original church talk about the original source code original church at pentecost with the power of god mark 16 and action is the true church not mark 16 explanation mark 16 in action action and explanation is two different things so we're not talking about teachings and revelations and explanations we talk about it in action thus satan knows that the original church at pentecost with the power of god max is in action is the true church of jesus claim as his own all else is false let me say it again all else is false now remember christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts and the book of revelation shows how the antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal and powerless lukewarm formal powerless lukewarm formal poreless all they have is a nice preacher but that is not the original church because the original church had christ walking among them isn't that right it exposes satan revealing his works attempted destruction of god's people and the spreading of god's word right down to the time he's cast on liquor fire he fights that he cannot stand it here we go he knows this is where i get the whole thought from if the people get the true revelation of the true church what she is one what she stands for and that she can do the greater works she will be an invincible army what does brothers even preach a super church a super race as she has a headstone oh glory to god do you think the devil just oakman says justin no you're seeing what you're up against now oh hallelujah watch he knows that if the people get a true evolution of the true church what she is and what she stands for that she can do the greater works she will be invisible army if they get a true revelation here we go of the two spirits within the framework of the christian church and when they get a revelation what you do next and by god's spirit discern and withstand you mean all is part of the package we are reaching super church if we got this here and with stan you know yeah i'm jumped into a spirit center oh hallelujah discern and withstand watch the antichrist spirit satan will be powerless before her oh glory to god he will be definitely taught it today as when christ withstood his every effort to gain power over him satan hates revelation but we love it with true revelation in our lives the case of hell cannot prevail against us but we will reveal against them so this morning i pray and trust god give you a revelation of the two spirits praise god put it like two spirits working in your life oh glory to god the bad animal and the good animal the good dog and the bad dog and ram says which one you feed one time an indian man come and tell by the banana and here he finds his two dogs one wants him to do good one no bad he is which one you feed which one you're feeding what is working in your life there are two forces working in your life which one you're gonna feed which one you're gonna yield to oh glory to god let's all stand and give god some praises this morning oh glory to god you love him two spirits within the framework of the christian church listen friends two million people came out of egypt just two went in

light bread we want me give us meat give us water give us this give us that just take us and god was given them but he wanted to show how he really was you want him to bring them up to the promised land you see friends your journey is not the promise some people don't enjoy the journey they want to get there they want to get there and they want to get there so bad and their mind and whatnot and they failed to wash their trees and the flowers and the road and the people passing by they failed to see those that they could have helped only study the self and the goodness itself they failed to see who they could have served who they could have brought along with them this beautiful journey it's a journey it's a journey some of us has been on journey a long time it's not easy it's a journey

actually so uh sister donaque looking for prayer for her daughter-in-law chanel clark who is suddenly having severe abdominal pain and bleeding and being taken to the hospital that god would intervene and destroy the plans of the enemy in the name of jesus christ you could play something softly and i also want to uh with us to pray for our pastor this morning and uh you know he preached this morning and few would know how much peen he was in uh whether anthony had to help him put on his jacket this morning just over there to help him to get dressed this morning and he had to drive with one hand he's getting some tremendous pain in his right shoulder and his right arm he didn't even sleep that much last night he had to sleep on the ground actually so much pain so we want to remember him in prayer knowing that the enemy is fighting but there's power in the church of the living god and we understand that the enemy would intensify because he'll be mad when this bride leaves this place so we we understand what we are up against we understand the the role that the enemy has to play but we also understand our role and what we have to do as well so we want to approach the throne of grace this morning unite with me in faith this morning our gracious heavenly father we thank you this morning that we could be in your divine presence lord and to lord to hear this message this morning lord of the two spirits within the framework of the church lord this is something that was identified and true scripture it started lord all the way back in genesis though with these two trees that were there in the garden lord and lord worked its way throughout all of time and lord all the way to the time of jesus and all the way lord through the church ages this war lord it has come lord to this very day and this very hour and for this entire year thus far lord we have been speaking about this war lord we started speaking about the divine strategy of god against all the forces of darkness the principalities and the powers and we come to this last day of january lord speaking about these two spirits within the framework of the church lord to understand that this war is about to come to an end and satan is mad but we are lord coming into our position never before the face of the earth has there been a people like this people never before on the face of the earth has there been a coming together of all the forces of darkness and at the same time all that was in god that was poured into christ that is brought into the church of the living god is coming to see a pride in power a bride walking in authority with the spirits the spirit of god sevens perfect spirits of that one great holy spirit lord we thank you for the unfolding of the word and how you continue to reveal yourself to us lord that we are to be born sons of filled sons of placed sons that are coming to maturity and to come into adoption lord we thank you lord for all the praises that lord the saints have brought lord and all the testimonies of what you have done how you have kept us how you have preserved us and how you have healed us how you have delivered us how you have restored us if we had more tongues it still would not be enough to thank you if we had other ways to express it it would not be enough to thank you we are limited with our vocabulary we are limited with our words up we are limited with what we can bring to you but we are here in the house of god bringing a sacrifice of praise of despite how we feel lord and we see our past up despite how we felt he had every reason to stay at home this morning but he reported for duty in the house of the living god and he stood at his post of duty and minister the word of god without saying a word of heavenly father may you move into that study right now and may you touch our pastor from the crown of his head to the soul of his feet may you touch that shoulder that shoulder with the pain we come against it in the name of jesus christ may he be completely healed may that attack be repelled by the word of god this morning house of hell give way to the name of jesus we come against every sickness not just in his body but through the body of christ under the sound of my voice this morning satan your time is up we serve you notice as a church of the living god against every principality against every power

group five please uh metered by the black man after the service and next week uh group four which is about a marlins group uh is scheduled uh to clean and one final announcement we would have sent out uh some communication through but over with respect to our announcement last week uh brother felix would be here uh next sunday to represent voice of god um with respect to the agapo tablets and they quite simply don't have enough for everyone so we had to kind of work with brother felix to see what can be done and their whole purpose is to really uh be able to give these uh firstly and most importantly those who may not be able to afford to buy one so we have to kind of try to prioritize in that but they quite simply don't have enough for the island so we would be getting a portion of what we would have requested uh so brother will will if he has not already done so he will get a notification of it and uh they'll be here to distribute those uh next week uh sunday lord willing about an hour or so after the service uh they'll have a presentation as well and they'll also have some other material from voice of god uh as well here so even though you may not be collecting you are certainly welcome for the presentation they'll do a bit of a presentation to us as well so we encourage you even if you're not collecting you can stay for the presentation and certainly if you have been contacted uh about collecting you have to collect it in person they will not be giving it to anyone on your behalf so that is part of the way that this will be unfolding but anthony can you just thank you [Music] i just want to leave you with one thing before we go you know we would have read this in uh proverbs 3 in one of our studies um a couple weeks about and it really struck me i said i will leave you with a with a scripture uh for this week and to kind of encourage you and it's proverbs 3 verse 5 it says trust in the lord with all thine heart and lead not until thine own understanding and i really want to strike in verse 6 we know it and i said the simplicity of it sometimes we we miss the simplicity of it it says in all thy ways acknowledge him and he shall direct thy path you know and i was thinking that in so many decisions we have to make in life we need direction you want to know that you're doing the right thing and that you're walking the right way and you're approaching things in the right way and the answer to the right way or the direction of your path is in a principle this is actually it's like a contract so he says in all thy ways acknowledge him and he shall direct that part so it's connected so once you do the acknowledgement the direction takes place and you know i was having a conversation around this one verse and and you know you would know how much how much passion i have around scripture and and it made me question how in how many ways do we actually acknowledge him you know and and we we do things and do we acknowledge him in our actions because he says in all thy ways acknowledge him so if there's a way an approach a thing you're doing that you're not acknowledging him then you are not activating his part of directing you so when you begin to acknowledge him so you're going down the road but you're acknowledging him on the way to try to go down the road because you want him to direct your path the moment you attempt to do anything without acknowledging him you are walking in your own pathway i want you to catch that but when you begin to acknowledge him so somebody said it to me so simply he said he was going into a meeting and he said lord i acknowledge you before i enter into this meeting it is simple yet powerful because you realize that nothing you could ever see will matter if you don't acknowledge him but if you acknowledge him in approaching it you have a meeting with somebody lord i acknowledge you before i make this phone call i acknowledge you before i drive the car i acknowledge you as i wake up this morning i acknowledge you because if it wasn't because of you i wouldn't wake up this morning this is different from prayer now this is you being as bad over speaking of that vertical connection because you want to acknowledge him and it and it's clear in all thy ways so there's no way that you should have where there is no acknowledgement there's nothing that you should do that you cannot acknowledge so it makes you also look at your ways because a way is is a way of action is a way of so if you can't acknowledge him and how you speak then you need to check how you're speaking if you can't acknowledge him and where you're going you need to check what you're doing anybody with me so i want to leave you with this scripture to meditate on this because your strength your success comes from meditating on this word day and night trust in the lord with all thine heart and lean not unto thine own understanding in all thy ways acknowledge him and he shall direct thy path may the lord richly bless you may you have a wonderful week may you have a blessed week may you have a victorious week may you have an overcoming week may you face your trials and face your fire and face everything with all the strength that god placed in your soul to be an overcomer he promised to never give you more than you could hear may the lord richly bless you but anthony
