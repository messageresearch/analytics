let's let me read my scriptures if you have a bob was lucky invite attention to Genesis chapter 1 and our versions of a 12 and Leviticus 23 Genesis chapter 1 read verse 2 through verse 5 and that's where I get my charter from this morning Judge super 1 begin to read from verse 2 and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light and there was light and goes to the light that was good and God divided the light from the darkness and God called the light day and the darkness he called night and the evening and the morning were the first day as well my title is from Matata and the evening and the morning were the first day Amen let's go right back to your revelation from Genesis right down to Revelation in chapter 12 and this began about the war in heaven arre verse 7 through verse 11 and we have the marker you can go to Leviticus 23 verse 33 through 36 provision 12 re from verse 7 and there was wine in heaven Michael and his angels fought against the Dragon and the dragon fought and his angels and prevailed not neither was their place found any more in heaven and the Great Dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and Satan which deceives the whole world he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now is come salvation and strength and the Kingdom of our God and the power of his Christ for the accuser of our brethren is cast down which accused them before our God day and night and they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of the testimony and they loved not their lives unto the death finally our thin scripture for the convention Leviticus chapter 23 verse 33 through verse 36 and the Lord speaking to Moses saying speak on to the tune of Israel saying the fifteenth day of this seventh month shall be the feast of tabernacles for seven days unto the Lord on the first day shall be an holy convocation ye shall do no servile walk there in seven days you shall offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord on the eighth day shall be an holy convocation unto you and he shall often often made by fire unto the Lord it is solemn assembly and he shall do no servile walk therein amen mid lot a dispensary no his holy words amen god bless you shot by his mother pray Heavenly Father we thank you for grace to be here again this morning we pray Lord that you bless your work we have read your word your word is already blessed I will pray you bless the preaching of your word is mine father place the believers and friends within I get this morning will be careful that they know yourself to give alone or the praising on glory Wesley in Jesus name a male man god bless you may be seated my child one more time from Genesis to born there and the evening and the morning were the first day amen all the things got to be here today are you happy amen brother Raymond what a pleasant voice by the Ramona I understood but the Ray - no I'm fine okay god bless you brother ray that was the tomatoes meeting last night amen I'm sorry I miss the song Savage I really wanted to be a tube to dance in the room there because last night was truly outstanding but that's what the kind of commission that has given us here we've had a great Italian convention and if we had a go home now you gotta go for the first service it was worth it all and for me personally I want to be thankful I'm thankful to God for being here because this was one convention that was I was not supposed to be considering so many things but I think God got me the way and we think got to be here so on behalf of my wife and family and our Church in Lagos a portion of who is here I want to thank but all of it my dear from Dovie for the vision to be here and for the holy work I was in yesterday about him brother robe later they've been together for a long time and we've been together for a long time ah I was in the group but I was invisible so we grew up together and I remember you know we brother over will be in brother Michael makhmur house in you know in New York in Brooklyn I know boys together sleep on the floor together and just chat together and we all had I mean a whole lifetime ahead of us and we have been friends through thick and thin of it and we are so thankful to be here but we thank you for the additional be here amen like I said before I was here when the child was dead Akira Maeda fit in 1996 and brother IO who's passed on to glory and I were gonna come here for the Saturday night service and Sunday morning service but somehow we got in just as the time about the channel based on a study of in-service was finishing so we ended up coming all the way like brother sir almost yesterday all the way from Nigeria for just one service so some of our folks just got in last night so I told them once you can make you for one savy that's fine because I came here for one service before and I got a blessing too so we are so frankly fearful of it and I want to thank you and the great Church in Trinidad Sangre can't cry now where's a Rhema that's where you

that you know the host pastor has some in his hat and Bogut is not speaking but God got you to get the right message the right foods and talking about that pop when I was trying to do some I turn this on this mine so yeah I was trying to do it so I was sure I get a PowerPoint and I'll get it there and now just I just be like well Peter you know so I didn't go work out for me brother Robledo had

their only platform wedding coworkers are adding some raw sheets and things like that so but Peter I need to take some tutorials again but I always I'm trying to convert me from this paper walk to these technologies in four years so you might have a very saw student on your hands boy that was really tremendous brother Peter it was your application but it was outstanding outstanding outstanding and our folks in Lagos many of them saw it but they played that in church this money for a morning service honest and the whole church was blown apart and they want their feet throughout for the tomato specimen was a message and the quotes your hat I mean he said it tone for the convention one simple childlike God we should bless you we're together again the best bachelor amen amen and brother Isaac well eyes like the spare tire I told that you know for a very well tuned car many times this pathogen is and span shape the spirit I made them is better than the real time and that was what happened on Friday night but Isaac that was tremendous that was that was outstanding I was telling my wife brother Isaac is a real asset to brought but the feel really and if both are the son another co-worker that's done pasture because you can get him in anytime if you want to get me in to do a service that's not my service you're not gonna get me to do it so I was thinking about the

the last time we were together you know in Ivory Coast remember the ryokan the puppy I want I want but the rape sleeves rolled up ready for battle you want to fight Satan Elohim is ready God someone

buy Isaac last night and I felt I'm gonna know when whatever is gonna hold obviously but I get so distracted I was right in mind my tattoo and all that and before I look at this list we already rolled over but that was tremendous last number the raid hours absolutely outstanding absolutely outstanding I mean he's so string though we've come so quickly to the last day of the Convention and they've been telling me about the journey yesterday that Sunday's coming Sunday's coming so it's Sunday now so uh I'm telling mother Johnny Sunday night is coming I'll tell him brother Johnny Sunday Mary's

any challenge sunday means a brand-new day sunday means the Sun is here amen thank God for Sunday amen God richly bless you amen so this morning amen I just want to put my sled the wheel and say a few words out of the scriptures and metallic gain a series and the even and the morning were the first day and we've been in the meetings and we've had a lot of badly it's a holy convocation and brother brother of it you know told us how that came to him pure inspiration I didn't even think of it so it's something he's story so long but God said it the holy convocation and brother Peter Chandler pick it up and set us on a right path and everybody's been the meeting and I'm sure like you were thankful the girl you were in this convocation now what is the convocation I mean in Nigeria and in in the I don't know about after Africa but in West Africa generally when universities and colleges do their degree award programs the coil like a convocation like a convocation is a an assembly a large assembly way a lot of people gather may be our words and rewards are gonna be given out where people are gathered together I know the Americans college commencement ceremonies I don't know what they call it here but that's a convocation where people are gathered together is a coming together of people and these are holy convocation and it's an eighth day holy convocation so it's a bit specific now what happens in a convocation the Bible lets us know that the Bible lets us see that because 23 we read let's just see what happens in a convocation and follow me this morning the preachers already preached the word so I'm just going to you know add my I put my sled the wheels or the Jesus said is a long-running preacher I don't think you can take that title from me but I just don't even try don't try I'm wrong and whiny sometimes and one other but the old what is wrong with you what are you even saying so I just pray for me that I don't I don't be end up in long and winding today but I'll try I'll try but no what happens in a convocation we all want you to know what happens in convocation then we know what we are looking for here we know what we're supposed to be what we're supposed to be looking for here and we can with yes go for it amen in the convocation from everything else I just try to you know see as I go along what happens the convocation got to Moses gather people together 15 the other seventh month I think the first one is April so this would be like the fifteenth of October which was the seventh month and gather people together for an assembly and seven days they will have this assembly and on the eighth day is that the frost day will be a holy convocation to you and you shall do no servile work therein is not a suggestion is not an idea is a command you shall do no servile work therein amen and every single day of those are seven days the first day and then at seven more days you shall have a holy convocation amen and then on the eighth day will be similar to the first day and on that day he added some more instructions to it instead you do no servile work but he also said a man is a solemn assembly now this is solemn not as in morning is insulin as in serious it'll soon a machine is not a place with it don't take it lightly don't take this assembly lightly we are here for for serious business when I'm here it's not a solemn assembly like somebody has died and we are mourning no it's a serious assembly when I play more games here that's why we call this assembly or it Oh God amen kinetic on my jacket or a glory of God a man a man may be seated amen so he said it said it's a solemn assembly number one number two he said you shall offer an offering unto the Lord who is wanting to offer an offering but you qualify the offering it says you shall often often made by fire unto the Lord consumer is not hallelujah like for example we said can I have a shot in the house then I can hear you can have a shot in the house a man you may be seated and often meant by fire a man we put some fire under the offering a man a man glory to God a man you may be seated when you often often put some finding that makes it a sacrifice amen and you know the only person that offers is sacrifice to the Lord is a priest amen so in this holy convocation here you come here with the recognition that you are a priest unto the Lord to have your offering your sacrifice to offer to God hallelujah glory to God amen amen come on you priests of the Lord amen you maybe see that amen amen [Applause] now let's talk a little bit about this let's talk a little bit about this preach priesthood let's talk about it about this mission here because you know a priest offers a sacrifice unto the Lord so when God says each one of the house full of easel each one of us here will offer an offer made by five to the Lord is a recognition that we are and doesn't the public say we are kings and priests unto the Lord and we shall reign on the earth so something letting you understand how we run about a time tell me letting you understand this is what is this what this whole equation is about to tell me to get on my hip you are a priest unto the Lord you are a king unto the Lord you've got power you got Authority you got Dominion that's what God told way to tell the people get out of your ass here get up your money spots hallelujah stand on your feet you are gonna offer an offering made by fire do i apprec-- come on you priests of the Lord hallelujah or a glory look garden man amen amen you may be seated and then every priest is known body often or sulphides the office now Jesus Christ our Lord is called the high priest of our confession in other words what he trusted God is our confession he takes our confession and offer to God that's high becomes the high priest of our confession whatever we confess he offers you to thought and the happiest make sure to make sure you make sure we get whatever we confess hallelujah so in this holy convocation here you are going to get what you confess [Music] your confession is your sacrifice your confession is your sacrifice and whatsoever you convinced they have pre stands there to offer to God hallelujah and that's why in this only complication here there's no negative talk like whether it was selling last night there's no weakness there's no I can't les no he's not working out no sir whatsoever you convinced the high priest exit to the Lord be careful be careful what you're saying because your high priest is just gonna make sure you get what you what you asked for amen hallelujah hallelujah so this holy convocation here the high priest God is making sure our speech is gonna change our attitude is gonna change everything is gonna change we're gonna defy everything else where there is weakness when it is a Lord I'm so weak everything is all going wrong for me that's your confession that's your sacrifice you are bringing and that's what the high priest takes to the Lord be careful now because they have presets as you are setting mine ears so will I do unto you amen hallelujah a holy convocation Oh glory to God amen amen amen amen amen oh brother joy good to see you wanna see a long time no see a catchin fellowship we have some little fellowship oversee catch and fellowship well your people Julian Assange any man a man I was telling him I was privileged to see you know when he listens the first time as a 15 year old I think was you know and his remaining you remain faithful in the house of God ever since amen so anyway so this holy convocation here those four things are supposed to happen it gotten together of the people because it's sembly son assembly is a serious hour enough for people who are not made up in their minds to just go not for people who are you know just loitering around and lollygagging around or not for people who you have to tell them come on Gracie what's going on Oh God to moyes with the other people that and God himself make sure that each person know Moses going around each person you want to call the assembly and tell them this is the work of the Lord to them and each person was gonna sit up and get on the horse I know it tippy-toe message is no time to fool around here it's time to cut off every foolishness it's time to stay on our toes it's time to know that the Holy Spirit is here with us to bring to pass every divine promise that we a man hallelujah amen so it's a solemn assembly amen it's a serious hour amen tell the people amen whatever they confess that's their sacrifice so he said what do I confess sin mac-11 jesus said whatsoever things you desire when you pray believe that you should have them that's not my own believe in your heart the number two use whatsoever you say you shall have what you say too many times we live on the privilege too many times we just believe this gospel doesn't work but this gospel works these gospel works and let me prophesy you are gonna leave this convention here you are going to find out you are in a holy convocation and at the holy convocation and all the things that happen in a holy convocation are going to follow you every single day of your life from here on out in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Oh hallelujah you may be seated amen and the number four in a holy convocation is that you do no servile walk there in the word seven what it means it is the kind of work the kind of labor that sleeves do it's kind of Labor the people who are freezing too so good job Stan a holy convocation to break your chains of slavery to break your chains of bondage that's what it represents I don't know what you are in bondage to this morning I don't what prison house you are in but the Holy Spirit that calls for the meetings has been showing you through the convention that he's got to break every chain break every chain break every chain in the name of Jesus Christ and we have the authority of the Holy Spirit to break every King whatever demon whatever spirit whatever ken has upon this morning those are being broken yet in the minutes it shall be a broken today sunday is coming sunday is coming and Sunday is here sunday is here to break every chain because you shall do no sleepwalking this day you're not a slave to Iassogna car you are a ton of a king you are not a slave [Applause] Gloria [Applause] glory to God amen

the Most High God shake up the slaves shake with the chains of punish the holy spirits in the house and you are free today nor demon most spirit is powerful enough to hold you in bondage this anointing that you feeling these men is here is too much for any spirit any devil a paralyzing Satan Satan is paralyzed this morning you may be seated [Applause] Oran Oh Lauren so you be the change of

convocation my confession to my high priest I am strong how I am strong you're free not gonna make it I am killed me already made it but for the Friends of the world I already made it you have fair confess courage you have pain confess healing amen you may be seated [Applause] Corre Dora Corre Ducati amen amen [Applause] so if you have sickness money before the prayer lunch and I begin a conference your healing that's how it comes the high priest has it and will make your body obey your confession if you are weakened from strength if you are freakin Fey storage hallelujah glory to God in many men or glory and you shall have what you see you may be seated Oh glory to God in man amen I know the devil the devil sneaks around and says you are confessing in line you are confessing a lie oh no I'm not oh no you are not oh no you are not you know why because you are only a framing that your confession is built upon faith in the finished work he already did the work for you hallelujah

the game of Eden I'm walking around again Avedon what day was he living in Adam was born on Adam was created on the sixth day right and God on the seventh day rested so what Adam in the seventh day or what deal was he in because after the number seven God you see anymore because God is the eternal yes the he has the understanding here here's the revelation here before my brother branham said not me bring in the revelation gonna religion to bring but I BAM reveal all the mysteries some of the revelations has been brother branham reveal the mysteries a man every mystery has already been revealed no no cut no new mysteries amen everybody has the understanding coming from but the Bam's words the sampled a leader was still time so when God rested on the seventh day it was still in time and God doesn't leave in time what is the revelation here then number seven number seven the rest on the number seven is your passageway is your breach between number six and number eight that's what bridges you over into eternity God was showing Adam you've got to enter into my rest and when you enter to my rest you'll break into the eighth day holy convocation when you break into the ED the only competition you on this out here but your eternal life but a ritual lesson you got an eternal quality to you and that's why for every young man every young woman you can rest until the paths of the Holy Ghost and fire burns into your soul hallelujah don't want to give you the Holy Ghost more than you deserve to have the Holy Ghost you may be seated so like God Adam found rest I'm but that resi entering to the eighth day and live in eternity so Adam was written living in the eighth day he lived on in eternity in Eden heaven dropped down the channel drop down in Eden Adam wasn't living the seven-day in Eden he was living in eternity he wasn't a holy convocation with God all nature he was right there him in heaven the channel was raining in the affairs of men on the face of the earth and there is your holy convocation or glory of God amen hallelujah amen amen amen come with me now a hundred million years to that eternity so we'll see what the holy convocation the God dropped down in Genesis was really all about come with me 800 million years for the venom said are you ready their speech Sudan go your spiritual thinking jackets on we know these things northern new we've been well taught these just put the message together for you amen so the number-1 to number-6 was creation in number seven was the rest the bridge amen to bridge between the time and eternity and Adam past the bridge and intend to go to rest I live near charity and a holy convocation again of Eden or glory they call him an amen let's go through it back to China now to find out what this whole equation one really until because that was when I was in heaven when all of God's children gathered together and shouted for joy that solemn serious assembly it was serious because the destructor was there there was there trying to cause some disruption some destruction amen glory to God in Romans 8 open your Bibles Oh Romans 8:9 refers 28 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose we're trying to trace these only converge on to the original holy convocation try to show you what the holy Commission did an establish in the Garden of Eden the eighth day hula competition and Adam lit in an Eden amen and I'm a church son of God they spend this power and authority of heaven on the face of the earth and God come down and create it and unveil of this holy convocation but let's go back and see what's all about where y'all started from so you could know how to apply this in your own life thank you very moment 8 verse 28 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God who are the called according to his purpose we keep the time of my time here I'm doing very well all right for whom he did foreknow he also did predestinate what was what now who may live for know them he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren the firstborn among many brethren the first point among many brethren moreover who made it less innate then he also called and whom he called then he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified in those two verses we found the whole Gospel story amen maybe see the please let's cause a little bit here in those two verses amen we find foreknowledge we find election we find predestination we find destiny brother Branham said foreknowledge looks back to you I mean lecture looks back to for knowledge our predestination looks forward to destiny and this scripture area is very common scripture very populous conforms explains those to you and I a man named and I'm gonna show you in a minute just what it's all about Romans 8:29 for whom indeed for know from for whom it is norm he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many presidents so what comes forth is the foreknowledge is what comes forth elohim running all alone by himself we always talk about the bad part of a long hymns mind the bad part of elohim is mine and if that's the back pad that's a food pad doesn't that make sense can you say Amen can I get a shot in the house because the back pad there is a firm pants now on the back part of a know his mind was his attributes he's been who is that was the premise of our thoughts that think in our spirit on the platter of his mind but in the front pad that's where the foreknowledge is the foreknowledge they note the prior knowledge the knowing before it happens amen and the full knowledge of Elohim if he was God he had to know the beginning from the end he had to know it all before it ever happened at all and many many men election looks back so for knowledge the phone Allah comes first and in the for knowledge Elohim knew everything the funnel-like wasn't on him the back pad was him the phone was just his knowledge of war was gonna be on the face of the earth from Eden Roc but to Ethan again in there in the foreknowledge he knew what was gonna be he knew every life that be on the face of the earth like put something he knew every fly and how many times oh but it's I he knew everything he knew every happened every seat every play that I'll be on the face on the earth like but the ritual has it yesterday he knew brother Paul wasn't gonna be here and as he won't take his place in the full knowledge he knew everything in the front knowledge he knew every sin every field every ungodliness that will ever take miss on the face of the earth in the for knowledge so you know the foreknowledge is not him that's not he's thinking just what he knows [Applause] no you didn't hear me human Ishida you didn't hear me no II did not hear me you maybe see that the foreknowledge when God told Adam have you ever thought God told Adam be fruitful and multiply Adam was an amateur caught on the face of the earth he was ruling this out in the place of God himself yet when Adam sinned unfair God said when he drove the man I said less than man put forth his hand and take also the tree of life and become as one of us knowing good and evil in a lot come on now I thought you said Adam was an amateur god like you on the face of the earth so how come God's saying bless the man come and become like one of us knowing good and evil is that for knowledge but the foreknowledge that's where the pradhans where your problem is that's where your problem is that's where my problem is that's where the prime of the human risk is that's what the four colors into to know good and evil to try to become God when we are not when we haven't gone through the processes to know how to handle good and evil and God can Adam from it because - before it will get back again here to go through the process is take a tutoring a care training before I will become like God again on the face of the earth hallelujah glory to talk for the phone knowledge that's where the problem is at you may be seated and that's where the devil deceives many many young people in particular but also older folks like me like a dads and moms the foreknowledge firstly you the family wasn't God the back pad was caught that's where you were hidden that's where your thought your gene your representation but we just mention in the Elohim was in the back pad of his mind but the foreknowledge but knew everything that will happen a lot of em said he knew who will receive it and who would not receive it the purposes forever Oh Lord that war is set in heaven God looked all the way down and saw you and I 2017 undo will be here by its foreknowledge you knew all the sin they'll be taking place in Port of Spain in London New York Lagos Freetown everywhere all over the festivals of here they'll be king abyss at this present moment don't do all that boy who will be here in an idiot holy convocation God knew who will receive it his foreknowledge knew that [Applause] [Music] [Applause] first Peter one who says elect upon the foreknowledge of God the Father through sanctification of the Spirit unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ grace unto you and peace be multiplied Wow Laurie to God amen so God saw you and I struggling for you so we will receive it amen and what did you do what did you got rich way down into 2015 2016 2017 or whatever it was and put you from the foreknowledge Pat put you right into the election they reach out what's the back part of his mind the phonology is the record of all life I'll be on the face of the earth here is the record of the good and the bad is the knowledge of the good and the evil that will be on the face of the earth but the papacy is the tree of life the back part is only the good God's pure thoughts from before the function of the wall but the phone Allah is the good and the evil and the ugly and the bad and God shall you receive it you rich lay down and pull you from their part of this man I'm pushin em put your name in thirty ten our section on the back part of his mind [Applause] hallelujah so you might come here and you have a front pad like the woman caught in the very act of adultery like the woman of the well she had a front man but she also had a backpack because Elohim I've seen her but she was gonna receive it but when the Messiah was a girl call your husband she will say I have none and he will say either speaking to you I am the Messiah and she was they come see a man he knew she will receive it and he took original and took out from the fauna like breath and put onto the poeple of his mind and the back path cancel out the front pad and no devil who can lay anything to the charge of God's elect does not power in election that's the power in your election Elohim already show you that you are not going to reject it you are gonna receive it and have enough power enough I tore it down I'm take you out of your position take out your drugs I'm pushing on the part of his mind who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect see it's gotta justify IT you'll never be in the first place never dinner frustration Laurie glory [Applause] a memory seeded this story hasn't ended yet we are trying to see how this holy convocation the original one took place as we're trying to see he may be seated him for whom he did foreknow and elected him he foreknew you you were going to receive it he took you no matter what had you apparent no matter what spirit had you brown the power of election rich al [Applause] and cancel out here so now the life all the record in the book of life the record of your record of good and evil he canceled out I'm putting the blood section where you never didn't the frustration when no devil can accuse you he sees you through the blood who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect thus the election hey Chuck you put on the back Oliver called his mind let the devil try to follow you that he can't even do it hey can I do it that's a power in your election what shall we then say hallelujah I am persuaded neither death nor life nor things present can take us away from the love of God already chose us and Electro's in him before the foundation of the world that's why we are here that's why we have no fear you already made it you you are no fear you are not gonna be lost your little baby Shalu poison gas might be wondering right now the Bloodhound it out to them the Bloodhound is up to them but the wretched last night the Holy Spirit follows the blood from the book of redemption the book of redemption of the Battle of his mind hallelujah you may be synergy [Applause] lamb be sure you understand this the phonology got knowledge for knowing before prior knowledge there was a record a record of life got values life so every life on the face of the earth had the record in there of the good and the bad that's why Adam when he called the devil gone that's fair he can handle the good and the bad hello handle it even with the proper election we struggle with handling the good on the band see that brother is bad the sister how forget it I can't even stand her oh that judge oh come on I wanna have you go to church there that's their knowledge of the good and the evil and the Bible says for God be there for perfection see modify as your father in heaven is perfect for him it is Sun to shine on the just and the unjust on the good and the evil glory to God a man a man but elevates not finish you may be seated so when it took you from that record of that life your record of life that's the record the Bible said the books were opened and every man was charged out of the things or I didn't the books the records it's a record of life every life on the face of the earth they're gonna be out of those things that they did because their walks are gonna follow them but you took it from that and put you on the eternal section where there's another book another book the Lamb's Book of Life [Applause] which is written in blood where your name can never be taken out why was there eternally where God's foreknowledge elected you and your record of your life cancels out your record in the regular book of life Oh hallelujah consumed original hallelujah can somebody shot a man Oh hallelujah you may remember I remember some other things that I've done in the front part but Jesus was special law forgive me up every one of them though I was guilty or so long but Jesus of the charges because the population took me and put me I wrote my name in the Lamb's Book of Life in the eternal section never to be original more that's where you are Oh hallelujah and that's where we are gonna have this original holy convocation oh come on now get ready for it get ready for it that's gonna be a shot in heaven

stretched out waiting for your son to come go wants to save you mother you want to get saved don't want to believe her you mother want to get delivered and don't get delayed by going yourself you have to fight your way to go to hell Oh glory to God amen so God on the mojave job Moroni who made it for no I'm elect then he also did predestinate he took care of your parents national take care of your future and predestination is looking forward to your destiny what's your destiny here that they might become it for whom it projected more of a homey deeper destiny damn he also called and whom he called them he also justified on the bad part of his mind and whom he justified them he also glorified what does that mean when he elected you won't put you on his back by the Lamb's Book of Life they called you justified you cleaned you force Peter once is called uh-uh-uh-uh-uh electic on deformity of God the Father through sanctions on the spirit on to obedience and spindle of the blood of Jesus Christ amen grease unto you and peace be multiplied so when he pulls on the back of his mind the blood of Jesus Christ Christ you called you sanctified you on the back part of his mind because on the back pad is all good and no evil no field no sin there so he took you and put you there and clean you up before the wars ever were found oh that's the record of you know him that's the record of you in Elohim Oh glory to God amen many many more are mohammadi phenomenal and he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren we confirmed hello in playing with words in the English language big conform become formed into the image of his son on the spine so enemies record of you you have already been formed into the image of his son plus the record of you when you say my name is written there that's what it means your name is written as tan Elia in the stature of a perfect man hallelujah and the devil is jealous of you this was the eighth day eternal eternity [Applause] [Music] let me just stop here let me leave these notes here I know what happened everybody's all sealed up before the words were ever found on the pavement they were safe already predestinated called sanctified claiming blood no sink and stay on you hallelujah no sink can see on you because you on the back paddle is mine and then confirm the majority son standing there just like his son that he might be the firstborn Jesus Christ the dog was the world among many brethren when that was done what what happened along him on Moffat and become the logos and began the walk of creation already don't decided firstly credit was angels and you were there watching all that good angels you saw this creative power this creative first greater dangers to worship Him and you were there I knew if I was there too he was created you swim to in it amen hallelujah and was there a man on the sides of the North you were there amen right in the logos fail as a seed a word see the little part of life in the logos a man in the beginning because you Papa Theo funny but they are you - you're funny spirit what body I began the walk of creation thank you all creation greater dangers an angel I began to worship him for eons and eons of time they washed them and you were there it's not pre existence though there's a little seed in the logos but they're angels represented you that's where your representation was like brother channel read condemnation by representation same way representation by the destination it was a predestination not pre-existence represented their angels represented you there you are in the logos just saw and angels represent as your spirit II in the beginning God copies didn't finish before we ever come here totally finished and there you are there you are you are there in the logos you are the end the body of Christ you attend the party of the long as you are there in the world an Angels representing your spirit and here's where I want to show you something all right unloose if I was jealous you may be seated even be seated Lucifer was tell us how could he have such a lofty position and still be jealous what was jealous I'm not the granddaughter that was selling revelation 12 I didn't reverse one two three the woman was traveling she had to bid for the manchild he was jealous of the manchild who is this child that's also a man who is this childhood man he was jealous he's like a baby jealousy and feeling bad nonsense it feels like a baby but in this challenge like a man so he had a response and that's we're going to see the different part of the book of life and go see the Elohim kept you there [Applause] he's very Tanner a section in the Lamb's Book of Life and what happened Lucifer fraud he went run run heaven with his tail like butter brahms a tail gee al I wasn't English language tal tal II live with words when we tell to tell tales on God and got some to believe and the Bible said he deceived it's a deception you know what you never did in the first place even Paul said Paul said Paul said Paul said Paul said but if I do therefore that which I wouldn't want to do is there is no longer I that do it it's that but sin that deceived me [Music] since that's working in my members it was responsible but where you have a knowledge and an honest telling of the book from the back of elohim's mind your mind is enlightened and the devil can deceive you normal Adam wasn't deceived sure can get the spot where he can deceive you normal so anyway he went around and did you teach applause ape safari cast in the church against this one against now when the case is won against that one we're getting ready for this holy convocation and the devil is going around there instead of a war in heaven a war in the church up in heaven and if fraught and my killer representing Jesus Christ wouldn't stand for the logos wouldn't stand for it he didn't start the fight we don't study fight but we never run from a fight no we never run from a fight hallelujah a microphone and Lucifer fought and Micah for a Lucifer fraud long story short over seven judge edges this war went on and at the end of the war what happened one-third of the angels were deceived by Lucifer Michael said I won't have this hear you through the matter heaven keep them out of here that's the power in the kingdom kick them out so as you have the power to kick him out of your life so what happened what happened one thought was kicked out of heaven and there I meant two thoughts a revelation there one thought two thoughts means there are three groups here that's what it means means there are three groups here one group was kicked out and one group was from the Batman versus other group here we don't know where they're coming from but the panel said there are four hats to look of life one path is not even written at all because forever O Lord the what is said in heaven all that happen in the beginning when Elohim or muffin - the logos and created angels all throughout that's all that has been happened on the face of the earth it was previewed before the foundation of the world and that's what has been happening and got preview there the fourth group serpent seed God has nothing to do with them their record is not there at all but this is the form on that plane out now in this form ology every life is their exhibition see you are there those working that are there and there is other mysterious group also is there amen so there are three groups there he has seen you and take you out of there and put you on the back of his mind so you're one group other group - its - with Lucifer and they were kicked out that's like the bottom line believers but when believers who almost mean hormones come in and the case of life they got deceived like Judas come to the borders and back off but there's this other group who was not deceived they are not from the back part of elohim's mind but why don't you see it who are they the foolish virgins the foolish virgins they are not they are not elected to being the bride so they're not from the background well in Texas or Lucifer religious Christian people good people good people they didn't get kicked out they didn't take the names out of the book when it costs for people deceived by you know our Robertson these are the different many coastal groups and you know we have many of them in Nigeria remember here so many of them know who have been taught to believe that they can live worldly and still have Jesus who have been taught to believe that they love God in their hearts they sad with God but they are not predestinated to be in the bright the foolish virgins I will take a chance are the great white throne judgment clinton's a life and another group also there is the Matthew 25 group they also did not excites they from this second group mysterious group I wasn't kicked out there was not a bright there they were the foolish virgins religious people another group amen Matthew 25 the Sheep nations who do good things to the bride who are gonna receive eternal life because their goodness to the people of culture and then also the 144 thousand fun part of this group here that's all that's gonna be that's a second group they didn't take sides with Lucifer but one obviously to be in the bright these good people do things that the people in the brand are supposed to do but they will never do people in the message rather as possible never - so what do you have three groups the bride the foolish virgins group on the borderline believers the Valen believers what kicked out so we have the two thoughts the bright the foolish virgins the stood with Michael all glory what if I was kicked out of heaven LM was done then now the book of life could be written and expressed and after the one heaven the book of life was written and expressed and forever Oh Lord the war is settled and written and expressed in heaven or glory they caught him and and they're there you saw the pride of God saw Lucifer kicked out so the capstone couple of different level of their lives saw them growing into the image of the Son of God there was a shout in heaven a shadow victory like never before and that's where the first holy convocation took place that's that where the Eternity holy convocation took place it was read it was celebrating a victory it was celebrating a deliverance who was helping a victory over Satan over Lucifer and all his works Oh glory to God many many men oh brother brother amen Oh Gloria so what happened now what happened now the power that cast will see four out in the same product came down on day one I said let there be light there was darkness representing like Lucifer again let there be light and there was light and the power separated the light from the darkness they can co-exist together in the holy convocation darkness cannot coexist with light in a holy convocation the scene and the porch we cannot live in your life they cannot do it amen the power of God will run through your life and the devil cannot stand it the devil cannot stand in the picture is that even in the picture Oh hallelujah what shall we dance here to these things it can't be for us who can be against us you answer that for yourself Lucy if I could not do it no devil's gonna be able to do it Oh hallelujah so you know what happened in heaven you never did it you never did it it's rather catch you to be on the side you never did it so how can you do it here but when you come on the face of the earth in your day and in your age the ignorance your front party your front parity is what people are looking at that's what you are looking at yourself but Elohim is not looking at that Elohim knows you did not stand with Lucifer Elohim North Lucifer could not deceive you Ellen knows your future is already history aloy knows who have already been formed into the word image of the Son of God Elohim knows Nancy Elohim loss you are loaded with power and Tim Holy Ghost power and no table can stand before you elohim knows that and that's why i call it holy convocation for you to know that an experience that yourself so what do we find friends you may be stands I'm cruising on here or it'll call him Hori hallelujah hallelujah oh my try to show you what happened in eternity which is day number eight
