Sunday I was here but I heard the service I was really inspired by a man president of the world revelation chapter 2 verse 1 under the Angel of the Church of Ephesus write these things saith he that holdeth seven stars in his right hand who walk it in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks I knew dye works and thy labour and thy patience and how thou canst not bear them which are evil I was tried in which say they are apostles and are not and found them liars and has borne and as patience and for my name's sake hast laboured and has not fainted nevertheless I have somewhat against thee because I was left I feel of remember therefore from whence thou art fallen and repent and do the first book so as I will come unto thee quickly and remove like candlestick out of his place except thou repent and this door hast the dark heat is the deed of the Nicolaitans which I agreed he that had ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches the hymn of overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life which in the midst of the paradise of God let's pray father we thank you for your word may you break the bread of life to us and father may you send the Saros around here tonight and drive every soul back to that tree of life may be partake of that tree of life tonight in Jesus and we ask it amen amen before we have a see just turn around and shake somebody hand next to you then you could have your seats oh praise the name of the Lord praise goes to tonight our title here at ear let him hear praise God he that hath an ear let him hear of a subject the each of the overcomer and I would theme the Tree of Life the spirit line they want weather inspirations as a team this tree of life the spirit lines here we go the title he that hath an ear let him hear subject the age of the overcomer and the team is the Tree of Life the spirit line and Butler Branham said you have to constantly stay in the spirit of revival you have to constantly stay in a revival and hilburn Isaac said Sunday you overcome and keeps life in you if like a tree fall dead and water they come to church and there is dead and you're the only end word word word word word the rotten fast in church they die faster in the church because there's no overcoming you have to start to overcome overcoming keeps life in you brings life into your Amen praise God anybody could smoke and drink and fool around but you choose a certain walk this is the way we call the narrow way which is the harder way you choose this and this is what I see as a choice is a young man when I go to meet 17 I choose this route me not to forget girlfriend and this and that all I was focusing on the Lord and pleasing him Amen I've lost this one I lost that one when I was pleasing him because I was called to serve him the new caste of God in the world at the same time there can be in between you have to make up your mind you have to be clear and clean and that a choice of choosing Christ has brought nine like the way this right now it's a right choice you can't go wrong - in Christ or glory let go because you're fighting to live and you live in today Oh glory to God I said you're fighting to live and you live in today you still have to meet this Living God Oh glory I want to put you here or glow every sit and people walk when I'm tall well heels they could almost do like I don't know like what kind of gymnastic is that but they don't see 40 years 50 years from that you have to wear flats or glory to God that's only temporary all these times is temporary beauty is temporary oil praise God all this thing is temporary but here we are get akanda get the receive eternal things jigs up at last or glory to God we believe that hallelujah glory to God Amen praise beatin Jesus he died an ear let him hear what the Spirit says and their teachers did not overcome it will I give to eat of the tree of life which is the midst of the paradise of God and I love the type and a reference that was brought on Sunday now when you get the subjects like a reward for the five years in school or you're doing exams you have a reward going on rewards with overcomers and you know the beauty things beautiful thing about it every easy overcomers there wasn't a single age that God never overcome up every single age of overcomers what about this age what about your age what about your time and me I declare and this is the age of the overcomer overcomer it's you the individual and then one of a bunch of overcomers you the individual called to overcome your the individual Porter here is not the Church of you the individual have to have a ear to hear that's just a commercial nonsense come with your foolishness or glory to God and receive Christ and walk in the light of the world that you could please God that God proud of you that going to boast about you glory to God got to tell your whole family against you you still serve him because Joseph was like that or glory does his own bread and rejected him but he was predestinated he was elected he was called he was chosen and I don't care what you go through tonight I've got elected you that disease of Devils in hell thanks for that election that's why you should be shocked in tonight no trial no testing to cancel your election and God because we saw me he called we call he justified and we justified he has already gone resign [Applause] amen so here's the way you overcome first you have to overcome then you can eat the fruit it's over come up you remember the other night our teaching last night janitor get in the spirit before you saw anything how are you wanna set scene if he's not about this I'm gonna listen to him if he had presbyterian I'd listen to him if we don't teach just exactly what my to teaches you ain't going to overcome he said because you ain't got in the spirit yet you are all out of order getting the spirits the Lord Jesus I love you now reveal to me anything you see fit just bring it to me and then you're getting all right like I hear this pre pastor I have this preacher this one and the embryos in had to leave but if you're in the spirit you just looking for the Lord to speak to you you want a word from the Lord you know Buckley's that don't you gotta lose that man then the pulpit praise God I don't care what that man come with a night because you have a need because you have a daughter of God because you are son of God God's going to anoint that man to speak to your need who are going to anoint that man to speak to your condition it would be by direct inspiration not some intellectual word word no the spirit lane three times in the Bible speaks of the Tree of Life Genesis three times revelation three times and that's the two books at the devil hates Genesis revelation three books because Genesis Stella is beginning revelation tell you his ending he hates those two books then he was seen on my right hand as the tree quality of life and the left is that called the tree of knowledge how many know that the Bible said that is the tree of life and there's a tree of knowledge and Adam lost his fellowship with God when he took the bite of knowledge but the tree of life was to be handled by faith and faith alone God said so I believe it God said so he's a healer God said so he's a deliverer taught yet so he's away makeup I'm not trying to figure out anything I'm trusting the Lord or glory to God and then you have confidence and all Romans 8:28 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God the devil I be called according to his purpose and your trust the Lord and your trust his goodness and yes trust his judgment he will be right on your behalf so when Jesus encountered easy scribes and Pharisees and these religious people this is all far as it manna in the wilderness and he said everyone did oh my manna in the wilderness they eat bread in the villainess you see but the dead they said I am The Living bread this is Genesis talking back in all be the Tree of Life in the form of the bread of life speaking to them now I am The Living bread if a man eat or to me he shall not die oh my the bed of life was from the tree of life where they were eaten from the gardener Eden he was The Tree of Life now if the Tree of Life was a person the tree of knowledge as a person it's just two trees and the fortress is two trees one is a word in the lecture line I wanted the spirit line and the spirit line is the Tree of Life Oh glory to God so Jesus said your father's eat manna in the wilderness and they are dead but I am the bread of life what bread of life from Eden that a man may eat this bread and shall not die what did the angel said they stopped Adam from that tree the god the tree li si papi can live forever if you eat of that tree of life you live forever eternal life so the angel was yet to block the tree stopped an atom from take another tree because you already broke the Covenant already he broke the word from the Lord already but right now in this hour those same angels those same several films they are not God in the tree they are driving you back to the tree everything your father and I said get back up you do something wrong repent they keep pushing your or don't stay there you can live higher than that you're not hired and the animals you a little lower than the Angels oh come on get the come on Oh give the Lord a show go ahead and make your head stop be like an animal border collies higher than the animals who are totally lower than the Angels well give the Lord a shout you are sons of God you are called to a higher level you are called to a higher plane [Music] hallelujah praise the priests go priest oh so SI instead of the angel oh they're trying to keep him from this tree it is driving them along to this tree the angels of the churches to every person bring them back to the name of Jesus Christ who is the Tree of Life so all God trying to get you back is to the world but trying to get you back to the life what time you getting back to the tree what time I get back there get you back to the spirit line because the Bible said knowledge shall increase or glory because it is a way of knowledge and man is being trained to depend upon knowledge and what man knowledge has produced that produced banker automatic this automatic that computers phones everything else that's intelligence a man that's not faith in God a man in God's kingdom you don't even need a cellphone in lights I was hearing what he was talking God hallelujah hallelujah them talking all the secrets analyzing at normal normal normal and he's in himself that was wireless long time we had that long time or give the Lord a shout in the earth [Applause] what automatic automatic Peter was imprisoned in the gate open automatically we had automatic stuff long time hallelujah praise God Martha bill to the iron makers 11 a yacht and big boat or what not and Jesus walked on the water so we could cancel and buffet gravity and do a lot of stuff that man knows nothing about the center killed dead and Jesus said I go wake her she sleep X let's go and wake her get the unbeliever out that's what we're talking about five lost positions blessed multiply it that's what we talkin about can't you see the poor the Living God and he was the example son so you are gonna be a power son you are here to get power you are here to receive power you are here to get a revival you're here to come on a higher expectation [Applause] cherubims or sent the God the Tree of Life the way of life the way to the Tree of Life and Jesus come and said I am the we've all glory to God isn't that right hallelujah praise God and when John was in the spirit there was four guardians from the throne face an ox a face of an eagle a face of a man a face of a land isn't that right there they are again just in Genesis God in the truth and burns it with God in the Shekinah glory that no scallywag could just patek out of it so you can use God like if he's a talisman or he's some kind of good luck charm you use him when you want him you ask him when you need him when you're sick you're free when you're not sick you forget Weir's and you're already signed up and God and I make a because you want them when you have him like if you ever win a drink I need you tonight I don't need this tomorrow I need you I need you you send for him your colleague or so and I can't use God's servants like that either for your selfish whims and fancies you can use God like that you're self-centered you have to get out of that because God so loved the world he gave His only begotten Son he wasn't self-centered he was one of the get glory to restore back Adam's fallen race dream in a sacrifice and shake off the robes of glory and coming on the a man in flesh to redeem you and I to feel like you and I to go through the stress and the pressure that he could know what you're going through that he could be a perfect intercessor or you know God Amen hallelujah hallelujah boy so keen on E&L proceeds to sons to bring up our friends on the god after time rule by what say okay fellas it's time to worship now let me see your revelation of who you see at I am and came bringing fruits Adam and an evil just click a lamb and cut the truth and the blood splashing and God rejoice because evil operated by revelation and God was pleased and got rejected Cain offering and God gave a simple offer the game just do like we're ready to do some people not even humbly enough to do what would a brother do what his sister do to be blessed my god is a reason why that person is bless burnt bread Isaac said a tremendous thing you can't fault somebody who put the exam and put the effort to study and they get all ones and get distinctions you can fix and angry with them and you cleaner wrong and fooling around you have to understand that that person was praying after the extra oil and he's bringing back the type now I'm not idols foolish virgin that's a virgin who was actually putting in the effort to get the extra oil because whenever bridegroom came the other version said go and go and buy and I was going pay the price go and study now go on beat book no go and press no go and get excited now get in the spirit now you had your chance understand the spirit gonna run out you know he talked about the last drop in the bucket you know so if

got jumped buddy what a son Oh glory to God Elijah hallelujah he was not a like Marlin just like you and I but he was a son I'm not only the sons of God these are God's sons they have your failures they haven't missed it that is shortcomings but there were sons of God and God pack them up and wanted to back you up because the whole creation is groaning I'm failing for the manifestation of the sons of God you are going to be delivered that's why I'm preaching like this tonight I am convinced of that [Applause] 7/7 notice all them evil spirits affecting and in fact in your life they'll have to leave they have to go seven notices sickness in your body silver them notice we do have to wait to see anything we silver them notice you got a enforcer come in when I stash out yes yes you may be seated - a shout when I said jump yes when I say run around someone because of the goodness of God not because they got an increase in pay but when you see the goodness of God and the revelation watch strike a soul get my right a shout I was sick but now I'm healed I was playing but no one see I was going out and getting out but I'm revived tonight I were a Bible in my soul listen we talked about it before some fellas was burying a man and some some bandits or whoever was coming to them and it shows they just drop in the dead man and Elijah grieve and the quick temper was still on his bones you can out that but is it Taylor that is why they couldn't boil all the cripton power in John on the Isle of Patmos that's a eternal power that's a higher light that's a white light but never see that eye from afar off that's why support I know Peter I know is a life flashing you hiding hiding hiding you playing chicken on your beat a leader on the furnace stick you know you try to be humble random you trying to eat corn with em I was not big like you you born to fly you born not to be conquered by the chicken yard and the chicken coop I'm a chicken fence when you look up to the heavens and you see height you have seen each media because I go ahead and I want it at the heart no look at the heart in your spirit because sometimes with situations are wrong you have you're so grounded you family situation sickness conditions around the bills the money that's not there all kind of things hitting me from all sides no no we're thinking you're gonna break the Popular Front off easy to me now when you begin to flip the script I'm saying no he's supposed to hit and I supposed to hit back what can i MN is that did you hear what I just said but a Branham had a dream a vision and then he was and then he because when he was small something he just getting bigger and bigger somewhat Abram say boo did I never boom boom you said I got smaller boom boom boom boom boom back down to size you not so big as all that a channel that way the batter said when we see that Lucifer we say is this the man that caused nation is this yes is this the man that caused nations to chamber that [Applause] what promised to put them demons on their feet he's under my feet he's on my mind see these are my feet or glory to God under my feet [Applause] Satan is Almighty [Applause] I went to the enemy camp and I took what he stole from me look what he stole from me look what he stole from me I ran tibi enemy kill we are in the enemy's camp this is Satan's Eden right and Satan's Eden we are clean up our place isn't ready for my tea visitation of the power and the kingdom of God Oh glory to God hallelujah even garden ha altar and brother Branham says there you are back to Eden truly altar that is where they came to worship right at the altar they were to keep that way they and got it and they couldn't get back until this order was covered until the altar was covered with blood restore the order back to your home we saw the order back to your life before Elijah called for fire he first restored the altar Oh glory to God put back up the altar the altar is where all the man of God of a sacrifices unto God the altar is where you put the prayer up to the Living God hey bring that water back don't let his cell phone get between you and the altar don't let the internet and Facebook and whatever get between you and an altar restore back the altar and then Elijah acts forward and the acts of water because you know fire coming from above when those men was so short of God they had no doubts in their mind he said pour water or water pour some more water because if no any call of a fire what was this battle let me God that answer my fire not my more coats by fire let him be God not much more talk or give the Lord a shot it's gonna come down to that that the manifestation will be the interpretation we had 40 years a talk but that coming down to the spot let the garden answer

chose you glory hallelujah praise the Lord thank you Jesus hallelujah okay let's hit the home stretch here now this empirics that has me final that Joseph taken among his brethren several to himself his brothers and then they come such a greeting realized as long as they dwelt in a dwelling place and kept up that's a good thing to stay in the place positionally but they got rid of the spirit they know that birthmarks they're no positionally were there but this spirit the spirit lion got dismissed said they could know and talk and no one talked and talked and no one talked and no and no one talked but when the spirit is out this just no one talked the fundamentals today positionally know where they are by intellectual conception of the Bible but there is no spirit you know why they have rejected juices they tune them out they want nothing to do with it it's a bunch of holy rollers they have ex communities in him they were out of their fellowship the church feels they don't need a Holy Spirit the treasure will tell you that men can step up and give you such an election and they let you talk that can almost make you believe it no let's stop in a minute didn't Jesus say too close so close together the elected it was possible is it the intellectual talks would be so smooth that it would deceive the people it is gospel it is man who can handle that one in such a way that he could make any intellectual person if they are trusting in the intellectuals they would condemn the Holy Spirit and take the way of man Oh glory to God you see when they condemn the Holy Spirit that's a boost about the man that bringing all these intellectual revelations I the matter yeah oh yeah the Holy Ghost is the man in a are you following a man that's right the man Christ Jesus or give the Lord some praises the Holy Ghost is the prophet of the hour that's right a spirit the prophet and the pride says the same thing so I don't need no man no new man to explain to me something ask what's an apprentice any prophet a seven angel messenger in his right hand hallelujah vindicated prophet to bring dust say the Lord and imagine to explain that like if you have more reason than that I will say shut up and play the story water or give the Lord some praise as people or glory does God the prophet said that right no man could make him to otherwise the secret is the word is in the bride no man could persuade him otherwise and no man could take me out of door share the Lord that he likes a prophet prophecy resting on that I am preaching that I am echoing what that tape say by revelation
