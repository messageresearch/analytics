[16:31] amazing what he's done. It's amazing
[16:34] what he has created. It's amazing how he
[16:37] found us. It's amazing how he saved us.
[16:40] He pulled our souls out of darkness.
[16:43] That's a reason to praise God. He put
[16:45] money in your pocket. That's a reason to
[16:48] praise God. You've got clothes on your
[16:50] back, shoes on your feet. The devil
[16:53] didn't do it and he can't take it away.
[16:56] God bless you this morning. He loves you
[16:59] this morning. His arms are open wide
[17:01] this morning. He's embracing you this
[17:03] morning with his presence. Oh, with his

[17:09] and lift him up this morning. Lift up
[17:12] your hands. Lift up your head, oh ye
[17:14] gates, and be lifted up, ye everlasting
[17:18] doors. And that the King of glory shall
[17:22] come in this morning. The Lord strong
[17:24] and mighty. The Lord mighty in battle.
[17:28] We love the Lord our God this morning.
[17:31] Oh, the devil is a liar. I'm here to
[17:34] praise him. I'm here to worship him. Let
[17:37] everything that had breath praise our
[17:39] God this morning. Oh, the devil can't
[17:42] get my praise. Too late, devil. He paid
[17:45] the price on Calvar's tree. Oh, let my
[17:50] soul cry out. How I love you, Lord. How
[17:54] I adore you, Jesus. Oh, somebody praise
[17:57] him this morning. Oh, bring your gifts.

[18:27] in the spirit this morning. Oh, we're
[18:29] here to receive from God. All that he
[18:32] has for us. What a day that he has made.

[18:52] thing. Oh,
[18:55] hallelujah. Amen. So, welcome to God's
[18:58] presence. And if you have your Bibles,
[19:01] we'd like to turn to a portion of
[19:03] scripture in the Psalms as we
[19:06] do to
[19:08] read of God's praises this morning in
[19:12] Psalms chapter 150 and then we
[19:16] will open in a word of prayer.
[19:19] Amen. Psalms chapter
[19:22] 150 says, "Praise ye the Lord. Praise
[19:26] God in his sanctuary.
[19:28] Praise him in the firmament of his
[19:30] power. Praise him for his mighty acts.
[19:34] Praise him according to his excellent
[19:37] greatness. Praise him with the sound of
[19:40] the trumpet. Praise him with the
[19:42] sulttery and harp. Praise him with the
[19:45] timberal and dance. Praise him with
[19:48] stringed instruments and organs. Praise
[19:51] him upon the loud symbols. Praise him
[19:54] upon the high sounding symbols. Let
[19:57] everything that had breath praise the
[20:00] Lord praise ye the Lord. May God add
[20:05] blessing to the reading of his word.
[20:07] We're here to praise him this morning.

[20:11] that's due unto his name. Amen. Let us

[45:56] Olu the pastor of local Christian
[45:59] assembly Lagos?

[46:07] us. When I preached in worry, I said I
[46:11] don't know whether I think it's worry
[46:12] last last year. Yes. I said that
[46:16] I I had respect or I have respect for
[46:20] three people you know and one is my
[46:24] dad and the
[46:26] other is
[46:28] brouh. He said I don't have respect for
[46:30] other people. There are people that we
[46:33] have been looking on to all the years
[46:36] elders you know one my father one
[46:40] brother
[46:41] Olu and that is the much I can call now
[46:45] and I have respect for any every other
[46:47] person. Do you appreciate brother

[50:00] Amen. Amen. God richly bless you. You
[50:04] may be seated. God bless
[50:08] you. God bless you and good
[50:11] afternoon.
[50:13] Um I know seeing me some of you are
[50:16] scared like brother Olu. He preaches a
[50:19] long time. So
[50:21] um don't be nervous. I'm I'm
[50:25] growing. I'm changing. So just pray for
[50:28] me. So uh but it's so good to be in
[50:30] Indonesia again and want to say thank
[50:32] you to Pastor UJ and his lovely lovely
[50:36] wife
[50:38] um sister Debbie for the invitation to
[50:41] be here again. Um I just simply say what
[50:45] I've always said since what I believe
[50:48] you know brother Enoch will look down
[50:50] and be very glad very glad. I mean
[50:53] that's that's all I can say and really
[50:56] what I feel about brother Enoch and
[50:58] sister Becky I've always felt that way
[51:00] like raising eight kids and they are all
[51:04] in the message it's no it's no small
[51:07] feat and not just in the message but
[51:10] really from when they were all young
[51:12] because I knew them all since they were
[51:15] very very small and they never deviated.
[51:18] So that is something that we all can
[51:20] emulate and because the purpose I
[51:23] believe God put us here primarily is to
[51:27] raise up our children to have this word
[51:29] firstly and then to pass on to our
[51:31] children. If we fail in that nothing
[51:34] else matters. So thank you brother Enoch
[51:37] and Sebi even though they're not here we
[51:39] thank you for their work. So brother
[51:41] thank you for the great work you're
[51:42] doing. Really love and appreciate you.
[51:46] And um Baloce is like a son to me. But
[51:49] truth of the matter is he's pastor of
[51:51] the church. And there's no, you know,
[51:54] big pastor, small pastor. Pastor is
[51:57] pastor. Like brother would say those
[51:59] years pastor. Put it all down flat.
[52:02] We're all God's children. There's no big
[52:04] eye and little you. So we thank God for
[52:07] the pastor. And while I'm here, he's my
[52:10] pastor while I'm in this convention.
[52:12] Thank you, Pastor OJ. God bless you.
[52:21] I I I I'll try to be a good boy. Okay.
[52:25] So, um because I have this tendency to
[52:28] say things that upsets my generation.
[52:31] All right. Can I can I remove my jacket?
[52:33] All right. All right.
[52:39] [Music]
[52:44] Um because you know my generation has a
[52:47] tendency to think we are growing and
[52:51] everybody else is the same. So we talk
[52:54] to our kids the way we talked to them 20
[52:57] years ago, 30 years ago. And they must
[52:59] not react. If they react, we say they're
[53:02] rude. But we are never rude. Yet we talk
[53:05] to them anyhow. So that's why I say
[53:08] pastor UJ is not the small boy. He's
[53:11] pastor of the church in Indonesia and
[53:14] the church happens to be one of the
[53:15] largest churches in the message in the
[53:17] country and we respect him as such. Of
[53:20] course like of of course of course he it
[53:23] he it he has to make full proof of his
[53:25] ministry which I believe he's doing and
[53:27] we all see it but he is pastor just like
[53:30] I am pastor just like anyone who is
[53:32] older than me is pastor and we respect
[53:34] him as such. Amen.
[53:41] I also want to say thank you to the uh
[53:44] the ministry, the helps and the
[53:45] governments of the church here at the
[53:47] little floor Christian Assembly and for
[53:50] standing with pastor to keep the
[53:52] maharship straight because I know
[53:55] there's there things like people could
[53:57] say no this not how we did it before
[53:59] this not how you know pastor you not did
[54:02] it before well pastor is the pastor and
[54:04] all you need to do or the pastor just to
[54:07] do like the Bereans to to see in the
[54:10] word not to check out that it's not true
[54:13] but to see that the pastor is on the
[54:15] line and you follow because like brother
[54:17] Bham told us God don't use two men in
[54:20] any one place ever. You use two men you
[54:23] got two different ideas. So you can't
[54:25] have the pastor's idea and the
[54:26] minister's idea and the deacons the
[54:28] pastor's idea in contact with the Holy
[54:31] Ghost to know what to do. So I thank
[54:33] you. I I thank you. I appreciate the
[54:35] ministry, the helps and governments in
[54:37] the church here standing by brother u to
[54:40] help to keep the misarchy straight.
[54:44] Amen. Amen. And all the pastors, the
[54:47] ministers and the churches who have come
[54:50] for the convention. Uh we thank you for
[54:52] attending. Uh it's not a Sunday though
[54:54] it feels like a Sunday. Every day of
[54:56] this convention has felt like a Sunday.
[54:58] and uh but to leave all that you needed
[55:00] to do Christmas time, Christmas season
[55:02] and be here. Um God richly bless you and
[55:06] especially to my ministering brothers,
[55:08] the featured speakers who have gone
[55:10] ahead. Um I'm too much of a dollar to
[55:14] remember all the names. So I don't want
[55:16] to leave anybody's name out, but I
[55:18] really appreciate you. I came in on I I
[55:22] keep my first service was yesterday
[55:24] morning, but I follow the other
[55:26] services. Brother Uch, uh, Brother Waju
[55:29] and Brother Andaki and and who else was
[55:32] that on on Friday night and then
[55:34] yesterday morning and yesterday night,
[55:36] Pastor Isaac Jbe are wonderful. The
[55:39] prayer line, incredible. So, I thank
[55:41] you, my precious brothers. And like I
[55:43] always say, and I really mean it. I feel
[55:45] really um I know everybody says it, but
[55:49] really I mean it. I feel really um uh
[55:52] blessed to be with you on the field to
[55:55] you know put my shoulders to the wheel
[55:57] to to sweep this gospel on to the coming
[56:00] of the Lord. So God bless you for your
[56:03] ministries that has been a blessing in
[56:05] this convention and a number of you have
[56:07] been on the road a long time. I thank
[56:10] you and for those who are coming behind
[56:12] in the final service tonight. I thank
[56:15] you also and say God richly richly bless
[56:18] you.
[56:20] Amen. Pastor UJ has a theme for the
[56:23] convention which is a a theme or
[56:26] inspiration or subject I mean but he
[56:29] said it's from the apostles doctrine to
[56:31] the manifestation and that's what I'd
[56:34] like to take from my title this morning
[56:36] or this afternoon. So if you if you
[56:39] don't mind can you stand to your feet so
[56:41] we can read the word of God.
[56:49] [Music]
[56:52] Uh because the time is fast spent. So
[56:54] I'll try to run so I don't um use up all
[56:57] of my goodwill and you'll get tired on
[56:59] me. So I'll try to run. Um I know I tend
[57:03] to speak very fast many times. I speak
[57:06] so fast many times. Like I said I don't
[57:08] even hear myself but I I'll try to stay
[57:11] conscious so I don't you know just speak
[57:14] to myself alone. But if I'm speaking and
[57:16] you're not hearing me, what good does he
[57:18] do? So I have a few scriptures. Um um
[57:22] Acts
[57:24] 2:38 to um 47, Hebrews 1 1-3, and
[57:30] Revelation 10 and verse 7. And if you
[57:34] have your marker, you can just get uh my
[57:36] Condex scriptures. I may not get to
[57:38] them, but I'll try to. um seen Luke
[57:42] 15 11-32 speaking about the prodigal son
[57:46] going out and then coming back home and
[57:48] the atmosphere and all that and then
[57:50] Ephesians 4
[57:52] 11-15 and Genesis 1:26-28 and Genesis
[57:58] 2:7 for my scriptures Acts 2 and verse
[58:05] 37 this is after Peter had preached on
[58:08] the day of Pentecost so that's what this
[58:10] is here. This is the day of
[58:12] Pentecost. Now when they heard this,
[58:14] they were pricricked in their heart and
[58:17] said unto Peter and to the rest of the
[58:19] apostles, men and brethren, what shall
[58:21] we do? Then Peter said unto them, Repent
[58:25] and be baptized every one of you in the
[58:28] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[58:30] of sins, and ye shall receive the gift
[58:33] of the Holy Ghost. For the promise is
[58:36] unto you and to your children, and to
[58:39] all that are far off, even as many as
[58:42] the Lord our God shall
[58:44] call. And with many other words did he
[58:47] testify and exalt, saying, "Save
[58:50] yourselves from this untored
[58:52] generation." Now, these verses represent
[58:55] at their most basic level the apostles
[58:58] doctrine. Exactly. What the apostles
[59:01] preach as their doctrine. That's right.
[59:04] Verse
[59:05] 41. Then they that gladly received his
[59:10] word were baptized, and the same day
[59:13] there were added unto the unto them
[59:16] about 3,000 souls. And they
[59:20] continued the apostles doctrine. This
[59:23] was the effect on the people.
[59:25] They continued steadfastly. When you
[59:28] hear somebody steadfast, it means they
[59:30] have commitment. They have discipline to
[59:33] be committed because we talk commitment
[59:36] but you need discipline to maintain that
[59:39] commitment. When you have both John
[59:42] together then you have steadfastness and
[59:44] that was the atmosphere in that church
[59:47] where the apostles doctrine was in um
[59:51] was was being taught and
[59:54] preached. And they continued steadfastly
[59:57] in the apostles doctrine and fellowship
[1:00:00] and in breaking of bread and in prayers.
[1:00:03] And fear came upon every soul. And many
[1:00:08] wonders and signs were done by the
[1:00:10] apostles. The effects of the apostles
[1:00:13] doctrine. Signs, wonders, miracles, the
[1:00:17] power of God in the midst.
[1:00:20] Verse
[1:00:21] 44. And all that believe were together.
[1:00:25] the results of preaching the apostles
[1:00:27] doctrine.
[1:00:30] All that believe were together and had
[1:00:33] all things common.
[1:00:35] Now having all things common doesn't
[1:00:37] mean I say give me your jacket I'm going
[1:00:38] to wear today. That's not what it means.
[1:00:42] You take the context from the
[1:00:44] scriptures. What it simply means is that
[1:00:46] there was a lot of unconditional love
[1:00:50] among that group. That's what it means.
[1:00:52] That's what it represented. I know that
[1:00:54] if I ever get in some dire need I can't
[1:00:58] come I can't sort out I have my family
[1:01:01] church family around me I can trust them
[1:01:04] what they have is mine what I have is
[1:01:06] theirs
[1:01:08] I need somebody to pray for me I can
[1:01:10] trust I can call them at 2:00 in the
[1:01:12] morning
[1:01:14] there's a problem here they will give me
[1:01:16] their time their time is my time is
[1:01:18] their time they had all things common
[1:01:21] Amenisemen
[1:01:26] I'm sorry. Forgive me. This thing is not
[1:01:29] transferring to my
[1:01:31] um app iPad. So, um I'm from the old
[1:01:35] school. So, I I I'm trying to be like
[1:01:38] the younger ones and try to, you know,
[1:01:40] but uh it takes a lot of growing up to
[1:01:44] do. So, so forgive me.
[1:01:47] Um anyway,
[1:01:49] so verse
[1:01:51] 45, let me do 44 again. And all that
[1:01:53] believe were together and had all things
[1:01:56] common. And sold their possessions and
[1:01:58] goods and parted them to all men as
[1:02:01] every man had need. Ne had need.
[1:02:05] That's the operative word. So it's not
[1:02:07] like that you have 10 lands, go and sell
[1:02:10] one and give me or give me one and give
[1:02:11] me two if you want to be, you know, in
[1:02:14] the act of the apostles. That's not what
[1:02:15] it means.
[1:02:16] as they had need.
[1:02:19] Your want and your need are two
[1:02:20] different things. Many things you want
[1:02:23] that you don't need.
[1:02:25] Amen.
[1:02:29] Verse 46, the apostles doctrine and the
[1:02:32] results and the effects of it. And they
[1:02:36] continuing daily steadfastly
[1:02:41] commitments discipline to maintain the
[1:02:44] commitment.
[1:02:46] And they continue daily with one accord
[1:02:48] in the temple. That's that mind. That's
[1:02:51] that mindset. That's that frame of mind.
[1:02:54] They all had the mind of Christ. One
[1:02:57] Lord, one faith, one baptism, one mind,
[1:03:00] one accord, one place. They were united
[1:03:03] together. Amen.
[1:03:08] And they continued daily with one accord
[1:03:10] in the temple and breaking bread from
[1:03:13] house to house did eat their meat with
[1:03:16] gladness and singleness of
[1:03:18] heart. And the Lord added to the church
[1:03:21] daily such as should be saved the
[1:03:24] results of the apostles doctrine.
[1:03:28] Hebrews 1:es 1-3.
[1:03:32] God who at sun dry times and in diverse
[1:03:34] manner spake in time past unto the
[1:03:37] fathers by the prophets hath in these
[1:03:39] last days spoken unto us by his son whom
[1:03:42] he had appointed heir of all things by
[1:03:45] whom also he made the walls who been the
[1:03:48] brightness of his glory Jesus
[1:03:51] Christ the brightness of God's glory and
[1:03:55] the express image of his person once you
[1:03:57] see Jesus that's got fully expressed
[1:04:02] and upholding all things by the word of
[1:04:06] his power when he had by himself purged
[1:04:09] our sins and sat down on the right hand
[1:04:12] of the majesty on high. Amen. And
[1:04:16] finally, Revelation 10:7. But in the
[1:04:19] days of the voice of a seventh angel,
[1:04:22] when the when he shall begin a sound,
[1:04:25] the mystery of God should be finished as
[1:04:28] he had declared to his servants the
[1:04:30] prophets. The mystery of God, God being
[1:04:32] a mystery. We don't know who he is, but
[1:04:36] Jesus Christ was the express image of
[1:04:39] God. So, you don't have to wonder no
[1:04:42] more about what God looks like. You want
[1:04:44] to know what God looks like? Take a look
[1:04:46] at Jesus. He was the expressed image. He
[1:04:49] He expressed God. He expressed the image
[1:04:53] of God. He displayed it, manifested it
[1:04:56] so you can see him. So God is no longer
[1:04:58] a mystery because Jesus expressed him.
[1:05:02] Amen.
[1:05:04] And we thank God. The mystery of God
[1:05:06] should be finished. is sent in a prophet
[1:05:09] who brought us that message. The
[1:05:12] expressed image of God. Christ is the
[1:05:16] mystery of God revealed or expressed or
[1:05:21] manifested or made plain or made real so
[1:05:24] that we could see him. We could touch
[1:05:26] him. We could know this is very God
[1:05:28] himself. Amen.
[1:05:31] Amen. May the Lord add his blessing to
[1:05:33] reading of his holy words. Let's bow our
[1:05:35] heads of prayer. Our heavenly
[1:05:38] father, we thank you for this day Lord.
[1:05:40] We thank you for the blessing of being
[1:05:43] in the convention. Thank you Lord for
[1:05:46] your servant here, our pastor uh
[1:05:49] brother. We thank you for what we see
[1:05:51] you doing through him and with him.
[1:05:54] Lord, we thank you and we pray Lord your
[1:05:56] blessing, your anointing, your grace
[1:05:59] will abundantly continue to be upon him,
[1:06:02] his dear wife, his family and this
[1:06:04] church here Lord that your servant
[1:06:06] brother Enoch labored to put together
[1:06:08] for you all of those years. And we thank
[1:06:10] God we see the Holy Spirit keeping that
[1:06:13] mehip straight and moving on with the
[1:06:16] Holy Ghost. Father, we thank you for
[1:06:18] these meetings here, Lord. We thank you
[1:06:19] for the word that has been spoken. We
[1:06:21] thank you for your servants that you
[1:06:23] have so graciously used. None of us is
[1:06:25] worthy. There's not a single one of us
[1:06:27] that's worthy. But we can stand before
[1:06:29] you because of the worthy one, Jesus
[1:06:32] Christ. You don't deal with us on the
[1:06:34] basis of our merits. We have none to
[1:06:36] offer. But we come to you in the name of
[1:06:38] Jesus Christ. And when we come to you in
[1:06:40] the name of Jesus is as Jesus himself
[1:06:42] coming before the throne of the father
[1:06:44] and we come in his name. We come hidden
[1:06:46] in him. And we know because of him you
[1:06:48] will bless us. one more time today as
[1:06:50] you have done in the past two days.
[1:06:53] Bless your people. I know the eyes lay
[1:06:54] there tired and I pray you'll help me to
[1:06:56] not hold them too long, but I pray
[1:06:58] you'll take over my mind and may the
[1:07:00] mind of Christ help me to be able to
[1:07:02] speak the things you want me to speak
[1:07:04] and shut my mind and my mouth from
[1:07:06] saying what you want me to speak. that
[1:07:08] at the end of this service and at the
[1:07:10] end of the meetings tonight Lord we all
[1:07:12] go out of this convention like those two
[1:07:15] on the road will email us crying out did
[1:07:17] not our hearts burn within us while you
[1:07:20] speak to us that long lives way we are
[1:07:22] all such a needy people Lord and we need
[1:07:24] you to speak to us each one of us this
[1:07:26] day one more time a long life's way and
[1:07:29] we will be careful at the end of this
[1:07:31] service and as long as you let us breath
[1:07:34] every single day of our lives we'll be
[1:07:36] careful to give you alone all the
[1:07:38] praise, all the honor and all the glory
[1:07:40] for we ask you with thanksgiving in
[1:07:42] Jesus name. Amen. God bless you and be
[1:07:53] seated. Okay, my title one more time is
[1:07:56] the from the apostles doctrine to the
[1:07:59] manifestation.
[1:08:01] really beautiful that really beautiful
[1:08:02] inspiration really
[1:08:04] beautiful and my subject inspiration I
[1:08:07] may not get to it is the purpose of
[1:08:10] church the purpose of church why we're
[1:08:13] in church at all what's the
[1:08:15] purpose because what what those people
[1:08:19] who check those things out I don't but
[1:08:22] what people who check those things out
[1:08:24] the the sociologist and all that the
[1:08:27] fact that many people in in in in the
[1:08:29] world live without a purpose They just
[1:08:31] do the things because everybody does it.
[1:08:33] Why do you go to school? Everybody goes
[1:08:35] to school. I got to go to school so I
[1:08:37] get a good job. Why do you do this? Why
[1:08:39] do you? Why do you even marry and all
[1:08:40] that? People don't know the purpose why
[1:08:42] to do that. And many of us come to
[1:08:44] church without even knowing the purpose
[1:08:44] why they come to church. For the young
[1:08:46] ones, my dad, mom, maybe want to come
[1:08:48] and they come to church and they don't
[1:08:50] even know why they're there. Even many
[1:08:51] of us adults don't know the purpose why
[1:08:53] we are in church. Amen.
[1:09:03] All right. Um, so let me just give a
[1:09:07] brief summary of the message I want to
[1:09:09] speak. Um, because I'm a bit nervous. I
[1:09:12] mean, I don't want to hold you up too
[1:09:15] long. So, just in case I didn't get to
[1:09:17] it all, I I just want to give you a bit
[1:09:20] and then I'll go back and reverse
[1:09:21] engineer and go to the go start again
[1:09:24] from the phone. And so if I had cut it
[1:09:26] off then you know what I was trying to
[1:09:28] say. Now the summary of the message in
[1:09:32] very simple words that Jesus came to
[1:09:34] show us what the father is like.
[1:09:39] And brother Pam told us that Christ is
[1:09:40] the mystery of God revealed. He said you
[1:09:43] want to understand God read the Bible.
[1:09:45] But if you don't understand what you are
[1:09:47] reading the Bible take a look at Jesus.
[1:09:49] And he said, "If you really take a look
[1:09:51] at it well, you'll see Jesus in every
[1:09:53] line of the Bible." And in Jesus Christ,
[1:09:56] you see God's message through the whole
[1:09:59] Bible.
[1:10:01] Jesus had one primary objective and
[1:10:04] which was really to show us what God is
[1:10:08] really like. He said, "I am my father
[1:10:11] and one." Amen.
[1:10:14] So if you want to see how God deals with
[1:10:16] the sinner, take a look at Jesus. You
[1:10:19] want to see how God deals with the sick
[1:10:21] man, take a look at Jesus. You want to
[1:10:23] take a look at how he deals with the
[1:10:25] prostitute, take a look at Jesus. You
[1:10:27] want to take a look at how he deals with
[1:10:28] the little children, take a look at
[1:10:30] Jesus. If you want to see how he behaves
[1:10:32] in church, take a look at Jesus. He was
[1:10:35] the express image of God. Amen.
[1:10:41] Every interaction that you and I see
[1:10:43] Jesus having with somebody is really was
[1:10:47] really an interaction between that
[1:10:49] person and God.
[1:10:52] Amen.
[1:10:58] Jesus in every interaction stayed
[1:11:01] conscious, stayed stayed committed,
[1:11:03] stayed disciplined to his calling and
[1:11:06] his
[1:11:07] purpose to ensure that every interaction
[1:11:11] that he had displayed the great father
[1:11:15] heart of God, God's great heart of love
[1:11:18] that the father
[1:11:20] had, how God is and how he treats all of
[1:11:23] his children everywhere. Whether they in
[1:11:26] sin, whether they are saved, whether
[1:11:28] they are messed up, however they
[1:11:35] shape, I can make bold to say that many
[1:11:38] people that Jesus met and interacted
[1:11:40] with, if you and I, even today with all
[1:11:43] the years of the gospel, the message, we
[1:11:46] will handle them differently.
[1:11:50] Imagine the woman caught in the very act
[1:11:52] of adultery.
[1:11:53] This was God, very God who made the
[1:11:56] laws, the rules. They said they have
[1:11:59] caught her in the very act of adultery.
[1:12:01] What is it should be said to her? Why?
[1:12:04] Why are they asking
[1:12:05] him? The watch said stone her.
[1:12:10] Why are they asking him?
[1:12:17] But Jesus to show you and I the letter
[1:12:19] kills. That was the word. But to show
[1:12:22] you that many times you interpret the
[1:12:24] word, we you and I interpret the word in
[1:12:26] a wrong way because the letter kills.
[1:12:30] But the spirit and the intent of the law
[1:12:33] that was given
[1:12:36] is what Jesus was saying. What was the
[1:12:38] spirit and the intent? This woman's done
[1:12:40] this wrong. Let's give her a chance
[1:12:43] again. Is the God of a second chance. He
[1:12:46] said, "If you are without sin, stone
[1:12:48] her.
[1:12:52] And some of them were whispering this
[1:12:54] man here, he claims righteousness. Look
[1:12:57] at him how he's dealing with sin and all
[1:12:59] that. So is that the woman politing the
[1:13:00] place breaking the law of Moes and all
[1:13:02] that? So this man is going to be false.
[1:13:04] This man said maybe he has a secret sin
[1:13:05] himself. That's why he can't really
[1:13:07] boldly talk to her.
[1:13:11] And when they finish, Jesus just told
[1:13:12] her,
[1:13:14] "Daughter, where are
[1:13:17] you?" Now watch that.
[1:13:19] Watch. He did not say, "Where are those
[1:13:22] that were saying what the Lord?" Moses
[1:13:23] said,
[1:13:26] he called them accusers.
[1:13:32] Accusers, "Where are your accusers?"
[1:13:37] Glory to God.
[1:13:41] And she said, "No man here, Lord." And
[1:13:44] now Jesus now spoke the intent, the
[1:13:46] spirit and the intent of that word, of
[1:13:50] that law, a second chance. Daughter,
[1:13:54] neither do I, God condemn
[1:14:01] thee. Go and
[1:14:04] sin no more.
[1:14:07] Make use of your second chance. Is a God
[1:14:10] of a second chance.
[1:14:12] Morning by morning, new mercies we
[1:14:14] receive. That's God. That's the great
[1:14:17] father heart of God. That's who God is.
[1:14:21] Amen. Amen. Can you say amen?
[1:14:25] [Applause]
[1:14:34] But here is where we coming. Because
[1:14:37] just as Jesus put a face on God to the
[1:14:40] world, you and I are to put a face on
[1:14:43] Jesus. That's right. So if people want
[1:14:45] to see Jesus, they should see us. Oh,
[1:14:47] hallelujah.
[1:14:50] And we should properly reflect
[1:14:55] how he handles every situation. The
[1:14:57] sinner, the backsliden, our naughty
[1:15:00] children, you know, they run you crazy,
[1:15:03] whatever. that brother, that sister in
[1:15:05] church is so whatever against the
[1:15:08] pastor, against this that
[1:15:10] whatever, how do you handle him? H how
[1:15:13] will Jesus handle
[1:15:15] him? So just like Jesus put a face on
[1:15:18] God to the world, you and I are to put a
[1:15:21] face on Jesus to the world. That's what
[1:15:24] it means. Christ in the bride.
[1:15:27] This all about God's great three-fold
[1:15:29] mystery. God in Christ.
[1:15:34] reflecting Christ. God in him reflecting
[1:15:37] God to the world. Showing God what God
[1:15:40] is like. Christ in the bride. Christ the
[1:15:44] bride reflecting Christ. Showing
[1:15:47] Christ
[1:15:48] what showing the world what Christ is
[1:15:51] like. And brother Bham that's his
[1:15:53] message. He said many of us try to do
[1:15:56] the works of Christ before the
[1:15:58] reflection of Christ is in us. So we are
[1:16:01] here to reflect him. His behavior, his
[1:16:06] works, his ways, his behavior, how he
[1:16:08] lives, how he moves, how he talks, how
[1:16:11] he behaves himself. That's what the
[1:16:13] three four mystery is all about. And
[1:16:16] that's what our churches should be.
[1:16:18] Reflecting Christ to the world. Amen.
[1:16:22] That's what our churches should be.
[1:16:24] That's what our homes should be. That's
[1:16:26] what we as individuals should be.
[1:16:28] showing the world what our father God is
[1:16:31] like. Showing the world how God behaves
[1:16:34] in every situation with sinner or
[1:16:42] saint there this churches and forgive me
[1:16:45] I don't I mean I I tried I
[1:16:48] mean I try I mean many things maybe I
[1:16:51] did in the past I mean in my early days
[1:16:53] of ministry I won't do them now.
[1:16:56] I will maybe I shouldn't say that I will
[1:16:59] if I knew then what I know now I would
[1:17:03] handle so many things
[1:17:06] differently same principle same content
[1:17:09] but just the way you go about
[1:17:12] [Applause]
[1:17:15] it so I'm not talking against you know
[1:17:18] denominational Pentecostals and all that
[1:17:20] but never did he said God has joined
[1:17:22] those places I know in the message we
[1:17:24] have you know or literally almost change
[1:17:26] those things.
[1:17:27] But I know some churches, you know, they
[1:17:30] they they call fire down upon their
[1:17:33] enemies and everybody's an enemy and all
[1:17:35] that stuff. Well, God bless
[1:17:38] them.
[1:17:40] But that's not where we're about. How
[1:17:43] God deals the the church is supposed to
[1:17:47] reflect Christ, how he would handle
[1:17:48] every situation, sinner or saint. Amen.
[1:17:58] And the home that the party son grew up
[1:18:01] in is a very very good reflection of
[1:18:05] what most of our churches are like.
[1:18:09] Message or denominational Christian. We
[1:18:12] in the message have a way of talking in
[1:18:15] a very opety manner about everybody
[1:18:19] else. But we fall far short of it. But
[1:18:21] bomb said on that walk, that walk of a
[1:18:25] Christian life, that's where we fail.
[1:18:28] That's where the church is failing. Not
[1:18:31] me saying it, the prophet saying it.
[1:18:36] Amen.
[1:18:38] And I just want to apologize up to my
[1:18:40] brothers, my minister brothers. I love
[1:18:42] respect you and I'm not talking down on
[1:18:44] you. If I sound like that, I apologize
[1:18:46] upfront. I don't mean anything like
[1:18:48] that. But I just feel in my heart that
[1:18:52] we need to our young folks need to see
[1:18:56] the gospel of the message of Malachi 4
[1:19:00] and we haven't done a very good job
[1:19:02] about it. If you have if you have
[1:19:05] forgive me but I know me as well as a
[1:19:10] lot of other people will readily admit
[1:19:12] we haven't done a great job about it.
[1:19:14] People say when you talk like that
[1:19:15] you're making the young people feel like
[1:19:16] that whatever. Well, well, that will not
[1:19:19] make me change what the word of God
[1:19:21] says.
[1:19:22] Hallelujah.
[1:19:24] That's what we think. Many times we feel
[1:19:26] that when we preach the word of God and
[1:19:29] the love of God is the atmosphere we
[1:19:31] live in, we feel it's weak. No, the
[1:19:35] strongest force in all the world. Amen.
[1:19:38] That's the home that God loves. That's
[1:19:40] the home that God grew up in. That's
[1:19:42] what he wants my home to be, wants your
[1:19:45] home to be. That's the atmosphere he
[1:19:47] wants us to live in
[1:19:51] in our churches, in our homes, in our
[1:19:53] own lives, enjoying every day a
[1:19:56] relationship with a father who loves us
[1:20:00] unconditionally.
[1:20:03] Can you say amen?
[1:20:05] Amen.
[1:20:08] Please be seated.
[1:20:18] So that's my summary. That's my summary.
[1:20:20] So let's get the message
[1:20:25] now from the apostles doctrine to the
[1:20:28] manifestation. Brother UJ or he's not
[1:20:30] here. You are inspired to choose this. I
[1:20:34] mean I mean every minister is inspired
[1:20:36] but I'm just saying for this I don't
[1:20:38] mean he's the only one who is inspired.
[1:20:40] So um don't misunderstand me or or don't
[1:20:44] hear what I'm not saying. Okay. All
[1:20:46] right. So
[1:20:50] because this is his meeting this is
[1:20:52] meeting so inspiration we come here to
[1:20:55] support it and I feel this was very
[1:20:58] inspired and I'll explain to you and
[1:20:59] you'll understand what I'm saying as we
[1:21:01] go along.
[1:21:03] So from the apostles doctrine to the
[1:21:07] manifestation represents many things in
[1:21:10] my context from what I see in the
[1:21:11] scriptures and what brother Benam told
[1:21:13] us from here to there represents a
[1:21:16] journey represents it will take time a
[1:21:20] journey takes time it represents a
[1:21:23] process represents growth you're coming
[1:21:27] from here to there represents
[1:21:29] growth in fact this Um uh uh inspiration
[1:21:34] here from the apostles talking to the to
[1:21:37] the inspir to to the manifestation
[1:21:39] represents the process of life.
[1:21:42] The process of life from your dream to
[1:21:45] the manifestation of it from what you
[1:21:47] want to when you get it represents the
[1:21:50] pres of life itself. Amen.
[1:21:54] This thing keeps switching on me.
[1:22:03] So let's go over some scriptures and
[1:22:06] let's follow the journey of the apostles
[1:22:08] doctrine through the
[1:22:10] Bible. It's not only from where I read
[1:22:12] it in Acts 2 is all through the Bible.
[1:22:15] And then we'll see the impact the effect
[1:22:19] of preaching and being steadfast with
[1:22:23] the apostles doctrine.
[1:22:25] Amen. St. Matthew and I'm I'll try to
[1:22:28] run I'm going to read quite a few
[1:22:29] scriptures but follow me. I'm trying to
[1:22:31] show you the journey of the apostles
[1:22:34] doctrine right down to this day. St.
[1:22:37] Matthew verse 7 verse 28 and 29. And it
[1:22:41] came to pass when Jesus had ended these
[1:22:43] sayings the people were astonished at
[1:22:46] his
[1:22:48] doctrine. For he
[1:22:50] taught taught them as one having
[1:22:53] authority and not as the
[1:22:55] scribes. St. Mark 4 and:e 2 and he
[1:22:58] taught them many things by parables and
[1:23:01] said unto them in his
[1:23:03] doctrine said Mark 11 and verse 18 and
[1:23:07] the scribes and chief priests heard it
[1:23:09] and sought how they might destroy him
[1:23:13] for they feared him because all the
[1:23:15] people were asked at his doctrine. The
[1:23:19] apostles had a doctrine, but Jesus also
[1:23:21] had a doctrine.
[1:23:25] And I I'm trying to show you the
[1:23:28] doctrine of Jesus is what became the
[1:23:30] apostles doctrine.
[1:23:36] St. John 7 14 to 18. Now about the midst
[1:23:41] of the feast, Jesus went up into the
[1:23:43] temple and
[1:23:45] taught. And the Jews marveled, saying,
[1:23:48] "How not this man letters? Having never
[1:23:51] learned, he never went to any of our
[1:23:53] schools." Jesus answered unto and said
[1:23:56] unto them, "My doctrine
[1:24:00] is not mine, but his
[1:24:04] that sent me." Now wait a minute. Jesus
[1:24:07] is saying what I even I'm saying here,
[1:24:10] my doctrine is not really my doctrine.
[1:24:13] In other words, the apostles doctrine
[1:24:16] was the doctrine Jesus taught. But Jesus
[1:24:19] is saying even that doctrine that I call
[1:24:21] my doctrine is not really mine. But his
[1:24:24] that sent
[1:24:27] me is a doctrine
[1:24:30] of my father that sent me. But he that
[1:24:34] sent me. Verse 17. If any man will do
[1:24:36] his will, he shall know of the doctrine
[1:24:40] whether it be of God. There it is.
[1:24:43] Whether it be God's doctrine, or whether
[1:24:46] I speak of
[1:24:49] myself, he that speaketh of himself
[1:24:51] seeketh his own glory. But he that
[1:24:54] seeketh his glory that sent him, the
[1:24:57] same is true, and no unrighteousness is
[1:24:59] in him. So we can see right away from
[1:25:02] these three scriptures that Jesus's
[1:25:04] doctrine, his doctrine was actually the
[1:25:07] father's doctrine. It was the doctrine
[1:25:09] of God. Amen.
[1:25:13] And what's the doctrine of God? We'll
[1:25:16] get we'll get to that in a bit. Let's
[1:25:19] continue on with the journey of the
[1:25:20] apostles doctrine. We have been able to
[1:25:22] trace it back to track back to Jesus's
[1:25:24] doctrine. Hallelujah.
[1:25:26] St. John um 18 19 to 23. The high priest
[1:25:32] then asked Jesus of his of his disciples
[1:25:34] and of his
[1:25:35] doctrine. Everybody knew he had a
[1:25:37] doctrine.
[1:25:39] Jesus answered him, "I speak openly to
[1:25:41] the world. I ever taught in the
[1:25:44] synagogue and in the temple, whether the
[1:25:46] Jews always research, and in the secret
[1:25:48] have I said nothing. Why ask thou me?
[1:25:52] Ask them which heard me, what I have
[1:25:55] said unto them. Behold, they know what I
[1:25:57] said. Everybody knows what my doctrine
[1:26:00] is. Why you asking me as though it's
[1:26:02] some secret?"
[1:26:06] And when he had just spoken, one of the
[1:26:09] officers which stood by struck Jesus
[1:26:12] with the palm of his hand, saying,
[1:26:14] "Answerest thou the high priest's
[1:26:17] soul?" Jesus answered him, "If I have
[1:26:21] spoken evil, bear witness of the evil,
[1:26:24] but if well, why smitest thou me?"
[1:26:30] the apostles doctrine tracked back to
[1:26:33] the doctrine of Jesus tracked back to
[1:26:35] the doctrine of God.
[1:26:38] But if it stayed just the apostle
[1:26:41] alone, once they all died, that's the
[1:26:45] end.
[1:26:46] But let's follow the journey because I
[1:26:48] said from the apostles doctrine to the
[1:26:50] manifestation is a journey. It's a
[1:26:52] process.
[1:26:53] It's it's it's time is a it stands
[1:26:55] across
[1:26:57] time. Acts 2 and verse 42. first time in
[1:27:02] the
[1:27:04] uh acts of the apostles after Jesus left
[1:27:06] that it's spoken about and they continue
[1:27:10] steadfastly in the apostles doctrine and
[1:27:14] fellowship and in breaking of bread and
[1:27:16] in prayers that's where we
[1:27:18] read these were Jesus's disciples they
[1:27:22] had now become
[1:27:24] apostles if you if you read in your
[1:27:27] Bible I think it's Acts one or Acts Acts
[1:27:29] two or somewhere where they where they
[1:27:32] um where they they chose
[1:27:36] Matias. Then the Bible said the the
[1:27:39] Bible now switched from calling them
[1:27:40] disciples now called them apostles
[1:27:43] because now their master is gone. Now is
[1:27:46] the time for the job. Wait until you
[1:27:49] begin with power from an eye and then
[1:27:51] you can go to all the world beginning at
[1:27:53] Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria unto the
[1:27:56] uttermost parts of the earth. their
[1:27:58] nomenclature or their their their what
[1:28:00] do you call them changed from disciples
[1:28:03] just following to apostles. Now there is
[1:28:06] work to do. They were going to move into
[1:28:09] the work of the ministry. Amen.
[1:28:15] So it wasn't the disciples doctrine, it
[1:28:17] was the apostles doctrine.
[1:28:20] Amen.
[1:28:22] Acts chapter 5. We're following the
[1:28:24] journey of the apostles doctrine. Acts
[1:28:26] chapter 5. And when they had brought
[1:28:28] them, they set them before the council.
[1:28:32] And the high priest asked them, saying,
[1:28:35] did not we straightly command you that
[1:28:38] you should not teach in his in this
[1:28:40] name, the name of Jesus? And behold, you
[1:28:42] have filled Jerusalem with your
[1:28:45] doctrine, and intend to bring this man's
[1:28:47] blood upon us.
[1:28:50] In other words, they were testifying
[1:28:52] themselves that the doctrine the
[1:28:54] apostles doctrine spoke of of Jesus and
[1:28:57] his death.
[1:29:00] Somebody shed his blood. They said don't
[1:29:02] bring his blood upon us. But his
[1:29:05] doctrine, the apostles doctrine
[1:29:07] established all this.
[1:29:12] So at this point here up until now the
[1:29:15] people and the religious leaders
[1:29:17] recognize the apostles doctrine
[1:29:21] to be the same as the doctrine that the
[1:29:23] Lord Jesus Christ taught. Amen. Can you
[1:29:26] say amen? Amen. Amen. Let's go on. Acts
[1:29:30] 13 6-12. And when they had gone through
[1:29:34] the aisle unto Papus, they found a
[1:29:36] certain
[1:29:37] sourc Jew whose name was B Jesus.
[1:29:39] because it was a prophet but it was
[1:29:44] false which was with a deputy of the
[1:29:47] country Sergius Paulus a prudent man who
[1:29:50] called for Barnabas and Saul and desire
[1:29:52] to hear the word of God but Elim the
[1:29:55] sorcerer for show his name by
[1:29:57] interpretation withtood them seeking to
[1:30:01] turn away the deputy from the faith then
[1:30:03] Saul who also is called Paul that's
[1:30:06] where Paul was Paul I mean was called
[1:30:11] Paul for the first time. These things
[1:30:13] matter.
[1:30:15] I think in the convention somebody has
[1:30:16] said and I can remember one of the
[1:30:18] ministers who preached here so
[1:30:20] masterfully has said that
[1:30:23] anytime something a victory is won or
[1:30:26] something goes on a name is changed.
[1:30:35] Then Saul, who is also called Paul,
[1:30:37] filled with the Holy Ghost, the apostles
[1:30:40] doctrine, set his eyes on him and said,
[1:30:43] "Oh, full of all sortility and all
[1:30:46] mischief, thou child of the devil, thou
[1:30:48] enemy of all
[1:30:50] righteousness, will thou not cease to
[1:30:52] pervert the right ways of the
[1:30:56] Lord." Now watch here. God never causes
[1:31:00] children, no matter how much they are
[1:31:02] struggling, he always has a way to make
[1:31:06] room for the prodigal son to come back
[1:31:09] home. But the people that Jesus could
[1:31:11] not stand were hypocrites
[1:31:14] like this guy here who was a false
[1:31:17] prophet who was who was manipulating the
[1:31:20] word of God for for
[1:31:23] gain. And that's why Paul spoke to him
[1:31:26] like
[1:31:27] that. Should we speak to people like
[1:31:29] that? No. But that's the purpose. This
[1:31:32] was a hypocrite. And those were the type
[1:31:35] Jesus couldn't
[1:31:38] stand. Cuz will thou not cease to
[1:31:40] pervert the right ways of the Lord?
[1:31:42] That's the operative word
[1:31:44] there. Verse 11. And now, behold, the
[1:31:47] hand of the Lord is upon thee, and thou
[1:31:49] shalt be blind, not seeing the sun for a
[1:31:52] season. And immediately there fell on
[1:31:54] him amidst any darkness. And he went
[1:31:57] about seeking some to lead him by the
[1:31:59] hand. Then the deputy when he saw what
[1:32:02] was done believed being astonished at
[1:32:05] the doctrine of the Lord.
[1:32:10] The apostles doctrine equals the
[1:32:14] doctrine of the Lord. The people
[1:32:16] themselves acknowledge that.
[1:32:25] So the doctrine of the Lord
[1:32:29] Jesus was passed on from him and
[1:32:32] preached by the apostles including Paul
[1:32:34] who was like a late comer to the
[1:32:39] fold. And with this doctrine of the Lord
[1:32:41] the apostles doctrine the doctrine of
[1:32:43] the Lord Jesus which Jesus said is the
[1:32:45] doctrine of God.
[1:32:48] With this doctrine, the apostles
[1:32:49] doctrine, the early church of Pentecost
[1:32:52] and
[1:32:55] Ephesians, they established the churches
[1:32:59] and they manifested and wrote a book of
[1:33:01] acts behind them. With this doctrine,
[1:33:04] they established the Ephesian churches,
[1:33:07] established church after church after
[1:33:08] church
[1:33:10] and manifested and wrote a book of acts
[1:33:13] behind them. And that's where this
[1:33:15] inspiration for this meeting comes in.
[1:33:18] The apostles doctrine. Amen.
[1:33:22] In other words, the apostles doctrine.
[1:33:24] From the apostles doctrine to the
[1:33:27] manifestation is the book of acts.
[1:33:29] That's right. It's the book of acts. The
[1:33:33] manifestation of the sons of God. From
[1:33:37] the doctrine to the manifestation. In
[1:33:40] between that is the manifestation of the
[1:33:43] sons of sons of God coming back placing
[1:33:45] position and authority for the voice of
[1:33:48] the archangel.
[1:33:57] Amen. So we seen the apostle doctrine in
[1:33:59] the apostles preaching it. Let's see it
[1:34:02] move from the apostles to the
[1:34:03] ministering
[1:34:06] brethren. Timothy the bishops.
[1:34:09] moved. Amen. The heart of the tree kept
[1:34:12] growing.
[1:34:14] 1
[1:34:15] Timothy 1:3. As I besought thee to a
[1:34:18] bachelor at Ephesus when I went into
[1:34:21] Macedonia, that thou mightest judge some
[1:34:23] that they teach no other doctrine. In
[1:34:26] other words, there were people who are
[1:34:27] now
[1:34:28] preaching the apostles doctrine and some
[1:34:32] were preaching some other doctrine
[1:34:38] that they teach no other
[1:34:40] doctrine but the doctrine of the
[1:34:43] apostles which the Lord Jesus also
[1:34:45] taught.
[1:34:48] 1 Timothy verse 4:6. We're trying to see
[1:34:51] the apostles doctrine go to the
[1:34:53] ministers and then go to the
[1:34:56] people. 1 Timothy chapter 4:6. If thou
[1:34:59] put the brethren in remembrance of these
[1:35:01] things, Timothy a young minister, young
[1:35:03] man, but not like a lot of young men
[1:35:05] these days and I I say that with all
[1:35:08] respect because that's what that's why
[1:35:10] I'm so proud of brother. A lot of young
[1:35:12] men become ministers or pastors and they
[1:35:15] know everything. No, it doesn't work
[1:35:17] like that.
[1:35:19] No, life doesn't work like that. Life is
[1:35:21] a process.
[1:35:24] There are some things that come by
[1:35:27] experience. And even with experience,
[1:35:29] you don't have it all figured out
[1:35:31] because the Bible says tribulation works
[1:35:33] patience. Patience works experience.
[1:35:37] Experience works hope. And hope maketh
[1:35:41] not ashamed because of the love of God
[1:35:44] which all this process has placed in our
[1:35:46] hearts. Amen.
[1:35:49] You go from like I'm the pastor here,
[1:35:51] authority, and then you start seeing
[1:35:53] people. You start seeing things. God
[1:35:54] begins to deal with you. You are growing
[1:35:56] yourself. The love of God is growing in
[1:35:58] your heart. And you begin to see things
[1:36:00] from a different perspective. The way I
[1:36:03] handled that, if I knew then what I
[1:36:05] knew, I would have handled more with the
[1:36:07] love of God, which makes not ashamed.
[1:36:09] Oh, can you say amen?
[1:36:13] Glory. Hallelujah.
[1:36:16] The love of God which maketh not ashamed
[1:36:19] because it has been shed abroad in our
[1:36:20] hearts. Shared abroad all over covers
[1:36:22] every situation. Whether it's a
[1:36:24] prostitute, whether he's a sinner,
[1:36:25] whether he's a saint, whether they are
[1:36:26] backing, whether we have to correct them
[1:36:27] over and over and over and over, whether
[1:36:29] we are exasperated with these people,
[1:36:30] whether we are tired of this evil, we
[1:36:32] feel like kicking them out of church.
[1:36:33] Whatever the situation, the love of God
[1:36:35] has been shed abroad, it covers every
[1:36:38] situation.
[1:36:39] Glory, glory, glory, glory.
[1:36:44] [Music]
[1:36:51] 1 Timothy vers 4 and chapter 4 and verse
[1:36:54] 6. If thou put the brethren in
[1:36:57] remembrance of these things like brother
[1:37:00] got us together and we are trying to to
[1:37:02] to admonish one another with the
[1:37:04] remembrance of these things. If thou put
[1:37:07] the brethren in remembrance of these
[1:37:08] things. Paul telling this young
[1:37:10] minister, "Thou shalt be a good minister
[1:37:13] of Jesus Christ." Telling him how to be
[1:37:15] a good minister.
[1:37:17] Not just minister, you got to be a good
[1:37:19] one.
[1:37:20] [Music]
[1:37:23] How to be a good minister of Jesus
[1:37:24] Christ, nourished up in the words of
[1:37:26] faith and of good doctrine
[1:37:32] where unto thou has attained.
[1:37:35] So Paul, an apostle with a doctrine,
[1:37:40] passing it on and Timothy to pass it on.
[1:37:44] 1 Timothy
[1:37:47] 4:13, till I come, give attendance to
[1:37:51] reading, to
[1:37:53] exaltation, to
[1:37:55] doctrine. Know it for
[1:37:57] yourself. Not because the pastor said
[1:37:59] so. Know it for yourself also.
[1:38:04] 1 Timothy chapter 5 and verse 17. Let
[1:38:07] the elders that rule
[1:38:11] well be counted worthy of double honor
[1:38:15] especially they who labor in the word
[1:38:18] and doctrine not just apostles now
[1:38:22] elders
[1:38:24] up to teach or ministering brethren or
[1:38:27] other five ministers of God. 1 Timothy
[1:38:31] chapter 6 and verse one. Let as many
[1:38:33] servants as are under the yoke count
[1:38:36] their own masters worthy of all honor
[1:38:39] that the name of God that you are
[1:38:41] carrying by your doctrine and his
[1:38:44] doctrine
[1:38:45] be not blasphemed. Not your doctrine is
[1:38:49] his doctrine that's been passed on down
[1:38:51] to us.
[1:38:55] 1 Timothy chapter 6 and verse
[1:38:57] three. For a bishop must be blameless as
[1:39:01] the steward of God. Not self-willed, not
[1:39:04] soon angry. That's a bishop. That's a
[1:39:06] minister.
[1:39:08] How many times we ministers, including
[1:39:10] me, I'm when I preach, I'm preaching for
[1:39:12] myself. I'm speaking to myself. I'm
[1:39:13] talking to myself. I I want to come to a
[1:39:16] service, even when I'm preaching, I want
[1:39:17] to grow by the things I'm saying myself.
[1:39:20] What good does he do? Like Solomon said,
[1:39:22] other people's vineyard I've tended to
[1:39:24] my own vineyard. I've left I've left
[1:39:27] neglected. I've left untended to. So I'm
[1:39:31] not talking to anybody. I'm talking to
[1:39:32] me.
[1:39:45] Uh where where was
[1:39:48] I? 1 Timothy 6:3. If any man teach
[1:39:52] otherwise, and consent not to wholesome
[1:39:54] words, even the words of our Lord Jesus
[1:39:56] Christ, and to the doctrine which is
[1:39:59] according to
[1:40:02] godliness, godliness. This doctrine here
[1:40:05] is putting godliness into the people.
[1:40:09] It not just doctrine. It's not just a
[1:40:12] dogma. It's not just our churches
[1:40:15] saints. It's not just our message
[1:40:18] saints. It's the doctrine of God.
[1:40:22] So it has more authority behind it than
[1:40:25] just the apostles or the ministers that
[1:40:27] you see or the prophet Malach for that
[1:40:30] you and I see is a doctrine of God.
[1:40:33] These doctrines according to godliness
[1:40:36] putting godliness into the people.
[1:40:38] That's the goal. That's the target.
[1:40:40] That's the end.
[1:40:44] Titus one Titus 1 79. For a bishop must
[1:40:47] be blameless. That's an elder, a
[1:40:50] minister as the steward of God. Not
[1:40:52] self-will. Oh, that's where I was. Not
[1:40:55] soon angry. I see. We get angry so
[1:40:58] easily. We call it righteous
[1:41:05] anger. Adam's sin
[1:41:08] fell, busted, shattered God's whole
[1:41:11] plan. Please show me in Genesis 3 any
[1:41:16] one ounce of anger that you display in
[1:41:19] God when he met this thing that Adam had
[1:41:22] shattered before him.
[1:41:25] Show me one ounce of
[1:41:27] anger. Show me one ounce of anger there.
[1:41:33] But we we we hide our weaknesses instead
[1:41:36] of facing ourselves. Say is my righteous
[1:41:38] anger. That's why the Bible knows we are
[1:41:40] wise guys. said, "Be angry, but sin
[1:41:43] not."
[1:41:45] So, separate your righteous anger from
[1:41:48] real anger and face yourself and
[1:41:53] repent.
[1:41:55] Amen. Brothers, what I'm saying is that
[1:41:58] too many times we especally we who are
[1:42:00] in leadership whether we are fathers,
[1:42:02] mothers, parents, you know, big
[1:42:05] brothers, big sisters to our younger
[1:42:06] ones or bosses on our jobs or whatever,
[1:42:09] but especially in our context in church,
[1:42:11] those of us in leadership positions in
[1:42:13] church too many times we get angry with
[1:42:16] the
[1:42:17] people
[1:42:19] unnecessarily. when we should not get
[1:42:22] angry. The is a condition for the
[1:42:26] bishop.
[1:42:28] They must not be soon angry. In other
[1:42:30] words, they shouldn't get angry so
[1:42:32] quickly.
[1:42:33] Some of us, the only way we react to
[1:42:35] anything is anger.
[1:42:39] And when we do that, you just create a
[1:42:42] toxic environment in the church where
[1:42:46] people are not free to be themselves.
[1:42:50] You say why should be why should they be
[1:42:51] themselves? They want to be like just I
[1:42:53] get that but listen a while. When people
[1:42:56] are themselves and not giving you a
[1:43:00] spruced up version of themselves, a fake
[1:43:02] version of themselves is the real person
[1:43:05] that God can walk on. But when we get
[1:43:08] this toxic environment, people are not
[1:43:11] themselves. The Holy Spirit doesn't even
[1:43:13] know what to walk on. When they are in
[1:43:15] church, they put on a suit. When they go
[1:43:18] among their friends in the world, they
[1:43:19] put on another suit. When they in their
[1:43:21] homes, they put on another suit. The
[1:43:23] Holy Spirit is confused. And we create
[1:43:26] that of the
[1:43:28] people. A bishop not soon angry. Can I
[1:43:32] hear a witness back? Amen.
[1:43:40] [Applause]
[1:43:47] For a bishop must be blameless,
[1:43:51] shout at the word of God, not selfworth,
[1:43:53] not soon angry, not given to whine, no
[1:43:56] striker, not given to filthy locker like
[1:43:59] going after money, but a love of
[1:44:02] hospitality, a a lover of good men,
[1:44:04] sober, just, holy, temperate, holding
[1:44:07] fast the faithful word as he has been
[1:44:09] taught, that he may be able by sound
[1:44:12] doctrine ing that he has
[1:44:15] go to exod to convince the
[1:44:18] gainsers. The bishop who has been
[1:44:21] taught has now pass is now passing it on
[1:44:25] down the sound doctrine of the apostles
[1:44:28] to the churches and the individual
[1:44:30] members as the doctrine of Christ the
[1:44:34] apostles doctrine. And you can go back
[1:44:36] and check it's all over there all over
[1:44:38] the Bible. You can follow you and trace
[1:44:39] it. Let me run down to second John the
[1:44:43] second epistle of John 2 John chapter 1
[1:44:45] verse 8 and 9. Look to yourselves that
[1:44:48] we lose not those things which we have
[1:44:49] wrought but that we receive a full
[1:44:52] reward. Whosoever transgresseth and
[1:44:55] abideth not in the doctrine of
[1:44:57] Christ among the people hath not
[1:45:03] God. He breaks down for more verse 9.
[1:45:09] have not God. He that abideth in the
[1:45:13] doctrine of Christ, he hath both the
[1:45:16] father and the son.
[1:45:21] In other
[1:45:22] words, the doctrine of
[1:45:25] Christ, the apostles
[1:45:27] doctrine, not the apostles creed, the
[1:45:30] apostles
[1:45:32] doctrine puts
[1:45:35] God, who is God? The father and the son.
[1:45:43] Puts God, which is the spirit. God is
[1:45:46] the spirit. Amen. Puts God, the spirit,
[1:45:51] the
[1:45:51] father, and the son. Who is the son? The
[1:45:55] word in you.
[1:45:59] In other words, the apostles doctrine
[1:46:02] puts the spirit and the word
[1:46:07] in you. So you can write a book of acts.
[1:46:09] You can write another book of acts. Can
[1:46:11] you say amen? Amen.
[1:46:16] So here we find the the end inside the
[1:46:20] goal of the apostles
[1:46:23] doctrine to write another book of
[1:46:26] acts by the spirit and the word going
[1:46:31] together in the church in the
[1:46:33] individual.
[1:46:40] So in summary so
[1:46:44] far Jesus had a
[1:46:46] doctrine. His
[1:46:48] doctrine as we have read in so many
[1:46:50] places like I read to you. Then the
[1:46:53] doctrine of Jesus was passed on by Jesus
[1:46:56] to the apostles including Paul and it
[1:46:59] became known as the apostles
[1:47:03] doctrine. And with this doctrine, the
[1:47:06] apostles doctrine, the apostles
[1:47:09] established and built up believers and
[1:47:12] churches in that original church of
[1:47:15] Pentecost and the Ephesians church
[1:47:19] age. And then each believer in that age
[1:47:23] had the apostles doctrine passed onto
[1:47:26] them by the preaching and the teaching
[1:47:28] of the word from the apostles, from the
[1:47:31] administrators, from the elders, from
[1:47:32] the
[1:47:33] bishops. Amen. So that they will also
[1:47:37] have the father and the
[1:47:41] son. In other words, so that they'll
[1:47:44] have the word with the
[1:47:47] spirit. as second John that I just read
[1:47:50] to you chapter 1 verse 8-9 just
[1:47:54] declared. So what was the impact of the
[1:47:58] apostles doctrine in that early church?
[1:48:01] This was the impact. The apostles
[1:48:04] doctrine created a church and that
[1:48:06] church was a home.
[1:48:10] It wasn't a building where people come.
[1:48:12] It was a home
[1:48:15] for those of us who lead. Forgive me
[1:48:17] brothers. I'm talking to myself so I'm
[1:48:18] not talking like some bishop talking
[1:48:20] down. Forgive me please. I'm sorry.
[1:48:22] Forgive
[1:48:26] me. If you don't strive to create the
[1:48:29] atmosphere in our churches as though it
[1:48:32] was a home that everybody in that church
[1:48:35] will feel like going home when they're
[1:48:37] coming to church.
[1:48:39] Birth. Birth. Birth. Birth. Birth birth.
[1:48:42] Let's get real. Many of our churches are
[1:48:45] like even in our individual church in
[1:48:47] our church in Lagos. Maybe your place is
[1:48:51] different in our church. There are
[1:48:52] people who come to church and feel
[1:48:53] they're against me in this place here.
[1:48:56] And the way we preach many times make
[1:48:59] you feel like that. Everything that
[1:49:01] happens it becomes an issue for the
[1:49:03] whole church. A young man, a young woman
[1:49:05] does something wrong becomes an issue in
[1:49:07] the whole church. Some father or mother
[1:49:09] does something wrong, it becomes an
[1:49:10] issue for the whole church.
[1:49:12] And people feel they're against me
[1:49:16] here. When people feel like that, they
[1:49:18] can feel this is home.
[1:49:27] But then one of the few things I
[1:49:29] remember from medical school, don't come
[1:49:31] to me for treatment of malaria cuz I
[1:49:33] I'll tell you just drink water or
[1:49:36] something. One of the things I remember
[1:49:39] in community medicine in defining a home
[1:49:43] defines a home as a
[1:49:45] shelter. As a shelter from the
[1:49:48] elements, the sun, the wind,
[1:49:53] heat, the elements that will crush you
[1:49:56] when you run into your home, you feel
[1:49:59] safe. That's what the B that's from
[1:50:01] community medicine. I I learned that.
[1:50:04] But that's what the Bible says. The name
[1:50:06] of the Lord where he establishes in his
[1:50:09] name is a strong tower and the righteous
[1:50:13] run into it and they feel
[1:50:17] safe. Pastor, if I'm done wrong, don't
[1:50:20] spare me. Don't spare. I'm not begging
[1:50:23] to be spared. The people are not asking
[1:50:24] to be spared, but they're only asking
[1:50:26] not to speak. We we quote speak the
[1:50:29] truth in love. Yes. But what it really
[1:50:32] represent and means that speak the
[1:50:34] truth.
[1:50:37] in a way that will set free. Say if you
[1:50:40] don't take it, it's the truth that sets
[1:50:42] you free. It's true. But speak the truth
[1:50:45] in a way that will set free.
[1:50:52] So the people are not asking, they want,
[1:50:54] they love
[1:50:55] God. Maybe you have one here. I wonder
[1:50:58] we quote three kinds of believers in the
[1:51:02] church. Okay. If all the church is
[1:51:06] unbelievers, so how you going to get
[1:51:09] them to become
[1:51:10] believers? By cracking their skulls or
[1:51:14] by present them the gospel of love.
[1:51:17] Sinful man, as sinful as we are. What
[1:51:20] was the gospel? For God so loved the
[1:51:26] world that he gave his only only
[1:51:29] begotten son.
[1:51:31] I gave my son for you. Even when we were
[1:51:34] his enemies, he gave himself for us.
[1:51:40] [Applause]
[1:51:54] So the impact of the apostles doctrine.
[1:51:56] I need to run. Oh Lord, help me.
[1:52:01] It created a church
[1:52:04] home. A group of believers in one
[1:52:07] heart, one mind, one
[1:52:10] accord, all in one
[1:52:15] place. Equate a unity among them. A
[1:52:18] unity fostered by the Holy
[1:52:22] Spirit in their midst in the churches.
[1:52:25] Not a unity fostered by our ethnic
[1:52:27] connections. Amen. That's politics.
[1:52:32] Yurubas will support Tobu and all that
[1:52:34] stuff. That's politics.
[1:52:37] And you don't see anything wrong your
[1:52:39] townsman, tribes man does. That's
[1:52:41] politics.
[1:52:42] Not the house of God. Amen. This unity
[1:52:46] is frosted not because we speak the same
[1:52:48] tribal language
[1:52:52] is frosted by the Holy Spirit melting
[1:52:54] and welding our hearts together in love.
[1:52:58] A unity of the Holy
[1:53:01] Spirit. The impact of the apostles
[1:53:03] doctrine created a culture of unity,
[1:53:07] fellowship and growth. Read Acts 2
[1:53:11] again. You will see it there. Then they
[1:53:13] that believed were together, had
[1:53:16] everything
[1:53:17] together, unity, and they broke bread
[1:53:20] from house to house,
[1:53:25] fellowship, and daily such as
[1:53:28] were ordained were added to the church.
[1:53:31] truth.
[1:53:35] The impact of the apostles doctrine
[1:53:38] fostered a culture in the
[1:53:40] churches of unity, fellowship and
[1:53:45] growth.
[1:53:49] To understand this culture of
[1:53:52] growth in the early church of Pentecost,
[1:53:55] we need to track back in time to the
[1:53:58] beginning in Eden where the apostles
[1:54:02] doctrine had its
[1:54:04] origins on the face of the earth as the
[1:54:07] doctrine of God. Just say my doctrine is
[1:54:10] not mine but his that sent me the
[1:54:13] doctrine of God.
[1:54:16] It always comes back to Genesis. Comes
[1:54:20] back to
[1:54:25] Eden. What is the doctrine of God? What
[1:54:28] is doctrine? This doctrine according to
[1:54:30] godliness. What is the doctrine of God?
[1:54:32] What was it? Genesis 1:26 27 28. Let us
[1:54:36] make man in our own image. That's the
[1:54:40] doctrine.
[1:54:41] That is doctrine of God. The word and
[1:54:44] the spirit. That was word. And then God
[1:54:47] the spirit came and formed man into his
[1:54:51] own image. Created man into his own
[1:54:53] image. And you had a man in the image of
[1:54:58] God with a seed in him to be fruitful,
[1:55:02] multiplied, replenished, subdue,
[1:55:05] dominate.
[1:55:14] That's the doctrine of God. Let us make
[1:55:17] minor
[1:55:18] image. It was a doctrine at or a
[1:55:22] doctrine that was targeted at
[1:55:25] creating godliness in man. The doctrine
[1:55:29] according to
[1:55:31] godliness. So this gospel of
[1:55:34] godliness is not a new
[1:55:37] thing. It's not a new
[1:55:41] thing. That was way back before the
[1:55:44] foundation of the world in God's heart.
[1:55:45] But when it came on the face of the
[1:55:47] earth, the same doctrine, same
[1:55:56] gospel, the doctrine of God was aimed at
[1:56:00] creating godliness in man so that man
[1:56:02] can
[1:56:03] reveal and reflect God on the earth, his
[1:56:07] love, his goodness, his grace, his
[1:56:10] loving kindness, his power and great
[1:56:13] glory.
[1:56:17] The origin of the apostles
[1:56:21] doctrine, the doctrine of God in Eden.
[1:56:24] What was the doctrine? Genesis 1:28. I
[1:56:27] say it again. Let us make man in our
[1:56:31] image. From the doctrine to the
[1:56:35] manifestation, the doctrine was there.
[1:56:38] Let's make
[1:56:39] man. And then the doctrine actually
[1:56:42] started to create a man in the image of
[1:56:46] God.
[1:56:50] And by Genesis 1:28, you had the man,
[1:56:53] the forming of the word image. Let us
[1:56:57] make man in our image doctrine first,
[1:57:01] the doctrine of God and then not just
[1:57:04] empty words began to create and form the
[1:57:08] word image in the man. Amen.
[1:57:12] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord.
[1:57:16] But we're not done yet. He has not
[1:57:17] manifested yet. God was still a spirit
[1:57:20] man.
[1:57:24] A spirit, Jesus said, have not flesh and
[1:57:26] bones as ye see me have. In other words,
[1:57:30] you can see a spirit, but this needs to
[1:57:34] be seen.
[1:57:36] So
[1:57:40] Genesis 2:7,
[1:57:43] the what image was anointed by the
[1:57:48] spirit. The spirit created the word
[1:57:51] image. And then the spirit came right
[1:57:54] back and anointed the word image into
[1:57:57] flesh.
[1:57:59] That's what it means. God formed man off
[1:58:02] of the flesh of the ground and the
[1:58:04] spirit it breathe the breath of God. The
[1:58:07] spirit of God breathe into his
[1:58:09] nostrils. Not amoya, the spirit of God,
[1:58:13] the breath of life. And man became a
[1:58:16] living stone, a living soul. And that
[1:58:19] man stood on the face of the earth.
[1:58:21] There is your man. There's your
[1:58:22] manifested son
[1:58:25] from the doctrine through the process of
[1:58:28] creating the word image through the
[1:58:31] process of anointing the word image into
[1:58:33] flesh to a manifested son turning on two
[1:58:38] feet on the face of the earth from the
[1:58:40] apostles doctrine to the manifestation
[1:58:43] from the doctrine of God to the
[1:58:45] manifestation the manifested sons of God
[1:58:48] on the earth adoption time can you say
[1:58:50] amen
[1:58:51] [Applause]
[1:59:06] So just to summarize
[1:59:08] again in
[1:59:11] Eden between the doctrine of God which
[1:59:15] became later known as the apostles
[1:59:18] doctrine between the doctrine of God and
[1:59:21] the
[1:59:22] manifestation Adam in Genesis
[1:59:24] 2:7 between that God created Adam a
[1:59:28] mature fully grown man a manifested son
[1:59:33] of God and it was all by the spirit of
[1:59:35] God taking the it from the doctrine to
[1:59:39] the forming of the word image was by the
[1:59:42] spirit of God God is a spirit and God
[1:59:45] formed men
[1:59:49] in his own image
[1:59:50] Genesis 1:28, God, the spirit formed
[1:59:53] him. And then Genesis 2:7, the spirit,
[1:59:57] God breathed into his nostrils and
[2:00:01] formed him from the dust of the ground.
[2:00:03] It was the spirit doing all of this.
[2:00:06] Glory. So in Eden, between the doctrine
[2:00:09] and the manifestation, God manifested
[2:00:12] what created Adam, a mature, fully grown
[2:00:15] man, a manifested son. And it was all
[2:00:18] about the spirit of God. Amen. Adam was
[2:00:21] created
[2:00:22] perfect, fully grown because I'm trying
[2:00:24] to show you I said we'll track back to
[2:00:27] understand the culture of growth that we
[2:00:29] have in our church or we should have in
[2:00:31] our churches. the culture of growth that
[2:00:34] should be a focus when we are
[2:00:36] ministering the word like Ephesians 4:15
[2:00:39] says until we that we are growing up
[2:00:42] into him in all things is a charge the
[2:00:45] ministry have
[2:00:48] for the work of the min for the edifying
[2:00:51] of the body of edify is to build up to
[2:00:54] grow up something that's our job to grow
[2:00:58] the people to build them up not knock
[2:01:02] them down. Build them up.
[2:01:20] Adam was created fully grown. So he had
[2:01:22] no need for
[2:01:25] growth. He was quy
[2:01:28] mature, fully grown.
[2:01:31] But when he fell in sin, he fell from
[2:01:35] the mature adult son that he
[2:01:40] was. And because he fell representing
[2:01:44] all men because by one man sin came into
[2:01:47] the world. One Adam fell from that
[2:01:49] height of full perfect maturity fell.
[2:01:54] All men
[2:01:55] fell as and if by one man sin came into
[2:01:59] the world even so Paul said in Romans
[2:02:01] even so by one man
[2:02:04] righteousness is imputed unto all. So
[2:02:08] Adam represented you and I. But God did
[2:02:10] not please Adam. He gave you and I a
[2:02:13] chance to rise up from the ground. And
[2:02:17] once Adam fell from
[2:02:20] sin, he fell from that place of
[2:02:24] growth. That's where God incorporated
[2:02:26] into the process. God, I will try again.
[2:02:29] I will come right back again. That's why
[2:02:31] he's the God of a second chance. That's
[2:02:34] where God incorporated growth into the
[2:02:36] process.
[2:02:40] That's why for us from the apostles
[2:02:42] doctrine to the manifestation, there's a
[2:02:44] growth process involved.
[2:02:53] So when Adam
[2:02:56] fell, God incorporated growth into the
[2:03:01] process so that Adam's race, you and I,
[2:03:05] could once more once more grow back into
[2:03:08] the position of sunship that Adam had
[2:03:11] before the
[2:03:14] fall. Growth back into maturity. Growth
[2:03:17] growth back into
[2:03:19] sunship. Growth. That's the primary
[2:03:22] purpose. The church is set up
[2:03:25] for the purpose of
[2:03:29] church. Ephesians 4.
[2:03:34] [Applause]
[2:03:34] [Music]
[2:03:46] Ephesians 4 verse 15. But speaking the
[2:03:50] truth in love, we may grow up into him
[2:03:53] in all things which is the head even
[2:03:58] Christ. Adam was like Christ because it
[2:04:00] was the first it was the first Adam. I
[2:04:03] mean I mean Adam the first Adam was like
[2:04:06] Christ and Christ came the second Adam
[2:04:09] the real person the real Jesus Christ
[2:04:14] and we are only trying to grow back into
[2:04:17] that spot.
[2:04:19] Amen.
[2:04:21] And that's what the church is for.
[2:04:23] Church is the place of growth. Church is
[2:04:26] where people come for to find growth.
[2:04:28] Amen. Growth back into maturity and
[2:04:31] sunship. That's the primary
[2:04:34] purpose and the reason the church of
[2:04:36] Jesus Christ was set up for growth
[2:04:39] growth back into all that Adam
[2:04:42] lost. Amen.
[2:04:45] Amen. H Adam lost the fall. Amen. The
[2:04:50] things that the doctrine of God put into
[2:04:52] him, he didn't have to grow, but he lost
[2:04:55] it all. And we are to grow back. The
[2:04:58] church is set
[2:05:00] up like a garden of Eden to where the
[2:05:03] people can be grown back by the apostles
[2:05:08] doctrine into the full stature of Jesus
[2:05:12] Christ. So they'll come right back to
[2:05:14] the spot of sunship and authority that
[2:05:18] Adam had before the fall. And so since
[2:05:22] the fall, the church has had to grow
[2:05:24] into all of these things.
[2:05:27] But until Jesus came even this growth
[2:05:29] was not possible they will go and back
[2:05:32] go and back. That's why even the great
[2:05:33] ones in the old testament Abraham you
[2:05:36] had some stuff of blight on them um
[2:05:39] David and you know Solomon and all of
[2:05:42] them the growth wasn't possible like
[2:05:45] that until Jesus
[2:05:48] came. God was the second Adam is one
[2:05:51] that's going to show us the way back to
[2:05:53] this
[2:05:54] growth and God is stuck together. That's
[2:05:57] the atmosphere where this growth is
[2:06:00] going to take place. Not in your job,
[2:06:01] not in your school, but in the house of
[2:06:03] God in a community of
[2:06:08] believers. Oh, I think I should skip all
[2:06:10] these. Oh my.
[2:06:18] It's been about one already.
[2:06:20] Wow. All right. So,
[2:06:23] question. So, what are these things that
[2:06:25] Adam
[2:06:26] had which the doctrine of God gave him
[2:06:29] but which he lost and the church now has
[2:06:32] to grow back into? Of course, you know
[2:06:35] them. The three things that Adam lost.
[2:06:37] Eternal life number one. Amen. And in
[2:06:40] his eternal life, it taught the other
[2:06:42] two things. Fellowship with God and an
[2:06:46] inheritance. Amen. in his eternal
[2:06:49] life. These three things which Adam lost
[2:06:52] at the
[2:06:53] four were the things that the doctrine
[2:06:56] of God put into him. And they are the
[2:06:59] same things that the apostles doctrine
[2:07:03] is placing back into the bride of Jesus
[2:07:06] Christ. Hallelujah.
[2:07:10] In
[2:07:11] Eden, the doctrine of
[2:07:14] God. Amen.
[2:07:17] eternal
[2:07:19] life, fellowship with God,
[2:07:23] and an inheritance in his eternal life.
[2:07:26] He lost all that. But before he lost it,
[2:07:29] how did it operate in Eden? So you see
[2:07:31] the love of God that governed and
[2:07:34] operated as the apostles doctrine then
[2:07:37] known as the doctrine of God was in
[2:07:39] operation in Eden. God himself operating
[2:07:42] this.
[2:07:44] Amen.
[2:07:46] Hallelujah. The doctrine of God created
[2:07:49] a love union between God and his
[2:07:52] children. What was that? Giving them
[2:07:55] eternal life.
[2:07:59] And in that union, they reflected his
[2:08:02] image to the world. Let's make man in
[2:08:03] our image.
[2:08:08] They had the eternal life of God in
[2:08:10] them. And they revealed the life of God
[2:08:14] that was in them. In all of their
[2:08:16] interactions, I told you earlier, Jesus
[2:08:18] in all of his interactions reflected
[2:08:20] God. In all of their interactions, Adam
[2:08:24] with his wife
[2:08:26] Eve, their interactions with God, the
[2:08:29] interactions with one another, the
[2:08:31] interactions with the world, the
[2:08:32] animals, all
[2:08:34] nature, they reflected and
[2:08:39] revealed the eternal life of God that
[2:08:41] was in
[2:08:43] them. Whether they were relating to God
[2:08:46] or relating to one another or relating
[2:08:49] to the animals, the world around them,
[2:08:51] the plant life, the the sea and all
[2:08:56] nature around them, they demonstrated
[2:08:58] and revealed the preeminences of God in
[2:09:03] all their interactions and
[2:09:05] relationships. When we talk of God, we
[2:09:08] just we want to pre want to cast out
[2:09:10] devils and all that. That's very true.
[2:09:12] But the preminence of God also is like
[2:09:14] grace to the sinner.
[2:09:16] The preminency of God is no matter how
[2:09:20] evil they are, the grace of God just
[2:09:22] like we were evil and grace return when
[2:09:25] I was lost and undone without God or his
[2:09:27] son still a reach out for me. The
[2:09:29] preeminencies of God.
[2:09:32] Glory.
[2:09:35] [Applause]
[2:09:37] Glory. I'll try to find a place to wind
[2:09:40] down. I see I'm boring you. I'll try to
[2:09:41] find
[2:09:50] they demonstrated the eternal life they
[2:09:53] had in them by the love relationship
[2:09:56] they have with
[2:09:58] God. Their relationship with God was one
[2:10:00] of
[2:10:00] love. Many of us who are here today are
[2:10:04] saved. But we don't have a love
[2:10:06] relationship with God.
[2:10:08] We have a fear relationship with God.
[2:10:12] No, I'm not asking you. I'm telling you.
[2:10:21] If your
[2:10:22] children, natural children, all the
[2:10:25] relationship they have with you is they
[2:10:26] fear you so much you don't have a
[2:10:29] relationship.
[2:10:32] [Applause]
[2:10:38] And we have this fear relationship with
[2:10:42] God many times and we claim a
[2:10:44] relationship with God. No, that's not
[2:10:46] God. But Adam and Eve had a love
[2:10:48] relationship with God. It was like their
[2:10:50] church. Every evening in the cool of the
[2:10:53] evening, God will come down. Adam,
[2:10:55] they'll sit down and have a fellowship
[2:10:56] together. They'll have chat and father
[2:10:58] and son together. How many of you can
[2:11:01] sit down? How many of us including me
[2:11:03] can sit down with our son and our
[2:11:04] daughter and we can have a conversion
[2:11:06] like that?
[2:11:12] I get your home there. Means I shouldn't
[2:11:15] go there, right? All
[2:11:22] right. Or how many of us pastors, let's
[2:11:25] bring that home or ministers can have a
[2:11:27] fellowship with the children, young
[2:11:29] people in church as our children have a
[2:11:32] conversation with them. How many of us
[2:11:34] can do that? That was the home God had.
[2:11:36] It was an atmosphere of love. It was a
[2:11:40] home that love built. Love will be our
[2:11:43] home. That's the home God created for
[2:11:45] Adam and Eve. Because the essence of God
[2:11:48] is love. But we see love as weak or we
[2:11:53] see like God has love. No, God doesn't
[2:11:56] have love. You have love. God is love.
[2:12:02] [Applause]
[2:12:03] God can behave any other way but by
[2:12:06] love.
[2:12:10] God cannot get angry unnecessarily but
[2:12:12] you can because you have love.
[2:12:15] You are not love. I am not love.
[2:12:18] Oh brother, let me try and find a place
[2:12:20] right now.
[2:12:22] [Applause]
[2:12:32] God and Adam had a church in Eden and
[2:12:34] Eve came along later and joined them in
[2:12:37] that church. You know what that church
[2:12:38] was? Know what that church was? The
[2:12:41] general assembly of the firstborn
[2:12:44] church.
[2:12:46] I'm not making that up. That's in the
[2:12:47] Bible. You are not come unto Mount Zion,
[2:12:51] but to the city of the living God. You
[2:12:54] haven't come to a man that cannot be
[2:12:55] touched, but to the general assembly of
[2:12:57] the firstborn.
[2:12:59] That's the church that Adam and Eve and
[2:13:03] enjoy with God their father as the
[2:13:06] pastor.
[2:13:07] It was a church full of love. The love
[2:13:10] of God when love is there sin can stay
[2:13:13] there. The people themselves run to the
[2:13:15] altar to make their lives right.
[2:13:23] Come on. Many of us in authority, people
[2:13:27] come to confess what they have done
[2:13:29] wrong, then we just wait for the bully
[2:13:32] pulpit. Forgive me. Forgive me. Sunday
[2:13:35] morning bully proit.
[2:13:37] You are breaking the head. How dare you?
[2:13:40] You did not
[2:13:41] know. You did not know. The spirit of
[2:13:45] God convicted him
[2:13:47] or her and came to tell you.
[2:13:53] Why bully them any
[2:13:55] further and and become an accuser? Like
[2:13:59] Jesus told the woman, "Where are your
[2:14:02] accusers?"
[2:14:06] [Applause]
[2:14:10] This is not a bully proit. is an altar
[2:14:13] of
[2:14:15] incense where the believers come and
[2:14:18] prayers and supplications are made for
[2:14:19] them. A sweet smelling saber to
[2:14:22] God. Lord, my son, my daughter in the
[2:14:26] church, in the assembly, the father, the
[2:14:28] mother, whoever they have seen, Lord,
[2:14:31] forgive them. Lord, they need this. Help
[2:14:33] them. Do this for them. You know a God
[2:14:36] of love answers you. Faith is not by
[2:14:39] nashing your teeth. The Bible said faith
[2:14:42] workketh by love. When you know this God
[2:14:46] loves you, he said till he gave you his
[2:14:48] only begotten son, how shall he not with
[2:14:51] him
[2:14:53] freely give us all
[2:14:57] [Applause]
[2:15:00] things? That's why that's why you don't
[2:15:04] need any bulldog faith to get faith for
[2:15:07] healing. Faith works by law. You just
[2:15:10] need more love of God in your heart.
[2:15:17] As a father, if your child was ill and
[2:15:21] you had the power to make them
[2:15:23] well, would you make them well or not?
[2:15:28] Jesus said, "If ye then being
[2:15:31] evil know how to do good things to your
[2:15:34] children, how much more will your father
[2:15:38] in heaven
[2:15:39] do good things to his
[2:15:42] children. When they are sick, he will
[2:15:44] heal you. If you went through that
[2:15:46] prayer line yesterday, you were healed
[2:15:49] already. Brother Abraham said just hands
[2:15:52] to be laid on you. Not even the
[2:15:54] Gentiles. Just just speak the word.
[2:15:58] It's the Jews that need hands laid upon
[2:15:59] them.
[2:16:05] But that's how where they were. Adam and
[2:16:07] Eve have a collision with their father.
[2:16:09] That was church.
[2:16:11] And the father will say, "Son, today
[2:16:13] this is the message."
[2:16:15] Say, "Daddy, I don't really understand
[2:16:18] this here." And he will explain to him
[2:16:20] say, "All these years I've been
[2:16:21] preaching this for years, you don't
[2:16:21] understand that." No. You will explain
[2:16:23] to him again and tell him again. Say,
[2:16:26] "Oh, I get it. I get it." Because you
[2:16:29] want your son to have the word for
[2:16:31] themselves. That's where their victory
[2:16:33] lays. This is the victory that overcomes
[2:16:36] the world. even
[2:16:38] our faith.
[2:16:41] You don't get upset. They don't get it
[2:16:42] quickly. You try and try and try and try
[2:16:46] again. Brother said, "How many times
[2:16:47] I've preached and I go back after the
[2:16:50] sermon to go back and pray for the
[2:16:52] people over and over that they'll get
[2:16:55] it." You may be seated. Oh my. Let me
[2:16:58] turn white off. Glory.
[2:17:08] So in Eden, the love relationship
[2:17:09] between God and the God and his
[2:17:11] children, that was the home, that was
[2:17:13] the church
[2:17:14] home. And then they demonstrated his
[2:17:18] pre-minencies by the love relationship
[2:17:19] they they had between one another,
[2:17:21] husband to wife, revealing to the war
[2:17:25] what their father was like in his
[2:17:27] relationships. They were only
[2:17:28] demonstrating the essence of God being
[2:17:31] the God of love.
[2:17:33] Everything that Adam and Eve did, every
[2:17:36] move was a display of the love of God.
[2:17:39] Can we say that much about
[2:17:43] ourselves? The love of God was their
[2:17:45] constant and everpresent
[2:17:50] motivation. Not so I've been seen as a
[2:17:52] strict minister or as no nonsense, but
[2:17:56] just the love of God
[2:17:58] exuding. The love of God will correct
[2:18:00] every wrong. Even before you say one
[2:18:03] word, we'll be standing talking like
[2:18:05] this. All of a sudden, just the prince
[2:18:08] of love will calm down. And all that's
[2:18:10] wrong, all that's evil, we will be taken
[2:18:12] out. The prince of love come down. The
[2:18:15] sick comes there. But the B just said
[2:18:17] the man, I looked at him. I felt so
[2:18:19] sorry for him. It would be like my
[2:18:21] father's age. I put my foot with you to
[2:18:22] see. He was barefooted. And just as I'm
[2:18:24] doing that, the love went to work.
[2:18:28] And the man's blood has popped open.
[2:18:30] Say, I can see. I can see it. Love
[2:18:31] without hands been laid upon them. The
[2:18:33] greatest force in all the world. Like
[2:18:34] pastor read this morning. 1 Corinthians
[2:18:37] 13.
[2:18:39] The love of God. The love of God that
[2:18:42] even the minister, the pastor, the
[2:18:44] father, the son, the husband is not
[2:18:46] embarrassed to confess and apologize to
[2:18:48] his wife.
[2:18:51] [Applause]
[2:18:52] Wife is not embarrassed to to apologize
[2:18:55] to her husband. father is not afraid or
[2:18:58] embarrassed or feel arrogant to
[2:19:00] apologize to their daughter to their son
[2:19:06] because brother
[2:19:07] Brandham who had this apostles doctrine
[2:19:10] that he passed down to us
[2:19:13] there he was he broke into rudely into
[2:19:16] the territory of the wild
[2:19:19] bear and the wild bear charged at him
[2:19:21] how dear you I don't care you are you
[2:19:23] are prophet what I don't care who you
[2:19:25] are
[2:19:28] and people say I don't care which pastor
[2:19:29] I don't care but your father send them
[2:19:32] your way
[2:19:37] and brother Brennham the B was coming it
[2:19:40] was sure certain death and the thought
[2:19:42] struck him if I'm going to die I'm not
[2:19:44] going to go to my lord a coward I'll
[2:19:47] walk bravely to my grave but listen this
[2:19:50] is what it is love dropped down because
[2:19:52] that was his motive all the time love
[2:19:55] dropped down said, "I'm the one that's
[2:19:57] wrong. I'm the one that broke into his
[2:19:59] territory." And said, "Mr. Bull, I am so
[2:20:02] sorry. Please forgive me. I came to
[2:20:05] disturb your peace. I'm sorry. Please
[2:20:07] forgive me. But I'm passing through your
[2:20:09] territory to go pray for my sick
[2:20:11] brother. Please, I'm so sorry. But go
[2:20:12] and sit down and let me pass through."
[2:20:15] And the bull jar and all of a sudden the
[2:20:18] power of
[2:20:19] love, the power of love stopped that
[2:20:22] bullet dead in his tracks. And he just
[2:20:24] hit his heel and just went and sat down.
[2:20:27] Oh, the power of love will always break
[2:20:30] through. It will break through every
[2:20:31] devil, every spirit. It will break
[2:20:34] through sex, fornication, pornography.
[2:20:36] It will break through every filthy
[2:20:39] devil. The power of love, he made a road
[2:20:42] in the wilderness. And the power of Lord
[2:20:44] broke through. The power of Lord will
[2:20:46] break through any time. Amen. And
[2:20:50] amen. Amen. Oh
[2:20:55] brother. Oh
[2:20:58] [Applause]
[2:21:03] brother. The prophet could apologize to
[2:21:06] an animal any man without a soul. How
[2:21:08] about daddy apologizing to the
[2:21:11] son?
[2:21:12] Sure, the son is wrong, but what brother
[2:21:15] did was he showed us a very basic
[2:21:17] principle. What did I contribute to get
[2:21:20] this situation here going? I broke into
[2:21:23] his territory. What did I contribute?
[2:21:25] Maybe I screamed when I should just say
[2:21:28] a few words and he got that person riled
[2:21:30] up
[2:21:32] and bam owned up. I contributed this to
[2:21:35] I am sorry. He went to the be honest. He
[2:21:38] was walking and unknowingly. So I did
[2:21:41] not know. Babban did not know. He broke
[2:21:44] the be and the beast charged at him.
[2:21:46] Same
[2:21:47] thing. The love of God came down. I'm
[2:21:50] the one that broke into the territory.
[2:21:52] They they have every right to charge at
[2:21:53] me like that. And he said, "Bes, I'm so
[2:21:56] sorry. I broke into your territory.
[2:21:58] Forgive me. I'm sorry." I mean, that
[2:21:59] looks cuckoo. It looks almost cuckoo.
[2:22:02] Yes.
[2:22:07] And the beast understood the language of
[2:22:09] forgiveness.
[2:22:10] [Applause]
[2:22:13] They understood I am sorry coming from a
[2:22:16] genuine heart.
[2:22:20] Parents, we're not too big to apologize
[2:22:22] to our children if you if you have
[2:22:25] wronged them in any way. Whether their
[2:22:27] behavior was right or wrong. No, there's
[2:22:29] a proper way to do things.
[2:22:32] The Bible said be angry but sin not. You
[2:22:34] can get angry at them but don't sin
[2:22:36] doing it. When you are shouting shouting
[2:22:38] shouting they only hear the they only
[2:22:40] hear the voice of your shouting and not
[2:22:42] even the content of what you are saying.
[2:22:45] That's being angry and sinning.
[2:22:51] Abraham can appear to be to animals. We
[2:22:54] can apologize to our children. The
[2:22:56] pastor can apologize to the church.
[2:23:00] The husband can apologize to his wife.
[2:23:03] The wife can apologize to the children
[2:23:05] one to another. Doesn't the Bible say
[2:23:08] so? Submit yourselves one to another.
[2:23:13] Don't always want to have your way.
[2:23:18] Let me close out.
[2:23:20] [Applause]
[2:23:35] Hallelujah.
[2:23:38] Oh
[2:23:39] my. Adam lost this loving church home.
[2:23:42] Loving relationship with a loving
[2:23:44] God. A loving home ruled by the love of
[2:23:48] God that the doctrine of God, the
[2:23:50] apostles doctrine helped him to create.
[2:23:54] He lost the spoken word control of
[2:23:56] nature that he displayed under the love
[2:23:59] of God controlling all nature. He lost
[2:24:02] all this. And Jesus came to die and pay
[2:24:06] the price for our redemption and get
[2:24:09] back all of these things that Adam lost
[2:24:12] so that once more man no longer may die.
[2:24:17] Man can reveal what God is really like
[2:24:19] to the world. Sure, Jesus came to do all
[2:24:22] this, came to heal the sick, whatever.
[2:24:23] for the to to die for us. But the
[2:24:26] essence of it all was he came to reveal
[2:24:28] to us what God was like. That's why
[2:24:30] Jesus came. This is Christmas season.
[2:24:32] That's why he came to reveal to us what
[2:24:36] God really truly is
[2:24:37] like. Oh
[2:24:42] my. That was his doctrine. Let us make
[2:24:45] man our image. He preach that doctrine
[2:24:48] of
[2:24:48] God so men and h and women can come into
[2:24:53] the image of God like Adam and Eve did.
[2:24:57] And by the baptism of the Holy Ghost, he
[2:24:59] passed the doctrine of God onto the
[2:25:02] disciples who later became known as
[2:25:06] apostles. But after a while, it was lost
[2:25:09] again. The dogma of the apostles are
[2:25:12] lost again. The story for creeds and
[2:25:14] dogmas. You know the story until God had
[2:25:17] sent again. Malachi, God said, I will
[2:25:20] restore. See the Lord and God sent
[2:25:23] Malachi 4 with the end time message of
[2:25:26] the seven seals and the seven thunders
[2:25:29] to restore the church back to the
[2:25:32] doctrine of the apostles which is the
[2:25:34] doctrine of the Lord Jesus Christ which
[2:25:36] is the doctrine of God.
[2:25:39] What's the
[2:25:40] doctrine? the doctrine which is
[2:25:42] according to godliness to put godliness
[2:25:45] back in you to put God the father and
[2:25:48] the son the word and the spirit back
[2:25:50] into you and I to reflect the
[2:25:53] preeeminences of God to the world to
[2:25:56] reveal him to the world like Paul said
[2:25:59] God reveal when he pleased God to reveal
[2:26:03] his son in me to reveal his son in you
[2:26:06] and I by his seven spirits is perfect
[2:26:10] seven perfect spirits living and
[2:26:12] manifesting in and through your life
[2:26:16] like Adam did, like the early bride of
[2:26:19] Pentecost did. And as with Adam at the
[2:26:25] beginning, the journey from the doctrine
[2:26:28] of God which became known as the
[2:26:30] apostles
[2:26:31] doctrine to the
[2:26:34] manifestation of the sons of God. In
[2:26:37] between will create sons of God in the
[2:26:41] image of God with the word of God
[2:26:43] anointed into their flesh.
[2:26:45] So they can say like Jesus said, I and
[2:26:47] my father are one. the word of God
[2:26:49] anointed into your flesh, you become the
[2:26:51] very manifestation of the word of God
[2:26:55] itself from the apostles doctrine to the
[2:26:58] manifestation. And you write another
[2:27:01] book of acts behind it. In closing, in
[2:27:05] closing, let's bring all of this home.
[2:27:10] Amen. To us today as we are fixing the
[2:27:12] close. Oh my.
[2:27:16] In order to qualify as a church at all,
[2:27:20] any group of
[2:27:21] believers must have a doctrine. You
[2:27:24] can't be a church if you don't have a
[2:27:26] doctrine. You got to have a doctrine.
[2:27:29] And we don't have to search for a
[2:27:30] doctrine. It was given to us.
[2:27:38] In other words, every church must have a
[2:27:41] doctrine or it's not a church. Yes. It's
[2:27:44] just a group of people together.
[2:27:48] To be a church, that group of believers
[2:27:51] must have a doctrine. What is the
[2:27:53] doctrine? It's not dogma. Not just
[2:27:56] words. The doctrine is what that church
[2:27:59] believes. Its belief, its guiding
[2:28:02] principles, what it teaches, what the
[2:28:05] minister, the pastor, what they teach in
[2:28:07] that church, what that church stands
[2:28:09] for. And what they stand for that guides
[2:28:12] and shapes its world view, its
[2:28:17] perspective, what dictates the doctrine
[2:28:21] is what dictates and shapes and guides
[2:28:24] the way the believers in that church
[2:28:27] live and conduct their lives.
[2:28:30] That shapes their focus and their
[2:28:33] aspirations in life.
[2:28:36] It guides them, controls them.
[2:28:43] The darkness that shapes the way they
[2:28:45] see things, the way they view
[2:28:49] things, the way they view all of life in
[2:28:54] general. So from what I said, it's very
[2:28:57] easy to understand and did come to the
[2:29:01] conclusion that the doctrine of a
[2:29:03] church, what that church believes and
[2:29:06] teaches will do a few things. Number
[2:29:09] one, it will dictate how that church
[2:29:11] lives and
[2:29:19] operates. Number two, it will dictate
[2:29:22] how the people that make up that church
[2:29:25] individually, how they live and operate
[2:29:27] because the doctrine is passed on down
[2:29:29] from God to Jesus to the apostles to the
[2:29:33] ministers to the people.
[2:29:36] and the doctrine. We live every time by
[2:29:39] what we believe.
[2:29:41] What we believe is what God sees. How we
[2:29:44] act on the outside. Our behavior is what
[2:29:46] man sees. And our behavior is a large
[2:29:49] part of this thing here, friends.
[2:29:58] In other words, the doctrine of a church
[2:30:02] dictates the
[2:30:04] culture of that church. Now when I say
[2:30:06] culture, people running away culture,
[2:30:07] culture, culture, tradition, tradition.
[2:30:08] No, listen.
[2:30:17] Listen. Every church must have a
[2:30:19] doctrine. And then the doctrine gives to
[2:30:22] that church a
[2:30:23] culture which is its guiding principles
[2:30:27] for living. And culture is simply how we
[2:30:30] live. That's what culture is. Culture is
[2:30:33] not nothing evil. Your culture can be
[2:30:35] fetish but culture simply means how we
[2:30:37] live. In our church here LFCA on Sunday
[2:30:41] morning we open doors at 10. We start
[2:30:43] service at 10:30 or whenever. That's our
[2:30:45] church culture.
[2:30:47] In our church in Lagos, we open the
[2:30:49] doors at 9:00 with Saturdays at 10:00.
[2:30:52] That's our church
[2:30:54] culture. In your church, you have lost
[2:30:56] opera every Sunday of the month or every
[2:30:59] first Sunday of the month. That's your
[2:31:01] culture. The way you live, the way you
[2:31:04] do things.
[2:31:06] Culture doesn't have to mean the fetish
[2:31:08] guy in the village.
[2:31:13] No, culture is simply the way we
[2:31:22] live. Culture is simply how we treat one
[2:31:26] another, how we treat each other.
[2:31:29] Culture is how we do things. Our culture
[2:31:32] is try to be decent and respectful.
[2:31:34] That's our culture.
[2:31:38] Culture is how we treat one another, how
[2:31:40] we do things. Culture is what behavior
[2:31:42] is acceptable among us and what behavior
[2:31:44] is not acceptable. That's our
[2:31:47] culture. Culture don't mean evil.
[2:31:50] Culture don't mean you know babalaw
[2:31:54] or what do they call
[2:31:57] diia? Doesn't mean
[2:31:59] diia. No, culture doesn't mean that.
[2:32:02] Culture mean the way we do things. All
[2:32:04] right. I'm so sorry. Okay, I'm I'm
[2:32:07] stretch stressing you, but I'm almost
[2:32:09] done.
[2:32:11] The early church lived by the doctrine
[2:32:14] of the apostles, and that
[2:32:17] doctrine and belief guided and shaped
[2:32:20] every area of their lives. To them, the
[2:32:23] apostles
[2:32:24] doctrine was more than just words. It
[2:32:28] was the guiding principle that they
[2:32:30] committed and by discipline live their
[2:32:32] lives by. And that created a culture of
[2:32:37] fellowship. They fellowship from house
[2:32:39] to house created a culture of unity.
[2:32:41] They had all things common and created a
[2:32:43] culture of growth.
[2:32:45] They were those was we say why did they
[2:32:47] church daily? A culture of unity,
[2:32:49] fellowship, growth. That's what our
[2:32:52] churches should be. Taken from that
[2:32:54] example. Oh brother. Amen.
[2:32:59] Amen. And so we can see very clearly
[2:33:03] that the apostles doctrine fostered a
[2:33:05] culture of fellowship, unity and
[2:33:07] growth. Felt fellowship and unity, one
[2:33:10] mind, one accord in the church were
[2:33:12] essential
[2:33:14] ingredients. Listen to
[2:33:16] this. Then they that believed, the Bible
[2:33:19] say they that believed were all with one
[2:33:21] accord together so they could grow. Yes.
[2:33:26] Maybe why our young people are unruly
[2:33:30] and they don't grow is because we who
[2:33:32] are the leaders don't create this
[2:33:34] culture of unity and fellowship in our
[2:33:36] assemblies.
[2:33:38] Because if the acts of the apostles
[2:33:40] church with Peter, all of them that met
[2:33:43] Jesus that were that ministered were
[2:33:45] ministered to by Jesus. If those people
[2:33:49] knew that they needed to have a culture
[2:33:52] of unity and fellowship
[2:33:56] for the new believers to grow,
[2:34:00] maybe that's where the problem is.
[2:34:03] Maybe we're not fostering this culture
[2:34:06] of unity and fellowship in our not
[2:34:09] outside, not church to church, in our
[2:34:11] own churches alone. Maybe it's not so
[2:34:14] much the young people who have a problem
[2:34:16] after all. Maybe it's me, the pastor,
[2:34:18] that has a problem.
[2:34:21] Maybe it's us, the leadership that has
[2:34:22] it. Maybe it's the deacons that have a
[2:34:23] problem.
[2:34:27] Maybe maybe maybe it's the young people
[2:34:30] themselves.
[2:34:33] Maybe brother
[2:34:36] Billip as any young man growing up he
[2:34:39] had challenges because brother Billip
[2:34:41] from like 14 15 was brother Bham didn't
[2:34:43] get a chance to you know to swing and
[2:34:46] paint the town red like other young
[2:34:47] people and he didn't have an experience
[2:34:49] with Christ young people have an
[2:34:50] experience with Christ don't want to
[2:34:51] paint the town red like that but have an
[2:34:53] experience but the angel I want Billy
[2:34:56] Paul to walk with you and so Billip
[2:34:59] literally gave everything up to walk
[2:35:01] with his father, college, everything
[2:35:04] work with his
[2:35:08] father and when Bill was in his later
[2:35:10] years like in the in his 30s 40 said
[2:35:12] daddy why am I feeling like I want to go
[2:35:14] and play ball like a teenager and all
[2:35:17] but mom said what it is you did not d
[2:35:20] that didn't wear out of you didn't do
[2:35:21] that when you were supposed to die
[2:35:23] that's where why it's like that for you
[2:35:26] so don't be mad at
[2:35:29] yourself but Billy Paul himself told the
[2:35:31] story one time that when
[2:35:36] he this youthful thing in him was just
[2:35:39] worldly and he was in brother Bham's
[2:35:42] house in in in Jeff for those of you
[2:35:44] who've been in Jeff you've seen the
[2:35:45] house that's is that
[2:35:47] house I think so I'm not sure I think so
[2:35:49] I'm not very sure don't quote me about
[2:35:51] that but I think so I'm not exactly sure
[2:35:54] so believe Paul said when daddy has
[2:35:57] going to sleep he will go out through
[2:35:58] the window and go to town to to his
[2:36:01] friends and do whatever just like his
[2:36:03] child growing up wrong, filthy,
[2:36:09] ungodly. So one day and he will come
[2:36:12] back and go through the window and go
[2:36:14] back to his room and the morning he's
[2:36:16] lying down, daddy is sleeping to see him
[2:36:17] and say like, "Oh, believe Paul was here
[2:36:19] all night." But he
[2:36:20] wasn't. So this particular day
[2:36:24] while he was coming in and he had to
[2:36:26] pass through the sitting room to go to
[2:36:28] his room. Here was brother Bham in the
[2:36:32] sitting
[2:36:34] room and said Billy come here son I need
[2:36:39] to talk with
[2:36:41] you. So it's not that
[2:36:45] we I'm saying you don't correct sin. No
[2:36:48] God his essence is love. He cannot stand
[2:36:51] sin
[2:36:53] but doesn't do it the way you and I do
[2:36:55] it. And brother Brandham said Billy son
[2:36:57] s said son you know God gave me this
[2:37:00] house and we live in this house the way
[2:37:02] he wants. This lifestyle you are having
[2:37:06] it will not be honoring to god to be
[2:37:08] displaying that kind of life in this
[2:37:10] house here. You are old enough son you
[2:37:12] don't have to live here but if you must
[2:37:15] live here you can't live this way. He
[2:37:17] didn't scream, shout and like what kind
[2:37:19] of things don't you know I'm pastor
[2:37:20] don't I'm prophet nothing like that
[2:37:22] that's so focused on you that just focus
[2:37:24] on how you will look like
[2:37:30] I'm I'm not talking about you that's
[2:37:32] what the Bible says our parents
[2:37:34] corrected us for their own good but God
[2:37:37] for our own good and that's what the man
[2:37:39] was doing believe you can't live this
[2:37:40] way it's not honoring to Jesus but if
[2:37:43] you must live this way that's fine but
[2:37:44] you can't do it under this roof so you
[2:37:46] have decide son you want to stay here
[2:37:48] you change this lifestyle you don't want
[2:37:50] to stay here that's fine you can go
[2:37:51] anywhere and Paul said dad I'd like to
[2:37:53] go
[2:37:54] out I I can't stay I'd like to go and
[2:37:57] mom says no problem son and said Billy
[2:37:59] Paul just know that here I am here I am
[2:38:04] son when you're tired you want to come
[2:38:06] back home you can always come and here I
[2:38:09] am I stand here at the foot of the us.
[2:38:14] [Music]
[2:38:16] And brother Bam stretched out both arms
[2:38:18] like that and said, "Son, this way here
[2:38:21] leads to
[2:38:22] righteousness. This way here leads to
[2:38:24] destruction, but when you're a child,
[2:38:26] you can come." I believe Paul said,
[2:38:29] "Dad, I want to have a good time." And
[2:38:32] he left and went to stay with his
[2:38:34] grandmother. And you and I will say the
[2:38:37] grandmother took her took him. Granny,
[2:38:40] what? What? What? None of
[2:38:44] that. I mean, and Jefferson is a small
[2:38:46] town. Everybody knows everybody. Even in
[2:38:49] 1980, 1980, 15 years after brother
[2:38:51] Vanam, I was in Jeff and and with
[2:38:54] brother Ayo, brother Jasmine was taking
[2:38:55] us around and we entered a a a I think a
[2:38:58] Ponderosa steakhouse or somewhere and
[2:39:00] and brother I mean the the the elderly
[2:39:04] woman there saw Brother J said, "Oh, you
[2:39:06] are Billy Brham's son-in-law, right?"
[2:39:09] And by just said yes, everybody knew
[2:39:12] everybody. So one of these days, Billy
[2:39:14] Paul was in a night out having a good
[2:39:19] time
[2:39:21] and somebody said, "You are Billy
[2:39:23] Bramson, right?" He said, "No, I'm
[2:39:25] not." And he said, "Because the way I'm
[2:39:28] living,
[2:39:30] I'm not worthy to be called a son. What
[2:39:32] I'm doing is not honing to my father."
[2:39:33] Said, "No, I'm not." Long story short,
[2:39:36] one of the days believe Paul went to the
[2:39:37] tabernacle. staggered to the tabernacle
[2:39:40] and the mission went on and Bill's
[2:39:42] testimony himself I heard his testimony
[2:39:44] himself he gave himself not he has
[2:39:45] believe Paul said this himself is
[2:39:47] staggered to the altar to give his life
[2:39:49] back to God and while he was at the
[2:39:51] altar a deacon who loved him and love so
[2:39:53] much ran to be beside Billy Paul and
[2:39:55] knelt down by him and was talking to him
[2:39:57] you know how we do he was talking to him
[2:39:59] was talking to Billy Paul talking to him
[2:40:00] talking to him talking to him brother
[2:40:02] Bham called for that
[2:40:04] deacon Billy Paul's testimony bam called
[2:40:06] for that deacon and brother Bam told him
[2:40:08] like not because he's my son don't talk
[2:40:09] to him. He said no. Bam said you know
[2:40:11] what just like Jesus did with the woman.
[2:40:13] Said you know what God is dealing with
[2:40:15] him. God brought him here himself. We
[2:40:16] didn't go big him. God brought him here
[2:40:19] himself. We talked too much many times.
[2:40:22] He said let God deal with him.
[2:40:27] And the deacon left Billy Paul alone.
[2:40:30] See what happened? There was Billy Paul.
[2:40:34] The love of a father. Billy Paul young
[2:40:37] man had a smoking habit and was going
[2:40:40] with and the angel
[2:40:43] and he was feeling so condemned am I
[2:40:45] living this life that's how many of
[2:40:47] these people feel that we are bashing
[2:40:50] like that no I'm not saying correct sin
[2:40:51] but did I just told you
[2:40:54] examples but how much sweeter if God the
[2:40:57] love of God himself will deal with the
[2:40:59] people
[2:41:03] I believe Paul was with brother Benham
[2:41:05] with brother Bham and he was feeling so
[2:41:07] condemned while brother Bam was driving
[2:41:09] driving on he had some a pack of
[2:41:13] cigarettes in his pocket and when he
[2:41:15] thought brother B wasn't looking he took
[2:41:17] that pack of cigarette he was feeling so
[2:41:18] condemned so condemned wasn't about like
[2:41:21] that son you are disgracing me none of
[2:41:23] that just let the love of God show
[2:41:26] reflecting revealing God to the world to
[2:41:31] your family to your children to
[2:41:33] everybody
[2:41:34] And believe Paul wasn't
[2:41:36] looking was looking. He took the pack of
[2:41:38] cigarette out and and the car he he it
[2:41:41] wasn't like now when every car is air
[2:41:43] condition those times many of the cars
[2:41:45] didn't have any air conditioning or
[2:41:46] anything. He it he it he took the he
[2:41:48] took the part out of his of his of his
[2:41:51] pocket when he b wasn't looking and he
[2:41:53] threw it out through the window and when
[2:41:55] they drove a few of brother Bam said son
[2:41:59] I understand what's going on. He said,
[2:42:02] "Billy, I know. I saw what just
[2:42:05] happened." Well, we said, "Dad, I I
[2:42:07] didn't know you saw." Said, "I saw, son.
[2:42:09] I understand what's going on." And he
[2:42:11] said, "Dad, I'm just so bound by this. I
[2:42:14] don't know what to do." Said, "Don't
[2:42:16] worry, son. Let's turn back around."
[2:42:19] So, Babam turned the car back
[2:42:21] around and went to that spot where Billy
[2:42:25] Paul had thrown the cigarette. Pocket of
[2:42:27] cigarette. I know what it was. The
[2:42:29] packet of cigarette was was where he
[2:42:31] threw it out was hanging at a place
[2:42:33] where the trees made the sign of a cross
[2:42:38] and brother Brennham went with Paul
[2:42:39] there and said son this will never
[2:42:43] trouble you
[2:42:45] [Applause]
[2:42:48] again love dropping down with our hands
[2:42:52] being laid
[2:42:53] on love will cast out evil spirits will
[2:42:57] cast out sex, filthiness, ungodliness.
[2:43:04] We'll make the short capsule go down.
[2:43:06] Wipe off the lipsticks and all the, you
[2:43:09] know, filthy stuff that these young
[2:43:12] folks put on their faces these days.
[2:43:16] Don't hear what I'm not saying. I'm not
[2:43:17] saying don't correct wrong or sin. I'm
[2:43:20] just saying how we do it.
[2:43:23] Let love be our the love of God. Come on
[2:43:28] now. Unconditional be our motivation.
[2:43:33] Amen.
[2:43:36] That's what our churches should be like
[2:43:38] so that we can create the love of God
[2:43:41] was there to give the apostles do the
[2:43:43] doctrine of God. And that love created
[2:43:46] man in his image. And that love anointed
[2:43:49] the body image into man's flesh.
[2:43:52] But many of our churches are like the
[2:43:55] home the prodigal son grew up in his
[2:43:58] organist. Oh love of God, how rich and
[2:44:00] poor, how rich
[2:44:03] and pure, how measurless, how strong, it
[2:44:07] shall forever more endure. Is the same
[2:44:10] song that saints and angels sing. Angels
[2:44:15] never needed redemption, but they can
[2:44:17] acknowledge the love of God.
[2:44:19] Oh
[2:44:21] [Music]
[2:44:23] hallelujah. The prodigal son is home.
[2:44:27] The father like
[2:44:30] God. This son came to him. Give me what
[2:44:32] matters to me. And the father gave him
[2:44:34] and he went and destroyed
[2:44:37] everything. But he never forgot in my
[2:44:40] father's house. The equality of love in
[2:44:43] that house. And what the father did? We
[2:44:47] have young people who are backing in our
[2:44:48] churches. Some of them are still sitting
[2:44:50] there. Some of them have gone out. That
[2:44:52] father taught a lesson and that was God.
[2:44:55] Always make room for the prodigal son to
[2:44:59] come back home.
[2:45:03] Always make room for the prodigal son to
[2:45:06] come back home. Don't be that when they
[2:45:08] come to church once that's when you are
[2:45:10] bashing their sin and all that stuff.
[2:45:12] Let God deal with them. Hallelujah.
[2:45:14] Preach the engrafted word to save their
[2:45:16] souls. Hallelujah.
[2:45:19] But the prodigal son was so messed up
[2:45:23] the father wasn't there. But the love of
[2:45:25] God, the blood hound was after him and
[2:45:28] got him to a corner one day said, "I've
[2:45:31] had enough. I've as why should I keep on
[2:45:34] living like
[2:45:36] this in my father's house, our church
[2:45:39] home, my parents' home? my church home
[2:45:42] where the the pastor, the ministers, the
[2:45:45] deacons, even hired servants, visitors
[2:45:48] who don't belong in that home, they they
[2:45:50] get more love than I'm getting here
[2:45:52] being treated this way here. I will
[2:45:55] arise. I will go to my father. I'll say,
[2:45:58] "Father, I have sinned before you and
[2:46:01] against
[2:46:02] [Music]
[2:46:07] heaven." But the father had kept looking
[2:46:11] for his
[2:46:14] son. It wasn't about you were rude to
[2:46:16] me, you were nasty, you did this. None
[2:46:19] of that. That's
[2:46:22] pettiness. When we do that, we are not
[2:46:25] worthy the name of leadership.
[2:46:27] [Music]
[2:46:30] And when the father saw him, he saw his
[2:46:33] son coming. The father ran quickly to
[2:46:36] meet his son. And the son is wondering,
[2:46:39] "Did he forget what I did or what's
[2:46:42] going on
[2:46:43] here?" He said, "Father, I'm not worth
[2:46:46] because your son said, "No, you always
[2:46:49] were a son. Nothing ever changes that.
[2:46:53] You'll always be my son. You are my son.
[2:46:55] You will always be my son. Messed up,
[2:46:58] broken, filthy, you will always be my
[2:47:02] son. Come on, let's make a feast and
[2:47:06] let's let's let's My son who was lost
[2:47:09] has come back home. The prodigal son has
[2:47:13] come back
[2:47:14] [Music]
[2:47:16] home. But there are many of us, like I
[2:47:18] heard somebody say recently, many of us
[2:47:21] in the church are not prodigal sons,
[2:47:23] unsaved. We're saved but we are prodigal
[2:47:26] brothers. The prodigal son was so far
[2:47:29] away from his father's loving embrace
[2:47:30] from his father's love. Same way many of
[2:47:33] us in the church whether we are
[2:47:34] ministers, pastors, deacons, father,
[2:47:37] mother, brother, sister, we have never
[2:47:40] entered into the loving embrace of a
[2:47:42] loving father. Our relationship with God
[2:47:45] is not one of love. It's one of fear. We
[2:47:48] wake up in the morning, we are afraid of
[2:47:49] God. We are afraid of him in the
[2:47:51] morning, in the afternoon, in the night.
[2:47:52] No, that's not love. That's a stressful
[2:47:54] relationship.
[2:47:58] And the body girl
[2:48:00] brother girl away from the loving
[2:48:03] embrace of his father. He was a
[2:48:06] brother. And when he came, he saw them
[2:48:09] rejoicing over a lost sinner. He said,
[2:48:13] "What's going on here? This filthy boy
[2:48:16] that did all these filthy
[2:48:18] things, what what's gone wrong with
[2:48:20] that?
[2:48:22] that for real this boy that did all of
[2:48:26] these things
[2:48:27] here and you throw the carpet open for
[2:48:30] him like that. The father said, "Son,
[2:48:34] this your brother was lost. Let's
[2:48:36] rejoice." Said, "Rejoice. All the filthy
[2:48:39] things he did, look at
[2:48:42] me. I've been here with you. I never
[2:48:44] broke your law." That's what he thought.
[2:48:48] He thought he needed to earn God's
[2:48:51] approval. He needed to earn God's
[2:48:54] commendation. He needed to earn it as
[2:48:56] not broken your law. That's not a
[2:48:59] relationship. That's not a relationship.
[2:49:01] If your wife has to win your approval
[2:49:04] every day, that's not love. If your
[2:49:06] children have to be real every day,
[2:49:07] that's not love. When they do wrong,
[2:49:09] when they do bad, they are still your
[2:49:11] children. I'm not saying what they did
[2:49:13] is good, but this is the love of God.
[2:49:17] that conquers all, that covers all filth
[2:49:21] and multitude of iniquities and
[2:49:25] sin. He said, "Son," he said, he said,
[2:49:27] "I've been here with you. You never did
[2:49:29] this for me. You never killed a five car
[2:49:31] for me." And the father say, "Son,
[2:49:33] that's the problem. You've been in the
[2:49:35] church all so long. You've even
[2:49:37] preached, minister, pastor, but you've
[2:49:39] never come into the loving embrace of a
[2:49:42] loving father God that I am
[2:49:46] to where it's not what you do that wins
[2:49:50] my approval. It's because of Jesus who
[2:49:54] won my approval. A man approved of God.
[2:49:57] That's why you are approved of God. Not
[2:49:59] because you could never do a thing that
[2:50:01] will win my approval. And son, don't you
[2:50:05] know I didn't kill a cow for you and all
[2:50:07] that? Don't you know, son? If you
[2:50:10] embrace my love, you'll know that what
[2:50:13] you have, what I have is yours. All that
[2:50:16] I have is yours. Didn't you understand
[2:50:19] that, son? When you come into this
[2:50:20] loving relationship with God, you'll
[2:50:22] know your father's unconditional love.
[2:50:25] Everything he has is yours. his power,
[2:50:28] his grace, his glory to heal, to
[2:50:32] deliver, to set free, to save from your
[2:50:35] sin and deliver you and make you a new
[2:50:38] from the apostles doctrine to the
[2:50:43] manifestation of the sons of God where
[2:50:46] burn sons, real sons will come back and
[2:50:49] their word is back. God bless you.

[3:09:16] feel his
[3:09:18] anointing? Praise God.
[3:09:20] Amen. Praise God. We're so happy today.
[3:09:24] I really love what brother
[3:09:27] Olu spoke to us by way of this message.
[3:09:31] And uh you can keep playing softly.
[3:09:32] We're getting ready to close out. And
[3:09:34] it's so practical. It's just things that
[3:09:36] we can do. Things that we can go out and
[3:09:39] do. It's not just it's not it's not like
[3:09:41] a wish like we're wishing for perfection
[3:09:42] or we're hoping for perfection. But
[3:09:45] there are things that we could do every
[3:09:46] day that takes us closer to the cross
[3:09:49] every day. It takes us closer to the
[3:09:51] capstone, the headstone, the chief
[3:09:53] cornerstone. Things that you can do,
[3:09:55] things that you can practice, things
[3:09:57] that you could actually fulfill.
[3:09:59] reaching out, living, giving up
[3:10:02] yourself, thinking of others before
[3:10:05] yourself and really living a life of
[3:10:07] sacrificial life, life of service,
[3:10:10] servitude. A lot of what he said today
[3:10:13] is about leadership, about how we can
[3:10:15] really uh come into a way that God could
[3:10:18] use us. God could use us. putting
[3:10:21] ourselves last really in the picture and
[3:10:24] seeing how we could be used by God
[3:10:27] effectively to work to each member
[3:10:30] working effectually in the body of Jesus
[3:10:32] Christ. Amen. Each member giving in the
[3:10:34] body of Jesus Christ. Each one a servant
[3:10:36] in their own way. Whether you're big
[3:10:39] shot or medium shot, doesn't matter who
[3:10:41] you are, God could use you in your
[3:10:43] capacity to reach somebody else. That's
[3:10:47] the whole point of what it's all about
[3:10:49] today. And we certainly thank God for
[3:10:50] that. Amen. So, let's just bow our heads
[3:10:53] as we want to close and ask God's
[3:10:56] blessing upon us as we leave and
[3:10:58] certainly thank God for being with us
[3:11:00] today in this presence. Amen. Almighty
[3:11:04] God, we are so humbled by you, Lord.
[3:11:08] Lord, when we see the word and when we
[3:11:11] see Christ, Lord, reflected in his own
[3:11:13] word, Lord, and how you lived among the
[3:11:16] people, how you taught among the people,
[3:11:20] Lord, how you expressed yourself, Lord,
[3:11:23] the image of an invisible God is
[3:11:26] expressed upon the streets of Jerusalem,

[3:12:20] we could henceforth be no more children,
[3:12:22] Lord, but we could be mature, growed up,
[3:12:25] Lord. And how be it, we speak wisdom to
[3:12:28] them that are perfect. Father, we thank
