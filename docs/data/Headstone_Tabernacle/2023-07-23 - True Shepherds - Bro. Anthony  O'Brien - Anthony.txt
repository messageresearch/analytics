amen praise God Amen each and every one of us really put our shoulder to the wheel special ways and different ways really thank God for all of you amen just really a great sacrifice and really a great Victory this morning amen just thank God for all of it we certainly appreciate all of you who contributed to put efforts together I think it really was a success I think everyone was really blessed both local and foreign amen and I think everybody goes a long way and you know if you want to show God you love him you want to just love his people amen do good to them amen and reach out and save someone in some way that you can so at Christianity is about it's what it should be about it's not right amen he said he appreciate the ministers that came and ministered from uh from all around the world Amen and who came and came of themselves and the labor sacrifice thank God to them so much so we feel our hearts are full I think we're still chewing off of the convention tapes and amen and we we know that the Lord has been with us amen and as it goes around and continues to bless the people from here on out just continue to see what what what fruits will be gained from what labors have gone for amen so we just look forward and continue to look forward to what God has done is doing and what he will do amen prisoner you love him amen so we're glad to be here this morning yeah my wife would be the church this morning we just want to thank you so much just to be here amongst you is a privilege to be called a Christian Amen to be called a sons of God amen amen my wife and families that she's not feeling too well but well we wanted to be in the house of the Lord amen because in his presence there's fullness of joy it's healing for your body healing for your spirit healing for your soul amen amen so do you want to appreciate a pastor this morning and [Applause] um you know there's Division and the labor to put the convention together um just really really um Priceless I think you know you could put a price on this and price on that and what this costs and whatever but uh the real gift that he yielded I think uh God gave the increase amen so um so that's really tremendous for me just thank God for God's leadership well praise the lord we have a mass hour message upon my heart to bring to the church this morning amen you know their Pastor asked me to take the service this morning so God Richie bless you thank you so much so much musicians amen praise God basically want to total for now to the scriptures um and I have two scriptures we'd like to read from here that's Ezekiel 34. and we want to read from Saint John chapter 10. amen and um preschool Ezekiel 34 Saint John chapter 10. Ezekiel 34 says oh sorry from verse one if you have it say man okay good nice so Ezekiel 34 and verse 1 says and the word of the Lord came unto me saying son of man prophesy against the Shepherds of Israel prophesy and say unto them thus saith the Lord God unto the Shepherds will be to the Shepherds of Israel that do feed themselves should not the Shepherds feed the flocks so it seems in this scripture that God the Father got a report about the Shepherds in Israel that Disturbed him very much so he touches his anointed Ezekiel and he speaks the following he says he eat the fat and he clothed with you the world ye kill them that are fed but you feed not the flock the disease they have not strengthened neither have ye healed the uh that which was sick neither have he bound up that which was broken neither have he brought again that which was driven away neither have he sought that which was lost but with force and with cruelty have you ruled them 11. and there's a lot in there but we just want to get the context this morning so from verse 11 says but for thus saith the Lord God behold I even I will both search my sheep and seek them out as a Shepherd she get out of his flock in the day that he is among his sheep that are scattered so will I seek out my sheep and we deliver them out of all the places where they have been scattered in the Cloudy and dark day I will bring them out from the people and gather them from the countries and will bring them into their own land and feed them upon the mountains of Israel by the rivers and in all the inhabited places of the country I will feed them it could posture and upon the high mountains of Israel shall they be their fold be bear shall they lie in a good food and in a fat pasture shall we feed upon the mountains of Israel I will feed my flock and I will cause them to lie down save the Lord amen is going to give you rest amen do you believe in Saint John 10 you know I want to read from verse 11 in there and this is Jesus in the New Testament amen let's look at the reflection here now Saint John 10 and chapter chapter 10 and verse 11. says for thus said the Lord God behold oh no sorry um I'm the Good Shepherd oh sorry let me just get that quick made a mistake here praise God the scripture repeated amen amen so let's just get it Saint John chapter 10. and verse 11 right he said for I am the Good Shepherd the Good Shepherd giveth his life for the Sheep he that is unhealing and not the shepherd whose own sheep are not see it the wolf coming and leave at the Sheep and flee it and Runway and the Wolf catches them and Scattered the Sheep so you see we're seeing the the the the the the the comparison in here between Ezekiel and what we just read right the heiling flee it because he is unhired and careth not for the Sheep I am the Good Shepherd I know my sheep and I'm known of mine as the father knoweth me even so no I the father and I lay down my life for the Sheep another sheep I have which are not of this fool them also I must bring and they shall hear my voice there shall be one fold and one Shepherd amen is not any man one Lord one feet one baptism amen where does my father therefore does my father love me because I lay down my life that I might take it again amen and God had a blessing to ring of his word let's just pray one more time Heavenly Father Lord we thank you Lord to be in your presence this morning in your presence there's fullness of joy your presence there is Direction there is help there is edification there is your presence your spirit teaching us and showing us the way father may you show us the way this morning but we don't know him and we acknowledge our own insufficiencies Lord father we look to you now Lord our eyes upon you father my eyes are upon you Lord May anointing come may your presence come and help us this morning as we look to your word father for guidance and for leadership Lord we thank you Lord that you are the Good Shepherd this morning and Lord we just pray that your spirit will come down into these scriptures and help bring it to life in in a way that would that would help us give us strength for the journey Lord and encourage our hearts Lord father raise up the downtrodden Lord father bring the needy up out of the downhill o god father may you get Glory this morning Lord out of your word Lord and Lord may just liberate your people in this presence today Lord we commit this time of the word and sharing Lord father into your hands Lord and we pray that you take control of the preacher now have your own way fathers we hide ourselves behind your cross Lord in Jesus name amen and amen you may be seated now praise God God rich and bless amen so do you love him this morning amen are you happy to be in his presence amen well I have a title this morning title of my message is true Shepherds true Shepherds that's the title I have this morning and through the unfolding of the lives of God's people in Scripture we could see the purpose of God coming more plainly and more plainly interviewed it's not right God uses the lives of his people his believing children His prophets his servants he uses their lives to tell a story to tell a story of his goodness to tell a story of his love to tell a story of his of his provisions to tell a story of his grace towards us that's why we ought to live every day in the thankfulness of God because through sunshine and through shadow he cares for us and we get to see that every single day what a privilege it is to be called the sons of God just for that alone we ought to be able to give God a shout of praise because there's not a day in my life that I have not seen the hand of God in every situation doesn't matter if you can't see him or not just know this morning that he is on your on the throne he is on the throne this morning and he is very much in control of the situation even though you can't see your foot or where to put your foot in front of you just know that God knows everything about you this morning and he's here to take you by the hand and lead you to his Promised Land pray and make you a witness of his presence and a testimony that God is good that his Mercy is Everlasting and that his truth endureth forever the devil didn't win the battle but Jesus got the victory oh he didn't let the devil win this morning oh he won't let the devil win this morning oh honey he's going to give you the victory because he loved you and because he called you from the beginning we are his people and we are a sheep of his pasture and we are here to give him all the praise give him all the honor and give him all the glory this morning oh can somebody help me Praise Him I don't know about you and I come to praise my God this morning because he woke me up this morning he he put life in my body he put breath in my lungs he provided for me when I couldn't find a way out he made a way for me oh how he opened doors from me he shut doors for me because it wasn't good for me he was looking out for my good he was looking out for my betterment and he shut doors he closed things away he opened all the doors because he knew what was best for me I'm just a sheep in his pasture but he is the Good Shepherd this morning and he is here to meet your need he is here to set you free he's here to fill you with the Holy Ghost and Fire he's here to give you strength if you need strength this morning lift up your hands and begin to ask God for strength if you need presents lift up your hands and ask God for his presence this morning if you need Grace if you need favor if you need something from the Lord he had this morning to meet your need to set the captain Freer or he loves to shed the captain Freer he proves himself to be the Mighty God when he sets his people free oh can somebody give my God some praise this morning is he your God this morning oh I was he good to you this morning my eyes have seen the glory of the Lord how can we help but speak of the things that we have seen and of the things that we have heard oh Hallelujah fool to say that there is no God no no no when I step out my door on a morning with the prayer of the morning the Holy Spirit is going with me to make sure that the enemy doesn't entrap me doesn't enslare me my strength is not in Princess it's not a horse man but my strength my hope is in the Lord in his word I am hoping this morning I am reaching into his work this morning to find strength for tomorrow Monday morning is coming but God is already here he promised a whole my hand and take me here no Hallelujah all the way oh can somebody say man can somebody give him praise lift up your hand right now and just Praise Him and thank him oh Hallelujah Hallelujah oh glory amen just a little praise offering right okay so let's get into it so God calls us amen we see the purpose of God in our lives God calls us then we when we respond to the call of God in our lives God Saves us and he cleans us up he changes us trains us and then sets us out to go and do his work to go and fulfill his purpose so this morning it's kind of like a journey because you know we we we talk about coming to the Lord and coming into Christianity but what is adoption uh age is about really it's about God empowering his people so sooner or later you're gonna move from one level to another can we say Amen that's what it's about and that's what I think brother Branham always lamented at the Pentecostals didn't do they didn't come into their place see they had the gifts and they had the anointings and the presence and the singing and the atmosphere and so on but they never got into that place in Christ adoption coming into the word for their season and time so that it could fulfill their Duty or so that they can fulfill God's purpose or continue his work on the Earth because when God made man in the beginning he gave that man Dominion over the fowl of the air and over the fish of the sea and over every creeping thing that creeped upon the Earth that man was given dominion over that but that man fell from that state so God has always been longing and we say it but I hope it falls fresh upon you this morning that God has always been longing to get a people that will come back to that kind of a condition where they have dominion where they have authority where they can do as the father does when God placed that man in the garden in the beginning he turned his back he turned his back because it showed a confidence that God had in what he had created that man for that man knew who he was and that man knew who God was he was in Authority but he was also under Authority oh Hallelujah and he was aware of it and he was conscious of it and not only that he had the spirit and the likeness of God isn't that right because God said let us make man in our image and after our likeness and let that man have dominion so that man was in God's spirit and in God's likeness therefore God could have confidence in that man's ability to rule in that man's ability to lead in that man's ability to speak he had confidence in that man's work because of the work of the Craftsman is always a reflection of the Craftsman himself oh hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right oh the sea that is Reap is a reflection under seed that was planted in the beginning so God had to have the right man on the earth in order for things to work right and you have to be right in order for things to work right God wants to fix you from what you was to what he wants you to be so that you could come out right can somebody say Amen because if you're not right are you gonna help others to be right if you are misaligned are you gonna help align others if you are misconstrued how are you gonna help pull others up if you are torn up and messed up are you gonna help other people who are torn and messed up you gotta be fixed first God Gotta Straighten you out first God's Gonna fix your life first then you can be a positive influence to other people and other things because that's what the adoption is all about it's about growing you up from a babe in Christ into an adult in Christ can we say Amen oh Hallelujah so we have to make this transition transition we have to make it's a journey we have to be it's not an overnight transition process it takes time one thing I learned is that perfection takes time if you're aiming for perfection takes time you gotta blend it I love that blending tixture isn't that right I was talking to her just up your alley by the punch our Auto Body Works again you know he's talking about how you know if you have to paint something sometimes you have to blend in the paint make it work but that takes time you can't sit and wait for it gotta leave the car and then work on it then when you come back you see the work is done and you say wow that's amazing it looks good I mean you don't know it stress and the effort that took and the process that that took you weren't pretty to all of that but you see the result in the end and you thank God for it and you're willing to even pay for it because it's something of value somebody gave their time their effort their sacrifice and there's a value for that Exchange of effort and labor and sacrifice some people don't like to value those things sometimes experience is a value isn't that I think there was a story one time but a guy was building a ship oh sorry the ship had broken down I think my eyes like my knew this story and uh the ship had broken down and they didn't know how to fix the ship so they asked the best people and so on and they couldn't find anybody to fix a ship so there was somebody just on the shore somewhere that they knew was a specialist or something in this ship thing so they called him in something wrong with the ship we don't know how to fix it he called me look around the ship you walk around walk around so what the problem was took a little hammer or something hit it pow pow [Music] ship stop you know and uh they asked him wow that's that's brilliant thanks so much you know you saved us so much time as well how much is that gonna cost really charge them a pretty loud sum of money and I think the story goes to the point that what they were paying for wasn't for the hammer they were not pay in for the fact that he hit uh something with the hammer but they were paying for the fact that he hit the right spot they were paying for the fact that he knew where to hit to get it to work and knowing where to hit took years of experience that they were not privy to when he was down in the trenches getting dirty like a grease monkey dung in there with his overalls learning the ship they weren't around for that they weren't around for when he was sacrificed and spent the hours trying to fix things and learning water wrenches and learning where the oil was and learning how the things work they went around for all of that and there's a value that comes with that oh Hallelujah there's a value that comes with experiences and God wants to take you through experiences in your Christian Journey because there is a value to that there's a value in your everyday up one day town the next sometimes you don't know what's going on sometimes you feel like your prayers not been answered sometimes you feel like your prayer just hit in a wall and the Accord watching you just in your faith testing your faith see if you really want to be a Christian you really want to be a Christian leave you in a better sickness lose your job lose your house lose your car do you still want to be a Christian or Hallelujah better sickness took this from you took that from you oh Hollow that's not right do you still want to be a Christian you gotta answer it from your heart you can't answer that from your wallet you can't answer that from your material possessions you gotta answer you're gonna keep God an answer cut up your lines and answer me like a man where was thou when I lay the foundations of the Earth when the morning star sign together and when the sons of God shouted for Joy do you know who you are this morning oh your name is in the Lamb's Book of Life it cannot be raised God took his own blood and wrote your name in it and no devil could take it up this morning I don't care how many demon powers 200 million demons cannot stop you this morning from being delivered from being filled with the holy ghost from being set free the Good Shepherd is here this morning to get his sheep he gonna get his sheep somebody giving praise thank God you are his sheep this morning you are the Sheep of his pasture oh Hallelujah Hallelujah so we make a transition [Applause] move from being saved thank the Lord I'm saved his grace Jacob Grace move into Joseph perfection cap store the fault line we come into that that kind of elevation it takes God to do that promotion doesn't come from the East promotion doesn't come from the West comes from above comes from God will raise you doesn't matter what man sees men are imperfect they miss a lot of things you know and God help us you know we're not good we need God as much as the next guy but God doesn't miss a Beat foreign he knows every tear that came out your eye knows every pain that you went through knows the time when you was alone he knows when people forgot about you he knows about all of it this morning knows about the pain of your existence [Applause] he knows about how lonely you feel sometimes I've forgotten you feel sometimes he's behind all of that because he wants to bring something out of you he wants you to learn how to trust him and in order to trust him a lot of the things that you call valuable he has to take it away from you a lot of the things you build your kingdom upon he has to crack it up break it up Bust It Up remove it sometimes it's forceful but it's necessary for growth [Applause] if you have no more props holding you up it's necessary for growth God removes it hindrances in your life they're nice things they might be good things you know legitimate things but God is seeing a bigger picture place he wants you to be at sometimes those things will hold you back because where your heart is that's where your treasure will be I'm smiling because the word is just unfoldings when I have nothing that's written foreign there was a story I think a preacher gave one time I think I told the dinosaur but you get one time that he had a tree on the front yard a nice little young tree was coming up nicely but it come to a point where the tree was just kind of weak and no no not performing us he would have hoped not a strong and see what I've hoped so he called a landscaper guy I guess you know some one of those uh people who are really good in horticulture and he said come on take a look at my tree because it's not you know it doesn't look like how it looked in the picture how it's supposed to look and as soon as the horticulturist took one look at it he said you got too many props on this tree man you got stuff wire you know like sometimes they put four Stokes and then they tie a string on it and they hold another bark of it they did this the stem of it so this tree has too much supports he said you have you have to remove it he said right now you baby anything man the thing is got potential what's your baby anything remove the supports he said let the wind blow on it a little bit let's let rain fall a little bit let it get some hot sun a little bit oh Hallelujah little bugs come and take some leaves that's all right all that's good for the tree because he learned how to grow the leaves back again he'll learn how to push his roots out more again because if he's gonna get higher then he's got to get deeper first if he's gonna get higher then he's got to get deeper deeper in the love of Jesus Oh Hallelujah Paul said I would at you be deeply rooted and grounded in the love of Jesus Christ because if you know that he loves you then you can come up a little bit and though the winds block contrary you're anchored in the love of God though things blow this way and that way you're anchored in the love of God though the Trials come though the storms come lord the devil may come and give you three wild attacks velocity eyes lust of the flesh pride of life though these things may happen look up for your Redemption joy and now you know upon which Foundation you are standing on you are standing on the love of God oh Hallelujah Paul said what can separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus no Heights come on now no depth oh Hallelujah no tire no Peril no persecution oh I need somebody to help me this morning oh Hallelujah wow so it's a journey it's mountains and there's valleys no we need the valleys just as much as we need the mountains and God likes to give us mountains because that's good you know you need a you need us you need you need victory in your life it helps boost morale you know it helps boost your confidence you know you have a testimony that you can stand on it becomes an anchor point for you you know that God can you can rest on and say I was on the mountain once and even though I'm in the Valley now there's another mountain to climb and I can't wait to get on the top of that mountain because that mountain was even taller than the last oh and but nothing good comes without a fight oh so I'm willing to fight because I've tasted victory once and I know that a God that was with me then is a god that is with me now the mountains help prove the testimony of God in our lives that he is faithful to perform his promises and if he was faithful to put food on your table if he was faithful to give you a home or to take care of your children if he was faithful to come through for you before I know he can do it again because he is a god that is faithful to his promise faithful to his word he loves you this morning oh whatever you have prayed for keep on praying God will answer don't you worry he knows your every need he knows what you have need of and he is here this morning to provide for your every need according to his riches and Glory oh hallelujah hallelujah Oh Glory to God amen do you love the Lord this morning amen that's taking my time now just uh trying to get this word over to you man I have wow had I had 19 Pages this morning but you know we just healed a lot to do here man all right so we have to move from from being saved to doing God's work we have to move from being followers of Christ to Leading the People to Christ Jesus met Peter and them and so on he said from follow me I'll make you Fishers of me that's a little different from being a follower it's different from beautiful he asked him to follow him first no one can lead unless they're first willing to follow can't lead until your first go through the rough times that's why you gotta hang around people who've been through the rough times gotta hang a wrong folk who know how to change their spare tire it's one thing to read it in a book it's another thing to be on the highway in the night changing the tire that's different from being you know uh comfortable at home with a book on changing spare tires it's much different you can take control of your atmosphere internet reading lamp on and your glasses how to change your time but when you're on the road and it starts to rain and the cars are whizzing by and it's getting a little dark you need to know where Espana is you need to know where where the tire is you need to know how to get access to that you need to know to undo the nuts first before you raise it the car up because if you raise the car up on you undo the nuts the title spin because there's no weight the whole entire I saw an experience right everybody had to learn everybody started somewhere I'm not ashamed to admit I was kind of a dance excuse the expression amen but we live and you learn amen mine I don't know how to do that see there's so many experiences like that you know they can't base new experience new things in life on your sometimes your old experiences you have to learn new things to encounter those things that you're going to meet up you know people have a way of like to copy paste their experiences like well I know about this so I'll do that I know how to do that so I'll do that um does it work like that every day you learn something new it's different it's a new challenge and as God escalates you as God builds you up into your Christian journey in your life you're gonna always encounter new things everything we know today because of something that someone taught us isn't that right body of science that they call science is something that has been accumulated knowledge over a period of years isn't that right over a period of time is when they're looking at icebergs and slopes and geography and stuff like that all of that is a collection of data a collection of tests and research that have been done over time to show the progress of things or the degrading of things or whatever you can only see that over time and that's how God likes to do us he likes to stretch us out over time to see what we're really made of it's one thing to say In the Heat of the Moment I'll Follow You Lord I love you Lord I'll do your works and your Commandments but blessed is he that actually keep it my Commandments he it is that loveth me many people seen with their mouths but they're not actually doing it and then there are people who may not even say it but they're doing it and God will bless them for what they have done these are great in the Kingdom isn't that right oh Hallelujah so we must keep going to it all right so Christ so we must move to Leading the People to Christ God is looking for true Shepherds he believed that this morning ones who are willing to go into the fiery fullness if they have to as he said on God called man isn't that right I've appointed people to Christ God call man point the people to Christ point the people back to the faith that was once delivered unto the Saints that's what the adoption is all about it's not right the adopted son must first learn to have power over himself before he can have power over others and other things and if you cannot have power over yourself then you become a tyrant isn't that right power without character is satanic it's not fair to rule it's not right if you can have power over yourself then you can be Faithfully much amen no he's faithful and little we'll be faithful in much [Applause] so one must follow before he can leave isn't that right you can't lead anyone until you yourself know who you are and who is leading you okay dealership is about who you are as an individual because what you do your actions you take the decisions you make every day is a reflection of who you really are the actions you take the decisions you make the choices you take every day shows who you are truly as an individual doesn't matter what you say with your mouth but as if you could back that up with your with your works that do truly follow to show that you have faith in God and that you truly believe because faded out works is dead so you can't say you have faith and then who knows your car and then a corner you're afraid to trust God you're afraid to pray you're afraid to ah do the right thing even when nobody is watching that's not faith faith is when you believe you as an individual are willing to step out regardless of the circumstance regardless of what you are faced with you as an individual see something see something a vision that is greater than you and it does something in your heart it lifts you up and inspires you into action it inspires you into a movement it inspires you to do something for the Lord and as you become inspired you inspire others by your actions and by your words if you could be inspired this morning if we could have inspired fathers then we could have inspired mothers and if we could have inspired mothers we love inspired children and if we have inspired children we love inspired households then when you come into the house of God it's a whole bunch of inspired people coming to meet the Lord coming with fridge to move mountains come in with feet to know that God is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him oh it starts with you stops with us it starts with us as individuals in our homes in our lives in our workplaces how we treat people how we respect people how we forgive people how we put away gossiping back biting evils amazing it starts with you and then you bring the Revival [Music] the onus is on you somebody say man Hallelujah Lori the car adults in Christ adults in Christ that's what God wants [Applause] not this baby stuff Paul said when I was a child I taught as a child I understood as a child when I became a man put away childish things Jesus told Simon Peter he said when they're young you're good yourself on your own you go where you want and do what you want but when you get older someone will gird you they will carry you to a place where you don't want to go you have to be willing this morning to be leadable for God to be able to lead you the Bible said he leaded me beside the Still Waters He restored my soul he leaded me in the paths of righteousness for his namesake oh Holly but yeah sometimes I walk through the valley of the shadow of death but even there he is with me oh hallelujah hallelujah I wrote a nice half they Comfort Me Now pass a table for me in the presence of mine enemies people who don't like me but Jesus loved me it don't matter what they think it don't matter how they feel do good to them that use you and despitefully criticize you for on their part these evil spoken of but on your past he is glorified oh what shall we say to these things if God before us who can be against us this morning God is for you this morning God knows your every need and he can and he will save you help you restore you or strengthen to you Hallelujah you will if he doesn't do it and he's not gone because his word says he gives Beauty for Ashes is what it says he gives strength for fear his word says weeping endures but for a night but joy cometh in the morning you know what Joy is joy is when you're smiling in the middle of the madness Joy is when you could crack a smile when the whole wall coming down Joy is when you could be happy coming into the house of God this morning and you may not have a scent in your pocket but the God that was with you on the mountain is the same God in the valley he doesn't change his goodness when he's on the ballot then when he's in the manono he's the same God and he will and he can help you or he'll deliver you he'll restore you he knows what's good for you [Applause] and he's looking out for your good so don't get all nervous and frustrated but we do that sometimes though I do I do it get all nervous especially as the responsibility of father and so on you feel that weight on you that your decisions could destroy things It Could Make It or Break It but I love what David used to do Bible said he he said he would inquire again that's amazing remember this one time David one day they wanted to help us City out because they were out of the outskirts of Israel I think the kingdom domain and there was a city that was under siege and so on and they were considering whether to go and help the city so David said I will inquire the Lord see what he will want us to do he went and inquired God told him go you have my blessing so David came up to the men he said well God told us we could go to the city the men were perplexed because they were like are you sure we could go I mean are you sure this is what we should do because right now we're off the radar if we go and do this thing we will end up back on your radar you know so you sure you want us to go and do this because I mean I get the people who need help but but we under pressure too right now we're in hiding you sure this is what God wants us to do David said I understand I understand your concerns and the Bible said he went and inquired again unto the Lord to find out what they should do concern in this matter he had inquired already but I love how he wanted to inquire again ask of God again and God told him you are my blessing go right ahead and you know what that did it was a real lesson in humility because David as a leader he could have said go tell me to go you're telling me why is He Man In Charge here you owe me go talk to me tell me there we go without a problem no no he said no he humbled himself because he realized that man had concerns and even though he had prayed on his behalf when he inquired again he was preying on their behalf see what the Lord will say to see if there is a Good Shepherd behavior isn't that right to see if God really was had his mind on this matter if this was what God's leading was on this matter in this situation and when God gave him the second answer it satisfy the man and that's what David wanted because David couldn't go and do this thing alone he needed a man to go up with him and if the men are faint of Hearts how can they prepare for the battle how can they have victory in the battle but because he inquired again now the men feel confident that if the Lord be with us then we shall be able to overcome the enemy because this is the Lord's will David knew and the man knew that this was the Lord's will and sometimes brother sister you have to do things not just in the interest of yourself but in the inches of the people that honor your charge that honor your influence the people that you have rulership over they have concerns my brother my sister inquire again inquire again go on ask God if this is his will concerning this situation ask again and make sure this is what God wants nothing wrong asking the Lord ask him again ask him that's it something wrong with that if it's the same answer and God will uh confirm it but wait for his confirmation before you ride out into the sunset going off on your own mission having not yet sought Goods advice counsel some people don't even do it for themselves how much much far less for other people they have not considered in the equation of things because all affections or our our choices don't just affect us they affect other people you don't talk about second and third consequence and so forth to a choice later down the road something you don't see that far along you may not think that far along that something like that could happen but it does the fruits you eat today are the trees that were planted 20 years ago now plant a tree today because you don't know what fruits it will bear it may not be for you but it would be for somebody else it's not all for our prayer today give a sacrifice today do something today for the Lord and see if he don't reward you you don't if you don't reward your family your children there's much to benefit when we work for the Lord oh any work for ourselves we get our own reward women work for God he rewards us according to his riches and he is very rich in Mercy hallelujah oh Hallelujah he can bless you naturally bless you spiritually bless you in ways that you are not even prepared for David said my cup runneth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever and ever amen and amen are you enjoying him today well this is a this is a house of God's bread amen please we thank God to be here to hear his word you cannot lead it so you cannot lead yourself unless you know who you are who's leading you that's why Paul said follow me as I follow Christ he was he knew he was conscious and he is in a position of leadership but he also knew that he was under Authority that he had to answer to somebody that's accountability there so he told the people if you want to follow me that's fine but make sure it's within the brackets or it's within the context of how I follow Christ isn't that right make sure I'm on that page because if I ever get off that pitch run for your lives Run to the Hills run to these run through this but don't stay where I am because I'll lead you wrong I lead it the way I think another way God says it's two different things because the way there's a way that seemed right onto a man but the end thereof is dead a lot of things look right a lot of things seem right in our own eyes but I asked this morning have you inquired again to find out if this is really what the Lord wants you to do because if you haven't you might find yourself going two degrees north and it won't be long until you find yourself lost somewhere and then you'll have to come all the way back where you was and pick up God where you left him because he doesn't leave us we leave him can we say Amen you have to go back all the way and make all our treks all the things they lay down yeah all the things they said in your fixation you have to go and fix it all enthusia said did all that damage you caused to go back now fix it so one thing I learned in my job in graphic design is that if you do it once right you don't have to do it again ever like it's finished do it right the first time and they don't ever have to go back and take that up again matter of fact when you go back and you look at it you'll be so pleased be like that was some good work that is some good stuff because it was done right oh Hallelujah and God wants your life to come out right he wants to spend time on you this morning or to beat out the dross beat out the impurities beat out the things that are not of him beat out the contrary desires beat out the strange Gods from among you so that you could be clean and holy and presented blameless before him in love that's the purpose of the Gospel not for ourselves but to serve the people to help them to lift them up higher to let them realize that there is a God out there somewhere who loves them and wants what's best for them oh Hallelujah Jesus said the son of man came not to be ministered to to minister to others okay let me read something here it's about the atmosphere you create that's what it is I'm talking about leadership you mentioned you notice I talk about leadership a lot and that's because I believe in this message here true Shepherds and how God showed it to me was that when God always talks about leadership he always brings it within the context of a Shepherd caring for his flock okay so I hope that connects the dots this morning for you and I keep talking about this leadership thing but really what it is it's God's idea of how he takes care of us and how he expects us to take care of others because that's what adoption is about God's Gonna Elevate you to opposition where you are in charge of many things and you have to be able to account for that you have to be able to have God's spirit God's will God's character God's Behavior to know how to treat with the things that come your way the challenges are coming the situations that comes your way and that comes at a certain level of maturity comes at a level of understanding that it's not about you but it's actually all about you at the same time it's not about you it's not about what you know what great thing you can do God is great you're here to elevate God but then it's all about how you can surrender it's all about how you can let go it's all about how you can trust in the Lord trust in his power trust in his promises it's all about how you can be a better parent how you can be a better father mother how you can be a better son a better daughter because the truth is all of us are leaders all of us are influencers in some way and more we go up in life is a more people and lives and and and things that we are going to have influence over in the question will now rest upon Who You Are as an individual because who you are will reflect in the things that you do in a way that you treat with the decisions and the challenges that he and his wisdom put in your way to see what you're made out of and it always exposes the weakness it's not right that's what testing is about when they build I think when they're doing house electricals I think uh heard this before only working on house electricals they have to test the electricals let's see if it works turn the switch on and see if it actually comes on inspect it make sure it passes because if they run a wire and then they turn the switch and nothing happens then wrong one something went wrong Somebody went wrong something went wrong somewhere because it's supposed to work and in order to test the system to see if it works God has to test the system in order to see through it today yeah you must receive it works it has to be tested praise God and you can't just come true life like you know praise God just as God as as brother Branham said take you to one end of a pipe and then pull you through to the other end and then say blessed is he that overcome it you did nothing you just got pulled through with a rope that's not how it works no no no as long as you have breath in this body you are going to be tested you are going to be tried you are going to be proven to be the right kind of a son to be the right kind of a daughter to be the right kind of an individual that God could be pleased about because God wants to say oh here is my beloved Son in who I'm well pleased hear ye him yeah he is my daughter in whom I'm well pleased here's my servant in whom I'm well pleased God wants to speak this over you he's longing to do it bring you out to a ceremony somewhere adoption place you in there he wants to do that but you've got to come through the process so God is just he's like the father from The Prodigal Son he's looking out for you to come into the fold and with every step you take you're getting closer to the goal closer to home he wants to pronounce it over he wants to give it his robe he wants to give you his ring he wants to kill the fatted calf and all that but you've got to come in for him to give it to you you can't get it over there you have to walk towards the kingdom keep walking towards the gore keep walking towards a victory how do you do it when you pray every day how do you do it when you praise God how do you do it when you wake up this morning and put your clothes on and said I'm going to the house of the Lord doesn't matter how I feel doesn't matter what's going on the holy spirit is watching your attitude and he is pleased when you walk in here despite the challenges that the Holy Spirit tutor knows you have every day you still choose to walk in here and God will give you the victory today he'll give you the victory tomorrow just keep having a right attitude and God will bless you this morning somebody give him a shot of praise oh my [Applause] God oh my time is going but uh I always get a few things in here and then let's wrap up amen so praise the Lord you're feeling fine all right leadership is about the atmosphere you create I want to read this quote here from the prophet I love this expectation 1954. he said see you are a Creator in yourself he said if you he said uh how many born again again how many is born again say Amen congregation says amen he said do you know each one of you as a Creator you are a part of God you're a Son of God an offspring of God a daughter of God is that right he said then you're a creator he said now did you ever see people they were nice people I ain't saying this for anybody now he said but nice people but but you just couldn't hardly stand to be around him you know that he said they're nice people he said but it's their atmosphere they're in he said now then you've seen other people that you just long to be with them is that right he said it's that atmosphere that's around them all the time he said no my wife sat back here she didn't know this but she's supposed to be here somewhere and you can imagine in our home about what's take place in a run of a day people coming in going out like that Senator the prophet said I go in sometimes oh and the poor little fellow is in there in the kitchen crying talking about his wife not even a chance to cook the children anything to eat you today to the day and there it is and a little kitty little girl about two years old Sarah and Rebecca and then there they're crying and going on and my wife she's crying she's in the kitchen she'd look up and she'd say oh bill I'm just about to go crazy I don't know what I'm gonna do this is what dizzy atmosphere he means right right is that it she said I she said I I'm gray-headed at 34 years old and so I said well I said no that's that's right honey and the prophet said I never don't fuss at her see no no that that's right honey see he answers it's very bad but you see it's very bad so this is he's telling his wife now it's very bad but you see we're serving the lord you know so we we we sort of we're serving the lord and he says he said see what I'm doing in my heart all the time when I'm all uh I'm doing all the time in my heart I'm trying to create a different atmosphere they're all nervous they're tore up see now I was thinking in my heart he said oh Lord now this is in his heart now he's not saying this audibly he's in his heart he's saying oh Lord now send your presence and your love to my poor little tour of life and I say Yes dear now he's talking to his mouth he said yes there yes there that's right I said oh I said what's this here his wife says oh we haven't got anything to eat I say well there probably won't be anybody else for probably next couple of hours to visit the house she said well let's get something to eat and I'll help you he said and I'll start getting up my sleeves he said I start getting up my sleeves rolling them up and she'd say now look here young man you might be able to help me wash dishes but you can't cook and I'll say who can't cook he said like that you know I said what's going on you know he said what you haven't seen my fried potatoes yet I was raised on them you know like that like something like that you know he said I'll see this little itty bitty smile trickle on one side he said you know is it the first thing you know I come over I put my hand on her she don't know what I'm doing yet and I say bless your heart honey I'll tell you what I'll I'll help you with this and then down in my heart I'm saying Lord send your peace send your peace that is in me amen send your peace that is in me into her now oh God quiet my family now I am your servant father send your peace and so and then the next thing you know she'd say Bill you know a certain thing and then them all black eyes are snapping again you know he said you know oh yeah he said I said yeah he said oh I said and I looked at the baby she's in there she's got her blocks and the babies are playing together what is it it's created an atmosphere oh hallelujah hallelujah kind answer turn it away around oh Hallelujah God given his Prophet wisdom how to deal with daily situations everybody's all nervous and frustrated but if you are a leader you can't get all nervous and frustrator too it doesn't help we need somebody to hold the reins to be level-headed to be in the spirit to be in the atmosphere because if you flying off the island everywhere they handle every final battle everything will sell the handle that makes no sense there'll be more wreckage so what God wants is for someone to be in the spirit because he can't use you if you're not in the spirit and once you're in the spirits now you can be used of God to create something new to create a new atmosphere isn't that right or to do something different I can't answer turn away around you use wisdom in your situation you use knowledge oh the prophet said knowing what is in the brother's heart going the extra mile with them having Temperance with them having brotherly kindness with them having godliness with them having knowledge oh Hallelujah that's why we have to have these things that's why it's imperative we have these things because it's these virtues these spiritual virtues that's gonna help us to deal with the challenges as they come and more and more what we ought to see is more of God in our lives it's more positive change Hallelujah because you can create an atmosphere you can create an atmosphere this morning doesn't matter what doubt is in your mind if you lift your hand up this morning and you choose to have the right attitude and surrender God can bless you this morning more than you are prepared to be blessed oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh God could do something for you God can change the situation that you left this morning when you come back to it it'll be a whole different situation just because of the attitude that you had Right In This Moment oh somebody help me Praise Him Hallelujah I'm here to create an atmosphere I'm here to prayer I'm here to praise I'm here to give him all the glory I'm here to give him all the honor because he's worthy of this he brought me through a mighty long way it would be remiss of me not to give God praise is for the blessings that I didn't deserve or he'll raise me up oh so that I could stand on mountains he raised me up above stormy seas I am stronger when I'm upon his shoulder because he is my Jesus I am his son he is my father oh and he loved me and he the Good Shepherd is looking for his sheep he's looking for you this morning he's looking for his predestinated ones he's elected once who he found you from since the beginning he's gonna find you he's gonna bring you back into the fall can we say Amen this morning oh my my God okay so I think I got that over wonderful support said follow me as I follow Christ he sets a condition he knew he was a leader he held a leadership position but deeper than that he charges the people to see to to watch his walk and to follow as he follows Christ isn't that right I am Divine here the branches the branches cannot bear fruit of itself so our job is really between this source of life and the fruit that's supposed to come out on the end our role and function as a bride of Christ is to be connected to that vine so that we can bring forth the fruit at the top of the tree that's our rule if we save ourselves I am a Vine I'll do it myself it won't work because you're not a Vine you're a branch you are not the Holy Spirit the holy is he the holy spirit will come upon you and take the word that is in you and bring it to life the spirit is the life Giver to the word you Just Surrender yourself and he the Holy Spirit Will Mount Your Hallelujah you the word and write you oh Olive isn't that right oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah write you to your destination it's nine so we have to understand what our role is what our function is because when we mess that picture up that's when on the strange Revelations that are coming out some people think they're fruit some people think they're Vine some people think they're both some people are trying to do it all one band Charlie you know and that's not your role and function it's like Prophet said you know you God call it raise corn but you watching someone else's barley or someone else's wheat and you're jealous for that because wheat is nice I like wheat let's try wheat let's do that no God didn't raise you up for that he gave you corn stay with what he gave you oh and God will bless you bless you oh hello this other man's supposed to rain sweet let him raise his weak leave the man alone God is inspiring him to do that every church is Sovereign under god oh Hallelujah we don't have to answer praise God to any other church or any other group we answer to the Holy Spirit whatever the past is inspired to do that he does only the inspiration of the Holy Spirit oh and God will show us where to go where to put our foot what to say how to do how to say it or and if it's truly God he'll burn the candle on both ends and he will show that he is the one who is coordinating it all together oh it's a holy spirit that was sent to lead the church not man sent to lead a church but the holy spirit is what God gave to lead the church in the end time the Holy Spirit Joshua the holy spirit is God and time leader in the church to lead you to your top channel to lead you to your Perfection to lead you to possess your individual inheritance to lead you to possess what you know is your own because we know this morning that there is much more land to be possessed there is much more miracles in store greater things are yet to come greater things are still to be done in Trinidad and Tobago they haven't seen the bride yet but here comes the bride she's marching she's marching on towards Holiness marching on towards Purity marching on towards adoption marching on towards Perfection God has called us church for glorious wonderful baptism of the Holy Spirit God has called you Church to a mighty Revival where the sick will be healed when the plan will see where the will walk with a gospel we preacherous somebody give us out whoa God is calling you this morning get me up let's get on fire let's get the prison let's get to worshiping let's pray without ceasing pray without season pray without season pray without cease in until every one of these virtues are living in us that we're gonna have a seven seal seven tunnel refiler as restored by malachite 4. [Music] oh [Music] him do you believe it that's what they raised up for so all of this is not bringing us into maturity so that we can handle that because a lot of people like to talk about power really sick where is he dead good exact man boy speak the word flashlight yeah yeah somewhere good they're real cool I want to be that I want to be back man I want to be Superman that's not it that's not it at all these things aren't toys that you just play with you don't give a child a knife you cut themselves don't get them a sword you don't know how to handle it yet I've been experience in battle sometimes little children they give them wooden swords yeah let them jump just a little bit get used to it sometimes the king Joseph's Sons little wooden swords they're playing with sometimes you feel like you're winning and then you can do so hit the money girl and you realize still have plenty to learn pick him up he said don't worry dragon and the leaders are showing I'm showing him giving him a little Victory let him feel good give him something All Eyes jumps in all that is training well as getting used to the real thing you're not ready for the shop sword yet just give you something wooden to just learn how to do it the real thing come in the real test coming I remember talking about training amen for the battle that is the other head you need training first you can't run into this battle and you don't know what to do most I could give you is a messenger boy post carry messages across the battlefield and even with that you still need another run you need to know what a land might look like because you can run on top of one on bow end of messenger next so everything needs training you can't just run into something I know what it is terrible attitude you get blown up see afternoon you have to be familiar with the original dollar the genuine article so that if the fake thing comes by you can do it you pick it up one time say something wrong with that pass it to the UV light dismissing something we can't accept this because I know what the genuine thing is and we got to be trained by the Holy Spirit to know what the holy spirit is what the Holy Spirit wants because even the Holy Spirit himself subjects himself to the word the Holy Spirit only recognizes the word he can't recognize Creeds he can't recognize dogmas he can't recognize Ben's ideas men's opinions he can only recognize the word when you obey the word and you do all that he asks you to do then comes his Spirit to confirm the word and make it alive oh Hallelujah Hallelujah and then when that happens we'll see him moving In and Out Among Us confirming his word confirming the thing he said praise God confirming the king's decree isn't that right amen that's what the spirit is here to do it's not right so the problem we have today is that people pay the attention and they respect so much to the words of men that the word of God gets lost to the people the leaders today are pointing the people to themselves not to God and that's what God points out here in the scripture Ezekiel Ezekiel 34. that we read the leaders are pointing the people to themselves they have their own agenda and I kind of label them as tyrants you know uh the prophet said there's too many voices it comes harder to hear the voice of God it's not right that's right there was a book written called the prince by a guy called Nicolo Machiavelli uh some may know of it who studied early Advanced literature and stuff like that political science would this book have some stuff in it that's really deceptive it's really narcissistic it's really self-centered it's actually it's kind of a poisonous text to be honest and a lot of the ideas that are in the book I think this book was published an idea 1500 and something oh but it amazed me because I was studying the life of different tyrants in history because I was going into this subject really deeply and I don't think I could get all of it today but I prayed a lot of bless you somehow amen by what we've been able to share here this morning but I went into kind of this study of tyranny and tyrants and to see how throughout the ages these rulers and these overloads throughout the history have wrecked and caused damage and harm to the lives of innocent people who themselves were in a vulnerable place you know so a lot of times there are poor economic situations in a country and this is becomes like a petri dish a petri dish for tyrants to begin to move inside of that because the spirit so it's an anointing that comes upon them that makes them behave and act in a way and when it's just like you want to see what's in a man give him power see what's inside of him give him power give him money give him something that that empowers him that gives him the ability to do things and watch what he does with it his choices after a while are going to expose who he is not right that's like when Samuel uh and I was hoping to get it but we'll touch on it maybe I won't get it we'll touch it now Samuel when he uh was in order to came to him told him said we don't have any confidence in your ministry anymore because your son's not walking your way so we want a king Samuel was on the word but they judged him based on what his sons were doing you see but he was on the word see but they wanted a king they said we reject your leadership we want a king make us a king and Samuel is disturbed by the same by their request why would they desire this why would they want this when he went to the Lord God told him he said you they haven't rejected you after all and he went back and he caught Egypt he said after all I did for them I brought them out of Egypt brought them out of the Honda host of bondage I brought them out from a tyrant out from a pharaoh who knew not Joseph who was not acquainted with my ways and my principles a tyrant rose up among them and burdened them with sorrows and beat them mercilessly and made them make bricks without straw after I brought them up out of that entire land of their own possession into their own way they now want another time God was God was always like what you know but he said you know what if they want if that's what they want tell them everyone but they hear what God tell them he said let them know what will happen if you ask for a king I want to read it I I know time is going but I want to get to get through all right first time I'll eat let me just run real quick if you want to pick it up too that's fine um you don't have to but I'll read it all amen just to you and um uh yeah so okay Samuel warns Israel this is boosted right I love this Bible that's good because they mark this off okay verse 10 I said and Samuel told all the words of the Lord unto the people that asked of him a king and he said this will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you actually give them a Manifesto you know he said he will take your sons and appoint them for himself for his chariots and to his Horsemen and to some shall run before his chariots and he will appoint him captains over thousands and captains over 50s and will set them to air his ground and to reap his Harvest notice all about him there's a lot about him going on not about God see he said and to make his instruments of war and instruments of his chariots he will take your daughters to be confectionaries sweetie makers and to be cooks and to be Bakers and he will take your fields and your Vineyards and your oilier Olive yards and even the best of them and give them to his servants and he will take the tent of your seed and of your Vineyards and give to his officers and to his servants and he will take your immense servants and your maid servants and your goodliest young men and your asses and so forth and put them to his work this is this is cool like I wish somebody could tell me this you know like before you leave home on on Junction by the gas station just wait there 15 minutes because something real bad gonna happen and if you wait after that you'll be good like it's cool like you don't even have to leave home now you can wait 15 minutes and then leave home like this is what that is you actually get a warning you get a forewarning you get you know a heads up what is giving them a heads up God told of them he knows they reject him he no they don't want him anymore yet still in his grease and his most still giving them a heads up tell them no listen I know because they're one bottle you want annoy like spoil sharing or they'll want toys to play with you're one thing you want yeah you're spoil you have your own way they have a lot of people who grew up who didn't know about the Wilderness so they come out into this and they don't know how this came they don't know how this got here this came here to pain to blood to sacrifice to endless torments to to strudging to the Wilderness people died people came through some people have to overcome I was with Joshua gave them victory over the camps victory over your Malachi pick you over here parasites this what you see in front of you all of this came out of pain and sorrow but you turn that down right so I'm gonna tell you what's gonna happen if you do this oh the goodness of God Amen and yet still see he said uh let me read this out quickly and he said I shall cry out today you and you shall cry out in that day because of your king which you have you shall have chosen of you and the Lord will not hear you in that day nevertheless the people refuse the voice of Samia and they said nay but we will have a king over us my people like it so amen they want their own way you see so God is longing for our people in the land would want his desire who would want God's desire over us we don't need a king if the prophet said the holy spirit is supposed to be in charge of the church then that is the administration that we want we want that praise and nobody else won that we want that we want God to take a hold of the pastor God to take a hold of the ministers called to take a hold of the deacons the ushers we want everybody filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost we want a church on fire we want children who know how to pray how to find scriptures in the Old Testament we want children who know oh their foot from their hand praise when they come to church praise God we want to know brothers who know the tire tie and how to shine their shoes we want Libra sisters who know how to to wear their hair properly and wear the right type of clothing and be an example we want people who can lead others to Christ we want a Church on the Move a church with Jesus walking in it we want a church that God could look down and be proud of and say there is my spirits flowing freely we want the kind of people that would make Jesus proud We want the kind of people that would make the father proud We want to be the kind of people that even in the dark and cloudy day my confidence is in the hope of the Lord my strength is in you Lord my help is in you father I don't have any strength on my own we want the kind of people this morning who would surrender all that they have to the holy spirit so that they can be used by God if you could use anything this morning use me this morning take my hands take my feet touch my heart take my party my heart my mind my spirit does anybody want to be used this morning I can't hear you does anyone you want to be used this morning I want to be used by God somebody help me this morning oh I want to be helped oh I need help every day I need you oh I'm on my knees I need your help I need your strength I need your grace I need your favor I need your mercy I can't do it on my own I can't lead myself I need him to lead me then and only 10. can I lead others in the way [Applause] [Music] oh Hallelujah glory to God oh my [Applause] God I was making appointment with this book right the prince yeah so this book is written in 1500 and there's a guy named uh by the name of Francois duvalier somebody know him he's a Great Dictator in Haiti he was a really evil guy like really crazy today is still suffering under the severity of his leadership and of the seeds that he planted Haiti has now eaten food from that still eating food from that repercussions from the choices that he made as a leader and had affected entire country of people and uh please so soon and it said that he actually Drew inspiration from this very book the prince where he talked about you know being feared it's better to be fair than to be loved if you can't be both and he indoctrinated that into himself and practiced that and use violence and force just like um what we read and if you kill 34 ruling the people tyranny and the fist of iron yeah driving the machine of War yeah it's not right i'm subjecting the people to fear subjected people the condemnation subjecting the people to all sorts of manipulation and Powers man who ruled the rule of this world oh what comes up when you give a man power because as nature is corrupt is corrupt to begin with so all of the fantasies all of the lusts and the desires of Hearts men men's Hearts begin to rise to the surface anytime power comes into play but God wants a people that we are so blessed that when he blesses them they become more humble or because the only way up is down and the only way to heaven is on your knees oh cat on your knees and see how humble you can become and then God can raise you up and God could Elevate you learn to control yourself before you control others another thing seek ye first kingdom of God and then all the other things God will give to you he will give to you if you have your your your your motive right objective right how do you judge a man by the way he says it his word it's not to see what motive and objective he has if he's trying to draw people himself or is he trying to do something for the truly for the kingdom of God voice people watch how he treats this different different things and different ones then you'll see what a man's made of it's like that's and it stretches over time because it's good to come in church oh I love your brother yeah God bless you that's nice everybody in Church's nice everybody just dressed nice look nice but when the pressure hit when the bottom falls out of church now different thing see that's the real you yeah that's the one that goes to sleep at night that's the one that has to pray to the Lord and ask God for wisdom for tomorrow because you honestly don't know the way you know we try to kill ourselves and think we do the truth is really don't we try to plan for it but the Bible said take God to establish your plan you do you make a plan you've gone to establish that forget about it seek to find God's will for yourself for everything else seek the fine as well amen oh my God but it's so interesting to me that this book The Prince by Nicole Nicole Machiavelli was preserved for so much years and then this guy uh in the early 1900s picked up this book and and and was able to manifest the words that was written in that book and I told myself that if that man could read the words of a man and be anointed and inspired by that to do the works of a man then how much more is the Bible this morning an inspired book of words that we could pick up in 2023 it's been written years and thousands of years ago but it still holds true oh Hallelujah there's knowledge in here there's wisdom in here there's power in here oh there's key to God's presence in here there's keys to leadership he's the guidance keys to your life he's the how to deal with your husband how to deal with your wife how to deal with your family how to deal with your Affairs if we could only pick up the words in this book I think God is looking for people this morning who are inspired enough to pick up these ancient words ever true it did something for Joshua it'll do something for you this morning it did something for Paul he changed his name and puts all the poor God changed it all because of the words in this book oh because of the words of this life oh I did something for Peter it'll do something for you this morning oh he did something for the future of the ages oh Hallelujah [Music] we can pick these same words up these are not the words of a man this was not written with deceit this was not written in contempt this was not written with the objective to destroy or to manipulate this was not written to drive fear Into the Heart of people it's a driven to build their confidence to put a fear of God in them that they could begin to grow in God and learn God and understand God to put his love in them he is Godly fear not the fear of man fear of God hallelujah hallelujah it's written to give us guidance and instruction is written to give us wisdom and understanding and God knew that even in this age these words were still hold true heaven on Earth will pass away but my words will never pass away oh hallelujah hallelujah do you believe it amen amen so let me find out find a way to kind of wind down now and so on so this whole tyranny thing it's a rule of fear there's certain things that pop up in tyrannical ruler ships or regimes one is fear one is manipulation where leaders manipulate people they pit people against each other purposefully uh with an intention most of the times in their head they have a secret plan but they don't tell you the plan they tell you the part that you want to hear so that you can buy into the plan and then when they hook you it's already too late and you've joined the regime and a lot of things are happening that audio control look damage has already been done four Shepherds is that right who feed not the flock the desire is truly to feed themselves they might get the flock some make it look like this is all that there was but behind that is 90 percent they only give you 10. I said this is all their worries so while they say so I think I was uh uh Kim Kim Jong-il who's the son of Kim il-sung leader of North Korea who is the Eternal president mind you he's there a long time ago and they actually have this two-day ceremony in North Korea where everyone from all across the country coming to Pyongyang capital and they worship before him this eternal president they bring flowers we don't know about that because we live in a free country please praise the Lord but if you were born in North Korea you would know it is a day and a calendar or two days on a calendar where they come from all around the region round about to pay homage to this eternal president Kim il-sung who died how much of a years ago and they bring flowers and they have to bow and sit with me if you're bowing they all have to bow together if you don't do it end up in jail like is that serious and they put on wood between your legs like this and then they sit down on it the poppy knee capsule foreign going on it was really bad I think in the 90s or something like that and um you know he was going around the Village from places to places and he was visiting people and so forth this is how histories tells us and he was telling the people that you know he was in this long march and he was along this long journey and uh he was only eating from a sump of water and a handful of rice and he was coming to every village everywhere you know when he was visiting him telling them oh he'd use their troubles and he knows their sorrows and we're gonna fix everything and make it better history reports that he was one of the biggest buyers of Hennessy and lobster and find food a matter of fact they sent somebody to Italy to learn how to make pizza come back to make pizza for Kim Jong-un that's how crazy they get with power all right so just give an example here and here it is in the Bible God it gives them an account tells them this is what the king will do when he comes and they still wanted it because they didn't want God's benevolence didn't want God's grace they didn't appreciate God's favor they didn't understand it they didn't think things could get bad did and God allowed it to happen God said you choose our King then you will live with him until I'm ready to give you the king I wanted to give you all time but because you choose your own way you want your own stuff you want to learn your own lessons all right be okay you start off good Samuel anointed and so forth and everything looked like it was predestinated you start off good oh you deadly man it's great among the people it's tall handsome looking he was a nice looking fella he was not it wasn't terrible you know a nice guy nice behavior and so forth start off right see but over time his choices showed him up over time little things started to pop up until it come to the act of Disobedience where Samuel had to confront him on it and say that obedience president sacrifice I don't want the sacrifice I want your opinions do what I told you to do oh Hallelujah because of this you're fired thank you Samuel had to read out the riot back to him yes you know and um and anything there see then God spoke to Samia I told him go down to the house of Jesse Hallelujah and anoint one of my own to be king never told him who it was so I said you go down there and I'll give you a witness I'll tell you who it was now that's interesting because the day before when he went met anointed Saul um he God spoke to his Heir and told him who it was going to be so when Saul showed up he was like what's going on someone's like I have a program planned out for you man God has waiting for you all the time this time it was a mystery this time it was a secret even to Samuel Samuel didn't know who he was looking for nobody know what was going on this mystery mysterious leader oh was a little boy with a harp uh Halloween little goat skin he was unassuming because he was a Shepherd Shepherds don't wear fine linen they rest in good skins Shoppers aren't dressed in the best they don't have on Louis Vuitton and Gucci This Shepherd was barefooted the shepherd was smelling like sheep the shepherd was just doing his father's work this Shepherd is doing his best doing his best for the Lord singing his best for the Lord worshiping his breast for the Lord oh Hallelujah God love this little Shepherd boy God's love was upon him oh Hallelujah oh do you know who I'm talking about this morning do we have any Davids in the house today oh you was a mystery that was hidden God God hid you from everybody

anoint you God is gonna positionally place you David wasn't qualified but he was chosen oh Hallelujah all right [Applause] what's it qualifier but he was chosen chosen by God oh Hallelujah to do his work hasn't arrived amen oh my Hallelujah I just want to read it for scripture say okay okay all right I want to read a scripture here Isaiah 43 I love this scene he said but now thus say the Lord that recreated Theo Jacob this is one of my favorite scriptures discovered it about 10 years ago or something it still Rings true he said oh Jacob he that formed thee o Israel fear not for I have redeemed Thee I I call thee by thy name for thou art mine he said when they'll pass it through the waters I will be with thee or can we say amen and through the rivers they shall not overflow thee when thou walkests through the fire Thou shalt not be burnt neither shall the flame Kindle upon thee for I am the Lord thy God the Holy One of Israel My Savior I gave Egypt for thy Ransom Ethiopians since that was precious in my sight thou has been honorable and I have loved thee Oh this is how God sees you this morning lift up your hands and praise him oh and he said since I was precious in my

West I will say to the north give up unto the South keep not back bring my sons from far when God sends his career to deliver his sons and daughters there's not enough tables in hell that can keep you from being delivered there's not enough troubles in Hell nothing can keep you back tell them not give up tell the sword South surrender and give up the Son of God into my hands they are mine how can I forget Israel they are uncraved in the I'm in my hands that's how much God loves you this morning he can't forget about you he remembered his promises and he sent Deliverance oh he would send Deliverance to this morning he'll remember his promise he promised to fill you he remembered his promise this morning let your cry go up to him let your cry by reason of your afflictions go up to God you cry keep on crying this morning until brother Gideon says you get your final cry get to that last cry get to that final cry keep on crying keep on praying keep on calling upon God the true Shepherd the Good Shepherd who cared for the Sheep he's here to answer your cry and send his deliverance and break the back of the enemy he will crack the back of Lucifer he will break the chains off

Light into your spirits let there be light Supernatural lights created Power come inside of you and do something new inside of you burn out the lies pulling out the lust pulling out the desires lots for big things loss of popularity lots of money loss for great things these things are dead to the believer oh it must be tattooed this morning let the Holy Ghost on fire burn out the lost in your heart and make you a real born-again Christian oh Hallelujah so that your life to be influence to others that's what it's all about it's not just about being saved it's about how God could use us to inspire others to create this new world Kingdom of Heaven Jesus preached and talked about he's looking for people come and do it he said he was my father sent me even so send out you It's a Great Commission and as he has been sent he comes to commission others send them out what did Isaiah say here am I send me I want to be sent by God I want to be used by God whatever he has to do to me get

my daughters from the end of the Earth everyone that is called by my name for I have created him for my glory I have formed him yay I have made him amen amen all these scriptures talk about a Good Shepherd here now okay well we got through all that final please you know oh this is good amen right so okay ah God came to empower said that we could live and reflect God's leading isn't that right so that we may point the people to Christ that's the objective that's a rule and function of the true Shepherds there's a point the people to Jesus Christ not to themselves not to their own agendas not their own opinions in order to do that the man has to die and be dead dead too everything else but to what God wants and to what God desires I thank God this morning that we have I think we have great leaders Among Us in our church here and I certainly appreciate them Ministries put their shoulder to the wheel because we believe in something and we believe it together we're Believing on the Lord Jesus not church when she comes into our persecution they are Believing on the Lord Jesus the same holy spirit that was with them in the day of Pentecost he's the same Holy Spirit today that does the same things that if you believe on him and if you put your trust in his name that same Holy Spirit if you do the things that they did back there he'll give you the same Penny he'll give you the same prize he'll give you the same reward the same baptism same Holy Spirit one Lord One Faith because they are one sheep one sheep poor they will have one Shepherd one Lord one God one father who is a purpose or an in you all and through you all will fulfill all things according to his riches and mercy man Matthew 4 says from that time Jesus began to preach and say repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand and Jesus walking by the Sea of Galilee saw two Brethren Simon Peter and Andrew brother casting anything to the Sea for they were fishes and he said unto them follow me and I will make you Fishers of Men this is what God wants from us amen just a few scriptures just want to highlight God's desire for us he always kept echoing it and mentioning it in small ways to his disciples and they didn't understand it of course he knew he didn't understand it but he had to speak it over there so that when he come back and there's a in his ministry when he's raised with then he come back in Resurrection Ministry he echoed back to them the same things that he told them while he was yet with them in Galilee and Samaria and Jerusalem support isn't that right so that they became more real to them after they've gone through the crucifician experience watched him die watch him scream watch the Quran and give up the ghosts watch the sun black out watch the the temple run into watch the Earth shake oh praise God and the Holy and the Saints came up and appeared to many after all of that took place and they went hiding for about three days until he reappeared to them now these would became more real to them then but he was always telling them these things isn't that right and here it was this was after this ministry now this is after the resurrection he'll come back now uh Saint John 20. um and he said Jesus said to them peace be unto you as my father sent me even so send out you and when he had said this he breathed on them and he said unto them receive ye the Holy Ghost so I love it because he pronounces Holy Ghost upon him almost as a confirmation of what he has said before that as his father had sent him not the Holy Ghost is coming to empower you as sons of the Kingdom as Daughters of the Kingdom to be sent out as a witness that Jesus is Alive that he is the same yesterday today and forever he said receiving the Holy Ghost In other words the Holy Ghost will take care of this word even so send are you receive it a holy ghost receive ye power oh hallelu to form me into the word image so that you can be sent to do God's work he said whoever sends you remit you're remitted unto them and whosoever sins you retain our routine wow that's amazing they come into such a in other words they're going to come into such a level of the Christian work that they are gonna actually remit sins and retain it's not right he Echoes these things Luke 22 lord said to Simon Simon behold this is after you rebuke Simon totally get it behind me that he may sift you as wheat but I've prayed for thee amen that I Faith failed not what should he says here and he says and when thou art converted strengthen the brethren oh we've got a work to do amen and don't stop at the Holy Ghost oh it starts with the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is the guy that takes you that birth all the way up to adoption where you can now strengthen the Brethren praise God hallelujah do I have this tongues to speak with men and angels and have not charity I am nothing oh Hallelujah charity suffered long and is kind is not puffed up it's not evil if easily provoked or imperative spirit all things believe it all things hope it's all things we've got to get to charity friends charity never feel it the love of God that takes away the sins of the world he wants to pour that love into you so that you could love not only the ones that closer to you but you could love the unlovable you love those that hurt hurtfully use you and despisfully use your own persecute you said your father might be glorified amen oh man Saint John 21 this is the third time that Jesus showed himself to the disciples after that he was risen from the dead and so when they died with Jesus he sent it to Simon Peter Simon son of Jonas love it down me more than anything else other than these and he said unto him yeah Lord thou knows that I love thee and he said unto them feed my Lambs and he said unto him again the second time Simon son of Jonas love without me he said unto him yellow you don't know it that I loved him he said unto him feed my sheep God's uh introducing a burden to him until the time Simon son of Jonas love us thou mean Peter was grieved amen because God kept asking ask him probably nothing do you love me do you love me Peter do you love my word do you love my promises it's not right do you love what I've said but I have decreed do you love my ways do you love my Commandments do you love me all that I am and all that I represent do you love me do you love my kingdom will you die for it will you give your life for it will you preach for it will you stand for the truth for it this is what he was asking proven provenator Peter answers again he says he said Lord don't lose all things now knows that I love thee Jesus said unto him feed my sheep three times hmm God is very concerned this morning about his sheep and he wants he wants his men who are fit the prophet said God called man were trained in the Supernatural to handle God's word this bride will not be manhandled she has to be card handled and it takes god-called man to do that we're not here to fix anybody we just said to present a word to you and then the word does the job and in the world fixes the problems but Prophet said the word corrects the church hey amen amen is that right glory to God it does it every time amen you don't have to throw a book at them I get off frustrated amen let go to the world he will fix a broken heart he will bind it up their wounds he tell it the number of stars call it them by their names he knows your name this morning he knows who you are he knows your journey in life your journey may not be brother so until his journey your journey may not be success Journey your journey is your own Journey and your journey was meant to shape you a certain way to create a certain result Jesus got many trainings and on obedience he learned obedience and the things that he suffered the Bible said it took obedience to go on the cross it took obedience to pay the price his training was was tantamount to the to the thing that he had to face in the end he had to see not my Willow that will be done you have to come to that point his training was to prepare him for this and as an example son he did it though it was hard though it was painful and the Bible shows that it was sweat was as drops of blood he was intense he was filming in his prayer because he knew that he faced death itself but yet he said not my will but I will be done Young Brother young sister doesn't matter what you have to face as long as you face it with God you come out on the other side but make sure you face it with God don't face it alone you're not big enough for that you're not great enough for that you're not strong enough for that but oh Jesus if you would just hold my hand I know I'll be all right and I'll be okay oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah precious Lord and me on Lord let me stand oh Hallelujah if he's with you he'll give you the strength to stir both strengthen to you give you strength this time oh my my God time is far gone but uh I just want to finish up with a few things maybe musicians can get ready to start coming on uh very very listen to you when I was young how good is myself you tell Peter he said here walk us with her now with us but when thou shall be old thou shall stretch for thy hands on another shout gritty and carry thee without witness not amen and amen Matthew 20 Jesus calls to them and said you know the princess of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them now they are great exercise great Authority upon them so forth they that are great exercise great Authority he said but it shall not be so among you but whosoever will be great among you let him be your minister and whoever will be Chief among you let him be your servant God taught servanthood he did this over to him he washed their feet dried over the towel he presented himself as a flunky to them and he told him didn't you know what I have done for you he said a servant is no greater than his Lord if I have washed your feet then I expect the same of you that you wash one another's feet and therefore will you be my disciples when you have love one for another and if you want to love God love his children treat his children right in whatever context it doesn't matter wherever you go wherever you do whatever you say be the right kind of a son whether you're in church or whether you're standing in a trench with boots on and a shovel still be a Christian even if you're wearing the finest of clothing even if you're standing on a podium speaking of thousands of people be a Christian there be a Christian in the boardroom be a Christian in a staff room be a Christian in the garage be a Christian outside wherever wherever follow where he leads you and in that way you can lead others to Christ isn't that right okay wow even the son of man came not to be ministered but a minister and to give his life for many all right read a quick quote here from God called man we know this and he said I saw tonight I want to think on that remember that in the midst of all this cry God cannot until he's got men in sheep we cannot have a Revival until we get men God call man God trained men that's not trained up in the schools of Theology and education but rugged men faith that God has brought up in the school of his rugged training not just training but rugged training character building amen isn't that right men who are not afraid to face the fire man was coming the presence of God knows his power and knows his omnipotence and knows his healing power some men that's trained to know the Living God it's all right to train them by the word but let them kill it the spirit given life he said and before we can have this revival God has a call out and trained man oh that's what we're doing this morning we're being trained train for a great job we have to do it's very important amen God trained man to carry this message remember God's burden he says feed my sheep feed my Lambs they carry this message and they don't care what the opposition is they're willing to go to the fiery furnace and defeat or to the Lions then or wherever it may be they're ready to go because they've been in the presence of God and they know that he is whether it's the victory or defeat they still stand the same that's the kind of training that God does the man and it's very strange to think that God would do that that God trains his men like that the prophet said but he does you know we have an old song We Sing some through the waters some through the floods some through deep trials but all through the blood God leads his people through great trials to purge them oh I don't want God to purge me this morning and sometimes he says it takes years to do it it's not an overnight job Perfection takes time and as for myself tonight he said I believe that right now God is training such men to meet the front line men who are going through and time shook from their feet sometimes something I look like the whole thing is falling apart but yet in the midst of it all they know that Living God keep their face forward and they keep moving on Amen and amen and amen glory to God you believe that oh hallelujah hallelujah doesn't read something from adoption here please going to get ready to sing amen God bless you I've kept you so long oh my but I pray this will be a blessing to you praise God Prophet said here on adoption he said oh that's my son that's my boy well well he's mature yep sure do said the Holy Spirit and I give him tests boy I tried him this way I tried him that way I throwed him down Sick I put him under I've stumped him I let the devil do everything to him he could do he come right back up again he just come up the same see I made him sick I done this I throw this Sim in the hospital You're Gonna Stand I took him out here I done this I've done that I turned his wife against him turn his neighbors against him I tried everything and make a bit of difference said though he's sleepy yet I'll trust him I kill his family I took this I did that I done all this I did this that and the other he still stood right up and said no he's sleepy he had out serve him he's mine oh God says well I believe we ought to call him out somewhere to a little special place and have an adoption and now when the father understood that his son has come of age he still season out the prophet said they're born a child but they're not a son then they'll never be no more than a child but they have to mature what they are then he calls them out this last say party he said no no here we are Church you ready he said it's a little late I know everybody thinks they bit your finger he said but he takes him out to a certain place you see he said now we're going into a place the church now when the church gets to that place he says Manassas you belong over here if the placing of sons Ephraim you belong over there over there we're getting that place he said of placing of sons so then we take him out to a certain place the father does and he sets him on a high place like this and he has a ceremony and they all come around and he said I want everyone to know that this is my child and I adopt my son and I want anyone to know from henceforce that is name I dress him up a special dress on him I want to know his name is just as good as any check as my name is he's my child I adopt him into my family and though he's been in my son since he received the Holy Ghost he's been my son but I'm now placing in positionally in authority what he fires is fired and what he hires is higher amen and amen to you the prophet said if you say this tree say to this mountain be moving don't doubt in your heart but believe whatever you say to come to pass there you are there you are see he's my son how many knows that the adoption that the adopted son has to be proved amen it's the placing of a son may the Lord bless you amen and may He richly pour out his power upon you I'm finished Let's Just Praise Him in this little hands oh I'll
