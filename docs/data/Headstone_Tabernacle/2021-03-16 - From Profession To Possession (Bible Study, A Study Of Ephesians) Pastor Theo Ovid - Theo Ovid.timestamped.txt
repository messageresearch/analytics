[11:44] you taking this time off to uh be with
[11:47] us in this bible study
[11:49] and tonight our title from profession
[11:52] to possession study of ephesians
[11:56] from profession to possession and um
[11:59] before i get where i want to go
[12:01] i want to start here this whole field
[12:02] let us start tonight from first
[12:04] corinthians chapter 10
[12:05] so we're going to run through some
[12:06] scriptures tonight in the bible and we
[12:08] go just
[12:09] look and we want you to to take this
[12:12] tonight not as a text
[12:14] not as we just read in scriptures but
[12:17] how god deals and how god speaks
[12:21] you know a lot of times i we would say
[12:24] people use the god of their own
[12:26] imagination what they think
[12:28] god is or what they feel god is but god
[12:31] is the word
[12:32] and when we go to the bible we see
[12:35] clearly his thoughts and his intent and
[12:38] this is what we want to look at tonight
[12:40] so we want to shake off our feelings
[12:41] tonight and just hear the word
[12:43] as the word and believe the word to be
[12:45] god speaking to us tonight
[12:47] first corinthians chapter 10 reading
[12:49] from verse one
[12:50] moreover brethren i would not have that
[12:53] he
[12:54] should be ignorant at how all our
[12:56] fathers were under the cloud
[12:58] and all passed through the sea and were
[13:01] all
[13:01] baptized under moses and the clouds and
[13:03] the sea they'd all eat
[13:05] that same spiritual meat and they'd all
[13:08] drink that same spiritual drink for the
[13:10] drunk of that spiritual rock that
[13:11] followed them
[13:12] that brock was christ and verse five
[13:16] and with many of them god
[13:19] was not pleased for they were overthrown
[13:22] in the wilderness we're going to come
[13:24] back to this verse here
[13:25] for now these things were our examples
[13:29] to the intent
[13:31] we should not last after evil things are
[13:33] they'll also lost
[13:34] neither be the the idolaters as was some
[13:38] of them
[13:38] as is written the people sat down to eat
[13:42] and drink who's up to play neither let
[13:45] us commit fornication as some of them
[13:47] committed
[13:48] fell in one day three and twenty
[13:49] thousand neither yet
[13:51] let us tell christ some of them also
[13:53] attempted
[13:54] and were destroyed of the serpents
[13:56] neither
[13:57] ye some of them also murmured and were
[14:00] destroyed of the destroyer
[14:02] now all these things happen unto them
[14:05] for example and they are written
[14:08] for all admission admonition upon whom
[14:11] the ends of the world
[14:12] are come wherefore that in that tinker
[14:15] they stand there take heed
[14:16] let's see four they are no temptation
[14:20] taken you but such as is common to man
[14:23] but god is faithful who will not suffer
[14:26] you to be tempted
[14:27] above not able to that they are able but
[14:30] will with the temptation also make a way
[14:32] of escape
[14:33] that you may be able to bear it so
[14:35] therefore this scripture
[14:36] read here two highlights here
[14:41] the verse five but many of them god were
[14:44] not
[14:44] well pleased and they were overthrown in
[14:47] the wilderness
[14:48] and verse 10 needed
[14:52] some of them murmured and were destroyed
[14:55] of the destroyer and based on that we
[14:58] want to go to numbers chapter 14.
[15:00] now this number chapter 14 this was just
[15:03] after
[15:05] they said in 13 at the ending and we saw
[15:08] the giants and the sons of
[15:10] enoch which come out of the giants and
[15:12] we were in our own sight as grasshoppers
[15:15] and so were we in their sight this is
[15:18] where
[15:19] they painted their own pictures and
[15:20] believed their own pictures the pictures
[15:21] that they painted
[15:23] the giants didn't see them they saw the
[15:26] giants
[15:27] and they saw themselves as grasshoppers
[15:28] and it's terrible when you
[15:30] see the wrong pictures about yourself
[15:34] to get the right pictures you have to
[15:36] see what god say about
[15:37] you not what your neighbor friends
[15:40] family
[15:41] anybody see but what god say considering
[15:44] you
[15:45] and you know this
[15:48] after they brought this evil report in
[15:51] chapter 14
[15:52] the bible speak about the congregation
[15:54] lift up their voice and work that night
[15:56] and all the children of israel murmured
[15:59] against moses against aaron
[16:02] and the whole congregation said to them
[16:03] would god that we had died in the land
[16:06] of
[16:06] egypt or would god be had died in this
[16:09] wilderness
[16:10] and wherefore had the lord brought us
[16:12] out into this land
[16:13] to fail to fall by the sword and our
[16:16] wives and our children
[16:17] should be a prey wait not better for us
[16:20] to return to egypt
[16:21] and they said us let us make one captain
[16:24] and let us return them
[16:25] unto egypt and then moses and aaron fell
[16:27] on their face
[16:29] before all the assembly of the church of
[16:31] the congregation of chain of israel
[16:32] and joshua the son of nun and caleb
[16:34] jeffrey which will
[16:35] of them that switch the land rent their
[16:37] clothes
[16:38] so these two brothers joshua and caleb
[16:41] their behavior is completely different
[16:43] they are in anguish to see the people
[16:46] respond like that they are
[16:48] ripping their clothes they they say they
[16:50] speak unto the company of children and
[16:52] israel saying the land
[16:53] which we pass through to search it is an
[16:55] exceeding good land
[16:57] now i am seeing all of this because this
[17:00] story of this land
[17:01] is a shadow it's a type
[17:04] what we are entering into is the real
[17:06] land
[17:07] this here in type was a natural land
[17:11] and he said no verse eight if the lord
[17:13] enlighten us then we he will bring us
[17:14] into this land
[17:16] which and give us it give it us a
[17:18] language fruit of milk and honey
[17:20] only rebel not against the lord neither
[17:23] fear ye the people of the land
[17:25] for they are bred for us their defenses
[17:27] departed from them
[17:29] and the lord is with us and fear them
[17:31] not
[17:32] but wisdom but all the congregation
[17:36] made stone with stones
[17:39] and the glory of the lord appeared
[17:42] in the tabernacle of the congregation
[17:44] before all the german israel
[17:46] here it is these bunch of people two
[17:47] million people
[17:49] they didn't walk to egypt by their own
[17:52] strength
[17:53] goats and moses moses plagued pharaoh
[17:56] with
[17:56] with flies and frogs and lice and
[17:59] everything else
[18:00] it was all supernatural here it is the
[18:02] people know is that it's a mighty hand
[18:04] brought them out
[18:05] and they journeyed and here they are
[18:09] willing to stone willing to get captains
[18:12] to take them back to egypt
[18:14] and here all of a sudden all of a sudden
[18:16] a glory come down
[18:18] i mean that that had to be some type of
[18:21] experience
[18:22] that would be shaking every man dear
[18:25] that supernatural glory
[18:27] coming over the camp and the lord said
[18:30] unto moses
[18:31] how long will this people provoke me
[18:35] how long will it be here they believe me
[18:38] for all the signs that i have shown
[18:41] among them
[18:42] remember who is speaking here now he's
[18:43] not a man he's not an evangelist
[18:45] he's not a pastor this is god speaking
[18:48] to moses
[18:49] i will smite them with the pestilence
[18:52] and disinherit them and will make of
[18:55] thee
[18:56] a greater nation mightier than deep
[18:59] so god was telling moses i'll flatten
[19:01] this old bunch
[19:02] i'll get you a new book i'll disinherit
[19:06] them
[19:06] and moses said unto the lord then the
[19:09] egyptians shall hear it
[19:11] but thou brought us up this people in
[19:13] thy might from among them
[19:14] and they will tell it to the inhabitants
[19:16] of the land for they have heard that the
[19:18] lord are among
[19:20] these people that dog lord had seen face
[19:23] to face
[19:24] that thy clothes stand over them and
[19:26] that thou goes before them by daytime
[19:28] in a pillar of cloud and a pillar fire
[19:30] by night now
[19:32] if thou shalt kill all these people as
[19:34] one man
[19:36] then the nations which have heard of the
[19:38] fame of thee will speak saying
[19:40] because the lord was not able to bring
[19:42] this people into the land which is
[19:44] swaying to them
[19:45] therefore he had fleeing them in the
[19:46] wilderness so he was presented to god it
[19:49] will show up that you are weak
[19:51] it will show up that you're short on
[19:53] power it will show up that you do have
[19:55] the ability to bring these people out
[19:57] and now verse 17 i beseech thee let
[20:00] the power of thy lord be great according
[20:02] as though
[20:03] i've spoken saying the lord is so
[20:06] long-suffering
[20:07] and of great mercy so moses is begging
[20:09] he's pleading
[20:10] forgiving iniquity and transgression and
[20:12] by no means declaring the guilty
[20:14] visiting the iniquity of the fathers
[20:16] upon the children and upon the third and
[20:17] fourth generation
[20:19] pardon i beseech the iniquity of this
[20:21] people
[20:22] according according unto thy
[20:26] unto the greatness of thy mercy and as
[20:29] thou has forgiven these people
[20:30] from egypt even until now and this is
[20:33] god speaking back now
[20:35] and the lord said i have pardoned
[20:37] according to thy word
[20:38] but as i truly as i live all the earth
[20:42] shall be filled with the glory of the
[20:44] lord
[20:46] because all these men which have seen my
[20:49] glory
[20:50] and my miracles which i did in egypt are
[20:53] in the wilderness
[20:54] and have tempted me know these ten times
[20:57] and have not happened to my voice
[20:59] surely they shall not see the land which
[21:02] i swear unto their fathers
[21:04] neither shall any of them that provoke
[21:06] me see
[21:07] but my servant caleb because
[21:10] he had another spirit with him and had
[21:13] followed me
[21:14] fully him will i bring into the land
[21:17] where unto he went and his seat shall
[21:20] possess it
[21:21] let me just pause here one moment god
[21:24] highlight
[21:25] a name that name is caleb
[21:29] the prophet said that that caleb
[21:30] represented the true believer in the
[21:31] last days
[21:32] that was david joshua the holy ghost
[21:35] just represents
[21:36] the holy spirit his servant killed him
[21:39] because he another spirit with him had
[21:41] followed me fully
[21:43] and i would bring him into this land
[21:45] where where unto he sent it
[21:47] verse 25 now the amalekites and the
[21:50] kindernites dwelt in the valley
[21:51] he said tomorrow turn you and grow you
[21:54] into the wilderness
[21:55] by the way of the red sea and the lord
[21:57] speak unto moses and aaron saying how
[22:00] long shall i bear this evil congregation
[22:02] which move against me now i want you to
[22:05] think
[22:06] redemption will get on it later on is in
[22:08] two parts okay
[22:10] coming out of and going into
[22:14] this is gorge people there is not
[22:17] egyptians
[22:18] these are jews these are children of
[22:21] promise
[22:22] and god is saying how long shall i bear
[22:25] with this evil congregation which
[22:28] movement against me
[22:29] i have heard the murmurings of the
[22:31] children of israel
[22:32] which they move against me say unto them
[22:36] as truly as i live saith the lord as you
[22:39] have spoken in my
[22:40] ears so will i do to you
[22:43] and this is prophecy your carcasses
[22:46] shall fall in this wilderness and all
[22:50] that were numbered of you according to
[22:52] your whole number
[22:54] from 20 years old and upward which have
[22:57] murmured against me
[22:59] doubtless you shall not come into the
[23:02] land
[23:02] concerning which i swear to make you
[23:04] dwell therein
[23:06] see if caleb the son of jeffrey and
[23:08] joshua the son of none
[23:10] but your little ones which you said
[23:13] would be pray
[23:14] them will i bring in and they shall know
[23:17] the land
[23:18] which ye have despised but as for you
[23:22] your carcasses they shall fall in the
[23:25] wilderness
[23:26] and your children all this is prophecy
[23:28] now
[23:29] because of the behavior because of the
[23:32] reaction
[23:33] because of unbelief prophecy coming to
[23:35] them of judgment
[23:37] first territory and your children
[23:41] shall wander in the wilderness 40 years
[23:44] and bear your holdups until your
[23:47] carcasses
[23:48] be wasted in the wilderness after the
[23:51] number of days
[23:53] so god making a match now after
[23:56] the number of days in which you search
[23:59] the land
[24:00] even 40 days each day for a year
[24:04] shall he be your iniquities even 40
[24:06] years
[24:07] and he shall know my breach of promise i
[24:10] the lord have said
[24:12] i will surely do it unto all this evil
[24:14] congregation
[24:15] that i gathered together against me in
[24:18] this wilderness
[24:19] they shall be consumed and dear they
[24:22] shall
[24:22] die and the men which moses sent to
[24:25] sister land
[24:26] who returned and made all the
[24:28] congregation to mumma against him
[24:30] by bringing up a slander upon the land
[24:32] even those men that did bring up the
[24:34] evil report upon the land
[24:36] died by the plague before the lord
[24:40] but joshua the son of nun and
[24:43] caleb the son of jeffernaire which were
[24:46] of the men that went to christian land
[24:49] lived still and moses told these saiyans
[24:51] unto all the children of israel
[24:53] and the people mourn greatly and they
[24:55] rose up early in the morning
[24:57] got them to the top of the mountain and
[24:59] said lord we be here
[25:01] and we'll go up to the place which the
[25:02] lord had promised for we have sinned
[25:04] and moses said wherefore now do you
[25:07] transgress
[25:08] the commandment of the lord but it shall
[25:10] not prosper
[25:11] go not up for the lord is not among you
[25:15] that you be not smitten before your
[25:16] enemies for the amalekites and the
[25:18] canaanites
[25:19] are dear before you you shall fall by
[25:21] the sword
[25:22] because you are turned away from the
[25:24] lord therefore the lord will not be with
[25:27] you
[25:28] what they presumed to go up into the
[25:30] hilton nevertheless
[25:32] the ark of the covenant of the lord and
[25:34] moses departed not out of the camp
[25:36] and the amalekites came down and the
[25:38] canaanites which dwelt in that hill
[25:41] and smoked them and discomforted them
[25:44] even to homer you see
[25:48] because they know they are god's people
[25:51] or claim to be god's people and they
[25:54] feel that god is still with them
[25:55] with all the misbehavior and carrying on
[25:58] and moses tell them no
[25:59] good luck with you the behavior
[26:02] you're what you're carrying on with
[26:04] don't go up they went up
[26:06] and they got blows and i want to assure
[26:09] you
[26:10] then that so many people in this message
[26:12] take things for granted take the message
[26:14] for granted
[26:15] take um they leave the prophet they
[26:18] believe the message of the
[26:19] hour and that looked like an instant
[26:21] ticket to glory
[26:22] instant ticket to where they think
[26:23] they're going but friends
[26:26] if we take in this bible by bible word
[26:28] by word verse by verse line by line
[26:30] it's not really so it it has to be the
[26:33] word
[26:34] there's a narrow way and that way is the
[26:37] word
[26:38] so if you're still there with me and
[26:39] rider with me let's go to hebrews
[26:40] chapter three
[26:41] and let's read from verse seven hebrews
[26:44] chapter three
[26:46] and let's go to verse seven for
[26:48] scripture reason tonight
[26:50] and um verse seven of hebrews chapter
[26:53] three it says here
[26:54] wherefore as the holy ghost today if you
[26:56] will hear his voice
[26:58] harden not your hearts as in the
[27:01] provocation
[27:02] in the day of temptation in the
[27:03] wilderness and this is god speaking when
[27:06] your father's
[27:06] tempted me and proved me
[27:10] and so my works 40 years therefore i was
[27:13] grieved with that generation no now
[27:16] you're getting
[27:17] god's feeling about the issue you're
[27:20] getting a god's feeling
[27:21] about the behavior of that generation of
[27:23] people that was called out by a mighty
[27:26] hand bear in mind
[27:27] that the people was in bondage for
[27:29] hundreds of years
[27:31] until they begin to cry for deliverance
[27:34] until they begin to cry for breakthrough
[27:36] remember god heard their cries
[27:40] and i want to assure you and encourage
[27:42] you
[27:43] to keep on praying because god is hear
[27:46] your words
[27:47] god is hear your cry when god came down
[27:50] to moses he said i have heard
[27:52] the cries of my people and i'm come down
[27:55] you say when your father tempted me
[27:57] and prove me verse 9 and so my works 40
[28:00] years
[28:01] wherefore i was grieved for that
[28:03] generation and said
[28:04] they do always er in their heart and
[28:07] they have not known my ways
[28:09] so i swear in my right they shall not
[28:12] enter into my rights
[28:13] take heed brethren take heed brethren
[28:17] least there be any of you an evil
[28:20] heart of unbelief in the pattern from
[28:23] the living god
[28:25] but exhort one another daily while it is
[28:28] called
[28:29] today at least any of you be hardened
[28:33] through the deceitfulness of sin aha
[28:36] so now we get a different picture now we
[28:39] see
[28:40] a heart issue where hearts
[28:43] could get hardened by the deceitfulness
[28:46] of sin
[28:47] so take heed brethren verse 14. for we
[28:51] are made partakers of christ
[28:53] if we hold the beginning
[28:56] of our confidence step fast until the
[28:59] end
[29:00] i want to pause on that verse here we
[29:02] are made partakers of christ
[29:03] if conditional if we hold
[29:07] the beginning of our confidence
[29:10] steadfast until the end
[29:12] so it's not who start is who complete
[29:15] this race
[29:16] it's who finish while i just said to
[29:18] dave verse 15
[29:19] if you will hear my voice had not your
[29:21] heart as in the provocation
[29:23] for some when they had heard did provoke
[29:27] probably it not all that came out of
[29:28] egypt by moses but with whom
[29:30] was he great 40 years was it not with
[29:32] them that had sinned
[29:34] whose carcasses fell in the wilderness
[29:37] and to whom he swear he would not enter
[29:39] into his wrath
[29:40] but to them that believe not so we see
[29:44] they could not enter in because of
[29:47] unbelief let's read that verse again
[29:49] so we see they could not enter in
[29:53] why because of unbelief
[29:57] and now from there we go to hebrews
[30:00] chapter four let's keep continuing
[30:02] let us therefore fear least a promise
[30:06] being left
[30:06] us of entering into his rest
[30:10] any of you should seem to come short of
[30:12] it
[30:13] for unto us was the gospel preached as
[30:16] well unto them
[30:18] but the word preached did not profit
[30:20] them
[30:21] not being mixed with feet in them that
[30:24] heard it
[30:25] for we which have believed do enter into
[30:28] rest
[30:29] but he said as i have sworn in my rat if
[30:32] they shall enter into my rest
[30:33] although the works were finished from
[30:35] foundation of the world for he speak in
[30:37] a certain place on
[30:38] of the seventh day on this wise and god
[30:41] did rest the seventh day from all his
[30:43] works
[30:44] and in this place again if they shall
[30:46] enter into my rest
[30:47] seeing therefore it remained that some
[30:50] must enter therein
[30:51] and date to whom it was first preached
[30:53] entered not in
[30:55] because of one belief again he limited a
[30:57] certainty saying in david today
[30:59] after so long a time as i just said
[31:01] today if you will hear his voice have
[31:03] not your heart
[31:04] for if jesus had given them rest then
[31:08] would he not afterwards are spoken of
[31:09] another day there remained therefore
[31:12] arrest
[31:13] to the people of god for he that is
[31:16] entered into
[31:17] his rest he also shall see some his own
[31:20] works as god did from his
[31:22] here we go verse 11 let us labor
[31:25] therefore
[31:26] to enter into that rest least any man
[31:30] fall
[31:31] after the same example of unbelief
[31:34] so i think some time ago i think i gave
[31:37] a bible study on
[31:38] god in your heart god in your heart that
[31:41] your heart
[31:42] and behind guiding your heart from one
[31:44] belief guiding your heart from sin
[31:46] and david said i would have hid in my
[31:48] heart that i might not sin against thee
[31:51] and so this is the backdrop now and
[31:53] going into the thought
[31:55] and verse 12 of this him he will say for
[31:57] the word of god is quick and powerful
[31:59] sharper than any twitch sword piercing
[32:01] even to divide an asunder
[32:03] of soul and spirit joints and marrow and
[32:06] the design of the thoughts and intents
[32:07] of the heart so this is where is our
[32:10] backdrop
[32:10] and this is where we're going to go into
[32:12] from a profession to opposition
[32:14] a study of ephesians now understand this
[32:18] that and we're going to read it
[32:20] ephesians parallel joshua
[32:22] when you read joshua you read ephesians
[32:24] you feel ephesians remember joshua
[32:26] moses brought the people out but joshua
[32:30] took them in the same thing that brought
[32:33] you out is not going to take you in
[32:35] i'm going to read it for you it takes a
[32:38] power
[32:39] it takes something more so moses
[32:42] ministry was to get the people out
[32:46] but joshua ministry is to get the people
[32:49] in let's call moses ministry
[32:52] a word ministry the word ministry
[32:56] the shout get people out
[32:59] of your baptist methodist pentecostals
[33:01] your witness whatever background or
[33:03] whatever you call out to believe a
[33:05] message entire message
[33:06] but joshua which is the type of the holy
[33:09] ghost
[33:10] just your ministry is what going to take
[33:13] you in
[33:14] bear in mind redemption is in two parts
[33:16] coming out of and going into
[33:18] many people come out they nice groups
[33:20] have nights pastors nice churches
[33:23] but the question is have you gone into
[33:25] now
[33:26] coming out you were coming out based
[33:28] upon a confession of faith
[33:30] based upon a confession of believing god
[33:32] believing god said a message of the
[33:34] allah and this is what you believe is
[33:35] where you're standing for your name is
[33:37] on the book
[33:38] but profession and possession
[33:42] is two different things let's say for
[33:45] instance day one
[33:46] coming out of egypt and an egyptian
[33:50] speaking and talking to a jewish brother
[33:52] and say brother
[33:55] what is this about where you going
[33:58] that brother could say oh god kept his
[34:02] word
[34:03] he sent moses we are god's people
[34:06] i'm a jew i'm going to the promised land
[34:10] now all this testimony he's given and
[34:13] sharing
[34:14] he is not yet in the promised land he is
[34:17] on his way
[34:18] and until you reach he is still
[34:21] journeying
[34:22] i'll say it different i'll say this way
[34:25] two million people got books
[34:29] and tapes and tablets and everything on
[34:32] the message of the hour that moses
[34:34] brought in that day but god had to send
[34:36] two million
[34:38] and gave out to two million people
[34:40] because out of the two million people
[34:42] they are two people that are going to
[34:44] really catch it
[34:46] which is joshua and caleb so let's go to
[34:50] joshua chapter one
[34:51] the people have come out moses is now
[34:55] dead
[34:56] and god is about to make a new move
[34:59] another move
[35:00] a different move moses was the law
[35:03] joshua represent grace
[35:05] moses was like the word joshua represent
[35:08] like the spirit
[35:09] joshua chapter 1 we read now after the
[35:12] death of moses the servant of the lord
[35:14] it came to pass that the lord speak unto
[35:16] joshua the son of none
[35:17] moses minister saying moses my servant
[35:20] is dead no therefore arise
[35:22] go over this jordan dull and all these
[35:25] people unto the land which i do give
[35:26] them
[35:27] even to the children of israel note the
[35:30] bunch of unbelievers
[35:32] that was in that group fell after 40
[35:34] years god make them make circles
[35:36] for 40 years so they're dead now so what
[35:38] joshua is dealing with now
[35:40] is the children of those those so-called
[35:43] believers
[35:44] all right who's three every place that
[35:47] the soul of your foot shall tread upon
[35:48] that have i given unto you as i said
[35:50] unto moses from the wilderness
[35:52] this lebanon even under the great river
[35:54] the river frities all the land of the
[35:56] hittites
[35:57] great seater was the going on of the sun
[35:58] shall be of course it shall not be
[36:00] any man able to stand before thee or the
[36:03] days of thy life as i was at moses
[36:06] i will be with thee i will not fail thee
[36:08] nor for sickly
[36:09] be strong of a good courage for unto
[36:12] this people shall thou divide
[36:13] for an inheritance the land which i
[36:16] swear to their fathers to give them
[36:17] only be those strong very courageous
[36:20] that thou mayest observe to do according
[36:22] to all the law
[36:23] which moses my servant commanded thee
[36:25] two hundred turn not from it
[36:27] with the right hand or to the left that
[36:29] thomas prosper within server though goes
[36:31] this book of the law shall not be part
[36:34] of thy mouth
[36:35] that thou may meditate during the night
[36:38] that thomas observed to do
[36:40] now what's the action words this book
[36:44] you'll meditate on the book not
[36:47] every bible study day not every sunday
[36:50] no day and night that you may observe
[36:54] to do so the only way we could know
[36:58] how we are pleasing god or how we could
[37:01] be god approved
[37:02] is if we meditate on the word dear night
[37:04] to what
[37:05] that you're gonna get good success that
[37:08] your we could be of prosperous
[37:10] so that means god is interested in your
[37:12] you being successful
[37:14] and god is interested in you being
[37:15] prosperous let me say that again
[37:17] god is interested in you being
[37:20] successful and you being prosperous
[37:23] and you being blessed but it's according
[37:26] to
[37:27] your taking in that word and medicine in
[37:29] that word
[37:30] remember as a christian you are not you
[37:33] are under a different covenant you can
[37:35] act like unbelievers and
[37:36] and do and carry on and expect to get
[37:39] success like oh you will have success
[37:41] your success comes by
[37:43] god and his grace and his presence and
[37:45] his blood
[37:46] have not i can manage you be who is nine
[37:49] be strong
[37:50] and have a good courage you're not
[37:51] afraid neither you know dismayed for the
[37:54] lord thy god is with thee
[37:55] where the sovereign alcohol is and now
[37:57] we're gonna read ephesians chapter one
[37:59] so we're switching from joshua and we're
[38:01] going to ephesians one
[38:02] and we're going to take it from there
[38:04] and this is chapter one of ephesians if
[38:06] you want to turn the bibles together

[38:49] before him in love
[38:50] having predestinated us unto the
[38:52] adoption of children by jesus christ
[38:55] to himself according to the good
[38:57] pleasure of his will
[38:58] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[39:00] wherein he had made us accepted in the
[39:02] beloved
[39:02] in whom we have redemption to his blood
[39:04] the forgiveness of sins according to the
[39:06] riches of his grace wherein he had a
[39:08] boundary towards us
[39:09] in all wisdom and prudence having made
[39:11] known to us the mystery of his will
[39:14] according to his good pleasure which had
[39:15] purpose in himself
[39:17] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[39:19] of times he might gather together in one
[39:21] all things in christ both which are in
[39:23] heaven and we shall on earth even in him
[39:25] in whom also we have obtained an
[39:27] inheritance
[39:28] being predestinated according to the
[39:30] purpose of him who work at all things
[39:32] after the council of his own will that
[39:34] we should be to the praise of his glory
[39:36] who was trusted in christ

[40:09] which now becomes a possession watch
[40:12] which is the earnest
[40:13] of our inheritance until the redemption
[40:16] of the precious possession

[41:18] them troubleshooting
[41:19] listen god is all refuge and strength a
[41:22] very present help in a time of trouble

[41:26] love that
[41:27] after jesus rules from the dead his
[41:28] words will constantly fear not
[41:30] and that's what the trouble with the
[41:32] church today is scared to death
[41:33] you're going to make a failure what can
[41:35] you feel when you're in christ

[41:45] you said well i'm afraid i'll get
[41:46] fanatic here let's bomb here
[41:48] i'm afraid i'll get a fanatic i'd rather
[41:51] have a little fantasticism than to
[41:52] set still and do nothing hallelujah
[41:54] could be given the lotion prisoners on
[41:55] that one
[41:56] he said he'd rather have a little
[41:58] fanaticism
[42:00] and sit still and do nothing and i i i
[42:03] subscribe to that
[42:04] greatly so i prefer to have some
[42:05] shelters and some worshippers
[42:07] and some people who want to run all the
[42:09] pew and run lunches and come back up
[42:11] i prefer have that don't have people
[42:13] just sitting down dead i give the
[42:15] in some jehovah witness kingdom hall or
[42:18] let's continue
[42:18] joshua here is a book actually
[42:23] wow glory so this book we preached on
[42:26] about two weeks ago
[42:27] that was sealed written within and
[42:30] sealed with seven seals this book keep
[42:32] popping up
[42:33] in different types shadows joshua here
[42:36] is a book actually it's a book of
[42:39] redemption
[42:40] old testament joshua we would have to
[42:43] consider it
[42:43] to be that the book of redemption and
[42:46] redemption has two parts redemption
[42:50] anyway has to pass that is out of and
[42:53] into it take two parts to make
[42:57] redemption out of into
[43:00] and the thing of it is it's not out of
[43:03] one doctrine and into another doctrine
[43:06] it's not out of one belief and into
[43:09] another belief
[43:10] it is not that because when jesus rose
[43:13] from the dead
[43:14] he worked with his own disciples and he
[43:18] had some hours with them
[43:20] sharing promises from the old testament
[43:22] to set them up
[43:24] to be on the expectation for their own
[43:27] inheritance
[43:28] which is the promise of the holy ghost
[43:29] and he told them
[43:31] i will not if you comfort us they're
[43:32] gonna comfort you i will not let you
[43:34] leave you as
[43:35] orphans but a little while the world see
[43:37] at me no more but you're gonna see me
[43:40] so he himself was telling them i
[43:44] even as the word with you have to move
[43:47] aside
[43:49] so i come like moses
[43:52] and i am moving away that joshua could
[43:55] come now
[43:56] and take over and joshua will be in the
[43:59] upper room
[44:00] joshua will divide the pillar of fire
[44:04] and give each one of you a lick joshua
[44:07] will divide and give you your portion if
[44:10] i don't go
[44:11] the comforter will not come but branham
[44:14] said some things like this
[44:15] is if i don't let go this first pull the
[44:18] second pull will not come
[44:20] if i don't let go the second pull the
[44:23] turtle wouldn't come
[44:25] there are certain things we have to let
[44:27] go
[44:28] or give up to go to the next stage of
[44:32] your life
[44:33] moses ministry had its time
[44:36] moses ministry as powerful as it was
[44:40] one of the greatest prophets that walked
[44:42] the earth
[44:43] yet it had its limit and when he came to
[44:46] his
[44:46] end joshua was next to take over
[44:50] so this book of redemption and don't
[44:52] forget that now
[44:54] it so i want you to be stood up in your
[44:56] spirit
[44:57] to go into i want you to be stood up in
[45:00] your spirit
[45:01] to press into i want you to be stood up
[45:04] in your spirit
[45:05] to labor to enter into
[45:08] that rest you see some people are
[45:11] comfortable
[45:12] that they come out they are not catholic
[45:14] they're not baptised they're not
[45:15] deceived they're not pissed they're not
[45:17] that and whatnot they're all where
[45:18] they're not
[45:19] but they are not yet where they're
[45:20] supposed to be
[45:22] so that is where we cannot just sit back
[45:25] and relax tonight
[45:26] we have to press on brethren he said
[45:29] joshua here
[45:30] is a book and it's two parts we said
[45:32] that moses represent the law
[45:34] which brought them out of egypt whereas
[45:38] joshua represent greece which took them
[45:41] into the promised land
[45:43] no not by might not my power
[45:46] and the headstone will come with
[45:48] shoulders of grease grease onto it the
[45:50] rubber bill
[45:51] but that's on the book of zechariah no
[45:54] the prophet said this if the power
[45:57] is to come among the people it wouldn't
[46:00] even be their prayer
[46:01] it would be the grace of god no does
[46:04] that mean that we wouldn't pray
[46:05] no you're praying more than ever but he
[46:07] is saying something
[46:08] it will take grace to take us out
[46:11] so therefore he says here moses
[46:13] represent the law
[46:15] which brought them out which is the word
[46:17] whereas joshua represent grace
[46:19] that took them into the promised land
[46:22] let's look again closely in the new
[46:23] testament
[46:24] when jesus came on the scene what about
[46:26] all those
[46:27] beautiful sisters who was on the scribe
[46:29] and pharisees
[46:31] what about mary magdalene what about the
[46:33] woman of the world
[46:35] grace is what pick up these sisters
[46:37] grace will
[46:38] pick up fishermen and drunkards and
[46:40] sinners grace
[46:41] jesus didn't go to the temple of
[46:43] describing pharisees
[46:45] and work with them and call them he went
[46:47] and take tax collector and so on
[46:49] and you wonder how he could choose these
[46:51] illiterate people
[46:52] these poor people this distressed people
[46:55] but he did
[46:56] the grace of god and the fact that the
[46:58] name was on the book
[46:59] so he said the law brought them out
[47:02] moses
[47:02] that was moses and joshua took them in
[47:05] it also represents something for our day
[47:08] now it represents as they were in a
[47:11] journey
[47:12] coming from egypt into the promised land
[47:14] so
[47:15] have we come out of the world of egypt
[47:17] chaos
[47:18] on our road to the promised land and
[47:21] then he quoted my father's house and he
[47:22] mansions and so on
[47:24] now the law brings us to recognize we're
[47:26] wrong and it's grace that forgive us
[47:28] the law no hope of redemption but to
[47:31] complete it it has no grace in it
[47:33] because law only points that you're a
[47:35] sinner but grace tells you
[47:38] who how to get out of it the law is the
[47:40] police man will put you in jail
[47:42] but redemption is the one who come and
[47:44] paid your fine
[47:45] out of into out of
[47:49] into the law said jail the law say
[47:51] adulterer your fornicator your liar this
[47:53] whatever whatever that's the law
[47:55] but grace come to pull you out of that
[47:59] could we give the lord some praises for
[48:00] his grace tonight oh blessed be the name
[48:03] of the lord
[48:04] thank you jesus thank you for your love
[48:05] lord thank you for your grace
[48:07] so he said now ephesus we find out
[48:10] the old testament i think the book of
[48:12] joshua fitz
[48:13] is a fitting word for it would be the
[48:16] book of
[48:16] ephesus of the old testament the book of
[48:20] ephesians of the old testament
[48:22] is the book of joshua so this whole
[48:25] story that we are sharing
[48:27] is is ties in with the seven seas book
[48:30] written within
[48:31] the backside seal with seven seals you
[48:34] see
[48:35] you see by the scriptures
[48:39] tonight is not all who came
[48:42] out or i should say this way
[48:46] all who came out did not go in
[48:49] it's not he who starts not he
[48:52] who believes is not he who has a
[48:55] profession
[48:56] but he who has come into a possession
[48:59] how many assad tonight how many
[49:01] seen that tonight oh god
[49:04] i want you to see tonight it's not good
[49:07] to have a book
[49:08] and say i believe what is in this book
[49:12] this book is a pointer
[49:16] this book like a map then this book is
[49:18] to lead you to a literal treasure
[49:21] this book is to take you to an actual
[49:23] position
[49:25] not just a confession right now
[49:28] we have a confession right now we have a
[49:30] profession
[49:31] right now we have a belief but the
[49:34] reality is
[49:35] we disbelief or profession have to take
[49:39] into possession
[49:40] so let's say for instance after 200
[49:42] years of crying out they say deliberate
[49:43] come and deliver coming
[49:45] let's say they have two or more years to
[49:46] go they keep believing
[49:48] they believe in they believe it it
[49:49] happened here or they're coming
[49:51] finally moses was born so that was the
[49:54] fulfillment of scripture
[49:56] messiah was prophecy he's coming he's
[49:59] coming
[49:59] he's talking about messiah so long and
[50:02] one day
[50:03] jesus was born messiah came whoa we talk
[50:07] about dynamics for years thermodynamics
[50:09] people mock people laugh people find
[50:12] that
[50:12] you know there's another public show
[50:16] and a bride called a sign and a bright
[50:18] not in sodom and the
[50:20] bride the sun and some mountains
[50:21] somewhere like abraham all the nice
[50:22] types it looks good
[50:24] but the fact is abraham had was to wait
[50:28] for his dynamics to change his body
[50:30] that he could have the baby so all the
[50:32] talk about eva on the backside
[50:34] and he was elected and whatnot that old
[50:37] man cap produced so
[50:39] old woman syria capitalists were
[50:41] challenged and when he said i will
[50:43] return to d
[50:44] according to the time of life in other
[50:46] words god came up with words
[50:48] to tell him a comment to come i'll come
[50:50] to tell you i'm coming
[50:51] in otherwise i come to tell you by words
[50:54] that i'm coming back again in power
[50:58] so i come to see you down and give you
[51:00] the assurance
[51:01] that your 25 years of believing this
[51:04] promise
[51:04] is not wasted oh glory hallelujah i come
[51:07] to bring a fresh comfort to you
[51:09] i come to to give you a fresh anointing
[51:12] i come to raise a standard to give you
[51:14] assurance
[51:15] next 20 days time of life sherry will
[51:18] come into our cycle again
[51:20] hallelujah the egg will drop down and
[51:21] say we'll conceive oh hallelujah
[51:24] so think about god come into earth to
[51:27] show us clearly
[51:28] his word of promise all the old
[51:30] testament characters
[51:32] all the old testament believers all
[51:34] their belief and
[51:35] and their behavior is for our examples
[51:38] to whom the ends of the world occur
[51:41] hallelujah oh give the lord some praises
[51:44] i want you to see
[51:45] the word as god not your feelings not
[51:47] what you think and you know
[51:49] i think it's supposed to be so no forget
[51:51] how you think it's supposed to be
[51:52] well um you know i don't see it so i
[51:55] never see it so no forget how you see it
[51:58] they will go tell moses amen oh blessed
[52:01] be
[52:02] you love him tonight oh praise the lord
[52:05] so watch
[52:05] barbara he said what we need is a
[52:08] revival
[52:09] we put corn plasters on take them off
[52:12] another corn plaster take it off
[52:14] we still find the pain is there what we
[52:17] need today is that social regeneration
[52:19] it is not intellectual talks what we
[52:22] need today
[52:24] is that old-fashioned god-sent blood
[52:27] transfusion from heaven
[52:28] the corn plastics won't do no good we
[52:31] are anemia
[52:32] we need a blood transfusion we need to
[52:34] come back
[52:35] to the old-fashioned gospel that calls
[52:38] off a repentance before god
[52:40] and not yes and not a dry-eyed
[52:44] hand-shook profession but a god-sent
[52:47] holy ghost revival with the possession
[52:50] of the cleansing of the blood of the
[52:52] lord jesus christ
[52:53] into every human heart we need a revival
[52:55] to start in the church
[52:57] and sweep the nation across we will die
[53:00] we will perish we are gone without that
[53:03] type of
[53:04] revival oh glory to god
[53:07] but branham what is sin he said many
[53:10] people think smoking cigarettes is sin
[53:13] it isn't many people think that lying is
[53:15] a sin
[53:16] it isn't committed is adultery that
[53:18] isn't sin
[53:19] that is attributes of unbelief the
[53:22] reason you do those things because you
[53:24] are unbeliever the only two things that
[53:27] is
[53:28] you are either a believer or unbeliever
[53:30] if you are a believer
[53:32] you do not those things if you do if you
[53:35] if you do do them
[53:37] i i don't know what kind of profession
[53:39] that you have
[53:40] but if you do that the love of god isn't
[53:42] in you the bible said so
[53:44] we have got too much a profession
[53:47] without a possession
[53:48] of it too many seeing are not living it
[53:52] i think even we have too much practice
[53:54] on silence
[53:55] and not living enough sermons it would
[53:58] be a lot better
[53:59] if we lived our sermon each one of us
[54:02] would be a minister
[54:03] it's better to live me a sermon than
[54:05] preach be one the bible said
[54:07] you are written epistles of god rid of
[54:09] all men
[54:10] so it's best to live is sinner
[54:14] now you say i've typed it with joshua
[54:16] you notice israel was brought up out of
[54:18] egypt
[54:19] three stages of their journey one stage
[54:22] leaving egypt the next stage was the
[54:25] wilderness
[54:26] the next stage was cana three stages
[54:30] leaving wilderness canaan
[54:34] leaving next stage wilderness
[54:38] next stage kena then he is drilling down
[54:41] now
[54:41] canaan does not represent the age of the
[54:44] millennium
[54:45] it only represent the age of the
[54:47] overcomer
[54:49] or the dispensation of overcoming
[54:51] because in canaan
[54:52] they killed and burned and took cities
[54:54] there will be no debt in the millennium
[54:56] or this is beautiful so all of a sudden
[55:00] you begin to show this promised land
[55:01] this land of ephesians are
[55:03] battling it have fight in it now if is
[55:06] the age
[55:07] of the overcomers it also means
[55:12] that is the age of the test
[55:15] don't miss that now if this is the age
[55:19] of the overcomers
[55:21] it means this is the age that we will be
[55:23] tested
[55:24] because the only way you could overcome
[55:27] is not if you're sitting in church
[55:28] every day i want you to think about that
[55:31] if we have service
[55:32] seven days a week and people sit in that
[55:35] tabernacle
[55:37] seven days a week and they don't have
[55:39] time to even say
[55:40] lucifer or see anybody at all
[55:43] then overcoming that is becoming part of
[55:46] the church
[55:48] like a church most
[55:51] that is not overcoming i remember in the
[55:54] early days
[55:55] either go to church monday wednesday
[55:57] friday sunday morning sunday evening
[55:59] little church i say oh gosh i ain't have
[56:02] time to meet the devil
[56:03] at so much in church if you get so
[56:06] churchy fight
[56:07] you imagine they got a good death but
[56:10] you see
[56:11] it's not church church it's a place
[56:13] where you're hearing the word
[56:15] you're getting equipped you're putting
[56:16] on badge and boots and
[56:18] and everything else you get to equip the
[56:19] face out there
[56:21] when we see it for its reality
[56:25] we would enjoy the fact that we are
[56:28] being tested
[56:30] we are being tried and we are
[56:34] called to overcome so in this battle
[56:38] you slip you slide you get back up you
[56:40] fight you get wounded
[56:42] you come back and fight you're not
[56:43] stopping because the land is yours
[56:45] you're bruised you're battered you're
[56:47] you're terrorizing your mind
[56:50] you feel like you want to give up you
[56:52] can't take it no more you
[56:53] get frustrated they get fed up but there
[56:56] is no letting go there's no giving up
[56:58] there's no giving up and that is why
[57:02] when it comes down to you it becomes
[57:03] very hard
[57:05] because when you get further and deeper
[57:07] in the revelation of the word and on god
[57:10] it never really feeds onto the picture
[57:12] it's not lucifer again with you
[57:14] it's not you devil stopping you and
[57:16] fighting you no you and you
[57:18] you becomes the enemy you becomes the
[57:21] great
[57:21] issue your challenges your
[57:25] demons your private devils and and
[57:28] influences upon your life you you are
[57:30] the person you know you become your
[57:32] the greatest enemy at any time you're
[57:35] blaming others and pointing external
[57:37] you're in trouble because you're far
[57:40] from where the battle is
[57:41] you see because you have to come to the
[57:43] place where you have to see yourself
[57:45] at the cross at the cross on the cross
[57:49] you have to see yourself dying out in
[57:52] truest sense
[57:53] before you take the beam off your
[57:55] brother eye you have to get rid of your
[57:57] night before
[57:58] you condemn this one on that one you
[58:00] have to be hateful towards your own sin
[58:02] and your own failures and your attitude
[58:03] before you blame others before your jam
[58:05] others they deal with you get yourself
[58:08] and then you become alive unto god this
[58:11] is what this is all about
[58:12] a real self-crucifixion and um
[58:16] i was thinking something and i just made
[58:18] it in and
[58:19] on free premier come up on friday about
[58:22] you know
[58:23] the the extra oil the extra oil
[58:26] also represents doing something extra
[58:30] and i believe that the wise virgin will
[58:32] pay that price
[58:34] and the reason i'm seeing that is
[58:35] because when the foolish came to ask for
[58:36] oil
[58:37] the y says go to them that sell in other
[58:40] words
[58:41] go and pay the price the price that we
[58:43] pay it was too late then
[58:44] but it means that the wise virgin will
[58:47] prepare to do something more than the
[58:49] regular
[58:50] church members the rise virgins was able
[58:54] to get empowered
[58:55] with the word that could be turned into
[58:57] oil
[58:58] and this is where you as a christian
[59:00] can't just be barely making it
[59:02] you have to succeed you have to strive
[59:07] you have to take your land you have to
[59:10] come into a possession
[59:11] god didn't told joshua like a lucky
[59:15] a lucky pill whole pin to get through
[59:17] you see every place you put your foot
[59:18] that is yours
[59:20] no if you look at it closely joshua have
[59:23] to put his feet
[59:23] foot it wasn't profession by binoculars
[59:27] possession by binoculars it's not just
[59:29] one a mountain and he's looking
[59:32] yeah boy looking good looking good i've
[59:34] seen it oh
[59:35] yes what a word i never see it so yeah
[59:38] yeah yeah you never see it so but you're
[59:41] still at the one possession
[59:43] you follow him saying well yeah see that
[59:44] sunset on god's head
[59:46] every oh don't you go in on your son
[59:48] this is not going down but your foot
[59:49] didn't move yet
[59:50] that line is not yours you know until
[59:53] you see
[59:53] the need of a holy ghost experience
[59:57] a holy ghost possession a holy ghost
[59:59] baptism
[1:00:00] a holy ghost anointed it takes you
[1:00:02] beyond the letter of the word
[1:00:04] it takes you into real christianity
[1:00:06] understand this
[1:00:07] let me just back a little bit the
[1:00:09] disciples
[1:00:11] that was anointed with authority from
[1:00:12] christ he placed an anointing upon them
[1:00:16] uh saved this way a temporary anointed
[1:00:20] and they were preaching the gospel the
[1:00:22] word and christ now devils even there
[1:00:25] was fleeing from them and they were very
[1:00:26] happy about it it's like quite a new
[1:00:28] experience
[1:00:29] just that i'm doing rejoice for that i
[1:00:31] know all the guys that delivered yet he
[1:00:32] said
[1:00:33] you couldn't even have or you would get
[1:00:34] trouble all by yourself for that piece
[1:00:36] of anointing
[1:00:37] on you he knew their idea you know that
[1:00:40] because without anointing peter denied
[1:00:42] christian all that gospel he preached
[1:00:44] and think
[1:00:44] peter bolt that nature you know the
[1:00:47] divers with all the anointing they had a
[1:00:48] whole lot gospel preaching
[1:00:49] when jesus died them fellas in them went
[1:00:51] back fishing normal normal normal
[1:00:53] italy leave them he didn't go on and so
[1:00:55] let's go back to square one
[1:00:57] but jesus knew that they was gonna get
[1:01:00] something on the inside
[1:01:02] not mental not intellectual
[1:01:05] not informational not something to
[1:01:08] repeat to say you know what i believe
[1:01:09] this little i believe jesus no no
[1:01:11] he said you shall receive p-o-w-e-r
[1:01:14] power
[1:01:15] after the holy ghost come upon you this
[1:01:18] was the final anchor to the seed that
[1:01:21] was in them
[1:01:23] this seed was always in peter this it
[1:01:25] was always in james
[1:01:26] and i said tonight the seed is already
[1:01:27] in you the holy ghost come to the seeds
[1:01:30] of god
[1:01:31] that's what you are that's why you are
[1:01:33] here tonight because you are seeds of
[1:01:35] god
[1:01:35] you could be back since you could be
[1:01:37] wounded seeds it could be like a wounded
[1:01:39] eagle you lost some feathers
[1:01:40] some animal put a bite in here and half
[1:01:43] your fur is gone but they go grow back
[1:01:44] they call your eagle
[1:01:45] yeah i mean kentucky fryer because
[1:01:48] another chicken
[1:01:49] yeah yeah ego you call for something
[1:01:51] higher
[1:01:52] and that is what you are here for so i
[1:01:54] want to encourage you tonight
[1:01:56] you know that this would really mean for
[1:01:58] you to come into opposition and i'm
[1:02:00] seeing it more and more
[1:02:01] oh god want to adopt his sons he want to
[1:02:04] give his son power
[1:02:05] but he cannot get power without
[1:02:06] character this is your old point
[1:02:09] you see weapon america they put a man
[1:02:12] the previous president
[1:02:13] a man you know he might have this in
[1:02:15] mind
[1:02:16] the man is what the man is and they put
[1:02:19] him in power
[1:02:20] and i mean american in a real condition
[1:02:24] now
[1:02:24] and you know what is unfortunate so much
[1:02:26] blind christian so-called christians
[1:02:28] was behind that thinking that that is
[1:02:31] god and
[1:02:32] this is the lord and whatnot i mean go
[1:02:34] go raise up pharaoh and put fear on
[1:02:35] goku do we business you understand but
[1:02:38] the thing about it
[1:02:39] power belongs to god and god once shines
[1:02:42] with character
[1:02:43] and this is why it has been so long like
[1:02:46] daniel says
[1:02:47] the vision was true but the time was
[1:02:49] long
[1:02:50] we have been waiting a long time but
[1:02:52] we're still waiting
[1:02:53] because god can't lie and what god
[1:02:56] promised we have to see it materialize
[1:02:58] in true manifestation well let me hear
[1:03:01] the worms
[1:03:01] here now all right said that
[1:03:05] another thing it brings justification by
[1:03:07] faith believe in moses one
[1:03:09] egypt signification following the pillar
[1:03:11] of fire
[1:03:12] torment now what is the land promise to
[1:03:16] the new testament believer
[1:03:17] okay so we said the old testament what
[1:03:20] is the land promised to the new
[1:03:23] testament believer
[1:03:25] i fight for ministers a bunch of men
[1:03:28] no a man from america was the land
[1:03:31] promised
[1:03:32] the promise here we go is the holy
[1:03:34] spirit
[1:03:35] and then he quotes scripture you see it
[1:03:36] has to go back to the bible it shall
[1:03:38] come to pass
[1:03:39] in the last days i will pour my spirit
[1:03:41] upon our flesh your sons and daughters
[1:03:42] shall prophesy
[1:03:44] upon my handmaidens and my man's
[1:03:45] servants i poured my spirit
[1:03:47] and they shall prophesy and so on and so
[1:03:49] on and peter said repent every one of
[1:03:51] you and be baptized
[1:03:52] and and so on did you notice here we go
[1:03:55] joshua this is joshua before they close
[1:03:59] jordan
[1:04:01] so now another thing comes to equation
[1:04:03] now not only have they come out
[1:04:06] not only there's a willingness journey
[1:04:08] but now we end up
[1:04:09] with this thing called j o j-o-r-d-a-m
[1:04:11] jordan
[1:04:13] jordan people would like to talk about
[1:04:15] it they like to talk about when the
[1:04:16] press comes down but you don't pull them
[1:04:18] like a bit of soul
[1:04:20] they're looking for any press to come
[1:04:21] now no jordan
[1:04:23] they're not given power but no
[1:04:24] willingness you know jesus
[1:04:27] he he when he received the spirit his
[1:04:29] dynamics
[1:04:30] in fullness he was led by the spirit
[1:04:33] into the wilderness to overcome the lust
[1:04:36] of the eyes
[1:04:38] lust of the flesh and the pride of life
[1:04:40] so jesus knew
[1:04:42] he he he he he have the devil on the
[1:04:45] iran
[1:04:46] jesus knew the devil had nothing on him
[1:04:48] he couldn't tempt him with lust in the
[1:04:50] flesh
[1:04:50] he couldn't break him up with the rest
[1:04:52] of the eyes and he couldn't destroy my
[1:04:53] pride of life
[1:04:54] the last one is very dangerous all these
[1:04:58] kingdoms are mine i'll give it to you
[1:04:59] you don't have to go to calvary
[1:05:01] it's okay because just preach mysteries
[1:05:03] you don't have to die
[1:05:05] you have no cross they have no cross no
[1:05:07] dino
[1:05:08] just pump that wood and you will be fine
[1:05:11] jesus said no he was ready to go for you
[1:05:14] and i
[1:05:15] to pay the price and if he had a price
[1:05:17] to pay
[1:05:18] if he suffered we have to prepare to pay
[1:05:20] that price i guess you know
[1:05:23] sitting on the bench and and i'm highly
[1:05:25] bride
[1:05:26] and then catch phrases i give i mean
[1:05:28] that you know
[1:05:29] you know be our ide i i the i the bride
[1:05:33] i talk i string it all i talk
[1:05:37] it doesn't have that general sense it
[1:05:39] has this being
[1:05:41] when it's completed in this is the
[1:05:43] servant of god
[1:05:44] in a church of god it's going to rapture
[1:05:46] and that being is faith
[1:05:48] virtue knowledge temperance patience
[1:05:49] godliness brotherly kindness cut by
[1:05:51] charity
[1:05:52] that being when it's completed and we're
[1:05:54] going to rapture
[1:05:55] when you look at it closely am i
[1:05:56] frightened a little bit no i don't know
[1:05:58] necessarily
[1:06:00] when you look at it closely the rapture
[1:06:02] not coming for you you know
[1:06:06] the rapture coming from what in you he
[1:06:09] called it
[1:06:09] a magnet he said you have to be
[1:06:12] magnetized to the headstone
[1:06:13] he said you have to be magnetized to the
[1:06:15] holy ghost the rapture
[1:06:17] coming for something that could pick up
[1:06:19] with it you know like when you're magnet
[1:06:21] a big magnet to pick up all the iron
[1:06:22] filing all the little nails and things
[1:06:24] because there's some magnetism in it so
[1:06:27] you have to go in the rapture
[1:06:29] is that in you because when the magnet
[1:06:31] of the rapture
[1:06:32] or the magnet of the dynamics or the
[1:06:34] magnet of the capstone when that sweep
[1:06:36] over
[1:06:37] it picking you up you you can't help it
[1:06:39] you know you you hitting a channel you
[1:06:41] you're going right up
[1:06:42] because you have the magnetism of the
[1:06:44] holy ghost
[1:06:46] notice the holy ghost the holy ghost
[1:06:50] amen my
[1:06:53] lord my lord so there are three stages
[1:06:56] of the journey
[1:06:57] treats rages joseph by faith
[1:07:00] forsaken the land of egypt then
[1:07:03] sanctified
[1:07:04] through the offering of his blood washed
[1:07:07] from our sins that's
[1:07:08] and you'll become a situation so that
[1:07:11] journey wilderness
[1:07:12] is where god stripping sanctifying
[1:07:15] testing
[1:07:16] there was a shortcut to walk to the
[1:07:18] promised land but god was concerned
[1:07:20] if they only discovered a shortcut any
[1:07:21] issue come in that land they will run
[1:07:23] back to egypt
[1:07:24] so god said you know passed through the
[1:07:26] wilderness it's better for your spirit
[1:07:28] it's better for you to get purged and
[1:07:31] get sanctified and get cleaned up
[1:07:33] so then that journey or offering of
[1:07:36] blood
[1:07:36] washing more sins become a pilgrim
[1:07:38] sojourners claiming that we are seeking
[1:07:40] a land
[1:07:40] a city that's coming onto our promise so
[1:07:43] that's the believers
[1:07:44] uh when they come they first recognize
[1:07:46] their favor as a sinner then they come
[1:07:47] by the washington water by the word
[1:07:49] justified by faith and then afterwards
[1:07:52] now he said you become a journey
[1:07:54] a surgeon and a pilgrim that is why it's
[1:07:56] very sad
[1:07:57] when people give up on the journey then
[1:08:00] because yeah richie promised yet
[1:08:01] he's on a journey to what a promise that
[1:08:03] god made see after me a promise that god
[1:08:05] made
[1:08:06] that is what you journey into you're not
[1:08:08] journeying to sani grande you're not
[1:08:10] journeying
[1:08:10] to some church your journey into a
[1:08:12] promise that god has made
[1:08:14] here we go israel had not yet received a
[1:08:17] promise
[1:08:18] but they were on their journey oh
[1:08:21] hallelujah
[1:08:22] please understand and that is where you
[1:08:24] pilgrim and nazarene holiness and
[1:08:25] whatnot
[1:08:26] fell because israel when they come to
[1:08:28] this spot of kinishbaniya
[1:08:30] when the spies went over and said the
[1:08:31] land is great but some of them come back
[1:08:33] and said we can't take it because the
[1:08:35] cities are walled up
[1:08:36] and just one kilo said we are more than
[1:08:38] able to take it oh my
[1:08:40] he said watch something now so what they
[1:08:42] they too
[1:08:43] went over to the promised land had
[1:08:45] brought back evidence it was a goody
[1:08:46] land
[1:08:47] and we are more unable to take it
[1:08:48] because it was god's sponge then instead
[1:08:50] of people here we go there we go
[1:08:52] stay with me instead of people going on
[1:08:54] receiving the holy spirit
[1:08:56] speaking their tongues you know if they
[1:08:58] start to speak in tongues message they
[1:08:59] will say is then the gosselin
[1:09:02] but that's part of it too speaking in
[1:09:04] tongues receiving the power
[1:09:06] of god the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:09:07] signs wonders miracles
[1:09:09] they felt it would break down the
[1:09:11] tradition of
[1:09:12] doctrine and what happened to it they
[1:09:15] perished in the land that's right
[1:09:16] but the believers here we go as you the
[1:09:19] caleb and joshua
[1:09:20] outfit that was going on to the promise
[1:09:23] they moved over into the land and took
[1:09:26] the land here we go
[1:09:27] and settle down in the land as a
[1:09:29] possession oh glory to god give the lord
[1:09:31] a shout tonight
[1:09:32] they went and take it over set along in
[1:09:35] it and take it as a possession
[1:09:37] let's go to the new testament now let's
[1:09:39] go to peter
[1:09:40] okay peter denied christ cry ball he run
[1:09:44] hide and everything else okay he hit up
[1:09:46] a room holy ghost hit peter
[1:09:48] peter said these people are drunk as you
[1:09:49] suppose well the brandon says
[1:09:51] lucy for the devil when they reported
[1:09:53] them imps
[1:09:54] sent a report down to hell that peter
[1:09:56] and them just rejoicing and carrying on
[1:09:58] he said please kind of they were excited
[1:10:00] forget them all right
[1:10:02] now what the devil didn't understand
[1:10:05] then
[1:10:06] was it wasn't excitement it wasn't just
[1:10:09] emotion
[1:10:10] peter actually came into a possession
[1:10:15] and that possession was evident now
[1:10:17] listen carefully
[1:10:18] when peter gave this sermon and said um
[1:10:21] repent every one of you and be baptized
[1:10:23] in the name of jesus christ that is the
[1:10:26] word
[1:10:27] you see no evidence of possession yet i
[1:10:30] just saw man
[1:10:31] that i just were there's a man talking
[1:10:33] on a platform
[1:10:35] but when he went to the gate called
[1:10:36] beautiful and saw that man that was
[1:10:39] crippled that everybody knew was ripple
[1:10:41] and he said hold a book
[1:10:44] he said come on yeah tape he didn't say

[1:11:44] and your seed that is the land for them
[1:11:47] we didn't ask god for holy ghost promise
[1:11:50] we didn't ask god for adoption
[1:11:51] he made that promise and if he made that
[1:11:54] promise
[1:11:54] he is able to keep it if he made that
[1:11:57] promise

[1:11:59] able to bring you to perfection he is
[1:12:01] god

[1:12:18] here
[1:12:20] the believers as you equally caleb and
[1:12:23] joshua outfit
[1:12:24] that was going on to the promise they
[1:12:26] moved on over into the land
[1:12:28] and took the land and settled down in
[1:12:30] the land
[1:12:31] as a possession we never stop at
[1:12:33] justification
[1:12:34] sanification let us go on this is about
[1:12:37] the brand to the baptism of the spirit
[1:12:40] why this has not been emphasized we hear
[1:12:43] mysteries
[1:12:44] hidden mysteries more mysteries
[1:12:46] mysteries in mysteries out missionary
[1:12:48] side mission to the left
[1:12:50] these divine reveal mystery truths here
[1:12:53] but watch
[1:12:54] let us never stop at justification
[1:12:56] sanification
[1:12:57] let's go on to the baptism of the holy
[1:12:59] spirit let's not stop at believing lord
[1:13:01] jesus being baptized
[1:13:02] let's not stop because he penis on my
[1:13:04] life for sin but now here we go
[1:13:06] we press on into opposition
[1:13:09] to a promise of the baptism he goes now
[1:13:12] this he's not talking about kentucky
[1:13:13] consulting
[1:13:14] for peter said in their pentecost for
[1:13:16] their promises unto you
[1:13:18] and to your children to them that are
[1:13:19] far off even as many
[1:13:21] as the lord of gosh our core are going
[1:13:23] to skip them
[1:13:24] he says talk about the woman when
[1:13:26] they're having the child and
[1:13:27] positionally placing them by their labor
[1:13:29] pains and so on
[1:13:30] and they groan and say ephraim mana say
[1:13:33] and the mothers was groaning
[1:13:34] and as the one has grown in they called
[1:13:35] names and they were calling their name
[1:13:37] and was positionally placing them in the
[1:13:39] land and then he said this here now
[1:13:41] he says now watch how that god had set
[1:13:43] some in the church truly by pain so if
[1:13:45] you think the believers alone are the
[1:13:46] good true europeans here what you say
[1:13:47] about the ministers now
[1:13:49] he said oh they get tremendous sometimes
[1:13:51] you say when our church has grown and
[1:13:52] under the prosecution of the outside
[1:13:54] world well i know i preach this and we
[1:13:56] hear this so many times but you hate it
[1:13:57] again tonight
[1:13:58] because it's still good it's still fresh
[1:14:00] it's still from under she kind of glory
[1:14:01] it's still applicable because this still
[1:14:03] hasn't come to pass
[1:14:04] when the church has grown in under what
[1:14:06] under the press
[1:14:08] no under the prosecution of the outside
[1:14:09] world watch believing on the lord jesus
[1:14:12] that watch that the promise of the holy
[1:14:15] ghost
[1:14:16] is just as real to us as it was the
[1:14:19] pentecost
[1:14:20] why did ghosts and the prophets again to
[1:14:21] turn us back to faith of the fathers
[1:14:23] what was the face of the fathers the
[1:14:24] holy ghost
[1:14:25] are they their pentacles that the holy
[1:14:26] ghost just as real as it was to them as
[1:14:29] their pentecost how they groan
[1:14:30] and cry under labor pains let us
[1:14:34] labor to enter into that rest
[1:14:37] if you sit back you will sit back and
[1:14:39] you'll be comfortable
[1:14:41] but man you're heading straight for
[1:14:43] tribulation without sitting back
[1:14:44] you have to groan and cry in the labor
[1:14:46] pains and when they are born
[1:14:47] unpositionally born into the kingdom of
[1:14:49] god
[1:14:50] then the holy ghost are set in the
[1:14:53] church
[1:14:54] some apostles some prophets some
[1:14:56] teachers some pastors
[1:14:57] some evangelists and he says gives him
[1:15:00] to dear speaking in tongues
[1:15:01] interpretation
[1:15:02] of tongues knowledge wisdom gifts of
[1:15:04] healing all kind of miracles
[1:15:05] so friends he didn't say a man passing a
[1:15:07] long time
[1:15:08] god said that him there's a man passing
[1:15:11] a long time
[1:15:12] a man preaching a long time it's when
[1:15:14] the holy ghost sets in the church that's
[1:15:16] different
[1:15:17] that's not man saying i'm a person you
[1:15:18] know what how long a pastor you know 36
[1:15:20] years
[1:15:20] you're a pastor no you're fine you're
[1:15:22] doing the work of a pastor
[1:15:24] but until the holy set that man he said
[1:15:26] wait him
[1:15:27] the holy ghost have to set the church
[1:15:29] the holy ghost have to place his sons
[1:15:30] the holy ghost placed jesus
[1:15:32] the holy ghost placed peter the holy
[1:15:34] ghost placed paul they took my tires to

[1:16:21] don't sometime i i
[1:16:22] i'll bring something else he said no
[1:16:24] what's something now
[1:16:25] after you're in after you get in this
[1:16:28] land
[1:16:29] that don't mean you're free from war
[1:16:34] you're fighting getting oh god glory
[1:16:36] hallelujah and i get to
[1:16:37] say oh rocking chair hammock
[1:16:41] come on whether watch it you know them
[1:16:43] kill the knight and then jeb beside
[1:16:45] from that other city they come in fear
[1:16:48] you're not free from oil
[1:16:50] you say you still have to fight here we
[1:16:52] go saints for
[1:16:53] every inch of ground you stand on
[1:16:57] so canaan did not represent the great
[1:17:00] heaven
[1:17:01] because it is war and troubles and
[1:17:03] killings and fightings
[1:17:04] but it represents this it must be a
[1:17:07] perfect walk
[1:17:08] and here's where the church is feeling
[1:17:09] today on that walk do you know that your
[1:17:11] own behavior can knock somebody
[1:17:13] else others from getting healed your
[1:17:16] misbehavior of unconfessed sins of you
[1:17:18] believers
[1:17:18] can cause this church to basically feel
[1:17:20] at their judgment you'll be responsible
[1:17:22] for every bit of it now wait a minute by
[1:17:23] the banner
[1:17:24] that's what you think of it and he
[1:17:26] talked about how joshua
[1:17:27] and they had no a thing until akan came
[1:17:30] around and
[1:17:31] and they lost 16 men just was just
[1:17:33] stopped wait a minute something wrong
[1:17:35] and he says oh my they call the day of
[1:17:38] prayer and fast
[1:17:39] go made a promise there'll be nothing
[1:17:41] hurt us our enemies will fall at our
[1:17:42] feet
[1:17:43] something is wrong somewhere we got 60
[1:17:45] men dead they are israelite brothers
[1:17:47] they are dead
[1:17:48] and isaac preached a tremendous message
[1:17:50] we prayed sometime how many more men
[1:17:51] must die
[1:17:52] how many must die why did they die
[1:17:54] innocent men
[1:17:55] because one man stepped out of line you
[1:17:58] see
[1:17:58] the reason this needs to be taught the
[1:18:00] church lining up
[1:18:02] line up with the word line up with god
[1:18:05] line up with each other
[1:18:06] i like that line up with the word line
[1:18:08] up with god
[1:18:09] i line up with each other let me say
[1:18:11] that again that's something so sweet
[1:18:12] line up with the word
[1:18:13] line up with god line up with each other
[1:18:16] walking
[1:18:17] perfectly upright soberly before all men
[1:18:20] fearing god because one man stole the
[1:18:22] garment and done something that he
[1:18:24] should not have done took the life of
[1:18:26] sixteen men
[1:18:28] now the book of ephesians i'm closer
[1:18:29] this year the book of ephesians
[1:18:33] places positionally in christ what
[1:18:36] there was in the holy land we are placed
[1:18:40] not in the holy land but in the holy
[1:18:42] ghost
[1:18:43] so the object of this gospel the object
[1:18:46] of this
[1:18:47] notice the book was just a book with
[1:18:49] names the book was sealed
[1:18:52] and that sealed represents a finished
[1:18:54] work
[1:18:55] and that book also represents you
[1:18:58] because you too will be sealed
[1:19:00] sealed with seven seals seven perfect
[1:19:02] spirits
[1:19:03] sealed in your life you'll be sealed on
[1:19:05] the inside
[1:19:06] but seven patent nature of the holy
[1:19:09] ghost of god
[1:19:10] and then all he waiting for is a fire
[1:19:11] baptism to change your body
[1:19:14] in a moment in a trigger of an eye there
[1:19:16] is a rapture
[1:19:17] a power on the inside oh my god the holy
[1:19:20] ghost on the inside
[1:19:22] and a paw coming around your body your
[1:19:24] body inside
[1:19:25] inside that that that vortex and
[1:19:29] your body being changed in a moment that
[1:19:30] picture of an eye let's
[1:19:32] oh here's i trust the night that the
[1:19:34] lord spoke to you
[1:19:37] god can't lie god love his people
[1:19:41] but he loves his word because the word
[1:19:43] is him
[1:19:44] and if you speak a word he's got to
[1:19:45] bring that with the past and keep that
[1:19:47] word
[1:19:48] it's not him who start many people start
[1:19:51] in this message
[1:19:53] what is how many gonna finish many
[1:19:55] people come out
[1:19:57] how many have gone in nobody could go in
[1:20:00] and start to talk about
[1:20:01] my pastor and my this and my man and my
[1:20:04] church
[1:20:04] you can't go in and talk that talk but
[1:20:06] once you go in
[1:20:08] you'll be glorifying jesus christ
[1:20:10] because when the adoption power came on
[1:20:12] that mountain
[1:20:14] and they said there's been a tabernacle
[1:20:15] for moses and elias and whatnot a voice
[1:20:18] come and says
[1:20:20] shut up don't go that way no one
[1:20:22] glorifying my old man
[1:20:24] is glorified in jesus christ the
[1:20:27] adoption anointing
[1:20:28] here we go only glorifies jesus christ
[1:20:32] i want to say it again the adoption
[1:20:35] anointing
[1:20:37] cannot glorify any man be pastor
[1:20:40] prophet teacher evangelist apostle
[1:20:44] the adoption anointing only glorifies
[1:20:46] jesus christ
[1:20:48] the seven angels form a cloud 26 miles
[1:20:52] high and so on
[1:20:53] okay when god told the prophet
[1:20:56] are you looking at it right turn the
[1:20:59] picture
[1:21:00] turned the picture to the right or when
[1:21:03] he turned the picture to the right
[1:21:05] it wasn't seven it was jesus the face of
[1:21:08] jesus
[1:21:10] all the revelations all the thunders and
[1:21:13] the seals and the mysteries
[1:21:15] when it finally come into this correct
[1:21:17] position
[1:21:18] you have to see jesus christ let us bow
[1:21:21] heads
[1:21:22] almighty god jesus christ is a hidden
[1:21:25] mystery
[1:21:26] and paul identified christ in you the
[1:21:29] hope of glory
[1:21:30] father it might have been chopped up
[1:21:32] since november i had to
[1:21:35] this kind of appeared and you showed me
[1:21:38] what
[1:21:38] how to laid out and i did just what i
[1:21:41] felt that you wanted me to do to present
[1:21:44] to your people
[1:21:45] from the journey how you were not
[1:21:47] pleased with many of them
[1:21:48] with their behavior and their attitude
[1:21:50] and they were overthrown in the
[1:21:51] wilderness
[1:21:52] what happened afterwards lord we are 50
[1:21:55] plus years
[1:21:56] still waiting on that promise won't you
[1:21:59] release it tonight
[1:22:00] won't you put a burden upon the people's
[1:22:02] heart to seek you
[1:22:04] with their whole heart lord oh god many
[1:22:06] have come out
[1:22:08] but we have to go in lord go in and
[1:22:10] possess

[1:22:27] serving the living god
[1:22:28] who comes down and confirm his word
[1:22:30] father
[1:22:31] i pray in simplicity tonight that your
[1:22:34] presence would
[1:22:35] saturate and move into the homes

[1:22:41] sick minister to them and heal them
[1:22:43] if they don't trodden me or raise them

[1:22:49] that rich assurance
[1:22:51] that you start to work in them is able

[1:22:54] and bring it to fruition father oh god
[1:22:56] you said i'm the vine you are the
[1:22:58] branches
[1:22:59] although you're checking to see what
[1:23:00] we're producing
[1:23:02] you're checking to see if you produce
[1:23:04] anything or any branch that doesn't
[1:23:05] produce
[1:23:05] you're cut off and any branch i produce
[1:23:08] you purge that they could produce much
[1:23:11] fruit here and it's my father
[1:23:13] glorified you want us to be fruit
[1:23:14] bearing lord not just
[1:23:16] barren not just static but fruit bearing

[1:23:21] your people will get clarity by what was
[1:23:23] shared tonight of ephesians
[1:23:25] of joshua of the promise of the hour of
[1:23:28] the holy spirit
[1:23:29] and what it all means coming out of
[1:23:31] going into
[1:23:32] that full redemption although we know
[1:23:35] that when the last
[1:23:36] name on the book is redeemed the book is
[1:23:40] closed
[1:23:41] not the last person to get a tape or a
[1:23:43] tablet or a book
[1:23:44] that's not what the prophet talked about
[1:23:46] he's speaking about the last name on the
[1:23:48] book
[1:23:49] that has been redeemed there has to be
[1:23:51] this message of redemption
[1:23:53] that closed this age that closed the
[1:23:55] chapter of our lives
[1:23:57] and we ourselves are sealed into the
