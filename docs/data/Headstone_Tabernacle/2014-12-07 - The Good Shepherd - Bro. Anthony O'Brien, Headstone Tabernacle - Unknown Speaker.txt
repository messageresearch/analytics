praise god it's good to be back i bring greetings from ghana and i went to do with a funeral service across there and what an experience i had kind of mind blowing the respects among the people the order and everything else i had quite an experience in africa one i will never forget and they don't have much went way in the country area four was dirt road and so on and so on real we call real country africa and to see this brother who passed on to be with the lord he was muslim before and you know he got on victory he went and saw the picture in somebody's home asked about it got the books read the books and he converted from a muslim to christianity and his whole family got converted and so on and liver transformed life but people in university to be converted there was a professor that was there to testify of when he came to her and asked her you want to make an appointment to see her and she thought was something wrong and then he lay all the books on a table begin to break it and so on and she's still there after so much 30 years or whatnot she's still there and all him thankful to god for this testimony and it is such a powerful thing and how they treat the elderly across there so on my it's such an admirable sort of thing i just love it it was such a great experience so it's it's good to be back home there's no place like home and uh there's something about when coming home something coming home and i think guess when god children come home is something about his children coming home and i was thinking the other day the thousand years is just one day with the lord so 70 years is not even a good half a half an hour two hours so god say see you in two hours time you know i'm here i mean that's not a long time we go through time we go through days we go three years but my god eternity is unfolding it's not right it's good to be here this morning oh praise god well we have a mighty man of valor to preach you this morning i'll be preaching to you this evening but have a mighty man of allah here young man a joshua warrior hallelujah praise god amen today god bless you praise god uh will you have a genuine gift from god and uh november the 16th how many men must die and what a message god bless you but isaac tremendous message it's a message that came with a burden it brought back to the scriptural god to god which the people people people don't know the god of the bible they have other gods see like the poor peace of god the how much millions catholic church he dreamed about the preaching bible he just have to do another sign like that and where they had the way they had the sword and he said papa and he that's fine you see that you know everybody have their own thing you know i mean but we our god is the word that's right our god is not you know a kind of being that does operate when we feel like operating him you know i mean we don't get him to do things he's a god that brings a word and his word can't return void he's a goddess confirm his word and vindicate his word that's the god we serve we save a living god and it appears as if things are silent god loves it that way to see how we're going to behave to see how we're going to react only just that he keeps silent no signs no wonders no miracles no power no display of anything just raw word you say you're a believer i'm giving you my word praise god the word is god i've given you my word i'm gonna test you to see if you will stay with the world and as you finish the test i'm gonna vindicate you and positionally place you by your stand on the word how the word is god and if the devil couldn't move us all these years off the word the devil is finished the devil is a liar the devil can't do anything he is paralyzed by chains of circumstance because he can't get us off of the word all give the lord some praises hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh glory hallelujah you may be seated and when god finally gets sons and daughters that gonna come mature enough to take the word the devil is finished because every time the devil get away is somebody going off the word that's the only way the devil could move in you see a lie have to be enabled when the deep when the devil came to even said you shall not surely die eve gonna tell the devil go and smoke marijuana if you want don't come with that you know i'm saying then and here's the pack-up shop and go back with his stories but she believed it and enabled it and that's why it was empowered are you with me now so when they're developing the word off of the word as long as you don't believe it the devil is defeated if you don't believe or receive the devil eye in other words federal express fedex bring watch a package for you with your name and there are snakes in it what the problem said you don't receive it you don't sign fair you don't care who send it you don't care if your name is on it you have to sign it to receive it that's what we're talking about and when god send a package for you you got to sign it to receive it come on now you better sign in this morning you got to put your name on it this is mines oh give the law some praises so we welcome each one of you here amen again and also we're going to welcome those who connected on the internet those who would hear the message you want to say god bless you amen how many men must die and that message was a tremendous message to me it challenges you to get right and get straightened up because brother branham said unconfessing could hinder people being healed in match the match the church must be marching in order order of the word then november 23 give me a true token and that was a tremendous message and you see what the holy spirit is bringing to these brethren just a word isn't that right get the token i want a true token have a cry in your heart i have to have that blood cord because the dead angel will come in and the angel have to see that black cord is not right then november 30th positionally please before the turbo plague strike i like the title of the message love the message watch it's the same thing give me a token i've got to get the token i've got to be positionally placed before the space strike because the plagues are coming i was telling the permit and that russia says putin said nobody will be uh will be more powerful than russia militarily and he will not allow it so russia is ready but i'm talking about when russia moved into the position where they are at and they're in position the question is will the bride be in her position so just before but anthony come just a few thoughts i want to share with you i want to read from exodus chapter 3 and moses kept the flock of jesus father-in-law the priest of million he led the flock to the backside of the desert and came to the mountain of god even to horeb and the angel of the lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush and he looked and behold the bush burned with fire and the bush was not consumed and moses said i will now turn aside and see this great sight why the bush is not burnt and when the lord saw that he turned aside to see and you got to turn aside to see you you've got you can't just be going going going you got to take a pause to turn aside to see what god is doing to see what god is unfolding when the lord saw he turned aside to see isn't that right that the bush was not consumed seized right why there was a and the lord saw it and said god called unto him out of the midst of the bush and said moses moses he said here am i and he said draw not tether put off your shoes from off your feet for the place wherein those standards is holy ground moreover he said i am hear the introduction i am the god of thy father the god of abraham the god of god calling names god calling historical references to give him pointers this is no other god this is the god of abraham of isaac praise god and god had to break it down for him isn't that right hallelujah and of god of jacob and moses hid his face and he was afraid to look upon god and the lord said i have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in egypt and i've heard they cry by reason of their task masters and i and i like that word task masters that is masters who come to give a task task masters like that word there and he hear the cry of your taskmasters you don't want to do it but the taskmasters beat you to do it and force you to do it and push you to do it you're under taskmasters you're being driven to do this and driven god here when you cry you have to have a cry because god wants to break the whip of the taskmaster god want to deal with the task master heard the cries of the task master and i know their sorrows and i come down to deliver them out of the hand of the egyptians and to bring them up out of that land listen he didn't just come down to deliver them he said i'm coming down to deliver to bring you to a position that you could be positionally placed hallelujah what land what lane are you talking about watch watch and i come to deliver them out of the land of the egyptians and to bring them up out of that land onto a good land a land flowing milk and honey unto the place of the king and i see that i tell them where they're going the canaanites they are there the hittites they are they also the amorites they are also there the parasites and heterosites they are all there but that's your land i'm not hearing you this morning either came with demons or dear god said he called you out not to just come out but to go on to a possession glory to god how many believe that this morning all right you're gonna be seated it's not much so here we go now so therefore your profession of what god says is not your possession that's you professing that god told me this land is mines but now you have to go and take it you have to go and possess it isn't that right so god heard the cry behold the cry of the church of israel is come unto me i've seen the oppression and so on so that's what i want to get to you because an exhorted uh permission on tuesday night it was a great time there and i asked a question if the first exodus had a crime and signed and growing and travailing and the second exodus had grown in a travail in the upper room for so many days what about the tweet exit us but abandoned prophesied he said wait till a little group go to calling on god there'll be a national showdown so in other words there's got to come something to drag the church into desperation then he said love supposed to get you desperate but if love doesn't get you desperate conditions will so god have flipped the burger anyhow you're going to get the same result in other words they've got to have a condition or love to get the people desperate if love is not doing it then conditions will come around your life that will get you desperate that you have no other way to go but to look up and cry out and cry alone and cry unto god that god can say that i have heard the cries of my people because as an angel have a vial full of old oars which are the prayers of the saints so as you pray your vow is being filled up as you pray the vile is being filled up and one of these days god will take all your prayers all your tears all your weeping all your groaning all your travailing are you gonna take it and put it on the altar and they're gonna be lightning thunders and voices angels will be dispatched to deliver your loved ones angels will be dispatched to deliver your family angels will be dispatched because of the prayers of the saints listen your prayer is not in vain oh hallelujah you're not any and anybody you are his people i have heard the cries of my people you may be seated praise god the child is sick you pray and the child says say keep on praying hallelujah keep on believing son is backstabbing keep on believing praise god the devil could keep them so much and no longer the only option so much he could keep them only after so much he can find them but when they all come to be free he said i have come down to deliver go and tell pharaoh let my people go hallelujah glory to god amen so one more thing one of the one makota and i'm gonna close here but abandon from god identifying himself by his characteristics he said we find that this prophet run away was in the wilderness for 40 years it taken pharaoh 40 years to drill an education under him it took god 40 years to drill it out of him drilling andrew so we find one day he was in the backs of the desert meet the lord god in a burning bush in the form of a pillar of fire laying in the bush he was asked to take off his shoes the ground he was standing was holy now look at this fine cultured educated man that watched the changing of his characteristics when he met god sometimes god does things in such a simple way such a foolish way to the canal thinking here we go notice a man who has been a total failure here you guys are hallelujah speaking about moses a man who had been a total failure and all the egyptian armies everything around to do the will of god with all the education at the age of 40 years old in his prime and yeah he is eight years old the next morning with his wife sitting straight on the mule and young one on the hip stick in hand going up to egypt to take over you talk about a ridiculous sight but that was displaying the characteristics of god so you mean god can take a total failure and still use him and still send them of course that's the god we serve you mean that same man that killed a man yes that same man wanted in egypt yes that becomes god's man because fire fell on him go down and tell pharaoh i am not telling anybody else i'm sending you who he yes he no i don't believe that you don't have to but if god sent it god will vindicate it god's going to prove it what a mighty god we serve let's turn and give god some praises oh glory to god hallelujah thank you jesus let's sing we walk in the light that beautiful light as i want to turn around greet somebody we in the light such a beauty for life comes where around us one more time we walk in the light when we oh oh lift your

is christ hallelujah isn't that right praise god isn't that right okay hallelujah hallelujah amen so he's jesus isn't that right jesus here he identifies himself as a good shepherd according to saint john 10 let me find that back here real quick amen praise god i like to read from the scripture amen hallelujah it just jumps right out of the pages this morning because the word is alive jesus is alive this morning hallelujah on your understanding and this season is being opened this morning to recognize who you are who god is and who the devil is this morning hallelujah he is as a roaring

the good shepherd isn't that right hallelujah okay let me let me back up amen from verse one he says very very i say unto you he that entered not by the door into the sheepfold but climb it up some other way the same as a thief and a rubber oh now what a mystery and even isaac was talking last week about that open door he said behold i have set before you an open door hey man and that door is the holy ghost and only through that door you can have access to all the blessings that are inside and jesus said i am the door any man coming any other way he is a thief and he is a robber he come to steal to rob and to destroy isn't that right that's the spirit of satan trying to destroy the sheep of god throughout all the ages he's tried to do the same thing you don't think he'll try to do it now but if he could cut you off he would but the good shepherd is here this morning fear not this morning he come with his staff this morning to lead his people out and into the promised land give the

hallelujah how that makes you give you a heart for the sheep oh isn't that right isn't that right hey man hallelujah hallelujah why a shepherd why use a shepherd as a reference isn't that right jesus identifies himself as a shepherd what is a shepherd a shepherd is someone who knows the prophet said how to take care of sheep isn't that right all he knows is sheep he said that's all his concern the prophet even going to say he looked like she sometimes smelled like she sometimes he talked like the sheep but he knows his sheep he's not concerned with mathematics he's not concerned with arithmetic he's not concerned with science he's not concerned how to explain it all he knows is the sheep of god hallelujah isn't that right and all god is concerned about this morning is his sheep he knows his sheep ever since man fell in the beginning isn't that right god has made a plan and the entire plan is to bring man back into his position to bring the sheep back into the sheep full that's been the plan all along to get man back into the place where he had for him to be isn't that right isn't that right hallelujah hallelujah because then adam and eve was in the garden of eden he created an eden a garden called leader amen isn't that right amen and there they dwelt in green pastures they ate to the fruits of the trees they enjoyed the splendor they spoke and this happened they enjoy the animals they enjoy the birds they enjoy the bees they enjoy the cool crystal streams of water they enjoyed all the goodness and the blessings of god but when they were smitten amen hallelujah when sin come into the picture it drove them out from the sheep full isn't that right they ended up in the wilderness they ended up in affliction in pain eve brought four children just as god had said from his mouth isn't that right hallelujah but god's promise was always to bring them back to eden back to the sheepfold back to the place where all the blessings are back to the holy ghost back to goodness back to love back to peace back to joy back to the holy ghost back to heavenly places in christ heavenly places is a believer's position in christ that's where the heavenly places are and the only way to get to heavenly places it's for you to get back into your position same as somebody same as somebody god doesn't want for you to be in wanting to be in need to be hungry jesus said blessed are they that hunger and this for they shall be fair this is god's desire god would not want for you to be go to go unwanted holiday to go empty to go empty-handed no no no god loves you too much isn't that right i'll just see you go empty to see you go hungry to see you go starving god's got a meal for you in the barrel oil in the cruise every sunday every thursday there's a meal in the power oh hallelujah hallelujah oh praise god amen amen hallelujah god bless you on the internet amen praise god we've got a group that's hooked in this morning amen hallelujah hallelujah praise god amen bring greetings to you amen praise blessed be the name of the lord amen praise god do you love him this morning hey many many men so that's a concern of a shepherd there's not a lot in it it's not over thunk there's not no maths and science and history and geography and all these great things sure that's fine and god knows all things but his concern is for the sheep he's got a book come on now with a book of names a book of sheep and in each age there were sheep scattered all throughout the earth and in every age he sent a messenger i sent a messenger a shepherd hallelujah to go out and search his sheep isn't that right in luther's day he sent a shepherd a shepherd named martin luther hallelujah and he put his word and spirit in that shepherd he put something in that shepherd to have concern for the sheep of that day isn't that right and that shepherd went out and said the joshua led by fate and when he made that call when he made that call i led the good shepherd that was vail and martin luther i'll begin to call the sheep in that day and all the people in the lutheran in the lutheran age we're gonna come out sheep come from here come from there come from everywhere all out of the catholic church they were sheep scattered throughout all the earth but god was doing the calling god was doing the choosing god is doing the pulling from this person and from that person he began to call his sheep same as somebody into the sheep full isn't that right then wesley come along god sent another shepherd and he began to call some names you shall not be justified but you shall be signified also and he began to do some calling and he went to this church he went to that highway he went to that byway preaching the word of god bringing liberty to the captive bringing a preaching a message of sanification and calling the sheep of god that were in that age isn't that right hallelujah who was it jesus christ the good shepherd he was failing these men doing the calling isn't that right and then he come along here come brother branham hallelujah 1946 1965 what was it it was a good shepherd failed in a cindy sunderland in a son of man doing the calling calling from the east and from the west and from the north and from the south it was a call allah isn't that right the shout of the king was going out and when that shot call went out there was sheep to respond to that call so you're not here by chance this morning same as somebody same as somebody you are not an accident it was a shock call i went out i had to gather you from all parts of the earth that's why

matter to me but the shepherd know the sheep so long you know everyone by name you can tell this one has walked this way he could tell this one to talk this way this one have a certain way that it goes he could put this sheep in this place and he'd be happy he knows the sheep so well he knows them all by name it could be 200 sheep it could be 500 sheep he knows all of the sheep and every morning he does a head count and if there's 499 sheep and if there's one sheep mission he's got to go after that sheep doesn't matter how far that sheep went come on now same as saying man somebody not one shall be left behind that's the heart of god this morning that's the heart of jesus christ this morning to go after every sheep he knows his sheep this morning we'll see him and somebody hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah you forget all the rest and go after that one sometimes they're caught in the phones sometimes the quotes on the tickets isn't that right sometimes the cares of life wrap their arm bonds around you sometimes you stray a little far too away from the line sometimes you cross the line the border and the threshold between the sheep full and the worldly things isn't that right hallelujah hallelujah but the good shepherd is here this morning he knows who you are this morning he hears your cry this morning as long as you begin to cry he hears the cries of his people there's something about a sheep's cry it's a bleating kind of kind of screaming kind of hollering kind of praise god hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah it's a painful sound it's a mournful sound when a sheep is in distress when a sheep go to cry when a sheep go to screaming when a sheep go to hollering on the altar it's a kind of a cry it's a kind of a scream from the hearts oh god forsake me

voice a stranger's voice they will not follow and when a sheep is in a certain condition doesn't matter where it is it'll get to crying it'll get to bleating because it's uncomfortable and you can't stay uncomfortable out there in the world oh that way there's no food where there's no warmth where there's no shelter where there's darkness you can't feel comfortable in that environment something

is the word the word the word the word the word of grace god the word was god and the word became flesh and dwelt among them that's all they know and they received the greatest message that messiah was on the earth now hallelujah praise god glory god gave them the greatest message the prophet said there were great trained men in that day i have it here i could read it he said they were great trained men in that day there were great pharisees that were looking for the coming of the messiah they were looking for jesus they were looking for the same baby that was to be born in a manger that's the real christmas message not santa claus but at the coming christ christ was coming on the earth isn't that rich and we have a true christmas message this morning messiah is on here now the shadow of the king is in the camp and the voice of the archangel will be veiled in our flightful ministry the great shepherd the good shepherd to call the sheep of god in this hour in this season and this time before those terrible plagues strike amen hallelujah oh isn't that right glory to god hallelujah hey man amen oh hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right ain't many man okay let me read tamar amen why it had to be shepherds paragraph 25. amen so this is close to christmas amen this is the 12th amen isn't that right please god it's a preacher on the same time here or out of the 21st of december rather 1964. why it had to be shepherd he said notice angels coming angels coming and giving their message to a man of such low estate when there were men much more earthly thought of qualified than these poor illiterate shepherds the shepherd was the most illiterate of anybody he didn't know anything he didn't know nothing but just about his sheep he didn't need to know mathematics he didn't know how to split an atom he didn't need no scholarship come on now he just needed to know his sheep hallelujah isn't that right praise god amen he said that's all that he needed to know and the god of great wisdom the fountain and resource of all wisdom who would choose such a person as that person amen and bypass all the well-trained scholars that's trained to know that trained to know that it speaks one thing he said that they were trained in the wrong field he said they passed passing up all the importance of the land there were the important people great teachers cyphers the high priest many other great men all israel's mighty learned all the denominations and all the boasting theologians he said god bypass every one of them he said no that's god's wisdom isn't that right the wisdom of god is foolishness to man amen and the wisdom of man is god's foolishness isn't that right and it was god's wisdom to bypass all the greats to bypass all the high and mighty he said i am the lofty one that dwelleth with him that have a contrite heart and a broken spirit is nourished that's who he's looking for this morning contrite hearts broken spirits humble only you don't want to know nothing else but the word of god you're not concerned with nothing else but you want the token you want the life you want the baptism of holy ghost you want to know how to live this thing you want to know how to walk right you want to know how to talk right you want to know how to live right you don't need to know mathematics come on now you don't need to know how to split an atom all you want is christ and him crucify is that what you want this morning that's what i want this morning that's what's going to take me to the rapture amen amen to know christ so simple he said notice the highest heavens hastening to the on to honor earth's most humble and unlinked the highest of heaven come down to make himself known to the lowest of the earth bypassing all between to make himself known to common herdsmen isn't that right coming to give these common herdsmen the greatest message of all time isn't that right that the god that the sadducees believe that the fantasy pharisees was talking about that same god was made flesh and dwelt among them or they beheld his glory oh i can imagine those shepherds when they heard a message when they heard those angels singing they had an experience they said we've seen something we've experienced something all these angels came with a message they told us to go to bethlehem they told us to go to a certain certain place and that we'd find a messiah in our right and these shepherds took up their staffs they took up their script bags and they got to walk in and they got to walk in praise god didn't know what they were looking for they received the message the pharisees didn't know what they were looking for they were 40 years old 50 years in the message and didn't know what they were looking for they were preaching about the sick seal preaching about the beasts preaching about the antichrist they didn't know what they were looking for but some simple little shepherds some smelly little herdsmen who didn't know nothing very scott who didn't know nothing from gossip god revealed his love his power his message to them isn't that right oh here they come walking what it was what a thing to behold a messiah in a manger isn't that right hallelujah hallelujah yeah all right amen let me bring this out here now he said hey man let me bring this out paragraph 28 center notice not only that but the most unlikely place for such an event the shepherds now was the one who received the message and now notice where the message was in the most unlikely place that anyone would expect it to come he said and i wonder tonight if we were looking for the true message of the lord jesus he said i wonder if it would be in an unlikely group oh my a place that was that the great high cultured world and the church today would think was a bunch of of all heretics i wonder if that wouldn't be where we'd find him the most unlikely place and to the most unqualified speakers shepherds who know nothing about speaking only calling sheep oh hallelujah calling sheep hallelujah calling the names from out of the book preaching the word of god staying with that word staying with that word that's all the shepherds know how to do praise god they didn't know high intellectuals they don't know how to preach a mighty message amen they're right all he knows about the sheep all they're concerned about is the names that are on the book of life they have to come forth in their time and their hour in their season and god give them our heart to go after no sheep amen way over there you'll find them he'll find you this morning no matter where you're sitting no matter where you're standing at praise god no matter what street corner the devil places you at god will find you where you are praise god and he'll fill you with the holy ghost he'll give you a house desire he'll stretch forth his hand and satisfy the desire of every living thing for he is god this morning hallelujah he says lo i'm with you always who is he the good shepherd amen let's continue he says uh what he called his sheep he said well maybe that's why i come he said but there was a promised word notice yes it could do that again it bypassed all the nobles of the land it bypassed all the nobles it was revealed to the nobodies oh i'm a nobody this morning praise god hallelujah oh i'm a nobody this morning who is man that thought mindful of him don't make it lord lord than the angels oh david know he was who he was talking about praise god isn't that right hallelujah hallelujah amen to nobody oh my oh how could we be somebody when revelation comes to make you humble however you didn't get it for your studies and now my might is not by power it's by his spirit revealing all things showing you all things jesus said when i am gone the spirit of truth will come and guide you into all truth and show you all truths you will not be led astray by the spirit of truth who is the spirit of truth he is the good shepherd he's here to guide you and to lead you into all truth oh stay with that shepherd stay with the word this morning have to pray for me i think i'm losing my voice see man praise god but amen pray for me i'll try to get through this amen i'm halfway through here man please go amen only halfway to go amen glory to god hallelujah amen all right encouraging myself you know praise god okay so the wisdom the wisdom of the infinite or almighty god did it to make known to them the greatest message it ever was messiah is now on the earth he said what a wisdom could only come from god the pharisees didn't know it the sadducees didn't know it christ became a man 33 and a half years they still didn't know who he was and yet shepherds before he even come into his own ministry we had a revelation of who that little baby was of who that two-year-old child was they knew who he was praise god they had a revelation from god it was hidden from the pharisees and it was revealed to the meek to the lowly that's who he come to isn't that right the bible said he came unto his own and his own receive him not but if manny has received him to them give he power to become the sons of god what does that mean you are going to receive power this morning same as somebody say man somebody you are predestinated to receive power if you have received christ in his fullness you shall receive power to become the sons of god amen to change even your nature we'll get to it this morning amen i'm just dropping things off to you praise god amen hallelujah what a wisdom could only come from god god who knows wisdom the bible said if not in my lack of wisdom let him ask god isn't that right all the wisdom and all the schooling and everything was now laid to waste and bypassed by great wisdom of by the great wisdom of god he said i keep repeating that because i want it to go down deep oh i love the prophet hallelujah hallelujah he won't let it rest he's driving it into you now hallelujah all laid to waste it was of no good all your private interpretations all that we think all that we want all of our desire laid to waste hallelujah holiday we are laid to wish isn't our right to the wisdom and the knowledge of god but my man david said the knowledge to me is too high i cannot attain it but he make it himself to the lowly holla isn't that right he repeated himself to babes such as would learn isn't that right is that the word oh hallelujah that's right he said i wanted to go down deep down deep all later waste no good it bypassed it all to let god's wisdom have the right way that god takes nothings to make some things oh hallelujah are you nothing in here this morning then he can make something out of you this morning oh fear not little flock hallelujah fear not little sister there's a man in here who can turn on the light he could turn on a light in your life he could turn nothing into something this morning even the statue of a perfect man amen please go and now they fail to recognize it i said and now they do the same thing again man intention good it's good it's always good he said a man never changes his posture he never changes his ways much he said i'm talking of the man of the world man is always praising god religious man for what he's done and always pointing the people to what he's going to do and then ignoring what he's doing see that's just man he's made that way he's always been that way i knew bible readers tonight know that that's according to the word right he said they're always praising god for what he's done saying what he will do and ignoring what he is doing that's just the habit of man oh don't you feel to see what god's doing today don't you fail to see what god's doing this morning god's getting our pride already god's calling his sheep out oh holiday i've been scattered out throughout all the world with interpretations of this interpretations of man and the thoughts of man hallelujah but the voice of god is going to go out even the voice of the archangel veil and another ephesians to call the sheep of god from every church from every place or every denomination praise god he's going to call them out for a glorious rapture even to a glorious holy ghost villain the holy ghost pours upon individuals it's not a group thing i'm not talking about a group this morning i'm talking about these sheep a sheep one over here one over here the court could use come on now here's my spirit flowing freely here's my spirit phone freely every one of them god will find and bring them into the fold hallelujah isn't that right isn't that right isn't that right isn't that right but isaac brought him up beautifully last week talking about noah and the ark and he said when the call of god went out to the animals brother there was thousands of animals in that day thousands of elephants thousands of giraffes and lions and zebras and tigers and bears but that voice only went two of each kind there won't be much go in there it was only two of each kind might have been a thousand bears but only two bears made it only two g ross made it only two lions made it hallelujah is that a reflection of what's going on today hallelujah hallelujah brought bypass to multitudes and revealed to our little group our little people praise god individuals coming out coming out of the world pressing their way getting their inheritance getting their promise getting their holy ghost in that right your mother can't get the holy ghost for you you have got to get it for yourself your father can't get it for you your brother can't get it for you your wife nobody can get it for you you've got to go and get it yourself amen the onus is on you the responsibility is on you to make yourself ready for when the bridegroom comes isn't that right holla isn't that right jesus give a prophet parable it's not right about the ten versions five or wise fiber foolish the five wise virgins made themselves ready they took it upon themselves with a revelation that they receive to make themselves ready for his comment but sad to say there were five virgins who didn't make themselves ready and when the call was going out when the call went out those virgins realized their condition then but five were already prepared by doing what they had to do he said behold i come quickly my reward is with me to give every man according to his work and when that call went out come into the marriage of the lamb isn't that right jesus said five were caught with their work undone they went unto the ones that were wise and said give us of your oil we don't have any we don't have the holy ghost we don't have the signs we don't have the wonders we don't have what malachi 4 required is not right and the five wise said go unto them that the bible said while they went out to buy the pride pool came it was too late to go get it it was too late to apply the token it was too late to get the holy ghost it was too late to have the virtues it was too late to press their way they missed that call i'm sad to say there's gonna be a group that'll miss that call i'm afraid i have to say it it's the truth i hate to say it i wouldn't everyone be saved even the prophet said so but we don't know who's on the book god knows his sheep god knows who they are god knows who will press their way but there's a group that'll make it and there's a group that will not make it so you make up your mind this morning which group you want to be in shame and somebody there's a group that's supposed to go into the weeping and the wailing and the national teach isn't that right but there's also a group that's going to go into that place where they'll be shouting whether we praising whether they'll be glorifying god they'll be shouting on the hills of glory where will you in the morning stars stand together hallelujah and the sons of god shouted for joy there's a group that'll go into that rapture it might be a small group but they will be there by the grace of almighty god amen so make up your mind today which group you're going to be in oh hallelujah oh my i want to be in that number this morning oh my i want to be in that number when the rule is called up yonder when god brings a great scroll i start calling names but i'll be somewhere listening i'll be somewhere listening for my name hallelujah praise god i want to have the baptism of the holy ghost in my heart i want to be in a revival i want to be jumping and shouting when he called my name praise god hallelujah amen amen brother it's something when somebody calls your name it's something that just happens to you praise god there's something in your mind you can't explain it if i'm walking down port of spain city and i'm walking down and somebody say hey boy i don't respond because boy is not my name and somebody say hey hey come come no that's not my name i know there's all kind of characters in puerta spain city praise god so so i don't respond i just keep my head down praise god but if you know me you call my name praise god if you know me well you'll call my name and when i call my name i respond i say hey brother hey sister praise god hey how you doing praise god amen hallelujah it's something when your name is called when god calls not your earthly name now but when god calls your spiritual name the name that you are in the family of god when god calls that name there's something i need to respond oh hallelujah praise god give god a shout out pray hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh it's something when god called your name hallelujah hallelujah and bypass all the thoughts in your mind hallelujah isn't that right the prophet said we had spiritual amnesia isn't that right we didn't know ourselves amnesia is a condition of the mind something happens that you forget you forget where you come from you forget who your name is you forget who your lineage is you forget who you're born with you forget who's your mother you forget who's your father that's what amnesia is it's a condition of the mind and something happened long ago that brought us into a spiritual amnesia the prophet talked about it isn't that right hallelujah adam and eve fell into sin in the garden of eden brought us into a spiritual amnesia isn't that right we didn't know ourselves we didn't know who we were called we didn't know whose family we were we wandered in sheepskins and goat skins we were destitute and afflicted we were tormented we didn't know who we were but the love of god the love of god the good shepherd came and found us where we were oh hallelujah hallelujah hey many many many many man oh hallelujah hallelujah he can find you this morning yes yes he can find you no matter what you're going through no matter where you find yourself he'll find you this morning he'll do something to you this morning he can save your soul he still saves he still heals he still delivers he still fills with the baptism of the holy ghost he is god all the time hallelujah people always looking for what god has done people are looking for what god will do failing to see what god can do now god can do something for you now this morning he can fill you with the holy ghost now this morning he can steal you now this morning now faith is the substance of what you're open for it is the reality it is the reality praise god fate is your hundred dollar bill you don't have the bread yet but by faith i'm gonna get it by fix i'll make it to the parlor by faith i'm going to buy the bread it's not rich and by faith we are standing this morning see man i think we're pressing this

young man he's going to go before you to good shepherd with his staff ain't nobody going to come around that staff hallelujah um david said i wrote on my staff they comforted me they'll prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies my cop run it over he leaded me beside the still waters he restored my soul oh how many restoration this morning how many need a restoration in your soul oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah praise god hey many man he restored my soul isn't that right hallelujah go before them he going before them and the sheep follow him for they know his voice a stranger's voice they will not follow but will flee from him for they know not the voice of strangers oh hallelujah you can't respond to an uncertain sound only a certain sound please go a certain time when it comes you respond to it that's right i mean i'm hurry on down here now oh my so much to do it's a little time amen okay amen you love the lord today just bear with me i'm just gonna it's gonna be a few minutes but i want to strike something here and then i'll close out amen praise god hallelujah okay now i want to read something here real quick skip on down here now hallelujah he said now we're going to find out why i come to shepherds he said because they know the sheep is helpless say amen somebody let the sheep say amen this more amen hallelujah you know you're helpless this morning we are helpless with our god is that right we have our own mind we have our own way but we're still helpless oh we can do nothing we can say nothing without god we ain't going nowhere without the holy ghost we're not going anywhere without the good shepherd we're not going anywhere hallelujah praise god without a requirement for the sound for this day we're helpless hallelujah isn't that right that's just the nature of a sheep a sheep doesn't have sharp teeth isn't that right to attack people with it doesn't have a bad attitude it's the nature of the sheep they can take a sheep and put it in the house and pet it it'll just ban ban bleat on that's just the nature of a sheep he can't help himself he goes and he grazes where he grazes he goes wherever the shepherd tells him to go that's just the nature of the sheep the sheep is just built that way they're vulnerable they're pliable you could use them you could carry them you could place them you could put them you could get them to walk you can get them to sit down you can get them to lie down you can get them to do whatever they want that's just the nature of the sheep hallelujah but goats are different the goats want to do their own thing the ghosts want to kick up and get on wild and get on all wassy praise god they don't want to obey orders they want to obey instructions they don't want to obey leaders they want to be amen that's not right they don't want to do the things of god but the sheep oh they know his voice the sheep have a kind heart the sheep have a good and honest heart oh the sheep love the lord the sheep love the word the sheep love to wake up on a sunday morning and to give a smile on their face this sheep go through testing and hard trial and after all of that the sheep get happy the sheep get the smile and the sheep get the praise in god when they think of the goodness of jesus and all that he's done for them only the sheep can forgive only the sheep can repent only the sheep can make things right that's the nature of a sheep hallelujah oh thank god for the sheep this morning oh hallelujah praise god amen amen hallelujah amen praise god my sheep is perfectly helpless he cannot go by himself that's the reason that god likened his believing children onto she they have got to be guided but watch what's guiding you here's a prophet it was a warning he said watch what's guiding you he said don't get a goat he'll walk you to the slaughter pen god never gave us a goat he gave us his son the holy spirit to guide us oh who's the good shepherd the holy spirit amen he is our god not some man-made hurts man but god's given god-given herdsmen oh filler the baptism already goes isn't that right who feed the sheep upon shifu amen hallelujah he said now you take a pig and you say to this pig yes he brings it out here i love this story he said you take a pig and you say to this pig i'm going to make you a lamb and you wash him you paint his toenails and so forth give him food like a sheep give him some kind of a diet put him out on the floor where the sheep heard in the alfalfa fields or something and if there's a mud hole anywhere that hog will just go straight into the murder as soon as he can go see why because his nature is still a hug isn't that right oh hallelujah hallelujah it can't be painted up it can be put on it's got to be real say amen somebody your nature has got to be changed hallelujah the people of israel came out of egypt but egypt was still in there the whole desire of god to go through the wilderness for all those years was to get the willingness um to get egypt out of the people isn't that right to try them and test them and to purge egypt out to them until they could forget what the files styles and the fashion look like until he could forget what the sphinx and his pyramids look like until he could forget all of that and still they had a goat-like attitude we cannot cross over and they chose to believe or even report amen but caleb and joshua had another spirit with them they had another nature with them they could do nothing but believe the world they could do nothing but believe the promise they could do nothing but be sheep in god's pastures oh hallelujah when they tasted those grapes when they started drinking milk and honey brother they began to jump they began to bleed they began to bow all over the place praise god they were like sheep jumping up and down oh hallelujah this is the promised land this is the promised land hallelujah when they came back to the camp they meet a bunch of goats putting one another quarreling with one another confusing one another this game is interpretation that interpretation this is a giant that is a giant all in here in this giant bunch of good revelations but these two brothers come out like sheep of his pasture saying we are well able to go into the land and possess the land it's our land it's a green pasture there are still waters oh hallelujah praise god oh hallelujah so god had to kill out all the goats two and a half million of them come out oh hallelujah but somehow they just didn't receive that that that uh trying and testing time amen isn't that right 40 days in the wilderness it's not right oh my something else here okay so now uh where am i at here amen so they got to be guided see god never gives us a good all right see okay we're talking about the hog isn't that right amen said if there's a mud hole anywhere that hog will just go straight to that mud hole as he can go see why because his nature is still a hog and he said that's the reason that church members today indulge in the things of the world see it's because their nature hasn't been changed say man somebody they'll eat any kind of ecclesiastical theological slop that's not skim milk brother but the word of god they can't stand it they'll go in and listen to the world isn't that right they'll eat any kind of a thing isn't that right but the sheep of god they know his voice the sheep of god have a different nature hallelujah isn't that right he said you know the biggest hypocrite in the world is an old crow he said in the bible there were two that were left out of the ark oh come back to the alberta isaac amen the old crow went out and he never did return but because he's a vulture and a scavenger he sat on the bodies of dead carcasses fill his belly with dead carcasses but when he turned the dove out talking about noah the dove could not stand that stench so he returned back to the father's house i know and beat at the door until noah let him back in oh my see different nature different behavior praise god isn't that right he said now a crow can sit out there and eat on a dead horse all day and fly out there in the field and eat grain with the dove he's kind of too full he said but the seed but the dove doesn't have any gall he can't digest it and when any dove of god here is any word eating dove or sheep i love that terminology amen a word eating dove amen a clean beast when you go to give them the things of the world they know their master said he that loved the world of the things of the world the love of god is not even in him he said you give him something contrary to that word of god he cannot stand it he said but the devil can take that and the world too and call it all god but you can't mix oil and water he said it just won't mix hallelujah praise god hallelujah there's something in you that responds to the word of god oh you can't respond to the things out there something inside of you hallelujah praise god hallelujah hallelujah knows that word eating diet praise god isn't that right praise god isn't that right it's not a put on it's got to be real amen and i was talking in a car coming up this morning hey man talking to my mother in the front one and we were talking we were saying that if somebody gets the virus isn't that right if you get the virus if you get sick there are certain symptoms to that sickness isn't that right if you get the chikungunya virus there are certain symptoms to know that you have the virus swelling of the joints isn't that right you got rashes on your skin pain in the joints muscle pains and swelling fever and so forth there's different symptoms that go along with it there's different things that happen to you that let you know that you have the virus that there's something wrong with you that something's got a hold of you isn't that right and if you got the holy ghost there's some symptoms that go along with it oh same man somebody say man somebody there's some symptoms that go along with it you love your brother you forgive one another you forgive your sister you go after the loss you preach the word you sing the songs of zion oh hallelujah you can't help but love god you can't help but love his people there's symptoms that go along with it oh hallelujah it's not we got the holy ghost it's the holy ghost that's got you this morning that's how it's got to be that's how the prophet taught it hallelujah hallelujah oh same and somebody same and somebody you got to pass through the door oh hallelujah that's the only way you can get the food inside you can't go in any other way you've got to go to a genuine experience that's when you know that it's real the prophet always taught it your experience has got to match the world if you get it from the altar and you still hate somebody you're still flying off the handle you haven't got it if you can't forgive if you can't repent if you can't move on you still haven't got it if you can add a virtues if you can't live a life you still haven't got it you gotta come back to the altar and then let the fire of god come into your heart and burn that thing out of there and until that happened there's no rapture until that happened hallelujah oh hallelujah that's the only way amen he said i am the door that's the way this morning amen that's god's provided way amen 120. he said they all these shepherds they knew the sheep was helpless without the shepherd and they were shepherds and knew that he must be guided he said oh what a pity it is to see today that they try to feed the sheep sloth but a sheep won't eat it no sir see they was trying to feed the sheep back there slop and when the word come they had been so used to slop that they didn't know the word and that's what it is today when the same thing vindicated and proved that god would do a certain thing or he is he going to do a certain thing this morning is he going to release dynamics to your mechanics this morning is he going to do a certain thing this morning how are you going to prove that god will do a certain thing they so used to slop and slop fed to he said well there's no talking to them they just won't listen to it that's all he said that the bible said as a dog returns to its vomit and as a hog to its wallow so do they he said hear the word and go back right back to the same old wallow and say ah it's fanaticism don't believe such a thing as that oh hallelujah the devil is fighting the holy ghost that's right you better believe it he's fighting the holy ghost this morning he doesn't want you to receive it he wants you to keep feeding on that slop in your mind he wants you to keep feeling i'm not slopping and you're feeling in your spirit and you're in a in a human realm isn't that right but you gotta break out of that this morning i'll break out of it this morning shake that thing off you this morning hallelujah god has a better word diet for you this morning amen hallelujah he said god sheep does the same today he said they must trust in the word diet i love that it's a word diet special kind of diet to keep you slim and trim you can't go into rapture all heavy you can't go into rapture all the way down praise god with all the things in the world no no no no hallelujah you've got to have a certain kind of way you've got to be built a certain kind of way and the word died just to put some muscles on you the word pad is i keep your fat and sassy to keep your exercise and ready to keep your fit praise god so you can run the race praise god amen okay he said he'll not take any other diet you can't give them an ecleasical diet he said a real sheep no no no no you go tell them now we look we'll be all together jesus prayed we all be one you just heard the same thing a two son not too long ago okay that's a lie all right uh let's get on down here now he said jesus jesus said how can two work together unless they agreed how are you gonna take methodist baptist presbyterian catholic and throw it all together and be one you might be one on the man's head but jesus said there might be one even as i and you are one and now he wants us all to be one in him which is the word amen isn't that right there it is he said one with the father and the father is the son the father is the son is the same and it's the same word the word manifested displaying itself in this day as it did in any other day that you might be one amen do you love him this morning amen amen get on another shout out please please god man i'm enjoying the wood this morning but i know that time is running out so i'll just hurry along here now i don't want to keep it too long anymore but i have some quotes here don't read from message call what does it take to make a christian life and i'm aroused up here with sonny man praise god do you love him this morning amen hallelujah praise god so we're going to read some things here hallelujah so we know that our nature has to be changed isn't that right god promised to change your nature to change your nature from a worm to a butterfly praise god to change it from something i'll change it from nothing and make something out of you a new creature a new creation how jesus said a new heart i give you a new spirit i'll give you i'll take out your stony heart and give you a heart of flesh a heart to love god i have to love the unlovable i had to be like a true sheep i had to be helpless i had to be led to be led of god to be led to the trial come on now to be led to the wilderness say amen somebody we are yet to go to the wilderness god has to change your nature otherwise if you have a goat nature you're not going through no wilderness think about it be real nobody is going through the wilderness with a goat nature nobody that's right you have to change your nature first something has to transform on the inside to make you leadable so that god could take you through the wilderness through the testing through the trial to the storm why because that's the only way to get those virtues inside of you say man somebody you're not going to do within your own human spirit it says not by might it's not by power it's by his spirits here the lord from virtue all the way up in spirit it's not your flesh it's not us trying to push your head inside of christianity it's your loving god if you're getting closer to god every day you have to have the nature praise god in order to go through that jesus had to be the lamb of god in order to be crucified in order to go up through golgotha's hill he had to have that kind of a nature he couldn't fight it he couldn't push away pilate he can get on all while and so on he had to get meek he had to get lonely he had to be the lamb of god a certain nature had to come upon him the dove had to come upon him just like john saw when he was baptized and lead him into the wilderness lead him to calvary isn't that right that's the nature of the sheep that's the nature of the lamb you have to have that kind of nature or we're not going in a rapture you might as well forget about a rapture unless you get that kind of a nature isn't there a shame in somebody oh this is not skim milk oh hallelujah this is raw meat this morning praise god a new heart i give you a new spirit i'll give you listen listen it's a heart transplant god not taking our whole heart i'm trying to take a piece of

the bible said here ezekiel speaking and ezekiel was a prophet and he said a new heart i'll give you hey like i like it he said always god speaks of something new that he's going to do he didn't say that he'll just patch up an old condition no he said a new heart i'll give you i'll take away the stony heart that you have and a new spirit i'll give you he never said i'll give you a facelift call it to some old church no no no he's gonna have a new thing a brand new in doing this in you hallelujah pray amen isn't that right he said you can't mix the old intellectual church with some new pentecostal experience hallelujah he said jesus taught the same thing he said you can't put new wine in old bottles he said that was hard for me to understand before became a missionary but i saw what bottles was and they began to explain that the bottles were wine skits isn't that right that was sewn together hallelujah and they had to put oil in them wine skins and make it soft isn't that right then you could put the new wine into that old bottle he said he could put water into an old bottle he said that's all right but he said wine has a life in it wine moves wine jumps wine bubbles wine ferments wine gets to twisting and jumping wine has a life in it wine tumbles while grind grows inside of you wine changes from one thing entirely to another and god is not gonna take his wine his new wife and pour it into those old bottles no no no he's got to give you a new bottle how many want a new bottle this morning you can begin this time let it rain let it rain go into it please oh hallelujah how many won new bottles this morning how many want new bottles this morning the holy spirit is here to give you a new bottle of an oil and that old wine skin and to get it all softened up oh hallelujah to get it pliable so that it can take the form of that new eye so they can stretch to fit that new wine hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right it's not right but a stupid get ready to come he said now you may be able to put water in an old bottle keep humming now keep worshiping now he said but you can't put wine into an old bottle he said because water is the ashes of hydrogen and oxygen and oxygen remains if anything dwindles away it shrinks it has its substance but it has no life isn't that right he said but wine has a life in it a new wine new wine especially it's fermenting and it might spread out a little if it pushes that old bottle in the old hide will burst and fly open he said now he said then that hide is ruined and the bottle's ruined he said a bottle is ruined and a wine is spilled now that's about the picture we have before us today you can come to an old former bunch of intellectuals with your ideas and try to adopt god's program in your intellectual program it just won't work he said that old dry cowhide will just blow up he said it can't take it he said but now a new bottle he said a new bottle is a tanned high a new tan high and a new tan high has still the animal oil in that high and when a new wine goes into that new bottle then when the new iron goes in it begins to swell the new bottle begins to give it pushes out because it's got oil in it and if there ever was a time the prophet said that the church needs an oiling today he said it is today he said the holy spirit is the oil he said it is the new wine oh get a lot of
