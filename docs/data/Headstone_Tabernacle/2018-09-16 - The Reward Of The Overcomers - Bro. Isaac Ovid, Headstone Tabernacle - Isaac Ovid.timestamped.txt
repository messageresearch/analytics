[58:21] from verse 11 revelation 3 and verse 11
[58:25] behold I come quickly hold that fast
[58:31] which thou hast that no man take thy
[58:34] crown him that overcometh will i make a
[58:37] pillar in the temple of my god and he
[58:40] shall go no more out and I will write
[58:43] upon him the name of my god and the name
[58:45] of the city of my god which is New
[58:48] Jerusalem which cometh down out of
[58:51] heaven from my god and I will write upon
[58:53] him my new name he that hath an ear let
[58:56] him hear what the spirit saith unto the
[58:59] churches and unto the Angel of the
[59:01] Church of the Laodiceans write these
[59:03] things saith the Amen the faithful and
[59:05] true witness the beginning of the
[59:08] creation of God I know thy works that
[59:10] thou art neither cold nor hot I would
[59:13] thou wert cold or hot so then because
[59:16] thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor
[59:19] hot I will spew thee out of my mouth
[59:21] because they'll say as I am rich and
[59:24] increased with Goods and have need of
[59:26] nothing and knowest not that thou art
[59:28] wretched and miserable and poor and
[59:30] blind and naked I counsel thee to buy of
[59:34] me gold tried in the fire that thou
[59:37] mayest be rich and white raiment that
[59:40] thou mayest be clothed and that the
[59:42] shame of thy nakedness do not appear and

[59:48] sea as many as I love I rebuke and
[59:51] chasten be zealous therefore
[59:53] repent behold I stand at the door and
[59:56] knock If any man hear my voice and open
[59:59] the door I will come in to him and will
[1:00:01] sup with him and he with me to him that
[1:00:04] overcometh will I grant to sit with me
[1:00:06] in my throne even as I also overcame and
[1:00:10] I'm set down with my father in his
[1:00:12] throne he that hath an ear let him hear
[1:00:14] what the spirit saith unto the churches
[1:00:18] may the Lord add a blessing to the
[1:00:19] reading of his word you may be seated in
[1:00:22] the presence of the Lord this morning
[1:00:24] it's certainly a great privilege to be
[1:00:27] able to come to the house of the Lord
[1:00:30] this morning it is what we do it is what
[1:00:34] motivates us it is what inspires us it's
[1:00:37] where we get encouragement is where we
[1:00:39] get a battle plan to face the week the
[1:00:41] feast a month to face challenges it's
[1:00:44] where we get a word from the Lord to
[1:00:46] deal with our situation because every
[1:00:49] answer for our lives is in the word of
[1:00:52] Almighty God every answer to every
[1:00:55] situation can be found in the word of
[1:00:58] the Lord
[1:00:59] the psychologist Scott ride a
[1:01:01] psychiatrist could try counselors could
[1:01:04] try but in the word of the Lord is the
[1:01:06] answer to every problem that you could
[1:01:08] ever find on this journey you could find
[1:01:11] the answer in the word of the Lord amen
[1:01:15] and how blessed have we been in the
[1:01:17] midweek services what a blessing last
[1:01:21] Wednesday what a blessing on Friday amen
[1:01:24] and special announcement this week this
[1:01:27] week midweek services will be on
[1:01:29] Wednesday of this week this week
[1:01:31] there'll be no Friday night service for
[1:01:33] this week we will have a youth service
[1:01:35] on Saturday at 5 p.m. so please take
[1:01:38] note midweek service this week will be
[1:01:41] on Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. there will be
[1:01:43] no service on Friday instead we will
[1:01:45] have a Saturday youth service at 5 p.m.
[1:01:48] for the entire church so make every
[1:01:51] effort to be there because we have to do
[1:01:54] all that we can do when we can do it
[1:01:57] there comes a time when your energy is
[1:01:59] that as strong as it was and then many
[1:02:01] people look back and say I wish I had
[1:02:03] done more
[1:02:04] I wish I had done more and that living
[1:02:08] with that regret of having the
[1:02:10] opportunity to do more and not doing
[1:02:12] more puts us in a very precarious
[1:02:13] position because one day we all have to
[1:02:16] give an account and we don't want to be
[1:02:18] found standing and seeing I wish I had
[1:02:21] done more I wish I had prayed more I
[1:02:24] wish I had sacrificed more I wish I had
[1:02:28] done more so while there was strength
[1:02:30] and life in us we want to do all that we
[1:02:33] can do for the kingdom of God because
[1:02:36] heaven and earth will pass away but this
[1:02:38] kingdom of which we preach will never
[1:02:40] pass away it is from eternity it is
[1:02:43] eternal and if there's a seed German
[1:02:45] your soul there is something in you that
[1:02:47] will pulse it no matter what you did
[1:02:49] last week last year last month once you
[1:02:52] come in contact with the spirit and the
[1:02:54] word that seed in you has no choice but
[1:02:57] to respond because you have no control
[1:02:59] over the seed in you that's why the
[1:03:01] Prophet said we are not even to believe
[1:03:03] us but the word in us that we didn't put
[1:03:06] there that's the believer and that
[1:03:07] believing seed in our souls is
[1:03:09] programmed to respond a certain way
[1:03:12] because once you come and contact with
[1:03:14] the presence of Almighty God I made a
[1:03:16] word of Almighty God it does something
[1:03:19] to the seed in your soul you could try
[1:03:21] to cover it up you could try to hide it
[1:03:23] you could try to put the fire out with
[1:03:26] your work schedule and with family
[1:03:28] issues and drown yourself with problems
[1:03:30] but five minutes in the presence of God
[1:03:32] it's all it ticks without schita
[1:03:35] to let you know I'm still here but
[1:03:37] waiting for a long time to be reminded
[1:03:40] at to remind you that you are called for
[1:03:42] a higher purpose you are not called to
[1:03:44] be defeated you want to call to be a
[1:03:46] church remember you are not call just to
[1:03:49] be a message believer but you are called
[1:03:51] to be a participator
[1:03:53] and a partaker of his divine nature
[1:03:56] there's a nature and we are born to
[1:03:59] enjoy there's a life that we are born to
[1:04:01] enjoy and the devil's job is to try to
[1:04:04] keep us from that and he does a good job
[1:04:06] of that but we also have a job to do we
[1:04:09] have a job to worship we have a job to
[1:04:11] press we have a job to fight we have a
[1:04:14] job to achieve
[1:04:15] our job to succeed we have a job to
[1:04:17] overcome we have a job to contend for
[1:04:20] the feet we have a job to fight for our
[1:04:22] lives because the devil wants our lies
[1:04:25] well we have a chop to fight for our
[1:04:27] lives you could choose to give up or you
[1:04:29] could choose the fighter you could
[1:04:31] choose to worship or you could choose to
[1:04:33] have a pity party and I see nobody knows
[1:04:36] the trouble I've seen he has time to
[1:04:38] talk about the trouble but the Bible
[1:04:40] tells us that the sufferings of this
[1:04:42] present time are not even worthy to be
[1:04:44] compared with the glory that shall be
[1:04:47] revealed in us the sufferings of not
[1:04:49] being able to pay the bills is not
[1:04:51] worthy to be compared with the glory
[1:04:54] that shall be revealed in us the
[1:04:56] sovereigns in your marriage is not
[1:04:59] worthy to be compared with the glory
[1:05:01] that will be revealed in us the
[1:05:03] sufferings on your job they are not
[1:05:06] worthy to be compared with the glory
[1:05:08] which shall be revealed in us these
[1:05:12] sufferings are temporary pain is
[1:05:15] temporary
[1:05:16] sadness is temporary sickness is
[1:05:19] temporary being defeated is temporary
[1:05:22] having an identity crisis is temporary
[1:05:26] spiritual amnesia is temporary he in
[1:05:29] town around his temporary not knowing
[1:05:32] who you are is temporary you may be
[1:05:40] seated
[1:05:42] had it not been for the fall of Adam we
[1:05:45] would have been spoken into existence
[1:05:47] and we would have been spoken into
[1:05:49] existence with authority to speak to our
[1:05:52] situations but we bypassed off the often
[1:05:55] II and we came to this earth as a
[1:05:56] proving ground so that in Satan's Eden
[1:05:59] which he has had over six thousand years
[1:06:01] to perfect got to deploy some secret
[1:06:04] agents who look like the world they go
[1:06:07] to work just like everybody else go eat
[1:06:10] in places like restaurants with
[1:06:12] everybody else but there's something
[1:06:14] different about them there's a white
[1:06:16] light on the inside and there's an
[1:06:18] invisible light on the outside of
[1:06:21] so when you woke up this morning that
[1:06:24] that was raid I went crazy when you woke
[1:06:31] up this morning before I even cut off
[1:06:33] the bed the devil say he's up let's see
[1:06:36] what it's gonna do let's let's hope he
[1:06:37] stays defeated let's hope he worries
[1:06:40] about his pills left hope he worries
[1:06:42] about his problems but but when you
[1:06:44] begin to see it thank you Lord for
[1:06:45] waking me up the devil say oh boy oh boy
[1:06:49] today looks like it's going to be a
[1:06:51] problem every move you do gives the
[1:06:55] devil a headache I say let us give the
[1:06:57] devil the biggest migraine he has ever
[1:07:00] had since Jesus was in the wilderness
[1:07:05] let's confuse the devil let's confuse
[1:07:09] the devil this morning how do you
[1:07:11] confuse the devil by doing what he
[1:07:13] doesn't expect he may be seated
[1:07:19] that's how you confuse the devil by
[1:07:21] doing what he does not expect understand
[1:07:24] this the devil has one objective to keep
[1:07:27] you blind to your purpose because
[1:07:31] whether Branum taught us the moment the
[1:07:33] brain gets to know who she is she's
[1:07:36] invincible that's very powerful because
[1:07:42] it means you are already something else
[1:07:43] than you could even see I'll say that
[1:07:47] again
[1:07:47] you are already something else that you
[1:07:50] cannot even see you got up this morning
[1:07:53] and looked in the mirror and you saw
[1:07:55] yourself but when God not he didn't see
[1:07:57] what you saw or you don't hear me this
[1:08:00] morning and when you cut up this morning
[1:08:02] and the devil looked at you he didn't
[1:08:05] see what you saw because the devil
[1:08:08] understand the spiritual realm and when
[1:08:10] you're in the realm of the natural you
[1:08:12] see your pills you see your problems you
[1:08:15] see what happened and you're looking in
[1:08:17] the natural eye and the tablet seemed to
[1:08:19] open his eyes don't open his eyes don't
[1:08:22] let them see that he's a king don't let
[1:08:24] her see that she's a princess don't let
[1:08:26] them see that the essence are under the
[1:08:28] blood let them think that they are still
[1:08:30] tied like Johnny crow let
[1:08:33] keep walking around in circles but this
[1:08:35] morning
[1:08:37] no more circles this morning no more PM
[1:08:41] defeated this morning no more wondering
[1:08:44] who you are come to church Shaymin
[1:08:48] [Music]
[1:08:51] hallelujah hallelujah I'm just talking
[1:08:56] to you a little bit is that okay
[1:08:58] inside of this service here by the
[1:08:59] county just having a conversation this
[1:09:01] morning just having a conversation with
[1:09:03] life and the struggles of life but the
[1:09:06] random preacher might say why are we so
[1:09:07] tossed about why why we have all these
[1:09:09] ups and thousand because you this and
[1:09:12] all of that is is to try to keep us in
[1:09:14] this natural realm that's gonna feel
[1:09:16] away one day and the boss that puts
[1:09:20] pressure on you he's anointed to put
[1:09:21] pressure the friends in your schooling
[1:09:24] are doing it to do what they do
[1:09:26] your name is anointed to make noise
[1:09:29] early in the morning your name is
[1:09:33] anointed to put on the carnival music
[1:09:35] the Maxie you going to is anointed a Mac
[1:09:38] the traveler has a choice and he's
[1:09:40] operating under a law to do everything
[1:09:43] to influence you were there only two
[1:09:45] influences you either influenced from
[1:09:47] above or you're influenced from below so
[1:09:51] everywhere you go it's not about family
[1:09:53] and friends and work and chalk it's
[1:09:56] about influence because you have been
[1:10:00] marked for a destination the devil
[1:10:02] undoes --nt understand the full
[1:10:04] specifications that defines your
[1:10:06] existence because the devil dealt with
[1:10:08] David and David made a mistake the devil
[1:10:11] dealt with Moses and Moses made a
[1:10:13] mistake it's just when Jesus him it was
[1:10:15] an experience
[1:10:17] could never forget because this man
[1:10:20] suffered he wept he was hungry he went
[1:10:23] and suffer just as we as a man but the
[1:10:26] Bible said he didn't sin and then Jesus
[1:10:31] placed a seed in front of some
[1:10:32] predestinated people and said because I
[1:10:35] live you are gonna live also but he
[1:10:38] didn't tell you he did it because when
[1:10:39] you were born and you were going
[1:10:40] school and he will go into work and you
[1:10:43] in the path and you were drinking you
[1:10:45] didn't even know that you were carrying
[1:10:46] a present that there was something
[1:10:50] locked up in you you didn't even know
[1:10:52] when you did what you did there was
[1:10:54] something in you so we come to service
[1:10:57] to find out what God put in us and the
[1:11:04] church Shaymin and every time you come
[1:11:06] to church and you hear the word it's the
[1:11:09] seed in your soul see that's me that
[1:11:11] songs I did talking them on me
[1:11:13] wait a minute that's how I feel when I
[1:11:16] feel the anointing it makes me feel good
[1:11:18] it makes me feel satisfied if I could
[1:11:21] just have this all the time I'll be all
[1:11:24] right come to church Haman so I have a
[1:11:32] title this morning the rewards of the
[1:11:38] overcomers
[1:11:40] the rewards of the overcomers because
[1:11:46] when you overcome you ought to get
[1:11:48] something when you go to school and you
[1:11:51] overcome for one you kind of go to form
[1:11:57] two until you overcome form one if you
[1:12:00] don't overcome form one they will keep
[1:12:01] you informed one until at such time as
[1:12:04] you have overcome from one overcoming
[1:12:07] from one is required to experience form
[1:12:10] two and when you overcome from - you're
[1:12:14] not ready for form three when I was in
[1:12:16] school they would keep people back if
[1:12:18] they didn't overcome the form because
[1:12:20] you have to pass a test to face another
[1:12:23] test but the objective of going to
[1:12:26] school is got to say I overcome form one
[1:12:28] overcome for you could produce your
[1:12:32] level passes and those passes represent
[1:12:36] the rewards of the overcomers
[1:12:40] [Music]
[1:12:41] now when people are in school there are
[1:12:44] many excuses and then the excuses
[1:12:46] disappear when you hear some people
[1:12:47] story because they are people Hammerman
[1:12:51] in school they were students who
[1:12:52] struggle with electricity but at the end
[1:12:55] of the five years they overcame some who
[1:12:58] had no electricity had more
[1:13:00] qualification and those who had
[1:13:02] electricity so electricity was not the
[1:13:05] differentiator or the lack of
[1:13:06] electricity was not the differentiator
[1:13:09] it was that those that overcame had a
[1:13:12] tenacity had a Drive had a desire had a
[1:13:17] motivation there was something in them
[1:13:20] that said what my father went through I
[1:13:23] am NOT gonna go through I heard somebody
[1:13:26] say a few days ago he said I grew up in
[1:13:28] abject poverty and I said to myself when
[1:13:32] my son drives the university he's gonna
[1:13:35] drive in on his first day in a
[1:13:36] mercedes-benz and he said what he said
[1:13:39] is his family they say talking
[1:13:40] struffolis
[1:13:41] why are you talking so and he said I
[1:13:43] worked hard he's given a testimony I
[1:13:45] worked hard and I live to see the day my
[1:13:48] son went in a university he drove dinh
[1:13:50] in a mercedes-benz and he was telling a
[1:13:54] group of people he said until you say it
[1:13:56] it could never happen he said the first
[1:14:03] step in saying it because when you say
[1:14:06] it it puts it out there and this man I
[1:14:10] don't know how much of a Christian he is
[1:14:12] I don't know what his testimony is I'm
[1:14:14] seeing but did he read the scriptures we
[1:14:16] read because my Bible says if you shall
[1:14:19] see to this mountain be more and don't
[1:14:22] doubt it's gonna do something and
[1:14:26] natural men break into spiritual
[1:14:28] principles about speaking into existence
[1:14:32] and walking into it what about the
[1:14:34] Church of the Living God
[1:14:36] when we know from the prophets a message
[1:14:38] that the spoken word is the original
[1:14:41] seed and we are commanded as sons and
[1:14:44] daughters to begin to speak I'm gonna
[1:14:47] make it I'm gonna overcome I'm gonna get
[1:14:51] the Holy Ghost my son is
[1:14:53] be delivered I could see him delivered I
[1:14:56] could see him jumping in the church
[1:14:58] that's how we ought to speak I could see
[1:15:00] him doing no ma I could see nobody else
[1:15:03] to ignore my like my son I can see
[1:15:05] nobody else Alton like my daughter I can
[1:15:08] see my wife walking into church one day
[1:15:10] I'm not knowing what pull into the house
[1:15:13] of club that's how we ought to speak
[1:15:16] that's that's how Christians speak
[1:15:18] that's how sons of God speak
[1:15:20] that's how daughters of God speak you
[1:15:24] may be seated
[1:15:26] who tournament overcoming this morning
[1:15:29] life is a struggle that's a foundational
[1:15:34] fact of life it is designed to be a
[1:15:38] struggle it's a struggle for food if you
[1:15:43] study biology to see the strong survive
[1:15:47] so the lion who is slow and can't
[1:15:50] exhibits tells he will need because as
[1:15:55] he moves surely jungle everybody am
[1:15:57] coming vitami reach everybody go so
[1:16:02] depending on a situation that you have
[1:16:04] to overcome in you have to understand
[1:16:07] your terrain understand your challenge I
[1:16:10] would say to somebody recently that's
[1:16:12] why Paul could say to the strong I
[1:16:14] became strong to the weak I became weak
[1:16:17] because he understood that to overcome
[1:16:20] in different situations you can't use
[1:16:22] the same tactic all the time bear in
[1:16:25] mind the end game is to get the O levels
[1:16:28] from one form to form three from four
[1:16:31] from fact that's a journey but after the
[1:16:34] journey and their people the journey is
[1:16:35] different you know people who play
[1:16:36] sports in school I wasn't one of them
[1:16:38] the people look to different things and
[1:16:40] I said you're wrong with that and the
[1:16:42] journey is grit there are people that is
[1:16:44] 50 per her ailments in primary school
[1:16:53] and it's over like I want to go back to
[1:16:55] secondary school when they had no bills
[1:16:57] cuz I'm technically no bills no call
[1:17:01] from the bank to pay a credit card and
[1:17:04] school it was the best but that was a
[1:17:11] stage in your journey because even
[1:17:15] though all levels is a stage to prepare
[1:17:18] you for a job and life is about stages
[1:17:23] and God is also about stages so when I
[1:17:25] was a child I spake as a child I
[1:17:27] understood as a job when I became a man
[1:17:30] I want to go back to primary school when
[1:17:35] I begin a man I put away the childish
[1:17:41] things when I become a man I listen each
[1:17:47] I'm getting older doesn't make you a man
[1:17:52] there's some 50 year old boy still in
[1:17:55] primary school because as you get older
[1:18:01] it should be you get more mature that's
[1:18:04] that's by design but that's not how
[1:18:06] everybody lives because we allow
[1:18:08] different situation and we and we try to
[1:18:11] preserve an unchanged
[1:18:12] it's what's hard we don't like
[1:18:16] interruption we don't like disruption we
[1:18:18] like to do things the same way so
[1:18:20] whenever change comes in it makes us
[1:18:22] feel uncomfortable but God is it was of
[1:18:25] change you call Abraham he say Abraham
[1:18:26] leave your family leave your comfort
[1:18:28] zone and come follow me
[1:18:31] Abraham had no idea where he was going
[1:18:33] he was being challenged to change him
[1:18:36] I'm coming into this walk I want to call
[1:18:38] it this walk not Church coming into this
[1:18:41] walk it requires a mindset of change of
[1:18:44] growth of development of having to
[1:18:47] overcome and positive this way I die
[1:18:49] daily
[1:18:51] so this overcoming we are speaking about
[1:18:54] is a daily overcoming it's overcoming
[1:19:00] when the pastor is not there to see you
[1:19:02] overcoming when the deacon is not around
[1:19:05] it's overcoming when nobody from church
[1:19:07] is there and you are confronted with
[1:19:09] decisions and you are challenged to
[1:19:12] overcome we're gonna we're gonna get to
[1:19:18] the deeper part I'm just I'm still
[1:19:19] talking to you this morning because
[1:19:23] people tell me I'm struggling and I'm
[1:19:24] struggling and they see it as if it's
[1:19:27] not supposed to be that way as if the
[1:19:32] alternative to struggling is somehow not
[1:19:36] struggling and that doesn't exist
[1:19:40] struggling is a permanent state of
[1:19:42] existence for the believer you struggle
[1:19:47] to pray you you struggle to seek the
[1:19:49] Lord you you struggle because we are in
[1:19:51] a war fear and until we put the devil
[1:19:56] firmly under our feet it will always be
[1:19:59] a battle every inch of ground you intend
[1:20:02] to take will be a struggle a struggle in
[1:20:07] your marriage or struggle in your
[1:20:08] finances a struggle in your prayer life
[1:20:10] I struggle to praise a struggle to
[1:20:13] worship
[1:20:14] that's why TV can see we bring a
[1:20:16] sacrifice of praise into the house of
[1:20:18] the Lord
[1:20:19] sacrifices struggle you have a choice to
[1:20:23] make the live or die to worship was to
[1:20:25] death to give God praise or stay where
[1:20:28] you will but to him that overcometh I
[1:20:33] have rewards for the overcomers
[1:20:37] hallelujah you may be seated
[1:20:44] the challenge I have is people who look
[1:20:48] at those who study hmmm in school either
[1:20:52] Elmer boy you know they're merely when
[1:20:57] he books when he books you need books
[1:20:58] car I saw some young people buckle under
[1:21:03] pressure I know and
[1:21:04] I cannot come and play and life is
[1:21:08] choice so when you confronted with a
[1:21:11] situation if you leave your books
[1:21:14] because your friends selling your yo-yo
[1:21:17] mid and you don't want to be another
[1:21:20] Wendy Henry's outcome and there's some
[1:21:23] students who they play all day in school
[1:21:27] but at night the beaten book
[1:21:32] yeah well kinda at night the beat in a
[1:21:35] real book I want the results coming but
[1:21:38] you explained only time who you get nine
[1:21:40] ones I was studying that night now you
[1:21:44] can't get effects with somebody who put
[1:21:47] the time and effort into achieving go to
[1:21:52] just remarried he don't know what day
[1:21:54] and night and he will have good success
[1:21:56] you can't vet somebody who have good
[1:21:59] success because their merit it really
[1:22:01] would be a night see a man bless he is
[1:22:04] gone ready like him then why he getting
[1:22:06] a blessing and you don't know the hours
[1:22:09] he and you would when in his secret
[1:22:11] closet when you're not looking for
[1:22:12] attention and nobody there but he crying
[1:22:14] and he holding onto the horns of the
[1:22:16] altar because the Bible told us pray in
[1:22:18] secret so that the God that sees in
[1:22:22] secret will reward you openly all of
[1:22:28] that is the struggle but to meet time to
[1:22:34] pray to make time to study to make time
[1:22:37] to be a Christian you have to overcome
[1:22:40] how you manage your time you have to
[1:22:44] overcome the demands of your life your
[1:22:46] work your commitments I remember when I
[1:22:48] was in university soon the bellringer
[1:22:52] had no bail but soon car has denied out
[1:22:54] I had no reason to see to do what to do
[1:22:59] what and I saw young people go to
[1:23:03] university I went class done time the
[1:23:06] lime lime to do what after all these
[1:23:11] years was he equals I'm on that blame
[1:23:13] what does the enemies are worried off
[1:23:15] the show for all the hours you spend
[1:23:17] Lyman
[1:23:19] what is the equal sign of time not spent
[1:23:24] into what is eternal because when you
[1:23:26] spend time into what is temporal there
[1:23:29] will never be anything to show for it
[1:23:31] but when you spend time in the eternal
[1:23:34] there's an eternal house there's an
[1:23:36] eternal Road with gold on it is it
[1:23:40] there's an eternal testimony because you
[1:23:42] are investing in your in who you really
[1:23:45] are
[1:23:46] can the church seem and is this helping
[1:23:49] anybody this morning and the message
[1:23:56] crisis revealed as all word I'm gonna
[1:23:57] take my time this morning so buckle your
[1:24:00] seatbelts
[1:24:01] I wasn't feeling 100% good this morning
[1:24:04] but no I feel 100% good but economy
[1:24:08] there's some viruses good around it that
[1:24:10] was twenty what I've had me this morning
[1:24:12] but I really want to appreciate my wife
[1:24:13] with some ginger tea without sugar this
[1:24:15] morning and some warm water with apple
[1:24:18] cider vinegar and just what he talked to
[1:24:23] order to give the devil trouble so if
[1:24:26] you need to take apple cider and water
[1:24:27] even neater ginger tea or green tea or
[1:24:32] whatever you take you make sure you come
[1:24:33] to the house of the Lord
[1:24:34] at least come the devil if you have no
[1:24:36] teeth if you're walking and I can use
[1:24:40] the cane as a weapon but whatever you
[1:24:42] clock like shamba he does a table scored
[1:24:44] and use what he had because there was a
[1:24:47] cause there was a need there was a
[1:24:49] situation your heart palpitates him
[1:24:54] we'll take it easy but keep coming blood
[1:24:57] pressure low take it easy but keep
[1:24:59] coming
[1:24:59] breakfast I I take it easy but keep
[1:25:01] coming but whatever you do keep on
[1:25:04] moving everything you getting closer to
[1:25:07] your inheritance closer to your portion
[1:25:10] and when it looks like you're getting
[1:25:11] older every step you really getting
[1:25:13] younger because there's another body
[1:25:16] waiting for you a spiritual body to hold
[1:25:20] the seed in your soul and you are
[1:25:22] temporarily carrying because these
[1:25:24] sixteen elements one day there'll be no
[1:25:26] more but we are from
[1:25:28] another place another dimension a place
[1:25:31] where there's no sickness no sadness no
[1:25:33] depression no fear no confusion no
[1:25:37] mortgage no pearls no ups and tolls
[1:25:40] that's where we come from and David he's
[1:25:43] waiting for me Joshua is waiting from me
[1:25:46] Moses is waiting for me to find out how
[1:25:49] you made it over how did you survive
[1:25:52] 2018 of how did you survive this
[1:25:55] internet age somebody preach back to me
[1:25:58] can we get the Lord a shout of praise
[1:26:01] [Music]
[1:26:01] [Applause]
[1:26:09] and this is my inspiration here this
[1:26:12] morning from the message crisis revealed
[1:26:14] his own word preached in Jeffersonville
[1:26:17] Indiana August 22nd 1965 knowing that
[1:26:22] what we see this morning we mustn't just
[1:26:25] see because we are gathered together
[1:26:27] that just haphazardly speak on anything
[1:26:30] but it is it's something that will help
[1:26:33] stabilize the people listen why we need
[1:26:37] the stabilization for we are going to
[1:26:39] pass through dangerous treacherous
[1:26:42] waters
[1:26:43] we're already sealing through them and
[1:26:47] sometimes I guess it's with you like it
[1:26:50] is with me so the Prophet is saying the
[1:26:53] waters he going through I don't know how
[1:26:55] it is for you but I can tell you what me
[1:26:57] is that it seems like so much of it it's
[1:26:59] such a scary so the Prophet as numerous
[1:27:08] visitations of angels and the Prophet is
[1:27:12] saying we want to see something this
[1:27:14] morning because we're gonna pass through
[1:27:15] some dangerous waters you're gonna pass
[1:27:18] through moments in our lives that we
[1:27:20] can't explain up we don't understand out
[1:27:22] there Lord why me why I have to go
[1:27:25] through this I serve you all these years
[1:27:28] why my children are struggling so you're
[1:27:31] I'm gonna see in those treacherous
[1:27:32] waters just keep on walking
[1:27:36] just keep on walking just keep on
[1:27:39] praying just keep on pressing because
[1:27:43] for all of your family that's not here
[1:27:45] you are the wave she you are who's
[1:27:47] rolling on for your brother holding on
[1:27:50] to your sister on and on for your family
[1:27:52] and God has not forgotten you those
[1:27:55] things that are revealed belong to us
[1:27:57] and to our children can the church
[1:28:01] Shaymin so you are born to overcome you
[1:28:06] are born to be successful I'm gonna stop
[1:28:08] when natural says say that spiritually
[1:28:10] you are born to be successful where the
[1:28:13] Branham said ladies you are closed
[1:28:15] advertisement board so when people want
[1:28:17] to see Jesus God already send sons and
[1:28:20] daughters we wouldn't advertise if you
[1:28:24] are an advertisement port for God and
[1:28:26] you ought to be the happiest people on
[1:28:28] the face of the earth because the
[1:28:31] purpose of an advertisement is to bring
[1:28:35] people to buy the product that you
[1:28:38] advertising and this product that we
[1:28:41] have has no price but it's a good
[1:28:43] product
[1:28:43] people just don't know how good it is
[1:28:46] people just don't know how good Jesus
[1:28:49] is people don't know that is a solution
[1:28:52] when you're sick we don't need to go by
[1:28:54] the doctor and people need to know so
[1:28:57] this morning I'm just somebody I'm not
[1:28:59] nobody trying to tell everybody about
[1:29:02] somebody who could save anybody I want
[1:29:06] to be a good advertisement for Jesus I
[1:29:08] want to be a good representative of the
[1:29:11] kingdom and for me to be a good
[1:29:13] representative I've got to be on fire
[1:29:15] I've got to have joy I've got to have
[1:29:18] the Holy Ghost I've got to have seven
[1:29:20] living voices
[1:29:23] [Music]
[1:29:27] can the church say men so you are born
[1:29:32] to overcome overcoming is built in the
[1:29:35] fact that you are here already speaks of
[1:29:37] the fact that you are an overcomer
[1:29:38] because you couldn't just come to this
[1:29:40] church this morning let's go call you
[1:29:42] you couldn't be here this morning unless
[1:29:45] God spoke to your heart
[1:29:46] there are many churches you could go to
[1:29:48] but not this one for you to come to this
[1:29:50] church this morning there has to be
[1:29:51] something in you that's connected to
[1:29:54] your eternal destination this is not a
[1:29:56] Catholic Church not a Methodist Church
[1:29:59] and a Pentecostal Church these are our
[1:30:01] body of believers with three kinds of
[1:30:04] believers but I'm not speaking than am a
[1:30:06] believer this morning or the unbeliever
[1:30:09] this morning because only the true
[1:30:11] believers can overcome but the pranam
[1:30:14] said God can only prove his word by true
[1:30:18] believers so there's got to be some true
[1:30:21] believers who believe in their heart
[1:30:23] that deliverance will not come from man
[1:30:26] what it will come from God himself up he
[1:30:28] will raise the winds he will bring the
[1:30:30] storms up he will bring the earthquakes
[1:30:33] up but he will have every Sun every part
[1:30:36] of every predestinated seed I don't care
[1:30:39] it it at this morning they've got to
[1:30:41] come go give the Lord a shout of praise
[1:30:49] somebody give him praise this morning
[1:30:52] you are gonna be healer you are gonna be
[1:30:55] deliverer
[1:30:56] you are gonna overcome you are gonna get
[1:30:58] the Holy Ghost the pillar of fire is
[1:31:00] gonna visit your house the pillar of
[1:31:02] fire is going to visit your job the
[1:31:05] pillar of fire is going to visit your
[1:31:07] son the pillar of fire will visit your
[1:31:09] daughter it's got to happen how do you
[1:31:14] know God said it the Prophet spoke it
[1:31:17] that settles it for me this morning and
[1:31:19] this morning the testimony of Jesus is
[1:31:22] the spirit of prophecy we are seeing
[1:31:26] what the tapes
[1:31:31] I'm not crazy I'm not crazy I have not
[1:31:35] lost it enough I want to lose it some
[1:31:37] more I want to lose myself in the love
[1:31:40] of God I want to lose myself in the
[1:31:43] goodness of Jesus
[1:31:45] I wonder sing to run over I want this
[1:31:47] cup to run over till everybody must know
[1:31:50] this person is different this young man
[1:31:53] is different this young woman is
[1:31:55] different can the church say man you are
[1:32:01] going to overcome young brother young
[1:32:04] sister I don't care what the world
[1:32:06] offers you it's built in you to overcome
[1:32:11] the desires of this world you may be
[1:32:15] seated the fashions the lust of the eyes
[1:32:19] the lust of the flesh the pride of life
[1:32:22] it's built in you to overcome its
[1:32:29] built-in don't M you can do it don't
[1:32:32] tell me you can dress like a Christian
[1:32:34] don't tell me you kind of act like a
[1:32:36] Christian don't tell me in his hat it's
[1:32:38] not hard for you because you are built
[1:32:40] to struggle it's hard for listen it's
[1:32:45] hard for a car to fly ever punch it's
[1:32:53] hard for a car to fly it's not built to
[1:32:56] fly but the inner is also hard for plane
[1:32:59] to fly because when a plane takes off it
[1:33:03] must pass the sound barrier it must
[1:33:07] break out of gravity that's not easy
[1:33:09] it's hard the difference is the plane is
[1:33:12] built to fly let me see it another way
[1:33:17] if you look at a fish until you fish a
[1:33:20] climb this tree the fish will always be
[1:33:23] a failure because the fish wasn't built
[1:33:28] to climb a tree but a young boy climb
[1:33:32] the tree it'll take a while to get
[1:33:34] comfortable with how to climb a tree
[1:33:36] because if anything you don't know it's
[1:33:39] difficult
[1:33:40] anything that's new it'll take some time
[1:33:43] some experience some experimentation
[1:33:45] some experiential learning for you to to
[1:33:48] be able to do it so the difficulty will
[1:33:51] always exist the differences if you are
[1:33:54] built to do it and that's what we're
[1:33:56] seeing this morning you are built to
[1:33:58] overcome you are built to break past
[1:34:01] gravity you are built to break past like
[1:34:05] the lily who can press through the pond
[1:34:07] that Lily is built for it
[1:34:09] somebody Branson is pushes through the
[1:34:11] mud it pushes through the mire it pushes
[1:34:13] should have felt and it breaks out and
[1:34:17] that's what we want to do this morning
[1:34:19] break out break free break pass every
[1:34:23] limitation break pass every obstacle now
[1:34:26] if you know your destination and you
[1:34:29] know what you're built to do and you
[1:34:32] want you're built for how can you get
[1:34:34] caught up in petty nonsense well I'm
[1:34:38] saying back because he did tell me
[1:34:40] something I never really and then that
[1:34:44] and you look fit I didn't look fit but
[1:34:49] you are built for higher purpose
[1:34:52] I said you put them did nobody nobody
[1:34:57] can make you do anything
[1:34:58] your actions are always your choice yeah
[1:35:04] every set of people trying to fake fight
[1:35:06] of faith who in the back hold my back
[1:35:08] hold the back and happy times boosting
[1:35:13] already afraid man who on the back why
[1:35:23] Adam he tell me he did you have to
[1:35:31] accept responsibility for every action
[1:35:34] every word you can't blame your wife you
[1:35:39] can't blame your husband you can't blame
[1:35:41] me boss the company taxi driver
[1:35:43] you really should affect your vex your
[1:35:46] vex you wish the Church of X but it's
[1:35:48] taxi driver this what I'd have to do
[1:35:50] with your walk with God
[1:35:53] usually a you vex somebody I'd shake
[1:35:56] your hand you there half this is it
[1:35:57] thank you a whole half service to warm
[1:35:59] up who all have you missed the whole
[1:36:03] half of the service because you just
[1:36:05] dealing with products so and so didn't
[1:36:07] greet here long stairs and for the whole
[1:36:09] half service us see any preacher this
[1:36:11] one leader you seen this brother

[1:36:15] loop in your mind that's it enough
[1:36:16] you're my inner we transfer may be
[1:36:19] renewing of your - reboot resets the
[1:36:21] Lord reset this computer be transformed
[1:36:26] by the renewing of your minds of ollie
[1:36:28] to reboot your mind cast own reason
[1:36:31] class down imagination cast it down and
[1:36:34] when you come to the house of God you
[1:36:36] know coming to friends you look up and
[1:36:38] see people you come in for your
[1:36:39] inheritance you come for your portion
[1:36:44] you come because your body and theme and
[1:36:47] the best place to be when pain is in the
[1:36:50] house of God because healing is a
[1:36:52] children's bread we eat healing for
[1:36:54] breakfast that's what we do
[1:36:56] it's our bread is our food here's our
[1:36:59] shoe bread he is our God and if nobody
[1:37:02] wants to worship that's Tim that
[1:37:04] nothing to do with me I was born to
[1:37:07] worship and the hour cometh and now is
[1:37:09] that the true worshipers will worship
[1:37:11] the father in spirit and in truth
[1:37:16] born to overcome born to worship want to
[1:37:20] put the devil under your feet
[1:37:24] hallelujah it doesn't matter the
[1:37:30] situation in your job in your school it
[1:37:34] doesn't matter
[1:37:35] everywhere you go you have a testimony I
[1:37:39] said it indigo Martin a couple months
[1:37:42] ago has a listen find out from hearing
[1:37:44] your neighbors where your testimony and
[1:37:52] if you're Robert estimate your neighbors
[1:37:55] even revisit it has no money
[1:38:01] find out your testimony from your
[1:38:03] co-workers because if your co-workers
[1:38:05] not sure your Christian something wrong
[1:38:09] with your testimony listen don't don't
[1:38:13] have anybody guess who you are your
[1:38:18] neighbors must say listen that house
[1:38:19] right there that houses the Christian
[1:38:21] homes I tell you now house a Christian
[1:38:23] oh let it not be today have a service in
[1:38:31] by your house and I say we I didn't know
[1:38:33] there was no you're singing really
[1:38:43] really and that's why some of us have a
[1:38:50] challenge inviting people a traditional
[1:38:52] because when you invite people now
[1:38:54] people who are around here cannot hold
[1:38:55] your more accountable I was I was ready
[1:38:59] doing a commission of inquiry into the
[1:39:01] inviting ratio and for the source of the
[1:39:03] problem because even a testimony becomes
[1:39:06] easy because people ask you why I'm so
[1:39:08] happy why there's trouble in the economy
[1:39:12] but yet still you're happy you see what
[1:39:15] the Lord is my provider how do I come
[1:39:20] and contact with that Lord who provided
[1:39:21] for you because all of us had trouble
[1:39:23] but if he if you have somebody could
[1:39:24] arrive you I want to meet him too
[1:39:26] inviting people to the house of God
[1:39:29] should be the easiest thing to do
[1:39:30] because this is the best product you
[1:39:32] could ever touch this is the only
[1:39:34] product that have healing salvation
[1:39:37] Redemption adoption deliverance and even
[1:39:41] stuff that hasn't been this plated
[1:39:42] missing limbs be restored is part of our
[1:39:45] package and we got and this is only how
[1:39:50] hard is it and when you can tell
[1:39:51] somebody I mean best part it free
[1:39:55] you gotta pee if it gets come and
[1:39:58] worship just come and enjoy just come on
[1:40:01] dance
[1:40:02] just come on sing yes come on shout
[1:40:04] let's come and give God praise there's
[1:40:07] no cost there's no price he died for you
[1:40:11] [Applause]
[1:40:14] give the Lord a shout of praise I
[1:40:18] haven't even gotten to the message I was
[1:40:20] still having a conversation one day
[1:40:26] where the Terri will just break from the
[1:40:28] church into the eternal realm might
[1:40:31] forget you says you know Alberta Raymond
[1:40:33] said last week he said Enoch was walking
[1:40:36] with God and then one day his foot just
[1:40:37] hit the Kings Highway oh my
[1:40:40] oh what a thought he is walking and I'm
[1:40:43] one of your foot hit the Kings Highway
[1:40:44] one of these morning between 6:00 and
[1:40:46] 9:00 you'll be on your road to the maxi
[1:40:49] on the taxi and your foot will hit the
[1:40:51] Kings Highway and we'll be gone I'm
[1:40:56] looking for that tease anybody else
[1:40:58] looking for that day then can you come
[1:41:00] and go with me to my father's house
[1:41:02] where is joy unspeakable and full of
[1:41:06] glory all right you may be seated now
[1:41:14] let's go back to Genesis God in his mind
[1:41:19] because you see the challenges this when
[1:41:22] people get things easily you'll lose it
[1:41:26] easy I'll say that again when you get
[1:41:32] stuff easy you lose it easily so there
[1:41:40] are many stories of businessmen who
[1:41:43] started with nothing and they sacrifice
[1:41:46] and when he had a story to say they eat
[1:41:48] pig and butter for 10 years 15 years to
[1:41:53] work to build something up this
[1:41:55] sacrifice but their children didn't
[1:41:58] understand or when should he sacrifice
[1:42:01] that they went through so anytime
[1:42:03] company children to take over
[1:42:06] business there are many businesses that
[1:42:09] took 14 years to build up and two years
[1:42:11] to go down because there was no
[1:42:14] sacrifice to build there was no pain in
[1:42:18] growth so Jesus and God himself rather
[1:42:21] when Adam was put in a Garden of Eden
[1:42:23] Adam didn't earn anything he didn't earn
[1:42:28] character from experience from pain but
[1:42:33] on the other side he had Jesus not
[1:42:35] obedience by the thing that he suffered
[1:42:38] but Adam it was handed to him on a
[1:42:45] platter for the Georgia sea and because
[1:42:47] of how it was cotton it could have been
[1:42:50] easily lost and God pledged it will not
[1:42:54] be like that ever again the power to
[1:42:58] reach to anybody they must have
[1:43:00] character and to get character character
[1:43:04] comes by trials by testing by giving you
[1:43:09] exams by putting you under pressure to
[1:43:12] see how you would handle certain
[1:43:14] situations because if you do improve how
[1:43:17] you will handle it so the promises of an
[1:43:32] overcomer that was built into Scripture
[1:43:34] Adam could have never enjoyed because he
[1:43:38] had never overcome anything
[1:43:40] just like the Angels never had anything
[1:43:42] to overcome Adam had no trials no tests
[1:43:46] no problems no sufferings no financial
[1:43:49] problems no problems in his marriage no
[1:43:51] all the animals listen to him Nonnie
[1:43:53] early animals back shot when he
[1:43:58] mountains was spoken to the mountains
[1:44:00] moved Adam had nothing to overcome Adam
[1:44:04] could have never been called an
[1:44:06] overcomer
[1:44:07] because there was nothing to overcome
[1:44:10] everybody with me Adam had a book of
[1:44:14] names and Adams mission was just to call
[1:44:17] from this book of memes
[1:44:19] the time and season and they were could
[1:44:21] be made manifest but Adams Ellingson
[1:44:25] before he had the chance to call one
[1:44:27] name can assure it's a man but in that
[1:44:37] book in the book that Adam had but the
[1:44:41] Branham said there's a category of that
[1:44:43] book which he tied to scripture it says
[1:44:46] in revelation 3:5 he that overcometh the
[1:44:50] same shall be clothed in white raiment
[1:44:52] and I will not blot out his name out of
[1:44:55] the book of life but I will confess his
[1:44:57] name before my father and before his
[1:45:00] angels so there's a section of the book
[1:45:03] that has do not remove that their names
[1:45:07] could never be blacked out because they
[1:45:08] overcome you know what it is to know
[1:45:11] that you overcome and God say listen you
[1:45:13] overcome that name could never come out
[1:45:15] because that type of overcoming God
[1:45:17] honors that type of overcoming somebody
[1:45:20] preached back to me so one of the
[1:45:23] rewards of the overcomers is to he that
[1:45:26] overcometh the same shall be clothed in
[1:45:28] white raiment and I will not blot out
[1:45:30] his name so am i preaching overcomers
[1:45:33] this morning and for those of you who
[1:45:37] have been long on the overcoming scale
[1:45:41] you try to overcome sometimes you want
[1:45:44] to overcome some things and it would
[1:45:45] want to overcome anything that you want
[1:45:47] to overcome but it's in that you know
[1:45:48] wonder overcome you don't want to
[1:45:49] overcome missing life is about choice so
[1:45:56] things you want to overcome you want
[1:45:58] anything to do at that you enjoy you
[1:45:59] want blessing with a nice car Laura you
[1:46:01] know overcome and if I get a car do

[1:46:35] overcoming I overcoming to I get Iike
[1:46:38] but overcoming I'm talking about is
[1:46:40] overcoming in every area of your life
[1:46:43] overcoming when you don't feel like
[1:46:44] green but you still pray anyhow
[1:46:47] overcoming when you want to answer black
[1:46:49] but you overcome and you're still silent
[1:46:52] that's the overcoming we'd already won
[1:46:55] to do it because it goes against our
[1:46:57] very nature you overcome when you want
[1:47:00] you feel like staying home and when you
[1:47:02] overcome death and you press you to come
[1:47:03] to the house of God
[1:47:04] that's overcoming you overcome when you
[1:47:07] open your wardrobe and you look at your
[1:47:09] cloth to recognize we're gonna discuss a
[1:47:11] little too short I have to overcome and
[1:47:13] burn it finally Amen Saturn you

[1:47:34] end of somebody preach flat to me this
[1:47:38] morning

[1:47:43] when the boys come to the young sisters
[1:47:45] and say look and you overcome and you
[1:47:49] walk away because you know you are
[1:47:50] princess you born of a king and God has
[1:47:53] a prince for you you overcome want to
[1:47:58] overcome every temptation every desire
[1:48:02] every opportunity that the devil
[1:48:05] presents your way you overcome it
[1:48:07] because you are born to overcome
[1:48:11] overcome music but with a nice song it
[1:48:15] it is a nice song it's slow its it'll
[1:48:20] put any mood what mood
[1:48:29] but they overcome overcome the music
[1:48:37] that's supposed to be Christian music -
[1:48:39] that makes you want to dance not like a
[1:48:41] Christian but he devil using all it is
[1:48:44] to to pull you down and you're overcome
[1:48:46] method see that's not what motivates me
[1:48:49] [Music]
[1:48:51] yeah appetite is changing your desires
[1:48:55] changing you don't want to look sexy
[1:48:59] that's not your objective you reject
[1:49:01] that you overcome that you're bigger
[1:49:03] than that you're more precious than then
[1:49:05] you overcome though he slay me yet still
[1:49:10] I trust them I'm an overcomer but they
[1:49:14] laugh at me in school you are an
[1:49:16] overcomer let them laugh it does not
[1:49:18] matter porn to overcome I said it um and
[1:49:26] many Youth Services say young sisters
[1:49:28] you don't need to put on makeup or semi
[1:49:31] makeup or half makeup or quarter makeup
[1:49:33] god made you beautiful as you are
[1:49:35] if those worldly ladies need makeup to
[1:49:37] look at that's damn that's not you feel
[1:49:40] sorry for them
[1:49:46] you need to drink to be a man smoke to
[1:49:49] be a man run woman to be a man that you
[1:49:51] overcome all of that and that's a baby
[1:49:54] stop you gotta babysit present your
[1:49:56] bodies a living sacrifice
[1:49:58] that's your reasonable service
[1:50:01] reasonable having a testimony to
[1:50:07] millions or to Colonel we in the flesh
[1:50:12] too much and it's impossible to be in
[1:50:15] the flesh if you know that and you pray
[1:50:17] in any Italian and seeking the Lord it's
[1:50:20] impossible to get off your knees and say
[1:50:23] boy you touch my things for if you were
[1:50:26] praying and that's your quick response
[1:50:28] from praying I don't know what anointing
[1:50:30] you was just breathe but when you pray
[1:50:37] me get him on something the services
[1:50:38] don't know Lord this is a test and he
[1:50:48] let God work it out say Lord I leave
[1:50:50] this one to you because if I had it I
[1:50:53] would have a little wrong so I want to
[1:50:55] get back and it's a different
[1:50:56] consciousness it's conscious that every
[1:50:59] way you go God goes with you when you
[1:51:01] walk into your job he is looking there
[1:51:03] for you and if everywhere you walk you
[1:51:05] know he's dear how would we speak how
[1:51:07] would we live how would we act how would
[1:51:09] we dress what would we see the rewards
[1:51:17] of the overcomers so I'm speaking to
[1:51:20] over comers
[1:51:21] because in every area of your life you
[1:51:24] must overcome hallelujah and the message
[1:51:29] how can I overcome but the balance that
[1:51:31] I think that the church maybe should be
[1:51:33] taking this a step higher at this time
[1:51:35] and that's what I'm pushing for to go a
[1:51:37] little higher at this time and where the
[1:51:39] problem said in the same message how can
[1:51:41] I overcome now we're speaking on this
[1:51:43] overcoming the word overcome of course
[1:51:47] you know what it means
[1:51:47] you've got to have something to overcome
[1:51:50] there is a Goliath in all of our lives
[1:51:59] God sets up stuff in our lives for us to
[1:52:03] overcome it will not be the same for you
[1:52:07] it will not be the same for you but
[1:52:09] there'll be stuff in your life for some
[1:52:10] of us is gossip for some of us itself we
[1:52:17] just have so much self god within a
[1:52:19] break that self to pieces for some of us
[1:52:22] we just holy we didn't our mind we holy
[1:52:24] and we judge everybody by your standard
[1:52:28] not your word now by your standard I
[1:52:29] don't do this and that's why the Upper
[1:52:34] Room brought it equal and when we come
[1:52:38] to church is no big you little me listen
[1:52:40] I am no way no way above nobody no I am
[1:52:44] here this morning preaching to myself so
[1:52:47] even thought I was talking about you
[1:52:48] you're wrong I preached it myself I want
[1:52:53] to be different I want to change I want
[1:52:56] to be a real Christian in my heart I
[1:52:58] want to walk like you might want to talk
[1:53:00] like him I want to live like him I wanna
[1:53:02] act like him I wanna be like him when
[1:53:04] people see me they must not talk that's
[1:53:07] a Christian when they see me they must
[1:53:09] take note that I've been with Jesus
[1:53:11] that's my desire is it your desire then
[1:53:15] if it's your desire may appear unto you
[1:53:18] according to your heart's desire I asked
[1:53:23] a question this morning if Almighty God
[1:53:26] would grant the desire of your heart
[1:53:28] right now what is that desire if right
[1:53:33] now he were to grant to decide what is
[1:53:35] your desire just this morning
[1:53:37] why did you come to church this morning
[1:53:39] is it to go back home is it to just be
[1:53:43] in church or is it to be change to be
[1:53:46] transformed cut out the evil ways of get
[1:53:49] closer to him to know who you are to
[1:53:53] want to change your appetite from the
[1:53:57] things of the world from your own
[1:53:59] desires and is the Lord yeah
[1:54:02] yeah my lord send me Lord I don't have
[1:54:06] much but I given you all I have Lord I
[1:54:08] mean me this morning I've been coming up
[1:54:11] a long time but I need something more
[1:54:13] this morning than yesterday I'm ready to
[1:54:18] overcome myself you know but I better
[1:54:20] say see when you lift your hand as a
[1:54:21] sign of surrender when you surrender
[1:54:25] your efforts your activity Lord I give
[1:54:27] up I've tried my own way but lord I
[1:54:30] surrender but the random said you've got
[1:54:41] to have something to overcome and this
[1:54:44] church age that the Holy Spirit was
[1:54:46] speaking about here at the lair of CNC
[1:54:48] age as we have been through it needed a
[1:54:51] rebuking Laodicea had to be rebuked
[1:54:55] because it was different towards Christ
[1:54:57] in other words the attitude towards
[1:54:59] Christ was a little different it is not
[1:55:02] how it was supposed to be what I would
[1:55:04] used to be but it was a little different
[1:55:06] and if you are here this morning and
[1:55:08] your attitude towards God is a little
[1:55:11] different then you need a rebuking it
[1:55:17] had put Christ outside in the age and
[1:55:21] Christ was on the outside trying to get
[1:55:24] back on the inside but the man said
[1:55:27] that's love and this morning he is he
[1:55:31] said if he said I stand at the door and
[1:55:33] knock and if any man here this morning
[1:55:36] open open his heart I will come in he's
[1:55:41] not trying to break down your heart he's
[1:55:43] there to break it to your house into
[1:55:45] your family but he's there knocking on
[1:55:48] the door of your heart this morning so
[1:55:53] you can overcome more than you've ever
[1:55:54] overcome before because greater is he
[1:55:57] that will be in you than he that's in
[1:55:59] the world is there anybody want to let
[1:56:02] him in this morning let him in every
[1:56:06] area of your heart he is still standing

[1:57:00] believe in my heart before this services
[1:57:04] over healings will break forth I believe
[1:57:06] in my heart that before this service is
[1:57:08] over
[1:57:08] a backslider will be restored I believe
[1:57:11] in my heart before this service is over
[1:57:14] yes somebody could be filled with a
[1:57:16] baptism of the Holy Ghost and fire I
[1:57:18] asked is anything too hard for the Lord
[1:57:20] this morning listen to the Prophet he
[1:57:36] said that's love that's a lot of people
[1:57:38] don't know what love is but he said
[1:57:41] that's love we were born for him to be
[1:57:45] there we are the ones who put him out
[1:57:48] but the problem said if you want to find
[1:57:50] God he said God is right wherever you
[1:57:52] left him because he will never leave you
[1:57:55] he said if you want to reconnect with
[1:57:58] God go back the way you walked away
[1:58:00] because it's not in God to walk away
[1:58:03] it's not his nature to walk away he is
[1:58:06] the one that goes after the one sheepies
[1:58:09] don't wanna knock on the door he's the
[1:58:11] one that
[1:58:11] oh come on somebody preach back to me
[1:58:14] it's not in his nature to abandon you
[1:58:17] said I will never leave you I'll never
[1:58:18] forsake you so if you have lost your
[1:58:21] connection
[1:58:22] God the Prophet said walk back trace
[1:58:25] black your steps to where you left him
[1:58:28] because he will never leave you I don't
[1:58:31] feel the annoying thing anymore I don't
[1:58:34] feel I'm praying anymore I don't feel I
[1:58:37] don't blame God for that
[1:58:39] don't hold court accountable for that
[1:58:42] that's nothing to him that's on you
[1:58:44] reverse your steps walk back to the
[1:58:47] altar this morning and say Lord I'm
[1:58:50] sorry for walking away I'm sorry for
[1:58:52] missing church I'm sorry for not praying
[1:58:54] and I'm coming back to the heart of

[1:59:06] getting away we let our commitments get
[1:59:08] it away and God is still there you still
[1:59:11] even when we walk away he's still
[1:59:13] knocking he's still knocking this
[1:59:20] morning he's still knocking this morning

[2:02:38] that could stop you from coming to God
[2:02:41] he said my sheep hear my voice
[2:02:44] sheep didn't know my voice yes sheep oh
[2:02:47] come on somebody please back to me this
[2:02:50] morning let us not be a tradition to you
[2:03:10] let us not be a routine for you let us
[2:03:14] not be something that you just do
[2:03:15] because you want to come to church
[2:03:20] the road to hell is paved with good
[2:03:23] intentions
[2:03:24] people have good intentions plenty plans
[2:03:27] plenty things they want to do and good
[2:03:30] heart good desires but God is not
[2:03:31] measuring heart and he's he's looking
[2:03:34] for that life if the desire the
[2:03:36] intention and the heart doesn't
[2:03:38] translate into our life it's not enough
[2:03:44] you have to overcome I want to continue
[2:03:48] but now notice in school here is not to
[2:03:52] just the church he that overcometh see
[2:03:55] not the church that would be she see the
[2:03:59] church body but it's he that overcometh
[2:04:01] and by the branch had overcome and keeps
[2:04:04] life in you so when you back up and
[2:04:09] backslide and say well because under
[2:04:11] pressure that's why you're not seeing
[2:04:12] man and because under pressure I just
[2:04:15] going through something you're dying but
[2:04:19] overcoming keeps life in you overcoming
[2:04:24] keeps life in you overcoming keeps you
[2:04:26] alive the Bible is a book of overcoming
[2:04:29] this message this morning is
[2:04:31] immeasurable will come and when calling
[2:04:34] the beginning said let there be light
[2:04:36] that like to overcome the darkness that
[2:04:39] was there the very first beginning of
[2:04:43] Genesis and God said let there be light
[2:04:45] that's where overcoming started
[2:04:48] and the darkness had to back up because
[2:04:52] light and tactics cannot stay in the
[2:04:54] same house and against darkness in your
[2:04:57] house this morning we said let there be
[2:04:59] light in every house in every heart
[2:05:03] let there be light in every marriage let
[2:05:05] there be hot
[2:05:06] let there be light in every situation
[2:05:08] let there be light on your job let there
[2:05:11] be light in your school
[2:05:12] let there be light in your financial
[2:05:14] situation let there be light in your
[2:05:17] body and push back the darkness of
[2:05:19] sickness let there be light
[2:05:23] because light and darkness cannot stay
[2:05:26] in the same house if there's a darkness
[2:05:28] of doubt the darkness of unbelief the
[2:05:30] darkness of an identity crisis because
[2:05:33] you don't know who you are
[2:05:34] let there be light this morning and see
[2:05:38] the darkness back up Oh hallelujah
[2:05:42] hallelujah hallelujah and when light
[2:05:46] comes darkness cannot stand a chance
[2:05:49] never never never stand a chance this
[2:05:55] morning in the light of the revealed
[2:05:57] wood has brought by our prophet William
[2:06:00] Branham shine in your life and push back
