take your seats just like you open your bibles to ecclesiastes chapter 11 we want to read verse 1 to 6. josiah chapter six we want to read from one to three and revelation chapter 22 we want to read 10 to 17. we're so glad to be here this morning reading ecclesiastes chapter 6 verse 1 cast thy bread upon the waters for those shall finish after many days give a portion to seven also to eat and thou shalt know is not what evil shall be upon the earth if the clouds be full of rain they empty themselves upon the earth and if the tree fall towards the south or towards the north and the place where the tree falls there it shall be he that observed the wind shall not sow and he that regarded the clouds shall not reap i want to read from mosaic chapter 6 read in verse 1 come let us return unto the lord for he attorned and he will heal us he had smitten he will bind us up after two days will he revive us on the third day he will raise us up and we shall live in his sight then shall we know if we follow on to know the lord his going forth is prepared as the morning he shall come unto us as the rain the latter and the former rain unto the earth and reading revelation chapter 22 reading from verse 10 and he said unto me see not the saiyans of the prophecy of this book for the time is at hand he is unjust let him be unjust still he which is filthy let him be filthy still he that is righteous let him be righteous still he that is holy let him be holy still and behold i come quickly my reward is with me to give every man according to his work shall be i'm alpha omega the beginning and the end the first and the last blessed are they that do his commandments that they may have right to the tree of life and may enter into the gates unto the city for without our dogs and sorcerers and whole mongers and murderers are the letters and whosoever love it and make it the lie i jesus sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches and the root and the offspring of david the bright and morning star and the spirit and the bride say come let him that his spirits say come and let him do the taste come and whosoever will let him take the water of life freely may god bless his word you may be seated o praise his wonderful name hallelujah praise be to jesus in the amplified that's the last scripture we read it said behold i'm coming soon and i shall bring my wages and rewards with me to repay and render to each one just what his own actions on his own work merit let me read that again behold i am coming soon and i will bring my wages and rewards with me to repay and render each one just what his own actions and his own work merit not talk but action there's gonna come a time when the actions will be the fruit of your talk whatever talk is irrelevant it's going to come where how you act what you do what you manifest is what you are hallelujah who is 14 blessed happy to be envy that those who clean their garments that they may have the authority and right to approach the tree of life hallelujah praise the name of the lord thank you lord jesus you love him praise be to jesus so we're looking forward for a grand new year a grand time in the lord amen i believe oh my title the time is at hand of a subject the prophetic vision of the end time another inspiration is of hebrews 10 23 let us hold fast the profession of our fate without wavering for he is faithful that promised hallelujah that's my inspiration let us hold fast the profession of our fate without wavering for he is faithful that promise i have a two context scripture you don't have to find it i'm going to read it for you it's from revelation 10 and that is from verse 8 11. just really quickly and the voice which i heard from heaven speak unto me as again said go and take the little book which is opening the hand of the angel which stand upon the scene upon the earth and i went to the angel and said give me the little book now this is another one man scripture because john represented the bride okay so give me a little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make my belly bitter but it shall be in my mouth sweetest honey and i took the little book out of the angel's hand eat it up and it was in my mouth recent honey and as soon as i eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me though must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings oh praise the name of the lord so that book brings on that prophecy that spirit of prophecy isn't that right that will come upon the bride and the other context scripture i had from revelation 19 it said verse 7 let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb is come and his wife had made herself ready so this bride will get a revelation to become wife his wife had made herself ready that is not church natural light church spiritual his wife had made herself ready his wife will do something and become ready oh hallelujah because brother branham brought the close of the word but you have to address yourself [Applause] everything for the rapture is in the word hallelujah you have to take the clues you have to become ready you have to want to be ready i want to be ready i want to be ready i want to be ready to walk in jerusalem just like john will you be ready will you be ready will you be ready to walk in jerusalem just like john hallelujah gave him some praises people [Applause] and to her was granted that she should be arraigned and finally and clean and white for the final is the righteousness of saints and he said unto me right oh this is beautiful blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb how are you complaining about that hold your heart be pressed under that how are you frustrated under that blessing that day that are called to the marriage top of the lamb god rest anointing upon you and say you are blessed to just get a call this is a call for a higher job please not call for promotion this has caused a bigger pay this is the marriage up of the lamb [Applause] oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah he said unto my say unto me these are the true sayings of god and i fell at his feet to worship him and he said unto me see thou do it is not i am thy fellow servant and i have thy virgin that have the testimony of jesus worship god for the testimony of jesus is the spirit of prophecy so when god sent a prophet to reveal seven seals open up the prophetic vision it was to release that spirit of prophecy that would give the bride the testimony of jesus oh glory to god so all these years we are walking around with the testimony of jesus which is the spirit of prophecy after taking the open book according to scripture to prophesy about the bride's revival to prophesy away to them seven thunders after their voices in that group they're gonna slice and cut like the talk that's a manifestation what we see should make a church that would make a seventh under revival that people will come to see what is being manifested not as what being taught not what being explained but what is being manifested i say that time is at hand for a bright revival when the enemy comes like a flood the spirit of god praises standards [Applause] [Music] glory you maybe see that i don't want something you come here for but i come in the preacher without god i have a message to deliver oh glory to god i know come what you're coming to hear but i am a word from the lord oh glory to god at the time is at hand and the prophetic vision is here that's what the prophet come to do to bring a prophetic vision to turn our ass back to the faith of the fathers that will be that focus oh glory we know where we come from we know where we go into oh hallelujah let me see that praise god hallelujah for the testimony of jesus is the spirit of prophecy and the prophecy could only come from the book so we cannot prophesy something that is not in the book it has to be the book because the lamb opened the book give it to the prophet the prophet gave it to the bride and there was supposed to be a fightful ministry saying what the texts say not interpreting what the tapes say but speaking what the tips say by revelation [Applause] because this vision that we connected with is what was sealed in daniel when god told daniel go that way the book is closed until the time of the end some end time people going to come in the end time for the time of the end did you hear what i'm saying you are not just normal people you are end time people we gonna close time we gonna close because in the end the seventh seal is the end of all things it's the end of the files the end of the plagues the end of struggling nature when the seven seals break [Music] [Applause] let me see this [Applause] to me we have the testimonies yes and that has been misunderstood because it's the spirit of prophecy prove isaac i can't prove isaac is in revelation hallelujah the transformation of syria happened yet prove this and prove that we can't prove nothing we say god's natural plural you have this through your new name we have this we have nothing we have the testimony of jesus take that devil oh glory to god we have the spirit of prophecy we know it's going to happen because god is a lie if god say you will be delivered you're going to be delivered if god say obesity you're going to be sealed if god sail be free only free [Applause] guarantee god can't lie there's gonna be a revival in trinidad a holy ghost revival a seven thunder revival nothing will stop it and when i say nothing i mean nothing you know i mean lucy himself nothing will stop it because the mount of the lord had spoken it and god said my word shall not return void oh glory glory to god hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah but it shall accomplish [Music] we have the christians we are christ nancy stories we are preaching dreams we appreciate what we feel i am is some angels is a medicine i already have the seventh angel i am no other angel [Applause] why are you talking you're talking with that prophet talk because if you're asking with that prophet talk move go by somewhere a minister go buy some other bishop don't come here because i better say what that angel that prophecy oh give the lord a shout we challenge my angel wing angel any kind of angel but this word has got to come to pass oh my my my oh you may be seasoned hallelujah glory [Applause] verse 11 we're still trying to read the context scripture this is something [Music] but unless you don't really contact with them verse 11 i saw heaven open and behold a white horse and he that sat upon him was called faithful and true and in righteousness he dot make judge and make war his eyes were a flame of fire on his head worked many crowns he had a name written that no man knew but he himself and he was clothed with a vestia dipped in blood and his name is called the word of god and the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses clothed in fine linen clean and white and out of his mouth go with a sharp sword that with it he should smite the nations and he will rule them with radar iron and he treaded a wine press of the fierceness of the wrath of almighty god and he had on his vesture and an entire name written king of kings and lord of lords no wonder the scriptures say no weapon form against you going to prosper because the one who is leading us is the king of king the lord of lords he's coming for war he's coming from backer he's coming with a sword he is coming with his people oh give the lord i shout this morning [Applause] glory let me be seated iran have a general i think his name is suleimani or something like that powerful guy he is a feared and revered person i understand bush didn't try to take him out because they know that will cause obama didn't try to take him out because they know that what would cause president trump take him out he feel led or moved or was inspired to take out it take him out no tokens upon tossing a matching and this is the news for the first time in the history mosque in iran raised the red flag of vengeance and war a red flag was raised over the holy dome of jakarta mosque symbolizing both blood spill unjustly and serving a call to avenge people who killed those who want to avenge the blood of hussein the war flag reads these words the red flag is on top one of the biggest and most important mosque in holy city of quam this was done in honor of qasem surimani and other officers who was assassinated by the us therefore iran pledged that it will avenge their martyrdom and when they pledge that they're different from western people you know we just pledge and forget we pledge not them their anointing is different when they pledge they pledge and i want you when you pledge he said i pledge that i will pray every day until this structure flow in this by being a month till i become living christ till i become a living manifestation of god we want that kind of pledge we want people to pledge oh glory to god that you will die out that you will pray until everyone virtues become resident [Applause] you may be seated they don't care just keep the pledge they'll bump me out if they want blow up their servant whatnot listen to what the prophet said live or die fell fellow friend let them virtues live in me whether i maintain my family or not [Applause] let christ live in me oh lord is my prayer live or die money or no money husband or no husband girlfriend or not your old friend boyfriend or no boyfriend it doesn't matter [Applause] we're living in the closing of this world history the gentile dispensation is winding up just like he did with the jews [Music] he is showing great measure of grace to them making his last call so that the unbelievers will blaspheme the holy ghost and be worthy of condemnation that they are fixing to receive god so god will do things set things up a certain way and when people begin to blaspheme the judgment begin to hang over them do you know right now the seal hanging over you some of you didn't get that do you know right now the seal of god is hanging over you you are marked to be sealed [Applause] i can't mark you no minister can mark you the income writer you may be seated before judgment struck [Music] [Applause] [Applause] thank ezekiel 9 he cried in my ears with all voicing caused them that charged over the city to draw near even every man with his destroying ripple in his hand and the old six men came from the way of the higher gate which lied towards the north every man slaughtered a weapon in his hand and one man among them was clothed with linen with a right horns ink on my side and they went in and stood beside the brazen altar the glory of god of israel gone up from the cherub whereupon he was unto the treachery of the house and he called to the man crow with linen which is had to write an ink on my side and the lord said unto him go through the midst of the city to the midst of jerusalem instead of mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and cry for all the abominations that be done in the midst thereof and to the others he said in my hearing go after him through the city and smite let not to i spear neither have pity slay utterly old young maids little children and woman but come not near any man upon whom is the mark and begin at my sanctuary then they began the ancient men that were born before the house a lot of people in this message think god is a good god all the time there's an expression they don't understand it's the same god that brought israel out it's the same god that judged them it's the same lord that killed them in the wilderness is the same god there's only just one caleb and a bunch of young people cross over oh you know what i said [Applause] 400 years the generations are suffering in egypt god prophesy i'm mighty i'm gonna bring them out but little did they know they're gonna perish they were carriers like shock the seed was in their loins their seed was in the next generation the men and women to possess the land was in their loins and god let them went to the wilderness he wasn't compromising with his word he said i'm gonna give you a land by myself have i sworn in blessed i will bless thee and multiply and multiply thy seed [Applause] all who you love all who love you be with you nice phrase nice nice expression nice night talk you have to do better than that when you say the time is at hand you know the next scripture was there he just failed to be filthy still he is righteous righteous still here is holy holy time is a hand to take a snap and when that picture is snapped whatever conditioning it freezes you're unjust contrasting you're unrighteous and righteous still you're unholy unholy still you're holy holy still this is not a game every fellow has to come to a time to make a decision there's a time where you make a decision whether you're going to be married or not decision your girlfriend has to make whether you're going to live together or get married or not there are all kinds of decisions to be made in life they will linger along for a certain period then a time comes when it got to be settled so once their decisions you can play time and play it but it comes coming come up to you decisions come up to you you could give it time but you're coming up to a point where you're going to force the issue in other words you're going to force your hand to act and decide what you want to do if god be god serve him why hold you between two opinions hallelujah [Applause] that's the last time it's got to happen one way or the other and christian friend i believe we live in the end time that's when all things that are written in the bible is time now for all these things to come to pass and i believe that the very things that we see happening now is just exactly in season with god's word there was a time when the hebrew children had to make their stand whether they were going to bow down the hidden image and whether they're going to keep their fate that you were living god whether they will pray and so on them guys mark the behavior of the believers in that time and decide to get this statue for them to bow down and they can't pray and whatnot then fellas slam you open pray normal normal normal [Music] but if if there wasn't praying they couldn't get out there there wasn't frightening clothes now you don't say you know lord have mercy if you're not praying you can't come you can't match up with them you know because they had a consistency they're not praying no one again you have to come into a consistency in prayer how much time do muslims pray a day on the plane they put out a matter writing where they get girl mata milan pray i know how they know when in his son when he's on ryzen's thing because he's inside the plane but the praying christians gain a problem they wearing black long dress long dress you seen toes black socks you see in their eyes only and sun hot and christians getting problems struggling to cover their knees you can't be qualified to be a good muslim not even mozingo wanda and these people walk in the street with a smile they're walking proud let's continue god here we go daniel when he speaks anything he forces it into the place and daniel had to make a decision he went straight to the space of worship raised his windows and worshiped god and god protected his prophet god will always do it the time has come now for us to realize these things the time has come when god is breaking the boundaries down and the time has come when that devil is rising like a white lion going about roaring everything he can but the great battle is being set so god has to set us up for the battle if you ain't ready it will fight your ever be able to fight any battle the bible said when the enemy coming like a flood the spirit raises a standard and the prophet said the spirit raising the standard by making the world more positive because we have to raise rate for the time when the time is not yet you have to wait so god raises standard by making the world more positive in you so amidst abraham experience god to encourage him so when the angels came down he said i come to you to come again i come to remind you of your promise i will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life when abraham saw the angel he's oh gosh i can't make transformation oh gosh i cannot exact no no no no not yet i cannot tell you i coming so keep on prophecy you stand for 25 years oh hallelujah but at the time of life are coming back not in angel form not in man form not in messenger form not in flesh form but in power form shout out power shout out power one more time shout out power power not man power [Applause] why ain't nobody push no man on me i ain't pushing no man on you don't look for no man you have to look for the power the same power that struck abraham the same power that struck sarah that's empowered to strike you that same power struck them in the upper room was no man come along in the upper room explaining to them how to be a son of god come on people to me the power came upon them and placed them positionally and a cusp of fisherman said this is that that the prophet [Applause] and power hit him so he said this is that that the prophet jewel speak of hallelujah dynamics but clarity that there'll be no more confusion there was no confusion this is that there is no confusion because the manifestation is the interpretation all in the guarantees we don't need you to explain it let's see what you got come on now preach back to me come back come on now let's see what you've got if you don't have it you've got it again come on preach back to me come on say him to somebody [Applause] [Music] when god spoke to abraham and he received isaac a substance faith within him he couldn't share that with sarah that is his faith that is his revelation that is his testimony that is his prophecy he had to watch his ring of his wife and prophesy over her you have to watch her body getting hold and prophesy over her you have to keep her right there and not divorce her because that is the woman that god said by sarah you're gonna have this son call isaac okay the lord i shout sarah had our own interpretation to use hagar but

[Applause] you may be seated people tell me i can't preach because i only caught in nine continents we are cutting seeds of promises because when jesus recognized he had to die and everything else he said destroy this body and three that raises up jesus talking on top of your head he's talking because david prophesied david prophesied i shall not suffer my holy one to seek corruption not leave his soul in hell so jesus knew by revelation he could rest his soul on david's prophecy [Applause] i daniel read my books what the prophet jeremiah spoke i understood that the time was around to get out

the time has come for you make a decision i trust god that you make a decision that you will follow the lamb oh hallelujah daniel 12 5 shut up the words daniel the book is sealed till the time of the end but in revelation 10 three and four seven thunders out to the voices the ball to right here seated up the book is now open but the mystery seal there only for the bride exclusive bright promise

remember she said so the mystery of god come dance from god because god is ever mysterious so the mystery have to come down it'd have to come long as the word but in it have mysteries and it is seen have hidden stuff but glory to god that's why god is hidden in this word he has been his word hiding and when you the elect open the word he said look me here look me here i was in joseph i was in daniel i was in paul i looked me here did you know you're only looking for greek and latin and they're interpreting this and figuring it out you have figured out nothing all you know is the same god that was in abraham saying god double moses that shame god is with me because he said i'll never leave you i never take you but i'll be with you even in your [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] if you confess jesus with your lips it won't do no good but from your heart if you believe jesus is the son of god you can't live the same life you want to live you can't if you ever get a true view of calvary or if you just take in a past that way you're fooling yourself but when you really get a view of what jesus was who am i how i like to preach the deity the supreme deity of jesus christ if you could ever realize who he was and what he did for you men and women your hearts would reign within you you'll be willing to throw away the trash of the world to live for him how marvelous what a person he was if you realize condescending of god himself unfolding himself coming down till he could get into your heart the purpose of the word is to present a channel that god could ride in here [Applause] the word is the conductor of the spirit so before the spirit could come there's a whom he hath believed you were sealed with that spirit of promise because the word gave you a channel to access god adam fell from the word and because of that he couldn't stay in perfection god had to put him out because that gardner even was prepared for perfection so adam fell from the image of god so god has to kick him out but god purposed to restore back the image which is the first man that god made back in the earth so adam was placed an adult he never went through process and he fell because he didn't go through the process so god purpose money coming that way again he's going to process he himself accept the process a virgin shall conceive he himself stopped from baby and that is the christmas story [Applause] jehovah jehovah's the baby hallelujah go into the process because you know you have to go to the process hallelujah give you a scripture in the beginning was the word the word was with god the word was god with god and the word was god he came onto his own his own receive them not but as many as receive him to them give power to become the sons of god power to be transformed power to change you power power power not interpretation not letter power that's why i'm making shadow power you need power every hour to be true you need power you need to ask for power you must want this power don't just come and listen to say amen you're saying amen to pull along the power oh give the lord a shout oh glory though we ain't playing with this power [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] i'll get 30 on that let me say it again good if the press come down right now this day fifth of january twenty twenty is i'm not taking it it's because you have to be in the atmosphere and ready for that press go there god ever let press come now and you're not ready that makes no sense [Music] the reason goliath spent 40 days yet is because david didn't come yet galaga extension because david wasn't there yet them joker's there with all his sword all the spear all the shield and all the god of israel them jokers that one man was stepping forward that's why david said isn't there cause the church pindong israel pindong you're fighting with me don't fight with me i'm ready [Music] this is my thing i raise her for this thing william oh give the lord a shout who is that uncircumcised philistine defying the armies of the living god [Applause] maybe caesar listen again to this prophecy wait till them seven thunders alter their voices to that group not just any group the that group that can hand the word dear [Applause] [Applause] wrapped in humility wrapped in simplicity i forgive you and that bring the anointing know what something the people making love in the church right and the holy spirit dropped back on the prophet whatever you say what happened to them you said dead blind blind whatever you give my whole list and he chose none of the above even humanistic man taking all oil in them blind death this that that speak the world [Applause] what should i pick blank not dead [Music] maybe blind undead the prophet chose none of the above he said i forgive you you nobody did that you can do it there because he recognized he did mistakes he had his failures he had his shortcomings god's forgiven why can't he forgive them [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you see any time we get to the level of arrogance that nobody could correct us and talk to us and and and get away to us that is big problems because arrogant spirit is not of god god works and dwells in humility because your position you in right now god could just and take you out hallelujah so humble yourself under the mighty hand of god let him exalt you in due time you don't have to declare how great you are almighty or and powerful you are let your works declare your greatness [Music] hallelujah jesus a man approved by god and man and i find that's an interesting balance to be connected to god and man to find favor with god and man it means you're walking a balanced life you're not only mounting some way some bush and you have some rag around you on your feet i wonder if the world is very well i all them people involved with him in his skirt and a neighbor and i'll show you now i'm outside we're not talking about that god that is what is the

see his name when john saw his name he said carry on i'm i can't handle this i don't know about you you know i can't handle that and that's a terrible thing listen if you started getting this dynamite even see how much weapons have come up right now is [Applause] i was talking about those jews at well in wall you're always working so always working so we're always working so and somebody asked them why are we rocking so they say because what is it because they don't want god to think they're dead they want god to know their life so they keep working so when they're praying and they're praying and they're praying a rock and so because they don't want god to think they're dead when god looked down on the wall god know they're alive that's why i want you you have to be rocking glory to god rocking rocking in the spirit you have no time to be sleepy you have good time to be dead you have no time to be tired you're rocking in the spirit oh i was in the spirit of the lord's day oh glory to god something is happening something is moving [Music] glory them jews breaking the messiah and we already had luke 1730 messiah failed in his last day giving us the promise before the terrible day of the lord oh hallelujah and i'll be coming down to that time now almost every president of america face some kind of war some kind of war issue do you think this morning we'll face it too but this is a different season and that guy who on that throne right now or whatever people think about him he's the president and the devil controlling all and then blind evangelical people across there who believe he and jesus is next to each other [Music] and they think they feel jesus is a republican both sides bad you know there's two evils i don't know which one's the lesser but bo is both evil either one is evil but god set it up that way yeah and we are watching the drama unfold and that drama will unfold in trinidad and control in every country everything gonna move laws gonna be changed to enforce things do you know they're saying the tax law that jesus comes into position mary and mary and joseph was in one place you know but they changed laws to force jesus force jesus and mary to obey the law joseph i said i ain't going nobody if he let the governor end them no god sets it up because god has to get jesus in between him you have to be born there if the lawyer come here make a journal so the law itself forced the issue to get jesus in position [Applause] the shepherds already in position you know them watching their sheep they're no one happening yet they're just normal normal living watching sheep but angels going appear to them they tell them today in the city of david saver is born along the way wise men walking two years ahead their journey into identifying messiah god set everything up so for this third pull press come down thing god had to set everything up and before the press jesus was taken into willingness to overcome the lust of the eyes lust of the flesh pride of life private trial [Applause] i hear you all the priests are going through this and that pastor going through that and that minister going through that yours coming i didn't hear you i hear you don't watch somebody else try it you know your own coming every man on the earth [Music] [Applause] it's still coming give me more clothes if you figure you keeping your mouth closed they'll stop it from coming and still coming oh glory to god brother branham on came he lost his wife he lost his daughter he lost the anointing oh god have mercy but he was still a prophet it doesn't matter what your loss the lord give the lord take it away blessed be the remains of the lord your lord my lord your health you must lose your wealth you might lost this and lost that it doesn't matter god call you for his purpose hallelujah and that purpose must stand must must must what are you saying that over the purpose of god is ahead of your problem ahead of your situation let's continue oh my god hallelujah hallelujah [Music] almighty being who humbled himself unfolding himself and committed a body of flesh that any man could touch with his hands what is he doing claiming his role trying to get into man he went and offered his own blood when no other blood could do no wonder he was the priceless price of heaven no wonder he was king of kings he unfolded himself and come down and submitted himself on the cross and die and when he was standing there someone said i could call my father and he could send me ten legion of angels but my kingdom is not of this world and here the crowd saying away with him away with him why didn't he turn around and say away with you here's the reason he couldn't friends look at it them was his own children to think of a man's children crying for their daddy's blood if my children was running for my blood there's been nothing else i could see take me he if he refused to do it he lost his child his very creation his human beings and they was the one that was calling for his blood could you imagine the children calling for their father's blood that is the reason he couldn't say no if he said no they were lost i will die freely from my child for my children and any other father would look what he was his own children crying for his blood oh my and the blood of sheep couldn't do it blood of goats couldn't do it blood of cattle couldn't do it but the blood of god himself and the great thundering person among sinai was here in flesh then then he cleansed the way that he could come and live in your heart now that same spirit that funded from mount sinai is living in the human being what a marvelous that ought to set every heart jumping a man done a sin he committed adultery he stole or broke the sabbath commandment then he had to get a lamb he had to bring this lamb into the elders now there's a reason why i'm reading it right with me this may be a very long time but i want you to go with me there's a reason i'm reading this watch this so the man sin he commits adultery he's told he broke a sabbath then he had to get a lamb this is protestant he had to bring the llama to the elders they had to look this lamb over the lamb had to be blameless had to be without a flow on it look at the significance here the lamb had to be blameless for a blamed person [Applause] i remember the story i don't know whether i ever told it or not just a fiction story under the law if our old mother horse had a cold and it was a mule you know and his ears broke down his knees knocked what a cross i horrible looking mew that mew he could look at himself he said oh god oh my when a master come he will kill me because he couldn't feed me i'm not willing to live look at me what a horrible looking mess i am but if the mother could speak back to that little fellow she would say wait a minute honey you can live because you are my first and you have a birthright now when the master come out and sees you with all your condition he has got to go back and get a lamb without blemish on it and kill it so that up looking moon could live you see the priest never seen the mule he saw the lamb it wasn't whether the mule was perfect it had to be a perfect lamb i hope you see it it isn't whether you are good enough to be a christian or not it is whether he was good enough and if god accepted him and his blood makes an atonement god don't see you he sees the lamb that's the little mule could stick up his air tail in the air and snort and jump and run around over the field and have a good time he is going to live but one perfect had to die that was me william branham no good not fit to live worried to go to hell born in a sinful family raise a sinner no god at all but one day i accepted and when god looked upon christ christ took my place then god don't see me he sees the perfect one then as long as i'm in here in him i am perfected not in myself in him this is the part i want to get to not my perfection i don't have any but it is his perfection oh give the lord a shout oh glory to god is not your perfection it's his perfection oh glory to god hallelujah glory to god let's just cap it off here so paul said when the worshiper come and bring if he done wrong he come with a little lamb the priest checked the lamb and so on and here comes the man that was done wrong i have been stealing and i know now i'm subject to death because i did wrong god wouldn't want me to steal his commandments said not now i'm going to lay my hands upon the lamb and god commandment said here thou shalt not steal i stole i know i am somebody said that something got to answer for my sin because i stole and god said the day either of that day you die you steal you gotta die for it so he required if i didn't want to die i had to bring a lamb so i laid the lamb down here i put my hands a little fellow i said lord i'm sorry that i stole i confess and promise you i won't steal anymore but accept me now and god accept him because the lamb took that place oh isn't that right hallelujah so you see now we see that we do wrong and i have did wrong i have sinned i have lived wrong i've done wrong now i come to the altar by feet i see the sacrifice i lay my hands upon jesus head i said dear god i know i'm a sin and the wisdom is dead and you get talking and so on oh hallelujah oh glory to god the first man went under the law on the animals but couldn't change his heart because our animal life wouldn't compare with a human life our animal life is a living being but not a soul but god put a soul on man and what is the soul the nature of the spirit so the soul of jesus coming inside of you you release the holy ghost and your nature change and you are dying out and you are being born again by the spirit isn't that something else hallelujah and when he made one sacrifice for himself every sin every desire everything was taken from the man's heart and he stands perfected in the sight of god not by what he has done but what jesus done for him [Applause] this song is so simple right but many people still don't accept this they're still wallowing in the condemnation and you have to accept this oh glory to god you accept the blood speaking on your behalf and when god looked down he doesn't see you he sees your voice coming through the blood that blood is speaking i die for them i took their place see they said the guilty the guilt is a year but i pay the price that's why i win the calvary so you have to dismiss the case oh glory to god because they were to die but i stand in their stead you have to go free you have to go free [Applause] the message will not free it's too much of intellectual gymnastics when you're free you're free you're free to shout you're free to praise god you're free to fellowship with anybody they're not free they care first of this world they can't say this one hand they can't hug her brother they can't love somebody not in their own church that's freedom they're loving your own [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] the story of tima and the story of these other people not fit for work book consumption all the story did you write self righteous a real problem story jesus the catchy woman writing the act of adultery right in the act carrying on they have it on tape it's recorded i mean are they trying to challenge jesus on how to manage that issue moses and the law say a woman in this condition should be stoned he said no problem which one are you without sin that's the full stone that's all i argue in the morning i hate challenging moses i'm not debating with moses all i am saying story is if [Applause] if you have no sin lose the stone because some of them had stone in their hand you know if you saw them so supportive one scratcher said like if it was ouch i remember how to go and buy me i don't buy milk from a child excuse me i had to go to the grocery store anybody make excuses all right high priest last month he's treading his beard you don't know how to handle this thing now he said oh ho oh yes we have services evening jesus gave him a break by not looking at him he needs some writing joy and writing you get him he gave them some time to think it over to search their heart because the word already discerned them the word is as insane as he tossed and sent to the heart he know them as ratchet you know they're vile you know that character you know there's hypocrites you know what kind of nation is inside your heart but he's not telling them that he said which one you're coming for stone always tell you holy always earlier moses message long time over here and books and tape and president played good [Applause] oh you're pressing and playing everything all your listening tapes right through when you tell him so he said where are then accused this woman she didn't even know when they left case call are no witnesses you must dismiss that case case call no evidence just say why are you accusers because i call in case now yes case call i'll walk [Applause] the woman the woman i do well give him a run for the money when she set her free she's had said iran you know and you know the reason jesus could catch at that time because she's not going to have virgins and other nice people who who going to church regularly did go in a certain time so she going different timing from the she operated with them so she knew she went out to thailand she didn't expect me jesus but he come out to time into because he want to meet her this is his appointment because he's the book and she's a name and he has to connect with that name the book that within what she did the book wasn't looking what she was doing the book was looking to call her i'm not hearing you i am not hearing you this morning [Music] you have some righteous people inside of here but i thought we were all born and said some of you born version some of you must be divine i don't know but it ought to make everybody shout i have 40 of the people shouting you don't understand what freedom is [Applause] he conditioned he you know he can fix the painting the people having money when peter tell him walk and she said you better say he said jump on it suppose he comes you know i remember something no they have an internet a man was crippling him and a car was coming down crossing the road and when he got coming so he jumped on the run he was playing to get money when he seeker come and he didn't play crippled again and people started wanting running out to beat him because he playing there's a different kind of thing altogether then when you're playing and it exposes them because when you see the injured commander he can't play he'll play with his life a genuine man will get bombs done but that man he run then people run behind him because if i give him money they play in but that crippled man he's had to leap and run and jump why because he was free from his paralyzed condition all your shy condition you're shy you're never gonna break your yet you'll need to break out you're gonna have to free you from that oh glory to god how are you gonna put your foot on every place you put your foot is yours somebody said dorsey

hallelujah glory to god hallelujah so this prophetic vision of the end time that was loose by that malachi for prophet came in two parts one was the learning of his word as he said in the time of the revelation of these things being made known so we have been living under that time of the revelation of these things being made known but at some point it have to change to the manifestation of these things that was made known oh glory to god i say the time is at hand all glory to god the change on the mechanics of the dynamics the change from the revelation of these things we may have known all the mysteries being revealed these mystery truths being revealed into the manifestation because you cannot say seven thunders just did the the review mr truth because seven thunders is to become a manifestation seven thunders is in two parts revelation and manifestation i say the time is at hand for the manifestation of the seven thunders oh glory to god where sons are replacing their ranks oh god put the badge upon the sons make this one a general maybe this one a lieutenant make this one this holy and that soldier and put this stamp of a pool and loose them on the earth steve was a deacon busting the word ripping through oh hallelujah give the lord a shout all of them filled with the holy ghost all of them with the open vision i want the whole church to have this vision the whole church have a prophetic vision what the prophet revealed that you have to become you have to become a living word right let's continue oh hallelujah [Applause] what abram says seven seals seven spirits seven angels seven horns seven churches seven sevens oh about this he says he stood in the midst of the lamb i've been seen having seven heads seven eyes which which are the seven spirits of god same for the holy earth what is those seven spirits them seven messengers he interpreted that he converted seven spirit into seven messengers he said there is in columbus irenas john wesley martin and so forth the seven spirits which are seven men which are seven messages so you can't preach the men you have to preach the messages [Applause] these seven men don't come into you so when you're converted to seven spirits oh glory the zodiac not coming into you this book is not coming into you but this pyramid is oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah or give the lord a shout thrones lightnings seven lamps or seven stars called seven spirits meaning manifestations of the holy spirit of the seven church ages at the seven seats of mercy for the people here they are seven seas of mercy seven seats seven churches seven stars seven manifestation seven spirits seven lamps oh my oh god is perfect oh glory to god so what the prophet did the prophet come and bring us a big panoramic of this vision of the end time showing the jew that is supposed to be the six seals being unfolded judgment the white horse rider riding straight to hell oh glory to god but he saw a vision of the bride being called out he saw a vision of a bride come back and step he saw a vision of the bride just like the first one oh walking on what christian soul is matching on the wall he saw that bride and the one who had outer step the voice said get back in step what step the step of the word there's only seven steps to go get back in step fate virtue knowledge only stem cell perfection it's not 27 steps no it's not 27 mysteries there's only seven mysteries it's seven voices seven thunders seven voices seven steps oh glory to god are you with me hallelujah praise be to jesus hallelujah so what all this message to produce is supposed to bring back listen carefully the ministry of jesus christ not my ministry this is my ministry no no it's supposed to restore the ministry of jesus christ back among the people then you say at the finishing of the seventh seal we're supposed to be all the way up there and then we are worshiping the living christ him moving in and out among us who is that christ oh hallelujah priest do you believe that thank you no thank you lord hallelujah give him some praises glory to god hallelujah hallelujah thank you lord jesus glory god alone holds the key who do men say either son of man thou art the christ so god holds the key to revelation god alone who is that now there is no school no theologians no teachings of the bible among any school that knows anything about it they cannot know nothing about it is impossible for them to know about about it god has hid the senses of knowing it from the very elected teachers it's a personal individual fear with the person that christ is revealed to them so when somebody wants to manage you and bring it on to the umbrella like if you're gonna lose your salvation if you're gonna lose your life you're gonna die at church or whatever it is all of that is foolishness because this is not you and mary and god this is not you the pastor and god is you and god the pastor is dead to fulfill a role in a purpose but you are his sons and daughters and the faithful ministry is placed for your perfection to bring you into the channel that the spirit could flow freely oh glory to god because the spirit have to come into the body and flow out peter was in the body and it flowed out to the etobin eunuch it flowed out to cornelius house why people he had speak these words god shocked him he didn't expect that when he began to speak the word the holy ghost fell on cornelius and open up the door for the gentiles they serve the truth look the holy ghost that fell on us fell on them so god mixing up this thing god is stopping with us the jews alone it going on to the entire world no it's going the opposite god about to finish the gentiles that is where we have to get desperate because there is so much hole he goes in the bucket to access he call it he call it the last drop in the bucket when that access that's it you know book is closed captioning not [Music] he has revealed available me and the life that christ produced here in the bible that same life is in him doesn't produce itself you have got the wrong revelation i a man talk all kind of thing about the angel and and his ministry and this and that and so on overseas i i hear everybody claiming some kind of thing but the life is something completely different and that's what seeing if the angel come and say something and the life is not there what do you want with the angel change the angel dismiss that angel say i don't want you because you have to produce a life i don't want to angel with me because i give and i'm a slacker and there's no life with it and i came in some manifestation i don't want no manifestation like that i want that i don't need to see a sign you know i just want this i want this thing living in me i want to know my wife could see it feel it i want a maturing to see it let me drop this bomb on you he said the ministry has reached perfection when christ is reproduced in the natural that is not talking christ that is not preaching a message that is reproducing the same life that jesus had oozing out your flesh [Music] [Applause] no proton if people bounce you they get it [Music] you're sticky with honey you're sticky with love oh glory the bees could understand that the bees know the language you're talking they're talking unknown language [Applause] you hear that the

the house of hell god going to rock trinidad oh give the lord a shout the bride's gonna be the shaker listen is either your part of the shaker or part of the shaking oh give the lord a shout this world will get rocked with the bride hallelujah praise god thank you lord you may be seated my lord if you say reveal to me and the life that christ produces you in the bible that same life is in him does not produce itself in you you've got the wrong revelation if the life of jesus ever put forth another body of believers it would be the fruit the first one did they will write a book of acts behind it and no man was in charge of the book of acts no apostle no super pope no message pope no anointed a part no no no no judge the spirit of the lord let philip here peter went dear paul when dear they were led by the spirit that is the book of acts it wasn't the acts of man it was the acts of the holy ghost oh glory to god and god are about to anoint you because we have some acts to do oh glory to god satan he went in god's eden and he before my act and throw down god's bride in ghanaian but god said this bride will not be like eve so god wait for satan to form his eden have his all his people have all his forces his political forces his demon forces his religious forces and he's going to anoint her bride only the god with the white the white horse rider the holy ghost itself the bride will become the incarnate word or give the lord a show no wonder the bible said and the spirit [Music] glory that is that luther that's not wesley talking about that's the pentecost that is d spirit that's all rainbow the whole rainbow that's the glory oh give the lord a shout are you saying that glory will be upon the bride yes yes yes that's the capstone glory going to come upon your life you'll be rubed with the canopy of life you'll be taken into the tent of his love [Applause] this banner over me is love you will write the book of must be on your season cause it's the same life see what i mean you just can't get away from it it's the life of christ in you being injected in you by the holy spirit itself living its life through you he said god here we go is known by simplicity and the revelation of jesus christ to the most illiterate person so the person who can't read and write in here or anybody they could get a revelation of jesus christ and god can make himself known to that person the most illiterate person therefore you don't need education to get revelation [Applause] you don't have to be educated to get revelation here we go see not your theology it's a revelation of jesus christ upon this rock i'll be in my church no other rocks accepted no nothing's accepted not a roman rock nor the protestant rock nor that school no nothing but on exactly the revelation of jesus christ through the new birth he bonds in there and he injects his own life and your life is gone and the life of christ is project itself through you with preeminences that means yourself is disappearing the life of christ projecting through you so it wouldn't be okay i know me right i am to you i know me i know my nature and something like that but when christ begins to take over i would see less of me and more of him because you will know you and when you begin to behave in a behavior that is unlike you you know it's him [Applause] come on come on come on now come on now [Music] [Applause] you are you but when his life began to be projected through you you will find yourself operating on a higher level not the humanistic realm but the realm of revelation breaking it division because that's the three steps is that any humanistic okay the humanistic realm is making fight for the pastor in fact we see we see that for extremists for me and like shooting now they want to get one person you know but i don't do that i'll meet him by yourself and shoot your poo one shot one shoot you will know is who i'm talking to i don't need to take pulpit time to blast one person with an issue no i will tell you and you will know it's you i'm talking to you you can have time i see pastors preaching and blasts in the water and you personally trying to get you looking wrong soon one time my sister owen simon amen before the statement even finished he said amen amen amen amen and he passed a blast in that email but she wants people to aim into that too she still knows she is easy she's taught me he said watch god's revelation unfolding by lack of this revelation is why we have so much divisions among us so much mockery so much division is because the people lack that revelation they lack that revelation the teachers he is saying teachers lack the revelation of jesus christ then what are they really teaching is intellect all right i think i'll try to wrap up here listen i can walk two more always i feel sorry like a rock i feel like strong like a ox i feel like i know started here right now there's not even a second when i step in the first round let me see where i'm at let's see what page i'm at here i have 22 pages and i think i've now reached page 15. yes after you two pages i know you should be 15. it's about papa and he trained right now all right so this is uh pick up the pen and write the lord spoke to him i was seeking the lord and the holy spirit told me to pick up my pen and write i grasped the pen to write his spirit gave me a message for the church and i want to bring it to you it has to do with the word and the bride now i know this is things we heard before but i want to hear it again i feel it's a special season and time and i feel it's applicable to the time and season we're in that is why i'm bringing it to you this is what the prophet this is what god spoke here is what i'm trying to say to you the law of reproduction is that each specie would bring forth after its unkind even according to genesis 1 11 and god said that it would bring forth grass to help even see the fruit tree and fruit after his kind whose season itself upon the earth it was so whatever life was in the seeds came forth into a plant dancing to the fruit that is a process the very law applies to the church today whatever seed started the church will comfort and be like the original seed because it is the same seed in these last days here we go the true bright church christ's seed will come to the head soon number one hallelujah will come to where the headstone the bright church will come to the headstone then he said in citizenship does the uh does the uh um the thunders cap the pyramid so the thomas is the headstone yes the thundus is the capstone revelation of jesus christ in two parts mechanics and dynamics so people fight up with mechanics these years not even understanding them mechanics was only making way for dynamics because he said my word is spirit and life it's not just learning of the word is power being manifested so your promise is not just a word promise your promises have to be a living promise a manifested promise when god gave abraham the word of isaiah that word for 25 years but then isaac had to come to vindicate the word that god came 25 years ago god not lying to us if god said in the last day we'll be a super church there's no no lie super race another life as we near the headstone that means every message should be pushing us towards the headstone [Music] which is the love because the love is the strength of the entire body [Applause] so as they climb up higher getting more stronger and stronger we're getting the strength let's continue watch the true bright church christ seed will come to the headstone and she will be this is prophecy she did not church members this is not natural church this is the bride she will be the super church a super race as she nears him day in the bride will be so much like him that they will be in his very image number one very image before power image i'm not hearing you before adam had power what did god say let us make man in our image and likeness then let him have dominion so to come back to power you have to come back to image to come back to power you have to come back to the pyramid to come back to power you have to come out to them virtues [Applause] i'm not having you hallelujah she the bride will be in his very image so he is prophesying that you will have the token he is prophesying you will have all m7 virtues he is prophesied you will have the life of jesus christ he is prophesying he will come to perfection oh give the lord a shout you can't sit here under that prophecy without giving god some worship [Music] [Applause] why this image why let the spirit that turned people attendants right explain why the bride have to be in his very image the next statement identifies why this is in order to be united with him they will be won that is why the holy ghost can never come down and dry they were praising and blessing god continually so they had an atmosphere to prepare themselves for the atmosphere so if there is no worship nothing is coming i have no revival coming that church is a tribulation church every dead church is tribulation church [Music] image purpose of image to be one with him what is he fight for ministry for for the perfecting his sins work of the ministry eddie find anybody till we all come into the unit of faith not as a son of god unto the measure of the stature of a perfect man so we're not till we come and join church i'm trying a nice church my man said in a pew long time no no come to the measure of the stature of a perfect man and that stature is why people ask about iran but how come you believe what you believe in could go among them them nut cases them crazy doctrines them bad behaved people how come you could just go among all of them he said faith virtue to let the word god with kindness knowledge to know what the brother believes and know it in his heart temperance with him patience with him hoping someday his eyes pop open [Applause] but i'm gonna say i ain't going among them people and and i will be like you know don't talk to this one don't go by this one don't preach by this one what kind of crazy thing is that and somebody said i want a shock this one is shock this one finish they finish you don't you know a long time you finish [Music] we refuse it don't be dead already we died in christ you gotta say you tackle jesus again your calculated dead man a dead man done that already she has died and rose again she is then can kill himself come totally confused when satan see brother brahm says when he comes to upper room they were staggering and they tell them demonstrated look they carried a that's exciting leave them alone when peter said peter peter said this is that the devil moved peter said this is that the publisher speak of peace look look at the code here preacher prison codes jewel court the devil said either we're going to take our next hour snap they were sleeping extra time extra time in extra time mode when peter raised that man from the com from the gateway beautiful and i decided to walk and jump and they tell satan said yeah yeah what happened a man raised him he was crippled if you see that the whole country talking about it it make front page then people raise any business any manifestation business they're not easy they say what this is serious [Applause] emergency meeting to discuss this it's jesus again we can't let this happen we can't let this loose beat them let the lord come upon him and put the licks man they lick good licks you know and them this wasn't them small but we have wrong ways you know it was them built to be getting looks and go back home but it's not them kind of licks it's serious licks when their fellas get licks the wednesday service that was backed out people wasn't missing that service next service the people for the lord gave us strength to go backwards if no one anointed you beat me for this thing you want to fight me on this thing well i'll give you a run for your money i'll fight you right back i asking god for power in this hour to be true to stand to withstand to stand anyhow to having don't understand to stand or give the lord a shout out glory hallelujah hey please [Music] are you ready ready for them but let them come up holy come on oh glory to god come up there ain't feeling good that's all right if you feel like to come and come i feel i feel strong this morning hallelujah satan know when talk is talk but satan know when you walk they talk that's different thing all together oh give the lord our show satan know when talk is stuck but when we walk the talk that's a different thing altogether [Applause] hallelujah may be ceased and nice when then fell as one power without character and they come the cast of some devil in him or jesus that paul preached that he's the faith god ever in the name of jesus poor preacher they're feeling that kind of business dealer i'll give the heck paul business card this thing will work them demonstrate the talk is it paul i know peter i know i know them guys everybody kicked me out up there them guys them i get blows from them fellas already who are you you have no power you doing my faith you talking about paul's faith the faith that paul preached you have no revelation at all they jump on them yes you can't do that it has to be defeated restored the faith manifested the faith confirmed oh glory to god because that's the promise to turn our ass back to the feet of the fathers oh glory to god i could say so much things this is an ordinary with him there will be one yetis prophecy they the bride will be the very manifestation of the word of the living god denominations cannot produce this he's a wrong seed they reproduce their craze and dogmas mixed with the word this mongolizing brings a hybrid product the first other adam was a spoken seed word of god he was given the bride to reproduce himself that is why the bride was given to him to reproduce himself to produce another son but she fell by hybridization she caused him to die the second son jesus also a spoken seed word of god was given a bride like adam but before he could marry her she also fallen she like adam's wife was put to the test whether she would believe the word of god and live and dull the word and die she doubted she left the world and died but here we go from a little group of the true seed of the word that's the first part it has all seed but it's the true seed so from the true seed have a little group coming out god represents christ with a beloved bride she's a version of his word she is a virgin because she knows no man made christian dogmas by and through the members of the bride will be fulfilled all that was promised to be made manifest by the virgin the word i promise came to the virgin mary but the word of promise was he himself think about that now the word was he he's not saying the word is doctrine the word of promise was he himself to remain manifest so it's more than just word word changing the he so the mystery comes known as the word and the word changed to him ah who is him as many as receive him to them give he power he and the word is the same in the beginning was the word the word become him by the word becoming flesh that's him but for him to come into you and come by the word the world coming to you that's the secret and then the word turned to spirit power in you [Applause] [Music] it come like right under the devil's nose god slipped the word inside of you in silence and the devil is messed up because he cannot see the treasure hidden in earthen vessels oh could we give the lord a shout out [Music] remember season so as far as satan come back again as if there will be because he's not sure he don't know who you are so he don't know who we are you think we're playing with words and playing with game and and things like that a bunch of people on the internet and they ram this and random that and i said as foolishness and whatnot fighting the prophet half of them was even wrong they wasn't born there they know nothing about no experience they're only saying what other people say and they're fighting they have to do it they are non-seeds so they can be quickened this message is not for them this message is for his brain let me continue quickly watch the word of promise was he himself to be manifest god was being manifest he himself acted at that time and fulfill his own word of promise to the virgin it was an angel that brought her the message but the angel's message was the word of god and he fulfilled it at a time the members of the bride will love him they will have his potentials for he is their head not the man in england that's a man in these states not some man in africa or south america or trinidad i don't know where he is the head hallelujah and all paul belongs to him they are subject to him as the members of our bodies are subject to our heads [Applause] so all wife could be a bullhead not subject to your husband and be right in that sense you're not subject yourself to the ministry that's why some people will jump from church to church they don't want to be under no subjection they want to be under no authority and to have authority you must be under authority god placed me here with authority but is only if you allow that authority to be over you authority that ministerial authority and govern people lies and run people lives we don't have that doctrine here we do have that teaching here i like freedom i love freedom i want you to be free and i must be free you could be free but i have to be free to tell you the truth you can be free and buy me is that working so it's not working so i have to be careful and walk on excels because i want to offend this one and offend that one it's not so you know this is friend or no friend you know i love god god first this message is first a lot of people fight with it wrestle with it because again i fight because cutting their behavior and their spirit and their attitude and they don't want to die some people love how they are that's why they are changing [Applause] are you here whether you say abel are not coming through you know are coming through you know where do you say amen i don't need amen for that no some people are changing because they don't they don't want to change they love themselves they satisfy with themselves they're not hungry they're not thirsty they're not looking for a transformation they just come into church because it's a religious atmosphere that they're living in is a religious spirit upon them [Music] their amends means nothing to god they're worshiping nothing to god they're not sincere [Applause] jacob was sincere who are you i'm jacob i'm a scholar man i'm a con mum i'm a republican god loved that group of artists god loved that con man i can't hear you it's not because man any problem is the sincerity is the problem because when jacob come on the brass to make the decision here playing with that birthright the time is at hand for me to get that birthright eight hours to make soup i'm gonna make super lemony brothers pay for that buddy boat right by taking it and jake god said jacob i love yours so don't let them brothers fool you um [Applause] don't get messed up for david on solomon and jeff tyler all these brothers when god ripped when god write down the story god put them negative things out around them so you know god said what more shall i say for time will fail to tell me about ah [Applause] you know how much them brothers will be saying by you i'm so glad i passed this i ain't nothing that is with you in a minute daniel will be thanking god he was in his age yes but he said you see one of another face you you understand the lid of hell has been uncovered you understand hell on the earth that my god lose seven angels to bring heaven down because hell come from below you realize all them spirits making all the kind of cloth and material and stars and and all them kind of thing is on the earth as hell you know every day you walk into hell but you see but it gets normalized now i'll come like a normal place let me finish oh anthony telling me something going to start with i'm trying to get over here you know because this thing i kind of locked it inside of here you know and if i go down we'll go down straight to community not communicable we'll go straight down i know you're right with me i feel the thing i i feel it with me i feel you're going with me notice the harmony with your father and son jesus never did anything until the father stood in for sin john 5 19. this harmony is known to exist between the groom and his bride same one syndrome 519 is to exist between groom and bride watch this part watch he shows her his word of life she receives it she never doubts it [Music] super church do people see him i just recently never doubted it she never doubts it there's nothing can hammer that's a promise nothing how many taking that today how many taking that prophecy today nothing no demon could keep your body down no not devil no demon no no trial no test nothing nothing means nothing [Applause] [Music] paul went to prison and deliver the jailer when satan thought he locked a paul and women position and gain paul pressure here no god pulled all over satan i and send paul in prison to deliver the jailer that's the only way you get yellow what a mighty god reason oh glory do you think god god is wise he wanna never delivered he's enjoying the neighborhood do not do not bust it do not take his his cruise and say he go down and see see sun and shine you're going on the caribbean in the cruise right now and god decided to make jonah understand that you could run bekaede [Music] when they both had a rock rock rock they say oh god like we sinned we said that's here yes it is me it's a it's a powerful thing when somebody recognizes them [Applause] human beings always blaming somebody she is he is them is this everybody else but themselves i remember one time preaching when the presence of god came down isaiah said woe is them. when that person said isaiah as i said woe is me no man could commit a real presence and be arrogant and be indifferent and blame others you're coming to presence who is me oh god you see your own self you can't see people else you know you're not like the marco and makan civil business yes down to the ground you want to hear you wanna hear what's going on man whoever buy players a long time buying people they want to read the latest news only grown he is but when you come into presence it's different you see i'm undone i am unworthy if god grace didn't keep me i'm gone it's not by your might it's not by your power it's by your spirit all right she never doubts it therefore nothing can harm and not even debt for if the seed be planted the water raises up here is the secret the word is in the bride [Music] is the word in you it doesn't manifest yet but the word in you is it come forward yet but the word in you it amidst all your struggle the word in you but over it you don't know why you're going through yes i know but listen to this you couldn't come except the father called you and if you didn't have never jump inside of you the father didn't couldn't come call you at all it's only because you are seed you could be reborn [Applause] so your calling is not based upon your present state or your future state [Music] your core is based upon the state god was in when he was thinking about you in the back part of his mind and when he think about you he was finished when he put your name on the book so you could go through hell you're still coming through that my david is able to make my bed they're in hell he is there david knew he was a son david knew that either the question [Applause] how do i get out of here i've got to get out of here david said restore unto me the joy of my salvation i know i say it but i lost my joy give me back give me back give me back give me back give me that give me back i won back my joy [Music] [Applause] it's one of the greatest things to be a happy christian a joyful christian oh god you have a smile on your face when you slam that door open the devil says oh god run move he come and he come and come in that man pray he come under the atmosphere the joy of the lord is your strength oh hallelujah get back that joy get back there lord return return me to that place that passion to know the word that cry to get in the spirit that servant is out to please god ask god back for it don't let the devil tap you up slap you up dry up fight tell somebody next to your fight fight [Applause] you know what turn around and tell somebody fight back just tell them i think that better fight back fight back just fight back turn around go get get off your seat don't be afraid tell somebody encourage somebody tell them fight back [Applause] [Applause] foreign [Applause] all right the militant gave me the key when we missed it i like them guys and them guys say time to sign off here come on just punch me i love them anyhow those in the bride will only do his will no one can make them do otherwise they have just hear the lord not a lion spirit not saying god saying god they tell you the bride don't have that lying on god they don't have that the pride of just say the lord will keep still that means whatever you say has to come to pass oh let's turn and give the lord a show they know that it has to be god in them doing the works fulfilling his own word he did not complete all his work while is in earthly ministry so now he works in and through the bride i am finished for today god bless you [Applause] [Music] oh glory glory glory glory man oh can hold my party town oh your party town oh come
