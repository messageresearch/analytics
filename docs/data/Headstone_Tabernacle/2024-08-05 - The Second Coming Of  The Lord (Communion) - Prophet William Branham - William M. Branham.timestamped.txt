[5:26] may be seated I just come here to
[5:28] introduce the tape this
[5:30] evening the tape is the message called
[5:33] the second com of the Lord 43 years ago
[5:36] 1981 while up in kwall up in a house
[5:41] that we used to have service in we had a
[5:43] prayer meeting just about five of four
[5:45] six of us and a vision
[5:47] broke I saw this vision and the sheet
[5:50] dropped down and I saw this message the
[5:53] second coming of the Lord and at that
[5:55] time we hadly have of books and stuff we
[5:58] don't know all what the m mes was all
[6:00] coming to Trinidad and so like that I
[6:01] wanted to know if but Bram preached a
[6:04] message second come of the Lord and I
[6:06] discovered that he did and I went into
[6:09] that message and when it reached the
[6:12] spot where it say when the church finds
[6:14] his brotherly love when the church finds
[6:16] hold decency when the church finds his
[6:18] place in Christ it will call to the
[6:20] other members of the body come and
[6:21] rejoice with us to cut a long story
[6:23] short December the 31st that
[6:25] Independence Day weekend 43 years ago
[6:28] this August here
[6:30] God brought a revelation of Brotherly
[6:31] kindness to us in kW to me and that was
[6:36] the key to if you see what brotherly
[6:39] kindness is just above that you would
[6:42] see the Holy Spirit slot so brotherly
[6:45] kindness is the key to access this
[6:49] called the holy spirit so realize that
[6:52] faith is based upon forgiveness and to
[6:53] access God's presence with Faith by
[6:56] faith you have to come through blly love
[6:58] so this is a key key message in our
[7:01] ministry in my life it was a key moment
[7:03] in my life through this message I saw
[7:06] brother Michael mcmo I got introduced be
[7:09] introduced to B Heman in 1981 that's how
[7:11] we met we met by Revelation I went with
[7:15] Revelation up there and so on and that
[7:17] was a door that was open so I pray and
[7:19] trust that God bless you today as we go
[7:21] straight into deep right now but a shame
[7:23] praise the Lord the second come of the
[7:25] Lord and it will tie to this morning's
[7:27] message praise the Lord
[7:42] heavenly father as we come to thee
[7:46] tonight in that lovely name of the Lord
[7:51] Jesus we are so happy as we approach
[7:54] these holy days knowing that this
[7:58] represents
[8:01] the greatest time on Earth is when that
[8:06] all sufficient sacrifice was made that
[8:10] poor lost Sinners might be made free and
[8:15] have this great hope that we have within
[8:17] our bosoms tonight that someday he will
[8:21] come
[8:23] again and tonight as approaching this
[8:27] Pulpit coming through the door and
[8:30] hearing this old
[8:33] song We'll have a grand
[8:36] homecoming
[8:38] week the first 10,000 years brings back
[8:43] memories of many years ago when we met
[8:48] here in the
[8:49] Tabernacle before the great worldwide
[8:53] Revival
[8:54] started and father God we just cherish
[8:58] those thoughts
[9:01] and seemingly good in our soul that we
[9:04] return again tonight to begin another
[9:08] one of those oldfashioned
[9:11] revivals where Sinners call out for
[9:15] mercy and more the
[9:18] backslider makes things right with God
[9:23] again and the Holy Spirit is the main
[9:27] person in the meeting who takes hope and
[9:30] rules and brings to us the bread of life
[9:33] through the word and we pray that he'll
[9:37] minister to us night after night in this
[9:41] revival heal the sick and the
[9:45] needy sanctify every
[9:47] believer and get Glory out of these
[9:50] efforts that we put forth for Father God
[9:54] it's only to the honor and Glory of his
[9:58] name that we asked it
[10:02] [Music]
[10:06] amen this is to fulfill a promise that I
[10:10] made 11 years ago long time getting
[10:14] around to it but to return back to the
[10:17] Tabernacle for
[10:19] Revival and now we know that our little
[10:23] Tabernacle is insufficient in room for a
[10:27] Revival but we'll just Jam in here and
[10:31] the best we can for the next few nights
[10:34] for the glory of God and uh I love to
[10:40] have a meeting in the church many places
[10:44] we have them in stadiums and out in the
[10:48] outdoors in the Arenas but there's
[10:51] something different when you have it in
[10:53] the church there seems to be that it's a
[10:56] sweeter closer Fellowship when you're in
[10:59] the church out in those Arenas worldly
[11:03] places we are grateful for the privilege
[11:06] of being out there but it seems like
[11:09] that you find uh an oppression like a
[11:13] demon power that you have to break
[11:15] through before the Revival ever starts
[11:18] and then when you come into the church
[11:21] it's the place where God dwell it's
[11:25] coming to his house to haveen need and
[11:28] now we're glad tonight to see many of
[11:31] the old faces that I saw years ago in
[11:35] the ending up of my ministry here at the
[11:38] Tabernacle see brother Grim in brother
[11:41] Curtis and sister Angie and sister
[11:45] Gertie here brother Cox and sister Cox
[11:48] and oh my so many of you sister Spencer
[11:51] and brother Spencer and all of you in
[11:54] here we're so happy Mama Miss Slaughter
[11:57] and brother over here just great groups
[12:00] of these still how many's in here from
[12:02] the time we started back I mean when I
[12:05] left in the Revival to go out let's see
[12:07] your hands all over the church tonight
[12:09] just look at the hands that's very
[12:13] fine now we are know that revivals only
[12:18] come by the Holy Spirit he's the one who
[12:23] brings
[12:24] Revival and we can't do it ourself we
[12:28] can only make make that effort and God
[12:31] has to bless that effort and we trust
[12:34] that he will now in the Blessed
[12:39] word I wish to read just a a verse or a
[12:43] line or two out of St Luke's gospel and
[12:48] the 15th chapter the 8th verse either
[12:52] walk woman having 10 pieces of silver if
[12:57] she shall lose one piece does not light
[13:02] a candle and sweep the house and seek
[13:05] diligently until she has found it and
[13:09] when she has found
[13:11] it she calleth her friends and her
[13:14] neighbors together saying Rejoice with
[13:18] me for I have found the peace which I
[13:22] have
[13:24] lost now that may seem like a very OD
[13:29] God scripture for the second coming of
[13:33] Christ and but it's speaking of the
[13:38] second coming of Christ and this great
[13:42] subject that we have here before us now
[13:46] is one of the most vital subjects in the
[13:51] entire holy
[13:53] RI there's nothing so important as the
[13:58] coming of the Lord
[14:01] Jesus for if he does not come we have
[14:06] been found false
[14:08] Witnesses are dead that's in the grave
[14:12] are
[14:13] perished and there is no hope left for
[14:17] us if Jesus doesn't come visibly the
[14:21] second
[14:22] time and in the very this
[14:27] light in the very light of the second
[14:30] coming was so
[14:33] important that this Holy Week that we
[14:36] are now
[14:38] approaching that Jesus when he was
[14:41] approaching it at the first time in the
[14:44] very Shadows of the Cross he spoke very
[14:48] little of his death burial and
[14:53] Resurrection he spoke more on his second
[14:57] coming than he did on his death burial
[15:01] and
[15:02] Resurrection so in the light of this it
[15:05] must be a very important
[15:09] subject in the Old Testament there is
[15:14] many times more scriptures in the Old
[15:17] Testament pertaining to the second
[15:20] coming of Christ than there was to the
[15:24] first coming of
[15:26] Christ everything to the human race now
[15:31] after the atonement has been made rest
[15:35] solemnly upon the second coming of the
[15:40] Lord now we have different
[15:43] religions and we have different uh uh
[15:46] bodies and different
[15:49] theologies but our Christian religion is
[15:53] based solemnly upon death burial and
[15:57] Resurrection and the second coming of
[16:01] the
[16:02] Lord oh it's an important
[16:05] question and as we are now approaching
[16:10] to
[16:11] my most sincere thoughts we are living
[16:16] in the very Shadows of his second
[16:21] coming are there to my way of seeing By
[16:26] the Light of the scripture
[16:29] there is not one hope left for the
[16:33] church outside the second coming of the
[16:38] Lord the world in its wild panamon
[16:43] condition has got completely out of
[16:47] control of every
[16:51] manmade organization in the
[16:55] world Kings cannot hold their subjects
[16:59] no more neither can dictators hold their
[17:04] subjects
[17:05] anymore democracy cannot hold its
[17:08] subject
[17:10] anymore and there is no hope left but
[17:14] the second coming of the Lord
[17:18] Jesus and it's now one of the
[17:23] most uh horrible
[17:26] time for the unb believe and
[17:30] sinner that he is ever witnessed because
[17:34] the Doom time is close at
[17:37] hand and it's the most blessed time for
[17:40] the believer for his Redemption is at
[17:47] handise there's two factions in the
[17:49] Earth tonight the believer and
[17:52] unbeliever the one the Lord is coming to
[17:56] receive and the one the Lord is coming
[17:58] to
[18:00] condemn at his coming will bless one and
[18:04] will curse the other at his
[18:08] appearing and being that this is such a
[18:11] vital thing I think just before at the
[18:15] Eve brother of our little Revival that
[18:19] we should look solemnly and into the
[18:22] scriptures and see how close that we are
[18:27] if I wanted to know what time it was I
[18:29] would look at my watch if I wanted to
[18:32] know what day of the week we was living
[18:34] in or the month of the year I would look
[18:37] at the calendar and if I want to know
[18:41] the approaching time of this great event
[18:45] I look at the word of God it tells the
[18:50] time when it is at
[18:53] hand for the Bible said when these
[18:55] things begin to come to pass lift up
[18:58] your head your Redemption is drawing n
[19:02] the time is at
[19:05] hand it was such a great thing to John
[19:10] the Revelator on the aisle of
[19:13] patmas that when he saw the preview of
[19:17] the coming of the
[19:19] Lord when he saw the curses that rested
[19:24] upon the
[19:26] unbeliever and the blessings that rest
[19:29] upon the
[19:31] believer he screamed out even so come
[19:35] Lord Jesus
[19:38] amen it so thrilled his heart after all
[19:43] he had seen the events before his coming
[19:46] he screamed even so come Lord Jesus
[19:52] amen and when the whole church age had
[19:56] been passed in his you and he seen
[20:01] everything and major the way it would
[20:04] happen then the scream come Lord Jesus
[20:07] it must be a glorious
[20:10] thing that the coming of the Lord draws
[20:14] near at
[20:16] hand Jesus when his disciples had got to
[20:19] a place that they were looking at the
[20:23] carnal or the Natural Things of the
[20:27] earth now here we want to stop just a
[20:30] few
[20:31] minutes it doesn't have to always be
[20:35] carnal that will draw us away sometimes
[20:39] just the natural things will draw us
[20:43] away Jesus servants or his disciples was
[20:48] pointing to him the City Temple
[20:53] Jerusalem the Great temple word the god
[20:57] in his kind of Glory had appeared in the
[21:01] holiest of
[21:03] holies and when they told him of how
[21:08] goodly the stones was placed
[21:11] in how the Great Master Mind Of God had
[21:17] ordained these Stones was cut in many
[21:21] places in the world and come together
[21:25] and in 40 Years of its erecting there
[21:28] was wasn't even to a buzz of a saw or
[21:32] the sound of a
[21:33] hammer it was so masterly put
[21:39] together and it how God had come in over
[21:42] the chair and and it showed forth his
[21:45] shakina glory and how they had great
[21:49] hope in this great church and Jesus told
[21:54] them see not all these things
[21:59] yet it was a holy place it was a good
[22:03] place it was a place House of the
[22:06] dwelling of the Lord but Jesus said
[22:09] don't see these
[22:12] things I've got something to tell you
[22:15] that's far greater than this Lord for
[22:20] there's coming a time he said that there
[22:23] will not be one stone left up on the
[22:27] other
[22:28] no matter how well we try to take care
[22:33] of our physical being no matter how hard
[22:37] we work for our
[22:39] organization how hard we work in the
[22:42] church for our our orders of the church
[22:47] there's coming a time when all those
[22:50] things will vanish and pass
[22:53] away Jesus begin to tell them that and
[22:57] they said what will be the sign of the
[23:01] coming of the end of the
[23:03] world and Jesus begin to speak to them
[23:07] the time will come when there will not
[23:09] be Stone left upon the others you shall
[23:13] hear of wars and rumors of
[23:16] wars pestilence earthquakes in diverse
[23:21] places and the other day over in
[23:25] California up in Oakland when it was our
[23:29] privilege to be there in a meeting and
[23:32] it was the first time that my wife had
[23:36] ever been in an
[23:38] earthquake I was sitting in the barber
[23:40] shop and I the room shook just a little
[23:46] and the radio quickly announced our
[23:49] earthquake was on said they're looking
[23:52] for another in about 8
[23:55] minutes and I felt oh what if this is
[24:00] the last
[24:02] one I hurried from the barber shop met
[24:06] my wife who was waiting on the street
[24:09] walked into a little drug store to get
[24:12] some little picture cards to send back
[24:14] to our loved ones and while we were
[24:18] there one of the most
[24:21] mysterious funny feelings that man could
[24:25] ever feel the whole Earth earth begin to
[24:30] rock the bottles begin to fall from the
[24:34] Shelf the flu begin to fall off the
[24:38] building and into the street overrun the
[24:43] people screaming and crying as the
[24:46] plaster fell from the walls and the big
[24:50] buildings with 30 and 40 stories Rock
[24:54] together until the smoke or dust from
[24:57] the Marty went up like great
[25:00] mushrooms and people begin to scream and
[25:04] run I said that is the finger of
[25:08] almighty God saying the handwritings on
[25:12] the
[25:14] wall Jesus said when you hear of
[25:17] earthquakes in diverse
[25:19] places the Earth split open down a
[25:23] highway for a long ways about 5T and
[25:28] went way down hundreds of feet in the
[25:30] earth one place the entire Highway
[25:33] dropped
[25:34] in and I thought as that split open I
[25:40] could just almost see the finger of
[25:43] almighty God saying and there shall be
[25:46] earthquakes in diverse
[25:49] places while the day was going on eight
[25:53] different earthquakes rocked that City
[25:56] and beard J open and drunk swarmed into
[26:00] the streets and women walked the streets
[26:04] half dressed and everything as if
[26:07] nothing had ever
[26:09] happened people are so Earthbound today
[26:13] to I don't know what it will take to
[26:17] shape this
[26:19] country they just seem to be so
[26:24] unconcerned they don't notice
[26:28] and one man even made a remark as I
[26:31] heard him with my own eye said did you
[26:34] see what I did I shook my fist I am the
[26:40] Superman and I thought such
[26:45] blasing I never thought so much of that
[26:48] as Blas me as I did right here in our
[26:51] own city as I was going out the highway
[26:55] last evening to
[26:57] Georgetown as you cross the sections out
[27:00] here just before you hit the new highway
[27:03] coming forth there was a great sign
[27:08] sticking up there and it said he is
[27:13] risen has life and the very next sign
[27:18] then to alone said where there is but
[27:21] wiser beer there is life I thought
[27:29] that's all there is to it and the Bible
[27:33] said that before the second coming of
[27:36] Christ that men should be
[27:40] blasphemers walking in their own ungodly
[27:43] lust truce Breakers and false
[27:48] accusers how the world has become in
[27:51] such a
[27:54] delusion in Bombay India recently when
[27:58] Billy my boy and I were there in a great
[28:04] meeting where T of thousands of Hindus
[28:09] gave their life to
[28:11] Christ there come a great
[28:15] warning now I want you to watch the
[28:18] intelligence of
[28:22] Nature and all of a sudden for some
[28:26] unknown reason all the little birds in
[28:30] the city begin to leave for the
[28:35] country and Birds by swarm left for the
[28:41] country and they begin to notice all the
[28:44] cattle and the sheep and the ox but in
[28:49] India their fences is not like I they're
[28:53] not wooden fences they're great Rock
[28:55] fences that's built high
[28:59] and all the cattle begin to get away
[29:01] from the
[29:02] walls and get away from the buildings
[29:06] and go way out in the middle of the
[29:08] field and begin to Mill around out in
[29:12] the middle of the
[29:14] field then all of a sudden the Great
[29:17] Earthquake
[29:19] struck and shut down the
[29:23] Walls trees
[29:26] Rock Miss
[29:29] flew and the birds never returned and
[29:33] the cattle stayed out in the
[29:36] field and man went right along thinking
[29:39] it was all right and the next day
[29:42] another earth quake rocked and more
[29:46] buildings turned over and the missiles
[29:51] flew and on the third day the cattle
[29:55] went back to the walls and the bir words
[29:58] return to the city amen oh he who feeds
[30:03] the
[30:04] sparrow he that brought his little
[30:07] creatures into the ark still lives and
[30:12] Reigns and they seem to have more
[30:15] intelligence about God than man does who
[30:19] he created in
[30:23] his when man
[30:25] blessing the little creatures of the
[30:27] Earth Earth God provides for them and
[30:30] they made their way away from the big
[30:32] walls that have been killed the birds
[30:35] would have been mased in the cracks of
[30:37] the rock as it Rock to and
[30:40] fro signs of his
[30:43] coming oh it's a great day that we're
[30:46] now living
[30:48] in earthquakes and diverse
[30:52] places
[30:53] pestilence all those things that Jesus
[30:58] Jesus spoke of is
[31:01] here to my way seeing it I don't see
[31:06] anything left but the coming of the lord
[31:10] it's at hand Jesus in the also in his
[31:15] address to his people he said learn a
[31:19] parable of the Fig dream when it is
[31:22] tender and begins to put forth leaves
[31:26] you say summer is not
[31:28] and when you see these things begin to
[31:31] come to pass know that the time is at
[31:38] hand notice what the Fig Tree was the
[31:42] fig tree has always been the Jewish
[31:46] Nation he said not only the Fig Tree but
[31:50] the other tree when you see the Fig Tree
[31:54] and all the other trees putting forth
[31:57] their
[31:58] buds now he spoke not only of the Fig
[32:01] Tree but the other
[32:04] tree now let's just notice when it's
[32:06] putting forth its
[32:09] Bud we have lived in a very peculiar
[32:14] time in the past few
[32:17] years the Gentile church has had one of
[32:22] the greatest Revival that has ever had
[32:26] since there since the days of the
[32:28] Apostles or the Gentile Church didn't
[32:31] have the Revival then it was the Jewish
[32:35] church that had the
[32:36] Revival but the Gentile Church in the
[32:39] past 10 or 12 years has had the greatest
[32:43] Revival of the
[32:45] history we are thinking of the Martin
[32:47] Luther Revival yester it was a great but
[32:51] that was in
[32:52] Germany
[32:54] alone we're thinking of the Wesley
[32:56] Revival that that was in
[32:58] England it spread forth over here in a
[33:01] few of the British aisles but never took
[33:03] too much effect but in this day this
[33:08] revival at on of the supernatural as
[33:13] absolutely covered from sea to boundless
[33:16] sea amen the world over to Great radio
[33:22] and magazin and advances who went out on
[33:28] sponsored by mankind and a daughter
[33:32] Revival that tens of thousands times
[33:35] thousands of souls have been born into
[33:38] the kingdom of
[33:40] God In my own little fragile Ministry
[33:44] that the Lord has given me I've seen
[33:46] well over a million Souls come to the
[33:50] kingdom of God Amen think of it when
[33:54] others of these great Ministries who
[33:57] sweep out radio and so forth to the
[34:00] millions there's Revival fires that's
[34:03] burnt on every hill in the
[34:05] world practically since I since about 10
[34:09] years ago since uh we got started in the
[34:13] Revival we're at the end time now
[34:18] notice then just before that he
[34:22] prophesied here and said the walls of
[34:25] Jerusalem will be Tred down down by the
[34:28] Gentiles until the Gentile dispensation
[34:32] would be
[34:33] finished the Mohamad have tuck it over
[34:37] we realize that and I want you to look
[34:40] at the crisis
[34:43] tonight how ishma and Isaac are still at
[34:47] each other's neck right at Jerusalem
[34:51] where it's predicted they would
[34:54] be and a few years ago there was hardly
[34:58] any Jews at all in
[35:00] Jerusalem now Jesus speaking when you
[35:03] see the Fig Tree put forth its
[35:07] Bud now the Jews has been scattered to
[35:11] all the
[35:12] world great numbers millions in Germany
[35:17] and in Italy and in the United States
[35:21] all over the world and God as he did in
[35:25] the early days hardened Pharaoh's heart
[35:28] he hardened muscan his heart on the
[35:32] Jews and the Jews was ousted
[35:35] from Italy he hardened Hitler's heart
[35:40] and they were oued from Germany he
[35:44] hardened Stalin's heart and they were Ed
[35:49] from uh
[35:51] Russia and have you been noticing the
[35:56] paper that we the United States are
[35:59] taking sides with the Arabs
[36:04] amen oh
[36:07] brother the handwritings on the
[36:13] wall God said whoever blesses Israel
[36:16] will be blessed who curses Israel shall
[36:20] be cursed
[36:23] amen now I have a picture
[36:28] at home or I believe it's loaned out at
[36:31] the time called but the scientist 3
[36:36] minutes before
[36:39] midnight if the scientific
[36:43] world has said the clock has went around
[36:47] until it's 3 minutes before midnight and
[36:51] I think they cut that down now to about
[36:53] 1 minute before midnight when they
[36:57] discovered
[36:58] hydrogen uh
[37:00] oxygen Atomic all those great powers
[37:04] that they could harness could completely
[37:07] cause a total annihilation in 5 minutes
[37:13] time they could absolutely tonight not
[37:17] be one living person on the entire North
[37:22] America continent in 30 minutes
[37:27] and it's laying right in a bunch of
[37:30] infidel TS who ha
[37:34] us and besides that we've got
[37:38] barges and ships set all placed
[37:43] around on both to
[37:46] Siberia over in
[37:49] Hungaria and different places where our
[37:52] ships are setting loaded with the same
[37:55] type of missiles
[37:59] Breen if later than you
[38:06] think Solomon Gore little knew that
[38:09] night that they were living their last
[38:14] hour little in Egypt know that the death
[38:18] angel that had been predicted to come
[38:20] would come that
[38:23] night little did Pearl Harbor realize
[38:27] that raised the tough
[38:28] [Music]
[38:30] place we are we in the bounce and found
[38:34] warning we are near the end
[38:38] time what would happen if they right in
[38:42] Moscow could direct them missile Guided
[38:46] by the stars and radar could land that
[38:49] bomb exactly on Fourth Street in Lille
[38:51] if you wanted
[38:53] to right and we can stand out there in
[38:56] the seon somewhere on our ships and
[38:58] direct one right straight on the Caple
[39:00] of Moscow if we want
[39:02] to what would happen my
[39:06] brother if that great missile turning
[39:09] would take place and this country would
[39:12] receive a shake at the same hour we turn
[39:15] loose the same things and shake it to
[39:17] the other
[39:18] side and we're living on a little bitty
[39:22] tiny thin crust
[39:24] anyhow when the earthquake say eat
[39:27] around and eat around until it's like
[39:30] pwing out an
[39:32] egg it you make one big burst and this
[39:37] 8,000 M stick of lav would spurt into
[39:41] the
[39:42] air it would do exactly what God Said
[39:46] would take
[39:48] place we're at the end
[39:51] time we are
[39:54] here no way to stop it all the begging
[39:58] we might put a Eisenhower and ever
[40:00] County and it will never stop it Jesus
[40:05] Christ said these times would come we
[40:08] are
[40:09] here the Fig Tree putting forth its
[40:13] bug in this picture way down in Iran you
[40:18] read in the look magazine how that they
[40:21] took big planes and went down there got
[40:23] plane loads of these Jews thousands of
[40:26] them been down there since the carrying
[40:29] away of
[40:30] Babylon been in there for 2500
[40:34] years and had been left down there they
[40:38] were apping with old wooden
[40:40] instruments they know nothing about
[40:43] Jesus ever being on Earth they know
[40:47] nothing about anything but their old
[40:49] Jewish tradition Traditions that they
[40:51] had lived by and when these planes set
[40:56] out
[40:58] and begin to load these Jews on to take
[41:01] them back to the
[41:06] Homeland the prophet prophesied 28 or
[41:10] 300 years ago and said when they come
[41:13] out of that captivity God will bring
[41:16] them forth on the wings of eagles
[41:21] amen the prophet saw the plane coming he
[41:25] saw them sitting down on and picking
[41:27] them up and taking them back to the
[41:30] Homeland he didn't know what to call it
[41:33] he just looked like an eagle to him so
[41:36] he said they'd be brought back on the
[41:38] wings of
[41:39] eagles and when they got out of the
[41:43] airships and the young was he the old
[41:47] they were interviewed and they said have
[41:50] have you come back to the homelands to
[41:53] die they said no we've come back to see
[41:58] the
[42:01] Messiah oh great
[42:04] steamship from around the world in the
[42:07] last few years has steamed into
[42:09] Jerusalem with aged Jews young and old
[42:14] dress in their gar com from the east
[42:17] from the
[42:18] west and hanging over the Capal of
[42:22] Jerusalem is that old six point star of
[42:25] David the oldest in the world that
[42:28] hasn't fed for
[42:29] 2500 years is declared a nation tonight
[42:34] amen Big Trees is putting forth her
[42:39] buds Jerusalem is
[42:44] growing the Lord is
[42:47] restoring the signs that the prophet
[42:51] foretold that Gentile days numbered with
[42:55] farrows and crumbers
[42:58] return oh disperse to your own amen for
[43:02] the day of redemption is near man's
[43:06] hearts are failing for fear be filled
[43:11] with God's spirit your lamp trimmed and
[43:14] clear look up your redemption's drawing
[43:20] near it's later than we
[43:24] think we don't come to church to occupy
[43:28] a Pew we do not come to church to hear a
[43:31] good sermon or come to church to hear
[43:34] good music they're all got their
[43:39] place but what we better come to church
[43:42] to do us check up with God and our soul
[43:47] salvation for the day of redemption is
[43:52] near Jesus Christ God's son liken this
[43:56] he said
[43:57] to a
[43:58] woman and in our subject tonight we find
[44:03] this woman her husband had
[44:06] gone and she had lost one of the coins
[44:10] out of her
[44:13] tablet now I will try to explain that
[44:17] the day if a woman is married she should
[44:20] wear a wedding ring as a sign that she's
[44:24] married that's to keep other men from
[44:27] having anything to do with her they look
[44:30] and they see she's a married woman those
[44:33] days they didn't have wedding rings they
[44:36] had a tablet they call it tablet they
[44:39] put on their head it had 10
[44:42] coins and it went around their head and
[44:45] that was a sign they were a married
[44:48] woman and no man must have fool with
[44:50] them no boys was to flirt with them they
[44:54] were married each one of those coins if
[44:57] we only had time but I hav't I'm going
[44:59] to try to keep my word as close as
[45:02] possible I can tell you what each one of
[45:04] those coins
[45:06] meant it was placed in
[45:09] there and each coin meant a certain
[45:12] virtue of that
[45:14] woman the first meaning her love to her
[45:19] husband second her pledge of virtue to
[45:22] live clean for him and the third and
[45:25] fourth and fifth all to the n9th and
[45:29] 10th if you want to look it up look in
[45:31] Galatians 5 you'll find out that that
[45:35] woman represented the
[45:37] church and the church is an
[45:40] espoused wife to
[45:43] Christ and the tablet that the church is
[45:46] supposed to wear is found in Galatians 5
[45:50] which is love joy peace longsuffering
[45:55] goodness weakness
[45:58] patience that is the tablet that's
[46:01] supposed to be worn in the church
[46:05] Brotherly Love kindness
[46:09] fellowship and this woman when it must
[46:12] have been along about
[46:15] dark that she
[46:17] realized that she lost one of those
[46:23] kind oh if there ever wasn't time that
[46:28] the church ought to take inventory to
[46:31] find out if you got all the coins on it
[46:36] should be
[46:37] now it's getting
[46:40] dark the the very haunt and clouds of
[46:46] destroying civilization is hanging over
[46:49] the
[46:50] Earth sin and deot on every
[46:54] hand we're living in a tremendous
[46:59] time when there's
[47:01] wickedness people who go to church just
[47:05] for a shame people who go to church to
[47:09] try to hide from their
[47:11] meanness people who go to church and
[47:14] profess Christianity and live like the
[47:17] rest of the
[47:19] world drinking smoking gambling winning
[47:25] immorally dressed
[47:29] wearing clothes that they ought to wear
[47:31] in the in their own dressing
[47:35] room out on the street before
[47:39] public and Brotherly Love is a thing
[47:43] that's pass me
[47:45] almost we have not lost one coin but
[47:50] we've lost prly every one of
[47:53] them and it was getting nice and
[47:57] remember her husband would
[48:01] return and if he found her with one of
[48:05] those coins out it showed she'd been
[48:08] marked a
[48:09] harlot if she had defiled or defiled
[48:14] herself in any way and it was seen by
[48:17] the people they brought her before the
[48:20] priest and brought witness that she had
[48:23] been found such and the priest seeing
[48:26] that she was a married woman took the
[48:29] coin out of her tablet that she'd been
[48:32] doing wrong by if she had marred her
[48:36] virtues they took that out if she had
[48:40] been flirting showing that she wasn't
[48:41] true to her husband they tuck that one
[48:44] out whatever it was they tuck it
[48:47] out and when her husband returned he
[48:51] found that she had been
[48:54] marked and he would divorce her
[48:57] immediately and have nothing to do with
[49:00] such a woman he did not want such a
[49:03] woman so it was getting along towards
[49:07] dark when she realized that she had lost
[49:12] something time for her husband to come
[49:16] and it's getting
[49:18] late the church better be examining
[49:21] theirself by the word of God

[49:45] of the world of the Christian church is
[49:48] associating in those things today so you
[49:51] can't hardly tell the one from the
[49:54] other it's time weat tough inventory

[50:30] so much for emotion not for some
[50:33] fantastic not for some emotional workup

[51:02] bru and the neighbors could see the dust
[51:07] flying she had a real house cleaning
[51:10] time for her husband was about to come
[51:14] and if he called her with that one coin

[51:18] harlot brother we the Church of the
[51:21] Living God these great hours that we're
[51:24] now living it use us to check
[51:29] up go before God light the candle of the
[51:34] word of the gospel and examine ourselves

[51:42] things coming we're at the end time the
[51:46] coming of Christ is at hand there's not
[51:48] another hope in the world for the church

[52:02] when they say l our Lord the L is coming
[52:05] and they'll be devouring and biting one
[52:07] another and so forth and fighting around

[54:19] heart soul mind and
[54:21] everything when he made man in the dust
[54:24] of Earth he separated from his wife

[54:30] woman pick up some more dirt but he took
[54:33] from the side of Adam a rib and made his
[54:37] wife he said she's bone of my bone Flesh
[54:40] of My Flesh they were one in heart soul
[54:43] and body it's a type of
[54:46] Christ God didn't take Christ Church
[54:50] from a Creed neither did he take it from
[54:53] a denomination he taken it from the
[54:55] heart of

[1:06:18] break every scientific law there
[1:06:21] is your hand by Nature by gravitation
[1:06:24] ought to hang down
[1:06:26] if you raise your hand it shows there's
[1:06:28] a supernatural being in you that's able
[1:06:31] to defy the laws of nature to raise your
[1:06:33] hand toward your
[1:06:34] creator something in your heart made a
[1:06:37] decision God sees you raising your hands
[1:06:40] just the same as he sees you at the
[1:06:41] altar that's exactly right if you mean
[1:06:44] it God means it too but look friend you
[1:06:48] can't be halfway you've got to mean
[1:06:52] it now let us pray blessed Heavenly

[1:07:13] up in the building that they needed
[1:07:16] Christ oh God it's their
[1:07:19] souls the spirit of oil is just about
[1:07:23] burnt out there won't be much more when
[1:07:26] the last drops gone from the bucket or
[1:07:29] the container there will be no more or
[1:07:31] put in lamps they realize that they're
[1:07:34] in the last days there's not a Hope on
[1:07:37] Earth for us outside of Christ I pray
[1:07:41] tonight Lord that somehow in the
[1:07:43] solemnness of this moment this
[1:07:46] solity that you will now send the holy
[1:07:50] spirit that made them raise their hands
[1:07:53] and save them from a life of sin
[1:07:56] granted father and may before this
[1:07:59] meeting shall
[1:08:01] end May there be literally dozens of
[1:08:04] them many shouting with the Holy Spirit
