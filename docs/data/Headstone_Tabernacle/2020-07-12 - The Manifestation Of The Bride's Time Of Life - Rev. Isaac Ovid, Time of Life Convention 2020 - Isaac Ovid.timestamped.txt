[53:38] hold my greetings
[53:39] after the scripture so if you have your
[53:43] Bibles woody tuned with me to two
[53:46] portions of scripture reading Genesis 1
[53:51] and verse 1 and reading from Genesis 18
[54:00] Genesis 1 and for this one and Genesis
[54:05] 18 from verse 10 Genesis 1:1 in the
[54:09] beginning God created the heaven and the
[54:11] earth I will stop right there and
[54:14] reading 18 from this 10 and he said I
[54:20] will certainly return unto thee
[54:21] according to the time of life and lo
[54:24] Sarah thy wife shall have a son and
[54:27] Sarah heard it in the 10 door which was
[54:30] behind him now Abraham and Sarah were
[54:33] all and well stricken in age and it
[54:36] ceased to be with Sarah after the manner
[54:38] of woman therefore Sarah laughed within
[54:41] herself saying after I am waxed all
[54:43] shall I have pleasure my lord being old
[54:46] also and the Lord said unto Abraham
[54:48] wherefore did Sarah laugh saying shall I
[54:51] of a surety be a child which I'm old is
[54:54] anything too hard for the Lord at time
[54:57] appointed I will return unto thee
[55:00] according to the time of life and Sarah
[55:02] shall have a son my lord a blessing to
[55:05] the reading of his word can we just bow
[55:07] our heads for
[55:08] of Prayer Oh gracious Heavenly Father we
[55:10] thank you Lord to be in a presence we
[55:13] thank you for Lord this virtual
[55:15] convention that you have allowed us to
[55:17] be able to Lord by your grease come
[55:21] together in a unusual way and
[55:23] unprecedented we and Lord - think how
[55:26] you work so perfectly Lord when we
[55:29] father would see what's happening around
[55:31] the world to see yet still you could
[55:33] find a way to connect with your people
[55:35] so Lord may you bless those that are
[55:38] Lord here as bless those that are
[55:41] connected
[55:42] Lord bless those that will hear the tape
[55:44] father may you bless the believers
[55:46] around the world and may you be with us
[55:48] in the precious name of Jesus Christ
[55:49] amen and amen and amen you may be seated
[55:52] in the presence of the Lord so amen we
[55:56] are we are in the convention and I
[56:00] certainly want to greet everyone who is
[56:04] connecting to the meeting and salute all
[56:07] the ministers who are speaking in the
[56:10] virtual convention in this unprecedented
[56:13] time when the enemy thought that he
[56:16] could disrupt the program of God God has
[56:19] a way of putting things around and
[56:21] moving things around and the same way he
[56:23] did it before he's able to do that again
[56:25] amen and one asset needs to loot all the
[56:29] ministers who would speak and those who
[56:31] would bring their greetings and all the
[56:32] specials that would be sung throughout
[56:35] the meeting and have been sung and the
[56:38] technical team and all of the churches
[56:40] and believers around the world the
[56:43] translators who would have made it
[56:44] possible for French and Spanish
[56:47] translation as well and what a time that
[56:50] we are living in that the bride could be
[56:52] united remember the Prophet said one day
[56:55] that God will could move this thing
[56:56] overnight overnight you can move around
[56:59] the world and I believe that's the
[57:00] season that we are living in and we know
[57:03] the theme of this convention is time of
[57:07] life and it's a theme that you would
[57:09] hear through that scripture in Genesis
[57:12] 18 throughout many of the different
[57:14] services so my degrees of God we are
[57:17] looking to
[57:18] see how God would open to us in this
[57:20] service amen so jesus said that I must
[57:24] be about my father's business and when
[57:28] you are running a business you come to
[57:30] understand that you have to separate
[57:32] working in the business and on the
[57:34] business for years there were teachers
[57:36] in business school you have to work in
[57:38] the business and you have to work on the
[57:40] business but now they say that they work
[57:43] is expanded from in the business and on
[57:46] the business to above the business in
[57:49] other words the higher you go the more
[57:51] you see but more than that it takes
[57:53] great skill to be able to work in the
[57:56] business on the business and above the
[57:58] business at the same time but when you
[58:01] look at the economy of God he is able to
[58:03] work in the business on the business and
[58:06] above the business at the same time
[58:08] you'll see where I'm going in a minute
[58:10] so look at Jonah Jonah he is in the
[58:13] business at Jonah's level he is dealing
[58:17] with his personal issues of the
[58:20] consequences of not going to Nineveh
[58:22] he's going through his mind battles he
[58:24] is going through his experience he is
[58:26] going through how he feels and he says
[58:28] throw me off the boat he is looking at
[58:31] it from his eyes only but just above
[58:34] Jonah's experience he doesn't even
[58:37] realize that the Nineveh he is running
[58:39] from their worship of his garden so a
[58:42] bit higher than his understanding is the
[58:45] fact that God already knows what it will
[58:47] take to deliver the people in Nineveh
[58:49] and Jonah doesn't understand that he is
[58:52] part of a bigger plan can the church say
[58:54] man he doesn't realize that his mistakes
[58:57] was counted as part of a bigger plan he
[59:00] is looking at it just for himself but he
[59:03] is part of a bigger picture can the
[59:04] church say man and when you go even
[59:06] higher we see Jesus in Matthew said for
[59:09] as Jonas was three days and three nights
[59:12] in the whales belly so shall the Son of
[59:14] Man be three days and three nights in
[59:17] the heart of the earth
[59:18] so in other words why Chula is in his
[59:20] pity party threw me off the boat in the
[59:23] economy of cord chorus eNOS
[59:25] part of his own story come to church see
[59:28] mmm
[59:28] so I want you to see tonight that you
[59:30] are part of a bigger story you are part
[59:33] of a bigger plan we are part of a bigger
[59:35] plan can the church say Amen so at the
[59:39] same time we could see the same
[59:41] situation addressing different issues so
[59:45] from this evening I want to look at the
[59:47] time of life from another angle this
[59:50] morning I you with me this morning are
[59:52] you ready to ride with me this morning
[59:54] can we go way way way back way back
[59:57] before Abraham can we go there this
[59:59] morning can we go there this evening so
[1:00:02] in the beginning God created the heaven
[1:00:05] and the earth we read the scripture that
[1:00:08] is the entire of Genesis 1:1 in the
[1:00:11] beginning God created the heaven and the
[1:00:15] earth that is all it says in Genesis 1:1
[1:00:18] in the beginning God created the heaven
[1:00:21] and the earth he created two realms can
[1:00:26] the church say man he created two
[1:00:28] jurisdictions he created two seats of
[1:00:32] power there's a power over heaven and
[1:00:36] there's a power over the earth can the
[1:00:39] church say Amen and in God's plan the
[1:00:42] power over heaven and the power over the
[1:00:45] earth are designed to be connected
[1:00:48] anybody beats with you anybody with me
[1:00:50] today the power over heaven and the
[1:00:53] power over the earth are designed to be
[1:00:55] connected to government in heaven and
[1:00:58] the government on the earth are designed
[1:01:01] to be connected everything works when
[1:01:04] the government in heaven and the
[1:01:06] government on earth are in order when
[1:01:09] the government in heaven and the
[1:01:10] government on the earth are in alignment
[1:01:12] that is the way court always saw it that
[1:01:14] is how it unfolded in his plan that's
[1:01:17] how it unfolded in his mind
[1:01:19] Kenneth CMM so we know that la la Elohim
[1:01:24] was a self-existing one we know that he
[1:01:27] made heaven first we know that he then
[1:01:30] made angels can the church he mana and
[1:01:33] after that is when he may be earth
[1:01:35] with me this morning so we know from job
[1:01:38] 38 called
[1:01:39] axe job where was that when I laid the
[1:01:41] foundation of yet when the morning stars
[1:01:44] sang together so there was singing going
[1:01:46] on when the foundations of the earth was
[1:01:48] being laid anybody with me this morning
[1:01:51] and the church say man but at some point
[1:01:54] there was war in heaven we're going
[1:01:58] somewhere there was war in heaven Satan
[1:02:00] Lucifer an anointed cherub a beautiful
[1:02:05] cherub and inspired a cherub a captain
[1:02:09] among the cherubs he attempted to ascend
[1:02:12] into heaven Lucifer was lifted up with
[1:02:15] pride he was pleased with himself he
[1:02:17] exalted himself above his station he
[1:02:20] exalted himself larger than he was and
[1:02:23] his pride led him to say I will be like
[1:02:27] the Most High can the church say Amen
[1:02:29] and pride interrupted worship in heaven
[1:02:32] all along there was worship in heaven
[1:02:35] and suddenly something began to
[1:02:37] interrupt this worship because corn is
[1:02:40] the object of worship are you with me
[1:02:41] we're building to something pride was
[1:02:44] the first attack on God the first threat
[1:02:48] on God because the first doctrine that
[1:02:51] pride taught was you don't have to
[1:02:53] worship God you have another option
[1:03:00] Satan's pride and his lust for power is
[1:03:03] what led to the war in heaven and sit on
[1:03:06] Lucifer the devil was kicked out of
[1:03:09] heaven and we were represented there
[1:03:12] when we keep the Lucifer out of heaven
[1:03:14] we were represented there from the
[1:03:17] church mmm and his fall is captured in
[1:03:20] Luke 10:18
[1:03:21] and he said unto them talk about Jesus I
[1:03:23] beheld Satan as lightning fall from
[1:03:26] heaven
[1:03:27] no but the Branham said that Satan hits
[1:03:29] two books in the Bible he hits the book
[1:03:32] of Genesis and he hits the book of
[1:03:35] Revelation he hits the book of
[1:03:37] Revelation because it tells of what's
[1:03:39] going to happen to him so the book of
[1:03:40] Revelation is where Satan is finished we
[1:03:42] know this
[1:03:43] the church say mmm but the book of
[1:03:45] Genesis he doesn't like the book of
[1:03:47] Genesis because there are things in
[1:03:49] Genesis that bothers the devil can the
[1:03:51] church say man we're gonna find out what
[1:03:53] that is this meeting hallelujah so
[1:03:55] Genesis finds the devil I wanted to see
[1:04:00] it in perspective now he's a defeated
[1:04:02] devil he was recently kicked out he's
[1:04:05] not the devil who's walking around
[1:04:06] feeling good he is a devil who is
[1:04:09] walking around after being kicked out of
[1:04:11] heaven he is not in a good state of mind
[1:04:13] he is not feeling good about himself he
[1:04:16] just lost a war that was in heaven he is
[1:04:19] nothing his wounds he's trying to find
[1:04:22] himself anybody with me this morning his
[1:04:24] attempted coup in heaven had just filled
[1:04:28] anybody with me this morning
[1:04:30] his grab for power in heaven have failed
[1:04:33] now I said God made heaven and earth
[1:04:36] there are two seats of power power in
[1:04:39] heaven and power on earth so he has grab
[1:04:41] for power in heaven field there's no
[1:04:44] attempt he can make to power in heaven
[1:04:47] there's no way he could get back there
[1:04:49] the challenge the power of heaven or you
[1:04:52] don't know you know with me yet I don't
[1:04:53] think you hear what I'm saying the power
[1:04:55] in heaven he tried to get it and he
[1:04:58] filled there's no second chance at his
[1:05:00] attempt at a coup because he was kicked
[1:05:02] out he can't just get back there he had
[1:05:07] oh come on now he's dead welcome there
[1:05:10] his boxes his clothes everything he had
[1:05:14] was thrown up with him and those who
[1:05:16] followed him went with him oh you don't
[1:05:18] hear me there was no room found for him
[1:05:21] that's what the Bible said there was no
[1:05:23] place for him there are you with me we
[1:05:28] building somewhere so the power in
[1:05:30] heaven was unchallenged the power in
[1:05:33] heaven was formalised
[1:05:35] the angels that remained they stood in
[1:05:38] solidarity with Michael yes no break in
[1:05:41] their rank
[1:05:41] there's no dissension in the camp
[1:05:44] there's no enemy in heaven the enemy was
[1:05:47] pushed out of heaven
[1:05:52] unquote created heaven and the earth
[1:05:56] so Satan's attempted coup in heaven
[1:05:59] filled his grab for power in heaven
[1:06:01] field we are going deeper into why he
[1:06:05] hates this book of Genesis anybody with
[1:06:07] me this evening with no access to power
[1:06:11] in heaven the only power that remained
[1:06:14] was power nerd anybody with me this
[1:06:17] morning with no access to the power in
[1:06:20] heaven the only power that remained was
[1:06:24] the power on earth can we keep on a
[1:06:28] little bit we don't know at what point
[1:06:31] Satan realize it but at some point
[1:06:35] Satan realize that power authority
[1:06:39] inheritance of this earth have been
[1:06:41] given to a being to a being who had been
[1:06:47] created a little lower than the Angels
[1:06:50] God was deliberately punishing the devil
[1:06:54] he taught as a cherub as an archangel
[1:06:57] who was on the earth now at least the
[1:07:00] power to be his but he realized that the
[1:07:04] power that I've been given to a being a
[1:07:07] little lower than the Angels oh come on
[1:07:10] now
[1:07:12] this was adding insult to injury a being
[1:07:18] called man a being called Adam a perfect
[1:07:22] man a holy man a sinless man a son of
[1:07:27] God in his position not an angel
[1:07:30] somebody please flatter me
[1:07:32] and I read the chat ascription for this
[1:07:36] power one more time
[1:07:38] a perfect man a holy man a sinless man a
[1:07:42] son of God in his possession not an
[1:07:46] angel
[1:07:49] anybody with me this evening come on now
[1:07:53] get in the spirit see if it has no
[1:07:56] access to power in heaven and he's
[1:07:58] trying to make a crap for the only other
[1:08:00] seat of power this isn't a word now
[1:08:06] Satan is angry but Satan couldn't get to
[1:08:10] this man so there was war in heaven then
[1:08:14] the war stopped because it's only a war
[1:08:17] if there's a fight going on but he
[1:08:19] couldn't fight Adam this being was
[1:08:23] protected this being is anointed this
[1:08:27] being has dominion this being this
[1:08:31] authority when this being said Mountain
[1:08:34] moves the devil couldn't touch it
[1:08:36] he couldn't interrupt it he could not
[1:08:39] direct it because this son was in his
[1:08:42] position
[1:08:43] somebody preached back to me somebody
[1:08:45] helped me Satan had no power over this
[1:08:51] man Seaton could do nothing to this man
[1:08:54] you know better Branham said you could
[1:08:56] reason you could live such a life that
[1:08:57] the devil can't do nothing with you he
[1:09:00] can't reach you he can't touch you
[1:09:01] that's the kind of life I'm looking for
[1:09:03] you may be seated
[1:09:05] Adam did not have to fight I want you to
[1:09:10] catch it Adam didn't have to fight Satan
[1:09:13] was no match for Adam the fight he could
[1:09:18] have put up in heaven he couldn't bring
[1:09:20] to the earth when other one is in his
[1:09:21] position it was not a fight when this
[1:09:30] man is being little lower than the
[1:09:31] Angels that blow Lucy for mine that
[1:09:35] calls it even lower than the Angels and
[1:09:37] give the book give the book that's from
[1:09:40] this book he could speak oh come on now
[1:09:43] when this man's walk mountains have to
[1:09:46] move when this man spoke he could do
[1:09:48] whatever you want Satan could not
[1:09:50] penetrate the world that protected Adam
[1:09:53] because Adam always stood behind a wood
[1:09:56] [Applause]
[1:09:58] Satan was no match for a son in his
[1:10:01] position and I fear to you test evening
[1:10:04] Satan is no match for when you get into
[1:10:07] your position when you're in your
[1:10:08] position that ever has to back up demons
[1:10:11] have to back up the devil has to back up
[1:10:13] when you are in your position
[1:10:15] Oh hallelujah give the Lord a shout of
[1:10:18] praise I'm warming up warming up a
[1:10:21] little bit I'm not gonna be too much
[1:10:23] longer with you but ride with me
[1:10:25] but when Eve him he deceived Eve and God
[1:10:30] allowed this to happen to fulfill his
[1:10:32] plans of being a redeemer but I've
[1:10:35] realized that there's a pattern there's
[1:10:37] a cycle it seems that God was so
[1:10:40] disturbed by how the devil operated that
[1:10:43] he keeps repeating this cycle of
[1:10:44] punishment on the devil on the enemy
[1:10:47] every time that everything he gets one
[1:10:50] up core just crush him again we'll talk
[1:10:54] about it a little bit so when Eve can he
[1:10:57] deceive Eve whether Branham said Eve
[1:10:59] stepped out from behind the wood and
[1:11:01] that mistake led to the fall of man can
[1:11:05] the church a man and man lost his power
[1:11:09] man lost his authority man lost the book
[1:11:13] man lost his life and he lost his
[1:11:17] inheritance in life man had only known
[1:11:20] Dominion but now he had the Deaver
[1:11:23] getting older he had to deal with
[1:11:26] sickness he had to deal with depression
[1:11:29] and ultimately he has to deal with death
[1:11:32] but just when Satan thought he could get
[1:11:35] the power get the book get the authority
[1:11:38] that Adam had it slipped temporarily
[1:11:41] into his hands
[1:11:42] that's not where Abraham presented it
[1:11:44] but he was not qualified for the power
[1:11:48] so he could not hold on to it you see
[1:11:51] this power could only be held by someone
[1:11:53] who had the right qualifications this
[1:11:57] book of power could only be held by
[1:11:59] somebody who fit the job description it
[1:12:02] had to be a perfect man a holy man a
[1:12:05] sinless man a son of God in his position
[1:12:09] not a knee
[1:12:10] so can the church say man
[1:12:13] so the power the book the authority went
[1:12:17] back into the hands of the original
[1:12:19] owner the one who wrote the Job
[1:12:22] Description the one who created the
[1:12:24] vacancy can the church say man the one
[1:12:28] who created heaven on the earth because
[1:12:30] he created a role he created a vacancy
[1:12:33] he created a job description and all of
[1:12:35] a sudden there was nobody qualified to
[1:12:38] fit the seat so the seat became empty
[1:12:40] and the church say Amen and only then
[1:12:43] the war broke out again because know
[1:12:45] that Adam was outside the wood he had a
[1:12:48] shuttered atom can the church say Amen
[1:12:50] and the war broke out again can we build
[1:12:52] a little bit could he take some more so
[1:12:57] God began to put things in place for the
[1:13:00] sons of God to kick Satan now out of it
[1:13:02] there was no need to kick him out of
[1:13:04] heaven that was already done but the
[1:13:06] kick him out of earth jurisdiction was
[1:13:08] given to son's Dominion was given to
[1:13:12] sons can the church say Amen so he
[1:13:15] needed to find somebody who would fit
[1:13:18] the qualifications to reestablish power
[1:13:21] on it can the church say man
[1:13:24] there are some things God will do and
[1:13:26] there's some things he telling its
[1:13:28] people to do come the church amen so as
[1:13:31] we read Genesis we see quad mapping out
[1:13:34] a journey something here something there
[1:13:38] but he's on a mission remember what I
[1:13:40] said in the business on the business
[1:13:43] above the business so he's doing
[1:13:46] smokescreens they'd never think he
[1:13:47] figured out what's going on but the
[1:13:48] devil is totally confused in Genesis 4
[1:13:51] mystery of Cain and Abel with India is a
[1:13:54] mixture of redemption also sacrifice the
[1:13:57] blood all of that is tied up in there
[1:13:59] and sit-ins she went Cain killed Abel
[1:14:03] and he think that's an achievement but
[1:14:05] God is weaving something through
[1:14:07] Balotelli read Genesis 5 into 6 he
[1:14:10] speaks about Enoch a type of the bride
[1:14:12] go into the rapture just in the midst of
[1:14:14] what was taking place go out slip in up
[1:14:16] out right from under the devil hands
[1:14:18] when the devil thing keep making
[1:14:20] progress
[1:14:21] yeah have somebody who is so please God
[1:14:23] that one day he was not phone and the
[1:14:25] devil say oh gosh I just lost one can
[1:14:27] the church say ma'am God is just doing
[1:14:30] things he's moving here he's touching
[1:14:31] here he's doing this but he on a journey
[1:14:34] he's not doing anything by chance he's
[1:14:37] not doing anything by accident you are
[1:14:39] not here by chance you are not here by
[1:14:41] accident you are not in the house you
[1:14:43] are in by chance you were not in the job
[1:14:45] you are in by chance you are not in your
[1:14:47] church by chance you are not in your
[1:14:49] country by chance you don't speak the
[1:14:51] language you speak by chance God is
[1:14:54] putting things around to achieve his
[1:14:56] purpose can the church say man by
[1:15:01] Genesis 5 into 6 we know there's no Sun
[1:15:04] on the earth in a position of power and
[1:15:06] authority
[1:15:07] so Satan begins to establish himself
[1:15:09] until God repented he made man but if
[1:15:13] all know he found one man who found
[1:15:16] favor in his sight
[1:15:17] because quad will always have a witness
[1:15:19] and just when the devil thought he was
[1:15:22] establishing his kingdom go up brought
[1:15:24] the flood and destroyed it all it's a
[1:15:27] war it's a war going on it's a war to
[1:15:31] fight for the power it's a war to fight
[1:15:33] for control it's a for water fight Penda
[1:15:36] church same in Genesis 17 9 we see Noah
[1:15:43] and his family there's war but every
[1:15:45] time the enemy thinks he has the upper
[1:15:46] hand
[1:15:47] God is unfolding his plan by the Genesis
[1:15:50] 10 and look the spirits at work because
[1:15:53] understand the issue they Wednesdays a
[1:15:55] connection between the power on earth
[1:15:57] and heaven that's where the power
[1:15:59] shatter that connection look at Genesis
[1:16:02] 10 11 that's with Nimrod and what were
[1:16:05] they trying to do with the tower they
[1:16:08] were trying to connect it to heaven
[1:16:13] anybody with me and God had to confuse
[1:16:16] their language because he couldn't allow
[1:16:19] that kind of connection between heaven I
[1:16:21] can the church say Amen and it is at the
[1:16:23] end of Genesis 11 we find this man
[1:16:27] called Abram and his wife Sarai
[1:16:32] finally what he couldn't do it no or
[1:16:34] anybody
[1:16:35] she finds a foundation he could use and
[1:16:38] he begins to have conversations with
[1:16:40] Abraham whose name will be changed to
[1:16:42] Abraham you know it he begin to tell
[1:16:45] Abraham I'm your shield
[1:16:46] I'm your reward I'm your defense he
[1:16:48] beget to encourage Abram aneema gonna
[1:16:50] talk back to God and see well well if I
[1:16:53] am I am all this thing how how am I not
[1:16:55] not not have a child and they begin to
[1:16:57] go back and forth and God wanted to use
[1:17:01] a seed of this man Abraham to ease war
[1:17:04] on the devil Abraham don't understand
[1:17:07] that he is a piece in a bigger story
[1:17:09] that God is dealing with this world war
[1:17:11] that started in heaven that's playing
[1:17:13] not only kind of should say man so he
[1:17:15] began to lay all the promises upon
[1:17:17] Abraham and he begin to place all our
[1:17:19] promises upon Abram and by Genesis 17 he
[1:17:22] visits Abraham and the first time he
[1:17:26] Ramallah it abraham laughs - and God say
[1:17:29] I'm gonna give you a son and he given
[1:17:32] the name of his son his name will be
[1:17:33] called Isaac and then by the time I
[1:17:35] reach Genesis 18 we know it here come
[1:17:37] these three men coming up the dust your
[1:17:40] army to order profit dramatize it it was
[1:17:42] the hot Sun and Abraham step out and
[1:17:44] said my lord and lay out the food and
[1:17:46] he's hospitable and everything we know
[1:17:48] this but Abraham has a problem we know
[1:17:51] this sarah has a bigger problem
[1:17:54] Abraham is all this is as a result of
[1:17:56] Adams fault
[1:17:57] well stricken in age abraham is tired he
[1:18:02] is weary the word stricken means damaged
[1:18:06] afflicted so when the Bible says well
[1:18:09] stricken this wasn't chicken dinner
[1:18:17] properly stricken brought Abraham and
[1:18:21] Sarah well stricken in age the effects
[1:18:24] of age had them well damaged
[1:18:27] well afflicted not just tired and weary
[1:18:31] and Amidon afflicted but we know it it
[1:18:33] ceased to be with Sarah after the manner
[1:18:36] of woman so what was being presented to
[1:18:39] Abraham and Sarah was a kind of
[1:18:41] impossibility the same where sometimes
[1:18:43] you think it's impossible for you to
[1:18:45] make it
[1:18:46] the CMAs sometime you look at yourself
[1:18:49] and say listen by feeling so tired I
[1:18:51] feel so weary and it's but in a long
[1:18:53] time and you take your car go on so God
[1:18:59] is speaking to Abraham and Sarah over
[1:19:01] here in the tent and Sarah couldn't
[1:19:06] understand how what she was hearing was
[1:19:08] possible
[1:19:09] Sarah is operating by the limitations
[1:19:12] she plays on herself she was operating
[1:19:18] by the limitation of her thinking
[1:19:19] because clearly God's thinking on the
[1:19:21] matter and hers were different and God's
[1:19:26] thinking on the matter was more truth
[1:19:27] than Sarah's thinking on the matter
[1:19:30] Sarah had accepted her condition and I
[1:19:34] would say there many people who come to
[1:19:35] church and they accept their condition
[1:19:37] Sarah accepted this is how I am with
[1:19:40] today she accepted this is how my story
[1:19:44] will end she accepted this is my legacy
[1:19:48] my legacy this is it what you see is
[1:19:50] what you get she had resigned to accept
[1:19:53] her position as permanent she did not
[1:19:57] understand so she laughed within herself
[1:19:59] now laughing it in yourself is not
[1:20:02] laughing quietly the issue was not she
[1:20:06] laughed soft
[1:20:08] within yourself is deep unbelief is when
[1:20:12] nobody else know you're ready laughing
[1:20:15] this is the laughs anything is just too
[1:20:17] much this is well after hearing worry
[1:20:22] about this it's just it's an
[1:20:24] unreasonable kind of laughs that was
[1:20:26] Sarah
[1:20:27] there wasn't a laugh based on a joke
[1:20:29] outside this is her expressing herself
[1:20:33] and you know what and this is the real
[1:20:36] reason why Sarah's laugh didn't move god
[1:20:39] it was not about Sarah
[1:20:45] it wasn't even about Abraham it was a
[1:20:50] buddy seed oh you don't hear me tonight
[1:20:53] it had nothing to do with Abraham it had
[1:20:56] nothing to do with Sarah it was a body
[1:20:58] seed God already bypassed serious
[1:21:01] condition ha thinking I believe he was
[1:21:04] all about his seed let's look at a last
[1:21:07] dance show cry weep had nothing to do
[1:21:10] with it because God wasn't choosing in
[1:21:13] deceiving that's why Sarah's unbelief
[1:21:17] couldn't stop the promise because the
[1:21:20] plan of Cora's bigger than Sarah's doubt
[1:21:22] and the plan of God in this hour is
[1:21:25] bigger than your doubt it's bigger than
[1:21:27] your condition it's bigger than your
[1:21:29] situation it's bigger than your unbelief
[1:21:31] God hasn't even moved by how you feeling
[1:21:34] right now
[1:21:35] he's interested in the seed that's all
[1:21:38] he's interested in the seed because
[1:21:40] there's enmity between the woman seed
[1:21:42] and that serpent it's the seed and the
[1:21:45] church heal him and so when Elohim came
[1:21:48] down himself if he did not come down we
[1:21:54] couldn't be talking about time--as life
[1:21:55] this see that he was talking about was
[1:21:58] too important to leave the chance listen
[1:22:01] God could do anything he wants to do he
[1:22:03] is sovereign he gonna let Abraham and
[1:22:05] Sarah fuguro on me and have a child and
[1:22:07] his letter unfold but this was too
[1:22:08] important it was not about their feeling
[1:22:11] it was not about them he wanted to
[1:22:12] protect the purpose and plan of the seed
[1:22:14] if he did not come down there could be
[1:22:17] no time of life if he did not come down
[1:22:19] there would be no seed if he did not
[1:22:21] come down there'll be no more sire if he
[1:22:23] did not come down there'll be no
[1:22:25] generation after generation after
[1:22:27] generation if he did not come down
[1:22:29] there'll be no bride if he didn't come
[1:22:31] down there will be no final disruption
[1:22:34] of the plans of the devil that started
[1:22:36] in heaven that fell onto the earth so
[1:22:38] that mission in Genesis 18 was little
[1:22:42] about Abraham it was little about Sarah
[1:22:45] but it was a lot of people coming into
[1:22:47] power it was a people coming into
[1:22:49] position can the church
[1:22:52] Oh hallelujah I forgot to give my title
[1:23:00] it's the manifestation of the bride's
[1:23:03] time of life can the church see man and
[1:23:05] my subject the Ministry of the royal
[1:23:08] seed of Abraham and an inspiration is
[1:23:11] anything too hard for the Lord man I
[1:23:16] know you've heard it and I know you will
[1:23:17] hear it and you'll hear it again and I'm
[1:23:20] gonna keep hearing it until you catch
[1:23:22] the revelation because when God had to
[1:23:24] deal with Sarah he just asked one
[1:23:26] question is anything too hard for the
[1:23:29] Lord I'm the one who made heaven I'm the
[1:23:31] one who made the earth I'm the one who
[1:23:33] gave life Satan cannot give life Adam
[1:23:36] was in a position to impart life you
[1:23:38] know that you can call names from the
[1:23:40] book so God is say listen I don't care
[1:23:42] what the situation is there's nothing I
[1:23:44] cannot solve there's no problem I cannot
[1:23:46] deal with can the church say man Oh
[1:23:50] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah if he
[1:23:53] did not come down no one would ever be
[1:23:56] qualified to take the book that
[1:24:00] visitation and Genesis II team was
[1:24:02] critical to the entire plan of God the
[1:24:06] seed of Abraham was too important in the
[1:24:09] plan of God can the church say man now
[1:24:12] listen got to do whatever he wants to he
[1:24:16] could have let them just have a baby but
[1:24:18] he didn't want what was about to happen
[1:24:20] to be a surprise to them God came to let
[1:24:23] them know all things and already and God
[1:24:26] does things so the devil here sinner I
[1:24:33] don't think you understand how this war
[1:24:36] in heaven this God was parted by it you
[1:24:38] know so when God said it is good it is
[1:24:43] good it is good
[1:24:44] back in Genesis 1 he noted every and all
[1:24:47] of that
[1:24:53] and still see don't know what happening
[1:24:55] and in that same time of Genesis 18 we
[1:24:59] see the introduction of going ante with
[1:25:03] Sodom and Gomorrah in the same chapter
[1:25:04] so Satan me a nervous no because he
[1:25:08] seemed God who dealt with the flood and
[1:25:10] dealt with the Tower of Babel is coming
[1:25:12] now to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah but in
[1:25:15] the midst of that God is dealing with
[1:25:17] his promise and his promise coming to
[1:25:20] pass he is dealing with his plan of
[1:25:22] redemption he is dealing with his whole
[1:25:24] program of God and he says it's anything
[1:25:27] too hard for the Lord leave Sarah to
[1:25:29] hold that and all truly each his times
[1:25:32] life and appointed time he said at the
[1:25:34] appointed time I'm gonna return to you
[1:25:38] so there's time and there's an appointed
[1:25:41] time and when the appointed time comes
[1:25:44] nothing could stop it you see when I say
[1:25:48] is anything to eat so at the appointed
[1:25:49] time I'm gonna return you gonna have
[1:25:51] that child nothing gonna stop it your
[1:25:54] age can't stop it all your feel can't
[1:25:55] stop it you just keep on walking and
[1:25:57] watch it unfold one of these days you're
[1:26:00] gonna meet your appointed time and when
[1:26:03] you meet your point then there's nothing
[1:26:05] you can do about it one near your
[1:26:07] healing there's an appointed time the
[1:26:09] baptism the Holy Ghost is an appointed
[1:26:11] time your son has an appointed time your
[1:26:14] daughter has an appointed time your wife
[1:26:17] has an appointed time can the church say
[1:26:19] Amen Oh hallelujah and go to the left
[1:26:24] that scripture is anything too hard for
[1:26:26] the Lord you know how many people don't
[1:26:28] hold on to that Scripture I don't care
[1:26:32] what the doctor says is anything too
[1:26:33] hard for the Lord I don't care what your
[1:26:35] company says it's anything too hard for
[1:26:37] the Lord I don't care what the situation
[1:26:39] is in your home is anything too hard for
[1:26:41] the Lord I could imagine truly Ages when
[1:26:45] David feeling all low and if you didn't
[1:26:46] honor maybe just remember to how caught
[1:26:49] him and visit Abraham and Sarah and how
[1:26:51] impossible the situation was because the
[1:26:53] situation was impossible and in that
[1:26:55] impossible situation that was the
[1:26:58] comfort that God gave them is anything
[1:27:00] too hard for the Lord and I can imagine
[1:27:01] David shaking his head he said well if
[1:27:03] they could they could make it with that
[1:27:05] would I
[1:27:06] make it two how can the Chertsey ran
[1:27:09] throughout every age people holding on
[1:27:11] is anything too hard for the Lord we got
[1:27:13] to do this but is anything too hard for
[1:27:15] the Lord maybe that wasn't just was hot
[1:27:17] when he was looking at Jericho is
[1:27:19] anything too hard for the Lord if that
[1:27:21] impossible situation that could never be
[1:27:23] recovered could be recovered is anything
[1:27:26] too hard for the Lord
[1:27:26] Oh hallelujah even known to Jeremiah
[1:27:30] many years later I said our Lord called
[1:27:33] behold to admit heaven on the earth by
[1:27:36] great power and stretch out arm and
[1:27:38] there is nothing too hard for thee can
[1:27:40] the church say man I say today there's
[1:27:43] nothing too hard for you there's nothing
[1:27:45] too hard for God your healing not had
[1:27:48] your breakthrough
[1:27:49] not too hard oh come on now that's why
[1:27:53] the prophesy missing limbs will be
[1:27:55] restored not too hard for God nothing is
[1:27:59] too hard for God God say what you think
[1:28:01] is hard what you think is too hard it's
[1:28:04] not a problem your gray hair going black
[1:28:07] that's not too hard for God my in that
[1:28:11] visitation God in front of the devil try
[1:28:14] to turn Abraham's age back in front of
[1:28:18] the devil because the turn see Rose is
[1:28:20] but you know the thing you think this
[1:28:21] was a conversation you did the people
[1:28:23] say by Abraham you looking different you
[1:28:25] working on what going on everybody's
[1:28:26] gonna see him again he looking
[1:28:27] completely young body change you don't
[1:28:29] think that was talked about you didn't
[1:28:31] people say what happened to Abram and
[1:28:33] Sarah can the church say man
[1:28:35] Oh hallelujah hallelujah and from that
[1:28:39] time on when God walked away from there
[1:28:42] and spoke about a time of life the
[1:28:44] countdown was on to a time of life that
[1:28:47] would come the cone on his own throat
[1:28:49] all the ages for a time of life because
[1:28:52] his cycles in seasons every time there
[1:28:55] was a move of God it was like it was the
[1:28:56] spirit was a power of God that was
[1:28:58] moving I was a cone own can the church
[1:29:00] say Amen all leading up to what leading
[1:29:04] up to Jesus Christ coming on the face of
[1:29:08] the earth every prophet every message
[1:29:11] every messenger was pointing to a seed
[1:29:16] Paula says that seats plural is that one
[1:29:19] seat returned with a royal seed of
[1:29:21] Abraham we talking about Jesus Christ
[1:29:23] because he was the one who was the come
[1:29:25] to re-establish the connection between
[1:29:28] heaven and earth with a connection
[1:29:30] between the power candid shirts a man
[1:29:32] and when Jesus came he slowly began to
[1:29:35] delegate power you know what I'm saying
[1:29:41] do you know there's nowhere in the Old
[1:29:43] Testament you can find a demon being
[1:29:44] cast out nowhere in the Old Testament
[1:29:53] you can find a demon being cast on the
[1:29:56] closest you have is the evil spirit on
[1:30:00] soul and when David play the harp
[1:30:03] veterans this food would leave but after
[1:30:06] a season it would come back again and
[1:30:09] David had to go on pretty hot again it
[1:30:13] reminds you of how dare to go and make
[1:30:14] this sacrifice and after why'd it have
[1:30:16] to gonna make another sacrifice and
[1:30:18] another sacrifice because they were just
[1:30:21] covering up
[1:30:22] but when Jesus came he started delegate
[1:30:27] pour he sat up undo everything the devil
[1:30:30] had tried to do so in so many Luke 10
[1:30:34] the Bible said and his 70 returned again
[1:30:36] with joy seeing Lord even the Devils are
[1:30:39] subject unto us through thy name and he
[1:30:42] said unto them I beheld Satan as
[1:30:44] lightning fall from heaven look at he
[1:30:46] contacts away please sir he tied it
[1:30:48] straight back to Genesis behold I give
[1:30:52] unto you power because that's what they
[1:30:54] lost I give you power to tread on
[1:30:56] serpents and scorpions and over all the
[1:30:59] power of the enemy and nothing shall by
[1:31:01] any means hurt you not withstanding in
[1:31:04] this which was not so don't just rejoice
[1:31:06] because of this power because it's a
[1:31:08] bigger plan than the power rejoice not
[1:31:12] that the spirits are subject unto you
[1:31:14] but rather rejoice because your names
[1:31:16] are written in heaven in other words
[1:31:19] you're part of a bigger plan your names
[1:31:21] are written in heaven and the church
[1:31:25] amen amen amen amen and Jesus began to
[1:31:29] rejoice he was so excited about what was
[1:31:32] unfolding and the Holy Ghost hadn't
[1:31:34] poured out yet he was so excited by what
[1:31:36] he was saying and what he was seeing he
[1:31:38] said in that hour listening the Bible
[1:31:40] Jesus rejoiced in spirit and said I
[1:31:42] thank thee O Father Lord of Heaven and
[1:31:45] it that thou has hid these things from
[1:31:47] the wise and the prudent and has
[1:31:49] revealed them unto babes even so father
[1:31:52] for it seemed good in thy sight all
[1:31:54] things are delivered to me of my father
[1:31:57] and no man knoweth who the son is but
[1:31:59] the father and who the father is but the
[1:32:01] Son and he to whom the son will reveal
[1:32:03] him and he turned him into heat and he
[1:32:06] turned him on to his disciples and said
[1:32:08] privately blessed other eyes which see
[1:32:12] the things that you see for I tell you
[1:32:14] that many prophets and Kings have
[1:32:16] desired to see those things which he see
[1:32:18] and I've not seen them to hear those
[1:32:20] things which he hear and have not heard
[1:32:22] them can the church say man what was
[1:32:26] Jesus doing he was rebuilding he was
[1:32:28] reestablishing power and authority that
[1:32:31] Adam had lost that city was trying to
[1:32:34] grab so this is why I went in Matthew
[1:32:36] Jesus asked them who do men say I am and
[1:32:38] the revelation broke upon who he was and
[1:32:41] what his ministry was by Matthew 16:19
[1:32:44] listen to what Jesus says he said I will
[1:32:47] give unto thee will give unto thee the
[1:32:49] keys of the kingdom of heaven and
[1:32:53] whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth
[1:32:56] shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever
[1:32:59] thou shalt loose on earth shall be
[1:33:01] loosed in heaven
[1:33:02] and the church say man what is Jesus
[1:33:05] doing
[1:33:05] he is reestablished in that connection
[1:33:07] for the first time he was finding people
[1:33:10] he can have that conversation with oh
[1:33:12] come on now somebody preached back to me
[1:33:15] or you don't hear me this evening the
[1:33:20] keys signify authority I always wonder
[1:33:23] you know they get people keys to the
[1:33:25] city the mayor have the key to the city
[1:33:29] he can open the city
[1:33:32] but it's symbolic it represents trust it
[1:33:36] represents Authority so Karma's saying
[1:33:39] when he saw what you were seeing
[1:33:40] unfolding you say I'm gonna give you
[1:33:41] this key because I could see somebody I
[1:33:44] could trust I can see some like a place
[1:33:46] Authority - I'm seeing signs of what I
[1:33:49] wanted to have when I place atom they're
[1:33:51] kind of chancy man I listen by Matthew
[1:33:56] 28:18 Jesus came and said unto them
[1:34:00] saying all power is given unto me this
[1:34:02] is his resurrection now anybody with me
[1:34:05] now he said all power is given unto me
[1:34:08] in heaven and in it so walking among
[1:34:14] them was one man who was sitting on two
[1:34:16] seats of power all power in heaven all
[1:34:19] power in it was in this wrapped up in
[1:34:22] this royal seat or you don't hear me
[1:34:25] [Applause]
[1:34:27] this is what the prophets were waitin
[1:34:29] for this is what the kings was waiting
[1:34:31] for this is what Daniel was waitin for
[1:34:34] oh come on now Oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:34:40] and here it was sittin can't figure out
[1:34:43] what's going on cuz he had never seen
[1:34:45] anything like this and the Bible said
[1:34:47] that Jesus himself was made a little
[1:34:49] lower than the Angels because it had to
[1:34:52] be a kinsman it had to be somebody like
[1:34:56] Adam who could go and take a power it
[1:34:59] couldn't be an angel
[1:35:00] now go and take the power oh come on now
[1:35:03] come on now we preach about the secret
[1:35:06] mission of Jesus that God had to leave
[1:35:08] glory take on wrap himself in flesh but
[1:35:12] he had to die as a mere mortal Lord and
[1:35:15] the angels to allow him to go down in
[1:35:17] the realm of the devil and take the keys
[1:35:20] from Satan he did everything Satan had
[1:35:22] he never had the book but the little
[1:35:25] power that Satan had over death and hell
[1:35:28] he took that from the devil he took it
[1:35:32] from him
[1:35:32] open the church hey man and what did he
[1:35:35] do with it he said bride I'm gonna give
[1:35:38] you this flower because your place is
[1:35:40] not a rule heaven
[1:35:41] your place is to rain on the
[1:35:43] no wonder the Bible says we shall reign
[1:35:46] on the earth that's a testimony that is
[1:35:49] what makes Genesis 18 so powerful
[1:35:55] without the time of life there's no
[1:35:58] power without the time of life we cannot
[1:36:00] reign but we can go but that time sin
[1:36:03] and we thank God because as it wasn't
[1:36:05] that day so it will be on this day I
[1:36:08] believe we are at another time of life I
[1:36:10] believe Messiah is on the earth now I
[1:36:12] believe he's fixing things around and
[1:36:14] the power the power that he had he said
[1:36:17] all I was in God he poured into Christ
[1:36:19] and all that's in Christ he poured in
[1:36:21] too fast to do what have nice services
[1:36:27] for us to shout no for us to finish what
[1:36:30] was started in heaven oh come on now
[1:36:32] somebody reach back to me or you don't
[1:36:35] hear me tonight we have been given a
[1:36:38] responsibility but it turns off
[1:36:40] finishing what was started in heaven
[1:36:43] when Lucifer was kicked out of heaven he
[1:36:47] fell on to our jurisdiction you don't
[1:36:49] hear me tonight he didn't fall into the
[1:36:52] jurisdiction of the Angels he fell into
[1:36:54] our jurisdiction we have every right to
[1:36:58] pick a fight we have every right to pick
[1:37:04] a fight we're not running away we are
[1:37:06] picking a fight this meeting we are
[1:37:08] picking a fight this convention because
[1:37:10] we shall reign on it we can let the
[1:37:13] devil know we are gonna rain on it every
[1:37:16] demon every principality every power is
[1:37:19] on our feet hallelujah not by our might
[1:37:23] not by our power but not by our strength
[1:37:26] but by the resurrected presence of the
[1:37:28] Lord the Son of man was veiled in a son
[1:37:32] of man for repeat of Genesis 18 in this
[1:37:35] very hour son of man walk the earth the
[1:37:38] letter stored is another time coming
[1:37:41] timer life's another seed coming this
[1:37:44] time
[1:37:44] you see like Sarah it'll be in the pride
[1:37:48] but this bride will not even be like
[1:37:50] Sarah she will believe every word the
[1:37:52] world will be in this pride you will
[1:37:54] have to tell her it's anything too hard
[1:37:56] for the Lord she knows all things are
[1:37:59] possible
[1:38:00] she knows the power that locked up in
[1:38:02] the Church of the Living God gives a lot
[1:38:05] of show to praise
[1:38:06] [Applause]
[1:38:10] [Music]
[1:38:11] [Applause]

[1:38:27] have to recognize who you are you have
[1:38:29] to know who you are

[1:38:36] then the wrap is gonna go so the problem
[1:38:39] is not who the devil is who the world is
[1:38:41] the problem is the pride is the only one
[1:38:43] who doesn't know who she is but one day
[1:38:45] she's gonna know who she is she gonna
[1:38:48] wake up one day like Abraham woke up one
[1:38:50] day and he was used to looking in the
[1:38:52] mirror maybe you were to shave and he
[1:38:54] said wait a minute when he gray hair
[1:38:58] gone with Sarah Sarah come see this but

[1:39:12] Sarah was trying to understand the
[1:39:15] mechanics how this thing how this thing
[1:39:20] buddy buddy prophets say you don't need
[1:39:21] to know the mechanics yes in know the
[1:39:23] dynamics the changes coming the power is

[1:39:29] you're gonna talk you're gonna live and
[1:39:31] you're gonna see the Spirit of God yes
[1:39:33] what did offer you kind of church salmon
[1:39:35] could you take some more the
[1:39:38] manifestation of the bride's time of
[1:39:41] life what for not for more church but
[1:39:44] for us to destroy the works of the enemy
[1:39:46] and we're gonna really hood and leave
[1:39:47] this place
[1:39:48] just like enough it's all in Genesis
[1:39:50] that seed book the devil hits it because
[1:39:53] it's in the other Raptors in their power
[1:39:55] is in their body changes in their
[1:39:57] resurrection power is in their
[1:39:59] transformation of young to alter young
[1:40:01] it's all in there hallelujah glory to
[1:40:04] God hallelujah and that seed world is
[1:40:07] alive in our hearts today oh my my my my
[1:40:11] mind Galatians 3:16 he has poured now to
[1:40:16] Abraham and his seed were the promises
[1:40:18] meet he saith not and to seeds plural as
[1:40:22] of many but as of one to thy seed which
[1:40:25] is Christ can the church say Amen
[1:40:28] I'm almost finished in the message
[1:40:30] crisis
[1:40:31] she'll go review but Iran said no court
[1:40:32] had a purpose and a hidden mystery and
[1:40:35] that's what I want to speak unto the
[1:40:36] church this morning the hidden mystery
[1:40:38] of God that he had in his mind before
[1:40:41] the will ever began and how would that
[1:40:43] it's unfolded itself right down to this
[1:40:45] present hour that we're living in then
[1:40:47] you will understand clearly then I
[1:40:49] believe what is being done and here the
[1:40:52] Prophet in question answers before there
[1:40:54] was a world so but a banner goes before
[1:40:56] there was even a world you were in
[1:40:58] courts thoughts to give you the Holy
[1:41:00] Ghost so Abraham was living out a plan
[1:41:03] that he didn't even know when he was
[1:41:04] leaving his house what he was going to
[1:41:06] do but God already saw it all so brother
[1:41:09] Branham could say now before there was a
[1:41:10] world
[1:41:11] you were in court starts to give you the
[1:41:14] Holy Ghost because he know you've been
[1:41:16] wanting it he chose you himself because
[1:41:19] you desired he chose you in Christ
[1:41:22] before you or Jesus any of us on the
[1:41:25] earth and he sent Jesus to die to
[1:41:27] prepare a way to send the Holy Ghost to
[1:41:30] bring you to himself oh this is the
[1:41:33] church so I'm at home now see oh this is
[1:41:35] so rich to me to think it's not what I
[1:41:37] wanted so it's not what Sarah wanted it
[1:41:41] wasn't my desires
[1:41:43] it wasn't my will it wasn't my choosing
[1:41:45] I had not one thing to do with it
[1:41:48] but before the world ever started God's
[1:41:51] sauce and put our name in the Lamb's
[1:41:54] Book of Life before there ever was a
[1:41:56] world can the church see a man in a
[1:42:02] message this day the Scriptures fulfill
[1:42:03] now but in this day there is to come a
[1:42:06] super royal seed of Abraham he's from
[1:42:10] what Noah cannot read semen this is 1965
[1:42:15] are you ready
[1:42:16] we're almost done but now in this day
[1:42:19] there is to come a super royal seed of
[1:42:22] Abraham that's exactly what I'd be what
[1:42:26] it'd be would be a royal bride to the
[1:42:29] royal promised son who is he talking
[1:42:32] about and I spoke last night it wouldn't
[1:42:34] be a natural seed it'll be a spiritual
[1:42:37] seed there is to be a spiritual bride
[1:42:39] raised up which will be the royal seed
[1:42:42] of the royal
[1:42:44] feet of abraham's royal son can I say
[1:42:48] that one more time it'll be the royal
[1:42:51] seed of the royal feet of Abraham royal
[1:42:55] son so he's in this bride wouldn't be by
[1:43:02] her own feet it will be the royal seed
[1:43:10] adulting you catchiness
[1:43:12] will be the royal seed of the royal feet
[1:43:16] of abraham's royal son let me see it
[1:43:22] another way
[1:43:23] it means the feet of this royal son who
[1:43:26] is what were produced his bride so it's
[1:43:35] not even your this is y zero colossal
[1:43:38] get a blessing because it was not based
[1:43:41] on Sierra's feet the fear that was
[1:43:45] required to move this power was not
[1:43:47] trusted at Sara's level so he feared to
[1:43:53] produce this bride is not a bride having
[1:43:55] fear to be bride alone is Jesus having
[1:43:59] faith that he chose you right lady
[1:44:01] it's Jesus having faith that he chose
[1:44:05] the best people for such a time as this
[1:44:08] he has so much faith in his
[1:44:11] foreknowledge he has so much faith in
[1:44:14] his election he has so much sweet and
[1:44:17] predestination
[1:44:19] he knows his bride will never fail you
[1:44:21] know this bride will comfort you know
[1:44:23] this bridal come to maturity listen to
[1:44:28] the Prophet there is to be a spiritual
[1:44:32] bride raised up which will be the royal
[1:44:35] seed of the royal feet of abraham's
[1:44:39] royal seed she is to come on the scene
[1:44:42] in the last days and the time and the
[1:44:46] place is a promise that's given to her
[1:44:49] so there's a time and a place there's a
[1:44:52] time and a season this hour there's a
[1:44:55] location this is
[1:44:56] already mapped out but the Branham is
[1:44:58] speaking he's seeing it and he's telling
[1:45:00] you what he's seeing that your
[1:45:02] appointment had already been written
[1:45:03] when Santa man left and walked away from
[1:45:06] Abraham and Sarah he said I will return
[1:45:08] unto you and the calm down started and
[1:45:10] nothing could stop the condom and when
[1:45:12] this prophet left all these promises to
[1:45:14] us he hid the countdown he left the
[1:45:17] scene knowing fully well that every word
[1:45:19] he spoke was gonna find good ground that
[1:45:22] every word he spoke that's why the
[1:45:24] Prophet said you don't find this message
[1:45:26] this message found you can the church
[1:45:28] say Amen
[1:45:32] but the Branham goes on according to
[1:45:34] Malachi for a scripture there is to rise
[1:45:37] a message that will shake the hearts of
[1:45:41] the people right back to the apostolate
[1:45:43] fathers again hallelujah so friends but
[1:45:49] aberrant income for us to have books and
[1:45:51] tips and CDs and mp3s and tablets and
[1:45:54] have it on software these books and tips

[1:46:01] came along a bridge has to be me the
[1:46:04] connection have to be made this word is
[1:46:06] not gonna remain in the form of books

[1:46:11] this gospel we preach is not in word
[1:46:13] only but it is in power and
[1:46:15] demonstration this message is a
[1:46:17] manifestation and that is why we could
[1:46:20] have a manifestation of the bright time
[1:46:22] of life because in that season every
[1:46:24] seed has to come to life in that season
[1:46:27] every promise has to come to pass in
[1:46:29] that season every word spoken about the
[1:46:32] bride has to be fulfilled in fact God
[1:46:35] Jesus would say heaven and earth will
[1:46:37] pass away this wood is actually higher
[1:46:40] than heaven on earth so you have more
[1:46:42] confidence in this Word of God not even
[1:46:45] in heaven on earth God is willing to see
[1:46:46] heaven and earth will pass away but not
[1:46:49] this wood not this promise not the

[1:50:44] forever poor blind wretched people how
[1:50:47] do you miss that don't you see what a
[1:50:48] greater thing is that's the greatest
[1:50:50] thing could ever happen was to impart
[1:50:53] internal life to people what is he turn
[1:50:55] alive deny that he lived the lighter was
[1:50:58] in him impart that to others
[1:50:59] kind of man do that a son of God can
[1:51:02] Jesus said whosoever since you admit to
[1:51:05] them they are emitted who serve a
[1:51:07] century teen to them they are 18 no
[1:51:10] that's what the reason the day but
[1:51:11] Abraham said we're looking for that
[1:51:13] season are you looking for that season
[1:51:14] now the bride has not a revival yet
[1:51:18] there's been no revival there no
[1:51:21] manifestation of God that stood a bride
[1:51:23] yet see we're looking for it it will
[1:51:25] take those seven unknown thunders back
[1:51:27] there to wake her up again
[1:51:29] he was
[1:51:29] send it he promised it it is a rising of
[1:51:32] the Sun he sit has been churches
[1:51:33] churches Brides bright churches Brides
[1:51:35] rise but it's got to come one hallelujah
[1:51:38] there has to come a real bride there
[1:51:41] must come one that's not only got the
[1:51:43] mechanics but the dynamics of it makes
[1:51:46] that church live move in the power of
[1:51:49] his resurrection and in the fourth seal
[1:51:51] you know it we tell them seven thunders
[1:51:53] uttered their voices to that group who
[1:51:56] could really take the Word of God and
[1:51:57] hand it here in a slice and cut and they
[1:52:00] can close the heavens they can shut this
[1:52:02] or do that whatever they want what is it
[1:52:04] it's power back into adopted sons power
[1:52:07] back into play sons Sons once again in
[1:52:10] their position of power in the time of
[1:52:14] life before the fullness of time when
[1:52:18] time is finished the musician can get
[1:52:21] ready friends we know we are blending
[1:52:25] from time into eternity so this time of
[1:52:29] life has to be for to be before the
[1:52:32] fullness of time because when the
[1:52:35] fullness of time has come then time is
[1:52:36] no more you call that right one of these
[1:52:41] days time will be finished no time left
[1:52:44] no time to do anything left so we are
[1:52:48] talking about a season a time of life
[1:52:51] before the fullness of time but a
[1:52:54] Branham in the future home of the
[1:52:56] heavenly bridegroom and earthy bride
[1:52:57] said and when the fullness of time has
[1:52:59] come
[1:53:00] that's when time has been fulfilled when
[1:53:03] there's no more time then you go into
[1:53:05] eternity after the seven eight is over
[1:53:08] and it is looters it is over Methodist
[1:53:10] ages over Pentecostal it is over and now
[1:53:12] you go into what eternity
[1:53:14] no more sevens no more threes no more
[1:53:17] other there in eternity where there is
[1:53:18] no such thing as numbers and things Amen
[1:53:21] after time has been fulfilled all sin is
[1:53:24] gone taken away at the Millennium at the
[1:53:27] great white throne judgment a type at
[1:53:29] Holy Ghost after the world and fire and
[1:53:31] baptize its baptism of the holy fire for
[1:53:34] heaven all sin is gone
[1:53:36] all germs is gone all devils is gone all
[1:53:39] temptations is gone or evil is gone
[1:53:43] then what does go do we can sit upon the
[1:53:46] earth see because all sin is gone and
[1:53:48] that's the same thing he does when he
[1:53:50] gives you the Holy Ghost baptism and
[1:53:52] fire he can come and dwell with you and
[1:53:54] we can sit in heavenly places in Christ
[1:53:56] Jesus because we are already in him not
[1:53:59] we will be we are now sitting in Christ
[1:54:01] Jesus how do we get into it by one Holy
[1:54:04] Ghost baptism by one Spirit we were all
[1:54:07] baptized into Christ which we are now
[1:54:09] won't be in Christ we are he is the
[1:54:12] great spiritual king over the spirit
[1:54:14] that's in us because we were in him
[1:54:16] after beginning can the church say Amen
[1:54:19] give the Lord a shout of praise the
[1:54:26] fullness of time has come after time has
[1:54:28] been fulfilled sin is gone after the
[1:54:31] world's baptism after the world's
[1:54:33] baptism makes it a fit please no
[1:54:35] sickness no germs no thorns no thistles
[1:54:37] no death no sorrow no heartaches no old
[1:54:40] age nothing to represent death nothing
[1:54:42] wrong alright nothing natural eternal
[1:54:45] friends you can be gonna play something
[1:54:47] softly before the fullness of time
[1:54:50] before time is complete and we blend
[1:54:54] into eternity there has to be a time of
[1:54:56] life and in that time of life it's a
[1:54:59] space of grace friends in that time of
[1:55:01] life is a season of restoration a season
[1:55:04] of deliverance I'm closing out and I'll
[1:55:07] see this I look back at Sampson because
[1:55:12] I believe that we're looking for another
[1:55:13] time in other words once more Lord you
[1:55:16] did it before you can do it again you
[1:55:20] heal before you can heal again you
[1:55:23] deliver before you can deliver again
[1:55:26] [Music]
[1:55:29] listen to Samson he knew that his
[1:55:33] present back slit condition could never
[1:55:35] meet the challenge of an hour yet he was
[1:55:38] just as much man as he ever was in his
[1:55:40] muscles his frame was as big as it ever
[1:55:42] was
[1:55:43] he was just as big a muscle and ever
[1:55:45] could raise up an army but had we got
[1:55:47] better churches better buildings and
[1:55:49] everything but where's our strength
[1:55:52] spiritually speaking he said Samson knew
[1:55:56] that his back sitting condition could
[1:55:58] not meet the challenge of that hour and
[1:55:59] soon as a church nowhere now we can't do
[1:56:03] it under this condition can the church
[1:56:05] say man Oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:56:08] hallelujah
[1:56:10] and Samson saw a possibility we know it
[1:56:14] and I want you to see a possibility that
[1:56:16] in this season in this time of life
[1:56:19] season there's a possibility that you
[1:56:23] can be delivered there's a possibility
[1:56:26] that your son could be restored there's
[1:56:29] a real possibility because there's
[1:56:31] nothing too hard for God and what you
[1:56:32] know hold on to that promise and while
[1:56:37] he thought the Philistines have not
[1:56:39] noticed him while his little boy Lee had
[1:56:42] untied his hands walk back he said lay
[1:56:44] my hands upon the post here's a
[1:56:45] possibility I wish the church could see
[1:56:48] that there's a possibility of a real
[1:56:51] revival what did he do he raised up his
[1:56:53] sockets he had no eyes towards God you
[1:56:56] never noticed the moving of his lips as
[1:56:58] he was sincerely confessing we don't
[1:57:02] just need a little Lord forgive me we
[1:57:04] need a sincere cleaning up they never
[1:57:06] noticed the tears running down from them
[1:57:08] sockets where he once had eyes they
[1:57:12] never noticed the moving of his lips his
[1:57:14] eyes briny tears streaming down from the
[1:57:17] sockets he wanted God to make his word
[1:57:21] once more vindicated to prove Jesus
[1:57:25] Christ the same yesterday today and
[1:57:27] forever once more he thought it would
[1:57:30] happen not a new denomination not a new
[1:57:33] sectarian but a vindicated word from you
[1:57:36] God I know you are still
[1:57:39] I am blind I've got off the track I'm
[1:57:41] not world to live let me die with this
[1:57:44] enemy you raised me up to destroy it and
[1:57:47] I failed you Lord but there's a
[1:57:49] possibility you'd hear me once more Lord
[1:57:52] once more in debt illness he prayed he
[1:57:55] knowed what was coming Lord Justice once
[1:57:59] more once more let me see Jesus Christ
[1:58:01] as he was yesterday when he prayed that
[1:58:04] prayer and the tears rolling from his
[1:58:07] cheeks with deep sincerity of confession
[1:58:10] that's what the church needs in this
[1:58:13] season of grace friends friends many
[1:58:15] will miss it many will miss it because
[1:58:18] in this team message is judgment
[1:58:21] judgment over Sodom judgment in tennis
[1:58:25] is eating the same thing shall I hide
[1:58:27] from Abraham what am I posed to do the
[1:58:30] same time he's hanging on our child is
[1:58:33] the same time I'm gonna judge this world
[1:58:37] [Music]
[1:58:39] hallelujah that's what the church needs
[1:58:43] confess your own don't care what dr.
[1:58:47] Jones says or what anybody else says if
[1:58:49] you're out of the word of God confess it
[1:58:52] that you're on once more Lord once more
[1:58:57] once more Lord once more avenge my
[1:59:00] blindness upon these denominations and
[1:59:02] give me strength Lord to shake these
[1:59:04] denominational world with your
[1:59:05] vindication give me strength Lord once
[1:59:08] more prove it he knew what was gonna
[1:59:11] happen if his prayer was answered do you
[1:59:13] know this evening what will happen if
[1:59:14] your prayer gets Hansard he knew dead in
[1:59:17] his crying once more Lord and while he
[1:59:20] was praying making his honest confession
[1:59:23] every fiber in his body began to vibrate
[1:59:26] Oh God if the body of Jesus Christ could
[1:59:30] stand as one and every fiber you send to
[1:59:33] your feet and every member begin to
[1:59:36] vibrate with a literal baptism of the
[1:59:38] Holy Ghost again not with new members
[1:59:40] and shaking hands and some creed and as
[1:59:43] a strength begin to move into those big
[1:59:46] muscles every fiber began to twist he
[1:59:49] began to feel himself again and
[1:59:51] twisted and when he did the big wall
[1:59:53] fell all we need today is to see those
[1:59:56] denominational walls fall is to get real
[1:59:58] deep sincere or Pentecost and to oppose
[2:00:03] repent and cry O Lord God once more you
[2:00:07] had better destroy your enemy before
[2:00:09] your enemy destroy you
[2:00:11] that's right bring back the old
[2:00:12] fashioned primitives the real godly
[2:00:15] repentance
[2:00:16] the all-night altar service or Pentecost
[2:00:19] hear me leave this corruption that
[2:00:22] Jezebel has worked among you leave it
[2:00:24] leave it quickly
[2:00:26] leave it today turn with your whole
[2:00:28] heart back to the Word of God turn back
[2:00:31] to the power of the Holy Ghost you woman
[2:00:34] dressed like woman you men act like men
[2:00:37] like sons and daughters of God oh come
[2:00:41] on now it's not about having Church it's
[2:00:44] about transformation
[2:00:46] it's about getting into position it's
[2:00:48] about separating yourself from all
[2:00:50] unbelief can the church say man he was
[2:00:53] aware of what would happen if God
[2:00:56] answered his prayer
[2:00:57] oh my but Abraham said if the church can
[2:01:01] only get in that condition if you are
[2:01:03] ready right now if you are sincere if
[2:01:07] you really mean business if your eyes
[2:01:09] are open to what I'm trying to tell you
[2:01:12] in a roundabout way if you're sincere
[2:01:14] and say Lord I don't care what it is I'm
[2:01:17] ready are you ready to settle how you
[2:01:19] feel are you ready to let go everything
[2:01:21] are you ready to surrender all
[2:01:24] are you a to surrender your thinking
[2:01:25] your ideas how it should be what should
[2:01:29] happen I ready let it all go and say
[2:01:31] Lord once more Lord once more Lord then
[2:01:35] Samson cried out Lord it poked my eyes
[2:01:37] out I know that you are God I know that
[2:01:40] you have the power to do it I know you
[2:01:42] can set me free from these fetters just
[2:01:44] once more Lord just once more just once
[2:01:47] more Lord just once more let there be a
[2:01:49] cup meeting on the side of a hill like
