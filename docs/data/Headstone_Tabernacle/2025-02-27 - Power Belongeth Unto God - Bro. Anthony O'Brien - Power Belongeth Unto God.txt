I'd like to greet you in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen it's an opportunity to be here it's a blessing to be here tonight amen so we have two portion of scriptures we'd like to read thank you so much uh brother Steven oliv for the music tonight certainly appreciate that um so we have two portion of scriptures we'd like to read from firstly from Psalms Psalms chapter 62 I wanted to read verse 11 in there and then we wanted to get uh head over to Colossians 1 uh and to read verse 16 and 17 for our scripture reading tonight amen praise God Amen wonderful so reading from Psalm chapter 62 for verse 11 11 says God hath spoken once and twice have I heard this that that power belongeth unto God Amen and reading from Colossians 1 verse6 uh says for by him were all things created that are in heaven that are in Earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or Powers all things were created by Him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist may God have blessing to the reading of his word let's just bow our heads now as we want to pray amen almighty God we certainly deem it a privilege to be in your house tonight Lord Lord and despite Lord the traffic jam and everything coming here tonight Lord It's a privilege to be in your house tonight father Lord there's no other place you rather be Lord Lord we see the world going into its thing Lord into its celebration into its atmosphere but Lord we are caught up in the atmosphere of you tonight Lord we caught up in your anointing your presence your spirit Lord we want to hear from you tonight father Lord we Just Surrender Our Lives father to you now Lord and just for a few moments as we talk around your word may your presence come down in a special way and minister to our hearts Lord anoint us and Inspire us Lord and just uh wrap us in your presence father Lord we want to be caught up in the in the awesomeness of you tonight Lord in the spirit of the coming of the Lord father where everything else Fades away Lord and we just see you coming plainly into view father granted almighty God lord may take hold of the word now for a few moments any man can read the scripture Lord may your spirit come and minister to our hearts tonight in a special way and uh we'll be careful to give you all the praise honor and Glory uh for this in Jesus Christ's precious name amen and amen you may have your seats thank you praise God praise God BR sha still not getting a signal on the monitors uh I think they may not be on at all at this point um but anyway praise God well God bless you and uh it's good to be here one more time amen are you happy to in his presence tonight hallelujah praise God oh okay yeah that's that's good amen okay good amen all right just get settled in here amen so we have a title tonight the title uh for this little inspiration tonight is power belongeth unto God power belongeth unto God I love that scripture there Psalm 62 which we just read says God ha spoken once and twice have I heard this that power belongeth unto God amen amen praise God so may he speak it to us tonight again the second time amen amen so that we really get it because we don't get it until we get it amen but uh so the Genesis of our little thought here tonight is that God is all powerful all power belongs unto God he's all powerful all power belongs to him tonight uh we don't have any power within ourselves anything that is given to us it comes from the Lord comes from God any power that is given is given by God hallelujah isn't that right he is omnipotent which means that he is all powerful he is the all powerful God he is the everpresent god he is there when you need him and he can get you out of any trouble or any circumstance that you're in that you might find yourself tonight God has the power tonight to do something about your situation Hallelujah when you run out of power he's just getting started because he is all powerful isn't that right he has the power to do whatever he wants to do whatever he desires to do that he will do because he is all powerful isn't that right as the scripture says he is before all things uh before there was anything else there was God so that anything that exists was created by this all powerful God he he literally made it he spoke it he created it into existence um and just by that alone he is all powerful isn't that right everything we see around us was created by God himself amen so so uh before he was before all things by him all things consist and in other words there's nothing that exists that God doesn't know about and more than that he just doesn't know about it it's just that he just doesn't know about it but he has power over it tonight amen and amen do you believe that tonight he knows about everything and he doesn't just know about it but he has the power to do something about it he knows about every situation he knows every time a fly bats his eye he he knows how much number of the hairs are on your head tonight he knows what every situation is every how much billions of millions of people on the Earth right now just think about it he knows about every single one tonight and more than that he can do something about it he has power over every single one he can raise up kingdoms he could bring down kingdoms the same God that released Joseph into Egypt to bless Egypt and to make Egypt Prosper for 14 years prophecy of Famine of of for seven years of plenty and seven years of famine the same God that released Joseph into Egypt was the same God that reliefed Moses into that same Egypt to judge ebit and bring it down and to say Let My People Go isn't that right the same God that raised them up is the same God that could bring them down because he is all powerful oh Hallelujah whatever he wants to do he could do it tonight amen amen hallelujah isn't that right hallelujah hallelujah all power belongs to God there's no power on Earth that we know of uh that is higher than the power of God tonight isn't that right amen uh and the Bible says that God is light isn't that right and in him there is no Darkness at all isn't that right as 1 John 5 said and then then this then is the message which ye have heard of him and declare unto you that God is light and in him is no Darkness at all and if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and we do not the truth because there's light and there's Darkness there is a differentiation between the two light cannot exist where darkness is oh God draw a line in the beginning when he spoke let there be light he separated light from Darkness therefore light and darkness cannot coexist in the same space Oh when light comes in darkness knows where to go Darkness has to push back oh hallelujah hallelujah Hal when God comes into a situation Darkness has to know where to go oh Darkness cannot sit around and cross his legs and act like nothing is going on no the situation is different God is now in the building when God is in the building oh now the impossible can be made possible now something can happen that never happened before go isn't that right Mary told Jesus said if my brother was here if if you were here my brother would not have died but even so you are able to do something tonight oh she knew that if Jesus was in the building her brother would not have died because wherever Jesus goes the sick cannot stay sick wherever Jesus goes the dead cannot stay dead wherever Jesus goes the blind cannot stay blind oh Hallelujah if you would have been here my brother would not have died if he is here tonight something's got to happen you can't be in the presence of Jesus and you remain the same way or wherever Jesus goes change is happening wherever Jesus goes he interrupts the atmosphere he interrupts the radio waves he jams the signals of the enemy he jams the signals of Lucifer the devil is pound oh wherever light goes the darkness is pound oh but the light that has come in and there is a light on the earth tonight that light is here to rescue you from Darkness to pluck your soul out of loud deia that light has sh oh upon planted seed tonight to bring forth a harvest in the last day oh do you believe it tonight glory to God hallelujah hallelujah oh in God is light there is no darkness in him that scripture continues and says if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth if we walk in the light as he is in the light then we have Fellowship one with another we can't hardly say we in the light and not be able to shake hands with one another that's not light that's Darkness you got to be able to shake your brother's hand you've got to be able to say I forgive you you've got to be able to make it right you've got to be able to meet on common ground and the blood of Jesus Christ puts us all on Common Ground tonight because the same blood for me is the same blood for you tonight and if God died for me if Jesus died for me oh then what about you here tonight oh he died for you too oh that means I ought to love you with the same love that he love me with an unconditional love a love that goes past your circumstance past what you was past what you did saw beyond your faults and saw your needs oh and loved you Hallelujah Des spite of everything else he loved you without a reason to love you he just loves you and how the bride tonight ought to love with that same kind of love because when the spirit of God comes upon her she's going to be just like Jesus she's going to be able to love just like Jesus she's going to be able to forgive just like Jesus she's going to be able to walk in that newness of life just like Jesus amen Hal Hallelujah isn't that right oh flesh of his flesh bone of his bone Spirit of his spirit in the likeness of God uh is what we are predestined to come into that kind of a condition isn't that right amen amen hallelujah glory to God oh my that's wonderful all right so we say if we walk in the light as we in the light we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses us from all sin and if we say we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us oh Hallelujah we couldn't save ourselves oh we were born in sin shap in iniquity come in the world speaking Lies We have to acknowledge each and every one of us that Christ's blood atonement was for us to save us out of sin amen amen to not confess This Is A Lie isn't that right oh my so if we say you have not sined we make a M isn't that right okay so God is a Creator isn't that right because he is he has the power to create but brandham said he also has the power to heal it just makes sense because he he's the one who manufactured the human body in the first place uh he knows everything that's wrong with it and if he created it the first time then he can fix what's wrong with the body he knows everything that's he's the Creator isn't is that right he's the author of The Thing of this big machine called the human body that to this day science are still baffled by how the human body has the ability to heal itself and to and to and to and to and to do things that that seem like science still trying to figure that out uh but that the Genesis of that the origin of Life comes from God it's a mystery that they can't crack Hallelujah but it's not for them to figure out it's for them to believe oh oh Hallelujah if now can believe all things are possible tonight the same God that spoke man from the dust of the earth and breathe breath into man and made man a living soul is the same God that can heal that man tonight of every disease of every sickness of every situation it's the same God that can minister to you oh hallelujah hallelujah man end up in a fallen condition but he hasn't fallen so far that God cannot save him has never fallen that far that God cannot reach him because God is all powerful tonight he is omnipotent there's nowhere he doesn't know about there's nothing he doesn't know about there's no one he cannot see oh H he can see all he knows all and he has power over everything tonight oh he has power in your circumstance power over your situation whatever you have need of tonight he has power to heal your sickness power to deliver you power to break the chains power to deliver power to restore power to cure from mental illness from emotional or whatever it is God has the ability tonight he is all powerful oh hallelujah hallelujah the word of God would have you to know that oh Hallelujah [Music] amen hallelujah the devil would have us to not believe that tonight but we believe the word tonight he is a Creator and he has the power to create isn't that right therefore he has the power to heal amen it just comes with the portfolio amen isn't that right it's a subdivision of the portfolio of creation isn't that right amen amen I like to think of it like a like a phone there are certain aspects of a smartphone that we know nothing about we just use it on the surface level some of us use it to make phone calls some of us have become familiar with WhatsApp uh some of us are more familiar with social media platforms and maybe they use your phone for a camera some people use it for a calculator some people use it for a notepad there are many uses of a phone but there are certain hidden features inside of a phone that you will not know about those stuff is what they call manufacturer Developers stuff that that that's deep knowledge of the of of the smartphone there's some stuff that the manufacturer put in the phone that you may scarcely know about uh but if ever the need arises for them to maybe restore your phone or to bring it back to factory settings there's a place that you could do that you you may not know about that off hand you might have to research that or look it up but somewhere along making that phone the developer the manufacturer put certain Safeguard settings in that phone so that if anything could go wrong he could reset that phone back to its manufacturer condition or he can go in and find things that you wouldn't normally find there are codes that you could punch in to your regular phone uh function and have access to other parts of your phone you could test the vibrator you could test your screen brightness you can test the RGB settings there are many things that are hidden in a phone where God knows about us tonight because he is our manufacturer and God has a way to get to us tonight when the world bathes you over with doubt bathes you over with fear f up your device with all kinds of stuff and you feel all Heavenly Laden when you come to the manufacturer the manufacturer is a way of getting down into the settings and tuning you in such a way oh that you could he could offload stuff off of you that you didn't think was possible he is doing stuff that normal people cannot do because he's the one that made it in the beginning and if he created us and not we ourselves that we are his people and we are the Sheep of his pasture oh then tonight enter into his gates with Thanksgiving and enter his courts with praise tonight and be thankful and bless his name because he is able to do EX lead inly abundantly above all we could ask or think hallu he knows every single part of you tonight and he knows exactly how to fix it he's all knowing and he's all powerful isn't now God glorious tonight amen amen amen and I like to think of faith faith is like a hack to your operating system CU Anytime God want to get to you he don't come through your five senses he come through a different way the devil attack your five senses he come through your sight he come through your hairing he come through your your taste your touch Hallelujah but God have a different operating way of getting to you oh that them that the other people don't know about because he's the manufacturer he's the developer and Faith have a way of bypassing your human senses bypassing your thoughts bypassing your intellect bypassing how you feel bypassing what you think faith have a way of hacking your routes and getting straight to the device and powering you up oh all of a sudden you on fire and you don't know how you're unexp expectation and you don't know how that's fate doing something for you that's the manufacturer that's the developer working his stuff oh Hallelujah and in every age he found a way to get to the predestinated oh he bypass your learned he bypass your thoughts he bypass your flesh he bypass all your fear oh and he hacked that whole thing and went straight down into your heart and dropped the word of God in there and tell the devil do what you want to them but they're going to come through anyhow come through Waters come through flood come through Peril come through storm but faith in your soul make you stand up in a most unearthly Way You Are standing somehow amidst it all you are standing Faith makes you do that that's the developers options that's the manufacturer's uh special technique of how to find his people throughout all the ages he's been able to do that amen because he is the Creator and he knows about what he has created everything serves a purpose everything is for a time isn't that right oh my so but Braham said he also has the power to heal he said many times I'm not the Healer isn't that right 1953 by uh brother Bram said here on faith without works is dead he says where's that man at at somebody here that somebody here he's talking about he's having a healing after the service and he's asking where's the man at and he said here it is this man under cut he said now do you believe me to be God's servant look over this way a minute young man he said I couldn't heal you I know nothing about you but God uh God knows that he said but your life is in the hands of God he said you believe me to be his servant he said your wife sitting there by you or she's she's not your wife she's your sweetheart he said and your suffering with leukemia God is now revealing to him this this man is not saying anything now he God uh God is revealing to the prophet what's wrong with him says you're suffering leukemia cancer of the bloodstream Prophet said you're going to die if you lay there and the doctor can do no more for you you've only got one opportunity and that is the Blessed promise of the Lord Jesus Christ the people that pull you over here in this place tonight after they brought you in they put you here they pulled you over here a purposefully thinking that you'd lay there and they ask you to believe he said and if you you believe that the spirit of God would pull me to you he said is that the truth he said all right he said Do you believe me to be his servant he said do you accept Jesus Christ as your healer he said you do now he said do you forsake everything and accept him as your healer he said then in the name of Jesus Christ stand up he said in the name of Jesus Christ Hallelujah and then he calls brother Osborne because he beginning to stand now amen the man was healed isn't that right praise God isn't all right Hallelujah he said I don't have the power to heal but do you believe that he could do it if there's a man in here who can do it oh Hallelujah glory to God Amen the prophet never one time claimed he could heal anybody he said I'm just his servant whatever you reveal to me that is what I'll say to you to increase your faith to believe that God could do something for you tonight oh Hallelujah and the word is here tonight to increase your faith for you to believe that God is able to do something for you tonight God could heal you God could deliver you God can restore you God can fix your situation God could do anything tonight because he is all powerful there's nothing he can't do oh and the devil run his run and try to do what he could do and throw destruction and weapons and sword oh hallelujah hallelujah God has the ability to fend off the works of the enemy to cast off the works of darkness oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah no weapon that is formed against you shall ever Prosper oh because God is a mighty conqueror he's a mighty Soldier he knows no retreat he knows no surrender oh he's the captain of our salvation and he doesn't take no foreign answer there's no soul he can save there's no chain he can't break tonight oh Hallelujah he's broken chains before and he will do it again he's healed the sick before and he can do it again he's caused the blind to see and he can do it again oh Hallelujah Revival has broken out in times past and we believe tonight that the all powerful God can do it again he can revive again he can restore again he can heal again he can fill with the baptism of the Holy Ghost the same one that Peter receive you could receive that same Holy Ghost tonight it's the same God doing the same things just like he did back there he'll do the same things in this Modern Age and they still w't be able to figure it out because no matter how much Science and Technology happens and takes place Hallelujah God is still God tonight and he's still a Healer and he's still a deliverer and he's still a way maker not enough Elon musks can figure out how God could do his stuff oh they can't replace God oh they can't get rid of him he is all powerful he is above all things he is above president Trump he's above Putin he's above hallelujah jingping or whoever praise God Amen he's above every principality above every Power above the rulers of the darkness of this world above the spiritual wickedness that is moving in high places he is above all that oh oh Hallelujah the Earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof oh Hallelujah hallu glory glory to God there's nothing he can do oh God our eyes are on you tonight our heart is fixed on the god of Ages the god that has answered by fire God has answered by storm by by Power by shaking of Earth by wind oh Hallelujah he's the god that walks upon the wings of the wind oh Hal's the master of every circumstance oh Hallelujah God could build boats he told Noah Build me an ark one time I'll give you the specifications and you build it and was perfectly done amen amen as long as you follow the rules you'll be all right amen amen amen praise God as long as you do what he said do Prophet said said I'll meet you in the morning amen isn't that right oh my so there's a power of God and there's also the power of darkness which is a power in itself but it only exists when there's no light isn't that right because light and darkness can't live in the same space when light comes in darkness has to push back therefore the devil is and Satan is of the darkness isn't that right darkness is the absent of light when there is no light there then Darkness takes over we don't really measure Darkness there's no one walking around the instrument saying it's it's 10% dark or 20% dark uh we measure how much light there is in a room but scarcely do we ever think of measuring the darkness the darkness is only there because there is no light Hallelujah and Satan is only running around uh running around parad himself on this world because the sons of God are out of their position that is why the dark has pervaded and and taken over the world taken over the religious realm taken over the political realm taken over this realm and that realm and education and Science and politics and he's just running a mock because there he's running around unchecked because the sons of God are yet to take up their rightful place in the position that God had for them to be in since the beginning of time oh how about we believe tonight that there is another people in the land who under their Miss Messenger will be the final voice to the final age and they are going to take up their position in the word of God as Sons and Daughters of the Living God and they are going to challenge the enemy challenge every Power challenge every Spirit challenge every ruler of Darkness challenge every spiritual wickedness challenge every sickness every disease every doubt every fear they're going to march on top of sickness they're going to march on top of fear John said we shall rain on the earth when he saw the Lamb of God step out and took the book he began to shout and jump why cuz positional power placing was coming back into position and the world was going to come back into position don't you know all creation is groaning and travailing and burdening and burning and crying and screaming waiting for the sons of God to come back into position oh nature is having a prayer meeting going back and forth Lord send your sons Lord wake up your daughters tonight Lord get them on fire if you're not on fire nature is groaning and travailing somebody got a groan somebody got a pray Jesus told the pH SE one time if these people don't worship me even the rocks are going to cry out oh are that Messiah is on the earth now there's got to be a people on the land tonight who recognize the Messiah is here and that seed in their soul is speaking back so as we would see Jesus we shall see the King when he comes isn't that right oh my my my my glory when God comes in his presence comes in then what happens the enemy comes P becomes powerless cuz light is in the room and it blinds the darkness there are some animals who cannot operate in such light they get blinded by it cockroaches looking for a dark space as soon as light come in they they run and hide because they can't they can't deal with that bats cannot deal with that there certain animals that just cannot exist they can't they can't function praise God when the light comes in oh Hallelujah and there are demons that cannot function when the light comes in there are spirits that begin to get agitated when light comes in the room and when you walk in the room and God's light is following you then there are spirits that become agitated because a Son of God just walked in the room oh they begin to get weary they begin to get ansy throw us in the pigs throw us in the pigs how do you come to torment us before time oh H they know hallu Hallelujah more than a thousand of the theologians that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen isn't that right praise God Amen imagine that they told them to us into the pigs they knew that at Jesus's word they had to do whatever they had to do so they told him they told him what word to give them because they know the authority was in his signature whatever Jesus said is what they will do so they said here's what we want you to fill out your application ahead of time throw us in the pigs is where you want us to go sign off on that praise God so we can go because we can't go if you are here we are bound we are stuck where we are unless you give the word oh Hallelujah Hal and Jesus give them a praise God he signed the form he said go into the pigs and they went straight away H every one of them isn't that right oh my Legion of devils my it's coming back to that time where sons of God will have so much Authority so much power when they come down off that adoption Mountain pray the season will change and then speak to whatever you ask is will we is what will be granted that's the age that we live moving into now it's an adoption age oh no wonder the world is getting more and more filthy no wonder the world is getting more and more in a condition no wonder everything is happening so so rapidly because manifestation is about to take place there's there's a birth that's about to take place so all the signs and symptoms are to going to become more and more rapid more and more painful oh Hal because sons of God are about to be Burt oh Hallelujah about to come forth are about to be born into a manifestation oh Hal of God on the earth oh hallelujah hallelujah and when Christ is being formed you watch the world go on a rampage watch trouble start on every hand watch The Devil go on a rampage when Christ is being formed in you oh so thinking not strange concerning the fiery trial that you are going through tonight oh hallelujah hallelujah God is getting ready to move we believe it with all our hearts isn't that right oh my let me hurry along here now so we got that right where light is Darkness fleas amen isn't that right in the beginning the word was without form and void Darkness upon the Earth God spoke and said let there be light and he addressed the darkness by speaking the light he said let there be light he didn't try to argue with the darkness pull the darkness fight to the darkness no he had no communion with the darkness because in him is no Darkness so his way of dealing with darkness is speaking light oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God amen hallelujah amen amen and so today we can address the darkness tonight by speaking light oh by speaking Life by speaking the word of God don't get caught up in the negative don't get caught up in what the devil say and what the doctors say speak light say I am the Lord that Health thee out of all that diseases oh Hallelujah I am your deliverer I am your healer I believe on you Lord you are able to defeat the darkness you are able to heal the sick I know oh even now Lord you could do something oh hallelujah oh glory to God amen amen hallelujah hallelujah speak the light and watch your Darkness flee amen take that to work with you tomorrow amen speak light into your situation Speak Life into the darkness and watch it change isn't that right praise God I heard a preacher say one time he said God turns the when you begin to pray then the tide of The Battle Turns then the tides turn when you begin to pray when you begin to call on God when you begin to release from your mouth your faith and desire for what you want then God begin to move on that Fai because faith is a currency for God to move in your situation and when you begin to release that unto God then the tide of the battle begins to turn oh Hal because you begin to recognize the power of of prayer and what you can do about it oh Hallelujah hallelu because he is all powerful we are not trying to do it in ourselves we know that there's a God that can do it that can do more than we could ever do when we pray and when we call upon him isn't that right amen praise God so the power of light is more powerful isn't that right than the power of Darkness Satan's power isn't really a power at all it's a perversion of the original but Bram said that isn't that right a li is a truth Mist told isn't that right so the whole thing see see so he just perverts what is already there but he cannot create amen isn't that right so his his appearance of power is just what he's able to twist and warp praise God Amen isn't that right so he told Eve you shall not surely die he twist the word and then it became a dark power praise God because it was a misrepresented word that swed a a seed of misrepresentation and threw the whole thing down that's his power his power is just taking what is already there and warping it and bending it into his evil purpose into his evil intent but if it ever comes back on track if if it ever gets restored back into position then the devil is powerless oh Hallelujah that's why our job tonight is to get back into position is to get back into alignment with the word of God if we could ever get back oh Hallelujah to where we were where were you when the sons of God shout it for Joy when the morning Stars sign together if if you could ever get into alignment with the word of God for your day the devil will be powerless before you oh hallelujah amen amen amen glory to God Amen so that's where we want to be tonight by the grace of godall Amen okay it's the gospel truth isn't that all right all right so he said uh but said let me tell you don't refuse the light of uh light of Gospel of Jesus Christ it brings a warm raise of the Holy Ghost upon you makes a new creature in Christ Jesus don't try to walk in the glare of some other age now that glare might have been all right in another age but it might be all right for them see now the Jews thought that they were worshiping the True Light they thought that they were worshiping the same God that they were turning down the very one that they thought they were worshiping they were crucifying they were making fun of the very God and making him a laughing stock of the people at the very God that they thought that they were worshiping isn't that something oh they thought they worshiping the god of their fathers and here he was in the form of Christ being uh tormented crucified rejected oh wow what a condition he said may I say this with reverence and respect but to bring light he said because as our brother said a while ago we're living later than you think we are he said in one of these days something is going to happen it's going to be too late the people will take the mark of the beast not knowing what they are doing thinking that they worship sh shipping God or doing them a service isn't that right oh my not even knowing what they're doing blind leading the blind and they'll all fall in the ditch see Jesus said we're living later than we think he said many honest people follow that not even knowing what they're doing he said see uh but the hour is at hand now when the light is shining this Gospel Light he said and in its power of the resurrection of Jesus Christ he said and it's manifesting himself that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he lotted that for this day and the things that he promise for this day must happen in this day he said and if the church don't accept it then God is able of these stones to raise children unto Abraham he will get his message over one way or another that there'll be a people elected to find that message amen oh I'm so glad we found it tonight praise God hallelujah hallelujah he will get his message over because he's always done it he'll always do it isn't that right Prophet said here and hear him he said if Satan can heal God told God told something wrong he said Jesus said Satan cannot heal uh uh to be a Healer he'd have to be a Creator if he's a Creator then he's God see so that that whole theology won't work see Satan can't create he he perverts what God has created he is not a Creator he's a pervert he said righteous he said what is sin righteous is perverted correctly now let us be Reverend for a moment he said if you will only believe isn't that right oh my so something I want to get to here before we close out so when God created the Earth there was actually a vacancy position he created the moon he created the Stars he created the Sun the animals the planets everything working perfectly and just before he went off on his rest on the seventh day there was one more project God needed to take care of because he had created a whole domain now he had created a whole Earthly realm and even though he was God over all he needed somebody to manage and run this thing called Earth isn't that right he needed somebody to run this domain uh uh on Earth on Earthly matters praise God so what did he do he created man isn't that right isn't that right he said uh so so he created a being called man to rule over this Earthly realm yes amen it was a vacancy it was a it was a it was a job position that needed to be fulfilled uh uh uh and there was no nobody really worthy to take the application because monkeys couldn't do it the the elephants and the horses and they all that that stuff going on so God had to make somebody that he could uh put in charge of this of this earth and the world and look at the the criteria now here he said that this being was called man uh God made man in the beginning gave him the job description right so Genesis 1:26 he said and God said let us make man how in our own image and after our own likeness oh so that is the prerequisite if you are to rule over this Earth You have to be in His image and you have to be in his likeness God is not going to let anybody Hallelujah Rule and Reign Over this Earth unless he fits the criteria for the job description he's got to pass the test oh he's got to be in God's image and he's to be in God's likeness oh hallelujah hallelujah so God is all powerful but he has the ability to give power but he only giv power if you meet this criteria here tonight and that's where the seven tunders come in because those seven tunders is a Life of Christ to put back in us what Adam had to fit the criteria oh hallelujah hallelujah they they see it now so the vacancy the position has to be filled now because this man who was created an image and likeness of God and then look at the job description he said and let that man have dominion this is the job description now this is the the domain that he is going in charge of so he matches the description he has a likeness and image and now this is what he will do he has dominion over the fish of the sea and over the foul of the air and over the cattle and over all of the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth this man Hallelujah has dominion over all of it aen amen amen amen amen glory amen glory so God is very Thor Amen in his description the job comes with perks and everything else it's all in the in the sign amen is that right but this man fell from that position as we know uh when the devil come and introduce sin and so forth like Now isn't that right and then Eve fell and then she gave the fruit to Adam and he fell then we end up with a vacancy now a vacancy position that needs to be filled praise God but we need to find somebody worthy to take up the position oh Hal isn't that right praise God and since Adam many prophets many likenesses have come David and Joseph and Jacob oh many great men had walked the Earth but none like Hallelujah back there when they had an image and likeness of God they they come very close they seem very glorious but they all had shortcomings they all had failings they all had struggles they all come very close but they couldn't quite meet the job description oh until there come one oh that was born sinless oh Hallelujah who was virgin born oh Hallelujah isn't that right oh and the angel appeared to Mary and see you are blessed and highly favored for you will bring forth a son a child and his name will be called Jesus oh and when Jesus was born here was the first one since thousands of years of time he was the first man to walk the earth that it was possible that he could meet this job description it was possible that he could fill this vacancy oh but he had to be tested he had to be tried he had to be proven he went through 18 years of silent oh he went through three and a half years harder trials oh Hallelujah try this way try that way isn't that right the phes pointed fingers the Sadducees pointed fingers oh but they couldn't find fault with him oh even P appeared before pilot just before his his his res uh his death his crucifixion isn't that right and pilate asked are you the king of the Jews Hallelujah who are you are you the king as they say and Jesus had to put him in his place and say my father put you where you are and he put me where I am so don't you worry about it oh Hallelujah Hal my father has power over everything Jesus knew that he was ruler over all yet he humbled himself or to fulfill all righteousness he humbled himself to the cross and was slaughtered and was killed and was crucified so that his blood could be released oh Hal hallelujah hallelujah why so that more Sons like Jesus could come forth because unless a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it would abide alone but when it die it bringeth forth much fruits and that perfect seed that sinless seed went down into the ground oh on crucifixion day oh he died didn't he die but when on Easter morning he Rose from the grave oh and he was Victorious and he had all power oh over the grave over death over hell over sickness over disease he rose up a mighty conqueror oh Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah do you believe it tonight amen amen amen oh I'm almost finished praise God when God made Spirit man in the beginning he gave that man dominion over the fall of the air over the birds of the sea give him an authority the spirit in the beginning was perfect no sin no unbelief it was a triumphant Spirit an overcoming Spirit a spirit that had a seven part nature Faith to charity and God told them to be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth that was Spirit man and after that he made flesh man and man fell and flesh man and subject to sin and so forth isn't that right but God promised to restore that image that he had isn't that right so every Prophet that came Abraham Isaac Jacob were only shadows and types of that perfect one that was to come to manifest Perfection but finally here he come the Conqueror Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever that spirit that dwelt in Christ brother brand said that God emptied himself into Christ all that God was his power his presence he said when you see me you see the father that was God failed oh when he was here on Earth he had Dominion do you believe that he exercised his power Christ come into Dominion by obedience it was lost by Adam through Disobedience but Christ come into Dominion by obedience to the things that he suffered isn't that right Christ demonstrated dominion over the animal kingdom over the bees over the birds over the fish over Human family ham sham japet and so forth isn't that right over the elements of nature he could stop the wind isn't that right the Seas roaring he demonstrated your Dominion he actually was an example seed son and he was on the earth demonstrating your Dominion the Dominion that you were supposed to have had you come in the image and likeness of God since the beginning isn't that right but you know we come into sin and so forth like that so Christ redeemed it all by displaying it all and showing it all what it was Hallelujah and then in his death it was to bring forth the life that was to create more Sons to demonstrate it all to do the Greater Works to heal the sick to raise the dead to cast out Devils no wonder brother Brandon is on Earth Hallelujah pray he spoke little fishy I give you your life no wonder when he was here he demonstrated those things because it wasn't a son it wasn't uh uh brother brandham doing it but it was the son of man veiled in brother Branham speaking the word showing himself again just like he did when he was here on Earth having dominion over all things isn't that right oh my my sees Roy and whatnot he had dominion over the spirit realm that's related to man over Angels over demon Spirits he had Dominion to cast out Devils isn't that right he had dominion over the human mind itself St Luke 4 it is written it is written over life what lust of the eyes lust of the flesh pride of life isn't that right he exercised dominion over everything he said the adopted son must have power over himself before he can have power over others and other things amen isn't that right brother Bram said so they tried to kill him Jesus said destroy this body and in three days I'll raise it up myself he said that was God veiled I said and when he died that Spirit went down into hell took the keys of death and hell and then he loosed the prisoners and on Easter morning he raised from the dead just as sure as he would all the devil couldn't stop him and if that same Spirit ever dwelt in another human being it would do the exact same thing oh just like he conquered on Easter morning there'll be an Easter for the bride and she'll conquer just like he conquered she'll heal the sick she will raise the dead Greater Works than these shall you do because I go unto my father isn't that right Jesus said so when he was here on Earth he demonstrated all that Dominion see when brother Bram here was on Earth he demonstrated that same Dominion sun come out and shine little fishy isn't that right let be squirrels says the hatti right I give you your two sons spoken with salvation oh Hallelujah before the doctor's hand touches my wife the tumor will go down because you have challenged the spirit of God you shall fall over my feet he demonstrated dominion over every Spirit over every sickness over every tumor praise over Maniac Spirits he demonstrated it oh killable the bees everything else isn't that right he demonstrated dominion and that same Jesus veiling a prophet God hiding himself in Simplicity and revealing himself in the same and that same Jesus tonight will be veiling the bride oh hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right oh Hallelujah the prophet said here Lord Jesus the lovely one heal all these sick and needy here tonight Lord you begin to uh uh come forward brother Steven ol amen amen we know that I uh uh uh come and seal the sick and need tonight here Lord here's a brother brand I'm praying he said we give you praise we know that you are here we know that thy spirit is near to bless and to heal all that is needy now may the people Lord that's standing here except me knowing that my strength is gone but Lord you are here and now as your servant I take dominion over every unclean spirit that is in this building he says and I say to Satan you are a loser God has sent Christ and he has won the Victory and I charge thee by Jesus Christ the son of God come out of the people leave them and go from them in Jesus name oh Hallelujah that's brother Bram amen praying praying in Authority praying in Dominion isn't that right oh my hallelujah praise God so St John one he was in the world the world was made by him and the world knew him not he came unto his own and and his own receive him not but as many as receive him to them he gave power to become the sons of God even them that call upon his name isn't that right amen amen amen second Corinthians C says we 2ans 3 rather says but we all with open face beholding as in the glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image image of Jesus Christ isn't that right Hallelujah but from glory to glory even as by the spirit word of the Lord oh you can begin to play something softly he said notice notice let's drop back now time's gone but I want to get something to you Peter got all excited the supernatural had been done there stood Moses and Elijah they'd been dead for years but here they were standing alive with there with Jesus talking about M Mount Transfiguration Witnesses two of the mightiest prophets That Ever Walked the Earth standing by the side of God to watch uh God adopt his own son to give and give him all powers in Heaven and Earth given into his hands brother Ram said he will do for you the same if you will stand after you receive the Holy Ghost and make yourself a Christian and act like a Christian should if you will ever put your face in God's word and your eyes towards heaven and let your pan legs be bagged at the knees be reverent before God he said there'll be someday that God will take you over to a side one where and and give you a power and a gift that the whole world will know that he's been with you he said that's the placing of a son in his position oh Hallelujah he says oh you br this understand he said oh I feel religious right now yes sir he will do it he promised it he's the unfailing god oh where the church has missed it by saying well spoken in tongues and so forth he said but you've just got started for sure isn't that right he amen and amen oh hallelujah praise God amen amen oh they believe it tonight oh I'm finished oh let's give the Lord a praise offering tonight amen amen what a Time Hallelujah Glory oh let's lift our hands and worship Him Oh Glory Hallelujah Oh Glory Glory Glory
