we feel this presence among us and we are happy to have each and every one that have come out to have fellowship with us this morning i say god bless you um so you may be seated we have a special this morning from my wife and um i guess i'll give you my microphone lamb of god is the title of the song praise god amen [Music] your only son no sin to hide but you have sent him from your side this

god thank you jesus for the lamb of god and his precious blood god bless you praise be to god do you thank him for the lamb of god that taketh away the sins of the world john identified him on that day and he said behold the lamb of god which taketh away the sins of the world and friends we too in this day and age have got to identify the lamb of god and recognize your day in his message because the lamb of god is the word is the holy spirit amen amen it's the fullness of what has been revealed to us in this our day that's the true lamb of god amen we're not talking about a measure of the word we're not talking about amen a good sermon but god sent a prophet and he told us we now have the perfect interpretation of the word with divine vindication not only is the word true but it's vindicated hallelujah to the lamb so today as members of the fifo ministry we are not ashamed of the words of the son of man amen we're not ashamed of the son of man nor his words because we preach a vindicated message yes sir praise be to god we don't have to ever preach and go home and wonder whether things will take place amen they have already prophetically taken place amen because this message amen is a prophetic message praise be to god and just before you stand i just wanted to greet uh brother solomon nachina from the life tabernacle in ghana uh tamale i believe it's pronounced tamale if i don't have that quite right please forgive me amen this uh we were asked to make a video which they will be playing during their december convention we pray and we trust that god will bless you in a special way we send greetings to you to your pastor your church uh there the helps the governments the people who are waiting on the coming of the lord amen i want to let you know here in this little place original faith gospel tabernacle we have a group here that are waiting for the coming of the lord amen and distance may have separated us physically but we're not separated in spirit because we're one in spirit and in truth if we're preaching the same thing amen and if god has revealed to us the same thing therefore we're not really far uh in spirit amen so for us it is a great blessing it is a great honor to share this little thought uh this morning with you and i have my time clock on you just turned on and uh so we will be uh speaking to you for about an hour or so and this time i have to because this is a meeting uh and i don't want to take the precious believer's time amen although locally here we know that an hour is not enough actually amen you get into speaking about the wonderful things and promises of god amen and you know when you go to a ball game or whatever the sports uh the sports world i mean time means nothing of course they do have a time in which they um set and it never actually is the time that they set you know you play a football game or whatever it may be and and each quarter has a certain designated time but you add up all the time at the end of the game it goes way over what they designated for but and you know no one's complaining oh bless god it went over uh you know because they're in the game amen they want to see who won you know so therefore i'm so thankful that uh you know it's hard to kind of put jesus and the word into a time slot and frame because he's beyond time amen he's eternal so i want to also say this before we get into the message that i want to greet all the ministers in the wonderful name of jesus christ and that uh young lady that you heard singing this morning was my wife amen rebecca robledo the best singer in town in my opinion amen yes best singer in town and uh so therefore been singing a long time we were talking about uh the other day you know it's been 40 uh what 41 years or so uh married and in the ministry and yet and yet um we are so thankful for all that god has uh done for us he's been faithful he has taken us through uh hard times good times and we all have so much to thank god for amen and i wouldn't trade this time for any other time because this time we are nearing the coming of the lord amen amen and the one that we loved and the one that we have read about the one that we have uh pray to will come become visible among us amen and we'll see him one day soon amen and what a day that's gonna be and i'm so thankful for that so god richly bless you all the ministers although i have not been uh seen in public too much uh i am alive and well we are here every sunday uh morning preaching the gospel of jesus christ amen so i am alive and well and of course with the covet situation we all know that you're limited in travel and limited in uh various things that you have to do and i do have a job now which i have to uh attend to besides preaching the gospel just about every weekend uh so but we are live we are well and i want to let every uh believer and every pastor and church know that we are fine here and if you ever uh come around new york city uh look us up amen we'll be glad to uh greet you amen and if possible have fellowship with you around the word of god so let us now stand to our feet and we will going to uh we are going to speak on this subject uh this morning of the [Music] uh yeah go out and meet the bridegroom go out and meet the bridegroom amen what a wonderful inspiration that our brother solomon had amen because we realized that if we're asked to go to meet the bridegroom well there's a way to go out and meet him and we just not can't we we can't casually meet him uh without well let's get into this scripture and then we will find out that there is a distinct difference between the foolish and the wise versions because they're both you have the five uh well they were all versions number one five of them were wise and the other five were foolish they all had lamps so they all from the outside uh outside appearance all look like the same and they were all versions which show that they were uh you know good people but there was a very uh important distinction that made that separated them and allotted one or half of them to be foolish and the other half to be wise and we're going to find out why by the grace of the holy spirit it is so important to make sure that we have oil in our lamps because we realize that that the only difference between the wise and the foolish versions were was the oil or the lack of oil so reading now from matthew chapter 25 and we'll start with the first verse then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto 10 virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom how many took their lamps 10. so you couldn't tell them apart by counting uh the versions or the lamps they all went out together and five of them were wise and the other one were foolish all right we can then ask a question why in verse two why was half of them or five of them wise and the other five foolish verse three they that were foolish took their lambs and took no oil with them but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps and while the bridegroom tarried they all slumbered and slept and we realized how brother branham he spoke about how um the bride as it were throughout the ages is slept that had to be awakened amen and this end time message was an end time of behold the bridegroom cometh amen and all those sleeping uh virgins whether they're foolish your wives would have had to uh uh you know listen to that message because when malachi 4 comes on the scene amen christ is to follow amen praise be to god he was the one that woke up the bride amen so therefore through a message wow though a bridegroom tarried all of them slumbered and at midnight there was a cry now i guess they probably just looking at this in the background these uh wise and foolish versions they probably waited for quite some time and they didn't see the bridegroom anywhere to be found and some well figured that they can get some rest and he'll probably come tomorrow you see but this is where we let our guards down because we don't know the hour or the day or the time you see but we have to be ready when he comes now isn't that that's a little challenge because if somebody said you know i'm gonna come meet you you know at uh at a certain place be there be ready but i'm not telling you when i'm coming [Music] how do you live your life you know where the meeting place is going to be you see but if you have confidence in that individual uh you're going you know he's coming amen but you don't know when so you have to be around in such a way and just like the exodus huh just like the exodus remember the exodus how they uh moses told them to uh make sure that you are prepared to travel amen amen keep your sandals on keep your shoes on keep whatever is is on because we're going here we're leaving here very quickly amen so therefore we have to be ready when he comes and at the midnight there was a cry may behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him then all those versions arose and trim their lamps see all the versions trim their lamps and we'll we're going to speak on on on the wick uh also uh this morning because i'm sure that during a convention like this everybody will take a subject no doubt read the same scripture and probably will highlight one particular uh point and together it'll it'll make a wonderful wonderful time in the lord but uh something the lord spoke to me something there about the wick you see it's a very important part of the land because you can have oil in the lamp but you have to have uh the wick dipped in the oil and the wick is what draws the oil that's right amen and is it a fire has got to strike the tip of the wick and if it's not drawing the oil which is the holy spirit amen this is why we as christians today have got to be drawing the virtue and strength of the holy spirit amen to manifest on the outside that which is on the inside amen amen so you can preach a good message on a good wick or whatever it is but i want to know if is it lit that's right amen is it lit and that's a proof that there's real oil in the lamp but now all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps and the foolish said the foolish said unto the wise give us of your oil for our lamps are gone out how could that be you know what they probably were not expecting cb because the bridegroom delayed they didn't plan for that scenario they did not plan for a midnight arrival and meanwhile if we're looking for the coming of the lord we have to live like today is the day that he's coming amen we cannot leave things to tomorrow we cannot put off things that we could do today we've got to live our lives in such a way that we are ready when he comes and especially when it comes the oil of the holy spirit in which we will speak on uh this morning but the wise answered saying not so lest there be not enough for us and you but go ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves now this here is where they missed [Music] the bridegroom they left their position of where they were to meet the bridegroom and they were not there when the bridegroom came where were they they were shopping for oil is that correct [Music] so that was a foolish thing to do because if you were prepared ah if you know he's coming this way no ain't no way you're going to go out and i i may miss him amen amen i may miss the lord i may miss his coming but no they figure well i'll i'll have some time and when i get back then you know he he probably would have not returned yet and i'll join the rest of them but to their shock and amazement wow they went to buy now i don't know what kind of place this was the bible says it's midnight or so and they're going out and buying oil it's kind of late they kind of they found it i don't know how much long how how much later they found it doesn't say but they found the oil and they come back with it but god has a an appointed time amen and his time does not adjust for you and i that's right when he said he's coming at a certain time at a certain place we better be there because the train waits for no one amen hallelujah you better have your ticket you better have your token amen and be ready to go when the train pulls into the station amen and after came also the other version saying uh all right let's let's go back to verse 10 and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they uh that were ready went with him to the marriage and the door was shut with the five that went uh with him amen they met him they recognized who he was he was the bridegroom they had their lamps and it to show you that lamp will always talk about evening or night time that's right you don't need a lamp during the day so all of these things are taking place during a day that is dark so now they go out [Music] the five wise go into the marriage of the lamb the bridegroom and after came also the other version saying lord lord open to us but he answered and said verily i say unto you i know you not [Music] now verse 13 watch therefore for ye no neither the day nor the hour wherein the sun a man cometh amen so he's asking us finally to watch what does that mean watch in the morning watch in the noon time watch in the evening amen watch when the sun goes down we should always be watching amen for the coming of the lord amen uh let us turn to revelations 19 and we will be reading from verse nine and rather verse seven through nine verse seven through nine and then you can have a seat and keeping my eyes on the clock let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife hath made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be arrayed and find linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints and he saith unto me right blessed are they which are called to the marriage supper of the lamb and he saith unto me these are the true saiyans of god may the lord add a blessing to the reading of his word let us pray our heavenly father we have read your word lord and it's uh a blessing to us to be living in this time where i believe these scriptures these quotes are alive and more meaningful to us than ever before lord and we see the scene that we have just read how the bridegroom was predicted to come and yet he delayed the bible said he delayed and sometimes we sit around and talk about oh my parents they were waiting for the coming of the lord and now they're long gone is he actually coming it has the lord delayed his coming no he's always on time amen always on time long suffering waiting perhaps there's a lost soul somewhere that needs to be saved perhaps there's a mother of father or sister brother that yet has to come in so we have to wait until the last predestinated seed of god comes in to the ark then the rapture will go and we know that so therefore we ask for patience and your grace dear god that we may be able to endure lord the extra time that uh we would have to fight and dwell upon this evil earth dear god and we know that there is nothing no nothing that the devil can send our way that god will not help us overcome so father i pray that you would bless each and every one here under the sound of my voice and bless those on the internet lord bless those that would hear this tape lord and i pray that it would be a mighty blessing to the people because that's what we are here for to be a blessing and not only a blessing but to be truthful amen with your word because there are so many things that are spoken today in the name of christianity and in the name of this message that are absolutely false so father we take our stand today because when it comes to the holy ghost when it comes to the oil the true oil of the holy spirit dear god this is the theme of the omega church it was a theme of the apostles it has got to be the theme of the omega church so father we boldly preach it in the name of jesus lord i pray that if there's any sick here among us heal them lord and i pray if anyone is need of deliverance may you deliver each and every one father both on the internet and wherever this tape should go we ask it in the name of jesus christ amen and amen hallelujah you may be seated god bless you amen excuse me i just have a little cold this week just battling a little bit but i'm here for service amen hallelujah not gonna let a little cold uh keep me from my post of duty amen so i chose for a title go out and meet the bridegroom that's a wonderful wonderful uh statement there go out and meet the bridegroom and we can actually go back i didn't want to get too detailed in this message because my time is limited but if you take the old customs of the bible and the the wedding ceremonies of the old testament and and the actual weddings and jesus time and so forth it was very different than our weddings that we do have today amen so they had wedding uh uh well they had their wedding party they had the bridesmaids and they have the the friend of the bridegroom and so forth and we realized that a man a young man who proposed to a woman he had to be able to take care of her amen he had to provide for her he had to and i saw this when i went to israel that there were uh places under construction in various different parts of israel and i was asking uh because it was just a kind of a a thing that got my attention the construction of this particular place and i noticed the proximity of another house that probably was completely all fixed and completed and the tour guide said well that is the property of a bridegroom and he's preparing a place for his bride amen and he cannot you know him and his father meaning the the groom and the father of the groom they're planning amen a place for him to receive his wife his new wife to be and isn't that a beautiful type how jesus said i go to prepare a place for you amen that where i am you may be also amen amen this is why i have so uh nailed this down to here we have no continuing city but we seek one to come amen we see we're under debt here and you know the bill collectors come and knock on our door and trying to collect the rent and everything else and i know it's been tough here after i mean during a covet time and after covet time whatever it's been rough i mean bills are rolling in and so forth but god has a mansion already paid hallelujah i go to a prepare a place for you amen how did he buy it by the blood of jesus christ already paid for hallelujah glory be to god your salvation is paid for your healing is paid for your deliverance paid for even your children's deliverance are paid for hey amen all we have to do is to believe the word of god and god will absolutely manifest his word but now let me start this message here this morning with a quote uh from the rapture tape in 1965 and that was a mind-blowing tape you know brother branham speaking on the rapture and yet the setting in which he had to preach it was quite uh remarkable in the cafeteria here the the plates you know and the forks and things are cleaning up the tables whatever it was but this was a a powerful tape because it sets in order the coming of the lord for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout voice and trump amen and let us not forget that jesus does all three so we here in the original faith gospel tabernacle we tried to stay with what brother branham said and if we agree on certain things and we'll amen what you're saying amen we're around the world but it has to come to the word yes amen we can only have fellowship around the word of god amen but when we go off of these principles these basic principles then we're going to find ourselves in a mess but listen the first thing comes when he started when he starts uh descending from heaven there is a shout see what is it is a message to get the people together amen amen a message comes first fourth first now lamp trimming time rise and trim your lamps hey man what watch uh what what was that what watch was that that was the seventh not the sixth the seventh behold the bridegroom cometh the seventh church age listen the bridegroom wasn't coming in the sixth age he wasn't coming in the fifth age brother branham was to forerun the bridegroom in the seventh watch praise god and he come with a message he wasn't just any ordinary uh uh minister he come with a message amen to wake up that bride seven thunders give faith to wake that bride up amen after a while we'll find out where it is written i can get oh we'll get into certain things in in a minute but listen amen a message comes first amen lamp trimming time so right away amen that was a friend of the bridegroom declaring unto us that the time has come the bridegroom is coming amen hallelujah and he was sent to forerun and let us know the bridegroom is coming hallelujah trim your lamps amen make sure you have oil in your lamps praise god hallelujah and i'm going to talk about the true oil i'm not talking about some synthetic oil or some made-up oil or some uh uh um oil that you made up amen brother branham talked about that you know when you have the mechanics and dynamics together amen you can have a car amen and you can have a gasoline jug gasoline jug that says gasoline on the outside and you pour it into your car and you can sit there day and night and try to start your car it's not going to start because it's not gasoline in the jug it looks like gasoline amen but it's not functioning like gasoline amen because there it when you turn amen that ignition amen and if there's real gasoline in the vehicle amen it puts that vehicle into action by creating a spark hallelujah amen and all of a sudden the engine parts begin to turn and amen hallelujah this is why i want to say does it work amen i don't want no no water in my car i want real true old-fashioned gasoline i want good old-fashioned oil in my lab amen something that will work something that will light the foot amen the bible says that your word lord is a lamp unto my feet amen praise be to god now let's continue now islam truman trying to uh time arise and trim your lamps what watch was that the seventh not the sixth the seventh watch behold the bridegroom cometh rise trim your lamps and they did some of them found that they didn't have any oil in their land see but it's lamp trimming time it's malachi 4 time what he promised luke 17. amen uh and all of these other things look revelations 10 7. all of the other thing it's malachi 4 time it's sea time bright time all of these prophecies that it can perfectly set it in order for this day so the message was to set in order the what coming of the lord amen that's what this message is all about and we don't stop there and say oh that was a good thing that brother brown uh set the message amen uh in order the order of the coming of the lord friends we're you know sure we're going up the road now but now we get into uh the deeper things and we find out we better have a lamp on our feet you're gonna find because there are so many out there that are preaching so many different things that you may miss it if you're not careful so malachi 4's message is to call out a bride for us to meet the bridegroom amen that was his only commission he didn't bind people to himself he was called to introduce the bride to the right room in fact he was called to espouse us to the word amen which is christ and now we are espoused to the word which means that we made a promise in sickness and in death we made a vow you know the wedding vows and so forth and he made a vow back to you yes i will take care of you in sickness and in death to death do us part and yet there is no death you know i will supply your needs when you're sick i'll make you well when you need a deliverer i'll be there hallelujah you are mine exclusively and even though the devil may try to flirt with you you can show them your ring of predestinated grace before the foundation of the world and you say devil i'm already spoken for hallelujah can a devil amen uh i mean that can flirt with you try to flirt with you but no no no this one's already taken brother branham told her to show the devil your ring of predestinated grace amen amen you've been spoken for but now when we see that the seventh watch the seventh church age what happens and is going to tie into what we're talking about now because in the laodicean church age what happens the lights goes out and by faith when brother branham was showing the light of the church ages and you read the church age book brother branham says that that light throughout the church ages struggling to stay on and when it came to lay out a seer there was almost complete darkness and laodicea and so much as we spoke here just a week ago or so that god was he would he spewed uh leaders here out of his mouth they were not hot and they were not cold they were just lukewarm and there is a situation in this message today with a lot of lukewarm people they've lost their fire for god that is the truth that's gospel you think it's all right to stay home and say okay i don't need any pastor i don't need anyone to to to to preach to me what i should do should not do amen you are backslidden that's right amen let me tell you the truth amen well bless god now i can hear this also from a distance and i can hear a song so i follow soul soul and yet you don't pay your tithe that's right to that person you don't pay anything that's a layout of seeing spirit amen that's right go out to meet the bridegroom amen are you going to meet him out meet him like that in that condition no all right i'm i'm getting into something and i don't i'm just i'm going to be good i'm going to be good amen but people kind of get nervous but you know the truth has got to be spoken it's got to be spoken you have to speak it because then you will never say that oh i have never heard it before there is a falsehood that is spreading through the message like covet it's killing people spiritually speaking is killing people cannot breathe anymore meanwhile the breath of life is is is is there to receive and they are in you know critical condition as it were lukewarm but i'm going to tell you something you know what they have provided today oh are you vaccinated are you vaccinated are you vaccinated and thank god they have provided many vaccinations today in our country and i trust and pray i mean it's all up to you some say that the vaccination is the mark of the beast and everything else but it's how it has helped our group let me just say that amen uh it's helped our group and we by the grace of god when since we have opened again there hasn't been one case here amen by the grace of almighty god we thank god for it and it's uh we thank god for his mercy but if you ever take the vaccination of the holy ghost let me tell you something that will work on your dna rna any kind of a amen that is wrong over any disease hallelujah that's what the church needs today is a good old-fashioned inoculation of the baptism of the holy ghost amen so therefore when we see this day approaching when we are in this day i only have about half hour or so but now let's see what the difference is okay let's see what the difference is between the wise and the foolish versions brother branham says in the 10 and 10 versions and 144 000 message he says now watch these two churches he calls them churches oh if there was some way i could just make the people see it just burns in my soul these churches are just as clean and holy as this one if they're all virgins see they're all version just as clean the only difference was the oil in the lamb the holy ghost the only difference they look alike they dress alike they have the same lamp they probably wore the same clothes the difference was the oil or the lack thereof and it was an attitude most of all because you had five wise versions that made preparation amen just in case he should come in an hour that i don't even think that he may come while the foolish versions then they were not even thinking about the possibility of him coming in the hour that they did not expect amen this is why the bible says let us be ready if you knew that a burglar was going to come into your house at a certain time i guarantee you you will not suffer that burglar to come into your house you'll be right there waiting for them and when you try to come into your house you tell them devil get out of here in the name of jesus christ you take the shotgun of faith and boom out he goes because you were ready you were prepared hallelujah amen it's those that don't be prepared oh i'm so surprised i i was vandalized and everything they took everything and meanwhile you have heard reports all over the neighborhood that there's vandal vandalism going on but she didn't think it's to happen to you you see the thing is we've got to pinch yourselves and make sure but this is what makes the predestinated different than any other person because in their hearts the holy ghost will always speak to your heart amen i'm going to tell you something without that voice that speaks to you no you shouldn't do this go over there do this no stay away from there that little something that's still a small voice leading you to all truth [Music] but they didn't have that little small little voice ah he's he said he's coming yesterday he didn't come yeah i waited all day today he didn't come so i'm not saying that they did not have oil at one time but the bible said it ran out amen and they refused to refill amen and this is what i want to make sure that you understand amen some people just oh yes i got filled with the holy ghost years ago and bless god you know brother abraham said one baptism many fillings amen every hour lord god give me a refilling hallelujah sometimes our experiences get a little old and they get all formal and hallelujah where we need the holy ghost every day in our lives don't tell me that was good for years ago is good for now as well it set you on fire years ago it'll set you on fire today hasn't changed praise god amen is the same holy ghost glory be to god the same oil the only difference was the oil in the lamp the holy ghost and the holy ghost if it's in there see it produces a very same kind of fire listen that it did on the on the day of pentecost but they don't have no fire no oil in their lambs they have church rituals church rituals see it can be fine ceremonies nothing against that crete uh would shake your conscious and songs that angels sing like angels and you couldn't put your finger on their lives see you couldn't do it but still that throne it's just part of it you can sing you can sing like an angel you can give your body amen to be burned and give to the poor and that's all nice but it's not all of it it says that's the kind that misses the rapture amen did you hear what i just said amen amen good people bless god can you point anything in my life no can you say that i am i'm an adulterer or whatever can you say that i'm this or that did i am i a liar or cheater that's not what we're saying amen in fact that's not even what the parable of the uh five uh virgins foolish and wise is all about right because they were all versions the difference was the oil that was the difference the sole difference so if that was the difference then it must be very important [Music] it is the deciding factor of whether we walk in or cast out now when i read this i guarantee you and i hope it has the same impact it had on me it's just a part of it so it's not just going through rituals of the message do you realize we had five retreats last year you know and so many people were baptized and so forth and that's all good then it's hard to keep those people who were baptized unless you bring them to the holy ghost is that correct the holy ghost is what grounds the person amen the holy ghost is what changes a heart amen the old nature of the heart the human heart it changes you from a wolf to a lamb amen hallelujah you don't have to walk out of the church and hope that you don't act the old way that you used to amen if the real true holy ghost came into your heart that devil is burnt out oh let me tell you something hallelujah hallelujah god is sealed in and the devil is sealed out that's what the true holy ghost is amen and if you're still struggling amen with your personal life if you're still struggling trying to overcome and you're still tr struggling amen you and you wearing worldly things and you doing the things of the world and you still holding on to your holy ghost experience let me tell you something very clearly let that go let that go you know why because that doesn't work for you amen let that go because my bible says that when the holy ghost comes in hallelujah listen when a demon comes out of a person huh one strong demon and is cast out see then there is a vacancy in that heart is a vacancy amen and that basic vacancy belongs to the holy spirit god himself predestinated to be there but after a while when it's cast out amen you feel good while it's cast out but yet you feel an emptiness ah and then you get closer and just get drawn closer to the world and the next thing you know a demon will look inside that heart and find it empty cleaned out oh that's not that flat has not been occupied yet that apartment has not been occupied yet oh my i'll bring seven more of my friends amen and i'll come back in why because there's nobody in there to keep them out but when the holy spirit is in there it seals that holy spirit in to the day of your redemption it's no more fighting about the the the things of the world hallelujah this is old-fashioned preaching i'm sure to some people amen think although that's that's just the way it was preached years ago well thank god i'm not changing the way i preach it amen it's the same way hey hallelujah the same holy ghost see just part of it but not all of it see is that is that's the kind that misses the rapture see the psalmist david speaks unto us in psalms 119 and verse 105 thy word is a lamp unto my feet so what is the lamp the lamp is a word and a light unto my path the word is a lamp unto my feet to light up my path and without light you know in darkness it is very difficult to find and navigate around so it's very important what i'm about to say here because in bible times listen you didn't have the streets of jerusalem lit the way there it is today you don't have these electricity electrical lights and things in a major city no they were uh with little lamps at night and it was very difficult to travel through the nighttime you don't know also who was hiding in any kind of uh thief or you know people that were to do you wrong so you needed light [Music] to see a little further off amen so therefore there was no street lights as it were electric street lights in the bible times lamps were used a source of illumination to direct the path of people who needed a sense of direction brother branham also he said it speaks of a dispensation of a nighttime or darkness now let us get back to this laodicean church age amen somebody asked brother brandon i believe brother branham you talk about that the laodicean last went into complete darkness and i'll share this with you and i trust that because i heard it from somebody of a reliable source and i think it's worth repeating when he said about 1977. where did he get that from and somebody was sharing with me some kind of vision that brother branham had or supposed to have had there was a calendar pages [Music] you know and every every page was something and then 77 it was just nothing but darkness nothing goes beyond 77 complete darkness after 1977. so in brother branham he perceives that there is no way that anything can live and survive in that darkness how can we survive in darkness how can we just survive in this uh when you when i talk about darkness you see what is darkness darkness is error darkness is sin darkness is all that is not god that's what guard and darkness is so it goes into a complete total darkness but when brother branham by faith was drawing out the church ages there was a little sliver of light in which he drew out in the seventh church age a little sliver of light and that light was put there by faith knowing that there shall be light in the evening time the path to glory you will surely find so therefore the only light where do you find the light the only light that would be left on this earth is the light in you and i am amen can you say amen to that amen is that the truth look around and you see darkness and gross darkness all over but yet there's a light amen in you oh hallelujah the devil didn't start it and he can't blow it out hallelujah there's a lighter predestination hey amen before the foundation the world god knows is his own there was a light of predestination amen so john 12 and 35 then jesus said unto them ye a little yet a little wilder and this light is with you walk while you have the light lest darkness come upon you for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whether he goeth amen that's the word matthew 25 and 13 we read it watch therefore for you know neither the day nor the hour wherein the son of man coming now let me go back to what i have been speaking on i'm almost done i have stressed this and i have brought this out because during the seven church ages if you read your book and you study the seven church ages there was one like unto the son of man who walked among seven golden candlesticks and they were lit first age was lit everyone was lit he was walking but among in every age but when you come to the laodicean church age you find the same christ who was walking among the seven church ages this time he's outside amen this time he's outside on the outside looking in outside of his church what up how can there be light in that place if jesus the light of the world is outside knocking trying to get back into his church [Music] and that church in their layout is in church they are worshiping making a lot of noise oh yes they're moving and dancing and carrying on know jesus jesus is not in the house spirit is not in the house he said i stand at the door knock so this is what i want to tell you and i know that i have been going on week after week after week i have 14 minutes to tell you [Music] and i will tell you what a shame to reach delay us in church age and find that the very god the very messiah that we seek is not even in the church let me give you a type remember when the three wise men they come a long distance because they have seen the star in the east and they had come all that way to worship him the newborn messiah they traveled through treacherous times and conditions and things and it led them to a place that seemed to be over jerusalem and in their mind they thought for sure if any people would know it would be these people amen this is where all the churches were at all the priests were at all the ministers association was that that the bishop of whatever was there so they walked into jerusalem inquiring where is he that is born king of the jews for we have seen his star and i've come to worship him amen you know what they ask where is who we've never heard of such a person not only that but when they went into religious denominational within the denominational city they looked up and they couldn't see the star the star was not in the city don't expect the star the light the messiah amen to be in the biggest churches the biggest cities because what happened is when they got into that religious realm know it all priests they didn't even know that messiah was on the earth now and they said okay you don't know let me walk out of here i just but when they walked out of the city they looked up and they saw the star oh and when they saw the star they rejoice with great joy glory be to god listen you have to seek and find and look until you find the star in your church you don't want to start outside your church you don't want jesus outside the church you want the good old-fashioned holy ghost moving in your church you want signs wonders and miracles moving in your church amen without the holy ghost the church dies hallelujah and i'm talking about not some mental conception i'm talking about the old-fashioned experience the way it was preached from the beginning it doesn't change for anyone nobody no intellectual giant can change the experience of the holy ghost paul said boldly if any man come preaching any other thing let him be a curse why should i feel bad about calling things a curse when paul tells me to do it not beating you up preaching the gospel time has come to come back to the world one final thing we are more divided today than we ever was [Music] i have never seen so many fights in my life i have never seen so much hatred in my life that's why i stay around i stay away from negative people amen watch your friends stay away from negative people because they want to drag you into their negativity [Applause] they have a whole list of people that they have ought against and they want to be your friend all right the next thing you know you are their friend and then they talk about the other ones that they don't quite approve and the next thing they want their enemies to be your enemies as well but a holy ghost person don't get involved with that kind of stuff [Music] oh no no no no no no no listen there's too much love in the holy ghost person oh it doesn't stick the hatred doesn't stick into the heart amen hallelujah it's in your heart that's the difference with the holy ghost you're not busy trying to make somebody or de-christianize somebody you just simply are trying to preach the truth to get people back to the word back to the center of the listen of the gospel is that too hard to ask amen can we go back to the quotes that that we used to read years ago or have we put some of these quotes aside because they don't quite fit with our teaching today that's how you can see how far they have strayed and then they say oh we must think outside the box well that's the problem you're outside yeah you're outside the box i can't go out with you outside the box and try to look at what you're looking at i can't this is why i say how can we walk together lest we be agreed amen we have to agree in principle in doctrine and somewhere some common ground if not let's keep our conversations general because as a christian we cannot communicate and we cannot fellowship because we have no common ground one wants to hate and the other one praise god wants to love and forgive and i want to remind you over on the other side hallelujah brother braham said nothing but perfect love will make it there nothing but perfect love will make it there so i don't care how intellectually right your doctrine sounds there's a way that seemeth right to a man but that's the way that leadeth to destruction god is not impressed with your intellectual uh a understanding of scripture he is the one who is the author and the finisher of the scripture he is not impressed how you can twist it in such a way to make it sound in a way that is presentable to people you think christ is the seed he's not deceived he is the word hallelujah amen adam was not deceived he was the word now if you have people looking for and hearing seeking for knowledge new knowledge and new life people got tired of the message that's the problem they get tired of the message oh they're they're actually going after new things new age thing new age i don't have a new age the only new age i have is that eternal turk change at the end of the seals and that's where it ends [Music] inventing new uh other ages i'm gonna close with this brother at least you can come because this is this is what i want to nail down questions and answers because this has been something that i have preached for years and this is something that brother branham preached all of his ministry amen and this is something that brother coleman preached all of his ministry amen and this is something by the grace of god let me so help me god amen stick with it amen friend and old friend you can take your formal holy ghost i don't want it amen because when i read this it settles it for me amen brother braham said questions and answers 1964 see you cannot receive the baptism of the holy ghost without having an experience oh hallelujah now i i'd like to ask you can you read can you still read this quote listen it was so powerful for me i still remember my date i remember my birthday june the 8th hallelujah i was born again it's something that happens to you and change you dramatically you cannot forget it's an experience you'll never forget today they ask you to put your name on a book and so forth join church and so forth you got the holy ghost you are you will never remember that i guarantee you never remember that where is the experience all right let's continue i like that first sentence amen you cannot receive the baptismal holy holy ghost without having an experience uh when it happens now if you believe every speck of word you say uh you say you believe a respect of it then the word is laying in there waiting for the holy spirit to put it to work hallelujah right now the word is hitting you but the holy spirit is waiting to put it to work hallelujah because you believe the promised word you believe everything that the prophet said you believe the old-fashioned holy ghost the holy spirit is waiting to put it to work because you are a believer hallelujah praise be to god hallelujah you are a believer that's the holy ghost i believe in amen you don't have the holy ghost don't worry about it the holy ghost is waiting to put it into action but it has to have seed to fall upon you see you have to believe or it's not going to fall on any any anybody you've got to believe and if people believe they have it already just because they have joined a church the holy ghost is going to he has no desire to come upon anything there's nothing to come on but a piece of paper of you signing to join a church all right okay let's let's continue we're almost done now if you believe every okay you believe every speck of words see you say you believe every speck of it see then the word is laying in there waiting for the holy spirit to put it to work but listen but it takes the lighting of the candle hallelujah you see what i'm saying that even if you you need fire to light a candle if you had oil if you had the wick that is dipped properly you still need fire [Applause] still need that experience [Music] to light that wick and let me tell you something when you are set on fire this is the kind of uh candle that never goes out oh no no no no won't go out praise god the devil will try to put carbon on it from time to time but by the grace of god there's lamp trimming time amen and here comes the fire just as bright as ever see here's a candle with the wick uh in it and with all of the uh tallows and everything it has to have in that candle but until the fire comes on it it will never shine any light see no matter how perfect the candle is or how perfect it will burn or anything it's got to be lit [Music] that's why this is what we're trying to do get that fire lit oh brighten up the corner where you are brighten up the corner where you are shine your life for jesus shine it from okay we'll sing that after okay no matter how perfect the candle is or how perfect it will burn and everything has got to be lit and then it burns listen and when you believe and are made up of the instructions of what the holy spirit is love joy peace long suffering goodness fruits that it bears out until the holy spirit with a fiery experience comes down and lights that candle see you haven't received the holy ghost see you've got to have the experience to have the holy ghost i rest my case right here [Music] [Applause] not many people can take that word now they're trying to bypass experience why it's easier oh it's easier you just come in and you know you just come into a church you join and you know and actually another thing that is they don't want that see when people get more sophisticated brother brown told you this before more sophisticated people don't want that old-fashioned experience they don't want it why because they're natural they have never received that amen although they have claimed that they have years ago because if you claim you receive something you will never decide you will never disagree with the good old-fashioned experience you have to stay the same how on earth can you say i got some revelation that we no longer need this it's not a revelation i want [Music] that's not a revelation that will light my candle and you young people let me speak to you if you're listening amen in churches tell you you have the holy oath and you go out and you're defeated every day of your life you you're depressed because you can't even overcome a shadow of a trial the bible says we need power to become sons of god so i'm here to tell you my dear friend there's a real holy ghost experience to be had it'll change the way you walk it'll change the way you talk it'll change the way you live amen it's no longer will be an intellectual thing and where you have to come to church and and memorize charts and everything else and tickle your intellect you can have all the charts in the world and still not have it peter on the day of pentecost didn't pull out a chart he said this is that what was that god come down to manifest what it was and they saw it and they were pricked in their hearts amen nothing against charts as i said but you know but now we're closing patmet's vision talking about the uh oh this is beautiful but i have to miss i have to uh bypass it because my time is up he was talking about the seven golden candlesticks and each lamp brother branham explained it so beautifully that the first lamp had to be lit by a certain fire and then they could not take that first starter fire and light the rest of them it this this was a special fire that started that fire then they had to be put out put aside then they took the fire that started on the day of pentecost took this fire and lit this next age then they put this one back put it there now two are lit amen then they took this one you see because the type here is that the fire that reaches the last age will be the same fire that started the first stage [Laughter] amen so how on earth are you going to change the fire that's right amen amen when the holy ghost had moved from age to age and age and age and almost it went out but by the grace of god it would it started to fire the next age and here come malachi for when it almost was out completely amen the holy spirit was bound by the river euphrates for over 2 000 years but he had a ministry to release the holy ghost amen back to this dark age amen hallelujah and we are feasting on that fire today god still fills with the holy ghost god still delivers god still heals god still oh our god is an awesome god hallelujah to the lamb he's an awesome god hey amen i'm bragging about jesus that's what i'm bragging about amen i don't brag about any man i brag about the man christ jesus amen hallelujah and i will amen anybody that will preach the word of god amen like it was on the day of pentecost and why do i preach in this fashion because this is what paul preached do you know that brother brown said well thank god i'm glad that i preached what paul preached so if he preached with paul preaching thank god i'm preaching what paul preached amen hallelujah so i thank god for the light that has been set amen go out to meet my groom amen don't worry there's a holy spirit the holy ghost seed in your heart you're believing you're believing and you're believing and god knows he sees that but he's waiting amen waiting for that seat to come to full maturity then he's going to anoint it with dynamics and put it to work hallelujah all things are ready let the fire fall oh hallelujah amen the patmos vision and i'm gonna close amen and we'll sing that song uh becky maybe you can help me i just uh sometimes forget the words but i know to brighten up the corner where you are hey man i'm gonna brighten up the corner where i'm where i'm at but listen just in case you're just like what are you talking about is that now these lamp stands the fire that was on these lamp stands in the old testament when they lit one lamp they could not light the next lamp with the same fire see that's what i was just talking about and they had uh the fire see that they had in the hand uh they lit one lamp then picked it up and lit the other lamp and then set it uh set it down and lit the next lamp and then took it and lit this lamp to show see the lamp was the same fire that they started at the beginning same fire so i have to say please don't change the fire please don't change the fire there's no need to change the fire see the lamp with the same fire that they started at the beginning you mean the same holy ghost that's really something for a person who's like who can't understand the supernatural the same holy ghost that fell on the day of pentecost in his power and his authority in its you know because they had the holy spirit in a very special measure amen remember amen they had the holy ghost also that not only sealed them into the body but they were positionally placed at the same time so they come out of the upper room apostles teachers evangelists so forth but in this age of course we are sealed first and we grow into our positions amen but now think of what is fixing to pour out now charity to seal you in and put you into the position that god ordained you to be in before the foundation of the world oh i hope you don't it doesn't go over your head jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever the same fire the same holy ghost lit every one of these churches right down through the ages same fire not a different one never change anywhere same fire same so if it's the same fire then uh paul preach the holy ghost irenaeus preach the holy ghost martin colombian all over the they all had brother branstad their mechanics and dynamics together it wasn't in the same measure that we have it today neither was it in the same measure that they had it on in the beginning but god said i will restore saith the lord amen but it is promised that at the end amen the fullness of the holy spirit would be restored just like it was on the day of pentecost hallelujah will have the same sign same one the same miracles amen happening right here amen because the fullness of the holy ghost had been released amen and now what people don't understand is that the revelation of jesus christ reveals not only the holy ghost as a spirit to seal you but it reveals a very person the very person of jesus christ oh and the person has a personality a person with his personality he behaves a certain way he acts a certain way he moves a certain way oh let me get a god bless you may god bless our brethren overseas may god bless those that are online i'm sorry for this chopped up message i was trying to keep it to an hour and i believe i missed it by 12 minutes or so but i pray that god will bless you richly and if you want to know what the original faith gospel tabernacle is doing we are alive and well we are alive and well and we are holding on to the faith that was once restored amen hallelujah the original faith
