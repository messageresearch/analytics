fair others are left to come all the way over the bowl and cover and reach there she's got a pop for me brushing god bless you good let's read a scripture I don't sit on no secret First Samuel chapter 16 Leisha Peter says First Samuel chapter 16 Romans 8:28 and this is God speaking to Samuel Samuel and he told him to go to Jesse's house and from verse three go Jesse to the sacrifice and I will show thee what thou shalt do and thou shalt anoint me unto me who I named unto thee and Samuel did did that which the Lord spake and came to Bethlehem and elders with him tremble at his coming and said come as though peaceably and he said peacefully I am come to sacrifice unto the Lord Senta fire selves and come with me to sacrifice and he sent if I'd Jesse and his sons and he called them to sacrifice and it came to pass when they were come that he looked on Eliab and said surely the Lord anointed Lord's anointed is before him but the row said unto Samuel look not on his countenance or on his height of his stature because I have refused him for the Lord seeth not as a man saith for man looketh on the outward appearance but the Lord looketh on the heart then Jesse called a B'nai there and made him pass before Samuel and he said neither ere the Lord chosen this then Jesse made shamah to pass by and he said neither hath the Lord chosen this again Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel and sable said unto Jesse the Lord has not chosen these now what's the important question oops and Samuel said unto Jesse yeah all thy children and he said they remain at yet the youngest and behold he keepeth sheep oh my goodness it was a shepherd man he was a possibility come on out man lousy maternal a many he keepeth sheep and Samuel said unto Jesus and then fetch for him for we will not sit down all the time and he sent and brought him in I was ready and with all the beautiful countenance and goodly to look up to and the Lord said arise anointing for this is he then Samuel took the Horn of oil and anointed him in the muds of his brethren and the Spirit of the Lord came upon David from that day forward so Samuel rose up and went to Rama well excellent at smu top it says diverse it was juicy oversee press Romans 8 grow militia feet width verse 28 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are called according to his purpose for whom he did foreknow he did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom we called them he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we then say to these things if God be for us who can be against us what demon what devil what what person can be against you in college for you sit sure nobody can be against you Kaman and that's what I feel tonight excuse you d'Alene first John room a little bit sweet then treat account here Metin only leave the in Elizabeth 3 verse 1 2 3 what we see be all what men of love the father has bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God therefore the world know of us not because it knew in knots so the world don't know you Lamont nubuck or nappa you trying to mix you the world but do you belong human who you trying to get favor with the world says the world know you it says doesn't because this is the sons of God he says the world knoweth us not because it knew him not beloved now we are the sons of God and it doth not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is and every man that have this hope come just experience all that has this old man that has this hope in him purifies himself even as he is pure may the Lord and a blessing to the you may be seated amenities as well amen I mean I rolled up my sleeves did you say Moshe so that so the devil is in trouble good job I know he knows that just said you will not roll up my sleeves brothers come on you a job you know when I climbed over the airplane put my foot on because you personal Pig on US soil is a place to do so I said I take every sport soccers under my control who is the son of God and I said Lord even the chief Cubana together with these small demons justice I take them under control so that super Sayan came here in the

little title yeah your election is your protection what elección about protects you my subject now we are the sons of God son visited you and my inspiration if God be for us who can be against us oh god bless you - I feel the anointing already amen so just I'm gonna float a little bit on the quotes and I'm gonna I sort of got a three-prong message if I come and see you and I hope we'll be able to have enough time to go through it that's what the Bible says the earth is groaning waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God the world is waiting for the male love to come into their right and that means their domain or the position to make the position because Adam became unconscious who he was circulated and lost control and II lost Dominion but the Bible says Adam lost so it's so important to know who you are if you come to church convention in in conventional you can say you twenty years in the message message you soldier who you are then you must have a revelation when I'm the son of God and I have authority and you know my son when he comes to my home he doesn't ask dead he may post palaka never slice of bread that's cause why I'm also the play goes directly the Reverend on my shock he takes out a lock you see it was you come to me baby whoa baby became adopted was given Authority look because he stayed still in the process you know possible the process was given to him Donnie and then God said Jesus is my son so this my place [Applause] to the Father Jesus hallelujah my god this is the last meeting so somebody must take responsibility to tell the devil that enough is enough somebody's gonna do their brother and I'm saying tonight you can't have this people enough is enough they God's people Jesus died for them call them telling you enough is enough come to the end of 20 grand over to the New Year's promise for the new year with afraid of you coming into your position you see this weekend and Satan is afraid of that so don't pull back after the sweat so going back to the world forward through my adoption hallelujah praise God who is what use it is afraid of your manifestations sadism afraid because your position comes with authority and power a purpose to show fear when you know who you are traffic cop that policeman so police as soon as I don't know what but he has a uniform Oh God these sons will speak the word and it will flash
