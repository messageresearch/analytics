[37:27] Jesus unto them again peace be unto you

[37:35] them and said unto them receiving the
[37:38] Holy Ghost they want to refer to Luke
[37:42] chapter 24 from verse 44 and he said
[37:46] unto them these are the words which I
[37:48] speak unto you while I was yet with you
[37:52] that all things must be fulfilled which
[37:55] were written in the law of Moses and in
[37:58] the and in the son and the prophets and
[38:01] in the Psalms considered me then open he
[38:05] the understanding that they might
[38:07] understand the scriptures and he said
[38:10] unto them thus it is written and does it
[38:13] behoove Christ to suffer and to rise
[38:14] from the dead the third day and that
[38:17] repentance and remission of sins should
[38:19] be preached in his name among all
[38:21] nations beginning at Jerusalem and here

[38:30] Jerusalem until you be endued with power
[38:33] from on high
[38:34] and he led them out as far as the
[38:36] Bethany and he lifted up his hands and
[38:38] blessed them and it came to pass while
[38:41] he blessed them he was parted from them
[38:43] and carried up and heaven and they
[38:45] worshiped him I returned to Jerusalem
[38:48] with great joy and they were continually
[38:50] in the temple praising and blessing and
[38:53] go on revelation chapter 5 when I read
[38:55] from verse 8 and when he had taken the
[39:00] book the four beasts and the fawn twenty
[39:02] elders fell down before the lamb and
[39:04] when every one of them harps and golden
[39:06] vials full of all those which are the
[39:08] prayers of the saints and the summer new
[39:10] song saying thou art willing to take the
[39:12] book and to open the seals thereof for
[39:14] thou was slain has redeemed us to God by

[39:19] tongue and people and nation and has
[39:21] made us unto our God kings and priests
[39:23] we shall reign on the earth and I be
[39:25] and I heard the voice of many angels
[39:27] round about the throne and the beasts
[39:30] and the elders and the number of them
[39:31] was ten thousand times ten thousand and
[39:33] thousands of told us a lovely loud voice
[39:36] worthy is the Lamb that was slain to
[39:39] receive power and riches and wisdom and
[39:41] strength and honor and glory and
[39:43] blessing on every creature which is in
[39:45] heaven and on the earth under the earth
[39:47] and such as in the seal all that are in
[39:50] them who did I see in blessing and honor
[39:53] and glory and power be unto him that
[39:55] sitteth upon the throne and unto the
[39:58] lamb for ever and ever and the four
[39:59] beasts said amen and the four and twenty
[40:02] elders fell down and worship Him that
[40:04] liveth for ever and ever
[40:05] let us pray one more time father we

[40:27] of the Lord hallelujah oh it's a good
[40:31] thing to be in the house of God it's
[40:34] always a privilege to be in the house of
[40:35] yarn I'll give you health and strength
[40:37] and your heart you are here you want to
[40:40] get the benefit of being here in the
[40:42] service of the Lord amen how many
[40:44] appreciate the service last Sunday not
[40:48] by might nor by power but by my spirit
[40:50] what bless you but Isaac that was some
[40:53] message that was some sermon I tell you
[40:57] my God my mind was totally blown oh my
[41:02] and I so enjoyed it only bought the
[41:04] ticket across there in France so we are
[41:08] not creating a new standard this turn
[41:09] that already exists oh praise God a
[41:13] standard of holiness under the
[41:15] righteousness standard of purity a
[41:18] standard of forgiveness after those
[41:20] seven live invoices the standard of
[41:22] always was and always will be this time
[41:25] that is Jesus Christ
[41:27] Oh hallelujah had it only or low could
[41:32] put this thing together like that oh my
[41:35] the people have been taught that church
[41:36] under standard but brother Branham left
[41:39] the stand the wind but her mom left the
[41:41] earth
[41:41] he didn't it didn't sound I didn't leave
[41:43] it's not right the standard was in the
[41:46] hand of the spirit and the Spirit
[41:48] revealed to whomsoever he will so nobody
[41:51] had a license under what the Spirit can
[41:53] reveal isn't that wonderful
[41:55] so the Spirit could reveal the thunders
[41:57] of whomsoever he will isn't that right
[41:59] blessed be the name of the law so this
[42:01] time that was always here isn't that
[42:03] right in the hand of the Spirit and the
[42:06] Holy Ghost is the standard bearer that
[42:08] was time with any man who stands with

[47:51] bomb left we have seen the Lord see
[47:53] revelation inspirations or we have seen
[47:55] the Lord but that was not seen the Lord
[47:57] is to point us to dynamics in the Upper
[48:00] Room
[48:00] it wasn't Jesus staying with them
[48:02] walking where they have no he raised
[48:03] from the dead he come in our mission to
[48:05] open the understanding and open the word
[48:08] that is all because once your
[48:11] understanding is open and the word is
[48:13] awkward when your wood is open to you
[48:14] you know what you have to present you
[48:17] know I have to go there is no other way
[48:20] to go only one place the place of that
[48:23] position of the upper room and in that
[48:25] upper room they were praising and
[48:26] blessing God knowing again once in a
[48:29] while when you feel like that's not what
[48:31] the Bible says they were praising God
[48:34] continually and you have to learn to do
[48:37] that
[48:37] I miss you're trying circumstance I miss
[48:40] you have headache back pain whatever it
[48:42] is I mean disasters you have to still
[48:44] worship because it's a promise
[48:46] praise God hallelujah hallelujah promise
[48:51] to you
[48:51] amen stop a title this morning living
[48:55] under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit
[48:57] that's my title this morning living
[49:00] under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit
[49:02] you don't want to live in the demon
[49:04] powers you don't want to live under the
[49:06] world you don't want to live under a
[49:07] woman's hands leave you feeling any
[49:09] emotions you don't want to live under
[49:10] that you want to be living under the
[49:12] inspiration of the Holy Spirit another
[49:15] inspiration these are the words that the
[49:17] first thing Jesus told them these are
[49:19] the words he didn't give them more words
[49:21] and new words he getting the same words
[49:24] how little that he had before Halloween
[49:27] bring it back and make it more positive
[49:29] or get a lot of salt in the house
[49:32] oh praise God praise God praise God
[49:34] hallelujah praise be to Jesus oh my I
[49:39] want to tell you though me discouraged
[49:41] this morning the Holy Spirit is with you
[49:44] looking over you isn't that right
[49:46] thank you Jesus all right let's go but
[49:49] the Branham says I want to tie into what
[49:51] I got preached but Isaac reached but
[49:53] Satan mixed up healing his shows and so
[49:55] on its appearance is appealing but the
[49:58] enemy keeps finding a better bait just
[50:00] hit another kid and proven his tactics
[50:02] but but he had a stripper a little more
[50:05] don't worry
[50:06] and so forth right okay but what God
[50:08] doesn't have to do anymore to his God
[50:11] does not the Magus was more prettier he
[50:14] I just wanted make it dim with tinsel
[50:16] and so on no no what happen here he
[50:19] doesn't have to make do anything more to
[50:21] his to make it more appealing the only
[50:24] thing he has to do is the reason of
[50:26] standard of his own words against the
[50:30] enemy and the Bible said when the enemy
[50:33] come like a flood the Spirit of God or a
[50:37] boy raises the standard what does he do
[50:40] he makes the word that you already said
[50:44] more positive
[50:46] [Applause]
[50:51] so that's why Jesus come on tell them
[50:53] these are the words cause a little
[50:55] positive to you because I wonder how
[50:58] give you absolutely a guarantee that
[51:01] this promise of the Father it is
[51:04] guaranteed behold I send the promise of
[51:07] my father upon you it is guaranteed some
[51:10] was a river planet in your spirit in
[51:13] your life then we breathe upon him we
[51:16] see be the Holy Ghost the breath of God
[51:19] was upon them they were living under the
[51:21] Norrington anointing of Provence I'm not
[51:24] you know dynamics I'm going to receive
[51:26] Oh blessed be the name of the Lord
[51:30] praise God praise this wonderful name
[51:33] hallelujah you believe that
[51:37] so what Quran says he takes the word
[51:39] that he already said and make it more
[51:42] positive hallelujah not-not-not new
[51:47] words not new mysteries same ones he was
[51:51] telling them all alone you come to make
[51:53] it more real to him the virus in their
[51:56] lives days people are itching ears that
[51:57] he has new stuff the tickle in theory is
[52:00] that you have a live nothing I know just
[52:01] outta here
[52:02] selected here right and here and here
[52:04] the motor here and what if you good
[52:06] about whether you see but this is not
[52:09] that Jesus was talking to them there
[52:11] wasn't catching a lot of stuff he was
[52:12] telling them because it is enough
[52:14] revolution if you revelation gives you a
[52:17] certain behavior I don't care what
[52:20] country you're from what language you
[52:21] speak revelation comes from God not on
[52:26] what you read and study that's your
[52:27] study but well as revealed or spring
[52:29] stimulation it brings excitement it
[52:32] brings real expectation isn't that right
[52:34] so butter Branham says you know the
[52:37] Bible says when the enemy come on like a
[52:38] flood the Spirit of God would raise up a
[52:41] standard and when God here we go
[52:43] when God gives his church a blessing and
[52:46] they move along with that blessing soon
[52:48] until it become common to the world then
[52:52] they begin to run it down then the
[52:55] Spirit of God comes in and raise up a
[52:57] standard again and there's a brick and
[52:59] for a revival or something
[53:01] the message going slow slow coach look
[53:04] who's everybody's together right and the
[53:05] righteous and into everything and
[53:07] brother but I'm safe I'm gonna bow safe
[53:09] but it will revival be comfortable in
[53:13] the comfort zone and so on but
[53:15] afterwards what want to read the
[53:16] standards a revival breaks out
[53:18] isn't that right and we have a promise
[53:20] you say what we see happen should put
[53:22] every soul in action it should make a
[53:24] church that would make a revival that
[53:27] people be finding from Europe to see
[53:29] what's taking place not here to see they
[53:33] will sit as a place in Arizona called
[53:35] Maricopa Valley a city called Phoenix
[53:38] there is something broke out there that
[53:40] the seven thunders of Revelation 10 does
[53:42] not even road is being manifested in
[53:45] other words that gutta comma our where
[53:47] we could say this is that that the
[53:49] Prophet Balaam random speaker
[53:51] praise God not the bunch of churches all
[53:54] around no not that note this prophecy
[53:56] here these are the words Oh hallelujah
[54:00] these are the words you have to connect
[54:03] with these other words Oh hallelujah
[54:05] praise God praise God so he continued
[54:08] all the angels and gathered illusions
[54:11] and we are here he was about to write
[54:13] those tendencies I don't like them seal
[54:15] them up and at the day of selling of
[54:17] these last seven angels to chage what
[54:19] the mystery of God all about God how God
[54:23] is but one God all these things will be
[54:25] finished at that time the great battles
[54:28] back before had got these loose ends
[54:30] hanging out it ought to be wrapped up
[54:32] together in this age so before the
[54:34] thunders could occur all the loose ends
[54:36] has to be tied up before you could get
[54:38] your portion the loose ends in your life
[54:40] have to be tied up isn't that right
[54:43] so brother sister we are the end times
[54:45] left the Holy Spirit influence us to the
[54:50] Word of God let God do the influencing
[54:55] in our hearts and not be influenced by
[54:57] others but as I said a powerful thing
[54:59] that people could get desensitized to
[55:01] the Holy Spirit for the Holy Spirit what
[55:03] we conviction would spread or bring you
[55:05] wrong you should change the attitudinal
[55:07] ways and I told him in Paris but a brand
[55:09] say I rather somebody wrong and their
[55:11] doctrine I
[55:12] right in the spirit that's somebody
[55:15] right in the doctrine unrolling their
[55:17] spirit when somebody right in their
[55:19] spirit they could be corrected when
[55:21] somebody wrong in their spirit thank you
[55:23] terrible you can tell them my power
[55:25] because they're right in the doctor they
[55:26] may be right go this way this or this
[55:28] but they're roaming your spirit oh how
[55:30] that's a religious spirit that's a demon
[55:32] actually Oh hallelujah praise the name
[55:35] of the Lord
[55:36] so watch let the Holy Spirit influence
[55:38] us to the Word of God and let God do the
[55:41] influence in your hearts and not be
[55:44] influenced by others this ought to put
[55:46] us in action with reverence and humility
[55:49] the tiller fire vindicated among us
[55:52] again in the last days he will pour out
[55:54] his spirit do you believe that do you
[55:58] believe this is your promise
[55:59] I really believe this is your promise so

[1:00:42] Christian doesn't know anything and
[1:00:44] puter to him David said blessed is the
[1:00:49] man whom God will not impute sin to when
[1:00:54] you are washed in the blood of the Lamb
[1:00:56] not by McAleese but really the blood of
[1:01:00] the Lamb God does not impute to you
[1:01:03] anything that is done because you are
[1:01:06] under the blood and he doesn't see it
[1:01:08] there is a blood sacrifice the only
[1:01:11] thing you can see you in is the way he
[1:01:14] showed you before the foundation of the
[1:01:16] world when we put your name in the
[1:01:19] Lamb's Book of Life that is all he can
[1:01:22] look at because you are redeemed from
[1:01:25] everything that was ever done you are

[1:02:35] word hallelujah is you a part of that
[1:02:38] book so we want that book to be released
[1:02:41] so that we can go back on it brings got
[1:02:44] it caught up in that dimension but it's
[1:02:46] not come back on the earth until that
[1:02:48] book is unfolded so John is correctly
[1:02:51] weeping he is crying a man filled with
[1:02:55] the Holy Ghost he is weeping because no
[1:02:58] man was from what is a text book but
[1:03:00] notice discovery read when the lamb put
[1:03:02] the book oh don't behavior change all in
[1:03:06] heaven volunteer so therefore your
[1:03:09] worship will express to me expect us
[1:03:13] whether you have any revelation so when
[1:03:16] you see somebody quiet the cow worship
[1:03:18] they look in the look in the look and
[1:03:20] they know something is wrong because
[1:03:22] once you get a revelation that your name
[1:03:25] is on the book you have to behave the
[1:03:29] same way drum behave because there is
[1:03:32] only one lon there's only one spirit
[1:03:34] there's only one baptism and there was
[1:03:37] only one behavior when you're living
[1:03:39] under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit
[1:03:43] there is only one behavior just like
[1:03:47] Mary any of the rumors just like people
[1:03:49] any of Peru

[1:04:02] was separately from Jacques because he'd
[1:04:04] get in Revelation to warn me up a room

[1:18:47] other words God would be known to his
[1:18:50] church not in three people but as one
[1:18:53] person the mystery of God would reveal
[1:18:55] and when that was completely revealed
[1:19:00] then the seven mysteries which is the
[1:19:03] sometimes talked about will be open to
[1:19:05] the church because in there the church
[1:19:09] would be living under the inspiration of
[1:19:12] the Holy Spirit him moving in and out
[1:19:16] showing him signs of being alive Amala

[1:21:14] maybe seeded from revelation book of
[1:21:18] Simba's but I remember Daniel was told
[1:21:21] by the angel Daniel seven thunders the
[1:21:23] voices he covered spent the right is it
[1:21:25] don't write it
[1:21:26] don't write it John for the same thing
[1:21:28] it has already been written outside of
[1:21:30] the Bible had seven seas on the back of
[1:21:32] the book no man can open those seals
[1:21:33] that wants them voices so the seals on
[1:21:37] the back of the book was voices so you
[1:21:39] couldn't see the voices but the voices
[1:21:41] were what revealed was inside the book
[1:21:42] what higher voices rather there so we're
[1:21:45] on pick seven seas on the back and put
[1:21:47] it under the seven seed on the inside
[1:21:49] and make sure they're seven seals not
[1:21:51] fourteen heels if we didn't do that but
[1:21:56] before teams use serve on the backside

[1:22:00] he call it voices the books were seized
[1:22:03] with voices seven voices could go no
[1:22:06] further
[1:22:07] no man know what it was but the Bible
[1:22:09] said and told Daniel and John that in
[1:22:12] the last days these seven voices would
[1:22:16] be known by the real true church so if
[1:22:21] that is so then the real true church
[1:22:24] must have king lamb worship
[1:22:29] if it's revealed to you can stop the
[1:22:33] worship Oh glory to God hallelujah
[1:22:36] hallelujah so we could see who sees the

[1:34:46] oh give the Lord a shout do you see what
[1:34:49] what about to do to you even what the
[1:34:51] tabernacle in side by side of you you
[1:34:53] are born to become a hope for God you
[1:34:55] become about to come a terrible God you
[1:34:58] become the Church of God
[1:34:59] you yourself repeated Christianity
[1:35:12] versus idolatry but a burnable but
[1:35:16] idolatry is a strange thing
[1:35:19] don't do the ages we have had it ever
[1:35:21] since the beginning of time
[1:35:23] now the order for this idol worship is
[1:35:26] the man sets of the idol fixes an idol
[1:35:29] then he goes in and prepares himself for
[1:35:32] this great worship now he believes this
[1:35:34] Idol is made in the image of some God
[1:35:36] that he doesn't never see he's without
[1:35:39] form so he believes he's in an image of
[1:35:42] this idol that he makes it as God now
[1:35:45] don't let that leave you supportive
[1:35:47] Ananya is bringing a point he said now
[1:35:50] the image is in the image image of the
[1:35:53] mythical God if he believes that is then
[1:35:55] he goes for the idol must reach himself
[1:35:58] and believes that the god that's unseen
[1:36:01] placement comes down into this idol and
[1:36:03] he believes that he talks to God to
[1:36:05] decide on that God brings himself into
[1:36:08] the idol and answers him back now many
[1:36:11] of you teachers here that took the
[1:36:12] mythology even those gods their battles
[1:36:14] were honor reclaim now in other words
[1:36:17] the God hypnotized themselves from this
[1:36:20] supernatural standing in the his idol
[1:36:22] speaks back to the worshiper through the
[1:36:24] idol and the worshiper in some kind of
[1:36:26] built up emotional sense disease that
[1:36:29] the idol speaks to him to his heart and
[1:36:31] he's forgiven of his sins whatever more
[1:36:34] which surely shows is the devil is the
[1:36:36] devil that does it listeners know they'd
[1:36:39] all just haphazardly do things these
[1:36:41] worshipers of idols some of them does
[1:36:43] but there's real true worship most of
[1:36:46] those things for instance
[1:36:48] I could tell you stories of how those
[1:36:51] Devils in those idols perform all kind
[1:36:54] of things make blood come out of things
[1:36:57] and everything else they were City stone
[1:37:00] weeping virgin mary weeping on his
[1:37:02] demons devils that you worship in making
[1:37:06] these things happen
[1:37:07] watch they are Devils were on Samia now
[1:37:11] if you don't believe there's a real
[1:37:13] devil then you don't believe there's a
[1:37:15] god sure you got to believe the contrary
[1:37:17] there's a real devil and he's a person
[1:37:19] not a thought not at all
[1:37:22] he is a person but if the teaching goes
[1:37:25] on that the devil just are ever taught
[1:37:27] to get no it isn't the devil is a person
[1:37:29] the same people believes that the Holy
[1:37:31] Ghost is gonna could torture get but to
[1:37:33] believe that the Holy Ghost is a prison
[1:37:37] it is the person of Christ and spirit
[1:37:40] for all that we will say in the Holy
[1:37:43] Ghost they off that is just that is just
[1:37:46] contrary teaching the Holy Ghost is the
[1:37:49] person of Christ in spirit form now
[1:37:53] let's go ahead and food enough now these
[1:37:55] idolaters must straighten themselves for
[1:37:57] the idol believe that the God they are
[1:38:00] worshiping is represented in this Idol
[1:38:03] no you have no you got that the
[1:38:05] worshiper is not a hypocrite
[1:38:08] sisty he is actually getting a hold of
[1:38:13] something that is in that title because
[1:38:17] it come back on him he does something
[1:38:21] and gets it from that idols which is a
[1:38:24] mixed God not a real one so they will
[1:38:27] have testimonies of what that either
[1:38:29] does to them and what they worship and
[1:38:30] does to them or what the church does for
[1:38:32] them they have answers they have witness
[1:38:34] they have confirmations they have all of
[1:38:36] that what is devil and many parents have
[1:38:42] you are you ready that never get into
[1:38:45] those things and the devil get
[1:38:48] intermittent sometimes and impersonates
[1:38:51] themselves as God I have seen this in my
[1:38:55] ministry
[1:38:58] now this is very deep this is let's skim
[1:39:01] milk you said stay where the teaching
[1:39:04] has been taught here here with this word
[1:39:07] don't you leave it you stay right with
[1:39:09] the word no matter what comes what goes
[1:39:11] stay with the world people say come to
[1:39:14] the altar with lying
[1:39:15] teachers lying teachers say just open
[1:39:17] forget everything make a mind blank you
[1:39:19] become an Elijah you become this idea
[1:39:21] what a lie that's open up your soul to
[1:39:25] all kind the devil spirit stick it in
[1:39:26] don't do that
[1:39:27] you must remember there is a devil onion
[1:39:30] person it Christ to the letter almost so
[1:39:33] just because we can be emotional don't
[1:39:36] me we received because we go to church
[1:39:38] domain we are saved
[1:39:40] aha that's a big one that's a big one
[1:39:43] when the church doesn't mean people said
[1:39:45] I see people in this message Christians
[1:39:47] supposed to call Christians be so badly
[1:39:50] it's really disappointment really
[1:39:52] disappointed you want to make these
[1:39:54] people I saved some of them do you even
[1:39:56] know they were sinners learn it jump in
[1:39:59] mobile help some satellite goes it bring
[1:40:02] them them until the fall they in the
[1:40:05] pile in the arrogance while it's
[1:40:08] self-righteousness okay let's go on now
[1:40:10] because we go to church Tommy we are
[1:40:12] saved don't believe those intentions
[1:40:14] spirits a real spirit of God a real Word
[1:40:19] of God is the truth of God which is the
[1:40:22] seed of God let's produce God in your
[1:40:25] life you'll be godly simply holy it's
[1:40:31] continued among another people we find
[1:40:33] where emotions and so forth they become
[1:40:36] Catalans backbiting all kind of ungodly
[1:40:40] things whether that is toxic acid in the
[1:40:42] church it is demon powers
[1:40:44] spirit of men and women who get among
[1:40:47] one another and try to push off and say
[1:40:49] this one is not right this is not right
[1:40:51] that is not right and if you change it
[1:40:54] down nine times out of ten is the very
[1:40:57] person making that still that's not
[1:40:59] right
[1:41:02] God hates discord among brethren be
[1:41:09] reverent be holy love God stand by him
[1:41:14] and as long as you know your life is
[1:41:16] giving up with the Bible with the purity
[1:41:17] of heart with your thought love towards
[1:41:19] your brother trying to your best or bill
[1:41:21] the kingdom of God doing those things
[1:41:23] dressing right living right talking
[1:41:24] right through the right places then you
[1:41:26] can have all the emotions you want and
[1:41:28] everybody will believe it and tighten
[1:41:31] spirits going forth demons under
[1:41:33] disguises look we in the last days as
[1:41:36] the end time false spirits come in and
[1:41:40] begin to tell people this and the other
[1:41:43] we are broke up into nine hundred
[1:41:47] different nominations everyone with
[1:41:48] different view we say they say we
[1:41:51] believe this period that's what we
[1:41:53] believe they can't let the Holy Spirit
[1:41:57] come in they can't have the right of way
[1:42:01] goal got a bunch of people I can shout
[1:42:03] then everybody had to shout they got
[1:42:06] some to speak and tongue then everybody
[1:42:08] had to speak in tongues they got all
[1:42:09] like this till they become what
[1:42:11] absolutely listen contaminated with ten
[1:42:15] thousand spirits entitles people to do
[1:42:21] these emotions when there is a no
[1:42:23] government at all then they go and live
[1:42:26] any kind of life that is either live and
[1:42:28] call it Christian oh praise the name of
[1:42:31] the Lord so I say this because the
[1:42:34] correctly worship God you have to get
[1:42:37] rid of the religious spirits and the
[1:42:39] enticing spirits is that Bush and all a
[1:42:42] bunch of noise and hallelujah glory with
[1:42:43] your hands you have to be able to follow
[1:42:45] through with the word so worship God in
[1:42:48] spirit and in truth

[1:42:55] people fit not just annoying
[1:43:00] it's not just a shout it's not just a
[1:43:03] hallelujah it's breaking free some water

[2:26:38] young brother with 27 years old he's the
[2:26:41] father of four young children and he
[2:26:44] suffered a mental breakdown sometime
[2:26:46] last week his condition is very bad his
[2:26:49] name is John Paul
[2:26:51] thanking off his mercy and his goodness
[2:26:53] towards his people and I'm believing for
[2:26:56] him for a spiritual breakthrough and we
[2:27:00] do have an update on sister Felicia this
[2:27:07] is from sister Marcia
[2:27:09] good morning brother Ovid and sins of
[2:27:11] God I would like to give an update on
[2:27:15] Felicia's surgery and recovery Felicia
[2:27:19] had the surgery done and the 25th of me
[2:27:21] and she went in around 12:30 p.m. and
[2:27:25] came out by 3:30 p.m. when the doctors
[2:27:29] cut her they realized that the
[2:27:32] endometriosis had progressed to stage 4
[2:27:35] the final stage it had fused some of her
[2:27:39] mean organs together her uterus bladder
[2:27:42] and bowel to name a few and it has
[2:27:45] covered other organs and is still
[2:27:48] spreading the vast amount of the
[2:27:51] endometriosis made it impossible for the
[2:27:54] doctors to reach the fibroids and sissu
[2:27:57] sadly the doctors had to close her back
[2:28:00] up and nothing was done the doctors have
[2:28:03] confessed that they cannot do anything
[2:28:04] further for her and that her quality of
[2:28:08] life would only get worse she was
[2:28:10] prescribed medication to help with the
[2:28:12] bleeding from the endometriosis and
[2:28:15] painkillers since that was the doctor's
[2:28:18] report however we believe in the Lord's
[2:28:20] report and as we said healing in the
[2:28:23] children's bread and valishia is a child
[2:28:26] of the Most High God
[2:28:27] Felicia's faith in her healing has
[2:28:30] skyrocketed and she believes that
[2:28:33] Almighty God will perform a miracle for
[2:28:35] her she knows of his wonders and
[2:28:38] miracles as he had performed a miracle
[2:28:41] when he popped open her right ear that
[2:28:44] had 85% hair loss due to nerve damage
[2:28:48] from a birth defect also opening up her
[2:28:51] womb so she can have her beautiful
[2:28:53] daughter Zoe which the doctors confirmed
[2:28:55] our miracles we know without a shadow of
[2:28:58] a doubt God will do it again for Felicia
[2:29:00] we once again solicit your prayers for
[2:29:03] her and my entire family this is the
[2:29:06] season of miracles wonders restoration
